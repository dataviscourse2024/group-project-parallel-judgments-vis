        "text": "Justice Stevens\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.\nA New Jersey statute classifies the possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose as a \u201csecond-degree\u201d offense. N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:39-4(a) (West 1995). Such an offense is punishable by imprisonment for \u201cbetween five years and 10 years.\u201d \u00a72C:4S-6(a)(2). A separate statute, described by that State\u2019s Supreme Court as a \u201chate crime\u201d law, provides for an \u201cextended term\u201d of imprisonment if the trial judge finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201c[t]he defendant in committing the crime acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.\u201d N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a72C:44-3(e) (West Supp. 1999-2000). The extended term authorized by the hate crime law for second-degree offenses is imprisonment for \u201cbetween 10 and 20 years.\u201d \u00a7 2C:43-7(a)(3).\nThe question presented is whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that a factual determination authorizing an increase in the maximum prison sentence for an offense from 10 to 20 years be made by a jury on the basis of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nI\nAt 2:04 a.m. on December 22, 1994, petitioner Charles C. Apprendi, Jr., fired several .22-caliber bullets into the home of an African-American family that had recently moved into a previously all-white neighborhood in Vineland, New Jersey. Apprendi was promptly arrested and, at 3:05 a.m., admitted that he was the shooter. After further questioning, at 6:04 a.m., he made a statement \u2014 which he later retracted \u2014 that even though he did not know the occupants of the house personally, \u201cbecause they are black in color he does not want them in the neighborhood.\u201d 159 N. J. 7, 10, 731 A. 2d 485, 486 (1999).\nA New Jersey grand jury returned a 23-count indictment charging Apprendi with four first-degree, eight second-degree, six third-degree, and five fourth-degree offenses. The charges alleged shootings on four different dates, as well as the unlawful possession of various weapons. None of the counts referred to the hate crime statute, and none alleged that Apprendi acted with a racially biased purpose.\nThe parties entered into a plea agreement, pursuant to which Apprendi pleaded guilty to two counts (3 and 18) of second-degree possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose, N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a72C:39-4a (West 1995), and one count (22) of the third-degree offense of unlawful possession of an antipersonnel bomb, \u00a7 2C:39-3a; the prosecutor dismissed the other 20 counts. Under state law, a second-degree offense carries a penalty range of 5 to 10 years, \u00a72C:43-6(a)(2); a third-degree offense carries a penalty range of between 3 and 5 years, \u00a7 2C:43-6(a)(3). As part of the plea agreement, however, the State reserved the right to request the court to impose a higher \u201cenhanced\u201d sentence on count 18 (which was based on the December 22 shooting) on the ground that that offense was committed with a biased purpose, as described in \u00a72C:44-3(e). Apprendi, correspondingly, reserved the right to challenge the hate crime sentence enhancement on the ground that it violates the United States Constitution.\nAt the plea hearing, the trial judge heard sufficient evidence to establish Apprendi\u2019s guilt on counts 3, 18, and 22; the judge then confirmed that Apprendi understood the maximum sentences that could be imposed on those counts. Because the plea agreement provided that the sentence on the sole third-degree offense (count 22) would run concurrently with the other sentences, the potential sentences on the two second-degree counts were critical. If the judge found no basis for the biased purpose enhancement, the maximum consecutive sentences on those counts would amount to 20 years in aggregate; if, however, the judge enhanced the sentence on count 18, the maximum on that count alone would be 20 years and the maximum for the two counts in aggregate would be 30 years, with a 15-year period of parole ineligibility.\nAfter the trial judge accepted the three guilty pleas, the prosecutor filed a formal motion for an extended term. The trial judge thereafter held an evidentiary hearing on the issue of Apprendi\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d for the shooting on December 22. Apprendi adduced evidence from a psychologist and from seven character witnesses who testified that he did not have a reputation for racial bias. He also took the stand himself, explaining that the incident was an unintended consequence of overindulgence in alcohol, denying that he was in any way biased against African-Americans, and denying that his statement to the police had been accurately described. The judge, however, found the police officer\u2019s testimony credible, and concluded that the evidence supported a finding \"that the crime was motivated by racial bias.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 148a. Having found \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that Apprendi\u2019s actions were taken \u201cwith a purpose to intimidate\u201d as provided by the statute, id., at 138a, 139a, 144a, the trial judge held that the hate crime enhancement applied. Rejecting Apprendi\u2019s constitutional challenge to the statute, the judge sentenced him to a 12-year term of imprisonment on count 18, and to shorter concurrent sentences on the other two counts.\nApprendi appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution requires that the finding of bias upon which his hate crime sentence was based must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970). Over dissent, the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey upheld the enhanced sentence. 304 N. J. Super. 147, 698 A. 2d 1265 (1997). Relying on our decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), the appeals court found that the state legislature decided to make the hate crime enhancement a \u201csentencing factor,\u201d rather than an element of an underlying offense \u2014 and that decision was within the State\u2019s established power to define the elements of its crimes. The hate crime statute did not create a presumption of guilt, the court determined, and did not appear \u201c\u2018tailored to permit the... finding to be a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense.\u2019\u201d 304 N. J. Super., at 154, 698 A. 2d, at 1269 (quoting McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88). Characterizing the required finding as one of \u201cmotive,\u201d the court described it as a traditional \u201csentencing factor,\u201d one not considered an \u201cessential element\u201d of any crime unless the legislature so provides. 304 N. J. Super., at 158, 698 A. 2d, at 1270. While recognizing that the hate crime law did expose defendants to \u201c \u2018greater and additional punishment/ \u201d id., at 156,698 A. 2d, at 1269 (citing McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88), the court held that that \u201cone factor standing alone\u201d was not sufficient to render the statute unconstitutional, 304 N. J. Super., at 156, 698 A. 2d, at 1269.\nA divided New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed. 159 N. J. 7, 731 A. 2d 485 (1999). The court began by explaining that while due process only requires the State to prove the \u201celements\u201d of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, the mere fact that a state legislature has placed a criminal component \u201cwithin the sentencing provisions\u201d of the criminal code \u201cdoes not mean that the finding of a biased purpose to intimidate is not an essential element of the offense.\u201d Id., at 20, 731 A. 2d, at 492. \u201cWere that the ease,\u201d the court continued, \u201cthe Legislature could just as easily allow judges, not juries, to determine if a kidnapping victim has been released unharmed.\u201d Ibid, (citing state precedent requiring sueh a finding to be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt). Neither could the constitutional question be settled simply by defining the hate crime statute\u2019s \u201cpurpose to intimidate\u201d as \u201cmotive\u201d and thereby excluding the provision from any traditional conception of an \u201celement\u201d of a crime. Even if one could characterize the language this way \u2014 and the court doubted that sueh a characterization was accurate \u2014 proof of motive did not ordinarily \u201cincrease the penal consequences to an actor.\u201d Ibid. Sueh \u201c[ljabels,\u201d the court concluded, would not yield an answer to Apprendi\u2019s constitutional question. Ibid.\nWhile noting that we had just last year expressed serious doubt concerning the constitutionality of allowing penalty- \u2022 enhancing findings to be determined by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence, Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227 (1999), the court concluded that those doubts were not essential to our holding. Turning then, as the appeals court had, to McMillan, as well as to Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), the court undertook a multifaetor inquiry and then held that the hate crime provision was valid. In the majority\u2019s view, the statute did not allow impermissible burden shifting, and did not \u201ccreate a separate offense calling for a separate penalty.\u201d 159 N. J., at 24, 731 A. 2d, at 494. Rather, \u201cthe Legislature simply took one factor that has always been considered by sentencing courts to bear on punishment and dictated the weight to be given that factor.\u201d Ibid., 731 A. 2d, at 494-495. As had the appeals court, the majority recognized that the state statute was unlike that in McMillan inasmuch as it increased the maximum penalty to which a defendant could be subject. But it was not clear that this difference alone would \u201cchange the constitutional calculus,\u201d especially where, as here, \u201cthere is rarely any doubt whether the defendants committed the crimes with the purpose of intimidating the victim on the basis of race or ethnicity.\u201d 159 N. J., at 24-25, 731 A. 2d, at 495. Moreover, in light of concerns \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d to hate crime statutes drawn carefully to avoid \u201cpunishing thought itself,\u201d the enhancement served as an appropriate balance between those concerns and the State\u2019s compelling interest in vindicating the right \u201cto be free of invidious discrimination.\u201d Id., at 25-26,731 A. 2d, at 495.\nThe dissent rejected this conclusion, believing instead that the case turned on two critical characteristics: (1) \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s mental state in committing the subject offense ... necessarily involves a finding so integral to the charged offense that it must be characterized as an element thereof\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe significantly increased sentencing range triggered by . . . the finding of a purpose to intimidate\u201d means that the purpose \u201cmust be treated as a material element [that] must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at 30, 731 A. 2d, at 498. In the dissent\u2019s view, the facts increasing sentences in both Almendarez-Torres (recidivism) and Jones (serious bodily injury) were quite distinct from New Jersey\u2019s required finding of purpose here; the latter finding turns directly on the conduct of the defendant during the crime and defines a level of culpability necessary to form the hate crime offense. While acknowledging \u201canalytical tensions\u201d in this Court\u2019s post-Winship jurisprudence, the dissenters concluded that \u201cthere can be little doubt that the sentencing factor applied to this defendant \u2014 the purpose to intimidate a victim because of race \u2014 must fairly be regarded as an element of the crime requiring inclusion in the indictment and proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 159 N. J., at 51, 731 A. 2d, at 512.\nWe granted certiorari, 528 U. S. 1018 (1999), and now reverse.\nII\nIt is appropriate to begin by explaining why certain aspects of the case are not relevant to the narrow issue that we must resolve. First, the State has argued that even without the trial judge\u2019s finding of racial bias, the judge could have imposed consecutive sentences on counts 3 and 18 that would have produced the 12-year term of imprisonment that Apprendi received; Apprendi\u2019s actual sentence was thus within the range authorized by statute for the three offenses to which he pleaded guilty. Brief for Respondent 4. The constitutional question, however, is whether the 12-year sentence imposed on count 18 was permissible, given that it was above the 10-year maximum for the offense charged in that count. The finding is legally significant because it increased \u2014 indeed, it doubled \u2014 the maximum range within which the judge could exercise his discretion, converting what otherwise was a maximum 10-year sentence on that count into a minimum sentence. The sentences on counts 3 and 22 have no more relevance to our disposition than the dismissal of the remaining 18 counts.\nSecond, although the constitutionality of basing an enhanced sentence on racial bias was argued in the New Jersey courts, that issue was not raised here. The substantive basis for New Jersey\u2019s enhancement is thus not at issue; the adequacy of New Jersey\u2019s procedure is. The strength of the state interests that are served by the hate crime legislation has no more bearing on this procedural question than the strength of the interests served by other provisions of the criminal code.\nThird, we reject the suggestion by the State Supreme Court that \u201cthere is rarely any doubt\u201d concerning the existence of the biased purpose that will support an enhanced sentence, 159 N. J., at 25, 731 A. 2d, at 495. In this very case, that issue was the subject of the full evidentiary hearing we described. We assume that both the purpose of the offender, and even the known identity of the victim, will sometimes be hotly disputed, and that the outcome may well depend in some cases on the standard of proof and the identity of the factfinder.\nFourth, because there is no ambiguity in New Jersey\u2019s statutory scheme, this case does not raise any question concerning the State\u2019s power to manipulate the prosecutor\u2019s burden of proof by, for example, relying on a presumption rather than evidence to establish an element of an offense, cf. Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975); Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510 (1979), or by placing the affirmative defense label on \u201cat least some elements\u201d of traditional crimes, Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977). The prosecutor did not invoke any presumption to buttress the evidence of racial bias and did not claim that Apprendi had the burden of disproving an improper motive. The question whether Apprendi had a constitutional right to have a jury find such bias on the basis of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is starkly presented.\nOur answer to that question was foreshadowed by our opinion in Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227 (1999), construing a federal statute. We there noted that \u201cunder the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at 248, n. 6. The Fourteenth Amendment commands the same answer in this ease involving a state statute.\nIII\nIn his 1881 lecture on the criminal law, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., observed: \u201cThe law threatens certain pains if you do certain things, intending thereby to give you a new motive for not doing them. If you persist in doing them, it has to inflict the pains in order that its threats may continue to be believed.\u201d New Jersey threatened Apprendi with certain pains if he unlawfully possessed a weapon and \u25a0with additional pains if he selected his victims with a purpose to intimidate them because of their race. As a matter of simple justice, it seems obvious that the procedural safeguards designed to protect Apprendi from unwarranted pains should apply equally to the two acts that New Jersey has singled out for punishment. Merely using the label \u201csentence enhancement\u201d to describe the latter surely does not provide a principled basis for treating them differently.\nAt stake in this case are constitutional protections of surpassing importance: the proscription of any deprivation of liberty without \u201cdue process of law,\u201d Arndt. 14, and the guarantee that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury,\u201d Amdt. 6. Taken together, these rights indisputably entitle a criminal defendant to \"a jury determination that [he] is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 510 (1995); see also Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275,278 (1993); Winship, 397 U. S., at 364 (\u201c[T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged\u201d).\nAs we have, unanimously, explained, Gaudin, 515 U. S., at 510-511, the historical foundation for our recognition of these principles extends down centuries into the common law. \u201c[T]o guard against a spirit of oppression and tyranny on the part of rulers,\u201d and \u201cas the great bulwark of [our] civil and political liberties,\u201d 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 540-541 (4th ed. 1873), trial by jury has been understood to require that \u201cthe truth of every accusation, whether preferred in the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of [the defendant\u2019s) equals and neighbours . . . .\u201d 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 343 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone) (emphasis added). See also Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 151-154 (1968).\nEqually well founded is the companion right to have the jury verdict based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cThe \u2018demand for a higher degree of persuasion in criminal cases was recurrently expressed from ancient times, [though] its crystallization into the formula \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d seems to have occurred as late as 1798. It is now accepted in common law jurisdictions as the measure of persuasion by which the prosecution must convince the trier of all the essential elements of guilt.\u2019 C. McCormick, Evidence \u00a7321, pp. 681-682 (1954); see also 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2497 (3d ed. 1940).\u201d Winship, 397 U. S., at 361. We went on to explain that the reliance on the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard among common-law jurisdictions \u201c \u2018reflects] a profound judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 361-362 (quoting Duncan, 391 U. S., at 155).\nAny possible distinction between an \u201celement\u201d of a felony offense and a \u201csentencing factor\u201d was unknown to the practice of criminal indictment, trial by jury, and judgment by court as it existed during the years surrounding our Nation\u2019s founding. As a general rule, criminal proceedings were submitted to a jury after being initiated by an indictment containing \u201call the facts and circumstances which constitute the offence, . . . stated with such certainty and precision, that the defendant. . . may be enabled to determine the species of offence they constitute, in order that he may prepare his defence accordingly ... and that there may be no doubt as to the judgment which should be given, if the defendant be convicted.\u201d J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases 44 (15th ed. 1862) (emphasis added). The defendant\u2019s ability to predict with certainty the judgment from the face of the felony indictment flowed from the invariable linkage of punishment with crime. See 4 Blaek-stone 369-370 (after verdict, and barring a defect in the indictment, pardon, or benefit of clergy, \u201cthe court must 'pronounce that judgment, which the law hath annexed to the crime\u201d (emphasis added)).\nThus, with respect to the criminal law of felonious conduct, \u201cthe English trial judge of the later eighteenth century had very little explicit discretion in sentencing. The substantive criminal law tended to be sanction-specific; it prescribed a particular sentence for each offense. The judge was meant simply to impose that sentence (unless he thought in the circumstances that the sentence was so inappropriate that he should invoke the pardon process to commute it).\u201d Lang-bein, The English Criminal Trial Jury on the Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in England, France, Germany 1700-1900, pp. 36-37 (A. Schioppa ed. 1987). As Blaekstone, among many others, has made clear, \u201c[t]he judgment, though pronounced or awarded by the judges, is not their determination or sentence, but the determination and sentence of the law.\u201d 3 Blaekstone 396 (emphasis deleted).\nThis practice at common law held true when indictments were issued pursuant to statute. Just as the circumstances of the crime and the intent of the defendant at the time of commission were often essential elements to be alleged in the indictment, so too were the circumstances mandating a particular punishment. \u201cWhere a statute annexes a higher degree of punishment to a common-law felony, if committed under particular circumstances, an indictment for the of-fenee, in order to bring the defendant within that higher degree of punishment, must expressly charge it to have been committed under those circumstances, and must state the circumstances with certainty and precision. [2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown *170].\u201d Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases, at 51. If, then, \u201cupon an indictment under the statute, the prosecutor prove the felony to have been committed, but fail in proving it to have been committed under the circumstances specified in the statute, the defendant shall be convicted of the common-law felony only.\u201d Id., at 188.\nWe should be clear that nothing in this history suggests that it is impermissible for judges to exercise discretion\u2014 taking into consideration various factors relating both to offense and offender \u2014 in imposing a judgment within the range prescribed by statute. We have often noted that judges in this country have long exercised discretion of this nature in imposing sentence within statutory limits in the individual case. See, e. g., Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246 (1949) (\u201c[Bjoth before and since the American colonies became a nation, courts in this country and in England practiced a policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law\u201d (emphasis added)). As in Williams, our periodic recognition of judges\u2019 broad discretion in sentencing \u2014 since the 19th-century shift in this country from statutes providing fixed-term sentences to those providing judges discretion within a permissible range, Note, The Admissibility of Character Evidence in Determining Sentence, 9 U. Chi. L. Rev. 715 (1942) \u2014 has been regularly accompanied by the qualification that that discretion was bound by the range of sentencing options prescribed by the legislature. See, e.g., United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 447 (1972) (agreeing that \u201c[tjhe Government is also on solid ground in asserting that a sentence imposed by a federal district judge, if within statutory limits, is generally not subject to review\u201d (emphasis added)); Williams, 337 U. S., at 246, 247 (explaining that, in contrast to the guilt stage of trial, the judge\u2019s task in sentencing is to determine, \u201cwithin fixed statutory or constitutional limits[,] the type and extent of punishment after the issue of guilt\u201d has been resolved).\nThe historic link between verdict and judgment and the consistent limitation on judges\u2019 discretion to operate within the limits of the legal penalties provided highlight the novelty of a legislative scheme that removes the jury from the determination of a fact that, if found, exposes the criminal defendant to a penalty exceeding the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone.\nWe do not suggest that trial practices cannot change in the course of centuries and still remain true to the principles that emerged from the Framers\u2019 fears \u201cthat the jury right could be lost not only by gross denial, but by erosion.\u201d Jones, 526 U. S., at 247-248. But practice must at least adhere to the basic principles undergirding the requirements of trying to a jury all facts necessary to constitute a statutory offense, and proving those facts beyond reasonable doubt. As we made clear in Winship, the \"reasonable doubt\u201d requirement \u201chas [a] vital role in our criminal procedure for cogent reasons.\u201d 397 U. S., at 363. Prosecution subjects the criminal defendant both to \u201cthe possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and... the certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction.\u201d Ibid. We thus require this, among other, procedural protections in order to \u201cprovid[e] concrete substance for the presumption of innocence,\u201d and to reduce the risk of imposing such deprivations erroneously. Ibid. If a defendant faces punishment beyond that provided by statute when an offense is committed under certain circumstances but not others, it is obvious that both the loss of liberty and the stigma attaching to the offense are heightened; it necessarily follows that the defendant should not \u2014 at the moment the State is put to proof of those circumstances \u2014 be deprived of protections that have, until that point, unquestionably attached.\nSince Winship, we have made clear beyond peradventure that Winship\u2019s due process and associated jury protections extend, to some degree, \u201cto determinations that [go] not to a defendant\u2019s guilt or innoeenee, but simply to the length of his sentence.\u201d Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 251 (Scalia, J., dissenting). This was a primary lesson of Mullaney. v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975), in which we invalidated a Maine statute that presumed that a defendant who acted with an intent to kill possessed the \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d necessary to constitute the State\u2019s murder offense (and therefore, was subject to that crime\u2019s associated punishment of life imprisonment). The statute placed the burden on the defendant of proving, in rebutting the statutory presumption, that he acted with a lesser degree of culpability, such as in the heat of passion, to win a reduction in the offense from murder to manslaughter (and thus a reduction of the maximum punishment of 20 years).\nThe State had posited in Mullaney that requiring a defendant to prove heat-of-passion intent to overcome a presumption of murderous intent did not implicate Winship protections because, upon conviction of either offense, the defendant would lose his liberty and face societal stigma just the same. Rejecting this argument, we acknowledged that criminal law \u201cis concerned not only with guilt or innocence in the abstract, but also with the degree of criminal culpability\u201d assessed. 421 U. S., at 697-698. Because the \u201cconsequences\u201d of a guilty verdict for murder and for manslaughter differed substantially, we dismissed the possibility that a State could circumvent the protections of Winship merely by \u201credefining] the elements that constitute different crimes, characterizing them as factors that bear solely on the extent of punishment.\u201d 421 U. S., at 698.\nIV\nIt was in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), that this Court, for the first time, coined the term \u201csentencing factor\u201d to refer to a fact that was not found by a jury but that could affect the sentence imposed by the judge. That case involved a challenge to the State\u2019s Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a79712 (1982). According to its provisions, anyone convicted of certain felonies would be subject to a mandatory minimum penalty of five years\u2019 imprisonment if the judge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person \u201cvisibly possessed a firearm\u201d in the course of committing one of the specified felonies. 477 U. S., at 81-82. Articulating for the first time, and then applying, a multifaetor set of criteria for determining whether the Winskip protections applied to bar such a system, we concluded that the Pennsylvania statute did not run afoul of our previous admonitions against relieving the State of its burden of proving guilt, or tailoring the mere form of a criminal statute solely to avoid Winship\u2019s strictures. 477 U. S., at 86-88.\nWe did not, however, there budge from the position that (1) constitutional limits exist to States\u2019 authority to define away facts necessary to constitute a criminal offense, id., at 85-88, and (2) that a state scheme that keeps from the jury facts that \u201cexpos[e] [defendants] to greater or additional punishment,\u201d id., at 88, may raise serious constitutional concern. As we explained:\n\u201cSection 9712 neither alters the maximum penalty for the crime committed nor creates a separate offense calling for a separate penalty; it operates solely to limit the sentencing court\u2019s discretion in selecting a penalty within the range already available to it without the special finding of visible possession of a firearm. . . . The statute gives no impression of having been tailored to permit the visible possession finding to be a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense. Petitioners\u2019 claim that visible possession under the Pennsylvania statute is \u2018really an element of the offenses for which they are being punished- \u2014 that Pennsylvania has in effect defined a new set of upgraded felonies \u2014 would have at least more superficial appeal if a finding of visible possession exposed them to greater or additional punishment, ef 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2113(d) (providing separate and greater punishment for bank robberies accomplished through \u2018use of a dangerous weapon or device\u2019), but it does not.\u201d Id., at 87-88.\nFinally, as we made plain in Jones last Term, Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), represents at best an exceptional departure from the historic practice that we have described. In that case, we considered a federal grand jury indictment, which charged the petitioner with \u201chaving been \u2018found in the United States . . . after being deported,\u2019\u201d in violation of 8 U.S.G. \u00a7 1326(a) \u2014 an offense carrying a maximum sentence of two years. 523 U. S., at 227. Almendarez-Torres pleaded guilty to the indictment, admitting at the plea hearing that he had been deported, that he had unlawfully reentered this country, and that \u201cthe earlier deportation had taken place \u2018pursuant to\u2019 three earlier \u2018convictions\u2019 for aggravated felonies.\u201d Ibid. The Government then filed a presentenee report indicating that Almendarez-Torres\u2019 offense fell within the bounds of \u00a7 1326(b) because, as specified in that provision, his original deportation had been subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction; accordingly, Almendarez-Torres could be subject to a sentence of up to 20 years. Almendarez-Torres objected, contending that because the indictment \u201chad not mentioned his- earlier aggravated felony convictions,\u201d he could be sentenced to no more than two years in prison. Ibid.\nRejecting Almendarez-Torres\u2019 objection, we concluded that sentencing him to a term higher than that attached to the offense alleged in the indictment did not violate the strictures of Winship in that case. Because Almendarez-Torres had admitted the three earlier convictions for aggravated felonies \u2014 all of which had been entered pursuant to proceedings with substantial procedural safeguards of their own\u2014 no question concerning the right to a jury trial or the standard of proof that would apply to a contested issue of fact was before the Court. Although our conclusion in that ease was based in part on our application of the criteria we had invoked in McMillan, the specific question decided concerned the sufficiency of the indictment. More important, as Jones made crystal clear, 526 U. S., at 248-249, our conclusion in Almendarez-Torres turned heavily upon the fact that the additional sentence to which the defendant was subject was \u201cthe prior commission of a serious crime.\u201d 523 U. S., at 230; see also id., at 243 (explaining that \u201crecidivism ... is a traditional, if not the most traditional, basis for a sentencing court\u2019s increasing an offender\u2019s sentence\u201d); id., at 244 (emphasizing \u201cthe fact that recidivism \u2018does not relate to the commission of the offense...\u2019\u201d); Jones, 526 U. S., at 249-250, n. 10 (\u201cThe majority and the dissenters in Almendarez-Torres disagreed over the legitimacy of the Court\u2019s decision to restrict its holding to recidivism, but both sides agreed that the Court had done just that\u201d). Both the certainty that procedural safeguards attached to any \u201cfact\u201d of prior conviction, and the reality that Almendarez-Torres did not challenge the accuracy of that \u201cfact\u201d in his case, mitigated the due process and Sixth Amendment concerns otherwise implicated in allowing a judge to determine a \u201cfact\u201d increasing punishment beyond the maximum of the statutory range.\nEven though it is arguable that Almendarez-Torres was incorrectly decided, and that a logical application of our reasoning today should apply if the recidivist issue were contested, Apprendi does not contest the decision\u2019s validity and we need not revisit it for purposes of our decision today to treat the case as a narrow exception to the general rule we recalled at the outset. Given its unique facts, it surely does not warrant rejection of the otherwise uniform course of decision during the entire history of our jurisprudence.\nIn sum, our reexamination of our cases in this area, and of the history upon which they rely, confirms the opinion that we expressed in Jones. Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. With that exception, we endorse the statement of the rule set forth in the concurring opinions in that ease: \u201c[I]t is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed. It is equally clear that such facts must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 526 U. S., at 252-253 (opinion of Stevens, J.); see also id., at 253 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\nV\nThe New Jersey statutory scheme that Apprendi asks us to invalidate allows a jury to convict a defendant of a second-degree offense based on its finding beyond a reasonable doubt that he unlawfully possessed a prohibited weapon; after a subsequent and separate proceeding, it then allows a judge to. impose punishment identical to that New Jersey provides for crimes of the first degree, N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:48 \u2014 6(a)(1) (West 1999), based upon the judge\u2019s finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d for unlawfully possessing the weapon was \u201cto intimidate\u201d his victim on the basis of a particular characteristic the victim possessed. In light of the constitutional rule explained above, and all of the eases supporting it, this practice cannot stand.\nNew Jersey\u2019s defense of its hate crime enhancement statute has three primary components: (1) The required finding of biased purpose is not an \u201celement\u201d of a distinct hate crime offense, but rather the traditional \u201csentencing factor\u201d of motive; (2) McMillan holds that the legislature can authorize a judge to find a traditional sentencing factor on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence; and (3) Almendarez-Torres extended McMillan\u2019s holding to encompass factors that authorize a judge to impose a sentence beyond the maximum provided by the substantive statute under which a defendant is charged. None of these persuades us that the constitutional rule that emerges from our history and case law should incorporate an exception for this New Jersey statute.\nNew Jersey\u2019s first point is nothing more than a disagreement with the rule we apply today. Beyond this, we do not see how the argument can succeed on its own terms. The state high court evinced substantial skepticism at the suggestion that the hate crime statute\u2019s \u201cpurpose to intimidate\u201d was simply an inquiry into \u201cmotive.\u201d We share that skepticism. The text of the statute requires the factfinder to determine whether the defendant possessed, at the time he committed the subject act, a \u201cpurpose to intimidate\u201d on account of, inter alia, race. By its very terms, this statute mandates an examination of the defendant\u2019s state of mind\u2014 a concept known well to the criminal law as the defendant\u2019s mens rea. It makes no difference in identifying the nature of this finding that Apprendi was also required, in order to receive the sentence he did for weapons possession, to have possessed the weapon with a \u201cpurpose to use [the weapon] unlawfully against the person or property of another,\u201d \u00a72C:39-4(a). A second mens rea requirement hardly defeats the reality that the enhancement statute imposes of its own force an intent requirement necessary for the imposition of sentence. On the contrary, the fact that the language and structure of the \u201cpurpose to use\u201d criminal offense is identical in relevant respects to the language and structure of the \u201cpurpose to intimidate\u201d provision demonstrates to us that it is precisely a particular criminal mens rea that the hate crime enhancement statute seeks to target. The defendant\u2019s intent in committing a crime is perhaps as close as one might hope to come to a core criminal offense \u201celement.\u201d\nThe foregoing notwithstanding, however, the New Jersey-Supreme Court correctly recognized that it does not matter whether the required finding is characterized as one of intent or of motive, because \u201c[l]abels do not afford an acceptable answer.\u201d 159 N. J., at 20, 731 A. 2d, at 492. That point, applies as well to the constitutionally novel and elusive distinction between \u201celements\u201d and \u201csentencing factors.\u201d McMillan, 477 U. S., at 86 (noting that the sentencing factor \u2014 visible possession of a firearm \u2014 \u201cmight well have been included as an element of the enumerated offenses\u201d). Despite what appears to us the clear \u201celemental\u201d nature of the factor here, the relevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect \u2014 does the required finding expose the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict?\nAs the New Jersey Supreme Court itself understood in rejecting the argument that the required \u201cmotive\u201d finding was simply a \u201ctraditional\u201d sentencing factor, proof of motive did not ordinarily \u201cincrease the penal consequences to an actor.\u201d 159 N. J., at 20, 731 A. 2d, at 492. Indeed, the effect of New Jersey\u2019s sentencing \u201cenhancement\u201d here is unquestionably to turn a second-degree offense into a first-degree offense, under the State\u2019s own criminal code. The law thus runs directly into our warning in Mullaney that Winship is concerned as much with the category of substantive offense as \u201cwith the degree of criminal culpability\u201d assessed. 421 U. S., at 698. This concern flows not only from the historical pedigree of the jury and burden rights, but also from the powerful interests those rights serve. The degree of criminal culpability the legislature chooses to associate with particular, factually distinct conduct has significant implications both for a defendant\u2019s very liberty, and for the heightened stigma associated with an offense the legislature has selected as worthy of greater punishment.\nThe preceding discussion should make clear why the State\u2019s reliance on McMillan is likewise misplaced. The differential in sentence between what Apprendi would have received without the finding of biased purpose and what he could receive with it is not, it is true, as extreme as the difference between a small fine and mandatory life imprisonment. Mullaney, 421 U. S., at 700. But it can hardly be said that the potential doubling of one\u2019s sentence \u2014 from 10 years to 20 \u2014 has no more than a nominal effect. Both in terms of absolute years behind bars, and because of the more severe stigma attached, the differential here is unquestionably of constitutional significance. When a judge\u2019s finding based on a mere preponderance of the evidence authorizes an increase in the maximum punishment, it is appropriately characterized as \u201ca tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense.\u201d McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88.\nNew Jersey would also point to the fact that the State did not, in placing the required biased purpose finding in a sentencing enhancement provision, create a \u201cseparate offense calling for a separate penalty.\u201d Ibid. As for this, we agree wholeheartedly with the New Jersey Supreme Court that merely because the state legislature placed its hate crime sentence \u201cenhancer\u201d \u201cwithin the sentencing provisions\u201d of the criminal code \u201cdoes not mean that the finding of a biased purpose to intimidate is not an essential element of the offense.\u201d 159 N. J., at 20, 731 A. 2d, at 492. Indeed, the fact that New Jersey, along with numerous other States, has also made precisely the same conduct the subject of an independent substantive offense makes it clear that the mere presence of this \u201cenhancement\u201d in a sentencing statute does not define its character.\nNew Jersey\u2019s reliance on Almendarez-Torres is also unavailing. The reasons supporting an exception from the general rule for the statute construed in that case do not apply to the New Jersey statute. Whereas recidivism \u201cdoes not relate to the commission of the offense\u201d itself, 523 U. S., at 230, 244, New Jersey\u2019s biased purpose inquiry goes precisely to what happened in the \u201ccommission of the offense.\u201d Moreover, there is a vast difference between accepting the validity of a prior judgment of conviction entered in a proceeding in which the defendant had the right to a jury trial and the right to require the prosecutor to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and allowing the judge to find the required fact under a lesser standard of proof.\nFinally, this Court has previously considered and rejected the argument that the principles guiding our decision today render invalid state capital sentencing schemes requiring judges, after a jury verdict holding a defendant guilty of a capital crime, to find specific aggravating factors before imposing a sentence of death. Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 647-649 (1990); id., at 709-714 (Stevens, J., dissenting). For reasons we have explained, the capital eases are not controlling:\n\u201cNeither the cases cited, nor any other case, permits a judge to determine the existence of a factor which makes a crime a capital offense. What the cited eases hold is that, once a jury has found the defendant guilty of all the elements of an offense which carries as its maximum penalty the sentence of death, it may be left to the judge to decide whether that maximum penalty, rather than a lesser one, ought to be imposed .... The person who is charged with actions that expose him to the death penalty has an absolute entitlement to jury trial on all the elements of the charge.\u201d Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 257, n. 2 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted).\nSee also Jones, 526 U. S., at 250-251; post, at 520-522 (Thomas, J., concurring).\n* * *\nThe New Jersey procedure challenged in this ease is an unacceptable departure from the jury tradition that is an indispensable part of our criminal justice system. Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey is reversed, and the ease is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nWe have previously rejected a First Amendment challenge to an enhanced sentence based on a jury finding that the defendant had intentionally selected his victim because of the victim\u2019s race. Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U. S. 476, 480 (1993).\n0. Holmes, The Common Law 40 (M. Howe ed. 1963).\nApprendi has not here asserted a constitutional claim based on the omission of any reference to sentence enhancement or racial bias in the indictment. He relies entirely on the fact that the \u201cdue process of law\u201d that the Fourteenth Amendment requires the States to provide to persons accused of crime encompasses the right to a trial by jury, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968), and the right to have every element of the offense proved beyond a reasonable doubt, In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970). That Amendment has not, however, been construed to include the Fifth Amendment right to \u201cpresentment or indictment of a Grand Jury\u201d that was implicated in our recent decision in Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998). We thus do not address the indictment question separately today.\n\u201c[A]fter trial and conviction are past,\u201d the defendant is submitted to \u201cjudgment\u201d by the court, 4 Blackstone \u00bf68 \u2014 the stage approximating in modern terms the imposition of sentence.\nAs we suggested in Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227 (1999), juries devised extralegal ways of avoiding a guilty verdict, at least of the more severe form of the offense alleged, if the punishment associated with the offense seemed to them disproportionate to the seriousness of the conduct of the particular defendant. Id., at 245 (\u201cThis power to thwart Parliament and Crown took the form not only of flat-out acquittals in the face of guilt but of what today we would call verdicts of guilty to lesser included offenses, manifestations of what Blaekstone described as \u2018pious perjury\u2019 on the jurors\u2019 part. 4 Blaekstone 238-239\u201d).\nAs the principal dissent would chide us for this single citation to Blackstone\u2019s third volume, rather than his fourth, post, at 525-526 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.), we suggest that Blaekstone himself directs us to it for these purposes. See 4 Blaekstone 343 (\u201cThe antiquity and excellence of this [jury] trial, for the settling of civil property, has before been explained at large\u201d). See 3 id., at 379 (\u201cUpon these accounts the trial by jury ever has been, and I trust ever will be, looked upon as the glory of the English law. And, if it has so great an advantage over others in regulating civil property, how much must that advantage be heightened, when it is applied to criminal cases!\u201d); 4 id., at 343 (\"And it will hold much stronger in criminal cases; since, in times of difficulty and danger, more is to be apprehended from the violence and partiality of judges appointed by the crown, in suits between the king and the subject, than in disputes between one individual and another, to settle the metes and boundaries of private property\u201d); 4 id., at 344 (\u201cWhat was said of juries in general, and the trial thereby, in civil eases, will greatly shorten our present remarks, with regard to the trial of criminal suits; indictments, informations, and appeals\u201d).\nThe common law of punishment for misdemeanors \u2014 those \u201csmaller faults, and omissions of less consequence,\u201d 4 id., at 5 \u2014 was, as we noted in Jones, 526 U. S., at 244, substantially more dependent upon judicial discretion. Subject to the limitations that the punishment not \u201ctouch life or limb,\u201d that it be proportionate to the offense, and, by the 17th century, that it not be \u201ccruel or unusual,\u201d judges most commonly imposed discretionary \u201csentences\u201d of fines or whippings upon misdemeanants. J. Baker, Introduction to English Legal History 584 (3d ed. 1990). Actual sentences of imprisonment for such offenses, however, were rare at common law until the late 18th century, ibid., for \u201cthe idea of prison as a punishment would have seemed an absurd expense,\u201d Baker, Criminal Courts and Procedure at Common Law 1550-1800, in Crime in England 1550-1800, p. 43 (J. Cock-burn ed. 1977).\nTo the extent the principal dissent appears to take issue with our reliance on Archbold (among others) as an authoritative source on the common law of the relevant period, post, at 525, 526, we simply note that Archbold has been dted by numerous opinions of this Court for that very purpose, his Criminal Pleading treatise being generally viewed as \u201can essential reference book for every criminal lawyer working in the Crown Court.\u201d Biographical Dictionary of the Common Law 13 (A. Simpson ed. 1984); see also Holdsworth, The Literature of the Common Law, in 13 A History of English Law 464-465 (A. Goodhart & H. Hanbury eds. 1952).\nSee also 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Law \u00a7\u00a7933-984(1) (9th ed. 1923) (\u201cWith us legislation ordinarily fixes the penalties for the common law offences equally with the statutory ones. . . . Under the common-law procedure, the court determines in each case what within the limits of the law shall be the punishment, \u2014 the question being one of discretion\u201d (emphasis added)); id., \u00a7 948 (\u201c[I]f the law has given the court a discretion as to the punishment, it will look in pronouncing sentence into any evidence proper to influence a judicious magistrate to make it heavier or lighter, yet not to exceed the limits fixed for what of crime is -within the allegation and the verdict. Or this sort of evidence may be placed before the jury at the trial, if it has the power to assess the punishment. But in such a case the aggravating matter must not be of a crime separate from the one charged in the indictment, \u2014 a rule not applicable where a delinquent offence under an habitual criminal act is involved\u201d (footnotes omitted)).\nThe principal dissent\u2019s discussion of Williams, post, at 545-546,547, fails to acknowledge the significance of the Court\u2019s caveat that judges\u2019 discretion is constrained by the \u201climits fixed by law.\u201d Nothing in Williams implies that a judge may impose a more severe sentence than the maximum authorized by the facts found by the jury. Indeed, the commentators cited in the dissent recognize precisely this same limitation. See post, at 544-545 (quoting K. Stith & J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 9 (1998) (\u201cFrom the beginning of the Republic, federal judges were entrusted with wide sentencing discretion ..., permitting the sentencing judge to impose any term of imprisonment and any fine up to the statutory maximum!\u2019 (emphasis added)); Lynch, Towards A Model Penal Code, Second (Federal?), 2 Buffalo Crim. L. Rev. 297,320 (1998) (noting that judges in discretionary sentencing took account of facts relevant to a particular offense \u201cwithin the spectrum of conduct covered by the statute of conviction\u201d)).\nIn support of its novel view that this Court has \u201clong recognized\u201d that not all facts affecting punishment need go to the jury, post, at 524, the principal dissent cites three cases decided within the past quarter century; and each of these is plainly distinguishable. Rather than offer any historical account of its own that would support the notion of a \u201csentencing factor\u201d legally increasing punishment beyond the statutory maximum \u2014 and Justice Thomas\u2019 concurring opinion in this case makes clear that such an exercise would be futile \u2014 the dissent proceeds by mischaracterizing our account. The evidence we describe that punishment was, by law, tied to the offense (enabling the defendant to discern, barring pardon or clergy, his punishment from the face of the indictment), and the evidence that American judges have exercised sentencing discretion within a legally prescribed range (enabling the defendant to discern from the statute of indictment what maximum punishment conviction under that statute could bring), point to a single, consistent conclusion: The judge\u2019s role in sentencing is constrained at its outer limits by the facts alleged in the indictment and found by the jury. Put simply, facts that expose a defendant to a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed were by definition \u201celements\u201d of a separate legal offense.\nAs we stated in Jones: \"One contributor to the ratification debates, for example, commenting on the jury trial guarantee in Art. Ill, \u00a72, echoed Blackstone in warning of the need \u2018to guard with the most jealous circumspection against the introduction of new, and arbitrary methods of trial, which, under a variety of plausible pretenses, may in time, imperceptibly undermine this best preservative of LIBERTY.\u2019 A [New Hampshire] Farmer, No. 3, June 6, 1788, quoted in The Complete Bill of Rights 477 (N. Cogan ed. 1997).\u201d 526 U. S., at 248.\nContrary to the principal dissent\u2019s suggestion, post, at 580-532, Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 198 (1977), posed no direct challenge to this aspect of Mullaney. In upholding a New York law allowing defendants to raise and prove extreme emotional distress as an affirmative defense to murder, Patterson made clear that the state law still required the State to prove every element of that State\u2019s offense of murder and its accompanying punishment. \u201cNo further facts are either presumed or inferred in order to constitute the crime.\u201d 432 U. S., at 205-206. New York, unlike Maine, had not made malice aforethought, or any described mens rea, part of its statutory definition of second-degree murder; one could tell from the face of the statute that if one intended to cause the death of another person and did cause that death, one could be subject to sentence for a second-degree offense. Id., at 198. Responding to the argument that our view could be seen \u201cto permit state legislatures to reallocate burdens of proof by labeling as affirmative defenses at least some elements of the crimes now defined in their statutes,\u201d the Court made clear in the very next breath that there were \u201cobviously constitutional limits beyond which the States may not go in this regard.\u201d Id., at 210.\nThe principal dissent accuses us of today \u201coverruling McMillan.'\u2019 Post, at 533. We do not overrule McMillan. We limit its holding to cases that do not involve the imposition of a sentence more severe than the statutory maximum for the offense established by the jury\u2019s verdict\u2014 a limitation identified in the McMillan opinion itself Conscious of the likelihood that legislative decisions may have been made in reliance on McMillan, we reserve for another day the question whether stare decisis considerations preclude reconsideration of its narrower holding.\nThe principal dissent\u2019s contention that our decision in Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721 (1998), \u201cdemonstrates that Almendarez-Torres was\u201d something other than a limited exception to the jury trial rule is both inaccurate and misleading. Post, at 536. Monge was another recidivism case in which the question presented and the bulk of the Court\u2019s analysis related to the scope of double jeopardy protections in sentencing. The dissent extracts from that decision the majority\u2019s statement that \u201cthe Court has rejected an absolute rule that an enhancement constitutes an element of the offense any time that it increases the maximum sentence.\u201d 524 U. S., at 729. Far from being part of \u201creasoning essential\u201d to the Court\u2019s holding, post, at 536, that statement was in response to a dissent by Justice Scalia on an issue that the Court itself had, a few sentences earlier, insisted \u201cwas neither considered by the state courts nor discussed in petitioner\u2019s brief before this Court.\u201d 524 U. S., at 728. Moreover, the sole citation supporting the Monge Court\u2019s proposition that \u201cthe Court has rejected\u201d such a rule was none other than Almendarez-Torres; as we have explained, that case simply cannot bear that broad reading. Most telling of Monge\u2019s distance from the issue at stake in this ease is that the double jeopardy question in Monge arose because the State had failed to satisfy its own statutory burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that th\u00e9 defendant had committed a prior offense (and was therefore subject to an enhanced, recidivism-based sentence). 524 U.S., at 725 (\u201cAccording to California law, a number of procedural safeguards surround the assessment of prior conviction allegations: Defendants may invoke the right to a jury trial...; the prosecution must prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt; and the-rules of evidence apply\u201d). The Court thus itself warned against a contrary double jeopardy rule that could \u201ccreate disincentives that would diminish these important procedural protections.\u201d Id., at 734.\nIn addition to the reasons set forth in Justice Scalea\u2019s dissent, 523 U. S., at 248-260, it is noteworthy that the Court\u2019s extensive discussion of the term \u201csentencing factor\u201d virtually ignored the pedigree of the pleading requirement at issue. The rule was succinctly stated by Justice Clifford in his separate opinion in United, States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 232-233 (1876): \u201c[T]he indictment must contain an allegation of every fact which is legally essential to the punishment to be inflicted.\u201d As he explained in \u201c[sjpeaking of that principle, Mr. Bishop says it pervades the entire system of the adjudged law of criminal procedure, as appears by all the cases; that, wherever we move in that department of our jurisprudence, we come in contact with it; and that we can no more escape from it than from the atmosphere which surrounds us. 1 Bishop, Cr. Pro., 2d ed., sect. 81; Archbold\u2019s Crim. Plead., 15th ed., 54; 1 Stark Crim. Plead., 236; 1 Am. Cr. Law, 6th rev. ed., sect. 364; Steel v. Smith, 1 Barn. & Aid. 99.\u201d\nThe principal dissent would reject the Court\u2019s rule as a \u201cmeaningless formalism,\u201d because it can conceive of hypothetical statutes that would comply with the rule and achieve the same result as the New Jersey statute. Post, at 539-542. While a State could, hypothetically, undertake to revise its entire criminal code in the manner the dissent suggests, post, at 540 \u2014 extending all statutory maximum sentences to, for example, 50 years and giving judges guided discretion as to a few specially selected factors within that range \u2014 this possibility seems remote. Among other reasons, structural democratic constraints exist to discourage legislatures from enacting penal statutes that expose every defendant convicted of, for example, weapons possession, to a maximum sentence exceeding that which is, in the legislature\u2019s judgment, generally proportional to the crime. This is as it should be. Our rule ensures that a State is obliged \u201cto make its choices concerning the substantive content of its criminal laws with full awareness of the consequences, unable to mask substantive policy choices\u201d of exposing all who are convicted to the maximum sentence it provides. Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S., at 228-229, n. 13 (Powell, J., dissenting). So exposed, \u201c[t]he political check on potentially harsh legislative action is then more likely to operate.\u201d Ibid.\nIn all events, if such an extensive revision of the State's entire criminal code were enacted for the purpose the dissent suggests, or if New Jersey simply reversed the burden of the hate crime finding (effectively assuming a crime was performed with a purpose to intimidate and then requiring a defendant to prove that it was not, post, at 542), we would be required to question whether the revision was constitutional under this Court's prior decisions. See Patterson, 432 U. S., at 210; Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 698-702 (1975).\nFinally, the principal dissent ignores the distinction the Court has often recognized, see, e. g., Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228 (1987), between facts in aggravation of punishment and facts in mitigation. See post, at 541-542. If facts found by a jury support a guilty verdict of murder, the judge is authorized by that jury verdict to sentence the defendant to the maximum sentence provided by the murder statute. If the defendant can escape the statutory maximum by showing, for example, that he is a war veteran, then a judge that finds the fact of veteran status is neither exposing the defendant to a deprivation of liberty greater than that authorized by the verdict according to statute, nor is the judge imposing upon the defendant a greater stigma than that accompanying the jury verdict alone. Core concerns animating the jury and burden-of-proof requirements are thus absent from such a scheme.\nAmong the most common definitions of mens rea is \u201ccriminal intent.\u201d Black's Law Dictionary 1137 (rev. 4th ed. 1968). That dictionary unsurprisingly defines \u201cpurpose\u201d as synonymous with intent, id., at 1400, and \u201cintent\u201d as, among other things, \u201ca state of mind,\u201d id., at 947. But we need not venture beyond New Jersey\u2019s own criminal code for a definition of purpose that makes it central to the description of a criminal offense. As the dissenting judge on the state appeals court pointed out, according to the New Jersey Criminal Code, \u201c[a] person acts purposely with respect to the nature of his conduct or a result thereof if it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result.\u201d N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:2 \u2014 2(b)(1) (West 1999). The hate crime statute\u2019s application to those who act \u201cwith a purpose to intimidate because of\u201d certain status-based characteristics places it squarely within the inquiry whether it was a defendant\u2019s \u201cconscious object\u201d to intimidate for that reason.\nWhatever the effect of the State Supreme Court\u2019s comment that the law here targets \u201cmotive,\u201d 159 N. J. 7,20,731 A. 2d 485,492 (1999) \u2014 -and it is highly doubtful that one could characterize that comment as a \u201cbinding\u201d interpretation of the state statute, see Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U. S., at 483-484 (declining to be bound by state court\u2019s characterization of state law\u2019s \u201coperative effect\u201d), even if the court had not immediately thereafter called into direct question its \u201cability to view this finding as merely a search for motive,\u201d 159 N. J., at 21, 731 A. 2d, at 492 \u2014 a State cannot through mere characterization change the nature of the conduct actually targeted. It is as clear as day that this hate crime law defines a particular kind of prohibited intent, and a particular intent is more often than not the sine qua mn of a violation of a criminal law.\nWhen the principal dissent at long last confronts the actual statute at issue in this case in the final few pages of its opinion, it offers in response to this interpretation only that our reading is contrary to \u201csettled precedent\u201d in Mitchell. Post, at 553. Setting aside the fact that Wisconsin\u2019s hate crime statute was, in text and substance, different from New Jersey\u2019s, Mitchell did not even begin to consider whether the Wisconsin hate crime requirement was an offense \u201celement\u201d or not; it did not have to \u2014 the required finding under the Wisconsin statute was made by the jury.\nThis is not to suggest that the term \u201csentencing factor\u201d is devoid of meaning. The term appropriately describes a circumstance, which may be either aggravating or mitigating in character, that supports a specific sentence within the range authorized by the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant is guilty of a particular offense. On the other hand, when the term \u201csentence enhancement\u201d is used to describe an increase beyond the maximum authorized statutory sentence, it is the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense than the one covered by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. Indeed, it fits squarely within the usual definition of an \u201celement\u201d of the offense.

Lawrence, Punishing Hate: Bias Crimes Under American Law 178-189 (1999) (listing current state hate crime laws).\nThe principal dissent, in addition, treats us to a lengthy disquisition on the benefits of determinate sentencing schemes, and the effect of today\u2019s decision on the federal Sentencing Guidelines. Post, at 544-552. The Guidelines are, of course, not before the Court. We therefore express no view on the subject beyond what this Court has already held. See, e.g,, Edwards v. United States, 523 U.S. 511, 515 (1998) (opinion of Breyer, J., for a unanimous court) (noting that \u201c[o]f course, petitioners\u2019 statutory and constitutional claims would make a difference if it were possible to argue, say, that the sentences imposed exceeded the maximum that the statutes permit for a cocaine-only conspiracy. That is because a maximum sentence set by statute trumps a higher sentence set forth in the Guidelines. [United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a75G1.1 (Nov. 1994)]\u201d).\nSome courts read State v. Smith, 8 Rich. 460 (S. C. App. 1832), a South Carolina case, to hold that the indictment need not allege a prior conviction in order for the defendant to suffer an enhanced punishment. See, e. g., State v. Burgett, 22 Ark. 323, 324 (1860) (so reading Smith and questioning its correctness). The Smith court\u2019s holding was somewhat unclear because the court did not state whether the case involved a first or second offense \u2014 if a first, the court was undoubtedly correct in rejecting the defendant\u2019s challenge to the indictment, because there is no need in an indictment to negate the existence of any prior offense. See Bur-gett, supra, at 324 (reading indictment that was silent about prior offenses as only charging first offense and as sufficient for that purpose). In addition, the Smith court did not acknowledge the possibility of disputes over identity. Finally, the extent to which the court\u2019s apparent holding was followed in practice in South Carolina is unclear, and subsequent South Carolina decisions acknowledged that Smith was out of step with the general rule. See State v. Parris, 89 S. C. 140, 141, 71 S. E. 808, 809 (1911); State v. Mitchell, 220 S. C. 433, 434-436, 68 S. E. 2d 350, 351-352 (1951).",

        "text": "Justice Scalia,\nconcurring.\nI feel the need to say a few words in response to Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent. It sketches an admirably fair and efficient scheme of criminal justice designed for a society that is prepared to leave criminal justice to the State. (Judges, it is sometimes necessary to remind ourselves, are part of the State \u2014 and an increasingly bureaucratic part of it, at that.) The founders of the American Republic were not prepared to leave it to the State, which is why the jury-trial guarantee was one of the least controversial provisions of the Bill of Rights. It has never been efficient; but it has always been free.\nAs for fairness, which Justice Breyer believes \u201c[i]n modern times,\u201d post, at 555, the jury cannot provide: I think it not unfair to tell a prospective felon that if he commits his contemplated crime he is exposing himself to a jail sentence of 30 years \u2014 and that if, upon conviction, he gets anything less than that he may thank the mercy of a tenderhearted judge (just as he may thank the mercy of a tenderhearted parole commission if he is let out inordinately early, or the mercy of a tenderhearted governor if his sentence is commuted). Will there be disparities? Of course. But the criminal will never get more punishment than he bargained for when he did the crime, and his guilt of the crime (and hence the length of the sentence to which he is exposed) will be determined beyond a reasonable doubt by the unanimous vote of 12 of his fellow citizens:\nIn Justice Breyer\u2019s bureaucratic realm of perfect equity, by contrast, the facts that determine the length of sentence to which the defendant is exposed will be determined to exist (on a more-likely-than-not basis) by a single employee of the State. It is certainly arguable (Justice Breyer argues it) that this sacrifice of prior protections is worth it. But it is not arguable that, just because one thinks it is a better system, it must be, or is even more likely to be, the system envisioned by a Constitution-that guarantees trial by jury. What ultimately demolishes the case for the dissenters is that they are unable to say what the right to trial by jury does guarantee if, as they assert, it does not guarantee \u2014 what it has been assumed to guarantee throughout our history \u2014 the right to have a jury determine those facts that determine the maximum sentence the law allows. They provide no coherent alternative.\nJustice Breyer proceeds on the erroneous and all-too-common assumption that the Constitution means what we think it ought to mean. It does not; it means what it says. And the guarantee that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to . . . trial, by an impartial jury,\u201d has no intelligible content unless it means that all the facts which must exist in order to subject the defendant to a legally prescribed punishment must be found by the jury.",

        "text": "Justice Thomas,\nwith whom Justice Scalia joins as to Parts I and II, concurring.\nI join the opinion of the Court in full. I write separately to explain my view that the Constitution requires a broader rule than the Court adopts.\nI\nThis case turns on the seemingly simple question of what constitutes a \u201ccrime.\u201d Under the Federal Constitution, \u201cthe accused\u201d has the right (1) \u201cto be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation\u201d (that is, the basis on which he is accused of a crime), (2) to be \u201cheld to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime\u201d only on an indictment or presentment of a grand jury, and (3) to be tried by \u201can impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.\u201d Arndts. 5 and 6. See also Art. Ill, \u00a72, cl. 3 (\u201cThe Trial of all Crimes ... shall be by Jury\u201d). With the exception of the Grand Jury Clause, see Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 538 (1884), the Court has held that these protections apply in state prosecutions, Herring v. New York, 422 U. S. 853, 857, and n. 7 (1975). Further, the Court has held that due process requires that the jury find beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crime. In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970).\nAll of these constitutional protections turn on determining which facts constitute the \u201ccrime'\u2019 \u2014 that is, which facts are the \u201celements\u201d or \u201cingredients\u201d of a crime. In order for an accusation of a crime (whether by indictment or some other form) , to be proper under the common law, and thus proper under the codification of the common-law rights in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, it must allege all elements of that crime; likewise, in order for a jury trial of a crime to be proper, all elements of the crime must be proved to the jury (and, under Winship, proved beyond a reasonable doubt). See J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution \u00a7\u00a7928-929, pp. 660-662, \u00a7 934, p. 664 (1833); J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases *41, *99-*100 (hereinafter Archbold).\nThus, it is critical to know which facts are elements. This question became more complicated following the Court\u2019s decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), which spawned a special sort of fact known as a sentencing enhancement. See ante, at 478, 485, 494. Such a fact increases a defendant\u2019s punishment but is not subject to the constitutional protections to which elements are subject. Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s dissent, in agreement with McMillan and Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), takes the view that a legislature is free (within unspecified outer limits) to decree which facts are elements and which are sentencing enhancements. Post, at 524.\nSentencing enhancements may be new creatures, but the question that they create for courts is not. Courts have long had to consider which facts are elemente in order to determine the sufficiency of an accusation (usually an indictment). The answer that courts have provided regarding the accusation tells us what an element is, and it is then a simple matter to apply that answer to whatever constitutional right may be at issue in a case \u2014 here, Winship and the right to trial by jury. A long line of essentially uniform authority addressing accusations, and stretching from the earliest reported cases after the founding until well into the 20th century, establishes that the original understanding of which facts are elements was even broader than the rule that the Court adopts today.\nThis authority establishes that a \u201ccrime\u201d includes every fact that is by law a basis for imposing or increasing punishment (in contrast with a fact that mitigates punishment). Thus, if the legislature defines some core crime and then provides for increasing the punishment of that crime upon a finding of some aggravating fact \u2014 of whatever sort, including the fact of a prior conviction \u2014 the core crime and the aggravating fact together constitute an aggravated crime, just as much as grand larceny is an aggravated form of petit larceny. The aggravating fact is an element of the aggravated crime. Similarly, if the legislature, rather than creating grades of crimes, has provided for setting the punishment of a crime based on some fact \u2014 such as a fine that is proportional to the value of stolen goods \u2014 that fact is also an element. No multifactor parsing of statutes, of the sort that we have attempted since McMillan, is necessary. One need only look to the kind, degree, or range of punishment to which the prosecution is by law entitled for a given set of facte. Each fact necessary for that entitlement is an element.\nII\nA\nCases from the founding to roughly the end of the Civil War establish the rule that I have described, applying it to all sorts of facts, including recidivism. As legislatures varied common-law crimes and created new crimes, American courts, particularly from the 1840\u2019s on, readily applied to these new laws the common-law understanding that a fact that is by law the basis for imposing or increasing punishment is an element.\nMassachusetts, which produced the leading cases in the antebellum years, applied this rule as early as 1804, in Commonwealth v. Smith, 1 Mass. *245, and foreshadowed the fuller discussion that was to come. Smith was indicted for and found guilty of larceny, but the indictment failed to allege the value of all of the stolen goods. Massachusetts had abolished the common-law distinction between grand and simple larceny, replacing it with a single offense of larceny whose punishment (triple damages) was based on the value of the stolen goods. The prosecutor relied on this abolition of the traditional distinction to justify the indictment\u2019s omissions. The court, however, held that it could not sentence the defendant for the stolen goods whose value was not set out in the indictment. Id., at *246-*247.\nThe understanding implicit in Smith was explained in Hope v. Commonwealth, 50 Mass. 134 (1845). Hope was indicted for and convicted of larceny. The larceny statute at issue retained the single-offense structure of the statute addressed in Smith, and established two levels of sentencing based on whether the value of the stolen property exceeded $100. The statute was structured similarly to the statutes that we addressed in Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 230 (1999), and, even more, Castillo v. United States, ante, at 122, in that it first set out the core crime and then, in subsequent clauses, set out the ranges of punishments. Further, the statute opened by referring simply to \u201cthe of-fence of larceny,\u201d suggesting, at least from the perspective of our post-McMillan cases, that larceny was the crime whereas the value of the stolen property was merely a fact for sentencing. But the matter was quite simple for the Massachusetts high court. Value was an element because punishment varied with value:\n\u201cOur statutes, it will be remembered, prescribe the punishment for larceny, with reference to the value of the property stolen; and for this reason, as well as because it is in conformity with long established practice, the court are of opinion that the value of the property alleged to be stolen must be set forth in the indictment.\u201d 50 Mass., at 137.\nTwo years after Hope, the court elaborated on this rule in a case involving burglary, stating that if \u201ccertain acts are, by force of the statutes, made punishable with greater severity, when accompanied with aggravating circumstances,\u201d then the statute has \u201ccreat[ed] two grades of crime.\u201d Lamed v. Commonwealth, 53 Mass. 240, 242 (1847). See also id., at 241 (\u201c[Tjhere is a gradation of offences of the same species\u201d where the statute sets out \u201cvarious degrees of punishment\u201d).\nConversely, where a fact was not the basis for punishment, that fact was, for that reason, not an element. Thus, in Commonwealth v. McDonald, 59 Mass. 365 (1850), which involved an indictment for attempted larceny from the person, the court saw no error in the failure of the indictment to allege any value of the goods that the defendant had attempted to steal. The defendant, in challenging the indictment, apparently relied on Smith and Hope, and the court rejected his challenge by explaining that \u201c[a]s the p'unishment. .. does not depend on the amount stolen, there was no occasion for any allegation as to value in this indictment.\u201d 59 Mass., at 367. See Commonwealth v. Burke, 94 Mass. 182, 183 (1866) (applying same reasoning to completed larceny from the person; finding no trial error where value was not proved to jury).\nSimilar reasoning was employed by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in Lacy v. State, 15 Wis. *13 (1862), in interpreting a statute that was also similar to the statutes at issue in Jones and Castillo. The statute, in a single paragraph, outlawed arson of a dwelling house at night. Arson that Mlled someone was punishable by life in prison; arson that did not kill anyone was punishable by 7 to 14 years in prison; arson of a house in which no person was lawfully dwelling was punishable by 3 to 10 years. The court had no trouble concluding that the statute \u201ccreates three distinct statutory-offenses,\u201d 15 Wis., at *15, and that the lawful presence of a person in the dwelling was an element of the middle offense. The court reasoned from the gradations of punishment: \u201cThat the legislature considered the circumstance that a person was lawfully in the dwelling house when fire was set to it most material and important, and as greatly aggravating the crime, is clear from the severity of the punishment imposed.\u201d Id., at *16. The \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d created \u201cthe higher statutory offense[s].\u201d Id., at *17. Because the indictment did not allege that anyone had been present in the dwelling, the court reversed the defendant\u2019s 14-year sentence, but, relying on Larned, supra, the court remanded to permit sentencing under the lowest grade of the crime (which was properly alleged in the indictment). 15 Wis., at *17.\nNumerous other state and federal courts in this period took the same approach to determining which facts are elements of a crime. See Ritchey v. State, 7 Blackf 168, 169 (Ind. 1844) (citing Commonwealth v. Smith, 1 Mass. *245 (1804), and holding that indictment for arson must allege value of property destroyed, because statute set punishment based on value); Spencer v. State, 18 Ohio 401, 406, 408 (1844) (holding that value of goods intended to be stolen is not \u201can ingredient of the crime\u201d of burglary with intent to steal, because punishment under statute did not depend on value; contrasting larceny, in which \u201c[vjalue must be laid, and value proved, that the jury may find it, and the court, by that means, know whether it is grand or petit, and apply the grade of punishment the statute awards\u201d); United States v. Fisher, 25 F. Cas. 1086 (CC Ohio 1849) (McLean, J.) (\u201cA carrier of the mail is subject to a higher penalty where he steals a letter out of the mail, which contains an article of value. And when this offense is committed, the indictment must allege the letter contained an article of value, which aggravates the offense and incurs a higher penalty\u201d); Brightwell v. State, 41 Ga. 482, 483 (1871) (\u201cWhen the law prescribes a different punishment for different phases of the same crime, there is good reason for requiring the indictment to specify which of the phases the prisoner is charged with. The record ought to show that the defendant is convicted of the offense for which he is sentenced\u201d). Cf. State v. Farr, 12 Rich. 24, 29 (S. C. App. 1859) (where two statutes barred purchasing corn from a slave, and one referred to purchasing from slave who lacked a permit, absence of permit was not an element, because both statutes had the same punishment).\nAlso demonstrating the common-law approach to determining elements was the well-established rule that, if a statute increased the punishment of a common-law crime, whether felony or misdemeanor, based on some fact, then that fact must be charged in the indictment in order for the court to impose the increased punishment. Archbold *106; see id., at *50; ante, at 480-481. There was no question of treating the statutory aggravating faet as merely a sentencing enhancement \u2014 as a nonelement enhancing the sentence of the common-law crime. The aggravating fact was an element of a new, aggravated grade of the common-law crime simply because it increased the punishment of the common-law crime. And the common-law crime was, in relation to the statutory one, essentially just like any other lesser included offense. See Archbold *106.\nFurther evidence of the rule that a crime includes every faet that is by law a basis for imposing or increasing punishment comes from early eases addressing recidivism statutes. As Justice Scalia has explained, there was a tradition of treating recidivism as an element. See Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 256-257, 261 (dissenting opinion). That tradition stretches back to the earliest years of the Republic. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Welsh, 4 Va. 57 (1817); Smith v. Commonwealth, 14 Serg. & Rawle 69 (Pa. 1826); see also Archbold *695-*696. For my purposes, however, what is noteworthy is not so much the fact of that tradition as the reason for it: Courts treated the fact of a prior conviction just as any other fact that increased the punishment by law. By the same reasoning that the courts employed in Hope, Lacy, and the other cases discussed above, the fact of a prior conviction was an element, together with the facts constituting the core crime of which the defendant was charged, of a new, aggravated crime.\nThe two leading antebellum cases on whether recidivism is an element were Plumbly v. Commonwealth, 43 Mass. 413 (1841), and Tuttle v. Commonwealth, 68 Mass. 505 (1854). In the latter, the court explained the reason for treating as an element the fact of the prior conviction:\n\u201cWhen the statute imposes a higher penalty upon a second and third conviction, respectively, it makes the prior conviction of a similar offence a part of the description and character of the offence intended to be punished; and therefore the fact of such prior conviction must be charged, as well as proved. It is essential to an indictment, that the facts constituting the offence intended to be punished should be averred.\u201d Id., at 506.\nThe court rested this rule on the common law and the Massachusetts equivalent of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Notice Clause. Ibid. See also Commonwealth v. Haynes, 107 Mass. 194, 198 (1871) (reversing sentence, upon confession of error by attorney general, in case similar to Tuttle).\nNumerous other eases treating the fact of a prior conviction as an element of a crime take the same view. They make clear, by both their holdings and their language, that when a statute increases punishment for some core crime based on the fact of a prior conviction, the core crime and the fact of the prior crime together create a new, aggravated crime. Kilbourn v. State, 9 Conn. 560, 568 (1833) (\u201cNo person ought to be, or can be, subjected to a cumulative penalty, without being charged with a cumulative offence\u201d); Plumbly, supra, at 414 (conviction under recidivism statute is \u201cone conviction, upon one aggregate offence\u201d); Hines v. State, 26 Ga. 614, 616 (1859) (reversing enhanced sentence imposed by trial judge and explaining: \u201c[T]he question, whether the offence was a second one, or not, was a question for the jury. . . . The allegation [of a prior offence] is certainly one of the first importance to the accused, for if it is true, he becomes subject to a greatly increased punishment\u201d). See also Commonwealth v. Phillips, 28 Mass. 28, 33 (1831) (\u201c[U]pon a third conviction, the court may sentence the convict to hard labor for life. The punishment is to be awarded upon that conviction, and for the offence of which he is then and there convicted\u201d).\nEven the exception to this practice of including the fact of a prior conviction in the indictment and trying it to the jury helps to prove the rule that that fact is an element because it increases the punishment by law. In State v. Freeman, 27 Vt. 523 (1855), the Vermont Supreme Court upheld a statute providing that, in an indictment or complaint for violation of a liquor law, it was not necessary to allege a prior conviction of that law in order to secure an increased sentence. But the court did not hold that the prior conviction was not an element; instead, it held that the liquor law created only minor offenses that did not qualify as crimes. Thus, the state constitutional protections that would attach were a \u201ccrime\u201d at issue did not apply. Id., at 527; see Goeller v. State, 119 Md. 61, 66-67, 85 A. 954, 956 (1912) (discussing Freeman). At the same time, the court freely acknowledged that it had \u201cno doubt\u201d of the general rule, particularly as articulated in Massachusetts, that \u201cit is necessary to allege the former conviction, in the indictment, when a higher sentence is claimed on that account.\u201d Freeman, supra, at 526. Unsurprisingly, then, a leading treatise explained Freeman as only \u201capparently\u201d contrary to the general rule and as involving a \u201cspecial statute.\u201d 3 F. Wharton, Criminal Law \u00a73417, p. 307, n. r (7th rev. ed. 1874) (hereinafter Wharton). In addition, less than a decade after Freeman, the same Vermont court held that if a defendant charged with a successive violation of the liquor laws contested identity\u2014 that is, whether the person in the record of the prior conviction was the same as the defendant \u2014 he should be permitted to have a jury resolve the question. State v. Haynes, 35 Vt. 570, 572-573 (1863). (Freeman itself had anticipated this holding by suggesting the use of a jury to resolve disputes over identity. See 27 Vt., at 528.) In so holding, Haynes all but applied the general rule, since a determination of identity was usually the chief factual issue whenever recidivism was charged. See Arehbold *695-*696; see also, e. g., Graham v. West Virginia, 224 U. S. 616, 620-621 (1912) (defendant had been convicted under three different names).\nB\nAn 1872 treatise by one of the leading authorities of the era in criminal law and procedure confirms the common-law understanding that the above cases demonstrate. The treatise condensed the traditional understanding regarding the indictment, and thus regarding the elements of a crime, to the following: \u201c[T]he indictment must allege whatever is in law essential to the punishment sought to be inflicted.\u201d 1 J. Bishop, Law of Criminal Procedure 50 (2d ed. 1872) (hereinafter Bishop, Criminal Procedure). See id., \u00a781, at 51 (\u201c[T]he indictment must contain an allegation of every fact which is legally essential to the punishment to be inflicted\u201d); id., \u00a7 540, at 330 (\u201c[T]he indictment must... contain an averment of every particular thing which enters into the punishment\u201d). Crimes, he explained, consist of those \u201cacts to which the law affixes ... punishment,\u201d id., \u00a780, at 51, or, stated differently, a crime consists of the whole of \u201cthe wrong upon which the punishment is based,\u201d id., \u00a7 84, at 53. In a later edition, Bishop similarly defined the elements of a crime as \u201cthat wrongful aggregation out of which the punishment proceeds.\u201d 1 J. Bishop, New Criminal Procedure \u00a784, p. 49 (4th ed. 1895).\nBishop grounded his definition in both a generalization from well-established common-law practice, 1 Bishop, Criminal Procedure \u00a7\u00a781-84, at 51-53, and in the provisions of Federal and State Constitutions guaranteeing notice of an accusation in all criminal cases, indictment by a grand jury for serious crimes, and trial by jury. With regard to the common law, he explained that his rule was \u201cnot made apparent to our understandings by a single case only, but by all the cases,\u201d id., \u00a781, at 51, and was followed \u201cin all cases, without one exception,\u201d id., \u00a784, at 53. To illustrate, he observed that there are\n\u201cvarious statutes whereby, when . . . assault is committed with a particular intent, or with a particular weapon, or the like, it is subjected to a particular corresponding punishment, heavier than that for common assault, or differing from it, pointed out by the statute. And the reader will notice that, in all eases where the peculiar or aggravated punishment is to be inflicted, the peculiar or aggravating matter is required to be set out in the indictment.\u201d Id., \u00a782, at 52.\nHe also found burglary statutes illustrative in the same way. Id., \u00a783, at 52-53. Bishop made no exception for the fact of a prior conviction \u2014 he simply treated it just as any other aggravating fact: \u201c[If] it is sought to make the sentence heavier by reason of its being [a second or third offence], the fact thus relied on must be averred in the indictment; because the rules of criminal procedure require the indictment, in all cases, to contain an averment of every fact essential to the punishment sought to be inflicted.\u201d 1 J. Bishop, Commentaries on Criminal Law \u00a7 961, pp. 564-565 (5th ed. 1872).\nThe constitutional provisions provided further support, in his view, because of the requirements for a proper accusation at common law and because of the common-law understanding that a proper jury trial required a proper accusation: \u201cThe idea of a jury trial, as it has always been known where the common law prevails, includes the allegation, as part of the machinery of the trial .... [A]n accusation which lacks any particular fact which the law makes essential to the punishment is... no accusation within the requirements of the common law, and it is no accusation in reason.\u201d 1 Bishop, Criminal Procedure \u00a787, at 55. See id., \u00a788, at 56 (notice and indictment requirements ensure that before \u201cpersons held for crimes . . . shall be convicted, there shall be an allegation made against them of every element of crime which the law makes essential to the punishment to be inflicted\u201d).\nNumerous high courts contemporaneously and explicitly agreed that Bishop had accurately captured the common-law understanding of what facts are elements of a crime. See, e. g., Hobbs v. State, 44 Tex. 353, 354 (1875) (favorably quoting 1 Bishop, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 81); Maguire v. State, 47 Md. 485, 497 (1878) (approvingly citing different Bishop treatise for the same rule); Larney v. Cleveland, 34 Ohio St. 599, 600 (1878) (rule and reason for rule \u201care well stated by Mr. Bishop\u201d); State v. Hayward, 83 Mo. 299, 307 (1884) (extensively quoting \u00a781 of Bishop\u2019s \u201cadmirable treatise\u201d); Riggs v. State, 104 Ind. 261, 262, 3 N. E. 886, 887 (1885) (\u201cWe agree with Mr. Bishop that the nature and cause of the accusation are not stated where there is no mention of the full act or series of acts for which the punishment is to be inflicted\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); State v. Perley, 86 Me. 427, 431, 30 A. 74, 75 (1894) (\u201cThe doctrine of the court, says Mr. Bishop, is identical with that of reason, viz: that the indictment must contain an allegation of every fact which is legally essential to the punishment to be inflicted\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 232-233 (1876) (Clifford, J., concurring in judgment) (citing and paraphrasing 1 Bishop, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 81).\nC\nIn the half century following publication of Bishop\u2019s treatise, numerous courts applied his statement of the common-law understanding; most of them explicitly relied on his treatise. Just as in the earlier period, every fact that was by law a basis for imposing or increasing punishment (including the fact of a prior conviction) was an element. Each such fact had to be included in the accusation of the crime and proved to the jury.\nCourts confronted statutes quite similar to the ones with which we have struggled since McMillan, and, applying the traditional rule, they found it not at all difficult to determine whether a fact was an element. In Hobbs, swpra, the defendant was indicted for a form of burglary punishable by 2 to 5 years in prison. A separate statutory section provided for an increased sentence, up to double the punishment to which the defendant would otherwise be subject, if the entry into the house was effected by force exceeding that incidental to burglary. The trial court instructed the jury to sentence the defendant to 2 to 10 years if it found the requisite level of force, and the jury sentenced him to 8. The Texas Supreme Court, relying on Bishop, reversed because the indictment had not alleged such force; even though the jury had sentenced Hobbs within the range (2 to 5 years) that was permissible under the lesser crime that the indictment had charged, the court thought it \"impossible to say ... that the erroneous charge of the court may not have had some weight in leading the jury\u201d to impose the sentence that it did. 44 Tex., at 355. See also Searcy v. State, 1 Tex. App. 440, 444 (1876) (similar); Garcia v. State, 19 Tex. App. 389, 393 (1885) (not citing Hobbs, but relying on Bishop to reverse 10-year sentence for assault with a bowie knife or dagger, where statute doubled range for assault from 2 to 7 to 4 to 14 years if the assault was committed with either weapon but where indictment had not so alleged).\nAs in earlier eases, such as McDonald (discussed swpra, at 504), courts also used the converse of the Bishop rule to explain when a fact was not an element of the crime. In Perley, supra, the defendant was indicted for and convicted of robbery, which was punishable by imprisonment for life or any term of years. The court, relying on Bishop, Hope, McDonald, and other authority, rejected his argument that Maine\u2019s Notice Clause (which of course required all elements to be alleged) required the indictment to allege the value of the goods stolen, because the punishment did not turn on value: \u201c[T]here is no provision of this statute which makes the amount of property taken an essential element of the offense; and there is no statute in this State which creates degrees in robbery, or in any way makes the punishment of the offense dependent upon the value of the property taken.\u201d 86 Me., at 482, 30 A., at 75. The court further explained that \u201cwhere the value is not essential to the punishment it need not be distinctly alleged or proved.\u201d Id., at 433, 30 A., at 76.\nReasoning similar to Perley and the Texas cases is evident in other cases as well. See Jones v. State, 63 Ga. 141, 143 (1879) (where punishment for burglary in the day is 3 to 5 years in prison and for burglary at night is 5 to 20, time of burglary is a \u201cconstituent of the offense\u201d; indictment should \u201ccharge all that is requisite to render plain and certain every constituent of the offense\u201d); United States v. Woodruff, 68 F. 536, 538 (Kan. 1895) (where embezzlement statute \u201ccontemplates that there should be an ascertainment of the exact sum for which a fine may be imposed\u201d and jury did not determine amount, judge lacked authority to impose fine; \u201c[o]n such an issue the defendant is entitled to his constitutional right of trial by jury\u201d).\nCourts also, again just as in the pre-Bishop period, applied the same reasoning to the fact of a prior conviction as they did to any other fact that aggravated the punishment by law. Many, though far from all, of these courts relied on Bishop. In 1878, Maryland\u2019s high court, in Maguire v. State, 47 Md. 485, stated the rule and the reason for it in language indistinguishable from that of Tuttle a quarter century before:\n\u201cThe law would seem to be well settled, that if the party be proceeded against for a second or third offence under the statute, and the sentence prescribed be different from the first, or severer, by reason of its being such second or third offence, the fact thus relied on must be averred in the indictment; for the settled rule is, that the indictment must contain an averment of every fact essential to justify the punishment inflicted.\u201d Maguire, supra, at 496 (citing English cases, Plumbly v. Commonwealth, 43 Mass. 413 (1841), Wharton, and Bishop).\nIn Goeller v. State, 119 Md. 61, 85 A. 954 (1912), the same court reaffirmed Maguire and voided, as contrary to Maryland\u2019s Notice Clause, a statute that permitted the trial judge to determine the fact of a prior conviction. The eourt extensively quoted Bishop, who had, in the court\u2019s view, treated the subject \u201cmore fully, perhaps, than any other legal writer,\u201d and it cited, among other authorities, \u201ca line of Massachusetts decisions\u201d and Riggs (quoted supra, at 512). 119 Md., at 66, 85 A., at 955. In Larney, 34 Ohio St., at 600-601, the Supreme Court of Ohio, in an opinion citing only Bishop, reversed a conviction under a recidivism statute where the indictment had not alleged any prior conviction. (The defendant had also relied on Plumbly, supra, and Kilbourn v. State, 9 Conn. 560 (1833). 34 Ohio St., at 600.) And in State v. Adams, 64 N. H. 440, 13 A. 785 (1888), the court, relying on Bishop, explained that \u201c[t]he former conviction being a part of the description and character of the offense intended to be punished, because of the higher penalty imposed, it must be alleged.\u201d Id., at 442, 13 A., at 786. The defendant had been \u201ccharged with an offense aggravated by its repetitious character.\u201d Ibid. See also Evans v. State, 150 Ind. 651, 653, 50 N. E. 820 (1898) (similar); Shiflett v. Commonwealth, 114 Va. 876, 877, 77 S. E. 606, 607 (1913) (similar).\nEven without any reliance on Bishop, other courts addressing recidivism statutes employed the same reasoning as did he and the above cases \u2014 that a crime includes any fact to which punishment attaches. One of the leading cases was Wood v. People, 58 N. Y. 511 (1873). The statute in Wood provided for increased punishment if the defendant had previously been convicted of a felony then discharged from the conviction. The court, repeatedly referring to \u201cthe aggravated offence,\u201d id., at 513,515, held that the facts of the prior conviction and of the discharge must be proved to the jury, for \u201c[b]oth enter into and make a part of the offence . . . subjecting the prisoner to the increased punishment.\u201d Id., at 513; see ibid, (fact of prior conviction was an \u201cessential ingredient\u201d of the offense). See also Johnson v. People, 55 N. Y. 512, 514 (1874) (\u201cA more severe penalty is denounced by the statute for a second offence; and all the facts to bring the case within the statute must be [alleged in the indictment and] established on the trial\u201d); People v. Sickles, 156 N. Y. 541, 544-545, 51N. E. 288, 289 (1898) (reaffirming Wood and Johnson and explaining that \u201cthe charge is not merely that the prisoner has committed the offense specifically described, but that, as a former convict, his second offense has subjected him to an enhanced penalty\u201d).\nContemporaneously with the New York Court of Appeals in Wood and Johnson, state high courts in California and Pennsylvania offered similar explanations for why the fact of a prior conviction is an element. In People v. Delany, 49 Cal. 394 (1874), which involved a statute making petit larceny (normally a misdemeanor) a felony if committed following a prior conviction for petit larceny, the court left no doubt that the fact of the prior conviction was an element of an aggravated crime consisting of petit larceny committed following a prior conviction for petit larceny:\n\u201cThe particular circumstances of the offense are stated [in the indictment], and consist of the prior convictions and of the facts constituting the last larceny.\n\u201c[T]he former convictions are made to adhere to and constitute a portion of the aggravated offense.\u201d Id., at 395.\n\"The felony consists both of the former convictions and of the particular larceny. . . . [T]he former convictions were a separate fact; which, taken in connection with the facts constituting the last offense, make a distinct and greater offense than that charged, exclusive of the prior convictions.\u201d Id., at 396.\nSee also People v. Coleman, 145 Cal. 609, 610-611, 79 P. 283, 284-285 (1904).\nSimilarly, in Rauch v. Commonwealth, 78 Pa. 490 (1876), the court applied its 1826 decision in Smith v. Commonwealth, 14 Serg. & Rawle 69, and reversed the trial court\u2019s imposition of an enhanced sentence \u201cupon its own knowledge of its records.\u201d 78 Pa., at 494. The court explained that \u201cimprisonment in jail is not a lawful consequence of a mere conviction for an unlawful sale of liquors. It is the lawful consequence of a second sale only after a former conviction. On every principle of personal security and the due administration of justice, the fact whieh gives rightfulness to the greater punishment should appear in the record.\u201d Ibid. See also id., at 495 (\u201cBut clearly the substantive offence, whieh draws to itself the greater punishment, is the unlawful sale after a former conviction. This, therefore, is the very offence he is called upon to defend against\u201d).\nMeanwhile, Massachusetts reaffirmed its earlier decisions, striking down, in Commonwealth v. Harrington, 130 Mass. 35 (1880), a liquor law that provided a small fine for a first or second conviction, provided a larger fine or imprisonment up to a year for a third conviction, and specifically provided that a prior conviction need not be alleged in the complaint. The court found this law plainly inconsistent with Tuttle and with the State\u2019s Notice Clause, explaining that \u201cthe offence whieh is punishable with the higher penalty is not fully and substantially described to the defendant, if the complaint fails to set forth the former convictions which are essential features of it.\u201d 130 Mass., at 36.\nWithout belaboring the point any further, I simply note that this traditional understanding \u2014 that a \u201ccrime\u201d includes every fact that is by law a basis for imposing or increasing punishment \u2014 continued well into the 20th century, at least until the middle of the century. See Knoll & Singer, Searching for the \u201cTail of the Dog\u201d: Finding \u201cElements\u201d of Crimes in the Wake of McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 22 Seattle U. L. Rev. 1057, 1069-1081 (1999) (surveying 20th-century decisions of federal courts prior to McMillan)-, see also People v. Ratner, 67 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 902, 903-906, 153 P. 2d 790, 791-793 (1944). In fact, it is fair to say that McMillan began a revolution in the law regarding the definition of \u201ccrime.\u201d Today\u2019s decision, far from being a sharp break with the past, marks nothing more than a return to the status quo ante \u2014 the status quo that reflected the original meaning of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\nIll\nThe consequence of the above discussion for our decisions in Almendarez-Torres and McMillan should be plain enough, but a few points merit special mention.\nFirst, it is irrelevant to the question of which facts are elements that legislatures have allowed sentencing judges discretion in determining punishment (often within extremely broad ranges). See ante, at 481-482; post, at 544-545 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). Bishop, immediately after setting out the traditional rule on elements, explained why:\n\"The reader should distinguish between the foregoing doctrine, and the doctrine . . . that, within the limits of any discretion as to the punishment which the law may have allowed, the judge, when he pronounces sentence, may suffer his discretion to be influenced by matter shown in aggravation or mitigation, not covered by the allegations of the indictment. . . . The aggravating circumstances spoken of cannot swell the penalty above what the law has provided for the acts charged against the prisoner, and they are interposed merely to cheek the judicial discretion in the exercise of the permitted mercy [in finding mitigating circumstances]. This is an entirely different thing from punishing one for what is not alleged against him.\u201d 1 Bishop, Criminal Procedure \u00a785, at 54.\nSee also 1 J. Bishop, New Commentaries on the Criminal Law \u00a7\u00a7600-601, pp. 370-371, \u00a7948, p. 572 (8th ed. 1892) (similar). In other words, establishing what punishment is available by law and setting a specific punishment within the bounds that the law has prescribed are two different things. Cf. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Law of England 371-872 (1769) (noting judges\u2019 broad discretion in setting amount of fine and length of imprisonment for misdemeanors, but praising determinate punishment and \u201cdiscretion . . . regulated by law\u201d); Perley, 86 Me., at 429, 432, 30 A., at 74, 75-76 (favorably discussing Bishop\u2019s rule on elements without mentioning, aside from quotation of statute in statement of facts, that defendant\u2019s conviction for robbery exposed him to imprisonment for life or any term of years). Thus, it is one thing to consider what the Constitution requires the prosecution to do in order to entitle itself to a particular kind, degree, or range of punishment of the accused, see Woodruff, 68 F., at 538, and quite another to consider what constitutional constraints apply either to the imposition of punishment within the limits of that entitlement or to a legislature\u2019s ability to set broad ranges of punishment. In answering the former constitutional question, I need not, and do not, address the latter.\nSecond, and related, one of the chief errors of Almendarez-Torres \u2014 an error to which I succumbed \u2014 was to attempt to discern whether a particular fact is traditionally (or typically) a basis for a sentencing court to increase an offender\u2019s sentence. 523 U. S., at 243-244; see id., at 230, 241. For the reasons I have given, it should be clear that this approach just defines away the real issue. What matters is the way by which a fact enters into the sentence. If a fact is by law the basis for imposing or increasing punishment \u2014 for establishing or increasing the prosecution\u2019s entitlement \u2014 it is an element. (To put the point differently, I am aware of no historical basis for treating as a nonelement a fact that by law sets or increases punishment.) When one considers the question from this perspective, it is evident why the fact of a prior conviction is an element under a recidivism statute. Indeed, cases addressing such statutes provide some of the best discussions of what constitutes an element of a crime. One reason frequently offered for treating recidivism differently, a reason on which we relied in Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 285, is a concern for prejudicing the jury by informing it of the prior conviction. But this concern, of which earlier courts were well aware, does not make the traditional understanding of what an element is any less applicable to the fact of a prior conviction. See, e. g., Maguire, 47 Md., at 498; Sickles, 156 N. Y., at 547, 51 N. R, at 290.\nThird, I think it clear that the common-law rule would cover the McMillan situation of a mandatory minimum sentence (in that case, for visible possession of a firearm during the commission of certain crimes). No doubt a defendant could, under such a scheme, find himself sentenced to the same term to which he could have been sentenced absent the mandatory minimum. The range for his underlying crime could be 0 to 10 years, with the mandatory minimum of 5 years, and he could be sentenced to 7. (Of course, a similar scenario is possible with an increased maximum.) But it is equally true that his expected punishment has increased as a result of the narrowed range and that the prosecution is empowered, by invoking the mandatory minimum, to require the judge to impose a higher punishment than he might wish. The mandatory minimum \u201centities] the government,\u201d Wood-ruff, supra, at 588, to more than it would otherwise be entitled (5 to 10 years, rather than 0 to 10 and the risk of a sentence below 5). Thus, the fact triggering the mandatory minimum is part of \u201cthe punishment sought to be inflicted,\u201d Bishop, Criminal Procedure 50; it undoubtedly \u201centers into the punishment\u201d so as to aggravate it, id., \u00a7 540, at 330, and is an \u201cac[t] to which the law affixes ... punishment,\u201d id., \u00a7 80, at 51. Further, just as in Hobbs and Searcy, see swpra, at 512-513, it is likely that the change in the range available to the judge affects his choice of sentence. Finally, in numerous eases, such as Lacy, Garcia, and Jones, see supra, at 504-505, 514, the aggravating fact raised the whole range\u2014 both the top and bottom. Those courts, in holding that such a fact was an element, did not bother with any distinction between changes in the maximum and the minimum. What mattered was simply the overall increase in the punishment provided by law. And in several cases, such as Smith and Woodruff, see supra, at 502, 514, the very concept of m\u00e1ximums and m\u00ednimums had no applicability, yet the same rule for elements applied. See also Harrington (discussed supra, at 517-518).\nFinally, I need not in this case address the implications of the rule that I have stated for the Court\u2019s decision in Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 647-649 (1990). See ante, at 496. Walton did approve a scheme by which a judge, rather than a jury, determines an aggravating fact that makes a convict eligible for the death penalty, and thus eligible for a greater punishment. In this sense, that fact is an element. But that scheme exists in a unique context, for in the area of capital punishment, unlike any other area, we have imposed special constraints on a legislature\u2019s ability to determine what facts shall lead to what punishment \u2014 we have restricted the legislature\u2019s ability to define crimes. Under our recent capital-punishment jurisprudence, neither Arizona nor any other jurisdiction could provide \u2014 as, previously, it freely could and did \u2014 that a person shall be death eligible automatically upon conviction for certain crimes. We have interposed a barrier between a jury finding of a capital crime and a court\u2019s ability to impose capital punishment. Whether this distinction between capital crimes and all others, or some other distinction, is sufficient to put the former outside the rule that I have stated is a question for another day.\nFor the foregoing reasons, as well as those given in the Court\u2019s opinion, I agree that the New Jersey procedure at issue is unconstitutional.\nJustice O\u2019Connor mischaracterizes my argument. See post, at 527-528 (dissenting opinion). Of eourse the Fifth and Sixth Amendments did not codify common-law procedure wholesale. Rather, and as Story notes, they codified a few particular common-law procedural rights. As I have explained, the scope of those rights turns on what constitutes a \u201ccrime.\u201d In answering that question, it is entirely proper to look to the common law.\nIt is strange that Justice O\u2019Connor faults me for beginning my analysis with eases primarily from the 1840\u2019s, rather from the time of the founding. See post, at 527-528 (dissenting opinion). As the Court explains, ante, at 478-480, and as she concedes, post, at 525 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting), the very idea of a sentencing enhancement was foreign to the common law of the time of the founding. Justice O\u2019Connor therefore, and understandably, does not contend that any history from the founding supports her position. As far as I have been able to tell, the argument that a fact that was by law the basis for imposing or increasing punishment might not be an element did not seriously arise (at least not in reported cases) until the 1840\u2019s. As I explain below, from that time on \u2014 for at least a century \u2014 essentially all authority rejected that argument, and much of it did so in reliance upon the common law. I find this evidence more than sufficient.\nThe Massachusetts statute provided: \u201cEvery person who shall commit the offence of larceny, by stealing of the property of another any money, goods or chattels [or other sort of property], if the property stolen shall exceed the value of one hundred dollars, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison, not more than five years, or by fine not exceeding six hundred dollars, and imprisonment in the county jail, not more than two years; and if the property stolen shall not exceed the value of one hundred dollars, he shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison or the county jail, not more than one year, or by fine not exceeding three hundred dollars.\u201d Mass. Rev. Stat., eh. 126, \u00a7 17 (1836).\nThe Wisconsin statute provided: \u2018Every person who shall willfully and maliciously bum, in the night time, the dwelling house of another, whereby the life of any person shall be destroyed, or shall in the night time willfully and maliciously set fire to any other building, owned by himself or another, by the burning whereof such dwelling house shall be burnt in the night time, whereby the life of any person shall be destroyed, shall suffer the same punishment as provided for the crime of murder in the second degree; but if the life of no person shall have been destroyed, he shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison, not more than fourteen years nor less than seven years; and if at the time of committing the offense there was no person lawfully in the dwelling house so burnt, he shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison, not more than ten years nor less than three years.\u201d Wis. Rev. Stat., ch. 165, \u00a7 1 (1858), The punishment for second-degree murder was life in prison. CL 164, \u00a72.\nThe gulf between the traditional approach to determining elements and that of our recent cases is manifest when one considers how one might, from the perspective of those cases, analyze the issue in Hobbs. The chapter of the Texas code addressing burglary was entitled simply \u201cOf Burglary\u201d and began with a section explicitly defining \u201cthe offense of burglary.\u201d After a series of sections defining terms, it then set out six separate sections specifying the punishment for various kinds of burglary. The section regarding force was one of these. See 1 G. Paschal, Digest of Laws of Texas, Part II, Tit. 20, ch. 6, pp. 462-463 (4th ed. 1875). Following an approach similar to that in Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 231-234, 242-246 (1998), and Castillo v. United States, ante, at 124-125, one would likely find a clear legislative intent to make force a sentencing enhancement rather than an element.\nThe court held that a general plea of \u201cguilty\u201d to an indictment that includes an allegation of a prior conviction applies to the fact of the prior conviction.\nSee also State v. Austin, 113 Mo. 538, 542, 21 S. W. 31, 32 (1893) (prior conviction is a \u201cmaterial fac[t]\u201d of the \u201caggravated offense\u201d); Bandy v. Hehn, 10 Wyo. 167, 172-174, 67 P. 979, 980 (1902) (\u201c[I]n reason, and by the great weight of authority, as the fact of a former conviction enters into the offense to the extent of aggravating it and increasing the punishment, it must be alleged in the information and proved like any other material fact, if it is sought to impose the greater penalty. The statute makes the prior conviction a part of the description and character of the offense intended to be punished\u201d (citing Tuttle v. Commonwealth, 68 Mass. 505 (1854))); State v. Smith, 129 Iowa 709, 711-712, 106 N. W. 187, 188-189 (1906) (similar); State v. Scheminisky, 31 Idaho 504, 506-507, 174 P. 611, 611-612 (1918) (similar).\nThis is not to deny that there may be laws on the borderline of this distinction. In Brightwell v. State, 41 Ga. 482 (1871), the court stated a rule for elements equivalent to Bishop\u2019s, then held that whether a defendant had committed arson in the day or at night need not be in the indictment. The court explained that there was \u201cno provision that arson in the night shall be punished for any different period\u201d than arson in the day (both being punishable by 2 to 7 years in prison). Id., at 483. Although there was a statute providing that \u201carson in the day time shall be punished for a less period than arson in the night time,\u201d the court concluded that it merely set \u201ca rule for the exercise of [the sentencing judge\u2019s] discretion\u201d by specifying a particular fact for the judge to consider along with the many others that would enter into his sentencing decision. Ibid. Cf Jones v. State, 68 Ga. 141,143 (1879) (whether burglary occurred in day or at night is a \u201cconstituent of the offense\u201d because law fixes different ranges of punishment based on this fact). And the statute attached no definite consequence to that particular fact: A sentencing judge presumably could have imposed a sentence of seven years less one second for daytime arson. Finally, it is likely that the statute in Brightwell, given its language (\u201ca less period\u201d) and its placement in a separate section, was read as setting out an affirmative defense or mitigating circumstance. See Wright v. State, 113 Ga. App. 436,437-438, 148 S. E. 2d 333, 335-336 (1966) (suggesting that it would be error to refhse to charge later version of this statute to jmy upon request of defendant). See generally Arch-bold *52, *105~*106 (discussing rules for determining whether fact is an element or a defense).\nIn addition, it has been common practice to address this concern by permitting the defendant to stipulate to the prior conviction, in which ease the charge of the prior conviction is not read to the jury, or, if the defendant decides not to stipulate, to bifurcate the trial, with the jury only considering the prior conviction after it has reached a guilty verdict on the core crime. See, e. g., 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Law \u00a7 964, pp. 566-567 (5th ed. 1872) (favorably discussing English practice of bifurcation); People v. Saunders, 5 Cal. 4th 580, 587-588, 853 P. 2d 1093, 1095-1096 (1993) (detailing California approach, since 1874, of permitting stipulation and, more recently, of also permitting bifurcation).\nIt is likewise unnecessary to consider whether (and, if so, how) the rule regarding elements applies to the Sentencing Guidelines, given the unique status that they have under Mistretta v. United, States, 488 U. S. 361 (1989). But it may be that this special status is irrelevant, because the Guidelines \"have the force and effect of laws.\u201d Id., at 413 (Scalia, J., dissenting).",

Id., at 254, 264-272 (dissenting opinion). Today, in what will surely be remembered as a watershed change in constitutional law, the Court imposes as a constitutional rule the principle it first identified in Jones.\n> \u2014 i\nOur Court has long recognized that not every fact that bears on a defendant\u2019s punishment need be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proved by the government beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, we have held that the \u201clegislature\u2019s definition of the elements of the offense is usually dispositive.\u201d McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 85 (1986); see also Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 528 U. S. 224, 228 (1998); Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 210, 211, n. 12 (1977). Although we have recognized that \u201cthere are obviously constitutional limits beyond which the States may not go in this regard,\u201d id., at 210, and that \u201cin certain limited circumstances Winship\u2019s reasonable-doubt requirement applies to facts not formally identified as elements of the offense charged,\u201d McMillan, supra, at 86, we have proceeded with caution before deciding that a certain fact must be treated as an offense element despite the legislature\u2019s choice not to characterize it as such. We have therefore declined to establish any bright-line rule for making such judgments and have instead approached each case individually, sifting through the considerations most relevant to determining whether the legislature has acted properly within its broad power to define crimes and their punishments or instead has sought to evade the constitutional requirements associated with the characterization of a faet as an offense element. See, e. g., Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721, 728-729 (1998); McMillan, supra, at 86.\nIn one bold stroke the Court today casts aside our traditional cautious approach and instead embraces a universal and seemingly bright-line rule limiting the power of Congress and state legislatures to define criminal offenses and the sentences that follow from convictions thereunder. The Court states: \"Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Ante, at 490. In its opinion, the Court marshals virtually no authority to support its extraordinary rule. Indeed, it is remarkable that the Court cannot identify a single instance, in the over 200 years since the ratification of the Bill of Rights, that our Court has applied, as a constitutional requirement, the rule it announces today.\nAccording to the Court, its constitutional rule \"emerges from our history and case law.\u201d Ante, at 492. None of the history contained in the Court\u2019s opinion requires the rule it ultimately adopts. The history cited by the Court can be divided into two categories: first, evidence that judges at common law had virtually no discretion in sentencing, ante, at 478-480, and, second, statements from a 19th-century criminal procedure treatise that the government must charge in an indictment and prove at trial the elements of a statutory offense for the defendant to be sentenced to the punishment attached to that statutory offense, ante, at 480-481. The relevance of the first category of evidence can be easily dismissed. Indeed, the Court does not even claim that the historical evidence of nondiscretionary sentencing at common law supports its \u201cincrease in the maximum penalty\u201d rule. Rather, almost as quickly as it recites that historical practice, the Court rejects its relevance to the constitutional question presented here due to the conflicting American practice of judges exercising sentencing discretion and our decisions recognizing the legitimacy of that American practice. See ante, at 481-482 (citing Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246 (1949)). Even if the Court were to claim that the common-law history on this point did bear on the instant ease, one wonders why the historical practice of judges pronouncing judgments in cases between private parties is relevant at all to the question of criminal punishment presented here. See ante, at 479-480 (quoting 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 396 (1768), which pertains to \u201cremedies] prescribed by law for the redress of injuries\u201d).\nApparently, then, the historical practice on which the Court places so much reliance consists of only two quotations taken from an 1862 criminal procedure treatise. See ante, at 480-481 (quoting J. Arehbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases 51,188 (15th ed. 1862)). A closer examination of the two statements reveals that neither supports the Court\u2019s \u201cincrease in the maximum penalty\u201d rule. Both of the excerpts pertain to circumstances in which a common-law felony had also been made a separate statutory offense carrying a greater penalty. Taken together, the statements from the Arehbold treatise demonstrate nothing more than the unremarkable proposition that a defendant could receive the greater statutory punishment only if the indictment expressly charged and the prosecutor proved the facts that made up the statutory offense, as opposed to simply those facts that made up the common-law offense. See id., at 51 (indictment); id., at 188 (proof). In other words, for the defendant to receive the statutory punishment, the prosecutor had to charge in the indictment and prove at trial the elements of the statutory offense. To the extent there is any doubt about the precise meaning of the treatise excerpts, that doubt is dispelled by looking to the treatise sections from which the excerpts are drawn and the broader principle each section is meant to illustrate. See id., at 43- (\u201cEvery offence consists of certain acts done or omitted under certain circumstances; and in an indictment for the offence, it is not sufficient to charge the defendant generally with having committed it,... but all the facts and circumstances constituting the offence must be specially set forth\u201d); id., at 180 (\u201cEvery offence consists of certain acts done or omitted, under certain circumstances, all of which must be stated in the indictment... and be proved as laid\u201d). And, to the extent further clarification is needed, the authority cited by the Arehbold treatise to support its stated proposition with respect to the requirements of an indictment demonstrates that the treatise excerpts mean only that the prosecutor must charge and then prove at trial the elements of the statutory offense. See 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown *170 (hereinafter Hale) (\u201cAn indictment grounded upon an offense made by act of parliament must by express words bring the offense within the substantial description made in the act of parliament\u201d). No Member of this Court questions the proposition that a State must charge in the indictment and prove at trial beyond a reasonable doubt the actual elements of the offense. This case, however, concerns the distinct question of when a fact that bears on a defendant\u2019s punishment, but which the legislature has not classified as an element of the charged offense, must nevertheless be treated as an offense element. The excerpts drawn from the Archbold treatise do not speak to this question at all. The history on which the Court\u2019s opinion relies provides no support for its \u201cincrease in the maximum penalty\u201d rule.\nIn his concurring opinion, Justice Thomas cites additional historical evidence that, in his view, dictates an even broader rule than that set forth in the Court\u2019s opinion. The history cited by Justice Thomas does not require, as a matter of federal constitutional law, the application of the rule he advocates. To understand why, it is important to focus on the basis for Justice Thomas\u2019 argument. First, he claims that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments \u201ccodified\u201d preexisting common law. Second, he contends that the relevant common law treated any fact that served to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment as an element of an offense. See ante, at 500-501. Even if Justice Thomas\u2019 first assertion were correct \u2014 a proposition this Court has not before embraced\u2014 he fails to gather the evidence necessary to support his second assertion. Indeed, for an opinion that purports to be founded upon the original understanding of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, Justice Thomas\u2019 concurrence is notable for its failure to discuss any historical practice, or to cite any decisions, predating (or contemporary with) the ratification of the Bill of Rights. Rather, Justice Thomas divines the common-law understanding of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by consulting decisions rendered by American courts well after the ratification of the Bill of Rights, ranging primarily from the 1840\u2019s to the 1890\u2019s. Whatever those decisions might reveal about the way American state 'courts resolved questions regarding the distinction between a crime and its punishment under general rules of criminal pleading or their own state constitutions, the decisions fail to demonstrate any settled understanding with respect to the definition of a crime under the relevant, pre-existing common law. Thus, there is a crucial disconnect between the historical evidence Justice Thomas cites and the proposition he seeks to establish with that evidence.\nAn examination of the decisions cited by Justice Thomas makes clear that they did not involve a simple application of a long-settled common-law rule that any fact that increases punishment must constitute an offense element. That would have been unlikely, for there does not appear to have been any such common-law rule. The most relevant common-law principles in this area were that an indictment must charge the elements of the relevant offense and must do so with certainty. See, e.g., 2 Hale *182 (\u201cTouching the thing wherein or of which the offense is committed, there is required a certainty in an indictment\u201d); id., at *188 (\u201cThe fact itself must be certainly set down in an indictment\u201d); id., at *184 (\u201cThe offense itself must be alledged, and the manner of it\u201d). Those principles, of course, say little about when a specific fact constitutes an element of the offense.\nJustice Thomas is correct to note that American courts in the 19th century came to confront this question in their cases, and often treated facts that served to increase punishment as elements of the relevant statutory offenses. To the extent Justice Thomas\u2019 broader rule can be drawn from those decisions, the rule was one of those courts\u2019 own invention, and not a previously existing rule that would have been \"codified\u201d by the ratification of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Few of the decisions cited by Justice Thomas indicate a reliance on pre-existing common-law principles. In fact, the converse rule that he identifies in the 19th-century American cases \u2014 that a fact that does not make a difference in punishment need not be charged in an indictment, see, e. g., Larned v. Commonwealth, 53 Mass. 240, 242-244 (1847) \u2014 was assuredly created by American courts, given that English courts of roughly the same period followed a contrary rule. See, e. g., Rex v. Marshall, 1 Moody C. C. 158, 168 Eng. Rep. 1224 (1827). Justice Thomas\u2019 collection of state-court opinions is therefore of marginal assistance in determining the original understanding of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. While the decisions Justice Thomas cites provide some authority for the rule he advocates, they certainly do not control our resolution of the federal constitutional question presented in the instant case and cannot, standing alone, justify overruling three decades\u2019 worth of decisions by this Court.\nIn contrast to Justice Thomas, the Court asserts that its rule is supported by \"our cases in this area.\u201d Ante, at 490. That the Court begins its review of our precedent with a quotation from a dissenting opinion speaks volumes about the support that actually can be drawn from our cases for the \"increase in the maximum penalty\u201d rule announced today. See ante, at 484 (quoting Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 251 (Scalia, J., dissenting)). The Court then cites our decision in Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975), to demonstrate the \u201clesson\u201d that due process and jury protections extend beyond those factual determinations that affect a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. Ante, at 484. The Court explains Mullaney as having held that the due process proof-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt requirement applies to those factual determinations that, under a State\u2019s criminal law, make a difference in the degree of punishment the defendant receives. Ante, at 484. The Court chooses to ignore, however, the decision we issued two years later, Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197 (1977), which clearly rejected the Court\u2019s broad reading of Mullaney.\nIn Patterson, the jury found the defendant guilty of second-degree murder. Under New York law, the fact that a person intentionally killed another while under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance distinguished the reduced offense of first-degree manslaughter from the more serious offense of second-degree murder. Thus, the presence or absence of this one fact was the defining factor separating a greater from a lesser punishment. Under New York law, however, the State did not need to prove the absence of extreme emotional disturbance beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, state law imposed the burden of proving the presence of extreme emotional disturbance on the defendant, and required that the fact be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. 482 U. S., at 198-200. We rejected Patterson\u2019s due process challenge to his conviction:\n\u201cWe thus decline to adopt as a constitutional imperative, operative countrywide, that a State must disprove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact constituting any and all affirmative defenses related to the culpability of an accused. Traditionally, due process has required that only the most basic procedural safeguards be observed; more subtle balancing of society\u2019s interests against those of the accused have been left to the legislative branch.\u201d Id., at 210.\nAlthough we characterized the factual determination under New York law as one going to the mitigation of culpability, id., at 206, as opposed to the aggravation of the punishment, it is difficult to understand why the rule adopted by the Court in today\u2019s ease (or the broader rule advocated by Justice Thomas) would not require the overruling of Patterson. Unless the Court is willing to defer to a legislature\u2019s formal definition of the elements of an offense, it is clear that the fact that Patterson did not act under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance, in substance, \u201cincrease[d] the penalty for [his] crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum\u201d for first-degree manslaughter. Ante, at 490. Nonetheless, we held that New York\u2019s requirement that the defendant, rather than the State, bear the burden of proof on this factual determination comported with the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Patterson, 432 U. S., at 205-211, 216; se\u00e9 also id., at 204-205 (reaffirming Leland v. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790 (1952), which upheld against due process challenge Oregon\u2019s requirement that the defendant, rather than the State, bear the burden on factual determination of defendant\u2019s insanity).\nPatterson is important because it plainly refutes the Court\u2019s expansive reading of Mullaney. Indeed, the defendant in Patterson characterized Mullaney exactly as the Court has today and we rejected that interpretation:\n\u201cMullaneys holding, it is argued, is that the State may not permit the blameworthiness of an aet or the severity of punishment authorized for its commission to depend on the presence or absence of an identified fact without assuming the burden of proving the presence or absence of that fact, as the ease may be, beyond a reasonable doubt. In our view, the Mullaney holding should not be so broadly read.\u201d Patterson, supra, at 214-215 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).\nWe explained Mullaney instead as holding only \u201cthat a State must prove every ingredient of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, and that it may not shift the burden of proof to the defendant by presuming that ingredient upon proof of the other elements of the offense.\u201d 432 U. S., at 215. Because nothing had been presumed against Patterson under New York law, we found no due process violation. Id., at 216. Ever since our decision in Patterson, we have consistently explained the holding in Mullaney in these limited terms and have rejected the broad interpretation the Court gives Mullaney today. See Jones, 526 U. S., at 241 (\u201cWe identified the use of a presumption to establish an essential ingredient of the offense as the curse of the Maine law [in Mullaney]\u201d); Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 240 (\u201c[Mulla-ney] suggests that Congress cannot permit judges to increase a sentence in light of recidivism, or any other factor, not set forth in an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. This Court\u2019s later ease, Patterson v. New York,... however, makes absolutely clear that such a reading of Mullaney is wrong\u201d); McMillan, 477 U. S., at 84 (same).\nThe case law from which the Court claims that its rule emerges consists of only one other decision \u2014 McMillan v. Pennsylvania. The Court\u2019s reliance on McMillan is also puzzling, given that our holding in that case points to the rejection of the Court\u2019s rule. There, we considered a Pennsylvania statute that subjected a defendant to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment if a judge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant had visibly possessed a firearm during the commission of the offense for which he had been convicted. Id., at 81. The petitioners claimed that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause and the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury trial guarantee (as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment) required the State to prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that they had visibly possessed firearms. We rejected both constitutional claims. Id., at 84-91, 93.\nThe essential holding of McMillan conflicts with at least two of the several formulations the Court gives to the rule it announces today. First, the Court endorses the following principle: \u201c\u2018[I]t is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the 'prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed. It is equally clear that such facts must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d Ante, at 490 (emphasis added) (quoting Jones, supra, at 252-253 (Stevens, J., concurring)). Second, the Court endorses the rule as restated in Justice Scalia\u2019s concurring opinion in Jones. See ante, at 490. There, Justice Scalia wrote: \u201c[I]t is unconstitutional to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that alter the congressionally prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.\u201d Jones, supra, at 253 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court appears to hold that any fact that increases or alters the range of penalties to which a defendant is exposed \u2014 which, by definition, must include increases or alterations to either the minimum or maximum penalties \u2014 must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In McMillan, however, we rejected such a rule to the extent it concerned those facts that increase or alter the minimum penalty to which a defendant is exposed. Accordingly, it is incumbent on the Court not only to admit that it is overruling McMillan, but also to explain why such a course of action is appropriate under normal principles of stare decisis.\nThe Court\u2019s opinion does neither. Instead, it attempts to lay claim to McMillan as support for its \u201cincrease in the maximum penalty\u201d rule. According to the Court, McMillan acknowledged that permitting a judge to make findings that expose a defendant to greater or additional punishment \u201cmay raise serious constitutional concern.\u201d Ante, at 486. We said nothing of the sort in McMillan. To the contrary, we began our discussion of the petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims by emphasizing that we had already \u201crejected the claim that whenever a State links the \u2018severity of punishment\u2019 to \u2018the presence or absence of an identified fact\u2019 the State must prove that fact beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 477 U. S., at 84 (quoting Patterson, 482 U. S., at 214). We then reaffirmed the rule set forth in Patterson \u2014 \u201cthat in determining what facts must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt the state legislature\u2019s definition of the elements of the offense is usually dispositive.\u201d McMillan, 477 U. S., at 85. Although we acknowledged that there are constitutional limits to the State\u2019s power to define crimes and prescribe penalties, we found no need to establish those outer boundaries in McMillan because \u201cseveral factors\u201d persuaded us that the Pennsylvania statute did not exceed those limits, however those limits might be defined. Id., at 86. The Court\u2019s assertion that McMillan supports the application of its bright-line rule in this area is, therefore, unfounded.\nThe Court nevertheless claims to find support for its rule in our discussion of one factor in McMillan \u2014 namely, our statement that the petitioners\u2019 claim would have had \u201cat least more superficial appeal\u201d if the firearm possession finding had exposed them to greater or additional punishment. Id., at 88. To say that a claim may have had \u201cmore superficial appeal\u201d is, of course, a far cry from saying that a claim would have been upheld. Moreover, we made that statement in the context of examining one of several factors that, in combination, ultimately gave \u201cno doubt that Pennsylvania\u2019s [statute fell] on the permissible side of the constitutional line.\u201d Id., at 91. The confidence of that conclusion belies any argument that our ruling would have been different had the Pennsylvania statute instead increased the maximum penalty to which the petitioners were exposed. In short, it is clear that we did not articulate any bright-line rule that States must prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt any fact that exposes a defendant to a greater punishment. Such a rule would have been in substantial tension with both our earlier acknowledgment that Patterson rejected such a rule, see 477 U. S., at 84, and our recognition that a state legislature\u2019s definition of the elements is normally disposi-tive, see id., at 85. If any single rule can be derived from McMillan, it is not the Court\u2019s \u201cincrease in the maximum penalty\u201d principle, but rather the following: When a State takes a fact that has always been considered by sentencing courts to bear on punishment, and dictates the precise weight that a court should give that fact in setting a defendant\u2019s sentence, the relevant fact need not be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt as would an element of the offense. See id., at 89-90.\nApart from Mullaney and McMillan, the Court does not claim to find support for its rule in any other pre-Jones decision. Thus, the Court is in error when it says that its rule emerges from our ease law. Nevertheless, even if one were willing to assume that Mullaney and McMillan lend some support for the Court\u2019s position, that feeble foundation is shattered by several of our precedents directly addressing the issue. The only one of those decisions that the Court addresses at any length is Almendarez-Torres. There, we squarely rejected the \u201cincrease in the maximum penalty\u201d rule: \u201cPetitioner also argues, in essence, that this Court should simply adopt a rule that any significant increase in a statutory maximum sentence would trigger a constitutional \u2018elements\u2019 requirement. We have explained why we believe the Constitution, as interpreted in McMillan and earlier eases, does not impose that requirement.\u201d 528 U. S., at 247. Whether Almendarez-Torres directly refuted the \u201cincrease in the maximum penalty\u201d rule was extensively debated in Jones, and that debate need not be repeated here. See 526 U. S., at 248-249; id., at 268-270 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). I continue to agree with Justice Kennedy that Almendarez-Torres constituted a clear repudiation of the rule the Court adopts today. See Jones, supra, at 268 (dissenting opinion). My understanding is bolstered by Monge v. California, a decision relegated to a footnote by the Court today. In Monge, in reasoning essential to our holding, we reiterated that \u201cthe Court has rejected an absolute rule that an enhancement constitutes an element of the offense any time that it increases the maximum sentence to which a defendant is exposed.\u201d 524 U. S., at 729 (citing Almendarez-Torres). At the very least, Monge demonstrates that Almendarez-Torres was not an \u201cexceptional departure\u201d from \u201chistoric practice.\u201d Ante, at 487.\nOf all the decisions that refute the Court\u2019s \u201cincrease in the maximum penalty\u201d rule, perhaps none is as important as Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990). There, a jury found Walton, the petitioner, guilty of first-degree murder. Under Arizona law, a trial court conducts a separate sentencing hearing to determine whether a defendant convicted of first-degree murder should receive the death penalty or life imprisonment. See id., at 643 (citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13-703(B) (1989)). At that sentencing hearing, the judge, rather than the jury, must determine the existence or nonexistence of the statutory aggravating and mitigating factors. See Walton, 497 U. S., at 643 (quoting \u00a7 13-703(B)). The Arizona statute directs the judge to \u201c \u2018impose a sentence of death if the court finds one or more of the aggravating circumstances enumerated in [the statute] and that there are no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency.\u2019\u201d Id., at 644 (quoting \u00a713-703(E)). Thus, under Arizona law, a defendant convicted of first-degree murder can be sentenced to death only if the judge finds the existence of a statutory aggravating factor.\nWalton challenged the Arizona capital sentencing scheme, arguing that the Constitution requires that the jury, and not the judge, make the factual determination of the existence or nonexistence of the statutory aggravating factors. We rejected that contention: \u201c\u2018Any argument that the Constitution requires that a jury impose the sentence of death or make the findings prerequisite to imposition of such a sentence has been soundly rejected by prior decisions of this Court.\u2019\u201d Id., at 647 (quoting Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 745 (1990)). Relying in part on our decisions rejecting challenges to Florida\u2019s capital sentencing scheme, which also provided for sentencing by the trial judge, we added that \u201c \u2018the Sixth Amendment does not require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death be made by the jury.\u2019 \u201d Walton, supra, at 648 (quoting Hildwin v. Florida, 490 U. S. 638, 640-641 (1989) (per curiam)).\nWhile the Court can cite no decision that would require its \u201cincrease in the maximum penalty\u201d rule, Walton plainly rejects it. Under Arizona law, the fact that a statutory aggravating circumstance exists in the defendant\u2019s case \u2018\u201cincreases the maximum penalty for [the] crime\u2019 \u201d of first-degree murder to death. Ante, at 476 (quoting Jones, supra, at 243, n. 6). If the judge does not find the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance, the maximum punishment authorized by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict is life imprisonment. Thus, using the terminology that the Court itself employs to describe the constitutional fault in the New Jersey sentencing scheme presented here, under Arizona law, the judge\u2019s finding that a statutory aggravating circumstance exists \u201cexposes the criminal defendant to a penalty exceeding the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone.\u201d Ante, at 483 (emphasis in original). Even Justice Thomas, whose vote is necessary to the Court\u2019s opinion today, agrees on this point. See ante, at 522 (concurring opinion). If a State can remove from the jury a factual determination that makes the difference between life and death, as Walton holds that it can, it is inconceivable why a State cannot do the same with respect to a factual determination that results in only a 10-year increase in the maximum sentence to which a defendant is exposed.\nThe distinction of Walton offered by the Court today is baffling, to say the least. The key to that distinction is the Court\u2019s claim that, in Arizona, the jury makes all of the findings necessary to expose the defendant to a death sentence. See ante, at 496-497 (quoting Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 257, n. 2 (Scalia, J., dissenting)). As explained above, that claim is demonstrably untrue. A defendant convicted of first-degree murder in Arizona cannot receive a death sentence unless a judge makes the factual determination that a statutory aggravating factor exists. Without that critical finding, the maximum sentence to which the defendant is exposed is life imprisonment, and not the death penalty. Indeed, at the time Walton was decided, the author of the Court\u2019s opinion today understood well the issue at stake. See Walton, 497 U. S., at 709 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\u201c[U]nder Arizona law, as construed by Arizona\u2019s highest court, a first-degree murder is not punishable by a death sentence until at least one statutory aggravating circumstance has been proved\u201d). In any event, the extent of our holding in Walton should have been perfectly obvious from the face of our decision. We upheld the Arizona scheme specifically on the ground that the Constitution does not require the jury to make the factual findings that serve as the \u201c \u2018prerequisite to imposition of [a death] sentence,\u2019\u201d id., at 647 (quoting Clemons, supra, at 745), or \u201c \u2018the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death,\u2019 \u201d Walton, supra, at 648 (quoting Hildwin, supra, at 640-641). If the Court does not intend to overrule Walton, one would be hard pressed to tell from the opinion it issues today.\nThe distinction of Walton offered by Justice Thomas is equally difficult to comprehend. According to Justice Thomas, because the Constitution requires state legislatures to narrow sentencing discretion in the capital punishment context, facts that expose a convicted defendant to a capital sentence may be different from all other facts that expose a defendant to a more severe sentence. See ante, at 522-523. Justice Thomas gives no specific reason for excepting capital defendants from the constitutional protections he would extend to defendants generally, and none is readily apparent. If Justice Thomas means to say that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s restriction on a state legislature\u2019s ability to define capital crimes should be compensated for by permitting States more leeway under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments in proving an aggravating fact necessary to a capital sentence, his reasoning is without precedent in our constitutional jurisprudence.\nIn sum, the Court\u2019s statement that its \u201cincrease in the maximum penalty\u201d rule emerges from the history and case law that it cites is simply incorrect. To make such a claim, the Court finds it necessary to rely on irrelevant historical evidence, to ignore our controlling precedent (e. g., Patterson), and to offer unprincipled and inexplicable distinctions between its decision and previous cases addressing the same subject in the capital sentencing context (e. g., Walton). The Court has failed to offer any meaningful justification for deviating from years of cases both suggesting and holding that application of the \u201cincrease in the maximum penalty\u201d rule is not required by the Constitution.\nII\nThat the Court\u2019s rule is unsupported by the history and ease law it cites is reason enough to reject such a substantial departure from our settled jurisprudence. Significantly, the Court also fails to explain adequately why the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and the jury trial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment require application of its rule. Upon closer examination, it is possible that the Court\u2019s \u201cincrease in the maximum penalty\u201d rule rests on a meaningless formalism that accords, at best, marginal protection for the constitutional rights that it seeks to effectuate.\nAny discussion of either the constitutional necessity or the likely effect of the Court\u2019s rule must begin, of course, with an understanding of what exactly that rule is. As was the case in Jones, however, that discussion is complicated here by the Court\u2019s failure to clarify the contours of the constitutional principle underlying its decision. See Jones, 526 U. S., at 267 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). In fact, there appear to be several plausible interpretations of the constitutional principle on which the Court\u2019s decision rests.\nFor example, under one reading, the Court appears to hold that the Constitution requires that a fact be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt only if that fact, as a formal matter, extends the range of punishment beyond the prescribed statutory maximum. See, e. g., ante, at 490. A State could, however, remove from the jury (and subject to a standard of proof below \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d) the assessment of those facts that define narrower ranges of punishment, within the overall statutory range, to which the defendant may be sentenced. See, e. g., ante, at 494, n. 19. Thus, apparently New Jersey could cure its sentencing scheme, and achieve virtually the same results, by drafting its weapons possession statute in the following manner: First, New Jersey could prescribe, in the weapons possession statute itself, a range of 5 to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment for one who commits that criminal offense. Second, New Jersey could provide that only those defendants convicted under the statute who are found by a judge, by a preponderance of the evidence, to have acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual on the basis of race may receive a sentence greater than 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.\nThe Court\u2019s proffered distinction of Walton v. Arizona suggests that it means to announce a rule of only this limited effect. The Court claims the Arizona capital sentencing scheme is consistent with the constitutional principle underlying today\u2019s decision because Arizona\u2019s first-degree murder statute itself authorizes both life imprisonment and the death penalty. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713-1105(0 (1989). \u201c \u2018[0]nee a jury has found the defendant guilty of all the elements of an offense which carries as its maximum penalty the sentence of death, it may be left to the judge to decide whether that maximum penalty, rather than a lesser one, ought to be imposed.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 497 (emphasis in original) (quoting Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 257, n. 2 (Scalia, J., dissenting)). Of course, as explained above, an Arizona sentencing judge can impose the maximum penalty of death only if the judge first makes a statutorily required finding that at least one aggravating factor exists in the defendant\u2019s case. Thus, the Arizona first-degree murder statute authorizes a maximum penalty of death only in a formal sense. In real terms, however, the Arizona sentencing scheme removes from the jury the assessment of a fact that determines whether the defendant can receive that maximum punishment. The only difference, then, between the Arizona scheme and the New Jersey scheme we consider here \u2014 apart from the magnitude of punishment at stake \u2014 is that New Jersey has not prescribed the 20-year maximum penalty in the same statute that it defines the crime to be punished. It is difficult to understand, and the Court does not explain, why the Constitution would require a state legislature to follow such a meaningless and formalistic difference in drafting its criminal statutes.\nUnder another reading of the Court\u2019s decision, it may mean only that the Constitution requires that a fact be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt if it, as a formal matter, increases the range of punishment beyond that which could legally be imposed absent that fact. See, e. g., ante, at 482-483, 490. A State could, however, remove from the jury (and subject to a standard of proof below \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d) the assessment of those facts that, as a formal matter, decrease the range of punishment below that which could legally be imposed absent that fact. Thus, consistent with our decision in Patterson, New Jersey could cure its sentencing scheme, and achieve virtually the same results, by drafting its weapons possession statute in the following manner: First, New Jersey could prescribe, in the weapons possession statute itself, a range of 5 to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment for one who commits that criminal offense. Second, New Jersey could provide that a defendant convicted under the statute whom a judge finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, not to have acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual on the basis of race may receive a sentence no greater than 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.\nThe rule that Justice Thomas advocates in his concurring opinion embraces this precise distinction between a fact that increases punishment and a fact that decreases punishment. See ante, at 501 (\u201c[A] \u2018crime\u2019 includes every fact that is by law a basis for imposing or increasing punishment (in contrast with a fact that mitigates punishment)\u201d). The historical evidence on which Justice Thomas relies, however, demonstrates both the difficulty and the pure formalism of making a constitutional \u201celements\u201d rule turn on such a difference. For example, the Wisconsin statute considered in Lacy v. State, 15 Wis. *13 (1862), could plausibly qualify as either increasing or mitigating punishment on the basis of the same specified fact. There, Wisconsin provided that the willful and malicious burning of a dwelling house in which \u201cthe life of no person shall have been destroyed\u201d was punishable by 7 to 14 years in prison, but that the same burning at a time in which \u201cthere was no person lawfully in the dwelling house\u201d was punishable by only 3 to 10 years in prison. Wis. Eev. Stat., ch. 165, \u00a71 (1858). Although the statute appeared to make the absence of persons from the affected dwelling house a fact that mitigated punishment, the Wisconsin Supreme Court found that the presence of a person in the affected house constituted an aggravating circumstance. Lacy, supra, at *15-*16. As both this example and the above hypothetical redrafted New Jersey statute demonstrate, see supra, at 540, whether a fact is responsible for an increase or a decrease in punishment rests in the eye of the beholder. Again, it is difficult to understand, and neither the Court nor Justice Thomas explains, why the Constitution would require a state legislature to follow such a meaningless and formalistic difference in drafting its criminal statutes.\nIf either of the above readings is all that the Court\u2019s decision means, \u201cthe Court\u2019s principle amounts to nothing more than chastising [the New Jersey Legislature] for failing to use the approved phrasing in expressing its intent as to how [unlawful weapons possession] should be punished.\u201d Jones, 526 U. S., at 267 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). If New Jersey can, consistent with the Constitution, make precisely the same differences in punishment turn on precisely the same facts, and can remove the assessment of those facts from the jury and subject them to a standard of proof below \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d it is impossible to say that the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments require the Court\u2019s rule. For the same reason, the \u201cstructural democratic constraints\u201d that might discourage a legislature from enacting either of the above hypothetical statutes would be no more significant than those that would discourage the enactment of New Jersey\u2019s present sentence-enhancement statute. See ante, at 490-491, n. 16 (majority opinion). In all three cases, the legislature is able to calibrate punishment perfectly, and subject to a maximum penalty only those defendants whose eases satisfy the sentence-enhancement criterion. As Justice Kennedy explained in Jones, \u201c[n]o constitutional values are served by so formalistic an approach, while its constitutional costs in statutes struck down... are real.\u201d 526 U. S., at 267.\nGiven the pure formalism of the above readings of the Court\u2019s opinion, one suspects that the constitutional principle underlying its decision is more far reaching. The actual principle underlying the Court\u2019s decision may be that any fact (other than prior conviction) that has the effect, in real terms, of increasing the maximum punishment beyond an otherwise applicable range must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e. g., ante, at 494 (\u201c[T]he relevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect\u2014 does the required finding expose the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict?\u201d). The principle thus would apply not only to schemes like New Jersey\u2019s, under which a factual determination exposes the defendant to a sentence beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, but also to all determinate-sentencing schemes in which the length of a defendant\u2019s sentence within the statutory range turns on specific factual determinations (e. g., the federal Sentencing Guidelines). Justice Thomas essentially concedes that the rule outlined in his concurring opinion would require the invalidation of the Sentencing Guidelines. See ante, at 528, n. 11.\nI would reject any such principle. As explained above, it is inconsistent with our precedent and would require the Court to overrule, at a minimum, decisions like Patterson and Walton. More importantly, given our approval of \u2014 and the significant history in this country of \u2014 discretionary sentencing by judges, it is difficult to understand how the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments could possibly require the Court\u2019s or Justice Thomas\u2019 rule. Finally, in light of the adoption of determinate-sentencing schemes by many States and the Federal Government, the consequences of the Court\u2019s and Justice Thomas\u2019 rules in terms of sentencing schemes invalidated by today\u2019s decision will likely be severe.\nAs the Court acknowledges, we have never doubted that the Constitution permits Congress and the state legislatures to define criminal offenses, to prescribe broad ranges of punishment for those offenses, and to give judges discretion to decide where within those ranges a particular defendant\u2019s punishment should be set. See ante, at 481-482. That view accords with historical practice under the Constitution. \u201cFrom the beginning of the Republic, federal judges were entrusted with wide sentencing discretion. The great majority of federal criminal statutes have stated only a maximum term of years and a maximum monetary fine, permitting the sentencing judge to impose any term of imprisonment and any fine up to the statutory maximum.\u201d K. Stith & J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 9 (1998) (footnote omitted). Under discretionary-sentencing schemes, a judge bases the defendant\u2019s sentence on any number of facts neither presented at trial nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. As one commentator has explained:\n\u201cDuring the age of broad judicial sentencing discretion, judges frequently made sentencing decisions on the basis of facts that they determined for themselves, on less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, without eliciting very much concern from civil libertarians.... The sentence in any number of traditional discretionary situations depended quite directly on judicial findings of specific contested facts. . . . Whether because such facts were directly relevant to the judge\u2019s retributionist assessment of how serious the particular offense was (within the spectrum of conduct covered by the statute of conviction), or because they bore on a determination of how much rehabilitation the offender\u2019s character was likely to need, the sentence would be higher or lower, in some specific degree determined by the judge, based on the judge\u2019s factual conclusions.\u201d Lynch, Towards A Model Penal Code, Second (Federal?), 2 Buffalo Grim. L. Rev. 297, 320 (1998) (footnote omitted).\nAccordingly, under the discretionary-sentencing schemes, a factual determination made by a judge on a standard of proof below \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d often made the difference between a lesser and a greater punishment.\nFor example, in Williams v. New York, a jury found the defendant guilty of first-degree murder and recommended life imprisonment. The judge, however, rejected the jury\u2019s recommendation and sentenced Williams to death on the basis of additional facts that he learned through a pre-sentence investigation report and that had neither been charged in an indictment nor presented to the jury. 337 U. S., at 242-245. In rejecting Williams\u2019 due process challenge to his death sentence, we explained that there was a long history of sentencing judges exercising \u201cwide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist [them] in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law.\u201d Id., at 246. Specifically, we held that the Constitution does not restrict a judge\u2019s sentencing decision to information that is charged in an indictment and subject to cross-examination in open court. \u201cThe due process clause should not be treated as a device for freezing the evidential procedure of sentencing in the mold of trial procedure.\u201d Id., at 251.\nUnder our precedent, then, a State may leave the determination of a defendant\u2019s sentence to a judge\u2019s discretionary decision within a prescribed range of penalties. When a judge, pursuant to that sentencing scheme, decides to increase a defendant\u2019s sentence on the basis of certain contested facts, those facts need not be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge\u2019s findings, whether by proof beyond a reasonable doubt or less, suffice for purposes of the Constitution. Under the Court\u2019s decision today, however, it appears that once a legislature constrains judges\u2019 sentencing discretion by prescribing certain sentences that may only be imposed (or must be imposed) in connection with the same determinations of the same contested facts, the Constitution requires that the facts instead be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. I see no reason to treat the two schemes differently. See, e. g., McMillan, 477 U. S., at 92 (\"We have some difficulty fathoming why the due process calculus would change simply because the legislature has seen fit to provide sentencing courts with additional guidance\u201d). In this respect, I agree with the Solicitor General that \u201c[a] sentence that is constitutionally permissible when selected by a court on the basis of whatever factors it deems appropriate does not become impermissible simply because the court is permitted to select that sentence only after making a finding prescribed by the legislature.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 7. Although the Court acknowledges the legitimacy of discretionary sentencing by judges, see ante, at 481-482, it never provides a sound reason for treating judicial factfinding under determinate-sentencing schemes differently under the Constitution.\nJustice Thomas\u2019 attempt to explain this distinction is similarly unsatisfying. His explanation consists primarily of a quotation, in turn, of a 19th-century treatise writer, who contended that the aggravation of punishment within a statutory range on the basis of facts found by a judge \u201c 'is an entirely different thing from punishing one for what is not alleged against him.\u2019\u201d Ante, at 519 (quoting 1 J. Bishop, Commentaries on Law of Criminal Procedure \u00a7 85, p. 54 (rev. 2d ed. 1872)). As our decision in Williams v. New York demonstrates, however, that statement does not accurately describe the reality of discretionary sentencing conducted by judges. A defendant\u2019s actual punishment can be affected in a very real way by facts never alleged in an indictment, never presented to a jury, and never proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In Williams\u2019 case, facts presented for the first time to the judge, for purposes of sentencing alone, made the difference between life imprisonment and a death sentence.\nConsideration of the purposes underlying the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury trial guarantee further demonstrates why our acceptance of judge-made findings in the context of discretionary sentencing suggests the approval of the same judge-made findings in the context of determinate sentencing as well. One important purpose of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury trial guarantee is to protect the criminal defendant against potentially arbitrary judges. It effectuates this promise by preserving, as a constitutional matter, certain fundamental decisions for a jury of one\u2019s peers, as opposed to a judge. For example, the Court has recognized that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee was motivated by the English experience of \u201ccompetition ... between judge and jury over the real significance of their respective roles,\u201d Jones, 526 U. S., at 245, and \u201cmeasures [that were taken] to diminish the juries\u2019 power,\u201d ibid. We have also explained that the jury trial guarantee was understood to provide \u201can inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge. If the defendant preferred the common-sense judgment of a jury to the more tutored but perhaps less sympathetic reaction of the single judge, he was to have it.\u201d Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 156 (1968). Blackstone explained that the right to trial by jury was critically important in criminal eases because of \u201cthe violence and partiality of judges appointed by the crown,. . . who might then, as in France or Turkey, imprison, dispatch, or exile any man that was obnoxious to the government, by an instant declaration, that such is their will and pleasure.\u201d 4 Blackstone, Commentaries, at 343. Clearly, the concerns animating the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury trial guarantee, if they were to extend to the sentencing context at all, would apply with greater strength to a discretionary-sentencing scheme than to determinate sentencing. In the former scheme, the potential for mischief by an arbitrary judge is much greater, given that the judge\u2019s decision of where to set the defendant\u2019s sentence within the prescribed statutory range is left almost entirely to discretion. In contrast, under a determinate-sentencing system, the discretion the judge wields within the statutory range is tightly constrained. Accordingly, our approval of discretionary-sentencing schemes, in which a defendant is not entitled to have a jury make factual findings relevant to sentencing despite the effect those findings have on the severity of the defendant\u2019s sentence, demonstrates that the defendant should have no right to demand that a jury make the equivalent factual determinations under a determinate-sentencing scheme.\nThe Court appears to hold today, however, that a defendant is entitled to have a jury decide, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, every fact relevant to the determination of sentence under a determinate-sentencing scheme. If this is an accurate description of the constitutional principle underlying the Court\u2019s opinion, its decision will have the effect of invalidating significant sentencing reform accomplished at the federal and state levels over the past three decades. Justice Thomas\u2019 rule, as he essentially concedes, see ante, at 523, n. 11, would have the same effect.\nPrior to the most recent wave of sentencing reform, the Federal Government and the States employed indeterminate-sentencing schemes in which judges and executive branch officials (e. g., parole board officials) had substantial discretion to determine the actual length of a defendant\u2019s sentence. See, e. g., U. S. Dept, of Justice, S. Shane-DuBow, A. Brown, & E. Olsen, Sentencing Reform in the United States: History, Content, and Effect 6-7 (Aug. 1985) (hereinafter Shane-DuBow); Report of Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on Criminal Sentencing, Fair and Certain Punishment 11-13 (1976) (hereinafter Task Force Report); A. Dershowitz, Criminal Sentencing in the United States: An Historical and Conceptual Overview, 423 Annals Am. Acad. Pol. & Soe. Sci. 117, 128-129 (1976). Studies of indeterminate-sentencing schemes found that similarly situated defendants often received widely disparate sentences. See, e. g., Shane-Dubow 7; Task Force Report 14. Although indeterminate sentencing was intended to soften the harsh and uniform sentences formerly imposed under mandatory-sentencing systems, some studies revealed that indeterminate sentencing actually had the opposite effect. See, e. g., A. Campbell, Law of Sentencing 13 (1978) (\u201cParadoxically the humanitarian impulse sparking the adoption of indeterminate sentencing systems in this country has resulted in an actual increase of the average criminal\u2019s incarceration term\u201d); Task Force Report 13 (\u201c[T]he data seem to indicate that in those jurisdictions where the sentencing structure is more indeterminate, judicially imposed sentences tend to be longer\u201d).\nIn response, Congress and the state legislatures shifted to determinate-sentencing schemes that aimed to limit judges\u2019 sentencing discretion and, thereby, afford similarly situated offenders equivalent treatment. See, e. g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a71170 (West Supp. 2000). The most well known of these reforms was the federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3551 et seq. In the Act, Congress created the United States Sentencing Commission, which in turn promulgated the Sentencing Guidelines that now govern sentencing by federal judges. See, e. g., United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 1998). Whether one believes the determinate-sentencing reforms have proved successful or not \u2014 and the subject is one of extensive debate among commentators \u2014 the apparent effect of the Court\u2019s opinion today is to halt the current debate on sentencing reform in its tracks and to invalidate with the stroke of a pen three decades\u2019 worth of nationwide reform, all in the name of a principle with a questionable constitutional pedigree. Indeed, it is ironic that the Court, in the name of constitutional rights meant to protect criminal defendants from the potentially arbitrary exercise of power by prosecutors and judges, appears to rest its decision on a principle that would render unconstitutional efforts by Congress and the state legislatures to place constraints on that very power in the sentencing context.\nFinally, perhaps the most significant impact of the Court\u2019s decision will be a practical one \u2014 its unsettling effect on sentencing conducted under current federal and state determinate-sentencing schemes. As I have explained, the Court does not say whether these schemes are constitutional, but its reasoning strongly suggests that they are not. Thus, with respect to past sentences handed down by judges under determinate-sentencing schemes, the Court\u2019s decision threatens to unleash a flood of petitions by convicted defendants seeldng to invalidate their sentences in whole or in part on the authority of the Court\u2019s decision today. Statistics compiled by the United States Sentencing Commission reveal that almost a half-million cases have been sentenced under the Sentencing Guidelines since 1989. See Memorandum from U. S. Sentencing Commission to Supreme Court Library, dated June 8, 2000 (total number of eases sentenced under federal Sentencing Guidelines since 1989) (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). Federal eases constitute only the tip of the iceberg. In 1998, for example, federal criminal prosecutions represented only about 0.4% of the total number of criminal prosecutions in federal and state courts. See National Center for State Courts, A National Perspective: Court Statistics Project (federal and state court filings, 1998), http://www.nese.dni.us/divisions/researeh/csp/ csp98-fsef.html (showing that, in 1998, 57,691 criminal cases were filed in federal court compared to 14,623,830 in state courts) (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s ease file). Because many States, like New Jersey, have determinate-sentencing schemes, the number of individual sentences drawn into question by the Court\u2019s decision could be colossal.\nThe decision will likely have an even more damaging effect on sentencing conducted in the immediate future under current determinate-sentencing schemes. Because the Court fails to clarify the precise contours of the constitutional principle underlying its decision, federal and state judges are left in a state of limbo. Should they continue to assume the constitutionality of the determinate-sentencing schemes under which they have operated for so long, and proceed to sentence convicted defendants in accord with those governing statutes and guidelines? The Court provides no answer, yet its reasoning suggests that each new sentence will rest on shaky ground. The most unfortunate aspect of today\u2019s decision is that our precedents did not foreordain this disruption in the world of sentencing. Rather, our cases traditionally took a cautious approach to questions like the one presented in this case. The Court throws that caution to the wind and, in the process, threatens to east sentencing in the United States into what will likely prove to be a lengthy period of considerable confusion.\nrH 1 \u2014 1\nBecause I do not believe that the Court\u2019s \"increase in the maximum penalty\u201d rule is required by the Constitution, I would evaluate New Jersey\u2019s sentence-enhancement statute, N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a72C:44-3 (West Supp. 2000), by analyzing the factors we have examined in past cases. See, e. g., Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 242-243; McMillan, All U. S., at 86-90. First, the New Jersey statute does not shift the burden of proof on an essential ingredient of the offense by presuming that ingredient upon proof of other elements of the offense. See, e. g., id., at 86-87; Patterson, 432 U. S., at 215. Second, the magnitude of the New Jersey sentence enhancement, as applied in petitioner\u2019s case, is constitutionally permissible. Under New Jersey law, the weapons possession offense to which petitioner pleaded guilty carries a sentence range of 5 to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2C:39-4(a), 2C:43-6(a)(2) (West 1995). The fact that petitioner, in committing that offense, acted with a purpose to intimidate because of race exposed him to a higher sentence range of 10 to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. \u00a72C:43-7(a)(3). The 10-year increase in the maximum penalty to which petitioner was exposed falls well within the range we have found permissible. See Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 226, 242-243 (approving 18-year enhancement). Third, the New Jersey statute gives no impression of having been enacted to evade the constitutional requirements that attach when a State makes a fact an element of the charged offense. For example, New Jersey did not take what had previously been an element of the weapons possession offense and transform it into a sentencing factor. See McMillan, 477 U. S., at 89.\nIn sum, New Jersey \u201csimply took one factor that has always been considered by sentencing courts to bear on punishment\u201d \u2014 a defendant\u2019s motive for committing the criminal offense \u2014 \u201cand dictated the precise weight to be given that factor\u201d when the motive is to intimidate a person because of race. Id., at 89-90. The Court claims that a purpose to intimidate on account of race is a traditional mens rea element, and not a motive. See ante, at 492-493. To make this claim, the Court finds it necessary once again to ignore our settled precedent. In Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U. S. 476 (1993), we considered a statute similar to the one at issue here. The Wisconsin statute provided for an increase in a convicted defendant\u2019s punishment if the defendant intentionally selected the victim of the crime because of that victim\u2019s race. Id., at 480. In a unanimous decision upholding the statute, we specifically characterized it as providing a sentence enhancement based on the \u201cmotive\u201d of the defendant. See id., at 485 (distinguishing between punishment of defendant\u2019s \u201ccriminal conduct\u201d and penalty enhancement \u201cfor conduct motivated by a discriminatory point of view\u201d (emphasis added)); id., at 484-485 (\u201c[U]nder the Wisconsin statute the same criminal conduct may be more heavily punished if the victim is selected because of his race . . . than if no such motive obtained\u201d (emphasis added)). .That same characterization applies in the ease of the New Jersey statute. As we also explained in Mitchell, the motive for committing an offense has traditionally been an important factor in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence. Id., at 485. New Jersey, therefore, has done no more than what we held permissible in McMillan; it has taken a traditional sentencing factor and dictated the precise weight judges should attach to that factor when the specific motive is to intimidate on the basis of race.\nThe New Jersey statute resembles the Pennsylvania statute we upheld in McMillan in every respect but one. That difference \u2014 that the New Jersey statute increases the maximum punishment to which petitioner was exposed \u2014 does not persuade me that New Jersey \u201csought to evade the constitutional requirements associated with the characterization of a fact as an offense element.\u201d Supra, at 524. There is no question that New Jersey could prescribe a range of 5 to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment as punishment for its weapons possession offense. Thus, as explained above, the specific means by which the State chooses to control judges\u2019 discretion within that permissible range is of no moment. Cf. Patterson, supra, at 207-208 (\u201cThe Due Process Clause, as we see it, does not put New York to the choice of abandoning [the affirmative defense] or undertaking to disprove [its] existence in order to convict of a crime which otherwise is within its constitutional powers to sanction by substantial punishment\u201d). The New Jersey statute also resembles in virtually every respect the federal statute we considered in Almendarez-Torres. That the New Jersey statute provides an enhancement based on the defendant\u2019s motive while the statute in Almendarez-Torres provided an enhancement based on the defendant\u2019s commission of a prior felony is a difference without constitutional importance. Both factors are traditional bases for increasing an offender\u2019s sentence and, therefore, may serve as the grounds for a sentence enhancement.\nOn the basis of our prior precedent, then, I would hold that the New Jersey sentence-enhancement statute is constitutional, and affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey.",

This rule would seem to promote a procedural ideal \u2014 that of juries, not judges, determining the existence of those facts upon which increased punishment tens. But the real world of criminal justice cannot hope to meet any such ideal. It can function only with the help of procedural compromises, particularly in respect to sentencing. And those compromises, which are themselves necessary for the fair functioning of the criminal justice system, preclude implementation of the procedural model that today\u2019s decision reflects. At the very least, the impractical nature of the requirement that the majority now recognizes supports the proposition that the Constitution was not intended to embody it.\nIn modern times, the law has left it to the sentencing judge to find those facts which (within broad sentencing limits set by the legislature) determine the sentence of a convicted offender. The judge\u2019s factfinding role is not inevitable. One could imagine, for example, a pure \u201ccharge offense\u201d sentencing system in which the degree of punishment depended only upon the crime charged (e. g., eight mandatory years for robbery, six for arson, three for assault). But such a system would ignore many harms and risks of harm that the offender caused or created, and it would ignore many relevant offender characteristics. See United States Sentencing Commission, Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements, Part A, at 1.5 (1987) (hereinafter Sentencing Guidelines or Guidelines) (pointing out that a \u201ccharge offense\u201d system by definition would ignore any fact \u201cthat did not constitute [a] statutory elemen[t] of the offens[e] of which the defendant was convicted\u201d). Hence, that imaginary \u201ccharge offense\u201d system would not be a fair system, for it would lack proportionality, i. e., it would treat different offenders similarly despite major differences in the manner in which each committed the same crime.\nThere are many such manner-related differences in respect to criminal behavior. Empirical data collected by the Sentencing Commission make clear that, before the Guidelines, judges who exercised discretion within broad legislatively determined sentencing limits (say, a range of 0 to 20 years) would impose very different sentences upon offenders engaged in the same basic criminal conduct, depending, for example, upon the amount of drugs distributed (in respect to drug crimes), the amount of money taken (in respect to robbery, theft, or fraud), the presence or use of a weapon, injury to a victim, the vulnerability of a victim, the offender\u2019s role in the offense, recidivism, and many other offense-related or offender-related factors. See United States Sentencing Commission, Supplementary Report on the Initial Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements 35-39 (1987) (hereinafter Supplementary Report) (table listing data representing more than 20 such factors); see generally Department of Justice, W. Rhodes & C. Conly, Analysis of Federal Sentencing (May 1981). The majority does not deny that judges have exercised, and, constitutionally speaking, may exercise sentencing discretion in this way.\nNonetheless, it is important for present purposes to understand why judges, rather than juries, traditionally have determined the presence or absence of such sentence-affecting facts in any given case. And it is important to realize that the reason is not a theoretical one, but a practical one. It does not reflect (Justice Sgalia\u2019s opinion to the contrary notwithstanding) an ideal of procedural \u201cfairness,\u201d ante, at 498 (concurring opinion), but rather an administrative need for procedural compromise. There are, to put it simply, far too many potentially relevant sentencing factors to permit submission of all (or even many) of them to a jury. As the Sentencing Guidelines state the matter,\n\u201c[a] bank robber with (or without) a gun, which the robber kept hidden (or brandished), might have frightened (or merely warned), injured seriously (or less seriously), tied up (or simply pushed) a guard, a teller or a customer, at night (or at noon), for a bad (or arguably less bad) motive, in an effort to obtain money for other crimes (or for other purposes), in the company of a few (or many) other robbers, for the first (or fourth) time that day, while sober (or under the influence of drugs or alcohol), and so forth.\u201d Sentencing Guidelines, Part A, at 1.2.\nThe Guidelines note that \"a sentencing system tailored to fit every conceivable wrinkle of each case can become unworkable and seriously compromise the certainty of punishment and its deterrent effect.\u201d Ibid. To ask a jury to consider all, or many, such matters would do the same.\nAt the same time, to require jury consideration of all such factors \u2014 say, during trial where the issue is guilt or innocence \u2014 could easily place the defendant in the awkward (and conceivably unfair) position of having to deny he committed the crime yet offer proof about how he committed it, e. g., \u201cI did not sell drugs, but I sold no more than 500 grams.\u201d And while special postverdict sentencing juries could cure this problem, they have seemed (but for capital cases) not worth their administrative costs. Hence, before the Guidelines, federal sentencing judges typically would obtain relevant factual sentencing information from probation officers\u2019 presentence reports, while permitting a convicted offender to challenge the information\u2019s accuracy at a hearing before the judge without benefit of trial-type evi-dentiary rules. See Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 249-251 (1949) (describing the modern \u201cpractice of individualizing punishments\u201d under which judges often consider otherwise inadmissible information gleaned from probation reports); see also Kadish, Legal Norm and Discretion in the Police and Sentencing Processes, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 904, 915-917 (1962).\nIt is also important to understand how a judge traditionally determined which factors should be taken into account for sentencing purposes. In principle, the number of potentially relevant behavioral characteristics is endless. A judge might ask, for example, whether an unlawfully possessed knife was \u201ca switchblade, drawn or concealed, opened or closed, large or small, used in connection with a car theft (where victim confrontation is rare), a burglary (where confrontation is unintended) or a robbery (where confrontation is intentional).\u201d United States Sentencing Commission, Preliminary Observations of the Commission on Commissioner Robinson\u2019s Dissent 8, n. 3 (May 1,1987). Again, the method reflects practical, rather than theoretical, considerations. Prior to the Sentencing Guidelines, federal law left the individual sentencing judge free to determine which factors were relevant. That freedom meant that each judge, in an effort to tailor punishment to the individual offense and offender, was guided primarily by experience, relevance, and a sense of proportional fairness. Cf. Supplementary Report 16-17 (noting that the goal of the Sentencing Guidelines was to create greater sentencing uniformity among judges, but in doing so the Guidelines themselves had to rely primarily upon empirical studies that showed which factors had proved important to federal judges in the past).\nFinally, it is important to understand how a legislature decides which factual circumstances among all those potentially related to generally harmful behavior it should transform into elements of a statutorily defined crime (where they would become relevant to the guilt or innocence of an accused), and which factual circumstances it should leave to the sentencing process (where, as sentencing factors, they would help to determine the sentence imposed upon one who has been found guilty). Again, theory does not provide an answer. Legislatures, in defining crimes in terms of elements, have looked for guidance to common-law tradition, to history, and to current social need. And, traditionally, the Court has left legislatures considerable freedom to make the element determination. See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 228 (1998); McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 85 (1986).\nBy placing today\u2019s constitutional question in a broader context, this brief survey may help to clarify the nature of today\u2019s decision. It also may explain why, in respect to sentencing systems, proportionality, uniformity, and admin-istrability are all aspects of that basic \u201cfairness\u201d that the Constitution demands. And it suggests my basic problem with the Court\u2019s rule: A sentencing system in which judges have discretion to find senteneing-related factors is a workable system and one that has long been thought consistent with the Constitution; why, then, would the Constitution treat sentencing statutes any differently?\nH-i H-i\nAs Justice Thomas suggests, until fairly recent times many legislatures rarely focused upon sentencing factors. Rather, it appears they simply identified typical forms of antisocial conduct, defined basic \u201ccrimes,\u201d and attached a broad sentencing range to each definition \u2014 leaving judges free to decide how to sentence within those ranges in light of such factors as they found relevant. Ante, at 510-512,518 (concurring opinion). But the Constitution does not freeze 19th-century sentencing practices into permanent law. And dissatisfaction with the traditional sentencing system (reflecting its tendency to treat similar eases differently) has led modern legislatures to write new laws that refer specifically to sentencing factors. See Supplementary Report 1 (explaining that \u201ca growing recognition of the need to bring greater rationality and consistency to penal statutes and to sentences imposed under those statutes\u201d led to reform efforts such as the Federal Sentencing Guidelines).\nLegislatures have tended to address the problem of too much judicial sentencing discretion in two ways. First, legislatures sometimes have created sentencing commissions armed with delegated authority to make more uniform judicial exercise of that discretion. Congress, for example, has created a federal Sentencing Commission, giving it the power to create Guidelines that (within the sentencing range set by individual statutes) reflect the host of factors that might be used to determine the actual sentence imposed for each individual crime. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 994(a); see also United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 1999). Federal judges must apply those Guidelines in typical eases (those that lie in the \u201cheartland\u201d of the crime as the statute defines it) while retaining freedom to depart in atypical eases. Id., eh. 1, pt. A, 4(b).\nSecond, legislatures sometimes have directly limited the use (by judges or by a commission) of particular factors in sentencing, either by specifying statutorily how a particular factor will affect the sentence imposed or by specifying how a commission should use a particular factor when writing a guideline. Such a statute might state explicitly, for example, that a particular factor, say, use of a weapon, recidivism, injury to a victim, or bad motive, \u201cshall\u201d increase, or \u201cmay\u201d increase, a particular sentence in a particular way. See, e. g., McMillan, supra, at 83 (Pennsylvania statute expressly treated \u201cvisible possession of a firearm\u201d as a sentencing consideration that subjected a defendant to a mandatory 5-year term of imprisonment).\nThe issue the Court decides today involves this second kind of legislation. The Court holds that a legislature cannot enact such legislation (where an increase in the maximum is involved) unless the factor at issue has been charged, tried to a jury, and found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt. My question in respect to this holding is, simply, \u201cwhy would the Constitution contain such a requirement\u201d?\nIn light of the sentencing background described in Parts I and II, I do not see how the majority can find in the Constitution a requirement that \u201cany fact\u201d (other than recidivism) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime \u201cmust be submitted to a jury.\u201d Ante, at 490. As Justice O\u2019Con-nor demonstrates, this Court has previously failed to view the Constitution as embodying any such principle, while sometimes finding to the contrary. See Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 239-247; McMillan, supra, at 84-91. The majority raises no objection to traditional pre-Guidelines sentencing procedures under which judges, not juries, made the factual findings that would lead to an increase in an individual offender\u2019s sentence. How does a legislative determination differ in any significant way? For example, if a judge may on his or her own decide that victim injury or bad motive should increase a bank robber\u2019s sentence from 5 years to 10, why does it matter that a legislature instead enacts a statute that increases a bank robber\u2019s sentence from 5 years to 10 based on this same judicial finding?\nWith the possible exception of the last line of Justice Scalia\u2019s concurring opinion, the majority also makes no constitutional objection to a legislative delegation to a commission of the authority to create guidelines that determine how a judge is to exercise sentencing discretion. See also ante, at 523, n. 11 (Thomas, J., concurring) (reserving the question). But if the Constitution permits Guidelines, why does it not permit Congress similarly to guide the exercise of a judge\u2019s sentencing discretion? That is, if the Constitution permits a delegatee (the commission) to exercise senteneing-related rulemaking power, how can it deny the delegator (the legislature) what is, in effect, the same rule-making power?\nThe majority appears to offer two responses. First, it argues for a limiting principle that would prevent a legislature with broad authority from transforming (jury-determined) facts that constitute elements of a crime into (judge-determined) sentencing factors, thereby removing procedural protections that the Constitution would otherwise require. See ante, at 486 (\u201c[Cjonstitutional limits\u201d prevent States from \u201cdefining] away facts necessary to constitute a criminal offense\u201d). The majority\u2019s cure, however, is not aimed at the disease.\nThe same \u201ctransformational\u201d problem exists under traditional sentencing law, where legislation, silent as to sentencing factors, grants the judge virtually unchecked discretion to sentence within a broad range. Under such a system, judges or prosecutors can similarly \u201ctransform\u201d crimes, punishing an offender convicted of one crime as if he had committed another. A prosecutor, for example, might charge an offender with five counts of embezzlement (each subject to a 10-year maximum penalty), while asking the judge to impose maximum and consecutive sentences because the embezzler murdered his employer. And, as part of the traditional sentencing discretion that the majority concedes judges retain, the judge, not a jury, would determine the last-mentioned relevant fact, i. e., that the murder actually occurred.\nThis egregious example shows the problem\u2019s complexity. The source of the problem lies not in a legislature\u2019s power to enact sentencing factors, but in the traditional legislative power to select elements defining a crime, the traditional legislative power to set broad sentencing ranges, and the traditional judicial power to choose a sentence within that range on the basis of relevant offender conduct. Conversely, the solution to the problem lies, not in prohibiting legislatures from enacting sentencing factors, but in sentencing rules that determine punishments on the basis of properly defined relevant conduct, with sensitivity to the need for procedural protections where sentencing factors are determined by a judge (for example, use of a \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard), and invocation of the Due Process Clause where the history of the crime at issue, together with the nature of the facts to be proved, reveals unusual and serious procedural unfairness. Cf. McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88 (upholding statute in part because it \u201cgives no impression of having been tailored to permit the [sentencing factor] to be a tail which wags the dog of the substantive offense\u201d).\nSecond, the majority, in support of its constitutional rule, emphasizes the concept of a statutory \u201cmaximum.\u201d The Court points out that a sentencing judge (or a commission) traditionally has determined, and now still determines, sentences within a legislated range capped by a maximum (a range that the legislature itself sets). See ante, at 481-482. I concede the truth of the majority\u2019s statement, but I do not understand its relevance.\nFrom a defendant\u2019s perspective, the legislature\u2019s decision to cap the possible range of punishment at a statutorily prescribed \u201cmaximum\u201d would affect the actual sentence imposed no differently than a sentencing commission\u2019s (or a sentencing judge\u2019s) similar determination. Indeed, as a practical matter, a legislated mandatory \u201cminimum\u201d is far more important to an actual defendant. A judge and a commission, after all, are legally free to select any sentence below a statute\u2019s maximum, but they are not free to subvert a statutory minimum. And, as Justice Thomas indicates, all the considerations of fairness that might support submission to a jury of a factual matter that increases a statutory maximum apply a fortiori to any matter that would increase a statutory minimum. See ante, at 521-522 (concurring opinion). To repeat, I do not understand why, when a legislature authorizes a judge to impose a higher penalty for bank robbery (based, say, on the court\u2019s finding that a victim was injured or the defendant\u2019s motive was bad), a new crime is born; but where a legislature requires a judge to impose a higher penalty than he otherwise would (within a pre-existing statutory range) based on similar criteria, it is not. Cf. Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 246.\nIV\nI certainly do not believe that the present sentencing system is one of \u201cperfect equity,\u201d ante, at 498 (Scalia, J., concurring), and I am willing, consequently, to assume that the majority\u2019s rule would provide a degree of increased procedural protection in respect to those particular sentencing factors currently embodied in statutes. I nonetheless believe that any such increased protection provides little practical help and comes at too high a price. For one thing, by leaving mandatory minimum sentences untouched, the majority\u2019s rule simply encourages any legislature interested in asserting control over the sentencing process to do so by creating those m\u00ednimums. That result would mean significantly less procedural fairness, not more.\nFor another thing, this Court\u2019s case law, prior to Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 243, n. 6 (1999), led legislatures to believe that they were permitted to increase a statutory maximum sentence on the basis of a sentencing factor. See ante, at 529-539 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting); see also, e. g., McMillan, supra, at 84-91 (indicating that a legislature could impose mandatory sentences on the basis of sentencing factors, thereby suggesting it could impose more flexible statutory m\u00e1ximums on same basis). And legislatures may well have relied upon that belief. See, e. g., 21 U. S. C. \u00a7 841(b) (1994 ed. and Supp. III) (providing penalties for, among other things, possessing a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d with intent to distribute it, which sentences vary dramatically depending upon the amount of the drug possessed, without requiring jury determination of the amount); N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a72C:43-6, 2C:43-7, 2C:44-la-f, 2C:44-3 (West 1995 and Supp. 1999-2000) (setting sentencing ranges for crimes, while providing for lesser or greater punishments depending upon judicial findings regarding certain \u201caggravating\u201d or \u201cmitigating\u201d factors); Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 1170 (West Supp. 2000) (similar); see also Cal. Court Rule 420(b) (1996) (providing that \u201c[ejircumstanees in aggravation and mitigation\u201d are to be established by the sentencing judge based on \u201cthe ease record, the probation officer\u2019s report, [and] other reports and statements properly received\u201d).\nAs Justice O\u2019Connor points out, the majority\u2019s rule creates serious uncertainty about the constitutionality of such statutes and about the constitutionality of the confinement of those punished under them. See ante, at 549-552 (dissenting opinion). The few amicus briefs that the Court received in this case do not discuss the impact of the Court\u2019s new rule on, for example, drug crime statutes or state criminal justice systems. This fact, I concede, may suggest that my concerns about disruption are overstated; yet it may also suggest that (despite Jones and given Almendarez-Torres) so absolute a constitutional prohibition is unexpected. Moreover, the rationale that underlies the Court\u2019s rule suggests a principle \u2014 jury determination of all sentencing-related facts \u2014 that, unless restricted, threatens the workability of every criminal justice system (if applied to judges) or threatens efforts to make those systems more uniform, hence more fair (if applied to commissions).\nFinally, the Court\u2019s new rule will likely impede legislative attempts to provide authoritative guidance as to how courts should respond to the presence of traditional sentencing factors. The factor at issue here \u2014 motive\u2014is such a factor. Whether a robber takes money to finance other crimes or to feed a starving family can matter, and long has mattered, when the length of a sentence is at issue. The State of New Jersey has determined that one motive \u2014 racial hatred \u2014 is particularly bad and ought to make a difference in respect to punishment for a crime. That determination is reasonable. The procedures mandated are consistent with traditional sentencing practice. Though additional procedural protections might well be desirable, for the reasons Justice O\u2019Connor discusses and those I have discussed, I do not believe the Constitution requires them where ordinary sentencing factors are at issue. Consequently, in my view, New Jersey\u2019s statute is constitutional.\nI respectfully dissent.",
