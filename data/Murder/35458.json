EVANS,\n                                       Appellant.\n\n\n                              SYLLABUS BY THE COURT\n\n1.\n       Claims alleging a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel are analyzed under the well-established, two-part test established in Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). First, the defendant\nmust demonstrate trial counsel's performance was deficient. To establish deficiency, the\ndefendant must demonstrate counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of\nreasonableness when considering the totality of the circumstances. When scrutinizing\ncounsel's performance, courts must afford a high level of deference and make every effort\nto eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of\ncounsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at\nthe time. If the defendant establishes counsel's deficient performance, the court\ndetermines whether there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel's deficient\nperformance, the outcome of the trial would have been different. A reasonable probability\nis one sufficient to undermine confidence in the trial's outcome.\n\n\n2.\n       When a district court conducts an evidentiary hearing and makes findings of fact\nand conclusions of law in ruling on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the\n                                              1\n\fappellate court reviews the district court's factual findings for substantial competent\nevidence and determines whether those findings support the district court's legal\nconclusions. Appellate courts do not reweigh evidence, pass on the credibility of\nwitnesses, or resolve conflicts in the evidence. When evaluating the district court's legal\nconclusions, the appellate court applies a de novo review standard.\n\n\n        Appeal from Sedgwick District Court; ERIC WILLIAMS, judge. Opinion filed February 25, 2022.\nAffirmed.\n\n\n        Kristen B. Patty, of Wichita, argued the cause and was on the brief for appellant.\n\n\n        Lance J. Gillett, assistant district attorney, argued the cause, and Marc Bennett, district attorney,\nand Derek Schmidt, attorney general, were with him on the brief for appellee.\n\n\nThe opinion of the court was delivered by\n\n\n        STANDRIDGE, J.: In 2018, a jury convicted Brandon T. Evans of first-degree\nmurder, aggravated battery, and criminal possession of a weapon. He filed a posttrial\nmotion alleging his trial counsel was ineffective for several reasons. The district court\ndenied Evans' motion after a hearing. On appeal, Evans argues his convictions should be\nreversed, his sentence should be vacated, and he should be granted a new trial and a new\npretrial immunity hearing because his trial counsel was ineffective by (1) coercing Evans\nand Evans' witnesses to change their testimony about the events leading up to the murder\nand (2) disregarding the firearm expert's testimony regarding the functionality of the\nvictim's gun. But the record shows counsel did not disregard the expert's testimony or\ncoerce Evans or his witnesses to change their testimony. We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\f                                          FACTS\n\n\n       The State charged Evans with first-degree premeditated murder in the shooting\ndeath of Isaac J. Lewis, aggravated battery of A.G., and criminal possession of a weapon\nas a convicted felon. These charges stemmed from an incident that occurred at a private\nafter-hours club in Wichita.\n\n\n       The night of the shooting, Evans, his brothers Justin Arrington and Kennell Evans,\nand Tanesha Thomas went to an after-hours club previously known as Daiquiris.\nSurveillance footage of the club's main entrance/exit shows the group arriving shortly\nafter 1 a.m., getting patted down by club security, and being allowed to enter without\nissue. While there were few people at the club when the group arrived, it became packed\nand loud as the night progressed. Daiquiris had video cameras recording the club's main\nentrance/exit, but there were no video cameras inside the club.\n\n\n       The victim, Lewis, arrived at Daiquiris just a few minutes before 3 a.m.\nSurveillance footage of the club's entrance shows security screened Lewis and turned him\naway. He reappeared at the door at 3:06 a.m. Lewis handed the guard something\u2014the\nsame guard that earlier turned him away\u2014and the guard allowed Lewis to enter. About\nfive minutes later, Lewis left Daiquiris through the same door he entered. The video then\nshows Evans running up behind Lewis and shooting Lewis in the back twice: once in the\nneck and once in the lower left back as Lewis fell forward. The first bullet exited Lewis'\nneck and hit another customer, A.G., in her upper left arm, splintering her humerus. The\nsecond bullet traveled through Lewis' liver and lodged in his heart. After Lewis fell to the\nground, the video shows Evans firing another shot at Lewis before fleeing the scene on\nfoot. That third shot hit the concrete next to Lewis, causing the bullet to fragment and\nleave minor abrasions on Lewis' abdomen.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       Officer Joshua Rounkles responded to the shooting and helped another officer\ntriage Lewis' wounds. As Officer Rounkles was treating Lewis, he discovered a loaded\nblack Ruger LCP .380 caliber handgun on the ground underneath Lewis' buttocks. He\nalso found two spent .40 caliber shell casings near Lewis. Officer Rounkles collected the\ngun and the casings and handed them to another nearby officer. Medical personnel\npronounced Lewis dead at the scene. The coroner later determined the cause of Lewis'\ndeath was multiple gunshot wounds, and the manner of death was a homicide.\n\n\n       Meanwhile, Officer Aric St. Vrain chased Evans on foot after another customer\nidentified him as the possible shooter and described what Evans was wearing. Officer\nPhilip Berger was not on scene at the time of the shooting, but immediately after he\narrived, he helped Officer St. Vrain chase Evans. Both officers saw that Evans had a gun\nin his hand as he was running away from them. After running a short distance away from\nthe club, Evans disappeared behind a building but then reappeared to surrender himself to\nthe officers. While arresting Evans, the officers noticed Evans no longer had a gun and\nbegan searching for it. Officer St. Vrain and another officer later climbed onto the roof of\nthe building Evans disappeared behind and discovered a silver and black Ruger .40\ncaliber Smith & Wesson handgun.\n\n\n       Evans admitted to shooting Lewis but consistently maintained he did so in self-\ndefense and in defense of his family members who were present at Daiquiris that night.\nEvans' trial counsel, Quentin Pittman, pursued both theories. A week before trial, Pittman\nfiled a motion for immunity from prosecution based on these theories. The motion\nalleged Lewis threatened to immediately harm Evans and Evans' family members, Lewis\nbrandished a firearm while making these threats, Evans warned Lewis he would shoot\nLewis if Lewis did not stop threatening them, Lewis said he would kill Evans and Evans'\nfamily, and Evans shot and killed Lewis in self-defense and in defense of his family.\nEvans claimed he should be immune from prosecution based on Kansas' stand-your-\n                                             4\n\fground law because he sincerely believed deadly force was necessary to defend himself\nand his family and because a reasonable person in the same situation would have\nperceived deadly force was necessary.\n\n\n       The district court held a hearing on the motion. Evans took the stand and testified\nabout his confrontation with Lewis inside Daiquiris on the night of the shooting\u2014an\nexchange not caught on camera. Evans said he, his brothers, and Thomas arrived at the\nclub around 1 a.m. A couple hours later, he was at the bar trying to buy a drink when\nLewis approached him in \"an aggressive manner.\" Lewis bumped into Evans a couple\ntimes at the bar to try and get Evans' attention. When Evans turned to face Lewis, Lewis\npulled up his shirt to reveal a gun and told Evans he believed Evans had something to do\nwith Lewis' cousin being shot. Lewis said he was going to kill Evans and Evans' family\nthat night. Lewis then turned around and walked away.\n\n\n       Evans went to find his brothers. He told them they had to leave because Lewis had\na gun. As he and his brothers were heading toward the main exit, Lewis confronted Evans\nagain. Evans testified Lewis pulled out his gun, said he would kill Evans and \"all [Evans']\nfriends,\" and then turned around and headed for the main exit, saying he was going to kill\n\"that motherfucker outside.\" Evans explained that he texted his cousin earlier that night to\ncome to Daiquiris to pick him up. Evans believed his cousin was outside in the parking\nlot waiting for him, and when Lewis said he was going to kill someone outside, Evans\nbelieved Lewis was talking about Evans' cousin. Evans testified he was not sure if Lewis\nstill had the gun in his hand as he was leaving, but Evans quickly grabbed a gun off\nanother unknown customer, followed Lewis to the main exit, and shot Lewis from\nbehind.\n\n\n       On cross-examination, Evans admitted several key points. First, he said he did not\nattempt to get help from any of the security guards inside the club after Lewis threatened\n                                             5\n\fhim the first time. He admitted he did not know if his cousin was outside or not\u2014he only\nhad received a text message before the shooting that his cousin was on his way to\nDaiquiris. Evans acknowledged several people were around when Lewis pulled out his\ngun, but no one tried wrestling the gun away from Lewis, and no one ran to security to\nalert them Lewis had a gun. Evans conceded Lewis did not fire his gun at any point.\nFinally, Evans admitted he intended to kill Lewis when he shot Lewis.\n\n\n      Evans did not call any additional witnesses at the hearing. In denying Evans'\nmotion for immunity from prosecution, the district court found:\n\n\n                \"Looking at all the facts that we have before us, the victim was leaving the club\n      when he was shot. His back was turned to the defendant, the victim was shot directly two\n      times, and fragments hit him from the third shot upon\u2014after he was already on the\n      ground.\n\n\n                \"Weighing all the credibility of the witnesses, we have\u2014other than the\n      defendant's statement himself, we have no corroborating evidence as to any threats that\n      were made to the defendant or his family. Other than, again, the defendant's statements.\n\n\n                \"There were never any reported threats made to the bar staff or law enforcement\n      pursuant to Detective [Michelle] Palmer[, the lead detective,] who reviewed all discovery\n      and reports in this matter.\n\n\n                \"Whether they were inside or outside security staff, no one reported that to the\n      point that it made it in any reports from law enforcement at any time before or after these\n      events.\n\n\n                \"The Court makes a finding, based upon all this information, again, the victim\n      was leaving the premises, had his back turned, did not appear to be making any threats at\n      the time that this occurred. The Court makes a finding that there was no imminent threat\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\f      to the defendant, or anyone else at the time that the victim was shot in the back of the\n      head.\n\n\n              \"Further, the victim and the defendant passed by where the money was taken,\n      passed by where the bar was, there was security just steps\u2014we don't know whether there\n      was security inside to a point that he could have talked to someone but right outside that\n      door there we know there was security, and he did not choose to tell anybody else or seek\n      help at the time he acted and shot the victim at that point.\n\n\n              \"With that being said, again, there was no imminent threat to the defendant by\n      the victim at this point in time.\"\n\n\n      The case proceeded to jury trial the following week. Relevant to this appeal, the\nState called a firearms expert, Roger Michels, to examine both Lewis' and Evans' guns.\nMichels performed a function test on Lewis' gun. He testified:\n\n\n              \"So as received, I had immense difficulty in actuating the slide, so the metal top\n      portion, it was very difficult to pull back. Upon getting it to pull back, it would get stuck\n      in that fully forward position and I would have to kind of hit the back of it to get it to\n      close. There was also an issue with the trigger as received whereas when I pulled on the\n      trigger, it was just going back. It wasn't engaging in anything. With that specific type of\n      firearm, that trigger has a bar connected to it that actually connects to the hammer, which\n      is what causes\u2014which that hammer, when you pull the trigger, when you pull that\n      trigger, that hammer is pulled rearwards and then is released forwards. When I was\n      pulling the trigger that was not happening because that bar was stuck in the lower\n      position and it wasn't engaging. . . .\n\n\n               ....\n\n\n              \"We then continued and took the slide off of the firearm to try to diagnose the\n      issue and upon\u2014and all we could tell there's just a lot of dirt and material buildup. Upon\n      putting that slide back on the firearm, it returned to functioning normal.\"\n\n                                                    7\n\fMichels also testified that he matched the .40 caliber shell casings found near Lewis'\nbody to the gun Evans used.\n\n\n       During the defense's case in chief, Evans called his two brothers and a security\nguard from Daiquiris to testify on his behalf. Arrington testified he was at the bar with\nEvans and witnessed the altercation between Lewis and Evans. He overheard Lewis tell\nEvans that Evans was going to die that night just like \"[Evans'] dead mother.\" Arrington\nsaid Evans blew it off. But then Arrington said he saw Lewis pull out a gun like he was\ngoing to point it at Evans, put the gun away, and then pull the gun out again. Arrington\ntestified Lewis then walked away, and Evans went to get a security guard and look for\ntheir other brother. Arrington clarified he did not witness the shooting, and when he heard\nthe gunshots, he ran out of the club. As he ran out the main exit, he saw Lewis lying on\nthe floor outside the door.\n\n\n       Kennell Evans testified he was near the dance floor\u2014approximately 7 to 8 feet\naway from the bar\u2014when he saw the altercation between Evans and Lewis. He said he\nsaw Lewis \"rush[]\" Evans with his firearm out. Kennell could see the firearm and he\nheard Lewis yell at Evans that he was going to kill Evans. Then Kennell saw Evans walk\ntoward him. Kennell said Evans was \"fearful\" and \"in a panic mode.\" Evans told Kennell\nthey had to leave. When they headed for the main exit, Kennell said Lewis was blocking\nthe door so they could not leave. He said Lewis had the gun in his hand as he was\nwalking out of Daiquiris.\n\n\n       Evans took the stand in his defense. His trial testimony was the same as his\ntestimony from the immunity hearing with a couple of exceptions.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f       The jury returned a guilty verdict on all three counts. The district court set the\nmatter for sentencing and ordered a presentence investigation report. Before sentencing,\nEvans filed a series of pro se motions alleging Pittman was ineffective as trial counsel.\nThe district court agreed to consider two of the claims: (1) Pittman was deficient by\ncoercing Evans and Evans' witnesses to change their stories and by withholding\nexculpatory evidence about Lewis' gun misfiring, and (2) Pittman was allegedly deficient\nby failing to request a competency hearing for Evans. The court appointed Steven Wagle\nto represent Evans on his motion. Wagle filed a separate motion alleging ineffective\nassistance of counsel and incorporating Evans' pro se motions.\n\n\n       The district court held an evidentiary hearing\u2014commonly known as a Van Cleave\nhearing\u2014to consider Evans' claim of constitutionally ineffective legal representation by\ntrial counsel. See State v. Van Cleave, 239 Kan. 117, 119-20, 716 P.2d 580 (1986).\nAfter hearing the evidence, the court held Pittman did not coerce Evans and other\nwitnesses to change their stories or withhold exculpatory evidence about Lewis' gun\nmisfiring. The court then sentenced Evans to life without the possibility of parole for 618\nmonths as to the first-degree murder charge. It further ordered Evans to serve an\nadditional 171 consecutive months on the remaining counts.\n\n\n       Evans timely appealed the denial of his motion alleging ineffective assistance of\ncounsel to this court. We have authority to hear his appeal under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 22-\n3601(b)(4) because Evans was convicted of first-degree murder, an off-grid person\nfelony. We also have jurisdiction under K.S.A. 2020 Supp. 22-3601(b)(3) because he was\nsentenced to life in prison without parole for a minimum of 618 months.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f                                         ANALYSIS\n\n\n       The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees a criminal\ndefendant the right to effective assistance of counsel. State v. Betancourt, 301 Kan. 282,\n306, 342 P.3d 916 (2015). In Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80\nL. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the United States Supreme Court established a two-part test to\ndetermine whether a defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel was violated.\nFirst, the defendant must demonstrate trial counsel's performance was deficient. 301 Kan.\nat 306. To establish deficiency, the defendant must demonstrate counsel's representation\nfell below an objective standard of reasonableness when considering the totality of the\ncircumstances. When scrutinizing counsel's performance, courts must afford a high level\nof deference and make every effort to \"'eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to\nreconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the\nconduct from counsel's perspective at the time.'\" State v. Cheatham, 296 Kan. 417, 431-\n32, 292 P.3d 318 (2013) (quoting Bledsoe v. State, 283 Kan. 81, 90, 150 P.3d 868\n[2007]).\n\n\n       If the defendant establishes counsel's deficient performance, the court determines\nwhether there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel's deficient performance, the\noutcome of the trial would have been different. Betancourt, 301 Kan. at 306; Cheatham,\n296 Kan. at 432. A reasonable probability is one sufficient to undermine confidence in\nthe trial's outcome. 296 Kan. at 432.\n\n\n       The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Evans' ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims. On appeal, we review the district court's factual findings for\nsubstantial competent evidence and determine whether those findings support the district\ncourt's legal conclusions. \"'Substantial competent evidence is that which possesses both\nrelevance and substance and which furnishes a substantial basis in fact from which the\n                                             10\n\fissues can reasonably be resolved.'\" State v. Sanders, 310 Kan. 279, 294, 445 P.3d 1144\n(2019). Appellate courts do not \"'reweigh evidence, pass on the credibility of witnesses,\nor resolve conflicts in the evidence.'\" 310 Kan. at 294. When evaluating the district\ncourt's legal conclusions, we apply a de novo review standard. State v. Harris, 310 Kan.\n1026, 1045, 453 P.3d 1172 (2019); Betancourt, 301 Kan. at 306.\n\n\n       Evans raises two interrelated ineffective assistance of counsel claims: (1) Pittman\ndisregarded the firearm expert's testimony regarding the functionality of Lewis' gun; and\n(2) Pittman coerced Evans and Evans' witnesses to change their original stories that\nLewis pointed the gun at Evans and pulled the trigger, but Lewis' gun misfired. The State\nmaintains Evans failed to preserve his first claim. But because Evans raises the expert\ntestimony issue as part of his coercion argument, we find it properly preserved.\n\n\n1. Pittman did not coerce testimony\n\n\n       We begin our discussion with Evans' coercion claim. At the Van Cleave hearing,\nEvans first called Pittman to testify. Pittman explained when he first met Evans, Evans\nsaid that Lewis fired his gun twice inside the bar, causing Evans to chase after Lewis and\nshoot him. Based on the surveillance video evidence, Pittman said he knew this was not\ntrue. Pittman played the video footage for Evans, which showed Lewis did not fire first\nand no one inside the club reacted to gunfire until after Evans shot Lewis. Pittman told\nEvans if he testified at trial that Lewis fired his gun twice inside the bar, the jury would\nnot believe him because the video evidence contradicted this version of events. Once\nPittman confronted Evans with this video footage, Evans changed his story: Lewis came\nin, brandished his gun to Evans, and threatened Evans. This was the version Evans\ntestified to at the immunity hearing and at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f       Pittman also spoke with Evans' brothers. One brother said Lewis fired shots at\nEvans in the bar. Pittman advised the brother his account did not align with Evans'\nversion of events and contradicted the video evidence. Pittman said he was not coercing\nEvans or the witnesses to lie or change their stories\u2014he was encouraging them to tell the\ntruth based on what the evidence showed.\n\n\n       On cross-examination, Pittman testified he would have been reluctant to put Evans\non the stand to testify Lewis fired his gun twice inside the bar when he knew Evans'\noriginal story contradicted the video footage. But Pittman said if Evans had insisted\nLewis fired his gun twice inside the bar, Pittman would have continued down that road.\nPittman noted, however, that Evans changed his story when Pittman presented him with\nthe contrary video evidence.\n\n\n       On redirect examination, Pittman admitted Evans told him Lewis' gun misfired.\nBut Pittman explained Evans told him this in conjunction with Evans' original story that\nLewis actually fired the gun two times.\n\n\n       Evans also testified. He denied he ever told Pittman that Lewis actually fired the\ngun two times. Evans testified the only story he gave Pittman was that Lewis pulled the\ntrigger, but the gun did not fire, which is why Lewis turned around to leave the club.\nEvans claims Pittman told him if he stuck to this story, the trial judge would not give him\na self-defense instruction. Evans also testified his brothers signed affidavits stating\nPittman insisted they change their stories, but those affidavits were not in his possession\ndue to an issue with the mail.\n\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f       At the end of the hearing, the district court rejected Evans' claim that Pittman\nprovided constitutionally deficient performance based on coercion:\n\n\n       \"It's not coercion to tell the witnesses to tell the truth, and [the] Court makes that finding.\n       The witnesse[s'] testimony or counsel's testimony today was when he met with those\n       witnesses, that's what he told them. They need to tell the truth moving forward, and to\n       which they did. Not changing the story because of the facts changing, they were changing\n       the report to purport with the truth and what the evidence showed.\n\n\n                 \"So the Court finds that these witnesses were not coerced. They were simply told\n       to tell the truth, to which they did. The Court makes a finding that this interaction with\n       witnesses was not ineffective assistance of counsel.\"\n\n\nWithin its decision, the court implicitly found Pittman's testimony more credible than\nEvans' testimony. Appellate courts do not reweigh evidence, reassess witness credibility,\nor resolve conflicting evidence. Sanders, 310 Kan. at 294.\n\n\n       The Van Cleave hearing transcript establishes the district court's findings are\nsupported by substantial competent evidence. Specifically, Pittman testified (1) Evans\ninitially told Pittman that Lewis actually fired his gun twice and, at some point, the gun\nmisfired; (2) Pittman presented the video to Evans, which showed Lewis did not fire first\nand no one inside the club reacted to gunfire until after Evans shot Lewis; (3) Pittman\nencouraged Evans to tell the truth; and (4) Evans changed his story and testified Lewis\nbrandished his gun and threatened Evans, causing Evans to shoot him. Based on the\nfactual finding, supported by substantial competent evidence, that Pittman did not coerce\ntestimony, we affirm the district court's legal conclusion that Pittman's performance was\nnot deficient.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     13\n\f2. Pittman did not disregard the firearm expert's testimony regarding non-functionality\n   of the gun\n\n\n       The State called a firearms expert, Roger Michels, to examine both Lewis' and\nEvans' guns. Michels testified the .380 gun recovered from Lewis' body did not function\nwhen Michels initially examined it. Michels explained there were two problems with the\n.380 gun: (1) the trigger did not engage with the hammer, so it could not fire; and (2) the\ngun was dirty, causing the slide to stick in the open position when pulled back. After\ncleaning and reassembling the firearm, Michels said it functioned normally.\n\n\n       Evans claims Pittman provided deficient performance by disregarding Michels'\ntestimony regarding the non-functionality of Lewis' gun. But Evans concedes Pittman\nspecifically addressed Michels' testimony during closing argument:\n\n\n                \"[Defense counsel:] My client is confronted by Lewis. Lewis has a gun. Lewis\n       has shown him the gun. This is seen by a security guard employed at the club. Lewis\n       escalates the situation. Lewis isn't retreating. Lewis isn't running away. Lewis is going to\n       the parking lot to make good on his threat. He's going to shoot [] Quinn and then he's\n       going to get my client and the rest of his family. Before Lewis can do that, does Brandon\n       shoot him? Of course he does, and under the circumstances, that shooting was justified.\n       Because the harm, the danger, and the gun were all real and they were imminent and\n       Brandon's actions were necessary.\n\n\n                \"But we also heard this, right, Isaac didn't get a shot off. He could have taken\n       him out right then and there. No, he couldn't; right? I don't know if you were paying\n       attention to Mr. Michels titillating information that he gave us earlier this morning, but\n       remember this, unbeknownst to Brandon, what? Isaac couldn't get a shot off; right? His\n       gun wouldn't fire. Roger Michels had to take it apart, had to take the slide off, and put it\n       back on. After he took care of that, it would shoot. It wouldn't shoot before. So the fact\n\n                                                    14\n\f       that Isaac Lewis didn't fire at my client, who knows, maybe he tried to and that gun\n       wasn't fireable. You heard it from their witness, their expert from the KBI. It wouldn't\n       shoot.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       Substantial competent evidence supports a finding that Pittman did not disregard\nMichels' testimony that the .380 gun was non-functional when first examined; rather,\nPittman specifically presented Michels' testimony to the jury without overemphasizing it\nin a manner detrimental to the theories of self-defense. We find no deficiency in Pittman's\nperformance on this claim.\n\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   15\n\f",
