Crim. App.\r\n2002).\u00a0 On appeal, Richardson argues that his reasons for wanting to question\r\nJanuary on Bishop\u2019s statement was to show that January had a motive to slant\r\nhis testimony against Richardson because January disregarded defensive evidence.\u00a0 At the bill of exception, however, Richardson argued, among various other reasons not argued\r\non appeal, that the denial of the admission of Bishop\u2019s statement violated the\r\nright of confrontation \u201cas it put a witness in a witness seat that we can\u2019t\r\nconfront, and that\u2019s James Bishop.\u201d\u00a0 Richardson did not argue that it was to show a motive of\r\nDetective January to slant his testimony.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\ncomplaint on appeal does not comport with the complaint raised at trial.\u00a0 Thus, Richardson\u2019s first issue is overruled.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nhis second issue, Richardson argues the evidence was factually insufficient\r\nto support the punishment verdict because the evidence showed Richardson was acting under the influence of sudden\r\npassion.\u00a0 The jury was instructed on\r\nsudden passion and found that Richardson did not act with sudden passion.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A\r\ndefendant has the burden to prove a sudden passion issue at punishment by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence.\u00a0 Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 19.02(d) (Vernon\r\n2003).\u00a0 Because Richardson is challenging the jury\u2019s rejection of a sudden\r\npassion issue, this Court must then determine whether the jury\u2019s negative\r\nanswer is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to\r\nbe clearly wrong or manifestly unjust.\u00a0 Hernandez v. State, 127 S.W.3d 206, 212\r\n(Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, pet. ref\u2019d);\r\nBumguardner v.
