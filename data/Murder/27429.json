Willett, Circuit Judge:\n          The petition for panel rehearing is GRANTED. We withdraw our\n   prior opinion, Will v. Lumpkin, 970 F.3d 566 (5th Cir. 2020), and substitute\n   the following.\n          Robert Gene Will II was sentenced to death by a Texas jury for the\n   murder of Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Barrett Hill. After his failed direct\n   appeal and state habeas petitions, Will pursued federal habeas relief.

We agree that\n   Will\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was a successive habeas petition, and we affirm the\n   district court. We also affirm the denial of Will\u2019s inherent-prejudice claim, as\n   Will fails to overcome the arduous standard of review in the Anti-Terrorism\n   and Effective Death Penalty Act.\n                                              I\n           Will was found guilty of capital murder in Texas state court and\n   sentenced to death. 1 Will appealed directly to the Texas Court of Criminal\n   Appeals, arguing that the presence of uniformed officers in the courtroom\n   impermissibly prejudiced the jury, but the court disagreed. 2 Will then filed a\n   state habeas petition with the same court on the same grounds. The CCA\n   reached the same conclusion and denied relief. 3\n           Will then filed a federal habeas petition, maintaining his argument\n   about impermissible trial prejudice and adding an argument based on\n   ineffective assistance of trial counsel (and one based on actual innocence\n   claim, not pursued in this appeal). 4 The district court stayed Will\u2019s federal\n\n\n           1\n          For full treatment of Will\u2019s previous proceedings, see Will v.

App. March 29,\n   2006) (per curiam) (unpublished).\n           4\n             We note that Will\u2019s state habeas counsel had Parkinson\u2019s disease at the time he\n   filed this petition. A reviewing doctor testified that \u201cit is probable that [counsel] was\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fCase: 18-70030           Document: 00515612039            Page: 3     Date Filed: 10/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n                                           No. 18-70030\n\n\n   proceedings so he could exhaust the new claims in state court. Will filed a\n   second state habeas petition raising the new claims, which the CCA denied\n   on procedural grounds.\n            Back in federal court, the district court denied Will\u2019s petition because\n   (1) the IATC claim was procedurally defaulted and failed on its merits\n   regardless, and (2) the state court did not err in denying the trial-prejudice\n   claim on the merits. 5\n            Will filed a Rule 59 motion for a new trial and to alter the district\n   court\u2019s judgment; this motion was denied. Will then filed a Rule 60(b)\n   motion for relief from the district court\u2019s judgment. The motion focused on\n   the ineffective assistance of both his trial counsel and state habeas counsel,\n   urging that the latter should excuse the procedural default of his claim about\n   the former. The district court found, however, that Will\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion\n   challenging the procedural-default ruling necessarily implied a challenge to\n   the merits ruling, meaning that the motion was a successive habeas petition.\n   Accordingly, the court denied it for lack of jurisdiction. 6 Will appealed this\n   denial to us. 7\n            But, before we could rule, the Supreme Court decided Martinez v.\n   Ryan, holding that \u201c[i]nadequate assistance of counsel at initial-review\n\n\n\n   mentally impaired by the affects [] of Parkinson\u2019s disease to the degree that it made him\n   unfit to serve in the capacity as habeas counsel for a capital appeal.\u201d\n            5\n                Will, 2010 WL 2179680, at *14\u201324.\n            6\n             Will v.

Sept. 26,\n   2018).\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fCase: 18-70030                 Document: 00515612039           Page: 4       Date Filed: 10/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n                                               No. 18-70030\n\n\n   collateral proceedings may establish cause for a prisoner\u2019s procedural default\n   of a claim of ineffective assistance at trial.\u201d 8 So we remanded Will\u2019s appeal\n   to the district court for (1) reconsideration of the Rule 60(b) motion dismissal\n   in light of this new precedent, and (2) clarification on whether a certificate of\n   appealability should issue on Will\u2019s claims.\n             The district court again denied Will\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, reasoning\n   that, regardless of Martinez, it \u201cis a successive habeas petition which the\n   [c]ourt has no jurisdiction to consider under [AEDPA].\u201d 9 But it also granted\n   Will a COA on two issues: his dismissed Rule 60(b) motion and his denied\n   trial-prejudice claim. 10 Will pursues these claims now, arguing that (1) the\n   Rule 60(b) motion is not an impermissible successive habeas petition because\n   it only attacked the \u201cintegrity of the [underlying] federal habeas\n   proceeding,\u201d and (2) he should be granted habeas relief from the adverse\n   trial-prejudice ruling because the CCA misapplied clearly established federal\n   law or its holding was based on unreasonable factual determinations.\n                                                    II\n             As to Will\u2019s first argument, we review de novo \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s\n   determination that a purported Rule 60(b) motion constitutes a successive \u00a7\n   2254 habeas petition.\u201d 11\n\n\n\n\n             8\n            566 U.S. 1, 9 (2012).

Normally, \u201cRule 60(b) allows a party to seek relief from\n   a final judgment, and request reopening of his case, under\u201d extraordinary\n   circumstances. 13 But in the habeas context, Will\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion runs\n   headlong into AEDPA\u2019s restriction on successive habeas applications. Why?\n   Because we\u2014the federal judiciary\u2014are concerned that petitioners will use\n   Rule 60(b) motions to subvert the statutory framework and get an\n   impermissible second look at their denied habeas claims. 14 So, we must ask,\n   was Will\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion actually an impermissible successive habeas\n\n\n\n\n           12\n                28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n           13\n                Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 528 (2005).\n           14\n                Gilkers, 904 F.3d at 343 (\u201cTo ensure that habeas petitioners do not circumvent\n   these statutory requirements by filing Rule 60(b) motions that are the functional equivalent\n   of unauthorized successive \u00a7 2254 petitions, the Supreme Court set forth several guidelines\n   . . . for determining the circumstances under which a district court may properly consider\n   a Rule 60(b) motion in a \u00a7 2254 habeas proceeding.\u201d); Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532\n   (\u201c[A]lleging that the court erred in denying habeas relief on the merits is effectively\n   indistinguishable from alleging that the movant is, under the substantive provisions of the\n   statutes, entitled to habeas relief.\u201d); see also Leal Garcia v. Quarterman, 573 F.3d 214, 220\n   (5th Cir. 2009) (stating that AEDPA serves as a \u201cgate-keeper by preventing the repeated\n   filing of habeas petitions that attack the prisoner\u2019s underlying conviction\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fCase: 18-70030            Document: 00515612039             Page: 6     Date Filed: 10/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n                                             No. 18-70030\n\n\n   petition in disguise? The answer: yes, if his Rule 60(b) motion contains one\n   or more previously presented habeas claims. 15\n           A habeas claim \u201cis an asserted federal basis for relief from a state\n   court\u2019s judgment of conviction.\u201d 16 \u201cIn most cases, determining whether a\n   Rule 60(b) motion advances one or more \u2018claims\u2019 will be relatively simple\u201d:\n   the motion advances a claim \u201cif it attacks the federal court\u2019s previous\n   resolution of a claim on the merits.\u201d 17 But, as we said in Gilkers, \u201cthere are\n   two circumstances in which a district court may properly consider a Rule\n   60(b) motion in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding: (1) the motion attacks a \u2018defect in the\n   integrity of the federal habeas proceeding\u2019 or (2) the motion attacks a\n   procedural ruling that precluded a merits determination.\u201d 18 \u201cIf the\n   purported Rule 60(b) motion satisfies one of these circumstances,\u201d the\n   motion does not present a habeas claim, and \u201cthe district court may then\n   properly consider [it] under Rule 60(b).\u201d 19\n           This means that we must assess two of the district court\u2019s orders: the\n   order denying Will\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion challenging the denial of habeas\n   relief, plus the denial of habeas relief itself. 20\n\n\n           15\n              Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 530 (stating that \u00a7 2254\u2019s successive petition bar only\n   applies to a petitioner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion if it is an \u201capplication for habeas relief\u201d; a\n   motion applies for habeas relief if it \u201ccontains one or more \u2018claims\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted));\n   Williams v.

But the district court ascertained that a review\n   of the procedural-default conclusion in this case would be fruitless without a\n   review of the order\u2019s other conclusion\u2014that, alternatively, the IATC claim\n   failed on the merits. And a review of the merits would constitute a second or\n   successive habeas petition, beyond the purview of Rule 60(b), and beyond\n   the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 2244. 21 The district court therefore\n   denied Will\u2019s motion as \u201ca successive habeas petition which the [c]ourt has\n   no jurisdiction to consider under AEDPA.\u201d 22\n           On appeal, Will\u2019s briefing predominantly tracks the first circumstance\n   Gilkers discussed, Gonzalez\u2019s \u201cdefect in integrity\u201d prong. Because of the\n   erroneous procedural-default ruling, he argues, the court only briefly\n   addressed the merits of Will\u2019s IATC claim instead of giving it full substantive\n   treatment. Thus, Will argues, his Rule 60(b) motion\u2019s \u201cattack on the district\n   court\u2019s decisionmaking process was procedural,\u201d not merits based, [and] his\n   [] motion is [therefore] not a successive petition.\u201d The State disagrees:\n   Will\u2019s motion impermissibly attacked \u201cthe federal court\u2019s previous\n   resolution of a claim on the merits\u201d no matter how you frame it.\n\n\n\n\n           21\n              Will, 2010 WL 2179680, at *18 (\u201cEven if this Court could consider the substance\n   of Will\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim, he has not shown Strickland prejudice.

If so, the district court\u2019s procedural disposition did\n   not preclude a merits determination and, in turn, Will\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion\n   presents a habeas claim. Because we hold that a full merits analysis in the\n   alternative is a merits determination, the court\u2019s procedural disposition did\n   not \u201cpreclude[] a merits determination.\u201d 26 Therefore, Will\u2019s Rule 60(b)\n   motion\u2014attacking a procedural ruling paired with a merits determination in\n   the alternative\u2014is a successive habeas petition that we lack jurisdiction to\n   consider.\n           Consider Gonzalez. In that seminal case, Justice Scalia reasoned that\n   a motion only presents a habeas claim if, among other things, the motion\n\n\n\n\n           23\n                See, e.g., Will, 2010 WL 2179680, at *14\u201318.\n           24\n               Gilkers, 904 F.3d at 344. Though Will did not focus on this argument, his\n   comprehensive briefing presented this contention, and we review it.

But it\n   went on to analyze Will\u2019s substantive contentions, \u201calternatively den[ying]\n   his Strickland claim on the merits.\u201d 32 Will filed a Rule 60(b) motion for relief\n   from this judgment, urging that the procedural-bar ruling was erroneous.\n   Let\u2019s assume Will\u2019s motion is granted\u2014what happens next?

Therefore, when a court order disposes of a\n   habeas claim on procedural and, in the alternative, substantive grounds, a\n   Rule 60(b) motion contesting this order inherently presents a successive\n   habeas petition.\n           This conclusion finds support in Gonzalez. As we\u2019ve discussed, the\n   Gonzalez Court was concerned with preventing habeas petitioners from using\n   Rule 60(b) motions to circumvent AEDPA\u2019s \u201csuccessive-petition bar.\u201d 35\n   And our ruling today respects the Court\u2019s expressed concern, recently re-\n   expressed in Bannister v.

The juror questionnaires\n   and trial transcript clearly and convincingly establish that at least three jurors\n   actually had \u201cclose ties\u201d to police officers. But we disagree with Will\u2019s\n   conclusion. The CCA\u2019s no-inherent-prejudice decision was not based on this\n   unreasonable determination. Rather, its holding was founded on the lack of\n   evidence of \u201csome type of state action.\u201d 50 Its citation to \u201cno evidence\u201d of\n   law enforcement ties merely bolstered the conclusion it had already\n   reached. 51 In other words, even if the CCA had gotten this factual\n   determination right, its conclusion wouldn\u2019t have changed. As we stated in\n   Jones, whether jurors have close ties to law enforcement officers is irrelevant\n   to an inherent-prejudice claim; such ties only move the needle for actual\n   prejudice. 52 Because the \u201cstate court\u2019s ruling on the [inherent-prejudice]\n\n\n\n   record, which we cannot review, rather than the reasonableness of the court\u2019s factual\n   determinations.\n           49\n                Leal v.

Dugger because, among other things, there is no evidence that any of appellant\u2019s\n   jurors had close ties to law enforcement.\u201d (emphases added)).\n           52\n              Jones, 890 F.3d at 571 (\u201cWe note that the record does not fully support the\n   district court\u2019s assertion that no jurors had friends of relatives who were officers; however,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fCase: 18-70030          Document: 00515612039              Page: 15          Date Filed: 10/22/2020\n\n\n\n\n                                            No. 18-70030\n\n\n   claim . . . was [not] so lacking in justification that there was an error well\n   understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for\n   fairminded disagreement,\u201d habeas relief under our deferential AEDPA\n   standard is improper. 53\n           Will identifies no clearly established law that the CCA misapplied, nor\n   any unreasonable factual determinations on which the court based its\n   holding. Because Will has not met the statutory prerequisites, his habeas\n   claim for inherent prejudice fails here as it did below.\n                                                 IV\n           We AFFIRM the district court across the board.\n\n\n\n\n   this discrepancy does not change the outcome of this case because only inherent prejudice\n   has been alleged.\u201d).\n           53\n                Bobby v.
