Okla.)\n\n               Respondent-Appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                                         ORDER\n\n\nBefore BRORBY, BRISCOE, and MURPHY, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n      This case is before the court on Wanda Jean Allen\u2019s motion to recall the mandate and\n\naccompanying request for a stay of execution. This court previously affirmed the district\n\ncourt\u2019s denial of Allen\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, which petition challenged her\n\nfirst degree murder conviction and resulting death sentence. See Allen v. Massie, No. 98-\n\n6340, 2000 WL 16321 (10th Cir. Jan. 11) (unpublished disposition), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct.\n\n244 (2000). In her motion to recall the mandate, Allen asks this court to reexamine her\n\nclaims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent\n\nopinion in Williams v. Taylor, 120 S. Ct. 1495 (2000). This court construes Allen\u2019s motion\n\fto recall the mandate as an application to file a successive habeas corpus petition, denies the\n\napplication on the ground that it does not satisfy the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b),\n\nand denies Allen\u2019s request for a stay of execution.1\n\n       In a recent decision, the Supreme Court held that a federal court\u2019s power to grant a\n\npetitioner\u2019s motion to recall the mandate in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas case is narrowly\n\nconstrained by the provisions of \u00a7 2244(b). See Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 553-\n\n54 (1998). The Court stated:\n\n              In a \u00a7 2254 case, a prisoner\u2019s motion to recall the mandate on the basis\n       of the merits of the underlying decision can be regarded as a second or\n       successive application for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b). Otherwise, petitioners could\n       evade the bar against relitigation of claims presented in a prior application, \u00a7\n       2244(b)(1), or the bar against litigation of claims not presented in a prior\n       application, \u00a7 2244(b)(2). If the court grants such a motion, its action is\n       subject to AEDPA irrespective of whether the motion is based on old claims\n       (in which case \u00a7 2244(b)(1) would apply) or new ones (in which case \u00a7\n       2244(b)(2) would apply).\n\nId. at 553; see also Gray-Bey v. United States, 209 F.3d 986, 988 (7th Cir. 2000) (holding\n\n\n\n       1\n        Allen\u2019s motion is actually styled as follows: \u201cMOTION TO RECALL THE\nMANDATE, FOR STAY OF EXECUTION, AND FOR EMERGENCY EN BANC\nRECONSIDERATION.\u201d To the extent that Allen\u2019s motion could be construed as a\nrenewed petition for rehearing before either this panel or the en banc court, the petition is\nprecluded by operation of this court\u2019s rules. See 10th Cir. R. 40.3 (\u201cThe court will accept\nonly one petition for rehearing from any party to an appeal. No motion to reconsider the\ncourt\u2019s ruling on a petition for rehearing may be filed.\u201d); 10th Cir. R. 35.1(C) (\u201cThe court\nwill not reconsider either the denial of an en banc petition or an en banc disposition.\u201d).\nAllen previously filed in this court a petition for rehearing with suggestion for rehearing\nen banc. On February 25, 2000, this court entered its order noting that the panel had\nunanimously voted to deny rehearing and that no active judge had called for a poll on the\nsuggestion for rehearing en banc. Accordingly, to the extent that Allen\u2019s petition is\nconstrued as a renewed petition for panel or en banc rehearing, it is hereby rejected.\n\n                                              -2-\n\fthat pursuant to Calderon a petitioner\u2019s \u201cmotion to recall the mandate is effectively an\n\napplication for leave to pursue another collateral attack\u201d and noting that \u201cit would be proper\n\nto recall the mandate only if it is proper to authorize a second or successive collateral attack\u201d\n\npursuant to \u00a7 2244(b)). In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s very specific language in\n                                                                                Calderon,\n\nthis court can grant Allen\u2019s request to recall the mandate only if that request satisfies the\n\nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b).\n\n       In her motion, Allen requests that the court recall the mandate in order to reexamine\n\nher claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\n\nWilliams. To be clear, Allen is not asserting a new factual predicate in support of her claim\n\nof ineffective assistance.2 Instead, she simply asserts that in light of theWilliams decision,\n\nthis court\u2019s previous resolution of her claims is incorrect. Section 2244(b)(1) is clear,\n\nhowever, that \u201c[a] claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under\n\nsection 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.\u201d Accordingly,\n\nAllen is not entitled to file a second or successive \u00a7 2254 habeas petition for the purpose of\n\nrelitigating her claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n       Even assuming that \u00a7 2244(b)(1) did not operate to preclude this court from granting\n\nAllen\u2019s motion, the motion nevertheless fails to satisfy the standard set out in\n\n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A). That section mandates dismissal of a claim not presented in a prior petition\n\nunless \u201cthe applicant shows that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made\n\n\n\n       2\n        For that reason, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B) is not implicated in this case.\n\n                                               -3-\n\fretroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously\n\nunavailable.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A). There is simply nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\ndecision in Williams that even remotely resembles a new rule of constitutional law. Instead,\n\nthe Williams Court merely reaffirmed that all claims of ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nshould be resolved by reference to the well-established rubric set forth in      Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). See Williams, 120 S. Ct. at 1511-12; id. at 1523-24\n\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).\n\n       This court is aware that \u00a7 2244(b) does not foreclose the possibility a federal court\n\ncould recall its mandate sua sponte to reconsider issues raised in a petitioner\u2019s first federal\n\nhabeas petition. See Calderon, 523 U.S. at 554.3 Nevertheless, the Supreme\n\n\n       3\n         It must be noted that a court\u2019s characterization of its action as sua sponte in\nrecalling the mandate does not necessarily control the question of the applicability of the\nAEDPA. In that regard, the Supreme Court has noted as follows:\n                 As a textual matter, \u00a7 2244(b) applies only where the court acts\n        pursuant to a prisoner\u2019s \u201capplication.\u201d This carries implications for cases\n        where a motion to recall the mandate is pending, but the court instead\n        recalls the mandate on its own initiative. Whether these cases are subject to\n        \u00a7 2244(b) depends on the underlying basis of the court\u2019s action. If, in\n        recalling the mandate, the court considers new claims or evidence presented\n        in a successive application for habeas relief, it is proper to regard the\n        court\u2019s action as based on that application. In these cases, \u00a7 2244(b)(2)\n        applies irrespective of whether the court characterizes the action as sua\n        sponte.\n                 In [this] case, however, the Court of Appeals was specific in reciting\n        that it acted on the exclusive basis of [the petitioner\u2019s] first federal habeas\n        petition. The court\u2019s characterization of its action as sua sponte does not, of\n        course, prove this point; had the court considered claims or evidence\n        presented in [the petitioner\u2019s] later filings, its action would have been based\n        on a successive application, and so would be subject to \u00a7 2244(b). But in\n        [this] case the court\u2019s recitation that it acted on the exclusive basis of his\n\n                                              -4-\n\fCourt has held that even when the AEDPA does not apply, a court of appeals\u2019 discretion to\n\nrecall its mandate sua sponte is seriously constrained by the foundational principles\n\n\u201cunderlying our habeas corpus jurisprudence.\u201d Id. Accordingly, \u201cwhere a federal court of\n\nappeals sua sponte recalls its mandate to revisit the merits of an earlier decision denying\n\nhabeas corpus relief to a state prisoner, the court abuses its discretion unless it acts to avoid\n\na miscarriage of justice.\u201d Id. at 558. That standard \u201cis concerned with actual as compared\n\nto legal innocence\u201d of the petitioner, is \u201cnarrow [of] scope,\u201d and is \u201cdemanding in all cases.\u201d\n\nId. at 559 (quotations omitted). See generally id. at 559-566 (explicating rigorousness of\n\n\u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d standard in this context both as applied to the validity of an\n\nunderlying conviction or an attendant death penalty). In the particular context of Allen\u2019s\n\nclaim that her counsel was ineffective for failing to present certain mitigation evidence\n\nduring the penalty phase of the trial, she can satisfy the miscarriage of justice standard only\n\nby showing with \u201cclear and convincing evidence that no reasonable juror would have found\n\n[her] eligible for the death penalty in light of the new evidence.\u201d      Id. at 560 (quotations\n\nomitted). In light of this standard, it is clear that this is not one of those exceedingly rare\n\ncases in which a sua sponte recall of the mandate would be appropriate.\n\n       Allen\u2019s motion to recall the mandate, deemed an application to file a second or\n\n\n\n      first federal petition is not disproved by consideration of matters presented\n      in a later filing. Thus we deem the court to have acted on his first\n      application rather than a successive one. As a result, the court's order\n      recalling its mandate did not contravene the letter of AEDPA.\nCalderon, 523 U.S. at 554.\n\n                                               -5-\n\fsuccessive \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, is hereby DENIED. The accompanying request for a stay\n\nof execution is also DENIED. Allen is reminded that the denial by this court of\n\nauthorization to file a second or successive petition \u201cshall not be appealable and shall not\n\nbe the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n2244(b)(3)(E).\n\n\n                                                  ENTERED FOR THE COURT\n\n                                                  PER CURIAM\n\n\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f",
