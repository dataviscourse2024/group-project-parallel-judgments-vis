STATE OF TENNESSEE\n\n                  Appeal from the Circuit Court for Madison County\n                      No. C-15-264      Donald H. Allen, Judge\n\n\n                No. W2015-02345-CCA-R3-ECN - Filed July 25, 2016\n\n\nIn 1996, a Madison County jury convicted the Petitioner, Danny Ray Lacy, of first degree\nfelony murder during the perpetration of aggravated child abuse, and the trial court\nsentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The Petitioner appealed,\nand this Court affirmed the Petitioner\u201fs conviction and sentence. State v. Lacy, 983\nS.W.2d 686 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997). The Petitioner filed an unsuccessful petition for\nhabeas corpus relief. Danny Ray Lacy v. Cherry Lindamon, Warden, No. M2009-00072-\nCCA-R3-CO, 2009 WL 3029619, at *1 (Tenn. Crim.

The Petitioner then filed this petition for writ of\nerror coram nobis, alleging that the Jackson Police Department possessed exculpatory\nevidence. The coram nobis court dismissed the petition, and, after review, we affirm that\njudgment.\n\n  Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Circuit Court Affirmed\n\nROBERT W.

Earls,\nAssistant District Attorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                        OPINION\n                                         I. Facts\n\n       In our opinion from the Petitioner\u201fs first direct appeal, we summarized the facts\npresented at trial. Those facts showed that the victim\u201fs mother and the Petitioner, who\nwas not the victim\u201fs biological father, were in a relationship. The Petitioner had\n\fpreviously beaten the victim as a form of punishment, which caused the victim\u201fs mother\nto lose custody of him. When the victim was returned to his mother\u201fs care, the victim\u201fs\nmother again began dating the Petitioner. While in the Petitioner\u201fs care, the victim\nsuffered blunt force trauma resulting in his death. The Petitioner testified at trial that the\nvictim fell and hit his head but seemed fine. The jury convicted the Petitioner of felony\nfirst degree murder.\n\n       The Petitioner appealed, and this Court affirmed the Petitioner\u201fs conviction and\nsentence. Lacy, 983 S.W.2d at 686. Later, the Petitioner sought post-conviction relief\nalleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The post-conviction court denied relief, and\nthis Court affirmed. See Danny Ray Lacy v. State, No. W2000-01898-CCA-R3-PC, 2001\nTenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 4341 (Tenn. Crim. App., at Jackson, June 7, 2001), no Tenn. R.\nApp. P. 11 application filed.1\n\n        The Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on November 7, 2008.\nAs grounds for relief, the Petitioner argued: (1) that the trial court failed to properly\ninstruct the jury in two respects, charging second degree murder as a lesser included\noffense and including the definition of \u201cintentional,\u201d and (2) that trial counsel was\nineffective for failing to object to these erroneous instructions. The habeas corpus court\nsummarily dismissed the petition. This Court affirmed, holding that the petition did not\nstate a cognizable claim for habeas corpus relief. Danny Ray Lacy v. State, No. M2009-\n00072-CCA-R3-CO, 2009 WL 3029619, at *2 (Tenn. Crim. App., at Nashville, Sept. 22,\n2009), no Tenn. R. App. P. 11 application filed.\n\n        On September 11, 2015, the Petitioner filed a petition for writ of error coram\nnobis. In it, he alleged that the Jackson Police Department possessed newly discovered\nexculpatory evidence. He asserted that the statute of limitations should be tolled because\nhe only recently received the records showing that this evidence existed. He said that, up\nuntil that time, he had been denied access to the Jackson Police Department\u201fs\ninvestigative file. The Petitioner alleged that the file contained a statement of Virginia\nAnderson, the victim\u201fs grandmother, which contradicted her trial testimony. He attached\nthat statement to his petition. It read:\n\n              [The victim\u201fs mother] brought [the victim] to my house in the\n       afternoon on Saturday. She came back to pick him up around 12 p.m. or\n       1:00 a.m.\n\n              [The victim] played the whole time he was there. There w[ere] no\n       other kids there. He and I went to bed. He talked. He went to sleep before\n\n       1\n           Only the LEXISNEXIS cite is currently available.\n                                                2\n\f       his mother came. When he came to my house he did not have a bruise to\n       his head by his eye. I can\u201ft say about the scratch marks to his neck.\n\n             [The victim\u201fs mother] drove her car to church. She came and got\n       me. We went back to church. After church we took her other grandmother\n       home. She went on home.\n\n              We left the church about 5:30 p.m. Right after we got home the\n       phone rang. I answered the phone. I could not understand what she was\n       saying. Her daddy took the phone. She said something had happened to\n       [the victim]. We drove over there. The ambulance and police were already\n       there.\n\n              I have seen switch marks on [the victim].\n\n              I never heard [the victim] say anything bad about [the Petitioner].\n\nThe Petitioner alleged that this statement would have supported his own testimony that he\ndid not know when the injuries happened and that he did nothing to the victim before his\ndeath.\n\n       The State filed a motion to dismiss, raising the statute of limitations as a defense\nand stating that it had given the Petitioner and his counsel open file discovery as well as\nthe name and location of all witnesses before trial.\n\n        The coram nobis court dismissed the petition, finding that it was time-barred. It\nstated that the allegedly exculpatory evidence was not \u201cnewly discovered\u201d and would not\nhave changed the outcome of the trial. It further found that the statement\u201fs only purpose\nwould have been to impeach Ms. Virginia Anderson\u201fs testimony. It is from this\njudgment that the Petitioner now appeals.\n\n                                        II. Analysis\n\n       On appeal, the Petitioner contends that the coram nobis court erred when it\nsummarily dismissed his petition. He asserts that the State violated Brady v. Maryland,\n373 U.S. 83 (1963), by withholding Ms. Anderson\u201fs statement. He further asserts that\nthe victim\u201fs mother admitted that she hit the victim on the same area that caused his\ndeath, that there was a conflict in the time frame of the alleged injuries, that the victim\u201fs\nmother\u201fs whereabouts on the day of the victim\u201fs death were not factually presented to the\njury, and that our opinion on direct appeal incorrectly stated the material facts. The State\n\n                                             3\n\fcounters that the coram nobis court correctly found that the petition was time-barred and\nmeritless. We agree.\n\n       A writ of error coram nobis is available to a defendant in a criminal prosecution.\nT.C.A. \u00a7 40-26-105(a) (2014). The decision to grant or to deny a petition for the writ of\nerror coram nobis on its merits rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. Harris\nv. State, 301 S.W.3d 141, 144 (Tenn. 2010) (citing State v. Vasques, 221 S.W.3d 514,\n527-28 (Tenn. 2007)). Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-26-105(b) provides, in\npertinent part:\n\n               Upon a showing by the defendant that the defendant was without\n       fault in failing to present certain evidence at the proper time, a writ of error\n       coram nobis will lie for subsequently or newly discovered evidence relating\n       to matters which were litigated at the trial if the judge determines that such\n       evidence may have resulted in a different judgment, had it been presented at\n       the trial.\n\n        A writ of error coram nobis is an \u201cextraordinary procedural remedy,\u201d filling only a\n\u201cslight gap into which few cases fall.\u201d State v. Mixon, 983 S.W.2d 661, 672 (Tenn.\n1999); State v. Workman, 111 S.W.3d 10, 18 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2002). As previously\nnoted by this Court, \u201cthe purpose of this remedy \u201eis to bring to the attention of the [trial]\ncourt some fact unknown to the court, which if known would have resulted in a different\njudgment.\u201f\u201d State v. Hart, 911 S.W.2d 371, 374 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995) (quoting State\nex rel. Carlson v. State, 407 S.W.2d 165, 167 (Tenn. 1996)).\n\n        To establish that he is entitled to a writ of error coram nobis, the Petitioner must\nshow: (a) the grounds and the nature of the newly discovered evidence; (b) why the\nadmissibility of the newly discovered evidence may have resulted in a different judgment\nif the evidence had been admitted at the previous trial; (c) that the Petitioner was without\nfault in failing to present the newly discovered evidence at the appropriate time; and (d)\nthe relief sought. Hart, 911 S.W.2d at 374-75. Affidavits should be filed in support of\nthe petition. Id. at 375.\n\n              The grounds for seeking a petition for writ of error coram nobis are\n       not limited to specific categories, as are the grounds for reopening a post-\n       conviction petition. Coram nobis claims may be based upon any \u201cnewly\n       discovered evidence relating to matters litigated at the trial\u201d so long as the\n       petitioner also establishes that the petitioner was \u201cwithout fault\u201d in failing\n       to present the evidence at the proper time. Coram nobis claims therefore\n       are singularly fact-intensive. Unlike motions to reopen, coram nobis claims\n\n                                              4\n\f       are not easily resolved on the face of the petition and often require a\n       hearing.\n\nHarris v. State, 102 S.W.3d 587, 592-93 (Tenn. 2003). \u201cSimilar to habeas corpus\nhearings, coram nobis evidentiary hearings are not mandated by statute in every case.\u201d\nRichard Hale Austin v. State, No. W2005-02591-CCA-R3-CO, 2006 WL 3626332, at *5\n(Tenn. Crim. App., at Jackson, Dec. 13, 2006), no Tenn. R. App. P. 11 filed. A petition of\neither type \u201c\u201emay be dismissed without a hearing, and without the appointment of counsel\nfor a hearing\u201f\u201d if the petition does not allege facts showing that the petitioner is entitled\nto relief. Id. (quoting State ex rel. Edmondson v. Henderson, 421 S.W.2d 635, 636\n(Tenn. 1967)).\n\n        A petition for a writ of error coram nobis must be filed within one year of the\njudgment becoming final in the trial court. T.C.A. \u00a7 27-7-103. This statute of limitations\n\u201cis computed from the date the judgment of the trial court becomes final, either thirty\ndays after its entry in the trial court if no post-trial motions are filed or upon entry of an\norder disposing of a timely filed post-trial motion.\u201d Harris v. State, 301 S.W.3d 141, 144\n(Tenn. 2010); see Mixon, 983 S.W.2d at 670 (\u201c[W]e reject the contention . . . that the\nstatute does not begin to run until the conclusion of the appeal as of right proceedings.\u201d).\nIn the present case, the judgment became final in 1998. The Petitioner did not file this\npetition for writ of error coram nobis until July 2014, more than fifteen years later.\n\n        The one-year statute of limitations for a petition for writ of error coram nobis may\nbe tolled on due process grounds if a petition seeks relief based upon newly discovered\nevidence of actual innocence. Harris, 301 S.W.3d at 145. In determining whether the\nstatute should be tolled, the court must balance the petitioner\u201fs interest in having a\nhearing with the State\u201fs interest in preventing a claim that is stale and groundless. Id.\nGenerally, \u201cbefore a state may terminate a claim for failure to comply with . . . statutes of\nlimitations, due process requires that potential litigants be provided an opportunity for the\npresentation of claims at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d Burford v.\nState, 845 S.W.2d 204, 208 (Tenn. 1992). The Burford rule requires three steps:\n\n               (1) determine when the limitations period would normally have\n       begun to run; (2) determine whether the grounds for relief actually arose\n       after the limitations period would normally have commenced; and (3) if the\n       grounds are \u201clater arising,\u201d determine if, under the facts of the case, a strict\n       application of the limitations period would effectively deny the petitioner a\n       reasonable opportunity to present the claim.\n\nSands v. State, 903 S.W.2d 299, 301 (Tenn. 1995). As a general rule, the claim at issue\nmust not have existed during the limitations period to trigger due process consideration.\n                                              5\n\fSeals v. State, 23 S.W.3d 272 (Tenn. 2000). Discovery of or ignorance to the existence\nof a claim does not create a \u201clater-arising\u201d claim. See Brown v. State, 928 S.W.2d 453,\n456 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1996); Passarella v. State, 891 S.W.2d 619, 635 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. 1994).\n\n        The State bears the burden of raising the bar of the statute of limitations as an\naffirmative defense. Harris, 102 S.W.3d at 593. This Court has stated that \u201cthe statute of\nlimitations is an affirmative defense which must be specifically pled or it is deemed\nwaived.\u201d Newsome v. State, 995 S.W.2d 129, 133 n.5 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1998).\n\n        In the case under submission, we conclude that the trial court properly determined\nthat the petition was time-barred and that due process considerations did not require a\ntolling of the statute of limitations. The Petitioner\u201fs permission to appeal to the\nTennessee Supreme Court was denied on September 1, 1998. His petition for writ of\nerror coram nobis was filed September 11, 2015. Further, due process does not require\ntolling of the statute of limitations. The State offered the Petitioner open file discovery,\nso he and his attorney had access to Ms. Anderson\u201fs statement before trial. The\nstatement does not offer any exculpatory information, and it would, at best, slightly\nimpeach Ms. Anderson\u201fs trial testimony. The statement certainly does not constitute\nnewly discovered evidence that would warrant error coram nobis relief. The Petitioner is\nnot entitled to relief.\n\n                                     III. Conclusion\n\n      In accordance with the aforementioned reasoning and authorities, we affirm the\ncoram nobis court\u201fs judgment.\n                                             _________________________________\n                                            ROBERT W.
