The trial court determined that\n\nMs. Parker reasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm\n\nwhen Frederick Powell and members of his family accosted her in front of her\n\nhome and Mr. Powell threatened and then spit on her. Nonetheless, the trial court\n\nrejected Ms. Parker\u2019s claim that she was acting in self-defense when, in response to\n\nMr. Powell spitting on her, she spit back on him. The trial court determined that\n\nMs. Parker, although actually and reasonably afraid of Mr. Powell, had acted with\n\na retaliatory motive that defeated her claim of self-defense.\n\n\n\n      We question whether the record evidence supports the trial court\u2019s\n\ndetermination that Ms. Parker\u2019s motivation was purely retributive, but ultimately\n\nconclude that the trial court erred as a matter of law in conducting a separate\n\ninquiry into Ms. Parker\u2019s motive. Under the District\u2019s long-standing common law\n\ntest for self-defense, captured in our standard jury instructions, whether the\n\ngovernment has disproved a claim of self-defense turns on two questions: (1)\n\nwhether a defendant reasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of\n\n\n      1\n          D.C. Code \u00a7 22-404 (a)(1) (2016 Supp.).\n\f                                         3\n\nbodily harm (an inquiry that may be informed, among other things, by motive\n\nevidence presented by the government); and (2) if so, whether the force used was\n\nexcessive. Motive is not separately and additionally considered as a basis for\n\ndisproving a claim of self-defense. In this case, the trial court found that Ms.\n\nParker\u2019s belief she was in imminent danger was reasonable and there was never an\n\nargument that her act of spitting on Mr. Powell constituted excessive force. As\n\nthere was no basis for the trial court to reject Ms. Parker\u2019s claim of self-defense,\n\nwe reverse.\n\n\n\n                                     I. Facts2\n\n\n\n      Early one evening in June 2014, Ms. Parker walked out of her home where\n\nshe lived with her three children. She was about to get into a friend\u2019s car, when she\n\nheard Mr. Powell3 yell from across the street that he \u201cshould go over and smack the\n\nshit out of that bitch.\u201d When Ms. Parker asked to whom he was speaking, Mr.\n\nPowell crossed the street and came onto her property, positioned himself so that he\n\n      2\n         For the narrative of the incident, we primarily rely on Ms. Parker\u2019s\ntestimony which the trial court credited in all material respects.\n      3\n        Ms. Parker had no personal relationship with Mr. Powell, but, more than a\nyear prior to this incident, he and Ms. Parker\u2019s daughter had been romantically\ninvolved.\n\f                                         4\n\nand Ms. Parker were face-to-face, and said, \u201cbitch, you.\u201d            Mr. Powell\u2019s\n\n\u201caggressi[ve]\u201d approach indicated to Ms. Parker that \u201che was trying to fight [her],\u201d\n\nand Mr. Powell asked her \u201cdo you want that smoke,\u201d a question Ms. Parker\n\nunderstood as a threat to shoot her.\n\n\n\n      Mr. Powell\u2019s mother crossed the street with him, and several of his brothers\n\njoined them on Ms. Parker\u2019s property; the family surrounded her friend\u2019s car and\n\nyelled insults at Ms. Parker. They called her a \u201cdirty bitch\u201d and accused her of\n\nbeing \u201chot,\u201d i.e., \u201cworking with the police.\u201d \u201c[T]here were a lot of them,\u201d and Ms.\n\nParker \u201cfear[ed] for [her] life.\u201d\n\n\n\n      When he was less than two feet away from her, Mr. Powell spit in her face.\n\nMs. Parker was \u201creally was scared\u201d once Mr. Powell spit on her, because she\n\n\u201cdidn\u2019t know what he was going to do next.\u201d She spit back.4\n\n\n\n      At about that time, unbeknownst to Ms. Parker,5 a police officer arrived.\n\n      4\n          She also threw an unopened can of soda into \u201cthe middle of the street,\u201d\nwithout hitting Mr. Powell. She explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t throw it at him exactly. I just\nthrew it . . . . I don\u2019t know, I was scared.\u201d\n      5\n         Ms. Parker testified that she did not realize a police officer was on the\nscene until he walked up to her.\n\f                                          5\n\nWhile sitting in his car, the officer saw Mr. Powell face-to-face with Ms. Parker,\n\nsurrounded by approximately ten people,6 all standing near a car and yelling at\n\neach other. The officer could not hear what they were saying, but he saw Ms.\n\nParker spit on Mr. Powell. When he spoke to her at the scene, she explained\n\n(because the officer had not seen the entire encounter and in particular, had not\n\nseen Mr. Powell spit on Ms. Parker) \u201cthat she wouldn\u2019t just spit on him for no\n\nreason, that he spit on her first.\u201d The officer then arrested Ms. Parker for simple\n\nassault.\n\n\n\n      At trial, Mr. Powell did not testify and the government called only one\n\nwitness, the arresting officer. Ms. Parker testified on her own behalf. Ms. Parker\n\nconceded that she spit on Mr. Powell but claimed she was acting in self-defense.\n\nOn direct and cross-examination, Ms. Parker repeatedly testified that she was\n\nafraid of Mr. Powell. On direct, Ms. Parker was asked what she believed was\n\ngoing to happen at the time she spat back at Mr. Powell and she said, \u201cI thought he\n\nwas going to hit me, honestly that was the next thing. I was fearing for my life. . . .\n\nI am scared for my life, like I didn\u2019t know what they w[ere] going to do.\u201d On\n\ncross-examination, she specifically denied being angry: \u201cI wasn\u2019t angry. I was\n\n      6\n         According to the officer, by this time \u201c[h]is family was out. Her family\nwas out . . . .\u201d\n\f                                         6\n\nscared for my life. . . . I was more scared than anything.\u201d In response to a follow-\n\nup question from the court\u2014\u201cWhy is it that you spit in [Mr. Powell\u2019s] face?\u201d\u2014she\n\nexplained, as she had to the police officer, that she had spit on Mr. Powell\n\n\u201c[b]ecause he came on my property and . . . spit on me first.\u201d   Finally, on redirect,\n\nMs. Parker once again explained why she had spit on Mr. Powell:\n\n\n                   It was just that he spit in my face and I felt scared\n             with the way they approached me that day. They\n             approached me in a scary situation. I had a lot of people\n             approach me at one time and I really did not know what I\n             did or what I did wrong for him to say he was going to\n             smack me and walk on to my property and then to spit in\n             my face.\n\n\n      The government argued in closing that it had carried its burden to show that\n\n\u201cthe defendant was not in fear of imminent bodily harm which is the standard of\n\nself-defense.\u201d Instead the government asserted that the evidence established that\n\nMs. Parker was \u201cvery angry,\u201d \u201cindignant,\u201d and \u201coffended by what she states that\n\nthe complainant did to her.\u201d The government further asserted that Ms. Parker had\n\nnot \u201cexpressed a fear of imminent bodily injury. What she has expressed is being\n\nangry at this complainant and not liking this complainant.\u201d The government then\n\nhighlighted Ms. Parker\u2019s testimony that she had spit on Mr. Powell because he spit\n\non her. The defense countered in its closing that there was \u201cabsolutely no reason\n\nor evidence to believe that Ms. Parker wasn\u2019t afraid and, in fact, it is to the\n\f                                           7\n\ncontrary.\u201d \u201c[T]here is evidence and there is testimony that she was actually afraid\n\n. . . and that she had reasonable grounds for that belief.\u201d\n\n\n\n      The trial court, after determining that Ms. Parker\u2019s spitting was an assaultive\n\nact, rejected her claim of self-defense, but not on the ground urged by the\n\ngovernment. Preliminarily, the court \u201cinstruct[ed] [it]self\u201d on the law of self-\n\ndefense and acknowledged that \u201cevery person has the right to use a reasonable\n\namount of force in self-defense if one, she actually believes she is in imminent\n\ndanger of bodily harm and if two, she has reasonable grounds for that belief.\u201d7 The\n\ncourt then found, contrary to the government\u2019s argument, that Ms. Parker did\n\nreasonably believe herself to be in such danger:\n\n\n             I conclude based on this record that Ms. Parker\n             reasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of\n             bodily harm. I think it is a very rich record with respect\n             to her belief of imminent bodily harm and the\n             reasonableness of that belief. She testified entirely\n             credibly with no impeachment at all that amounted to\n             anything except a minor difference in recollection about\n             exactly what the spacing of the complaining witness and\n             Ms. Parker was, that she was walking out of her door to\n             get into her friend\u2019s car and as she was doing nothing\n             more than walking to a car, Mr. Powell who was sitting\n\n      7\n           The court appeared to be reading verbatim from the standard jury\ninstruction on \u201cSelf-Defense\u2014General Considerations.\u201d                Criminal Jury\nInstructions for the District of Columba, No. 9.500 (5th ed. rev. 2014).\n\f                                         8\n\n            nearby on his family\u2019s porch said loudly enough for her\n            to hear, I should go over there and smack the shit out of\n            that bitch, and he then approached her walking across the\n            street like he was going to fight her and he was backed\n            up by his mother who was also saying aggressive things\n            towards Ms. Parker. They were saying such things as,\n            bitch, you hot, which meant that she was working with\n            the police and, you want that smoke, which was a threat\n            to shoot and he got right up in her face and she said, who\n            you talking to, and he said, bitch, you, and she said,\n            whatever, little boy, get out of my face, at which point he\n            spit on her and a half a dozen members of his family\n            were also approaching her and backing him up.\n\n\n      The court also \u201ccredit[ed] Ms. Parker\u2019s testimony that she didn\u2019t realize that\n\nOfficer Bradley was there\u201d and thus did not appreciate she could have asked him\n\nfor help:\n\n\n            It is perfectly believable to me that with people shouting\n            at each other, with her attention focused on what is going\n            on and having been spit on, on having been threatened,\n            on the mother coming across the street and yelling at her\n            also on the back up of the relatives, that she is looking at\n            all of that and everything else that is occurring is\n            somewhere in the background noise and not quite\n            registering for her. So, I don\u2019t think that it detracts from\n            her credibility that the officer was there and she could\n            easily have turned to the officer and said, look what he\n            did and then he would be prosecuted before me for\n            assault instead of her. I accept Ms. Parker\u2019s explanation\n            that she was afraid even though she didn\u2019t get in the car.\n            It is her judgment whether she is at more risk in a\n            confined space than she is out in the open. She had\n            family members to access to her as long as she was out in\n            the open. I am not going to question that judgment and I\n            don\u2019t think it detracts from her testimony that she\n\f                                           9\n\n             actually did fear that she was in imminent danger of\n             bodily harm that she didn\u2019t get into the car. That is a\n             judgment that you make at the time and it was for her to\n             make at that time.\n\n\n      Although the court found that Ms. Parker reasonably believed herself to be\n\nendangered by Mr. Powell and his entourage, the court nonetheless concluded that\n\nMs. Parker\u2019s self-defense claim failed because of what it perceived to be Ms.\n\nParker\u2019s motive in responding to Mr. Powell:\n\n\n                   It is [e]minently reasonable that with those threats\n             and that expressed motivation and that backup she would\n             feel herself in imminent danger and I find that she did,\n             but in order for self-defense to apply she has to use a\n             reasonable amount of force in self-defense.[8] Using a\n             reasonable amount of force is [not9] because she is angry\n             or indignant or outraged or because of injustice, if\n             somebody spits in your face[,] which is what he did, that\n             person deserves to be spit on and should expect to be spit\n             on, [but] that is not self-defense. That is spitting[,] but\n             not for purposes of self-defense[,] and the government\n             has proven on this record that the spitting occurred not\n             for reasons of self-defense but for those other reasons.\n             The government correctly argues that every time Ms.\n             Parker is asked, why did you spit on him, the immediate\n\n      8\n         Here, it appears the court was referring to the standard jury instruction on\n\u201cSelf-Defense\u2014Amount of Force Permissible.\u201d Criminal Jury Instructions for the\nDistrict of Columba, No. 9.501. But the court did not read from this instruction\nverbatim, and thus misapplied it to the facts of this case. See infra p. 26.\n      9\n          It appears that either the court reporter failed to transcribe the word \u201cnot,\u201d\nor that the trial court misspoke.\n\f                                          10\n\n             answer is, because he spit on me, and that was said\n             directly on the scene to the police officer. The answer to\n             the same effect was indeed given to the prosecutor, I spit\n             on him because he spit on me, and I directly asked, why\n             did you spit on him. I spit in his face because he came on\n             my property and he spit on me first and there is street\n             justice in that. That is fine in a sense, in a fairness sense\n             and I will take account of sentencing time but it is not\n             fine when it comes to the law of the District of Columbia\n             because what could have been expected to happen next if\n             that police officer had not been there was that Mr. Powell\n             backed up by his family and surrounding Ms. Parker the\n             way he was and having just been spat on would have\n             made good on some of those threats, not the shoot you\n             threat but the beat the [shit] part of the threat. They had\n             the numbers and they had the anger and they had their\n             expressed motivation.\n\n\n      The court concluded that \u201c[f]or all th[e]se reasons . . . the government ha[d]\n\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Parker committed the offense of simple\n\nassault and did not spit on Mr. Powell as an act of self-defense.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                    II. Analysis\n\n\n\n      When a defendant \u201cpresent[s] any evidence that she acted in self-defense,\u201d\n\nthe government assumes the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that\n\nshe did not. See Williams (Shirley) v. United States, 90 A.3d 1124, 1128 (D.C.\n\n2014). In this case, Ms. Parker argues that the government failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence that she did not act in self-defense when she spit on Mr.\n\f                                        11\n\nPowell. We review sufficiency of the evidence claims de novo. High v. United\n\nStates, 128 A.3d 1017, 1020 (D.C. 2015).10 In so doing, \u201cwe consider all the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the government, according deference to the\n\nfact-finder to weigh the evidence, determine the credibility of the witnesses, and\n\ndraw all justifiable inferences of fact.\u201d Williams (Furl) v. United States, 113 A.3d\n\n554, 560 (D.C. 2015). If we find \u201cno evidence upon which a reasonable mind\n\nmight fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d we must reverse. Id.\n\n\n\n      Here, the trial court credited Ms. Parker\u2019s testimony that she \u201cwas afraid,\u201d\n\nand determined that she subjectively and reasonably believed that she was in\n\nimminent danger of bodily harm from Mr. Powell11 after he and his family\n\n\n      10\n          Sufficiency claims implicate the Due Process Clause, which requires that\n\u201cno person shall be made to suffer the onus of a criminal conviction except upon\nsufficient proof\u2014defined as evidence necessary to convince a trier of fact beyond\na reasonable doubt of the existence of every element of the offense.\u201d Jackson v.\nVirginia, 443 U.S. 307, 316 (1979).\n      11\n          The trial court and Ms. Parker herself described her response to her\nencounter with Mr. Powell in terms of fear. To clarify, fear is an emotion that is\npresumably often experienced by a person who has a right to defend herself. And\nevidence of fear will support a conclusion that that person actually and reasonably\nbelieved that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm. But if a person is\nconfident in her ability to defend herself and does not feel afraid when she is\nplaced in a situation where she actually and reasonably believes that she is in\nimminent danger of bodily harm, she would still have a right to act to prevent that\nharm and later claim self-defense.\n\f                                        12\n\nencircled, insulted, and threatened her, and he spit on her. Nevertheless, the court\n\nconcluded the government had presented sufficient evidence to prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Ms. Parker was not acting in self-defense because it\n\nsomehow discerned that Ms. Parker\u2019s fear and reasonable belief that she was in\n\nimminent danger did not motivate her to spit on Mr. Powell. Instead the court\n\ndetected from the evidence that Ms. Parker was motivated by \u201cang[er],\n\nindigna[tion] or outrage[]\u201d\u2014a desire to impose what the court called \u201cstreet\n\njustice.\u201d\n\n\n\n      As a preliminary matter, we question whether the record supports the court\u2019s\n\nfinding that Ms. Parker acted out of a purely retributive motive. See High, 128\n\nA.3d at 1020 (noting that we defer to the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations\n\nand findings of fact from a bench trial unless they are \u201cplainly wrong or without\n\nevidence to support [them]\u201d (alteration in original)).     The government\u2019s only\n\nwitness, the arresting officer, could not testify to much more than the fact that he\n\nhad seen Ms. Parker spit on Mr. Powell, and he did not attribute any emotion to\n\nher, much less describe her as being angry or indignant. For her part, Ms. Parker\n\nnever indicated that she had the \u201cstreet justice\u201d motive that the court imputed to\n\nher. Moreover, she denied that she was angry, and she was not impeached on this\n\npoint. In short, the record evidence was that Ms. Parker \u201cwas scared for her\n\f                                         13\n\nlife\u201d\u2014the reasonable inference being that she acted upon her reasonable belief that\n\nshe was in imminent danger.\n\n\n\n      The trial court\u2019s contrary motive determination appears to be based entirely\n\non Ms. Parker\u2019s initial explanation to the police officer and her subsequent\n\ntestimony in court that she spit on Mr. Powell because \u201che spit on me first.\u201d12 The\n\ncourt inferred from this explanation that, notwithstanding her credited testimony to\n\nthe contrary, Ms. Parker was \u201cangry or indignant or outraged\u201d and was motivated\n\nto act solely based on these emotions.\n\n\n\n      We are doubtful that Ms. Parker\u2019s admissions that her action was responsive\n\nto Mr. Powell\u2019s initial assault can carry the retributive meaning the court ascribed\n\nto them. It seems more likely that her statement to the police officer\u2014who arrived\n\nin the midst of the incident and whom Ms. Parker did not see until he approached\n\nher to place her under arrest\u2014was made to ensure that the officer understood the\n\nfull sequence of events and, in particular, that she was not the first aggressor.\n\n\n      12\n          The government had highlighted this testimony for the court, but for the\ndistinct purpose of proving that Ms. Parker did not subjectively believe she was in\nimminent danger of bodily harm. Although the government now seeks to defend\nthe trial court\u2019s separate motive analysis, it did not seek to rebut Ms. Parker\u2019s\nclaim of self-defense on this basis at trial.\n\f                                         14\n\nSimilarly, her response to the court\u2019s \u201cwhy\u201d inquiry, taken in context of her\n\nprevious and subsequent expressions of fear, seems more susceptible to a benign\n\ninterpretation that is entirely congruent with her claim of self-defense: to repel the\n\nreasonably perceived danger, she fought fire with fire; she matched one spitting\n\nassault (Mr. Powell\u2019s) with another (hers) to communicate that she would give as\n\ngood as she got and that Mr. Powell should leave her alone. Furthermore, when\n\nconsidered in the context of her fully credited testimony, in which she\n\nunambiguously related her fear of Mr. Powell, it is difficult if not impossible to\n\naccept that Ms. Parker\u2019s he-spit-on-me-first statement alone establishes, beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, that Ms. Parker was motivated solely by a desire to impose\n\n\u201cstreet justice.\u201d13 See Williams (Shirley), 90 A.3d at 1129 n.6 (holding that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s \u201cambiguous statement d[id] not tip the balance of the weight of the\n\nevidence to the extent that it dispel[led] any reasonable doubt\u201d that she was acting\n\n\n\n\n      13\n           Our dissenting colleague asserts that the court\u2019s statements \u201creflect a\nrecognition that what was missing each time from appellant\u2019s explanation of why\nshe spit on [Mr.] Powell was any statement to the effect that she spit on him in an\neffort to protect herself from harm.\u201d Post, at 46 (dissenting opinion). But Ms.\nParker repeatedly made it clear that she was afraid of Mr. Powell. And it was not\nMs. Parker\u2019s burden to prove that she acted in self-defense; it was the\ngovernment\u2019s burden to prove that she did not.\n\f                                          15\n\nin self-defense).14 Instead, at most, the evidence supports only a determination that\n\nMs. Parker was motivated to spit on Mr. Powell by a mixture of fear and anger.15\n\n\n      14\n          In Williams, we held that a defendant\u2019s statement while holding a knife\u2014\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m crazy? I\u2019m going to show you crazy\u201d\u2014was subject to at least \u201ctwo\nreasonable interpretations\u201d: (1) she was \u201cletting others know whom she felt were\nout to do her harm that she was willing to defend herself, even so far as using the\nknife\u201d; or (2) she was making a threat. Id. at 1129 n.6. And thus we held that the\nstatement could not be relied upon by the government to carry its burden to\ndisprove the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.\n      15\n          Evidence that a defendant has mixed emotions, however, will not defeat a\nclaim of self-defense. Again, the proper inquiry is whether the defendant believed\nshe was in imminent danger, not whether she was or was not fearful. See supra\nnote 11. Moreover, as humans rarely experience one emotion at a time, it is only\nto be expected that, in a situation where a person might need to act in self-defense,\nshe will experience some mix of fear and anger or indignation or vindictiveness.\nCf. Brown v. United States, 256 U.S. 335, 343 (1921) (noting that as the common\nlaw of self-defense has evolved over time, \u201cit has tended in the direction of rules\nconsistent with human nature\u201d). Thus, if the government could carry its burden to\ndisprove a claim of self-defense simply by establishing that a defendant who\nactually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger also experienced\nother emotions or had mixed motives, self-defense claims would be severely\ncurtailed, if not eliminated entirely. See People v. Nguyen, 354 P.3d 90, 113 (Cal.\n2015) (\u201c[I]t would be unreasonable to require an absence of any feeling other than\nfear, before [use of force] could be considered justifiable [self-defense].\u201d); State v.\nAdviento, 319 P.3d 1131, 1157 (Haw. 2014) (observing that \u201cactions taken in self-\ndefense may indeed be committed while the defendant is subject to a certain degree\nof terror, resentment, rage or anger\u201d); Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal\nLaw \u00a7 10.4 (c) (2d ed.) (noting that a defendant acting in self-defense \u201cdoes not\nlose the defense because [s]he acts with some less admirable motive in addition to\nthat of defending [her]self,\u201d as in a situation where the defendant also \u201cus[es] force\nupon h[er] adversary because [s]he hates him\u201d). In short, the government will\nprevail over a claim of self-defense only when it proves that the defendant did not\nreasonably believe that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm, see infra p.\n27\u2014not when it proves the defendant reasonably experienced other emotions.\n\f                                          16\n\n\n\n\n      We need not decide whether the trial court made a factfinding error,\n\nhowever, because the trial court\u2019s focus on motive begs a more fundamental\n\nquestion of law: if the government fails to disprove that a defendant reasonably\n\nbelieved that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm, can it still carry its\n\nburden to rebut a claim of self-defense by showing that there was another motive\n\nguiding the defendant\u2019s action? For the reasons discussed below, we conclude\n\nthat, under this court\u2019s long-standing articulation of the two-part test for the\n\ndefense of self-defense captured in our standard jury instructions, it cannot.\n\n\n\n      \u201cThe essence of the self-defense situation is a reasonable and bona fide\n\nbelief of the imminence of . . . bodily harm.\u201d16 Kinard v. United States, 96 F.2d\n\n522, 526 (D.C. Cir. 1938).17 Thus, in numerous cases, this court has acknowledged\n\nthat when a claim of self-defense is raised, the threshold question for the fact finder\n\n      16\n          The requisite level of reasonably perceived danger is different, depending\non whether the defendant employed deadly or nondeadly force: \u201cwhere an\naccused, claiming self-defense, uses deadly force, he must\u2014at the time of the\nincident\u2014actually believe and reasonably believe that he is in imminent peril of\ndeath or serious bodily harm; whereas one utilizing nondeadly force must show\nthat he reasonably believed that [some] harm was imminent.\u201d Ewell v. United\nStates, 72 A.3d 127, 131 (D.C. 2013).\n      17\n           Decisions of the D.C. Circuit prior to February 1, 1971, are binding on\nthis court per M.A.P. v. Ryan, 285 A.2d 310, 312 (D.C. 1971).\n\f                                          17\n\nis whether the government has disproved that the \u201cappellant actually and\n\nreasonably believed that [s]he was in imminent danger of bodily harm.\u201d\n\nHiggenbottom v. United States, 923 A.2d 891, 900 (D.C. 2007).18              And our\n\nstandard jury instruction on self-defense directs that:\n\n\n                     Every person has the right to use a reasonable\n             amount of force in self-defense if (1) s/he actually\n             believes s/he is in imminent danger of bodily harm and if\n             (2) s/he has reasonable grounds for that belief. The\n             question is not whether looking back on the incident you\n             believe that the use of force was necessary. The question\n             is whether [name of the defendant], under the\n             circumstances as they appeared to him/her at the time of\n             the incident, actually believed s/he was in imminent\n             danger of bodily harm, and could reasonably hold that\n             belief.\n\n\nCriminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.500 (5th ed. rev.\n\n\n\n\n      18\n          See also Kittle v.

But distinguishing what constitutes\n\nexcessive force from a \u201creasonable amount of force\u201d is not a wholly objective\n\ninquiry; the factfinder must take into account evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental\n\nstate under the circumstances.

Ewell, 72 A.3d at 130. Again,\n\nthis is reflected in the standard jury instruction entitled \u201cAmount of Force\n\nPermissible,\u201d which explains that a defendant confronting nondeadly force22 may\n\nemploy \u201ca reasonable amount of force\u201d as informed by her subjective assessment\n      20\n          See id. at 391 (\u201cThe right of self-defense, and especially the degree of\nforce the victim is permitted to use to prevent bodily harm, is premised\nsubstantially on the victim\u2019s own reasonable perceptions of what is happening.\u201d).\n      21\n           See also Brown, 256 U.S. at 343 (\u201cDetached reflection cannot be\ndemanded in the presence of an uplifted knife.\u201d); Williams (Shirley), 90 A.3d at\n1128 (\u201c[T]he fact-finder must take into account that the defendant was acting in the\n\u2018heat of the conflict.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Brown, 256 U.S. at 344); Perry v.

The instructions further provide that \u201c[a] person acting in the heat of\n\npassion, . . . does not necessarily lose [her] claim of self-defense by using greater\n\nforce than would seem necessary to a calm mind. In the heat of passion, a person\n\nmay actually and reasonably believe something that seems unreasonable to a calm\n\nmind.\u201d Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.501.C.\n\n\n\n      Under this construct\u2014where the first inquiry is whether a defendant actually\n\nand reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm and the\n\nsecond inquiry is whether, taking this belief into account, she employed excessive\n\nforce\u2014motive is not an additional, separate consideration.23 If the government has\n\n\n      23\n         Our colleague in dissent faults us for relying on \u201ctruncated discussions of\nthe law of self-defense,\u201d post, at 54 (dissenting opinion), but these discussions\ncapture the operative core of our test for self-defense and fully align with our\nstandard jury instructions.\n       By contrast, the dissent seeks to create a new, additional requirement that a\ndefendant must have \u201cbelieved that her action . . . was necessary to save herself.\u201d\nPost, at 42 (dissenting opinion) (brackets omitted) (emphasis added); see also id at\n49\u201350 & n.7, 60\u201361. But the dissent\u2019s separate subjective \u201cnecessity\u201d test has no\nsupport in the decisions of this court. To be sure, the admonition in Holmes v.\n                                                                      (continued\u2026)\n\f                                         21\n\nnot disproved that a defendant actually and reasonably believed she was in\n\nimminent danger of bodily harm, we accept that she acted out of that belief.24 See\n\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\nUnited States, 11 F.2d 569, 574 (D.C. Cir. 1926), that \u201cthe law of self-defense is a\nlaw of necessity,\u201d has been often quoted by this court; but it does not authorize a\ndistinct inquiry into a defendant\u2019s subjective assessment of the necessity or likely\neffectiveness of her actions. Rather, in Holmes (a murder case), the court\nconcluded that the evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to determine that it\nwas not \u201cnecessary\u201d for the defendant to employ deadly force in self-defense,\neither because the \u201cappellant did not believe himself in imminent danger when he\nhanded a weapon to [his co-defendant], requesting him to use it,\u201d or because his\nuse of force to resist a lawful arrest was excessive. Id.\n       All of the cases cited by our dissenting colleague that refer to \u201cnecessity\u201d\nsupport this understanding of the law of self-defense. They discuss necessity either\nin the context of step one of our self-defense test, examining whether the defendant\nreasonably believed he was in imminent danger of bodily harm, see, e.g., Edwards\nv. United States, 721 A.2d 938, 941, 943 (D.C. 1998) (cited post, at 42 n.1\n(dissenting opinion)), or in the context of step two of our self-defense test,\nexamining whether the defendant employed excessive force, see Travers v. United\nStates, 124 A.3d 634, 639 (2015); Higgenbottom, 923 A.2d at 900\u201301; McPhaul,\n452 A.2d at 373 n.1. In addition, the dissent cites one case, Potter v. United States,\n534 A.2d 943, 946 (D.C. 1987) (cited post, at 50 (dissenting opinion)), that does\nnot reference \u201cnecessity\u201d at all and conducts a step one analysis to conclude that a\nself-defense instruction should have been given, because a jury could have found\nthat defendant \u201cbelieve[d], reasonably, that he had to throw a brick to fend off\nimminent bodily harm.\u201d The dissent cannot point to a single case where this court\nhas indicated\u2014much less held\u2014that, even where a defendant actually and\nreasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm and employed a\nreasonable amount of force, the government may yet disprove a claim of self-\ndefense on the ground that the defendant did not subjectively believe her use of\nforce was \u201cnecessary to save herself.\u201d In short, the majority opinion is firmly\ngrounded in the law of this jurisdiction; the dissent is not.\n      24\n          In a circumstance where a person actually and reasonably believed that\nshe was in imminent danger of bodily harm, it would be functionally impossible\nfor the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s (actual\n                                                                    (continued\u2026)\n\f                                          22\n\nGaribay v. United States, 634 A.2d 946, 948 (D.C. 1993) (explaining the binary\n\nmotive inquiry by juxtaposing two possible outcomes: \u201ca self-defense claim raises\n\nthe issue of whether the defendant was acting out of an actual and reasonable fear\n\nof imminent bodily harm, or whether, instead, the defendant had some other\n\nmotive and was, in fact, the aggressor\u201d); see also Rink v. United States, 388 A.2d\n\n52, 56 (D.C. 1978) (holding that motive evidence is admissible to address \u201cwhether\n\nappellant reasonably apprehended a danger of imminent, serious bodily harm from\n\nthe deceased\u201d); Flores v. United States, 698 A.2d 474, 482\u201383 (D.C. 1997) (citing\n\nGaribay to allow evidence of prior violent acts to show that defendant was the first\n\naggressor).25 This construct is reflected in our cases assessing sufficiency of the\n\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\nand reasonable) belief was not, at the very least, a significant component of the\nmotivation behind actions that the defendant took. Our dissenting colleague\nconcedes the difficulty, post, at 53 (dissenting opinion), but does not address (on\nthese facts or more generally) how a trial court could possibly determine that the\ngovernment had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant, who actually\nand reasonably believed she was in imminent danger, had a different guiding\nmotive, id.\n      25\n            Conversely, if the defendant is shown not to have actually and\nsubjectively believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm because the\nevidence establishes that the defendant acted solely out of anger or because she had\nan axe to grind, her self-defense claim would fail at the first step. See, e.g., Brown,\n256 U.S. at 344 (noting that, where the defendant and decedent had a contentious\nhistory, the jury might have thought that the defendant \u201chad not sufficient reason to\nthink that his life was in danger at that time, that he exceeded the limits of\nreasonable self defen[s]e or even that he was the attacking party\u201d); Kittle, 65 A.3d\nat 1159 (determining that the complainant\u2019s testimony that his action to restrain\n                                                                        (continued\u2026)\n\f                                          23\n\nevidence challenges:     claims of self-defense rise or fall on determinations of\n\nwhether the defendant reasonably believed herself to be in imminent danger of\n\nbodily harm or used excessive force.26\n\n\n\n      To our knowledge, this court has never held that, despite evidence that the\n\ndefendant actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily\n\nharm, her self-defense claim had been adequately disproved on the ground that the\n\ndefendant had somehow set aside her belief and acted purely out of a different\n\nmotive\u2014e.g., anger or a desire for retribution. The government does not cite to\n\nany such case.27 And notably, neither does our dissenting colleague.28\n\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\ndefendant made him \u201c\u2018mad\u2019 . . . . indicates that appellant did not wish to be held by\n[the complainant], [and] does not establish that appellant was frightened or\nbelieved that he was in imminent harm\u201d so as to provide a basis for a reasonable\ndoubt instruction); Snell, 754 A.2d at 290\u201391 (concluding that, where evidence\nestablished, inter alia, that appellant \u201chad been involved in a prior violent\nconfrontation,\u201d the trial court \u201capplied the relevant standard, namely, that there\nwas evidence upon which a reasonable mind could find beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat appellant did not reasonably believe he was in imminent danger of bodily\nharm\u201d).\n      26\n          Of course, where the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe defendant was \u201cthe [first] aggressor\u201d or \u201cprovoked the conflict upon herself,\u201d\nthe fact-finder need not even reach the core self-defense inquiry. See Criminal\nJury Instructions for the District of Columba, No. 9.504.A.\n      27\n         In its brief, the government asserts that it was \u201cpermissibl[e]\u201d for the trial\ncourt to determine that Ms. Parker\u2019s \u201cdesire to retaliate against Mr. Powell for\n                                                                       (continued\u2026)\n\f                                        24\n\n\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\nspitting on her first\u201d overrode its determination that Ms. Parker subjectively and\nreasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm. But the only\nauthority from this court the government cites for this proposition is Medley v.\nUnited States, 104 A.3d 115 (D.C. 2014). In Medley, we adhered to Garibay and\nreaffirmed that motive evidence\u2014in that case, \u201coutrage\u201d at the victim for giving\ndrugs to the defendant\u2019s girlfriend\u2014is admissible to negate a defendant\u2019s narrative\nthat he was subjectively afraid. Id. at 129. We did not hold, or even suggest, that\nonce the court had concluded that the defendant was subjectively afraid, such\noutrage could be independently considered to establish the defendant\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d\nmotive.\n       The government also cites two unpublished decisions from the intermediate\nappellate court of Kansas (which have no precedential authority even in that\njurisdiction and are not favored for citation under Kansas Supreme Court Rule 7.04\n(f)) where spitting was found, based on the facts alleged, not to be an act of self-\ndefense (while recognizing that there might be factual scenarios where it would\nbe). But in each of these cases, the intermediate appellate court concluded that the\nevidence did not support a determination that the defendants subjectively and\nreasonably believed they were in danger of bodily harm. State v. White, No.\n105,488, 2012 WL 1649841, at *3 (Kan. Ct. App. May 4, 2012) (\u201cThere was no\nneed for [defendant] to defend himself from any imminent use of unlawful force\nwhen he spit on [victim].\u201d); State v. Markou, No. 104,931, 2011 WL 2802408, at\n*2 (Kan. Ct. App. July 15, 2011) (\u201c[Defendant]\u2019s spitting was not done in defense\nof any imminent use of unlawful force.\u201d).\n      28\n          See note 23 supra. Accordingly, our dissenting colleague\u2019s assertion,\npost, at 61 (dissenting opinion), that we are somehow disregarding binding\nprecedent in contravention of M.A.P. v. Ryan, 285 A.2d 310, 312 (D.C. 1971), is\nwithout foundation.    The invocation of M.A.P. v. Ryan is especially confusing\ngiven our dissenting colleague\u2019s concession that \u201cuntil now\u201d this court has never\nbeen confronted with a case where, as here, the question was \u201cwhether the\ndefendant used force that was so predictably ineffectual as to not qualify as force\nthe defendant believed was necessary to protect herself.\u201d Post, at 55 (dissenting\nopinion).\n\f                                        25\n\n      In Ms. Parker\u2019s case, the trial court as the factfinder concluded that Ms.\n\nParker actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily\n\nharm from Mr. Powell. At that point the only question left for the trial court was\n\nwhether Ms. Parker had employed excessive force. Ms. Parker obviously did not\n\nuse more force than was reasonable under the circumstances.29 Thus the court\n\nshould have determined that Ms. Parker acted in self-defense and acquitted her of\n\nassault.\n\n\n\n      But instead of acquitting Ms. Parker, the trial court appeared to misuse the\n\ninquiry into whether Ms. Parker had used \u201ca reasonable amount of force,\u201d to circle\n\nback to Ms. Parker\u2019s motive in responding Mr. Powell\u2019s assault. It is correct that,\n\nin order for a factfinder to determine if a defendant employed excessive force,\n\nconsideration should be given to whether a defendant subjectively perceived a need\n\n      29\n           \u201cOur cases upholding determinations of excessive force \u2018uniformly\ninvolve situations where the secondary, responsive aggression was completely\ndisproportionate to the initial aggression faced.\u2019\u201d Williams, 90 A.3d at 1128\n(quoting Gay v. United States, 12 A.3d 643, 649 (D.C. 2011)). The government\nnever argued at trial that Ms. Parker\u2019s act of spitting back was disproportionate to\nbeing spit upon. To the extent the government now suggests that the act of spitting\nis inherently intemperate and cannot be self-defense as a matter of law, this\ndivision unanimously disagrees. See post, at 48 n.6 (dissenting opinion). We see\nno reason why, when a defendant reasonably believes herself to be in imminent\ndanger, spitting should be distinguished from other types of assaultive conduct,\nparticularly when being spit on is part of the conduct that induces the defendant\u2019s\nbelief.\n\f                                         26\n\nto employ such force to repel the threat. As explained above, however, this\n\nconsideration of the defendant\u2019s subjective perceptions is meant to expand the\n\nboundaries of what constitutes reasonable force, \u201cby tak[ing] into account that the\n\ndefendant was acting in the \u2018heat of conflict.\u2019\u201d Williams, 90 A.3d at 1128. It is not\n\nmeant to authorize a factfinder to separately assess a defendant\u2019s motive in\n\nresponding to a reasonably perceived threat to her safety.30\n\n\n\n      Accordingly, we reaffirm that, when self-defense is raised, the proper\n\ninquiry with respect to a defendant\u2019s mental state (which motive evidence may\n\ninform) is whether she subjectively (and reasonably) believed that she was in\n\nimminent danger of bodily harm. The government bears the burden to prove that a\n\ndefendant did not hold such a belief. Where, as here, the government fails to meet\n\nthat burden\u2014i.e., where it cannot disprove that the defendant subjectively and\n\n\n      30\n          Nor is our concern under the excessive force inquiry the use of too little\nforce. One of the trial court\u2019s reasons for rejecting Ms. Parker\u2019s claim of self-\ndefense, seemingly embraced by our dissenting colleague, post, at 48 n.6\n(dissenting opinion); see also id. at 56\u201359, was because, in the court\u2019s view, Ms.\nParker\u2019s response was so ineffectual, it had no deterrent value and, had the police\nnot been on site, was likely only to have only prompted a more severe response\nfrom Mr. Powell and his family. Again, we do not expect people to be purely\nrational actors in selecting the proper amount of force to use in response to a\nreasonably perceived threat to their safety, and we certainly have no desire to\nencourage individuals to make more aggressive showings of force to ensure they\nhave a legal right to self-defense.\n\f                                            27\n\nreasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm\u2014and also fails to\n\nshow that the defendant employed excessive force, the defendant must prevail on\n\nher self-defense claim.\n\n\n\n                                  III. Conclusion\n\n\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we reverse Ms. Parker\u2019s conviction for simple\n\nassault.\n\n\n\n                                                    So ordered.\n\n\n\n      FERREN, Senior Judge, concurring: I join the opinion of the court and write\n\nseparately only to reinforce it with some additional perspective.\n\n\n\n                                       I.\n\n\n\n      This is a strange case. A man shouts an ugly slur against his neighbor across\n\nthe street as she is getting into a friend\u2019s car. He then crosses the street with\n\nmembers of his family, calls her a \u201cbitch\u201d (and more), and spits in her face as his\n\nfamily surrounds the car and hurls insults. She spits back.          Others arrive\n\f                                         28\n\n(apparently including members of her family), and a shouting match ensues. In the\n\nmeantime, a police officer has appeared in time to see her spit (but not to see her\n\naggressor do so). The officer arrests her for simple assault, and she is charged.\n\n\n\n      In a bench trial the court finds that appellant \u201cactually did fear\u201d and\n\n\u201creasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm,\u201d having\n\ntestified that she was \u201cscared for my life, like I didn\u2019t know what they were going\n\nto do.\u201d But the court disallows her claim of self-defense, concluding that her\n\nprincipal reason for spitting in response to her aggressor\u2019s liquid assault was that\n\n\u201che came on my property and . . . spit on me first\u201d \u2013 words of anger, indignation,\n\nand outrage, said the court, not words of defense against attack. Moreover, the\n\ntrial court appears to believe that mere spitting, while noxious though not\n\nexcessive, was not an authentic defensive move.               The court\u2019s ultimate\n\ncharacterization of her mindset \u2013 that she sought \u201cstreet justice,\u201d not self-\n\nprotection, in spitting back \u2013 summarizes the court\u2019s rejection of self-defense.\n\n\n\n      The issue here, therefore, is whether a victim\u2019s court-established fear of\n\nimminent bodily harm, coupled with non-excessive force \u2013 however weak \u2013 in\n\nresponse, is enough to justify a claim of self-defense; or whether that fear and\n\nresponse, once established without retraction, can be negated by additional\n\f                                           29\n\nfindings that the victim\u2019s dominant mindset was a desire for retribution, and that\n\nthe force used was too lame to evidence either a fearful mindset or an attempt at\n\nself-protection.\n\n\n\n      The theory of the dissent is twofold:\n\n\n             [T]he [1] necessary state-of-mind inquiry is not fully\n             satisfied upon a conclusion that the defendant actually\n             and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of\n             bodily harm, and . . . [2] the self-defense analysis also is\n             not complete upon a further conclusion that the amount\n             of force used was not excessive. Post, at 56.\n\n\nRespectfully, I believe the dissenting theory is flawed.\n\n\n\n      First, it presupposes a threshold trial-court analysis of the defendant\u2019s\n\nmindset that requires a probe of her motives and emotions, even after establishing\n\nher actual and reasonable belief of imminent bodily harm.          According to the\n\ndissent, such a probe, without precedent, can cancel a court\u2019s firm finding of the\n\nlevel of fear that the case law unequivocally says will justify a self-defense\n\ninstruction (absent unreasonable force).\n\n\n\n       Second, the dissent\u2019s theory posits, again without precedent, that the force\n\nused can be so weak that it not only negates any effort for self-protection (thereby\n\f                                          30\n\nnegating a court-established belief of imminent bodily harm) but also negates the\n\n\u201creasonable force\u201d limitation on self-defense by suggesting that an ineffectual\n\nresponse was too weak to be \u201creasonable\u201d \u2013 a limitation that traditionally\n\ndisqualifies only excessive force.\n\n\n\n       Finally, the dissent offers no case law that says a retributive motive\n\nultimately displaces the justification for self-defense even though the trial court has\n\nfound, without qualification, that the defendant actually and reasonably believed\n\nshe was in imminent danger of bodily harm.\n\n\n\n      These concerns require elaboration.\n\n\n\n                                        II.\n\n\n\n      I agree with Judge Easterly that, when evidence supports a claim of self-\n\ndefense, the government has the burden of disproving beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat the defendant (1) actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger\n\nof bodily harm and, in the event of such belief, (2) used only reasonable \u2013 meaning\n\nnon-excessive \u2013 force to repel the attack. Ante, at 16\u201318.\n\f                                           31\n\n      Our dissenting colleague, however, advises that appellant failed to satisfy a\n\nthird step: that despite an unequivocal, conclusive finding that appellant believed\n\nherself to be in imminent danger of bodily harm \u2013 a belief that ordinarily would\n\njustify self-defense (when coupled with reasonable force) \u2013 the government can\n\ndisprove the defense by satisfying the court that an additional motive negated her\n\nbelief, and that the force employed was weak, not defensive.\n\n\n\n      I am not persuaded. In the first place, the dissent does not dispute the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s unequivocal, unmodified first-step finding that appellant \u201creasonably\n\nbelieved\u201d and \u201cactually did fear that she was in danger of imminent bodily harm.\u201d\n\nAnte at 9. Therefore, the dissent\u2019s conclusion that this finding is not enough to\n\njustify a claim of self-defense (absent unreasonable force) must come either (1)\n\nfrom a source outside the two required self-defense findings, or (2) from a second-\n\nstep finding that the force used was not \u201creasonable\u201d; that is, instead of being\n\nexcessive (the traditional ground for unreasonable force), the force of appellant\u2019s\n\nspitting was so unreasonably lame that, along with appellant\u2019s testimony, it\n\nnullified any motive of self-protection.\n\n\n\n      The dissent appears to take both positions. On the one hand, the dissent says\n\nthe opinion for the court \u201cfail[s] to give due attention to the lead-in clause that\n\f                                          32\n\ndictates when the \u2018two-part\u2019 test is applicable,\u201d namely, that \u201c[e]very person has\n\nthe right to use a reasonable amount of force in self-defense if\u201d steps one and two\n\nare satisfied. Post, at 51, 51 n.8 (emphasis omitted). This quoted lead-in clause\n\nessentially says no more than that everyone is entitled to self-defense by meeting\n\nthe two requirements for self-defense; it does not give life to an additional criterion\n\nthat would nullify self-defense even when the two specified requirements are\n\nsatisfied.\n\n\n\n       On the other hand, the dissent relies, in the alternative, on appellant\u2019s\n\nspitting \u2013 a \u201cpredictably ineffectual,\u201d \u201ctit-for-tat act[] of retaliation,\u201d post, at 49\n\nn.6, 55 \u2013 to undermine the sufficiency of the trial court\u2019s first-step finding that\n\nappellant\u2019s fear of imminent bodily harm justified self-defense (absent\n\nunreasonable force). Under this approach, the dissent\u2019s source of erosion of that\n\nfirst-step finding has to be the court\u2019s second-step assessment of \u201creasonable\n\nforce.\u201d That is to say, the dissent has to mean that appellant did not \u201cactually\u201d and\n\n\u201creasonably\u201d believe that the weak force used \u2013 her spitting \u2013 would be enough to\n\nprotect her against \u201cimminent bodily harm.\u201d I have problems with this analysis.\n\n\n\n       First, this analysis does not appear in the trial court\u2019s findings, quoted at\nlength in the dissent. Post, at 43\u201346. Although the trial court speculated that\nappellant\u2019s spitting response to her assailant had no deterrent value, ante, at 26\nn.30, the court focused almost exclusively on appellant\u2019s expressed motivation \u2013\n\f                                          33\n\n\u201cstreet justice\u201d; \u201che spit on me first\u201d \u2013 not on a perceived weakness in appellant\u2019s\nresponse as an independent basis for discounting her fearful, step-one mindset.\nThus, absent any assertion that spitting can never count as \u201creasonable force\u201d \u2013\nindeed, the dissent agrees that on occasion it can, post, at 48 n.6 \u2013 I am concerned\nabout appellate court fact-finding to bolster the dissent\u2019s analysis.\n\n\n      Second, according to the government\u2019s brief, the trial court \u2013 unlike the\ndissent \u2013 found that appellant, through her words, was motivated solely \u201cby her\ndesire to retaliate,\u201d a finding inconsistent with the court\u2019s threshold finding that\nappellant had \u201creasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily\nharm.\u201d Post, at 44. Thus, the court never questioned that spitting constituted\nreasonable force under the circumstances, and not even the prosecution has\nespoused the dissent\u2019s reliance on the second-step (reasonable force) inquiry to\ninform the step-one (belief of imminent bodily harm) inquiry.\n\n\n\n       Third, I cannot agree that appellant\u2019s spitting can disqualify her from\nclaiming self-defense because of its presumed weakness as a response to the\nneighbor who spit at her first. Appellant\u2019s response was \u201ca proportionate reaction\nto the threat that [s]he perceived.\u201d1 The trial court\u2019s perception that this response\nwas not a reasonable deterrent to acceleration of the affray, ante, at 26 n.30 \u2013 i.e.,\nthat (in the dissent\u2019s words) the spitting was \u201cpredictably ineffectual,\u201d post, at 55 \u2013\nis supported only by speculation. If it is true (as I believe) that the trial court\u2019s\nstep-one finding entitled appellant to claim self-defense (when coupled with\nreasonable force), I cannot believe, given the absence of supportive case law, that\nineffectual force can be deemed unreasonable simply because it is too lame rather\nthan excessive.\n\n\n\n      Finally, I will assume for sake of argument that a step-two, \u201creasonable\n\nforce\u201d inquiry could inform a step-one, belief-of-imminent bodily harm inquiry \u2013\n\ne.g., that a weak response to an attacker might signal that the defendant did not\n      1\n          Ewell v. United States, 72 A.3d 127, 130 (D.C. 2013).\n\f                                         34\n\nactually and reasonably believe that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm.\n\nBut once that belief of imminent harm is established by a trial court finding, as in\n\nthis case, it cannot be erased by invoking step two. My reasons follow.\n\n\n\n                                         III.\n\n\n\n      According to the court\u2019s opinion, the victim\u2019s actual perceptions will inform\n\nwhether the force used under the circumstances is reasonable. Ante, at 18\u201320. For\n\nexample, the intensity of an imminent threat of bodily injury may provoke a\n\nfrenzied retaliation in self-defense, such as a hail of bullets, that ordinarily might\n\nseem excessive but in context appears reasonable.2 Or, in the case of a \u201cbattered\n\nspouse\u201d defense, a wife\u2019s misperception that her husband was imminently\n\nthreatening her life might justify a finding that her stabbing him was reasonable\n\nunder the circumstances.3 Therefore, when the most recent iteration of the criminal\n\njury instruction for non-deadly force says, with regard to the second step, that one\n\n\n      2\n          See Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.501C\n(5th ed. rev. 2016) (\u201cIn the heat of passion, a person may actually and reasonably\nbelieve something that seems unreasonable to a calm mind.\u201d); id. No. 5.13C (4th\ned. rev. 2008) (same).\n      3\n         See 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 10.4 (c) (2d ed.\n2003) (citing State v. Kelly, 478 A.2d 364 (N.J. 1984)).\n\f                                         35\n\n\u201cmay use an amount of force which, at the time of the incident, s/he actually and\n\nreasonably believes is necessary to protect himself/herself from imminent bodily\n\nharm,\u201d4 this subjective inquiry \u2013 \u201cactually believes\u201d \u2013 is directed exclusively at the\n\nnecessity of the force used, not at the motive for self-defense.5 This, then, is the\n\ncrucial distinction between the court\u2019s opinion and the dissent: \u201cActual\u201d belief is\n\nincluded in step two of the self-defense inquiry only to explain what force may be\n\n\u201creasonable\u201d from the viewpoint of the defendant; it is not used as a potential\n\noffset to a firm, threshold finding of actual and reasonable belief of imminent\n\nbodily harm. Once the fact-finder (court or jury) has made that step-one finding,\n\nself-defense with reasonable (not excessive) force is justified without more. And\n\nnothing in our case law justifies canceling that finding \u2013 unless the court first\n\nerases it as a mistake, which did not happen here.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n          See Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.501A\n(5th ed. rev. 2016) (quoted infra note 10).\n      5\n         This interpretation is consistent with our recent, reorganized formulation\nof self-defense in a homicide case, Bassil v. United States, 147 A.3d 303 (D.C.\n2016), explaining self-defense as (1) an honest believe of \u201cimminent danger of\nserious bodily harm or death\u201d and the \u201cneed[] to use deadly force to save [one]self\nfrom that danger,\u201d coupled with (2) a requirement that \u201cboth those beliefs were\nobjectively reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d Id. at 307.\n\f                                         36\n\n      The dissent acknowledges that not all mixed motives necessarily preclude an\n\nassertion of self-defense. Post, at 48.6 But I have no idea what the dissent\u2019s\n\nformula is for deciding how many elements of retributive anger will dilute the\n\nunrebutted belief of imminent bodily harm to the point that the retributive motive\n\ncan be found \u2013 as the dissent requires \u2013 to be \u201csolely retaliatory and not defensive.\u201d\n\nPost, at 54. Indeed, the dissent itself indicates how difficult it is to sort out\n\nmotives. It \u201cacknowledge[s] that sometimes a defendant may be less than fully\n\narticulate or less than candid about her reason for acting.\u201d Post, at 58 n.14.\n\nManifestly, therefore, in light of the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s level of\n\nfear satisfied step one of the self-defense criteria, I do not understand how this\n\ncourt could conclude, with confidence, that appellant\u2019s motive was \u201csolely\n\nretaliatory and not defensive.\u201d After all, in addition to justifying her response in\n\npart by saying \u201che spit on me first,\u201d she also credibly testified, \u201cI was scared for\n\nmy life, like I didn\u2019t know what they were going to do.\u201d\n\n\n\n      Judge Easterly\u2019s opinion for the court properly rejects a second-guess,\n\nweighing-and-balancing exercise once the trial court has found, without limitation,\n\n      6\n         See LaFave, supra note 3, \u00a7 10.4 (c) (\u201c[I]f [one] acts in proper self-\ndefense, he does not lose the defense because he acts with some less admirable\nmotive in addition to that of defending himself, as where he enjoys using force\nupon his adversary because he hates him.\u201d).\n\f                                          37\n\nthat the defendant experienced the belief of imminent bodily harm necessary to\n\njustify self-defense. I agree that it would be superfluous, indeed confusing, and\n\ncontrary to the trial court\u2019s unequivocal step-one finding, to try to sort out other\n\nmotives that may be at work.\n\n\n\n      In sum, the fact that the defendant may have had a mixed mentality \u2013 great\n\nfear coupled with retributive anger \u2013 is irrelevant here. The latter cannot be used\n\nto negate the former once a defendant\u2019s fear itself has been found, without caveat,\n\nto justify the use of reasonable force in self-defense.\n\n\n\n                                        IV.\n\n\n\n      I add here, finally, a postscript to explain some of the jury instructions, as\n\nsupported by relevant case law, that inform the majority\u2019s analysis. It is interesting\n\nto note, first, that the criminal jury instruction for non-deadly force \u2013 the force used\n\nin this case of simple assault \u2013 had initially required, for the second-step inquiry,\n\nonly that the defendant had \u201creasonably believe[d]\u201d \u2013 not \u201cactually and reasonably\n\nbelieve[d]\u201d \u2013 that the amount of force used in self-defense was \u201cnecessary to\n\f                                          38\n\nprotect himself/herself from imminent bodily harm.\u201d 7 Moreover, until the court\u2019s\n\nopinion in this case, the law applicable to simple assault has not acknowledged a\n\nsubjective component of the second step of a self-defense analysis.8 Thus, the\n\n\n\n      7\n        Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 5.13A (4th ed.\nrev. 2008), provides in full:\n\n      A person may use a reasonable amount of force in self-defense. A person\nmay use an amount of force which, at the time of the incident, s/he reasonably\nbelieves is necessary to protect himself/herself from imminent bodily harm.\n(Emphasis added).\n      8\n          See Ewell v. United States, 72 A.3d 127, 131-32 (D.C. 2013) (simple\nassault); Snell v. United States, 754 A.2d 289, 290 (D.C. 2000) (simple assault);\nGuillard v. United States, 596 A.2d 60, 63 (D.C. 1991) (simple assault); Potter v.\nUnited States, 534 A.2d 943, 945-46 (D.C. 1987) (simple assault); see also Kittle v.\nUnited States, 65 A.3d 1144, 1158 (D.C. 2013) (assault and felony threats);\nHiggenbottom v. United States, 923 A.2d 891, 900 (D.C. 2007) (assault with intent\nto kill while armed, aggravated assault while armed, assault with a dangerous\nweapon, mayhem while armed); McPhaul v. United States, 452 A.2d 371, 373-74\n(D.C. 1982) (assault with a deadly weapon).\n       In Ewell, this court reversed a conviction for simple assault, holding (in part)\nthat the trial court had erroneously instructed the jury on the use of deadly, not\nnon-deadly, force in self-defense. Relying on McPhaul and Snell, we held that, for\nnon-deadly force, a defendant had to meet a \u201cless onerous standard,\u201d showing only\n\u201ca reasonable belief that he was in imminent danger of bodily harm,\u201d 72 A.2d at\n131, whereas for deadly force the defendant had to show both an \u201chonest[]\u201d and a\n\u201creasonabl[e]\u201d belief that \u201che was in imminent danger of serious bodily harm.\u201d Id.\nat 132 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). In a footnote, the\ncourt also referenced the different instructions for deadly and non-deadly force in\nthe Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia Nos. 9.501A and\n9.501B (5th ed. 2009), in order to evidence the distinction between \u201cbodily harm\u201d\nand \u201cserious bodily harm.\u201d Presumably in light of binding case law, however, the\ncourt did not address the change from the fourth (2008) edition of the Instructions\nin 9.501A: that self-defense with non-deadly force henceforth required a showing\n                                                                        (continued\u2026)\n\f                                          39\n\ndissent\u2019s apparent reliance on appellant\u2019s \u201cactual\u201d belief about the level of force\n\nrequired to dispel a mindset of fear justifying self-defense \u2013 derived from the\n\nsecond step of the self-defense inquiry (reasonable force)9 \u2013 has no prior case law\n\nsupport.\n\n\n\n      In 2009, the pertinent criminal jury instruction for use of non-deadly force\n\nwas amended to conform to the one traditionally used for deadly force. 10\n\nPresumably, therefore, the defendant who uses non-deadly force today must have\n\nboth \u201cactually and reasonably believe[d]\u201d that the force used was necessary for\n\nself-protection.11 For purposes of analysis, the opinion for the court, as well as the\n\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\nthat the defendant \u201cactually,\u201d as well as \u201creasonably,\u201d believed the amount of force\nused \u201cwas necessary to protect himself/herself from imminent bodily harm.\u201d\n      9\n          See supra section III (explaining \u201cthe crucial distinction between the\ncourt\u2019s opinion and the dissent\u201d).\n      10\n          See Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.501A\n(5th ed. 2009). This formulation of Instruction No. 9.501A remains unchanged\nand is found in the most recent (2016) revised version of the Criminal Jury\nInstructions for the District of Columbia.\n      11\n           Instruction No. 9.501A, see supra note 9, provides in full:\n      A person may use a reasonable amount of force in self-defense. A person\nmay use an amount of force which, at the time of the incident, s/he actually and\nreasonably believes is necessary to protect himself/herself from imminent bodily\nharm. (Emphasis added).\n\f                                         40\n\ndissent, relies on that updated formulation here.12        Moreover, the case law\n\napplicable to deadly force, most notably (though not exclusively) in homicide\n\ncases, has traditionally required that same, dual belief.13 No explanation is offered\n\nwith the 2009 instruction as to why the amendment for non-deadly force was\n\nadopted, but as explained above in section III, addition of \u201cactual\u201d to \u201creasonable\u201d\n\nbelief assures attention to the defendant\u2019s subjective viewpoint in determining\n\nwhether the defendant\u2019s belief in the necessity of the force used was reasonable\n\nunder the circumstances. It does not advert to the threshold, step-one mindset\n\nrequired to justify self-defense.\n\n\n      12\n           Years ago, in an opinion concerning defense of a third person, we\nacknowledged that \u201c[t]he right of self-defense, and especially the degree of force\nthe victim is permitted to use to prevent bodily harm, is premised substantially on\nthe victim\u2019s own reasonable perceptions of what is happening.\u201d Fersner v. United\nStates, 482 A.2d 387, 391 (D.C. 1984).\n      13\n          The decision underlying the line of homicide self-defense cases is United\nStates v. Peterson, 483 F.2d 1222, 1229-30 (D.C. Cir. 1973). See Bassil v. United\nStates, 147 A.3d 303, 306-07 (D.C. 2016); Richardson v. United States, 93 A.3d\n178, 187 (D.C. 2014); Edwards v. United States, 721 A.2d 938, 941 (D.C. 1998);\nSmith v. United States, 686 A.2d 537, 544 (D.C. 1996), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 839\n(1997); Swann v. United States, 648 A.2d 928, 930 (D.C. 1994); Brown v. United\nStates, 619 A.2d 1180, 1182 (D.C. 1992).\n\n       In particularly violent assault cases which do not result in homicide, a deadly\nforce instruction for self-defense may be appropriate. See, e.g., Travers v. United\nStates, 124 A.3d 634, 639 (D.C. 2015) (felony assault and mayhem); Freeman v.\nUnited States, 912 A.2d 1213, 1220 (D.C. 2006) (assault with intent to kill while\narmed); Harper v. United States, 608 A.2d 152, 155 (D.C. 1992) (assault with a\ndangerous weapon); LaFave, supra note 3, \u00a7 10.4 (a).\n\f                                           41\n\n\n\n\n                                           Va.\n\n\n\n      I cannot help feeling that if appellant had whacked her assailant rather than\n\nspit on him, there would have been little, if any, basis for questioning whether a\n\nself-defense instruction (from the court to itself) was available in this case. Indeed,\n\nour dissenting colleague seems to agree. Post, at 48 n.6. But apparently the trial\n\ncourt rejected self-defense not because appellant lacked the belief of imminent\n\nbodily harm required to justify self-defense but, at least in part, because the court\n\nbelieved that the defensive response was too lame \u2013 a curious concern because the\n\nforbidden response, unreasonable force, is force too violent, not too weak (a\n\npuzzling concern our dissenting colleague shares).\n\n\n\n      To justify the dissent\u2019s analysis, the trial court might have withheld or\n\nrevoked its threshold finding that appellant \u201cactually did fear\u201d and \u201creasonably\n\nbelieved\u201d that she was \u201cin danger of imminent bodily harm.\u201d             But the court\n\ncouldn\u2019t, and thus wouldn\u2019t, and therefore didn\u2019t \u2013 thereby precluding the analysis\n\nthat our dissenting colleague presents.\n\n\n\n                                          *****\n\f                                           42\n\n\n\n\n        For the reasons expressed above, I join the opinion of the court.\n\n\n\n        THOMPSON, Associate Judge, dissenting: I am unable to join the majority\n\nopinion because my colleagues\u2019 analysis dispenses with the requirement that, for a\n\nclaim of self-defense to be valid, the defendant must have honestly and reasonably\n\nbelieved that her action (that would otherwise constitute an unlawful assault) was\n\nnecessary \u201cto save h[er]self.\u201d1      The trial court, by contrast, appears to have\n\ncorrectly understood that if the evidence disproved that appellant Parker acted to\n\nsave or protect herself from (the threatened) attack, her self-defense claim must\n\nfail.\n\n\n\n\n                                          A.\n\n\n\n\n        I will not repeat the summary of evidence set out in the majority opinion, but\n\ndo need to highlight relevant portions of appellant\u2019s testimony and statements by\n\nthe trial judge that reveal the court\u2019s reasoning.\n\n\n        1\n        Travers v. United States, 124 A.3d 634, 639 (D.C. 2015) (quoting\nEdwards v. United States, 721 A.2d 938, 941 (D.C. 1998)).\n\f                                          43\n\n\n\n\n      The trial court was very interested in why appellant spit on Powell,\n\ncommenting that appellant\u2019s \u201cstate of mind is what is important.\u201d               During\n\nappellant\u2019s testimony, there was the following exchange:\n\n\n             THE COURT: I am going to ask this question during\n             cross-examination so that it can be fully explored by both\n             attorneys. Why is it that you spit in [Powell\u2019s] face?\n\n             MS. PARKER: Because he came on my property and he\n             came and spit on me first, ma\u2019am, that\u2019s why.\n\n\nLater, during defense counsel\u2019s re-direct examination of appellant, the court\n\ncautioned counsel against asking leading questions, explaining that:\n\n\n             THE COURT: [T]he answer is not going to be credible\n             if the question is leading[,] and it is an important point in\n             my fact finding responsibility whether she spit in his face\n             out of a sense of anger and vindication and fairness and\n             justice or whether she spit in his face as a form of self-\n             defense. That is a critical question of fact for me . . . .\n\n\nDefense counsel then asked appellant again why she took the actions she took. She\n\nanswered:\n\n\n             MS. PARKER: It was just that he spit in my face and I\n             felt scared with the way they approached me that day.\n             They approached me in a very scary situation. I had a lot\n             of people come approach me at one time and I really did\n             not know what I did or what I did wrong for him to say\n\f                                            44\n\n             he was going to smack me and walk on my property and\n             then to spit in my face.\n\n\nThis echoed appellant\u2019s earlier direct testimony that, \u201cI just know that I didn\u2019t do\n\nanything wrong.\u201d The court thereafter denied defense counsel\u2019s (renewed) motion\n\nfor judgment of acquittal, stating that \u201ca reasonable juror based on this record\n\nwould be able to find that the defendant did what she did, performed the act of\n\nspitting not in self-defense but in anger and indignation\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n      After closing arguments, the court found that appellant \u201creasonably believed\n\nthat she was in imminent danger of bodily harm.\u201d The court nevertheless ruled\n\nthat the government had \u201ccarried its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat with respect to the . . . spitting, self-defense was not in play[.]\u201d In explaining\n\nits ruling, the court said the following:\n\n\n             THE COURT: [I]n order for self-defense to apply[,] she\n             has to use a reasonable amount of force in self-defense.\n             Using a reasonable amount of force because she is angry\n             or indignant or outraged or because of injustice, if\n             somebody spits in your face which is what he did, that\n             person deserves to be spit on and should expect to be spit\n             on, that is not self-defense. That is spitting but not for\n             purposes of self-defense and the government has proven\n             on this record that the spitting occurred not for reasons of\n             self-defense but for those other reasons.\n\n             ...\n\f                                         45\n\n            [E]very time [appellant] is asked, why did you spit on\n            him, the immediate answer is, because he spit on me, and\n            that was said directly on the scene to the police officer.[2]\n            The answer to the same effect was indeed given to the\n            prosecutor, I spit on him because he spit on me, and I\n            directly asked, why did you spit on him. [Appellant\u2019s\n            answer was] I spit in his face because he came on my\n            property and he spit on me first and there is street justice\n            in that. (emphasis added).\n\n\nFurther explaining its finding, the court referred to \u201cwhat could have been expected\n\nto happen next if that police officer had not been there\u201d when appellant spit on\n\nPowell. Crediting appellant\u2019s testimony to the effect that Powell was \u201cbacked up\n\nby his mother\u201d and that \u201chalf a dozen members of his family were also\n\napproaching [appellant] and backing him up[,]\u201d the court reasoned that:\n\n\n            THE COURT: Powell[,] backed up by his family and\n            surrounding [appellant] the way he was and having just\n            been spat on[,] would have made good on some of th[e]\n            threats [he had made to appellant], not the shoot you\n            threat[,] but the beat the S part of the threat. [Powell\u2019s\n            side] had the numbers and they had the anger and they\n            had their expressed motivation.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n          The police officer who responded to the scene testified that appellant\n\u201cexplained to me clearly that she wouldn\u2019t just spit on him for no reason, that he\nspit on her first . . . .\u201d\n\f                                         46\n\nThe court found that appellant \u201cdid not spit on Mr. Powell as an act of self-\n\ndefense[,]\u201d i.e., that \u201cthe spitting occurred not for reasons of self-defense but for\n\nthose other reasons.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                         B.\n\n\n\n      The court\u2019s statements quoted above reflect a recognition that what was\n\nmissing each time from appellant\u2019s explanation of why she spit on Powell was any\n\nstatement to the effect that she spit on him in an effort to protect herself from\n\nharm.3 Appellant had every opportunity to respond, \u201cI spit on Powell to make him\n\nand his family go away\u201d or \u201cto make them stop bothering me,\u201d or something to\n\nthat effect,4 but she gave no such response (and instead repeatedly mentioned not\n\n\n\n      3\n          I do not mean to imply that appellant bore the burden to prove that she\nacted in self-defense. I agree with my colleagues that it was \u201cthe government\u2019s\nburden to prove that she did not.\u201d Ante, at 14 n.13 (majority opinion). However,\nin determining whether that burden was met, the trial court was entitled to consider\nall the evidence, including appellant\u2019s own testimony \u2014 and glaring omissions in\nthat testimony \u2014 about why she spit on Powell.\n      4\n         Cf. Ewell v. United States, 72 A.3d 127, 128, 132 (D.C. 2013) (internal\nquotation marks omitted) (describing the defendant\u2019s testimony that he struck the\ncomplainant in the face because, after throwing a cup of vodka at him and hitting\nhim in the mouth, she \u201c\u2018was still coming\u2019 at him\u201d and he feared she had a knife\nand might pull it out and stab him; remanding the case to the trial court for\nreconsideration of defendant\u2019s self-defense claim, because the court had failed to\n                                                                    (continued\u2026)\n\f                                          47\n\nonly Powell\u2019s having spit at her when she had done nothing wrong, but also the\n\naffront of his coming onto her property). Nor did appellant describe her act of\n\nspitting on Powell as a merely reflexive action, as she had effectively done when\n\nexplaining why she threw a can into the street (an action she took, according to the\n\nofficer, before she spit on Powell):\n\n\n             MS PARKER: I threw [the can] in the middle of the\n             street. I didn\u2019t throw it at him exactly. I just threw it, the\n             can. I just threw the can. I don\u2019t know, I was scared. I\n             don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\n\n\nThe court\u2019s statements quoted above also appear to reflect an assessment by the\n\ncourt that, given the evidence that Powell was \u201cbacked up by [a half-dozen or more\n\nangry members of] his family,\u201d no reasonable person could have believed that\n\nappellant\u2019s spitting at Powell would protect appellant from harm.\n\n\n\n      Thus, the court\u2019s key factual finding and reasoning were as follows: First,\n\nthe court found that appellant\u2019s motive in spitting on Powell was to effect \u201cstreet\n\njustice\u201d (i.e., retribution, revenge, or retaliation), and was not at all to defend\n\n\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\naccount for the testimony \u201ctending to show that appellant acted to protect\nhimself\u201d).\n\f                                         48\n\nherself.5 See generally 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 10.4 (c)\n\n(2d ed. 2003) (stating that a defendant acting in self-defense \u201cdoes not lose the\n\ndefense because [s]he acts with some less admirable motive in addition to that of\n\ndefending [her]self\u201d (emphasis added)). My colleagues observe that appellant\n\n\u201cnever indicated that she had the \u2018street justice\u2019 motive that the court imputed to\n\nher,\u201d ante, at 12 (majority opinion), but they stop short of concluding that the trial\n\njudge made a \u201cfactfinding error.\u201d Ante, at 16 (majority opinion).\n\n\n\n      Second, the court reasoned that appellant could not have reasonably thought\n\nthat her spitting at Powell would extricate her from danger, i.e., cause Powell and\n\nhis family to leave her alone.6 Yet, per this court\u2019s case law discussed below, that\n\n\n      5\n          The court\u2019s focus was not on (as the concurrence puts it) \u201chow many\nelements of retributive anger\u201d it takes to defeat a claim of self-defense. Ante, at 36\n(concurring opinion). The issue the court resolved was whether appellant\u2019s\nspitting on Powell was at all an effort to repel the attack that was threatened by\nPowell and the half-dozen members of his family who had approached appellant\nand were backing Powell up, or instead was merely appellant\u2019s effort to satisfy her\n(admittedly understandable) desire for retribution.\n      6\n          I suspect the trial judge would have had no trouble concluding that\nappellant had acted in self-defense if she had, for example, grabbed a stick and\nbrandished it at Powell and his family members, or if she had pulled out a can of\npepper spray and let them have it. Both of those actions are, at least arguably,\nmore aggressive actions than spitting, and our public policy surely is not to\nencourage an escalation of aggressive conduct. But, as a policy matter reflected in\nthe common law, we tolerate a victim\u2019s violent actions designed to stop a first\naggressor\u2019s assaultive action, and do not tolerate a victim\u2019s violent actions that\n                                                                    (continued\u2026)\n\f                                        49\n\nis what a defendant must have believed to avail herself of the defense of self-\n\ndefense.\n\n\n\n                                        C.\n\n\n\n      In numerous cases involving claims of self-defense, this court has said the\n\nfollowing or its equivalent: \u201cOne who is defending against an assault charge, who\n\nis claiming self-defense, must have honestly and reasonably believed that he was in\n\nimminent peril of death or serious bodily harm, and that his response was\n\nnecessary to save himself.\u201d Travers, 124 A.3d at 639 (italics and underscoring\n\nadded, internal quotation marks omitted; citing cases); see also, e.g., Higgenbottom\n\nv. United States, 923 A.2d 891, 900\u201301 (D.C. 2007) (approving an instruction that\n\ntold the jury, inter alia, that \u201c[a] person may use an amount of force which, at the\n\ntime of the incident, he reasonably believes is necessary to protect himself from\n\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\namount to nothing more than tit-for-tat acts of retaliation (and that risk elevating\nthe first aggressor\u2019s threatening conduct). None of this is to say, of course, that\nspitting could never be a defensive act against a violent aggressor. As one court\nhas explained, \u201c[i]t is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which spitting could\nconceivably constitute a use of force in self-defense \u2014 for example, where a\nperson who has been placed in a chokehold spits at the aggressor to get him to\nloosen his grip.\u201d State v. Markou, No. 104,931, 2011 Kan. App. Unpub. LEXIS\n505, at *6 (Kan. Ct.

See, e.g., Bassil v. United States, 147 A.3d 303, 306-07 (D.C. 2016)\n(explaining that the use of deadly force in self-defense is justified if the defendant\n\u201chonestly believed she was in imminent danger of serious bodily harm or death,\nand that she needed to use deadly force to save herself from that danger\u201d and if\n\u201cboth those beliefs were objectively reasonable under the circumstances\u201d (italics\nand underscoring added)); Edwards v.

These beliefs must not only have been honestly entertained, but also\nobjectively reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances. It is clear that no\nless than a concurrence of these elements will suffice.\u201d (quoting United States v.\nPeterson, 483 F.2d 1222, 1229 (D.C.

While my\n\ncolleagues make much of what they call our jurisdiction\u2019s \u201ctwo-part test\u201d for self-\n\ndefense,\u201d ante, at 16 (majority opinion), they fail to give due attention to the lead-\n\nin clause that dictates when the \u201ctwo-part test\u201d is applicable: the statement that\n\nthere is a right to use a \u201creasonable amount of force\u201d (defined as applicable here by\n\nthe non-deadly force paragraph of standardized jury instruction 9.501) \u201cin self-\n\ndefense.\u201d8 That is why \u2014 and it is no mere tautology to say it \u2014 a claim that the\n\n\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\n(footnote signals omitted, italics and underscoring added)); Harper v.

In other words, to prevail on a claim of self-\n\ndefense, one must have acted \u201cin self-defense,\u201d i.e., acted in order to defend\n\noneself; if the defendant acted purely for retribution, her action was not in self-\n\ndefense.9 For that reason, I cannot agree with my colleagues that the defendant\u2019s\n\n\u201c[m]otive is not separately and additionally considered as a basis for disproving a\n\nclaim of self-defense.\u201d Ante, at 3 (majority opinion).10 Nor can I agree that the\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\nused in self-defense if the actor reasonably believes that he or she is in imminent\ndanger of bodily harm.\u201d (emphasis added)).\n      9\n         In my view, these are quite unremarkable propositions. My colleagues in\nthe majority, too, recognize that what is \u201centirely congruent with [a] claim of self-\ndefense\u201d is action \u201cto repel the reasonably perceived danger[.]\u201d Ante, at 14\n(majority opinion).\n\n       To be clear, I do not suggest that a person who uses force after being\nassaulted by an aggressor may not have a mixture of emotions, including emotions\nsuch as anger, hate, or indignation. Indeed, I expect that any person in that\nsituation would be quite likely to have a mix of emotions. But to be entitled to the\ndefense of self-defense, the person must have used force not purely as an\nexpression of those emotions, but in an effort to repel the imminent danger of\nbodily harm. A person may use \u201creasonable force to repel the perceived attack.\u201d\nHiggenbottom, 923 A.2d at 900 (emphasis added).\n      10\n          I agree with my colleagues that \u201c[t]he essence of the self-defense situation\nis a reasonable and bona fide belief of the imminence of . . . bodily harm (emphasis\nadded),\u201d Kinard v. United States, 96 F.2d 522, 526 (D.C. Cir. 1938), but the fact\nthat the situation was one that would have justified efforts at self-defense does not\nmean that the defendant actually acted in self-defense. I agree that \u201cthe threshold\n                                                                        (continued\u2026)\n\f                                         53\n\ntrial court \u201cerred as a matter of law in conducting a separate inquiry\u201d into why\n\nappellant spit on Powell.11 Ante, at 2 (majority opinion). I do not mean to imply\n\nthat such an inquiry will be necessary in every case. But, where (as here) the\n\nnature of the force the defendant used, or the defendant\u2019s testimony, or other\n\nfactors fairly raise the issue of whether the defendant undertook force in an actual\n\neffort to protect herself, the inquiry is appropriate and may be necessary. And\n\nwhile it may be difficult to prove that \u201cthere was another motive guiding the\n\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\nquestion for the fact finder is whether the government has disproved that the\n\u2018appellant actually and reasonably believed that [s]he was in imminent danger of\nbodily harm[,]\u2019\u201d Higgenbottom, 923 A.2d at 900, but that threshold question is not\nthe only relevant question.\n      11\n           The court\u2019s inquiry was consistent not only with our case law discussed\nsupra, but also with a common-law principle that is over a century old. See, e.g.,\nLyons v. People, 27 N.E. 677, 682 (Ill. 1891) (approving a self-defense instruction\nthat told the jury, \u201cIt must appear that the circumstances were sufficient to excite\nthe fears of a reasonable person, and that the party killing really acted under the\ninfluence of those fears and not in a spirit of revenge\u201d) (second set of italics\nadded); Wortham v. State, 70 Ga. 336, 339 (Ga. 1883) (explaining that for a\nhomicide to be justifiable, \u201c[i]t must appear that the circumstances were such as to\nexcite the fears of a reasonable man; and it must also further appear that he acted\nunder those fears, and not in a spirit of revenge\u201d) (italics added). I also note that\nissues such as those we have had to consider in this case continue to be discussed\nin the academic literature. See, e.g., Stephanie Spies, Malice Aforethought and\nSelf-Defense: Mutually Exclusive Mental States?, 91 N.Y.U. L. REV. 1027, 1046\n(Oct. 2016) (discussing a category of cases finding retaliation/revenge and self-\ndefense incompatible); see also Martin R. Gardner, The Mens Rea Enigma:\nObservations on the Role of Motive in the Criminal Law Past and Present, 1993\nUtah L. Rev. 635 (1993).\n\f                                         54\n\ndefendant\u2019s action,\u201d ante, at 16, if the credited evidence proves that such other\n\nmotive(s) alone, and not defense of self, was the defendant\u2019s reason for using\n\nforce, the government will have met its burden to rebut the defendant\u2019s claim of\n\nself-defense.\n\n\n\n      In this case \u2014 one in which the issue is whether the evidence permitted the\n\ncourt to find that appellant\u2019s use of force was solely retaliatory and not defensive\n\n\u2014 we may not rest on the truncated discussions of the law of self-defense found in\n\nsome of our cases. See, e.g., Kittle v. United States, 65 A.3d 1144, 1158 (D.C.\n\n2013) (\u201cTo invoke self-defense, there must be some evidence that: (1) appellant\n\nactually believed he was in imminent danger of bodily harm, and (2) he had\n\nreasonable grounds for that belief.\u201d      (internal quotation marks and brackets\n\nomitted) (quoting Guillard v. United States, 596 A.2d 60, 63 (D.C. 1991))). The\n\nabbreviated articulation of the law of self-defense in Kittle and similar cases\n\nsufficed in those cases because the issue was simply whether the defendant\n\nbelieved he was in danger of imminent harm; the issue was not the motive for the\n\nuse of force or even the proportionality of the force the defendant used. See Kittle,\n\n65 A.3d at 1160 (\u201c[T]here was no evidence, \u2018however weak,\u2019 to establish that\n\nappellant acted out of a fear of imminent harm.\u201d); Snell, 754 A.2d at 291 (\u201c[T]here\n\nwas evidence upon which a reasonable mind could find beyond a reasonable doubt\n\f                                           55\n\nthat appellant did not reasonably believe he was in imminent danger of bodily\n\nharm[.]\u201d).\n\n\n\n      Discussions of the self-defense standard in other cases add to the required\n\ninquiry whether, objectively, the force used by the defendant was reasonable or\n\nnecessary. See, e.g., Higgenbottom, 923 A.2d at 900 (\u201c[T]he central questions for\n\nthe jury were (1) whether appellant [who was charged with striking his assailant\n\nwith a pipe] actually and reasonably believed that he was in imminent danger of\n\nbodily harm, and (2) whether he used only reasonable force to repel the perceived\n\nattack.\u201d (italics added)). Formulations like this have been used when the focus of\n\nanalysis was on whether the force the defendant used was excessive, not on\n\nwhether the defendant used force that was so predictably ineffectual as not to\n\nqualify as force the defendant believed was necessary to protect herself. It appears\n\nthat, until now, the latter issue simply has not arisen.\n\n\n\n      This court\u2019s articulations of the self-defense standard that are on point here\n\nestablish that an act is not taken in self-defense unless it is intended to be (and\n\ncould reasonably be thought to be) defensive.12 Our most pertinent explications of\n\n\n      12\n         I note tangentially that I take no issue with the statement that \u201c[i]n the\nheat of passion, a person may actually and reasonably believe something that\n                                                                    (continued\u2026)\n\f                                         56\n\nthe standard dictate that, at least in some cases (and this is such a one), the\n\nnecessary state-of-mind inquiry is not fully satisfied upon a conclusion that the\n\ndefendant actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily\n\nharm, and that the self-defense analysis also is not complete upon a further\n\nconclusion that the amount of force used was not excessive. We must ask in\n\naddition (as the trial court in this case did) whether the appellant acted to protect\n\nherself (or whether, instead, she acted merely in retaliation, or only so as to \u201cgive\n\nas good as she got,\u201d ante at 14 (majority opinion), or solely to vindicate her sense\n\nthat there was nothing she \u201cdid wrong\u201d to precipitate her assailant\u2019s attack).\n\n\n\n                                         D.\n\n\n\n      All the foregoing said, I am not prepared simply to affirm appellant\u2019s\n\nconviction, because it appears that the trial court, in reasoning that appellant could\n\nnot have reasonably believed that spitting on Powell might extricate her from\n\ndanger, failed to take into account some of the rebuttal testimony by Officer\n\nBradley. Officer Bradley testified on rebuttal that when he came upon the scene,\n\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\nseems unreasonable to a calm mind.\u201d Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of\nColumbia, No. 9.501.C.\n\f                                         57\n\nhe observed \u201ctwo families or two groups of family and friends yelling at each other\n\non behalf of who[m]ever they were with.\u201d On appellant\u2019s side, there was \u201cthe\n\nactual driver of the vehicle that was out there[,]\u201d who \u201cwas kind of the calming\n\nperson trying to calm everybody down.\u201d There were also \u201ca few other people\u201d\n\n\u201cstanding in the general area,\u201d who \u201clooked like they were on the defendant\u2019s side.\n\nIt \u201cseemed like\u201d these people on appellant\u2019s side were yelling in Powell\u2019s direction\n\nand that they \u201cweren\u2019t happy with\u201d Powell.\n\n\n\n      In explaining its verdict and the rejection of appellant\u2019s self-defense claim,\n\nthe trial court did not mention Officer Bradley\u2019s testimony about the \u201cother\n\npeople\u201d on appellant\u2019s side and thus did not explicitly credit or discredit the\n\nofficer\u2019s testimony in this regard. As described above, the court emphasized that\n\nPowell\u2019s side \u201chad the numbers and they had the anger\u201d and reasoned that if\n\nOfficer Bradley had not arrived just before appellant spit on Powell, Powell and\n\nthe group of people on his side \u201cwould have made good on some of th[e] threats\u201d\n\nhe had made to appellant and predictably would have \u201cbeat the S\u201d out of appellant\n\n(a forecast of violence that was not entirely speculative given appellant\u2019s testimony\n\nthat sometime prior to this incident, Powell had \u201cjumped [appellant\u2019s] daughter\u201d).\n\nThe court did not consider, however, whether, in a context where appellant had a\n\n\u201cfew other people\u201d on her side who were showing anger toward Powell, appellant\n\f                                           58\n\ncould honestly and reasonably have believed that her act of spitting on Powell\n\ncould serve as a deterrent to further violence by Powell or the people who were on\n\nhis side.\n\n\n\n       To put it differently, even if appellant could not reasonably have thought that\n\nspitting would protect her in a situation where she was alone against Powell and\n\nhis several family members, it is less clear that she could not reasonably have\n\nthought that spitting would protect her in the situation Officer Bradley described.\n\nAnd because all the evidence, and not just the defendant\u2019s testimony, is relevant to\n\na finding about what the defendant who asserts a claim of self-defense could\n\nreasonably have believed (and to an inference about what she actually did\n\nbelieve),13 I believe the trial court\u2019s sole focus on appellant\u2019s testimony was\n\ninsufficient.14 If credited, Officer Bradley\u2019s testimony about there being a \u201cfew\n\n\n       13\n          Cf.

Rather, it is to\nacknowledge that sometimes a defendant may be less than fully articulate or less\nthan candid about her reason for acting, and that the court must consider all the\nevidence, not just the defendant\u2019s testimony, before drawing an inference about\nwhy she acted as she did.\n      15\n            Contrary to the suggestion in the concurrence, I do not suggest that\nappellant\u2019s weak response signaled that the she did not actually and reasonably\nbelieve that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm (and the trial court, which\nexpressly found that appellant believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily\nharm[,]\u201d) certainly did not suggest or infer that). To repeat, the point I make (and\nthe point I believe the trial court recognized) is that the weakness of appellant\u2019s\nspitting response raises an issue of whether she actually and reasonably believed\nthat spitting on Powell could help repel the danger in which she found herself,\ndanger posed not only by Powell but also by the half-dozen or so members of his\nfamily were also approaching appellant and \u201cbacking him up[.]\u201d Appellant\ntestified that she \u201cdidn\u2019t know what they\u201d \u2014 people \u201cknown in the neighborhood\nto cause trouble\u201d \u2014w[ere] going to do\u201d (emphasis added).\n      16\n           The court\u2019s task on remand would include determining, in light of the\nofficer\u2019s testimony about the presence of some of appellant\u2019s family members on\nthe scene, whether appellant\u2019s spitting on Powell \u201cwas too lame to evidence . . . an\nattempt at self-protection,\u201d ante, at 28 (concurring opinion), because it was not a\nproportionate reaction to the \u201cvery scary situation\u201d she perceived from the \u201clike\neight people [on Powell\u2019s side]\u201d who \u201capproach[ed] [her] at one time.\u201d\n\f                                         60\n\n\n\n\n                                         E.\n\n\n\n      The final observations I will make about the majority opinion are these:\n\nFirst, in focusing only on whether the defendant feared imminent bodily harm and\n\nwhether she used excessive force, the majority opinion gives short shrift to the rule\n\nthat, even as to non-deadly force, \u201c[t]he right of self-defense is a law of necessity,\n\narising only when the necessity begins, and equally ends with the necessity.\u201d 17\n\nSecond, the opinion does damage to the principle that none of us is entitled to\n\n\u201ctake redress into []our own hands.\u201d18 Third, the majority\u2019s holding \u2014 that when\n\nself-defense is raised, the only proper inquiry with respect to a defendant\u2019s mental\n\nstate is whether she subjectively and reasonably believed she was in imminent\n\ndanger of bodily harm \u2014 is not a \u201creaffirm[ation],\u201d as my colleagues assert, ante,\n\nat 26 (majority opinion), but a new pronouncement that takes advantage of the\n\nunusual facts of this case to abandon the principle that a valid claim of self-defense\n\nalso requires a belief by the defendant that the force she used was necessary to\n      17\n         Harper, 608 A.2d at 154 (D.C. 1992) (quoting United States v.

The trial court determined that Ms. Parker reasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm when Frederick Powell and members of his family accosted her in front of her home and Mr. Powell threatened and then spit on her. Nonetheless, the trial court rejected *839Ms. Parker\u2019s claim that she was acting in self-defense when, in response to Mr. Powell spitting on her, she spit back on him. The trial court determined that Ms. Parker, although actually and reasonably afraid of Mr. Powell, had acted with a retaliatory motive that defeated her claim of self-defense.\nWe question whether the record evidence supports the trial court\u2019s determination that Ms. Parker\u2019s motivation was purely retributive, but ultimately conclude that the trial court erred as a matter of law in conducting a separate inquiry into Ms. Parker\u2019s motive. Under the District\u2019s long-standing common law test for self-defense, captured in our standard jury instructions, whether the government has disproved a claim of self-defense turns on two questions: (1) whether a defendant reasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm (an inquiry that may be informed, among other things, by motive evidence presented by the government); and (2) if so, whether the force used was excessive. Motive is not separately and additionally considered as a basis for disproving a claim of self-defense. In this ease, the trial court found that Ms. Parker\u2019s belief she was in imminent danger was reasonable and there was never an argument that her act of spitting on Mr. Powell constituted excessive force. As there was no basis for the trial court to reject Ms. Parker\u2019s claim of self-defense, we reverse.\nI. Facts2\nEarly one evening in June 2014, Ms. Parker walked out of her home where she lived with her three children. She was about to get into a friend\u2019s car, when she heard Mr. Powell3 yell from across the street that he \u201cshould go over and smack the shit out of that bitch.\u201d When Ms. Parker asked to whom he was speaking, Mr. Powell crossed the street and came onto her property, positioned himself so that he and Ms. Parker were face-to-face, and said, \u201cbitch, you.\u201d Mr. Powell\u2019s \u201caggressive]\u201d approach indicated to Ms. Parker that \u201che was trying to fight [her],\u201d and Mr. Powell asked her \u201cdo you want that smoke,\u201d a question Ms. Parker understood as a threat to shoot her.\nMr. Powell\u2019s mother crossed the street with him, and several of his brothers joined them on Ms. Parker\u2019s property; the family surrounded her friend\u2019s car and yelled insults at Ms. Parker. They called her a \u201cdirty bitch\u201d and accused her of being \u201chot,\u201d ie., \u201cworking with the police.\u201d \u201c[T]here were a lot of them,\u201d and Ms. Parker \u201cfear[ed] for [her] life.\u201d.\nWhen he was less than two feet away from her, Mr. Powell spit in her face. Ms. Parker was \u201creally was scared\u201d once Mr. Powell spit on her, because she \u201cdidn\u2019t know what he was going to do next.\u201d She spit back.4\nAt about that time, unbeknownst to Ms. Parker,5 a police officer arrived. While sitting in his car, the officer saw Mr. Powell face-to-face with Ms. Parker, surrounded *840by approximately ten people,6 all standing near a ear and yelling at each other. The officer could not hear what they were saying, but he saw Ms. Parker spit on Mr. Powell. When he spoke to her at the scene, she explained (because the officer had not seen the entire encounter and in particular, had not seen Mr. Powell spit on Ms. Parker) \u201cthat she wouldn\u2019t just spit on him for no reason, that he spit on her first.\u201d The officer then arrested Ms. Parker for simple assault.\nAt trial, Mr. Powell did not testify and the government called only one witness, the arresting officer. Ms. Parker testified on her own behalf. Ms. Parker conceded that she spit on Mr. Powell but claimed she was acting in self-defense. On direct and cross-examination, Ms. Parker repeatedly testified that she was afraid of Mr. Powell. On direct, Ms. Parker was asked what she believed was going to happen at the time she spat back at Mr. Powell and she said, \u201cI thought he was going to hit me, honestly that was the next thing. I was fearing for my life. ... I am scared for my life, like I didn\u2019t know what they w[ere] going to do.\u201d On cross-examination, she specifically denied being angry: \u201cI wasn\u2019t angry. I was scared for my life. ... I was more scared than anything.\u201d In response to a followup question from the court \u2014 \u201cWhy is it that you spit in [Mr. Powell\u2019s] face?\u201d \u2014 she explained, as she had to the police officer, that she had spit on Mr. Powell \u201c[b]ecause he came on my property and ... spit on me first.\u201d Finally, on redirect, Ms. Parker once again explained why she had spit on Mr. Powell:\nIt was just that he spit in my face and I felt scared with the way they approached me that day. They approached me in a scary situation. I had a lot of people approach me at one time and I really did not know what I did or what I did wrong for him to say he was going to smack me and walk on to my property and then to spit in my face.\nThe government argued in closing that it had carried its burden to show that \u201cthe defendant was not in fear of imminent bodily harm which is the standard of self-defense.\u201d Instead the government asserted that the evidence established that Ms. Parker was \u201cvery angry,\u201d \u201cindignant,\u201d and \u201coffended by what she states that the complainant did to her.\u201d The government further asserted that Ms. Parker had not \u201cexpressed a fear of imminent bodily injury. What she has expressed is being angry at this complainant and not liking this complainant.\u201d The government then highlighted Ms. Parker\u2019s testimony that she had spit on Mr. Powell because he spit on her. The defense countered in its closing that there was \u201cabsolutely no reason or evidence to believe that Ms. Parker wasn\u2019t afraid and, in fact, it is to the contrary.\u201d \u201c[T]here is evidence and there is testimony that she was actually afraid ... and that she had reasonable grounds for that belief.\u201d\nThe trial court, after determining that Ms. Parker\u2019s spitting was an assaultive act, rejected her claim of self-defense, but not on the ground urged by the government. Preliminarily, the court \u201cinstruct[ed] [it]self\u201d on the law of self-defense and acknowledged that \u201cevery person has the right to use a reasonable amount of force in self-defense if one, she actually believes she is in imminent danger of bodily harm and if two, she has reasonable grounds for that belief.\u201d7 The court then found, con*841trary to the government\u2019s argument, that Ms. Parker did reasonably believe herself to be in such danger:\nI conclude based on this record that Ms. Parker reasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm. I think it is a very rich record with respect to her belief of imminent bodily harm and the reasonableness of that belief. She testified entirely credibly with no impeachment at all that amount- \u25a0 ed to anything except a minor difference in recollection about exactly what the spacing of the complaining witness and Ms. Parker was, that she was walking out of her door to get into her friend\u2019s car and as she was doing nothing more than walking to a car, Mr. Powell who was sitting nearby on his family\u2019s porch said loudly enough for her to hear, I should go over there and smack the shit out of that bitch, and he then approached her walking across the street like he was going to fight her and he was backed up by his mother who was also saying aggressive things towards Ms. Parker. They were saying such things as, bitch, you hot, which meant that she was working with the police and, you want that smoke, which was a threat to shoot and he got right up in her face and she said, who you talking to, and he said, bitch, you, and she said, whatever, little boy, get out of my face, at which point he spit on her and a half a dozen members of his family were also approaching her and backing him up.\nThe court also \u201ccredit[ed] Ms. Parker\u2019s testimony that she didn\u2019t realize that Officer Bradley was there\u201d and thus did not appreciate she could have asked him for help:\nIt is perfectly believable to me that with people shouting at each other, with her attention focused on what is going on and having been spit on, on having been threatened, on the mother coming across the street and yelling at her also on the back up of the relatives, that she is looking at all of that and everything else that is occurring is somewhere in the background noise and not quite registering for her. So, I don\u2019t think that it detracts from her credibility that the officer was there and she could easily have turned to the officer and said, look what he did and then he would be prosecuted before me for assault instead of her. I accept Ms. Parker\u2019s explanation that she was afraid even though she didn\u2019t get in the car. It is her judgment whether she is at more risk in a confined space than she. is out in the open. She had family members to access to her as long as she was out in the open. I am not going to question that judgment and I don\u2019t think it detracts from her testimony that she actually did fear that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm that she didn\u2019t get into the car. That is a judgment that you make at the time and it was for her to make at that time.\nAlthough the court found that Ms. Parker reasonably believed herself to be endangered by Mr.-Powell and his entourage, the court nonetheless concluded that Ms. Parker\u2019s self-defense claim failed because of what it perceived to be Ms. Parker\u2019s motive in responding to Mr. Powell:\nIt is [ejminently reasonable that with those threats and that expressed motivation and that backup she would feel herself in imminent danger and I find that she did, but in order for self-defense to apply she has to use a reasonable amount of force in self-defense.[8] Using *842a reasonable amount of force is [not9] because she is angry or indignant or outraged or because of injustice, if somebody spits in your face[,] which is what he did, that person deserves to be spit on and should expect to be spit on, [but] that is not self-defense. That is spitting[,] but not for purposes of self-defense[,] and the government has proven on this record that the spitting occurred not for reasons of self-defense but for those other reasons. The government correctly argues that every time Ms. Parker is asked, why did you spit on him, the immediate answer is, because he spit on me, and that was said directly on the scene to the police officer. The answer to the same effect was indeed given to the prosecutor, I spit on him because he spit on me, and I directly asked, why did you spit on him. I spit in his face because he came on my property and he spit on me first and there is street justice in that. That is f\u00edne in a sense, in a fairness sense and I will take account of sentencing time but it is not fine when it comes to the law of the District of Columbia because what could have been expected to happen next if that police officer had not been there was that Mr. Powell backed up by his family and surrounding Ms. Parker the way he was and having just been spat on would have made good on some of those threats, not the shoot you threat but the beat the [shit] part of the threat. They had the numbers and they had the anger and they had their expressed motivation.\nThe court concluded that \u201c[f]or all th[e]se reasons ... the government ha[d] proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Parker committed the offense of simple assault and did not spit on Mr. Powell as an act of self-defense.\u201d\nII. Analysis\nWhen a defendant \u201cpresent\u00eds] any evidence that she acted in self-defense,\u201d the government assumes the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that she did not. See Williams (Shirley) v. United States, 90 A.3d 1124, 1128 (D.C. 2014). In this ease, Ms. Parker argues that the government failed to present sufficient evidence that she did not act in self-defense when she spit on Mr. Powell. We review sufficiency of the evidence claims de novo. High v. United States, 128 A.3d 1017, 1020 (D.C. 2015),10 In so doing, \u201cwe consider all the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, according deference to the fact-finder to weigh the evidence, determine the credibility of the witnesses, and draw all justifiable inferences of fact.\u201d Williams (Furl) v. United States, 113 A.3d 554, 560 (D.C. 2015). If we find \u201cno evidence upon which a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d we must reverse. Id.\nHere, the trial court credited Ms. Parker\u2019s testimony that she \u201cwas afraid,\u201d and determined that she subjectively and reasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm from Mr. Pow*843ell11 after he and his family encircled, insulted, and threatened her, and he spit on her. Nevertheless, the court concluded the government had presented sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Parker was not acting in self-defense because it somehow discerned that Ms. Parker\u2019s fear and reasonable belief that she was in imminent danger did not motivate her to spit on Mr. Powell. Instead the court detected from the evidence that Ms. Parker was motivated by \u201cang[er], indignation] or outrage[]\u201d \u2014 a desire to impose what the court called \u201cstreet justice.\u201d\nAs a preliminary matter, we question whether the record supports the court\u2019s finding that Ms. Parker acted out of a purely retributive motive. See High, 128 A.3d at 1020 (noting that we defer to the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations and findings of fact from a bench trial unless they are \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support [them]\u201d (alteration in original)). The government\u2019s only witness, the arresting officer, could not testify to much more than the fact that he had seen Ms. Parker spit on Mr. Powell, and he did not attribute any emotion to her, much less describe her as being angry or indignant. For her part, Ms. Parker never indicated that she had the \u201cstreet justice\u201d motive that the court imputed to her. Moreover, she denied that she was angry, and she was not impeached on this point. In short, the record evidence was that Ms. Parker \u201cwas scared for her life\u201d \u2014 the reasonable inference being that she acted upon her reasonable belief that she was in imminent danger.\nThe trial court\u2019s contrary motive determination appears to be based entirely on Ms. Parker\u2019s initial explanation to the police officer and her subsequent testimony in court that she spit on Mr. Powell because \u201che spit on me first.\u201d12 The court inferred from this explanation that, notwithstanding her credited testimony to the contrary, Ms. Parker was \u201cangry or indignant or outraged\u201d and was motivated to act solely based on these emotions.\nWe are doubtful that Ms. Parker\u2019s admissions that her action was responsive to Mr. Powell\u2019s initial assault can carry the retributive meaning the court ascribed to them. It seems more likely that her statement to the police officer \u2014 who arrived in the midst of the incident and whom Ms. Parker did not see until he approached her to place her under arrest \u2014 was made to ensure that the officer understood the full sequence of events and, in particular, that she was not the first aggressor. Similarly, her response to the court\u2019s \u201cwhy\u201d inquiry, taken in context of her previous and subsequent expressions of fear, seems more susceptible to a benign interpretation that is entirely congruent with her claim of self-defense: to repel the *844reasonably perceived danger, she fought fire with fire; she matched one spitting assault (Mr. Powell\u2019s) with another (hers) to communicate that she would give as good as she got and that Mr. Powell should leave her alone. Furthermore, when considered in the context of her fully'credited testimony, in which she unambiguously related her fear of Mr. Powell, it is difficult if not impossible to accept that Ms. Parker\u2019s he-spit-on-me-first statement alone establishes, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Ms. Parker was motivated solely by a desire to impose \u201cstreet justice.\u201d13 See Williams (Shirley), 90 A.3d at 1129 n.6 (holding that the defendant\u2019s \u201cambiguous statement d[id] not tip the balance of the weight of the evidence to the extent that it dispel[led] any reasonable doubt\u201d that she was acting in self-defense).14 Instead, at most, the evidence supports only a determination that Ms. Parker was motivated to spit on Mr. Powell by a mixture of fear and anger.15\nWe need not decide whether the trial court made a factfinding error, however, because the trial court\u2019s focus on motive begs a more fundamental question of law: if the government fails to disprove that a defendant reasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm, *845can it still carry its burden to rebut a claim of self-defense by showing that there was another motive guiding the defendant\u2019s action? For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that, under this court\u2019s longstanding articulation of the two-part test for the defense of self-defense captured in our standard jury instructions, it cannot.\n\u201cThe essence of the self-defense situation is a reasonable and bona fide belief of the imminence of ... bodily harm.\u201d16 Kinard v. United States, 96 F.2d 522, 526 (D.C. Cir. 1938).17 Thus, in numerous cases, this court has acknowledged that when a claim of self-defense is raised, the threshold question for the fact finder is whether the government has disproved that the \u201cappellant actually and reasonably believed that [s]he was in imminent danger of bodily harm.\u201d Higgenbottom v. United States, 923 A.2d 891, 900 (D.C. 2007).18 And our standard jury instruction on self-defense directs that:\nEvery person has the right to use a reasonable amount of force in self-defense if (1) s/he actually believes s/he is in imminent danger of bodily harm and if (2) s/he has reasonable grounds for that belief. The question is not whether looking back on the incident you believe that the use of force was necessary. The question is whether [name of the defendant], under the circumstances as they appeared to him/her at the time of the incident, actually believed s/he was in imminent danger of bodily harm, and could reasonably hold that belief.\nCriminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.500 (5th ed. rev. 2014) (\u201cSelf Defense \u2014 General Considerations\u201d).19\nIf there is evidence that the defendant actually and reasonably believed herself to be in imminent danger of bodily harm \u2014 i.e., if the government cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not have such a belief\u2014 the inquiry proceeds to the amount of force employed. A defendant may use \u201conly reasonable force to repel the perceived attack.\u201d Higgenbottom, 923 A.2d at 900. Or, rephrased in the context of the government\u2019s burden of proof, \u201c[i]n a situation where the evidence establishes that self-defense would otherwise be justified,\u201d *846the government can rebut a self-defense claim only if it proves that a defendant used \u201cexcessive force.\u201d Williams, 90 A.3d at 1128. But distinguishing what constitutes excessive force from a \u201creasonable amount of force\u201d is not a wholly objective inquiry; the factfinder must take into account evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental state under the circumstances. See Fersner v. United States, 482 A.2d 387, 391-92 (D.C. 1984) (\u201c[T]he victim\u2019s subjective perceptions are the prime determinant of the right to use force \u2014 and the degree of force required \u2014 in self-defense, subject only to the constraint that those perceptions be reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d).20\n[T]he claim of self-defense is not necessarily defeated if, for example, more knife blows than would have seemed necessary in cold blood are struck in the heat of passion generated by the unsought altercation. A belief which may be unreasonable in cold blood may be actually and reasonably entertained in the heat of passion.\nInge v. United States, 356 F.2d 345, 348 (D.C. Cir. 1966).21 The question is thus whether the defendant\u2019s use of force is \u201ca proportionate reaction to the threat that [s]he perceived\u201d while in the heat of the moment. Ewell, 72 A.3d at 130. Again, this is reflected in the standard jury instruction entitled \u201cAmount of Force Permissible,\u201d which explains that a defendant confronting nondeadly force22 may employ \u201ca reasonable amount of force\u201d as informed by her subjective assessment of the circumstances. The instructions first state that \u201c[a] person may use an am,ount of force which, at the time of the incident, s/he actually and reasonably believes is necessary to protect himself/herself from imminent bodily harm.\u201d Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.501.A (emphases added). The instructions further provide that \u201c[a] person acting in the heat of passion, ... does not necessarily lose [her] claim of self-defense by using greater force than would seem necessary to a calm mind. In the heat of passion, a person may actually and reasonably believe something that seems unreasonable to a calm mind.\u201d Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.501. C.\nUnder this construct \u2014 where the first inquiry is whether a defendant actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm and the second inquiry is whether, taking this belief into account, she employed excessive force \u2014 motive is not an additional, separate consideration.23 If the government has not disproved that a defendant actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm, we accept that *847she acted out of that belief.24 See Garibay v. United States, 634 A.2d 946, 948 (D.C. 1993) (explaining the binary motive inquiry by juxtaposing two possible outcomes: \u201ca self-defense claim raises the issue of whether the defendant was acting out of an actual and reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm, or whether, instead, the defendant had some other motive and was, in fact, the aggressor\u201d); see also Rink v. United States, 388 A.2d 52, 56 (D.C. 1978) (holding that motive evidence is admissible to address \u201cwhether appellant reasonably apprehended a danger of imminent, serious bodily harm from the deceased\u201d); Flores v. United States, 698 A.2d 474, 482-83 (D.C. 1997) (citing Garibay to allow evidence of prior violent acts to show that defendant was the first aggressor).25 This construct is reflected in our cases assessing sufficiency of the evidence challenges: claims of self-defense rise or fall on deter*848minations of whether the defendant reasonably believed herself to be in imminent danger of bodily harm or used excessive force.26\nTo our knowledge, this court has never held that, despite evidence that the defendant actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm, her self-defense claim had been adequately disproved on the ground that the defendant had somehow set aside her belief and acted purely out of a different motive\u2014 e.g., anger or a desire for retribution. The government does not cite to any such case.27 And notably, neither does our dissenting colleague.28\nIn Ms. Parker\u2019s case, the trial court as the factfinder concluded that Ms. Parker *849actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm from Mr. Powell. At that point the only question left for the trial court was whether Ms. Parker had employed excessive force. Ms. Parker obviously did not use more force than was reasonable under the circumstances.29 Thus the court should have determined that Ms. Parker acted in self-defense and acquitted her of assault.\nBut instead of acquitting Ms. Parker, the trial court appeared to misuse the inquiry into whether Ms. Parker had used \u201ca reasonable amount of force,\u201d to circle back to Ms. Parker\u2019s motive in responding Mr. Powell\u2019s assault. It is correct that, in order for a factfinder to determine if a defendant employed excessive force, consideration should be given to whether a defendant subjectively perceived a need to employ such force to repel the threat. As explained above, however, this consideration of the defendant\u2019s subjective perceptions is meant to expand the boundaries of what constitutes reasonable force, \u201cby takfing] into account that the defendant was acting in the \u2018heat of conflict.\u2019 \u201d Williams, 90 A.3d at 1128. It is not meant to authorize a factfinder to separately assess a defendant\u2019s motive in responding to a reasonably perceived threat to her safety.30\nAccordingly, we reaffirm that, when self-defense is raised, the proper inquiry with respect to a defendant\u2019s mental state (which motive evidence may inform) is whether she subjectively (and reasonably) believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm. The government bears the burden to prove that a defendant did not hold such a belief. Where, as here, the government fails to meet that burden \u2014 i.e., where it cannot disprove that the defendant subjectively and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm \u2014 and also fails to show that the defendant employed excessive force, the defendant must prevail on her self-defense claim.\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse Ms. Parker\u2019s conviction for simple assault.\n\nSo ordered.\n\n*850Concurring opinion by Senior Judge John M. Ferren.\nDissenting opinion by Associate Judge Phyllis D. Thompson.\n\n. D.C. Code \u00a7 22-404 (a)(1) (2016 Supp.).\n\n\n. For the narrative of the incident, we primarily rely on Ms. Parker\u2019s testimony which the trial court credited in all material respects.\n\n\n. Ms. Parker had no personal relationship with Mr. Powell, but, more than a year prior to this incident, he and Ms. Parker\u2019s daughter had been romantically involved.\n\n\n. She also threw an unopened can of soda into \"the middle of the street,\u201d without hitting Mr. Powell. She explained, \"I didn't throw it at him exactly. I just threw it .... I don't know, I was scared.\u201d\n\n\n. Ms. Parker testified thatshe did not realize a police officer was on the scene until he walked up to her.\n\n\n. According to the officer, by this time \"[h]is family was out. Her family was out .... \u201d\n\n\n. The court appeared to be reading verbatim from the standard jury instruction on \"Self-Defense \u2014 General Considerations.\u201d Criminal *841Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.500 (5th ed. rev. 2014).\n\n\n. Here, it appears the court was referring to the standard jury instruction on \u201cSelf-Defense \u2014 Amount of Force Permissible.\u201d Crimi*842nal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.501. But the court did not read from this instruction verbatim, and thus misapplied it to the facts of this case. See infra p. 845.\n\n\n. It appears that either the court reporter failed to transcribe the word \u201cnot,\u201d or that the trial court misspoke.\n\n\n. Sufficiency claims implicate the Due Process Clause, which requires that \"no person shall be made to suffer the onus of a criminal conviction except upon sufficient proof \u2014 defined as evidence necessary to convince a trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of every element of the offense.\u201d Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 316, 99 S.Ct 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).\n\n\n. The trial court and Ms. Parker herself described her response to her encounter with Mr. Powell in terms of fear. To clarify, fear is an emotion that is presumably often experienced by a person who has a right to defend herself. And evidence of fear will support a conclusion that that person actually and reasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm. But if a person is confident in her ability to defend herself and does not feel afraid when she is placed in a situation where she actually and reasonably believes that she is in imminent danger of bodily harm, she would still have a right to act to prevent that harm and later claim self-defense.\n\n\n. The government had highlighted this testimony for the court, but for the distinct purpose of proving that Ms. Parker did not subjectively believe she was in imminent danger of bodily harm. Although the government now seeks to defend the trial court\u2019s separate motive analysis, it did not seek to rebut Ms. Parker\u2019s claim of self-defense on this basis at trial.\n\n\n. Our dissenting colleague asserts that the court\u2019s statements \"reflect a recognition that what was missing each time from appellant's explanation of why she spit on [Mr.] Powell was any statement to the effect that she spit on him in an effort to protect herself from harm.\u201d Post, at 857 (dissenting opinion). But Ms. Parker repeatedly made it clear that she was afraid of Mr. Powell. And it was not Ms. Parker's burden to prove that she acted in self-defense; it was the government\u2019s burden to prove that she did not.\n\n\n. In Williams, we held that a defendant\u2019s statement while holding a knife \u2014 \u201cYou think I\u2019m crazy? I\u2019m going to show you crazy\u201d\u2014 was subject to at least \"two reasonable interpretations\u201d: (1) she was \"letting others know whom she felt were out to do her harm that she was willing to defend herself, even so far as using the knife\u201d; or (2) she was making a threat. Id. at 1129 n.6. And thus we held that the statement could not be relied upon by the government to carry its burden to disprove the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.\n\n\n. Evidence that a defendant has mixed emotions, however, will not defeat a claim of self-defense. Again, the proper inquiry is whether the defendant believed she was in imminent danger, not whether she was or was not fearful. See supra note 11. Moreover, as humans rarely experience one emotion at a time, it is only to be expected that, in a situation where a person might need to act in self-defense, she will experience some mix of fear and anger or indignation or vindictiveness. Cf. Brown v. United States, 256 U.S. 335, 343, 41 S.Ct. 501, 65 L.Ed. 961 (1921) (noting that as the common law of self-defense has evolved over time, \"it has tended in the direction of rules consistent with human nature\u201d). Thus, if the government could carry its burden to disprove a claim of self-defense simply by establishing that a defendant who actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger also experienced other emotions or had mixed motives, self-defense claims would be severely curtailed, if not eliminated entirely. See People v. Nguyen, 61 Cal.4th 1015, 191 Cal.Rptr.3d 182, 354 P.3d 90, 113 (2015) (\"[I]t would be unreasonable to require an absence of any feeling other than fear, before [use of force] could be considered justifiable [self-defense].\u201d); State v. Adviento, 319 P.3d 1131, 1157 (Haw. 2014) (observing that \"actions taken in self-defense may indeed be committed while the defendant is subject to a certain degree of terror, resentment, rage or anger\u201d); Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 10.4 (c) (2d ed.) (noting that a defendant acting in self-defense \"does not lose the defense because [s]he acts with some less admirable motive in addition to that of defending [herjself,\u201d as in a situation where the defendant also \"us[es] force upon h[er] adversary because [s]he hates him\u201d). In short, the government will prevail over a claim of self-defense only when it proves that the defendant did not reasonably believe that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm, see infra p. 863 \u2014 not when it proves the defendant reasonably experienced other emotions.\n\n\n. The requisite level of reasonably perceived danger is different, depending on whether the defendant employed deadly or nondeadly force: \"where an accused, claiming self-defense, uses deadly force, he must \u2014 at the time of the incident \u2014 actually believe and reasonably believe that he is in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm; whereas one utilizing nondeadly force must show that he reasonably believed that [some] harm was imminent.\u201d Ewell v. United States, 72 A.3d 127, 131 (D.C. 2013).\n\n\n. Decisions of the D.C. Circuit prior to February 1, 1971, are binding on this court per M.A.P. v. Ryan, 285 A.2d 310, 312 (D.C. 1971).\n\n\n. See also Kittle v. United States, 65 A.3d 1144, 1158 (D.C. 2013) (\u201cTo invoke self-defense, there must be some evidence that; \u2018(1) [appellant] actually believed he was in imminent danger of bodily harm, and (2) he had reasonable grounds for that belief.\u2019\") (quoting Guillard v. United States, 596 A.2d 60, 63 (D.C. 1991)); Snell v. United States, 754 A.2d 289, 290 (D.C. 2000) (\"Reasonable force may be used in self-defense if the actor reasonably believes that he or she is in imminent danger of bodily harm.\u201d); McPhaul v. United States, 452 A.2d 371, 374 &amp; n.2 (D.C. 1982) (upholding the instructions that \"emphasized the general concept of the self-defense doctrine\u201d and told the jury, inter alia, that the defendant had a right to act in self-defense if \"one, he actually believes he is in imminent danger of bodily harm; and, two, if he has reasonable grounds for that belief\u201d).\n\n\n.Nearly identical standard instructions have been employed in the District since 1972. See Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 5.13 (2d ed, 1972) (\u201cSelf Defense \u2014 General Considerations\u201d).\n\n\n, See id. at 391 (\"The right of self-defense, and especially the degree of force the victim is permitted to use to prevent bodily harm, is premised substantially on the victim\u2019s own reasonable perceptions of what is happening.\u201d).\n\n\n. See also Brown, 256 U.S. at 343, 41 S.Ct. 501 (\u201cDetached reflection cannot be demanded in the presence of an uplifted knife.\u201d); Williams (Shirley), 90 A.3d at 1128 (\"[T]he fact-finder must take into account that the defendant was acting in the \u2018heat of the conflict.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Brown, 256 U.S. at 344, 41 S.Ct. 501); Perry v. United States, 422 F.2d 697, 698 (D.C. Cir. 1969) (citing Inge and reaffirming that the fact-finder must \"consider ... whether the defender in the heat of an attack actually entertained a belief which would be unreasonable in one acting in cold blood\u201d).\n\n\n. There is an analogous instruction for use of deadly force. Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.501.B,\n\n\n. Our colleague in dissent faults us for relying on \"truncated discussions of the law of self-defense,\u201d post, at 860 (dissenting opinion), but these discussions capture the operative core of our test for self-defense and fully align with our standard jury instructions.\nBy contrast, the dissent seeks to create a new, additional requirement that a defendant *847must have \"believed that her action ... was necessary to save herself.\u201d Post, at 855 (dissenting opinion) (brackets omitted) (emphasis added); see also id. at 49-50 &amp; n.7, 60-61. But the dissent's separate subjective \"necessity\u201d test has no support in the decisions of this court. To be sure, the admonition in Holmes v. United States, 11 F.2d 569, 574 (D.C. Cir, 1926), that \"the law of self-defense is a law of necessity,\u201d has been often quoted by this court; but it does not authorize a distinct inquiry into a defendant\u2019s subjective assessment of the necessity or likely effectiveness of her actions. Rather, in Holmes (a murder case), the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to determine that it was not \"necessary\u201d for the defendant to employ deadly force in self-defense, either because the \"appellant did not believe himself in imminent danger when he handed a weapon to [his co-defendant], requesting him to use it,\u201d or because his use of force to resist a lawful arrest was excessive. Id.\nAll of the cases cited by our dissenting colleague that refer to \"necessity\u201d support this understanding of the law of self-defense. They discuss necessity either in the context of step one of our self-defense test, examining whether the defendant reasonably believed he was in imminent danger of bodily harm, see, e.g., Edwards v. United States, 721 A.2d 938, 941, 943 (D.C. 1998) (cited post, at 855 n.1 (dissenting opinion)), or in the context of step two of our self-defense test, examining whether the defendant employed excessive force, see Travers v. United States, 124 A.3d 634, 639 (2015); Higgenbottom, 923 A.2d at 900-01; McPhaul, 452 A,2d at 373 n.1. In addition, the dissent cites one case, Potter v. United States, 534 A.2d 943, 946 (D.C. 1987) (cited post, at 859 (dissenting opinion)), that does not reference \"necessity\u201d at all and conducts a step one analysis to conclude that a self-defense instruction should have been given, because a jury could have found that defendant \"believe[d], reasonably, that he had to throw a brick to fend off imminent bodily harm.\u201d The dissent cannot point to a single case where this court has indicated \u2014 much less held \u2014 that, even where a defendant actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm and employed a reasonable amount of force, the government may yet disprove a claim of self-defense on the ground that the defendant did not subjectively believe her use of force was \"necessaty to save herself.\u201d In short, the majority opinion is firmly grounded in the law of this jurisdiction; the dissent is not.\n\n\n. In a circumstance where a person actually and reasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm, it would be functionally impossible for the government to prove beyond a reasonable' doubt. that the defendant\u2019s (actual and reasonable) belief was not, at the very least, a significant component of the motivation behind actions that the defendant took. Our dissenting colleague concedes the difficulty, post, at 860 (dissenting opinion), but does not address (on these facts or more generally) how a trial court could possibly determine that the government had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant, who actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger, had a different guiding motive, id.\n\n\n. Conversely, if the defendant is shown not to have actually and subjectively believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm because the evidence establishes that the defendant acted solely out of anger or because she had an axe to grind, her self-defense claim would fail at the first step. See, e.g., Brown, 256 U.S. at 344, 41 S.Ct. 501 (noting that, where the defendant and decedent had a *848contentious history, the jury might have thought that the defendant \"had not sufficient reason to think that his life was in danger at that time, that he exceeded the limits of reasonable self defen[s]e or even that he was the attacking party\u201d); Kittle, 65 A.3d at 1159 (determining that the complainant\u2019s testimony that his action to restrain defendant made him \" \u2018mad\u2019 .... indicates that appellant did not wish to be held by [the complainant], [and] does not establish that appellant was frightened or believed that he was in imminent harm\u201d so as to provide a basis for a reasonable doubt instruction); Snell, 754 A.2d at 290-91 (concluding that, where evidence established, inter alia, that appellant \"had been involved in a prior violent confrontation,\u201d the trial court \"applied the relevant standard, namely, that there was evidence upon which a reasonable mind could find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant did not reasonably believe he was in imminent danger of bodily harm\u201d).\n\n\n. Of course, where the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was \"the [first] aggressor\u201d or \"provoked the conflict upon herself,\u201d the fact-finder need not even reach the core self-defense inquiry. See Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.504.A.\n\n\n. In its brief, the government asserts that it was \"permissibl[e]\u201d for the trial court to determine that Ms. Parker\u2019s \"desire to retaliate against Mr. Powell for spitting on her first\u201d overrode its determination that Ms. Parker subjectively and reasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm. But the only authority from this court the government cites for this proposition is Medley v. United States, 104 A.3d 115 (D.C. 2014). In Medley, we adhered to Garibay and reaffirmed that motive evidence \u2014 in that case, \"outrage\u201d at the victim for giving drugs to the defendant's girlfriend \u2014 is admissible to negate a defendant's narrative that he was subjectively afraid. Id. at 129. We did not hold, or even suggest, that once the court had concluded that the defendant was subjectively afraid, such outrage could be independently considered to establish the defendant\u2019s \"true\u201d motive.\nThe government also cites two unpublished decisions from the intermediate appellate court of Kansas (which have no precedential authority even in that jurisdiction and are not favored for citation under Kansas Supreme Court Rule 7.04 (f)) where spitting was found, based on the facts alleged, not to be an act of self-defense (while recognizing that there might be factual scenarios where it would be). But in each of these cases, the intermediate appellate court concluded that the evidence did not support a determination that the defendants subjectively and reasonably believed they were in danger of bodily harm. State v. White, No. 105488, 275 P.3d 931, 2012 WL 1649841, at *3 (Kan. Ct. App. May 4, 2012) (\u201cThere was no need for [defendant] to defend himself from any imminent use of unlawful force when he spit on [victim].\u201d); State v.

App. July 15, 2011) (\"[Defendant\u2019s spitting was not done in defense of any imminent use of unlawful force.\u201d).\n\n\n.See note 23 supra. Accordingly, our dissenting colleague\u2019s assertion, post, at 863 (dissenting opinion), that we are somehow disregarding binding precedent in contravention of M.A.P. v. Ryan, 285 A.2d 310, 312 (D.C. 1971), is without foundation. The invocation of M.A.P. v. Ryan is especially confusing given our dissenting colleague\u2019s concession that \u201cuntil now\u201d this court has never been confronted with a case where, as here, the question was \"whether the defendant used force that was so predictably ineffectual as to not *849qualify as force the defendant believed was necessary to protect herself.\u201d Post, at 861 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n. \"Our cases upholding determinations of excessive force 'uniformly involve situations where the secondary, responsive aggression was completely disproportionate to the initial aggression faced.\u2019 \u201d Williams, 90 A.3d at 1128 (quoting Gay v. United States, 12 A.3d 643, 649 (D.C. 2011)). The government never argued at trial that Ms. Parker\u2019s act of spitting back was disproportionate to being spit upon. To the extent the government now suggests that the act of spitting is inherently intemperate and cannot be self-defense as a matter of law, this division unanimously disagrees. See post, at 858 n.6 (dissenting opinion). We see no reason why, when a defendant reasonably believes herself to be in imminent danger, spitting should be distinguished from other types of assaultive conduct, particularly when being spit on is part of the conduct that induces the defendant\u2019s belief.\n\n\n. Nor is our concern under the excessive force inquiry the use of too little force. One of the trial court's reasons for rejecting Ms. Parker\u2019s claim of self-defense, seemingly embraced by our dissenting colleague, post, at 844 n.6 (dissenting opinion); see also id. at 861-63, was because, in the court\u2019s view, Ms. Parker\u2019s response was so ineffectual, it had no deterrent value and, had the police not been on site, was likely only to have only prompted a more severe response from Mr. Powell and his family. Again, we do not expect people to be purely rational actors in selecting the proper amount of force to use in response to a reasonably perceived threat to their safety, and we certainly have no desire to encourage individuals to make more aggressive showings of force to ensure they have a legal right to self-defense.\n\n",

            "opinion_text": "\nFerren, Senior Judge,\nconcurring:\nI join the opinion of the court and write separately only to reinforce it with some additional perspective.\nI.\nThis is a strange case. A man shouts an ugly slur against his neighbor across the street as she is getting into a friend\u2019s car. He then crosses the street with members of his family, calls her a \u201cbitch\u201d (and more), and spits in her face as his family surrounds the car and hurls insults. She spits back. Others arrive (apparently including members of her family), and a shouting match ensues. In the meantime, a police officer has appeared in time to see her spit (but not to see her aggressor do so). The officer arrests her for simple assault, and she is charged.\nIn a bench trial the court finds that appellant \u201cactually did fear\u201d and \u201creasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm,\u201d having testified that she was \u201cscared for my life, like I didn\u2019t know what they were going to do.\u201d But the court disallows her claim of self-defense, concluding that her principal reason for spitting in response to her aggressor\u2019s liquid assault was that \u201che came on my property and ... spit on me first\u201d\u2014 words of anger, indignation, and outrage, said the court, not words of defense against attack. Moreover, the trial court appears to believe that mere spitting, while noxious though not excessive, was not an authentic defensive move. The court\u2019s ultimate characterization of her mindset \u2014 that she sought \u201cstreet justice,\u201d not self-protection, in spitting back \u2014 summarizes the court\u2019s rejection of self-defense.\nThe issue here, therefore, is whether a victim\u2019s court-established fear of imminent bodily harm, coupled with non-excessive force \u2014 however weak \u2014 in response, is enough to justify a claim of self-defense; or whether that fear and response, once established without retraction, can be negated by additional findings that the victim\u2019s dominant mindset was a desire for retribution, and that the force used was too lame to evidence either a fearful mindset or an attempt at self-protection.\nThe theory of the dissent is twofold:\n[T]he [1] necessary state-of-mind inquiry is not fully satisfied upon a conclusion that the defendant actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm, and ... [2] the self-defense analysis also is not complete upon a further conclusion that the amount of force used was not excessive. Post, at 861.\nRespectfully, I believe the dissenting theory is flawed.\nFirst, it presupposes a threshold trial-court analysis of the defendant\u2019s mindset that requires a probe of her motives and emotions, even after establishing her actual and reasonable belief of imminent bodily harm. According to the dissent, such a probe, without precedent, can cancel a court\u2019s firm finding of the level of fear that the case law unequivocally says will justify a self-defense instruction (absent unreasonable force).\nSecond, the dissent\u2019s theory posits, again without precedent, that the force used can be so weak that it not only negates any effort for self-protection (thereby negating a court-established belief of imminent bodily harm) but also negates the \u201creasonable force\u201d limitation on self-defense by suggesting that an ineffectual *851response was too weak to be \u201creasonable\u201d \u2014 a limitation that traditionally disqualifies only excessive force.\nFinally, the dissent offers no case law that says a retributive motive ultimately displaces the justification for self-defense even though the trial court has found, without qualification, that the defendant actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm.\nThese concerns require elaboration.\nII.\nI agree with Judge Easterly that, when evidence supports a claim of self-defense, the government has the burden of disproving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant (1) actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm and, in the event of such belief, (2) used only reasonable \u2014 meaning non-excessive \u2014 force to repel the attack. Ante, at 844-46.\nOur dissenting colleague, however, advises that appellant failed to satisfy a third step: that despite an unequivocal, conclusive finding that appellant believed herself to be in imminent danger of bodily harm\u2014 a belief that, ordinarily would justify self-defense (when coupled with reasonable force) \u2014 the government can disprove the defense by satisfying the court that an additional motive negated her belief, and that the force employed was weak, not defensive.\nI am not persuaded. In the first place, the dissent does not dispute the trial court\u2019s unequivocal, unmodified first-step finding that appellant \u201creasonably believed\u201d and \u201cactually did fear that she was in danger of imminent bodily harm.\u201d Ante at 841. Therefore, the dissent\u2019s conclusion that this finding is not enough to justify a claim of self-defense (absent unreasonable force) must come either (1) from a source outside the two required self-defense findings, or (2) from a second-step finding that the force used was not \u201creasonable\u201d; that is, instead of being excessive (the traditional ground for unreasonable force), the force of appellant\u2019s spitting was so unreasonably lame that, along with appellant\u2019s testimony, it nullified any motive of self-protection.\nThe dissent appears to take both positions. On the one hand, the dissent says the opinion for the court \u201cfail[s] to give due attention to the lead-in clause that dictates when the \u2018two-part\u2019 test is applicable,\u201d namely, that \u201c[e]very person has the right to use a reasonable amount of force in self-defense if\u2019 steps one and two are satisfied. Post, at 859, 859 n.8 (emphasis omitted). This quoted lead-in clause essentially says no more than that everyone is entitled to self-defense by meeting the two requirements for self-defense; it does not give life to an additional criterion that would nullify self-defense even when the two specified requirements are satisfied.\nOn the other hand, the dissent relies, in the alternative, on appellant\u2019s spitting \u2014 a \u201cpredictably ineffectual,\u201d \u201ctit-for-tat act[] of retaliation,\u201d post, at 858 n.6, 861 \u2014 to undermine the sufficiency of the trial court\u2019s first-step finding that appellant\u2019s fear of imminent bodily harm justified self-defense (absent unreasonable force). Under this approach, the dissent\u2019s source of erosion of that first-step finding has to be the court\u2019s second-step assessment of \u201creasonable force.\u201d That is to say, the dissent has to mean that appellant did not \u201cactually\u201d and \u201creasonably\u201d believe that the weak force used \u2014 her spitting \u2014 would be enough to protect her against \u201cimminent bodily harm.\u201d I have problems with this analysis.\nFirst, this analysis does not appear in the trial court\u2019s findings, quoted at length in the dissent. Post, at 856-57. Although the trial court speculated that appellant\u2019s *852spitting response to her assailant had no deterrent value, ante, at 849 n.30, the court focused almost exclusively on appellant\u2019s expressed motivation \u2014 \u201cstreet justice\u201d; \u201che spit on me first\u201d \u2014 not on a perceived weakness in appellant\u2019s response as an independent basis for discounting her fearful, step-one mindset. Thus, absent any assertion that spitting can never count as \u201creasonable force\u201d \u2014 indeed, the dissent agrees that on occasion it can, post, at 858 n.6 \u2014 I am concerned about appellate court fact-finding to bolster the dissent\u2019s analysis.\nSecond, according to the government\u2019s brief, the trial court \u2014 unlike the dissent\u2014 found that appellant, through her words, was motivated solely \u201cby her desire to retaliate,\u201d a finding inconsistent with the court\u2019s threshold finding that appellant had \u201creasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm.\u201d Post, at 856. Thus, the court never questioned that spitting constituted reasonable force under the circumstances, and not even the prosecution has espoused the dissent\u2019s reliance on the second-step (reasonable force) inquiry to inform the step-one (belief of imminent bodily harm) inquiry.\nThird, I cannot agree that appellant\u2019s spitting can disqualify her from claiming self-defense because of its presumed weakness as a response to the neighbor who spit at her first. Appellant\u2019s response was \u201ca proportionate reaction to the threat that [s]he perceived.\u201d1 The trial court\u2019s perception that this response was not a reasonable deterrent to acceleration of the affray, ante, at 849 n.30 \u2014 ie., that (in the dissent\u2019s words) the spitting was \u201cpredictably ineffectual,\u201d post, at 861 \u2014 is supported only by speculation. If it is true (as I believe) that the trial court\u2019s step-one finding entitled appellant to claim self-defense (when coupled with reasonable force), I cannot believe, given the absence of supportive case law, that ineffectual force can be deemed unreasonable simply because it is too lame rather than excessive.\nFinally, I will assume for sake of argument that a step-two, \u201creasonable force\u201d inquiry could inform a step-one, belief-of-imminent bodily harm inquiry \u2014 e.g., that a weak response to an attacker might signal that the defendant did not actually and reasonably believe that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm. But once that belief of imminent harm is established by a trial court finding, as in this case, it cannot be erased by invoking step two. My reasons follow.\nIII.\nAccording to the court\u2019s opinion, the victim\u2019s actual perceptions will inform whether the force used under the circumstances is reasonable. Ante, at 845-46. For example, the intensity of an imminent threat of bodily injury may provoke a frenzied retaliation in self-defense, such as a hail of bullets, that ordinarily might seem excessive but in context appears reasonable.2 Or, in the case of a \u201cbattered spouse\u201d defense, a wife\u2019s misperception that her husband was imminently threatening her life might justify a finding that her stabbing him was reasonable under the circumstances.3 Therefore, when the most recent iteration of the criminal jury *853instruction for non-deadly force says, with regard to the second step, that one \u201cmay use an amount of force which, at the time of the incident, s/he actually and reasonably believes is necessary to protect himself/herself from imminent bodily harm,\u201d4 this subjective inquiry \u2014 \u201cactually believes\u201d \u2014 is directed exclusively at the necessity of the force used, not at the motive for self-defense.5 This, then, is the crucial distinction between the court\u2019s opinion and the dissent: \u201cActual\u201d belief is included in step two of the self-defense inquiry only to explain what force may be \u201creasonable\u201d from the viewpoint of the defendant; it is not used as a potential offset to a firm, threshold finding of actual and reasonable belief of imminent bodily harm. Once the fact-finder (court or jury) has made that step-one finding, self-defense with reasonable (not excessive) force is justified without more. And nothing in our case law justifies canceling that finding \u2014 unless the court first erases it as a mistake, which did not happen here.\nThe dissent acknowledges that not all mixed motives necessarily preclude an assertion of self-defense. Post, at 844.6 But I have no idea what the dissent\u2019s formula is for deciding how many elements of retributive anger will dilute the unrebutted belief of imminent bodily harm to the point that the retributive motive can be found-as the dissent requires \u2014 to be \u201csolely retaliatory and not defensive.\u201d Post, at 860. Indeed, the dissent itself indicates how difficult it is to sort out motives. It \u201cacknowledge[s] that sometimes a defendant may be less than fully articulate or less than candid about her reason for acting.\u201d Post, at 862 n.14. Manifestly, therefore, in light of the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s level of fear satisfied step one of the self-defense criteria, I do not understand how this court could conclude, with confidence, that appellant\u2019s motive was \u201csolely retaliatory and not defensive.\u201d After all, in addition to justifying her response in part by saying \u201che spit on me first,\u201d she also credibly testified, \u201cI was scared for my life, like I didn\u2019t know what they were going to do.\u201d\nJudge Easterly\u2019s opinion for the court properly rejects a second-guess, weighing- and-balancing exercise once the trial court has found, without limitation, that the defendant experienced the belief of imminent bodily harm necessary to justify self-defense. I agree that it would be superfluous, indeed confusing, and contrary to the trial court\u2019s unequivocal step-one finding, to try to sort out other motives that may be at work.\nIn sum, the fact that the defendant may have had a mixed mentality \u2014 great fear coupled with retributive anger \u2014 is irrelevant here. The latter cannot be used to negate the former once a defendant\u2019s fear itself has been found, without caveat, to justify the use of reasonable force in self-defense.\n*854IY.\nI add here, finally, a postscript to explain some of the jury instructions, as supported by relevant case law, that inform the majority\u2019s analysis. It is interesting to note, first, that the criminal jury instruction for non-deadly force \u2014 the force used in this case of simple assault \u2014 had initially required, for the second-step inquiry, only that the defendant had \u201creasonably believe[d]\u201d \u2014 not \u201cactually and reasonably believe[dj\u201d \u2014 that the amount of force used in self-defense was \u201cnecessary to protect himself/herself from imminent bodily harm.\u201d7 Moreover, until the court\u2019s opinion in this case, the law applicable to simple assault has not acknowledged a subjective component of the second step of a self-defense analysis.8 Thus, the dissent\u2019s apparent reliance on appellant\u2019s \u201cactual\u201d belief about the level of force required to dispel a mindset of fear justifying self-defense \u2014 derived from the second step of the self-defense inquiry (reasonable force)9 \u2014has no prior case law support.\nIn 2009, the pertinent criminal jury instruction for use of non-deadly force was amended to conform to the one traditionally used for deadly force.10 Presumably, therefore, the defendant who uses non-deadly force today must have both \u201cactually and reasonably believe[d]\u201d that the force used was necessary for self-protection.11 *855For purposes of analysis, the opinion for the court, as well as the dissent, relies on that updated formulation here.12 Moreover, the case law applicable to deadly force, most notably (though not exclusively) in homicide cases, has traditionally required that same, dual belief.13 No explanation is offered with the 2009 instruction as to why the amendment for non-deadly force was adopted, but as explained above in section III, addition of \u201cactual\u201d to \u201creasonable\u201d belief assures attention to the defendant\u2019s subjective viewpoint in determining whether the defendant\u2019s belief in the necessity of the force used was reasonable under the circumstances. It does not advert to the threshold, step-one mindset required to justify self-defense.\nV.\nI cannot help feeling that if appellant had whacked her assailant rather than spit on him, there would have been little, if any, basis for questioning whether a self-defense instruction (from the court to itself) was available in this case. Indeed, our dissenting colleague seems to agree. Post, at 858 n.6. But apparently the trial court rejected self-defense not because appellant lacked the belief of imminent bodily harm required to justify self-defense but, at least in part, because the court believed that the defensive response was too lame \u2014 a curious concern because the forbidden response, unreasonable force, is force too violent, not too weak (a puzzling concern our dissenting colleague shares).\nTo justify the dissent\u2019s analysis, the trial court might have withheld or revoked its threshold finding that appellant \u201cactually did fear\u201d and \u201creasonably believed\u201d that she was \u201cin danger of imminent bodily harm.\u201d But the court couldn\u2019t, and thus wouldn\u2019t, and therefore didn\u2019t \u2014 thereby precluding the analysis that our dissenting colleague presents.\n\u215d \u215d \u215c \u2021 \u215d\nFor the reasons expressed above, I join the opinion of the court.\n\n. Ewell v. United States, 72 A.3d 127, 130 (D.C. 2013).\n\n\n. See Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.501C (5th ed. rev. 2016) (\"In the heat of passion, a person may actually and reasonably believe something that seems unreasonable to a calm mind.\u201d); id.

See Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.501A (5th ed. rev. 2016) (quoted infra).\n\n\n. This interpretation is consistent with our recent, reorganized formulation of self-defense in a homicide case, Bassil v. United States, 147 A.3d 303 (D.C. 2016), explaining self-defense as (1) an honest believe of \"imminent danger of serious bodily harm or death\u201d and the \"need[] to use deadly force to save [one]self from that danger,\u201d coupled with (2) a requirement that \"both those beliefs were objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\" Id. at 307.\n\n\n.See LaFave, supra note 3, \u00a7 10.4 (c) (\u201c[I]f [one] acts in proper self-defense, he does not lose the defense because he acts with some less admirable motive in addition to that of defending himself, as where he enjoys using force upon his adversary because he hates him.\u201d).\n\n\n. Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 5.13A (4th ed, rev, 2008), provides in full:\nA person may use a reasonable amount of force in self-defense, A person may use an amount of force which, at the time of the incident, s/he reasonably believes is necessary to protect himself/herself from imminent bodily harm. (Emphasis added).\n\n\n. See Ewell v. United States, 72 A.3d 127, 131-32 (D.C. 2013) (simple assault); Snell v. United States, 754 A.2d 289, 290 (D.C. 2000) (simple assault); Guillard v. United States, 596 A.2d 60, 63 (D.C. 1991) (simple assault); Potter v. United States, 534 A.2d 943, 945-46 (D.C. 1987) (simple assault); see also Kittle v. United States, 65 A.3d 1144, 1158 (D.C. 2013) (assault and felony threats); Higgenbottom v, United States, 923 A.2d 891, 900 (D.C. 2007) (assault with intent to kill while armed, aggravated assault while armed, assault with a dangerous weapon, mayhem while armed); McPhaul v. United States, 452 A.2d 371, 373-74 (D.C. 1982) (assault with a deadly weapon).\nIn Ewell, this court reversed a conviction for simple assault, holding (in part) that the trial court had erroneously instructed the jury on the use of deadly, not non-deadly, force in self-defense. Relying on McPhaul and Snell, we held that, for non-deadly force, a defendant had to meet a \u201cless onerous standard,\u201d showing only \u201ca reasonable belief that he was in imminent danger of bodily harm,\u201d 72 A.2d at 131, whereas for deadly force the defendant had to show both an \"honest[]\" and a \"reasonabl[e]\u201d belief that \u201che was in imminent danger of serious bodily harm.\u201d Id. at 132 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). In a footnote, the court also referenced the different instructions for deadly and non-deadly force in the Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia Nos. 9.501A and 9.501B (5th ed. 2009), in order to evidence the distinction between \u201cbodily harm\u201d and \"serious bodily harm,\u201d Presumably in light of binding case law, however, the court did not address the change from the fourth (2008) edition of the Instructions in 9.501 A: that self-defense with non-deadly force henceforth required a showing that the defendant \"actually,\u201d as well as \"reasonably,\u201d believed the amount of force used \"was necessary to protect himselRherself from imminent bodily harm.\u201d\n\n\n. See supra section III (explaining \"the crucial distinction between the court\u2019s opinion and the dissent\u201d).\n\n\n. See Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.501A (5th ed. 2009). This formulation of Instruction No. 9.501A remains unchanged and is found in the most recent (2016) revised version of the Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia.\n\n\n. Instruction No. 9.501A, see supra note 9, provides in full:\nA person may use a reasonable amount of force in self-defense. A person may use an *855amount of force which, at the time of the incident, s/he actually and reasonably believes is necessary to protect himself/herself from imminent bodily harm. (Emphasis added),\n\n\n. Years ago, in an opinion concerning defense of a third person, we acknowledged that \"[t]he right of self-defense, and especially the degree of force the victim is permitted to use to prevent bodily harm, is premised substantially on the victim\u2019s own reasonable perceptions of what is happening.\u201d Fersner v. United States, 482 A.2d 387, 391 (D.C. 1984).\n\n\n. The decision underlying the line of homicide self-defense cases is United States v. Peterson, 483 F.2d 1222, 1229-30 (D.C. Cir. 1973). See Bassil v. United States, 147 A.3d 303, 306-07 (D.C. 2016); Richardson v. United States, 98 A.3d 178, 187 (D.C. 2014); Edwards v. United States, 721 A.2d 938, 941 (D.C. 1998); Smith v. United States, 686 A.2d 537, 544 (D.C. 1996), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 839, 118 S.Ct. 115, 139 L.Ed.2d 67 (1997); Swann v. United States, 648 A.2d 928, 930 (D.C. 1994); Brown v. United States, 619 A.2d 1180, 1182 (D.C. 1992).\nIn particularly violent assault cases which do not result in homicide, a deadly force instruction for self-defense may be appropriate. See, e.g., Travers v. United States, 124 A.3d 634, 639 (D.C. 2015) (felony assault and mayhem); Freeman v. United States, 912 A.2d 1213, 1220 (D.C. 2006) (assault with intent to kill while armed); Harper v. United States, 608 A.2d 152, 155 (D.C. 1992) (assault with a dangerous weapon); LaFave, supra note 3, \u00a7 10.4 (a).\n\n",

Why is it that you spit in [Powell\u2019s] face?\nMS. PARKER: Because he came on my property and he came and spit on me first, ma\u2019am, that\u2019s why.\nLater, during defense counsel\u2019s re-direct examination of appellant, the court cautioned counsel against asking leading questions, explaining that:\nTHE COURT: [T]he answer is not going to be credible if the question is leading[,] and it is an important point in my fact finding responsibility whether she spit in his face out of a sense of anger and vindication and fairness and justice or whether she spit in his face as a form of self-defense. That is a critical question of fact for me ....\nDefense counsel then asked appellant again why she took the actions she took. She answered:\nMS. PARKER: It was just that he spit in my face and I felt scared with the way they approached me that day. They approached me in a very scary situation. I had a lot of people come approach me at one time and I really did not know what I did or what I did wrong for him to say he was going to smack me and walk on my property and then to spit in my face.\nThis echoed appellant\u2019s earlier direct testimony that, \u201cI just know that I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d The court thereafter denied defense counsel\u2019s (renewed) motion for judgment of acquittal, stating that \u201ca reasonable juror based on this record would be able to find that the defendant did what she did, performed the act of spitting not in self-defense but in anger and indignation\u201d (emphasis added).\nAfter closing arguments, the court found that appellant \u201creasonably believed that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm.\u201d The court nevertheless ruled that the government had \u201ccarried its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that with respect to the ... spitting, self-defense was not in play[.]\u201d In explaining its ruling, the court said the following:\nTHE COURT: [I]n order for self-defense to apply[,] she has to use a reasonable amount of force in self-defense. Using a reasonable amount of force because she is angry or indignant or outraged or because of injustice, if somebody spits in your face which is what he did, that person deserves to be spit on and should expect to be spit on, that is not self-defense. That is spitting but not for purposes of self-defense and the government has proven on this record that *857the spitting occurred not for reasons of self-defense but for those other reasons.\n[[Image here]]\n[E]very time [appellant] is asked, why did you spit on him, the immediate answer is, because he spit on me, and that was said directly on the scene to the police officer.[2] The answer to the same effect was indeed given to the prosecutor, I spit on him because he spit on me, and I directly asked, why did you spit on him. [Appellant\u2019s answer was] I spit in his face because he came on my property and he spit on me first and there is street justice in that, (emphasis added).\nFurther explaining its finding, the court referred to \u201cwhat could have been expected to happen next if that police officer had not been there\u201d when appellant spit on Powell. Crediting appellant\u2019s testimony to the effect that Powell was \u201cbacked up by his mother\u201d and that \u201chalf a dozen members of his family were also approaching [appellant] and backing him up[,]\u201d the court reasoned that:\nTHE COURT: Powell[,] backed up by his family and surrounding [appellant] the way he was and having just been spat on[,] would have made good on some of th[e] threats [he had made to appellant], not the shoot you threatf,] but the beat the S part of the threat. [Powell\u2019s side] had the numbers and they had the anger and they had their expressed motivation.\nThe court found that appellant \u201cdid not spit on Mr. Powell as an act of self-defense[,]\u201d i.e., that \u201cthe spitting occurred not for reasons of self-defense but for those other reasons.\u201d\nB.\nThe court\u2019s statements quoted above reflect a recognition that what was missing each time from appellant\u2019s explanation of why she spit on Powell was any statement to the effect that she spit on him in an effort to protect herself from harm.3 Appellant had every opportunity to respond, \u201cI spit on Powell to make him and his family go away\u201d or \u201cto make them stop bothering me,\u201d or something to that effect,4 but she gave no such response (and instead repeatedly mentioned not only Powell\u2019s having spit at her when she had done nothing wrong, but also the affront of his coming onto her property). Nor did appellant describe her act of spitting on Powell as a merely reflexive action, as she had effectively done when explaining why she threw a can into the street (an action she took, according to the officer, before she spit on Powell):\nMS PARKER: I threw [the can] in the middle of the street. I didn\u2019t throw it at *858him exactly. I just threw it, the can. I just threw the can. I don\u2019t know, I was seared. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\nThe court\u2019s statements quoted above also appear to reflect an assessment by the court that, given the evidence that Powell was \u201cbacked up by [a half-dozen or more angry members of] his family,\u201d no reasonable person could have believed that appellant\u2019s spitting at Powell would protect appellant from harm.\nThus, the court\u2019s key factual finding and reasoning were as follows: First, the court found that appellant\u2019s motive in spitting on Powell was to effect \u201cstreet justice\u201d (i.e., retribution, revenge, or retaliation), and was not at all to defend herself.5 See generally 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 10.4 (c) (2d ed. 2003) (stating that a defendant acting in self-defense \u201cdoes not lose the defense because [s]he acts with some less admirable motive in addition to that of defending [her]self (emphasis added)). My colleagues observe that appellant \u201cnever indicated that she had the \u2018street justice\u2019 motive that the court imputed to her,\u201d ante, at 843 (majority opinion), but they stop short of concluding that the trial judge made a \u201cfactfinding error.\u201d Ante, at 844 (majority opinion).\nSecond, the court reasoned that appellant could not have reasonably thought that her spitting at Powell would extricate her from danger, i.e., cause Powell and his family to leave her alone.6 Yet, per this court\u2019s case law discussed below, that is what a defendant must have believed to avail herself of the defense of self-defense.\nC.\nIn numerous cases involving claims of self-defense, this court has said the following or its equivalent: \u201cOne who is defending against an assault charge, who is claiming self-defense, must have honestly and reasonably believed that he was in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm, and that his response was necessary to save himself.\u201d Travers, 124 A.3d at 639 (italics and underscoring added, internal quotation marks omitted; citing cases); see also, e,g., Higgenbottom v. United States, 923 A.2d 891, 900-01 (D.C. 2007) (approving an instruction that told the jury, inter alia, that \u201c[a] person may use *859an amount of force which, at the time of the incident, he reasonably believes is necessary to protect himself from imminent bodily harm\u201d (italics and underscoring added)); Potter v. United States, 534 A.2d 943, 946 (D.C. 1987) (\u201c[T]he jury could have found that appellant ... believefd], reasonably, that he had to throw a brick to fend off imminent bodily harm.\u201d (italics and underscoring added)); McPhaul v. United States, 452 A.2d 371, 373 &amp; 373 n.1 (D.C. 1982) (referring to \u201cour standardized jury instructions\u201d stating that \u201c[a] person may use an amount of [nondeadly] force which, at the time of the incident, he reasonably believed was necessary to protect himself from imminent bodily harm\u201d) (italics and underscoring added)); Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.501 (5th ed. 2016) (\u201cA person may use an amount of [non-deadly] force which, at the time of the incident, s/he actually and reasonably believes is necessary to protect himselfiherself from imminent bodily harm.\u201d).7\nThe foregoing citations demonstrate that what is firmly grounded in this court\u2019s ease law (as well as in logic) is that a person acts in self-defense only when her action is an effort to save or protect herself or to fend off harm. While my colleagues make much of what they call our jurisdiction\u2019s \u201ctwo-part test\u201d for self-defense,\u201d ante, at 844 (majority opinion), they fail to give due attention to the lead-in clause that dictates when the \u201ctwo-part test\u201d is applicable: the statement that there is a right to use a \u201creasonable amount of force\u201d (defined as applicable here by the non-deadly force paragraph of standardized jury instruction 9.501) \u201cin self-defense.\u201d8 That is why \u2014 and it is no mere tautology to say it \u2014 a claim that the defendant acted in self-defense may be disproved by evidence establishing or supporting an inference that the defendant did not act in an effort to avert, *860protect against, or save herself from danger. In other words, to prevail on a claim of self-defense, one must have acted \u201cin self-defense,\u201d i.e., acted in order to defend oneself; if the defendant acted purely for retribution, her action was not in self-defense.9 For that reason, I cannot agree with my colleagues that the defendant\u2019s \u201c[m]otive is not separately and additionally considered as a basis for disproving a claim of self-defense.\u201d Ante, at 839 (majority opinion).10 Nor can I agree that the trial court \u201cerred as a matter of law in conducting a separate inquiry\u201d into why appellant spit on Powell.11 Ante, at 838 (majority opinion). I do not mean to imply that such an inquiry will be necessary in every case. But, where (as here) the nature of the force the defendant used, or the defendant\u2019s testimony, or other factors fairly raise the issue of whether the defendant undertook force in an actual effort to protect herself, the inquiry is appropriate and may be necessary. And while it may be difficult to prove that \u201cthere was another motive guiding the defendant\u2019s action,\u201d ante, at 844, if the credited evidence proves that such other motive(s) alone, and not defense of self, was the defendant\u2019s reason for using force, the government will have met its burden to rebut the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense.\nIn this case \u2014 one in which the issue is whether the evidence permitted the court to find that appellant\u2019s use of force was solely retaliatory and not defensive \u2014 we may not rest on the truncated discussions *861of the law of self-defense found in some of our cases. See, e.g., Kittle v. United States, 65 A.3d 1144, 1158 (D.C. 2013) (\u201cTo invoke self-defense, there must be some evidence that: (1) appellant actually believed he was in imminent danger of bodily harm, and (2) he had reasonable grounds for that belief.\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (quoting Guillard v. United States, 596 A.2d 60, 63 (D.C. 1991))). The abbreviated articulation of the law of self-defense in Kittle and similar cases sufficed in those cases because the issue was simply whether the defendant believed he was in danger of imminent harm; the issue was not the motive for the use of force or even the proportionality of the force the defendant used. See Kittle, 65 A.3d at 1160 (\u201c[TJhere was no evidence, \u2018however weak,\u2019 to establish that appellant acted out of a fear of imminent harm.\u201d); Snell, 754 A.2d at 291 (\u201c[TJhere was evidence upon which a reasonable mind could find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant did not reasonably believe he was in imminent danger of bodily harm[.J\u201d).\nDiscussions of the self-defense standard in other cases add to the required inquiry whether, objectively, the force used by the defendant was reasonable or necessary. See, e.g., Higgenbottom, 923 A.2d at 900 (\u201c[TJhe central questions for the jury were (1) whether appellant [who was charged with striking his assailant with a pipe] actually and reasonably believed that he was in imminent danger of bodily harm, and (2) whether he used only reasonable force to repel the perceived attack.\u201d (italics added)). Formulations like this have been used when the focus of analysis was on whether the force the defendant used was excessive, not on whether the defendant used force that was so predictably ineffectual as not to qualify as force the defendant believed was necessary to protect herself. It appears that, until now, the latter issue simply has not arisen.\nThis court\u2019s articulations of the self-defense standard that are on point here establish that an act is not taken in self-defense unless it is intended to be (and could reasonably be thought to be) defensive.12 Our most pertinent explications of the standard dictate that, at least in some cases (and this is such a one), the necessary state-of-mind inquiry is not fully satisfied upon a conclusion that the defendant actually and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm, and that the self-defense analysis also is not complete upon a further conclusion that the amount of force used was not excessive. We must ask in addition (as the trial court in this case did) whether the appellant acted to protect herself (or whether, instead, she acted merely in retaliation, or only so as to \u201cgive as good as she got,\u201d ante at 843 (majority opinion), or solely to vindicate her sense that there was nothing she \u201cdid wrong\u201d to precipitate her assailant\u2019s attack).\nD.\nAll the foregoing said, I am not prepared simply to affirm appellant\u2019s conviction, because it appears that the trial court, in reasoning that appellant could not have reasonably believed that spitting on Powell might extricate her from danger, failed to take into account some of the rebuttal testimony by Officer Bradley. Officer Bradley testified on rebuttal that when he came upon the scene, he observed \u201ctwo families or two groups of family and friends yelling at each other on behalf of who[m]ever they were with.\u201d On appel*862lant\u2019s side, there was \u201cthe actual driver of the vehicle that was out there[,]\u201d who \u201cwas kind of the calming person trying to calm everybody down.\u201d There were also \u201ca few other people\u201d \u201cstanding in the general area,\u201d who \u201clooked like they were on the defendant\u2019s side. It \u201cseemed like\u201d these people on appellant\u2019s side were yelling in Powell\u2019s direction and that they \u201cweren\u2019t happy with\u201d Powell.\nIn explaining its verdict and the rejection of appellant\u2019s self-defense claim, the trial court did not mention Officer Bradley\u2019s testimony about the \u201cother people\u201d on appellant\u2019s side and thus did not explicitly credit or discredit the officer\u2019s testimony in this regard. As described above, the court emphasized that Powell\u2019s side \u201chad the numbers and they had the anger\u201d and reasoned that if Officer Bradley had not arrived just before appellant spit on Powell, Powell and the group of people on his side \u201cwould have made good on some of th[e] threats\u201d he had made to appellant and predictably would have \u201cbeat the S\u201d out of appellant (a forecast of violence that was not entirely speculative given appellant\u2019s testimony that sometime prior to this incident, Powell had \u201cjumped [appellant\u2019s] daughter\u201d). The court did not consider, however, whether, in a context where appellant had a \u201cfew other people\u201d on her side who were showing anger toward Powell, appellant could honestly and reasonably have believed that her act of spitting on Powell could serve as a deterrent to further violence by Powell or the people who were on his side.\nTo put it differently, even if appellant could not reasonably have thought that spitting would protect her in a situation where she was alone against Powell and his several family members, it is less dear that she could not reasonably have thought that spitting would protect her in the situation Officer Bradley described. And because all the evidence, and not just the defendant\u2019s testimony, is relevant to a finding about what the defendant who asserts a claim of self-defense could reasonably have believed (and to an inference about what she actually did believe),13 I believe the trial court\u2019s sole focus on appellant\u2019s testimony was insufficient.14 If credited, Officer Bradley\u2019s testimony about there being a \u201cfew other people\u201d on appellant\u2019s side could permit the inference that appellant acted in self-defense and would possibly change the court\u2019s calculus and impact its finding about whether the government met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant did not act in self-defense.15 I would vacate the *863conviction and remand the case for the trial court to reconsider its ruling after considering Officer Bradley\u2019s testimony in its entirety.16\nE.\nThe final observations I will make about the majority opinion are these: First, in focusing only on whether the defendant feared imminent bodily harm and whether she used excessive force, the majority opinion gives short shrift to the rule that, even as to non-deadly force, \u201c[t]he right of self-defense is a law of necessity, arising only when the necessity begins, and equally ends with the necessity.\u201d17 Second, the opinion does damage to the principle that none of us is entitled to \u201ctake redress into [jour own hands.\u201d18 Third, the majority\u2019s holding \u2014 that when self-defense is raised, the only proper inquiry with respect to a defendant\u2019s mental state is whether she subjectively and reasonably believed she was in imminent danger of bodily harm \u2014 is not a \u201creaffirm[ationj,\u201d as my colleagues assert, ante, at 849 (majority opinion), but a new pronouncement that takes advantage of the unusual facts of this case to abandon the principle that a valid claim of self-defense also requires a belief by the defendant that the force she used toas necessary to protect herself from imminent danger. I do not understand on what authority my colleagues believe they are free to renounce that principle. See M.A.P. v. Ryan, 285 A.2d 310, 312 (D.C. 1971) (\u201c[W]e have adopted the rule that no division of this court will overrule a prior decision of this court ... and that such result can only be accomplished by this court en banc.\u201d (footnote omitted)).\n\n. Travers v. United States, 124 A.3d 634, 639 (D.C. 2015) (quoting Edwards v. United States, 721 A.2d 938, 941 (D.C. 1998)).\n\n\n. The police officer who responded to the scene testified that appellant \u201cexplained to me clearly that she wouldn\u2019t just spit on him for no reason, that he spit on her first\n\n\n. I do not mean to imply that appellant bore the burden to prove that she acted in self-defense. I agree with my colleagues that it was \u201cthe government\u2019s burden to prove that she did not.\u201d Ante, at 843 n.13 (majority opinion). However, in determining whether that burden was met, the trial court was entitled to consider all the evidence, including appellant's own testimony \u2014 -and glaring omissions in that testimony \u2014 about why she spit on Powell.\n\n\n.Cf. Ewell v. Untied States, 72 A.3d 127, 128, 132 (D.C. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted) (describing the defendant's testimony that he struck the complainant in the face because, after throwing a cup of vodka at him and hitting him in the mouth, she \u201c 'was still coming\u2019 at him\u201d and he feared she had a knife and might pull it out and stab him; remanding the case to the trial court for reconsideration of defendant\u2019s self-defense claim, because the court had failed to account for the testimony \"tending to show that appellant acted to protect himself\u201d).\n\n\n. The court's focus was not on (as the concurrence puts it) \"how many elements of retributive anger\u201d it takes to defeat a claim of self-defense. Ante, at 853 (concurring opinion). The issue the court resolved was whether appellant\u2019s spitting on Powell was at all an effort to repel the attack that was threatened by Powell and the half-dozen members of his family who had approached appellant and were backing Powell up, or instead was merely appellant\u2019s effort to satisfy her (admittedly understandable) desire for retribution.\n\n\n. I suspect the trial judge would have had no trouble concluding that appellant had acted in self-defense if she had, for example, grabbed a stick and brandished it at Powell and his family members, or if she had pulled out a can of pepper spray and let them have it. Both of those actions are, at least arguably, more aggressive actions than spitting, and our public policy surely is not to encourage an escalation of aggressive conduct. But, as a policy matter reflected in the common law, we tolerate a victim\u2019s violent actions designed to stop a first aggressor\u2019s assaultive action, and do not tolerate a victim\u2019s violent actions that amount to nothing more than tit-for-tat acts of retaliation (and that risk elevating the first aggressor\u2019s threatening conduct). None of this is to say, of course, that spitting could never be a defensive act against a violent aggressor. As one court has explained, \"[i]t is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which spitting could conceivably constitute a use of force in self-defense \u2014 for example, where a person who has been placed in a chokehold spits at the aggressor to get him to loosen his grip,\u201d State v. Markou, No. 104,931, 255 P.3d 51, 2011 WL 2802408, *3, 2011 Kan. App. Unpub. LEXIS 505, at *6 (Kan, Ct. App. July 5, 2011).\n\n\n. Like Travers, many of our cases articulate essentially the same state-of-mind standard in the context of a defendant\u2019s use of deadly or potentially deadly force. See, e.g., Bassil v. United States, 147 A.3d 303, 306-07 (D.C. 2016) (explaining that the use of deadly force in self-defense is justified if the defendant \u201chonestly believed she was in imminent danger of serious bodily harm or death, and that she needed to use deadly force to save herself from that danger\" and if \"both those beliefs were objectively reasonable under the circumstances\u201d (italics and underscoring added)); Edwards v. United States, 721 A.2d 938, 941 (D.C. 1998) (\u201cThe defender must have believed that he was in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm, and that his response was necessary to save himself therefrom. These beliefs must not only have been honestly entertained, but also objectively reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances. It is clear that no less than a concurrence of these elements will suffice.\u201d (quoting United States v. Peterson, 483 F.2d 1222, 1229 (D.C. Cir), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1007, 94 S.Ct. 367, 38 L.Ed.2d 244 (1973) (footnote signals omitted, italics and underscoring added)); Harper v. United States, 608 A.2d 152, 155 (D.C. 1992) (\"The defender must have believed that he [or she] was in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm, and that his [or her] response was necessary to save himself [or herself] therefrom.\u201d (italics and underscoring added) (quoting Peterson); see also Freeman v. United States, 912 A.2d 1213, 1220 (D.C. 2006) (\"In order to raise a claim of self-defense, a defendant must show ... that his response was necessary to save himself from the danger.\u201d (italics added) (citing Brown v. United States, 619 A.2d 1180, 1182 (D.C. 1992) (citing cases))).\n\n\n. See Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.500 (5th ed. rev. 2016) (\u201cSelf Defense \u2014 General Considerations\u201d), providing in pertinent part that \u201d[e]very person has the right to use a reasonably amount of force in self-defense if (1) s/he actually believes s/he is in imminent danger of bodily harm and if (2) s/he has reasonable grounds for that belief.\u201d) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Snell v. United States, 754 A.2d 289, 290 (D.C. 2000) (\"Reasonable force may be used in self-defense if the actor reasonably believes that he or she is in imminent danger of bodily harm.\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\n\n. In my view, these are quite unremarkable propositions. My colleagues in the majority, too, recognize that what is \"entirely congruent with [a] claim of self-defense\u201d is action \"to repel the reasonably perceived danger[.]\u201d Ante, at 843 (majority opinion).\nTo be clear, I do not suggest that a person who uses force after being assaulted by an aggressor may not have a mixture of emotions, including emotions such as anger, hate, or indignation. Indeed, I expect that any person in that situation would be quite likely to have a mix of emotions. But to be entitled to the defense of self-defense, the person must have used force not purely as an expression of those emotions, but in an effort to repel the imminent danger of bodily harm. A person may use \"reasonable force to repel the perceived attack,\u201d Higgenbottom, 923 A.2d at 900 (emphasis added).\n\n\n. I agree with my colleagues that \"[t]he essence of the self-defense situation is a reasonable and bona fide belief of the imminence of ... bodily harm (emphasis added),\" Kinard v. United States, 96 F.2d 522, 526 (D.C. Cir. 1938), but the fact that the situation was one that would have justified efforts at self-defense does not mean that the defendant actually acted in self-defense. I agree that \"the threshold question for the fact finder is whether the government has disproved that the \u2018appellant actually and reasonably believed that [s]he was in imminent danger of bodily harm[,]\u2019 \u201d Higgenbottom, 923 A.2d at 900, but that threshold question is not the only relevant question.\n\n\n.The court\u2019s inquiry was consistent not only with our case law discussed supra, but also with a common-law principle that is over a century old. See, e.g., Lyons v. People, 137 Ill. 602, 27 N.E. 677, 682 (1891) (approving a self-defense instruction that told the jury, \u201cIt must appear that the circumstances were sufficient to excite the fears of a reasonable person, and that the party killing really acted under the influence of those fears and not in a spirit of revenge\u201d) (second set of italics added); Wortham v. State, 70 Ga. 336, 339 (1883) (explaining that for a homicide to be justifiable, \u201c[i]t must appear that the circumstances were such as to excite the fears of a reasonable man; and it must also further appear that he acted under those fears, and not in a spirit of revenge\u201d) (italics added). I also note that issues such as those we have had to consider in this case continue to be discussed in the academic literature. See, e.g., Stephanie Spies, Malice Aforethought and Self-Defense: Mutually Exclusive Mental States?, 91 N.Y.U. L. REV. 1027, 1046 (Oct. 2016) (discussing a category of cases finding retaliation/revenge and self-defense incompatible); see also Martin R. Gardner, The Mens Rea Enigma: Observations on the Role of Motive in the Criminal Law Past and Present, 1993 Utah L. Rev. 635 (1993).\n\n\n. I note tangentially that I take no issue with the statement that \u201c[i]n the heat of passion, a person may actually and reasonably believe something that seems unreasonable to a calm mind,\u201d Criminal Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia, No. 9.501.C.\n\n\n. Cf. Guillard, 596 A.2d at 63 (concluding that defendant was entitled to an instruction on self-defense, even though defendant himself denied ever striking the complaining witness, because other evidence, including testimony that the complainant was violent and aggressive and had thrown items at the defendant, \"fairly raised the issue of self-defense\u201d); Gray v. United States, 549 A.2d 347, 349 n.2 (D.C. 1988) (\"[A] defendant is entitled upon request to an instruction on any issue fairly raised by the evidence, regardless of whether it is consistent with the defense theory of the case or the defendant\u2019s testimony.\u201d).\n\n\n. This is not to agree with my colleagues\u2019 assertion that \"it is difficult if not impossible to accept that [appellant\u2019s] he-spit-on-me-first statement alone establishes, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [appellant was motivated solely by a desire to impose 'street justice,\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 843 (majority opinion). Rather, it is to acknowledge that sometimes a defendant may be less than fully articulate or less than candid about her reason for acting, and that the court must consider all the evidence, not just the defendant\u2019s testimony, before drawing an inference about why she acted as she did.\n\n\n.Contrary to the suggestion in the concurrence, I do not suggest that appellant\u2019s weak response signaled that the she did not actually and reasonably believe that she was in imminent danger of bodily harm (and the trial court, which expressly found that appellant believed that she was in imminent danger of *863bodily harm[,]\u201d) certainly did not suggest or infer that). To repeat, the point I make (and the point I believe the trial court recognized) is that the weakness of appellant\u2019s spitting response raises an issue of whether she actually and reasonably believed that spitting on Powell could help repel the danger in which she found herself, danger posed not only by Powell but also by the half-dozen or so members of his family were also approaching appellant and \"backing him up[.]\u201d Appellant testified that she \"didn't know what they\"\u2014 people \"known in the neighborhood to cause trouble\u201d- \u2014 w[ere] going to do\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n\n.The court\u2019s task on remand would include determining, in light of the officer's testimony about the presence of some of appellant\u2019s family members on the scene, whether appellant's spitting on Powell \"was too lame to evidence ... an attempt at self-protection,\u201d ante, at 850 (concurring opinion), because it was not a proportionate reaction to the \"very scary situation\u201d she perceived from the \"like eight people [on Powell\u2019s side]\u201d who \"ap-proacbfed] [her] at one time.\u201d\n\n\n.

Ouellette, 37 A.3d 921, 926 n.2 (Me. 2012) (\"Self-defense is defensive, not retaliatory: You may prevent an injury from being done by all proper means, but, when done, you cannot take redress into your own hands.\u201d (internal quotation mark omitted)).\n\n",
