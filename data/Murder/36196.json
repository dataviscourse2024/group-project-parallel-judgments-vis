            "opinion_text": "\nSikora, J.\nAt the conclusion of a five-day trial, a Superior Court jury convicted Anthony Chambers of involuntary manslaughter, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13. On appeal, Chambers argues that *625the trial judge abused her discretion by exclusion of evidence of the victim\u2019s prior violent conduct. He asserts that the exclusion was additionally prejudicial because defense counsel, relying on the trial judge\u2019s initial decision to allow the testimony, told the jury in his opening argument that they would hear such evidence. He contends also that the trial judge wrongly refused to instruct the jury on the defense of accident, and incorrectly barred opinion testimony about his nonviolent character. For the following reasons, we affirm.\nFactual background. The jury heard the following testimony. In early 2008, Chambers, James Ceurvels, and Edward Quiles, the victim, were living together in an apartment in the South End section of Boston. Ceurvels leased the apartment; he was allowing Chambers and Quiles to live there temporarily as his guests. All three men were drug users. Quiles and Chambers primarily used heroin, while Ceurvels preferred to smoke \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine.\nOn the night of February 9, 2008, all three men were at the apartment. Quiles had a large package of heroin. Quiles and Chambers injected themselves with heroin frequently throughout the night and into the early morning of February 10. Ceurvels was playing with his computer and intermittently smoking crack cocaine throughout the night. The three eventually went to sleep around 4 a.m.\nAt about 9 a.m., Ceurvels woke up when he heard Quiles yelling about a gram of heroin that he could not find. Ceurvels shouted at Quiles to be quiet and then went back to sleep. Ceurvels awoke again at about 1:15 p.m. when he heard Quiles screaming at Chambers to find his heroin. Chambers, in a calm voice, insisted that he did not have Quiles\u2019s heroin. Quiles and Chambers were searching throughout the apartment for the package of heroin. Ceurvels left the apartment to search for cigarettes. After Ceurvels left the apartment, Chambers and Quiles got into a fight.\nAccording to Chambers, Quiles woke him up and accused him of stealing the heroin.2 Quiles had a knife and was threatening to stab Chambers. Quiles then telephoned his heroin dealer and *626told him to bring a gun to the apartment so that Quiles could shoot Chambers. In response, Chambers twice called 911 and told the dispatcher that Quiles was threatening him. While Chambers was on the phone with the dispatcher, Quiles punched him in the head and attacked him with the knife. Chambers grabbed Quiles\u2019s hand with the knife in it and tried to push the knife back towards Quiles. During the struggle, Chambers overpowered Quiles and the inverted knife stabbed into Quiles. Quiles fell onto a bed and stopped moving. Chambers grabbed his jacket and went downstairs to the lobby.\nCeurvels was the only witness to the confrontation between Chambers and Quiles. According to his testimony, he returned to the apartment ten minutes after leaving in search of cigarettes. At that moment, he saw the two men throwing punches at one another. They fought until both fell onto Ceurvels\u2019s bed. Chambers was on top of Quiles, with Quiles facing down on the bed. Quiles shouted, \u201cYou stabbed me, you bastard. You stabbed me.\u201d Frightened by the altercation, Ceurvels ran downstairs and told the concierge to call 911.\nThe police arrived shortly after Ceurvels reached the lobby. At this point, Chambers was heading out of the building. The first responding officer walked into the lobby as Chambers was on his way out. The concierge told the officer to pursue Chambers. The officer followed Chambers out of the building and eventually stopped him on the sidewalk near the building.\nMore officers arrived on the scene. Three of them went up to the apartment. They found Quiles lying on the bed. He was unresponsive and had a large pool of blood under his head and neck. Emergency personnel arrived at the apartment shortly after the officers. They attempted to help Quiles but soon concluded that he was dead. Upon further investigation of the apartment, officers discovered the metal blade of a steak knife on the floor next to the bed where Quiles had died.\nThe medical examiner conducted an autopsy. She testified that Quiles had a significant stab wound to the upper left side of his body, where the chest meets the neck. This stab wound went from the front to the back of the body and had a downward *627path, slightly from left to right. This wound had severed the carotid and subclavian arteries. It had penetrated the chest cavity and ended in the back portion of the left chest cavity between the second and third ribs. Quiles had received a second smaller wound to the front right side of his neck, as well as two small bruises on his face. The medical examiner opined that the knife blade found next to the bed was consistent with an instrument capable of causing the stab wounds. She concluded that Quiles\u2019s death had resulted from the stab wound that severed the carotid and subclavian arteries.\nThe Commonwealth charged Chambers with manslaughter. Before trial, defense counsel notified the prosecution that he intended to introduce evidence of Quiles\u2019s prior violent conduct to show that Quiles was the first aggressor. Defense counsel planned to call a witness who would testify that, about twenty-one months earlier in another section of Boston, Quiles, with five or six other men, had assaulted him in his car and taken his wallet and telephone. The prosecution filed a motion in limine to exclude this evidence. The trial judge initially denied the motion. In reliance on the ruling, defense counsel told the jury in his opening statement that a witness would testify about an unrelated incident in which Quiles had violently attacked him. However, later in the trial, the judge reversed her decision and excluded the witness. She reasoned that testimony of Quiles\u2019s prior violent conduct was no longer admissible because the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence had already established that Quiles was the first aggressor. Defense counsel asked the judge to explain to the jury that the promised witness would not appear because the evidence now established Quiles as the first aggressor. Counsel asked the judge also to instruct the jury that they must \u201caccept as fact that the decedent was the first aggressor.\u201d The judge denied counsel\u2019s requests for these instructions.\nDiscussion. 1. Admissibility of Adjutant evidence. Criminal defendants who assert self-defense may seek \u201cto admit evidence of specific acts of prior violent conduct that the victim is reasonably alleged to have initiated\u201d if \u201cthe identity of the first aggressor is in dispute.\u201d Commonwealth v. Adjutant, 443 Mass. 649, 664 (2005) (Adjutant evidence). \u201cIt is for the trial judge to evaluate the proffered evidence\u2019s probative value and admit so *628much of that evidence as is noncumulative and relevant to the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim.\u201d Id. at 663. \u201c[Decisions of trial judges to admit or exclude such evidence . . . will be upheld unless we find an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. at 663 n.18. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7\u00a7 404(a)(2)(B), 405 (2011).\nThe trial judge did not abuse her discretion in the present case. The evidence overwhelmingly indicated that Quiles was the first aggressor. Ceurvels testified that Quiles was yelling at Chambers and demanding that he find Quiles\u2019s heroin. Ceurvels described Quiles as \u201cagitated\u201d and Chambers as \u201cpretty mild.\u201d Just prior to the fight between Chambers and Quiles, Chambers called 911 and reported that Quiles was threatening to kill him. In his statement to the police, Chambers told the interrogating detectives that Quiles had asked his heroin dealer to bring him a gun so that he could kill Chambers. According to Chambers, Quiles punched him in the head while he was on the telephone with the 911 dispatcher, and Quiles then pulled out a knife and tried to stab him. The recording of the 911 call partially corroborates this version of events; it contains sounds indicating that Quiles had attacked Chambers during the call.\nAmid this evidence, testimony of Quiles\u2019s prior violent conduct would have been cumulative and of only marginal value. See Commonwealth v. Gaynor, 73 Mass. App. Ct. 71, 75 (2008) (holding that trial judge\u2019s exclusion of Adjutant evidence was proper because victim had admitted that he was first aggressor). Further, such testimony could have prejudiced the jurors against Quiles and confused them as to the ultimate issues in the case. See Adjutant, supra at 662-663 (acknowledging that introduction of victim\u2019s prior instances of violent conduct may result in confusion and prejudice toward victim, and requiring judges to weigh these factors against probative value of evidence). The trial judge did not abuse her discretion. Her assessment that the potential of the testimony for prejudice or confusion outweighed its additional probative value was reasonable.3\n*6292. Counsel\u2019s inability to call the witness referenced in opening statement. Chambers alternatively argues that, even if the trial judge\u2019s exclusion of the Adjutant evidence were proper, the decision prejudiced his defense because defense counsel, in his opening statement, had promised it to the jury. In counsel\u2019s opening, he mentioned only briefly that he would be calling a witness to testify to Quiles\u2019s prior violent conduct.4 He focused his opening on the evidence related to the fight between Quiles and Chambers. See United States vs. Patwardhan, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. ED CR 08-00172 (C.D. Cal. July 18, 2009) (no prejudice resulted from counsel\u2019s inability to call promised witness because reference to witness\u2019s anticipated testimony comprised only small part of counsel\u2019s opening statement), aff\u2019d, U.S. Ct. App., No. 09-50487 (9th Cir. Mar. 18, 2011). Contrast United States v. Gonzalez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d 9, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1997) (reversing defendant\u2019s conviction where defense counsel in his opening statement promised \u201ccritical\u201d testimony from expert witness but did not produce witness by reason of trial judge\u2019s changed ruling). The expanse of the trial is pertinent. Here it lasted five days, so that counsel\u2019s opening statement was not fresh in the jury\u2019s mind when they began deliberations. See Yeboah-Sefah v. Ficco, 556 F.3d 53, 78 (1st Cir.), cert, denied, 130 S. Ct. 639 (2009) (no prejudice resulted from counsel\u2019s failure to call promised witness because opening statement was made six days before end of trial). Contrast Anderson v. Butler, 858 F.2d 16, 17 (1st Cir. 1988) (finding prejudice where jury began deliberations day after counsel promised to present expert testimony that he never produced).\nIn addition, the trial judge explained to the jury that opening statements were not evidence and instructed them not to \u201cspeculate on why certain witnesses were called and others were not.\u201d See Patwardhan, supra (instructions that opening statements were not evidence alleviated any prejudice resulting from counsel\u2019s *630inability to follow through on promise to call expert witness). In light of these factors, we cannot conclude that counsel\u2019s inability to call this witness prejudiced Chambers\u2019s defense.\nFinally, the trial judge would have risked invasion of the fact-finding province of the jury if she had used the defendant\u2019s proposed curative instruction because it required the jury to find that Quiles was the first aggressor. See Commonwealth v. Cote, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 365, 369 (1977) (\u201cIt is . . . improper for a judge to . . . direct what inferences the jury should draw from certain evidence\u201d).\n3. Accident instruction. A defendant is entitled to an instruction on accident if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, \u201cfairly raises the possibility of accident.\u201d Commonwealth v. Power-Koch, 69 Mass. App. Ct. 735, 737 (2007), quoting from Commonwealth v. Jewett, 442 Mass. 356, 370 (2004). An accident functions as a defense to involuntary manslaughter if it is an \u201cunintentional event occurring through inadvertence, mistake, or negligence.\u201d Commonwealth v. Figueroa, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 641, 650 (2002). In contrast, an accident, when used as \u201ca label for the unintended consequences of a defendant\u2019s act,\u201d is not a defense to involuntary manslaughter. Id. at 648.\nHere, no evidence indicated that Chambers\u2019s actions were unintentional. He made numerous statements to the police indicating that he did not intend to stab the victim mortally. However, for assessment of an accident defense to involuntary manslaughter, the critical focus centers on the intent to commit the act, not the intent to bring about the consequences of the act. Throughout Chambers\u2019s description of the fight with the victim, he never claimed to have pushed the knife unintentionally back toward Quiles. In the absence of such unintentional conduct, Chambers was not entitled to an accident instruction. Contrast Power-Koch, supra at 738 (holding that defendant was entitled to accident instruction where he claimed that he had unintentionally pulled trigger on gun, and thereby shot his friend). Finally, the presence of evidence of intentional conduct also militated against an accident instruction. The autopsy showed two knife wounds, one to each side of the victim\u2019s neck.\n4. Admissibility of opinion testimony about Chambers\u2019s *631character. \u201cIn a criminal proceeding, the accused may offer evidence of a pertinent trait in reputation form only . . . .\u201d Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 404(a)(1). See Commonwealth v. Walker, 442 Mass. 185, 198 (2004) (\u201c[W]hile evidence of a defendant\u2019s general reputation in his community or at his workplace is admissible, evidence in the form of private opinions is not\u201d). If the trial judge had allowed Ceurvels to testify about Chambers\u2019s character, he would have testified about his own personal opinion of Chambers\u2019s character, not about Chambers\u2019s reputation in the general community. This form of character evidence is clearly inadmissible. The trial judge correctly excluded it.\n5. Dissenter\u2019s concerns. We have weighed carefully the reasoning of our dissenting colleague: that the judge abused her discretion by ultimate exclusion of the defendant\u2019s proposed Adjutant witness; and that the prosecutor unfairly exploited that exclusion in closing argument and thereby infected the trial with reversible error. For the following reasons, we cannot agree.\nSeveral important preliminary points are undisputed. First, the prosecutor made no reference whatsoever to the excluded witness throughout his closing. Second, the judge correctly instructed the jury not to speculate about the absence of any originally proposed witness. We assume that a jury obey a judge\u2019s instruction. Commonwealth v. Watkins, 425 Mass. 830, 840 (1997). Commonwealth v. Degro, 432 Mass. 319, 328 (2000). That assumption operates realistically in the present circumstances in which defense counsel\u2019s reference to such a witness in an opening statement was brief and general and in which substantial trial time and abundant direct evidence of the specific circumstances of the homicide superseded the reference.\nMore importantly, the portrayal of the prosecutor\u2019s closing as a \u201cblistering\u201d exploitation of the Adjutant ruling, post at 636, does not stand up under inspection. Defense counsel emphasized at the beginning of his closing argument that \u201cthe core of this case is self-defense.\u201d After a vigorous interpretation of the evidence favorable to the defendant, he concluded that the fatal episode \u201csadly is what happens, and clearly that\u2019s not a crime, it\u2019s self-defense.\u201d\nThe prosecutor had naturally anticipated that argument. He began his closing with the acknowledgment that the Com*632monwealth carried the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of at least one of three negatives: (1) that the defendant Chambers had not reasonably feared death or serious bodily injury from the victim Quiles; (2) that the defendant had not exhausted the alternatives to deadly force, such as retreat; or (3) that he had not used merely the force necessary in the circumstances. That accurate statement of the law specifically anticipated the judge\u2019s instructions.5 ****6 The prosecutor proceeded to argue the evidence under each of those requirements. As to the first, he contended that the Commonwealth had disproved \u201cany claim of the level of fear on [the defendant\u2019s] part that would justify the use of deadly force against another human being.\u201d The use of the words \u201clevel of fear\u201d is significant and undisputed by the dissenting opinion. At no point in closing argument did the prosecutor deviate from the black-letter doctrine of the elements of self-defense and of the imposition of the burden of disproof upon the Commonwealth. The governing law, then, fully allowed the prosecutor to argue from the evidence that Quiles\u2019s aggression did not reach the level of intimidation necessary to justify his mortal stabbing by the defendant as either a matter of reasonably experienced fear (first element of self-defense) or proportionate force (third element). At no point in the closing did the prosecutor refer to the defendant as the first aggressor. His main contention was that the defendant\u2019s station house description of Quiles as a lethal intimidator was not credible.\nYet the dissenting opinion, post at 636, condemns the argument for \u201cclearly insinuating that the defendant was, indeed, the initial aggressor.\u201d6 However the more specific and determinative issue is which combatant first aggressed with the deadly *633instrument of the knife. Any insinuation upon that point inhered in the evidence and in the controlling doctrine, and not in any fault of the judge or the prosecutor. The jury heard evidence from which they could have attributed first use of the knife to either man but final excessive use of the knife only to the defendant.\nCeurvels testified that Quiles blamed the defendant for the disappearance of his (Quiles\u2019s) heroin. In his recorded station house interrogation, the defendant claimed that Quiles had approached him with the knife. The jury also heard evidence undermining the defendant\u2019s credibility and placing the knife exclusively in the defendant\u2019s hands. Ceurvels, a friend of the defendant for almost five years, testified that he saw the defendant atop Quiles, who was laying face down, and heard Quiles shout that the defendant had stabbed him. At the station house, the defendant stated that he had stabbed Quiles once in the midsection. However, the autopsy established two neck wounds, one catastrophic and fatal.\nIn these circumstances, the judge properly left the issue of first aggressor and ultimate wrongdoer in its proper location: the deliberation of the jury upon the totality of the evidence.7 *7 The evidence permitted the jury to find Quiles as an initiator of threat or combat, but not so intimidating an aggressor (not one creating a \u201clevel of fear\u201d) as to justify the fatal stabbing by Chambers, especially if they disbelieved the defendant\u2019s station house assertion that Quiles had attacked him with a knife. In short, the jury could have found that the Commonwealth had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant lacked the degree of reasonable fear contemplated by the first element of *634self-defense or that he had acted with force in excess of the degree allowed by the third element.8\nFinally, we bear in mind that the Adjutant criterion is an evidentiary license entrusted to the sound discretion of trial judges.9 We must measure the effect of an Adjutant ruling realistically amid the perspective of the entire evidence submitted at trial. In this instance we assess the consequence of the exclusion of one incident separated from the event confronting the jury by time (twenty-one months), place (another section of the city), personnel (five or six joint venturers), and circumstances (the absence of drug ingestion and weapons). The case at trial presented detailed evidence of eighteen hours of close-quartered and drug-soaked friction culminating in a homicide, including eyewitness testimony of a fatal struggle and forensic evidence of the cause of death. In the circumstances, we do not believe that the Adjutant ruling can serve as an archimedean lever long enough and strong enough to upend a conviction grounded in firm and direct evidence.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\n\nChambers did not testify at trial. However, after giving Miranda warnings, the police interrogated him at the station; the prosecution played a recording *626of the interrogation for the jury. The prosecution also provided the jury with a transcript of the interrogation to assist them as they listened to the recording.\n\n\nA party claiming \u201can abuse of . . . discretion assumes a heavy burden . . . [and must establish] that no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken the view expressed by him.\u201d Commonwealth v. Bys, 370 Mass. 350, 361 (1976) (quotations and citation omitted). Commonwealth v. Medeiros, 395 Mass. 336, 351 (1985) (same language).\n\n\nDefense counsel\u2019s reference was as follows.\n\u201cBut you are going to hear evidence that [Quiles] was capable of unprovoked violence. And you are going to hear that from someone who otherwise has absolutely nothing to do with this case. The anti-Chambers, the anti-Quiles, the nice young kid who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and was victimized by the deceased in this case. And he\u2019ll come in here . . . and he\u2019ll tell you about it.\u201d\n\n\nSee, e.g., Commonwealth v. Roberts, 433 Mass. 45, 56 (2000), and cases cited (three elements); Commonwealth v. Williams, 450 Mass. 879, 885 n.3 (2008) (Commonwealth\u2019s burden of disproof).\nThe judge covered the three elements and the concept of proving a negative or disproof. She did not involve the concept of \u201cfirst aggressor.\u201d At the close of the instruction, neither side requested an additional \u201cfirst aggressor\u201d elaboration.\n\n\nTo the same effect, it criticizes the judge\u2019s denial of an instruction that the defendant was not the first aggressor because it \u201cpermitted the Commonwealth to spend its entire summation telling the jury that the victim engaged in no aggression for the defendant to fear.\u201d Post at 638. A more calibrated description *633would be that the prosecutor urged the jury to disbelieve the defendant\u2019s account of a degree of reasonable fear justifying the use of deadly force.\n\n\nA strong connotation of the dissenting opinion is that, once the judge excluded the Adjutant witness, she owed the defendant a jury instruction effectively establishing the victim as the first aggressor. If that determination of fact \u201cwent directly to the heart of the case\u2019s central dispute\u201d as the dissent asserts, post at 637, quoting from Adjutant, 443 Mass, at 666, it belonged to the jury as a finding, and not to the judge as a ruling. Such an instruction would constitute an exceptional invasion of the jury box, especially if first aggressor status did not resolve the disputed possession of a knife or the use of excessive defensive force. The judge prudently declined to convert from the role of evidentiary gate keeper to the finder of material fact.\n\n\nThe forensic evidence of the neck wounds powerfully supported a finding of excessive force.\n\n\nThe Adjutant rule is relatively new. As the present appeal illustrates, it can present challenging questions of degree to the judge before and during trial. Proposed evidence of a victim\u2019s prior violent conduct may involve incidents remote and disparate from the criminal acts charged at trial. Perhaps one lesson from this case is that, in close calls requiring further development of the evidence, the judge might prohibit defense counsel from promising the appearance of an Adjutant witness to the jury as part of an opening statement.\n\n",

            "opinion_text": "\nMcHugh, J.\n(dissenting in part). I respectfully dissent because I cannot agree with the majority that, as the case unfolded, the excluded testimony of the victim\u2019s prior violent conduct was either cumulative or marginal.\nAfter a voir dire hearing during which she heard testimony from the defendant\u2019s proposed witness, the judge, without objection from the Commonwealth, made a pretrial ruling that evidence of the victim\u2019s earlier assault and robbery of the defendant\u2019s proposed witness was admissible on the first aggressor issue. *635See Commonwealth v. Adjutant, 443 Mass. 649, 664 (2005) (specific acts of victim\u2019s prior violent conduct may be admitted to support defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense). When the trial began, the Commonwealth\u2019s opening statement strongly suggested that the victim was not the first aggressor. In response, and relying on the pretrial ruling, defense counsel\u2019s opening promised the jury that a disinterested witness would \u201ccome in here on probably Monday, maybe Tuesday, depending upon the pace of things,\u201d to show the jurors that the victim was \u201ccapable of unprovoked violence\u201d and hence likely the first aggressor. Far from a fleeting reference, defense counsel made the promise toward the end of his opening as the capstone of his assertions that the jurors would hear evidence warranting an acquittal.1\nOn the fourth day of trial, however, the judge entered an order stating that \u201cupon reconsideration sua sponte [the] court excludes [the] so-called \u2018Adjutant evidence\u2019 because the identity of the first aggressor is not a live issue at trial. There is no evidence the defendant was the first aggressor.\u201d2 As a result, the witness that the defense had promised was barred from testifying.\nWith the record in that state, the defendant requested an instruction to the effect that the defendant was not the first aggressor and that the testimony he had promised in the opening was irrelevant as a matter of law.3 The judge denied the request, stating, in effect, that there was no evidence one way or the *636other on the first aggressor issue, though there was testimony from the defendant that he had seen the victim \u201crough up\u201d other people. With the door thus opened, the Commonwealth in summation launched into a blistering attack on the defendant\u2019s claim that he inflicted the fatal wound in response to the victim\u2019s assault, clearly insinuating that the defendant was, indeed, the initial aggressor.\nThough, as the majority correctly states, the judge has the discretion to weigh the probative value of so-called Adjutant evidence against its prejudicial effect, Adjutant, supra at 663-664, the record does not reveal that is what ultimately happened here. To be sure, in first deciding to allow testimony by the victim of the assault and robbery, the judge impliedly ruled that the balance between probative value and prejudicial impact tipped in favor of admitting the evidence. But when the judge altered her ruling in the middle of the trial, she did so not on the ground that the evidence was insufficiently probative but on the ground either that the defendant had so clearly won the first aggressor contest that he did not need the evidence and would gain nothing from its admission or on the ground that the Commonwealth had not introduced any evidence suggesting that the defendant was the first aggressor.4\n*637From opening through closing, however, an essential component of the Commonwealth\u2019s case was its claim that the victim never engaged in any acts that put the defendant in fear for his safety. The judge barred the only outside evidence the defendant had to bolster his claim that the victim was the first aggressor. That left the defendant with testimony about his own observations, testimony the Commonwealth dispatched by arguing to the jury that it \u201cis only useful to you if you can trust it. And this information by the defendant where, on second thought, . . . he has seen [the victim] eff people up, that\u2019s not worth anything to you because you can\u2019t trust him.\u201d\nAdjutant, 443 Mass, at 664, holds that \u201cwhere the identity of the first aggressor is in dispute and the victim has a history of violence ... the trial judge has the discretion to admit evidence of specific acts of prior violent conduct that the victim is reasonably alleged to have initiated, to support the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense.\u201d The evidence excluded here, like that proffered in Adjutant, \u201cwent directly to the heart of the case\u2019s central dispute \u2014\u2022 whether [the victim] was the initial aggressor in his final altercation with [the defendant].\u201d Id. at 666. The posture of the case contrasts starkly with Commonwealth v. Gaynor, relied on by the majority, where the victim conceded his role as the first aggressor. Commonwealth v. Gaynor, 73 Mass. App. Ct. 71, 75 (2008) (excluding Adjutant evidence). That concession eliminated any prejudice from the exclusion of Adjutant evidence because \u201cthe identity of the first aggressor was irrelevant to the jury\u2019s consideration of the case as submitted to them by the judge.\u201d Id. at 76. Moreover, the judge in *638Gaynor consistently denied the defendant\u2019s motion for Adjutant evidence, rather than initially allowing it. See id. at 75.\nHere, the judge first allowed the evidence, then excluded it after counsel promised to provide it, then declined the defendant\u2019s request for an instruction that he was not the first aggressor and, finally, permitted the Commonwealth to spend its entire summation telling the jury that the victim engaged in no aggression for the defendant to fear. In that context, midtrial exclusion of the evidence created a risk of unfair prejudice that the Commonwealth exploited to full effect.\nI would reverse.\n\nContrast Yeboah-Sefah v. Ficco, 556 F.3d 53, 76, 78 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 639 (2009) (general promise that \u201cboth \u2018[psychologists and psychiatrists\u2019 would testify\u201d was not \u201cspecific, significant and dramatic promise\u201d); United States vs. Patwardhan, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. ED CR 08-00172 (C.D. Cal. July 18, 2009) (prejudice from opening statement was limited because defense counsel\u2019s reference to evidence was \u201cvery brief mention amongst dozens of other subjects,\u201d taking up only eleven lines of twenty-three page transcribed opening, and Adjutant evidence was provisionally admitted subject to foundation that counsel failed to provide), aff\u2019d, U.S. Ct. App., No. 09-50487 (9th Cir. Mar. 18, 2011).\n\n\nThe judge\u2019s reversal was made in response to the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for an Adjutant instruction, which is designed to protect the Commonwealth, not the defendant, see Commonwealth v. Sommer, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908 (2010), and for limitations on \u2014 but not exclusion of \u2014 the Adjutant testimony.\n\n\nThe requested instruction stated as follows:\n\u201cYou recall that in his opening [defense counsel] indicated that he would produce a witness to testify about certain prior conduct of the *636victim .... That testimony would have been admissible if there was a question in the case of who was the first aggressor. It is a trial lawyer\u2019s job to consider all possibilities and therefore, if the question of who was the first aggressor was a live issue I would have allowed [defense counsel] to produce that witness.\n\u201cHowever, based upon the evidence actually submitted I have ruled that there is no question that the victim was the first aggressor. There is no evidence that the defendant was the first aggressor, and [you] must accept as fact that the decedent was the first aggressor.\n\u201cTherefore, I have ruled as well that the calling of such a witness is unnecessary.\u201d\n\n\nThe judge explained the basis for her ruling in the course of the following colloquy:\nThe court: \u201cWell, let me ask you this. Under pre-Adjutant and maybe, [defense counsel], you would be the better one to answer this. Is there any indication in the evidence that you have, or intend to offer, that the defendant knew of the [assault and robbery] incident *637[about which the defendant\u2019s witness would testify] and what it would produce?\u201d\nDefense counsel: \u201cHe knew of that particular incident? No way.\u201d\nThe court: \u201cAll right. So under pxe-Adjutant that would be the condition precedent.\u201d\nDefense counsel: \u201cCorrect.\u201d\nThe court: \u201cAnd given the condition precedent to Adjutant-type evidence not being present, which is the basis of my ruling, then I find no evidence of the deceased not being the first aggressor, if you will.\u201d\n\n",
