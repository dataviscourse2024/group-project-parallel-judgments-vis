Short, appellant.\n                                                    ___ N.W.2d ___\n\n                                        Filed September 17, 2021.   No. S-19-415.\n\n                 1. Judgments: Speedy Trial: Appeal and Error. Generally, a trial court\u2019s\n                    determination as to whether charges should be dismissed on speedy trial\n                    grounds is a factual question which will be affirmed on appeal unless\n                    clearly erroneous.\n                 2. Pretrial Procedure: Appeal and Error. Trial courts have broad dis-\n                    cretion with respect to sanctions involving discovery procedures, and\n                    their rulings thereon will not be reversed in the absence of an abuse\n                    of discretion.\n                 3. Constitutional Law: Search and Seizure: Motions to Suppress:\n                    Appeal and Error. In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to sup-\n                    press evidence based on a claimed violation of the Fourth Amendment,\n                    an appellate court applies a two-part standard of review. Regarding\n                    historical facts, an appellate court reviews the trial court\u2019s findings for\n                    clear error, but whether those facts trigger or violate Fourth Amendment\n                    protections is a question of law that an appellate court reviews indepen-\n                    dently of the trial court\u2019s determination.\n                 4. Search Warrants: Affidavits: Probable Cause: Appeal and Error.\n                    An appellate court reviews the trial court\u2019s findings as to whether the\n                    affidavit supporting the warrant contained falsehoods or omissions and\n                    whether those were made intentionally or with reckless disregard for the\n                    truth for clear error. An appellate court reviews de novo the determina-\n                    tion that any alleged falsehoods or omissions were not necessary to the\n                    probable cause finding.\n                 5. ____: ____: ____: ____. After-the-fact scrutiny by courts of the suf-\n                    ficiency of an affidavit should not take the form of de novo review.\n                    Instead, a judge\u2019s determination of probable cause to issue a search war-\n                    rant should be paid great deference by reviewing courts.\n                 6. Search and Seizure. Application of the good faith exception to the\n                    exclusionary rule is a question of law.\n\f                                     - 82 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     310 Nebraska Reports\n                              STATE v. SHORT\n                              Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\n 7. Constitutional Law: Speedy Trial. The right to a speedy trial is unique\n    from other rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution for the protection\n    of the accused because there is a societal interest in providing a speedy\n    trial, which exists separate from, and at times in opposition to, the inter-\n    ests of the accused.\n 8. Speedy Trial: Witnesses. The deprivation of the right to a speedy trial\n    may work to the accused\u2019s advantage when adverse witnesses become\n    unavailable or their memories fade over time.\n 9. Speedy Trial: Presumptions. Until there is some delay that is presump-\n    tively prejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry into the other factors\n    that go into the balance in determining if the right to a speedy trial has\n    been violated.\n10. Constitutional Law: Speedy Trial. Counsel cannot seek and obtain\n    continuances to give the defense more time to be ready for trial because\n    of the government\u2019s dilatory behavior and then, after the fact, reverse\n    course and claim that the indictment should be dismissed on the ground\n    that the defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial under the U.S. Constitution\n    has been infringed because of that behavior.\n11. Speedy Trial. A defendant cannot claim the loss of the fundamental\n    right to a speedy trial through the inherent delays of a process the\n    defendant has called upon\u2014even if that process was to vindicate another\n    fundamental right.\n12. Constitutional Law: Speedy Trial: New Trial: Appeal and Error.\n    Absent extraordinary circumstances, an appellate court does not con-\n    sider the entire period of time beginning with the original charge or\n    arrest in computing the length of the delay when there has been a mis-\n    trial. Instead, the constitutional speedy trial analysis focuses only on the\n    period after the mandate for a new trial and the subsequent retrial.\n13. Speedy Trial. Only misconduct involving deliberate delay tactics\n    designed to circumvent the right to a speedy trial is an extraordinary\n    circumstance warranting consideration of the period of delay before\n    a mistrial.\n14. Constitutional Law: Speedy Trial: Presumptions. A delay of a year or\n    more is the benchmark commonly recognized as presumptively prejudi-\n    cial in a constitutional speedy trial analysis.\n15. Speedy Trial: Verdicts: Sentences. The more complex and serious the\n    crime, the longer a delay might be tolerated, because society also has\n    an interest in ensuring that longer sentences are rendered upon the most\n    exact verdicts possible.\n16. Constitutional Law: Prosecuting Attorneys: Evidence. A defendant\n    has a constitutionally protected privilege to request and obtain from the\n    prosecution evidence that is either material to the guilt of the defendant\n    or relevant to the punishment to be imposed.\n\f                                    - 83 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                    310 Nebraska Reports\n                             STATE v. SHORT\n                             Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\n17. Police Officers and Sheriffs: Prosecuting Attorneys: Evidence.\n    Police conduct resulting in suppression of favorable material evidence\n    is imputed to the prosecution.\n18. Due Process: Motions for Continuance: Evidence. There is no due\n    process violation when the defendant has had an opportunity to request a\n    continuance to adequately prepare the defense in light of evidence that,\n    while disclosed late, is ultimately disclosed before the end of trial.\n19. Constitutional Law: Speedy Trial. The Fifth Amendment has only a\n    limited role to play in protecting against oppressive delay in the crimi-\n    nal context.\n20. Criminal Law: Pretrial Procedure. Discovery in a criminal case is\n    generally controlled by either a statute or a court rule.\n21. Criminal Law: Courts. When a court sanctions the government in a\n    criminal case for its failure to obey court orders, it must use the least\n    severe sanction that will adequately punish the government and secure\n    future compliance.\n22. Pretrial Procedure: Dismissal and Nonsuit. Dismissal as a sanction\n    for a discovery violation is only appropriate where less drastic alterna-\n    tives are not available.\n23. Judgments: Words and Phrases. An abuse of discretion occurs when a\n    trial court\u2019s decision is based upon reasons that are untenable or unrea-\n    sonable or if its action is clearly against justice or conscience, reason,\n    and evidence.\n24. Search Warrants: Affidavits: Probable Cause. To determine whether\n    a warrant was issued upon probable cause, a court generally limits its\n    review to the four corners of the affidavit.\n25. Affidavits: Evidence. An exception to the limitation of the court\u2019s\n    review to the four corners of the affidavit is where the defendant makes\n    a preliminary proffer of falsity warranting an evidentiary hearing.\n26. Affidavits: Probable Cause: Hearsay. Probable cause may be founded\n    upon hearsay as well as upon information within the affiant\u2019s own\n    knowledge that sometimes must be garnered hastily.\n27. Search Warrants: Affidavits: Probable Cause: Police Officers and\n    Sheriffs: Presumptions: Proof. While there is a presumption of valid-\n    ity with respect to the affidavit supporting the search warrant, that pre-\n    sumption may be overcome and a search warrant may be invalidated if\n    the defendant proves the affiant officer knowingly and intentionally, or\n    with reckless disregard for the truth, included in the affidavit false or\n    misleading statements that were necessary, or material, to establishing\n    probable cause.\n28. Search Warrants: Affidavits: Probable Cause. Omissions in an affida-\n    vit used to obtain a search warrant are considered to be misleading when\n    the facts contained in the omitted material tend to weaken or damage\n\f                                     - 84 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     310 Nebraska Reports\n                               STATE v. SHORT\n                               Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\n      the inferences which can logically be drawn from the facts as stated in\n      the affidavit.\n29.   Search Warrants: Probable Cause: Police Officers and Sheriffs:\n      Evidence: Proof. If the defendant successfully proves, by a prepon-\n      derance of the evidence, that the police knowingly and intentionally,\n      or with reckless disregard for the truth, included a false or misleading\n      statement or omitted information material to a probable cause finding,\n      then the court examines whether the evidence obtained from the warrant\n      and search was fruit of the poisonous tree.\n30.   Search and Seizure: Affidavits. Mere negligence in preparing the affi-\n      davit will not lead to suppression, as the purpose of the exclusionary\n      rule is to deter misconduct.\n31.   Search Warrants: Affidavits: Probable Cause: Police Officers and\n      Sheriffs. Observations by fellow officers engaged in a common inves-\n      tigation are a reliable basis for a warrant, and probable cause is to be\n      evaluated by the collective information of the police as reflected in the\n      affidavit and is not limited to the firsthand knowledge of the officer who\n      executes the affidavit.\n32.   Search Warrants: Probable Cause: Words and Phrases. Probable\n      cause sufficient to justify issuance of a search warrant means a fair\n      probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in the\n      item to be searched.\n33.   Constitutional Law: Search Warrants: Probable Cause. The Fourth\n      Amendment\u2019s express requirement of particularity for a search warrant\n      is closely related to its express requirement of probable cause.\n34.   Search Warrants: Affidavits: Probable Cause. A warrant affidavit\n      must always set forth particular facts and circumstances underlying the\n      existence of probable cause, so as to allow the magistrate to make an\n      independent evaluation of probable cause.\n35.   Criminal Law: Search and Seizure: Evidence. The nexus between the\n      alleged crimes and the article to be searched does not need to be based\n      on direct observation; it can be found in the type of crime, the nature\n      of the evidence sought, and the normal inferences as to where such evi-\n      dence may be found.\n36.   Probable Cause: Police Officers and Sheriffs. Probable cause may\n      be based on commonsense conclusions about human behavior, and due\n      weight should be given to inferences by law enforcement officers based\n      on their experience and specialized training.\n37.   Affidavits: Police Officers and Sheriffs. Wholly conclusory state-\n      ments by a law enforcement officer affiant that the affiant has reliable\n      information and reason to believe evidence of a crime will be found in a\n      particular place are insufficient.\n\f                                    - 85 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                    310 Nebraska Reports\n                              STATE v. SHORT\n                              Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\n38. Constitutional Law: Probable Cause: Words and Phrases. \u201cProbable\n    cause\u201d is a term of art in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence that is\n    defined as a practical, nontechnical conception that deals with the fac-\n    tual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable\n    and prudent people, not legal technicians, act.\n39. Search Warrants: Affidavits: Probable Cause. The fundamental ques-\n    tion in a challenge to an affidavit for lack of probable cause is whether,\n    under the totality of the circumstances illustrated by the affidavit, the\n    issuing magistrate had a substantial basis for finding that the affidavit\n    established probable cause.\n40. ____: ____: ____. The magistrate who is evaluating the probable cause\n    question must make a practical, commonsense decision whether, given\n    the totality of the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, including the\n    veracity of and basis of knowledge of the persons supplying hearsay\n    information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a\n    crime will be found in a particular place.\n41. ____: ____: ____. Where the circumstances are detailed, where reasons\n    for crediting the source of information is given, and where the magis-\n    trate has found probable cause to exist, the court should not invalidate\n    the affidavit in a hypertechnical manner.\n42. Affidavits: Probable Cause. Reasonable minds frequently may dif-\n    fer on the question whether a particular affidavit establishes prob-\n    able cause.\n43. Probable Cause: Police Officers and Sheriffs. Law enforcement can-\n    not only rely on the general ubiquitous presence of cell phones in daily\n    life, or an inference that friends or associates most often communicate\n    by cell phone, as a substitute for particularized information to support\n    probable cause that a specific device contains evidence of a crime.\n44. ____: ____. To support probable cause, statements based on law enforce-\n    ment expertise and experience must be accompanied by particular facts\n    and circumstances such that, under the totality of the circumstances,\n    including commonsense conclusions about human behavior, there is a\n    substantial basis for concluding evidence of a crime will be found on the\n    phone or phone information searched.\n45. Search Warrants: Probable Cause. What will constitute sufficient\n    particularized information to support probable cause that a cell phone\n    or cell phone information searched will contain evidence of a crime\n    depends upon the nature and circumstances of the crime and what is\n    sought in the warrant.\n46. Criminal Law. It can be generally recognized that cell phones tend to\n    accompany their users everywhere, and thus, it may be inferred that a\n    suspect\u2019s cell phone probably accompanied the suspect at the time of\n    the crime.\n\f                                    - 86 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                    310 Nebraska Reports\n                              STATE v. SHORT\n                              Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\n47. Search Warrants: Probable Cause: Affidavits. A warrant may be\n    considered so lacking in indicia of probable cause if the applicant files\n    merely a bare bones affidavit, one which contains only wholly conclu-\n    sory statements and presents essentially no evidence outside of such\n    conclusory statements.\n48. Search and Seizure: Police Officers and Sheriffs. To trigger the exclu-\n    sionary rule, police conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclu-\n    sion can meaningfully deter such conduct and sufficiently culpable that\n    such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system, as exclu-\n    sion serves to deter deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent conduct, or\n    in some circumstances recurring or systemic negligence.\n49. Search Warrants: Affidavits: Police Officers and Sheriffs: Probable\n    Cause. The good faith exception is applicable to an affidavit that fails\n    to satisfy the substantial basis test to support probable cause, when\n    police officers act in objectively reasonable good faith in reliance upon\n    the warrant.\n50. Search Warrants. A purpose of the particularity requirement for a\n    search warrant is to prevent the issuance of warrants on loose, vague, or\n    doubtful bases of fact.\n51. Constitutional Law: Search and Seizure: Search Warrants: Police\n    Officers and Sheriffs. The particularity requirement of the Fourth\n    Amendment protects against open-ended warrants that leave the scope\n    of the search to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant or\n    permits seizure of items other than what is described.\n52. Constitutional Law: Search Warrants: Police Officers and Sheriffs.\n    To satisfy the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment, a\n    warrant must be sufficiently definite to enable the searching officer to\n    identify the property authorized to be seized.\n53. Search Warrants. The degree of specificity required in a warrant\n    depends on the circumstances of the case and on the type of items\n    involved.\n54. Search Warrants: Probable Cause: Evidence. A search warrant may\n    be sufficiently particular even though it describes the items to be seized\n    in broad or generic terms if the description is as particular as the sup-\n    porting evidence will allow, but the broader the scope of a warrant, the\n    stronger the evidentiary showing must be to establish probable cause.\n55. Search and Seizure: Search Warrants: Probable Cause. A warrant for\n    the search of the contents of a cell phone must be sufficiently limited in\n    scope to allow a search of only that content that is related to the prob-\n    able cause that justifies the search.\n56. Criminal Law: Police Officers and Sheriffs: Evidence. Officers can-\n    not predict where evidence of a crime will be located in a cell phone\n\f                                       - 87 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                      310 Nebraska Reports\n                                STATE v.

There is no way for law enforcement to know where\n      in the digital information associated with cell phones it will find evi-\n      dence of the specified crime.\n58.   Constitutional Law: Search Warrants. The most important constraint\n      in preventing unconstitutional exploratory rummaging is that the war-\n      rant limit the search to evidence of a specific crime, ordinarily within\n      a specific time period, rather than allowing a fishing expedition for all\n      criminal activity.\n59.   Constitutional Law: Search and Seizure. A brief examination of all\n      electronic data associated with a cell phone is usually necessary in order\n      to find where the information to be seized is located, and sucn examina-\n      tion is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n60.   Constitutional Law: Warrantless Searches: Search and Seizure.\n      Warrantless searches and seizures are per se unreasonable under the\n      Fourth Amendment, subject only to a few specifically established and\n      well-delineated exceptions, which must be strictly confined by their\n      justifications.\n61.   Constitutional Law: Arrests: Search and Seizure. In the case of a\n      lawful custodial arrest, a full search of a person is not only an exception\n      to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement, but is also a reasonable\n      search under that amendment.\n62.   Arrests: Search and Seizure: Probable Cause. A search incident to\n      an arrest can be made before an arrest as long as probable cause for the\n      arrest exists before the search.\n63.   ____: ____: ____. It does not matter that a defendant is not formally\n      placed under arrest until after a search, so long as the fruits of the search\n      are not necessary to support probable cause to arrest.\n64.   Warrantless Searches: Probable Cause: Police Officers and Sheriffs.\n      Probable cause to support a warrantless arrest exists only if law enforce-\n      ment has knowledge at the time of the arrest, based on information that\n      is reasonably trustworthy under the circumstances, which would cause a\n      reasonably cautious person to believe that a suspect has committed or is\n      committing a crime.\n65.   Arrests: Probable Cause: Police Officers and Sheriffs. Under the col-\n      lective knowledge doctrine, the existence of probable cause justifying a\n      warrantless arrest is tested by the collective information possessed by all\n      the officers engaged in a common investigation.\n\n   Appeal from the District Court for Douglas County: Horacio\nJ.

INTRODUCTION\n   The defendant challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a\nmotion to dismiss with prejudice or for absolute discharge\nbased on late disclosures of discovery information resulting\nin delays the defendant argues implicated his speedy trial\nrights. The defendant also challenges the admission of evi-\ndence at trial obtained from the searches of his residence, cell\nphones, call records, and cell site location information on the\nground that the searches violated his Fourth Amendment rights.\nSpecifically, the defendant asserts that the seizure of his cell\nphones was pursuant to an unlawful arrest and the information\ncontained thereon would not have been inevitably discovered;\nthe warrant for the search of his residence was based on an\naffidavit containing falsities and material omissions; the war-\nrants for the searches of his cell phones, call records, and\ncell site location information were supported by affidavits\nthat failed to support probable cause; and the warrants for the\nsearches of his cell phones, call records, and cell site location\ninformation lacked particularity.

Short\u2019s convictions stem from three separate\nincidents that were tried together in two trials after the first\ntrial resulted in a mistrial. Following a retrial, Short was con-\nvicted of murder in the first degree, a Class IA felony; use\nof a firearm to commit a felony, a Class IC felony; and two\ncounts of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, each\na Class ID felony, in relation to the death of Garion Johnson.\n\f                              - 89 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  310 Nebraska Reports\n                        STATE v. SHORT\n                        Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\nShort was acquitted on the murder charge relating to the death\nof Deprecia Neelon and the accompanying use of a firearm to\ncommit a felony charge. Short was sentenced to life imprison-\nment for Johnson\u2019s murder and 49 to 50 years\u2019 imprisonment\non each of the other convictions to be served consecutively\nwith the life sentence.\n                         1. Shootings\n   The charges stemmed from three separate shootings on sepa-\nrate days, August 5, 6, and 8, 2015, suspected to be perpetrated\nby Short, Preston Pope, and Shadow Harlan. Neelon was killed\non August 6. Johnson was suspected to be the target in all three\nshootings and was ultimately killed on August 8. Johnson was\nNeelon\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s cousin.\n                        (a) August 5, 2015\n    At approximately 6:35 p.m. on August 5, 2015, Johnson\nwas sitting in a white Chevy Impala outside of Neelon\u2019s resi-\ndence when an individual walked up and fired a gun at him.\nJohnson was able to run away as the shooter chased him. One\n\u00ad.45-caliber spent shell casing and a tennis shoe were recovered\n at the scene. Two witnesses identified a photograph of Pope as\n the shooter.\n                       (b) August 6, 2015\n   In the early evening hours on August 6, 2015, someone inten-\ntionally set the outside of Neelon\u2019s residence on fire. While\nNeelon was outside investigating and attempting to put the fire\nout, she was shot seven times and died at the scene.\n   That same night, an anonymous tip came in regarding a per-\nson named \u201cShadow\u201d telling people that he had been involved\nin a shooting a few blocks away. Officers responded to the\naddress provided in the tip, which was a couple blocks from\nthe Neelon residence, and apprehended Harlan as he tried to\nflee from the residence. Harlan matched witnesses\u2019 descriptions\nof the shooter and was wearing the same clothes described by\nwitnesses when he was apprehended.\n\f                               - 90 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  310 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. SHORT\n                         Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\n   Witnesses observed multiple individuals quickly leave the\narea after the Neelon shooting in two separate vehicles: an\nolder blue van and a white sedan. Officers later located and\nattempted a traffic stop of a van matching the description\non August 14, 2015. Pope fled the traffic stop and was later\narrested in the area where the van was located. The van was\nregistered to Pope\u2019s mother, but she told officers that Pope\nused it.\n   Evidence recovered at the Neelon residence included a black\nknit glove and three .45-caliber spent shell casings. A pricetag\nfrom a pair of jersey gloves was found in the alley about a\nblock away from the Neelon residence.\n   A fingerprint lifted from the pricetag was matched to Short.\nFurther DNA testing also revealed that Short could not be\nexcluded as a partial profile contributor to DNA found on the\ninside of the glove.\n\n                       (c) August 8, 2015\n   Johnson was at the residence of his girlfriend, Mikayla\nFinley, on Fontenelle Boulevard on the morning of August 8,\n2015. Finley told officers that she told Johnson to move her\nwhite Chevy Impala into the garage. When Johnson was out-\nside moving the Impala into the garage, Finley heard noises\nshe believed were gunshots. Johnson reversed the vehicle,\ncircled through neighboring yards, and crashed into the garage\nof a nearby residence, all while shots were being fired at\nthe Impala.\n   Finley told officers that she saw two males standing around\nher Impala and that one made eye contact with her. She pro-\nvided a general description of him to police, but was unable to\nidentify anyone when she was presented with a photographic\nlineup that day.\n   Witnesses, including Finley, described the shooters. Both\nwore dark clothing, and one was described as a Black male, in\nhis late teens, approximately 5 feet 8 inches tall, and dressed in\na black hoodie or a black hoodie with a red \u201cN\u201d on it.\n\f                               - 91 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   310 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v.

Another witness reported seeing two Black\nmales dressed in black hoodies and black sweatpants walk-\ning fast through yards, from the direction of where he heard\ngunshots and a crash, and subsequently heading south on 41st\nStreet. Seconds later, this witness saw what appeared to be a\nwhite Monte Carlo speed north on 41st Street. A police detec-\ntive lived in that area, and video surveillance from his house\nshowed a white Chevy Monte Carlo that traveled south on\nFontenelle Boulevard at 9:48 a.m.\n   Evidence recovered from the scene included four .45-caliber\nspent shell casings. Law enforcement believed the shooting\nwas related to the August 5 and 6, 2015, shootings.\n   Detectives were provided the description of the white Chevy\nMonte Carlo and Short\u2019s name, whose fingerprint matched the\nfingerprint found on the pricetag near the Neelon residence.\nAt 1:31 p.m., law enforcement arrived at Short\u2019s last known\naddress at 4268 Binney Street. There they discovered, parked in\nthe driveway, a white Chevy Monte Carlo with white and blue\n\u201cpaper plates\u201d and in-transits for \u201cM.S.\u201d in the window.\n              2. Search of Short\u2019s Residence\n   Det. Ryan Hinsley drafted an affidavit for a search warrant\nof 4268 Binney Street, and he joined law enforcement already\nat the residence at 4:17 p.m. on August 8, 2015, with the\nsigned search warrant.\n                            (a) Affidavit\n   In the affidavit for the search warrant, Hinsley stated officers\nhad just and reasonable grounds to believe that certain types of\nproperty would be found at 4268 Binney Street and requested\npermission to seize items from the house and from the Monte\nCarlo in the driveway, as well as the ability to process any\nareas that may contain a DNA profile or fingerprints.\n   Items of interest to be seized included venue items iden-\ntifying those parties either who owned or who were in\n\f                               - 92 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  310 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v.

FINLEY stated\n      she then heard a series of muffled banging noises coming\n      from the garage area which she believed were gun shots.\n      FINLEY advised she looked out the front window of the\n      residence and saw two unknown males standing around\n      her Impala and JOHNSON in the front seat attempting\n      to back out of the driveway. FINLEY stated one of the\n      males made eye contact with her and was described as a\n      [B]lack male, 16-18 years old, 5\u20328-5\u203210, 140-160 pounds,\n      wearing a black hoodie with a red \u201cN\u201d on the front\n      [of] it.\n   The affidavit stated what other witnesses on the scene of\nthe Johnson homicide on August 8, 2015, reported to law\nenforcement:\n         [Another witness] was also located at the scene and\n      brought to OPD Central for an interview.

Additionally, witnesses stated after the shooting\n      two [B]lack males were seen running through yards and\n      got into a white Chevy Monte Carlo parked towards\n      the west, which then fled from the area westbound on\n      Font[e]nelle Boulevard with paper plates.\n   Finally, the affidavit described how the investigation on\nAugust 8, 2015, progressed to 4268 Binney Street:\n\f                              - 94 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  310 Nebraska Reports\n                        STATE v. SHORT\n                        Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\n        On Saturday, August 8, 2015, members of the Omaha\n     Police Department later located a White Chevy Monte\n     Carlo with In-Transits and paper plates parked in front\n     of 4268 Binney Street. At that location, Officers also\n     located a party identified as Marcus SHORT [date of\n     birth] 10/. . ./89.\n                      (b) Fruits of Search\n   Officers in their search discovered two firearms in Short\u2019s\nbedroom at his residence, a .45-caliber Glock handgun and\na .357-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver. In addition to the\ntwo firearms, officers seized or took photographs of several\nother items found at the house, including a muddy pair of\nblack pants, two black hoodie sweatshirts, muddy shoes, and\ntwo pairs of black gloves.

Search of Content of Cell Phones\n  On August 11, 2015, officers obtained a warrant to search\nShort\u2019s cell phones that they had seized from Short\u2019s person\non August 8, which were an LG model LG237c flip-style\nphone (LG flip phone) and an LG model LS740 phone (LG\nsmart phone).\n                           (a) Affidavit\n   The affidavit for the search warrant included the informa-\ntion that (1) witnesses to the Johnson homicide described a\nsuspect vehicle fleeing the area after the shooting as being a\nwhite Chevy Monte Carlo with no license plates, displaying\nin-transits and dealer paper plates; (2) the suspect vehicle was\nlocated in the area of 42d and Binney Streets; (3) Short was\nidentified as the owner of the vehicle; (4) Short was located on\nAugust 8, 2015, and transported to OPD to be interviewed; and\n(5) Short had the LG flip phone and the LG smart phone in his\npossession, which were booked into evidence.\n   Further, the affidavit stated:\n         Affiant Officer knows, through training and experi-\n      ence, that persons use cellular telephones to communi-\n      cate. This includes . . . persons planning a crime, com-\n      mitting a crime and/or trying to regroup after committing\n      a crime.

The warrant further stated:\n      Affiant Officer or their agents may be required to exam-\n      ine every file and scan its contents briefly to determine\n      whether it falls within the scope of the warrant. This is\n      necessary as it is difficult to know prior to the search the\n      level of the technical ability of the device\u2019s user and data\n      can be hidden, moved, encoded or mislabeled to evade\n      detection.\n                     (c) Fruits of Search\n   Pursuant to this search, police determined that the phone\nnumber for the LG flip phone was 402-619-2962. Since this\nwas only a flip phone without capabilities to take screenshots,\nthe officer who examined the phone took photographs of\n\f                               - 97 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  310 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. SHORT\n                         Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\nthe screen and those photographs were entered into evidence.\nThe photographs of the LG flip phone\u2019s content included sev-\neral text messages and phone calls between this phone and\nPope\u2019s phone.\n   The LG smart phone had a \u201cSIM\u201d card, which usually con-\ntains only the subscriber number and phone number of the\ndevice. This card was removed from the phone and put into a\nreader to read the content on the card, and the number associ-\nated with the phone was discovered to be 702-619-1025.\n   The LG smart phone itself was \u201clocked,\u201d and OPD did\nnot have the capabilities in 2015 to take data from a locked\nphone. The LG smart phone was sent to a computer crime\ninstitute that used a computer program to read the data chip\nof the phone and then returned a readable report of its find-\nings. The data of the LG smart phone showed several contacts,\nincluding incoming and outgoing phone calls and text mes-\nsages between the LG smart phone and Pope\u2019s phone (contacts\nwith \u201cPlayboi\u201d) and contacts with \u201cShadow,\u201d perceived to be\nHarlan. The phone also showed that Short visited websites for\nnews articles about the homicides.\n           5. Search of Call Records With Cell\n                 Site Location Information\n   On August 11, 2015, a warrant was issued for information\nfrom a cell phone service provider in regard to the phone num-\nber 702-619-1025 (Short\u2019s LG smart phone) and a number of\nanother cell phone unrelated to Short\u2019s appeal. An identical\nwarrant was issued for information from another cell phone\nservice provider in regard to the phone number 402-619-2962\n(Short\u2019s LG flip phone) and two other numbers unrelated to\nShort\u2019s appeal. A new warrant was obtained on December 5,\n2018, for the search of call records and cell site location infor-\nmation for the LG smart phone, after the court\u2019s ruling that\nShort\u2019s statements as to his phone numbers, relied upon in the\noriginal warrant, were obtained as a fruit of an unlawful arrest\nand in violation of Short\u2019s Miranda rights and Short\u2019s right\nto counsel. The court determined the December 2018 search\n\f                               - 98 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   310 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. SHORT\n                         Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\nwarrant was independent of the tainted evidence because police\nobtained the same phone number associated with Short while\nexecuting a valid search warrant at Short\u2019s residence. No\nexplanation was offered as to why Short\u2019s LG flip phone was\nnot included in the 2018 warrant, since the phone number for\nthat phone was found during the search of the physical phone\npursuant to a valid search warrant discussed above.

It also authorized \u201c[a]ll records and other information\nrelating to\u201d that number and time period, including (1) the\nrecords of user activity for any connections made to or from\nthe account, including the date, time, length, and method of\nconnections, data transfer volume, user name, and source and\ndestination of internet protocol addresses; (2) all available\ntoll records to include call detail, \u201cSMS detail, data sessions,\nper call measurement data (PCMD), round trip time (RTT),\nNELOS, cell site and cell site sector information and cellular\nnetwork identifying information\u201d; (3) the noncontent informa-\ntion associated with the contents of any communication or file\nstored by or for the accounts, such as the source and destina-\ntion email addresses and internet protocol addresses; (4) the\ncorrespondence and notes of records related to the accounts;\nand (5) the current cellular site list, in electronic format, which\nincludes any and all markets, switches, and areas the target\nphone utilized during the time period above.\n                          (b) Affidavit\n    In support of the December 2018 warrant, the affidavit\n\u00adindicated the grounds for issuance of the search warrant\n included the following: (1) witnesses after the Johnson homi-\n cide stated that two Black males were seen running through\n yards and that they then got into a white Chevy Monte Carlo\n\f                                - 99 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   310 Nebraska Reports\n                          STATE v.

Through the course of the investigation it was\n      determined that suspect Marcus SHORT . . . resided at\n      this residen[ce]. Items of venue with Marcus SHORT\u2019s\n      name were located in the residence in the upstairs/attic\n      bedroom.\n          Item #12 document bearing Marcus SHORT\u2019s name\n      was found in the trash in the bedroom. The document was\n      issued from the Douglas County Public Defender\u2019s Office\n      containing the following information:\n          Client Name: SHORT, Marcus\n          Address: 4268 Binney Street Omaha, Ne 68111\n          Telephone Number: 702-619-1025\n          Date of Birth: 10/. . ./1989\n          Charges: Paraphernalia and Resisting\n          A second receipt from [a cell phone provider] with\n      Customer Name: Marcus Short phone number 702-619-\n      1025 dated 8/2/2015 1:41:58 pm was also located in the\n      bedroom of Marcus SHORT.\n          Affiant Officer believes through the receipts, Marcus\n      Short was using the phone number 702-619-1025 to com-\n      municate with others.\n   Regarding the need for the records for the investigation, the\naffidavit stated:\n          Affiant Officer believes that if she is granted this Search\n      Warrant the information received from the carrier would\n      help to identify other witnesses and suspects to the crime\n      under investigation.

This information would help to prove or\n     disprove statements of witnesses and/or suspects.\n        Affiant Officer is requesting the time period listed\n     above to determine a pattern of behavior for the target(s)\n     both before and after the crime under investigation.\n        From training, experience and research Affiant Officer\n     is aware that the data stored by cellular network provid-\n     ers can provide invaluable insight for criminal investiga-\n     tions. . . . In addition to personal use, cell phones are\n     often used as tools in criminal activity. Affiant Officer is\n     aware of numerous instances where cell phones were used\n     by participants in crimes to communicate via voice and\n     text messaging. Affiant Officer is also aware of instances\n     where the cell phone was operating in the background,\n     accessing the cell provider\u2019s network, and generating\n     location based data. When a cell phone interacts with the\n     cellular provider\u2019s network, it leaves records that allow\n     for the identification of locations where the cell phone\n     accessed the network. These interactions between the cell\n     phone and the network can be created intentionally or\n     accidentally by the user, or automatically by the device\n     itself as part of its regular functioning.\nThe affidavit further explained how each of the categories\nof information requested from the cell phone service provid-\ners could be \u201cinvaluable tools\u201d when conducting a criminal\ninvestigation such as assisting in identifying or confirming\nthe owner of a cell phone; constructing a timeline of events\nregarding an investigation; establishing communications\nbetween parties to identify coconspirators, witnesses, or vic-\ntims; establishing the proximity of a location of the cell phone\nto demonstrate that the device, and its user, was in a location\nassociated with an incident; and providing insight into an\nindividual\u2019s level of culpability and knowledge regarding an\ninvestigated incident.\n\f                               - 101 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  310 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. SHORT\n                         Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\n                       (c) Fruits of Search\n   The records received were sent to the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation for assistance. There, a special agent used the\ncall records provided by the two cell phone service providers\nto map out the cell towers being used during the activity of\nPope\u2019s phone and Short\u2019s LG smart phone on August 5, 6, and\n8, 2015, and to give an approximate location of the cell phones\non those dates. Using the call detail record with cell site infor-\nmation that identifies which switch, cell tower, and cell face\nsector of that tower that the cell phone used when it made a\ncall, the special agent was able to determine that Short\u2019s LG\nsmart phone made six calls between 5:30 and 7:30 p.m. on\nAugust 5 and was not in the area of the Neelon residence\nwhen these calls were made. Pope\u2019s phone made eight calls\nbetween 5:30 and 6:59 p.m. on August 5 while Pope\u2019s phone\nlocation progressed north and was within the footprint of the\ntower that covers the area of the Neelon residence by the time\nof the phone call at 6:26 p.m. On August 6, between 7:30 and\n9:07 p.m., Short\u2019s LG smart phone was not in the footprint of\nthe tower that covers the Neelon residence, but Pope\u2019s phone\nwas. On August 8, focusing on the Johnson homicide crime\nscene on Fontenelle Boulevard, the special agent determined\nthat between 6 and 8 a.m., Short\u2019s LG smart phone was in the\narea of his residence and then moved to the area of the Johnson\ncrime scene for phone calls made between 8 and 10 a.m.\nPope\u2019s phone was also in the area of the Johnson crime scene\non August 8 between 8 and 10 a.m. and was later in the area of\nShort\u2019s residence between 10 and 11 a.m.\n      6. Discovery Delays and Motions to Continue\n                Occurring Before Mistrial\n             (a) Short\u2019s October 4, 2016, Motion\n                    to Compel Discovery\n   On October 4, 2016, defense counsel moved to compel\ndiscovery the prosecution had failed to disclose in accordance\nwith a court order issued approximately 4 months before. In\n\f                              - 102 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  310 Nebraska Reports\n                        STATE v. SHORT\n                        Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\nthe motion, Short requested an order compelling the State to\nprovide the DNA results of the clothing tested; the fingerprint\nanalysis notes and reports for the glove found; the cell tower\ndata, reports, and notes for the LG flip phone and the LG smart\nphone; the call and text history for the \u201cwhite Iphone\u201d and the\n\u201cblack Sprint\u201d phone seized; all reports for multiple case files;\nand all photographs shown to Johnson\u2019s girlfriend, Finley, on\nAugust 8 and 10, 2015. The State explained at a hearing on the\nmotion that it was expediting disclosure of discovery materials\nthe best it could. No order resulted directly from the October 4\nmotion to compel.\n\n                (b) Short\u2019s December 12, 2016,\n                       Motion to Continue\n   On December 12, 2016, counsel for Short filed a motion\nto continue the trial on several grounds, including significant\ndelays in the receipt of discovery materials. The court granted\nthe motion to continue. It reset trial for May 15, 2017, stating\nin the order that the \u201cspeedy trial clock is stopped\u201d until then.\n\n                    (c) Short\u2019s May 3, 2017,\n                       Motion to Continue\n   After the State filed a motion for leave to endorse Marcela\nMitchell as a witness on May 2, 2017, Short filed a motion\non May 3 to continue trial based on the late disclosure on\nMay 2 of the OPD report that included Mitchell\u2019s identifica-\ntion of Pope from a photographic spread. Phillips admitted\nthat Mitchell identified Pope as an individual who attempted\nto shoot Johnson on August 5, 2015, but Phillips had failed to\ndictate a police report regarding this identification until March\n9, 2017. The court granted Short\u2019s motion to continue and reset\ntrial to begin on October 16. The court again stated in its order\nthat the \u201cspeedy trial clock is stopped\u201d until then.\n   The Douglas County public defender\u2019s office was appointed\nto represent Short as new counsel on June 27, 2017. On July\n5, the new counsel orally requested the court to continue the\n\f                               - 103 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   310 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v.

A\nnew trial date was set for March 19, 2018.\n          (d) Short\u2019s Motion for Additional Discovery\n   On November 14, 2017, Short filed a motion for additional\ndiscovery, requesting a copy of the \u201cHomicide Lead Sheet\u201d\nmaintained by the OPD homicide unit for the Johnson homi-\ncide and the Neelon homicide. This motion was granted by\nthe court on November 27 in an ongoing manner, such that the\nState was ordered to provide continuous updates if information\nwas added to the lead sheets.\n                 (e) Motion to Dismiss or Motion\n                      for Complete Discharge\n   Short\u2019s case was originally consolidated with the case\nagainst Pope, but after Short\u2019s motion to sever trials with Pope\nwas granted and Pope\u2019s trial was set to go first, on March 19,\n2018, Short\u2019s trial was ordered to commence April 30. On\nApril 13, Short filed a motion to dismiss all charges or, in the\nalternative, for a complete discharge. The motion relied on the\nconstitutional rights to due process and a speedy trial, as well\nas Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 29-1919 (Reissue 2016) regarding discov-\nery sanctions.\n   The motion outlined the discovery motions, orders, and\ncontinuances described above. Short noted that discovery con-\ntinued to be provided, with the most recent material received\non April 11, 2018. Short asserted that the untimely receipt of\ndiscovery materials was due to a \u201ccontinuing pattern of gross\nmisconduct and mis-management by [OPD].\u201d Short asserted\nthat his ability to prepare to defend these cases at trial had been\nseverely impeded.\n   Short argued that with trial scheduled to commence on\nApril 30, 2018, it would be highly unlikely the defense would\nbe able to locate witnesses in so short a time period between\ndisclosure of the witnesses\u2019 statements and the commence-\nment of trial. But Short did not seek another continuance.\nShort pointed out that trial had already been continued on\n\f                               - 104 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   310 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. SHORT\n                         Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\ntwo previous occasions due to late disclosure of discovery\nmaterials and explained that he was put in a place to either\n\u201crequest[] another continuance or proceed[] to trial without\nsufficient time to locate, interview, depose, and call as wit-\nnesses at trial, those witnesses who could provide exculpa-\ntory evidence at trial.\u201d Short argued that \u201cdue to the State\u2019s\ncontinuing inability and failure to comply with its discovery\nobligations and requirements, the State has violated Short\u2019s\nright to a speedy trial.\u201d\n   Short asked the court to dismiss with prejudice all charges\nagainst him or, in the alternative, to grant \u201ccomplete discharge\u201d\nof all charges, because, due to the misconduct of OPD, it\nwas impossible for Short to receive a fair trial. Further, Short\nargued that OPD\u2019s misconduct in failing to manage and dis-\nclose evidence and discovery materials was imputed to the\nprosecution, so the prosecution should be held responsible for\nsuch misconduct.\n          (i) Evidence Presented at Hearing on Motion\n   An evidentiary hearing on Short\u2019s motion to dismiss or for\ncomplete discharge was held on April 16, 18, and 19, 2018.\n   Phillips and Watson testified at the hearing. They were both\nassigned to the Neelon homicide investigation team. The detec-\ntives assigned to the Johnson homicide all completed their\npolice reports in a timely manner.\n   Phillips and Watson admitted that on multiple occasions dur-\ning the Neelon homicide investigation, years elapsed between\nconducting an interview and the generation of any police report\non that interview. They agreed this was not standard operat-\ning procedure for a homicide detective. Phillips admitted that\nshe had failed to complete reports in a timely manner in other\ncases, which resulted in a mistrial because of the late disclo-\nsure of police reports. As a result of the publicity regarding this\ncase and the pattern of delays in writing reports, Watson was\nremoved from the homicide unit.\n   Other sergeants and detectives with experience in the homi-\ncide unit at OPD testified that a detective is expected to\n\f                              - 105 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  310 Nebraska Reports\n                        STATE v.

Several detectives testified that they were able to\nwork overtime hours to complete reports and, in their opinion,\ntaking more than a year to complete a report is not acceptable\nand would be poor practice.\n   Watson testified his delays were because of the workload\nand having to prioritize active cases. He also testified that he\nhad experienced personal issues, such as heart failure, and that\nhis case materials were \u201call on hold\u201d during his medical leave\nin 2017. Because of these distractions and his workload, he had\nforgotten about interviews and misplaced discs. Phillips testi-\nfied that her delays were because of the workload and because\nof prioritizing cases where an arrest had been made.\n   The Douglas County Attorney testified at the hearing that\nhis office has an \u201copen file policy\u201d regarding discovery,\nwhereby his office sends defense counsel copies of all evi-\ndence provided by law enforcement agencies and other sources\nas soon as possible, and that his office relies on OPD to notify\nit when OPD receives more evidence. He testified that he was\naware of multiple occasions where two detectives, Phillips\nand Watson, failed to provide evidence and properly turn over\nevidence in a timely manner, resulting in one or more mis\u00ad\ntrials in the past. The Douglas County Attorney testified that\nhe informed the command staff at OPD of the ongoing con-\ncerns with Phillips and Watson, but that ultimately, he had no\nauthority over OPD.\n                 (ii) Order Denying Motion\n   On April 26, 2018, the court denied Short\u2019s motion to\ndismiss or, in the alternative, for complete discharge. The\ncourt acknowledged the above dates and procedure on how\nthe motion came to be and that \u201c[d]iscovery continues to be\nprovided and material was provided at least as late as April\n11, 2018.\u201d\n\f                                    - 106 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     310 Nebraska Reports\n                              STATE v. SHORT\n                              Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\n                          a. Speedy Trial\n    In examining whether Short\u2019s constitutional right to a\nspeedy trial was violated, the court separated the Johnson\nhomicide from the Neelon homicide because of the different\nOPD homicide teams assigned to each homicide. The court\nfound no constitutional speedy trial violations attributable to\nthe Johnson homicide investigation because the homicide team\nthat was assigned to that homicide investigated in a timely and\nefficient manner, and no discovery violation was attributed\nto their investigation. Accordingly, the court concluded that\nShort\u2019s motion to dismiss or motion for complete discharge, as\nit related to the Johnson homicide, was overruled.\n    In analyzing the Neelon homicide, the court used factors\nlaid out in Barker v. Wingo 1 to determine whether Short was\ndeprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial: (1) the\nlength of the delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) whether\nand when the defendant asserted his speedy trial right, and\n(4) whether the defendant was prejudiced by the delay. The\ncourt concluded the length of the delay was approximately\n10 months.\n    The court noted that the three prior continuances in this\ncase were on Short\u2019s motions in December 2016, May 2017,\nand June 2017. Then, upon severance of the trials for Short\nand Pope, Short\u2019s trial was set for April 30, 2018. After each\nmotion to continue was sustained, Short engaged in exten-\nsive pretrial litigation, and as of the date of the order, several\ndefense motions in limine and a motion to suppress were set\nfor hearing on April 27. The court acknowledged that there\nwas no evidence that the State deliberately attempted to delay\nthe trial. The court found that Short did not make a viable\nshowing that his defense of the Neelon homicide was preju-\ndiced due to unavailable witnesses that would have been avail-\nable at a more timely trial, nor that the witnesses were unable\nto accurately recall past events because of any delay.

SHORT\n                              Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\nthese reasons, the court found there was not a violation in the\nNeelon homicide of Short\u2019s right to a speedy trial.\n\n                         b. Due Process\n   In rejecting Short\u2019s argument that alleged due process viola-\ntions called for the dismissal of all criminal charges with preju-\ndice, the court found that \u201cthe conduct of Detective Phillips\nand Detective Watson, the lack of oversight by OPD, and the\nactions of the County Attorney\u2019s Office [did] not indicate bad\nfaith.\u201d The court acknowledged that the evidence showed a\npattern of failure to follow best practices and procedures, but\ndid not show any deliberate attempt to gain an unfair tactical\nadvantage, official animus, or a conscious effort to suppress\nexculpatory evidence. Thus, the evidence did not warrant the\nsevere sanction of the dismissal of charges.\n\n                     c. Statutory Violations\n   Finally, the court addressed the alleged statutory discovery\nviolations. The court acknowledged that Nebraska has not spe-\ncifically addressed what factors a court should consider when\nasked to dismiss an information because of a discovery viola-\ntion in a criminal case.\n   When looking at outside jurisdictions, the court acknowl-\nedged the preferred sanction is a continuance. The court noted\nthat the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that the rele\u00ad\nvant factors in determining an appropriate sanction for a dis-\ncovery violation are \u201c\u2018the reasons for the government\u2019s delay\nand whether it acted intentionally or in bad faith; the degree of\nprejudice, if any, suffered by the defendant; and whether any\nless severe sanction will remedy the prejudice and the wrong-\ndoing of the government.\u2019\u201d 2\n   The court reiterated that the evidence did not show Phillips\nor Watson acted in bad faith or with the intent to mislead,\ndeceive, or act with a sinister motive in not completing\n2\n    U.S. v. Davis, 244 F.3d 666 (8th Cir. 2001).\n\f                              - 108 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  310 Nebraska Reports\n                        STATE v. SHORT\n                        Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\ntheir reports in a timely manner; the State did not act in bad\nfaith; and any prejudice to Short\u2019s preparation for trial as a\nresult of the delays could be cured with a continuance. Based\non the finding that there was no bad faith on the part of the\nState, the court decided to impose the least severe sanction that\nwould accomplish prompt and full compliance with the discov-\nery order, \u201cwhich [was to allow] Short a continuance should he\nrequest one.\u201d\n\n                 7. Jury Selection and Mistrial\n   Short did not request a continuance, and jury selection for\nhis first trial proceeded as scheduled on April 30, 2018. Upon\nmotions from both parties, a mistrial was declared on May 8\ndue to improper jury contact by an unauthorized third party\nassociated with Short. Retrial was scheduled to commence on\nJanuary 7, 2019. The order scheduling retrial for January 7\nindicated that this was set by agreement of the parties.\n\n                 8. Retrial After Mistrial\n   Following the mistrial, Short did not renew his motion to\ndismiss or, in the alternative, for absolute discharge based on\ndiscovery violations. Short\u2019s retrial commenced as scheduled\non January 7, 2019. At trial, Short made several objections\nrelevant to this appeal. The court did not generally adopt its\nrulings from the aborted trial, but referred to the hearings and\nrulings on motions to suppress when Short objected to the\nsame evidence at the retrial.\n\n               (a) Seizure of Cell Phones and\n                     Search of Residence\n  Short objected at trial to the admission of all evidence stem-\nming from his allegedly unlawful de facto arrest when he was\nhandcuffed and placed in the police cruiser and concurrent\nunlawful seizure of his cell phones, and he objected to all\nevidence stemming from the search of his residence, which\nhe asserted was pursuant to a false and misleading affidavit.\n\f                               - 109 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  310 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. SHORT\n                         Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\nThese two objections purportedly encompassed all evidence\nfrom the search of the physical phones, his call records, and\nthe cell site location information, as well as the physical evi-\ndence seized at his residence.\n   The court overruled the motion regarding the seizure of the\nphones, reasoning the phones would have inevitably been dis-\ncovered when Short was lawfully arrested after discovery of\nthe firearms at Short\u2019s residence. The court reiterated its prior\nruling before the mistrial that the phones had been unlawfully\nseized during a de facto arrest without probable cause, but that\nthe inevitable discovery doctrine exception still allowed the\nseizure of the phones.\n   The court also overruled the objection relating to the affi-\ndavit in support of the search of Short\u2019s residence, which,\nas relevant to this appeal, focused on the statements that\nShort\u2019s fingerprints were found on the glove, that \u201cwitnesses\nstated after the shooting two [B]lack males were seen running\nthrough yards and got into a white Chevy Monte Carlo,\u201d and\nthat Short was located at 4268 Binney Street, as well as the\nomission of Finley\u2019s inability to identify Short as the shooter\nin a photographic spread. The court found that after striking\nthe disputed portions of the affidavit and including the omitted\ninformation, the affidavit was still sufficient to establish prob-\nable cause to search Short\u2019s residence. Alternatively, the court\nreiterated its findings that the evidence at hearings on Short\u2019s\nmotion to suppress, held before the mistrial, demonstrated that\nany false statements or omissions were not intentional or in\nreckless disregard for the truth.\n   Hinsley had testified that he based the affidavit on informa-\ntion he obtained from his interview of Finley and information\nrelayed to him by Sgt. Danette Culler, Phillips, and Watson,\nwho were all at the scene. Hinsley testified that he believed the\npricetag and the glove were the same evidence until he learned\nhis mistake shortly before the hearing. Hinsley explained he\nhad written the affidavit as he talked on the phone with Culler\nand had no reason to question or clarify the information\n\f                              - 110 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  310 Nebraska Reports\n                        STATE v. SHORT\n                        Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\nCuller was telling him. Culler denied that she told Hinsley\nthat Short\u2019s fingerprint was taken from the glove found at\nthe scene, and she testified that she recalled discussing with\nHinsley a pricetag that was found that contained a fingerprint\nmatch for Short.\n   The evidence at the hearings also demonstrated that offi-\ncers canvassing the area spoke with several witnesses related\nto the Johnson homicide and that some witnesses saw two\nBlack males leaving the scene while other witnesses saw only\none Black male leaving the scene. An officer testified that he\ncanvassed the area near the Johnson homicide scene, talked to\nmultiple witnesses, and relayed the information to the \u00adon-duty\nsergeant who was relaying it to homicide detectives. The offi-\ncer testified that there was not any one witness that saw both\nthe shooting and a suspect or suspects get into the white Monte\nCarlo. The officer further testified that some witnesses claimed\nto have seen all or parts of the shooting and that there were\nother witnesses who had information about the white Monte\nCarlo, but no idea about the shooting. Hinsley testified that he\nnamed only two witnesses in the affidavit as witnesses person-\nally interviewed by him or another detective at OPD and that\nhe was not provided specific names of the other witnesses,\nbut he relayed a conglomeration of information provided by a\nnumber of people from the uniformed officers and detectives at\nthe scene that was relayed to him through Culler.\n   The evidence at the hearings demonstrated Short was not\nlocated at 4268 Binney Street, but was actually located walking\ntoward 4268 Binney Street, inside the crime scene perimeter\ntape, three or four houses away.\n   Evidence showed that Finley failed to identify Short as the\nshooter when shown a photograph of him and that the affidavit\nomitted specific interviews with witnesses who observed only\none male firing into the car. Hinsley testified that he had \u201cno\ngood reason\u201d for not including the information that Finley did\nnot identify Short as the shooter that she saw and described to\nlaw enforcement.\n\f                               - 111 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   310 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. SHORT\n                         Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\n   The court found that Hinsley\u2019s and Culler\u2019s testimonies were\ntruthful and credible and that the evidence was insufficient\nto prove that Hinsley intentionally misled the court or acted in\nreckless disregard for the truth in preparing the affidavit. The\ncourt found that the averment in the affidavit regarding Short\u2019s\nfingerprint being found on a glove rather than the pricetag for\nthe glove near the Neelon residence was due to mistake or\nsimple negligence not rising to perjury or reckless disregard for\nthe truth. The court further found that the averment of where\nShort was arrested being \u201cat the location\u201d of 4268 Binney\nStreet, rather than approximately three houses away after he\nhad crossed the taped crime scene area, was \u201cinsignificant.\u201d\nThe court found that the averment in the affidavit stating \u201cwit-\nnesses\u201d stated they saw \u201ctwo [B]lack males,\u201d as opposed to\none Black male, was not false, misleading, or in reckless dis-\nregard for the truth, because it was a summary statement based\non interviews with multiple witnesses and the majority of the\nwitnesses interviewed saw two Black males. The court found\nthe omission of Finley\u2019s failure to identify Short was not mis-\nleading or in reckless disregard for the truth.\n            (b) Affidavits and Warrants for Searches\n                   of Cell Phone Information\n   Short alternatively objected to all evidence derived from the\nsearch of the LG flip phone and the LG smart phone, his call\nrecords, and his cell site location information for the reason that\nthe warrants for the searches lacked the requisite particularity\nunder the Fourth Amendment and the affidavits supporting the\nwarrants lacked sufficient facts to support findings of probable\ncause. With regard to the lack of probable cause, Short argued\nthat there was insufficient supporting averments establishing\na nexus between the cell phone information to be searched\nand the crimes. According to Short, the affidavits generically\nset forth that cell phone data and information can be help-\nful in police investigations and the affidavits were devoid of\nevidence showing the use of cell phones in the specific crimes\nunder investigation.\n\f                               - 112 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  310 Nebraska Reports\n                         STATE v. SHORT\n                         Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\n   The court overruled the objections, finding that the affida-\nvits supported probable cause and that the warrants did not\nlack in the necessary particularity. It referred back to its prior\nfindings in relation to Short\u2019s motion to suppress before the\nmistrial, that the affidavit in support of the search warrant was\nsufficiently detailed and specific so as to establish probable\ncause that Short was connected to the ongoing Johnson homi-\ncide investigation and more than one individual may have been\ninvolved in the Johnson homicide. Applying the totality of the\ncircumstances test, the court found that there was probable\ncause to believe that evidence of a crime would be found in the\ncell phone data of the two cell phones to be searched. The dis-\ntrict court found in the alternative that even if the search war-\nrants were not supported by probable cause, the warrants were\nexecuted in good faith. Further, the court found that the search\nwarrants were particular because they specifically referred to\nthe Johnson homicide and to the type of information encom-\npassed by its authorization.\n\n                III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Short assigns, reworded, that the district court erred when\nit (1) denied his motion to suppress the fruits of the search of\nhis residence after the \u201cFranks hearing,\u201d when the affidavit in\nsupport of the search warrant provided insufficient evidence\nto support a finding of probable cause; (2) denied his motion\nto suppress the two cell phones taken from his person inci-\ndent to his unlawful arrest; (3) denied his motion to suppress\nthe information obtained from a search of the contents of the\ntwo cell phones, because the phones were seized unlawfully\nand the warrant was issued on insufficient evidence to sup-\nport a finding of probable cause, was overly broad, and lacked\nparticularity; (4) denied his motion to suppress call records\nand cell site location information from the cell phone service\nproviders because that information was obtained pursuant to\na search warrant that lacked sufficient probable cause, was\noverbroad, and lacked particularity and that the information in\n\f                                     - 113 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                      310 Nebraska Reports\n                               STATE v.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1] Generally, a trial court\u2019s determination as to whether\ncharges should be dismissed on speedy trial grounds is a fac-\ntual question which will be affirmed on appeal unless clearly\nerroneous. 3\n   [2] Trial courts have broad discretion with respect to sanc-\ntions involving discovery procedures, and their rulings thereon\nwill not be reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion. 4\n   [3] In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress\nevidence based on a claimed violation of the Fourth Amend\u00ad\nment, we apply a two-part standard of review. Regarding his-\ntorical facts, we review the trial court\u2019s findings for clear error,\nbut whether those facts trigger or violate Fourth Amendment\nprotections is a question of law that we review independently\nof the trial court\u2019s determination. 5\n   [4] We review the trial court\u2019s findings as to whether the\naffidavit supporting the warrant contained falsehoods or omis-\nsions and whether those were made intentionally or with reck-\nless disregard for the truth for clear error. 6 We review de novo\nthe determination that any alleged falsehoods or omissions\nwere not necessary to the probable cause finding. 7\n3\n    State v.

ANALYSIS\n                     1. Late Disclosure of\n                     Discovery Materials\n   We first address Short\u2019s assignments that the trial court erred\nin denying his motions to dismiss and for absolute discharge.\nShort argues that under both due process and \u00a7 29-1919, the\ncourt should have dismissed the case against him as a sanc-\ntion for the prosecution\u2019s delay in disclosing police interviews.\nShort does not argue that these delays, due to OPD\u2019s failure\nto timely generate reports on the interviews, resulted in the\nunavailability of exculpatory witness testimony. Instead, he\nasserts he was prejudiced because the delays implicated his\nspeedy trial rights. Short alternatively asserts that the district\ncourt erred in denying his motion for absolute discharge (which\nis the same as dismissal with prejudice), because the need\nfor continuances to adequately prepare his defense after the\ndelayed disclosures deprived him of his constitutional right to\na speedy trial.\n              (a) Constitutional Speedy Trial Right\n   [7,8] We begin with the constitutional right to a speedy trial,\nsince it lies at the core of all of Short\u2019s arguments concerning\nthese motions.

I, \u00a7 11, provides, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the\naccused shall have the right to . . . a speedy . . . trial . . . .\u201d The\nright to a speedy trial is unique from other rights enshrined in\nthe U.S. Constitution for the protection of the accused because\nthere is a societal interest in providing a speedy trial, which\nexists separate from, and at times in opposition to, the interests\nof the accused. 11 The deprivation of the right to a speedy trial\nmay work to the accused\u2019s advantage when adverse witnesses\nbecome unavailable or their memories fade over time. 12\n   [9] \u201c[T]he right to speedy trial is a . . . vague concept,\u201d since\n\u201c[w]e cannot definitely say how long is too long in a system\nwhere justice is supposed to be swift but deliberate.\u201d 13 Instead,\nunder the test set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court, we weigh\n(1) the length of delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) whether\nthe defendant asserted his or her speedy trial rights, and (4)\nwhether the defendant suffered possible prejudice. 14 None of\nthe four factors is a necessary or sufficient condition to the\nfinding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial; rather, they\nare related factors and must be considered together with other\ncircumstances as may be relevant. 15 The length of the delay,\nhowever, is a triggering mechanism for the four-factor test. 16\nUntil there is some delay that is presumptively prejudicial,\nthere is no necessity for inquiry into the other factors that go\ninto the balance in determining if the right to a speedy trial has\nbeen violated. 17\n11\n     See State v.

Shulick 20 specifically rejected such\nan argument. The court explained:\n      Counsel cannot seek and obtain continuances to give the\n      defense more time to be ready for trial because of the\n      Government\u2019s dilatory behavior and then after the fact\n      reverse course and claim that the indictment should be\n      dismissed on the ground that defendant\u2019s right to a speedy\n      trial under the Constitution has been infringed because of\n      that behavior. 21\nIt continued, \u201cCourts have cautioned against this sort of tactic\nand have particularly frowned upon it when the right is not\nasserted until the eve of trial.\u201d 22\n18\n     See, U.S. v.

SHORT\n                               Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\n   The Shulick court relied upon United States v. Loud Hawk, 23\nwherein the U.S. Supreme Court held that delays caused by\nthe defendant\u2019s interlocutory appeal will not ordinarily weigh\nin favor of constitutional speedy trial claims. Defendants who\nresort to an interlocutory appeal \u201cnormally should not be able\n. . . to reap the reward of dismissal for failure to receive a\nspeedy trial.\u201d 24 Further, \u201c\u2018Having sought the aid of the judicial\nprocess and realizing the deliberateness that a court employs in\nreaching a decision, [such] defendants are not now able to criti-\ncize the very process which they . . . called upon.\u2019 . . .\u201d 25\n   [11] We agree with this reasoning and find it applicable to\nthe continuances sought and obtained by Short in response to\nthe State\u2019s late disclosure of discovery materials before the\nmistrial. Short did not first seek dismissal under speedy trial\nprinciples, but waited until after the period of the continuances\ngranted at his request to assert that trial had been delayed for\ntoo long. He cannot claim the loss of the fundamental right to\na speedy trial through the inherent delays of a process he him-\nself called upon\u2014even if that process was to vindicate another\nfundamental right.\n   [12] Short did finally elect to stand on his constitutional\nright to a speedy trial when he filed his motion to dismiss or,\nin the alternative, for absolute discharge, after new late disclo-\nsures were made following the period of the requested contin\u00ad\nuances. However, in considering whether Short\u2019s constitutional\nrights to a speedy trial were violated, we must bear in mind\nthere was a mistrial. Absent extraordinary circumstances, we\ndo not consider the entire period of time beginning with the\noriginal charge or arrest in computing the length of the delay\nwhen there has been a mistrial. 26 Instead, the constitutional\n23\n     United States v.

We cannot say the court clearly\nerred in this determination. The record reflects no evidence that\nOPD\u2019s conduct constituted a deliberate tactic to circumvent\nShort\u2019s speedy trial rights. Thus, our speedy trial analysis con-\nsiders only the period of delay following the mistrial.\n   [14,15] That period of delay was only 246 days, approxi-\nmately 8 months. The U.S. Supreme Court has noted with\napproval that \u201c[d]epending on the nature of the charges, the\nlower courts have generally found postaccusation delay \u2018pre-\nsumptively prejudicial\u2019 at least as it approaches one year.\u201d 29\nA delay of a year or more is the benchmark commonly recog-\nnized as presumptively prejudicial in a constitutional speedy\ntrial analysis. 30 This is especially true for more complex and\nserious crimes.

Short will not benefit, in a speedy\ntrial analysis, from such misconduct. Given the complex-\nity of this case\u2014involving two murder charges and multiple\nshootings\u2014we do not find the 246-day delay to be presump-\ntively prejudicial.\n   We thus need not engage in the four-factor analysis to con-\nclude that Short\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial was\nnot violated. But, for the sake of completeness, we find that\nthe Barker four-factor analysis would not lead us to a differ-\nent conclusion. The order of the district court setting the date\nfor retrial was agreed upon by the parties and nothing in the\nrecord, or in Short\u2019s brief, disputes this. In the same vein,\nat no point after the mistrial did Short make a constitutional\nspeedy trial challenge to the delay in commencing the new\ntrial. While courts cannot presume waiver of fundamental\nconstitutional rights from inaction or from a silent record,\n\u201cthe defendant\u2019s assertion of or failure to assert his [or her]\nright to a speedy trial is one of the factors to be considered in\nan inquiry into the deprivation of the right,\u201d and a failure to\nassert speedy trial rights will make it difficult for the defend\u00ad\nant to prove the denial of a speedy trial. 33 And the court found,\nas discussed, the delays were not intentional or in bad faith.\nFinally, Short makes no argument that he was prejudiced by\nthe delay in terms of ultimately mounting his defense at trial,\nthough he asserts he was incarcerated for an oppressive length\nof time.\n   Generally, a trial court\u2019s determination as to whether charges\nshould be dismissed on speedy trial grounds is a factual\nquestion which will be affirmed on appeal unless clearly\n32\n     See, People v.

This factual finding was not\nclearly erroneous. The district court also found the prejudice\nto Short would be removed when, once provided the discovery\ninformation, Short were afforded an adequate opportunity to\nmake use of the information and material in the preparation\nof his defense. Based on that, the court stated that if Short\nrequested a continuance, the court would grant it. It declined\nto impose the extreme sanction of dismissal. Short never\nrequested a continuance after the court\u2019s ruling.\n   [23] An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court\u2019s deci-\nsion is based upon reasons that are untenable or unreasonable\nor if its action is clearly against justice or conscience, reason,\nand evidence. 50 We have already determined that Short\u2019s right\nto a speedy trial was not violated through the late disclosures\nof discovery materials. We are, as was the court below, deeply\nconcerned with the level of neglect that resulted in the late dis-\nclosures in this case. But the court did not clearly err in find-\ning it was not the result of intentional or reckless conduct, and\nthe record reflects that OPD had taken disciplinary measures\nto remedy the situation. We find no abuse of discretion in the\ndistrict court\u2019s determination that a continuance, if requested,\nwas the least severe sanction that would adequately punish the\ngovernment and secure future compliance, and certainly, it did\nnot abuse its discretion in refusing to impose the most severe\nsanction of dismissal.\n          2. Fruits of Search of Short\u2019s Residence\n   Short\u2019s remaining assignments of error pertain to his objec-\ntions to the admission of evidence as fruits of various Fourth\nAmendment violations.

There was no evidence that the\nstatement regarding where exactly Short was found or what\nitem his fingerprint was found on was anything other than\ninadvertent. With regard to the omission of the photographic\nspread, Finley had told Hinsley there may have been two indi-\nviduals. Thus, Hinsley may have overlooked the materiality of\nthe failure to identify Short, when Finley saw only one of the\nshooters. Regarding the statement about witnesses seeing two\nBlack males running toward a white Chevy Monte Carlo after\nthe shooting, this court has held that observations by fellow\nofficers engaged in a common investigation are a reliable basis\nfor a warrant and that probable cause is to be evaluated by the\ncollective information of the police as reflected in the affidavit\nand is not limited to the firsthand knowledge of the officer who\nexecutes the affidavit. 70\n   Because the district court did not clearly err in finding the\nalleged falsehoods or omissions were not made knowingly and\nintentionally or with a reckless disregard for the truth, we need\nnot review the district court\u2019s reexamination of the affidavit\nafter deleting the false or misleading statement and including\nthe omitted information.

Fruits of Search of Short\u2019s Cell Phones,\n         Call Records, and Location Information\n   Short\u2019s other Fourth Amendment arguments concern the\nadmission of evidence derived from the search of Short\u2019s cell\nphones, call records, and cell phone location information. He\nargues the contents within the four corners of the affidavits for\nthe relevant search warrants failed to establish probable cause.\nHe also asserts the warrants themselves lacked particularity.\nAnd, with respect to the search of the cell phones, Short argues\nthey were seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n            (a) Affidavits Supporting Probable Cause\n   We first examine the sufficiency of the affidavits challenged\non appeal. Short asserts the affidavit for the search of his cell\nphones and the affidavit in support of the 2018 search warrant\nfor his LG smart phone\u2019s call records and cell site location\ninformation both lack a nexus between the crimes under inves-\ntigation and the items to be searched. And Short claims the\naffidavits are so facially inadequate that the good faith excep-\ntion to the exclusionary rule does not apply.\n   [32,33] Probable cause sufficient to justify issuance of a\nsearch warrant means a fair probability that contraband or evi-\ndence of a crime will be found in the item to be searched. 71 The\nFourth Amendment\u2019s express requirement of particularity for a\nsearch warrant is closely related to its express requirement of\nprobable cause. 72 Thus, the U.S. Supreme Court has explained\nthe critical element in a reasonable search of property is not\nthat the owner of property is suspected of crime, but, rather,\nthat there is reasonable cause to believe the specific things to\nbe searched for and seized are located on the property to which\nentry is sought. 73\n71\n     State v.

SHORT\n                                Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\n   Short\u2019s arguments with respect to the 2018 affidavit in sup-\nport of the search of Short\u2019s call records and cell site loca-\ntion information are similar. Short claims the 2018 affidavit\n\u201csimply contains boilerplate assertions of generic \u2018criminals\u2019\nconduct\u2019\u201d without \u201cany information specific as to why there\nis probable cause to believe that [the call records and cell site\nlocation information] will contain evidence of the crime under\ninvestigation.\u201d 87\n   In State v. Said, 88 we held the affidavit supporting the\nsearch warrant for the contents of a cell phone was sufficient\nto establish probable cause when, in addition to statements set-\nting forth the officer\u2019s general knowledge of how cell phones\nmay be used by a person who has committed a crime and that\nevidence of the crime may generally be found on a suspect\u2019s\ncell phone, the affidavit set forth specific information derived\nfrom the investigation indicating the suspect\u2019s involvement\nin the crime, as well as allegations that the suspect had com-\nmunicated with others and sought information regarding that\ncrime. We explained the judge could infer from this informa-\ntion the suspect likely used his cell phone to search the inter-\nnet for information and in communicating with others about\nthe crime.\n   [43,44] We did not elaborate in Said upon general principles\napplicable to affidavits for searches of cell phone informa-\ntion or describe what other hypothetical facts would or would\nnot support probable cause to search a cell phone or cell\nphone information. But several other courts have addressed\nthe issue.

For example, to search the con-\ntents of cell phones in relation to a crime involving an accom-\nplice, courts have found affidavits provide sufficient support\nfor probable cause when they contain averments showing the\nsuspect was working with at least one other person when the\ncrime was committed; was in possession of a cell phone near\nthe time of the crime; and a law officer, based on experience\nand specialized training, believed the search likely to yield\nevidence of communications and coordination among these\nmultiple participants. 90 To search cell site location information,\nin contrast, courts have found the necessary nexus where there\nwere facts in the affidavit showing the suspect probably com-\nmitted a crime, the nature of which makes location informa-\ntion possibly incriminating, and the suspect was known to own\nor use the particular phone. 91 It can be generally recognized\n89\n     Commonwealth v.

Both lengthy affidavits, described in\ndetail in the background section above, were far from \u201cbare\nbones.\u201d A warrant may be considered so lacking in indicia of\nprobable cause if the applicant files merely a bare bones affi-\ndavit, one which contains only wholly conclusory statements\nand presents essentially no evidence outside of such conclu-\nsory statements. 93\n   The affidavits set forth numerous specific facts derived from\nthe investigation supporting the probability that Short was\ninvolved in the homicides. The question is whether the specific\naverments provided a substantial basis for the likelihood that\nsearching the cell phones, call records, and cell site location\ninformation would produce evidence of the specific crimi-\nnal activity described. However, the district court found that\nregardless of whether the information within the four corners\nof the affidavits contained sufficient particularized information\nto support probable cause that the information authorized by\nthe warrants to be searched would contain evidence of a crime,\nthe officers acted in good faith in carrying out the warrants. We\nagree the good faith exception applies.\n   [48,49] Application of the good faith exception to the exclu-\nsionary rule is a question of law. 94 The U.S. Supreme Court has\nexplained that to trigger the exclusionary rule, police conduct\nmust be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully\ndeter such conduct and sufficiently culpable that such deter-\nrence is worth the price paid by the justice system, as exclu-\nsion serves to deter deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent\n92\n     See id.\n93\n     Stevenson v.

Neither search\nis overbroad, because \u201c[c]riminals don\u2019t advertise where they\nkeep evidence.\u201d 112 A cell phone serves the same function as a\nfiling cabinet, and there is no way for law enforcement to know\nin advance how a suspect may label or code files that contain\nevidence of criminal activity. 113\n    The U.S. Supreme Court in Riley v. California, 114 in hold-\ning a warrant is required to search data stored in cell phones\nseized incident to arrest, recognized \u201ca cell phone search would\ntypically expose to the government far more than the most\nexhaustive search of a house.\u201d The Court did not thereby sug-\ngest that such an extensive search would be impermissible with\na warrant.\n    [56,57] Officers cannot predict where evidence of a crime\nwill be located in a cell phone or call records or in what\n110\n    Brief for appellant at 67.\n111\n    See, State v.

We accordingly hold that the breadth of electronic\ninformation that the warrants here authorized law enforcement\nto sift through did not render them unconstitutional under the\nparticularity clause of the Fourth Amendment.\n   Regarding the extensiveness of the list of items to be\nsearched for and seized, while sifting through the extensive\ndata, this court in State v.

The items listed\nin the warrant in Goynes included all of the following:\n      cell phone information, configurations, calendar events,\n      notes, and user account information which could identify\n      who owns or was using a cell phone; call logs which\n      could establish familiarity between people involved and\n      timelines of an incident; short and multimedia messaging\n      service messages, chat and instant messages, and emails\n      which could provide insight to establish an individ\u00ad\n      ual\u2019s level of culpability and knowledge of the incident;\n      installed application data which could aid in determining\n      a user\u2019s historical geographic location and demonstrate\n      the user\u2019s association with investigated people, location,\n      and events; media files such as images, videos, audio, and\n      documents which could provide times and locations, as\n      well as firsthand documentation of the incident; internet\n      browsing history which could demonstrate the planning,\n      desire, and participation in a crime; cell tower connec-\n      tions, global positioning system data, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,\n      and synchronization logs which could provide informa-\n      tion on location in relation to the incident; and user dic-\n      tionary information which could demonstrate familiarity\n      with the crime being investigated. 122\nWe rejected the argument that because the extensive list\nencompassed practically the entirety of the data contained\nwithin cell phones, it was no different than a warrant autho-\nrizing the search of \u201cany and all\u201d information stored on a\ncell phone. 123\n   We explained in Goynes that the warrants in Henderson\nviolated the requirements of particularity because, in addition\nto listed types of cell phone data to search, they authorized\n122\n      Id. at 142-43, 927 N.W.2d at 356.\n123\n      Id. at 143, 927 N.W.2d at 356 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\f                                  - 141 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                    310 Nebraska Reports\n                            STATE v.

This was because the warrant\ndescribed the crime, listed the specific areas to be searched,\nand did not contain unqualified language that would permit the\nsearch of the cell phone for \u201cany other information.\u201d 126\n   Neither warrant at issue here contained the catchall phrase\nwe found unconstitutional in Henderson. The 2018 warrant\nfor the call records and cell site location information speci-\nfied the crime of homicide and a limited time period of July\n8 to August 10, 2015. The warrant to search the physical cell\nphones limited the search to evidence relating to the homicide\nof Johnson. While both warrants might be viewed as exten-\nsive, they did not lack in particularity. The authorization to\n\u201cexamine every file and scan its contents briefly to determine\nwhether it falls within the scope of the warrant\u201d does not\nnegate that particularity. The district court did not err in deter-\nmining the warrants satisfied the particularity requirements of\nthe Fourth Amendment.\n\n                    (c) Pat-Down Search and\n                     Seizure of Cell Phones\n   Lastly, we find no merit to Short\u2019s argument that the searches\nof his phones are tainted by their alleged illegal seizure.

Thus, the only fruits of the seizure of\nthe phones was the evidence, not also found in the search of\ndata for the phone numbers, derived from the search of the\nphysical phones. Such evidence was minimal and consisted\nof contacts between Short and Pope, contacts between Short\nand Harlan, and indications that Short\u2019s phone either searched\nfor and accessed or was sent and downloaded news reports on\nthe homicides from a television station\u2019s website. Regardless,\nin our de novo review, we conclude the warrantless seizure\nof Short\u2019s cell phones while he sat in the police cruiser was\nnot unlawful.\n   [60,61] Warrantless searches and seizures are per se unrea-\nsonable under the Fourth Amendment, subject only to a few\nspecifically established and well-delineated exceptions, which\nmust be strictly confined by their justifications. 127 These\nexceptions include searches incident to a valid arrest. 128 In\nUnited States v. Robinson, 129 the U.S. Supreme Court held\nthat in the case of a lawful custodial arrest, a full search of\na person is not only an exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s\nwarrant requirement, but is also a reasonable search under that\namendment. 130\n   [62,63] Further, it has been held that a search incident to an\narrest can be made before an arrest as long as probable cause\nfor the arrest exists before the search. 131 It does not matter that\na defendant is not formally placed under arrest until after a\n127\n    State v.

Further, the officers testi-\nfied at trial that, at the time Short arrived at his residence,\nthey believed that these homicides were connected based on\nthe attempted shooting of Johnson in front of the Neelon\nresidence the day before Neelon was shot and killed at her\nhome. This information was reasonably trustworthy under the\ncircumstances and would cause a reasonably cautious person\nto believe that these homicides were connected, that Short had\nbeen present at both homicide scenes, and that Short had com-\nmitted a crime.\n   We find as a matter of law there was probable cause to arrest\nShort when the phones were seized. As such, we need not\nanalyze whether the district court was correct that the phones\n132\n    See id.\n133\n    State v. Garcia, 302 Neb. 406, 923 N.W.2d 725 (2019).\n134\n    State v.

We affirm the district court\u2019s finding that law\nenforcement did not obtain the phones in violation of the\nFourth Amendment. 135\n\n                       VI. CONCLUSION\n   Short\u2019s cell phones were not seized during an unlawful\narrest, and the search of his residence was not pursuant to a\nwarrant supported by an affidavit containing intentional or\nreckless falsities or omissions. The warrants supporting the\nsearches of Short\u2019s physical phones, digital call records, and\ncell site location information were sufficiently particular, and\nthe affidavits supporting the warrants contained sufficient\nevidence connecting the criminal activity and the place to\nbe searched for law enforcement\u2019s reliance thereupon to be\nin good faith. Whether from the perspective of the constitu-\ntional right to a speedy trial, due process, statutory discovery\nrules, or all combined, the district court did not err in denying\nShort\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice or, in the alterna-\ntive, for absolute discharge. For all these reasons, we find\nno merit to Short\u2019s assignments of error and affirm the judg-\nment below.\n                                                     Affirmed.\n135\n      See State v. Jennings, supra note 103.\n\n   Miller\u2011Lerman, J., concurring.\n   I concur in the result reached by the court, but write sepa-\nrately simply to remark on the path followed in our analysis\nwith respect to the propriety of the search of the cell phone.\nIn its opinion, this court proceeded to the good faith inquiry\nwithout first having resolved the Fourth Amendment issue.

SHORT\n                        Cite as 310 Neb. 81\n\nmy view, it would have been advisable to address the merits\nof the Fourth Amendment claim before proceeding to the good\nfaith issue.\n   The jurisprudence of cell phone searches is evolving.\nThis case presented an opportunity to resolve certain Fourth\nAmendment issues before considering the application of the\ngood faith exception to the exclusionary rule. In fact, in United\nStates v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 925, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L.\nEd. 2d 677 (1984), the origin case of the good faith rule, the\nSupreme Court recognized that \u201cit frequently will be difficult\nto determine whether the officers acted reasonably without\nresolving the Fourth Amendment issue.\u201d This is because the\nFourth Amendment analysis addresses judicial errors, whereas\nthe good faith analysis addresses subsequent police errors\nwhen viewed against settled law.\n   I argue that there are hazards inherent in deciding the good\nfaith issue without first having resolved the legal issues in the\nFourth Amendment claim. The Supreme Court described this\nargument when it stated that \u201capplication of the good\u2011faith\nexception to searches conducted pursuant to warrants will\npreclude review of the constitutionality of the search or sei-\nzure, deny needed guidance from the courts, or freeze Fourth\nAmendment law in its present state.\u201d United States v. Leon, 468\nU.S. at 924. But the Supreme Court did not adopt an inflexible\npractice of requiring a finding that the warrant was inadequate\nas a predicate to proceeding to the good faith inquiry.\n   We generally decide cases on the basis on which they\nwere resolved in the trial court. In this case, the trial court\naddressed the merits of the Fourth Amendment issue and\nalso considered the good faith exception. So our consider-\nation of the good faith issue was invited. We are not alone in\naddressing the good faith issue without deciding the Fourth\nAmendment claim. For example, in U.S. v. White, 874 F.3d\n490 (6th Cir. 2017), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit recognized that the trial court had ruled on both the\nmerits of the Fourth Amendment issue and the good faith\n\f                              - 146 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  310 Nebraska Reports\n                        STATE v.

In so doing, it said, \u201c[w]e therefore proceed to the\ngood\u2011faith inquiry, assuming, without deciding, that the affi-\ndavit failed to establish probable cause.\u201d U.S. v. White, 874\nF.3d at 495\u201196.\n   Given the foregoing, I respectfully suggest that, rather than\nfreezing Fourth Amendment cell phone search Nebraska juris-\nprudence in its present state, we address the merits in the\nnext case.\n\f",
