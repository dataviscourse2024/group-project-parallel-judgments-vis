WR-82,035-01\n\n\n                        EX PARTE SANDRA COY BRIGGS, Applicant\n\n\n                 ON APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\n                CAUSE NO. 2011CR2567 IN THE 186TH DISTRICT COURT\n                              FROM BEXAR COUNTY\n\n\n        Per curiam.\n\n                                            OPINION\n\n        Pursuant to the provisions of Article 11.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the\n\nclerk of the trial court transmitted to this Court this application for a writ of habeas corpus. Ex parte\n\nYoung, 418 S.W.2d 824, 826 (Tex. Crim. App. 1967). Applicant was convicted of intoxication\n\nmanslaughter and sentenced to forty-five years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\n        Applicant contends that her counsel rendered ineffective assistance because he failed to\n\ntimely file a notice of appeal.\n\n        The trial court has determined that counsel failed to timely file a notice of appeal. We find\n\nthat Applicant is entitled to the opportunity to file an out-of-time appeal of the judgment of\n\f                                                                                                        2\n\nconviction in Cause No. 2011CR2567 from the 186th District Court of Bexar County. Applicant is\n\nordered returned to that time at which she may give a written notice of appeal so that she may then,\n\nwith the aid of counsel, obtain a meaningful appeal. Within ten days of the issuance of this opinion,\n\nthe trial court shall determine whether Applicant is indigent. If Applicant is indigent and wishes to\n\nbe represented by counsel, the trial court shall immediately appoint an attorney to represent\n\nApplicant on direct appeal. All time limits shall be calculated as if the sentence had been imposed\n\non the date on which the mandate of this Court issues. We hold that, should Applicant desire to\n\nprosecute an appeal, she must take affirmative steps to file a written notice of appeal in the trial court\n\nwithin 30 days after the mandate of this Court issues.\n\n        Copies of this opinion shall be sent to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice-Correctional\n\nInstitutions Division and Pardons and Paroles Division.\n\n\n\nDelivered: September 24, 2014\nDo not publish\n\f",
