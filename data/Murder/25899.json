WR-48,121-03\n\n\n                          EX PARTE KEVIN W. DICKSON, Applicant\n\n\n             ON APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\n      CAUSE NO. W12-57075-K(A) IN THE CRIMINAL DISTRICT COURT NO. 4\n                          FROM DALLAS COUNTY\n\n\n        Per curiam.\n\n                                              ORDER\n\n        Pursuant to the provisions of Article 11.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the\n\nclerk of the trial court transmitted to this Court this application for a writ of habeas corpus. Ex parte\n\nYoung, 418 S.W.2d 824, 826 (Tex. Crim. App. 1967). Applicant was convicted of murder and\n\nsentenced to life imprisonment. The Fifth Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction. Dickson v.\n\nState, No. 05-14-01061-CR (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas Feb. 29. 2016)(not designated for publication).\n\n        Applicant contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance because counsel\n\nfailed to move to suppress the evidence seized as a result of his arrest. The trial court has made\n\nfindings of facts and conclusions of law and recommends that relief be denied. In the findings, the\n\ntrial court noted that counsel provided the court with an affidavit addressing Applicant\u2019s allegations.\n\f                                                                                                        2\n\nHowever, the District Clerk has not forwarded counsel\u2019s affidavit to this Court.\n\n         Therefore, the District Clerk of Dallas County is ordered to obtain a copy of counsel\u2019s\n\naffidavit, and to transmit it to this Court. This application will be held in abeyance until the affidavit\n\nhas been received by this Court. A supplemental transcript containing all affidavits and the\n\ntranscription of the court reporter\u2019s notes from any hearing or deposition shall be forwarded to this\n\nCourt within 30 days of the date of this order. Any extensions of time shall be obtained from this\n\nCourt.\n\n\n\nFiled: December 20, 2017\nDo not publish\n\f",
