See In re Muhamed Ahmed Hirsi,\nNo. A 209 416 861 (B.I.A. Nov. 20, 2017), aff\u2019g No. A 209 416 861 (Immig. Ct. Batavia June 20,\n2017). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case,\nand issues on appeal.\n\n        On May 11, 2020, the parties filed a \u201cJoint Stipulation Pursuant to FRAP 42(b) and Request\nfor Remand.\u201d On review of the parties\u2019 joint filing and the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions, we approve\nthe parties\u2019 stipulation of dismissal and agree that a remand to the BIA is appropriate in the\ncircumstances presented.\n\n       On remand, the BIA shall consider:\n\n       (1) whether any newly obtained documents corroborate Hirsi\u2019s claims;\n\n       (2) whether the case should be remanded to the IJ to make further findings on Hirsi\u2019s claims\n           for asylum, withholding or removal, and protection from removal under the CAT, taking\n           into account any newly obtained documents and the following issues that we have\n           identified in our review of the IJ and BIA\u2019s decisions:\n\n               a. whether the evidence in the record (including, the sworn affidavit from Hirsi\u2019s\n                  neighbor) showing Hirsi\u2019s alleged forced eviction, his mother\u2019s murder, and other\n                  alleged incidents of harm that Hirsi suffered personally (e.g., a beating by\n                  members of a majority clan that rendered him unconscious), in combination,\n                  gives rise to a valid persecution claim. See Poradisova v. Gonzales, 420 28 F.3d 70,\n                  79\u201380 (2d Cir. 2005);\n\n               b. whether any corroborating evidence that was found missing\u2014such as a death\n                  certificate for Hirsi\u2019s mother\u2014was reasonably available, notwithstanding\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f                   evidence that death certificates are only issued and available in certain areas of\n                   Somalia. See 8 U.S.C. 18 \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii);\n\n               c. whether the IJ\u2019s corroboration finding was correctly treated as an alternative\n                  basis for denying relief, rather than part of the finding that Hirsi had not\n                  established past persecution;\n\n               d. whether al-Shabaab\u2019s violent attack on the mosque where Hirsi was praying\n                  could constitute persecution of Hirsi, in light of any pattern or practice of\n                  persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to Hirsi on account of his\n                  race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n                  opinion. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1), (b)(2)(iii);\n\n               e. whether the IJ\u2019s findings that Hirsi did not suffer persecution properly\n                  considered each distinct protected ground asserted in Hirsi\u2019s applications\u2014such\n                  as, persecution on account of his religion and of his tribal affiliation. See 8 U.S.C.\n                  \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i);\n\n               f. whether Hirsi\u2019s return to Somalia after living in a refugee camp in Kenya from\n                  2008 to 2009 undercuts his claims of past persecution, notwithstanding Hirsi\u2019s\n                  testimony that: (i) his mother sent him to Kenya to avoid military battles in\n                  Mogadishu, but called him back when members of a different tribe began killing\n                  the refugees; and (ii) Hirsi\u2019s short stay at the refugee camp preceded the most\n                  significant incidents of past harm that Hirsi allegedly experienced in Somalia.\n\n               g. whether Hirsi properly established a CAT claim by showing that he would face\n                  torture as a member of his tribe, in light of the evidence in the record that,\n                  among other things, the Somali government knowingly acquiesces in such\n                  torture.\n\n       (3) any other issue stipulated to by the parties in their \u201cJoint Stipulation and Request for\n           Remand.\u201d\n\n        We intimate no view on the ultimate findings by the agency, including such credibility\nfindings as may be appropriate in the normal course of renewed fact-finding upon remand.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f                                      CONCLUSION\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, the Joint Stipulation and Request for Remand is GRANTED,\nand the cause REMANDED to the Board of Immigration Appeals for further proceedings\nconsistent with this order.\n\n\n                                                  FOR THE COURT:\n                                                  Catherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe, Clerk of Court\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f",
