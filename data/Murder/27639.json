GERROD CRAWFORD v. THE STATE.\n\n      A jury found Gerrod Crawford guilty of felony murder and various other\noffenses, and the trial court sentenced Crawford to life in prison. Crawford filed a\nmotion for new trial, which the trial court denied. Crawford then filed this appeal. We\nlack jurisdiction.\n      The Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over \u201c[a]ll cases in which a\nsentence of death was imposed or could be imposed.\u201d Ga. Const. of 1983, Art. VI,\nSec. VI, Par. III (8). Because a penalty of death may be imposed for the crime of\nfelony murder, jurisdiction is proper in the Supreme Court. See OCGA \u00a7 16-5-1 (c),\n(e) (1); Neal v. State, 290 Ga. 563, 572 (722 SE2d 765) (2012) (Hunstein, C. J.,\nconcurring); see also State v. Thornton, 253 Ga. 524, 524 (1) (322 SE2d 711) (1984)\n(directing this Court to transfer to the Supreme Court \u201call cases in which either a\nsentence of death or of life imprisonment has been imposed upon conviction of\nmurder\u201d).\n      Accordingly, Crawford\u2019s appeal is hereby TRANSFERRED to the Supreme\nCourt for disposition.\n\fCourt of Appeals of the State of Georgia\n       Clerk\u2019s Office, Atlanta,____________________\n                                 12/22/2020\n       I certify that the above is a true extract from\nthe minutes of the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\n       Witness my signature and the seal of said court\nhereto affixed the day and year last above written.\n\n\n                                                , Clerk.\n\f",
