Perry, appellant pro se.\n\n           Gurbir S. Grewal, Attorney General, attorney for\n           respondent (Melissa Dutton Schaffer, Assistant\n           Attorney General, of counsel; Erica R. Heyer, Deputy\n           Attorney General, on the brief).\n\n     The opinion of the court was delivered by\n\nMAWLA, J.A.D.\n\n     Appellant Stephen D. Perry has a lengthy criminal history. In addition\n\nto other sentences, he is serving a life sentence. Although Perry has been\n\fparole eligible, he has incurred infractions during his incarceration which\n\nresulted in the New Jersey State Parole Board (Board) imposing a 240-month\n\nfuture eligibility term (FET), outside of the twenty-seven-month presumptive\n\nFET, which Perry now challenges.\n\n      We hold the Board used the incorrect standard to determine Perry's\n\nparole eligibility because it retroactively applied the amended version of\n\nN.J.S.A. 30:4-123.56, which became effective in 1997.         Accordingly, we\n\nreverse and remand the Board's May 31, 2017 decision for reconsideration\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n      We take the following facts from the record. In January 1979, Perry and\n\ntwo other individuals broke into a Bergen County residence and stole a stereo,\n\na rifle, and jewelry. Police encountered the trio and when ordered to stop, they\n\nfled. During the pursuit, Perry began shooting at the officers, striking one in\n\nthe wrist and chest.     Officers returned fire, striking Perry twice in the\n\nabdomen. Police apprehended Perry, who had jewelry from the residence in\n\nhis possession.\n\n      Officers transported Perry to the hospital, restrained him in a hospital\n\nbed, and posted a sheriff's officer as a guard. The officer loosened Perry's\n\nrestraints only to permit him to use the restroom. At night, during trips to the\n\nrestroom, Perry managed to gradually loosen the top of his metal intravenous\n\n\n\n                                                                        A-1338-17T4\n                                       2\n\fstand. In the morning, Perry attacked the officer with the stand and disarmed\n\nhim. He shot and killed the officer before fleeing.\n\n      Perry was also indicted for various offenses which occurred before the\n\nmurder.    He was found guilty and sentenced in September 1979, to an\n\naggregated term of twenty to twenty-five years of incarceration for breaking\n\nand entering with intent to steal, larceny, carrying a concealed weapon,\n\npossession of a weapon, assault with intent to kill, being armed, assault with a\n\ndangerous weapon, and assault and battery on a police officer. Following\n\nthese convictions, Perry was indicted for the officer's murder and pled guilty to\n\nthe offense. In October 1979, he was sentenced to life in prison to be served\n\nconsecutive to his first indictment.\n\n      Perry was indicted five more times for crimes committed in August\n\n(two), September, October, and November 1978. In 1980, he was sentenced to\n\nthe following: concurrent three to five years imprisonment for attempted\n\nbreaking and entering and carrying a concealed weapon, to be served\n\nconcurrently with his other sentences; concurrent five to seven years\n\nimprisonment for assault and battery of a police officer; concurrent five to ten\n\nyears imprisonment for possession of a stolen motor vehicle, larceny, and utter\n\nforged check; a concurrent term of four to eight years imprisonment for\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         A-1338-17T4\n                                       3\n\fforging a check and obtaining money by false pretenses; and a concurrent term\n\nof six to ten years imprisonment for breaking and entering and larceny.\n\n      In 2001, Perry was indicted for possession of a controlled dangerous\n\nsubstance (CDS), possession with intent to distribute, and distribution of a\n\nCDS for distributing a packet of heroin to a fellow inmate. In 2003, he pled\n\nguilty to the offenses and was sentenced to a four-year prison term consecutive\n\nto the sentences he was serving under the 1979 convictions, with a one -year\n\nmandatory-minimum.\n\n      Perry also had a history of parole and probation violations related to\n\narrests, which occurred prior to the murder. In August 1976, his parole was\n\nrevoked for parole violations.      Perry was sentenced to 364 days of\n\nincarceration, which was converted to probation, conditioned on his\n\ncompletion of an inpatient drug program. However, he escaped custody, was\n\nre-apprehended, and sentenced to complete the original term of incarceration.\n\nAfterwards, Perry was released on parole, which was again revoked in\n\nFebruary 1979, following the murder and additional offenses we noted.\n\n      In 1997, Perry became eligible for parole on the murder sentence. He\n\nwas denied parole and the Board established a fifteen-year FET. Perry became\n\nparole eligible for a second time in 2010, and the Board established a three -\n\nyear FET. When he became eligible for parole for a third time in June 201 3, a\n\n\n\n                                                                          A-1338-17T4\n                                       4\n\ftwo-member panel denied parole and referred his case to a three-member panel\n\nto establish an FET outside of the guidelines.\n\n      The two-member panel noted Perry's prior criminal record, the\n\nincreasing severity of his crimes, his multiple convictions, and the fact he had\n\npreviously violated the conditions of his probation and parole by committing\n\nadditional offenses.     The panel also noted Perry had committed several\n\ninstitutional infractions since the last parole hearing, including two since that\n\nhearing, and displayed insufficient problem resolution.       The panel found\n\nmitigating factors, including that Perry had participated in programs specific to\n\nhis behavioral deficiencies and other institutional programs, had obtained\n\naverage to above average institutional reports, attempted to enroll and\n\nparticipate in other programs, and had his commutation time restored.\n\n      However, the panel concluded incarceration had not deterred Perry's\n\ncriminality, he lacked insight into his behavior, and continued to minimize th e\n\nnature of his conduct:\n\n                   [Perry] appears to be unable or unwilling to\n            accept responsibility for the first shooting of a police\n            officer [claiming it was a co-defendant] and regarding\n            his murder offense of a police officer, [Perry] also\n            deflects blame by implying that the officer was drunk\n            and was instigating trouble because he held a previous\n            grudge and that \"in the course of the struggle he got\n            shot.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         A-1338-17T4\n                                       5\n\fThe panel also concluded Perry minimized his institutional infractions and the\n\n2001 CDS offenses.\n\n      A three-member panel considered Perry's case and established a 240-\n\nmonth FET. The panel explained its reasoning in a May 28, 2014 written\n\ndecision. It based its determination on the same factors relied upon by the\n\ntwo-member panel. Perry appealed the decisions to the full Board.\n\n      For reasons that are temporally irrelevant to this appeal, the Board\n\nissued a final decision on May 31, 2017, affirming the three-member panel and\n\nfinding it had considered the record and explained its reasoning. In pertinent\n\npart, the Board concluded\n\n            each term of imprisonment has a separate parole\n            eligibility term and . . . pursuant to N.J.S.A. 30:4-\n            123.51(h), when an inmate is sentenced to more than\n            one term of imprisonment, the Board is required to\n            aggregate the parole eligibility term derived from each\n            term for the purpose of determining the primary parole\n            eligibility date.\n\n      The Board noted Perry was serving a life sentence imposed in 1979 and\n\na consecutive four-year-term of incarceration imposed in 2003. It found the\n\nthree-member panel properly applied the post-1997 amendment standard for\n\nparole fitness because the consecutive four-year-term had not been served.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n      Perry raises the following points on appeal:\n\n\n\n                                                                      A-1338-17T4\n                                       6\n\fI.

Super. 513,\n            519 (App. Div. 2019).]\n\n      Perry argues that since the sentence he is currently serving is for a crime\n\nhe committed prior to the 1997 amendment to N.J.S.A. 30:4-123.56, the Board\n\nimproperly used the 1997 amendment standard when it should have used the\n\npre-amendment standard.      Because the Board applied the incorrect parole\n\neligibility standard, we remand the matter. We do not address the balance of\n\nPerry's arguments.\n\n                                       II.\n\n      Parole for a conviction imposed on offenses committed before August\n\n18, 1997, \"is governed by the standard[s] in N.J.S.A. 30:4-123.53(a) and 30:4-\n\n123.56(c) prior to the amendment of those statutes on that date.\" Williams v.\n\nN.J. State Parole Bd., 336 N.J. Super. 1, 7 (App. Div. 2000) (citing N.J.A.C.\n\n10A:71-3.10). The pre-amendment statute provides \"the Parole Board may\n\ndeny parole release if it appears from a preponderance of the evidence that\n\n'there is a substantial likelihood that the inmate will commit a crime under the\n\n\n\n                                                                        A-1338-17T4\n                                       10\n\flaws of this State if released on parole at such time.'\" Ibid. (quoting L. 1979,\n\nc. 441, \u00a7 9). For offenses committed after August 18, 1997, the Board may\n\ndeny parole where it appears \"by a preponderance of the evidence . . . the\n\ninmate has failed to cooperate in his or her own rehabilitation or that there is a\n\nreasonable expectation that the inmate will violate conditions of parole . . . if\n\nreleased on parole at that time.\" N.J.S.A. 30:4-123.53(a).\n\n      N.J.S.A. 30:4-123.51(h) states where \"an inmate is sentenced to more\n\nthan one term of imprisonment, the primary parole eligibility terms calculated\n\npursuant to this section shall be aggregated by the [B]oard for the purpose of\n\ndetermining the primary parole eligibility date, except that no juvenile\n\ncommitment shall be aggregated with any adult sentence.\" N.J.A.C. 10A:71-\n\n3.2(d) promulgates the rules for the aggregation of consecutive sentences and\n\nstates: \"When a consecutive term is imposed, the parole eligibility term\n\nderived from the consecutive term, less county jail credits, shall be added to\n\nthe parole eligibility term derived from the original term, less county jail\n\ncredits, to determine the aggregate parole eligibility term.\" Aggregation is a\n\n\"mechanical function\" performed by the Board. Curry v. N.J. State Parole Bd.,\n\n309 N.J. Super. 66, 71 (App. Div. 1998).\n\n      N.J.A.C. 10A:71-3.2 does not address the issue of which standard of\n\nparole eligibility applies where the Board must aggregate a pre- and post-\n\n\n\n                                                                         A-1338-17T4\n                                       11\n\famendment sentence.         It promulgates rules regarding a mechanical\n\ndetermination, namely, the consideration of the length of an inmate's separate\n\nsentences. Therefore, we must determine whether N.J.S.A. 30:4-123.53 may\n\nbe applied retroactively.\n\n      We recently stated:\n\n                  As a general principle, in criminal as well as\n            other statutes, \"the law favors prospective, rather than\n            retroactive, application of new legislation unless a\n            recognized exception applies.\" Ardan v.

Parolin, 171 N.J. 223, 233 (2002). . . .\n            \"Courts must apply a two-part test to determine\n            whether a statute should be applied retroactively: (1)\n            whether the Legislature intended to give the statute\n            retroactive application; and [if so] (2) whether\n            retroactive application 'will result in either an\n            unconstitutional interference with vested rights or a\n            manifest injustice.'\" Ardan v. Bd. of Review, 444 N.J.\n            Super. at 587 (quoting James v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co.,\n            216 N.J. 552, 563 (2014)).\n\n                   Under the first part of the test enunciated in\n            James, the presumption against retroactivity \"can be\n            overcome by an indication of contrary legislative\n            intent, either expressed in the language of the statute\n            itself, or implied in its purpose.\" See State v. Bey,\n            112 N.J. 45, 103 (1988). When an appellate court\n            finds that retroactive legislative intent exists, it is\n            well-established that the court must \"apply the statute\n            in effect at the time of its decision . . . to effectuate the\n            current policy declared by the legislative body.\" Ibid.\n            (quoting Kruvant v. Mayor & Council of Twp. of\n            Cedar Grove, 82 N.J. 435, 440 (1980)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            A-1338-17T4\n                                         12\n\f                   Within the first part of the test, three exceptions\n            to the general rule of prospective application are well-\n            established: (1) when the Legislature intended\n            retroactive application of the statute either expressly,\n            as \"stated in the language of the statute or in the\n            pertinent legislative history,\" or implicitly, requiring\n            retroactive application to \"make the statute workable\n            or to give it the most sensible interpretation\"; (2)\n            when the statute is \"ameliorative or curative\"; or (3)\n            when the \"expectations of the parties may warrant\n            retroactive application.\" Gibbons v. Gibbons, 86 N.J.\n            515, 522-23 (1981). \"Under the second exception to\n            the general rule, the term 'ameliorative' refers only to\n            criminal laws that effect a reduction in a criminal\n            penalty.\" Street v. Universal Mar., 300 N.J. Super.\n            578, 582 (App. Div. 1997) (quoting Kendall v.\n            Snedeker, 219 N.J. Super. 283, 286 (App. Div. 1987)).\n\n            [State in Interest of J.F., 446 N.J. Super. 39, 53-54\n            (App. Div. 2016).]\n\n      The relative amended language of N.J.S.A. 30:4-123.56 became\n\neffective August 18, 1997.     Our review of the statute's legislative history\n\nreveals no evidence of an express or implied intent to apply it retroactively.\n\nMoreover, retroactive application would work to apply a different and an\n\narguably higher standard for determining Perry's parole eligibility.\n\n      Indeed, the standard prior to the 1997 codification of N.J.S.A. 30:4 -\n\n123.56 permitted the Board to deny parole if it found by \"a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence 'there is a substantial likelihood that the inmate will commit a\n\ncrime under the laws of this State if released on parole at such time.'\"\n\nWilliams, 336 N.J. Super. at 7 (quoting L. 1979, c. 441, \u00a7 9). The 1997\n\n                                                                         A-1338-17T4\n                                       13\n\fcodification eliminated the \"substantial likelihood\" requirement and broadened\n\nthe Board's consideration to not only the commission of another crime by the\n\nparolee, but release can be denied if the \"inmate has failed to cooperate in his\n\nor her own rehabilitation or that there is a reasonable expectation that the\n\ninmate will violate conditions of parole . . . if released on parole[.]\" N.J.S.A.\n\n30:4-123.56.     The current statute effectively broadens both the overall\n\ndiscretion of the Board to deny parole and the reasons for the denial of parole.\n\n      Thus, the legislative revisions of N.J.S.A. 30:4-123.56 had neither an\n\nameliorative nor a curative function.       Therefore, it cannot be said the\n\n\"expectations of the parties . . . warrant[ed] retroactive application.\" J.F., 446\n\nN.J. Super. at 54.\n\n      For these reasons, we hold the post-1997 amendment language of\n\nN.J.S.A. 30:4-123.56 has no applicability to parole determinations for inmates\n\neligible for parole who are serving sentences entered prior to August 18, 1997.\n\nThe Board must determine parole eligibility for such inmates by considering\n\nwhether there is, by a preponderance of the evidence, a substantial likelihood\n\nthe inmate will commit a crime if released on parole pursuant to N.J.S.A. 30:4-\n\n123.56 (1979).\n\n      Finally, the FET imposed here was quite substantial. The Board relied\n\nupon Perry's rationalizations of his past offenses and conduct during his\n\n\n\n                                                                         A-1338-17T4\n                                       14\n\fincarceration to support an FET beyond the presumptive duration. However,\n\non remand, the Board must correlate its findings with the length of the FET\n\nimposed, as the sentence for the 2001 offense, which drew the lengthy FET,\n\nwas just four years.\n\n      Reversed and remanded. We do not retain jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   A-1338-17T4\n                                     15\n\f",
