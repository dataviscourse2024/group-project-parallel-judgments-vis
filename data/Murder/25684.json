A defendant seeking to disqualify a\n     judge on the basis of bias or prejudice bears the heavy burden of over-\n     coming the presumption of judicial impartiality.\n11.\t Judges: Recusal. In evaluating a trial judge\u2019s alleged bias, the question\n     is whether a reasonable person who knew the circumstances of the case\n     would question the judge\u2019s impartiality under an objective standard of\n     reasonableness, even though no actual bias or prejudice was shown.\n12.\t ____: ____.

Judicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis\n     for a bias or partiality motion directed to a trial judge.\n14.\t Judges: Recusal: Waiver. A party is said to have waived his or her right\n     to obtain a judge\u2019s disqualification when the alleged basis for the dis-\n     qualification has been known to the party for some time, but the objec-\n     tion is raised well after the judge has participated in the proceedings.\n15.\t Judges: Recusal: Appeal and Error.

BUTTERCASE\n                        Cite as 296 Neb. 304\n\n   Buttercase contends that he was denied his right to the\nreturn of certain personal property, in violation of Neb. Rev.\nStat. \u00a7 29-818 (Reissue 2016). The district court denied the\nmotion. Buttercase appeals. We affirm.\n                        BACKGROUND\n   Following a jury trial, Buttercase was convicted in the Gage\nCounty District Court of first degree sexual assault, first degree\nfalse imprisonment, strangulation, and third degree domes-\ntic assault. Buttercase appealed, and in case No. A-12-1167,\nin an unpublished memorandum opinion dated November 5,\n2013, the Nebraska Court of Appeals affirmed his convictions\nand sentences.\n   On December 9, 2015, Buttercase filed a motion for return\nof seized property. In his motion, Buttercase requested the\nreturn of the following:\n      1. One black leather couch cushion;\n      2. One brown and white striped fitted sheet;\n      3. One white mattress pad;\n      4. One Sony Camcorder;\n      5. One camera tripod;\n      6. One pair of Flypaper blue jeans;\n      7. One pair of blue Fruit of the Loom underwear;\n      8.

One Brass pipe (Brand new, still in package);\n      17. 3-page note from T. Fulton to J. Buttercase.\n   On January 20, 2016, the district court held a hearing\non Buttercase\u2019s motion to return property. Buttercase, acting\n\f                                     - 307 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        296 Nebraska R eports\n                             STATE v. BUTTERCASE\n                               Cite as 296 Neb. 304\n\npro se, appeared telephonically. At the hearing, the State\nargued that at that time, Buttercase had a pending postcon-\nviction motion and a pending federal prosecution for child\npornography and that \u201cmany of the items that he pled in his\nmotion are subject to that case.\u201d The State further argued that\n\u201cuntil there\u2019s a final disposition in this matter in both the fed-\neral case and the state case that\u2019s on appeal, that none of the\nproperty items should be returned.\u201d The district court denied\nButtercase\u2019s motion to return property, stating at the hear-\ning that\n      at least some of the property listed here might be neces-\n      sary for the federal prosecution or the other postconvic-\n      tion matter depending on the outcome of that, and rather\n      than try to parse through the different items of property\n      and determine what may or may not be needed at this\n      time, it would be premature to release property. So I will\n      deny the Motion for Return of Seized Property, because it\n      may be necessary for those other matters.\n                 ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Buttercase assigns that the district court erred in dismissing\nhis motion for return of seized property because (1) the pend-\ning federal prosecution and postconviction proceedings do not\nqualify as pending trials, (2) the State was required to deter-\nmine what portion of the seized evidence would be necessary\nfor the pending proceedings and return the portion that would\nnot be necessary, and (3) the court was biased against him.\n                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1,2] The denial of a motion for return of seized property\nis reviewed for an abuse of discretion.1 An abuse of discretion\ntakes place when the sentencing court\u2019s reasons or rulings are\nclearly untenable and unfairly deprive a litigant of a substan-\ntial right and a just result.2\n\n\u20021\t\n      State v.

Agee,11 this court found that the district court\nerred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for return of property\nafter the defendant\u2019s theft charge was dismissed, and that the\nState did not meet its burden of proving it had a legitimate\nreason to retain the property. The State claimed that the prop-\nerty did not belong to the defendant and that it had been stolen\nby him. This court found that no evidence had been adduced\nat trial as to whether the seized items were stolen property;\nrather, without evidentiary support, the district court based\nits ruling solely on representations made by the State that the\nproperty was stolen.12 We noted that\n\n\u20027\t\n      State v.

Thus,\n      a motion for the return of property is properly denied\n      only if the claimant is not entitled to lawful possession\n      of the property, the property is contraband or subject to\n      forfeiture, or the government has some other continuing\n      interest in the property.13\n   This court further stated that the burden of proof was on the\n\u201cgovernment to show that it has a legitimate reason to retain\nthe property.\u201d14 And, \u201c[t]he State must do more than assert,\nwithout evidentiary support, that the property was stolen, or is\nnot in the State\u2019s possession.\u201d15 Therefore, this court held that\nthe State did not meet that burden because it failed to present\nevidence of \u201cany of the other grounds that have been used\nto justify the government\u2019s retention of property, such as an\nongoing investigation, a tax lien, an imposed fine, or an order\nof restitution.\u201d16\n   Also relevant is State v. Dubray,17 in which the Court\nof Appeals applied the reasoning in Agee and found that\nonce criminal proceedings against the defendant were con-\ncluded, he was presumptively entitled to the return of property\nseized from him.

When a prisoner files a motion\nfor postconviction relief, the court must determine whether\nthe prisoner \u201chas the right to be released on the ground that\nthere was such a denial or infringement of the rights of the\nprisoner as to render the judgment void or voidable under the\nConstitution of this state or the Constitution of the United\nStates.\u201d23 If, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, the court\nfinds such a denial or infringement, \u201cthe court shall vacate\nand set aside the judgment and shall discharge the prisoner\nor resentence the prisoner or grant a new trial as may appear\nappropriate.\u201d24 Accordingly, postconviction proceedings pro-\nvide an evidentiary hearing for the court to determine whether\nthere has been a \u201cdenial or infringement\u201d of his or her rights,\nand whether the court should \u201cgrant a new trial.\u201d For these\npurposes, the State may have a continuing need to retain\nthe evidence in the course of postconviction proceedings.\nPostconviction proceedings are the equivalent of a \u201ctrial\u201d for\npurposes of \u00a7 29-818.\n   In addition, at the time this motion was filed, Buttercase\nremained subject to a pending federal criminal child pornogra-\nphy case.

Under these facts, we cannot say that the district court\nabused its discretion in denying Buttercase\u2019s motion to return\nseized property.\n          Whether State Was R equired to Determine\n           Portion of Seized Evidence R equired for\n                Pending Proceedings and R eturn\n                     Portion Not R equired\n   Buttercase argues, without citation to any relevant author-\nity, that the district court must determine what property is\nneeded for his pending federal prosecution or postconviction\nproceedings and return any evidence that is not needed for\nprosecution.\n   Under \u00a7 29-818, when a complaint has been filed, the State\nmust only show that the property \u201cmay be used as evidence.\u201d\nHere, the district court found that there was such a possibil-\nity. The district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to\nparse through the property to determine what evidence would\nbe used in the other pending proceedings and what should be\nreturned to Buttercase.\n                   Buttercase\u2019s Contentions\n                         of Judge\u2019s Bias\n   Finally, we address Buttercase\u2019s contention that the district\ncourt denied his motion because the court was biased against\nhim. Buttercase points to the following as evidence of this\nbias: (1) The court denied Buttercase\u2019s postconviction motion\nwithout granting an evidentiary hearing, (2) the court denied a\nnew trial wherein newly discovered evidence would have made\nthe result different, (3) the court denied Buttercase\u2019s motion\n\n25\t\n      See \u00a7 29-818.\n\f                                   - 314 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       296 Nebraska R eports\n                            STATE v.

And each of Buttercase\u2019s\nallegations was known to him prior to the hearing.\n   As noted above, at the hearing, the State cited the pending\nfederal case and the motion for postconviction relief currently\npending in this court. The judge then asked Buttercase, \u201c[I]s\nthere anything further you would like to state?\u201d Buttercase\ndid not dispute the State\u2019s assertion of his pending proceed-\nings in state and federal court, nor did he dispute that some\nof the evidence may be needed for those proceedings. After\nthe court denied Buttercase\u2019s motion, the judge again asked,\n\u201cAnything else that anybody wants to bring up at this point?\u201d\nOnce again, Buttercase failed to make any of his judicial\nbias arguments.\n   Despite several opportunities, Buttercase failed to raise any\nallegation of bias at any point during the hearing. Thus, we\nfind that Buttercase failed to raise these issues at the earliest\n\n33\t\n      Young v. Govier & Milone, supra note 3.\n34\t\n      Tierney v.

As we have previously held, the fact that\nthe district court socialized with another member of the bar is\ninsufficient to show bias, as is the fact that the court previously\npresided over other actions involving the parties and made\nrulings against one or another of the parties. The possibility\nthat the judge and the State\u2019s attorney knew each other and\nplayed golf together \u201cdoes not, by itself, create the appearance\nof impropriety.\u201d37 Buttercase also contends that the statement\nin the victim\u2019s social media message that the judge \u201c\u2018likes\u2019\u201d38\nher is evidence of bias. Assuming such a message is admissible\nevidence, without further substantive support no reasonable\nperson would question the judge\u2019s impartiality under an objec-\ntive standard of reasonableness based on the claimed social\nmedia message.\n   Even considered collectively, these allegations are insuffi-\ncient to show bias. We find that a reasonable person who knew\nthe circumstances of the case would not question the judge\u2019s\nimpartiality under an objective standard of reasonableness.\nTherefore, Buttercase\u2019s arguments that the district court judge\nwas biased are without merit.\n                        CONCLUSION\n  The district court did not err in dismissing Buttercase\u2019s\nmotion for return of seized property. Accordingly, we affirm.\n                                                    A ffirmed.\n\n37\t\n      See State v.
