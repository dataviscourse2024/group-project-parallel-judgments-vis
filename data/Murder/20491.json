Transp.\r\nCode Ann. \u00a7\u00a0550.021 (Vernon 1999).\u00a0\r\nIn two issues, appellant claims her conviction for felony murder cannot\r\nstand because the statute is ambiguous as to whether FSRA is a felony or\r\nmisdemeanor.[1]\u00a0 In her first issue, appellant contends that\r\nsince the statute is ambiguous, under the Rule of Lenity,[2]\r\nwe must conclude that FSRA is a misdemeanor and therefore incapable of\r\nsupporting a felony murder conviction.\u00a0\r\nIn her second issue, appellant argues that because of this ambiguity, a\r\nfelony murder conviction based on FSRA violates due process.\u00a0 We affirm.\r\n\r\nThe Transportation Code provides that a\r\nconviction for FSRA is punishable by\r\n\r\n(1) imprisonment\r\nin the institutional division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice for\r\nnot more than five years or confinement in the county jail for not more than\r\none year;\r\n\r\n(2) a fine not to\r\nexceed more than $5,000; or\r\n\r\n(3) both the fine\r\nand the imprisonment or confinement. \r\n\r\nTex. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7\r\n550.021(c).\u00a0 Under the Penal Code, a\r\nfelony is defined as \u201can offense so designated by law or punishable by death or\r\nconfinement in a penitentiary,\u201d and a misdemeanor is defined as \u201can offense so\r\ndesignated by law or punishable by fine, by confinement in jail, or by both\r\nfine and confinement in jail.\u201d\u00a0 Tex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a01.07(a)(23),\r\n(31) (Vernon Supp. 2004\u20132005).\u00a0 Appellant\r\nargues that since the punishment range provided in the Transportation Code\r\nincludes both felony\u2011type (imprisonment) and misdemeanor\u2011type (fine\r\nand/or jail) punishment, the statute is ambiguous.\u00a0 We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Court of Appeals addressed a\r\nchallenge to the FSRA statute based on this same theory in Schmidt v. State,\r\n778 S.W.2d 549 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, pet. ref\u2019d).\u00a0 The court concluded that FSRA is a felony\r\noffense, \u201ceven though the accused may receive punishment other than\r\npenitentiary confinement.\u201d\u00a0 Id. at\r\n551.\u00a0 Though the punishment provisions of\r\nthe FSRA statute provide the option of a fine, confinement in jail, or\r\nimprisonment, that merely provides a minimum and maximum range of\r\npunishment.\u00a0 Id. at 552.\u00a0 If punishment by imprisonment is a\r\npossibility, then the offense is a felony, even if other punishment options are\r\navailable. \u00a0Id.; see also Lloyd\r\nv. State, 704 S.W.2d 67, 68 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi 1985, no pet.)\r\n(\u201cBecause the offense with which appellant was charged was potentially\r\npunishable by confinement in a penitentiary, it is classified as a felony.\u201d); cf.\r\nChildress v. State, 784 S.W.2d 361, 365\u201366 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990) (holding\r\nthat FSRA is a third degree felony for enhancement purposes because \u201cthe\r\noffense carries penitentiary time as a possible punishment\u201d).\r\n\r\nWe agree with this analysis and conclude\r\nthat since imprisonment is a possible punishment, FSRA is unambiguously a\r\nfelony.\u00a0 Thus, using FSRA as the\r\nunderlying offense for a felony murder conviction does not implicate the Rule\r\nof Lenity or violate due process on the basis that the statute is ambiguous.\u00a0 We overrule appellant\u2019s first and second issues\r\nand affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n/s/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leslie Brock Yates\r\n\r\nJustice\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nJudgment\r\nrendered and Memorandum Opinion filed April 7, 2005.\r\n\r\nPanel consists\r\nof Justices Yates, Anderson, and Hudson.\r\n\r\nDo Not Publish\r\n\u2014 Tex. R. App. P. 47.2(b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]\u00a0 The State\r\nargues that appellant has waived error because she failed to file a motion to\r\nquash the indictment as required by Tex.\r\nCode Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.14(b)\r\n(Vernon Supp. 2004\u20132005) (\u201cIf the defendant does not object to a defect, error,\r\nor irregularity of form or substance in an indictment or information before the\r\ndate on which the trial on the merits commences, he waives and forfeits the\r\nright to object . . . .\u201d).\u00a0 However,\r\nappellant does not characterize her issues as attacking the indictment, and\r\nthus we reject the State\u2019s argument that appellant has waived error on this\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[2]\u00a0 The Rule of\r\nLenity \u201cembodies \u2018a presupposition of our law to resolve doubts in the\r\nenforcement of a penal code against the imposition of a harsher\r\npunishment.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 Cuellar v. State,\r\n70 S.W.3d 815, 819 n.6 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (quoting Bell v. United States,\r\n349 U.S. 81, 83 (1955)).\u00a0 The Rule of\r\nLenity is a \u201cfactor for a court to consider if, and only if, a statute is\r\nambiguous.\u201d\u00a0 Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
