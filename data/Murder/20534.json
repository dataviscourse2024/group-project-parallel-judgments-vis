Ex parte\r\nYoung, 418 S.W.2d 824, 826 (Tex. Crim. App. 1967).  Applicant was convicted of capital murder\r\nand sentenced to life imprisonment.  The Fifth Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction. Evans v.\r\nState, No. 05-06-00323-CR (Tex. App.\u2013Dallas, delivered July 10, 2007).  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applicant contends that he was denied his right to file a pro se petition for discretionary\r\nreview.  Specifically, he contends that although he timely placed his pro se petition for discretionary\r\nreview in the prison mail system, it was not received by the Fifth Court of Appeals until after the\r\nfiling deadline, and for that reason, was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law, which are supported by the\r\nrecord, that Applicant placed his petition for discretionary review into the prison mail system timely,\r\nbut that his petition was not received by the Court of Appeals until after the filing deadline had\r\npassed. The trial court recommends that relief be granted.  We agree.  Pursuant to this Court\u2019s recent\r\ndecision in Campbell v. State, which extends the \u201cmailbox rule\u201d to incarcerated inmates, Applicant\r\nis entitled to file an out-of-time petition for discretionary review of the judgment of the Fifth Court\r\nof Appeals in Cause No. 05-06-00323-CR that affirmed his conviction in Case No. 06-00009-IQ\r\nfrom the 204th Judicial District Court of Dallas County.   See Campbell v. State, No. PD-1081-09\r\n(Tex. Crim. App., delivered September 22, 2010).  Applicant shall file his petition for discretionary\r\nreview with the Fifth Court of Appeals within 30 days of the date on which this Court\u2019s mandate\r\nissues.\r\n\u00a0\r\nDelivered: October 13, 2010\r\nDo not publish.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
