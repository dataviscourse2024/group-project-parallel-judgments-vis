Factual Background\n\n        The petitioner was charged with one count of premeditated first degree murder, and a trial\nwas held on April 28, 1997. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury was unable to agree on a verdict,\nand a mistrial was declared. A second trial began on August 25, 1997, and the petitioner was\nconvicted of the charged offense. This court affirmed the conviction on direct appeal, and, in doing\nso, outlined the facts underlying the conviction as follows:\n\f                       The evidence at trial established that on September 1, 1996,\n               the [petitioner] shot and killed the victim, Josh Kelley. The evidence\n               indicated that earlier that evening, three young ladies, Tennille,\n               Cassie, and Heather, were driving \u201cup and down\u201d Riverside Drive in\n               Clarksville, Tennessee. They visited a motel where [Michael]\n               Powers, Cassie\u2019s boyfriend, was throwing a party. While in the motel\n               room, Tennille saw the [petitioner] preparing to leave the room, at\n               which point someone handed a gun to him. The [petitioner] then left\n               the party. Shortly thereafter, the three young ladies decided to go\n               cruising on Riverside Drive again. They pulled in the parking lot of\n               Page and Taylor\u2019s Sporting Goods Store to change drivers. As they\n               were changing seats, a young man in the parking lot told them to\n               \u201csuck [his] dick or leave.\u201d The three young ladies left the area and\n               returned to the party at the motel.\n\n                       When they arrived at the motel, the ladies told Mr. Powers\n               about the young man\u2019s comment. At this point, Mr. Powers and the\n               [petitioner], who had returned to the motel, went to the [petitioner\u2019s]\n               car, and the [petitioner] followed the ladies to the parking lot of Page\n               and Taylor\u2019s Sporting Goods Store. According to the [petitioner\u2019s]\n               second statement to the police, upon arrival at the parking lot, the\n               [petitioner] told Mr. Powers to \u201cget the gun from under the passenger\n               seat.\u201d According to at least one witness, when Mr. Powers exited the\n               vehicle, he had a gun in his waistband. The [petitioner] and Mr.\n               Powers then approached a group of teenagers standing in the parking\n               lot. The evidence at trial indicated that Mr. Powers asked which of\n               them had told his girlfriend to \u201csuck [his] dick.\u201d In response, the\n               victim stepped forward and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know you. We don\u2019t\n               know your girlfriend. We didn\u2019t say anything to anybody.\u201d Mr.\n               Powers then pulled the gun from his waistband and pointed it at the\n               victim. According to one witness, the [petitioner] told Mr. Powers to\n               \u201ccap [the victim].\u201d Mr. Powers lowered the gun to his side, at which\n               point the [petitioner] took the gun out of Mr. Powers\u2019 hand. The\n               [petitioner] cocked the gun, pulled the slide back, pointed the gun at\n               the ground in front of the victim\u2019s feet, and fired. The [petitioner]\n               then raised the gun, pointed it at the victim\u2019s chest, and fired. After\n               the shooting, the [petitioner] and Mr. Powers left the scene.\n\nState v. Jeffery Miller, No. 01C01-9801-CC-00029, 1999 WL 398188, at *1 (Tenn. Crim. App. at\nNashville, June 18, 1999). Our supreme court denied permission to appeal.\n\n       Thereafter, the petitioner filed a petition for post-conviction relief, alleging that his trial\ncounsel was ineffective in failing to call his co-defendant, Michael Powers, as a witness in the\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fsecond trial, when Powers testified at the first trial which resulted in a hung jury. Additionally, the\npetitioner alleged that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request the trial court to instruct the\njury on all lesser-included offenses of premeditated first degree murder.\n\n        The petitioner testified at the post-conviction hearing that Powers was called as a State\u2019s\nwitness at the first trial. Against the petitioner\u2019s wishes, trial counsel failed to call Powers as a\nwitness at the petitioner\u2019s second trial. The petitioner acknowledged that he and trial counsel\ndiscussed calling Powers as a witness. Trial counsel informed the petitioner that he did not believe\ncalling Powers as a witness would be in the petitioner\u2019s best interest.\n\n         The petitioner stated that he asked trial counsel to call Powers as a witness at the second trial\nbecause Powers\u2019 version of events was substantially the same as the account given by the petitioner.\nThe petitioner maintained that the testimony of other witnesses at both his first and second trials left\nthe impression that the petitioner got the gun from Powers, fired into the ground at the victim\u2019s feet,\naimed for the victim\u2019s chest, then fired. The petitioner contended that he got the gun from Powers,\nfired into the ground at the victim\u2019s feet, and as he turned to run, and the gun accidentally fired. The\npetitioner conceded that at the first trial, Powers testified that the petitioner shot the ground then shot\nthe victim, but failed to mention that the second shot was accidental. The petitioner also conceded\nthat several witnesses at the second trial testified that the petitioner shot the ground then shot the\nvictim. This testimony was substantially similar to Powers\u2019 testimony at the petitioner\u2019s first trial.\n\n        The petitioner further complained that at the second trial, trial counsel failed to request\ninstructions on any lesser-included offenses.\n\n       Michael Powers testified at the post-conviction hearing that he was serving sentences for\nreckless homicide and aggravated assault based upon the same facts underlying the petitioner\u2019s\nconviction for first degree murder.1 Powers was originally convicted of second degree murder;\nhowever, his conviction was reversed on appeal due to the trial court\u2019s failure to charge all lesser-\nincluded offenses.\n\n        Powers stated that he was available to testify at the petitioner\u2019s second trial, but he was not\ncalled as a witness. Powers asserted that the petitioner shot at the ground near the victim\u2019s feet, then,\n\u201c[a]s he was turning to run he stumbled back and the gun went off.\u201d Powers acknowledged that he\ndid not testify at his own trial. He conceded that at the petitioner\u2019s first trial he did not mention that\nthe petitioner stumbled and accidentally discharged the fatal round. Further, Powers conceded that\nhe never told police that the fatal shot was accidental. In fact, Powers admitted that the first time he\never mentioned that the second shot was accidental was at the petitioner\u2019s post-conviction hearing.\n\n       The petitioner\u2019s trial counsel testified that he represented the petitioner at both his first and\nsecond trials. Trial counsel recalled having several conversations with the petitioner regarding the\nwitnesses they would call for the second trial. Counsel outlined the \u201cpros and cons\u201d of each witness.\n\n\n        1\n            Powers was convicted under the theory of criminal responsibility.\n\n                                                         -3-\n\fCounsel could not specifically recall discussing the possibility of Powers testifying on the\npetitioner\u2019s behalf. However, he surmised that he likely told the petitioner that he would not\nrecommend subpoenaing Powers. Counsel did not recall the petitioner asking for Powers to be a\nwitness at his second trial. Trial counsel asserted that if the petitioner had requested that Powers\ntestify at the second trial, counsel would have subpoenaed Powers. Trial counsel admitted that he\ndid not interview Powers prior to the second trial.\n\n        Trial counsel noted that the State called Powers to testify at the petitioner\u2019s first trial. Trial\ncounsel opined that the State was surprised by Powers testimony that he, not the petitioner, brought\nthe gun to the scene of the crime. However, the remainder of Powers\u2019 testimony was substantially\nthe same as that of other witnesses at both trials, making his testimony cumulative. When the State\ngave trial counsel its witness list for the second trial, trial counsel noticed that Powers\u2019 name was\nnot on the list. Counsel maintained that\n\n                it was my belief that they had modified their questioning and their\n                testimony and other \u2013 might have had rebuttal witnesses which they\n                didn\u2019t bring forward to negate his testimony. I thought he would be\n                \u2013 they were laying \u2013 they might have been laying a trap, so to speak,\n                hoping I would call Mr. Powers.\n\n        At the conclusion of the proof, the post-conviction court denied the petition for post-\nconviction relief. The court found that the petitioner failed to prove by clear and convincing\nevidence that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel. The petitioner now appeals this\nruling.\n\n                                             II. Analysis\n\n         To be successful in his claim for post-conviction relief, the petitioner must prove all factual\nallegations contained in his post-conviction petition by clear and convincing evidence. See Tenn.\nCode Ann. \u00a7 40-30-110(f) (2003). \u201c\u2018Clear and convincing evidence means evidence in which there\nis no serious or substantial doubt about the correctness of the conclusions drawn from the\nevidence.\u2019\u201d State v. Holder, 15 S.W.3d 905, 911 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999) (quoting Hodges v. S.C.\nToof & Co., 833 S.W.2d 896, 901 n.2 (Tenn. 1992)). Issues regarding the credibility of witnesses,\nthe weight and value to be accorded their testimony, and the factual questions raised by the evidence\nadduced at trial are to be resolved by the post-conviction court as the trier of fact. See Henley v.\nState, 960 S.W.2d 572, 579 (Tenn. 1997). Therefore, we afford the post-conviction court\u2019s findings\nof fact the weight of a jury verdict, with such findings being conclusive on appeal absent a showing\nthat the evidence in the record preponderates against those findings. Id. at 578.\n\n        A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact. See State\nv. Burns, 6 S.W.3d 453, 461 (Tenn. 1999). We will review the post-conviction court\u2019s findings of\nfact de novo with a presumption that those findings are correct. See Fields v. State, 40 S.W.3d 450,\n\n\n\n                                                   -4-\n\f458 (Tenn. 2001). However, we will review the post-conviction court\u2019s conclusions of law purely\nde novo. Id.\n\n        \u201cTo establish ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner bears the burden of proving\nboth that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced the defense.\u201d Goad\nv. State, 938 S.W.2d 363, 369 (Tenn. 1996) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687,\n104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984)). In evaluating whether the petitioner has met this burden, this court\nmust determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was within the range of competence required of\nattorneys in criminal cases. See Baxter v. Rose, 523 S.W.2d 930, 936 (Tenn. 1975). Moreover,\n\n                [b]ecause a petitioner must establish both prongs of the test, a failure\n                to prove either deficiency or prejudice provides a sufficient basis to\n                deny relief on the ineffective assistance claim. Indeed, a court need\n                not address the components in any particular order or even address\n                both if the [petitioner] makes an insufficient showing of one\n                component.\n\nGoad, 938 S.W.2d at 370 (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069).\n\n         As we have noted, the petitioner contends that trial counsel should have called Powers to\ntestify at his second trial. Powers testified at the post-conviction hearing that the fatal shot occurred\nwhen the petitioner stumbled as he turned to run from the victim. However, Powers admitted that\nprior to the post-conviction hearing, he had never told anyone that the fatal shot was fired\naccidentally, even though the information would have been important to the petitioner\u2019s defense and\nto Power\u2019s own defense. Additionally, trial counsel testified that Powers\u2019 testimony at the first trial\nwas largely cumulative to that of the other witnesses. Further, even though the State chose not to\nutilize Powers in the second trial, counsel feared that having Powers testify as a witness for the\ndefense could ultimately damage the petitioner\u2019s case. Therefore, he determined that having Powers\ntestify was not in the petitioner\u2019s best interest. It is apparent that counsel\u2019s decision not to call\nPowers was a strategic choice. On appeal, this court may not second-guess the tactical or strategic\nchoices of counsel unless those choices are based upon inadequate preparation, nor may we measure\ncounsel\u2019s behavior by \u201c20-20 hindsight.\u201d See State v. Hellard, 629 S.W.2d 4, 9 (Tenn. 1982). The\npetitioner has failed to prove trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in this regard.\n\n       As his final complaint of ineffective assistance, the petitioner asserts that counsel should have\nrequested that the trial court instruct the jury on all lesser-included offenses of premeditated first\ndegree murder. At the petitioner\u2019s second trial, the trial court instructed the jury on first degree\nmurder and second degree murder. The trial court did not instruct the jury on voluntary\nmanslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, or reckless homicide.\n\n        Regarding lesser-included offense instructions, our supreme court has noted that \u201c[t]he trial\ncourt\u2019s duty to charge juries as to the law of each offense included in an indictment applies whether\nor not a defendant requests such an instruction.\u201d State v. Wilson, 92 S.W.3d 391, 394 (Tenn. 2002);\n\n\n                                                  -5-\n\fsee also Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-18-110(a) (1997); Yasmond Fenderson v. State, No. E2001-01088-\nCCA-R3-PC, 2002 WL 832205, at *5 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Knoxville, May 2, 2002), perm. to\nappeal denied, (Tenn. 2002). Based upon the trial court\u2019s duty to instruct the jury regardless of\ncounsel\u2019s request, this court has previously declined to find that counsel was ineffective for failing\nto pursue lesser-included offense instructions at trial. See Terrance L. Turner v. State, No. M2002-\n02429-CCA-R3-PC, 2004 WL 587636, at *5 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, Mar. 25, 2004), perm.\nto appeal denied, (Tenn. 2004); Terry David Stephens v. State, No. M2001-01036-CCA-R3-PC,\n2002 WL 31890860, at *7 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, Dec. 30, 2002), perm. to appeal denied,\n(Tenn. 2003). Accordingly, we conclude that the petitioner also failed to establish the ineffective\nassistance of counsel in this regard.2\n\n                                                III. Conclusion\n\n         Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.\n\n\n                                                               ___________________________________\n                                                               NORMA McGEE OGLE, JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n         2\n            W e note that the petitioner raised this issue as the ineffective assistance of trial counsel, not as the\nineffectiveness of appellate counsel.\n\n                                                        -6-\n\f",
