STATE OF TENNESSEE\n\n                       Appeal from the Circuit Court for Tipton County\n                            No. 3739    Joseph H. Walker, Judge\n\n\n\n                   No. W2002-03150-CCA-R3-PC - Filed December 9, 2003\n\n\nThe petitioner, Darrow Lynn Williams, seeks post-conviction relief from his 2001 second degree\nmurder conviction. The Tipton County Circuit Court denied post-conviction relief, and now on\nappeal, the petitioner claims that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to prepare and devise a\ntrial strategy. Because the record supports the lower court\u2019s decision, we affirm the dismissal of the\npost-conviction petition.\n\n\n                Tenn. R. App. P. 3; Judgment of the Circuit Court is Affirmed.\n\nJAMES CURWOOD WITT, JR., J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which JOSEPH M. TIPTON and\nDAVID G. HAYES, JJ., joined.\n\nJ. Barney Witherington, IV, Covington, Tennessee, for the Appellant, Darrow Lynn Williams.\n\nPaul G. Summers, Attorney General & Reporter; Jennifer L. Bledsoe, Assistant Attorney General;\nElizabeth T. Rice, District Attorney General; and Walt Freeland, Assistant District Attorney General,\nfor the Appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                             OPINION\n\n               The petitioner\u2019s conviction was affirmed by this court on November 29, 2001. See\nState v. Darrow Lynn Williams, No. W2001-01825-CCA-R3-CD (Tenn. Crim. App., Jackson, Nov.\n29, 2001), perm. app. denied (Tenn. 2002). The jury\u2019s second degree murder verdict resulted from\nthe defendant\u2019s 1999 shooting of his brother-in-law during a party at the victim\u2019s house. Id., slip op.\nat 2. Following the verdict, the trial court sentenced the petitioner to serve fifteen years in the\nDepartment of Correction.\n\n                After the petitioner timely filed for post-conviction relief, the post-conviction court\nappointed counsel and conducted an evidentiary hearing on November 22, 2002. With respect to the\nissues on this appeal, the petitioner testified at the hearing as follows. He met with counsel only\n\fonce prior to trial, and the 30-to-60-minute meeting occurred a day or two before trial. The\npetitioner testified that counsel informed him that self-defense was not a viable defense theory and\nthat voluntary intoxication was the most promising defense. The petitioner testified that counsel\nfailed to challenge the testimony of trial witnesses, including the medical examiner, as to whether\nthe victim was shot first in the face and then in the chest or vice versa and that counsel failed to\nobject to other testimony that the petitioner thought was objectionable. On cross-examination, the\npetitioner gave a rambling account of how his shooting of the victim was accidental.\n\n                  Trial counsel testified at the evidentiary hearing that he had been engaged in the\npractice of criminal law since 1983. He had taken the petitioner\u2019s case over from the public\ndefender and had spent a \u201cgood bit of time\u201d discussing the case with his predecessor counsel.\nCounsel said that he anticipated the evidence that was presented in the case, and there were no\nsignificant surprises. Counsel recalled that the state mounted a strong case. Because the shooting\noccurred during a family gathering, there were several eyewitnesses to the shooting. They generally\ntestified at trial that the petitioner pulled the trigger intentionally. There was no issue of identity of\nthe shooter. Counsel testified that much was accomplished in the initial stages of the case; counsel\nwas able to persuade the police and the prosecutor not to bring a first degree murder charge. Counsel\ntestified that he decided not to employ a voluntary intoxication defense because he did not believe\nit would have militated against a knowing mens rea, especially in the face of eyewitness testimony\nthat the petitioner volitionally pulled the trigger twice.\n\n                On cross-examination, counsel testified that the public defender, who served as the\npetitioner\u2019s initial counsel, made extensive notes which were available to trial counsel. Counsel\ncharacterized the defense theory as \u201ctry[ing] to minimize the proof and obtain the most minimal\nsentencing factor we could.\u201d Counsel explained that the defense was somewhat hidebound; the\npetitioner had admitted to counsel that he had shot the victim, and there were five to eight\neyewitnesses to the shooting. The state did not utilize all its available witnesses in its case-in-chief\nbut reserved some witnesses for possible rebuttal testimony. Counsel knew, and explained to the\npetitioner, that only the petitioner, by testifying, could insert the claim of accidental shooting.\nCounsel testified that the petitioner opted not to testify. Counsel explained that counsel wanted to\ntry the case rather than plead guilty to second degree murder because of the possibility that the\nprosecution might falter or that the jury might return a verdict of a lesser offense. Counsel\ndiscounted the petitioner\u2019s claim that the order in which the shots were fired was a critical issue in\nthe case.\n\n                The post-conviction court found that the petitioner had \u201cfailed to show inadequate\ntrial preparation or bad trial tactics [or to show that any] deficient performance was prejudicial.\u201d The\ncourt dismissed the post-conviction relief petition, and the petitioner timely appealed.\n\n                Although a number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and trial error were\nraised in the petition and alluded to in the evidentiary hearing, the petitioner on appeal only raises\nthe issue of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in failing to prepare and devise a strategy for trial. Essentially,\nthe petitioner posits that trial counsel was so relieved that the charge had been reduced from first\n\n\n                                                   -2-\n\fdegree to second degree murder that he basically abdicated his duty to defend the petitioner against\nthe lesser charge.\n\n                 The Tennessee Post-Conviction Procedure Act authorizes the filing of a single\npetition, see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-102(c) (2003), to seek relief from a conviction or sentence\nthat is void or voidable because of the abridgement of any state or federal constitutional right, id. \u00a7\n40-30-103 (2003). The post-conviction petitioner bears the burden of proving the allegations of fact\nby clear and convincing evidence. Id. \u00a7 40-30-110(f) (2003). On appeal, a post-conviction court\u2019s\nfindings of fact are conclusive unless the evidence preponderates against them, and the appellate\ncourt will neither re-weigh the evidence nor evaluate the credibility of witnesses. An appellate\ncourt's review of a question of law or a mixed question of law and fact, such as an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim, however, is reviewed de novo with no presumption of correctness.\nNichols v. State, 90 S.W.3d 576, 586 (Tenn. 2002)\n\n                To establish an abridgement of the right to the effective assistance of counsel as\nguaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, section 9 of the\nTennessee Constitution, the claimant must show both that counsel's performance was deficient and\nthat the deficiency prejudiced the defense. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 692, 104 S. Ct.\n2052, 2067 (1984); Nichols, 90 S.W.3d at 586. Deficient performance of counsel equates to \u201cacts\nor omissions [that] were so serious that they fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under\nprevailing professional norms.\u201d Nichols, 90 S.W.3d at 587. The court reviewing counsel\u2019s\nperformance not only views the claimed deficiency from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time of the\nalleged acts or omissions, but it also indulges \u201ca heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s\njudgments.\u201d Id.; State v. Burns, 6 S.W.3d 453, 462 (Tenn. 1999). To establish that deficient\nperformance resulted in prejudice, the claimant is required to demonstrate that \u201cthere is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the\noutcome.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068. The claimant \u201cmust establish that the\ndeficiency of counsel was of such a degree that it deprived the defendant of a fair trial and called into\nquestion the reliability of the outcome.\u201d Nichols, 90 S.W.3d at 587.\n\n                  Having reviewed the facts and the applicable principles of law, we must agree with\nthe trial court that the petitioner failed to establish either deficient performance of counsel or that he\nwas in any way prejudiced by counsel\u2019s assistance. The state had a very strong case, and the state\u2019s\nelection to charge the petitioner with second degree and not first degree murder effectively\ndiminished the efficacy of a meaningful state-of-mind defense. Because there was no issue of\nidentity, the defense was relegated to going to trial with nothing to lose and hoping for the best.\nCounsel performed well under the circumstances, and we cannot fault his actions and tactics in\npursuing a trial in the hopes of jury dispensations. The evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing\ndemonstrated no deficiency of performance and no prejudice.\n\n                Accordingly, the denial of post-conviction relief is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                   -3-\n\f      ___________________________________\n      JAMES CURWOOD WITT, JR., JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n-4-\n\f",
