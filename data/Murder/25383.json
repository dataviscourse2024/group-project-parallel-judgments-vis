Williams, in proper person.\n\n     Pamela Jo Bondi, Attorney General, for respondent.\n\nBefore SALTER, EMAS and FERNANDEZ, JJ.\n\n     EMAS, J.\n\f            ON MOTION FOR REHEARING, CLARIFICATION,\n                     AND WRITTEN OPINION\n\n      In March of 1987, Petitioner, R.L. Williams, was tried for, and convicted of,\n\nfirst-degree murder and armed robbery. In June of 1987, the trial court imposed\n\nconsecutive life sentences. Following an appeal, this court affirmed the judgments\n\nof conviction and the life sentence for the first-degree murder, but reversed and\n\nremanded for a resentencing on the armed robbery conviction. See Williams v.\n\nState, 544 So. 2d 1125 (Fla. 3d DCA 1989).\n\n      On August 25, 1989, the trial court held a resentencing hearing and again\n\nimposed a consecutive life sentence for the armed robbery conviction. No appeal\n\nwas taken from that sentence.\n\n      On October 19, 2016, Williams filed the instant petition for writ of habeas\n\ncorpus, seeking a belated appeal of his 1989 consecutive life sentence. In his\n\npetition, Williams set forth the reasons why he did not timely appeal this\n\nresentencing:\n\n      [The] reason the claim in the present petition was not raised\n      previously is because at resentencing . . . on August 25, 1989,\n      Petitioner expressed to Counsel B. Myrberg who was at resentencing\n      instead of Yale Galanter1 that \u201cThey did the wrong thing and still gave\n      me life, I want to appeal\u201d, counsel expressed that he would tell Mr.\n      Galanter and, based upon Mr. Myrberg response, Petitioner proceeded\n      after 1989 under the misleading belief that an appeal from his\n\n1 Mr. Galanter was Petitioner\u2019s counsel during the trial and the initial sentencing.\nIt appears, from the limited record provided, that Mr. Myrberg stood in for Mr.\nGalanter and represented Williams during the resentencing proceeding.\n\n                                         2\n\f      resentencing was pending review in this Court and, until August 2016,\n      was unaware that Mr. Myrberg nor Mr. Galanter never filed a notice\n      of appeal from the resentencing.\n\n      Given the seventeen-year lapse of time between the resentencing and the\n\ninstant petition, we denied Williams\u2019 request for a belated appeal. See Fla. R. App.\n\nP. 9.141(c)(5)(A).     Undaunted, Williams has filed a motion for rehearing,\n\nclarification, and written opinion. We deny Williams\u2019 request for rehearing and\n\nclarification. However (and likely to his chagrin), we grant Williams\u2019 motion for\n\nwritten opinion and, in doing so, order Williams to show cause why he should not\n\nbe sanctioned for abusing the postconviction process by filing a petition that\n\ncontains factual allegations which are materially and irreconcilably in conflict with\n\na pro se pleading previously filed by Williams in an earlier appeal to this court.\n\n\n                             SHOW CAUSE ORDER\n\n\n      Specifically, in case number 3D07-2543, Williams appealed from a 2007\n\norder denying his motion to correct illegal sentence under Florida Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure 3.800(a).2 In the pro se brief filed in that appeal, Williams raised the\n\nfollowing issues:\n\n\n\n\n2 This court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order in all respects, except for directing the\ntrial court to award Williams an additional 125 days\u2019 credit for time served in the\ncounty jail prior to his original sentencing. See Williams v. State, 979 So. 2d 1007\n(Fla. 3d DCA 2008).\n\n                                          3\n\f      I. BECAUSE HE WAS NOT PRESENT AND REPRESENTED BY\n      COUNSEL    AT   THE    PURPORTED   RE-SENTENCING\n      PROCEEDING, APPELLANT IS ENTITLED TO RE-\n      SENTENCING, REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL AND TO GIVE\n      EVIDENCE AS TO WHY HE SHOULD RECEIVE A LESSER\n      SENTENCE.\n\n\n      II. WILLIAMS WAS NOT INFORMED OF RIGHT TO APPEAL\n      RE-SENTENCING PROCEEDING.\n\n      Williams\u2019 pro se brief contained the following factual assertions in support\n\nof these two claims:\n\n      Appellant contends that the trial court did not conduct a re-sentencing\n      hearing during which he [Williams] appeared before the court, on\n      August 25, 1989. While the written sentencing order does indicate\n      [that Williams was present], it [the sentencing order] is wrong. . . .\n      Had Williams been present he would have given evidence and\n      argument in support of a sentence less than life.\n      Further, had Williams been present during the purported hearing\n      he would have demanded that counsel appeal the subsequent\n      sentence due to the extent of departure.\n\n      As previously argued. . . [Williams] was neither present or\n      represented by legal counsel at the alleged re-sentencing hearing\n      conducted on August 25, 1989.\n      Moreover, it would have been counsel[\u2019s] duty to execute the appeal,\n      prior to his withdrawal. No appeal was ever taken from the re-\n      sentencing proceedings, despite a mandatory life sentence imposed,\n      and the extent of the departure. Had Williams been present at the re-\n      sentencing, he would have offered evidence and argument in support\n      of a lesser sentence, consistent with the sentence negotiation, and\n      would have demanded that counsel execute the appeal.\n      (Emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                        4\n\f      So what we now know is that on February 8, 2008, when Williams signed\n\nand filed his pro se brief in 3D07-2543, he alleged that \u201cno appeal was ever taken\n\nfrom the re-sentencing proceedings.\u201d And yet, in the instant pro se petition, signed\n\nand filed more than eight years later, Williams now asserts, inexplicably, that he\n\nwas \u201cunder the misleading belief that an appeal from his resentencing was pending\n\nreview in this Court and, until August 2016, was unaware that Mr. Myrberg nor\n\nMr. Galanter never filed a notice of appeal from the resentencing.\u201d\n\n      We also know that, on February 8, 2008, when Williams signed and filed his\n\npro se brief in 3D07-2543, he alleged that he was not even present for the\n\nresentencing proceeding, and further alleged that \u201chad Williams been present\n\nduring the purported hearing he would have demanded that counsel appeal the\n\nsubsequent sentence.\u201d And yet, in the instant pro se petition signed and filed more\n\nthan eight years later, Williams now asserts that \u201cat resentencing on August 25,\n\n1989, Petitioner expressed to Counsel . . . \u2018They did the wrong thing and still gave\n\nme life, I want to appeal.\u2019\u201d\n\n      These two versions, contained in two different pro se pleadings signed and\n\nfiled by Williams, are irreconcilable and evidence a calculated attempt to subvert\n\nthe postconviction process by maliciously bringing false information before this\n\ncourt. By his actions, Williams appears to have demonstrated a willful attempt to\n\nfabricate material \u201cfacts\u201d as needed to satisfy his then-present purposes. Such a\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fperversion of the judicial system cannot be condoned, and cannot be justified by\n\nhis pro se status.3 As we have previously observed, a litigant may forfeit the right\n\nto proceed pro se where he abuses the judicial process, and no pro se litigant has\n\nthe \u201cright\u201d to continue to file wholly frivolous or patently false postconviction\n\nmotions and petitions. See e.g., Jimenez v. State, 196 So. 3d 499 (Fla. 3d DCA\n\n2016); Westbrook v. State, 149 So. 3d 723 (Fla. 3d DCA 2014); Walker v. State,\n\n139 So. 3d 371 (Fla. 3d DCA 2014)\n\n      The present situation goes beyond the pale, as Williams is not merely\n\ncontinuing to file claims which have previously been heard, considered and\n\nrejected. Instead, Williams\u2019 malicious and deceptive conduct strikes at the very\n\nheart of a system in which truth serves as an indispensable component of justice.\n\n      Accordingly, we order R.L. Williams, within thirty (30) days from the date\n\nof this order, to file a response and to show cause why this court should not impose\n\nsanctions, including: prohibiting Williams from submitting further pro se appeals,\n\npetitions, motions or other pleadings regarding lower court case number F86-5409,\n\nunless such pleadings are signed by an attorney who is a duly licensed member of\n\nThe Florida Bar in good standing; and directing the Clerk of this Court to forward\n\na certified copy of this opinion, and any further opinion or order issued in this\n\n\n\n3We note that, since his direct appeal, Williams has filed at least fifteen pro se\npostconviction appeals or original proceedings in this court.\n\n                                         6\n\fcause, to the Department of Corrections pursuant to section 944.279(1), Florida\n\nStatutes (2016) for consideration of disciplinary procedures.4\n\n\n\n\n4   That subsection provides:\n\nAt any time, and upon its own motion or on motion of a party, a court may conduct\nan inquiry into whether any action or appeal brought by a prisoner was brought in\ngood faith. A prisoner who is found by a court to have brought a frivolous or\nmalicious suit, action, claim, proceeding, or appeal in any court of this state or in\nany federal court, which is filed after June 30, 1996, or to have brought a frivolous\nor malicious collateral criminal proceeding, which is filed after September 30,\n2004, or who knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth brought false\ninformation or evidence before the court, is subject to disciplinary procedures\npursuant to the rules of the Department of Corrections. The court shall issue a\nwritten finding and direct that a certified copy be forwarded to the appropriate\ninstitution or facility for disciplinary procedures pursuant to the rules of the\ndepartment as provided in s. 944.09.\n\n                                         7\n\f",
