On October 26, 2006, then seventeen-year-old Appellant shot and\n\nkilled a victim in Philadelphia.     A jury convicted Appellant on October 14,\n\n2008, of first degree murder. The court immediately imposed an automatic\n\nlife sentence without the possibility of parole (\u201cLWOP\u201d).     Appellant timely\n\nfiled a direct appeal on November 12, 2008, which was later dismissed on\n\nFebruary 4, 2010, for counsel\u2019s failure to file a brief.   Although this Court\n\ndirected counsel to notify Appellant of the dismissal and file in this Court a\n\ncertification of that notice, counsel did not comply. Following an inquiry and\n\fJ-S24029-15\n\n\ncomplaint to the state disciplinary board, Appellant learned on September\n\n29, 2011, that his appeal had been dismissed.\n\n      On August 2, 2012, Appellant mailed a pro se pleading (filed August 7,\n\n2012) to the court, asking for the appointment of counsel for purposes of\n\nseeking collateral relief under Miller v. Alabama, ___ U.S. ___, 132 S. Ct.\n\n2455, 183 L. Ed. 2d 407 (2012), which had been recently filed on June 25,\n\n2012. The court did not respond. On October 10, 2012, Appellant filed a\n\npro se PCRA petition. The court appointed counsel on July 12, 2013, who\n\nfiled an amended PCRA petition on October 30, 2013. Counsel filed a second\n\namended petition on December 7, 2013, seeking habeas corpus and PCRA\n\nrelief and citing Miller both as an exception to the PCRA timeliness\n\nrequirements and as a basis for substantive relief.        The court issued Rule\n\n907 notice on July 15, 2014, and dismissed the petition on September 26,\n\n2014. On appeal, this Court affirmed the denial of PCRA relief, pursuant to\n\nCommonwealth v. Cunningham, 622 Pa. 543, 81 A.3d 1 (2013) (holding\n\nMiller does not apply retroactively to sentences which became final before\n\nthe filing date of Miller (June 25, 2012)).\n\n      On February 24, 2016, our Supreme Court vacated this Court\u2019s\n\ndisposition   and   later   remanded   the    case   for   reconsideration   under\n\nMontgomery v. Louisiana, ___ U.S. ___, 136 S. Ct. 718, 193 L. Ed. 2d 599\n\n(2016 WL 280758 *12) (filed January 25, 2016, and revised on January 27,\n\n2016) (holding Miller applies retroactively to cases on collateral review).\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fJ-S24029-15\n\n\nBecause Appellant was seventeen years old at the time of his offense, he\n\nfalls within the class of juvenile offenders who might benefit from the\n\nMontogmery/Miller decisions. See Commonwealth v. Secreti, ___ A.3d\n\n___, 2016 Pa. Super. 28 (filed February 9, 2016) (holding retroactivity under\n\nMontgomery is effective as of date of Miller decision; orders denying PCRA\n\nrelief in cases involving Montgomery/Miller must be reversed and\n\nremanded for resentencing consistent with this new rule of substantive law\n\nand Commonwealth v. Batts, 620 Pa. 115, 131-32, 66 A.3d 286, 296\n\n(2013)).\n\n           [A]t a minimum [the court] should consider a juvenile\u2019s\n           age at the time of the offense, his diminished culpability\n           and capacity for change, the circumstances of the crime,\n           the extent of his participation in the crime, his family,\n           home and neighborhood environment, his emotional\n           maturity and development, the extent that familial and/or\n           peer pressure may have affected him, his past exposure to\n           violence, his drug and alcohol history, his ability to deal\n           with the police, his capacity to assist his attorney, his\n           mental health history, and his potential for rehabilitation.\n\nId. at 133, 66 A.3d at 297.       Taking such factors into consideration, the\n\nimposition of a minimum sentence in all but the most egregious cases, is the\n\nmost appropriate remedy for the federal constitutional violation that occurs\n\nwhen a court has mechanically and mandatorily applied a LWOP sentence on\n\na juvenile offender. Id.\n\n     Here, Appellant was a seventeen-year-old juvenile when he shot and\n\nkilled a victim in Philadelphia on October 26, 2006.        Appellant\u2019s second\n\namended PCRA petition asserted a new constitutional right under Miller,\n\n                                      -3-\n\fJ-S24029-15\n\n\nsupra, both as an exception to the statutory timeliness requirements and\n\nfor the purposes of substantive relief. Appellant\u2019s petition was denied under\n\nCunningham, supra.           In light of more recent case law, however,\n\nCunningham no longer controls in this context.           See Secreti, supra.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse the PCRA court\u2019s order, vacate Appellant\u2019s judgment\n\nof sentence, and remand for resentencing in accordance with Batts, supra.\n\n        Order reversed; case remanded for further proceedings. Jurisdiction is\n\nrelinquished.\n\n        Judge Allen did not participate in the consideration or decision of this\n\ncase.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D. Seletyn, Esq.\nProthonotary\n\n\n\nDate: 4/1/2016\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f",
