He now appeals, challenging the reasonableness of his sentence.\n\nAfter review, we affirm.\n\n      At issue in this case is the district court\u2019s consideration of an unrecorded\n\nconversation between Beauchamp\u2019s girlfriend Felicia Brown (Felicia) and her ex-\n\nhusband Peter Brown (Peter). After Felicia\u2019s car was repossessed, an employee of\n\nthe repossession company found a revolver, silencer, and mask in the car. When\n\nFelicia tried to reclaim her car from the impound lot and learned the items had\n\nbeen given to police, she stated the items belonged to her boyfriend. Police\n\nlearned Beauchamp was the boyfriend and obtained a search warrant for his home.\n\nDuring the search they found insulation and duct tape, along with a computer that\n\nhad been used to visit web sites detailing how to make a homemade silencer.\n\n      When questioned by police, both Felicia and Beauchamp denied seeing the\n\nfirearm and silencer found in her car. ATF special agent Daniel Dooley, seeking\n\nto speak to Felicia alone, contacted Peter to speak to her on his behalf. Peter later\n\nmet with Felicia, gave her Dooley\u2019s card, and, on his own, recorded their\n\nconversation. In the recording, Felicia admitted that she had obtained the firearm\n\nand Beauchamp had made the silencer. According to Peter, in an unrecorded part\n\nof the conversation, Felicia told him that Beauchamp \u201cwas gonna to try to get rid\n\nof\u201d Michelle Dent, the mother of Beauchamp\u2019s children. Peter did not contact the\n\n                                          2\n\fATF agent after his meeting with Felicia, nor did he tell the police or ATF the\n\ndetails of the conversation for fourteen months.1\n\n       Beauchamp pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered silencer. The\n\ndistrict court calculated Beauchamp\u2019s sentencing range under U.S.S.G.\n\n\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3). When a defendant possesses the silencer in connection with the\n\nattempted commission of another offense, however, the cross-reference provision\n\nin \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1)(A) instructs the court to apply the guideline applicable to the\n\nattempted offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1)(A), 2X1.1, 2A1.5. Based on Peter\u2019s\n\ntestimony of the unrecorded conversation with Felicia, the district court found that\n\nBeauchamp and Felicia conspired to commit murder and thus determined that the\n\nbase offense level was 33 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.5 \u2013 the guideline applicable to\n\nmurder. With a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility,\n\nBeauchamp\u2019s total adjusted offense level was 30. Beauchamp had a lengthy\n\ncriminal history, including several violent offenses, which placed him in criminal\n\nhistory category III. The resulting guideline range was 121 to 151 months\u2019\n\nimprisonment. Because \u00a7 5861 carried a statutory maximum sentence of 120\n\nmonths\u2019 imprisonment, this became the guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(a).\n\n\n\n       1\n         By the time of Beauchamp\u2019s sentencing hearing, Felicia was dead and Beauchamp had\nbeen charged with her murder.\n\n                                             3\n\f      Beauchamp objected to the court\u2019s reliance on Felicia\u2019s uncorroborated\n\nhearsay statement to Peter. After listening to the arguments and finding Peter\u2019s\n\ntestimony credible and reliable, the court concluded that 120 months\u2019\n\nimprisonment was the proper sentence. The court further stated that \u201ceven if the\n\nguidelines are wrong, even if my scoring of the guidelines are wrong based on\n\n3553(a), I find that a reasonable and sufficient sentence in this case is 120 months\n\nin prison.\u201d The court did not otherwise mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or state how\n\nit had arrived at the sentence. This is Beauchamp\u2019s appeal.\n\n      We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential\n\nabuse-of-discretion standard of review. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 41\n\n(2007). We may \u201cset aside a sentence only if we determine, after giving a full\n\nmeasure of deference to the sentencing judge, that the sentence imposed truly is\n\nunreasonable.\u201d United States v. Irey, 612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir. 2010) (en\n\nbanc), cert. denied, 131 S.Ct. 1813 (2011). A sentence may only be vacated if we\n\nare left with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the district court committed a\n\nclear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence\n\nthat lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the\n\ncase.\u201d United States v. Pugh, 515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir. 2008) (quotation\n\nomitted).\n\n                                          4\n\f      The district court is required to impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not\n\ngreater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote\n\nrespect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal\n\nconduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and\n\nprovide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical\n\ncare, or other correctional treatment. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district\n\ncourt must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history\n\nand characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the\n\napplicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements issued by the\n\nSentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities, and\n\nthe need to provide restitution to victims. Id. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).\n\n      In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we must first ensure that the\n\nsentence was procedurally reasonable, meaning the district court properly\n\ncalculated the guideline range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the\n\n\u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and\n\nadequately explained the chosen sentence. Gall, 552 U.S. at 51. Once we\n\ndetermine a sentence is procedurally reasonable, we must examine whether the\n\nsentence, including the extent of any variance, was substantively reasonable under\n\n                                          5\n\fthe totality of the circumstances. Id. A sentence may be substantively\n\nunreasonable if the district court arbitrarily selects the sentence, bases the sentence\n\non impermissible factors, or fails to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Pugh,\n\n515 F.3d at 1192. Beauchamp bears the burden to show his sentence is\n\nunreasonable. United States v. Talley, 431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir. 2005).\n\n      In this case, Beauchamp argues that his sentence was procedurally\n\nunreasonable because the district court gave undue weight to the uncorroborated\n\nhearsay testimony. He argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable\n\nbecause it is well above the guideline range that he would have faced had the court\n\nnot considered the hearsay testimony.\n\n      A. Procedural Reasonableness\n\n      We review credibility determinations for clear error. United States v.\n\nPineiro, 389 F.3d 1359, 1366 (11th Cir. 2004). We will not reverse the district\n\ncourt\u2019s credibility determination \u201cunless it is contrary to the laws of nature, or is\n\nso inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept\n\nit.\u201d Id. As for the use of hearsay evidence at sentencing, \u201cthe court may consider\n\nrelevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence\n\napplicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability\n\nto support its probable accuracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a); see also United States v.\n\n                                           6\n\fGhertler, 605 F.3d 1256, 1269 (11th Cir. 2010).\n\n       Our case law clearly provides that reliable hearsay can be considered during\n\nsentencing. United States v. Wilson, 183 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir. 1999). The\n\ndistrict court may rely on such evidence \u201cas long as the evidence has sufficient\n\nindicia of reliability, the court makes explicit findings of fact as to credibility, and\n\nthe defendant has an opportunity to rebut the evidence.\u201d United States v.\n\nZlatogur, 271 F.3d 1025, 1031 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting United States v.\n\nAnderton, 136 F.3d 747, 751 (11th Cir. 1998)).\n\n       After review, we see no procedural error in the court\u2019s reliance on Peter\u2019s\n\ntestimony. The district court properly considered the hearsay testimony,2 and\n\nmade explicit factual findings as to Peter\u2019s credibility. We will defer to that\n\nfinding. Based on this testimony, the court properly calculated the guideline range\n\nusing the cross-reference provision in \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1)(A). Peter\u2019s testimony\n\nestablished that Beauchamp and Felicia possessed the firearm and silencer as part\n\nof their plot to murder Michelle Dent. Thus, \u00a7 2A1.5(a), the guideline applicable\n\nto murder, was the correct guideline.\n\n\n\n       2\n          Notably, Beauchamp challenges only the reliability of the statement. He does not argue\nthat the court\u2019s admission of the testimony violated his due process rights. Nor does he allege\nthat the district court failed to sufficiently explain the sentence imposed. Thus, he has waived\nthis issues. United States v. Pilati, 627 F.3d 1360, 1364 (11th Cir. 2010).\n\n                                               7\n\f      Nevertheless, even if the court\u2019s guideline calculation was in error, the error\n\nwas harmless. The court stated that it would have imposed the same 120-month\n\nsentence based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. \u201cAn error in the district court\u2019s\n\ncalculation of the Sentencing Guidelines range warrants vacating the sentence,\n\nunless the error is harmless. A Sentencing Guidelines miscalculation is harmless\n\nif the district court would have imposed the same sentence without the error.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Barner, 572 F.3d 1239, 1247\u201348 (11th Cir. 2009) (citation\n\nomitted) (if \u201ca district judge clearly states that he would impose the same sentence,\n\neven if he erred in calculating the guidelines, then any error in the calculation is\n\nharmless\u201d); see also United States v. Keene, 470 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir. 2006).\n\n      B. Substantive Reasonableness\n\n      The district court imposed the statutory maximum sentence after\n\nconsidering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court also was well aware of the\n\nsentencing range Beauchamp faced without the cross-reference provision and the\n\nother information in the presentence investigation report. Although the court did\n\nnot explicitly discuss the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it was not required to do so. United\n\nStates v. Scott, 426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2005). In this case, Beauchamp\n\nhad a criminal history category III with several violent offenses. The court found\n\nthat his possession of the unregistered silencer was related to a conspiracy to\n\n                                           8\n\fcommit murder. In imposing the sentence, the district court stated that it had\n\nconsidered the guidelines and the sentencing factors. Considering the totality of\n\nthe circumstances, we cannot conclude that the sentence imposed, although at the\n\nstatutory maximum, was substantively unreasonable, and Beauchamp has not met\n\nhis burden to show otherwise.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f",
