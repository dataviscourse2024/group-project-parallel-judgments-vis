Schneiderman, Attorney General, Albany (Frank Brady of counsel), for respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nAarons, J.\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM AND JUDGMENT\r\nProceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 (transferred to this Court by order of the Supreme Court, entered in Albany County) to review a determination of respondent rescinding petitioner's open release date and imposing a hold period of 18 months.\r\nAs a result of two separate stabbing incidents, petitioner was convicted of a number of crimes, the most serious being murder in the second degree, for which he was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. While in prison, he was charged with additional crimes and was thereafter convicted upon his plea of guilty of attempted promoting prison contraband in the first degree. Petitioner was sentenced to an additional 1\u00bd to 3 years in prison, to run consecutively to his other sentences.\r\nIn March 2016, petitioner made his fourth appearance before respondent seeking to be released to parole supervision. At the conclusion of the hearing, respondent issued a determination, with one commissioner dissenting, granting petitioner parole and setting an open release date of May 12, 2016. A rescission hearing was subsequently conducted in July 2016 and, at its conclusion, respondent issued a determination, with one commissioner dissenting, rescinding petitioner's release and ordering him held for an additional 18 months. After this determination was affirmed on administrative appeal, petitioner commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding.\r\nPetitioner's counsel has advised this Court that petitioner was released to parole supervision on December 5, 2017. Accordingly, the parties argue, and we agree, that the petition [*2]must be dismissed as moot (see Matter of Mitchell v Travis, 14 AD3d 955, 956 [2005]).\r\nGarry, P.J., Clark, Mulvey and Rumsey, JJ., concur.\r\nADJUDGED that the petition is dismissed, as moot, without costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
