Rodriguez and the State agree that the trial court\u2019s\n\fcharge included erroneous instructions regarding a qualification on self-defense,\n\nbut they disagree about whether reversal is warranted. We conclude that it is, and\n\nwe reverse and remand for a new trial.\n\n                                  Background\n\n      In the early morning of May 2, 2010, Harris County police responded to\n\nreports of a weapons disturbance in a rural neighborhood. Upon arriving at the\n\nscene, they discovered that the complainant, Danaher, had been shot in the street.\n\nTwo others were struggling to hold down Rodriguez, who had fired the shots.\n\nEveryone other than Rodriguez had been at a party inside. Danaher, the host of the\n\nparty, died at the scene.\n\n      Rodriguez\u2019s defensive theory was that he fired his handgun in self-defense\n\nafter the partygoers threatened him. The jury rejected Rodriguez\u2019s claim after a\n\ntwo-week trial during which it heard the testimony of numerous witnesses and\n\nobserved an audio and video recording of the incident that Rodriguez captured on\n\nhis video camera.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fThe video recording\n\n      Much of the video recording consists of Rodriguez filming the party from\n\nacross the street, where he was standing at the side of the road, commenting about\n\nthe noise level, and shining a flashlight in the direction of the party.\n\n      About fifteen minutes into the recording, James Storm, Danaher\u2019s father-in-\n\nlaw, approached Rodriguez in a truck.1 Storm and Rodriguez argued about the\n\nnoise level and, eventually, a few partygoers, including Danaher, approached them.\n\n      As Danaher approached, Rodriguez said, \u201cYou need to stop right there.\n\nDon\u2019t come any closer, please.\u201d Danaher continued walking towards Rodriguez\n\nand responded, \u201cI, you\u2019re telling me what to do?\u201d Storm added, \u201cDon\u2019t tell us to\n\nstop coming close to you.\u201d\n\n      With Danaher still approaching, and two other partygoers now nearby,\n\nRodriguez said, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m telling you to stop. I said stop right now, or I\n\nwill shoot you! Stop! Get back!\u201d A partygoer yelled, \u201cBack up Kelly\u201d and\n\nRodriguez repeated, \u201cGet back!\u201d         Danaher can be seen backing away from\n\nRodriguez with his hands up, saying \u201cI ain\u2019t got nothing.\u201d Rodriguez responded,\n\n\u201cY\u2019all are drunk. Get away from me.\u201d\n\n\n1\n      Danaher and his family lived in the home, which was owned by Storm.\n\n\n                                           3\n\f      Danaher moved across the street from Rodriguez, where other partygoers\n\nhad gathered and then asked Rodriguez, \u201cYou pulled a gun on me?\u201d Rodriguez\n\nacknowledged that he had, adding \u201cI told you to stop.\u201d Then, from opposite sides\n\nof the road, Danaher and Rodriguez continued arguing about why Rodriguez drew\n\nthe gun, while Storm told the partygoers to call the police:\n\n      Danaher: I haven\u2019t done nothing to you.\n\n      Rodriguez: My life is in danger. You got weapons on you.\n\n      Danaher: Your life\u2019s in danger?\n\n      Rodriguez: Stay away from me. You\u2019re over here cussing at me and\n      hollering.\n      ...\n\n      Rodriguez: Get away from me. Keep it down. I got everything\n      videotaped.\n\n      Storm: Yeah, call the cops on this jack-off. He\u2019s down here out in\n      the middle of the street with a gun.\n\n      Rodriguez: Yeah, I told you to stop. I asked you to stop.\n\n      Danaher: And what happened? I stopped.\n\n      Rodriguez: No, you stopped after I drew my weapon.\n\n      Danaher: And I pulled back.\n\n      Rodriguez: You stopped after I drew my weapon. I asked you to stop\n      and get back. . . . I asked you to turn this crap down.\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      Rodriguez and Danaher continued arguing from opposite sides of the road\n\nabout the volume of the music, and Rodriguez called the police, to whom he\n\nadmitted having drawn his gun, and asserted that he was in fear for his life:\n\n      Yes, my name is Raul Rodriguez. I called again. I had to draw my\n      weapon on somebody because I had, I told them to stop. They were\n      drunk, they coming at me. I told them to stop. They kept coming and\n      I drew my weapon. Then they stopped, I put my weapon up but now\n      they\u2019re saying I\u2019m sitting there waving my gun and everything and\n      I\u2019m not. I\u2019m videotaping everything right now. . . .\n\n      You know, it\u2019s just me against everybody. I\u2019ve got, I\u2019ve got . . . Ah\n      look, there\u2019s about 15 people here. Look, I\u2019m in fear for my life right\n      now. I\u2019m in very . . . That\u2019s why I drew my weapon. I\u2019m in fear for\n      my life. Please help me now. . . . They\u2019re going to kill me.\n\n      Storm then initiated another exchange with Rodriguez. Storm said that\n\nRodriguez would go to jail for drawing his gun, and Rodriguez again asserted\n\n\u201cwell, I was in fear for my life.\u201d Storm challenged Rodriguez to a fist fight,\n\nsaying, \u201cYou drop the gun and let\u2019s go ahead and duke it out mother f__er.\u201d As\n\nthe exchange continued, Rodriguez, still on the phone, told the dispatcher, \u201cListen.\n\nNow they\u2019re wanting to kick my ass. And now they\u2019re calling me mother f__er\n\nand they want to kick my ass and all this other stuff.\u201d\n\n      The video depicts another partygoer starting to cross the street toward\n\nRodriguez. Danaher stopped him, saying, \u201cHey, hey, hey, Ricky . . . . No, no, no,\n\nno. This dude is a f__ing idiot, he will shoot you. He\u2019s an idiot.\u201d\n\n                                          5\n\f      Meanwhile, Rodriguez continued talking to the dispatcher:\n\n      I\u2019ve got about 15 people here, they\u2019re wanting to kick my ass. They\n      want to beat me down. I had to draw my weapon to stop them to keep\n      them from coming to me. I felt my life was in danger, I drew my\n      weapon and then they stopped. I told them to get back. I told them to\n      just to turn it down and then, they started cussing, saying we\u2019re going\n      to kick his you know, f\u2019ing ass and all this other stuff, calling all kinds\n      of names and everything cuz I\u2019m, and I says look, I\u2019m videotaping all\n      this right now. . . . And I mean, I\u2019m scared to death here.\n\n      Storm told Rodriguez, \u201cI tell you what pal, you pulled a gun on the wrong\n\nmother f__er, ok? . . . You remember that.\u201d Storm then drove his truck up the\n\ndriveway toward the house.\n\n      Danaher continued arguing with Rodriguez: \u201cYou\u2019re gonna flash your God\n\ndamn gun. You\u2019re gonna flash your gun?\u201d Danaher again began walking toward\n\nRodriguez, but was stopped by Wilcox, who held him back, saying, \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d\n\n      Rodriguez told the dispatcher, \u201cOk. They\u2019re going to escalate this. . . .\n\nThey\u2019re going to the house to get something to shoot me with.\u201d As Storm drove\n\ntoward the house, Rodriguez said, \u201cOk look, I\u2019m going to defend myself. . . . I\n\nhave to defend myself. I\u2019m gonna have to defend myself.\u201d After hearing a loud\n\nbang from up the driveway, Rodriguez exclaimed, \u201cOh s__t.\u201d\n\n      The video recording became dark, but a partygoer can be heard yelling,\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even do it. Brandon, Brandon, don\u2019t do it.\u201d Another voice said, \u201cThis is\n\n\n                                          6\n\fbulls__t. You don\u2019t pull a gun on me.\u201d Rodriguez pleaded with the dispatcher to\n\nhelp, asserting that the partygoers were going to try to kill him:\n\n      It\u2019s about to get out of hand, sir. Please help me. Please help me sir.\n      My life is in danger now. He\u2019s about to, he says he\u2019s about to go in\n      the house, he\u2019s gonna be more than equal than me. Now I\u2019m standing\n      my ground here. Now these people are gonna try and kill me.\n\n      Toward the end of the recording, the partygoers continued arguing with\n\nRodriguez. Danaher again asked, \u201cYou pull a f__ing gun on me at my house?\u201d\n\nWilcox then interjected, saying, \u201cYou got a gun in your f__ing . . . you got a gun?\n\n. . . What are you, hopped up on coke?\u201d Danaher warned Wilcox, \u201cNo, no, no,\n\nhe\u2019s videoing us,\u201d and Wilcox responds, \u201cI know he is.\u201d Danaher said, \u201cMother\n\nf__er pulled a gun on me.\u201d\n\n      In the final moments of the recording, Rodriguez told the dispatcher, \u201cLook,\n\nI\u2019m not losing to these people any more. I\u2019m just gonna just tell them to stay back.\n\nThey\u2019re drunk. They\u2019re swearing.\u201d Then a partygoer later identified as Ricky\n\nJohnson moved toward Rodriguez and yelled, \u201cHa ha ha!\u201d Rodriguez dropped the\n\ncamera, fired his gun and yelled, \u201cGod dang it!\u201d\n\nTestimony of partygoers\n\n      Five partygoers testified at trial. In general, they testified that as the party\n\nwas winding down, a few of them noticed a flashlight on the road and walked to\n\nthe end of the driveway, where they discovered Storm and Rodriguez arguing.\n                                          7\n\fOnly a few partygoers were present when Rodriguez first drew, then put away, his\n\nhandgun, but multiple partygoers arrived by the time Rodriguez fired.          The\n\npartygoers acknowledged that Johnson had stepped into the road, waved his arms,\n\nand laughed loudly in the seconds before Rodriguez fired. But they maintained\n\nthat neither Johnson nor anyone else crossed the center line of the road before\n\nRodriguez fired.\n\n      a. James Tyler\n\n      Tyler, Danaher\u2019s best friend, testified that Danaher had not yet stepped into\n\nthe road when Rodriguez first drew his gun, but Tyler acknowledged that he did\n\nnot see Rodriguez draw the gun. On cross-examination, Tyler admitted that after\n\nhe watched the video, he realized that Danaher was in the road when Rodriguez\n\nfirst drew his gun. According to Tyler, Rodriguez put the gun down when Danaher\n\nbacked off, but Tyler did not see where Rodriguez put the gun.\n\n      Tyler testified that no one was talking about rushing Rodriguez or taking the\n\ngun from him, but he acknowledged that in the moments before Rodriguez fired,\n\nJohnson walked towards Rodriguez at a \u201cpretty rushed pace,\u201d \u201ccackling and\n\nlaughing with his arms waving in the air, like he thought it was funny, being goofy\n\nfor the camera, and then [Danaher] followed immediately behind him.\u201d According\n\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\fto Tyler, Danaher moved toward Rodriguez to try to stop Johnson, and Tyler\n\nmoved forward to pull Danaher back, but Danaher had already been shot.\n\n      Tyler testified that when the shots were fired, he was still standing at the\n\nedge of Storm\u2019s driveway, and Danaher and Johnson were \u201cmaybe a step and a\n\nhalf, two steps into the street,\u201d but neither had crossed the center line on the road.\n\nTyler acknowledged that in his statement to police, he said that Johnson \u201ckind of\n\nran to [Rodriguez] to apprehend him and take [the gun] from him.\u201d\n\n      b. Marshall Stetson\n\n      Stetson, who is Danaher\u2019s wife\u2019s cousin, testified that as soon as he and\n\nDanaher walked out to the street, Rodriguez drew his gun and told them to get\n\nback. He testified that they were not in the street, but in the middle of the\n\ndriveway, when Rodriguez first drew the gun.\n\n      Stetson testified that when they approached, he could \u201cimmediately see\u201d that\n\nRodriguez had a gun on his left side. But he also testified that \u201cwhen he pulled it\n\nstraight out on us, that\u2019s the first time I seen it in the hand. He was pulling it out.\u201d\n\nAccording to Stetson, Rodriguez pulled the gun from a holster on the outside of his\n\npants, he did not see him move any clothing before drawing the weapon out, and\n\nthe gun was \u201cnot concealed\u201d and was \u201coutside his shirt.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f      Stetson did not remember Johnson laughing in the moments before\n\nRodriguez fired, but he was about an arms-length behind Johnson, on the phone\n\nwith the police, when Johnson took \u201ctwo steps\u201d toward Rodriguez and the shooting\n\nbegan. Stetson grabbed for Johnson\u2019s shirt, but Johnson fell on the other side of\n\nthe street, where Rodriguez was standing. According to Stetson, Johnson had not\n\ncrossed over the center line of the road and was still 10 to 12 feet from Rodriguez\n\nwhen Rodriguez fired. Stetson ran towards Rodriguez, grabbed for the gun and\n\nwas himself shot in the buttocks. He struggled with Rodriguez until Wilcox and\n\nStorm came to help.\n\n      On cross-examination, Stetson admitted that he told police in his initial\n\nstatement that Johnson took it upon himself to try to wrestle the gun away from\n\nRodriguez and was going after Rodriguez when Rodriguez fired. Rodriguez\u2019s\n\ncounsel cross-examined Stetson about whether Rodriguez\u2019s gun had been\n\nconcealed:\n\n      Rodriguez\u2019s counsel: Now, when you\u2014when you first walked down\n      that driveway and you and Kelly [Danaher] came upon Raul, however\n      far away you were from him, I believe you\u2014in\u2014in response to\n      questioning from Ms. Logan, you said that\u2014that the clothing that\u2014\n      that Raul had on made it so that you could see his weapon. Is that\n      what you're saying?\n\n      Stetson: No. I said the way he pulled his gun so quick, he didn\u2019t\u2014\n\n\n                                        10\n\f      Rodriguez\u2019s counsel: And that\u2019s\u2014this is kind of an important point,\n      and that\u2019s why I\u2019m bringing it up.\n\n      Stetson: All right.\n\n      Rodriguez\u2019s counsel: I believe that you said\u2014and correct me if I\u2019m\n      wrong. I believe you said in your testimony earlier today, when he\n      pulled it straight out, it was the first that you could see it?\n\n      Stetson: Yeah.\n\n      Rodriguez\u2019s counsel: All right. So your\u2014your testimony is that the\n      first time you saw the weapon is when Raul pulled it out and showed\n      it to you?\n\n      Stetson: Yeah, showed it to us.\n\n      c. James Storm\n\n      Storm, Danaher\u2019s father-in-law, testified that around midnight, he saw\n\nsomeone standing in the road and stopped. According to Storm, when Danaher\n\nwalked up and started talking to Rodriguez, Rodriguez pulled his gun, even though\n\nDanaher was not threatening or aggressive. Storm was \u201cpissed off\u201d when he saw\n\nRodriguez draw a gun. Although Rodriguez was saying he was in fear of his life,\n\nStorm \u201cdidn\u2019t know what he feared.\u201d\n\n      Storm eventually drove up the driveway because he believed everyone was\n\ngoing to let the police handle the situation. When he was walking across his porch\n\nto the front door, he heard three gunshots, and turned and ran back towards the\n\nroad. Storm denied that he was going in the house to get a gun.\n                                        11\n\f      d. Ricky Johnson\n\n      Johnson testified that he was intoxicated, and he did not remember the\n\ndetails of the incident.2 He did not know who had shot him, and he had no\n\nmemory of anything that happened before he was shot.\n\n      Johnson gave a statement 17 days after the shooting, which contained more\n\ndetail. Johnson admitted that his statement was based on his own recollection free\n\nfrom outside influences, because he had not talked to other witnesses at the time he\n\ngave it. In the statement, Johnson said that some people appeared to be arguing by\n\nthe road, and that he remembered a man standing in the road, but that he did not\n\nsee a gun. According to Johnson\u2019s statement, he was \u201cpretty sure\u201d that when he\n\ngot to the end of the driveway, the man said take two more steps and I\u2019ll shoot, and\n\nJohnson took two more normal steps. But Johnson also asserted in his statement\n\nthat he was 20 or 25 yards from Rodriguez when Rodriguez fired, and Johnson\n\ndisagreed that the video indicated he was much closer.\n\n      e. Brandon Wilcox\n\n      Wilcox testified that he walked toward the road when he heard arguing and\n\nlearned that someone had a gun. When Wilcox approached the road, he only saw\n\n\n2\n      Johnson was placed in a sedated coma for several days after the incident. The\n      coma was induced with Propofol, which can cause amnesia.\n\n                                        12\n\fRodriguez\u2019s flashlight and video camera, and did not know at the time whether\n\nRodriguez had drawn a gun.\n\n      Wilcox knew that others had called the police and believed they were on\n\ntheir way. He saw a flash and a pop, and he ran behind Stetson towards Rodriguez.\n\nStetson fell down, and Wilcox ended up on top of Rodriguez. Wilcox did not see\n\nJohnson charge Rodriguez, and believed he would have seen it if it happened.\n\n      Wilcox did not recall any discussion among the partygoers about rushing\n\nRodriguez. He testified that when someone on the video recording said, \u201cBrandon,\n\nBrandon, don\u2019t do it,\u201d it was probably in response to Wilcox\u2019s comment that\n\nRodriguez \u201cneed[ed] his ass kicked.\u201d\n\nTestimony of officers, investigators, & medical personnel\n\n      Deputy J. Soto with the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office testified that he did\n\nnot smell alcohol on Rodriguez, but Wilcox, who had been holding down\n\nRodriguez, smelled of alcohol and slurred his speech. Deputy Whitlock, who\n\naccompanied Deputy Soto, testified that partygoers were intoxicated.\n\n      Detective J. Brown of the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office testified that\n\nRodriguez had a concealed handgun license, although Brown did not recall seeing\n\nthe license itself. When Brown arrived at the scene, Rodriguez \u201cstill had a nylon\n\nholster on his belt.\u201d Brown testified that Rodriguez reported taking ASA,\n\n                                       13\n\fLisinopril, Norco, Paxil, methadone, Effexor, and Xanax, but Brown also testified\n\nthat he did not believe Rodriguez was intoxicated.\n\n      As part of the ensuing investigation, Brown and two other detectives\n\nwatched the video recording. Brown testified that the initial perception of all three\n\ndetectives was that someone was attacking Rodriguez when Rodriguez dropped the\n\ncamera and fired. Brown agreed that Rodriguez\u2019s broken leg constituted serious\n\nbodily injury. He testified that some of the partygoers smelled of alcohol and that\n\nsome marijuana was found at the party. He also testified that Danaher\u2019s level of\n\nintoxication was \u201crelatively high.\u201d\n\n      Pramod Gumpeni, an assistant medical examiner at the Harris County\n\nInstitute of Forensic Sciences, performed Danaher\u2019s autopsy. Danaher had two\n\ngunshot wounds, one to the chest and one to the right leg. Gumpeni concluded,\n\nbased on the lack of stippling on Danaher\u2019s skin, that the gun was at least 18 to 24\n\ninches away from Danaher when it was fired, but he admitted that he did not test\n\nDanaher\u2019s shirt for stippling or gunpowder residue.3        Gumpeni testified that\n\nDanaher had a blood alcohol content of .21.\n\n\n\n\n3\n      According to Gumpeni, stippling results when gunpowder particles contact the\n      skin.\n\n                                         14\n\fTestimony of neighbors\n\n      a. Ken Ellis\n\n      Ellis, who lived across the street from Rodriguez, testified that on the night\n\nof the party, he was on his porch around ten minutes before midnight and could\n\nhear music playing at Storm\u2019s house. Ellis saw Rodriguez leaving his property and\n\nshouting \u201cshut it down\u201d towards Storm\u2019s house. According to Ellis, Rodriguez\n\nwas waving his flashlight and walking angrily up the street. Ellis heard gunshots\n\nabout 10 or 15 minutes later.\n\n      b. Terry Hackathorn\n\n      Hackathorn, who lived with Ellis, testified about her conversation with\n\nRodriguez two months before the shooting in which Rodriguez encouraged her to\n\nget a concealed handgun license. She described Rodriguez as \u201cvery self-confident,\n\nvery assured\u201d and \u201cexcited\u201d during the conversation:\n\n      He had suggested I get hand\u2014a concealed handgun license. And I\n      told him I didn\u2019t want one. But he told me it would be my benefit,\n      because if I had a handgun and if I was in public anywhere, then if\n      anybody was, you know, bothering me and if I needed to shoot\n      somebody, that as long as I told the authorities that I was in fear for\n      my life and that I needed to defend myself, and that I believed they\n      had weapons and I stood my ground. And so I shot the son of a bitch.\n\n      Prosecutor: And he said that you could \u201cshoot the son of a bitch\u201d?\n\n      Hackathorn: Yes.\n\n                                        15\n\f       Prosecutor: Did he specifically say to you, to use the words \u201cin fear\n       of your life\u201d?\n\n       Hackathorn: Yes.\n\n       Prosecutor: And did it surprise you when he said this?\n\n       Hackathorn: No.\n\n       Prosecutor: Okay. And why not?\n\n       Hackathorn: Because he always stayed up-to-date on the law changes\n       when it came to owning handguns.\n\n       c. Pete Fornols\n\n       Fornols lived between the Danahers and Rodriguez. On the night of the\n\nparty, Rodriguez called Fornols three times before 8:00 p.m. Rodriguez asked\n\nwhether Fornols could hear \u201call of the loud s__t\u201d and whether Fornols would go\n\nwith Rodriguez to \u201cput a stop to this s__t\u201d if it kept going on. Rodriguez told\n\nFornols that he \u201cwould have [his] back,\u201d but Fornols \u201cdid not want to be a part of\n\nit.\u201d\n\n       Rodriguez went to Fornols\u2019s house around 8:30 p.m. According to Fornols,\n\nRodriguez was \u201crambling on about the noise and that . . . if I would go down there\n\nwith him, that once again that he would have my back . . . .\u201d Fornols testified that\n\nRodriguez seemed \u201caggressive. His eyes were bulgy, and he was in a\u2014almost like\n\na frantic stage, like, you know, he was just about to pop.\u201d Fornols testified that\n\n                                        16\n\fRodriguez had two weapons on him when he visited at 8:30: one handgun in the\n\nfront of his pants, and one in the back.    They were outside his t-shirt, which was\n\ntucked in, and in \u201cplain sight.\u201d\n\n      Fornols spoke to Rodriguez on the phone again after his 8:30 visit, and\n\nRodriguez was agitated that the police who had responded to the noise complaints\n\n\u201cdidn\u2019t do s__t. They came out here, they sat and they drove off.\u201d Rodriguez\n\nreturned to Fornols\u2019s house around 10:30 p.m. and asked Fornols to call the police\n\nto complain about the noise. Fornols placed the call anonymously, only to try to\n\ncalm Rodriguez.\n\n      Rodriguez called Fornols again at 11:13 p.m., 12:01 a.m. and 12:11 a.m., but\n\nFornols did not answer. When Fornols heard three gunshots around 20 minutes\n\nafter midnight, he looked out his window into Rodriguez\u2019s backyard to see if he\n\nwas out there \u201cshooting his gun off like he\u2019s done a lot.\u201d\n\n      Fornols also testified about his interaction with Rodriguez on the day before\n\nthe party. Danaher had come over to Fornols\u2019s house to borrow some tools.\n\nRodriguez arrived within two minutes after Danaher left and asked Fornols, \u201cWhat\n\ndid that cocksucker want?\u201d Fornols said that Danaher had borrowed some tools,\n\nand Rodriguez responded, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t loan that son of a b__ch sweat off my balls\n\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fif he was dying of thirst. He\u2019s one of the son of a b__ches that keep us awake at\n\nnight with loud music.\u201d\n\n                                      Discussion\n\n      Rodriguez argues that the trial court\u2019s guilt-innocence charge erroneously\n\nabrogated his justification defense in that it included incorrect and confusing\n\ninstructions regarding a qualification on self-defense. The State concedes that\n\nthere was charge error, but argues that the errors did not harm Rodriguez because\n\nhe was not entitled to a self-defense instruction in the first instance.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n      In analyzing a jury-charge issue, our first duty is to decide if error exists.\n\nSee Almanza v. State, 686 S.W.2d 157, 174 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985) (op. on reh\u2019g);\n\nTottenham v. State, 285 S.W.3d 19, 30 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet.\n\nref\u2019d). Only if we find error do we then consider whether an objection to the\n\ncharge was made and analyze for harm. Tottenham, 285 S.W.3d at 30; see also\n\nWarner v. State, 245 S.W.3d 458, 461 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (\u201cThe failure to\n\npreserve jury-charge error is not a bar to appellate review, but rather it establishes\n\nthe degree of harm necessary for reversal.\u201d).\n\n      \u201cThe degree of harm necessary for reversal depends upon whether the error\n\nwas preserved.\u201d Hutch v. State, 922 S.W.2d 166, 171 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).\n\n                                           18\n\fError properly preserved by a timely objection to the charge will require reversal\n\n\u201cas long as the error is not harmless.\u201d Almanza, 686 S.W.2d at 171. The Court of\n\nCriminal Appeals has interpreted this to mean that any harm, regardless of degree,\n\nis sufficient to require reversal. Arline v. State, 721 S.W.2d 348, 351 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1986). However, when the charging error is not preserved \u201cand the accused\n\nmust claim that the error was \u2018fundamental,\u2019 he will obtain a reversal only if the\n\nerror is so egregious and created such harm that he \u2018has not had a fair and impartial\n\ntrial\u2019\u2014in short \u2018egregious harm.\u2019\u201d Almanza, 686 S.W.2d at 171; see Nava v. State,\n\n415 S.W.3d 289, 298 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) (egregious harm \u201cis a difficult\n\nstandard to meet and requires a showing that the defendants were deprived of a fair\n\nand impartial trial.\u201d). Fundamental errors that result in egregious harm are those\n\nwhich affect \u201cthe very basis of the case,\u201d deprive the defendant of a \u201cvaluable\n\nright,\u201d or \u201cvitally affect his defensive theory.\u201d     Almanza, 686 S.W.2d at 172\n\n(citations and quotations omitted).\n\n      When considering whether a defendant suffered harm, the reviewing court\n\nmust consider: (1) the entire jury charge; (2) the state of the evidence, including the\n\ncontested issues and weight of probative evidence; (3) the argument of counsel;\n\nand (4) any other relevant information revealed by the record of the trial as a\n\nwhole. Id. at 171. The reviewing court must conduct this examination of the\n\n                                          19\n\frecord to \u201cilluminate the actual, not just theoretical, harm to the accused.\u201d Id. at\n\n174; see Nava, 415 S.W.3d at 298 (record must disclose \u201cactual rather than\n\ntheoretical harm\u201d).\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\n      Texas Penal Code Section 9.31(a) provides that a person is justified in using\n\nforce against another \u201cwhen and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the\n\nforce is immediately necessary to protect the actor against the other\u2019s use or\n\nattempted use of unlawful force.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 9.31(a) (West 2011).\n\nPenal Code Section 9.31(b)(5)(A) qualifies this defense. It states that the use of\n\nforce against another is not justified \u201cif the actor sought an explanation from or\n\ndiscussion with the other person concerning the actor\u2019s differences with the other\n\nperson while the actor was carrying a weapon in violation of Section 46.02.\u201d TEX.\n\nPENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 9.31(b)(5)(A) (West 2011).\n\n      A person violates Section 46.02 of the Penal Code if he intentionally,\n\nknowingly, or recklessly carries on or about his person a handgun, illegal knife, or\n\nclub if the person is not (1) on the person\u2019s own premises or premises under the\n\nperson\u2019s control; or (2) inside of or directly en route to a motor vehicle or\n\nwatercraft that is owned by the person or under the person\u2019s control. See TEX.\n\nPENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 46.02(a) (West Supp. 2014). Importantly, however, Section\n\n                                        20\n\f    46.02 does not apply to a person who \u201cis carrying a concealed handgun and a valid\n\n    license issued under Subchapter H, Chapter 411, Government Code, to carry a\n\n    concealed handgun.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 46.15(b)(6) (West Supp. 2014).\n\n    C. Analysis\n\n          1. Errors in the charge\n\n          The charge spanned 16 pages. The first three pages set forth the abstract law\n\n    of murder and applied the law of murder to the case. The next five pages set forth\n\n    the abstract law on self-defense and deadly force and applied this law to the case.\u201d4\n\n    Next came three pages of instructions regarding two qualifications on self-defense:\n\n    the \u201cdiscussion of differences\u201d qualification and provocation. The balance of the\n\n    charge contained general instructions and an extraneous offense instruction.\n\n          Rodriguez argues that the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding the \u201cdiscussion\n\n    of differences\u201d qualification contained multiple errors.            Among other things,\n\n4\n         One paragraph on page 4 instructed the jury not to consider whether Rodriguez\n         failed to retreat, noting that one \u201cwho has not provoked the person against whom\n         deadly force is used, and who is not engaged in criminal activity at the time the\n         deadly force is used is not required to retreat before using deadly force.\u201d The\n         parties devote little attention to this instruction, but we find it noteworthy insofar as\n         it, implicitly if not explicitly, instructs the jury that Rodriguez did not provoke\n         Danaher and that Rodriguez was not engaged in criminal activity at the time he\n         used deadly force against Danaher. This was confusing because later portions of\n         the charge posed those very questions: page 9 instructed the jury to consider\n         whether Rodriguez committed an offense by intentionally failing to conceal his\n         handgun or by carrying it while intoxicated, and pages 10-11instructed the jury to\n         consider whether Rodriguez provoked Danaher.\n\n                                                 21\n\fRodriguez complains that the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury on irrelevant\n\nprovisions of Penal Code Section 46.035, which defines the offense of unlawful\n\ncarrying of a handgun by a license holder. The State agrees that it was error to\n\ninclude the irrelevant provisions of Section 46.035. We agree with the parties that\n\nthe instructions regarding the \u201cdiscussion of differences\u201d qualification were\n\nerroneous.\n\n      The instructions appeared on page 9 of the charge. It said:\n\n             You are further instructed, as part of the law of this case, and as\n      a qualification of the law on self-defense, that the use of force by a\n      defendant against another is not justified if the defendant sought an\n      explanation from or discussion with the other person concerning the\n      defendant\u2019s differences with the other person while the defendant was\n      failing to conceal the handgun that he was carrying as a concealed\n      handgun license holder, in violation of the law.\n             A person commits an offense if, while the person was a holder\n      of a license to carry a concealed handgun, the person intentionally\n      failed to conceal the handgun.\n             A person commits an offense if, while the person was a holder\n      of a license to carry a concealed handgun, the person carried a\n      handgun and was intoxicated.\n             \u201cHandgun\u201d means any firearm that is designed, made, or\n      adapted to be fired with one hand.\n             If you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that\n      the defendant, Raul Rodriguez, did then and there on May 2 nd, 2010,\n      fail to conceal a handgun in violation of the law stated above, before\n      seeking an explanation from or discussion with the other person\n      concerning the defendant\u2019s differences with the other person, then you\n      will find against the defendant on the issue of self-defense.\n\n      The first paragraph tracks much of Section 9.31(b)(5)(A), but modifies its\n\n                                         22\n\ffinal clause. The purpose of the modification was to account for the fact that\n\nRodriguez was carrying a handgun \u201cas a concealed handgun license holder\u201d to\n\nwhom Section 46.02 would not apply, provided the handgun was concealed. See\n\nTEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 46.15(b)(6) (noting that section 46.02 does not apply to a\n\nperson who \u201cis carrying a concealed handgun and a valid license\u201d). The first\n\nparagraph ends with the phrase \u201cin violation of the law,\u201d which is superfluous and\n\nconfusing in light of the two paragraphs that follow.\n\n      The second and third paragraphs on page 9 are based on Section 46.035 of\n\nthe Penal Code, which defines the offense of unlawful carrying of a handgun by a\n\nlicense holder. The second paragraph is based on subsection (a), while paragraph\n\nthree was based on subsection (d). See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 46.035(a) (\u201cA\n\nlicense holder commits an offense if the license holder carries a handgun on or\n\nabout the license holder\u2019s person under the authority of Subchapter H, Chapter\n\n411, Government Code, and intentionally displays the handgun in plain view of\n\nanother person in a public place.\u201d), (d) (\u201cA license holder commits an offense if,\n\nwhile intoxicated, the license holder carries a handgun under the authority of\n\nSubchapter H, Chapter 411, Government Code, regardless of whether the handgun\n\nis concealed.\u201d) (West Supp. 2014). The inclusion of both paragraphs was error\n\nbecause, as the State concedes, \u201c[t]he commission of th[e] offense [of unlawful\n\n                                         23\n\fcarrying of a handgun by a license holder] . . . does not alter one\u2019s ability to invoke\n\nthe right to self defense . . . .\u201d5 It is a violation of Section 46.02, not Section\n\n46.035, that may abrogate a self-defense claim. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN.\n\n\u00a7 9.31(b)(5)(A) (discussion of differences qualification on self-defense applies if\n\nthe actor was carrying a weapon in violation of Section 46.02). In short, we agree\n\nwith the parties that the trial court erred in submitting the second and third\n\nparagraphs on page 9.\n\n      Rodriguez argues that the use in the final paragraph on page 9 of the word\n\n\u201cbefore\u201d was also erroneous. Section 9.31(b)(5)(A) applies if the actor sought a\n\ndiscussion of differences \u201cwhile . . . carrying a weapon in violation of Section\n\n46.02.\u201d See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 9.31(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). In light of\n\nthe evidence that Rodriguez\u2019s handguns were not concealed when he visited\n\nFornols a few hours before the shooting, Rodriguez argues that the application\n\nparagraph\u2019s use of \u201cbefore\u201d could have caused the jury to reject Rodriguez\u2019s self-\n\ndefense claim based on his failure to conceal his handguns while at Fornols\u2019s\n\nhome. The State disagrees, arguing that the jury could not have been misled in this\n\n5\n      Indeed, Section 46.035(h) states that it is a defense to a violation of Section\n      46.035(a) \u201cthat the actor, at the time of the offense, displayed the handgun under\n      circumstances in which the actor would have been justified in the use of force or\n      deadly force under Chapter 9.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 46.035(h) (West Supp.\n      2014).\n\n                                          24\n\fmanner because the paragraph refers expressly to May 2, while the visit to Fornols\n\ntook place at 8:30 p.m. on May 1.\n\n      The final paragraph on page 9 expressly referred to failing to conceal a\n\nhandgun on May 2nd, 2010. Because well-established law requires us to presume,\n\nin the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the jury followed the trial court\u2019s\n\ninstructions, we do not presume that the jury wrongly believed that it could convict\n\nbased on Rodriguez\u2019s failure to conceal his handguns at Fornols\u2019s home at 8:30\n\np.m. on May 1. Reeves v. State, 420 S.W.3d 812, 818 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013)\n\n(generally, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, appellate court assumes that\n\njury followed charge instructions).\n\n      We do, however, conclude that the use of \u201cbefore\u201d in the final paragraph on\n\npage 9 is, at a minimum, confusing in light of the use of \u201cwhile\u201d in the first and\n\nsecond paragraphs. If the jury believed that Rodriguez acted in self-defense, the\n\napplicability of Section 9.31(b)(5)(A) turned on whether Rodriguez\u2019s handgun was\n\nconcealed from the time he sought the discussion of differences until the moment\n\nthe jury determined he was justified in using force. Thus, it was critical for the\n\njury to determine when during the sequence of events Rodriguez failed to conceal\n\nhis handgun.\n\n      The charge fell short of making that clear. The first paragraph instructed the\n\n                                        25\n\fjury to consider whether Rodriguez sought a discussion of differences while failing\n\nto conceal the handgun he was carrying as a concealed handgun license holder; the\n\nsecond instructed it to consider whether Rodriguez failed to conceal while he was a\n\nholder of a license to carry a concealed handgun; and the final paragraph instructed\n\nit to consider whether Rodriguez failed to conceal before seeking a discussion of\n\ndifferences. This is far from \u201cthe way instructions should be\u2014clear, concise, and\n\nto the point.\u201d Reeves, 420 S.W.3d at 817, 818 (function of charge is not merely to\n\navoid misleading but to lead and to prevent confusion).\n\n      2. Did Rodriguez preserve error?\n\n      Having found error in the charge, we next consider preservation.\n\nTottenham, 285 S.W.3d at 30. The record reflects that Rodriguez lodged the\n\nfollowing objection to page 9:\n\n            [B]asically, Judge, I think this is improper comment on the\n      weight of the evidence. Also, I don\u2019t think the evidence supports this\n      charge in this case.\n            Specifically, there\u2019s absolutely no evidence that\u2014or credible\n      evidence that Raul Rodriguez failed to conceal his firearm or that he\n      was intoxicated.\n            All right. So let me take both of those if I can, one-by-one.\n            Failure to conceal a handgun. There was some testimony from\n      Pete\u2014Peter Fornols . . . . And he testified at some point early in the\n      evening. This is before the shooting ever occurred or Raul ever went\n      over next door. That Raul Rodriguez had two handguns in plain view.\n      One was in the front center waistband, one was to his back center\n      waistband.\n            And\u2014and so that has no relevance as to the time of the\n                                        26\n\f      shooting, if Raul was legally carrying a firearm. In other words, at the\n      time of self-defense when he shot the weapon, was he unlawfully\n      displaying a firearm, that would negate that. And so that testimony\n      doesn\u2019t really relate to that at all.\n             The only other testimony was, Marshall Stetson said something\n      on direct examination about how Raul Rodriguez had a firearm and it\n      was visible. And it was a little unclear what he said.\n             But Bill Stradley cross-examined him. And he clearly said,\n      based on my recollection, that what he meant was, he saw the firearm\n      when Raul Rodriguez had actually drawn it on Kelly Danaher. And\n      so, therefore, I don't think there\u2019s any credible evidence that Raul\u2014\n      and the State\u2019s theory has never been that he didn\u2019t conceal the\n      handgun.\n             And so with that, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s evidence that supports\n      the instruction. And I also think it\u2019s an improper comment on the\n      weight of the evidence.\n\n      The State argued in favor of submitting page 9 as it was ultimately\n\nsubmitted:\n\n             In Section 931(b), Number 5A, it talks about carrying a weapon\n      in violation of the law. In order to explain what violation of the law is\n      and tracks the statute, that\u2019s where we proposed unlawfully carrying a\n      weapon by a concealed handgun license holder.\n             And the Court, as you know, is required to put an instruction in,\n      if there\u2019s some evidence, whether believable or not. And there was\n      evidence by Marshall Stetson and by Pete Fornols, that indicated the\n      defendant was carrying a weapon that was visible.\n             So if the jury, who is going to be the trier of fact, determines\n      that they\u2019re in violation based upon the instruction, that\u2019s their\n      decision to make.\n      ....\n\n             [I]t tracks the original charge instruction. Tracks the statute and\n      since there\u2019s some evidence that in our particular case, the defendant\n      has a concealed handgun license. That\u2019s why we clarified it. Because\n      if you just give it to the jury in violation of the law, they need to be\n                                         27\n\f      instructed on what that law is.\n\n      The trial court then made the following ruling:\n\n              Well, I heard the testimony. And Fornols is one thing, statute is\n      another. And he clearly said, \u201cI\u2014first time I saw it is when he pulled\n      it out.\u201d But anyway, be that as it may. He said other things too.\n              So, the issue\u2019s been raised and y\u2019all are just going to have to\n      argue the fact question. But I think the issue\u2019s been raised, so I\u2019m\n      going to allow that. Objection\u2019s overruled.\n\n      Error preservation \u201cis not an inflexible concept.\u201d Thomas v. State, 408\n\nS.W.3d 877, 884 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). \u201c[A]ll a party has to do to avoid the\n\nforfeiture of a complaint on appeal is to let the trial judge know what he wants,\n\nwhy he thinks himself entitled to it, and to do so clearly enough for the judge to\n\nunderstand him at a time when the trial court is in a proper position to do\n\nsomething about it.\u201d Id. (quoting Lankston v. State, 827 S.W.2d 907, 909 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1992)).\n\n      Here, Rodriguez argued that page 9 should not be submitted to the jury at\n\nall, because the evidence did not support the submission, and because the\n\ninstructions constituted an improper comment on the weight of the evidence. He\n\nargued that the instructions would allow the jury to incorrectly reject his claim of\n\nself-defense based on testimony regarding his alleged failure to conceal during his\n\nvisit to Fornols\u2019s house at 8:30 p.m.\n\n      The State responded that the charge should include the violation of law\n                                         28\n\finstructions contained in the second and third paragraphs. It argued that Pete\n\nFornols\u2019s testimony to the effect that Rodriguez\u2019s handguns were not concealed\n\nhours before the shooting was at least some evidence that supported submission of\n\nthe instructions it now concedes were erroneous. The trial court agreed with the\n\nState and overruled the objection.       Although Rodriguez did not parse the\n\ninstruction and detail each of the errors in it, we conclude that his objection was\n\nsufficient to preserve the error he complains of on appeal. See Clark v. State, 365\n\nS.W.3d 333, 339 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012) (noting that issue preserved without\n\nhaving been explicitly stated if \u201cthere have been statements or actions on the\n\nrecord that clearly indicate what the judge and opposing counsel understood the\n\nargument to be\u201d); Lankston, 827 S.W.2d at 909 (in issue-preservation context,\n\nthere are \u201cno technical considerations or form of words to be used\u201d); see also State\n\nv. Rosseau, 396 S.W.3d 550, 555 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) (although defendant\u2019s\n\nchallenge \u201ccould have been more clearly presented,\u201d \u201cmagic language\u201d was not\n\nrequired).\n\n      3. Were the errors harmless?\n\n      Because Rodriguez preserved his complaint, we must reverse unless the\n\nerror is harmless. See Almanza, 686 S.W.2d at 171; see also Arline, 721 S.W.2d at\n\n351 (any harm, regardless of degree, is sufficient to require reversal). To gauge\n\n                                        29\n\fharm, we review (1) the entire jury charge; (2) the state of the evidence, including\n\nthe contested issues and weight of probative evidence; (3) the argument of counsel;\n\nand (4) any other relevant information revealed by the record of the trial as a\n\nwhole. See Almanza, 686 S.W.2d at 171.\n\n         a. The entire charge\n\n      Rodriguez argues that the errors on Page 9 harmed him in two ways:\n\n(1) paragraphs two and three allowed the jury to conclude that either Rodriguez\u2019s\n\nintoxication or his failure to conceal a handgun, alone, would render his use of\n\nforce unjustified; and (2) the erroneous use of \u201cbefore\u201d in the final paragraph\n\nallowed the jury to conclude that his use of force was not justified because he\n\nfailed to conceal his handguns earlier in the evening, while talking with Fornols.\n\n      As discussed above, the inclusion of the phrase \u201cin violation of the law\u201d in\n\nthe first paragraph, followed by paragraphs two and three, which have no place in\n\nthe instruction, permitted the jury to find against Rodriguez on self-defense if,\n\nduring the discussion of differences, he either (1) \u201cintentionally failed to conceal\u201d\n\nthe handgun or (2) was intoxicated. The jury heard Rodriguez admit on the video\n\nrecording that he intentionally drew his handgun and, thus, \u201cintentionally failed to\n\nconceal\u201d it during the altercation. Under the trial court\u2019s charge, that bare fact was\n\nsufficient to abrogate Rodriguez\u2019s self-defense claim, regardless of whether the\n\n                                         30\n\fjury believed Rodriguez was justified in using deadly force. Nothing in the charge\n\nameliorated this problem. Indeed, the final paragraph on page 9 exacerbated it by\n\nreferring the jury back to the violations of the law \u201cstated above.\u201d\n\n      The State contends that the errors on page 9 actually benefitted Rodriguez\n\nand increased the State\u2019s burden. It argues that the jury could have believed that it\n\nmust find for Rodriguez on the discussion of differences qualification unless the\n\nState showed that Rodriguez intentionally failed to conceal and was intoxicated.\n\nThis is a plausible interpretation of the charge, and it could be the one the jury\n\nadopted. While we cannot know how the jury interpreted page 9, we know for\n\ncertain\u2014and the State concedes\u2014that it was confusing. This is enough to weigh\n\nin favor of finding some harm. See Reeves, 420 S.W.3d at 818 (function of charge\n\nis to \u201cprevent confusion\u201d).\n\n      b. The evidence\n\n      The second Almanza factor likewise weighs in favor of finding some harm.\n\nRodriguez conceded that he shot Danaher, and the evidence regarding Rodriguez\u2019s\n\nonly defense, self-defense, was conflicting.      On the one hand, the partygoers\n\nuniformly testified that they never got close to Rodriguez, emphasizing that they\n\ndid not cross the center line onto Rodriguez\u2019s side of the street before he began\n\nfiring. The State also adduced evidence that Rodriguez told Hackathorn that, with\n\n                                         31\n\fthe benefit of a concealed handgun license, one could shoot somebody and get\n\naway with it by telling the authorities that she was in fear for her life and needed to\n\ndefend herself.    This evidence supported the State\u2019s theory that Rodriguez\n\nmanufactured his self-defense claim.\n\n      On the other hand, the evidence showed that before Rodriguez first drew his\n\ngun, Danaher, at least, had crossed the center line and approached Rodriguez, that\n\nStorm and multiple partygoers threatened Rodriguez with bodily injury, and that\n\nRodriguez in fact sustained serious bodily injury, a broken leg. The evidence also\n\nshowed that, immediately before Rodriguez fired, Johnson suddenly and loudly\n\ncharged Rodriguez, with his friends following closely behind. Both Johnson and\n\nStetson fell on the side of the street where Rodriguez had been standing, and the\n\nforensic testimony showed that Danaher, who was behind Johnson, could have\n\nbeen as close as 18 inches to Rodriguez when he was shot.\n\n      Given the conflicting evidence, we conclude that conviction was not a\n\nforegone conclusion absent the charge error, and that this factor supports reversal.\n\nSee, e.g., Burd v. State, 404 S.W.3d 64, 74\u201375 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2013, no pet.) (finding harm sufficient to warrant reversal where self-defense was\n\nonly issue in case, charge contained error regarding self-defense, and evidence\n\nregarding events that led to shooting conflicted).\n\n                                          32\n\f       c. Counsel\u2019s argument\n\n       The State began its closing by arguing that Rodriguez believed that his\n\nconcealed handgun license conferred special privileges and that Rodriguez lied\n\nabout fearing for his life. The State then told the jury that Rodriguez had no right\n\nto self-defense because he armed himself, sought an explanation, and did not\n\nretreat:\n\n             Then starting on Page 9 of your charge, will be a portion that\n       deals with arming yourself and seeking the difficulty, or seeking an\n       explanation for the difficulty.\n             This is one of the two factors that you find in this charge that\n       takes away this defendant\u2019s right to self-defense. Because he armed\n       himself, because he went down the road to seek an explanation,\n       because he did not abandon his efforts to get an answer out of Kelly\n       Danaher, he has no right to self-defense.\n\nThe State thus advanced an incorrect, or at least incomplete, argument regarding\n\nthe limitations on Rodriguez\u2019s claim of self-defense.           This argument also\n\ncontradicted the instruction on page 4 to the effect that the jury should not consider\n\nRodriguez\u2019s failure to retreat.\n\n       Defense counsel argued in closing that the handgun was not visible before\n\nRodriguez drew it. He said: \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no credible evidence in this case\n\nthat [Rodriguez] walked over there with a gun on his hip that people saw and then\n\nhe pulled it on Kelly Danaher. . . . Raul Rodriguez is in the street and everything\n\nhe\u2019s done is legal. It\u2019s a public road. He has his gun concealed. He has a\n                                         33\n\fconcealed handgun license.\u201d\n\n      Following the defense closing, the State again argued the issue of\n\nconcealment:\n\n      They brought up the fact that Marshall Stetson made comments during\n      closing\u2014or excuse me, on cross, that he couldn\u2019t see a weapon. Well,\n      you\u2019ll remember on direct, Donna asked him, \u201cHe pulled it straight\n      out. It\u2019s the first time I seen it in his hand.\u201d \u201cCould you tell whether it\n      was one of those holsters that goes inside your pants, on the outside or\n      the inside?\u201d \u201cIt was on the outside.\u201d\n\n      We know from the evidence that he didn\u2019t pull his shirt back. We\n      know that he pulled the gun right out. We know that right there, use\n      your common sense, he didn\u2019t go down there with a jacket on in May.\n      He went down there as a person who knew exactly what he was going\n      to do.\n\n      In short, the State, in closing, misstated the law regarding the qualification\n\non self-defense and highlighted the issue of the handgun\u2019s concealment, which was\n\nerroneously addressed in the charge. The third factor thus weighs in favor of\n\nfinding some harm.\n\n      d. Other information in the record\n\n      We find two jury questions also weigh in favor of finding some harm.\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury asked whether a holster had been \u201ctaken into\n\nevidence.\u201d Detective Brown had testified that Rodriguez had a holster on his belt\n\nat the time of the shooting, and Stetson testified that Rodriguez drew his gun from\n\na holster. However, Fornols testified that, when Rodriguez visited him four hours\n                                          34\n\fearlier, Rodriguez\u2019s two guns were in his waistband, and did not mention a holster.\n\nThe question suggests that the jury reached and was focused on the issue of\n\nconcealment.\n\n      The jury also asked to see Rodriguez\u2019s medical records. Rodriguez argues\n\nthat this demonstrates the jury was focused on the question of his intoxication, an\n\nissue wrongly submitted in the third paragraph of page 9. The State points out that\n\nthe jury may have wanted the records to verify Rodriguez\u2019s claimed disability. We\n\ncannot and need not discern the reason for the jury\u2019s inquiry; it is enough that the\n\njury asked for evidence that related to the erroneous intoxication instruction. See,\n\ne.g., Villarreal v. State, 205 S.W.3d 103, 110 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2006, pet.\n\ndism\u2019d) (jury note was evidence that jury considered erroneous instruction and\n\nsupported finding of egregious harm).\n\n      Although all of the Almanza factors point toward the conclusion that the\n\ncharge errors harmed Rodriguez, the State argues for the first time on appeal that\n\nRodriguez was not entitled to a self-defense instruction at all. Therefore, the\n\nState\u2019s argument goes, the errors in the qualification instructions could not have\n\ncaused harm. Specifically, the State contends: (1) Rodriguez does not dispute that\n\nhe sought a discussion of differences while carrying a weapon; and (2) there is no\n\nevidence that Rodriguez was carrying a concealed handgun or a concealed\n\n                                        35\n\fhandgun license as provided by Section 46.15(b)(6); therefore, Section\n\n9.31(b)(5)(A) conclusively applied to prohibit submission of self-defense.\n\n      The State\u2019s argument raises the question of whether it was Rodriguez\u2019s\n\nburden to raise evidence demonstrating that Section 46.15(b)(6) applied. While it\n\nis well-settled that a defendant bears the burden of adducing some evidence to raise\n\na defense, see, e.g., Zuliani v. State, 97 S.W.3d 589, 594 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003),\n\nfew cases address the burden to adduce evidence to raise an exception to a\n\nqualification of a defense such as Section 46.15(b)(6).\n\n      In post-submission briefing, the parties pointed us to Barron v. State, No.\n\n05-08-00637-CR, 2010 WL 1294078 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas Apr. 6, 2010, pet. ref\u2019d).\n\nIn Barron, the court of appeals held that the trial court properly denied a self-\n\ndefense instruction.    Barron, 2010 WL 1294078, at *3. But in Barron, the\n\nevidence established as a matter of law that Barron sought an explanation or\n\ndiscussion of differences with the complainant while illegally carrying a handgun;\n\nthere was \u201cno evidence presented at trial to establish that [Barron] qualified for the\n\ntraveling exception or that he held a license to carry the handgun used in the\n\nshooting.\u201d Id. Thus, the court concluded that there was no fact issue raised\n\nregarding Section 9.31(b)(5)(A); Barron was not justified in using force as a matter\n\nof law. Id.\n\n                                         36\n\f      This case is different. First, the State introduced Rodriguez\u2019s concealed\n\nhandgun license records and emphasized to the jury that Rodriguez was a\n\nconcealed handgun license holder. Second, the State adduced evidence regarding\n\nwhether Rodriguez\u2019s gun was concealed. This mattered only if Rodriguez was\n\nlicensed to carry the gun and the jury was being asked to decide whether the\n\nhandgun was properly concealed. Third, the State proposed the jury instruction\n\nincorporating the Section 46.15(b)(6) exception, and the trial court obliged.\n\nRodriguez could have and would have tried the case differently (i.e., by offering\n\nadditional evidence to raise Section 46.15(b)(6)) if the State had not conducted\n\nitself as if it agreed that a fact issue concerning Section 46.15(b)(6) had been\n\nraised. Because the State conducted itself as it did, it is estopped from reversing\n\ncourse now. See, e.g., Reed v. State, 14 S.W.3d 438, 442 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2000, pet. ref\u2019d) (where State requested defendant undergo psychiatric\n\nexamination, State was estopped from claiming on appeal that there was no\n\nevidence to show a bona fide doubt as to defendant\u2019s competence). We therefore\n\nreject the State\u2019s argument that Rodriguez suffered no harm because he was not\n\nentitled to a self-defense instruction in the first instance.6 See id.\n\n\n6\n      The State also relies upon Davis v. State, 276 S.W.3d 491 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco\n      2008, pet. ref\u2019d), and Williams v. State, 35 S.W.3d 783 (Tex. App.\u2014Beaumont\n\n                                           37\n\f      In sum, the trial court\u2019s erroneous charge caused Rodriguez some harm\n\nbecause Rodriguez conceded that he shot Danaher, and his claim of self-defense\n\nwas thus the focus of, and, indeed, \u201cthe very basis of the case.\u201d Almanza, 686\n\nS.W.2d at 172.     The errors were not cured by other instructions or closing\n\nargument, the evidence on self-defense was conflicting, closing argument\n\nhighlighted the issues addressed in the erroneous instructions, and questions from\n\nthe jury demonstrated that it focused on the erroneous instructions during\n\ndeliberations. See Almanza, 686 S.W.2d at 171; see also Arline, 721 S.W.2d at\n\n351 (any harm, regardless of degree, is sufficient to require reversal).\n\n      We sustain Rodriguez\u2019s first issue. Because we have found that the guilt-\n\ninnocence charge error regarding the discussion of differences qualification on\n\nself-defense warrants reversal, we need not consider Rodriguez\u2019s remaining issues.\n\n\n\n\n      2001, pet. ref\u2019d), to support its argument that self-defense should not have been\n      submitted. But these cases, like Barron, are inapposite, because in each, the State\n      proved as a matter of law that the defendant could not lawfully carry a gun.\n\n                                          38\n\f                                    Conclusion\n\n      We conclude that the charge error related to self-defense, Rodriguez\u2019s sole\n\ndefense, was not harmless. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the trial court\n\nand remand for a new trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                            Rebeca Huddle\n                                            Justice\n\nPanel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Massengale and Huddle.\n\nPublish.
