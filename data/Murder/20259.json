L\u00f3pez, Justice\r\n\r\nSitting:\tPhil Hardberger, Chief Justice\r\n\r\n\t\tTom Rickhoff, Justice\r\n\r\n\t\tAlma L. L\u00f3pez, Justice\r\n\r\nDelivered and Filed:\tNovember 10, 1999\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\tIn appeal No. 04-98-000691-CR, Nathan Fernandez challenges his conviction for murder in\r\nCause No. 98-01-0014-CRA.   In appeal No. 04-98-000692-CR, Fernandez challenges his conviction\r\nfor aggravated assault in Cause No. 98-01-0015-CRA. Both offenses were tried in a single\r\nproceeding before a jury. Fernandez raises the same issues in both appeals.\r\n\r\nAccomplice Testimony\r\n\r\n\tIn his first issue, Fernandez contends that the State's evidence was insufficient to support his\r\nconvictions because it was based on uncorroborated testimony of the State's accomplice witness,\r\nReynaldo Cuellar, Jr.   Like Fernandez, Cuellar was charged as a defendant in these offenses.\r\nCuellar, however, agreed to testify against Fernandez and to plead  guilty to the offense of aggravated\r\nassault in exchange for the State's agreement to dismiss his murder charge.\r\n\r\n\tAt trial, Cuellar testified about a shooting incident that occurred at the home of J.D. Gonzales\r\nand that resulted in the death of one victim and the wounding of another person. During his\r\ntestimony, Cuellar described a verbal altercation between himself and Gabriel Garcia, and J.D.\r\nGonzales and John Shawn Martin, that escalated to the point that J.D. and Martin drove by Garcia's\r\nhome and fired a shot towards the house. Fernandez's younger brother, Rudy, was among those who\r\nwere present when this occurred.  Cuellar further explained how shortly after this incident, he met\r\nup with Fernandez, Gabriel, and Gabriel's younger brother, Eric. He described how the four of them\r\nwere angry about the shooting at J.D.'s house and how they drove to a location near J.D.'s house\r\nwith the intention of fighting with J.D. As they approached J.D.'s house, however, they determined\r\nthat too many people were at J.D.'s house to initiate a fight. Cuellar testified that when they returned\r\nto his truck to depart the area, Fernandez stated that no one was going to shoot at his brother and get\r\naway with it. Fernandez then asked him for his (Cuellar's) gun and that he gave Fernandez the gun.\r\nCuellar stated that he then followed Fernandez back to J.D.'s house and observed him aim the gun,\r\nhearing gun shots almost simultaneously. Both he and Fernandez ran back to the truck and took off\r\nfor his (Cuellar's) house. Cuellar testified that during the ride home, Fernandez twice stated that he\r\nhad shot the gun and that nobody was going to mess with his family.\r\n\r\n\tFernandez argues that without Cuellar's testimony, the State's evidence did not connect him\r\nto the offenses. Fernandez relies on the accomplice witness rule embodied in article 38.14 of the\r\nTexas Code of Criminal Procedure. Article 38.14 provides:\r\n\r\n\tA conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless corroborated\r\nby other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the offense committed;  and\r\nthe corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense.\r\n\r\n\r\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.14 (Vernon 1979).  To review this challenge, the reviewing\r\ncourt must eliminate the accomplice testimony from consideration and then determine whether other\r\ninculpatory evidence tends to connect the defendant to the offenses. See Richardson v. State, 879\r\nS.W.2d 874, 880 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993). The court may consider all the facts and circumstances\r\nin evidence as furnishing the corroboration necessary.  Reed v. State, 744 S.W.2d 112, 126 (Tex.\r\nCrim. App. 1988). The corroborative evidence may be circumstantial or direct. Reed, 744 S.W.2d\r\nat 126. The corroboration need not directly link the accused to the crime or be sufficient in itself to\r\nestablish guilt. Id.\r\n\r\n\tAfter reviewing the record, we find that the following corroborating testimony tended to\r\nconnect Fernandez to the shooting incident. First, Gabriel testified that he overheard Fernandez ask\r\nCuellar for his gun. He also testified that Fernandez was mad because they [J.D. and Martin] had\r\nshot at his little brother. Gabriel further testified that, prior to the shooting, he heard Fernandez state\r\nthat no one was going to mess with his family, and that after the shots were fired, Fernandez stated,\r\n\"That's what they get. They don't f--- with my family.\"\r\n\r\n\tIn addition, Eric Garcia testified about the incident during which J.D. fired a shot at Gabriel's\r\nhouse. Eric confirmed that Fernandez's little brother was present when the incident occurred and that\r\nFernandez was angry because his younger brother was present. He also stated that although he had\r\nleft the area before the second shooting incident, Fernandez told him two days later that he was\r\npresent during the shooting and that he had provided the police with a written statement saying that\r\nFernandez admitted to him that he did the shooting.\r\n\r\n\tState's witness, Melissa Cruz, provided additional inculpatory, corroborating evidence.  Cruz\r\ntestified that she was outside her home when she heard shots being fired. Immediately afterwards,\r\nshe observed two men run down the alleyway from the direction of J.D.'s house. She identified the\r\ntwo men as Fernandez and Cuellar. In addition, Martin testified that both Cuellar and Fernandez\r\nwanted to fight J.D. He testified that he overheard Fernandez state, \"I would do it,\" and that he\r\n(Martin) understood Fernandez to mean that he would shoot J.D. He also testified that a couple of\r\nweeks after the shooting incident, Fernandez admitted to him that he had done the shooting and that\r\nhe was having trouble sleeping as a result. Because all of the above testimony corroborated Cuellar's\r\ntestimony about what occurred and tended to connect Fernandez to the offenses, we overrule\r\nFernandez's fist issue.\r\n\r\nFactual Sufficiency\r\n\r\n\tIn his second issue, Fernandez attacks the factual sufficiency of the evidence. To make this\r\nchallenge, Fernandez relies on the inconsistencies between the testimonies of eye witnesses, and the\r\ntestimonies of Fernandez and his mother about the clothing he was wearing on the night of the\r\nshooting, and the unreliability of the testimonies discussed above.\r\n\r\n\tTo review a factual sufficiency challenge, the reviewing court reviews all evidence without\r\nthe prism of  \"in the light most favorable to the prosecution\" and sets aside the verdict only if it is\r\nso contrary to the overwhelming weight of evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.  Clewis v.\r\nState, 922 S.W.2d 126, 129 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996). Although some inconsistencies exist in the\r\ntestimonies of the numerous witnesses in this case, the over-whelming weight of the evidence\r\nindicates that Fernandez fired the gun that resulted in the death of one victim and the wounding of\r\nthe other person. Because the evidence indicates that Fernandez fired the gun, we overrule\r\nFernandez's second issue.\r\n\r\n\tHaving overruled both of Fernandez's issues, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlma L.
