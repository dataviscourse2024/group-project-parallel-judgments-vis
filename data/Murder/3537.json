            "opinion_text": "\nOPINION\nMcKEAGUE, Circuit Judge.\nDefendant-Appellant Tyrone Davenport and twenty-eight codefendants were charged in a 147-count superseding indictment. Although Davenport initially faced thirteen counts, he entered into a plea agreement where he pleaded guilty to three counts in exchange for the Government dismissing the remaining counts against him. Davenport\u2019s plea agreement did not include a provision for the Government to make a motion for downward departure from the federal sentencing guide*501lines, and prior to sentencing, Davenport challenged the Government\u2019s \u201crefusal to hear defendant\u2019s proffer and its consequent refusal to make a substantial assistance motion\u201d as a violation of his right to equal protection. On appeal, Davenport argues that the district court erred in finding that the Government\u2019s refusal to accept Davenport\u2019s proffer did not violate the Constitution. We AFFIRM.\nI. BACKGROUND\nFrom 2003 to 2008, Davenport worked for a drug-trafficking organization operating in the Columbus, Ohio, area. R. 1225, Change of Plea Tr. at 24; 28. Davenport\u2019s duties included selling and accepting shipments of cocaine and marijuana as well as selling kilogram quantities of both drugs. Id. at 25-26. On December 4, 2008, the Federal Bureau of Investigation executed a search warrant at Davenport\u2019s residence and seized $498 in illegal narcotics proceeds, approximately 21 grams of cocaine, scales with residue, a vice, a gram of marijuana, and a heat lamp. Id. at 26.\nOn February 26, 2009, the Grand Jury returned a superseding indictment against Davenport and twenty-eight co-defendants. R. 33, Superseding Indictment. On July 2, 2009, Davenport pleaded guilty to the forfeiture count as well as two drug counts in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(ii), and 846. In exchange, the Government dismissed the other counts against him. R. 554, Plea Agreement. The plea agreement did not include a provision for \u201cany type of motion for downward departure pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, or Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure-\u201d Appellee Br. at 2; see also R. 1225 at 22.\nPrior to sentencing, Davenport filed a sentencing memorandum. R. 1069, Sentencing Memorandum. In his sentencing memorandum, Davenport asserted that \u201c[pjrior ro [sic] his guilty pleas, Tyrone entered into a plea agreement which, among other items, addressed a potential \u00a7 5K1.1 Motion if he provided information of substance and assistance to the government,\u201d but \u201cthe government decided not to even speak with Tyrone Davenport.\u201d Id. at 3. Further, Davenport noted that several of his co-defendants had already been sentenced, and \u201c[t]he majority of those similarly situated were given the benefit of \u00a7 5K1.1 Motions....\u201d Id. Davenport claimed that the Government refused his proffer because one of the prosecutors, Assistant United States Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d) David DeVillers, had a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d against him. According to Davenport:\nSubsequent to signing the plea agreement, it was discovered that AUSA De-Villers had no intention of permitting Davenport to proffer and thus avail himself to a possible \u00a7 5K1.1 Motion.... The AUSA\u2019s position arose from his pri- or contact with Mr. Davenport in 2002 while an assistant Franklin County Prosecutor. In 2002 Tyrone, along with two (2) other individuals, was indicted for Aggravated Murder. The case was prosecuted by David De[V]illers. As a result of the severance motion, one of the co-defendants was tried first and acquitted of the crime. Tyrone\u2019s case was subsequently dismissed and refiled. AUSA DeViller[s\u2019s] refusal to allow Davenport to proffer was based on his personal animosity toward Mr. Davenport. Defendant believes that it is a violation of his right to equal protection because of a personal vendetta by a AUSA [sic].... Tyrone Davenport was denied his right to be treated as other similarly situated defendants.... As a result, the Court\u2019s hands are tied by the mandatory minimum ten (10) year prison sentence.\nId. at 6-7.\nAt Davenport\u2019s sentencing hearing, his sentencing memorandum was discussed at *502length. Davenport\u2019s counsel began by apologizing to AUSA DeVillers and stating that \u201c[t]here was no intent in that sentencing memorandum of indicating at all that Mr. DeVillers in any way acted unethically.\u201d R. 1226, Sentencing Tr. at 15-17. Rather, the sentencing memorandum\u2019s goal was simply to \u201cpoint[ ] out ... the problems with 5K and the unrestrained discretion that it gives the government. ...\u201d Id. Davenport\u2019s counsel then opined that the mandatory minimum is \u201ca problem. It\u2019s unfortunately a statutory problem, and that\u2019s not the Court\u2019s problem, but it still is a problem.\u201d Id. at 17.\nThe district court noted that whether the government files a \u201cmotion under 3553(e) as the guideline 5K1.1 ... [is] a matter committed to the discretion of the government,\u201d and asked: \u201cWhat authority, if any, would I even have here to pursue a hearing on this if I were so inclined?\u201d Id. at 18. Davenport\u2019s counsel responded: \u2018Tour Honor, I\u2019m not saying that the Court has [that authority]. I think it\u2019s important for the Court to know in terms of the global look at Mr. Davenport and his willingness, you know, part of the willingness to proffer goes far and beyond the normal acceptance of responsibility.\u201d Id. Davenport\u2019s counsel further stated that \u201cwhen you look at him [Davenport] under the various considerations of 3553(a), I think Mr. Davenport is one who is salvageable. ... However, I do realize the Court\u2019s hands are tied by the statute at this point in time.\u201d Id. at 19.\nIn response, AUSA DeVillers made clear that Davenport\u2019s allegations were false. Davenport\u2019s 2002 case was prosecuted in Franklin County, Ohio; although AUSA DeVillers once worked in the Franklin County prosecutor\u2019s office, DeVil-lers was working with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office as of 2000. Id. at 20. AUSA DeVil-lers also explained that, even though he was not involved in Davenport\u2019s 2002 prosecution, the prior homicide was one of the reasons the United States did not seek cooperation from Davenport. That is, because the prior homicide investigation remained open and Davenport\u2019s homicide charges were dismissed before the trial began, Davenport could still be re-charged with that offense. Id. Before Davenport entered his plea agreement, the Government made clear that the homicide would be discussed should Davenport be debriefed, and Davenport indicated that he was unwilling to be questioned about the homicide. Id. Therefore, the United States decided not to pursue a proffer and informed Davenport of its decision before he entered the plea agreement. Id. at 21. Finally, the Government noted that Davenport \u201chas a prior aggravated trafficking conviction.\u201d Id. Accordingly, if Davenport \u201cchose not to plead guilty and go to trial, we would file that enhancement, and the defendant would be facing a mandatory minimum of 20 years as opposed to 10 years. So that was, I guess, our stick, if you will, to induce a plea....\u201d Id.\nThe district court then computed Davenport\u2019s sentencing guideline range. Given Davenport\u2019s final offense level of 29 and criminal history category of IV, the district court found that the guideline range was 120 to 150 months, coupled with the mandatory minimum of a 120-month sentence for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Id. at 22. After finding no appropriate departure basis, the district court then reviewed the section 3553(a) factors. Id. In particular, the district court highlighted \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities involving defendants with similar records and similar pasts.\u201d Id. at 24. The district court found that \u201c[t]he degree of cooperation, of course, is a major factor. In this case there was not cooperation sufficient to obtain a motion from the government to reduce the sentence.\u201d Id. The district court also stated:\n*503I do want to spend a moment talking about the issue [regarding] whether or not the defendant had an opportunity to cooperate. As a starting matter, of course, the government\u2019s decision whether to file such a motion is something that Congress has given to the government and the government alone. It is not reviewable by me unless there is some unconstitutional type of deprivation taking place, which I don\u2019t have any sense has occurred in this case. How the government uses the authority, of course, is a very important decision for it to make. But I find nothing in this case that would indicate to me that there was any sort of matter ... that I can consider or would wish to consider regarding Mr. DeVillers\u2019s conduct or involving the way the defendant was either given or denied an opportunity to cooperate. So I don\u2019t find that ... factor would affect the sentence.\nId. at 25. The district court then imposed the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence. Id.\nDavenport timely appealed. On appeal, Davenport argues:\nThe sole issue presented is whether defendant is entitled to remand for an evidentiary hearing to show that the government, in its refusal to hear defendant\u2019s proffer and its consequent refusal to make a substantial assistance motion on defendant\u2019s behalf, treated the defendant dissimilarly from similarly situated co-defendants for no reason rationally related to legitimate government ends.\nAppellant Br. at 1; see also id. at 16.\nII. ANALYSIS\nDavenport\u2019s appeal raises the issue of whether the district court erred in refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the Government\u2019s rejection of Davenport\u2019s willingness to proffer as a part of its section 3553(a) analysis before imposing Davenport\u2019s sentence. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s sentence for procedural and substantive unreasonableness under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. See, e.g., United States v. Alexander, 543 F.3d 819, 821-22 (6th Cir.2008). A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if, inter alia, the district court failed to properly calculate the Guidelines range, treated the Guidelines range as mandatory, failed to consider section 3553(a) factors, used clearly erroneous facts in imposing the sentence, or failed to adequately explain the sentence. Id. at 822. A sentence is substantively unreasonable if the district court arrives at a sentence arbitrarily, uses impermissible sentencing factors, fails to consider relevant sentencing factors, or gives unreasonable weight to any one factor. United States v. Baker, 559 F.3d 443, 448 (6th Cir.2009). This Court reviews a constitutional challenge to a defendant\u2019s sentence de novo. See United States v. Crowell 493 F.3d 744, 749 (6th Cir.2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1105, 128 S.Ct. 880, 169 L.Ed.2d 739 (2008).\nAs the Supreme Court has clearly established, \u201cfederal district courts have authority to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive. Thus, a defendant would be entitled to relief if a prosecutor refused to file a substantial-assistance motion, say, because of the defendant\u2019s race or religion.\u201d Wade v. United States, 504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). A defendant is also entitled to relief if the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion is not rationally related to any legitimate Government end. Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 464-65, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991). However, the defendant has the burden of making a substantial threshold showing: \u201ca claim that a defendant merely provided *504substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Nor would additional but generalized allegations of an improper motive.\u201d Wade, 504 U.S. at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840.\nDavenport failed to produce a cognizable allegation that the Government\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion was based on an unconstitutional motive. Davenport\u2019s generalized allegations fall short of meeting his burden of making a substantial threshold showing. Further, the Government offered two constitutionally acceptable reasons that distinguished Davenport from his co-defendants. First, when the Government raised the possibility of a proffer, Davenport refused to cooperate with the Government about the 2002 murder. R. 1226, p. 20. Second, the Government chose not to pursue a proffer because of Davenport\u2019s prior convictions. Id. at 21. Consequently, the district court properly exercised its authority under Wade. Accordingly, we find that Davenport\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable. See Alexander, 543 F.3d at 822.\nWe also find no grounds for challenging the substantive reasonableness of Davenport\u2019s sentence. Even though Davenport urged the district court to consider the Government\u2019s rejection of his proffer as a sentencing factor, the district court\u2019s refusal to consider this issue as relevant to Davenport\u2019s acceptance of responsibility does not amount to a \u201cfailure] to consider relevant sentencing factors.\u201d See Baker, 559 F.3d at 448. Assuming, without deciding, that a defendant\u2019s inability to proffer constitutes a relevant sentencing factor, the district court thoroughly considered the issue at the sentencing hearing. Indeed, even though the district court ultimately determined that Davenport\u2019s inability to proffer would not affect his sentence, R. 1226 at 25, the district court discussed the situation with both parties at length before analyzing the section 3353(a) factors and sentencing Davenport. In doing so, the district court did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentence.\n",
