Adofo Minka was held in direct criminal contempt by Hinds County Circuit Court\n\nJudge Jeff Weill Sr. for unprofessional and contumacious behavior during the trial of his\n\nclient which resulted in a mistrial. Minka was fined $100 and ordered to pay the costs of the\n\njury in the amount of $1,350. Minka appeals to this Court, claiming (1) he did not\n\nimproperly comment during opening statements on a potential sentence his client might\n\freceive, which triggered a sua sponte objection from the trial court and was a key basis for\n\nthe State\u2019s request(s) for a mistrial; (2) Minka\u2019s comments do not warrant criminal sanction\n\nbecause counsel have broad latitude during opening statements and closing arguments; (3)\n\nthe record does not support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that any of Minka\u2019s\n\ncomments or conduct constitute criminal contempt; and (4) even if this Court affirms the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s contempt and sanction order, the monetary fine was $650 more than it should have\n\nbeen; therefore, the sanction amount must be reversed, lowered, and rendered.\n\n\u00b62.    We find no merit in any of the points of contention argued by Minka on appeal. The\n\nrecord1 before this Court proves Minka is guilty of criminal contempt beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. And the trial court had the authority to issue a monetary fine and costs in the amounts\n\nimposed. Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s contempt and sanctions order.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n\u00b63.    On November 18, 2015, Minka appeared before Hinds County Circuit Court for the\n\ncriminal trial of his client William Wilson, charged with the crime of felon in possession of\n\na firearm. After the State concluded its opening statement, Minka began his opening\n\nstatement, saying:\n\n       I\u2019ve sat through just listening to the State\u2019s opening statement. I\u2019ve sat over\n       at the defense counsel table and I\u2019ve talked to my client. And as I sat over\n\n       1\n          The record includes only a transcript of the proceedings that occurred during\nopening statements and closing arguments, along with what the trial court stated into the\nrecord after granting the State\u2019s request for a mistrial in the underlying criminal case. No\ntranscripts were provided for either the State\u2019s or the criminal defendant\u2019s case-in-chief.\nThere is also an audio recording of the proceedings, which, like the transcripts contained in\nthe record, covers only what occurred during opening statements and closing arguments.\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       there, I\u2019ve been trying to take care of my fear. Fear is such a harrowing\n       emotion. It grabs you, it takes hold of you; it can control you.\n\n\u00b64.    At that point, the trial court interjected and asked defense counsel and counsel for the\n\nState to approach the bench. Citing Rule 3.02 of the Uniform Rules of Circuit and County\n\nCourt Practice (URCCC), the trial court told Minka that his argument was \u201cnot appropriate\n\nargument[; t]he purpose of opening statement is to lay out what you believe the evidence will\n\nshow.\u201d The court said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where this is headed, but it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s\n\nheaded toward the evidence.\u201d Minka responded, \u201cIt\u2019s headed there Judge. . . . I\u2019m going to\n\nmove quickly through this, Judge. I\u2019m not going to take time. I understand what you\u2019re\n\nsaying.\u201d The court replied, \u201cAll right. Well it\u2019s not just a question of time. This is not an\n\nemotional appeal, this is a laying out of the evidence. And so I\u2019m just telling you, you need\n\nto not only move along, but move into what you expect the evidence will show.\u201d\n\n\u00b65.    Minka resumed his opening statement:\n\n       Sorry ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I\u2019m just trying to have a conversation\n       with you. You\u2019ve heard the prosecution\u2019s story of this case. But fortunately\n       ladies and gentlemen of the jury, there\u2019s two sides to every story. The\n       prosecution wants you to merely believe that this is a case about somebody\n       who is convicted of a felony and they were in possession of some firearm.\n       According to what the prosecution is saying the evidence will show, my client\n       . . . over there, should already be on the bus to Parchman Penitentiary. Simple\n       enough: right? Wrong.\n\n\u00b66.    The trial court again interjected and asked counsel for both parties to approach the\n\nbench. The court instructed Minka not to go into what potential sentence the defendant\n\nmight face. A back-and-forth ensued between Minka and the trial court, with Minka denying\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fhe had commented on any potential sentence his client faced. The trial court said its ruling\n\nhad been made and told Minka to finish his opening statement.\n\n\u00b67.    After the bench conference concluded, Minka said aloud in front of the jury, \u201cI want\n\nthe record to reflect that I never . . . made any statements . . . about . . . .\u201d The trial court told\n\ncounsel to approach the bench.\n\n\u00b68.    The court warned Minka that if he interrupted the court again and continued to talk\n\nafter being instructed by the court not to, there would be serious consequences. The court\n\nthen instructed Minka to finish his opening statement.\n\n\u00b69.    Minka continued his opening statement, saying:\n\n       This is not what that case is about ladies and gentlemen. The case theory,\n       that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. This case is about unrestrained and unchecked\n       power. It is about the power of the vice and narcotics task force and bout [sic]\n       the power of the district attorney\u2019s office represented by Mr. Smith and Mr.\n       Muccllouch [sic] sitting over here. It is about how power only cares about\n       taking care of itself. It\u2019s about power betraying our trust. During the course\n       of this trial you\u2019re going to hear from men who represent the powerful entities\n       ....\n\n\u00b610.   The State requested a bench conference and objected to Minka\u2019s statement on the\n\nground it was improper. The trial court asked Minka to explain why his statement was not\n\nimproper. Minka responded:\n\n       Because I said they [will] hear from the people coming up here, what the\n       evidence [will] show. You want me to say what the evidence [will] show?\n       Would that make the Court feel more comfortable?\n\n\u00b611.   The trial court sustained the State\u2019s objection, and instructed Minka to proceed.\n\nContinuing with his opening statement, Minka said to the jury:\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f       Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I\u2019m just interested in the truth. I\u2019m just\n       trying to tell you what the evidence in this case is going to show. During the\n       course of this trial, you\u2019re going to hear from detectives who give voice to the\n       power of the Narcotics and Vice Task Force of the Jackson Police Department.\n       During the course of this trial, you\u2019re going to hear about how the Vice and\n       Narcotics Task Force of the Jackson Police Department betrayed our trust.\n       They betrayed our trust by hunting and surveilling [my client] over there until\n       they had a grand \u2013 until they believed that they had a grand opportunity to\n       ensnare him. You\u2019re going to hear about how the vice and narcotics task force\n       betrayed our trust when they relied on the unreliable evidence of a snitch.\n       Then the prosecutor, they have betrayed our trust \u2013\n\n\u00b612.   The State objected, and the trial court sustained the objection. Minka then asked if\n\nthey could approach the bench. The trial court excused the jury, and a lengthy bench\n\nconference ensued.\n\n\u00b613.   The State argued that Minka was attempting to bias the jury or appeal to their\n\nsympathy, which was inappropriate. The State also argued that Minka had opened the door\n\nfor the State to introduce otherwise inadmissible drug evidence into the case. Minka\n\nresponded that he had no objection to any such evidence being introduced by the State, and\n\nhe planned to talk to the jury about that during his opening statement. The trial court first\n\nqueried Minka about the dispensation pertaining to the drug evidence. Afterward, the trial\n\ncourt addressed the State\u2019s objection regarding Minka\u2019s other remarks, which the record\n\nprovides as follows:\n\n       THE COURT: All right. Now as far as the rest of the objection of the State,\n       I do find that it\u2019s an improper objection -- I mean it\u2019s an improper argument.\n       Your argument is at full throttle. It talks about fearing the powerful, and it\u2019s\n       a completely inappropriate opening statement. You need to simply lay out what\n       you believe the evidence will show without reference to -- hyperbole, there\n       may be a place for that in closing argument, I\u2019m not foreclosing that. But when\n       you when you [sic] say that the prosecutors sitting at this table have betrayed\n       trust, that\u2019s way out of bounds, even for closing argument. So I\u2019m going to\n\n                                              5\n\fsustain the objection. And I\u2019m going to caution you to lay it out in a\nprofessional and calm manner, what you expect the evidence to show. You\u2019ve\ngot an opportunity to do it. And if you can\u2019t refrain from that, you\u2019re not going\nto go further with your opening statement. Are we clear on that?\n\nMR. MINKA: I don\u2019t understand what I\u2019ve done wrong.\n\nTHE COURT: I\u2019m sorry?\n\nMR. MINKA: I do not understand what I have done wrong, Judge. I do not\nunderstand what is improper. I do not understand what is wrong with saying\nthat \u2013 what is wrong with the truth. I don\u2019t understand that, Judge. If the\nDA\u2019s office is not powerful then I won\u2019t say it. But they are powerful.\nThey\u2019re powerful enough to have this man sitting over here today on charges.\n\nTHE COURT: There\u2019s a way to do it right and there\u2019s a way not to do [sic].\nAnd you\u2019re not doing it right.\n\nMR. MINKA: Can you instruct me \u2013\n\nTHE COURT: Excuse me. It\u2019s really important that you not interrupt me Mr.\nMinka. That\u2019s really important. If you do it again I\u2019m going to find you in\ncontempt. Now the way opening statement works, and has in every trial I\u2019ve\never had in my courtroom - - many of which [your co-counsel] has participated\nin, you have not yet - - you lay out in a calm professional way what you expect\nthe evidence to show; and without going into an emotional appeal to the biases\nthat the jury may hold. To appeal to any sense of fear that they may have of\nthe powerful and so forth, is just not an appropriate opening statement. I don\u2019t\nknow how further to explain it to you \u2013\n\n...\n\nMR. MINKA: My tone is inappropriate, Judge?\n\nTHE COURT: I\u2019m sorry?\n\nMR. MINKA: My tone is inappropriate?\n\n...\n\nTHE COURT: [Your] tone is inappropriate.\n\n\n\n                                       6\n\f       MR. MINKA: You want me to talk like he was talking? What tone is\n       appropriate Judge? I\u2019m not being fecetious [sic]. I really want to understand.\n       Because you telling me \u2013\n\n       THE COURT: Well, I mean, your tone right now it\u2019s like my tone. It\u2019s not - -\n       I don\u2019t have a raised voice, I\u2019m not making an appeal to emotion. So that\u2019s\n       what you need to do with your tone. Lower your tone.\n\n       ...\n\n       MR. MINKA: I do not understand, Judge. I do not understand. I don\u2019t know\n       what rule it says that you cannot raise your voice; that you cannot speak from\n       passion. I don\u2019t \u2013 I never seen a rule, a rule of court that has instructed\n       attorneys that they can not speak from passion, Judge. If you can show it to\n       me, I\u2019ll sit up there and I\u2019ll speak monotonely. But I don\u2019t believe that, that\n       rule exists.\n\n       ...\n\n       MR. MCCULLOUCH: Your Honor, we feel under the . . . Uniform Rules of\n       Circuit and County Court Procedure [(URCCC)] under 10.03, that opening\n       statement should be only what the - - either the State or the Defense believes\n       the evidence will show. And it\u2019s our opinion, Your Honor, that defense\n       counsel may be trying to provoke a mistrial. I\u2019m not sure. But if we get in\n       front of the jury with these kinds of theatrics, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to\n       end up happening.\n\n\u00b614.   At that point, the trial court read to counsel Rules 10.03 and 3.02 of the Uniform\n\nRules. The trial court then stated, \u201cNow I\u2019ll let you respond, and then we\u2019ll move on.\u201d\n\n       MR. MINKA: Judge, I sincerely would like to know who have I disrespected?\n       Who have I disrespected on the jury? Who have I disrespected at counsel\n       opposite\u2019s table? I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m just trying to get an understanding.\n\n       THE COURT: All right. You\u2019ve disrespected the Court. You\u2019ve disrespected\n       the attorneys sitting at counsel by saying that they\u2019ve betrayed somebody.\n       You\u2019ve disrespected the Court when you came to the podium a little while ago\n       during your opening statement, and I ruled against you, you glared at me in full\n       view of the jury as you walked back to the podium. That\u2019s inappropriate and\n       it\u2019s unprofessional. And I won\u2019t allow it in my courtroom. Now if you can\n       comport yourself with Rule 3.02 and the other Rule, 10.03, I\u2019ll allow you to\n\n                                              7\n\f       finish your opening statement. If you can\u2019t I\u2019ll either \u2013 I\u2019ll give you an\n       opportunity to let [co-counsel] attempt to do so in an attempt to display\n       professionalism \u2013 which you so far have lacked in my courtroom in this\n       setting \u2013 I\u2019ll give him that opportunity. But if you can tell me you can proceed\n       professionally, I\u2019ll allow it. If you tell me you don\u2019t understand or you cannot\n       proceed in accordance with the Court\u2019s ruling, I\u2019ll give [co-counsel] an\n       opportunity to speak. And if he declines we\u2019ll just move on with testimony.\n       So what\u2019s your response?\n\n       MR. MINKA: Judge, I just want the record to reflect you said that I glared at\n       you. Judge, you looked me directly in my eye, and because you wanted me to\n       know that I understand what you were saying. It was not a glare; it was not out\n       of disrespect. And I do believe that I can continue and carry on with opening\n       statement, Judge.\n\n       THE COURT: Very well. I\u2019ll give you one more opportunity to do that.\n\n\u00b615.   The jury was brought back into the courtroom. Minka then concluded his opening\n\nstatement as follows:\n\n       Good afternoon again, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Ladies and gentlemen\n       of the jury, I wish that I could have a honest conversation with you. But I\n       can\u2019t. So, I can\u2019t. So, I\u2019m going to take my seat now.\n\n\u00b616.   The trial proceeded to the evidentiary phase, the transcript of which was not included\n\nwith this record. After the close of evidence, the State presented its closing argument.\n\nMinka then delivered his closing argument, as follows:\n\n       Good morning ladies and gentlemen of the jury. How y\u2019all doing this morning?\n       Glad I get another chance to talk to y\u2019all about this case. Y\u2019all have heard\n       from the State. Y\u2019all heard from Mr. Spore back there. I hope I get a full\n       opportunity to tell you about this case. In the course of these types of cases\n       when you defending people, when you here in the courtroom, you get to learn\n       a lot. You get to learn a lot about different, a lot of different things. You get\n       to learn a lot about the people who you represent. It\u2019s funny that when Mr.\n       McCulloch [sic], when he got up here, he talked about this case is not about\n       drugs. But throughout this whole case, they have maligned Mr. Wilson as a\n       gun-totting drug dealer. They wanted to get at your emotions. They wanted you\n       to think that Mr. Wilson was a gun-toting drug dealer, and then stand up here\n\n                                              8\n\f       and tell you, oh, this is not about drugs and guns necessarily. But we have to\n       ask the question: Is that necessarily true? He\u2019s not here convicted -- I mean,\n       he\u2019s not here accused of selling drugs; no, he\u2019s not. He\u2019s here accused of\n       possession of a weapon and being a felon. We understand that. We understand\n       that. But what we also have to understand, is how we got here. I talked to you\n       -- I tried to talk to you at the beginning of this case about power. I tried to talk\n       to you about the nature of power and how power exercises itself. And our\n       power can sometimes be reckless and abusive. And I know that you-all\n       understand that -- because I remember going back to voir dire when we were\n       talking to you about believing and having faith in the police officers and their\n       ability to investigate cases and having skills and all of that kind of stuff. And\n       we\u2019re going to talk about that. We're going to talk about the credibility of the\n       witness that you heard from throughout this trial. But first I want to talk about\n       this so-called drug raid, this big drug bust. And it really is a cover up, these\n       charges against\n       --\n\n\u00b617.   The State objected, and a bench conference ensued. The State argued Minka was\n\narguing facts not in evidence. Minka replied he was talking about the drug raid which was\n\nin evidence, and he complained the State was interrupting his closing argument even though\n\nhe did not interrupt the State\u2019s. The trial court sustained the State\u2019s objection, finding \u201cno\n\nevidence from the witness stand concerning the assertions made by counsel.\u201d\n\n\u00b618.   The trial court allowed Minka to continue his closing argument. The record provides\n\nas follows:\n\n       MR. MINKA: I just want to tell you the truth of this case ladies and\n       gentlemen, but I\u2019m not being allowed to tell you the truth.\n\n       THE COURT: Y\u2019all approach.\n\n       MR. MINKA: But I\u2019m not going back \u2013\n\n       THE COURT: Excuse me \u2013\n\n       MR. MINKA: \u2013 and sit down this time \u2013\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f       THE COURT: Excuse me \u2013\n\n       MR. MINKA \u2013 I\u2019m a tell you the truth \u2013\n\n       THE COURT: Y\u2019all approach.\n\n\u00b619.   The trial court excused the jury from the courtroom, and found on the record as\n\nfollows:\n\n       Pursuant to Rule 3.02, the Court intervened in that the defense counsel was\n       inappropriately commenting on perceived inability to present an argument to\n       the jury.\n\n       And I want to make sure that counsel understand that, that\u2019s inappropriate.\n       And the Court made an appropriate ruling\u2013subject to appellate review \u2013 and\n       that ends the matter. And for defense counsel to stand before the jury and say\n       that he\u2019s not being allowed to make an argument, is also inappropriate.\n\n\u00b620.   The trial court asked whether Minka understood the inappropriate nature of the\n\nargument and whether Minka could proceed with an appropriate closing argument. Minka\n\nclaimed he was not being given a fair opportunity to make his closing argument and represent\n\nhis client. He maintained that nothing he had said was improper. He said he understood the\n\ncourt\u2019s ruling, but he also understood the need to represent his client, and stated \u201cI\u2019m going\n\nto represent my client.\u201d He then said:\n\n       The Court should do what the Court has to do. But I have to represent that\n       man. That man\u2019s liberty is on the line, and I\u2019m go[ing to] represent him. And\n       I[] ask this Court to be fair and just with me.\n\n\u00b621.   At that point, the State moved for a mistrial, stating:\n\n       The State feels like that the defense has, from the beginning of opening,\n       attempted to throw a mistrial. Which now the State is required -- we feel like\n       we\u2019re required and do make a motion for mistrial based on the defense\n       attorney\u2019s failure to follow the rules of circuit and county court procedures.\n       Specifically, I think, it was [Rules] 3.02 and 10.3, regarding openings. And\n\n                                             10\n\f       we\u2019ve been prejudiced in that it now appears that the State and the Court are\n       somehow conspiring against the defense and the defense team, to get a\n       conviction. And, Judge, this just does not follow the general rules of decorum\n       set forth in the Rules of Circuit and County Court Procedure [sic], or the code\n       of professional conduct. So for these reasons we would ask for a mistrial in\n       this case.\n\n\u00b622.   Minka told the court he did not agree with the State\u2019s allegation; but he did not have\n\nanything to say on the State\u2019s request for a mistrial. Minka said he wanted the record to\n\nreflect that he had not been unprofessional and had not accused anyone of \u201cconspiring\n\nagainst somebody.\u201d He just wanted to say to the jury \u201cwhat\u2019s in the facts.\u201d\n\n\u00b623.   The trial court said, \u201cSo you don\u2019t oppose the State\u2019s motion for a mistrial?\u201d Minka\n\nreplied, \u201cNo, I do not.\u201d\n\n\u00b624.   The trial court said he would take the State\u2019s request under advisement. The court\n\nthen said to Minka:\n\n       And as I weigh my options, I need you to simply say whether or not you\u2019re\n       going to, in finishing this closing argument - - should I decide to allow you to\n       continue - - whether you\u2019re going to stay away from any comment about this\n       process and about the Court\u2019s rulings and about your inability to present an\n       argument. What\u2019s your response to that? Are you going to obey an order of\n       the Court not to do so?\n\n\u00b625.   Minka replied, \u201cYes, I\u2019m going to advocate for my client. That\u2019s what I\u2019m [going to]\n\ndo.\u201d The trial court responded, \u201cAll right. Even if that means commenting on the ruling of\n\nthe Court?\u201d Minka said he had not commented on a direct ruling from the court, and stated:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve commented on the obstructionist nature of the State obstructing my attempts to try to\n\nmake an argument to the jury.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f\u00b626.   The trial court then explained to Minka that in the event a mistrial was declared, the\n\ncourt could require Minka to pay for the jury panels which have to be dismissed because of\n\nMinka\u2019s unprofessional and obstreperous conduct. The court then asked Minka once more\n\nwhether he would obey the court\u2019s orders. The following exchange occurred.\n\n       MR. MINKA: Judge, let me tell you something judge.\n\n       THE COURT: I\u2019m listening.\n\n       MR. MINKA: I have said that I\u2019m going to advocate for my client. And that\u2019s\n       what I\u2019m here to do; that\u2019s my job. I\u2019m going to do my job, Judge. That\u2019s all\n       I can tell you. And in terms of -- Judge, I\u2019m getting real scared here. You\n       threatening me and I\u2019m getting real scared. And it\u2019s going along the lines of\n       this ineffective assistance of counsel thing \u2013\n\n       THE COURT: All right. I don\u2019t need to hear anymore argument. Please sit\n       down.\n\n\u00b627.   Following a brief recess, the trial court granted the State\u2019s motion for a mistrial \u201cbased\n\non counsel\u2019s willful efforts to cause that mistrial as evinced by, among other things, his\n\nbehavior in court.\u201d The trial court detailed in the order Minka\u2019s actions and found that\n\nMinka\u2019s conduct and behavior was \u201cin direct violation of the rules of court and it\n\nsuccessfully resulted in a mistrial, the motion for which the defense counsel did not oppose.\u201d\n\n\u00b628.   The trial court ordered Minka to pay a $100 fine. The court also ordered Minka to pay\n\nfor the cost of the jury \u201cin the total amount of $1,350.00, as his willful and improper\n\nbehavior, which he refused to correct despite multiple opportunities from the court . . . to do\n\nso, resulted in the abrupt termination of the trial[.]\u201d\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f\u00b629.   \u201cDirect criminal contempt includes words or actions before the court that tend to\n\nembarrass the court or prevent the orderly administration of justice.\u201d Harris v. State, 2017\n\nWL 58190, *1 (Miss. 2017) (quoting Mingo v. State, 944 So. 2d 18, 32 (Miss. 2006)). In\n\nreviewing matters that involve a conviction for criminal contempt, \u201c[t]his Court is not bound\n\nby the manifest error rule[; i]nstead, this Court proceeds ab initio to determine whether the\n\nrecord proves the appellant guilty of contempt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Spore v. State,\n\n214 So. 3d 223. 226 (Miss. 2017) (quoting In re Smith, 926 So. 2d 878, 885 (Miss. 2006)).\n\n       I.     The record supports finding Minka guilty of direct criminal\n              contempt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\u00b630.   Minka argues the trial court erroneously found him in contempt of court for\n\ncommenting on a potential sentence his client could receive, which Minka says did not occur\n\nbecause the \u201cbus to Parchman\u201d statement he made did not invoke a precise number of years.\n\nAccording to Minka, pursuant to Marks v. State, 532 So. 2d 976, 983 (Miss. 1988), only\n\n\u201carguments which refer to the potential sentence in a given case\u201d are improper. Minka\n\nfurther contends that the \u201cMarks rule\u201d (as he terms it) should not apply to defense counsel\n\nbecause the rule\u2019s purpose, according to Minka, is to act as a shield for defendants in a\n\ncriminal case, not as a sword against them. Minka submits that, since the State sought to\n\nconvict the defendant, he logically did not violate any rule by mentioning that the State\n\nwished his client jailed.\n\n\u00b631.   At the outset, Marks does not hold or suggest that the rule against improper arguments\n\nreferring to potential sentences applies only to prosecutors. Marks simply addressed the\n\nmatter from the standpoint of the defendant because that was who complained on appeal.\n\n\n                                             13\n\f\u00b632.   At issue in Marks was whether the trial court erred in refusing to declare a mistrial\n\ndue to statements made by the prosecutor in closing arguments concerning a potential\n\nmanslaughter sentence in lieu of a sentence for murder.2 Id. at 983. No contemporaneous\n\nobjection was made by the defense following the prosecutor\u2019s statements; instead, the\n\ndefense moved for a mistrial. The trial court found the prosecutor\u2019s argument was improper\n\nbut declined to order a new trial on this ground. Affirming the trial court\u2019s decision on direct\n\nappeal, the Marks Court reiterated that \u201c[t]he problem with arguments such as these is that\n\nthey invite the jury to convict with regard to the punishment, not with regard to evidence\n\nbefore them, and the jury should have no concern with the quantum of punishment to be\n\nimposed.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b633.   The concern expressed in Marks with such arguments is not unilateral, as Minka\n\nwould have this Court hold. The general rule prohibiting argument to a nonsentencing jury\n\nregarding a defendant\u2019s potential punishment upon conviction of the crime(s) charged applies\n\nto both the prosecution and the defense. King v. State, 784 So. 2d 884 (Miss. 2001).\n\n\u00b634.   In King, this Court held that, during closing arguments in the sentencing phase where\n\nthe death penalty is an option, both the defense and the State may argue for or against the\n\ndeath penalty pursuant to Mississippi Code Section 99-19-101(1). Id. at 889-90. This\n\nincludes \u201cmercy or sympathy\u201d arguments from the defense, and \u201csend a message\u201d arguments\n\nfrom the State. Id. at 890. \u201cOf course, neither side may ever argue these positions during the\n\nguilt phase; for a conviction or an acquittal must be based solely on law and fact.\u201d Id.\n\n       2\n       The defendant in Marks was charged with murder, and the prosecution argued for\na murder conviction during closing arguments. Marks, 532 So. 2d at 983.\n\n                                              14\n\f\u00b635.   This is in line with what the United States Supreme Court has held with regard to\n\nfederal criminal trials. \u201cWhen a jury has no sentencing function, it should be admonished\n\nto \u2018reach its verdict without regard to what sentence might be imposed.\u201d\u2019 Shannon v. United\n\nStates, 512 U.S. 573, 579, 114 S. Ct. 2419, 129 L. Ed 459 (1994) (quoting Rogers v. United\n\nStates, 422 U.S. 35, 40, 95 S. Ct. 2091, 45 L. Ed 2d 1 (1975)) (footnote omitted).\n\n\u201cInformation regarding the consequences of a verdict is therefore irrelevant to the jury\u2019s\n\ntask.\u201d Shannon, 512 U.S. at 579. And providing jurors with information about a\n\ndefendant\u2019s potential sentence during trial \u201cinvites them to ponder matters that are not within\n\ntheir province, distracts them from their factfinding responsibilities, and creates a strong\n\npossibility of confusion.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b636.   Here, Minka\u2019s \u201cbus to Parchman\u201d comment did not refer to a specific sentence his\n\nclient might receive.     But the comment\u2013even if rhetorical hyperbole\u2013was improper,\n\nparticularly when considered alongside Minka\u2019s other statements and conduct.\n\n\u00b637.   As the State points out on appeal, Minka presented \u201ca variety of contemptuous\n\nbehavior which ultimately resulted in a mistrial.\u201d According to the record, Minka made\n\nseveral other inappropriate statements before the jury which included, but were not limited\n\nto, stating and insinuating that the prosecution had betrayed the jury\u2019s trust and that both the\n\nprosecution and the trial court were preventing Minka from informing the jury of the truth.\n\n\u00b638.   Rule 3.02, which governs conduct of attorneys in the courtroom, provides in part:\n\n       Attorneys should manifest an attitude of professional respect toward the judge,\n       the opposing attorney, witnesses, defendants, jurors, and others in the\n       courtroom. In the courtroom, attorneys should not engage in behavior or tactics\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f       purposely calculated to irritate or annoy the opposing attorney and shall\n       address the court, not the opposing attorney, on all matters relating to the case.\n\n       ...\n\n       In opening statements, and in closing arguments, the attorneys may not attack\n       the opposing attorney. . . . In the argument to the jury, the attorneys will be\n       required to keep within proper bounds, and any attempt to inject improper\n       matter may be stopped by the court without the necessity of an objection. . . .\n\n       ...\n\n       It is the duty of the court to enforce this rule of its own motion and without\n       objection being made, but the court\u2019s failure to do so, where there is no\n       objection made, will not constitute a ground for exception.\n\nURCCC 3.02. (emphasis added).\n\n\u00b639.   Attorneys \u201care not allowed to employ tactics which are \u2018inflammatory, highly\n\nprejudicial, or reasonably calculated to unduly influence the jury.\u2019\u201d Flowers v. State, 842\n\nSo. 2d 531, 553 (Miss. 2003) (quoting Sheppard v. State, 777 So. 2d 659, 661 (Miss. 2001)).\n\nMinka\u2019s declaration to the jury during opening statements that the prosecution had betrayed\n\nits trust falls in that category. And the trial court properly admonished Minka for it.\n\n\u00b640.   The record illustrates that Minka, however, disregarded the court\u2019s admonition and\n\nsuggested to the jury later during opening statements and again during closing arguments that\n\nhe was not being allowed to tell them the truth. Contrary to what Minka claimed to the trial\n\ncourt and attempts to claim here, the record\u2013as the State points out\u2013does indeed demonstrate\n\nthat Minka intended to insinuate to the jury that both the trial court and the prosecution were\n\npreventing him from telling them the truth.\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f\u00b641.   This not only was prejudicial to the State and its case, but it was prejudicial to the\n\ncourt itself. Suggesting to the jury that the court was preventing Minka from providing the\n\n\u201ctruth\u201d of the matter struck directly at the impartiality, equality, and fairness of justice\n\nexpected and required to be rendered by our courts. Minka willfully compromised this basic\n\npremise with his baseless statements, and the trial court rightfully granted the State\u2019s request\n\nfor a mistrial because of them.\n\n\u00b642.   As to the other contemptuous conduct the trial court found Minka engaged in, both\n\nthe transcripts and the audio recording included with this record fully support the court\u2019s\n\nfindings. The record demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that Minka was guilty of direct\n\ncriminal contempt, and that his contemptuous conduct resulted in a mistrial in the underlying\n\ncriminal matter.\n\n\u00b643.   This issue is without merit.\n\n       II.    The trial court did not abuse its discretion in assessing monetary\n              sanctions against Minka.\n\n\u00b644.   Minka contends that, even if this Court upholds the trial court\u2019s contempt order, the\n\namount of money sanctioned should not be affirmed. Minka submits the trial court charged\n\nhim for twenty-six prospective jurors who never sat on the case, which went to mistrial,\n\nimproperly increasing the sanction by $650 for the whole venire. Minka argues that nothing\n\nhe allegedly did harmed those prospective jurors who did not sit on the case. Minka further\n\ncontends that there is no proof in the record as to why this higher cost should have been\n\nassessed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f\u00b645.     We disagree. The trial court detailed in its order how it calculated the monetary\n\nsanction for jury costs and the authority by which it proceeded. The court ordered Minka to\n\npay $1,350 for the jury cost ($25 per juror for forty jurors who participated in voir dire on\n\nNovember 18, and $25 per juror for the fourteen petit jurors who appeared the next day for\n\ntrial on November 19). Twenty-five dollars is the statutory rate pursuant to Mississippi Code\n\nSection 25-7-61. See Miss. Code Ann.\u00a7 25-7-61 (Rev. 2006).\n\n\u00b646.   The same type sanction was upheld recently in Harris, 2017 WL 58190 (assessing\n\n$1,200 for the cost of the jury), and previously in Crosby v. State, 760 So. 2d 725 (Miss.\n\n2000) (assessing $750 for jury cost\u2013$25 per juror for thirty jurors), pursuant to Uniform Rule\n\n3.13. This rule provides: \u201cThe court may assess all costs, including fees and mileage of\n\njurors who have been required to be present for the trial, against whichever party litigant or\n\nattorney it deems appropriate, for failure of an attorney to try the case . . . .\u201d URCCC 3.13.\n\nThe trial court in its discretion did not assess Minka the cost for mileage.\n\n\u00b647.   This issue too is without merit.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b648.   For these reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s contempt and sanctions order against\n\nMinka.\n\n\u00b649.
