Moody, Jr., United States District Judge for the Middle\n        District of Florida, sitting by designation.\n        1 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) states in relevant part:\n                It shall be unlawful for any person . . . who has been convicted\n                in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term\n                exceeding one year . . . to . . . possess in or affecting commerce,\n                any firearm or ammunition . . . which has been shipped or\n                transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\n        2 Turner was also indicted for knowingly possessing a stolen firearm in viola-\n        tion of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j). See infra note 38. The jury found him not guilty of\n        the charge. The trial and disposition of the \u00a7 922(j) charge has no bearing on\n        this appeal.\n        3 See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 17, Insanity defense; Fed. R. Crim.

It undertook to rebut Turner\u2019s\n        three affirmative defenses by establishing that they lacked a factual\n        foundation. Its strategy was successful. The jury found Turner\n        guilty as charged, and the District Court sentenced him to a prison\n        term of ten years.\n                Turner appeals his conviction. He raises one issue. It in-\n        volves the expert opinion testimony the Government presented in\n        its case in chief over his objection to disprove his allegation that he\n        was insane when he committed the \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense. Rule 704(b)\n        of the Federal Rules of Evidence precludes an expert witness in a\n        criminal case from \u201cstat[ing] an opinion about whether the defend-\n        ant did or did not have a mental state or condition that constitutes\n        an element . . . of a defense.\u201d6 Notwithstanding this preclusion,\n\n\n        4 See Fed.

Within\n        \u201cpublic authority,\u201d we also refer to the related affirmative defense of \u201centrap-\n        ment by estoppel.\u201d See United States v.

After pondering what took place before the jury in\n        this way, we conclude that the answer is yes. Turner\u2019s conviction\n        is therefore affirmed.\n              We organize our discussion as follows. Part I portrays the\n        testimony and other evidence relating to the charged \u00a7 922(g)(1)\n\n\n        state or condition that constitutes an element of the crime charged or of a de-\n        fense.

Evid. 704(b).\n        7 Rule 52(a), Harmless Error, states: \u201cAny error, defect, irregularity, or vari-\n        ance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d Fed. R.

Part II covers, with re-\n        spect to those defenses, the parties\u2019 closing arguments and the Dis-\n        trict Court\u2019s instructions to the jury. Part III.A. addresses the inad-\n        missibility under Rule 704(b) of the forensic psychologist\u2019s opinion\n        concerning Turner\u2019s state of mind in possessing the firearms. Part\n        III.B. explains why the admission of the opinion in evidence consti-\n        tuted harmless error. Part IV concludes.\n                                          I.\n               Jessie James Turner, Jr., is a chronic alcoholic and a con-\n        victed felon, having served a prison term for illegal possession of a\n        firearm in violation of state law in 1999. Turner\u2019s insanity defense\n        was based essentially on the pressures of everyday living. Some of\n        the pressures were self-induced, like his alcoholism, and some were\n        caused by events beyond his control. Turner\u2019s alleged insanity\n        manifested itself in the hallucinations he suffered on November 8,\n        2018, which caused him to fire an AR-15 rifle at some imaginary\n        men who were trying to enter his residence and kill him.\n                Turner\u2019s exercise-of-public-authority and entrapment de-\n        fenses stemmed from his need to avoid prosecution for possessing\n        a firearm, a .40 caliber Smith & Wesson pistol, as a convicted felon\n        on July 20, 2018, in violation of federal law. Turner alleged that\n        two law enforcement officers, Special Agent Thomas Nevin of the\n        Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\n        (\u201cATF\u201d) and Detective Willie Calhoun of the Selma, Alabama, Po-\n        lice Department (\u201cSPD\u201d), operating in tandem, promised that he\n        would not be prosecuted for the July 20 possession if he purchased\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364      Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023      Page: 6 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        6                       Opinion of the Court                 20-12364\n\n        stolen firearms on the street and assisted in the prosecution of the\n        sellers.\n               In subpart A, we set out what was disclosed in the Govern-\n        ment\u2019s case in chief. We focus in particular on Turner\u2019s interac-\n        tions with Agent Nevin and Detective Calhoun, and on what the\n        forensic psychologist had to say about Turner\u2019s sanity on Novem-\n        ber 8, 2018, when he committed the \u00a7 922(g) offense. Subpart B\n        sets out Turner\u2019s version of his interactions with Agent Nevin and\n        Detective Calhoun and the manifestation of his alleged insanity on\n        November 8.\n                                          A.\n               On the night of July 20, 2018, a task force created by the ATF\n        and the SPD was conducting a \u201cproactive, saturation detail\u201d in the\n        city. Agent Nevin and Detective Calhoun were among those in-\n        volved. 8 They were riding in Calhoun\u2019s patrol car. 9\n                Calhoun observed a Nissan Titan pickup truck commit a\n        traffic violation, and he pulled it over. The Titan had five occu-\n        pants. Turner owned the vehicle but was not the driver. He was\n        a passenger, riding in the front seat. When Calhoun got to the car,\n        he observed the presence of open beverage containers and ordered\n\n\n        8 Officers of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency and the Dallas County,\n        Alabama Sheriff\u2019s Office were also involved.\n        9 Also in Calhoun\u2019s car were an officer of the Alabama Law Enforcement\n        Agency and a Dallas County Sheriff\u2019s deputy.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364        Document: 42-1        Date Filed: 03/01/2023        Page: 7 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                  Opinion of the Court                              7\n\n        everyone to step out. Turner, who was intoxicated, resisted. So,\n        Calhoun and Nevin seized him and put him on the ground in hand-\n        cuffs. Turner had a .40 caliber Smith & Wesson pistol on his per-\n        son, and Calhoun removed it. Once Turner was subdued, Agent\n        Nevin questioned him with Calhoun standing by. 10 The exchange\n        was recorded.\n               Turner was aware that Nevin was an ATF agent and that\n        Nevin could quickly determine that he was a convicted felon and\n        arrest him for possessing a firearm. Hence, without any prompt-\n        ing, Turner volunteered: \u201cI\u2019m a convicted felon. And I know I\n        wasn\u2019t supposed to have it on me. But y\u2019all got me with it.\u201d 11 To\n        encourage Nevin to \u201cwash this shit on the gun charge,\u201d Turner of-\n        fered to help the police solve \u201cthree murders and . . . at least five\n        shootings.\u201d\n               Turner: I guarantee I\u2019m going to clear these murders\n               up, because I\u2019ve got three murders that nobody\n               cleared up. . . .\n               Nevin: Is the reason you\u2019re talking to me right now,\n               the only reason, so you can get out of custody right\n               now? Is that the only reason you\u2019re talking to me?\n\n\n        10 Early in the exchange, Nevin asked Calhoun whether he had Mirandized\n        Turner. Turner interjected: \u201cHe didn\u2019t Mirandize me and I ain\u2019t asked for no\n        lawyer. . . . What I\u2019m saying is y\u2019all just wash this shit on the gun charge.\u201d\n        11 Later in the exchange with Nevin, Turner said that he \u201cdid 20 years in\n        prison.\u201d\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364        Document: 42-1        Date Filed: 03/01/2023        Page: 8 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        8                         Opinion of the Court                     20-12364\n\n               Turner: Well, actually, I was waiting for a reward to\n               come out on these other cases. But they ain\u2019t posted\n               no reward yet. I actually was waiting for the reward\n               to come through and then I was going to go and tell\n               you. . . . I\u2019ll get you these motherfuckers copping out\n               to these murders. I will get them motherfuckers on\n               tape copping out to the murders. . . .

He could obtain it. \u201cI\n        can get the information. But I\u2019ve got to go talk to these mother-\n        fuckers on tape to get everything on tape and you\u2019ve got the case,\n        you going to solve the fucking case.

From the\n\n\n        12 According to Detective Calhoun, Turner identified one of the murder vic-\n        tims as \u201cQuentin Davis.\u201d\n        13 Calhoun said that he and Nevin jointly made the decision to release Turner.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364          Document: 42-1          Date Filed: 03/01/2023          Page: 9 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                    Opinion of the Court                                  9\n\n        next day, July 21, through October 27, 2018, Turner sent Calhoun\n        twenty-six text messages; Calhoun sent Turner fourteen.14 Turner\n        phoned Calhoun thirty-three times; he answered seven of the\n        calls. 15 Calhoun called Turner three times. 16 None of the text\n        messages in the record 17 mentioned the murders and shootings\n        Turner referred to in his conversation with Agent Nevin on July\n\n\n\n\n        14 The text messages were sent by Turner and responded to by Calhoun as\n        follows: July 25 (6 sent, including a picture; 5 responses); July 26 (11 sent; 6\n        responses); August 6 (1 sent; 1 response); August 22 (2 sent); September 5 (1\n        sent); September 26 (4 sent; 2 responses); October 27 (1 sent).\n        15 Here are the calls, their dates, and their total lengths of time per day (in\n        minutes) in parentheses: July 21, one call (3); July 26, two calls (7); August 6,\n        two calls (none); August 7, one call (none); August 16, two calls (20); August\n        18, three calls (none); August 22, three calls (2); September 5, six calls (5); Sep-\n        tember 15, one call (none); September 24, two calls (3); September 26, one call\n        (none); September 29, six calls (none); October 27, three calls (none).

Calhoun testified that he could not recall the content of the\n        phone calls.\n               One of Turner\u2019s text messages related to firearms. On July\n        25, Turner sent Calhoun photos of guns, several pistols, and an au-\n        tomatic rifle. Calhoun forwarded the photos to Agent Nevin.\n        Nevin acknowledged receiving the photos but did not authorize\n        Turner to purchase any of the firearms on behalf of the ATF. Cal-\n        houn testified that he did not \u201ccommunicate\u201d Agent Nevin\u2019s mes-\n        sages in response to the photos to Turner.\n               A month later, on September 26, Turner texted Calhoun\n        asking him if he had a \u201cdevice\u201d that he could \u201chook to\u201d his phone\n        so he could \u201crecord what\u2019s being talked about.\u201d 18 Calhoun\u2019s re-\n        plies were: \u201cYou can use the recorder on your phone\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll see\n        what I can find.\u201d Calhoun made no attempt to find a device be-\n        cause he was not going to use Turner as an SPD confidential in-\n        formant. 19\n\n\n\n        18 Turner never explained what in particular was being talked about.\n        19 At Turner\u2019s trial, Calhoun said this in an exchange with Turner\u2019s attorney:\n               Attorney: Now, if you have a confidential informant that you\n               want to purchase drugs or firearms, do you then sign them up\n               under the C.I. packet, what we\u2019ve been calling it?\n               Calhoun: Absolutely.\n               Attorney: But you never signed Mr. Turner up?\n               Calhoun: No\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364       Document: 42-1        Date Filed: 03/01/2023        Page: 11 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                  Opinion of the Court                            11\n\n              Also in September, around the time these text messages\n        were exchanged, an SPD officer was murdered. Calhoun asked\n        Turner to come to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency\n        (\u201cALEA\u201d) office where officers of several law enforcement agencies\n        were gathered in response. Calhoun summoned Turner because\n        he might be useful in developing leads. Calhoun met Turner at the\n        ALEA office and introduced him to Agent Nevin\u2019s supervisor, the\n        ATF agent \u201cin charge.\u201d 20 The supervisor briefed Turner about the\n        SPD officer\u2019s murder and asked for any information he might have\n        about it.\n               On October 27, Turner sent Calhoun a text message, \u201cWe\n        need to talk.\u201d The phone records indicate Turner sent the message\n        at 7:29 PM, and that Calhoun did not respond to it. Turner also\n        called him three times that day, at 1:54, 1:55, and 9:24 PM. The\n        calls were all one minute long, so they likely went unanswered. 21\n        Turner would not call Calhoun again until November 8 at 4:53 AM.\n\n\n               Attorney: Why is that?\n               Calhoun: Mr. Turner stated he wanted to help himself by stay-\n               ing out of jail. He was going to provide information about\n               murders, and that was strictly\u2014he wanted to help himself.\n               We wasn\u2019t planning on making any kind of purchases with\n               him as a drug informant or ATF informant.\n        20 Calhoun described the supervisor as the agent in charge.\n        21 See supra note 15. As to some of the calls he answered, Calhoun testified:\n        \u201cMr. Turner would call [while intoxicated] and he would just rattle on about\n        something [Calhoun] didn\u2019t know nothing about and [he\u2019d] just set the phone\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364        Document: 42-1        Date Filed: 03/01/2023      Page: 12 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        12                        Opinion of the Court                   20-12364\n\n                Turner lived with his girlfriend, Mary Walker, in her apart-\n        ment at 11 Mabry Street in Selma.22 She worked at Plantation Pat-\n        terns and met Turner when he was employed there. 23 Her apart-\n        ment was one of four apartments in the building. Two were on\n        the first floor, and two, including hers, were on the second floor.\n        The building had one front door on the ground floor. It opened\n        onto a hallway between the first-floor apartments and a stairway\n        that led to a hallway between the second-floor apartments.\n               On November 8, 2018, sometime between 2:00 and 3:00\n        AM, SPD Officer Ashley Gaskins (a defense witness whose testi-\n        mony we discuss here for context) responded to a 911 call made\n        from 11 Mabry Street. The caller told SPD\u2019s dispatch that three\n        black males were trying to gain entry to a residence at that address.\n        They were wearing hoodies. One was \u201cpurple,\u201d one was \u201cyellow,\u201d\n        and one was \u201cblue.\u201d In addition, \u201cone was wearing camouflage\n        pants,\u201d and \u201cthey were armed with AR-15s and AK-47s.\u201d Given this\n        report, Officer Gaskins arrived \u201cwith lights and sirens\u201d on. Officer\n        Pinkston soon joined her and with weapons drawn, they \u201ccleared\n        the immediate area.\u201d They saw no one. Thirty to forty seconds\n\n        down and just let him talk.\u201d Calhoun could tell Turner was intoxicated be-\n        cause he would use \u201c[s]lurred speech\u201d and \u201ckept repeating himself over and\n        over and over again.\u201d\n        22 The two had been dating for six and a half years.\n        23 Plantation Patterns had fired Turner in February or March 2018. According\n        to Walker, he submitted online job applications after that but was unable to\n        find employment.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364        Document: 42-1         Date Filed: 03/01/2023        Page: 13 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                   Opinion of the Court                              13\n\n        later, they cut off the lights and sirens, and Turner appeared. He\n        said that he had made the 911 call because \u201cthey were jumping\n        from rooftop to rooftop.\u201d \u201cSomebody\u2019s trying to get us,\u201d he said.\n        The officers looked around and saw no one.\n               Turner was wearing headphones, and they asked him what\n        he was \u201cplaying.\u201d He said he was playing \u201cFortnite,\u201d a video game\n        involving cartoon gun violence, listening with headphones. Officer\n        Pinkston asked him what he was hearing. Turner said they were\n        coming to get him, repeating what he had told dispatch. Pinkston\n        told him to turn the \u201cgame system off,\u201d then tell them \u201cwhat hap-\n        pen[ed].\u201d Turner did. He came back outside and said: \u201cThey\u2019re\n        gone.\u201d Officer Gaskins said: \u201cAll right. Go to bed.\u201d The officers\n        then turned and left.\n              Several hours later, around 11:00 AM, eight SPD officers, in-\n        cluding Detective Calhoun, responded to a 911 call reporting that\n        gunshots were being fired in the apartment building located at 11\n        Mabry Street. 24 The shooting continued after the officers arrived\n        on the scene. 25 Turner emerged from the building\u2019s front door\n\n\n        24 A woman in the apartment adjacent to Mary Walker\u2019s apartment made the\n        call. She and her child had heard shots fired in Walker\u2019s apartment.\n        25 Lieutenant Kenta Fulford was the first officer to respond to the shooting.\n        He was wearing a body camera which recorded what took place after he ar-\n        rived, including the sound of shots being fired. The recording was played be-\n        fore the jury. Once at the scene, Fulford radioed dispatch, and several officers\n        appeared shortly thereafter. SPD Officer James Matthew Smyly was on patrol\n        two blocks away when the 911 call came in and was dispatched to the scene.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364        Document: 42-1        Date Filed: 03/01/2023        Page: 14 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        14                        Opinion of the Court                      20-12364\n\n        with an AR-15 in his right hand pointed up. The officers ordered\n        Turner to stand down, and he complied. They searched him and\n        found a .40 caliber Springfield XD-40 pistol in his back pocket. The\n        pistol had \u201ca long magazine\u201d of thirty rounds. \u201c[T]wo extra maga-\n        zines [were] in his pocket[s], one [in] each front pocket.\u201d\n                The officers checked the apartments and concluded that no\n        one in the building had been injured. Next, they performed a pro-\n        tective sweep of the apartment Turner had exited and found four-\n        teen shell casings on the floor and bullet holes in the walls. In\n        Turner and Walker\u2019s bedroom, they found a second AR-15 under\n        the bed. 26 The officers also found in the apartment a box with\n        \u201cthree boxes of bullets in it,\u201d a ledger, \u201csome scales,\u201d marijuana,\n        boxes of sandwich bags, and inositol\u2014a substance used to mix co-\n        caine. 27 Meanwhile, Turner had been placed under arrest, and he\n        was transported to the city jail after the apartment sweep.\n\n\n        He was wearing a body camera which recorded everything that occurred after\n        his arrival. The recording was played before the jury.\n        26 Mary Walker\u2019s apartment had two bedrooms. Turner and Mary slept in\n        one bedroom (the master); the other bedroom was a spare. Turner testified\n        that he had stored the guns in the spare bedroom closet and then brought\n        them into the master bedroom during the shooting incident on November 8,\n        2018.\n        27 This is what Turner told Detective Calhoun following his arrest. While\n        Turner testified that he stored the marijuana in the spare bedroom closet, Cal-\n        houn told Turner after his arrest that \u201cthe weed\u201d was \u201cright there\u201d with the\n        second AR-15. The inositol and sandwich bags were \u201c[o]n the dresser right by\n        the TV stand,\u201d and the ledger was in a drawer with \u201cmoney,\u201d which Turner\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364         Document: 42-1         Date Filed: 03/01/2023          Page: 15 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                    Opinion of the Court                                15\n\n               A short time later, Turner was taken from jail to the SPD\n        headquarters, to Detective Calhoun\u2019s office. Calhoun read Turner\n        his Miranda 28 rights. Turner indicated that he understood his\n        rights and that he was willing to submit to Calhoun\u2019s questioning\n        in the absence of counsel. And he did so in the presence of SPD\n        Officer Scott Rouse. The interrogation was recorded by video and\n        played before the jury.\n              Detective Calhoun questioned Turner for twenty-seven\n        minutes. 29 Turner admitted he was a convicted felon, had served\n        several years in prison, and could not lawfully possess a firearm. 30\n        He then described the circumstances under which he had obtained\n        the two AR-15 rifles and the .40 caliber Springfield XD-40 pistol\n        found in his back pocket and what had transpired on November 8\n        and the days immediately before. He acquired the first AR-15 (the\n\n\n        said was over $500 for Mary\u2019s car note. Calhoun did not specify where the\n        boxes of bullets or the scales were found.\n        28Miranda v.

He agreed to pay $450 total for the rifle\n        and eight 30-round clips; that price included a promise to provide\n        marijuana in the future as partial compensation.33 As of his post-\n        arrest interview, he owed money on these purchases. 34\n\n\n        31 The guy who sold it to him said that \u201cit was a hot gun.\u201d Turner bought the\n        gun on the street because he could not buy one at a store. He could not be-\n        cause he was an ex-felon.\n        32 Later, after stating that the pistol came with his purchase of the first AR-15,\n        Turner said that the pistol was his mother\u2019s. He took it from her house \u201cwith-\n        out her permission.\u201d\n        33 Turner told Calhoun that the marijuana the police found in the bedroom\n        of the apartment \u201cwas supposed to have been going to him till when I came\n        up with the rest of his money.\u201d Turner was likely referring to the man who\n        sold him the second AR-15. \u201cI ain\u2019t paid him for it.

Second, on November 9 in Mobile, Turner executed a financial\n        affidavit, which indicated that he was unemployed, married, and revealed his\n        and his spouse\u2019s income and his assets, and then appeared before the magis-\n        trate judge, who conducted his initial appearance. The magistrate judge ap-\n        pointed Neil Hanley to represent Turner. Also on November 9, the Govern-\n        ment moved the District Court to order Turner\u2019s pre-indictment detention\n        pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e) and (f).\n                 At Turner\u2019s trial, none of these events was made known to the jury. It\n        appears that following his initial appearance before the magistrate judge on\n        November 9, Turner was transported by the U.S. Marshal\u2019s Service from Mo-\n        bile to Baldwin County, Alabama, and taken to North Baldwin Infirmary. His\n        medical records indicate he was at the hospital from November 9\u201312, but Dr.\n        Barnette\u2019s report says he was hospitalized on November 10.\n               On November 15, in Mobile, the magistrate judge held a preliminary\n        hearing on the charge contained in the criminal complaint Agent Nevin filed\n        on November 8. She found probable cause to believe that Turner had\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364        Document: 42-1        Date Filed: 03/01/2023          Page: 19 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                   Opinion of the Court                             19\n\n                               *              *                *\n              On November 28, 2018, a Southern District of Alabama\n        grand jury returned an indictment charging Turner in Count One\n        with knowingly possessing three firearms as a convicted felon \u201con\n        or about\u201d November 8, 2018, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). 38\n        On December 6, he was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty.\n        On December 21, defense counsel notified the Government of\n        Turner\u2019s intent to present an insanity defense. 39 The same day,\n\n\n        committed the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense as alleged and on November 20\n        ordered Turner detained pending trial.

United States, 139 S. Ct.\n        2191, 2200 (2019), which held that in an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) prosecution, the\n        \u201cGovernment must prove both that the defendant knew he possessed a fire-\n        arm and that he knew he belonged to the relevant category of persons barred\n        from possessing a firearm.\u201d The superseding indictment cured the Rehaif de-\n        ficiency in Count One, and contained an additional charge, Count Two, which\n        alleged that on November 8, 2018, he knowingly possessed a stolen firearm in\n        violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j).\n        39 Rule 12.2(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure states, in pertinent\n        part:\n               Notice of an Insanity Defense. A defendant who intends to\n               assert a defense of insanity at the time of the alleged offense\n               must so notify an attorney for the government in writing\n               within the time provided for filing a pretrial motion, or at any\n               later time the court sets, and file a copy of the notice with the\n               clerk. A defendant who fails to do so cannot rely on an insanity\n               defense.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364         Document: 42-1        Date Filed: 03/01/2023          Page: 20 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20                         Opinion of the Court                       20-12364\n\n        defense counsel moved the District Court to order a mental evalu-\n        ation of Turner to determine his competency to stand trial and\n        whether he was insane when he committed the \u00a7 922(g)(1) of-\n        fense. 40 The Court granted the motion on December 27 and or-\n        dered Turner transferred to a facility designated by the Bureau of\n        Prisons for evaluation and the submission of a psychiatric or psy-\n        chological report on his mental status. 41\n               On January 23, 2019, Turner was admitted to the Federal\n        Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) Correctional Institution at Butner,\n        North Carolina,42 for evaluation of his mental status. Rebecca Bar-\n        nette, Ph.D., a forensic psychologist, performed the evaluation and\n\n        18 U.S.C. \u00a7 17, Insanity defense, states:\n                (a) Affirmative defense. It is an affirmative defense to a prose-\n                cution under any Federal statute that, at the time of the com-\n                mission of the acts constituting the offense, the defendant, as a\n                result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to ap-\n                preciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts.\n                Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a de-\n                fense.\n                (b) Burden of proof.

Regarding the public authority and entrapment defenses,\n\n\n        43 See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.3, Notice of a Public-Authority Defense.

The Government knew\n        this because Turner had not notified the Government pretrial as\n        required by Rule 12.2(b) that he would be calling such a specialist\n        to testify as an expert witness. 48 Instead, he would set out to prove\n        that he was suffering a severe mental disease or defect with the lay\n        testimony of Mary Walker under Rule 701 of the Federal Rules of\n\n\n\n\n        46 See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 17(b).\n        47 See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 17(a).\n        48 Rule 12.2 states in pertinent part:\n                (b) Notice of Expert Evidence of a Mental Condition. If a de-\n                fendant intends to introduce expert evidence relating to a men-\n                tal disease or defect or any other mental condition of the de-\n                fendant bearing on . . . the issue of guilt . . . the defendant\n                must\u2014within the time provided for filing a pretrial motion or\n                at any later time the court sets\u2014notify an attorney for the gov-\n                ernment in writing of this intention and file a copy of the no-\n                tice with the clerk.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364        Document: 42-1         Date Filed: 03/01/2023          Page: 23 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                  Opinion of the Court                               23\n\n        Evidence. 49 In the face of this, the Government\u2019s strategy would\n        be anticipatory. It would, in effect, rebut Walker\u2019s testimony by\n        calling Dr. Barnette as an expert witness in its case in chief, rather\n        than on rebuttal after the defense presented its testimony and\n\n\n        49 Defense counsel revealed this in the following exchange that took place in\n        the absence of the jury on the Government\u2019s initiative after the Government\n        rested its case in chief:\n               Prosecutor: Your Honor, we understand that defense intends\n               to offer some lay witness testimony regarding Mr. Turner\u2019s\n               mental state and competency perhaps. And we would just re-\n               quest an order limiting any lay witness testimony to be within\n               the bounds of rule 701.\n               Court: Well, I don\u2019t know what witnesses\u2014\n               Defense: That was\u2014\n               Prosecutor: Lay witness opinion versus expert opinion.\n               Defense: Judge, I don\u2019t think\u2014my client would not be giving\n               any opinion on my client\u2019s\u2014you know, what condition he\n               may suffer from or anything.

As it turned out, the jury decided\n        the severe mental disease or defect element of Turner\u2019s insanity\n        defense without the benefit of expert mental health testimony.\n                               *             *             *\n                Dr. Barnette testified at length about her evaluation of\n        Turner\u2019s mental status. She conducted the evaluation between\n        January 23 and April 18, 2019. In conducting it, she considered law\n        enforcement\u2019s description of the events that occurred on July 20,\n        2018, and between that date and November 8, 2018; records of cell\n        phone calls and text messages Turner sent Detective Calhoun dur-\n        ing that time period; the recordings of the interviews of Turner\n        conducted by Agent Nevin on July 20 and Detective Calhoun on\n        November 8; the indictment returned on November 28, 2018; the\n        order granting defense counsel\u2019s motion for a determination of\n        Turner\u2019s competency to stand trial and insanity at the time of the\n        offense; and the medical records of Turner\u2019s confinement as a pa-\n        tient in North Baldwin Infirmary from November 9\u201312, 2018. In\n        addition, Dr. Barnette interviewed Turner\u2019s mother and Mary\n        Walker.\n               The North Baldwin Infirmary records indicated that on arri-\n        val at the hospital, Turner was \u201cmuttering . . . making some\n\n\n        50 See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 17(a).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364         Document: 42-1         Date Filed: 03/01/2023         Page: 25 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                   Opinion of the Court                                25\n\n        unusual, strange comments about having been bit by a dog and\n        maybe being shot.\u201d The hospital\u2019s doctors diagnosed him as hav-\n        ing non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis. 51 \u201c[O]ne of the common\n        causes of that condition is alcohol abuse.\u201d The doctors concluded\n        that \u201che had been using alcohol pretty heavily [and] there could\n        have been a component of withdrawal from alcohol,\u201d which to-\n        gether \u201ccaused his hospitalization.\u201d52\n\n\n\n        51 According to the trial transcript of her testimony, Dr. Barnette used the\n        word \u201cspasmolysis,\u201d not \u201crhabdomyolysis.\u201d In her report to the District\n        Court, \u201cspasmolysis\u201d nowhere appears. Instead, rhabdomyolysis is the word\n        Dr. Barnette used, and it fits the description she ascribed to it and Turner\u2019s\n        condition on arriving at the North Baldwin Infirmary: \u201cnon-traumatic rhabdo-\n        myolysis [is] (a breakdown of muscle tissue). . . .

One was that he had \u201can alcohol use\n        disorder\u201d that was \u201csevere, just because of all of the problems that\n        alcohol use had caused him.\u201d The other was that he had an \u201canti-\n        social personality disorder.\u201d An antisocial personality disorder is\n        \u201cpervasive\u201d; it \u201clast[s] throughout your life.\u201d The \u201cindividual has\n        had some problems with violating the rights of others . . . by com-\n        mitting crimes or engaging in aggressive behaviors.\u201d They \u201cappre-\n        ciate what they are doing . . . tak[ing] advantage of others.\u201d\n        \u201c[T]ypically an individual who has this disorder . . . might not learn\n        from consequences, but they know very clearly that there are con-\n        sequences, from experience.\u201d Asked whether one diagnosed with\n        an antisocial personality disorder would be unable to appreciate\n        the nature of one\u2019s action, Dr. Barnette said: \u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t be\n\n\n\n        53 During that time, Turner was subjected to a battery of psychological tests.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364      Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023     Page: 27 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                Opinion of the Court                        27\n\n        that they wouldn\u2019t be able to appreciate what they are doing. It\n        just might be a tendency to . . . violate or take advantage of others.\u201d\n               The prosecutor asked Dr. Barnette about psychotic disor-\n        ders. She said that individuals suffering from psychotic disorders\n        would typically have started showing signs of such disorders in\n        their \u201clate teens [or] early twenties.\u201d There was no evidence of\n        such signs in Turner\u2019s medical history. And nothing indicated that\n        he had \u201csuffered from a psychotic disorder prior to his arrest.\u201d\n        While in pretrial detention\u2014presumably without access to alco-\n        hol\u2014he \u201cdid not report any symptoms consistent with psychosis\n        such as hearing voices or seeing things.\u201d Individuals with psychotic\n        disorders typically require some treatment \u201cto help keep their\n        symptoms in check.\u201d This is because psychosis symptoms like hal-\n        lucinations and hearing things do not cease on their own. But\n        Turner did not receive any \u201cantipsychotic medications\u201d while at\n        North Baldwin Infirmary, while in pretrial detention before arriv-\n        ing at Butner, or while there. In short, Dr. Barnette found no evi-\n        dence indicating that Turner was suffering from a psychotic disor-\n        der on November 8, 2018.\n                            *             *              *\n               This appeal is based solely on the opinion Dr. Barnette ex-\n        pressed when the prosecutor asked her on direct examination and\n        again on re-direct examination whether Turner was unable to ap-\n        preciate the nature or the wrongfulness of his actions on Novem-\n        ber 8. Defense counsel objected to the questions on the ground\n        that they called for Dr. Barnette to render an opinion foreclosed by\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 28 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        28                     Opinion of the Court                20-12364\n\n        Rule 704(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence in that the opinion\n        addressed an element of Turner\u2019s insanity defense: that (\u201cas a result\n        of a severe mental disease or defect\u201d) he \u201cwas unable to appreciate\n        the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts.\u201d On both\n        occasions, the District Court overruled the objection.\n               We consider first Dr. Barnette\u2019s answer to the question on\n        direct examination. The question and thus the answer was ambig-\n        uous.

He did that clearly, yes.\n               The prosecutor, referring to the body camera footage and\n        the video of Turner\u2019s post-arrest interrogation by Detective Cal-\n        houn, then asked Dr. Barnette to specify what aspects of Turner\u2019s\n        behavior as depicted in those exhibits showed that \u201che might be\n        able to appreciate the nature of his actions.\u201d The defense objected\n        to the question about \u201cwhat his mental state was during a post-\n        offense interview,\u201d saying that was \u201cnot the issue.\u201d 54 The prose-\n        cutor responded that \u201cthe best evidence of Mr. Turner\u2019s mental\n        state at the time of the offense is a video of him immediately there-\n        after.\u201d The court overruled the objection. Dr. Barnette testified\n        that in the body camera footage of Turner\u2019s encounter with the\n\n        54 Turner\u2019s opening brief in this appeal does not specifically challenge Dr. Bar-\n        nette\u2019s testimony in response to the prosecutor\u2019s questions about his mental\n        state as shown in Exhibits 1, 2, and 22.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364        Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 30 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        30                          Opinion of the Court              20-12364\n\n        police after exiting the apartment building, Turner recognized that\n        the officers were police officers and complied with their orders.\n        She also noted how, during the post-arrest interrogation, he \u201cwas\n        able to clearly communicate\u201d his answers to the officer\u2019s questions,\n        \u201cappeared calm,\u201d and despite a moment of imagining something\n        falling on him, was able to communicate coherently.\n                On cross-examination, defense counsel focused on the first\n        element of Turner\u2019s insanity defense, whether Turner was suffer-\n        ing from \u201ca severe mental disease or defect,\u201d 55 and asked Dr. Bar-\n        nette about a \u201cgeneral psychiatric condition called psychosis.\u201d She\n        acknowledged that psychosis can cause disorientation, confusion,\n        hallucinations, and delusions. She also acknowledged that psycho-\n        sis is \u201ca severe mental disorder.\u201d Counsel asked her whether a se-\n        vere mental disorder could be manifested by insomnia, disor-\n        ganized thinking, speech and language problems, disorientation,\n        and a change in sleeping habits in addition to confusion, hallucina-\n        tions, and delusions. She answered \u201cyes\u201d as to each symptom.\n               Dr. Barnette then agreed with counsel that one of the psy-\n        choses is \u201cstress-induced psychosis\u201d that could involve \u201ca high\n        amount of stress\u201d and \u201cdepression.\u201d That psychosis manifests as a\n        \u201cbrief psychotic episode.\u201d But \u201cif there\u2019s evidence of substance\n        abuse at the same time, it\u2019s very difficult to tease that out and know\n        that that was a brief psychotic disorder in direct . . . relation to the\n        stressor.\u201d She did agree with counsel\u2019s statement that \u201cthe[]\n\n        55 See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 17(a).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364      Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023      Page: 31 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                Opinion of the Court                        31\n\n        symptoms of alcohol-withdrawal psychosis and the symptoms of\n        stress-induced psychosis . . . essentially mirror each other.\u201d Asked\n        why she never mentioned \u201cstress-induced psychosis or brief psy-\n        chotic disorder\u201d in her report, Dr. Barnette said: \u201c[b]ecause it was\n        better explained by the alcohol use. . . . [A] brief psychotic disorder\n        cannot be related to substance use. It will be ruled out, if there is\n        evidence of substance abuse that could cause similar symptoms.\u201d\n              With defense counsel operating under the assumption that\n        Turner\u2019s behavior on November 8 was not alcohol-related, this ex-\n        change occurred:\n               Defense: And his family did not indicate to you spe-\n               cifically on the day of this incident or immediately\n               prior to it that he was involved in heavy alcohol drink-\n               ing specifically at that time?\n               Dr. Barnette: They indicated to me that he had been\n               drinking heavily in the time preceding the arrest.\n               Defense: In what time frame preceding the arrest?\n               Dr. Barnette: In the months preceding that. . . . His\n               girlfriend described . . . that it really started when he\n               lost his job, after he lost his job, that he really began\n               to drink heavily. And that would be in February 2018.\n               And then I believe his mother was talking about the\n               death of his cousin, and I believe that was in the late\n               summer or fall of 2018. So they both kind of talked\n               about these two different stressors. But they talked in\n               the months prior to the arrest that he was drinking\n               very heavily.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 32 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        32                     Opinion of the Court                 20-12364\n\n        Then, apparently accepting that alcohol may have contributed to\n        Turner\u2019s November 8 behavior, counsel returned to the alcohol-\n        withdrawal and stress-induced psychoses in this exchange:\n              Defense: Now, again, and these conditions, these\n              symptoms of alcohol-withdrawal psychosis and the\n              symptoms of stress-induced psychosis, brief psychotic\n              disorder, essentially mirror each other, don\u2019t they?\n              Dr. Barnette: They are very similar, they can be, yes.\n              Defense: But in your report and during your investi-\n              gation you never mentioned stress-induced psychosis\n              or brief psychotic disorder?\n              Dr. Barnette: Because it was better explained by the\n              alcohol use. As I said, a brief psychotic disorder can-\n              not be related to substance use. It will be ruled out,\n              if there is evidence of substance abuse that could\n              cause similar symptoms.\n              Defense: Okay. You didn\u2019t put in here that you had\n              specifically ruled out brief psychotic disorder or\n              stress-induced psychosis?\n              Dr. Barnette: I did not. I just didn\u2019t diagnose it.\n               Regarding the matter of alcohol, counsel asked Dr. Barnette\n        if withdrawal symptoms are \u201cvoluntary.\u201d She said that whether\n        alcohol withdrawal is involuntary would depend on the circum-\n        stances. Someone who had never experienced symptoms after\n        drinking might not know what to expect from withdrawal, while\n        \u201csomeone who knows what to expect\u201d and \u201cknow[s] they\u2019re hav-\n        ing problems . . . would know what to expect with the\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364    Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023     Page: 33 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364              Opinion of the Court                       33\n\n        withdrawal.\u201d And Turner would. He \u201ctalked about the inability\n        to even sleep when he wasn\u2019t drinking and that he was having\n        some significant difficulties when he wasn\u2019t drinking.\u201d Although\n        she did not know when Turner first manifested hallucinations from\n        drinking or withdrawal, Dr. Barnette was aware that his \u201challuci-\n        nations were going on around this time when he was drinking\n        heavily, trying to stop.\u201d\n              When defense counsel finished his cross-examination, the\n        prosecutor, on re-direct examination, repeated the question she\n        had previously asked Dr. Barnette over a defense objection.\n              Prosecutor: In your expert opinion . . . was Mr.\n              Turner able to appreciate the nature and quality of his\n              actions on November 8th, 2018?\n              Defense: Judge, I\u2019m just for the record going to renew\n              my objection.\n              Court: Overruled.\n              Dr. Barnette: Okay.

But she noted\n        that Turner said that he tried to ask the police for permission to\n        buy the AR-15s, \u201cbut was unable . . . to get that authorization.\u201d She\n\n\n        56 At the close of her direct examination of Dr. Barnette, the prosecutor asked\n        whether \u201c[a]s part of [her] prognosis and treatment recommendations for Mr.\n        Turner . . .

She\n        said, \u201che did.\u201d Dr. Barnette gave that answer after stating that it\n        was her \u201copinion\u201d that after Lieutenant Fulford arrived, Turner\n        \u201cunderstood what had happened, what had taken place, and he\n        communicated that.\u201d The prosecutor never asked Dr. Barnette (1)\n        whether Turner was suffering from a \u201csevere mental disease or de-\n        fect\u201d (the first element of the insanity defense), and (2) if so,\n        whether his possession of the firearms on November 8, 2018, was\n        \u201ca result of\u201d a severe mental disease or defect (the second element\n        of the defense). 58 The Government apparently considered those\n        two points irrelevant.

He\n        was released in 2006.\n        58 The third element is the mental state: whether the defendant \u201cwas unable\n        to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts.\u201d \u00a7 17(a).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364        Document: 42-1     Date Filed: 03/01/2023   Page: 36 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        36                         Opinion of the Court             20-12364\n\n        whether Turner was unable to appreciate that his possession of the\n        firearms on November 8 was wrongful.\n               When defense counsel asked Dr. Barnette what the prosecu-\n        tor\u2019s questions meant to her, she said it was her understanding that\n        the questions referred to Turner\u2019s appreciation of \u201chis wrongful-\n        ness of having the firearm and not being allowed to have [it].\u201d She\n        said this even though the prosecutor\u2019s questions did not seek such\n        response.\n               In sum, the prosecutor and defense counsel seemed to have\n        reframed Turner\u2019s insanity defense to read: \u201cwhen Turner pos-\n        sessed the firearms on November 8, was he unable to appreciate\n        the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts?\u201d According\n        to the prosecutor, the answer was revealed in the moment Lieu-\n        tenant Fulford showed up at 11 Mabry Street and in the video of\n        Detective Calhoun\u2019s subsequent questioning of Turner. According\n        to defense counsel, the answer was in what Mary Walker had ob-\n        served.\n                               *            *             *\n              Dr. Barnette was the Government\u2019s final witness.

He was suffering from a severe\n        mental disease or defect that made him unable to appreciate that\n        his possession of the firearms on November 8, 2018, was wrongful.\n        He would prove this defense with Mary Walker\u2019s testimony. Sec-\n        ond and third, he possessed the firearms in the exercise of public\n        authority and, if not, because he was entrapped into possessing the\n        firearms. Turner would establish those defenses with the testi-\n        mony Detective Calhoun and Agent Nevin had already given and\n        by what he would say when he testified. 61\n               Turner began with the predicate for his insanity defense\u2014\n        specifically, several months of anxiety, culminating in depres-\n        sion.62 It all started when he lost his father. A short time later, in\n        February 2018, he lost his job at Plantation Patterns after having\n        worked there for eleven years. He looked for work but could not\n        find any and had to rely on unemployment insurance. \u201c[He] had a\n\n\n        60 Turner presented his defense after the District Court denied his motion for\n        judgment of acquittal. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.\n        61 Turner called three witnesses in his defense: Officer Ashley Gaskins, who\n        encountered Turner at the 11 Mabry Street apartment complex around 2:00\n        to 3:00 AM on November 8 as related supra in subpart A, Mary Walker, and\n        himself.\n        62 Mary Walker sometimes described Turner\u2019s mood as one of sadness.

On top of all of this was the pressure he felt to provide\n        Detective Calhoun with information Calhoun needed to solve the\n        murders he was investigating\u2014information he was either unwill-\n        ing or unable to provide. He was also anxious for his own safety\n        because of the possibility that certain individuals in the community\n        would find out that he was cooperating with the police. He knew\n        from the time he had spent in prison \u201cwhat happened to\n        snitches.\u201d 63\n                Mary Walker described Turner\u2019s emotional state prior to his\n        arrest. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t sleeping at all.\u201d A couple of days before his ar-\n        rest, \u201c[h]e was talking out of his head.\u201d Then, around midnight on\n        November 8 (the night before his arrest), he awakened her, saying:\n\n\n\n\n        63 He summed up his dilemma thus:\n              I\u2019m going through a whirlwind of emotions. Like I say, I lost\n              my father, I lost my job, my cousin\u2019s killed, I can\u2019t find a job,\n              the police is on my back, I\u2019m scared, you know.

She looked around several times and saw no one. He took\n        a shower, thinking \u201cmaybe it will stop.\u201d Then, he dressed, went to\n        the front room, and called one of the men who worked at Planta-\n        tion Patterns (while Turner was employed there). The man ap-\n        peared and, contrary to what Turner insisted, was unable to see\n        anyone outside. Later that morning, the police (Officers Gaskins\n        and Pinkston) arrived and talked to Turner.64 Around 4:00 AM,\n        Turner told Mary to get ready for work. She was due on the job at\n        Plantation Patterns at 6:00 AM.\n              Mary drove Turner\u2019s Titan pickup truck to work. He rode\n        along as a passenger. En route, she observed him saying to imagi-\n        nary persons in the back seat: \u201cI told y\u2019all not to get in my truck.\u201d\n        Upon arriving at Plantation Patterns, Mary got out of the Titan and\n        Turner moved over to the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\n\n\n        64 Mary overheard part of Officer Pinkston\u2019s discussion with Turner. She\n        heard one of the officers say: \u201cWell, sir, if they come back around again, just\n        give us a call. . . . Because we don\u2019t see anybody out here now.\u201d Mary also\n        indicated she was getting ready for work around 4:00 AM when the officers\n        arrived, though Officer Gaskins testified that she arrived around 2:00 or 3:00\n        AM.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364      Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023      Page: 40 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        40                      Opinion of the Court                  20-12364\n\n               Turner testified that on leaving Mary at Plantation Patterns,\n        he called Calhoun.65 No answer. So, he called him again. Still no\n        answer. He then drove to his mother\u2019s house. She was not there\n        because she had gone to work. He disabled the house\u2019s alarm and\n        entered. He got on his mother\u2019s computer and searched some job-\n        application websites. After that, he looked out of a window and\n        saw a car with three men drive past the house. He had seen the car\n        earlier, \u201cwhen [he] took [Mary] to work.\u201d \u201cThey followed me,\u201d he\n        said. \u201cThey was outside my house the night before with guns. I\n        don\u2019t know for sure, but there can\u2019t be no coincidence. I keep see-\n        ing a strange vehicle and these guys.\u201d His mother had guns. So,\n        fearing for his life, he took the pistol she had in a box in her closet,\n        reset the house alarm, and went straight home to Mary\u2019s apart-\n        ment. Mary called, but they did not talk for long. He reminded\n        her that she could not call from work.\n               Later that morning, Turner was watching TV when he\n        heard a voice at the back door saying: \u201cAs soon as he opens, I\u2019m\n        gonna fire him up.\u201d He ran to the spare bedroom where he had\n        stashed the guns, grabbed an AR-15, and went to the back door\n        where he heard \u201cbumping\u201d like \u201cthey [were] fixing to come in.\u201d\n        He then \u201cstart[ed] shooting at the door.\u201d He ran to the front room,\n        called Mary, and told her to call the police. \u201cThey in here,\u201d he said,\n        \u201c[t]hey\u2019re trying to kill me.\u201d She told him to \u201ccalm down, ain\u2019t\n\n\n        65 Turner\u2019s phone records show he called Calhoun at 4:53 AM on November\n        8, before Mary drove to work. The call went unanswered.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 41 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364               Opinion of the Court                       41\n\n        nobody there.\u201d \u201c[S]he didn\u2019t want to hear it,\u201d he said.

The on-\n        set occurred during his conversation with Agent Nevin following\n        the traffic stop. Turner knew he could be prosecuted for possessing\n        the .40 caliber Smith & Wesson pistol he was carrying that day. In\n        an effort to persuade Agent Nevin to let him go, he told Detective\n        Calhoun, with whom Nevin was working closely, that he could get\n        the information Calhoun needed about his cousin Quentin\u2019s mur-\n        der. He would provide the information \u201cto keep [himself] out of\n        the jail,\u201d as he put it. Calhoun was receptive, so Agent Nevin, ac-\n        commodating Calhoun, forewent Turner\u2019s arrest.\n                 Turner testified that he and Calhoun exchanged phone\n        numbers, and the next day they spoke on the phone. They talked\n        about the information he had \u201cprovided on Quentin\u2019s murder,\u201d\n        and Calhoun asked him \u201cabout other murders or shootings . . . he\n        wanted to find out any information . . . [Turner] could get on that.\u201d\n        Turner told Calhoun he would find out as much as he could about\n        \u201cany crime\u201d in Selma. On July 25, he sent Calhoun photos of guns\n        a guy had for sale and asked Calhoun if he \u201cwant[ed] to buy them.\n        . . . [Calhoun] said he had to talk with others about that and would\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 42 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        42                     Opinion of the Court                20-12364\n\n        get back.\u201d He never did. After Turner sent Calhoun the photos,\n        he and Calhoun went back and forth about a \u201cwhole array\u201d of\n        \u201ccriminal activity\u201d in Selma. He kept \u201cworking with Detective Cal-\n        houn\u201d because, as he testified: \u201cI still have a potential charge over\n        my head and I haven\u2019t satisfied him enough.\u201d\n               In September, after an SPD officer had been murdered and\n        Calhoun summoned Turner to the ALEA office, Calhoun intro-\n        duced him to an ATF agent, the \u201chead field agent,\u201d Agent Nevin\u2019s\n        supervisor. The agent talked with Turner about his \u201cproblem,\u201d re-\n        ferring to Turner\u2019s possession of the Smith & Wesson pistol in July,\n        and said that he was \u201cthe one with the authority to take care of\n        [Turner\u2019s] problem . . . the one who could make [it] disappear.\u201d\n        The ATF agent told him to follow Calhoun\u2019s directions, and that\n        the ATF would reimburse him if \u201csomething [came] up\u201d and he\n        \u201cneed[ed] to spend [his own] money.\u201d Turner said that after leav-\n        ing the meeting, Calhoun told him: \u201cWe have a go now.\u201d \u201c[Y]ou\n        don\u2019t have to hesitate about buying guns or drugs or anything. . . .\n        Do not let the opportunity pass you up to make cases for me.\u201d Cal-\n        houn explained: \u201cThe feds are in town to help us on cases.\u201d\n               Following this conversation with Calhoun, Turner said: \u201cI\n        got in my truck and left, and that\u2019s when I put the word out that I\n        was looking to buy guns and drugs.\u201d As indicated supra at 8\u201311,\n        Calhoun maintained that he never gave Turner permission to buy\n        guns.\n              In response to the prosecutor\u2019s question on cross-examina-\n        tion, \u201cwhen did your relationship with the Selma Police\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364       Document: 42-1        Date Filed: 03/01/2023       Page: 43 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                 Opinion of the Court                            43\n\n        Department and with Detective Calhoun, under which you agreed\n        to be purportedly a criminal or confidential informant, begin?\u201d\n        Turner said: \u201cWhen they stopped me in July.

Turner answered: \u201cNo.\u201d\n               The word Turner put on the street did not yield a firearm\n        transaction until November 6. That day, he bought one of the two\n        AR-15s described in the indictment. A man he referred to as \u201cOG,\u201d\n        whose sister used to live in the second-story apartment across from\n        Mary\u2019s, had contacted him in October. OG called to say that he\n        had an AR-15 for sale. He quoted a price of $450 to $500. Turner\n        said he had $200 and could give him the rest later. OG agreed and\n        sold Turner the rifle. 66\n               Later in the day, a man Turner had worked with at Planta-\n        tion Patterns years ago, Lonnie Thomas (whom Turner referred to\n        as \u201cMain\u201d), called Turner to say he had guns for sale.

The ledger contained this entry: \u201cOG ... three or $400.\u201d\n        Turner explained, seemingly referring to OG: \u201cone of them owed me money\n        and came and asked me to borrow some money and I told him no.\u201d\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364        Document: 42-1         Date Filed: 03/01/2023        Page: 44 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        44                         Opinion of the Court                      20-12364\n\n        revolvers, handguns, and rifles, including AR-15s.

He put the guns and the\n        marijuana in the spare bedroom closet because he did not want\n        Mary to discover the \u201cstuff.\u201d He was not \u201csupposed to have any of\n        it.\u201d It could \u201cdestroy [his] relationship\u201d with her.\n               On cross-examination, Turner admitted that he left the pis-\n        tol box closed in his mother\u2019s closet when he took the gun because\n        he \u201cdidn\u2019t want her to know\u201d he took it.

As indicated supra, he told\n        Calhoun the AR-15s were bought \u201coff the street\u201d and were \u201chot.\u201d He never\n        mentioned OG and Thomas as the men who sold him the AR-15s. (The initials\n        OG were in a ledger the officers found in the bedroom, as indicated in note\n        34, supra.) He knew he could not buy the firearms at a gun shop because he\n        was a convicted felon. As he told Calhoun, \u201cI been to the penitentiary for\u2014I\n        shot a couple of people and . . . and then when I got out I got straight back\n        out, but I went straight back in for shooting somebody again.\u201d\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364       Document: 42-1        Date Filed: 03/01/2023      Page: 45 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                 Opinion of the Court                           45\n\n        closet the day before, he said he did so because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want [his\n        girlfriend] to see them,\u201d as she did not allow guns in the home be-\n        cause of his status as a convicted felon. And when asked if he knew\n        he was not allowed to possess the firearms, he answered:\n               Legally, yes; you right. But I was given a leeway by\n               the police, from my understanding. I had to take pos-\n               session of them to help make a case. And I was told\n               whatever I did in reference to helping make cases,\n               that I would not be charged with it. That\u2019s why I had\n               the possession of the firearms.\n                                            II.\n                The defense rested after Turner testified. The Government\n        offered no rebuttal. Turner renewed his motion for judgment of\n        acquittal, 69 and the District Court denied the motion. The charge\n        conference followed. At that point, the prosecutor questioned the\n        sufficiency of the evidence to support Turner\u2019s insanity defense,\n        but not via a motion to strike the defense. Instead, the prosecutor\n        questioned whether the Court should instruct the jury on Turner\u2019s\n        insanity defense as proposed.\n               Prosecutor: The insanity instruction. The expert tes-\n               timony in this matter suggests that this instruction is\n               not appropriate and there\u2019s been nothing sufficient to\n               rebut that. We think that the insanity instruction is\n\n\n        69 Turner renewed the motion for judgment of acquittal he made at the close\n        of the Government\u2019s case in chief.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023      Page: 46 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        46                     Opinion of the Court                 20-12364\n\n              just going to lead to confusion of the issues for the\n              jury.\n              Court: Well, I think the opinion by the expert is just\n              like any other testimony. I understand what you\u2019re\n              saying. You may believe what she said, I may believe\n              what she said. But we\u2019re not going to be one of the\n              12 who decide what is true and what is false. They\n              could believe her, they could not believe her. They\n              could accept her opinion or reject it. I think they\n              likely will accept what she said as her honest beliefs.\n              But whether they agree with her and the conclusions\n              and inferences she wants them to draw, they can con-\n              clude and draw inferences of their own that are con-\n              trary to that. The defendant has testified, and I think\n              his testimony and the video of his interview is suffi-\n              cient for a jury to decide that he is insane\u2014or was in-\n              sane at the time, rather. I think it\u2019s a question, a fac-\n              tual question.\n              Prosecutor: I think, Your Honor, if I can just add one\n              more thing at least for the record? It appears the de-\n              fense might be trying to argue some kind of insanity\n              due to withdrawal of a substance. And to the extent\n              they are attempting to argue that, the law does not\n              support that as a ground for insanity.\n              Court: I agree with you. And in fact, that\u2019s why the\n              instruction says \u201cbut mental disease or defect doesn\u2019t\n              otherwise.\u201d In other words, if you have other mental\n              problems but they don\u2019t arise to the level of being a\n              severe mental disease or defect such that you cannot\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1     Date Filed: 03/01/2023     Page: 47 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364               Opinion of the Court                      47\n\n              appreciate the nature and quality and wrongfulness of\n              your act, that\u2019s not insanity. And I think that\u2019s where\n              you have to make your argument perhaps.\n               The Court told the prosecutor to draft an instruction dealing\n        with the withdrawal issue, stating that he would \u201cgive it.\u201d The\n        Court then adjourned for the day. Before the trial resumed the\n        next day for closing argument of counsel and the Court\u2019s submis-\n        sion of the case to the jury, the prosecutor announced: \u201cwe revis-\n        ited the issue of whether it was appropriate to have an intoxication\n        instruction added or withdrawal instruction, and ultimately de-\n        cided that that was not appropriate.\u201d Consequently, the jury was\n        not instructed on the role alcohol played, if any, in determining\n        whether Turner had a severe mental disease or defect on Novem-\n        ber 8, 2018.\n                Following the charge conference, the jury returned to the\n        courtroom to hear the parties\u2019 closing arguments and, after that,\n        the Court\u2019s instructions on the law. The prosecutor addressed the\n        jury first, and following defense counsel\u2019s remarks, presented a re-\n        buttal.\n              In her opening remarks, the prosecutor focused mainly on\n        Turner\u2019s credibility. She portrayed as unbelievable the notion that\n        Turner bought the AR-15 rifles because he was working under-\n        cover as a confidential informant for the SPD under Detective Cal-\n        houn\u2019s supervision. She argued his witness-stand explanation of\n        why he bought the rifles was made up.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1     Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 48 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        48                     Opinion of the Court                20-12364\n\n                The prosecutor pointed out the inconsistencies in the state-\n        ments Turner made about his acquisition of the rifles. On the wit-\n        ness stand, he contradicted what he said during the video-taped\n        post-arrest interview with Detective Calhoun at the SPD headquar-\n        ters on the day of the shootings. And he contradicted himself about\n        where and when he got possession of the pistol. The prosecutor\n        asked: \u201cDo you think Mr. Turner\u2019s elderly mother had this ex-\n        tended clip in her closet? (Indicating.) Does that make sense to\n        you?\u201d Regarding the elements of the felon-in-possession offense,\n        the prosecutor played the video tape of Turner\u2019s interview with\n        Calhoun. It established that Turner knew that he could not possess\n        the firearms as a convicted felon.\n               The prosecutor said very little about Turner\u2019s insanity de-\n        fense in her initial remarks. She mentioned the elements of the\n        defense and that Turner had the burden of establishing them.\n        Then, referring to the video tape of Calhoun\u2019s questioning of\n        Turner following his arrest, she asked: \u201cdid it seem like he was in-\n        sane?\u201d\n               In his remarks, defense counsel devoted a considerable por-\n        tion of his time to the insanity defense. He described Turner\u2019s\n        mental state on November 8 and argued that:\n              He was suffering from a severe mental defect. He\n              was a man that was delusional. He was hallucinating.\n              Things were falling on him, bugs were crawling on\n              him. He was seeing people outside. He thought peo-\n              ple were coming to get him. And that\u2019s not\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1     Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 49 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364               Opinion of the Court                      49\n\n              something\u2014they\u2019re trying to act like we made this up\n              in court. That\u2019s not something we made up in court.\n              The psychologist said that he was telling them that\n              back earlier this year when she first met him.\n               Implicitly referring to the first element of the insanity de-\n        fense\u2014that the defendant had a severe mental disease or defect\u2014\n        defense counsel said he and Dr. Barnette \u201ctalked about stress-in-\n        duced psychosis and brief psychotic disorder.\u201d Referencing Dr.\n        Barnette\u2019s testimony, he said psychosis is a \u201csevere mental problem\n        that causes people to lose touch with reality.\u201d He also argued that\n        Turner was \u201cscared for his life immediately,\u201d so he took the pistol\n        from his mother\u2019s house \u201cto protect himself\u201d in what he \u201ctruly be-\n        lieved\u201d was an \u201cemergency circumstance.\u201d\n               Regarding Turner\u2019s public authority and entrapment de-\n        fenses, counsel argued that Turner bought the AR-15s in reliance\n        on what he thought was permission from Calhoun to act as an in-\n        formant and that Calhoun and Nevin\u2019s claims that they never au-\n        thorized the gun purchases were not credible. Counsel recalled the\n        late September meeting at the ALEA office and what Turner said\n        the supervising ATF agent told him: \u201cYou\u2019ve got this hanging over\n        your head.

He\u2019s your point of\n        contact, but you\u2019re working for me.\u201d\n               The prosecutor waited for her rebuttal to refer to Dr. Bar-\n        nette\u2019s testimony and the insanity defense. After defense counsel\n        stepped down, she said this:\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364    Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023      Page: 50 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        50                     Opinion of the Court                20-12364\n\n              And Dr. Barnette testified that, based on all of that\n              time that she spent with Mr. Turner and looking at\n              the evidence that you\u2019ve seen, that there\u2019s no way\n              that he\u2019s going to be able to show you that he didn\u2019t\n              understand what he was doing was wrong. He defi-\n              nitely appreciated the nature of his actions. And ask\n              yourself this: If he really did not understand that what\n              he was doing was wrong when he had those guns in\n              his house on November 8th, why did he hide it from\n              Ms. Walker? He definitely understood. He knew that\n              what he was doing was wrong. He admitted as much\n              on the stand. The insanity defense here does not hold\n              water.\n                           *             *             *\n               The prosecutor said this without mentioning the insanity\n        defense\u2019s first and second elements\u2014that the defendant had \u201ca se-\n        vere mental disease or defect,\u201d and that his conduct was the \u201cre-\n        sult\u201d of that disease or defect. Instead, she focused on the third\n        element of the defense, which formed the foundation for her ob-\n        jected-to questions to Dr. Barnette\u2014whether Turner was \u201cunable\n        to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his\n        acts.\u201d\n                           *             *             *\n              The District Court submitted the case to the jury under the\n        Eleventh Circuit Pattern Instructions relating to the 18 U.S.C.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364        Document: 42-1         Date Filed: 03/01/2023       Page: 51 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                  Opinion of the Court                             51\n\n        \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense 70 and the insanity defense, 71 and under instruc-\n        tions composed by the Court and counsel relating to the public au-\n        thority defenses. 72 The Court also instructed the jury that it could\n        return a guilty verdict if it found Turner guilty of possessing any\n        one of the three firearms in Count One.

But if one cannot say, with fair assurance,\n               after pondering all that happened without stripping\n               the erroneous action from the whole, that the judg-\n               ment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is\n               impossible to conclude that substantial rights were\n               not affected. The inquiry cannot be merely whether\n               there was enough to support the result, apart from\n               the phase affected by the error. It is rather, even so,\n               whether the error itself had substantial influence.

To answer that question, we consider the\n        way in which Turner presented his insanity defense and the District\n        Court submitted it to the jury. Using the IDRA\u2019s lens, we focus on\n        the evidence Turner presented in an effort to prove his insanity de-\n        fense under \u00a7 17. The way in which his attorney conducted his de-\n        fense will assist us in doing that.\n               Turner\u2019s insanity defense was conducted and litigated as if\n        our decisions in Blake v. United States, 407 F.2d 908 (5th Cir. 1969)\n        (en banc), 77 and United States v. Milne, 487 F.2d 1232 (5th Cir.\n        1973), which predated the IDRA\u2019s enactment, governed the litiga-\n        tion of the defense. Prior to the IDRA\u2019s enactment in 1984, most\n        Federal courts, including the courts of our circuit, used some form\n        of the insanity defense proposed by the Model Penal Code. It pro-\n        vided that:\n               1. A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if\n                  at the time of such conduct as a result of mental\n                  disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity ei-\n                  ther to appreciate the criminality (wrongfulness)\n                  of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the\n                  requirements of law.\n               2. [T]he terms \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d do not in-\n                  clude an abnormality manifested only by repeated\n                  criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.\n\n\n        77 In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc),\n        we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit\n        handed down prior to October 1, 1981.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364       Document: 42-1        Date Filed: 03/01/2023        Page: 57 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                  Opinion of the Court                            57\n\n        Model Penal Code, \u00a7 4.01 (P.O.D. 1962).\n                In Blake, we adopted a version of the Model Penal Code\u2019s\n        definition. 407 F.2d at 916. We defined insanity in this way: \u201cA\n        person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such\n        conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial\n        capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to\n        conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d Id. 78 The de-\n        fendant could establish that he had the required mental state for\n        insanity by showing either: (1) that he could not appreciate that he\n        was doing something wrong\u2014meaning either that he was unaware\n        of what he was doing or that he \u201cappreciated that his conduct was\n        criminal but, because of a delusion, believed it to be morally justi-\n        fied\u201d; or (2) that he could not adequately control his conduct, even\n        if he knew he was doing something wrong. See id. at 914\u201316. We\n        have referred to the second option as the \u201cvolitional prong.\u201d\n        United States v. Cameron, 907 F.2d 1051, 1061 (11th Cir. 1990).\n                Under the IDRA, the defendant has the burden of proving\n        that he was insane at the time of the charged offense by clear and\n        convincing evidence. Not so under Blake. There, we presumed\n        that the defendant was sane at the time he committed the offense,\n        but if he presented only \u201cslight evidence\u201d that he was insane at that\n        time, he could shift to the prosecution the burden of proving\n\n\n        78 We also added that \u201cthe terms \u2018mental disease or defect\u2019 do not include an\n        abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial con-\n        duct.\u201d Blake, 407 F.2d at 916.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364       Document: 42-1          Date Filed: 03/01/2023          Page: 58 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        58                        Opinion of the Court                        20-12364\n\n        beyond a reasonable doubt that he was in fact sane. Blake, 407 F.2d\n        at 910\u201311. And that slight evidence could be in the form of lay tes-\n        timony alone. See United States v. Milne, 487 F.2d 1232, 1236 (5th\n        Cir. 1973).\n               Defense counsel presented Turner\u2019s insanity defense with\n        slight evidence, and he did so only with lay testimony as if Blake\n        and Milne controlled the conduct of the defense. When the prose-\n        cutor rested the Government\u2019s case in chief and the District Court\n        denied Turner\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, the prosecutor,\n        anticipating that Turner would be relying on lay testimony to\n        prove his insanity defense and that the testimony might not com-\n        ply with Rule 701 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, expressed her\n        concern to the Court.\n               Prosecutor: Your Honor, we understand that defense\n               intends to offer some lay witness testimony regarding\n               Mr. Turner\u2019s mental state and competency perhaps.\n               And we would just request an order limiting any lay\n               witness testimony to be within the bounds of rule\n               701. 79\n\n\n\n        79 Rule 701, Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses, states:\n               If a witness is not testifying as an expert, testimony in the form\n               of an opinion is limited to one that is:\n               (a) rationally based on the witness\u2019s perception;\n               (b) helpful to clearly understanding the witness\u2019s testimony or\n               to determining a fact in issue; and\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364        Document: 42-1         Date Filed: 03/01/2023      Page: 59 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364                  Opinion of the Court                           59\n\n               Court: Well, I don\u2019t know what witnesses\u2014\n               Defense: That was\u2014\n               Prosecutor: Lay witness opinion versus expert opin-\n               ion.\n               Defense: Judge, I don\u2019t think\u2014my client would not\n               be giving any opinion on my client\u2019s\u2014you know,\n               what condition he may suffer from or anything.

During the conference, the prosecutor\u2014tacitly ac-\n        knowledging that the defense had put on some evidence of insan-\n        ity\u2014said, regarding the Court\u2019s proposed jury instruction on the\n        insanity defense: \u201c[t]he expert testimony in this matter suggests\n        that this instruction is not appropriate and there\u2019s been nothing suf-\n        ficient to rebut that.\u201d In other words, Turner\u2019s evidence of insan-\n        ity\u2014Mary Walker\u2019s testimony (which, according to defense coun-\n        sel earlier, would establish Turner\u2019s insanity defense) and Turner\u2019s\n        testimony\u2014had not rebutted Dr. Barnette\u2019s expert testimony.\n               The District Court disagreed. Walker\u2019s and Turner\u2019s lay tes-\n        timony was sufficient to submit the insanity defense to the jury.\n        Without objection, the Court therefore submitted the defense to\n        the jury under an instruction the IDRA would require, including\n        the provision that Turner had the burden of proving the defense\n        by clear and convincing evidence. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 17(b).\n              To consider whether Dr. Barnette\u2019s testimony that violated\n        Rule 704(b) harmed Turner\u2019s substantial rights, we now consider\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 61 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364               Opinion of the Court                       61\n\n        the sufficiency of Turner\u2019s insanity defense under the IDRA. We\n        first observe what is required under the IDRA.

His right to\n        present the defense constituted his \u201csubstantial rights\u201d under Rule\n        52(a). He introduced nothing to prove his defense other than Mary\n        Walker\u2019s testimony and his behavior. And Dr. Barnette did not\n        diagnose him with a qualifying \u201csevere mental disease or defect\u201d\n        under \u00a7 17(a). To find that he established his defense, the jury\n        would have had to speculate that he had a severe mental disease or\n        defect and that it in fact caused his wrongful conduct. And the law\n        would not allow the jury to do that. So, the erroneous admission\n        of Dr. Barnette\u2019s opinions about his mental state did not affect\n        Turner\u2019s substantial rights. Moreover, the record is replete with\n        evidence that he realized that he could not lawfully possess a fire-\n        arm. Dr. Barnette\u2019s opinions, which were consistent with what he\n        readily acknowledged, caused him no prejudice.\n                                               IV.\n               For the reasons we have expressed, the judgment of the Dis-\n        trict Court is\n                        AFFIRMED.\n\n\n        v. Poolaw, 588 F.2d 103, 105 (5th Cir. 1979) (affirming a trial court\u2019s refusal to\n        instruct a jury that chronic alcoholism was a qualifying mental disease or de-\n        fect). Voluntary intoxication thus cannot qualify as a severe mental disease or\n        defect under \u00a7 17(a).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 64 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364        ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part                  1\n\n\n\n        ROSENBAUM, Circuit Judge, Dissenting in Part:\n               I agree with my colleagues that introduction of Dr. Bar-\n        nette\u2019s testimony was an abuse of discretion. But on this record,\n        that error was not harmless.\n               The Majority Opinion concludes that the improper testi-\n        mony did not impose harm because Turner\u2019s insanity defense was\n        insufficient as a matter of law. But the district court determined\n        that Turner presented sufficient evidence to allow the jury to find\n        that he satisfied the IDRA\u2019s definition of insanity and therefore in-\n        structed the jury on the insanity defense. That decision is not be-\n        fore us on appeal.\n               Instead, our harmless-error analysis examines whether we\n        can say \u201cwith fair assurance, after pondering all that happened\n        without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the\n        judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\u201d Kotteakos\n        v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S. Ct. 1239, 1248 (1946). By\n        focusing its attention on the legal sufficiency of Turner\u2019s defense,\n        the Majority Opinion incorrectly saddles Turner with the burden\n        of proving prejudice. But Turner preserved his challenge to the\n        improper testimony, and when we conduct harmless-error analysis\n        of a preserved challenge, the government bears the burden of prov-\n        ing harmlessness. United States v. Gamory, 635 F.3d 480, 494 (11th\n        Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). That burden \u201cis not easy for the\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1       Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 65 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        2                ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part          20-12364\n\n        government to meet.\u201d United States v. Mathenia, 409 F.3d 1289,\n        1292 (11th Cir. 2005). And here, the government hasn\u2019t met it.\n               But it\u2019s not just that the Majority Opinion wrongly foists the\n        government\u2019s burden on Turner. As I show below, every one of\n        the several factors that guides our harmless-error analysis, see Peat,\n        Inc. v. Vanguard Res., Inc., 378 F.3d 1154, 1162 (11th Cir. 2004),\n        supports the conclusion that the error here was not harmless. And\n        overall, the weight of that conclusion is crushing. So I respectfully\n        dissent. I would vacate the judgment and remand for a new trial.\n                                          I.\n               The incident that led to Jessie Turner\u2019s arrest was anything\n        but routine. On November 8, 2018, Turner grabbed an AR-15 and\n        blasted fourteen bullets into the walls of his empty apartment. He\n        hallucinated men were breaking into his apartment to try to kill\n        him. In fact, Turner thought he heard voices on the other side of\n        his door, conspiring, \u201cAs soon as he opens, I\u2019m gonna fire him up.\u201d\n        Then, he thought he heard knocking and bumping at the back of\n        the door as if the men were trying to break it down.\n               Although Turner didn\u2019t know who the men were, he\n        thought he knew why they supposedly were there: Turner was\n        sure they had learned he had been working with the police as an\n        informant. So after sliding a .40-caliber handgun into his back\n        pocket and two magazines into his front pockets, Turner ducked\n        into a room and frantically called the police. Once the police ar-\n        rived, Turner made his escape. In response to Turner\u2019s\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364      Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023     Page: 66 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364         ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part                   3\n\n        hallucination that the intruders were firing bullets through the\n        backdoor, Turned returned fire, ran out the front door, down the\n        stairwell, and exited his building\u2014AR-15 in hand. Upon leaving,\n        he set the gun down, laid down on the ground, and complied with\n        police as they placed him into custody.\n                A sweep of Turner\u2019s apartment revealed fourteen bullet\n        shells scattered throughout, bullet holes in his walls, and a second\n        AR-15. But the police neither found intruders nor any evidence of\n        an attempted intrusion. By all accounts, Turner hallucinated the\n        attack. For ease of reference, I refer through the rest of this dissent\n        to this incident as the \u201cImagined Siege.\u201d\n               At the risk of stating the obvious, most people don\u2019t halluci-\n        nate that they are the subject of a coordinated, life-threatening\n        siege\u2014especially not to the point where they repeatedly fire a gun\n        in their defense. To understand why Turner did and the signifi-\n        cance of Dr. Barnette\u2019s expert testimony that Turner was nonethe-\n        less sane despite his unusual behavior, we must go back to July\n        2018. At that time, Selma Police Department Detective Willie Cal-\n        houn and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (\u201cATF\u201d) Spe-\n        cial Agent Tom Nevin caught Turner with a gun in his waistband\n        during a traffic stop. The police could have arrested Turner. In-\n        stead, Turner and the officers agreed that, in exchange for letting\n        him go, Turner would provide information to them about un-\n        solved crime in Selma.\n              Just a few days after the stop, Turner sent Detective Cal-\n        houn text messages containing photographs of guns available for\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1     Date Filed: 03/01/2023   Page: 67 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        4               ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part         20-12364\n\n        purchase from a street dealer. Later that afternoon, at 2:58 p.m.,\n        Detective Calhoun forwarded those pictures to Agent Nevin. At\n        trial, the government introduced this series of messages as Govern-\n        ment\u2019s Exhibit 15.\n\n\n\n\n                The photos contained two assault rifles and seven handguns.\n        Detective Calhoun accompanied the pictures of the guns with a\n        note to Agent Nevin: \u201cTurner just sent these, this is supposedly\n        what the[] guy [is] tryin to sell him.\u201d Agent Nevin replied in-\n        stantly\u2014at 2:59 p.m.\u2014\u201cBuy em.\u201d Agent Nevin even offered to re-\n        imburse Detective Calhoun to pay for Turner to buy the weapons.\n        But Detective Calhoun responded that he\u2019d instead tell Turner to\n        stall the dealer.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1     Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 68 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364        ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part                 5\n\n               Over the next few months, Turner continued to call and text\n        Detective Calhoun to try to assist law enforcement. At one point,\n        Turner asked Detective Calhoun if Calhoun could help Turner get\n        a recording device so that Turner could \u201crecord what\u2019s being talked\n        about.\u201d Detective Calhoun did not discourage Turner. To the con-\n        trary, he replied, \u201cOh I\u2019ll see what I can find.\u201d Yet Detective Cal-\n        houn testified he never tried to do so, and he didn\u2019t even intend to\n        try. Detective Calhoun said he was just trying to \u201cbrush him off\n        basically.\u201d But Detective Calhoun never made that clear to\n        Turner. Rather, he continued to lead Turner on.\n              Towards the end of September, for example, Detective Cal-\n        houn summoned Turner to the Alabama Law Enforcement Center\n        for a meeting with himself, Agent Nevin, and other ATF agents.\n        Agent Nevin explained that they invited Turner to see if they\n        \u201ccould get him to go out on the street and find out possibly who\n        may have committed\u201d an unsolved shooting of an officer.\n               Turner testified that the agent leading the meeting initially\n        explained that they were hoping to learn about the shooting. But\n        the conversation later turned to the agent\u2019s interest in \u201ctrying to\n        stop all criminal elements in Selma.\u201d The ATF agent reminded\n        Turner of the potential charge hanging over his head and empha-\n        sized his power to make it \u201cdisappear.\u201d And Turner recalled that\n        the agent encouraged him to continue to report to Detective Cal-\n        houn to help law enforcement build criminal cases and remove\n        weapons from the streets.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1     Date Filed: 03/01/2023   Page: 69 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        6               ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part         20-12364\n\n               To advance these efforts for law enforcement, Turner ex-\n        plained, on November 6, he purchased the two AR-15s he used in\n        the Imagined Siege. Two days later, according to Turner, he be-\n        lieved he was being stalked by armed men planning to kill him be-\n        cause of his cooperation with law enforcement. So he grabbed a\n        handgun from his mother\u2019s house for protection. Later that same\n        afternoon, Turner was arrested, following the Imagined Siege.\n               At his trial, Turner introduced significant evidence that he\n        was experiencing a psychological disorder preceding and at the\n        time of the Imagined Siege. Turner\u2019s girlfriend Mary Walker ob-\n        served Turner acting bizarrely in the days and hours leading up to\n        his arrest. She testified that Turner had been \u201ctalking out of his\n        head\u201d for \u201ca couple of days before his arrest,\u201d complaining of\n        \u201cwhite stuff falling on him\u201d and asking her whether someone \u201cdid\n        something to him\u201d or \u201cput something on him.\u201d Then, the night\n        before his arrest, Turner brought Walker into their bathroom and\n        asked her to listen closely. Walker asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n        Turner shut the light off and told her to \u201cbe quiet.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you\n        hear them outside?\u201d Turner asked. \u201cNo, J,\u201d she answered. \u201cHear\n        who?\u201d Turner replied, \u201cListen, Mary, listen. Somebody outside is\n        trying to get me.\u201d Walker looked out the window but couldn\u2019t see\n        anybody. For the rest of the night, Turner complained of voices\n        and armed men lurking outside his apartment. Eventually, he\n        called the police.\n               And Officer Ashley Gaskins responded. The officer testified\n        that at around two or three in the morning, Turner called the\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364      Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023     Page: 70 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364         ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part                   7\n\n        police to report three men carrying AK-47s and AR-15s, running\n        around his apartment trying to \u201cget\u201d him. After \u201cclear[ing] the im-\n        mediate area\u201d and looking around, Officer Gaskins found no one\n        and nothing supporting what Turner had reported.\n               Walker called Turner from work the next day. Walker said\n        that when he answered the phone, he was \u201cscreaming hysteri-\n        cally.\u201d She explained he was convinced people were trying to kill\n        him. He begged her to call the police.\n               Although Dr. Barnette did not diagnose him with it, she\n        acknowledged that Turner\u2019s symptoms were consistent with two\n        forms of psychosis: one known as \u201cstress induced psychosis\u201d and\n        the other called \u201calcohol withdrawal psychosis.\u201d Psychosis, Dr.\n        Barnette explained, \u201cis a severe mental disorder\u201d that can cause a\n        person to lose his ability to understand the nature and conse-\n        quences of his actions. As its name suggests, stress-induced psy-\n        chosis is a short-term version of psychosis caused by debilitating\n        levels of stress. And unsurprisingly, alcohol withdrawal psychosis\n        is caused by severe alcohol withdrawal. It causes the sufferer\u2019s\n        thoughts and emotions to detach from reality, and its symptoms\n        include \u201chearing voices and see things.\u201d\n               Turner argued that he was suffering from psychosis when\n        he undertook the offense conduct charged in the indictment. More\n        specifically, he asserted that the possibility of returning to prison,\n        the stress of his perceived responsibilities as a police informant, and\n        the fear that he would be the victim of retaliation from those whose\n        actions he was reporting about pushed him over the edge. It was\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364      Document: 42-1       Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 71 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        8                ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part           20-12364\n\n        in this context that Dr. Barnette offered her expert opinion that\n        Turner understood that what he was doing was wrong during the\n        Imagined Siege and the events leading up to it.\n                                          II.\n               The Majority Opinion agrees that Dr. Barnette\u2019s testimony\n        violated Rule 704(b) and that the district court erred in allowing it.\n        But the Majority Opinion concludes that the district court\u2019s error\n        was harmless because, in the Majority Opinion\u2019s view, Turner\u2019s in-\n        sanity defense was insufficient as a matter of law.\n                The Majority Opinion makes two primary errors. First, by\n        declaring that Turner\u2019s alleged mental disease or defect was not\n        sufficiently severe and that it did not in fact cause his wrongful con-\n        duct, the Majority Opinion usurps the jury\u2019s role and substitutes\n        itself as the factfinder. Second, the Majority Opinion ignores that\n        the government carries the burden to show that Dr. Barnette\u2019s im-\n        proper testimony was harmless and omits discussion of any of the\n        relevant factors that guide our harmless-error analysis. I\u2019ll address\n        these errors in turn.\n              A. The jury could consider Turner\u2019s insanity defense.\n               The Majority Opinion suggests that Turner\u2019s insanity de-\n        fense could have satisfied the pre-IDRA standard but cannot satisfy\n        the IDRA because the IDRA requires an alleged mental disease or\n        defect to be \u201csevere.\u201d But once the court provides the legal defini-\n        tion of \u201csevere,\u201d the jury\u2014not the court\u2014makes the ultimate de-\n        termination of whether a defendant has provided clear and\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364      Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023     Page: 72 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364         ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part                   9\n\n        convincing evidence that his mental disease meets that legal defini-\n        tion.

Long, 562 F.3d 325, 334 (5th Cir. 2009).\n                And here, the jury did not have an opportunity to reach a\n        conclusion on the severity of Turner\u2019s alleged mental disease with-\n        out the prejudice inflicted by Dr. Barnette\u2019s improper testimony.\n        Absent that testimony, the jury may have reasonably determined\n        that Turner\u2019s alleged psychosis was sufficiently severe to preclude\n        Turner from understanding the nature and quality or wrongfulness\n        of his acts. Or the jury may have still found Turner guilty. But on\n        this record, I cannot firmly conclude, as the Majority Opinion does,\n        that no reasonable jury could find that Turner\u2019s condition was \u201cse-\n        vere\u201d under the IDRA.\n                The Majority Opinion also rejects Turner\u2019s insanity argu-\n        ments because an insanity defense cannot be based on voluntary\n        intoxication. But Turner did not argue that his mental illness was\n        attributable to alcohol. Instead, he pointed the jury to several fac-\n        tors that, in his view, caused his psychosis, including the possibility\n        of returning to prison, the stress of his perceived responsibilities as\n        an informant, and the fear that he would be the victim of retaliation\n        if his connections discovered that he was communicating with law\n        enforcement about their illicit activity. Even though Dr. Barnette\n        testified that alcohol withdrawal was a possible explanation for\n        Turner\u2019s symptoms, Turner presented a theory of defense that was\n        independent of alcohol. The jury was entitled to credit either ver-\n        sion without Dr. Barnette\u2019s improper testimony placing a heavy\n        thumb on the scale in the government\u2019s favor.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023     Page: 73 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        10               ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part          20-12364\n\n               The Majority Opinion concludes that \u201cthe law would not al-\n        low the jury\u201d to find that Turner was legally insane. In doing so,\n        the Majority Opinion implicitly suggests that the district court\n        erred in allowing the jury to consider Turner\u2019s insanity defense at\n        all. But that decision is not properly before us. And even if it were,\n        the district court correctly permitted the jury to consider Turner\u2019s\n        insanity defense. Because of \u201cthe jury\u2019s right to determine credibil-\n        ity, to weigh the evidence, and to draw justifiable inferences of\n        fact,\u201d we have explained that a district court \u201cmust construe the\n        evidence most favorably to the defendant\u201d when deciding whether\n        to provide a jury instruction based on insanity. United States v.\n        Owens, 854 F.2d 432, 435 (11th Cir. 1988). Under that standard,\n        the admissible testimony from Turner, Walker, and Officer Gas-\n        kins permitted \u201ca reasonable jury to find that insanity has been\n        shown with convincing clarity.\u201d Id.\n               Because the district court properly instructed the jury on\n        Turner\u2019s insanity defense, I disagree with the Majority Opinion\u2019s\n        conclusion that the error here was harmless based solely on the no-\n        tion that Turner did not satisfy his burden to provide clear and con-\n        vincing evidence of a severe mental disease or defect.\n             B. The government did not meet its burden to show that\n                 Dr. Barnette\u2019s improper testimony was harmless.\n               To determine whether Dr. Barnette\u2019s improper testimony\n        prejudiced Turner, I turn to whether the government satisfied its\n        burden to show that the improper testimony was harmless. In my\n        view, it did not.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364        Document: 42-1         Date Filed: 03/01/2023        Page: 74 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364           ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part                         11\n\n                Several factors guide our analysis.1 See Peat, 378 F.3d at\n        1162. These factors include \u201cthe number of errors, the closeness of\n        the factual disputes (i.e., the strength of the evidence on the issues\n        affected by the error), . . . the prejudicial effect of the evidence at\n        issue[,] . . . whether counsel intentionally elicited the evidence,\n        whether counsel focused on the evidence during the trial, and\n        whether any cautionary or limiting instructions were given.\u201d Id.\n        (citations omitted). Assessing each issue ensures we fully flesh out\n        the impact an error may have had on a verdict.\n                When we apply these factors here, the record leaves no\n        doubt that \u201cthe error may have had a \u2018substantial influence\u2019 on the\n        outcome of the proceeding.\u201d United States v. Bradley, 644 F.3d\n        1213, 1270 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting United States v. Montalvo-Mu-\n        rillo, 495 U.S. 711, 722, 110 S. Ct. 2072, 2080 (1990)).\n                   1. The insanity issue was important in the trial.\n               I begin with the importance of the issue to which Dr. Bar-\n        nette\u2019s improper testimony relates. The importance of the issue\n        weighs decisively in Turner\u2019s favor.\n              Turner raised two defenses: insanity and entrapment by es-\n        toppel. Although he presented them independently, as the facts I\n        have set forth above reveal, they complemented each other in an\n        important way. Specifically, Turner argued that his insanity\n\n\n        1 Peat was a civil case, not a criminal one. But the factors Peat identifies are\n        just as applicable in criminal cases as they are in civil ones.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1     Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 75 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        12              ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part         20-12364\n\n        resulted in significant part from the stress of working as a police\n        informant and the threat of incarceration he faced stemming from\n        the uncharged conduct looming over his head. Though Turner\n        believed working for the police was his ticket to avoid prison, that\n        ticket had an expensive price: from Turner\u2019s perspective, it put his\n        life on the line.\n                And although Detective Calhoun and Agent Nevin testified\n        they never considered Turner to be a confidential informant, the\n        evidence reveals no attempt on their part to disabuse him of his\n        belief that he was. So for Turner, the pressure of seeking to earn\n        relief from the potential prison sentence continued to mount.\n        Eventually, Turner explained, when the pressure became too\n        heavy for him to bear, he snapped beneath it.\n               Turner was not the only one to testify to how he reacted to\n        this pressure. Rather, Officer Gaskins and Mary Walker confirmed\n        Turner\u2019s psychological deterioration and, along with Dr. Barnette,\n        laid the \u201cbuilding blocks of fact\u201d underlying his claim of insanity.\n        See United States v. Jeri, 869 F.3d 1247, 1266 (11th Cir. 2017). And\n        because the issue of sanity was so fundamental to Turner\u2019s case, it\n        became central to the government\u2019s case as well. Indeed, that is\n        why the government called Dr. Barnette and asked the district\n        court to exempt her from the rule of sequestration. See Fed. R.\n        Evid. 615(c).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1     Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 76 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364        ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part                13\n\n             2. The government intentionally elicited the evidence.\n                Next, there is no disputing that the government intention-\n        ally elicited Dr. Barnette\u2019s testimony. Right out of the box, during\n        the government\u2019s opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury\n        it would hear Dr. Barnette testify that \u201cno, [Turner\u2019s] not crimi-\n        nally insane; that he could appreciate the nature of his actions and\n        the impact of the decisions that he made when he chose on several\n        occasions to go out and pick up firearms.\u201d\n                It only got worse from there. Though Turner\u2019s attorney at-\n        tempted to preclude the government from eliciting the improper\n        testimony from Dr. Barnette before she took the stand, the court\n        declined to rule. Then the government reassured the court that\n        \u201c[i]t doesn\u2019t behoove us to go beyond what\u2019s allowed.\u201d\n               But behoove the government or not, that\u2019s just what the\n        government did. It asked Dr. Barnette several times, point-blank,\n        to give her opinion on Turner\u2019s ability to appreciate the nature and\n        wrongfulness of his actions on November 8. In short, the govern-\n        ment deliberately elicited Dr. Barnette\u2019s improper 704(b) testi-\n        mony and leaned on it in its theory of the case and its argument.\n                3. The government emphasized and repeated the\n                                    evidence.\n              As I\u2019ve noted, the government repeatedly employed Dr.\n        Barnette\u2019s improper opinion throughout its case. The prosecutor\n        presented the opinion in the government\u2019s opening statement,\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1     Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 77 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        14              ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part          20-12364\n\n        elicited it twice during the government\u2019s case-in-chief, and ham-\n        mered the point home during closing argument.\n               Not only did the government highlight Dr. Barnette\u2019s im-\n        proper opinion throughout the trial, but it further signaled to the\n        jury the importance of Dr. Barnette as a witness and Dr. Barnette\u2019s\n        testimony by obtaining her exemption from the rule of sequestra-\n        tion. This strategy allowed Dr. Barnette to remain in the court-\n        room throughout the entire trial, providing a visual reminder of\n        Dr. Barnette\u2019s improper testimony that Turner was not insane at\n        the time of the offense.\n                        4. The factual dispute was close.\n               Turner established solid \u201cbuilding blocks of fact\u201d to support\n        his insanity defense. Jeri, 869 F.3d at 1266. Indeed, the district\n        court concluded Turner carried the burden needed to justify an in-\n        sanity instruction. And that is no small feat. See United States v.\n        Owens, 854 F.2d 432, 435 (11th Cir. 1988).\n                Several sources of evidence reveal that Turner was experi-\n        encing a psychological disorder during and in the events leading up\n        to the Imagined Siege. Perhaps most obviously, Turner grabbed\n        an AR-15 and blasted fourteen bullets into the walls of his empty\n        apartment because he imagined men had broken in and were try-\n        ing to kill him. Second, Walker, Officer Gaskins, and Turner all\n        testified that Turner had been seeing and hearing things that did\n        not exist\u2014bugs crawling on his body, white stuff falling from the\n        ceiling, armed men running around his apartment, and voices\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364     Document: 42-1     Date Filed: 03/01/2023   Page: 78 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364        ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part               15\n\n        warning him of his imminent doom. Third, even Dr. Barnette con-\n        ceded that this kind of behavior\u2014seeing and hearing things that do\n        not exist\u2014was consistent with \u201cpsychosis,\u201d a \u201csevere mental disor-\n        der.\u201d Fourth, the peculiar details of Turner\u2019s work as a de facto\n        police informant supported his claim of psychological deteriora-\n        tion.\n               Turner explained that his fear of being found out by mem-\n        bers of the community aggravated the stress he was already feeling\n        from the possibility of prison and from working as an informant.\n        And Turner\u2019s dealings with Detective Calhoun and Agent Nevin\n        only amplified that stress. Though Turner was encouraged to\n        solve crimes and record confessions, Detective Calhoun and Agent\n        Nevin never gave him any assurances for his safety. Rather, Agent\n        Nevin and Detective Calhoun explained that each of their depart-\n        ments had policies, procedures, rules, and regulations that gov-\n        erned the safe and appropriate use of police informants. But they\n        also testified that these rules did not apply to Turner because, in\n        their view, he wasn\u2019t an informant. This is so, even though Detec-\n        tive Calhoun asked Turner to come to a meeting with law-enforce-\n        ment agents so, according to Agent Nevin, they \u201ccould get him to\n        go out on the street to find out possibly who may have [shot] the\n        officer.\u201d\n               Given that Turner thought he was supposed to track down\n        a shooter and provide law enforcement information about illegal\n        sales of firearms\u2014all without protection of any type\u2014it would be\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364       Document: 42-1         Date Filed: 03/01/2023       Page: 79 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        16                 ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part               20-12364\n\n        reasonable for a juror to conclude that a relationship of this nature\n        could push a man off the edge into stress-induced psychosis.\n                To be sure, the verdict indicates that the jury rejected\n        Turner\u2019s entrapment-by-estoppel defense, which suggests it prob-\n        ably rejected his argument that the officers authorized him to pur-\n        chase firearms on their behalf. But given the evidence of Turner\u2019s\n        relationship with Detective Calhoun and Agent Nevin and the evi-\n        dence that Turner lost his grip on reality in the days leading up to\n        his arrest, it doesn\u2019t require a leap of logic to infer (1) that Turner\n        believed that he was authorized to purchase weapons, and (2) that\n        that belief was related to the psychosis he developed in the days\n        leading up to November 8th. In fact, it seems likely the jury, at the\n        very least, reached this first conclusion, since it acquitted Turner of\n        possession of a stolen firearm. To that charge, Turner was entitled\n        to raise an \u201cinnocent intent\u201d defense. We\u2019ve described the \u201cinno-\n        cent intent\u201d defense as essentially a way for a defendant to \u201cback-\n        door\u201d a rejected affirmative defense (like entrapment by estoppel)\n        if he testifies \u201cthat he genuinely believed that the criminal acts he\n        performed were done at the direction, and with the permission, of\n        an appropriate governmental agency.\u201d2 United States v. Alvarado,\n        808 F.3d 474, 486 (11th Cir. 2015).\n\n\n\n        2 The difference between an innocent-intent defense and an entrapment-by-\n        estoppel defense is that the former does not require proof that the government\n        officer in fact authorized the action; it just requires evidence the defendant\n        honestly believed the action was authorized. Id. at 486-87. Succeeding under\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364        Document: 42-1         Date Filed: 03/01/2023         Page: 80 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364           ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part                          17\n\n               The Majority Opinion notes that the record includes evi-\n        dence that Turner knew he could not possess a firearm. But that\n        fact does not render the improper admission of Dr. Barnette\u2019s opin-\n        ion harmless.\n                Turner\u2019s knowledge that he was a felon does not mean he\n        could appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions here. Under some\n        conditions, a felon may lawfully possess a firearm, even if he knows\n        he\u2019s a felon. Take, for instance, a felon who has received authori-\n        zation to possess a gun by a government official, and he reasonably\n        relies on that authorization. In such a case, that felon\u2019s possession\n        would be lawful. See Alvarado, 808 F.3d at 485. Similarly, even a\n        felon cannot be held criminally responsible for possessing a firearm\n        if he does so under the fear of unlawful and imminent threat of\n        serious bodily injury. United States v. Deleveaux, 205 F.3d 1292,\n        1297 (11th Cir. 2000). So if Turner believed\u2014by reason of mental\n        defect\u2014that he needed to possess a firearm because (1) he was in\n        imminent danger of serious injury or (2) he was authorized to pos-\n        sess a firearm, then it follows that his mental defect caused his ina-\n        bility to appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions. Here, the rec-\n        ord supports both theories.\n               In sum, the factual dispute over whether Turner was sane at\n        the time of the offense conduct was a close one.\n\n\n\n        the innocent-intent theory doesn\u2019t even \u201crequire that the defendant demon-\n        strate that his \u2018honest belief\u2019 was reasonable[.]\u201d Id. at 494 (citation omitted).\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364      Document: 42-1     Date Filed: 03/01/2023     Page: 81 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        18                ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part         20-12364\n\n             5. The failure to provide a curative instruction allowed the\n                   jury to consider Dr. Barnette\u2019s improper testimony\n                          in evaluating Turner\u2019s insanity defense.\n                 As for limiting jury instructions, the court gave only the\n        standard expert witness instruction, which explained that an ex-\n        pert\u2019s opinion is not binding. But here, not only was the admission\n        of Dr. Barnette\u2019s testimony error, but also her improper testimony\n        was central to the sanity issue and the closeness of the dispute. So\n        it should have been addressed with a curative instruction. See, e.g.,\n        United States v. Dixon, 185 F.3d 393, 400 (5th Cir. 1999). But be-\n        cause the district court did not appreciate its error, it never gave a\n        curative instruction. The absence of any curative instruction made\n        it all the more unlikely that the jury, on its own, ignored Dr. Bar-\n        nette\u2019s improper testimony. After all, we presume juries follow in-\n        structions. United States v. Brown, 983 F.2d 201, 203 (11th Cir.\n        1993).\n             6. Dr. Barnette\u2019s testimony had a prejudicial effect on the\n                                  issue of Turner\u2019s sanity.\n               We have recognized the danger of juries placing \u201cundue\n        weight\u201d on the testimony of an expert witness. United States v.\n        Alvarez, 837 F.2d 1024, 1030 (11th Cir. 1988). That danger only\n        increases when the expert is effectively a government agent (like a\n        Bureau of Prisons forensic psychologist, as Dr. Barnette was when\n        she examined Turner) testifying on behalf of the prosecution. In\n        those cases, \u201ca serious risk of undue prejudice exists.\u201d Id. Plus,\n        Rule 704(b) itself \u201crecognizes that expert testimony concerning a\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364      Document: 42-1      Date Filed: 03/01/2023      Page: 82 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20-12364         ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part                   19\n\n        defendant\u2019s mental state poses a uniquely heightened danger of in-\n        truding on the jury\u2019s function.\u201d United States v. DiDomenico, 985\n        F.2d 1159, 1164 (2d Cir. 1993) (collecting cases). So when a govern-\n        ment expert testifies to a defendant\u2019s mental state, the danger of\n        unfair prejudice is trebly worrisome.\n           7. The totality of the factors strongly favors the conclusion\n                   that the government did not satisfy its burden to\n                               demonstrate harmless error.\n                Overall, every one of the factors we consider to evaluate the\n        harmlessness of an error points to the conclusion that the error\n        here was not harmless. The issue on which Dr. Barnette improp-\n        erly opined\u2014Turner\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense conduct\u2014\n        was not just important but critical. The government intentionally\n        elicited the evidence. And then it repeated and emphasized it. Not\n        only that, but the factual dispute over Turner\u2019s sanity was certainly\n        close, with even an officer testifying to Turner\u2019s odd behavior. But\n        because the court did not realize its error, it did not offer the jury a\n        curative instruction, leaving the jury free to conclude\u2014with Dr.\n        Barnette\u2019s blessing (in the form of her improper opinion testi-\n        mony)\u2014that Turner was not insane. And finally, when a criminal\n        defendant raises an insanity defense, it\u2019s hard to imagine a more\n        damaging move for the government to make than to call the psy-\n        chologist who evaluated him to testify that he was not insane. Dr.\n        Barnette\u2019s improper expert opinion\u2014sharpened on the stone of her\n        credentials\u2014drove a sword through the heart of Turner\u2019s insanity\n        defense.\n\fUSCA11 Case: 20-12364      Document: 42-1       Date Filed: 03/01/2023    Page: 83 of 83\n\n\n\n\n        20               ROSENBAUM, J., Dissenting in Part           20-12364\n\n                                         III.\n               For these reasons, the government failed to show that its\n        purposeful and repeated admission of and reliance on Dr. Bar-\n        nette\u2019s improper testimony was harmless. Rather, in my view, it\n        seems clear that there\u2019s a reasonable possibility that but for the tes-\n        timony, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\n               I respectfully dissent.\n\f",
