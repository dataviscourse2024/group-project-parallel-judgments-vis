He alleges his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to several\n\ninstances of prosecutorial misconduct, in failing to object to the admissibility of\n\ncertain evidence, and in failing to pursue alternative defenses. We affirm.\n\nI.     Background Facts & Proceedings\n\n       Clancy and Paul Tillman were acquaintances and spent time together target\n\nshooting, fishing, and smoking marijuana. After Clancy loaned Tillman $400, they\n\narranged for Tillman to periodically obtain marijuana for Clancy. Clancy would give\n\nTillman the money necessary for the purchase of the marijuana; Tillman would buy\n\ndrugs for Clancy.\n\n       In late May 2016, Clancy requested that Tillman purchase $300 worth of\n\nmarijuana for him. Clancy dropped off the money for the purchase at Tillman\u2019s\n\nplace of employment. Tillman indicated he would deliver the marijuana after he\n\ngot off work that night around 7:00 p.m. Tillman was to deliver the drugs at a\n\nlocation near Clancy\u2019s home.\n\n       Shortly after the arranged time to drop off the drugs and a lack of\n\nappearance by Tillman, Clancy began texting Tillman, asking about his location.\n\nClancy sent a text message to Tillman, \u201cWhy are you fucking me around\u201d and\n\n\u201cWTF?\u201d Tillman explained that he had to stay late for work. While waiting, Clancy\n\nalso sent a text to his girlfriend, stating, \u201cI\u2019m pissed\u201d and that Tillman was \u201cplaying\n\nhead games.\u201d\n\n       Clancy drove to Tillman\u2019s house and waited for him to arrive home from\n\nwork. Gail Maddox, Tillman\u2019s girlfriend, was outside on the porch with her two\n\f                                        3\n\n\ndogs. She testified1 that Clancy seemed agitated and upset. Upon learning that\n\nTillman was not at home, Clancy threatened to take Tillman\u2019s dogs.         Clancy\n\nadmitted at trial that he planned to take the dogs to motivate Tillman\u2019s return.\n\nMaddox took the dogs inside; alerted Tillman to what was happening; and, like\n\nClancy, waited for Tillman to arrive home. Tillman sent a text to Clancy, informing\n\nhim that he would return the money and that Clancy should not \u201cbother [him] again\n\nfor weed.\u201d Tillman returned home soon after. Once Tillman parked his car, Clancy\n\napproached the driver side window and Tillman handed Clancy his money.\n\n      Following the money exchange, the parties\u2019 versions of events part. Tillman\n\ntestified that Clancy \u201csucker punched\u201d him in the face after snatching away the\n\nmoney while Tillman was still in the car. Clancy claimed Tillman charged him\n\nunprovoked. Both sides agree a scuffle ensued. They also both agree that Tillman\n\ndid not land any punches on Clancy, although Clancy claims Tillman broke his\n\nfinger.2 Maddox yelled at both men to stop fighting and threatened to call the\n\npolice. The men separated.\n\n      Tillman then walked back up to his porch but believed that Clancy was\n\nfollowing him. Tillman grabbed a piece of wood that he used for barbequing and\n\nturned back, walking toward Clancy. The piece of wood was about two feet long\n\nand a few inches in diameter. Clancy fired three shots. One bullet stuck Tillman\n\nin the arm. One bullet struck Tillman in his back, knocking him to the ground. The\n\n\n\n\n1 Maddox passed away a week before trial. Her videotaped deposition was played\nin lieu of in-person testimony.\n2 Clancy did not seek medical treatment for a finger injury until two months after\n\nthe May 2016 incident.\n\f                                          4\n\n\nthird bullet struck Tillman\u2019s house. As Clancy fled, Maddox threw a piece of wood\n\nat his truck while he drove away.\n\n       Police arrived at the scene and located a piece of wood a short distance\n\nfrom the street. No weapons were found in the front yard. Officers searched\n\nTillman\u2019s residence and found several guns. Officers located a shotgun in a closet\n\nin the bedroom, covered by boxes and clothing. None of the weapons in Tillman\u2019s\n\nresidence were loaded. Officers arrested Clancy the next day and discovered a\n\nloaded .40-caliber Glock used in the shooting in the center console of his truck.\n\n       Clancy was represented by a series of attorneys. His first counsel filed a\n\nnotice of affirmative defenses, including intoxication, diminished capacity, and self-\n\ndefense. Clancy\u2019s second set of attorneys withdrew the notice of affirmative\n\ndefenses and filed a new notice\u2014one that only claimed self-defense. Clancy then\n\nobtained his third set of attorneys who did not file a new notice of affirmative\n\ndefenses but relied on the second notice.\n\n       Trial commenced in late May 2018.          Over twenty witnesses testified,\n\nincluding Clancy. Relying on his affirmative-defense notice, Clancy testified that\n\nTillman yelled that he would get his shotgun and kill Clancy. Clancy testified that\n\nin response, he pulled his pistol from his pocket. Clancy testified that after Tillman\n\nobtained a shotgun from his porch or front entrance, rather than a piece of wood,\n\nTillman approached Clancy. According to Clancy, Tillman shouldered his shotgun\n\nand Clancy then fired his gun three times, striking Tillman. Clancy left the scene,\n\ndeclining to report the shooting because he feared being arrested for the marijuana\n\ntransaction.\n\f                                          5\n\n\n         After a five-day jury trial, Clancy was convicted of attempted murder, in\n\nviolation of Iowa Code sections 707.11(1) and 707.11(2) (2016), and willful injury\n\nresulting in serious injury, in violation of section 708.4(1). The jury acquitted\n\nClancy on a third charge of going armed with intent in violation of Iowa Code\n\nsection 708.8. Clancy filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied. Clancy\n\nfiled a direct appeal but dismissed the same.\n\n         Clancy filed the instant PCR application, his first, on April 17, 2019.\n\nFollowing trial, the district court denied Clancy\u2019s entire application.      Clancy\n\nappeals.\n\nII.      Standard & Scope of Review\n\n         \u201cGenerally, an appeal from a denial of an application for [PCR] is reviewed\n\nfor correction of errors at law. However, when the applicant asserts claims of a\n\nconstitutional nature, our review is de novo.\u201d Lamasters v. State, 821 N.W.2d 856,\n\n862 (Iowa 2012) (citations and quotations omitted).\n\n         An applicant alleging ineffective assistance must demonstrate a breach of\n\nduty by counsel and prejudice. See Ledezma v. State, 626 N.W.2d 134, 142 (Iowa\n\n2001). Both prongs must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Id.\n\n\u201cWe may affirm the district court\u2019s rejection of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\n\nclaim if either element is lacking.\u201d Anfinson v. State, 758 N.W.2d 496, 499 (Iowa\n\n2008).\n\n         To demonstrate a breach of duty, the applicant must show their counsel\n\nperformed below the standard of a \u201creasonably competent attorney.\u201d Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). \u201cWe start with the presumption that the\n\nattorney performed competently and proceed to an individualized fact-based\n\f                                          6\n\nanalysis.\u201d Lamasters, 821 N.W.2d at 866. \u201cIneffective assistance is more likely to\n\nbe established when the alleged actions or inactions of counsel are attributed to a\n\nlack of diligence as opposed to the exercise of judgment.\u201d Ledezma, 626 N.W.2d\n\nat 142. \u201cWhile strategic decisions made after \u2018thorough investigation of law and\n\nfacts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable,\u2019 strategic\n\ndecisions made after a \u2018less than complete investigation\u2019 must be based on\n\nreasonable professional judgments which support the particular level of\n\ninvestigation conducted.\u201d Id. at 143 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690-91). \u201cThe\n\nreal issue is not whether defense counsel\u2019s actions were successful, but whether\n\nthey were \u2018justifiable.\u2019\u201d Anfison, 758 N.W.2d at 501 (citation omitted).\n\n       To establish prejudice, the applicant \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\n\nwould have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\n\nundermine the confidence in the outcome.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. When an\n\napplicant alleges multiple instances of ineffective assistance, we must analyze the\n\nclaims \u201cindividually and cumulatively.\u201d State v. Clay, 824 N.W.2d 488, 500 (Iowa\n\n2012) (citing Schrier v. State, 347 N.W.2d 657, 667-68 (Iowa 1984)).\n\nIII.   Discussion\n\n       Clancy raises several claims on appeal. First, he alleges counsel failed to\n\nobject to multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct. In particular, he alleges\n\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to object when the prosecutor asked Clancy\n\nabout the credibility of another witness. Clancy further contends his counsel\n\nshould have objected to the prosecutor\u2019s references to his pre-arrest and post-\n\narrest silence. Clancy also asserts his counsel was ineffective for failing to object\n\f                                           7\n\n\non evidentiary grounds to the prosecutor\u2019s references to his pre-arrest silence.\n\nFinally, he claims counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately investigate and\n\npursue alternative affirmative defenses.\n\n       A.     Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n       Clancy alleges several instances of prosecutorial misconduct and a lack of\n\nobjection by counsel.    \u201cIn analyzing the [applicant\u2019s] ineffective-assistance-of-\n\ncounsel claim, our first step is to assess whether the record demonstrates, as a\n\nmatter of law, the existence or absence of a meritorious due process violation.\u201d\n\nState v. Graves, 668 N.W.2d 860, 869 (Iowa 2003). This requires a showing of\n\nmisconduct and prejudice \u201cto such an extent that the [applicant] was denied a fair\n\ntrial.\u201d Id. \u201c[I]t is the prejudice resulting from the misconduct, not the misconduct\n\nitself, that entitles a[n] [applicant] to a new trial.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). When\n\nexamining the prejudice prong, we consider \u201c(1) the severity and pervasiveness of\n\nthe misconduct; (2) the significance of the misconduct to the central issues in the\n\ncase; (3) the strength of the State\u2019s evidence; (4) the use of cautionary instructions\n\nor other curative measures; and (5) the extent to which the defense invited the\n\nmisconduct.\u201d Id. (citations omitted).\n\n       If the applicant can establish a meritorious claim, we then consider the well-\n\nestablished two-prong test for ineffective assistance of counsel.         Id. at 870.\n\nConsequently, we consider \u201cwhether an attorney performing within the range of\n\nnormal competency would have made an objection and/or requested a mistrial,\u201d\n\nand whether \u201cthe record permits a determination of the prejudice prong\u201d of\n\nineffective assistance. Id.\n\f                                          8\n\n\n              1.      Inducing Clancy to Comment on Witness Credibility\n\n       Clancy claims the prosecutor impermissibly solicited his opinion on whether\n\nother witnesses were lying and his counsel failed to object. \u201cIt is well-settled law\n\nin Iowa that a bright-line rule prohibits the questioning of a witness on whether\n\nanother witness is telling the truth.\u201d Bowman v. State, 710 N.W.2d 200, 204 (Iowa\n\n2006). \u201cThere are no exceptions to this rule.\u201d Id. (citing Graves, 668 N.W.2d at\n\n873). Moreover, the prosecutor need not directly ask if a witness is lying\u2014\u201cit is not\n\nproper . . . [to ask] one witness if another witness is untruthful, mistaken, or to\n\notherwise ask the witness to comment on the credibility of another witness.\u201d\n\nNguyen v. State, 707 N.W.2d 317, 325 (Iowa 2005); see also State v. Carey, 709\n\nN.W.2d 547, 552 (Iowa 2006) (\u201cIn Graves, we held that it is misconduct, under any\n\ncircumstances, for a prosecutor to ask a witness to comment on the veracity of\n\nanother witness.\u201d).\n\n       Clancy highlights the exchanges between himself and the prosecutor:\n\n              Q. So when Ms. Maddox saw you punch him when he was in\n       his car, she\u2019s mistaken? A. Yes.\n              Q. And when Mr. Tillman said that you punched him when he\n       was getting out of his car, he\u2019s mistaken? A. Yes.\n\nAnother series of questioning followed:\n\n              Q. So besides Ms. Maddox being quick enough to hide this\n       shotgun, you\u2019re telling us that you believe Ms. Maddox and Mr.\n       Tillman were clever enough to come up with this idea that he grabbed\n       a piece of wood? A. It surprised me but, yes, I\u2019m\u2014I believe that they\n       made that story up.\n              Q. So there was enough time from when Ms. Draper came out\n       and saw your vehicle speed off and Ms. Maddox coming to Mr.\n       Tillman for them to hide a gun, correct? A. (Nodded head).\n\f                                        9\n\n\n              Q. Is that a yes? A. Yes.\n              Q. For them to come up with a story together, correct?\n              ....\n              Q. And that conveniently there just happened to be a log\n      across the street that matched their story. That\u2019s what you\u2019re saying,\n      this is all a convenience? A. Yes.\n\n      In this exchange, we first note that the prosecutor\u2019s questions were largely\n\ninvited by the defense because after the prosecutor asked what happened to the\n\nshotgun that Tillman allegedly pointed at Clancy, he responded, \u201cI\u2019m guessing they\n\nhid it.\u201d That testimony directly contradicts the testimony of both Maddox and\n\nTillman, inviting a conclusion that they lied. And the alleged misconduct by the\n\nprosecutor was not pervasive nor severe. The trial spanned roughly five days, and\n\nthere are only two instances of questioning in the record before us.\n\n      Furthermore, much of the questioning is not asking Clancy to comment on\n\nwitness credibility, but is instead clarifying Clancy\u2019s version of events\u2014if he\n\nbelieved a gun was involved but not found at the scene, it must have been moved\n\nat some point. Asking what happened to the shotgun is not inherently asking for\n\nClancy to comment on the credibility of other witnesses.       This more closely\n\nresembles the permissible practice of a prosecutor examining \u201ca witness about an\n\nevent by pointing out the factual differences between the witness\u2019s testimony and\n\nthe testimony of other witnesses to the same event.\u201d Nguyen, 707 N.W.2d at 324-\n\n25.\n\n      Finally, this was not an \u201call-out, name-calling attack on [the applicant\u2019s]\n\ncredibility [that] shifted the focus of the trial from the real issue\u2014what really\n\nhappened based on the admissible evidence in [the] case.\u201d Bowman, 710 N.W.2d\n\nat 207.   And while this questioning by the prosecutor perhaps pushed the\n\f                                            10\n\n\nenvelope, given the context of the questioning, we do not find that the prosecutor\u2019s\n\nquestioning rose to the level of a due process violation. Even if we were to find\n\nthe questioning rose to the level of misconduct, we find a lack of prejudice given\n\nthe length of the exchange. We determine that Clancy was not denied a fair trial\n\nbased on this questioning.\n\n       Clancy also asserts misconduct in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. For\n\ninstance, the prosecutor said, \u201c[Clancy] states, though, that his finger . . . got\n\nbroken during this altercation. . . . And that doesn\u2019t\u2014should not pass common\n\nsense or reason, why an individual who was already given the money back [would]\n\ndo anything like that.\u201d The prosecutor also pointed out how Clancy claimed Tillman\n\nyelled that he would get a gun, but no neighbors heard it, although they did hear\n\nMaddox yelling. Finally, Clancy argues that the prosecutor implied Clancy was\n\nlying in his version of events:\n\n               And also out of all this, there happened to be a log across the\n       street that did not belong . . . . Ask yourself, which story is supported\n       by the evidence and which story is more credible . . . ?\n               Ask yourselves, does this pass common sense and reason\n       that Ms. Maddox had this time to go down, pick up a shotgun, run\n       inside the house\u2014which was described as cluttered and difficult to\n       move in by [an officer]\u2014go to the bedroom, bury it in the closet, stack\n       boxes in front of it, throw clothes in front of it that\u2019s seen . . . and then\n       come up with a story that\u2019s identical to Mr. Tillman and then\n       conveniently tell this story to a law enforcement officer at the scene\n       separate from Mr. Tillman . . . .\n\n       We generally give prosecutors \u201csome latitude during closing argument in\n\nanalyzing the evidence admitted in the trial.\u201d Graves, 668 N.W.2d at 874 (quoting\n\nState v. Phillips, 226 N.W.2d 16, 19 (Iowa 1975)). Prosecutors \u201cmay argue the\n\nreasonable inferences and conclusions to be drawn from the evidence.                   A\n\nprosecutor may not, however, express his or her personal beliefs.\u201d Id. (internal\n\f                                           11\n\n\ncitation omitted). \u201cThe key point is that counsel is precluded from using argument\n\nto vouch personally as to a defendant\u2019s guilt or a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d State v.\n\nWilliams, 334 N.W.2d 742, 744 (Iowa 1983); see also Carey, 709 N.W.2d at 556\n\n(\u201c[M]isconduct occurs when the prosecutor seeks [to tarnish the defendant\u2019s\n\ncredibility or boost the State\u2019s case] through unnecessary and overinflammatory\n\nmeans that go outside the record or threaten to improperly incite the passions of\n\nthe jury.\u201d).\n\n        In reviewing this closing argument, we find the prosecutor\u2019s statements\n\nwere \u201clegitimate inferences from the evidence.\u201d Graves, 668 N.W.2d at 875. The\n\nprosecutor\u2019s statements were largely referencing specific pieces of evidence, such\n\nas the state of Tillman\u2019s closet where the shotgun Clancy claims Tillman used was\n\nfound, as well as specific points from other witnesses\u2019 testimony. Our supreme\n\ncourt has found that prosecutors can draw \u201cinference[s] from the divergent\n\ntestimony of\u201d two witnesses. Id. This is not a case in which \u201cthe prosecutor\n\npersonally vouched against the credibility of [Clancy\u2019s] testimony.\u201d          Id.   The\n\nprosecutor did not engage in misconduct during the State\u2019s closing argument by\n\nimplying Clancy lied.\n\n               2.     Doyle Violation\n\n        Clancy next claims that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s reference to his post-arrest silence in closing arguments. The district\n\ncourt found that while the prosecutor did engage in misconduct, Clancy was not\n\nprejudiced because it was \u201ca short, one-time statement in a lengthy trial.\u201d\n\n        The Supreme Court, in Doyle v. Ohio, held that \u201cthe use for impeachment\n\npurposes of [a defendant\u2019s] silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving\n\f                                          12\n\nMiranda warnings, violate[s] the Due Process Clause.\u201d 426 U.S. 610, 619 (1976).\n\nThe Court reasoned that because Miranda required every arrestee to be advised\n\nof their right to remain silent, \u201c[s]ilence in the wake of these warnings may be\n\nnothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these Miranda rights.\u201d Id. at 617.\n\nConsequently, prosecutors cannot comment on a defendant\u2019s post-Miranda\n\nsilence. See id. We note that it is unclear from the record before us if Clancy was\n\nMirandized. See Fletcher v. Weir, 455 U.S. 603, 607 (1982) (finding that it does\n\nnot violate due process to cross-examine a defendant on their post-arrest silence\n\nwhen the defendant was not Mirandized); see also State v. Johnson, No. 07-1298,\n\n2008 WL 2906516, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. July 30, 2008) (\u201cDoyle therefore does not\n\nprotect all silence, but only that \u2018where the government had induced silence by\n\nimplicitly assuring the defendant that his silence would not be used against him.\u2019\u201d\n\n(citation omitted)).   However, because Clancy\u2019s claim fails whether he was\n\nMirandized or not, we address the merits of his claim.\n\n       The prosecutor referenced Clancy\u2019s post-arrest silence in closing argument.\n\nThe two sentences that contain the challenged reference are as follows: \u201cTwo\n\nyears and one day goes by [from the shooting] and never once did he ever call 9-\n\n1-1. After Mr. Tillman testified, Ms. Maddox testified, and all the evidence was\n\npresented, we finally get to hear Mr. Clancy\u2019s side.\u201d Both parties and the PCR\n\ncourt agreed during the PCR trial that this statement was a Doyle violation.3 The\n\ndistrict court found a lack of prejudice. We agree. Even if a successful objection\n\n\n\n3On appeal, the State challenges whether these two sentences actually constitute\na Doyle violation, but as the parties stipulated to the same during trial, we find this\nargument is not preserved for appeal.\n\f                                         13\n\n\nhad been made by counsel, Clancy cannot prove the result of the trial would have\n\nbeen different. In addition to Tillman\u2019s testimony, medical evidence established\n\nthat Tillman was shot in the back. Two additional witnesses testified they did not\n\nhear Tillman threaten Clancy. No weapon was located at the scene. And Clancy\u2019s\n\nown expert testified that Tillman was retreating when he was shot.               The\n\nprosecutor\u2019s comment was an isolated incident\u2014two sentences out of five days of\n\ntrial. Given the evidence against him, it is unlikely the outcome would have been\n\nany different had trial counsel objected to the limited statement concerning\n\nClancy\u2019s silence. See Elken v. State, No. 12-0933, 2013 WL 3864588, at *2 (Iowa\n\nCt. App. July 24, 2013). Thus, Clancy did not suffer prejudice sufficient to change\n\nthe outcome of the trial.\n\n              3.     Pre-arrest Silence\n\n       Clancy contends his attorney was ineffective in failing to object to the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s discussion of his pre-arrest, pre-Miranda silence. In particular, he\n\nargues the prosecutor should not have discussed his failure to call the police\n\nfollowing the shooting.     Our review of the record reveals that the prosecutor\n\ndiscussed Clancy\u2019s failure to call the police two times during trial.       First, the\n\nprosecutor questioned Clancy\u2019s girlfriend if Clancy called the police either the night\n\nof the shooting or the next morning. Additionally, during closing arguments, the\n\nprosecutor discussed how Clancy had \u201cat least 45 minutes from Mr. Tillman\u2019s\n\nhouse to his home to gather his thoughts and to call 9-1-1,\u201d as well as additional\n\ntime the next morning.\n\n       The district court found the State\u2019s questions and comments about Clancy\u2019s\n\nfailure to contact police pre-arrest were not a due process violation. We agree.\n\f                                         14\n\n\nFirst, the Supreme Court is clear that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment is not violated by the\n\nuse of prearrest silence to impeach a criminal defendant\u2019s credibility.\u201d Jenkins v.\n\nAnderson, 447 U.S. 231, 238 (1980). Clancy took the stand and testified in his\n\nown defense.     Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s comments in closing argument were a\n\nlegitimate way to challenge Clancy\u2019s credibility. We do not find a due process\n\nviolation.\n\n       We next turn to the questioning of Clancy\u2019s girlfriend concerning his pre-\n\narrest silence. Prosecutors can impeach a defendant with their pre-arrest silence.\n\nThe \u201cimpeachment follows the defendant\u2019s own decision to cast aside his cloak of\n\nsilence\u201d and testify. Id. Here, the prosecutor asked Miller about Clancy\u2019s failure\n\nto call the police prior to Clancy\u2019s testimony. While the questions were not posed\n\ndirectly to Clancy, our case law is clear that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment can be violated\n\neven when the government does not directly coerce testimony from the defendant.\u201d\n\nState v. Gibbs, 941 N.W.2d 888, 894 (Iowa 2020).             The Fifth Amendment\n\n\u201cgenerally protects the right of a person to remain silent unless he chooses to\n\nspeak in the unfettered exercise of his own will.\u201d       Id. (quotation and citation\n\nomitted).\n\n       Even if the prosecutor\u2019s questions to Miller were misconduct, they did not\n\nresult in prejudice to Clancy. First, the exchange was limited to two questions\u2014\n\nwhether Clancy called the police the night of the shooting or the following morning.\n\nAs such, the misconduct was not pervasive nor severe.            Moreover, Clancy\u2019s\n\ncounsel testified at the PCR hearing that they were planning to call Clancy to testify\n\nall along and planned to discuss his pre-arrest silence.          Consequently, the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s questions did not compel Clancy to testify. Clancy\u2019s counsel was not\n\f                                          15\n\n\nineffective for failing to object. We also note that even assuming counsel could\n\nhave successfully objected, their decision not to object was a reasonable strategic\n\nchoice. See Fryer v. State, 325 N.W.2d 400, 414 (Iowa 1982). Counsel testified\n\nthat they planned to discuss Clancy\u2019s pre-arrest silence even prior to trial, and\n\nthought they had sufficiently explained the issue to the jury so that an objection\n\nwas unnecessary. We find no due process violation. And we further conclude a\n\nlack of prejudice that precluded a fair trial if the claim was analyzed under\n\nStrickland.\n\n       B.     Evidentiary Issues\n\n       Clancy also reframes his argument regarding pre-arrest silence on\n\nalternative grounds.     He alleges his counsel should have objected to the\n\nintroduction of evidence related to his pre-arrest silence on evidentiary grounds.\n\nIn particular, he contends the testimony related to his decision not to contact the\n\npolice violated Iowa Rules of Evidence 5.403 and 5.404.\n\n       As a preliminary matter, we note that Clancy failed to preserve his claim as\n\nit relates to rule 5.404. \u201cIt is a fundamental doctrine of appellate review that issues\n\nmust ordinarily be both raised and decided by the district court before we will\n\ndecide them on appeal.\u201d Meier v. Senecaut, 641 N.W.2d 532, 537 (Iowa 2002).\n\nClancy did not raise the claim in his PCR application and the district court did not\n\nrule on it. As such, our review is limited to his claims concerning rule 5.403.\n\n       Clancy contends rule 5.403 required his counsel to object to the\n\nadmissibility of his pre-arrest silence. Under rule 5.403, \u201c[e]ven relevant evidence\n\ncan be inadmissible if the evidence\u2019s probative value is \u2018substantially outweighed\n\nby the danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the\n\f                                          16\n\n\nissues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly cumulative\n\nevidence.\u2019\u201d State v. Buelow, 951 N.W.2d 879, 889 (Iowa 2020) (quoting Iowa R.\n\nEvid. 5.403). We analyze an objection under rule 5.403 under a two-part test. Id.\n\n\u201cFirst, we consider the probative value of the evidence. Second, we balance the\n\nprobative value against the danger of its prejudicial or wrongful effect upon the\n\ntriers of fact.\u201d Id. (quoting State v. Webster, 865 N.W.2d 223, 242 (Iowa 2015)).\n\n\u201c[A]ll powerful evidence is prejudicial to one side. The key is whether the danger\n\nof unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the evidence\u2019s probative value.\u201d Id.\n\n(quoting State v. Neiderbach, 837 N.W.2d 180, 202 (Iowa 2013)).\n\n       Our courts have long held that pre-arrest silence can be probative evidence\n\nwhen the defendant claims they acted in self-defense. See State v. Shanahan,\n\n712 N.W.2d 121, 138 (Iowa 2006) (finding such evidence was \u201cstrong, essential\n\nevidence\u201d to refute the defendant\u2019s version of events); see also Jenkins, 447 U.S.\n\nat 239 (\u201cCommon law traditionally has allowed witnesses to be impeached by their\n\nprevious failure to state a fact in circumstances in which that fact naturally would\n\nhave been asserted.\u201d). Clancy\u2019s failure to report his use of deadly force to the\n\npolice speaks to his intent and how he perceived the situation. See Shanahan,\n\n712 N.W.2d at 138 (\u201cWhen a person is required to use deadly force to protect\n\nhimself or herself, normally the first course of action is for that person to notify the\n\nauthorities and report the incident.\u201d).\n\n       Clancy alleges the evidence is prejudicial because it makes him seem to\n\nhave a \u201ccriminal character\u201d and implies he is \u201cinherently violent or untrustworthy.\u201d\n\nHowever, the evidence was not of the sort that our court has traditionally\n\nconsidered unfairly prejudicial. See Webster, 865 N.W.2d at 244 (concluding\n\f                                         17\n\n\nevidence the defendant had previously struck a pregnant woman was unfairly\n\nprejudicial because it would needlessly emphasize the defendant\u2019s violent history\n\nto a victim the jury would foreseeably be sensitive to); State v. Huston, 825 N.W.2d\n\n531, 539 (Iowa 2013) (\u201cTelling the jury the [Department of Human Services (DHS)]\n\ndetermined the child abuse complaint against [the defendant] was founded was\n\nunfairly prejudicial due to the risk the jury would substitute the DHS determination\n\nfor its own finding of guilt or would give the determination undue weight.\u201d); State v.\n\nHenderson, 696 N.W.2d 5, 11-12 (Iowa 2005) (finding evidence of prior drug\n\nconviction was unfairly prejudicial in case for \u201cessentially the same crime[]\u201d). The\n\nevidence did not confuse or mislead the jury by creating an issue apart from\n\nClancy\u2019s guilt or innocence. See State v. Buman, 955 N.W.2d 215, 221 (Iowa\n\n2021) (finding language in an exhibit defining professional standards for nurses\n\nconfused the jury on the applicable legal standard at trial).\n\n       Clancy argues we should analogize this case to State v. Wilson, 878\n\nN.W.2d 203, 211-14 (Iowa 2016), which examined the admissibility of evidence\n\nthat the defendant fled a crime scene. In that case, the court found four inferences\n\nwere necessary to impute guilt: \u201c(1) from the defendant's behavior to avoidance of\n\napprehension, (2) from avoidance of apprehension to consciousness of guilt, (3)\n\nfrom consciousness of guilt to consciousness of guilt concerning the crime\n\ncharged, and (4) from consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged to\n\nactual guilt of the crime charged.\u201d Id. at 212-13. Clancy argues the inferential\n\nchain breaks down at the third inference because he felt unable to call the police\n\ndue to the drug transaction that started the confrontation. Even if true, rule 5.403\n\nrequires the probative value be substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice to\n\f                                         18\n\n\nthe defendant. We determine there was not a breach of an essential duty by trial\n\ncounsel, as the evidence was admissible and the probative value was not\n\nsubstantially outweighed by any unfair prejudice to Clancy.\n\n       C.     Alternative Defenses\n\n       Clancy argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and\n\npursue the affirmative defenses of diminished capacity and intoxication. Counsel\n\ngenerally has a duty to investigate the case. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690.\n\n\u201c[C]laims of ineffective assistance involving tactical or strategic decisions of\n\ncounsel must be examined in light of all the circumstances to ascertain whether\n\nthe actions were a product of tactics or inattention . . . .\u201d Anfinson, 758 N.W.2d at\n\n501 (quoting Ledezma, 626 N.W.2d at 143). \u201cWhile strategic decisions made after\n\n\u2018thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually\n\nunchallengeable,\u2019 strategic decisions made after a \u2018less than complete\n\ninvestigation\u2019 must be based on reasonable professional judgments which support\n\nthe particular level of investigation conducted.\u201d Ledezma, 626 N.W.2d at 143\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n       Clancy contends his counsel should have more thoroughly investigated and\n\npursued the diminished-capacity and intoxication defenses based on his lengthy\n\nhistory of mental illness and the potential effects of his medication. Counsel\n\nadmitted to not reviewing the mental-health records for the time period that would\n\nhave occurred after the May 2016 shooting. Counsel testified that even if they had\n\nreviewed the records, it probably would not have changed their determination to\n\npursue only a self-defense argument.\n\f                                         19\n\n       Clancy claims this case is analogous to Anfinson. In that case, our supreme\n\ncourt found that counsel\u2019s utter refusal to investigate evidence that his client was\n\nsuffering from post-partum depression constituted ineffective assistance.\n\nAnfinson, 758 N.W.2d at 499. Such an analogy on these facts is misplaced. In\n\nAnfinson, trial counsel categorically refused to consider any evidence that his client\n\nsuffered from post-partum depression, including failing to obtain medical records\n\nindicating his client suffered from depression in the past, publicly stating\n\ndepression did not play a role, and denying family members\u2019 requests to look into\n\nthe issue. Id. at 499-501.\n\n       Here, counsel did not categorically refuse to consider alternative defenses\n\ndespite evidence suggesting the defenses could be legitimate.            Rather, trial\n\ncounsel testified that Clancy gave no indications of mental illness or intoxication\n\nthroughout their interactions with him.       Clancy consistently offered the same\n\nversion of events with a solid grasp of details. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691\n\n(\u201cCounsel\u2019s actions are usually based, quite properly, on informed strategic\n\nchoices made by the defendant and on information supplied by the defendant. In\n\nparticular, what investigation decisions are reasonable depends critically on such\n\ninformation.\u201d).   Furthermore, Anfinson\u2019s counsel refused to examine medical\n\nrecords; Clancy\u2019s counsel examined years of medical records and was aware\n\nClancy had diagnoses of bipolar and manic-depressive disorders from their review\n\nof those records. We also note that Clancy was adamant to counsel that his mental\n\nillnesses did not play a role. See id. (\u201cThe reasonableness of counsel\u2019s actions\n\nmay be determined or substantially influenced by the defendant\u2019s own statements\n\nor actions. . . . And when a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that\n\f                                         20\n\n\npursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful, counsel\u2019s failure\n\nto pursue those investigations may not be later challenged as unreasonable.\u201d).\n\n       Additionally, choosing one defense over another was a reasonable strategic\n\ndecision.   Counsel testified that they believed presenting the defenses of\n\ndiminished capacity and intoxication would undercut their self-defense argument\n\nbecause the only person testifying to Clancy\u2019s version of events was himself.\n\nSimultaneously claiming that Clancy accurately perceived Tillman raising a firearm\n\nwhile also claiming that he was intoxicated and could not form a specific intent or\n\naccurately perceive his surroundings would undercut both claims.            Further,\n\nClancy\u2019s defense attempted to bolster Clancy\u2019s credibility regarding his self-\n\ndefense claim by discussing his lengthy employment history and knowledge of\n\nguns. Such would be undercut by a diminished-capacity affirmative defense.\n\nFocusing on self-defense was not a breach of duty. See State v. Wilkens, 346\n\nN.W.2d 16, 18-19 (Iowa 1984) (finding counsel was not ineffective for focusing on\n\nself-defense rather than diminished capacity because the defense \u201cwould be\n\nheavily dependent upon the jury accepting [the] defendant\u2019s own testimony\u201d).\n\n       D.     Cumulative Effect\n\n       Clancy contends the cumulative effect of the above-discussed claims\n\nresulted in constitutional prejudice. See Clay, 824 N.W.2d at 501(\u201cIowa recognizes\n\nthe cumulative effect of ineffective assistance of counsel claims when analyzing\n\nprejudice under Strickland.\u201d). Where, as here, an applicant asserts multiple claims\n\nof ineffective assistance of counsel, \u201cthe cumulative prejudice from those individual\n\nclaims should be properly assessed under the prejudice prong of Strickland. Id.\n\nThe court should look at the cumulative effect of the prejudice arising from all the\n\f                                         21\n\nclaims.\u201d Id. Where the applicant raised multiple claims of ineffective assistance\n\nand the court found the attorney did not fail to perform an essential duty, that claim\n\nis dismissed. See id. If the court only considered the prejudice prong, \u201cthe court\n\ncan only dismiss the postconviction claim if the alleged errors, cumulatively, do not\n\namount to Strickland prejudice.\u201d Id. at 501\u201302.\n\n       Our supreme court analyzed the cumulative effect of the prejudice prong in\n\nSchrier, 347 N.W.2d at 668. Our supreme court summarized Schrier as follows:\n\n              In Schrier, a jury convicted Schrier of first-degree sexual\n       assault and first-degree murder in the abuse and death of his two-\n       year-old son. Schrier appealed the denial of his [PCR] application in\n       which he raised twelve claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n       We analyzed six of those claims under the essential duty prong. We\n       assessed the remaining claims under the prejudice prong. We\n       considered some claims, however, for both breach of an essential\n       duty and prejudice. Nonetheless, we analyzed all claims \u201cindividually\n       and cumulatively,\u201d concluding defense counsel was effective, and\n       Schrier received a fair trial.\n\nClay, 824 N.W.2d at 500 (internal citations omitted).\n\n       We have individually analyzed and disposed of one of Clancy\u2019s claims\n\nunder the prejudice prong\u2013counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s two\n\nsentences in his closing arguments concerning Clancy\u2019s post-arrest silence. We\n\nanalyzed a second claim under both the breach and prejudice prong\u2013counsel\u2019s\n\nfailure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Clancy\u2019s girlfriend\n\nconcerning Clancy\u2019s pre-arrest silence. Analyzing the two claims together, we\n\ndetermine the cumulative effect did not deny Clancy a fair trial.\n\nIV.    Conclusion\n\n       We have considered all issues and claims presented on appeal and find no\n\nbasis for reversing the judgment of the PCR court that denied relief to Clancy. In\n\f                                         22\n\n\nmaking this determination, we have reviewed the effect of the various claims both\n\nindividually and cumulatively and find that Clancy has not established that he was\n\ndenied a fair trial. We affirm the dismissal of Clancy\u2019s application.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\f",
