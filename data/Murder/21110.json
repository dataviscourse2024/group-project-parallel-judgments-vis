The conscientious\n\nmajority follows the precedent set out by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in\n\nMontoya v. State.1 The Montoya opinion states that section 7.02 in toto covers\n\nonly the law of parties, not criminal responsibility for the acts of others as stated\n\nin its caption.2 The result is a peculiar rule that provides that a person acts as a\n\n      1\n       810 S.W.2d 160 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 961\n(1991).\n      2\n       See id. at 165.\n\fparty whether he acts as a party or as a co-conspirator.3 That is, he is a party\n\nwhether he is guilty of the offense alleged in the indictment (or a lesser included\n\noffense) or guilty of an offense alleged nowhere. The jury, then, is instructed to\n\nconvict the defendant of the offense charged in the indictment whether they find\n\nhim guilty of that offense or a totally different offense that is not a lesser included\n\noffense of that alleged.\n\n      The fact that conspiracy to commit murder is a different offense from\n\nmurder is the distinction that allowed the Tarrant County District Attorney to\n\nsecure the convictions of Christopher William Brosky for both the murder of\n\nDonald Thomas as a party and conspiracy to murder Donald Thomas. 4 After\n\nBrosky\u2019s murder conviction, for which he received a ten-year probated sentence,\n\nthe public outrage caused the district attorney\u2019s office to seek a second bite of\n\nthe apple.    The district attorney sought and obtained an indictment against\n\nBrosky for conspiracy to commit the murder of Donald Thomas. Brosky filed a\n\npre-trial application for writ of habeas corpus on the basis of double jeopardy.\n\nThe trial court denied relief, and he appealed to this court. This court stated,\n\n            Brosky asserts his prosecution for conspiracy is barred by the\n      double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. We find the double\n      jeopardy clause does not bar the prosecution for conspiracy in this\n      case.\n\n\n      3\n       See id.; see also Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 7.02 (West 2011).\n      4\n         Brosky v. State, 915 S.W.2d 120, 139\u201340 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth, pet.\nref\u2019d), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1020 (1996).\n\n\n                                          2\n\f            ....\n\n             We find conspiracy is not a lesser included offense of the law\n      of parties. An offense is a lesser included offense if:\n\n             (1) it is established by proof of the same or less than all the\n      facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged;\n\n             (2) it differs from the offense charged only in the respect that a\n      less serious injury or risk of injury to the same person, property, or\n      public interest suffices to establish its commission;\n\n            (3) it differs from the offense charged only in the respect that a\n      less culpable mental state suffices to establish its commission; or\n\n            (4) it consists of an attempt to commit the offense charged or\n      an otherwise included offense.\n\n             Both criminal conspiracy and engaging in organized criminal\n      activity require proof of a fact\u2014an agreement to commit an\n      offense\u2014that murder as a party does not.5\n\n      \u201cBrosky argue[d] that the offense of murder as a party under [p]enal [c]ode\n\nsection 7.02(a)(2) requires proof of \u2018acts of the parties,\u2019 from which an agreement\n\nto commit the offense can be inferred.\u201d6 We explained that\n\n      [i]rrespective of whether the jury may have inferred the existence of\n      an agreement from Brosky\u2019s and his co-defendants\u2019 overt acts, this\n      argument is beside the point.          The court\u2019s charge at the\n      guilt/innocence phase of the murder trial did not instruct the jurors\n      they could infer an agreement existed from the overt acts. Rather,\n      the jury was merely instructed that it could find Brosky guilty of\n      murder if it found that he \u201cacted with intent to promote or assist the\n      commission of the offense by encouraging, directing, aiding or\n      attempting to aid\u201d his co-defendants in the murder of Donald\n      Thomas.\n      5\n        Ex parte Brosky, 863 S.W.2d 783, 784 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 1993, no\npet.) (citations and footnote omitted).\n      6\n       Id. at 785.\n\n\n                                         3\n\f              The only portion of the law of parties that refers specifically to\n       a conspiracy is [section] 7.02(b), which the trial court excluded from\n       the charge at the defense\u2019s request. Brosky does not contend, and\n       the record does not show, that the State argued to the jury that\n       Brosky acted as part of a conspiracy. In short, the record is devoid\n       of evidence that the State proved the fact of an agreement to commit\n       murder in the murder trial.7\n\n       This court stated unequivocally that \u201cconspiracy does not differ from\n\nmurder as a party in any of the ways set out in article 37.09. Thus, conspiracy is\n\nnot a lesser included offense of murder as a party under that article.\u201d8 Then, we\n\nspelled it out:\n\n       The offense of murder as a party requires proof that the defendant,\n       acting as a party, caused the death of an individual.      Criminal\n       conspiracy and engaging in organized criminal activity do not.\n       Similarly, conspiracy and engaging in organized criminal activity\n       require proof that the defendant entered into an agreement, or\n       conspired, with others, which murder as a party does not.9\n\n       After his jury trial for conspiracy to commit murder, Brosky appealed his\n\nconviction. We summarily dismissed his double-jeopardy claim, stating,\n\n             This court has already evaluated and rejected each claim that\n       Brosky now asserts on the issue of double jeopardy. We have\n       already determined that engaging in organized crime and conspiracy\n       is not a species of the lesser included offense of murder by\n       complicity. We applied the Blockburger test and concluded that\n       \u201cboth criminal conspiracy and engaging in organized criminal activity\n       require proof of a fact\u2014an agreement to commit an offense\u2014that\n       murder as a party did not.\u201d Next, in the murder prosecution, the jury\n       was not instructed on the conspiratorial theory of parties, nor did the\n\n       7\n       Id. at 785 (citation omitted).\n       8\n       Id.\n       9\n       Id. at 788.\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      prosecutor argue that Brosky acted as part of a conspiracy. This\n      court also rejected Brosky\u2019s arguments based on Pereira v. United\n      States and United States v. Dixon and held that the controlling\n      precedent was United States v. Felix, where the United States\n      Supreme Court recognized that a prosecution for conspiracy is not\n      precluded by a prior prosecution for the substantive offense. Brosky\n      has presented nothing new to this court requiring us to deviate from\n      our holding in Ex parte Brosky.10\n\n      The holding of the Montoya court now causes trial and appellate courts,\n\nincluding this court, to take a curious step. Under the guise of the law of parties,\n\nwe increase the burden of the State in a parties\u2019 prosecution beyond the burden\n\nestablished by the legislature.   The legislature has never suggested that the\n\nState must prove an agreement among parties to an offense to convict a party of\n\nthat offense. Often, the obvious lack of planning among parties is astounding.\n\nBut, acting with intent to promote or assist the commission of the offense, they\n\nsolicit, encourage, direct, aid, or attempt to aid the other person to commit the\n\noffense, and they manage to do so with startling frequency, sometimes amazing\n\ningenuity, a total lack of appreciation of consequences, and usually a total\n\nabsence of any evidence of planning.11 They are guilty as parties to the offense\n\nbecause they did more than think about or plan the offense. They did an act.\n\nConspirators, on the other hand, are guilty of thinking or planning, even though\n\nthey commit no act. That is why the penalty for conspiracy is a degree lower\n\nthan the offense that is the subject of the conspiracy. But when a person is\n\n      10\n        See Brosky, 915 S.W.2d at 140 (citations omitted).\n      11\n        See Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 7.02.\n\n\n                                         5\n\fconvicted of conspiracy under the cloak of the law of parties, that person may be\n\nconvicted of the offense of planning or even just talking about committing the\n\noffense although he committed no act in furtherance of the conspiracy, and the\n\nState must prove the extra element of the agreement. And, suddenly, the State\n\nhas an extra element added to its burden of proof.\n\n      The plain reading of section 7.02, \u201cCriminal Responsibility for Conduct of\n\nAnother\u201d means just that. There are only two ways a person can be criminally\n\nresponsible for the acts of another. A person is criminally responsible for the\n\nacts of another if he is guilty as a party (7.02(a)) or if he is a co-conspirator\n\n(7.02(b)). We presume the legislature means what it says.12\n\n      In the case now before this court, the learned trial judge recognized the\n\ndistinction between guilt as a party and guilt as a co-conspirator under penal\n\ncode section 15.02, Criminal Conspiracy, a different offense from the offense\n\ncharged and carrying a penalty one degree lower than the target offense. 13\n\nAlthough the charge instructed the jury to add to the State\u2019s burden of proof\n\nbeyond that required by the legislature, the jury charge carefully included the\n\nrequirement that the jury find Appellant committed an act:\n\n      then and there at the time of the shooting was acting with and aiding\n      or attempting to aid Dominique Jones in the execution of the robbery\n      or burglary of Daniel Garner, if any, and that the shooting of Daniel\n\n      12\n       See Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann \u00a7 311.021 (West 2013); Clinton v. State, 354\nS.W.3d 795, 801\u201302 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).\n      13\n       See Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 15.02(d) (West 2011).\n\n\n                                        6\n\f      Garner was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy, if any, of\n      Damian Murkledove and Dominique Jones to rob Daniel Garner or to\n      burglarize the home of Daniel Garner and that the shooting of Daniel\n      Garner, if any, was an offense that should have been anticipated as\n      a result of the carrying out of the conspiracy, then you will find the\n      defendant, Damian Murkledove, guilty of Capital Murder as charged\n      in the indictment.\n\n      I understand that this is an attempt to explain and apply the law of\n\ntransferred intent. But it is the unhappy attempt to improperly merge the law of\n\nparties with the law of conspiracy as required by Montoya. For the reasons\n\nstated above, I would admit that the Montoya court was incorrect in holding that\n\nsection 7.02 is exclusively the law of parties, hold that following Montoya is error,\n\nand do away with this impossible burden we have placed on the trial court to craft\n\na jury charge that reconciles the irreconcilable. The State has no burden to\n\nprove any prior planning, any malice aforethought, any agreement, or\n\npremeditation to convict a defendant as a party. We have no authority to add\n\nthat which the legislature did not include in the State\u2019s burden of proof.\n\n      For all these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.\n\n\n\n                                              /s/ Lee Ann Dauphinot\n                                              LEE ANN DAUPHINOT\n                                              JUSTICE\n\n\nPUBLISH\n\nDELIVERED: May 15, 2014\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f",
