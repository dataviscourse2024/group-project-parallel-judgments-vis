In March 2007, a jury\n\nconvicted appellant of murder and assessed punishment, enhanced by two prior\n\nfelony convictions, at life imprisonment. This Court affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction\n\nand sentence on direct appeal.\n\n       In May 2019, appellant filed a motion for postconviction DNA testing under\n\nChapter 64. The trial court denied the motion and this appeal followed.\n\f      Appellant\u2019s counsel has filed a motion to withdraw. The motion is supported\n\nby a brief in which counsel professionally and conscientiously examines the record\n\nand applicable law and concludes that this appeal is frivolous and without merit. The\n\nState filed a letter brief agreeing with counsel\u2019s assessment.\n\n      Counsel has provided appellant with a copy of the brief and the motion to\n\nwithdraw. The brief meets the requirements of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738\n\n(1967). Specifically, the brief presents a professional evaluation of the record\n\nshowing why, in effect, there are no arguable grounds to advance. See High v. State,\n\n573 S.W.2d 807, 812 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1978) (determining whether brief\n\nmeets requirements of Anders).\n\n       We advised appellant of his right to file a pro se response. See Kelly v. State,\n\n436 S.W.3d 313, 319\u201321 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014) (noting appellant has right to file\n\npro se response to Anders brief filed by counsel). Appellant responded but presents\n\nno arguable grounds to advance.\n\n      We have also reviewed the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and the State\u2019s letter brief.\n\nSee Bledsoe v. State, 178 S.W.3d 824, 826\u201327 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005) (explaining\n\nappellate court\u2019s duty in Anders cases). We agree the appeal is frivolous and without\n\nmerit and find nothing in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                         \u20132\u2013\n\f         We therefore grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm the trial court\u2019s\n\norder.\n\n\n\n                                            /Dennise Garcia/\n                                            DENNISE GARCIA\n                                            JUSTICE\n\n\n\n\nDo Not Publish\nTEX.
