Your          Honor,    based on the request of our client,. Mr.\n\nReamirez, \u00b7\u00b7we have filed a motion to withdraw (Page 8; Lines 1 - 25) in each of\n\nthe cases that we have been appointed to;.represent him on.\n\n            He     has     accused        us of not investigating, not researching the law. He has\n\naccused us of -- of going                            doing things without his premission.\n\n           And we believe that those allegations have put us in an untenable position\n\nthat         we     can't       represent him.             We     spoke with him today to make sure there is\n\nnno chance to repair that relationship, and                                  he    has   informed    us that he does\n\nnot want us to be his lawyers, that he believes we have done thing that . violate\n\nour         code     of     ethics.        and\n                                                      .\n                                                     we     are requesting to be         aluowed to withdraw from\n\nrepresenting him.\n\n            THE     COURT: :       All     right.          Mr.    Ramirez, what is ti you're complaining of?\n\nI've         not     read       the      letters          that    you've    s~nt   because they have been sealed.\n\nI      thinnk . you've             gotten        a    response back from my court (Page 9; Lines 1 - 7)\n\nadministrator               about        that.        Whatever       the     letters are, when you-- you can't\n\ncommunicate               directly with me when you have a lawyer.                       So, they've been sealed.\n\nThey         are     in     the\u00b7Court's .file, whatever they are, but they are sealed. If you\n\nneed         me     to     open       them in the presence of everybody, I. can do that, but right\n\nnow,         I     want     you \u00b7to        tell me what is you concern, what do you want done, and\n    . /.\n\n\n                                                                 Page TWo\n\fwhy.\n\n        THE     DEFENDAT:                I wanted to take the stand,, THE COURT: Go ahead. but they\n\nwouldn't        subpoena             my     witnesses.        Tey say my witnesses don't matter, that it\n\nwas     irrelevant.                All     they    wated     to     subpoena is character witnesses after I\n\nlose.        they     told          me I was going to lose anyway. At that time I was here, sir.\n\nI     came     ready           to go to jury, they said, Your're going to get life .. I assumed\n\nI was going to                     (Inaudible).           something wrong here                (Page      10,   Lines    1\n\n10)     I     took        too       much medication. It's my medication. If I wouldn't have been\n\nso     medicated,              I    would have never signed that -- whatever I signed, you know.\n\n        I mean why wouldn't they subpoena my witnesses?                                       All      they    wanted       to\n\nsubpoena        was characte.)::: witness for after I lose. They never talk about I might\n\nwin.        They are mad at me becuase I wouldn't plea bargain or plead. It's just ..\u2022\n\n        . . . . . . . . . . . THE        COURT~    what     else?     Tell    me     everything you're concerned\n\nabout.

THE DEFENDANT: She said something that wasn't right.\n\n        (Page 11; Line 13 -25) The                       COURT:     Now,     what        is     your     response to what\n\nhe    says,      his           complants?         give     me your response.             MS. HENNNINGTON: Judge, we\n\nknow that he has had medicaition, but he is telling us things that -- or saying\n\n      what      he        is       saying is he was on some medication and we forced him to sign\n\nit because he never would have signed it if he                                would           have     been not under the\n\ninfluence.           He        has accused us of lying to him. I mean, and it 's in his letter.\n\nHe    has     told         us       that. He's told it to our face. He said it                           in the letter.\n\nI     understand           he's        nervous      now,     so I'm not sure what I didn't say correct\n\nearlier,        but        he      has     done all of those things.                As    far as what we've done,\n\nwe have (Page 12; Line 1) \u00b7 researched.\n\n        (Page        12;        Line      17 - 25)       THE COURT\" The I'll open the letter and read\n\nit     at    this         time.        There is a letter in the              Court's file. It's file-marked\n\njanuary       5th or            2011, where it was written in -- a letter was written to Mr.\n\n                                                          Page Three\n\fRamirez        by     Ms.        Aaron        who     is my court. coordinator, who is present in the\n\ncourtroom,           with        copies        to     Ms.     Hennington, to the                 D. A. 's off ice, and the\n\nclerk.        That is, copies of the letter that she wrote.                                      The document bhat .-was\n\nwatten        by     the     (Page        131        Line     1) Defendant has               been under seal since it\n\nwas received.\n\n        (Page 15; Line 11 - 14)                       And     Mr.       Ramirez        was    involved     all along the\n\nway,     when        in     jail, when not in jail, in these preparation attempts, in the\n\nwork that we have been doing.\n\n        (Page 16; Line :6                     2l)I     believe           that     he    believes      in his heart that\n\nMs.     Hennington           and     I        are no doing a good job for him,                       will not to a good\n\njob            for        him,     and        do     not have his best interests at heart. I                      believe\n\nhe is sincere when he tells                          the     Court        that     he believes all we want him to\n\ndo is to plead guilty.                    I        believe        while     it     is not so that         we've promised\n\nhim     he     would get life if he was convicted, I believe he hears that and he's\n\ninmovable in his belief that that is what we're advising him.\n\n        THE        COURT:        You' 're          telling        me     you did not tell him that.

At this juncture, vien\n\nthe     circumstances                 and     the     totalityof the -- what has been presented, what\n\nI     think     is        the        credible evidence before me on this issue, I do not believe\n\nthat     these        attorneys             have      been     derelict        in their duties. I know each of\n\nthese        attoneys,           and        they     try cases in this court on a regular basis. They\n\nare     good     advocates and they are responsible attonreys and I don't find that\n\nthey     have        done        anything that merits them being two out of the case as your\n\nlawyers.         And           the     motions        to     withdraw        are denied in each case.       We will\n\ngo to the        next           issue, which is this jyry waiver .

You're not going\n\nto be doing your thing and theni doing their thi;ng at the same time.\n\n        In other           words           you've     said     you     were        indigent,   I appointed lawyers,\n\nrotating        syste,           thre        next one up, qualified attorneys licensed to practive\n\nin     this     state. And:in most. cases, you. only have one :lawer. You have two. I'm\n\nnot     paying        for        two. They are doing it                    because of theirchrcrumstances. So,\n\nyou're really              getting two lawyers for the price of one lawyer in this matter.\n\nThis is not a capital murder case. You know, that's when we have two lawyers.\n                                                             Page Six\n\f(Psge 23; Line 23 - 25)                          I'm not              going        to     pay for two lawyers for you, but\n\nyou're        got them here because of their willingness to do this and split their\n\ntogether, but i f you don't (Page 24; Line 1 - 25)                                                 want them here, then there\n\nis going to be some serious situations.\n\n        but        just        know this,              if     we go forward with it, this case --you know,\n\nif     you     were going to represent yourself, you're not going to have the benefit\n\nof :these              lawyers           questioning              witnesses.
