HOSIE PERRY, JR.\n\n                  Direct Appeal from the Criminal Court for Shelby County\n                           No. 05-08431    W. Fred Axley, Judge\n\n\n\n                     No. W2007-00822-CCA-R3-CD - Filed July 15, 2008\n\n\nThe defendant, Hosie Perry, Jr. was convicted by jury of two counts of first degree premeditated\nmurder for which he received consecutive sentences of life imprisonment. On appeal, he contends\nthat: (1) the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions because there was no proof\nconnecting him to the crimes other than uncorroborated accomplice testimony; (2) the trial court\nerred in admitting autopsy photographs of the victims; and (3) the trial court erred in sentencing him\nto two consecutive life sentences. Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the\njudgments of the trial court.\n\n     Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgments of the Criminal Court Affirmed\n\nJ.C. MCLIN , J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which JOHN EVERETT WILLIAMS and NORMA\nMCGEE OGLE, JJ., joined.\n\nBrett B. Stein and Robert Chamoun, Memphis, Tennessee, for the appellant, Hosie Perry, Jr.\n\nRobert E. Cooper, Jr., Attorney General and Reporter; Renee W. Turner, Assistant Attorney General;\nWilliam L. Gibbons, District Attorney General; and Ray Lapone and Paul Hagerman, Assistant\nDistrict Attorneys General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                             OPINION\n\n        The evidence presented at trial established that the victims, David McVay and Jessica Sisson,\nwere shot and killed. Sharon Coleman, McVay\u2019s mother, testified that McVay was twenty-one years\nold when he was killed. According to Coleman, she heard that her son had been shot and went to\nthe scene on Longmont Drive. When she arrived, McVay and Sisson had already been transported\nto the hospital. Later, she learned that her son had died. At trial, photographs of McVay alive and\ndeceased were submitted to Coleman for identification and then introduced into evidence.\n\n        Mary Barnes, Jessica Sisson\u2019s aunt, testified that Sisson had lived with her since she was two\nor three years old. Barnes recalled that McVay and Sisson had a close friendship, like brother and\n\fsister. Barnes was informed at the hospital that Sisson had died. Sisson was seventeen years old\nwhen she was killed. During the trial, photographs of Sisson alive and deceased were submitted to\nBarnes for identification and then introduced into evidence.\n\n        Louise Scott, McVay\u2019s aunt, testified that McVay came over to her house on Longmont Drive\non July 13, 2005, to visit and eat. Around midnight, McVay left the house in order to walk Sisson\nhome. Shortly thereafter, Scott heard gunshots. At the time, Scott thought she heard fireworks.\nHowever, Scott looked outside and saw people running. A few minutes later, someone came to her\ndoor and told her that McVay had been shot. Upon hearing the news, Scott ran down the street\nwhere she saw McVay and Sisson lying on the ground. According to Scott, McVay was still alive\nwhen she arrived. She held him and tried to get a response from him. However, he was gasping for\nair and could not talk or respond.\n\n        Officer Jerry Quinn of the Memphis Police Department testified that in the early morning\nhours of July 14, 2004, he was dispatched to Longmont Drive in Shelby County, Tennessee. He was\ntold by the dispatcher that shots had been fired in the area and two people had been hit. When he\narrived at the scene he observed that a large crowd had gathered. He then saw a young lady who\nappeared lifeless. Next to her was a young man. The man was alive but his breathing was shallow.\nOfficer Quinn observed that both individuals had gunshot wounds, and he saw shell casings on the\nground. The two individuals were eventually taken to a hospital by ambulance.\n\n        Joshua Parker testified that around 11:00 p.m. on July 13, 2005, he and a friend, Timothy\nPayne, were riding around in Parker\u2019s car. At some point, he received several phone calls from an\nindividual named Raphael Love. According to Parker, he had met Love a few months earlier at\nschool. Love had called Parker because he wanted Parker to give him a ride to a house on Frayser\nBoulevard. Love told Parker that the house was his aunt\u2019s house and that it had been \u201cshot up.\u201d\nParker stated that he did not believe Love but after receiving numerous phone calls from Love, he\nand Payne decided to drive by the house to corroborate Love\u2019s story. As they approached the house,\nthey passed Love, who was riding in someone else\u2019s car. Love called Parker again and asked Parker\nto turn around and pick him up. Parker told Love that he already had a ride. However, the car Love\nwas riding in stopped and Love got out. Love retrieved some garbage bags from the car and walked\nover to Parker\u2019s car and placed the garbage bags into the trunk of Parker\u2019s car. Parker then took\nLove to his aunt\u2019s house, and Love showed Parker and Payne the bullet holes.\n\n        Parker testified that Love asked to be dropped off at his cousin\u2019s house in Frayser. However,\nen route, they picked up an individual named Sedaris Walker. Love then decided that he wanted to\nshow Walker the damage to his aunt\u2019s house, so they went back to the house. Afterwards, Love told\nParker to drive to Breezy Point. En route, they saw the defendant. Love told Parker to stop the car\nand pick up the defendant. Parker complied and then at Love\u2019s insistence drove back to Love\u2019s\naunt\u2019s house where they once again surveyed the damage. According to Parker, he then drove the\nmen down the street to where an abandoned Cadillac was parked. Love, Walker, and the defendant\nexited Parker\u2019s car and walked over to the Cadillac, where they removed some garbage bags and put\nthem in the trunk of Parker\u2019s car. Parker recalled that they drove around for a while but eventually\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\fdrove back to Love\u2019s aunt\u2019s house. When they arrived, Love, Walker, and the defendant got out of\nParker\u2019s car and told him to open the trunk. Looking through his side view mirror, Parker saw Love\nholding a rifle. When Love got back into the backseat of Parker\u2019s car, Parker told Love that he did\nnot want guns in the car. Love then called someone else for a ride.\n\n        Parker testified that after waiting for forty-five minutes for someone to pick up Love, Walker,\nand the defendant, Love convinced him to give the men a ride to the Timberlake area. Love told\nParker that \u201cwe ain\u2019t going to shoot nobody, we just going to shoot in the air just to scare them.\u201d\nParked testified that he believed Love and decided to drive the men to the Timberlake area. Parker\nrecalled that he drove past Longmont Drive, pulled into a cove, and parked the car. Love, Walker,\nand the defendant got out of the car and retrieved the guns from the trunk. According to Parker, all\nthree men were armed. Parker recalled that Love carried a rifle with a scope on it, and the defendant\ncarried a shotgun. As the three men began to walk away, Parker told Love that he was going to\nleave. In response, the defendant turned around and told Parker that he had better not leave. Parker\nproceeded to back his car into the shadows and turned the engine off.\n\n        Parker testified that a few minutes after he parked his car he heard several rapid gunshots.\nHe then saw Love, Walker, and the defendant running up the street. Love spotted Parker\u2019s car and\nyelled at Parker to \u201ccome on.\u201d Parker said he hesitated at first but then drove over to where the men\nwere standing and picked them up. Parker noted that the three men were still armed. After driving\na short distance, Parker stopped the car so the men could put their guns in the trunk. Parker recalled\nthat he eventually dropped the men off at different locations as directed.\n\n        Timothy Payne testified similarly to Parker. Payne recalled that on the night of the murders\nhe was riding around with his friend, Parker. He noted that he was talking to his girlfriend on the\nphone most of the night. Payne recounted that Love called Parker a number of times, and eventually,\nParker talked to Love and drove over to a house. According to Payne, Love showed them bullet\nholes in the walls of his aunt\u2019s house and in a van parked in front of the house. Love was angry\nabout the shooting and said he knew who had done it. Love got into the backseat of Parker\u2019s car and\ntold Parker to drive to his cousin\u2019s house. However, they ended up driving to Walker\u2019s house. Upon\narrival at Walker\u2019s house, Love got out of the car and went inside the house to talk to Walker. Payne\nstated that he and Parker stayed in the car. Payne said he was talking to his girlfriend at the time.\n\n        Payne testified that after about five minutes Love and Walker came out of the house and got\ninto the backseat of Parker\u2019s car. Parker drove everyone back to Love\u2019s aunt\u2019s house. Once they\npulled up, Love and Walker got out of the car and surveyed the damage. Payne recalled that Love\nand Walker were talking, but he could not hear the conversation. At this time, Payne saw the\ndefendant walking down the street. The defendant walked over to where Love and Walker were\nstanding, and the three men began to talk. After about five minutes, the three men got back into\nParker\u2019s car and Love told Parker to drive to an abandoned Cadillac with flat tires located a couple\nhouses down. Love, Walker, and the defendant exited the car and Love opened the Cadillac\u2019s trunk\nand removed a black garbage bag. Payne recalled that he thought the bag contained Love\u2019s clothing\nbecause Love had indicated that he had been kicked out of his aunt\u2019s house and wanted to go over\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fto his cousin\u2019s house. According to Payne, Love put the garbage bag in the trunk of Parker\u2019s car and\ntold Parker to drive through the Timberlake area on the way to Love\u2019s cousin\u2019s house. Parker drove\nthrough Timberlake. Love said he did not see anyone so he told Parker to head back to his aunt\u2019s\nhouse. However, a few minutes after arriving at Love\u2019s aunt\u2019s house, Love asked Parker to go back\nto the Timberlake area. At this time, it was after midnight.\n\n        Payne testified that while driving through the Timberlake area, Love told Parker to stop the\ncar because he saw someone. Payne said he assumed Love was talking about his cousin. Payne\nrecalled that Parker stopped the car in a cove; whereupon, Love, Walker, and the defendant got out\nand went to the trunk. Parker popped the trunk open from inside the car, and Love removed the\ngarbage bag. Love, Walker, and the defendant then walked down the street. A few minutes later,\nPayne heard a barrage of gunshots. Payne recalled that he and Parker were scared and Parker began\nto drive away. At this time, they saw Love, Walker, and the defendant running down the street.\nLove yelled for Parker to stop the car and Love, Walker, and the defendant piled into the backseat.\nPayne noticed that all three men were carrying guns. Walker had a shotgun, and Love and the\ndefendant had assault rifles. As they were getting into the car, Payne heard the defendant say, \u201cI\nthink I shot somebody.\u201d Love told Parker to drive around the corner. Once around the corner,\nParker stopped the car at Love\u2019s request and the three men put their guns in the trunk of Parker\u2019s car.\nThereafter, Parker took the defendant home and then dropped off Love and Walker. Love took the\nguns out of Parker\u2019s trunk and took them inside his cousin\u2019s house. Payne said that he later learned\nthat two people had been shot and killed.\n\n       Memphis Police Officer Demar Wells testified that on July 14, 2005, around 2:00 a.m., he\nconducted the investigation of the crime scene at the intersection of Windermere and Longmont.\nHe found multiple spent shell casings, shotgun wads and shotgun shells. He also found ten 7.63\ncasings, which indicated the possibility that an assault rifle was used. Officer Wells noted that AK\n47\u2019s, SK\u2019s and Mas 90 weapons use these casings.\n\n        Dr. Karen Chancellor testified that she was a forensic pathologist with the Shelby County\nMedical Examiner\u2019s Office. She reviewed the autopsy reports generated from the autopsies of the\ntwo victims, Jessica Sisson and David McVay. Dr. Chancellor testified that Sisson\u2019s death resulted\nfrom a single gunshot wound. One bullet had gone completely through Sisson\u2019s body. The bullet\ndamaged Sisson\u2019s left lung, which resulted in hemorrhaging, and passed through her heart. Three\nphotographs were entered into evidence. Two photographs depicted a gunshot wound to the front\nof Sisson\u2019s chest and her back. The other photograph was an autopsy identification photograph,\nshowing Sisson\u2019s face and shoulders. Dr. Chancellor noted that Sisson\u2019s death was reported as a\nhomicide.\n\n       Dr. Chancellor stated that McVay suffered from two gunshot wounds to his body. He\nreceived a wound to the inner aspect of his right arm and a wound to the right side of his chest,\nunderneath the arm. According to Dr. Chancellor, the bullet damaged McVay\u2019s right lung and heart.\nFour photographs were entered into evidence. Two photographs depicted gunshot wounds to\nMcVay\u2019s arm and chest. One photograph was an autopsy identification photograph, showing\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fMcVay\u2019s face and shoulders. One photograph showed the bullet removed from McVay\u2019s body. Dr.\nChancellor noted that McVay\u2019s death was reported as a homicide.\n\n       At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of two counts of first degree\npremeditated murder. Thereafter, he was ordered to serve two consecutive sentences of life\nimprisonment.\n\n                                             ANALYSIS\n\n                                   I. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n        On appeal, the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for his convictions for\nfirst degree premeditated murder. Specifically, the defendant contends that the trial court erred in\ndenying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the testimony of Joshua Parker and Timothy\nPayne was accomplice testimony and not corroborated and therefore insufficient to support his\nconvictions.\n\n       Initially, we note that \u201c[t]he standard by which the trial court determines a motion for\njudgment of acquittal at the end of all the proof is, in essence, the same standard which applies on\nappeal in determining the sufficiency of the evidence after a conviction.\u201d State v. Thompson, 88\nS.W.3d 611, 614-15 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000); see also State v. Ball, 973 S.W.2d 288, 292 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. 1998). Therefore, we address the defendant\u2019s argument under a sufficiency of the\nevidence standard of review.\n\n         It is well-established that once a jury finds a defendant guilty, his or her presumption of\ninnocence is removed and replaced with a presumption of guilt. State v. Evans, 838 S.W.2d 185,\n191 (Tenn. 1992). Therefore, on appeal, the convicted defendant has the burden of demonstrating\nto this court why the evidence will not support the jury\u2019s verdict. State v. Carruthers, 35 S.W.3d\n516, 557-58 (Tenn. 2000); State v. Tuggle, 639 S.W.2d 913, 914 (Tenn. 1982). To meet this burden,\nthe defendant must establish that no \u201crational trier of fact\u201d could have found the essential elements\nof the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979); State v.\nEvans, 108 S.W.3d 231, 236 (Tenn. 2003); see also Tenn. R. App. P. 13(e). In contrast, the jury\u2019s\nverdict approved by the trial judge accredits the state\u2019s witnesses and resolves all conflicts in favor\nof the state. State v. Harris, 839 S.W.2d 54, 75 (Tenn. 1992). The state is entitled to the strongest\nlegitimate view of the evidence and all reasonable inferences which may be drawn from that\nevidence. Carruthers, 35 S.W.3d at 558. Questions concerning the credibility of the witnesses,\nconflicts in trial testimony, the weight and value to be given the evidence, and all factual issues\nraised by the evidence are resolved by the trier of fact and not this court. State v. Bland, 958 S.W.2d\n651, 659 (Tenn. 1997). We do not attempt to re-weigh or re-evaluate the evidence. State v. Rice,\n184 S.W.3d 646, 662 (Tenn. 2006). Likewise, we do not replace the jury\u2019s inferences drawn from\nthe circumstantial evidence with our own inferences. State v. Reid, 91 S.W.3d 247, 277 (Tenn.\n2002).\n\n\n\n                                                  -5-\n\f        In Tennessee, a conviction may not be based solely upon the uncorroborated testimony of an\naccomplice. State v. Bane, 57 S.W.3d 411, 419 (Tenn. 2001); State v. Shaw, 37 S.W.3d 900, 903\n(Tenn. 2001). Furthermore, accomplices cannot corroborate each other. State v. Boxley, 76 S.W.3d\n381, 386 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2001). \u201cAn accomplice is one who knowingly, voluntarily, and with\ncommon intent unites with the principal offender in the commission of a crime.\u201d State v. Allen, 976\nS.W.2d 661, 666 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997). Typically, the test for determining whether a witness\nis an accomplice is whether he or she could have been convicted for the offense. Id.; State v.\nLawson, 794 S.W.2d 363, 369 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1990).\n\n        The question of who determines whether a witness is an accomplice depends upon the\nevidence introduced during the course of a trial. Bethany v. State, 565 S.W.2d 900, 903 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. 1978). When the undisputed evidence clearly establishes the witness is an accomplice as a\nmatter of law, the trial court, not the jury, must decide this issue. Lawson, 794 S.W.2d at 369. On\nthe other hand, if the evidence adduced at trial is unclear, conflicts, or is subject to different\ninferences, the jury, as the trier of fact, is to decide if the witness is an accomplice. Id. If the jury\nfinds accomplice status, then the issue of whether the witness\u2019s testimony has been sufficiently\ncorroborated becomes a matter entrusted to the jury as the trier of fact. State v. Bigbee, 885 S.W.2d\n797, 803 (Tenn. 1994).\n\n        In the present case, the trial court found that witnesses, Joshua Parker and Timothy Payne,\nwere not accomplices as a matter of law and that their status as accomplices was a question for the\njury to decide. The trial court charged the jury as follows:\n\n                An accomplice is a person who knowingly, voluntarily, and with common\n        intent with the principal offender unites with him or her in the commission of the\n        crime.\n\n                If a witness was an accomplice in the crime, then his or her testimony must\n        be corroborated. Corroborating evidence is evidence, entirely independent of the\n        accomplice\u2019s testimony, which taken by itself, leads to the inference not only that a\n        crime has been committed but also that the defendant was implicated in it. . . . It is\n        a question for the jury to determine whether an accomplice\u2019s testimony has been\n        sufficiently corroborated. Accomplice testimony cannot be corroborated by another\n        accomplice\u2019s testimony.\n\n                 In this case it is a question for the jury to determine whether the witnesses\n        Timothy Payne and Joshua Parker, were accomplices in the alleged crime. If you\n        find from the proof that the witnesses were accomplices, then the defendant cannot\n        be convicted upon the uncorroborated testimony of these witnesses. If you find that\n        the witnesses were not accomplices, then you will judge the weight to be given to\n        their testimony just as you do that of the other witnesses in the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -6-\n\f        In the present case, the evidence does not support the defendant\u2019s contention that Joshua\nParker and Timothy Payne were accomplices to the murders. Their testimony regarding their\ninvolvement clearly places their accomplice status in dispute. Parker and Payne both testified that\nthey were riding around together and eventually gave a ride to Love, Walker, and the defendant.\nParker and Payne were not privy to the conversations between Love, Walker, and the defendant, and\nthey did not know what the three men had planned. Parker and Payne\u2019s testimony also reflects that\nthey became afraid of Love, Walker, and the defendant. After dropping the three men off near\nLongmont Drive, Parker testified that he told the three men he was leaving; whereupon, the\ndefendant, who was holding a gun at the time, told Parker that he had better not leave. Accordingly,\nthere is little, if any evidence establishing that Parker and Payne knowingly, voluntarily, and with\ncommon intent, united with the principal offenders to commit the murders. Whatever evidence\nimplicating Parker and Payne as accomplices conflicts with evidence indicating their ignorance and\ninnocence of the events surrounding the criminal acts. By its verdict, the jury obviously found that\nthe evidence supported a finding that Parker and Payne were not accomplices to the murders.\nAccordingly, the defendant\u2019s argument in this regard is without merit.\n\n        Turning to the evidence presented at trial, we note that the defendant was convicted of two\ncounts of first degree murder. First degree murder is defined in pertinent part as the \u201cpremeditated\nand intentional killing of another.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-202(a)(1). \u201c\u2018Intentional\u2019 refers to a\nperson who acts intentionally with respect to the nature of the conduct or to a result of the conduct\nwhen it is the person\u2019s conscious objective or desire to engage in the conduct or cause the result.\u201d\nId. \u00a7 39-11-302(a). Premeditation refers to \u201can act done after the exercise of reflection and\njudgment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 39-13-202(d). Moreover, premeditation \u201cmeans that the intent to kill must have\nbeen formed prior to the act itself. It is not necessary that the purpose to kill pre-exist in the mind\nof the accused for any definite period of time.\u201d Id.\n\n        The jury in this case was not only instructed on the elements of first degree murder and lesser\nincluded offenses, but also on the theory of criminal responsibility for the conduct of another. \u201cA\nperson is criminally responsible as a party to an offense if the offense is committed by the person\u2019s\nown conduct, by the conduct of another for which the person is criminally responsible, or by both.\u201d\nId. \u00a7 39-11-401(a). One is criminally responsible for an offense committed by another when,\n\u201c[acting with intent to promote or assist the commission of the offense, or to benefit in the proceeds\nor results of the offense, the person solicits, directs, aids, or attempts to aid another person to commit\nthe offense.\u201d Id. \u00a7 40-11-402(2). Criminal responsibility is not a separate crime but \u201csolely a theory\nby which the State may prove the defendant\u2019s guilt of the alleged offense . . . based upon the conduct\nof another person.\u201d State v. Dickens, 123 S.W.3d 355, 389-90 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2003) (quoting\nState v. Lemacks, 996 S.W.2d 166, 170 (Tenn. 1999)). To be criminally responsible for the acts of\nanother, the defendant must \u201cin some way associate himself with the venture, act with knowledge\nthat an offense is to be committed, and share in the criminal intent of the principal in the first\ndegree.\u201d State v. Maxey, 898 S.W.2d 756, 757 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994) (quoting Hembree v. State,\n546 S.W.2d 235, 239 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1976)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   -7-\n\f        Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, the proof established that the\nmurders of David McVay and Jessica Sisson were both premeditated and intentional and that the\ndefendant knowingly participated in their murders. The proof shows that Love was angry at\nsomeone who had \u201cshot up\u201d his aunt\u2019s house. After surveying the damage done to Love\u2019s aunt\u2019s\nhouse, Love, Walker, and the defendant drove over to an abandoned Cadillac and retrieved some\ngarbage bags containing Love\u2019s guns. After driving through the Timberlake area of Memphis for\na second time, Love told Parker to stop the car near Longmont Drive because he recognized\nsomeone. Love, Walker, and the defendant then exited the car, armed themselves, and walked up\nthe street. The defendant told Parker, the driver, not to leave. Soon thereafter, shots were fired and\nthe three men ran back to the car, each carrying a gun. The defendant was heard saying, \u201cI think I\nshot somebody.\u201d Both McVay and Sisson were shot near Longmont Drive and subsequently died\nfrom gunshot wounds. The jury in this case was instructed on the theory of criminal responsibility,\nheard all of the evidence, weighed the credibility of the witnesses, and found the defendant guilty\nof two counts of first degree murder. Consequently, we conclude that the evidence presented at trial\nwas sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s convictions for first degree murder.\n\n                                  II. Admission of Photographs\n\n        The defendant next contends that the trial court erred in admitting photographs of the\ndeceased victims. The defendant claims that the probative value of the photographs was\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, especially given that the\ndefendant offered to stipulate to the fact that the victims were deceased. In rebuttal, the state argues\nthat the trial court did not err in admitting the photographs because the defendant\u2019s stipulation did\nnot erase the state\u2019s obligation to prove that the victims had been alive and that they had died.\n\n         Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine to exclude certain autopsy photographs\nof the victims. The defendant argued that the admission of the photographs would be prejudicial and\ntold the court that he was willing to stipulate that the victims were deceased. The state argued that\nthe admission of the photographs was necessary to prove as part of their case that the victims \u201cwere\nliving persons, and at some point they died.\u201d Thereafter, the state announced that it planned to\nintroduce additional autopsy photographs depicting the bullet wounds to the victims\u2019 bodies. The\nstate noted that the pictures were not gruesome and were necessary to show the cause and manner\nof the victims\u2019 death. The defendant renewed his objection to the photographs, asserting that they\nwere graphic and the probative value of the photographs would be far outweighed by any prejudicial\neffect, especially since the method of death was not in dispute. The trial court allowed the admission\nof the photographs, finding that the defendant\u2019s stipulation did not erase the state\u2019s obligation to\nprove that the victims had been alive and that they had died. The court also noted that the\nphotographs depicting the bullet wounds were not overly gruesome and relevant to the autopsy\nreport.\n\n       Upon review, we note that the appellate record does not include the autopsy photographs\npresented to the jury and entered into evidence by the state as exhibits 2, 4, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22.\nObviously, without seeing the photographs, this court cannot gauge their relevance or their potential\n\n\n                                                  -8-\n\ffor unfair prejudice. Significantly, the defendant, as the appellant, has the burden of presenting this\ncourt with a record that conveys a fair and accurate account of what transpired with respect to the\nissues raised on appeal. See State v. Ballard, 855 S.W.2d 557, 560 (Tenn. 1993); see also Tenn. R.\nApp. P. 24(b). Without a proper record this court is precluded from considering the issue and must\npresume that the trial court\u2019s rulings were correct. See State v. Oody, 823 S.W.2d 554, 559 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. 1991). Therefore, the defendant is not entitled to relief on this issue.\n\n                                           III. Sentencing\n\n         The defendant next contends that the trial court erred in ordering him to serve his life\nsentences consecutively because he was only fifteen years old when he committed the offenses and\nhad regular problems as a teenager. The defendant further submits that because his actions resulted\nin the simultaneous death of both victims, his actions should be considered as one act for sentencing\npurposes.\n\n         When a defendant challenges the length and manner of service of a sentence, this court\nconducts a de novo review of the record with a presumption that the trial court\u2019s determinations are\ncorrect. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-401. This presumption of correctness is conditioned upon the\naffirmative showing in the record that the trial court considered the sentencing principles and all\nrelevant facts and circumstances. State v. Pettus, 986 S.W.2d 540, 543-44 (Tenn. 1999). However,\nif the record shows that the trial court failed to consider the sentencing principles and all relevant\nfacts and circumstances, then review of the challenged sentence is purely de novo without the\npresumption of correctness. State v. Ashby, 823 S.W.2d 166, 169 (Tenn. 1991). On appeal, the\nparty challenging the sentence imposed by the trial court has the burden of establishing that the\nsentence is erroneous. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-401, Sentencing Commission Comments. We\nwill uphold the sentence imposed by the trial court if: (1) the sentence complies with our sentencing\nstatutes, and (2) the trial court\u2019s findings are adequately supported by the record. See State v. Arnett,\n49 S.W.3d 250, 257 (Tenn. 2001); see also Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-210(f).\n\n        A trial court may impose consecutive sentencing upon a determination by a preponderance\nof the evidence that one or more of the criteria set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated section\n40-35-115(b) exists. Therefore, pursuant to this code section, a trial court may impose consecutive\nsentencing if it determines any one of the following criteria applies:\n\n        (1) The defendant is a professional criminal who has knowingly devoted such\n        defendant\u2019s life to criminal acts as a major source of livelihood;\n\n        (2) The defendant is an offender whose record of criminal activity is extensive;\n\n        (3) The defendant is a dangerous mentally abnormal person so declared by a\n        competent psychiatrist who concludes as a result of an investigation prior to\n        sentencing that the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct has been characterized by a pattern\n        of repetitive or compulsive behavior with heedless indifference to consequences;\n\n\n                                                  -9-\n\f        (4) The defendant is a dangerous offender whose behavior indicates little or no regard\n        for human life, and no hesitation about committing a crime in which the risk to\n        human life is high;\n\n        (5) The defendant is convicted of two (2) or more statutory offenses involving sexual\n        abuse of a minor with consideration of the aggravating circumstances arising from\n        the relationship between the defendant and victim or victims, the time span of\n        defendant\u2019s undetected sexual activity, the nature and scope of the sexual acts and\n        the extent of the residual, physical and mental damage to the victim or victims;\n\n        (6) The defendant is sentenced for an offense committed while on probation; or\n\n        (7) The defendant is sentenced for criminal contempt.\n\nId. The criteria are stated in the alternative; therefore, only one need exist to support the imposition\nof consecutive sentencing. However, if the trial court imposes consecutive sentencing based solely\nupon a finding that the defendant is a dangerous offender, the court must also determine whether the\nsentences imposed are reasonably related to the severity of the offenses and necessary to protect the\npublic from further criminal activity by the defendant. State v. Wilkerson, 905 S.W.2d 933, 939\n(Tenn. 1995). Additionally, the trial court should consider general sentencing principles including\nwhether or not the length of a sentence is justly deserved in relation to the seriousness of the offense.\nState v. Imfeld, 70 S.W.3d 698, 708 (Tenn. 2002). It is within the sound discretion of the trial court\nwhether or not to impose consecutive sentences. See State v. Adams, 973 S.W.2d 224, 230-31\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1997).\n\n        In ordering consecutive sentences, the trial court found the following:\n\n               In looking at 40-35-115, I\u2019m looking at just the . . . adult [type] convictions,\n        August \u201803. Probation, he violates it within sixty days. Inability to conform his\n        behavior to the requirements of the law. Assaults in school. On school property\n        without consent.\n\n                ....\n\n                I\u2019m looking at the . . . weapons; one was a shotgun and one was the AK 47,\n        which is military assault rifle. And not only the weapon, but the ammunition, the\n        7.62, is high powered. . . .\n\n                ....\n\n               And, when you look at the nature and circumstances of the offense; killing\n        two teenagers who had no connection with this defendant. One, having been shot a\n        hundred yards with an AK 47. While that is not uncommon with that weapon, that\n\n\n                                                  -10-\n\f       ammunition would travel a hundred yards. It is before this Court, unusual, that\n       unless you practice shooting that weapon, you would have difficulty killing two\n       people at a hundred yards.\n\n              And, yet, he did it. The jury found that he did it. His criminal history at\n       Bolton High School. One of our better high schools, is very, very impressive.\n\n               And, certainly, I have to look at the severity of the offense. I have to look at\n       the nature and circumstances of the offenses and how it occurred, why it occurred,\n       what his considerations were in shooting two people he didn\u2019t know, he just saw\n       [them] at a distance and decided to kill them.\n\n       The jury properly found that he committed the offense of murder in the first degree.\n       I properly find . . . that, under the law defined and explained by this Court today, that\n       . . . those sentences shall be served consecutive.\n\n        Based on our review, we conclude that the trial court did not err in imposing consecutive\nsentences. First, a review of the defendant\u2019s juvenile record shows that in August 2003, he\ncommitted the offense of possession with intent to sell marijuana and was placed on supervised\nprobation. In October 2003, he violated the terms of his probation by becoming involved in gang\nactivity, running away from home, and truancy. His probation was reinstated, but a month later he\nbecame embroiled in a fight at school and was subsequently charged with assault in March 2004.\nThe defendant\u2019s probation was again reinstated, but in May of 2004 he got into another fight at\nschool. As a result, he was placed in the Hanover House Program. In September of 2004, the\ndefendant was arrested for trespassing on school property. At that time, he was taken out of Hanover\nHouse Program and placed into the Shelby County Training Center. In January 2005, the defendant\nwas returned to the custody of his mother. However, in July of 2005, the defendant was reported for\nviolating his curfew and running away from home. Also, in July, the defendant participated in the\naforementioned murders. As such, the record supports the court\u2019s finding that the defendant had an\nextensive criminal history. This finding alone justifies consecutive sentencing. See Tenn. Code\nAnn. \u00a7 40-35-115(b)(2). Additionally, while we note that the court\u2019s comments regarding the\ndefendant\u2019s familiarity with the AK rifle were speculative, we discern no error in the court\u2019s finding\nthat the defendant was a dangerous offender. Accordingly, the defendant is not entitled to relief on\nthis issue.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       Based upon the foregoing review, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences.\n\n\n\n                                                        ___________________________________\n                                                        J.C.
