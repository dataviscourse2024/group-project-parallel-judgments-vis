See \u00a7 782.04(1)(a), Fla. Stat.\n\n(2013). At the end of the penalty phase, he was sentenced to death\n\nfor each murder. This is Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s direct appeal of his\n\nconvictions and sentences, over which we have jurisdiction. See\n\nart. V, \u00a7 3(b)(1), Fla. Const.\n\n     We affirm Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s convictions. The trial court\n\ncommitted no reversible error during Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s guilt\n\fphase proceedings, and the State presented competent, substantial\n\nevidence to support the jury\u2019s verdicts. But we set aside Figueroa-\n\nSanabria\u2019s sentences of death and remand his case for a new\n\npenalty phase because we find that he was deprived of his right to\n\n\u201chave the Assistance of Counsel for his defence\u201d when the trial\n\ncourt put him to an improper choice at the outset of that phase of\n\nthe proceedings. Amend. VI, U.S. Const.\n\n                                  I\n\n                                  A\n\n     Early in the morning on April 12, 2013, Germana Morin and\n\nJohn Travlos were stabbed to death on their houseboat in St.\n\nPetersburg. Both were found face down; duct tape bound together\n\nMorin\u2019s ankles and wound around Travlos\u2019s left wrist and ankle.\n\n     Morin was stabbed first in bed and then, mortally, on the\n\nground. A stab wound twenty centimeters long severed her jugular\n\nvein; it was deep enough to hit a disc of her spinal cord. She also\n\nsuffered two stab wounds to the chest, which resulted in two\n\nperforations of her left lung and slowly made it harder for her to\n\nbreathe. Travlos, too, was first stabbed in bed, then suffered ten\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fmore stab wounds to his chest before he died. The intruder made\n\noff with the victims\u2019 jewelry, valued at over $80,000.\n\n     As the authorities investigated, they learned that the last time\n\nthe victims were seen alive was around 9:00 p.m. on April 11 by a\n\nvisiting neighbor. Security footage showed that the houseboat\u2019s\n\nmotion-sensing lights, which could be triggered by a person walking\n\nacross the gangplank, turned off at 10:42 p.m. on the 11th and\n\nwere next illuminated at 2:29 a.m. on the 12th. The lights then\n\nturned off at 3:49 a.m. and did not come on for the rest of the day.\n\nAn examination of Travlos\u2019s computer revealed that someone had\n\nused it to access his contact list at 3:43 a.m. That list contained\n\nthe combination to his safe where some of the jewelry was stored.\n\nThere was no evidence of damage to any of the locks on the\n\nhouseboat. Two workers found the bodies around 11:00 a.m.\n\n     According to a neighbor, Reynaldo Figueroa-Sanabria was\n\nseen at the houseboat at 7:00 p.m. on the 11th, but he left soon\n\nafter. Figueroa-Sanabria, the victims\u2019 handyman, was often given a\n\nkey to the houseboat so that he could access it to work. Some\n\nweeks earlier, according to both Figueroa-Sanabria and other\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fwitnesses, Figueroa-Sanabria had argued with Travlos about his\n\nwages, but he eventually returned to the job.\n\n     Figueroa-Sanabria lived in an apartment complex across the\n\nstreet from the marina where the houseboat was docked with his\n\ngirlfriend, Tessa Cooper. According to Cooper, who later assisted\n\nthe police with its investigation, the couple went to sleep around\n\n1:00 a.m. on the 12th. She woke up to a phone call from Figueroa-\n\nSanabria around 4:30 a.m. that morning. He sounded to Cooper\n\n\u201clike he was in a panic\u201d and asked her to pick him up near the\n\nmarina.\n\n     Cooper found Figueroa-Sanabria holding a backpack. He told\n\nher that he needed to travel to New York to see his brother. 1 The\n\ncouple stopped at their apartment before heading to the airport. On\n\nthe way to the airport, however, Figueroa-Sanabria told Cooper he\n\nhad changed his mind; he asked her to take him to rent a car.\n\n\n\n\n     1. Figueroa-Sanabria was in frequent communication with his\nbrother on the 11th and 12th. One detective testified that certain\ntext messages sent to Figueroa-Sanabria by his brother after the\ncrimes occurred were no longer on Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s phone.\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fCooper later testified that, sometime during this drive, she saw\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria hold a knife in his lap with his hand over it.\n\n     They stopped at a gas station and Cooper vacuumed out her\n\nvan. Figueroa-Sanabria walked over to a dumpster and threw away\n\nsome grocery bags. Later, the assistant manager of the gas station\n\ndiscovered bloodstained clothes in the dumpster, including two t-\n\nshirts\u2014one white and the other gray\u2014a pair of jeans, and a belt, all\n\nof which Cooper later identified as Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s. 2 After\n\nleaving the gas station, the couple went back to their apartment,\n\nand then later went on the hunt for a rental car.\n\n     Failing to find one, the couple instead went to a jewelry store.\n\nThere, around 9:30 a.m., Figueroa-Sanabria sold a necklace and\n\nbracelet for a combined $2,569, which included $2,000 in bills\n\nwrapped in a bank strap. 3 Cooper testified that Figueroa-Sanabria\n\n\n\n\n      2. Some of the clothing also had what appeared to be white\npaint stains. Figueroa-Sanabria testified that he had been painting\nthe victims\u2019 houseboat on April 11.\n\n     3. Figueroa-Sanabria also tried to sell two rings but,\naccording to testimony of a staff member at the jewelry store, he\ndecided against it when the staff member informed him that a\ngemologist would need to look at them first. Figueroa-Sanabria told\none investigator that he had owned the jewelry for a while, yet at\n\n                                -5-\n\fcarried the jewelry in the backpack that he had when she picked\n\nhim up earlier that morning.\n\n     After leaving the jewelry store, Figueroa-Sanabria finally found\n\na company that would rent him a car. There, after Figueroa-\n\nSanabria instructed Cooper to mention nothing about the morning\n\nother than that she dropped him off at a car rental business and\n\nthat he was traveling to see his brother, the couple parted ways.\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria began to travel northeast, reaching a shipping\n\nbusiness in Palm Coast on the afternoon of the 12th. From there,\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria sent a package to his brother in New York. It\n\nwas later found to contain over one hundred pieces of jewelry.\n\n     As Figueroa-Sanabria continued north, the investigation into\n\nthe murders began. According to the testimony of a detective, the\n\nname \u201cRey\u201d came up repeatedly around the marina. Soon\n\ninvestigators found the apartment complex where Cooper and\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria lived and impounded the van that the couple\n\nhad been driving around town. Cooper told the police what had\n\n\n\n\nanother point testified that Cooper had given it to him that\nmorning. The jewelry was later identified as Travlos\u2019s.\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fhappened earlier that morning. 4 They persuaded a judge to issue a\n\nwarrant for Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s arrest.\n\n     Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s run ended just hours later in North\n\nCarolina. The officer who arrested him explained that law\n\nenforcement in Florida wanted to speak with him; Figueroa-\n\nSanabria replied that he \u201cfigured they would.\u201d A search of\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria\u2019s vehicle revealed, among other things, a cell\n\nphone with the battery removed and a black backpack. He was\n\ncarrying the money band from the jewelry store that he had visited\n\nthe prior day; later, he tried to get rid of it outside the county jail\n\nwhere he was held. An officer found it tucked behind a gutter.\n\n     On April 18, 2013, a grand jury indicted Figueroa-Sanabria on\n\ntwo counts of first-degree murder.\n\n\n\n\n     4. Cooper and Figueroa-Sanabria remained in communication\nthroughout the day on the 12th. At one point, Figueroa-Sanabria\ntexted Cooper asking her if she had seen the police. He told her\nthat he had received a call from the property manager of their\napartment complex informing him that police were there and\nwanted to speak with him.\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f                                  B\n\n     The court appointed Keith Hammond as Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s\n\nlawyer in January 2014 after the public defender\u2019s office withdrew\n\nfor conflict reasons. 5 The attorney-client relationship between\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria and Hammond was fraught. Over the next five\n\nyears, Figueroa-Sanabria repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with\n\nHammond\u2019s representation. Along with complaints raised in\n\npretrial hearings, Figueroa-Sanabria filed three motions before trial\n\nin which he asked the court to dismiss Hammond and appoint new\n\ncounsel. His grievances included a lack of communication and a\n\nlack of progress in preparing for trial. For example, at one hearing\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria told the court that Hammond had not visited\n\nhim for almost a year, and at a later hearing he told the court that\n\nHammond had only been to see him ten times in the preceding\n\ntwenty-two months, with the visits cumulatively lasting less than\n\nten hours.\n\n\n\n\n     5. The court also appointed Daniel Hernandez as co-counsel,\nwho was assigned to handle the penalty phase if Figueroa-Sanabria\nwas convicted.\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f     Hammond himself recognized these issues, telling the court\n\nonce that he had an \u201cethical problem\u201d because of his workload and\n\nlow staffing, and then suggesting to the court that it should\n\n\u201cseriously consider appointing somebody else.\u201d At another hearing,\n\nspeaking of Figueroa-Sanabria, Hammond remarked that \u201cI drive\n\nhim crazy, and he drives me crazy.\u201d And on another occasion,\n\nHammond said that his ability to represent Figueroa-Sanabria was\n\n\u201cborderline,\u201d and projected that his representation of Figueroa-\n\nSanabria was \u201cgoing to cause a problem for the next 20 years.\u201d\n\nDespite these issues, Hammond told the court that he could\n\nrepresent Figueroa-Sanabria.\n\n     All three motions filed by Figueroa-Sanabria were denied by\n\nthe trial court. 6 Each time, the court, after a hearing, found that\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria had not provided an adequate basis for his\n\nrequest and that Hammond was providing adequate representation.\n\nAfter the first request, which was in October 2014, Hammond met\n\n\n\n\n     6. The three motions were denied by three different trial\njudges. The first, Judge Nancy Moate Ley, moved divisions, so\nJudge Thane Covert took over in early 2015. Judge Pat Siracusa\nthen took over in early 2017 and eventually presided over the trial.\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\ftwice with Figueroa-Sanabria, demonstrated progress on discovery\n\nmatters, and successfully sought a continuance. At one point,\n\nhowever, after his second request to replace Hammond was denied,\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria decided to represent himself. But almost six\n\nmonths later, in August 2016, he changed his mind and asked for\n\ncounsel. Hammond, who was serving as standby counsel, was\n\nreinstated.\n\n     In September 2017, after denying Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s third\n\nrequest to replace Hammond, the court asked Figueroa-Sanabria to\n\nlist discovery objectives that he wanted accomplished. It told\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria that it would appoint a new attorney if\n\nHammond failed to accomplish what was listed. Hammond\n\ndemonstrated progress over the course of pretrial hearings that took\n\nplace the next year; however, Figueroa-Sanabria continued to send\n\nletters to the court documenting his frustration with Hammond\u2019s\n\nrepresentation.\n\n     In March 2019, the trial court asked Hammond and the State\n\nabout the progress of certain discovery matters. Among other\n\nthings, Figueroa-Sanabria had requested several depositions and\n\nbackground checks, and the acquisition of surveillance videos from\n\n\n                               - 10 -\n\fthe gas station where the clothes were dumped. Hammond sought\n\na continuance to allow for additional time to prepare for trial, which\n\nthe court granted. Over the next months, Hammond again\n\ndisplayed progress when it came to Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s requests,\n\nleading the trial court to conclude that the case was ready to be\n\ntried.\n\n     Only a few days before trial, though, Figueroa-Sanabria wrote\n\nanother letter to the court with objections about Hammond\u2019s\n\nrepresentation. He again complained about Hammond\u2019s lack of\n\ncommunication and lack of progress in investigating certain issues,\n\nsuch as whether the clothes found in the dumpster were Figueroa-\n\nSanabria\u2019s size or had his DNA on them, and the State\u2019s acquisition\n\nof Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s cell phone and the historical cell site\n\nlocation information (CSLI) about the phone\u2019s usage.7 The court\n\n\n\n\n      7. When a cell phone is in use, it connects \u201cto a set of radio\nantennas called \u2018cell sites,\u2019 \u201d which \u201ctypically have several\ndirectional antennas that divide the covered area into sectors.\u201d\nCarpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2211 (2018). Each\ntime a cell phone connects to one of these cell sites, \u201cit generates a\ntime-stamped record\u201d that constitutes CSLI. Id. In this case, as the\nintelligence analyst testified at trial, the historical CSLI allowed\ninvestigators to determine \u201ca geographical area that the device\ncould have been in\u201d at the time of an incoming or outgoing phone\n\n                                - 11 -\n\facknowledged receipt of the letter before jury selection began, and\n\nlater that same day asked Figueroa-Sanabria if he had any\n\nquestions or concerns that it could address. At that point, however,\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria did not mention any issue with Hammond, and\n\nhe did not again raise an issue with Hammond\u2019s representation\n\nthroughout the rest of the trial.\n\n     Figueroa-Sanabria, though, did ask the court about certain\n\nevidentiary issues, including the State\u2019s acquisition of historical\n\nCSLI. Figueroa-Sanabria argued that the State\u2019s warrantless\n\nacquisition of five days\u2019 worth of CSLI, which the State planned to\n\nuse in establishing Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s whereabouts on the dates\n\nrelevant to the murders, violated the Fourth Amendment. 8\n\n     In response, the State told the court that it went through all of\n\nthe normal procedures for acquiring the evidence and had the\n\n\n\ncall. It provides nothing further, however, such as a precise GPS\nlocation of the device.\n\n     8. Five years after the historical CSLI was acquired in this\ncase, but before trial, the United States Supreme Court concluded\nin Carpenter that the acquisition of seven days of historical CSLI\nconstituted a search under the Fourth Amendment, and as such,\nhad to be supported by a warrant issued upon probable cause. 138\nS. Ct. at 2217 n.3.\n\n\n                                    - 12 -\n\fdocumentation to prove it. 9 After hearing this, the trial court did\n\nnot rule on the admissibility of the evidence in light of the Fourth\n\nAmendment. Instead, the court only provided that the acquisition\n\nof the historical CSLI would \u201ccertainly be part of the appellate\n\nissues that [Figueroa-Sanabria] would be contesting\u201d if he was\n\nconvicted. The record does not reflect any further objection when\n\nthe historical CSLI evidence was admitted at trial.\n\n     During the two-week trial that finally began on October 8,\n\n2019, the jury heard from the officers who conducted the\n\ninvestigation. They heard from those with whom Figueroa-Sanabria\n\nhad interacted during the morning of April 12, such as the staff\n\nmember at the jewelry store that purchased the necklace and\n\nbracelet, and the owner of the rental car business who rented\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria the vehicle. The jury also heard from Cooper,\n\nwho testified about what had happened after she picked up\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria on the morning after the murders, and the\n\ngirlfriend of Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s brother, who testified about\n\n\n\n\n     9. The State later produced the subpoena used to acquire the\nhistorical CSLI.\n\n\n                                - 13 -\n\freceiving the jewelry in the mail. The State additionally called the\n\nmedical examiner, who informed the jury that the cause of death for\n\nboth victims was multiple sharp-force injuries and the manner of\n\ndeath for both was homicide.\n\n     The jury heard from an intelligence analyst who had mapped\n\nout the general positioning of Figueroa-Sanabria and Cooper on\n\nApril 11 and 12 using the historical CSLI acquired from Figueroa-\n\nSanabria\u2019s and Cooper\u2019s service providers. The CSLI evidence\n\nrevealed that, when Figueroa-Sanabria and Cooper spoke at 4:15\n\na.m. and 4:16 a.m., his phone used an antenna south of the one it\n\nnormally used when he was at the marina or his apartment.\n\nHowever, the analyst also testified that the southern antenna\n\nsometimes provides the strongest signal for a phone at the marina.\n\n     In contrast, the analyst testified that Cooper\u2019s phone used one\n\nantenna, at the same longitude and latitude, throughout the night\n\nof the 11th and into the morning of the 12th when she\n\ncommunicated with Figueroa-Sanabria at 4:15 a.m. and 4:16 a.m.\n\nThis antenna covered the area where both the marina and the\n\ncouple\u2019s apartment were located.\n\n\n\n\n                                - 14 -\n\f     A DNA analyst also took the stand. The analyst testified that\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria\u2019s DNA was found, within a reasonable degree of\n\nscientific certainty, on both a roll of duct tape and a wad of duct\n\ntape left at the scene. As the jury learned from a trace materials\n\nanalyst who also testified, the duct tape used to restrain both\n\nvictims came from this roll. As for the white shirt found in the\n\ndumpster, the DNA analyst testified that the blood from the cuff\n\narea of the right sleeve matched Morin\u2019s DNA within a reasonable\n\ndegree of scientific certainty, and testing of blood on the collar\n\nrevealed that Travlos\u2019s DNA was a major contributor. As for the\n\njeans, testing of blood in three areas revealed the presence of\n\nTravlos\u2019s DNA within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, and\n\ntesting of blood on another area of the jeans revealed the presence\n\nof Morin\u2019s DNA within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. 10\n\nThe analyst also conducted testing on carpet clippings from the\n\n\n\n\n     10. The analyst performed additional DNA tests on different\nareas of the white and gray shirts, the jeans, and the belt, but the\nresults were largely inconclusive as to the presence of the DNA of\nFigueroa-Sanabria and Cooper.\n\n\n                                 - 15 -\n\ffront passenger side of Cooper\u2019s van, which revealed the presence of\n\nTravlos\u2019s DNA within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\n\n     After the State rested, Hammond called only one witness:\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria. He testified that he awoke around 4:00 a.m. on\n\nApril 12 to find that Cooper was gone. He said he called her, and\n\nshe told him that she had gone to get cigarettes. When she\n\nreturned, according to Figueroa-Sanabria, she asked him to drive\n\nher to an addiction treatment center. On the way to the treatment\n\ncenter, he said, Cooper asked him to stop at a gas station and\n\nvacuum out her van. She also, he said, asked him to throw away a\n\ngrocery bag in the dumpster, which he did.\n\n     Figueroa-Sanabria testified that Cooper was the source of the\n\njewelry-filled backpack, which, he said, she gave him to make up for\n\nher selling his vehicle while he served a stint in prison. Figueroa-\n\nSanabria testified that he decided to sell some of the jewelry, which\n\nhe did at a jewelry store. Figueroa-Sanabria said that he gave\n\nCooper most of the money earned from selling the jewelry, and that\n\nhe promised her the proceeds from future sales. Figueroa-Sanabria\n\nsaid that he eventually rented a car, planning to visit his brother in\n\nNew York, who would help him sell the rest of the jewelry. On the\n\n\n                                - 16 -\n\fway to New York, Figueroa-Sanabria shipped the jewelry to his\n\nbrother.\n\n     On October 23, the jury returned guilty verdicts for both first-\n\ndegree murder charges.\n\n                                   C\n\n     The matter proceeded to the penalty phase. At a hearing on\n\nOctober 28, Daniel Hernandez, who had at that point taken over as\n\ncounsel, told the court that Figueroa-Sanabria did \u201cnot wish\n\nmitigation to be presented.\u201d The court asked Figueroa-Sanabria if\n\nthose were in fact his wishes. He responded that he did not want\n\nhis friends and family to \u201cbeg for life\u201d to the jury on his behalf.\n\nHernandez said he \u201cobviously . . . was not seeking to do something\n\nagainst [Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s] wishes,\u201d but he \u201csuspected that the\n\nCourt would require [him] to do so.\u201d After failing to convince\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria that he should present mitigation, the court said\n\nthat if Hernandez \u201cwants to call [mitigation witnesses],\u201d then the\n\ncourt is \u201cgoing to let him call them so that they can do what\u2019s\n\nnecessary.\u201d Figueroa-Sanabria responded by stating that if the\n\ncourt is \u201cgoing to let [Hernandez] do it, then [he] would like to\n\n\n\n\n                                 - 17 -\n\fdismiss [Hernandez]\u201d and represent himself. The court made this\n\neffort to confirm Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s decision:\n\n     THE COURT: Okay. So, Mr. Sanabria, are you telling me\n     that not only you don\u2019t want your family members to\n     testify on your behalf, but you also don\u2019t want the\n     doctors to testify on your behalf[?] Is that what you\u2019re\n     saying?\n     THE DEFENDANT: Yeah, I don\u2019t.\n     THE COURT: You want nothing presented on your\n     behalf? And for the record he\u2019s shaking his head. Now\n     he doesn\u2019t want anything.\n     THE DEFENDANT: No, your Honor. I\u2019m sorry. No.\n     THE COURT: Now you\u2019re saying you\u2019re willing to\n     represent yourself. If I\u2019m going to order Mr. Hernandez to\n     present things on your behalf, you\u2019ll represent yourself so\n     that you won\u2019t have to present anything because I may\n     have to order Mr. Hernandez to present things on your\n     behalf?\n     THE DEFENDANT: That\u2019s what I say, your Honor, yes.\n\n     After taking a short break, the court told Figueroa-Sanabria\n\nthat it could not have defense counsel \u201cgo forward representing\n\n[him] not presenting . . . any mitigation,\u201d and so \u201cif [Hernandez]\n\nrepresents [Figueroa-Sanabria], he\u2019s going to present mitigation on\n\n[Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s] behalf.\u201d The colloquy concluded this way:\n\n     THE COURT: With that in mind do you want to represent\n     yourself or do you want to let Mr. Hernandez present the\n     mitigation against your wishes?\n     THE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t want no mitigation.\n     THE COURT: Okay. So you want to represent yourself\n     and not put on any mitigation?\n     THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your Honor.\n\n\n                                - 18 -\n\f     After a court-appointed expert witness testified that Figueroa-\n\nSanabria was competent to make the decision to waive mitigation\n\nand represent himself, the court held a Faretta 11 hearing. At this\n\nhearing, the court inquired into Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s knowledge of\n\nthe relevant law and procedural rules, reminded Figueroa-Sanabria\n\nof the difficulties of self-representation, and told Figueroa-Sanabria\n\nthat he would not have much time to prepare before the penalty\n\nphase started. The trial court also ensured that Figueroa-Sanabria\n\nunderstood that the maximum penalty he could receive was death\n\nand told him that he would have a much better chance to receive a\n\nsentence of life if he was represented by counsel. Figueroa-\n\nSanabria still chose to proceed pro se.\n\n     Before accepting Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s waiver, the trial court\n\nasked Hernandez if there was any lawful reason that the court\n\nshould not accept Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s decision, and Hernandez\n\nresponded that there was not. After Hernandez summarized the\n\n\n\n      11. Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975) (concluding that\na defendant has a constitutional right to proceed without counsel in\na state criminal trial as long as he knowingly, intelligently, and\nvoluntarily chooses to do so).\n\n\n                                - 19 -\n\fmitigation evidence he planned to present, the court accepted\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria\u2019s waiver and appointed Hernandez as standby\n\ncounsel.\n\n     During the penalty phase, the State presented one expert\n\nwitness\u2014who testified to the physical and medical condition of the\n\nvictims\u2014and victim impact testimony. Figueroa-Sanabria did not\n\npresent mitigation evidence, nor did he provide an opening\n\nstatement or closing argument. After the State\u2019s closing argument,\n\nthe trial court instructed the jury on its duties, and deliberations\n\nbegan.\n\n     An hour in, the jury returned with questions about the verdict\n\nform, and Hernandez offered to provide some assistance. After the\n\ncourt assured Figueroa-Sanabria that the reinstatement of\n\nHernandez would not affect his waiver of mitigation, Figueroa-\n\nSanabria agreed to allow Hernandez to represent him again.\n\n     Following deliberations, the jury unanimously found five\n\naggravating factors and unanimously recommended sentences of\n\ndeath. After a series of Spencer 12 hearings at which both sides\n\n\n\n     12. Spencer v. State, 615 So. 2d 688 (Fla. 1993) (setting out a\nprocedure that affords both the State and the defendant an\n\n                                - 20 -\n\fpresented evidence on, among other things, whether Figueroa-\n\nSanabria was cognitively impaired, the trial court sentenced\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria to death for each murder. This appeal follows.\n\n                                  II\n\n                                  A\n\n     Figueroa-Sanabria argues that two errors committed during\n\nthe guilt phase require us to set aside his convictions. First,\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria argues that the trial court erred in refusing,\n\nmore than once, to appoint new counsel before the start of the guilt\n\nphase. Second, Figueroa-Sanabria argues that the trial court erred\n\nin admitting historical CSLI that had been acquired without a\n\nwarrant, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Neither alleged\n\nerror justifies reversing Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s convictions. And\n\nbecause, after a review of the record, we find that Figueroa-\n\nSanabria\u2019s convictions are supported by competent, substantial\n\nevidence, we affirm them.\n\n\n\n\nopportunity to be heard and present additional evidence to the trial\ncourt before it decides whether to impose a death sentence).\n\n\n                                - 21 -\n\f                                   1\n\n     As to the first issue, Figueroa-Sanabria argues that the trial\n\ncourt erred in refusing to dismiss Hammond from the case and\n\nappoint substitute counsel.13 We review a \u201ctrial court\u2019s decision\n\ninvolving withdrawal or discharge of counsel . . . for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\u201d Guardado v. State, 965 So. 2d 108, 113 (Fla. 2007).\n\nDiscretion is abused only when no reasonable person \u201cwould take\n\nthe view adopted by the trial court.\u201d Canakaris v. Canakaris, 382\n\n\n\n\n      13. Figueroa-Sanabria argues that the trial court violated the\nSixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which\nguarantees him \u201cthe Assistance of Counsel for his defence,\u201d amend.\nVI, U.S. Const., when it denied his motions to dismiss Hammond\nand appoint substitute counsel after it became apparent that the\nrelationship between Figueroa-Sanabria and Hammond had\n\u201ccompletely collapsed.\u201d But the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected\nthe claim \u201cthat the Sixth Amendment guarantees a \u2018meaningful\nrelationship\u2019 between an accused and his counsel.\u201d Morris v.\nSlappy, 461 U.S. 1, 14 (1983). Instead, the Sixth Amendment only\nguarantees \u201cthe right to effective assistance of counsel at all critical\nstages of a criminal prosecution.\u201d Taylor v. State, 87 So. 3d 749,\n758 (Fla. 2012). Recognizing that our cases generally leave\nineffective assistance arguments for postconviction proceedings, see\nSteiger v. State, 328 So. 3d 926 (Fla. 2021), Figueroa-Sanabria does\nnot now argue that Hammond was ineffective. Because of this, we\ndecline to consider Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s Sixth Amendment\narguments related to Hammond.\n\n\n                                 - 22 -\n\fSo. 2d 1197, 1203 (Fla. 1980) (quoting Delno v. Mkt. St. Ry. Co., 124\n\nF.2d 965, 967 (9th Cir. 1942)). Here, we cannot say that.\n\n     In reviewing the trial court\u2019s refusal to discharge defense\n\ncounsel and appoint a new one, we are mindful \u201cthat an indigent\n\ndefendant has no right to choose a particular court-appointed\n\nattorney.\u201d Weaver v. State, 894 So. 2d 178, 187 (Fla. 2004). Thus,\n\n\u201cif a trial court decides that court-appointed counsel is providing\n\nadequate representation, the court does not violate an indigent\n\ndefendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights if it requires him to keep the\n\noriginal court-appointed lawyer or represent himself.\u201d Id. at 188.\n\nThis makes sense given the \u201cessential aim\u201d of the Assistance of\n\nCounsel Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which is \u201cto guarantee an\n\neffective advocate for each criminal defendant rather than to ensure\n\nthat a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom\n\nhe prefers.\u201d Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159 (1988).\n\n     In past cases we have concluded that a \u201clack of\n\ncommunication is not a ground for an incompetency claim.\u201d\n\nMorrison v. State, 818 So. 2d 432, 440-41 (Fla. 2002); see, e.g.,\n\nGlover v. State, 226 So. 3d 795, 807-08 (Fla. 2017); Davis v. State,\n\n136 So. 3d 1169, 1209 (Fla. 2014); Guardado, 965 So. 2d at 115.\n\n\n                                - 23 -\n\fWe also have rejected claims based on a defendant\u2019s \u201cdispleasure\n\nwith counsel\u2019s refusal to provide copies of legal documents and\n\nefforts in contacting witnesses,\u201d and a defendant\u2019s \u201ccomplaints\n\nabout his attorney\u2019s trial preparation, witness development, and\n\ntrial strategy.\u201d Morrison, 818 So. 2d at 441; see Sexton v. State, 775\n\nSo. 2d 923, 930-31 (Fla. 2000). It is also our settled law that\n\ngeneralized grievances concerning these issues do not provide cause\n\nfor a Nelson 14 hearing. See, e.g., Morrison, 818 So. 2d at 441;\n\nGuardado, 965 So. 2d at 115.\n\n     Here, Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s concerns with Hammond boil down\n\nto two issues: a lack of communication and a lack of progress in\n\npreparing for trial. Neither supplies a basis for the relief he seeks.\n\nThe trial court convened multiple Nelson hearings to consider\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria\u2019s grievances. The court inquired into\n\nHammond\u2019s ability to handle the case and Hammond\u2019s stated\n\n\n\n\n      14. Nelson v. State, 274 So. 2d 256, 258 (Fla. 4th DCA 1973)\n(\u201c[W]here a defendant, before the commencement of trial, makes it\nappear to the trial judge that he desires to discharge his court\nappointed counsel, the trial judge, in order to protect the indigent\u2019s\nright to effective counsel, should make an inquiry of the defendant\nas to the reason for the request to discharge.\u201d).\n\n\n                                 - 24 -\n\fconcerns about his relationship with Figueroa-Sanabria. We find\n\nthe court conducted \u201csufficient inquiry to determine whether there\n\nwas reasonable cause to believe that counsel was not rendering\n\neffective assistance.\u201d Morrison, 818 So. 2d at 442.\n\n     The court also continually tracked Hammond\u2019s progress on a\n\nlist prepared by Figueroa-Sanabria enumerating issues he wanted\n\naddressed before trial. And, throughout trial, the court repeatedly\n\nasked Figueroa-Sanabria if he had any questions or concerns that\n\ncould be addressed; not once during these colloquies did Figueroa-\n\nSanabria object to Hammond\u2019s preparation or representation.\n\n     On the record before us, we cannot say the trial court\n\ninadequately addressed Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s concerns; to the\n\ncontrary, the three separate judges who considered Figueroa-\n\nSanabria\u2019s motions each reasonably concluded that he failed to\n\nassert a sufficient basis for replacing Hammond. Figueroa-\n\nSanabria has therefore failed to show that the court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his motions to substitute counsel, and he is\n\nnot entitled to a new guilt phase on this basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                - 25 -\n\f                                   2\n\n     Figueroa-Sanabria next argues that the trial court reversibly\n\nerred when it refused to exclude historical CSLI obtained without a\n\nwarrant. First, however, we must decide whether this question is\n\npreserved for our review.\n\n     We have stated that \u201cno magic words are required to make a\n\nproper objection.\u201d Aills v. Boemi, 29 So. 3d 1105, 1109 (Fla.\n\n2010). An issue is preserved when it is \u201ctimely raised before, and\n\nruled on by, the trial court\u201d and was in its presentation \u201csufficiently\n\nprecise that it fairly apprised the trial court of the relief sought and\n\nthe grounds therefor.\u201d \u00a7 924.051(1)(b), Fla. Stat. The argument on\n\nappeal \u201cmust be the specific contention asserted as legal ground for\n\nthe objection, exception, or motion below.\u201d Steinhorst v. State, 412\n\nSo. 2d 332, 338 (Fla. 1982).\n\n     In a hearing after the first day of jury selection, Figueroa-\n\nSanabria questioned the legality of the State\u2019s warrantless\n\nacquisition of historical CSLI given the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s\n\ndecision in Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2217, which, in Figueroa-\n\nSanabria\u2019s words, provided that the State \u201cneed[ed] a search\n\nwarrant for cellular call logs, towers, and everything.\u201d The court\n\n\n                                 - 26 -\n\ftold Figueroa-Sanabria that if the State could not show that it went\n\nthrough the procedural steps required to obtain the historical CSLI\n\nand Figueroa-Sanabria was convicted, then the acquisition of the\n\nhistorical CSLI would \u201ccertainly be part of the appellate issues that\n\n[he] would be contesting.\u201d 15\n\n     While this interaction cannot be said to have conclusively and\n\nclearly preserved the issue for our review, Figueroa-Sanabria did\n\nput \u201cthe trial judge on notice that error may have been committed,\u201d\n\nCastor v. State, 365 So. 2d 701, 703 (Fla. 1978), and we decline, on\n\nthese facts, to penalize Figueroa-Sanabria for proceeding in\n\naccordance with the trial judge\u2019s statement about the preservation\n\nof the issue for appeal. We thus proceed on the assumption that\n\nthis issue was preserved.\n\n     Next, while we normally would address whether the State\u2019s\n\nacquisition of Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s historical CSLI was a warrantless\n\n\n\n\n     15. The court also said that \u201cif a mistake was made . . . then\ncertainly your appellate lawyer will look into it because Mr.\nHammond has preserved that for appeal.\u201d Hammond did file a\nmotion to suppress, which was denied, but that motion only sought\nto suppress evidence garnered from Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s cell phone\nbefore the acquisition of a warrant, not the historical CSLI.\n\n\n                                - 27 -\n\fFourth Amendment search, and if so, whether the exclusionary rule\n\napplies, we need not reach these issues to resolve this case. That is\n\nbecause the allegedly erroneous introduction of the CSLI evidence is\n\nharmless.16\n\n     A trial court\u2019s error in admitting evidence obtained from an\n\nunconstitutional search is subject to harmless error analysis.\n\nSmallwood v. State, 113 So. 3d 724, 739 (Fla. 2013); see \u00a7 924.33,\n\nFla. Stat. \u201cThe harmless error test . . . places the burden on the\n\nstate, as the beneficiary of the error, to prove beyond a reasonable\n\n\n\n      16. When the State acquires evidence as the result of a\nconstitutionally unreasonable search, the exclusionary rule may\nbar its admission. The exclusionary rule is a prudential doctrine\ncreated by the U.S. Supreme Court to \u201ccompel respect for the\nconstitutional guaranty\u201d found in the Fourth Amendment, Davis v.\nUnited States, 564 U.S. 229, 236 (2011) (quoting Elkins v. United\nStates, 364 U.S. 206, 217 (1960)), by deterring \u201cdeliberate police\nmisconduct,\u201d Rodriguez v. State, 187 So. 3d 841, 845 (Fla. 2015).\nThe U.S. Supreme Court, however, has provided that the\nexclusionary rule does not apply when \u201cthe police conduct a search\nin objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent.\u201d\nDavis, 564 U.S. at 249-50. Although we do not reach the\napplicability of the good-faith exception, we note that, when the\nState acquired the historical CSLI in this case, binding precedent\nprovided that the acquisition of such data was not a \u201csearch\u201d under\nthe Fourth Amendment\u2014meaning a warrant was not\nconstitutionally required. See Mitchell v. State, 25 So. 3d 632, 635\n(Fla. 4th DCA 2009); Johnson v. State, 110 So. 3d 954, 958 (Fla. 4th\nDCA 2013).\n\n\n                                - 28 -\n\fdoubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict\n\nor, alternatively stated, that there is no reasonable possibility that\n\nthe error contributed to the conviction.\u201d State v. DiGuilio, 491 So.\n\n2d 1129, 1135 (Fla. 1986). The test is focused \u201con the effect of the\n\nerror on the trier-of-fact\u201d and is not a \u201csufficiency-of-the-evidence, a\n\ncorrect result, a not clearly wrong, a substantial evidence, a more\n\nprobable than not, a clear and convincing, or even an overwhelming\n\nevidence test.\u201d Id. at 1139.\n\n     Although the CSLI evidence is indeed inculpatory and was a\n\npart of the State\u2019s case, after \u201can examination of the entire\n\nrecord . . . including a close examination of the permissible evidence\n\non which the jury could have legitimately relied, and in addition an\n\neven closer examination of the impermissible evidence which might\n\nhave possibly influenced the jury verdict,\u201d id. at 1135, we conclude\n\nthe State has met its burden here. The CSLI evidence \u201cwas merely\n\ncumulative.\u201d Odom v. State, 403 So. 2d 936, 940 (Fla. 1981).\n\n     We start with the other evidence inculpating Figueroa-\n\nSanabria. It is \u201cclearly conclusive.\u201d DiGuilio, 491 So. 2d at 1138.\n\nThe State presented evidence that the two victims died on their\n\nhouseboat after suffering multiple stab wounds, and that jewelry\n\n\n                                 - 29 -\n\fvalued at over $80,000 was stolen from the houseboat. There were\n\nno signs of a forced entry, and it was established that Figueroa-\n\nSanabria was often given a key to the houseboat. Figueroa-\n\nSanabria\u2019s DNA was present on both a roll and wad of duct tape left\n\nat the scene. Testimony revealed that the duct tape used to\n\nrestrain the victims came from this roll. Both victims\u2019 DNA was\n\nfound on discarded clothes that Cooper identified as Figueroa-\n\nSanabria\u2019s, and Travlos\u2019s DNA was found on the carpet of the front\n\npassenger seat of the van in which Figueroa-Sanabria sat in the\n\nhours after the murders. Cooper recalled seeing Figueroa-Sanabria\n\nholding a knife that morning as they drove around with a backpack\n\nfull of the victims\u2019 jewelry\u2014some of which Figueroa-Sanabria sold\n\nbefore mailing the rest to his brother.\n\n     What is more, Figueroa-Sanabria elected to take the stand.\n\nWhen a defendant testifies on his version of events, the jury is \u201cfree\n\nto reject [his] version of events as unreasonable,\u201d Finney v. State,\n\n660 So. 2d 674, 680 (Fla. 1995), and in turn may view this\n\ntestimony as \u201cevidence of a guilty mind.\u201d Jackson v. State, 347 So.\n\n3d 292, 307 (Fla. 2022); see also United States v. Allison, 908 F.2d\n\n1531, 1535 (11th Cir. 1990) (\u201cThe jury may view defendant\u2019s false\n\n\n                                - 30 -\n\fexplanatory statement as substantive evidence proving guilt.\u201d).\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria testified that he received the jewelry from\n\nCooper. This contradicted what he told investigators, which was\n\nthat he had owned the jewelry for a while. Figueroa-Sanabria also\n\ndid not explain why his DNA was left at the scene, why Cooper\u2019s\n\nDNA was not, and why Cooper would murder Travlos and Morin\n\nonly to give Figueroa-Sanabria the jewelry. The jury was free to\n\nreject Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s version of the events in light of all this,\n\nand it did.\n\n     As for the allegedly impermissible evidence, the jury heard\n\nfrom an intelligence analyst who, with Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s\n\nhistorical CSLI, placed Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s cell phone at a location\n\nsouth of the couple\u2019s apartment when he called Cooper early on the\n\nmorning of the 12th. The State used this evidence to argue that\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria was near the houseboat at the time of the crimes\n\nand to rebut his argument that Cooper was the one who committed\n\nthe crimes. But there \u201cwas additional substantial, reliable and\n\nadmissible evidence\u201d on both these points, Hayward v. State, 24 So.\n\n3d 17, 34 (Fla. 2009), as revised on denial of reh\u2019g (Dec. 10, 2009),\n\nincluding the DNA evidence that placed Figueroa-Sanabria, not\n\n\n                                 - 31 -\n\fCooper, at the scene rather than in its vicinity. 17 This supports the\n\nconclusion that the admission of the historical CSLI was harmless.\n\nSee Hojan v. State, 3 So. 3d 1204, 1210 (Fla. 2009) (\u201cThis Court has\n\nheld that where the evidence introduced in error was not the only\n\nevidence on the issue to which the improper evidence related, the\n\nintroduction can be harmless.\u201d).\n\n     Our conclusion about the harmlessness of any error regarding\n\nthe admission of Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s historical CSLI evidence finds\n\nample support in our cases. For example, in Jeffries v. State, we\n\nconcluded that the trial court erred in admitting the defendant\u2019s\n\nshoes seized after an illegal arrest. 797 So. 2d 573, 577 (Fla. 2001).\n\nThe jury learned that a shoe print at the crime scene was left by the\n\nsame type of shoes as the defendant\u2019s. Id. at 579. Even with this\n\nconnection, we concluded that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless.\n\nId. The expert that testified at trial was unable to conclusively\n\ndetermine that the shoe print was made by the defendant\u2019s shoes.\n\n\n\n\n     17. The historical CSLI for Cooper\u2019s phone placed it in a\nsector that included both the apartment and the marina. Thus,\nwhile it does support Cooper\u2019s testimony, it also does not\ncompletely rule out Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s version of events.\n\n\n                                - 32 -\n\fId. And the State presented other, more inculpatory evidence:\n\ntestimony from the defendant\u2019s siblings, who overheard the\n\ndefendant talk about his plans to commit the crimes, expert\n\ntestimony linking the defendant to a fingerprint left at the scene,\n\nand a stipulation from both parties that the defendant pawned the\n\nvictim\u2019s jewelry shortly after the murder. Id. at 578-79.\n\n     In another case, Saavedra v. State, we had to determine\n\nwhether a trial court had erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to\n\nsuppress evidence obtained from his home after the police entered\n\nwithout a warrant and arrested him. 622 So. 2d 952, 956 (Fla.\n\n1993). While we found that the police officers\u2019 initial entry into the\n\nhome was not supported by third-party consent, we did not proceed\n\nto determine whether exigent circumstances were present to\n\nsupport the entry, or if the defendant\u2019s subsequent consent to\n\nsearch was tainted by his warrantless arrest. Id. at 959. Instead,\n\nwe assumed officers had entered without exigent circumstances\n\nand that the later consent was tainted, and we proceeded to\n\nconduct a harmless error review. Id. We found the trial court\u2019s\n\nerror to be harmless, even though the search led to the recovery of\n\ntwo pairs of black pants and a hood, which is what the defendants\n\n\n                                - 33 -\n\fallegedly wore when they sexually assaulted the victim. Id. at 955.\n\nThis was because the verdict was strongly supported by the victim\u2019s\n\nin-court identification of both defendants as her attackers, and\n\nother testimony that both corroborated the victim\u2019s testimony about\n\nher injuries and tied the semen found on the victim\u2019s body to both\n\ndefendants. Id. at 959.\n\n     As in these cases, here, too, the State is correct that there is\n\nno reasonable possibility that the allegedly erroneous admission of\n\nthe evidence at issue contributed to the convictions. See DiGuilio,\n\n491 So. 2d at 1135. Figueroa-Sanabria is therefore not entitled to a\n\nnew guilt phase because of the trial court\u2019s admission of the\n\nhistorical CSLI.\n\n                                   3\n\n     Even when the defendant does not contest the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence at trial, we have \u201can independent obligation to review\n\nthe record for sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d Blake v. State, 972 So.\n\n2d 839, 850 (Fla. 2007). \u201c[T]he concern on appeal must be whether,\n\nafter all conflicts in the evidence and all reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom have been resolved in favor of the verdict on appeal, there\n\nis substantial, competent evidence to support the verdict and\n\n\n                                - 34 -\n\fjudgment.\u201d Tibbs v. State, 397 So. 2d 1120, 1123 (Fla. 1981).\n\nImportant to this case, a \u201cgeneral guilty verdict rendered by a jury\n\ninstructed on both first-degree murder alternatives may be upheld\n\non appeal where the evidence is sufficient to establish either felony\n\nmurder or premeditation.\u201d Crain v. State, 894 So. 2d 59, 73 (Fla.\n\n2004). 18\n\n     The jury heard sufficient evidence of Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s guilt:\n\nthe absence of forced entry on the houseboat and his frequent\n\npossession of a key to it; the DNA evidence on the duct tape at the\n\ncrime scene and on his clothes; the knife on his lap and stolen\n\njewelry in his backpack; his statement to investigators about how\n\nlong he had the jewelry, which conflicted with his own later\n\ntestimony; and the cumulative falsehood of that testimony, which\n\n\n\n\n      18. The three elements of premeditated first-degree murder\nare: (1) the victim is dead; (2) the death was caused by the criminal\nact of the defendant; and (3) there was a premeditated killing of the\nvictim. See Fla. Std. Jury Instr. (Crim.) 7.2; \u00a7 782.04(1)(a)1., Fla.\nStat. The three elements of felony murder as it pertains to this case\nare: (1) the victim is dead; (2) while engaged in the commission of a\nrobbery and/or burglary, the defendant caused the death of the\nvictim; and (3) the defendant was the person who actually killed the\nvictim. See Fla. Std. Jury Instr. (Crim.) 7.3; \u00a7 782.04(1)(a)2., Fla.\nStat.\n\n\n                                - 35 -\n\fthe jury chose to reject. We conclude that \u201ca rational trier of fact\n\ncould have found the existence of the elements of the crime beyond\n\na reasonable doubt,\u201d Bradley v. State, 787 So. 2d 732, 738 (Fla.\n\n2001), and thus affirm Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s convictions.\n\n                                  B\n\n     We now turn to the penalty phase. While Figueroa-Sanabria\n\nasserts that the trial court committed multiple errors during this\n\nphase, we need reach only one. The trial court\u2019s erroneous\n\nacceptance of Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s invalid waiver of his right to the\n\nassistance of counsel, and counsel\u2019s subsequent absence for nearly\n\nthe entire penalty phase, entitles Figueroa-Sanabria to a new\n\npenalty phase.\n\n                                   1\n\n     The parties disagree about whether Figueroa-Sanabria needed\n\nto preserve his argument concerning the trial court\u2019s acceptance of\n\nhis waiver and counsel\u2019s subsequent absence. If an issue is\n\npreserved, we apply either the harmless error test or per se\n\nreversible error rule,19 Johnson v. State, 53 So. 3d 1003, 1007 (Fla.\n\n\n\n     19. Again, an error is harmless if \u201cthere is no reasonable\npossibility that the error contributed to the conviction.\u201d DiGuilio,\n\n                                - 36 -\n\f2010), as revised on denial of reh\u2019g (Jan. 27, 2011), and if it is not,\n\nwe review only for fundamental error, F.B. v. State, 852 So. 2d 226,\n\n229 (Fla. 2003). Here, though, because we conclude that the\n\ndeprivation of counsel constitutes fundamental error, we need not\n\nanswer the preservation question, as Figueroa-Sanabria is entitled\n\nto a new penalty phase whether or not he properly preserved this\n\nissue.\n\n                                   2\n\n     \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the\n\nright . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d\n\nAmend. VI, U.S. Const. The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted\n\nthe Sixth Amendment to secure the right to appointed counsel for a\n\ndefendant in federal court, Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 462-63\n\n(1938), and the Fourteenth Amendment to extend this right to state\n\ncriminal proceedings, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344\n\n(1963). 20 The right to appointed counsel applies in the penalty\n\n\n\n491 So. 2d at 1135. An error is per se reversible if it is \u201cso basic to\na fair trial\u201d that it \u201ccan never be treated as harmless error.\u201d Id.\n(quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 23 (1967)).\n\n      20. In Traylor v. State, we concluded that sections 2 and 16 of\narticle I of the Florida Constitution combined to produce the\n\n                                 - 37 -\n\fphase. See Muehleman v. State, 3 So. 3d 1149, 1156-57 (Fla.\n\n2009); Harris v. Dugger, 874 F.2d 756, 762 (11th Cir. 1989).\n\n     Even if defendants exercise this right to appointed counsel,\n\n\u201call competent defendants have a right to control their own\n\ndestinies.\u201d Hamblen v. State, 527 So. 2d 800, 804 (Fla. 1988); see\n\nMartinez v. Court of Appeal of Cal., Fourth App. Dist., 528 U.S. 152,\n\n165 (2000) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cOur system of laws\n\ngenerally presumes that the criminal defendant, after being fully\n\ninformed, knows his own best interests and does not need them\n\ndictated by the State.\u201d). This means that \u201c[b]y exercising his\n\nconstitutional right to the assistance of counsel, a defendant does\n\nnot relinquish his right to set the parameters of that\n\nrepresentation.\u201d United States v. Teague, 953 F.2d 1525, 1533\n\n(11th Cir. 1992).\n\n     In line with this principle, our case law \u201caffords competent\n\ncapital defendants \u2018great control over the objectives and content of\n\n\n\nconstitutional right to appointed counsel. 596 So. 2d 957, 969 (Fla.\n1992). This right extends to each crucial stage, which is \u201cany stage\nthat may significantly affect the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d Id. at\n968. In most cases, indigent defendants are also entitled to counsel\nby statute. See \u00a7 27.40, Fla. Stat.; \u00a7 27.51, Fla. Stat.\n\n\n                                - 38 -\n\f[their] mitigation.\u2019 \u201d Bell v. State, 336 So. 3d 211, 217 (Fla. 2022)\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting Boyd v. State, 910 So. 2d 167, 189\n\n(Fla. 2005)). Therefore, \u201cregardless of \u2018[w]hether [the] defendant is\n\nrepresented by counsel or is proceeding pro se, the defendant has\n\nthe right to choose what evidence, if any, the defense will present\n\nduring the penalty phase.\u2019 \u201d Id. (alterations in original) (quoting\n\nBoyd, 910 So. 2d at 189-90); see also Hojan, 3 So. 3d at 1211; Farr\n\nv. State, 656 So. 2d 448, 449 (Fla. 1995). Put plainly, \u201ca defendant\n\ncannot be forced to present mitigating evidence during the penalty\n\nphase of the trial.\u201d Grim v. State, 841 So. 2d 455, 461 (Fla. 2003).\n\n     Here, however, the trial court informed Figueroa-Sanabria that\n\n\u201cif [Hernandez] represents [Figueroa-Sanabria], he\u2019s going to present\n\nmitigation on [his] behalf,\u201d effectively telling Figueroa-Sanabria that\n\nhis right to the assistance of counsel was conditioned on the\n\npresentation of mitigation. Faced with this choice, one he should\n\nnot have been forced to make, Figueroa-Sanabria decided to\n\nproceed pro se.\n\n     The trial court\u2019s statements call into question Figueroa-\n\nSanabria\u2019s knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to\n\nthe assistance of counsel during the penalty phase. \u201c[W]aivers of\n\n\n                                 - 39 -\n\fcounsel must not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a\n\nknowing and intelligent relinquishment or abandonment of a known\n\nright or privilege.\u201d Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 482 (1981).\n\n\u201c[T]he law ordinarily considers a waiver knowing, intelligent, and\n\nsufficiently aware if the defendant fully understands the nature of\n\nthe right and how it would likely apply in general in the\n\ncircumstances.\u201d United States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622, 629 (2002)\n\n(emphasis omitted). Additionally, \u201c[t]here must be both the capacity\n\nto make an understanding choice and an absence of subverting\n\nfactors so that the choice is clearly free and responsible.\u201d Von\n\nMoltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 729 (1948) (Frankfurter, J., separate\n\nopinion). And \u201ccourts generally will indulge every reasonable\n\npresumption against waiver of this fundamental right.\u201d Traylor,\n\n596 So. 2d at 968. 21\n\n\n\n      21. The U.S. Supreme Court has said that, as a matter of\nfederal constitutional law, \u201cit [is] incumbent upon the State to prove\n\u2018an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or\nprivilege.\u2019 \u201d Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 404 (1977) (quoting\nZerbst, 304 U.S. at 464). Thus, on \u201cdirect appeal, the government\nbears the burden of proving the validity of the waiver.\u201d United\nStates v. Cash, 47 F.3d 1083, 1088 (11th Cir. 1995). We have said\nthat the State bears the burden of proving the validity of a\ndefendant\u2019s waiver in a variety of circumstances, including the\nwaiver of the right to counsel if a defendant confesses after the\n\n                                - 40 -\n\f     Here, we cannot say that Figueroa-Sanabria knowingly and\n\nvoluntarily waived his right to counsel for the penalty phase of his\n\ntrial. While a \u201ccriminal defendant may be asked, in the interest of\n\norderly procedures, to choose between waiver and another course of\n\naction as long as the choice presented to him is not constitutionally\n\noffensive,\u201d Maynard v. Meachum, 545 F.2d 273, 278 (1st Cir. 1976),\n\nit was unconstitutional for the trial court to misinform Figueroa-\n\nSanabria as to the nature of his rights and put him to the specific\n\nchoice he faced: have a lawyer present mitigation, or go it alone.\n\nSee Mora v. State, 814 So. 2d 322 (Fla. 2002) (concluding that the\n\ntrial court committed reversible error by requiring a defendant to\n\nchoose between the right to counsel and the right to forgo\n\nmitigation investigation); Wilson v. State, 12 So. 3d 292 (Fla. 4th\n\n\n\n\nadministration of warnings under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436\n(1966). See, e.g., Ramirez v. State, 739 So. 2d 568, 575 (Fla. 1999).\n\u201cWhere a defendant, without counsel, acquiesces in a trial resulting\nin his conviction and later seeks release by the extraordinary\nremedy of habeas corpus, the burden of proof rests upon him to\nestablish that he did not competently and intelligently waive his\nconstitutional right to assistance of Counsel.\u201d Zerbst, 304 U.S. at\n468-69; see also Mason v. State, 176 So. 2d 76, 78-79 (Fla. 1965)\n(imposing burden on a postconviction petitioner to establish an\ninsufficient waiver of counsel).\n\n\n                                - 41 -\n\fDCA 2009) (same, as to requiring defendant to choose between the\n\nright to counsel and the right to testify); Turner v. State, 851 So. 2d\n\n276 (Fla. 4th DCA 2003) (same, as to requiring defendant to choose\n\nbetween testifying against his will and the court declaring a\n\nmistrial). We cannot say under these circumstances that Figueroa-\n\nSanabria\u2019s waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, meaning\n\nthe trial court erred in accepting it.\n\n     The trial court\u2019s repeated inquiries throughout the penalty\n\nphase as to Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s desire to remain without counsel\n\ndid not cure this error. Even though Figueroa-Sanabria refused to\n\nreinstate counsel each time the trial court asked, he did so almost\n\nassuredly because he remained under the impression that\n\nreinstating counsel would mean the presentation of mitigation\n\nevidence. Consider Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s response when the trial\n\ncourt asked whether he wanted Hernandez reinstated so that\n\nHernandez could offer advice on the verdict form: he said, \u201c[t]hat\n\nwould not interfere in my\u2014\u201d and the trial court responded, \u201c[i]t\n\nwouldn\u2019t change the mitigation issue, no.\u201d\n\n     In sum, a defendant\u2019s choice about whether to waive the right\n\nto present all mitigating evidence \u201cis not altered when the defendant\n\n\n                                 - 42 -\n\fhas counsel.\u201d Boyd, 910 So. 2d at 189. The trial court\u2019s statement\n\nof the law to the contrary, which prompted Figueroa-Sanabria to\n\nwaive his right to counsel, means we cannot conclude that\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria\u2019s waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.\n\n                                  3\n\n     Fundamental errors are few and rare. Smith v. State, 521 So.\n\n2d 106, 108 (Fla. 1988). We have said they are those that\n\n\u201cpermeate or saturate the trial with such basic invalidity as to lead\n\nto a reversal regardless of a timely objection,\u201d Brown v. State, 124\n\nSo. 2d 481, 484 (Fla. 1960), and go to \u201cthe foundation of the case or\n\nthe merits of the cause of action and [are] equivalent to a denial of\n\ndue process,\u201d J.B. v. State, 705 So. 2d 1376, 1378 (Fla. 1998).\n\n     Figueroa-Sanabria has established that the error here\u2014which\n\nleft him without the assistance of counsel for the majority of a\n\npenalty phase proceeding in a death penalty case on the basis of a\n\nwaiver that was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary\u2014qualifies\n\nas fundamental. \u201cFlorida courts, including this Court, have found\n\ndeprivations of counsel to be fundamental error.\u201d Jackson v. State,\n\n983 So. 2d 562, 575 (Fla. 2008). Such cases \u201cgenerally involve\n\ndeprivation of counsel during an entire proceeding.\u201d Id. For\n\n\n                                - 43 -\n\fexample, in Gonzalez v. State, 838 So. 2d 1242, 1243 (Fla. 1st DCA\n\n2003), the First District Court of Appeal found that the complete\n\ndenial of counsel at resentencing constituted a fundamental error,\n\nand we approved that decision. See Jackson, 983 So. 2d at 575.\n\n     Other examples from Florida cases include the complete\n\ndeprivation of counsel during both a juvenile plea hearing and a\n\ndisposition hearing, State v. B.P., 810 So. 2d 918 (Fla. 2002); State\n\nv. T.G., 800 So. 2d 204 (Fla. 2001), a juvenile plea hearing, J.R.V. v.\n\nState, 715 So. 2d 1135 (Fla. 5th DCA 1998), a violation of probation\n\nhearing, Brady v. State, 910 So. 2d 388 (Fla. 2d DCA 2005), and a\n\nviolation of community control hearing, Tyler v. State, 710 So. 2d\n\n645 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998).\n\n     In certain cases involving only a partial deprivation of a\n\ndefendant\u2019s right to the assistance of counsel, Florida courts have\n\napplied our familiar harmless error analysis 22 or found no\n\nfundamental error. See, e.g., Jackson, 983 So. 2d at 577 (finding\n\n\n\n\n      22. Because \u201cfundamental error is not subject to harmless\nerror review,\u201d Reed v. State, 837 So. 2d 366, 369-70 (Fla. 2002),\nthese are all cases in which the absence of counsel did not\nconstitute fundamental error.\n\n\n                                - 44 -\n\fno fundamental error when defense counsel was absent for part of a\n\nvictim impact statement); Thompson v.

State, 500 So. 2d\n\n713 (Fla. 4th DCA 1987) (reviewing for harmless error when defense\n\ncounsel was absent for five minutes after the trial court started\n\nreading the jury instructions); Wilson v. State, 764 So. 2d 813 (Fla.\n\n4th DCA 2000) (reviewing for harmless error when defendant did\n\nnot have the assistance of counsel when the jury asked a question\n\nduring deliberations).\n\n     But here, Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s defense counsel was not absent\n\nfor a brief time or during only part of the victim impact testimony.\n\nCounsel was discharged before the penalty phase began, only to be\n\nreinstated when the jury had questions about the verdict form\n\nduring deliberations, meaning Figueroa-Sanabria was without the\n\nassistance of counsel for nearly all of the penalty phase in front of\n\nthe jury. Figueroa-Sanabria has demonstrated that this deprivation\n\n\u201caffected\u2014and contaminated\u2014the entire criminal proceeding\u201d\n\nthereafter, Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U.S. 249, 257 (1988), and is in\n\n\n\n\n                                - 45 -\n\fthat sense like others we have found to constitute fundamental\n\nerror.\n\n     Even if we assume Hernandez could not have presented\n\nmitigation evidence, his presence could have bolstered Figueroa-\n\nSanabria\u2019s penalty-phase defense in multiple ways. For one,\n\nHernandez could have provided an opening statement, which allows\n\nan attorney to outline what he \u201cexpects to be established by the\n\nevidence.\u201d Occhicone v. State, 570 So. 2d 902, 904 (Fla. 1990).

Cronic,\n\n466 U.S. 648, 656 (1984). He could have provided closing\n\nargument. Given that \u201cone of the most important functions of the\n\ncapital sentencing process is the opportunity to humanize the\n\ndefendant, the importance of the defense\u2019s closing argument\n\ncannot . . . be overstated.\u201d Lawhorn v. Allen, 519 F.3d 1272, 1296\n\n(11th Cir. 2008).

Here,\n\nabout to enter deliberations, the jury heard only from the State,\n\nwhich urged it to conclude that Figueroa-Sanabria was \u201camong the\n\nworst of the worst,\u201d and that \u201cthe death of those two people on that\n\nboat, that night, warrant that [Figueroa-Sanabria] pay with his.\u201d\n\n     \u201c[L]awyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries.\u201d\n\nGideon, 372 U.S. at 344. \u201cThe Sixth Amendment stands as a\n\nconstant admonition that if the constitutional safeguards it\n\nprovides be lost, justice will not still be done.\u201d Zerbst, 304 U.S. at\n\n462 (internal quotation marks omitted). The presence and\n\nassistance of counsel, one of these constitutional safeguards, is\n\nparamount, as it affects a defendant\u2019s ability to \u201cassert any other\n\nrights he may have.\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 654 (quoting Walter V.\n\nSchaefer, Federalism and State Criminal Procedure, 70 Harv. L. Rev.\n\n1, 8 (1956)). Here, because of the trial court\u2019s misstatement of the\n\nlaw, Figueroa-Sanabria stood alone during opening statements, the\n\nState\u2019s presentation of aggravating evidence, and closing\n\narguments. This means that Figueroa-Sanabria was without the\n\nassistance to which he was constitutionally entitled. While\ufffd the\n\n\n                                 - 47 -\n\f\u201cdoctrine of fundamental error should be applied only in rare\n\ncases,\u201d Smith, 521 So. 2d at 108, Figueroa-Sanabria has\n\nestablished that he is entitled to a new penalty phase.\n\n                                 III\n\n     We affirm Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s convictions for the first-degree\n\nmurders of John Travlos and Germana Morin. We set aside his\n\nsentences of death and remand for new penalty phase proceedings.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\nMU\u00d1IZ, C.J., and CANADY, GROSSHANS, and FRANCIS, JJ.,\nconcur.\nFRANCIS, J., concurs with an opinion.\nLABARGA, J., concurs in result.\nSASSO, J., did not participate.\n\nNOT FINAL UNTIL TIME EXPIRES TO FILE REHEARING MOTION\nAND, IF FILED, DETERMINED.\n\nFRANCIS, J., concurring.\n\n     I agree with the majority that Mr. Figueroa-Sanabria is entitled\n\nto a new sentencing hearing based on the trial court\u2019s fundamental\n\nerror in forcing him to abandon counsel during the penalty phase.\n\nThat said, I write separately to reject Mr. Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s claim\n\nthat the State violated his Fourth Amendment rights under\n\nCarpenter v. State, 228 So. 3d 535 (Fla. 2017), when it obtained Mr.\n\n\n\n                                - 48 -\n\fFigueroa-Sanabria\u2019s historical cell site location information (CSLI)\n\nvia subpoena. As explained below, because Carpenter distorts the\n\nproper application of the exclusionary rule, I urge abandoning the\n\ndecision\u2019s misguided overreach in rejecting binding United States\n\nSupreme Court precedent. By overruling Carpenter, this Court\n\nwould rightly relieve the unconstitutional burden on the State to\n\nforecast the \u201csettledness\u201d of Fourth Amendment law and conform\n\nour precedent to that of the U.S. Supreme Court, as mandated by\n\nthe Florida Constitution.\n\n     While investigating Mr. Figueroa-Sanabria as the prime\n\nsuspect in the 2013 murders of John Travlos and Germana Morin,\n\nthe State obtained Mr. Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s CSLI data via subpoena.\n\nThis data revealed that Mr. Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s cellphone was\n\nwithin the area of the marina during the time the victims were\n\nmurdered.23 When the State filed the subpoena to obtain Mr.\n\n\n\n\n     23. The historical CSLI also demonstrated that Mr. Figueroa-\nSanabria\u2019s girlfriend, whom he accused of committing the murders,\nwas likely within the area of their apartment north of the marina\nbut pinged the tower closer to the apartment. By contrast, Mr.\nFigueroa-Sanabria\u2019s CSLI data revealed that he was within range of\nthe marina and his northern apartment, but his phone pinged the\n\n                                - 49 -\n\fFigueroa-Sanabria\u2019s CSLI data, two opinions from the Fourth\n\nDistrict Court of Appeal established that the Fourth Amendment\n\ndid not require the State to seek a warrant for CSLI. See Mitchell v.\n\nState, 25 So. 3d 632 (Fla. 4th DCA 2009); Johnson v. State, 110 So.\n\n3d 954 (Fla. 4th DCA 2013). Therefore, the State complied with\n\nbinding precedent permitting their request at the time. 24\n\n     Still, the State would be punished for a lack of prophetic\n\nability. By the time the State brought the case to trial six years\n\nlater, their search of Mr. Figueroa-Sanabria\u2019s cell phone data hit a\n\nlegal landmine: this Court\u2019s 2017 Carpenter decision. Running with\n\nJustice Sotomayor\u2019s concurring opinion in Davis v. United States,\n\n564 U.S. 229, 250-52 (2011) (Sotomayor, J., concurring), the\n\nCarpenter decision addressed the question of whether the police\n\ncould reasonably rely on binding appellate court precedent when\n\nthat precedent was \u201cunsettled\u201d when the search occurred.\n\nCarpenter, 228 So. 3d at 541-42. In her opinion, Justice Sotomayor\n\n\n\nsouthmost tower, making it more likely that he was closer to the\nmarina after the murders.\n\n     24. Neither case was certified for review by this Court when\nthe search was conducted.\n\n\n                                - 50 -\n\fcautioned that the Davis decision did not resolve this question.\n\nDavis, 564 U.S. at 252 (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (\u201c[W]hether\n\nexclusion would result in appreciable deterrence in the\n\ncircumstances of this case is a different question from whether\n\nexclusion would appreciably deter Fourth Amendment violations\n\nwhen the governing law is unsettled. The Court\u2019s answer to the\n\nformer question in this case thus does not resolve the latter one.\u201d).\n\nThe Carpenter Court tasked itself with resolving that allegedly open\n\nquestion and held the State must seek a warrant if the precedent\n\ndisclaiming the need for one was \u201cunsettled.\u201d Carpenter, 228 So. 3d\n\nat 541-42.\n\n     Extending this newfangled principle, the Carpenter Court\n\ndisagreed that the good-faith exception applied to the warrantless\n\nsearch of a cellphone incident to arrest, despite binding Florida\n\nappellate court precedent authorizing that practice at the time of\n\nsaid search. Id. 25 Relying on that decision and the U.S. Supreme\n\n\n\n      25. The Carpenter Court seemingly limited its decision\u2019s scope\nby claiming that the officers should not have relied on a case in the\npipeline for review at this Court. See Carpenter, 228 So. 3d at 541\n(\u201cThe First District\u2019s certified question to this Court only furthers\nthe notion that the officers in Carpenter\u2019s case should not have\nrelied on Smallwood [v. State, 61 So. 3d 448 (Fla. 1st DCA 2011)]\n\n                                - 51 -\n\fCourt\u2019s holding in its 2018 Carpenter case, Carpenter v. United\n\nStates, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2221 (2018) (holding that the State must\n\nobtain a warrant to access a suspect\u2019s historical CSLI data), Mr.\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria claims his CSLI data evidence should have been\n\nexcluded because of the change in the law. Id. In effect, Mr.\n\nFigueroa-Sanabria claims the State should have known not to rely\n\non two binding appellate decisions authorizing a non-warrant\n\nrequest for CSLI data at the time of the search because the law was\n\n\u201cunsettled\u201d when the search was done.\n\n     But this Court\u2019s Carpenter opinion improperly relied on\n\nJustice Sotomayor\u2019s concurring opinion in Davis. Rather than rely\n\non the concurrence\u2019s attempt to limit the majority opinion\u2019s\n\n\n\nas being the final controlling judicial precedent in this area of\nconstitutional law while the case was certified to this Court for final\ndecision.\u201d). But there is no principled grounding for that limitation,\nwhich is why Mr. Figueroa-Sanabria can raise a colorable argument\nhere. Id. (\u201cThe \u2018conscientious police work\u2019 discussed\nin Davis requires that officers not engage in warrantless searches\nunless clearly authorized by law . . . . Thus, if the law on a\nparticular issue is still developing, it is not reasonable for officers to\nrely on questionable decisions in pipeline cases to justify\nwarrantless searches . . . .\u201d). Justice Sotomayor identified no such\nlimitation on the \u201cunsettledness\u201d of a precedent in her concurrence.\nIn any event, Carpenter should be rejected regardless of the\ndecision\u2019s intended scope.\n\n\n                                  - 52 -\n\fapplicability, the Carpenter Court should have applied the Davis\n\nmajority opinion\u2019s reasoning. The majority there announced a\n\ndifferent rule than the one the Carpenter Court employed: \u201cEvidence\n\nobtained during a search conducted in reasonable reliance on\n\nbinding precedent is not subject to the exclusionary rule.\u201d Davis,\n\n564 U.S. at 241; see also Carpenter, 228 So. 3d at 544 (Lawson, J.,\n\ndissenting) (\u201cThere is simply no way that reliance on binding legal\n\nprecedent\u2014whether well-settled or not\u2014can be cast as police\n\nmisconduct, much less \u2018flagrant\u2019 police misconduct.\u201d). The Davis\n\nmajority reasoned that the proper balance between deterring police\n\nmisconduct and the hefty cost inflicted by the exclusionary rule was\n\nto apply the good-faith exception when the police rely on binding\n\nprecedent:\n\n           About all that exclusion would deter in this case is\n     conscientious police work. Responsible law enforcement\n     officers will take care to learn what is required of them\n     under Fourth Amendment precedent and will conform\n     their conduct to these rules. But by the same token,\n     when binding appellate precedent specifically authorizes\n     a particular police practice, well-trained officers will and\n     should use that tool to fulfill their crime-detection and\n     public-safety responsibilities. An officer who conducts a\n     search in reliance on binding appellate precedent does no\n     more than act as a reasonable officer would and should\n     act under the circumstances. The deterrent effect of\n\n\n\n                                - 53 -\n\f     exclusion in such a case can only be to discourage the\n     officer from doing his duty.\n           That is not the kind of deterrence the exclusionary\n     rule seeks to foster. We have stated before, and we\n     reaffirm today, that the harsh sanction of exclusion\n     should not be applied to deter objectively reasonable law\n     enforcement activity. Evidence obtained during a search\n     conducted in reasonable reliance on binding precedent is\n     not subject to the exclusionary rule.\n\nDavis, 564 U.S. at 241 (internal citations and quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n     Yet even in the face of the Davis majority opinion\u2019s holding\n\nthat reliance on precedent constitutes good-faith for purposes of the\n\nexception, the Carpenter Court and Mr. Figueroa-Sanabria argue\n\nthat his historical CSLI must be excluded. Instead of following the\n\nDavis decision, Mr. Figueroa-Sanabria and the Carpenter decision\n\ndemand that the State question binding authority and act as a kind\n\nof constitutional spiritual medium, using some presupposed\n\nclairvoyance to determine the future \u201csettledness\u201d of the law out of\n\nthe ether. See generally Carpenter, 228 So. 3d at 541-42. Rather\n\nthan foisting this unwieldy burden of prophecy on law enforcement,\n\nthe U.S. Supreme Court correctly concluded that suppressing\n\nevidence in this context diverges from the foundation and principles\n\nof the exclusionary rule. Davis, 564 U.S. at 241 (\u201cAn officer who\n\n\n                                - 54 -\n\fconducts a search in reliance on binding appellate precedent does\n\nno more than \u201c \u2018ac[t] as a reasonable officer would and should act\u2019\n\nunder the circumstances.\u201d) (alteration in original). We should do so\n\nas well.\n\n     Compounding this constitutional error, the Carpenter Court\n\nignored limitations on our discretion in the text of the Florida\n\nConstitution. Under the conformity clause, \u201c[t]he right of the people\n\nto be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d is to \u201cbe construed in\n\nconformity with the 4th Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution, as interpreted by the United States Supreme\n\nCourt.\u201d Art. I, \u00a7 12, Fla. Const. (emphasis added).26 By ignoring\n\n\n\n      26. Notably, the conformity clause of article one, section\ntwelve was adopted in part to bring Florida\u2019s exclusionary rule\njurisprudence in line with the federal good-faith exception. William\nA. Buzzett & Deborah K. Kearney, Commentary to 1982 Amendment,\n25A, Fla. Stat. Ann., art. I, \u00a7 12, Fla. Const. (2020). (\u201cIn response,\nthe governor, attorney general, state prosecutors, and the law\nenforcement community supported a joint resolution in the 1982\nRegular Session, which would have engrossed a good faith\nexception onto the constitutional exclusionary rule.\u201d); see\nCarpenter, 228 So. 3d at 543 n.3 (Lawson, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe\ncommentary to the 1982 amendment states that the amendment\nwas necessary to modify the exclusionary rule [in Florida] and to\nallow adherence by the Florida courts to the good faith exception\nadopted by the federal courts.\u201d) (alteration in original) (quoting\n\n                                - 55 -\n\fthis clause\u2014as Justice Lawson correctly argued in his dissent\u2014the\n\nCarpenter Court exercised discretion it did not have to reject the\n\nDavis majority\u2019s application of the good-faith exception. See\n\nCarpenter, 228 So. 3d at 542-45 (Lawson, J., dissenting) (\u201cClearly,\n\nwe are bound by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s Fourth\n\nAmendment jurisprudence, including the majority opinion in Davis\n\nv. United States.\u201d). Though our Court might find an alternative\n\ninterpretation of the Fourth Amendment alluring, we cannot shrug\n\noff the strictures of binding constitutional provisions when it suits\n\nus. See Soca v. State, 673 So. 2d 24, 27 (Fla. 1996). \u201c[W]e are\n\nbound to follow the interpretations of the United States Supreme\n\nCourt with respect to the Fourth Amendment and provide to Florida\n\ncitizens no greater protection than those interpretations.\u201d Id.\n\n     As a result of these choices, the Carpenter Court created a gulf\n\nbetween our precedent and the Davis majority opinion that muddies\n\nthe waters of the good-faith exception and violates the conformity\n\nclause. When the State is considering whether they must seek a\n\n\n\n\nCrain v. State, 914 So. 2d 1015, 1022-23 (Fla. 5th DCA 2005) (en\nbanc)).\n\n\n                                - 56 -\n\fwarrant, prosecutors and the police should not have to scry a\n\ncrystal ball, consult a Ouija board, or conduct a group tarot card\n\nreading to intuit the law\u2019s metaphysical finality before making their\n\nchoice. Hanging this burden of prophecy around the State\u2019s neck\n\nfails to accomplish the goals or purposes of the exclusionary rule as\n\nexplained in the Davis majority opinion. And as Justice Lawson\n\nexplained then, Carpenter flouts the Florida Constitution by\n\ndisregarding the conformity clause. Because the decision was both\n\nmisguided and unconstitutional, I urge overruling Carpenter and\n\nbringing our precedent in line with the United States and Florida\n\nConstitutions.\n\nAn Appeal from the Circuit Court in and for Pinellas County,\n    Pat Siracusa, Judge \u2013 Case No. 522013CF006490XXXXNO\n\nHoward L. \u201cRex\u201d Dimmig, II, Public Defender, and Steven L.
