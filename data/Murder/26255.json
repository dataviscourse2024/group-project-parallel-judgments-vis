After careful review, we\n\naffirm Appellant\u2019s Judgment of Sentence and grant counsel\u2019s Petition to\n\nWithdraw.\n\n        The facts are, briefly, as follows.    On July 25, 2015, Appellant killed\n\nDarrin Ward, Jr., by shooting him multiple times in broad daylight, on a\n____________________________________________\n\n\n118 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(c); 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 907; 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6106; and 18 Pa.C.S.\n\u00a7 6108, respectively.\n\n2   Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).\n\fJ-S36030-18\n\n\n\nresidential street where numerous eyewitnesses were sitting outside.          The\n\nshooting was in retaliation for the shooting of Appellant\u2019s uncle by a close\n\nassociate of Ward.\n\n        Police arrested Appellant on August 26, 2015, in connection with a\n\nseparate Attempted Murder. During the course of their investigation of that\n\ncrime, ballistics experts matched shell casings from both crimes.          Police\n\nsubsequently arrested Appellant and charged him with the instant crimes.\n\n        On July 17, 2017, Appellant entered a negotiated guilty plea to the\n\nabove-referenced charges. That same day, the court sentenced Appellant to\n\nthe negotiated aggregate term of 28 \u00bd years\u2019 to 57 years\u2019 incarceration.3\n\n        On July 25, 2017, Appellant filed a counseled Motion to Withdraw Guilty\n\nPlea.    Appellant\u2019s Motion consisted of three enumerated paragraphs that\n\nstated only the date of his conviction, the length of the sentence the court\n\nimposed, and a bald assertion that he would like the court to permit him to\n\nwithdraw his guilty plea. See Motion, 7/25/17, at 1 (unpaginated). Appellant\n\ndid not allege any grounds to support his withdrawal request. See id.\n\n        The trial court denied Appellant\u2019s Motion without a hearing on July 27,\n\n2017.\n\n        This appeal followed. Both Appellant and the trial court complied with\n\nPa.R.A.P. 1925.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3 The court ordered Appellant to serve this sentence concurrently with a\nsentence of 7 to 8 years\u2019 incarceration that he is currently serving in a separate\ncase for convictions of Attempted Murder and firearms offenses.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S36030-18\n\n\n\n      On January 23, 2018, counsel filed the Anders Brief and Petition to\n\nWithdraw as Counsel. Appellant did not file a pro se or counselled response\n\nto either the Brief or the Petition.\n\n      As a preliminary matter, we address counsel\u2019s Petition to Withdraw.\n\n\u201cWhen presented with an Anders brief, this Court may not review the merits\n\nof the underlying issues without first passing on the request to withdraw.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Daniels, 999 A.2d 590, 593 (Pa. Super. 2010) (citation\n\nomitted).   In order for counsel to withdraw from an appeal pursuant to\n\nAnders, our Supreme Court has determined that counsel must meet certain\n\nrequirements, including:\n\n      (1) provide a summary of the procedural history and facts, with\n      citations to the record;\n\n      (2) refer to anything in the record that counsel believes arguably\n      supports the appeal;\n\n      (3) set forth counsel's conclusion that the appeal is frivolous; and\n\n      (4) state counsel's reasons for concluding that the appeal is\n      frivolous. Counsel should articulate the relevant facts of record,\n      controlling case law, and/or statutes on point that have led to the\n      conclusion that the appeal is frivolous.\n\nCommonwealth v. Santiago, 978 A.2d 349, 361 (Pa. 2009).\n\n      In the instant case, counsel has complied with all of the requirements\n\nof Anders as articulated in Santiago. Additionally, counsel confirms that he\n\nsent Appellant a copy of the Anders Brief, as well as a letter explaining to\n\nAppellant that he has the right to proceed pro se or the right to retain new\n\ncounsel. See Commonwealth v. Millisock, 873 A.2d 748, 751 (Pa. Super\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fJ-S36030-18\n\n\n\n2005) (describing notice requirements). Counsel appended a copy of the letter\n\nto his Petition to Withdraw.\n\n      Once counsel has satisfied the above requirements, it is then this Court\u2019s\n\nduty to conduct an independent review of the record to discern if there are\n\nany additional, non-frivolous issues overlooked by counsel and render an\n\nindependent judgment as to whether the appeal is, in fact, wholly frivolous.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Yorgey, ___ A.3d ___, 2018 Pa. Super. 136, *5 (Pa.\n\nSuper. filed May 24, 2018) (en banc) (noting that Anders requires the\n\nreviewing court to \u201creview \u2018the case\u2019 as presented in the entire record with\n\nconsideration first of issues raised by counsel.\u201d).\n\n      Counsel raises the following issue in the Anders Brief:\n\n      Did the lower court err in denying [A]ppellant\u2019s Motion to\n      Withdraw his guilty plea?\n\nAnders Brief at 3.\n\n      The Honorable Rose Marie DeFino-Nastasi, who presided at Appellant\u2019s\n\nplea hearing, has authored a comprehensive and well-reasoned Opinion, citing\n\nto the record and case law in addressing Appellant\u2019s claim on appeal. After a\n\ncareful review of Appellant\u2019s arguments and the record, we affirm on the basis\n\nof the trial court\u2019s Opinion, which concluded that (1) Appellant\u2019s failure to\n\nsupport his request to withdraw his guilty plea with any facts or reasons was\n\na sufficient basis to deny his Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea; and (2) even if\n\nAppellant had alleged that he entered his plea involuntarily, the record belies\n\nthat claim because (a) the court addressed all of the required factors at\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fJ-S36030-18\n\n\n\nAppellant\u2019s plea colloquy; (b) Appellant received the benefit of his bargain;\n\nand (c) Appellant exercised his right to allocute during which he expressed his\n\nremorse and reaffirmed his guilt. See Trial Ct. Op., 10/31/17, at 4-6.\n\n      Accordingly, we agree with counsel and conclude that the issue raised\n\nin the Anders Brief is wholly frivolous. Furthermore, our independent review\n\nof the record confirms counsel\u2019s assertion that Appellant cannot raise any non-\n\nfrivolous issues in this appeal. See Commonwealth v. Flowers, 113 A.3d\n\n1246, 1250 (Pa. Super 2015) (requiring this Court to independently review\n\nthe record to ensure that counsel has not overlooked any additional non-\n\nfrivolous issues). Thus, we grant counsel\u2019s Petition to Withdraw and affirm\n\nAppellant\u2019s Judgment of Sentence. The parties are instructed to attach a copy\n\nof the trial court\u2019s October 31, 2017 Opinion to all future filings.\n\n      Judgment of Sentence affirmed.

His claim is as follows:\n\n       I.      The lower court erred and abused its discretion by denying Defendant's Motion to\n\n               Withdraw his Guilty Plea.\n\n                                             FACTS\n\n       On July 25, 2015 at 12:56 p.m. the Defendant, Kyle Mathis, killed the decedent, Darrin\n\nWard, Jr., by shooting him multiple times with a gun at 515 East Hill Creek Dnve in\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania. The shooting was in broad daylight, on a residential street, where\n\nnumerous eyewitnesses were sitting outside. The shooting was in retaliation for the shooting of\n\nthe Defendant's uncle by Stephan Brooks. The decedent was a close associate of Stephan\n\nBrooks. Brooks was present on the scene but entered a house at the time of the shooting N.T.\n\n07/17/17 at p. 26, 30.\n\n       The decedent was walking down East Hill Creek Drive when the Defendant called him\n\nover. After a brief conversation, the decedent told the Defendant that he did not have anything to\n\ndo with what he was talking about. The Defendant then pushed the decedent and began shooting\n\nat him, saying \"you know what this is for.\" The decedent was then taken to Albert Einstein\n\nHospital and pronounced dead at 3:45 p.m. Id\n\n\n\n                                                    2\n\f         Fourteen (14) fired 9mm cartridge casings (hereinafter referred to as FCC's) and three (3)\n\n9mm bullets were found by police at the scene. Five (5) more 9mm bullets were recovered from\n\nthe body of the decedent at the hospital. Id at pp. 26-27.\n\n         Dr. Victoria Sorokm, a qualified expert in the field of forensic pathology, identified\n\nnineteen (19) bullet entrance wounds on the decedent's body but noted that some of the entrance\n\nwounds may have been re-entry wounds from other parts of his body (i.e. from the arm to the\n\ntorso). Dr. Sorokin confirmed that the cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds and the\n\nmanner of death was homicide. Id at pp. 27-28.\n\n         The Defendant was arrested on August 26, 2015 for a separate attempted murder that\n\ntook place in the 22nd Pohce Distnct in North Philadelphia. Nineteen (19) 9mm FCC's and one\n\n(1) 9mm bullet were recovered from that cnme scene He was arrested at 2035 Berks Street in a\n\nhome that belonged to the mother of one of his children. Inside the home were an additional\n\nseven (7) hve 9mm cartndges. Id at pp. 28-29.\n\n         On October 28, 2015, ballistics experts determined, to a reasonable degree of scientific\n\ncertainty, that the bullets from the crime scene at 515 East Hill Creek Dnve and the bullets from\n\nthe crime scene at 2035 Berks Streets were fired from the same 9mm gun. Id at pp 29-30.\n\n         The Defendant was identified by multiple witnesses, including Stephan Brooks, who\n\nidentified him by his nickname, Trouble, which is tattooed on the Defendant's arm. When the\n\nshooting occurred, three (3) women and a seven (7) year old boy were within feet of the incident.\n\nAnother witness identified the Defendant from a double bhnd photo array where six (6) photos\n\nwere shown to the witness and the administrator of the array did not know the Defendant.

The proper inquiry on consideration of a guilty plea withdrawal motion is\n\nwhether the accused has made some colorable demonstration, under the circumstances, such that\n\npermitung withdrawal of the plea would promote fairness and justice.\" Com v Carrasquillo,\n\n631 Pa. 692, 704-706 (Pa. 2015). \"A trial court's decision regarding whether to permit\n\na guilty plea to be withdrawn should not be upset absent an abuse of discretion;\n\nan abuse of discretion exists when a defendant shows any fair and just reasons\n\nfor withdrawing his plea absent substantial prejudice to the Commonwealth.\" Com v Elia, 83\n\nA.3d 254, 261 (Pa. Super. 2013)\n\n       In his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, Appellant fails to set forth any fact to support\n\nhis request to withdraw his guilty plea. He merely makes a bald assertion that he would like to\n\nwithdraw his plea. The motion states the following:\n\n       \"l     On July 17, 2017, Petitioner entered a plea of guilty to Murder, etc.\n\n        2.    In accordance with the negotiation between defense counsel and the\n\n              Commonwealth, Your Honor sentenced Petitioner to a term of 28.5-57 years in a\n\n              state correctional institution.\n\n\n\n                                                      4\n\f         3.    Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court allow him to withdraw his plea of\n\n               guilty, which he entered on July 17, 2017.\"\n\nDefendant's Mallon to Withdraw Gutlty Plea, at p I, filed July 25, 2017. Defendant does not\n\nclaim, for instance, that he is innocent of the crime he pied guilty to, nor does he claim that his\n\nguilty plea was the result of pressure, coercion, or misunderstanding. For this reason alone,\n\nDefendant was not entitled to withdraw his guilty plea and it was not an abuse of discretion for\n\nthe Court to deny his motion to withdraw it.\n\n       Assuming arguendo that Defendant's claim was that his plea was involuntary, the record\n\nbelies that claim and Defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea fails to elucidate it. There\n\nare six areas that Pennsylvania law requires trial courts to look into when examining the\n\nvoluntariness of a guilty plea. The trial court must inquire mto a defendant's understanding\n\nregarding\u00b7\n\n\n                       -1. The charges to which he is pleading guilty\n\n                       -2. The factual basis for his plea\n\n                       -3. The right to a tnal by jury\n\n                       -4. The presumption of innocence\n\n                       -5. The permissible ranges of sentences; and\n\n                       -6. The fact that the judge is not bound by the plea agreement.\n\n\nCom v McCauley, 797 A.2d 920, 922 (Pa. Super. 2001)\n\n\nAll of these factors were addressed during Defendant's guilty plea colloquy. NT 07/17/17.\n\n(\"Where the record clearly indicates that a guilty plea colloquy was conducted, dunng which it\n\nbecame evident that the defendant understood the nature of the charges against him, the\n\n\n                                                         5\n\fvoluntariness of the plea is established.\" Com v McCauley, 797 A.2d 920, 922 (Pa. Super.\n\n2011).\n\n\n         Defendant also received the benefit of the bargain, in that, in exchange for pleading guilty\n\nto Third Degree Murder, the Commonwealth did not charge Defendant with First Degree Murder\n\nand pursue a life-sentence for the Defendant. (\"The desire of an accused to benefit from a plea\n\nbargain is a strong indicator of the voluntariness of his plea.\" Com v Pollard, 832 A.2d 517,\n\n524 (Pa. Super 2003)). Evidence was presented by the Commonwealth which indicated that\n\nDefendant shot the decedent in retaliation for the shooting of the Defendant's uncle. The\n\nshooting took place in broad daylight and Defendant was identified by multiple eyewitnesses\n\nFourteen (14) 9mm FCC's were recovered from the crime scene and five (5) 9mm projectiles\n\nwere recovered from the decedent's body. Clearly, the ballistic evidence strongly corroborates\n\nthe specific intent to kill needed to prove Fust Degree Murder. Appellant pleaded guilty to Third\n\nDegree Murder and removed himself from the very real possibility of a life sentence.\n\n\n         Finally, after the witness impact evidence was offered at sentencing, Defendant chose to\n\nexercise his right of allocution, during which he expressed his remorse and reaffirmed his guilt\n\n\n         \"Every case I had, my mom always told me, she always told me to man up. If I did\n\n         something, man up to it. If I didn't do nothing, don't JUSt fall for anything and I always\n\n         lived by that. So today that is what I did, I owned up for what I did and for the family,\n\n         that I'm truly sorry that it had to come down to this with this situation we are in nght now\n\n         but as long as they know that every day, even if they don't think about it, that they know\n\n         somebody is thinking about it because I can't let that out of my life because now it is a\n\n         part of my life.\"\n\n\n                                                      6\n\fN.T. 07/17/17 at pp. 47-48.\n\n\n       For all the reasons stated above, the Court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying\n\nDefendant's Motion to Withdraw his guilty plea.\n\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n       Based on the foregoing, the court's denial of the PCRA petition should be affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     7\n\fCommonwealth v.
