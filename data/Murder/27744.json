Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.).1 He suffers from certain disorders, but his\nprimary diagnosis is \u201cschizoaffective disorder bipolar type.\u201d\n       On January 27, 2020, the superior court determined that appellant lacks capacity to\nrefuse medical treatment. The court issued a written order that appellant could \u201cbe\ninvoluntarily administered antipsychotic medication by Department of State Hospitals in\nthe dosage and for the frequency deemed necessary by Department of State Hospitals\u2019\nclinical treatment staff for the period of time not to exceed one year from the date of the\norder.\u201d\n       Appellant argues that the court\u2019s order violates his federal constitutional rights to\ndue process and equal protection. He further contends that the court used erroneous\nstandards in issuing its order, and he asserts that substantial evidence does not support the\ncourt\u2019s ruling. We agree with respondent that appellant has forfeited his federal\nconstitutional challenges, and we conclude that appellant does not establish ineffective\nassistance of counsel. We also determine that substantial evidence supports the order,\nwhich we affirm.\n                                     BACKGROUND\n       The hearing below was initiated with the government\u2019s petition seeking to\nadminister antipsychotic medications to appellant against his will. As we explain in\ngreater detail later in this opinion, California law permits the involuntary administration\n\n\n1      Under the Sexually Violent Predator Act (Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.), a\nconvicted sex offender may be declared a sexually violent predator (SVP) and be civilly\ncommitted upon completion of the criminal sentence. (People v. Superior Court (Troyer)\n(2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 654, 657.) A petition to commit someone as an SVP requires\ntwo mental health evaluators to agree that the person in question is an SVP and is likely\nto engage in acts of sexual violence without appropriate treatment and custody. (Ibid; see\nalso Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7 6601, subds. (d)\u2013(i).)\n\n\n                                             2.\n\fof such drugs upon an SVP if a court determines that the person is either (1) incompetent\nto refuse the treatment; or (2) dangerous within the meaning of Welfare and Institutions\nCode section 5300.2 (In re Calhoun (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1354; see also In re\nQawi (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1, 9\u201310 [establishing that the government may involuntarily\nimpose antipsychotic drugs upon a mentally disordered offender (MDO) utilizing the\nsame criteria].)\n       The government\u2019s petition in this matter was filed under the authority of In re\nCalhoun. The parties and the trial court agreed to bifurcate the proceedings. During the\nfirst portion, only appellant\u2019s capacity would be addressed. However, as appellant notes\nin his opening brief, no further hearing occurred after the court ruled against appellant,\nand the issue of dangerousness was never reached.3\n\n\n2      Welfare and Institutions Code section 5300 is part of the Lanterman-Petris-Short\nAct. This section permits, after expiration of a \u201c14-day period of intensive treatment,\u201d a\nperson may be confined for further treatment (not to exceed 180 days) if one of the\nfollowing exists:\n       \u201c(1) The person has attempted, inflicted, or made a serious threat of substantial\nphysical harm upon the person of another after having been taken into custody, and while\nin custody, for evaluation and treatment, and who, as a result of a mental health disorder,\npresents a demonstrated danger of inflicting substantial physical harm upon others.\n        \u201c(2) The person had attempted, or inflicted physical harm upon the person of\nanother, that act having resulted in the person being taken into custody and who presents,\nas a result of a mental health disorder, a demonstrated danger of inflicting substantial\nphysical harm upon others.\n        \u201c(3) The person had made a serious threat of substantial physical harm upon the\nperson of another within seven days of being taken into custody, that threat having at\nleast in part resulted in the person being taken into custody, and the person presents, as a\nresult of a mental health disorder, a demonstrated danger of inflicting substantial physical\nharm upon others.\u201d (Welf & Inst. Code, \u00a7 5300, subd. (a)(1)\u2013(3).)\n3      A finding of dangerousness was not necessary for the trial court to issue its order.\nInstead, appellant\u2019s lack of capacity was sufficient. (See In re Calhoun, supra, 121\nCal.App.4th at p. 1354.) Respondent asserts that the parties below \u201cstipulated\u201d that the\n\u201csole issue before the trial court was T.F.\u2019s capacity to consent to medical treatment.\u201d\nAppellant objects to respondent classifying this as a stipulation. We need not resolve that\n\n                                             3.\n\fI.     The Testimony From The Psychiatrist.\n       The prosecution established that appellant is an SVP who is under the care and\ntreatment of a psychiatrist. Appellant is an adult patient at the state hospital in Coalinga.\nHis doctor, Johnny Chee, testified that appellant\u2019s primary diagnosis is schizoaffective\ndisorder bipolar type. Appellant\u2019s main symptoms (when he is off his medications) are\nmania, irritability, and delusions. Appellant reports auditory hallucinations. He also\nsuffers from \u201cantisocial personality disorder, other specified paraphilic disorder, cannabis\nuse disorder, [and] hallucinogen disorder.\u201d\n       Chee testified that, when he first met appellant, appellant agreed at that time that\nhe had a mental illness, and that he benefited from the medications. More recently,\nhowever, appellant did not believe that he had a mental illness. He had refused to take\nhis medications for about one week, and he acquired a withdrawal symptom. Several\nmonths after refusing to take his medications, appellant mentioned that he did have a\nmental illness, but he did not believe he had schizoaffective disorder. During a more\nrecent conversation with appellant, appellant said \u201che heard voices\u201d all the time.\nAppellant, however, objected to Chee\u2019s suggestion to use antipsychotics to treat his\nauditory hallucinations. Chee believed that appellant was aware that he suffers from a\npsychiatric condition, but \u201cI don\u2019t think he necessarily agrees with his clinical team or\nmy view on what he has.\u201d\n       At the time of this testimony, appellant was taking lithium (450 milligrams a day)\nas a mood stabilizer; paroxetine (20 milligrams a day) as an antidepressant; and\npaliperidone (nine milligrams a day) as an antipsychotic. Chee described these drugs as\n\u201ca common combination for schizoaffective disorder.\u201d He explained that lithium was\nstarted in the summer of 2019 \u201cafter a period of non-adherence to [appellant\u2019s] previous\nmood stabilizer Depakote because he also wanted to resume his antidepressant\n\ndispute. Instead, regardless of how the bifurcation occurred, it is undisputed that the trial\ncourt only considered appellant\u2019s capacity during this hearing.\n\n\n                                              4.\n\fparoxetine.\u201d Chee explained that the risk of prescribing an antidepressant without a\nmood stabilizer \u201cis bad and can sometimes result in mania in certain patients.\u201d\n       The benefit of lithium is to keep appellant\u2019s mood stable. In comparison to\nappellant\u2019s prior mood stabilizer, depakote, lithium would not result in weight gain,\nwhich was a concern that appellant had expressed when he was on depakote. The benefit\nof paroxetine is that it helps with depression or depressed mood. In the context of\nappellant\u2019s diagnosis, however, it could result in mania. The benefit of paliperidone is\nthat it treats psychotic symptoms such as voices and delusions. The risk it carries \u201cis\nthings like acute dystonia, which is kind of a stiffening of the muscles; EPS, which is a\nlong-term effect of antipsychotics where there is kind of cognitive limit; and a less\nconsequential side effect\u201d is a complaint of \u201csedation.\u201d\n       Chee testified that he had discussed the risks and benefits of these drugs with\nappellant as \u201cbest as I could.\u201d In Chee\u2019s opinion, appellant was unable to understand the\nbenefits and risks of taking or not taking the psychotropic medications. Appellant was\nalso not capable of understanding, participating and evaluating the information provided\nto him with respect to his mental condition and treatment options. Chee explained that\nappellant \u201chas his opinion as to what the risks and benefits of his medications are and\nthey do not necessarily coincide with what we or what I feel like he needs to be taking to\nmaintain his stability.\u201d Chee noted that, when appellant had stopped taking his\nmedications altogether for about one week, there were a greater number of \u201cincident\nreports\u201d involving appellant, and Chee had decided to start the involuntary medication\nprocess.\n       Chee informed the court that less intrusive methods for appellant were not\navailable for a standard treatment of schizoaffective disorder. He further opined that\nappellant was unable to knowingly and intelligently give informed consent regarding his\ntreatment. Chee stated it was his professional opinion that appellant should be\nadministered psychotropic medication involuntarily if he refused to take the prescribed\n\n                                             5.\n\fmedication. The goal was to keep him \u201con the same scheduled medications that he has\nbeen on since before the start of his involuntary medication via hospital panel. The goal\nis not to increase his medications or whatnot. It is simply to make sure that he adheres to\nthe medication . . . he has been on.\u201d Chee testified that it was important to keep appellant\non his medications because it is \u201cthe standard of treatment for his diagnosis and his\nmental illness and he has had a decrease in incidents since he began adhering to his\nmedications again.\u201d\n       Chee agreed that appellant\u2019s current medication regimen was helping his\npsychiatric condition. The contents of appellant\u2019s conversations (at least in the times he\nhad agreed to see Chee or the team) \u201chave been more reality based.\u201d Reports of incidents\ninvolving appellant \u201chave completely decreased or been gone for the last couple of\nweeks.\u201d Before, appellant had suffered an increasing number of \u201csignificant incident\nreports against female staff. He has been documented as being more focused on females\nwhen he is manic. Since the start of the involuntary medication order by [the] hospital\npanel, those reports have been non-existent.\u201d Regarding delusions, Chee could not opine\nwhether those had lessened or not. However, Chee had not heard anything \u201cother than\nreality-based conversation coming from [appellant] in the last maybe one to two visits\nthat I\u2019ve seen him.\u201d Chee agreed that it was accurate to say that appellant\u2019s mood was\nmore stable, and his discussions reality-based, because of the medications.\nII.    Appellant\u2019s Testimony.\n       Appellant testified at the hearing. He agreed that, in June 2019, he had stopped\ntaking his medications for about nine days. During a meeting with Chee, appellant had\nagreed to stop taking depakote and start a different mood stabilizer. Chee had wanted\nhim to take lithium, but appellant had reservations because he knew people who had\ndeveloped tardive dyskinesia. Appellant did not want that same outcome so he would not\ntake lithium. However, the next time he received his medications, they had been changed\n\n\n\n                                             6.\n\fto lithium and haloperidol without appellant\u2019s knowledge. That is why he refused to take\nthem. According to appellant, he told Chee that he would take other medications, but\nChee told him that those were the only two medications available. Chee started the\ninvoluntary medication process when appellant refused to take them.\n       Appellant was concerned that the medications would cause him \u201cvisual twitches\u201d\nand other problems. He testified that, when considering whether or not to take prescribed\nmedication, he would read \u201cthe nursing handbook\u201d to see the side effects and any\n\u201ccounter-indicative\u201d medications. He would also talk to other people, including a \u201cdean\nand supervisor and a psychologist .\u2026\u201d\n       Appellant stated that he went back on his medications to avoid problems with\nstaff. According to him, when he is not on his medications \u201cthey think that I\u2019m going to\nbe a problem, so they make me a problem. They\u2014they\u2019ll search my room five times a\nday, they\u2019ll bump into me, and, like, they\u2019ll create a problem.\u201d\n       On cross-examination, appellant identified his diagnosis as schizoaffective\ndisorder but he was not sure that he had a mental illness. He did not believe he met the\ndefinition of that disorder because he was not \u201cdisorganized,\u201d \u201cunclean,\u201d or \u201cdirty.\u201d He\nsaid that disorder involved people who \u201ctalk to themselves and stumble around, and I\u2019m\nnot like that.\u201d He admitted that he suffers from auditory, visual and mental\nhallucinations. He said it was \u201cirrelevant\u201d to describe his hallucinations, but explained\nthat he has a \u201ccollective consciousness\u201d and he is \u201caware of things in the environment\nthat aren\u2019t being observed\u201d by others. He believes in God and he is \u201cspiritual.\u201d\n       Appellant testified that he hears \u201cwhat I expect are the thoughts of others, what is\nmost likely\u2014like I can intuit.\u201d He said he was very \u201cintuitive\u201d and he can \u201cintuit things\nand my mind gives body to that. Like I\u2019m able to get an audible voice in your presence,\nlike, I\u2014it isn\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014like, what\u2014like, it doesn\u2019t influence my capacity. In fact, it\nhelps me.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                             7.\n\f       Appellant testified that he did not want to take depakote because of weight gain.\nHe usually weighs 185 pounds but he now weighs 250, and the problem was getting\nworse. He decided to stay on depakote because the only alternative drugs were worse,\nbut Chee \u201cchanged it anyway.\u201d He stated that he was currently taking paliperidone,\nwhich was an antipsychotic. He said Chee\u2019s testimony had already identified the risks of\nthat drug. Appellant, however, claimed that the benefits were \u201cillusional.\u201d He compared\nit to \u201cdrinking water\u201d because it does not \u201cdo anything.\u201d Nevertheless, he would stay on\nthat drug for the sake of the staff. He noted that his mood had been stable \u201cfor a long\nperiod of time\u201d but he was not sure if that was attributable to lithium. However, he\nwould prefer to be on a mood stabilizer other than lithium because he was \u201cnot willing to\ntake the chance of tardive dyskinesia.\u201d\nIII.   The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling.\n       After hearing the testimony from Chee and appellant, the attorneys made relatively\nbrief arguments. Counsel for respondent generally asserted that appellant did not have\nfull awareness of his mental illness, and he was not able to participate in or make\ndecisions about his treatment options. In contrast, appellant\u2019s counsel emphasized that\nappellant was aware that he suffered from a mental condition, and he understood the\neffect certain medications have on him. According to appellant\u2019s counsel, appellant\nwanted to continue certain medications and discontinue other medications. Appellant\u2019s\ncounsel asserted that appellant takes \u201ca lot of different factors into consideration in\nmaking his decision as to what meds he should be on and what meds he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d In\nreply, counsel for respondent asserted that appellant had denied having a mental illness.\nAppellant needed to take his medications consistently, and there was a risk he would stop\nwhenever he disagreed with the medication regimen. Respondent asserted \u201cit\u2019s pretty\nclear that he doesn\u2019t understand the risks and benefits of the medication.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                              8.\n\f       The trial court stated that, although appellant is \u201cgenerally aware\u201d that he has a\nmental illness, \u201che\u2019s not acutely aware of his situation. He has a general understanding\nof the benefits and risks of some of the treatments but not all of the treatment, and he has\na tendency to substitute his judgment for the judgment of the doctors when it\u2019s\u2014he\nbelieves\u2014well, whenever he believes it\u2019s beneficial to him.\u201d The court found by \u201cclear\nand convincing evidence that [appellant is] not able to understand and knowingly and\nintelligently and rationally evaluate and participate in his treatment decision at this time.\u201d\nThe court noted that appellant has the right as a patient to question the doctor\u2019s judgment.\n\u201cHowever, when it gets to the point where the\u2014it becomes either refusals or refusals to\ntake certain medications where the health \u2026 of [appellant\u2019s health is] at stake and the\nhealth and safety of the public and those at the Department of State Hospitals [is] at\nstake, [appellant] has to yield.\u201d\n       The court found the involuntary treatment order to be appropriate. It issued a\nwritten order finding that appellant lacks capacity to refuse treatment. Appellant could be\n\u201cinvoluntarily administered antipsychotic medication by Department of State Hospitals in\nthe dosage and for the frequency deemed necessary by Department of State Hospitals\u2019\nclinical treatment staff for the period of time not to exceed one year from the date of the\norder.\u201d The order was signed on January 27, 2020, and filed that same day.\n                                       DISCUSSION\nI.     Appellant Has Forfeited His Federal Constitutional Challenges And He Fails\n       To Establish Ineffective Assistance Of Counsel.\n       The parties dispute numerous issues surrounding the trial court\u2019s order. According\nto appellant, the court violated his federal constitutional rights. He contends that the\ncourt failed to consider and apply the standards set forth in certain United States Supreme\nCourt opinions, which deal with the circumstances under which medications may be\ninvoluntarily administered to prisoners.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9.\n\f       In contrast, respondent asserts (in part) that waiver occurred because appellant\nfailed to raise any of the constitutional claims that he now advances. Respondent further\ncontends that appellant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated.\n       To overcome forfeiture (or waiver), appellant argues that any objection in the\nlower court based on the federal Constitution would have been futile. He also raises\nineffective assistance of counsel.\n       We agree with respondent that appellant has forfeited his federal constitutional\nclaims in failing to raise them below. Moreover, he does not demonstrate ineffective\nassistance of counsel.\n       A.     Appellant has forfeited his federal constitutional challenges.\n       The term \u201cforfeiture\u201d is defined as the failure to make the timely assertion of a\nright. (United States v. Olano (1993) 507 U.S. 725, 733.) To avoid forfeiture, a party\nmust call the trial court\u2019s attention to any infringement of rights or risk losing them.4\n(People v. Saunders, supra, 5 Cal.4th at p. 590 & fn. 6.) A failure to object in the trial\ncourt results in a forfeiture of those issues which are then raised on appeal. (People v.\nDykes (2009) 46 Cal.4th 731, 756; see also People v. Redd (2010) 48 Cal.4th 691, 730\n[failure to raise confrontation clause in the trial court forfeited the claim on appeal].)\n       Constitutional claims may be raised for the first time on appeal if the new\narguments do not involve facts or legal standards different from what was raised below.\n(People v. Tully (2012) 54 Cal.4th 952, 979\u2013980.) The new argument must assert \u201c \u2018that\nthe trial court\u2019s act or omission, insofar as wrong for the reasons actually presented to\n\n\n4       The terms \u201cwaiver\u201d and \u201cforfeiture\u201d are often used interchangeably. (People v.\nSaunders (1993) 5 Cal.4th 580, 590, fn. 6.) However, waiver is different from forfeiture.\nForfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right. In contrast, waiver is the\nintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right. (United States v. Olano,\nsupra, 507 U.S. at p. 733.) In this matter, respondent asserts that appellant has waived\nhis federal constitutional claims. However, forfeiture appears to be the correct term in\nthis situation.\n\n\n                                              10.\n\fthat court, had the additional legal consequence of violating the Constitution.\u2019\n[Citations.] However, \u2018[a] party cannot argue the court erred in failing to conduct an\nanalysis it was not asked to conduct.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Id. at p. 980.)\n       Appellant claims it would have been futile to raise his federal constitutional\narguments below. According to him, the trial court would have merely followed the\ncurrent California law. We find this argument unpersuasive. Instead, appellant was\nrequired to bring these issues to the court\u2019s attention or risk losing them. (People v.\nSaunders, supra, 5 Cal.4th at p. 590 & fn. 6.) His present constitutional challenges\ninvolve facts and legal standards that are different from what was argued below. In short,\nappellant cannot now contend that the court erred in failing to conduct an analysis it was\nnot asked to perform. (People v. Tully, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 980.) Appellant\u2019s failure\nto raise these constitutional issues in the superior court has resulted in their forfeiture on\nappeal. (People v. Redd, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 730; People v. Dykes, supra, 46 Cal.4th\nat p. 756.) Furthermore, appellant does not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.\n       B.     Appellant does not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.\n       Under the federal and state Constitutions, a criminal defendant is entitled to the\neffective assistance of counsel. (U.S. Const., 6th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15; People\nv. Ledesma (1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 215.) To prevail on such a claim, a defendant must\nestablish two criteria: (1) that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of\nreasonable competence; and (2) that he was thereby prejudiced. (Strickland v.\nWashington (1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687\u2013688.) The defendant has the burden of showing\nboth deficient performance and resulting prejudice. (People v. Lucas (1995) 12 Cal.4th\n415, 436.)\n       As an initial matter, respondent contends that appellant had no right to the\neffective assistance of counsel because this hearing was civil in nature. Appellant\ndisputes that assertion, contending that the state appointed counsel for him so it is logical\n\n\n\n                                              11.\n\fto assume competent representation was required. Appellant, however, admits that he\nhas not found any published opinions which address and resolve an ineffective assistance\nof counsel claim in the context of an involuntary medication order for a civilly committed\nperson.\n       We need not fully address the parties\u2019 dispute regarding whether or not appellant,\nas an SVP, enjoyed a federal constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel\nduring the hearing below. Instead, we will presume that such a right extended to him in\nthis situation. With the presumption in mind, we summarize appellant\u2019s constitutional\narguments before explaining why he does not demonstrate ineffective assistance of\ncounsel.\n              1.     A summary of appellant\u2019s constitutional arguments.\n       Appellant concedes that, under certain circumstances, the government may\ninvoluntarily medicate a prisoner or person who is civilly committed. He asserts,\nhowever, that federal law requires a showing of medical appropriateness (and, perhaps,\nmedical necessity). Because the trial court only focused on whether appellant lacked\ncapacity, and the court never considered whether or not the proposed medications were\nmedically appropriate, appellant contends that his federal due process rights were\nviolated.\n       Appellant also maintains that California law treats him disparately as an SVP\nwhen compared to a defendant who is incompetent to stand trial. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1370,\nsubd. (a)(2)(B)(i)(I).) He claims that a less stringent standard was used for his situation\nthan those standards used to involuntarily medicate a defendant who lacks capacity to\nassist in his own criminal trial. He contends that no \u201ccompelling governmental interest\u201d\ncould exist for California to treat SVP\u2019s differently from persons not competent to stand\ntrial. He argues we should reverse the trial court\u2019s order and remand this matter so the\n\n\n\n\n                                             12.\n\fcourt can employ the proper federal standards in determining whether it is appropriate for\nthe government to administer antipsychotic medications against his will.\n              2.        A summary of the applicable federal law.\n       Appellant\u2019s federal constitutional challenges stem from three United States\nSupreme Court opinions. First, in Washington v. Harper (1990) 494 U.S. 210 (Harper),\nthe Supreme Court held that convicted prisoners possess a significant liberty interest in\navoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs, and such drugs may be\ninvoluntarily administered only if the inmate is dangerous to himself or others, and the\ntreatment is in the inmate\u2019s medical interest. (Id. at p. 227.)\n       Second, in Riggins v. Nevada (1992) 504 U.S. 127 (Riggins), the Supreme Court\napplied Harper to a criminal defendant facing trial. The Riggins court reversed a murder\nconviction after concluding (1) there was an insufficient factual showing to support the\ninvoluntary medication order; and (2) the defendant was likely prejudiced at trial because\nthe antipsychotic drugs had an adverse effect on his demeanor and ability to testify.\n(Id. at pp. 137\u2013138.)\n       Finally, in Sell v. United States (2003) 539 U.S. 166 (Sell), the Supreme Court\nheld that, following Harper and Riggins, the federal Constitution permits the government\nto administer antipsychotic drugs involuntarily \u201cto a mentally ill defendant facing serious\ncriminal charges in order to render that defendant competent to stand trial, but only if the\ntreatment is medically appropriate, is substantially unlikely to have side effects that may\nundermine the fairness of the trial, and, taking account of less intrusive alternatives, is\nnecessary significantly to further important governmental trial-related interests.\u201d (Sell,\nsupra, 539 U.S. at p. 179.) The court acknowledged that the question of involuntary\nmedication to restore an accused\u2019s ability to stand trial is different from involuntarily\nmedicating an inmate who is dangerous to himself or others when the refusal to take the\nmedication puts his health gravely at risk. (Id. at pp. 181\u2013182.)\n\n\n\n                                             13.\n\f               3.    A summary of the applicable California law regarding the\n                     forced administration of antipsychotic drugs upon a criminal\n                     defendant.\n       Following Sell, the California Legislature amended Penal Code section 13705 to\ncomply with federal due process requirements. (People v. O\u2019Dell (2005) 126\nCal.App.4th 562, 569.) The Legislature added subdivisions governing the administration\nof antipsychotic medication. (People v. Lameed (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 381, 396.)\n       The Penal Code now directs a trial court to \u201chear and determine\u201d whether a\ncriminal defendant lacks capacity to make decisions regarding the administration of\nantipsychotic medication. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(2)(B).) A court must determine\nif any one of the following three sets of conditions or criteria are true. (Pen. Code,\n\u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(2)(B)(i).)\n       The first possible condition or criteria is as follows: The defendant lacks capacity\nto make decisions regarding antipsychotic medication; the defendant\u2019s mental disorder\nrequires medical treatment with antipsychotic medication; and, if the defendant\u2019s mental\ndisorder is not treated with antipsychotic medication, is it probable that serious harm to\nthe physical or mental health of the defendant will result.6 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1370, subd.\n(a)(2)(B)(i)(I).)\n       The second possible condition or criteria is as follows: The defendant is a danger\nto others.7 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(2)(B)(i)(II).)\n\n5      Penal Code section 1370 deals with criminal defendants who lack competency.\n6       \u201cProbability of serious harm to the physical or mental health of the defendant\nrequires evidence that the defendant is presently suffering adverse effects to his or her\nphysical or mental health, or the defendant has previously suffered these effects as a\nresult of a mental disorder and his or her condition is substantially deteriorating. The fact\nthat a defendant has a diagnosis of a mental disorder does not alone establish probability\nof serious harm to the physical or mental health of the defendant.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1370,\nsubd. (a)(2)(B)(i)(I).)\n7        The statute explains that this means the \u201cdefendant has inflicted, attempted to\ninflict, or made a serious threat of inflicting substantial physical harm on another while in\ncustody, or the defendant had inflicted, attempted to inflict, or made a serious threat of\n\n                                             14.\n\f       The final possible condition or criteria is as follows: \u201cThe people have charged\nthe defendant with a serious crime against the person or property, involuntary\nadministration of antipsychotic medication is substantially likely to render the defendant\ncompetent to stand trial, the medication is unlikely to have side effects that interfere with\nthe defendant\u2019s ability to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or to assist\ncounsel in the conduct of a defense in a reasonable manner, less intrusive treatments are\nunlikely to have substantially the same results, and antipsychotic medication is in the\npatient\u2019s best medical interest in light of his or her medical condition.\u201d (Pen. Code,\n\u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(2)(B)(i)(III).)\n       Appellant acknowledges that California law follows the federal due process\nstandards from Sell, Riggins and Harper when it comes to involuntarily administering\nantipsychotic medications to an accused person found mentally incompetent to assist in\nhis or her own trial. He argues, however, that California law, at least regarding the\ninvoluntary administration of antipsychotic medications to an SVP, is at odds with those\nfederal requirements. To understand appellant\u2019s assertions, we summarize the California\nlaw regarding the involuntary administration of antipsychotic medications to an SVP.\n              4.      A summary of the applicable California law regarding the\n                      forced administration of antipsychotic drugs upon an SVP.\n       Welfare and Institutions Code section 6600 et seq. sets forth authority for civilly\ncommitting a person designated as an SVP after they have completed a criminal sentence.\n(State Dept. of State Hospitals v. J.W. (2018) 31 Cal.App.5th 334, 341.) Under the\n\n\ninflicting substantial physical harm on another that resulted in his or her being taken into\ncustody, and the defendant presents, as a result of mental disorder or mental defect, a\ndemonstrated danger of inflicting substantial physical harm on others. Demonstrated\ndanger may be based on an assessment of the defendant\u2019s present mental condition,\nincluding a consideration of past behavior of the defendant within six years prior to the\ntime the defendant last attempted to inflict, inflicted, or threatened to inflict substantial\nphysical harm on another, and other relevant evidence.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1370, subd.\n(a)(2)(B)(i)(II).)\n\n\n                                             15.\n\fstatutory scheme, an SVP is \u201ca person who has been convicted of a sexually violent\noffense against one or more victims and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes\nthe person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will\nengage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d (Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1).)\nIn this context, a diagnosed mental disorder \u201cincludes a congenital or acquired condition\naffecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to the\ncommission of criminal sexual acts in a degree constituting the person a menace to the\nhealth and safety of others.\u201d (Id. at subd. (c).) It must be found beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the person qualifies as an SVP. (Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6603, subd. (f), 6604.)\nIf this standard is not met, the person shall be released at the end of their original\nsentence or period of parole. If it is met, the person is then \u201ccommitted for an\nindeterminate term to the custody of the State Department of State Hospitals for\nappropriate treatment and confinement.\u201d8 (Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7 6604.)\n       Under California law, a competent adult has a common law and constitutional\nright to refuse medical treatment, including the administration of antipsychotic drugs. (In\nre Qawi, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 14.) Relatedly, \u201cnonprisoners in California have a\nstatutory right to refuse long-term treatment with psychotropic drugs absent a judicial\ndetermination that they are incompetent to do so.\u201d (Keyhea v. Rushen (1986) 178\nCal.App.3d 526, 541.) However, an involuntarily committed patient may be forcibly\n\n\n8       Respondent asserts that appellant\u2019s treatment plan \u201chad already been decided at\nthe time he was committed to the state hospital for treatment.\u201d According to respondent,\ndue process did not \u201conce again\u201d require the lower court to make this determination.\nAppellant objects to these assertions, claiming no such determination ever occurred when\nhe was first hospitalized. We agree with appellant in this regard. Respondent fails to cite\nto the record establishing that appellant\u2019s current treatment plan had already been decided\nwhen he was committed to the state hospital for treatment. Welfare and Institutions Code\nsection 6606 merely requires the State Department of State Hospitals to provide\n\u201cprogramming\u201d to an SVP \u201cwhich shall afford the person with treatment for his or her\ndiagnosed mental disorder.\u201d (Welf. & Inst. Code, \u00a7 6606, subd. (a).)\n\n\n                                              16.\n\ftreated with antipsychotic medication if a court has determined that he is not competent\nto refuse treatment. (In re Qawi, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 14; In re Calhoun, supra, 121\nCal.App.4th at p. 1354.) \u201cThe right to refuse medication may be limited by\ncountervailing state interests such as caring for persons who are unable to care for\nthemselves and \u2018institutional security.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (In re Greenshields (2014) 227\nCal.App.4th 1284, 1289.)\n          In In re Qawi, our high court analyzed whether a mentally disordered offender\nunder the Mentally Disordered Offender Act (MDO Act)9 has the right under statutory\nlaw to refuse antipsychotic medication prescribed for his mental disorder in the absence\nof a judicial determination of his incapacity to make such a decision. (In re Qawi, supra,\n32 Cal.4th at p. 9.) The Supreme Court held that \u201can MDO can be compelled to take\nantipsychotic medication in a nonemergency situation only if a court, at the time the\nMDO is committed or recommitted, or in a separate proceeding, makes one of two\nfindings: (1) that the MDO is incompetent or incapable of making decisions about his\nmedical treatment; or (2) that the MDO is dangerous within the meaning of Welfare and\nInstitutions Code section 5300.\u201d (In re Qawi, supra, 32 Cal.4th at pp. 9\u201310.) In addition,\n\u201c[t]he rights of MDO\u2019s to refuse medication can be further limited by State Department\nof Mental Health regulations necessary to provide security for inpatient facilities.\u201d (Id. at\np. 10.)\n          Following In re Qawi, the Court of Appeal expanded this law to an SVP. An SVP\nmay refuse antipsychotic medication unless a court determines the person is\n(1) incompetent to refuse the treatment; or (2) dangerous within the meaning of Welfare\n\n\n\n\n9      The MDO Act requires \u201cthat offenders who have been convicted of violent crimes\nrelated to their mental disorders, and who continue to pose a danger to society, receive\nmental health treatment during and after the termination of their parole until their mental\ndisorder can be kept in remission.\u201d (In re Qawi, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 9.)\n\n\n                                             17.\n\fand Institutions Code section 5300.10 (In re Calhoun, supra, 121 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1354.) It was In re Calhoun which served as the legal basis for the government\u2019s\npetition in this matter.\n               5.     Appellant does not establish that his counsel had no rational\n                      tactical purpose for the alleged omissions and appellant does not\n                      show prejudice.\n       In ruling on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we are to defer to\ncounsel\u2019s reasonable tactical decisions, and there is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s\nconduct falls within the range of reasonable professional assistance. (People v. Lucas,\nsupra, 12 Cal.4th at pp. 436\u2013437.) An appellate court will reverse the conviction \u201conly if\nthe record on appeal affirmatively discloses that counsel had no rational tactical purpose\nfor his act or omission.\u201d (People v. Fosselman (1983) 33 Cal.3d 572, 581.) In\nconducting this review, the appellate court considers whether the record contains any\nexplanation for counsel\u2019s actions; if the record sheds no light on counsel\u2019s actions, the\nclaim is not cognizable unless counsel was asked for an explanation and failed to provide\none, or unless there could be no satisfactory explanation for the actions taken. (People v.\nMendoza Tello (1997) 15 Cal.4th 264, 266; People v. Kelly (1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 520.)\n       In this matter, this ineffective assistance claim is not cognizable on appeal because\nappellant\u2019s counsel was not asked for an explanation regarding his alleged failure to raise\nfederal constitutional standards, and we cannot state that there can be no satisfactory\nexplanation for the actions taken. Instead, appellant\u2019s counsel clearly attempted to\nestablish that appellant had capacity to refuse the medications. Appellant testified and\nexplained why he refused his treatment. During closing argument, appellant\u2019s counsel\nemphasized that appellant was aware that he suffered from a mental condition, and he\n\n10    In In re Greenshields, the same court that decided In re Calhoun held that persons\nwho are found not guilty by reason of insanity have the same constitutional right as\nMDO\u2019s and SVP\u2019s to refuse antipsychotic medication. (In re Greenshields, supra, 227\nCal.App.4th at p. 1287.)\n\n\n                                            18.\n\funderstood the effect certain medications have on him. According to appellant\u2019s counsel,\nappellant wanted to continue certain medications and discontinue other medications.\nAppellant\u2019s counsel asserted that appellant takes \u201ca lot of different factors into\nconsideration in making his decision as to what meds he should be on and what meds he\nshouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n       Appellant claims that his trial counsel \u201ccould have had no tactical reason for\nfailing to raise the two constitutional arguments.\u201d We disagree. It is possible that a\nreasonable attorney would have focused on the issue of capacity, and elected not to raise\nfederal constitutional arguments, in attempting to defeat the government\u2019s petition during\nthis initial bifurcated proceeding. Thus, it appears counsel made a reasonable tactical\ndecision, which we will not second-guess on appeal. (See People v. Kelly, supra, 1\nCal.4th at p. 520.) Consequently, appellant fails to establish that his counsel\u2019s\nperformance fell below an objective standard of reasonable competence. In any event,\neven if his counsel failed to act reasonably, appellant also fails to establish prejudice.\n       To show prejudice, a defendant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable\nprobability the result of the proceeding would have been different in the absence of\ncounsel\u2019s alleged errors. (People v. Majors (1998) 18 Cal.4th 385, 403.) \u201cA reasonable\nprobability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d (Ibid.)\n       Here, Chee\u2019s testimony established that appellant requires antipsychotic\nmedication. Appellant\u2019s drug regimen was \u201ca common combination for schizoaffective\ndisorder.\u201d Chee opined that less intrusive methods are not available.\n       Chee made it clear that, when appellant was not using his antipsychotic\nmedication, he suffers serious harm to his mental health, which abates when he was on\nhis recommended regimen. During a more recent conversation with appellant, appellant\nhad said \u201che heard voices all the time\u201d but objected to Chee\u2019s suggestions for the use of\nantipsychotics to treat his auditory hallucinations. Chee noted that, when appellant had\nstopped taking his medications altogether for about one week, there were a greater\n\n                                             19.\n\fnumber of \u201cincident reports\u201d involving appellant, and Chee had decided to start the\ninvoluntary medication process. Chee testified that it was important to keep appellant on\nhis medications because it is \u201cthe standard of treatment for his diagnosis and his mental\nillness and he has had a decrease in incidents since he began adhering to his medications\nagain.\u201d Chee\u2019s testimony amply demonstrated that the antipsychotic medication was\nmedically appropriate for appellant, if not necessary.\n       Appellant claims that \u201cthe government was required by the federal constitution to\nprove medical necessity in order to involuntarily medicate him.\u201d Regarding forfeiture (or\nwaiver), he asserts that his silence could not result in losing this right, which he equates\nas a required element for the government to prove. We reject this assertion.\n       The three federal cases upon which appellant relies, Sell, Riggins, and Harper, did\nnot address the circumstances upon which a civilly committed patient may be\ninvoluntarily administered antipsychotic drugs. Indeed, the Sell court noted that \u201ccourts\ntypically address involuntary medical treatment as a civil matter, and justify it on these\nalternative, Harper-type grounds. Every State provides avenues through which, for\nexample, a doctor or institution can seek appointment of a guardian with the power to\nmake a decision authorizing medication\u2014when in the best interests of a patient who\nlacks the mental competence to make such a decision.\u201d11 (Sell, supra, 539 U.S. at\np. 182.)\n       Although we have reservations regarding whether appellant is correct that the\nrequirements in Sell, Riggins, and Harper apply to an SVP, we need not fully analyze the\nmerits of his assertion. Instead, in light of this record, it is not reasonably probable the\ntrial court would have denied the government\u2019s petition even if appellant\u2019s counsel had\nraised the federal constitutional arguments which he now advances in this appeal. Our\n\n11     The Sell court also noted that, in civil proceedings, a court may authorize\ninvoluntary medication \u201cwhere the patient\u2019s failure to accept treatment threatens injury to\nthe patient or others.\u201d (Sell, supra, 539 U.S. at p. 182.)\n\n\n                                              20.\n\fconfidence in the outcome of this matter is not undermined. As such, ineffective\nassistance of counsel is not present, and appellant\u2019s claims must fail. His federal\nconstitutional challenges, which he failed to raise below, are deemed forfeited.\nII.    Substantial Evidence Supports The Trial Court\u2019s Order.\n       Appellant contends that the trial court imposed the wrong standards in issuing its\norder, and he asserts that substantial evidence does not support it.\n       A.     Standard of review.\n       An appellate court reviews an order authorizing involuntary administration of\nantipsychotic medication for substantial evidence. (State Dept. of State Hospitals v. J.W.,\nsupra, 31 Cal.App.5th at p. 344.) Such evidence must be reasonable, credible and of\nsolid value. We cannot reverse the judgment merely because the evidence could be\nreconciled with a contrary finding. (People v. D'Arcy (2010) 48 Cal.4th 257, 293.)\n       B.     Analysis.\n       When ruling in this matter, the trial court stated it did not know if appellant was\nreading some medical literature when questioning Chee\u2019s judgment. The court said it\nwas appellant\u2019s right to do that as a patient, but the court expressed the following\nconcern: \u201cHowever, when it gets to the point where the\u2014it becomes either refusals or\nrefusals to take certain medications where the health \u2026 of [appellant\u2019s health is] at stake\nand the health and safety of the public and those at the Department of State Hospitals [is]\nat stake, [appellant] has to yield.\u201d\n       Appellant asserts that the trial court ordered him involuntarily medicated \u201csimply\nbecause he chose not to agree to the medications his doctors wished him to take.\u201d He\ncontends that his \u201calleged dangerousness\u201d was not at issue during this bifurcated\nproceeding, and he argues that the court\u2019s \u201cconcern about the safety of the hospital was\ncompletely irrelevant.\u201d He claims that the court\u2019s analysis was flawed because it\nassumed that he lacked capacity merely because he chose to weigh the dangers of the side\n\n\n\n                                             21.\n\feffects against the benefits of the medications, only to reach a different conclusion from\nthe doctor. He maintains that the court implicitly determined that a \u201cmere refusal to go\nalong with the medical recommendations of the treating psychiatrist proves the existence\nof a lack of capacity.\u201d Finally, appellant asserts that the trial court failed to consider the\nrequired factors necessary to find a lack of capacity.12 He contends that nothing shows\nhis refusal was delusional. He argues that the trial court \u201csimply rubber stamped\u201d the\nhospital\u2019s decision to involuntarily medicate him.\n       We disagree with appellant\u2019s numerous arguments. \u201cA judicial determination of\ncompetency to refuse treatment involves consideration of three factors: (1) whether the\npatient is aware of his situation and acknowledges the existence of his condition;\n(2) whether the patient understands the benefits and risks of treatment, as well as\nalternatives to treatment; and (3) whether the patient is able to understand and evaluate\nthe information required to be given to patients whose informed consent is sought and\nparticipate in the treatment decision by rational thought processes.\u201d13 (State Dept. of\nState Hospitals v. J.W., supra, 31 Cal.App.5th at p. 344, citing Riese v. St. Mary\u2019s\nHospital & Medical Center, supra, 209 Cal.App.3d 1303, 1322\u20131323.)\n       A superior court must use a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidentiary standard to\ndetermine if a committed patient is competent to refuse treatment. (State Dept. of State\nHospitals v. J.W., supra, 31 Cal.App.5th at p. 343.) Under this standard, the evidence\nmust be \u201cso clear as to leave no substantial doubt, [and] sufficiently strong to command\n\n\n\n12    Appellant, however, concedes that, in this context, there is \u201cno clear definition\u201d of\nhow capacity or competency is defined under California case law.\n13     At least one appellate court has concluded that, with respect to the last\nconsideration, it should be assumed that the patient is using rational modes of thought\nunless a clear link is shown between his or her delusional or hallucinatory perceptions\nand the ultimate decision regarding medical treatment. (Riese v. St. Mary\u2019s Hospital &\nMedical Center (1987) 209 Cal.App.3d 1303, 1323.)\n\n\n                                              22.\n\fthe unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.\u201d (Conservatorship of Waltz (1986) 180\nCal.App.3d 722, 733, fn. 14.)\n       We reject appellant\u2019s claim that the court found a lack of capacity merely because\nappellant had disagreed with his medical team. The court determined that appellant is\n\u201cgenerally aware\u201d that he has a mental illness, but \u201che\u2019s not acutely aware of his\nsituation. He has a general understanding of the benefits and risks of some of the\ntreatments but not all of the treatment, and he has a tendency to substitute his judgment\nfor the judgment of the doctors when it\u2019s\u2014he believes\u2014well, whenever he believes it\u2019s\nbeneficial to him.\u201d The court found by \u201cclear and convincing evidence that [appellant is]\nnot able to understand and knowingly and intelligently and rationally evaluate and\nparticipate in his treatment decision at this time.\u201d\n       Although the court did not articulate the three factors outlined in case law to\ndetermine appellant\u2019s competency, substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s ruling. Chee\ntestified that appellant had recently expressed disbelief that he had a mental illness.\nDuring a more recent conversation with him, appellant said \u201che heard voices all the time\u201d\nbut objected to Chee\u2019s suggestion for the use of antipsychotics to treat his auditory\nhallucinations. Chee thought appellant was aware he had a psychiatric condition, but\nappellant did not necessarily agree with the clinical team.\n       Chee testified that he had discussed the risks and benefits of the drugs with\nappellant as \u201cbest as I could.\u201d In Chee\u2019s opinion, appellant was unable to understand the\nbenefits and risks of taking or not taking the psychotropic medications. Appellant was\nalso not capable of understanding, participating and evaluating the information provided\nto him with respect to his mental condition and treatment options. Chee explained that\nappellant \u201chas his opinion as to what the risks and benefits of his medications are and\nthey do not necessarily coincide with what we or what I feel like he needs to be taking to\nmaintain his stability.\u201d Chee noted that, when appellant had stopped taking his\nmedications altogether for about one week, there were a greater number of \u201cincident\n\n                                             23.\n\freports\u201d involving appellant, and Chee had decided to start the involuntary medication\nprocess.\n       Chee informed the court that less intrusive methods were not available for a\nstandard treatment of schizoaffective disorder. He further opined that appellant was\nunable to knowingly and intelligently give informed consent regarding his treatment.\nChee stated it was his professional opinion that appellant should be administered\npsychotropic medication involuntarily if he refused to take the prescribed medication.\nThe goal was to keep him \u201con the same scheduled medications that he has been on since\nbefore the start of his involuntary medication via hospital panel. The goal is not to\nincrease his medications or whatnot. It is simply to make sure that he adheres to the\nmedication . . . he has been on.\u201d Chee testified that it was important to keep appellant on\nhis medications because it is \u201cthe standard of treatment for his diagnosis and his mental\nillness and he has had a decrease in incidents since he began adhering to his medications\nagain.\u201d\n       Finally, appellant told the court that the benefits of paliperidone, an antipsychotic,\nwere \u201cillusional.\u201d He compared it to \u201cdrinking water\u201d because it does not \u201cdo anything.\u201d\n       The evidence from the hearing, and especially from Chee\u2019s testimony, represented\nsubstantial evidence supporting the three factors necessary for the trial court to have ruled\nthat appellant lacked capacity. The evidence established that (1) appellant was not aware\nof his situation and he did not acknowledge his condition; (2) he did not understand the\nbenefits and risks of treatment, as well as alternatives to treatment; and (3) he did not\nunderstand and could not evaluate the information, and he could not participate in the\ntreatment decision by rational thought processes. (See State Dept. of State Hospitals v.\nJ.W., supra, 31 Cal.App.5th at pp. 343\u2013344.)\n       Appellant contends that Chee never connected his refusal to take the medications\nto any \u201cdelusional beliefs.\u201d According to appellant, he refused the medication because he\nwanted to avoid the side effects. He concedes that some of his testimony contains\n\n                                             24.\n\fmaterial \u201cthat can be viewed as delusional,\u201d but he argues that it was not delusion for him\nto want to avoid unpleasant side effects. He maintains that he did recognize that he\nsuffers from a mental illness, and he recognized \u201cat least some symptoms of his mental\nillness and knows the side effects of the medicines the doctors want him to take.\u201d He\nargues that, if he is not allowed to refuse these medications, then the \u201centire process\u201d\nunderlying these hearings \u201cbecomes a fraud.\u201d\n       Appellant further notes that, given the state of the evidence, the trial court could\nhave decided to deny the government\u2019s petition. He contends that the court could have\ndetermined that he \u201cwas making a knowing and intelligent evaluation of the information\nabout the medication to reach a conclusion that while, perhaps, suboptimal, was not\nindicative of a lack of capacity to make a decision.\u201d Appellant asserts that he \u201coffered a\nrational explanation for his short term decision to stop taking medications completely.\u201d\n       We decline appellant\u2019s invitation to second-guess how the trial court should have\nviewed the testimony. Although Chee never expressly opined whether or not appellant\u2019s\ndelusional or hallucinatory perceptions were linked to his ultimate decision regarding\nmedical care, the totality of this record demonstrates that appellant was not capable of\nevaluating the information provided to him, or understanding and participating regarding\nhis mental condition and treatment options. Moreover, when searching for substantial\nevidence, we will neither reweigh the evidence nor reevaluate witness credibility. We\ncannot reverse the court\u2019s order merely because the evidence could be reconciled with a\ncontrary finding. (See People v. D'Arcy, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 293 [applying that\nstandard for a judgment].) The court clearly found Chee\u2019s testimony credible, and it\nrejected appellant\u2019s testimony. We will not disturb how the court weighed the evidence\nor the credibility of the two witnesses.\n       Based on this record, the trial court\u2019s ruling had evidentiary support that was\nreasonable, credible and of solid value. A reasonable fact finder could have concluded\nbased on clear and convincing evidence that appellant lacked capacity to refuse the\n\n                                             25.\n\fadministration of antipsychotic drugs. As such, substantial evidence appears in this\nrecord. Accordingly, we will not reverse the court\u2019s order, and appellant\u2019s various\nassertions are without merit.\n                                    DISPOSITION\n       The court\u2019s order appealed from is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           26.\n\f",
