JACK SKEEN, JR., PRESIDING\r\n\r\n\r\n_______________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMemorandum Opinion\r\n\r\n\r\n_______________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore QUINN, C.J., and CAMPBELL and HANCOCK, JJ.\r\n\r\n\tAppellant, Richard Calvin Gipson, challenges his conviction for intoxication\r\nmanslaughter through four issues.  The first two pertain to the legal and factual\r\ninsufficiency of the evidence.  The third concerns the trial court's admission of expert\r\nevidence, while the fourth involves the quantum of punishment he received.  We affirm the\r\njudgment. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tSufficiency of the Evidence\r\n\r\n\tAccording to appellant, the record lacks sufficient evidence to establish that he was\r\nintoxicated at the time of the accident or that his conduct caused the accident.  We\r\ndisagree and overrule the issue.\r\n\r\n\tThe record contains evidence of the following.  On September 23, 2004, around\r\n5:30 a.m., appellant was driving on the wrong side of the highway between Kilgore and\r\nTyler.  He initially knocked off the driver's side mirror of a vehicle driven by Michelle\r\nHenckel but she was able to swerve and avoid a collision.  However, appellant collided with\r\nthe vehicle behind Henckel, which vehicle was driven by Charlotte Bryan.  Ms. Bryan was\r\npronounced dead at the scene.  Thereafter, cocaine, cocoethylene (a product of the use\r\nof cocaine and alcohol), marihuana, and benzodiazepine (a central nervous system\r\ndepressant) were found in appellant's system.  The State also presented testimony that\r\nappellant 1) was speeding, 2) had driven over 300 feet in the wrong lane of traffic, 3) never\r\nattempted to swerve back into his own lane or brake even after striking the mirror on the\r\nvehicle driven by Henckel, 4) acted abnormally after the accident by calmly smoking a\r\ncigarette in the presence of leaking automobile fluids even though he was pinned in the\r\nvehicle for a considerable time and had suffered a broken leg, 5) thought others hit him,\r\n6) had a crack pipe in his vehicle, 7) had used benzodiazepine at least within the last 72\r\nhours, and 8) had a sufficient quantum of cocaine on or near his person to illustrate that\r\nhe was either a heavy user or had used cocaine within 24 hours of his specimen.  So too\r\ndid a drug recognition expert testify that based on all of the information available to him,\r\nhe believed that appellant was intoxicated at the time of the accident.  The foregoing is\r\nsome evidence upon which a reasonable jury could rationally conclude that appellant was\r\nintoxicated and that the intoxication caused the wreck that killed Ms. Bryan.  \r\n\r\n\tOne is intoxicated if he is does not have \"the normal use of [his] mental or physical\r\nfaculties by reason of the introduction of alcohol, a controlled substance, a drug, a\r\ndangerous drug, a combination of two or more of those substances, or any other\r\nsubstance in his body.\"  Tex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a749.01 (2)(A) (Vernon 2003).  The presence\r\nof drugs within appellant's body, his erratic driving, his failure to stop after colliding with\r\nother objects, his odd demeanor after the accident, and his lack of grasp of the\r\ncircumstances provide the necessary foundation for his conviction. \r\n\r\n\tAlthough other evidence suggested that appellant's vehicle had an under-inflated\r\ntire and had been subject to a recall notice with respect to a defect that could have caused\r\nthe engine to stop running, no evidence appears illustrating that appellant's vehicle actually\r\nsuffered from the defect encompassed within the recall notice at the time of the collision. \r\nFurthermore, the State presented evidence that appellant would have been able to steer\r\nthe vehicle at a high speed even if the engine had stopped immediately preceding the\r\ncollision and even with an under-inflated tire. This, combined with the information already\r\nsummarized above, prevents us from concluding that the evidence of guilt was weak or\r\nthat the verdict was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.  \r\n\r\n\tAdmission of Expert Testimony\r\n\r\n\tNext, appellant complains about the admission of Sergeant Jimmy Jackson's\r\ntestimony.  The witness was offered by the State as a drug recognition expert.  Below,\r\nappellant argued that Jackson was not qualified to be an expert.  Here, however, he says\r\nnothing about the sergeant's qualifications but rather attacks the protocol used by the\r\nwitness to derive his conclusions.  That topic was not mentioned below as a basis for his\r\nobjection.  Having gone unmentioned at trial, it was not preserved for review.  Washington\r\nv. State, 152 S.W.3d 209, 213 (Tex. App.-Amarillo 2004, no pet.).  \r\n\r\n\tDisproportionate Sentence\r\n\r\n\tFinally, appellant contends that the life sentence he received for killing another while\r\ndriving in an intoxicated state was disproportionate or excessive despite his prior\r\nconviction.  Like the foregoing complaint, this too went unmentioned below.  Thus, it too\r\nwas not preserved for review.  See Rhoades v. State, 934 S.W.2d 113, 120 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. 1996) (failing to object to punishment as cruel and unusual); Harvey v. State, 173\r\nS.W.3d 841, 850 (Tex. App.-Texarkana 2005, no pet.) (failing to make objection that court\r\nconsidered matters outside the record in assessing the punishment).\r\n\r\n\tIn sum, all of appellant's issues are overruled, and the judgment is affirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrian Quinn\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t          Chief Justice\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not publish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n",
