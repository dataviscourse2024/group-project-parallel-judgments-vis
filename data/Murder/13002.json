Marnocha, Judge\n                             Cause No. 71D01-1208-MR-11\n\n\n                                          February 12, 2013\n\n                 MEMORANDUM DECISION - NOT FOR PUBLICATION\n\nFRIEDLANDER, Judge\n\f        Tarrence Lee appeals the denial of his motion to set bail, raising for our review the\n\nsole question of whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying that motion.1 Finding\n\nno abuse of discretion, we affirm.\n\n        Lee and Trina Winston were married in April 2012, and by June of the same year,\n\nWinston had filed for divorce and obtained a protective order against Lee after suffering\n\nmultiple severe beatings at his hands. Winston then moved into the home of Andre Banks.\n\nLate on the evening on August 15, 2012, Lee came to Banks\u2019s house to speak with Winston.\n\nWinston got into Lee\u2019s car and the two left together. This was the last time Winston was\n\nseen alive.\n\n        In the early morning hours of August 18, 2012, Andre O\u2019Neil contacted the police and\n\ninformed them that he had seen Winston\u2019s dead body in Lee\u2019s apartment. Specifically,\n\nO\u2019Neil indicated that on the evening of August 16, 2012, he had been at a park with Lee,\n\nJames Johnson III, and Lee\u2019s brother, Anthony Lee (Anthony), when Lee told the men that he\n\nneeded their help with something at his apartment. Upon arriving at Lee\u2019s apartment, the\n\nmen saw Winston\u2019s \u201cobviously dead\u201d body wrapped in a blanket on the floor of the\n\napartment\u2019s living room. Appellant\u2019s Appendix at 7. O\u2019Neil indicated that he did not want to\n\n\n\n\n1\n The State cross-appeals, arguing that this appeal should be dismissed as moot because Lee has now been\nconvicted following a bench trial. In support of this argument, the State has submitted an Appellee\u2019s Appendix\ncontaining what appears to be a judgment of conviction. The judgment, however, is file-stamped by the St.\nJoseph Superior Court on November 21, 2012. The Notice of Completion of Clerk\u2019s Record was filed in this\nappeal nearly a month prior to that date, and there is no indication that the record was ever supplemented or\namended. Thus, it is apparent that the materials relied on by the State in support of its argument that this\nappeal is moot are not part of the record. Because these materials are not properly before us, we will not\nconsider them. See Haste v. State, 967 N.E.2d 576 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012). Accordingly, we will address Lee\u2019s\nappeal on the merits.\n\n                                                      2\n\fbe involved, and then left the apartment. Initially, O\u2019Neil did not know what to do, but he\n\nlater contacted the police.\n\n          Police then interviewed Johnson and Anthony. Johnson and Anthony both stated that\n\nthey helped Lee carry Winston\u2019s body out of the apartment and place it in the trunk of Lee\u2019s\n\ncar. The three then drove to Illinois, where they disposed of Winston\u2019s body. Lee stated that\n\nhe wanted to leave the body in the Chicago area because he believed the death would receive\n\nless investigation there. Johnson also told police about a number of incriminating statements\n\nLee made concerning Winston\u2019s death. For example, Johnson stated that Lee said that\n\nWinston was \u201ca whore,\u201d that she had slept with multiple men at one time, and that \u201cshe\n\npushed him to the point where he did what he did.\u201d Transcript at 43, 44. Johnson also stated\n\nthat Lee had threatened O\u2019Neil, telling him that he could end up like Winston.\n\n          On August 20, 2012, the State charged Lee with murder. 2 On August 28, 2012, Lee\n\nfiled a motion to set bail. A hearing was held on October 1, 2012, at which the State\n\npresented the testimony of investigating Officer Anthony Bontrager. Officer Bontrager\n\ntestified concerning the statements he had taken from O\u2019Neil, Johnson, and Anthony, as well\n\nas additional evidence he had gathered. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court\n\ndenied the motion to set bail. Lee now appeals.\n\n          Article 1, section 17 of the Indiana Constitution provides that \u201c[o]ffenses, other than\n\nmurder or treason, shall be bailable by sufficient sureties. Murder or treason shall not be\n\nbailable, when the proof is evident, or the presumption strong.\u201d Ind. Code Ann. \u00a7 35-33-8-\n\n\n2\n    Ind. Code Ann. \u00a7 35-42-1-1 (West, Westlaw current through 2012 2nd Reg. Sess.).\n\n                                                     3\n\f2(a) (West, Westlaw current through 2012 2nd Reg. Sess.) codifies this constitutional\n\nguarantee as follows: \u201cMurder is not bailable when the proof is evident or the presumption\n\nstrong. In all other cases, offenses are bailable.\u201d This language has been interpreted as\n\ncreating a presumption that bail should not be granted in murder cases. Bei Bei Shuai v.\n\nState, 966 N.E.2d 619 (Ind. Ct. App. 2012), trans. denied. The defendant bears the burden of\n\novercoming this presumption by showing that the proof is not evident and the presumption is\n\nnot strong. Id.; I.C. \u00a7 35-33-8-2(b). We review a trial court\u2019s denial of bail in a murder case\n\nonly for an abuse of discretion. Bei Bei Shuai v. State, 966 N.E.2d 619. Accordingly, we\n\nwill reverse only when the decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and\n\ncircumstances before the trial court. Id.\n\n       On appeal, Lee argues that there was no evidence presented to establish that a murder\n\ntook place. Specifically, Lee claims that \u201c[t]here is nothing in the affidavit that points to any\n\nphysical evidence that supports the State\u2019s contention that the victim was killed. There is\n\nnothing in the affidavit to show how she died or for that matter that her death was caused by\n\nthe defendant.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 9. We disagree.\n\n       The State presented evidence that Winston left Banks\u2019s house with Lee on the night of\n\nAugust 15, 2012 and was thereafter never heard from again. The next evening, Lee solicited\n\nthe help of O\u2019Neil, Johnson, and Anthony in removing Winston\u2019s dead body from his\n\napartment.    In the course of disposing of Winston\u2019s body, Lee made a number of\n\nincriminating statements, saying Winston was \u201ca whore,\u201d that she had slept with multiple\n\nmen, and that \u201cshe pushed him to the point where he did what he did.\u201d Transcript at 43, 44.\n\n\n                                               4\n\fLee also threatened O\u2019Neil by telling him that he could end up like Winston. Additionally,\n\nLee stated that he wanted to dispose of Winston\u2019s body in the Chicago area because he\n\nbelieved a \u201cJane Doe\u201d would not be extensively investigated there. Id. at 44. Cell phone\n\nrecords indicated that Lee\u2019s cell phone was used in Illinois at approximately 11:30 p.m. on\n\nAugust 16, 2012. The State also presented evidence that Winston had recently filed for\n\ndivorce, and that Lee had been extremely violent toward her in the past and threatened to kill\n\nher on at least one occasion.\n\n       Under these facts and circumstances, we cannot say that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in concluding that Lee had not satisfied his burden of showing that the proof was\n\nnot evident and the presumption of guilt was not strong. Accordingly, the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying Lee\u2019s motion to set bail.\n\n       Judgment affirmed.\n\nNAJAM, J., and BRADFORD, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f",
