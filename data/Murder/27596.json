On appeal,\n29   Rasheed argues that venue was improper in the Western District of New York,\n30   that certain statements to the jury deprived him of a fair trial, and that the\n31   District Court erred in calculating his advisory sentencing range and in imposing\n32   three conditions of supervised release, including a standard risk-notification\n33   condition that has since been modified district-wide in a standing order of the\n34   Western District of New York to correct a legal infirmity. For the reasons that\n35   follow, we AFFIRM the judgment as modified by the Western District of New\n36   York\u2019s standing order.\n\n\n\n                                              1\n\f 1\n 2                             MARTIN J.

For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment as modified\n\n 3   by the Western District of New York\u2019s standing order.\n\n 4                                    BACKGROUND\n\n 5         In March 2015 the District Court sentenced Rasheed to a twelve-month\n\n 6   term of imprisonment for violating conditions of a federal term of supervised\n\n 7   release. He was initially incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary Lee (USP\n\n 8   Lee) in Jonesville, Virginia.\n\n 9         In February 2016 Rasheed became eligible to serve the remainder of his\n\n10   custodial sentence at a residential reentry center (RRC), an institutional facility\n\n11   contracted by the United States Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to provide inmates\n\n12   nearing the end of their custodial sentences with helpful programs and services\n\n13   to facilitate reentry into the community. While assigned to an RRC, inmates\n\n14   remain in BOP custody and are authorized to leave the facility only with prior\n\n15   approval. Rasheed applied and was approved to serve the remainder of his\n\n16   sentence at Volunteers of America (VOA), an RRC in Rochester, New York,\n\n17   which is located in the Western District of New York. He was granted an\n\n18   unaccompanied furlough to travel there from USP Lee.\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\f 1         Rasheed\u2019s furlough agreement outlined the conditions of his furlough and\n\n 2   his approved travel schedule. He was scheduled to depart USP Lee at 7:00 a.m.\n\n 3   on March 1, 2016 with a town driver, who would drive him to a bus station in\n\n4    Kingsport, Tennessee; from there, Rasheed was scheduled to travel by bus\n\n5    departing Kingsport at 9:10 a.m. and arriving in Rochester by 11:50 a.m. the\n\n6    following day, with specified layovers and transfers en route; and he was\n\n7    required to report to VOA, which was walking distance from the Rochester bus\n\n8    station, no later than 12:00 p.m. on March 2, 2016.\n\n 9         Rasheed signed a statement on his furlough application indicating that he\n\n10   understood that the \u201dfurlough only extend[ed] the limits of [his] confinement\n\n11   and that [he would] remain in the custody of the Attorney General of the United\n\n12   States\u201d at all times. Ex. App\u2019x at 3. He further agreed that any \u201cfail[ure] to\n\n13   remain within the extended limits of this confinement . . . shall be deemed as\n\n14   escape from custody of the Attorney General,\u201d punishable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751\n\n15   and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4082. Id.; see id. at 4.\n\n16         On March 1, 2016, Rasheed left USP Lee, equipped with his itinerary, bus\n\n17   tickets, and a debit card worth about $50, but he failed to report to VOA in\n\n18   Rochester. By April 4, 2016, a task force coordinated by the United States\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f 1   Marshal Services (USMS) still had not located him, and a warrant for his arrest\n\n 2   was issued.\n\n 3         In late October 2016, nearly eight months after Rasheed failed to report to\n\n 4   VOA, USMS discovered that Rasheed was in jail in Allegheny County,\n\n 5   Pennsylvania, having been arrested in connection with a fatal shooting in\n\n 6   Pittsburgh. Rasheed was later charged in Pennsylvania state court with multiple\n\n 7   felonies; he eventually pleaded guilty to, among other charges, third-degree\n\n 8   murder and aggravated assault.\n\n 9         In November 2016 a grand jury in the Western District of New York\n\n10   indicted Rasheed on one count of escape, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 751(a) and\n\n11   4082(a). Rasheed elected to proceed to trial. During the trial he and the\n\n12   Government stipulated that in 2015 Rasheed had been convicted of federal\n\n13   offenses in the Western District of New York and sentenced to a term of\n\n14   imprisonment and supervised release. The parties further stipulated that, as a\n\n15   result of his sentence, Rasheed \u201cwas committed to the custody of the United\n\n16   States Bureau of Prisons, where he was lawfully confined in an institution and\n\n17   facility at the direction of the Attorney General.\u201d Ex. App\u2019x at 1.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f 1            At the close of the Government\u2019s case, Rasheed moved for a judgment of\n\n 2   acquittal. He argued that the Government had failed to prove venue because\n\n 3   there was no evidence that Rasheed \u201cwas ever in the Western District of New\n\n4    York\u201d and, therefore, \u201cno crime [was] committed [t]here.\u201d Joint App\u2019x at 433.\n\n5    The Government replied that venue was proper because Rasheed was charged\n\n 6   with \u201cfail[ing] to remain within the extended limits of his confinement.\u201d Id. at\n\n 7   434. And after March 2, 2016, the Government contended, the VOA RRC, which\n\n8    is located in the Western District of New York, comprised \u201cthe limits of his\n\n 9   confinement.\u201d Id. The District Court considered the issue of venue in the case of\n\n10   an escape from an unaccompanied transfer to be an \u201copen question\u201d in this\n\n11   Circuit, but it agreed with the Government and denied Rasheed\u2019s motion. Id. at\n\n12   435.\n\n13            Before the jury began to deliberate, the District Court denied Rasheed\u2019s\n\n14   nunc pro tunc motion for a mistrial based on two statements that the District\n\n15   Court had made during jury selection, the first alerting prospective jurors that\n\n16   Rasheed was currently in custody, and the second directing them not to consider\n\n17   that fact as bearing on Rasheed\u2019s guilt or innocence. 1 In denying the motion at\n\n\n     1   The two statements were as follows:\n\n\n                                                6\n\f1   such a late stage of the trial, the District Court provided the following curative\n\n2   jury instruction, which both parties found acceptable: \u201c[T]he fact that Mr.\n\n3   Rasheed is in custody has no bearing on your determination of his guilt or\n\n4   nonguilt of the charge for which he stands accused and must not be considered\n\n5   by you in any way in reaching your verdict.\u201d Id. at 499. The jury quickly\n\n6   returned a guilty verdict on the escape charge.\n\n\n\n\n          I told you, for example\u2014it\u2019s no big secret\u2014Mr. Rasheed was in custody.\n          He had committed a crime, a felony. That\u2019s why he was in prison and I\u2019m\n          also telling you that you can\u2019t consider that fact, in and of itself, as a basis\n          to find him guilty, you can\u2019t say, ah, I\u2019ve heard enough. I\u2019ll ask [if] you can\n          . . . do that.\n    Joint App\u2019x at 132. And:\n          Why is the Marshal here because if you haven\u2019t figured it out by now,\n          believe me you would figure it out shortly that Mr. Rasheed is in custody.\n          All right. I\u2019m telling you that. And I\u2019m also telling you this: The fact that\n          he\u2019s in custody has nothing to do with his guilt or nonguilt. Do you all\n          understand that? (Jurors saying yes.) You know, I\u2019m a firm believer in\n          raising these issues because I don\u2019t want to leave anything to speculation,\n          you can\u2019t go back there in the jury room and say oh, he\u2019s in custody, he\n          must have done something. No. That has no bearing on his guilt or\n          nonguilt in this case. And . . . here\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to drive home. If you\n          . . . make up your mind and say, oh, the guy\u2019s been arrested he must have\n          done something, he\u2019s in custody he must have done something, then we\u2019re\n          wasting our time here. Make sense? Then we\u2019re truly wasting our time\n          because the way our system works is you, if you\u2019re on this jury, have to\n          make that determination based on what comes out in court as to whether\n          the government has proven his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Can you\n          all do that? (Jurors nodding yes.)\n    Id. at 228\u201329. Defense counsel objected outside the presence of the jury.\n                                                 7\n\f 1         At sentencing, the Government advocated for a statutory maximum\n\n 2   sentence of sixty months\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutively to all other\n\n 3   state and federal sentences previously imposed on Rasheed. Defense counsel\n\n4    urged the District Court to impose a sentence concurrent to Rasheed\u2019s\n\n5    undischarged state term of imprisonment, but counsel did not otherwise\n\n6    challenge the calculation of Rasheed\u2019s Guidelines range of thirty to thirty-seven\n\n7    months. The District Court ultimately imposed an above-Guidelines sentence of\n\n8    sixty months\u2019 imprisonment, to run consecutively to Rasheed\u2019s Pennsylvania\n\n9    state sentence, and a three-year term of supervised release.\n\n10         As relevant to this appeal, the judgment also included two special\n\n11   conditions of supervised release, each of which required Rasheed to participate\n\n12   in treatment programs and \u201cto contribute to the cost of services rendered\u201d by\n\n13   those programs. Sp. App\u2019x at 5. A third, standard condition of supervised\n\n14   release warned Rasheed that \u201c[i]f the probation officer determines that you pose\n\n15   a risk to another person (including an organization), the probation officer may\n\n16   require you to notify the person about the risk.\u201d Id. at 4.\n\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f 1                                       DISCUSSION\n\n 2            On appeal, Rasheed challenges his conviction based on improper venue\n\n 3   and on due process grounds. He also challenges his sentence based on asserted\n\n4    errors in the calculation of the advisory Guidelines range and the District Court\u2019s\n\n5    imposition of the cost-contribution and risk-notification conditions of supervised\n\n6    release. We address each of these challenges in turn.\n\n7                                               I\n\n 8            \u2018\u2018[V]enue in federal criminal cases is controlled by a complicated interplay\n\n 9   of constitutional provisions, statutes, and rules.\u2019\u2019 United States v. Rowe, 414 F.3d\n\n10   271, 277 (2d Cir. 2005) (quotation marks omitted). A criminal defendant must be\n\n11   tried in the district where the crime was committed. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Fed.\n\n12   R. Crim. P. 18. The government bears the burden to prove by a preponderance of\n\n13   the evidence that venue is proper in the district of prosecution. United States v.\n\n14   Kirk Tang Yuk, 885 F.3d 57, 71 (2d Cir. 2018). Because the relevant facts in this\n\n15   case are not in dispute, Rasheed\u2019s venue challenge presents a question of law,\n\n16   which we review de novo. United States v. Tzolov, 642 F.3d 314, 318 (2d Cir.\n\n17   2011).\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f 1         As an initial matter, we consider whether the crime of conviction itself tells\n\n 2   us how to determine the situs of the crime. Recall that Rasheed was charged\n\n 3   with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 751(a) and 4082(a). Section 751(a) criminalizes an\n\n 4   \u201cescape[] or attempt[] to escape from the custody of the Attorney General or his\n\n 5   authorized representative, or from any institution or facility in which he is\n\n 6   confined by direction of the Attorney General.\u201d Section 4082(a), in turn, provides\n\n 7   that \u201c[t]he willful failure of a prisoner to remain within the extended limits of his\n\n 8   confinement, or to return within the time prescribed to an institution or facility\n\n 9   designated by the Attorney General, shall be deemed an escape from the custody\n\n10   of the Attorney General\u201d within the meaning of section 751(a).\n\n11         Because the statute defining Rasheed\u2019s offense \u201cdoes not specify how to\n\n12   determine where the crime was committed,\u201d we look to \u201cthe nature of the crime\n\n13   alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.\u201d United States v. Lange,\n\n14   834 F.3d 58, 68 (2d Cir. 2016) (quotation marks omitted). In doing so, we keep in\n\n15   mind that \u201c[v]enue is proper only where the acts constituting the offense\u2014the\n\n16   crime\u2019s essential conduct elements\u2014took place.\u201d Tzolov, 642 F.3d at 318\n\n17   (quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f 1         Of course, where the nature of the offense and the essential conduct\n\n 2   elements implicate multiple locations, venue may lie in more than one district.\n\n 3   See Lange, 834 F.3d at 68\u201369. Thus \u201can offense \u2018begun in one district and\n\n 4   completed in another, or committed in more than one district, may be . . .\n\n 5   prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun, continued, or\n\n 6   completed.\u2019\u201d United States v. Holcombe, 883 F.3d 12, 15 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting\n\n 7   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3237(a)).\n\n 8         In this case, where Rasheed was accused in essence of failing to appear at a\n\n 9   designated facility, we start with \u201cthe general rule that where the crime charged\n\n10   is a failure to do a legally required act, the place fixed for its performance fixes\n\n11   the situs of the crime.\u201d Johnston v. United States, 351 U.S. 215, 220 (1956).\n\n12   Although we have never previously applied this principle to a prosecution for an\n\n13   escape committed during an unaccompanied transfer, several of our sister\n\n14   circuits faced with similar factual circumstances have concluded that venue is\n\n15   proper in the district of the receiving facility to which a defendant was obligated\n\n16   (and failed) to report. See United States v. Overaker, 766 F.2d 1326, 1327 (9th Cir.\n\n17   1985) (where a defendant escaped during an unescorted transfer from a federal\n\n18   prison in Minnesota to a federal prison camp in Arizona, venue was proper in\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\f 1   the District of Arizona); United States v. Wray, 608 F.2d 722, 723, 725 (8th Cir.\n\n 2   1979) (where a defendant escaped during an unescorted transfer from a\n\n3    correctional facility in California to a treatment center in Kansas City, Missouri,\n\n 4   venue was proper in the Western District of Missouri); cf. United States v.\n\n 5   Wilson, 262 F.3d 305, 320\u201321 (4th Cir. 2001) (where a defendant transferred from\n\n 6   a North Carolina prison to a Nevada prison on a limited detainer was\n\n 7   erroneously released by Nevada officials and failed to notify federal officials or\n\n8    return to the North Carolina facility, venue was proper in the Eastern District of\n\n9    North Carolina).\n\n10         The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Overaker is instructive. There, the court\n\n11   pointed out that \u201cproper venue is based on the location of the offense, not the\n\n12   personal presence of the offender.\u201d 766 F.2d at 1327 (citing Travis v. United\n\n13   States, 364 U.S. 631, 634 (1961)). Under the circumstances of the transfer in that\n\n14   case, the defendant \u201cwas in the constructive custody of the Arizona [receiving\n\n15   facility] as soon as he was ordered to report to [it],\u201d making venue proper in the\n\n16   District of Arizona, even if the defendant never physically entered its geographic\n\n17   boundaries. Id.; see also Wray, 608 F.2d at 724\u201325 (venue was proper in \u201cthe\n\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f 1   district in which the required act\u201d of reporting to a treatment center \u201cshould\n\n 2   have been done\u201d).\n\n3          We similarly conclude that, on the undisputed facts of this case, the\n\n4    extended limits of Rasheed\u2019s confinement required him to report to the VOA\n\n5    RRC in Rochester, New York by a designated time on March 2, 2016. His failure\n\n6    to appear there as required constituted an escape from the custody of the\n\n7    Attorney General under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 751(a) and 4082. On these facts, we hold\n\n8    that venue was proper in the Western District of New York.\n\n 9         Rasheed attempts to distinguish Overaker and Wray by pointing out that\n\n10   the indictment against him alleged only that he \u201cknowingly, willfully and\n\n11   unlawfully fail[ed] to remain within the extended limits of his confinement and\n\n12   escape[d], and attempt[ed] to escape, from the [VOA RRC].\u201d Joint App\u2019x at 14.\n\n13   Because the indictment did not allege a failure-to-report theory of escape,\n\n14   Rasheed contends, the Government was required to prove an affirmative act\n\n15   rather than a failure to act\u2014in other words, to establish venue based on an action\n\n16   taken to breach the limits of Rasheed\u2019s confinement rather than a failure to report\n\n17   to the VOA RRC.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f 1         We disagree. Nothing in the language of the indictment or the statute\n\n 2   suggests that a failure to remain within the extended limits of confinement\n\n3    excludes a failure to report to a designated facility at a designated time. The\n\n4    \u201cextended limits of [Rasheed\u2019s] confinement,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4082(a), were defined\n\n5    by Rasheed\u2019s furlough agreement. And under the terms of that agreement, the\n\n6    VOA RRC was the only place Rasheed was authorized to be as of 12:00 p.m. on\n\n 7   March 2, 2016. See Ex. App\u2019x at 3. Whether Rasheed\u2019s failure to arrive at the\n\n 8   VOA RRC on that day represented an affirmative act (e.g., getting off the bus at\n\n 9   an unapproved stop) or an omission (e.g., failing to get off the bus at a\n\n10   designated transfer station) is immaterial to our analysis. What matters is that\n\n11   Rasheed failed to remain within the limits of the confinement under \u00a7 4082(a) in\n\n12   this case because he failed to report to the VOA RRC in Rochester when ordered\n\n13   to do so.\n\n14         We also reject Rasheed\u2019s separate argument that, even if the escape for\n\n15   which he was convicted is a continuing offense that occurred in part in the\n\n16   Western District of New York, venue is nevertheless improper because his\n\n17   conduct did not have \u2018\u2018substantial contacts\u2019\u2019 with that District. We have\n\n18   explained that the \u201csubstantial contacts\u201d test applies \u201conly if the defendant\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\f 1   argues that his prosecution in the contested district will result in a hardship to\n\n 2   him, prejudice to him, or undermine the fairness of his trial.\u201d United States v.\n\n 3   Rutigliano, 790 F.3d 389, 399 (2d Cir. 2015) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n 4   \u201cOtherwise, prosecution . . . may occur in any district in which such offense was\n\n 5   begun, continued, or completed.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted).\n\n 6         But Rasheed does not even assert that he suffered any hardship or\n\n 7   prejudice. Indeed, throughout the District Court proceedings Rasheed failed to\n\n 8   raise a single objection based on venue until after the Government finished its\n\n 9   case at trial. And even under the substantial contacts approach that Rasheed\n\n10   urges here, the mere fact that another district (in this case, the Western District of\n\n11   Virginia) may also have been a convenient or permissible venue does not mean\n\n12   venue in the Western District of New York was improper. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n13   3237(a).\n\n14         We therefore conclude that venue was proper in the Western District of\n\n15   New York and that the District Court correctly denied Rasheed\u2019s motion for a\n\n16   judgment of acquittal on venue grounds.\n\n\n\n\n                                               15\n\f 1                                              II\n\n 2         Rasheed next argues that the District Court should have granted his\n\n 3   motion for a mistrial based on the District Judge\u2019s statements during jury\n\n4    selection that, Rasheed submits, denied him the right to a fair trial and an\n\n5    impartial jury \u201ccapable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence.\u201d\n\n 6   United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83, 99 (2d Cir. 2015). We review the District\n\n 7   Court\u2019s denial of a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Yannai,\n\n 8   791 F.3d 226, 242 (2d Cir. 2015).\n\n 9         With respect to the statements at issue, the District Judge initially informed\n\n10   the panel of prospective jurors that Rasheed \u201cwas in custody\u201d and \u201cin prison\u201d\n\n11   because he \u201chad committed a crime, a felony.\u201d Joint App\u2019x at 132. The District\n\n12   Judge later drew the jurors\u2019 attention to the United States Deputy Marshal\n\n13   standing near Rasheed in the courtroom, confirming that the Deputy Marshal\n\n14   was there because Rasheed \u201cis in custody.\u201d Id. at 228. As we have already\n\n15   described, the District Judge followed each of these remarks with an instruction\n\n16   that Rasheed\u2019s custodial status should have no bearing on the verdict. For\n\n17   example, the District Judge at one point told the prospective jurors, \u201cI\u2019m also\n\n18   telling you that you can\u2019t consider that fact, in and of itself, as a basis to find him\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\f 1   guilty.\u201d Id. at 132. The jurors were later warned that \u201c[t]he fact that he\u2019s in\n\n 2   custody has nothing to do with his guilt or nonguilt. . . . That has no bearing on\n\n 3   his guilt or nonguilt in this case. . . . [Y]ou, if you\u2019re on this jury, have to make\n\n4    that determination based on what comes out in court [and] . . . whether the\n\n 5   government has proven his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at 228\u201329.\n\n 6   Rasheed objected to the District Court\u2019s decision to explicitly refer to the fact that\n\n 7   he was in custody. But the District Court justified these instructions by\n\n 8   explaining that jurors \u201cwould have to be in another zone not to understand that\n\n 9   an individual\u2019s in custody, especially when he\u2019s walked into [the] court[room],\u201d\n\n10   and that he raised the issue in order to \u201cmake sure that the jury doesn\u2019t rely on\n\n11   something that they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Id. at 231\u201332.\n\n12         We understand that the District Judge\u2019s intention in making these\n\n13   statements was, as the District Judge stated, to guard against the possibility that\n\n14   jurors might speculate about Rasheed\u2019s custodial status and then improperly\n\n15   consider that fact in reaching a verdict. We also recognize that such a possibility\n\n16   may be greater in cases like this one, where custody is an element of the charged\n\n17   offense. The District Court\u2019s approach in this case is nevertheless problematic for\n\n18   at least two reasons. First, the District Judge\u2019s statements did not merely instruct\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\f 1   the jury to avoid speculating about Rasheed\u2019s status; they went further by\n\n 2   confirming that Rasheed was in fact in custody at the time of trial. And second,\n\n 3   the District Court made these statements without first consulting either the\n\n 4   defendant or the Government about whether the statements were warranted or\n\n 5   desirable. Cf. United States v. Perez, 144 F.3d 204, 211 (2d Cir. 1998) (affirming\n\n 6   conviction over due process objections where the district court offered to give a\n\n 7   curative instruction about custody status but defendants did not ultimately\n\n 8   request one). The District Court should instead have previewed for the parties\n\n 9   its proposed statements to the jurors, thus giving each side an opportunity to\n\n10   address any undue prejudice or other objections outside the presence of the jury.\n\n11   It is rarely, if ever, good practice for a district court to make an assertion to the\n\n12   jury that is potentially prejudicial to either party without first apprising the\n\n13   parties that it intends to do so and giving each side a meaningful opportunity to\n\n14   respond. See United States v. Ronder, 639 F.2d 931, 934 (2d Cir. 1981) (noting in\n\n15   the context of jury notes that \u201ccounsel should be afforded an opportunity to be\n\n16   heard before the trial judge responds.\u201d)\n\n17         Nevertheless, it was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to\n\n18   deny Rasheed\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Rasheed had already stipulated to the fact\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\f 1   that he was recently in custody, even though this was an essential element of the\n\n 2   escape charge. This alone significantly diluted the problematic nature and\n\n 3   impact of the District Court\u2019s unexpected statements to the prospective jurors. In\n\n 4   addition, each reference to Rasheed\u2019s current custodial status was followed\n\n5    immediately by unambiguous instructions that the fact of custody was not a\n\n6    permissible basis from which the jury could infer guilt. And Rasheed also\n\n7    agreed to a curative jury instruction relating to the statements, the accuracy of\n\n8    which is not challenged on appeal. It is an \u201calmost invariable assumption of the\n\n 9   law that jurors follow their instructions,\u201d Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 206\n\n10   (1987), and Rasheed offers no persuasive reason to suspect that the jurors here\n\n11   did otherwise.\n\n12         For these reasons, the District Court\u2019s statements did not violate Rasheed\u2019s\n\n13   right to a fair and impartial trial in violation of due process, and the denial of a\n\n14   mistrial was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n15                                              III\n\n16         As noted, Rasheed also challenges a number of the District Court\u2019s\n\n17   sentencing determinations, ranging from the applicable Guidelines range to\n\n18   standard and special conditions of supervised release.\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\f 1                                               A\n\n 2         We start with Rasheed\u2019s challenge to the calculation of the advisory\n\n3    Guidelines range. On appeal, Rasheed argues that his Pennsylvania state\n\n4    sentences for crimes committed while he was an escapee should have been\n\n5    treated as \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) rather than as prior\n\n6    sentences carrying criminal history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1 and\n\n7    4A1.2(a)(1). Because Rasheed did not object to the calculation of his criminal\n\n 8   history category at sentencing, we review this challenge for plain error. 2 We will\n\n 9   therefore vacate the sentence only if (1) there is an error, (2) the error is \u201cplain,\u201d\n\n10   (3) it \u201caffect[s] substantial rights,\u201d and (4) it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness,\n\n11   integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d United States v. Gamez,\n\n12   577 F.3d 394, 397 (2d Cir. 2009); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).\n\n\n     2In advocating before the District Court for a concurrent sentence, Rasheed\n     unsuccessfully argued that the Pennsylvania state convictions should have been treated\n     as \u201crelevant conduct\u201d committed during the \u201congoing offense\u201d of escape under U.S.S.G.\n     \u00a7 5G1.3(b). Joint App\u2019x at 568. Insofar as Rasheed\u2019s argument before the District Court\n     implicates a different provision of the Guidelines and a separate question about\n     consecutive or concurrent sentences, Rasheed\u2019s argument before the District Court\n     differs from the one that he now presses on appeal. During the District Court\n     proceedings, Rasheed did not object to the calculation of his criminal history as\n     Category V, to the allocation of criminal history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1 as a\n     result of the Pennsylvania state sentences, or to the advisory Guidelines range of thirty\n     to thirty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. As defense counsel agreed at oral argument,\n     plain error review therefore applies to our determination of Rasheed\u2019s current challenge\n     to his consecutive sentence. Oral Arg. Tr. at 11\u201312.\n                                                 20\n\f 1         The District Court treated Rasheed\u2019s Pennsylvania state sentences as prior\n\n 2   sentences under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1) and allocated criminal history points to\n\n3    them under \u00a7 4A1.1. Doing so increased Rasheed\u2019s criminal history category\n\n4    from category IV to category V and his advisory sentencing range from 24\u201330\n\n5    months to 30\u201337 months. Rasheed argues that this was error because the\n\n6    definition of \u201cprior sentence\u201d under \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1) excludes sentences imposed for\n\n 7   \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under \u00a7 1B1.3. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n.1. And, Rasheed\n\n 8   contends, the Pennsylvania convictions fit the definition of \u201crelevant conduct\u201d\n\n 9   because they were committed \u201cduring\u201d the continuing crime of escape. See id.\n\n10   \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A) (defining \u201crelevant conduct\u201d to include \u201call acts and omissions\n\n11   committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or\n\n12   willfully caused by the defendant . . . that occurred during the commission of the\n\n13   offense of conviction\u201d).\n\n14         Although we have not previously addressed the \u201crelevant conduct\u201d\n\n15   definition under \u00a7 1B1.3 in the context of an escape conviction and crimes\n\n16   committed after a defendant escaped custody and prior to apprehension, we\n\n17   need not determine whether Rasheed can satisfy the second prong of plain error\n\n18   review because Rasheed\u2019s challenge clearly fails under the third prong of the\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\f 1   plain error test. He has not shown \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for the\n\n 2   error, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Molina-\n\n 3   Martinez v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 1338, 1343 (2016) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n 4   Even in the case of significant procedural errors, we will not vacate a sentence\n\n 5   and remand if \u201cthe record indicates clearly that the district court would have\n\n 6   imposed the same sentence in any event.\u201d United States v. Cramer, 777 F.3d 597,\n\n 7   601 (2d Cir. 2015); see also United States v. Shuster, 331 F.3d 294, 296 (2d Cir.\n\n 8   2003).\n\n 9            The sentencing record in this case removes any doubt. The District Court\n\n10   imposed an above-Guidelines sentence of sixty months\u2019 imprisonment, which\n\n11   was the statutory maximum and twice the length of the lower end of the\n\n12   advisory range, to run consecutively to Rasheed\u2019s undischarged state sentences.\n\n13   In justifying the upward variance from the applicable Guidelines range, the\n\n14   District Court cited Rasheed\u2019s \u201clengthy criminal record,\u201d history of \u201cviolations of\n\n15   supervision [and] disciplinary violations while incarcerated,\u201d and his \u201crepetitive\n\n16   violent criminal conduct.\u201d For the District Court, Rasheed\u2019s past conduct\n\n17   reflected a \u201clife characterized by lawlessness and violence,\u201d a \u201cdisregard for the\n\n18   rules and rights of others,\u201d and a failure of \u201call attempts to rehabilitate,\u201d Joint\n\n\n\n                                               22\n\f 1   App\u2019x at 588, 595\u201397. The District Court repeatedly affirmed its intention to\n\n 2   impose the maximum permissible sentence. See id. at 574 (\u201cI\u2019m inclined to give\n\n 3   you five years to run consecutive,\u201d subject only to any legal \u201climit[ations] [on]\n\n 4   my discretion to give you the maximum sentence\u201d); id. at 560 (\u201c[T]here certainly\n\n 5   is a sufficient basis, as far as I\u2019m concerned, to give you the maximum\n\n 6   sentence.\u201d). On this record, Rasheed has failed to show a reasonable probability\n\n 7   that a lower criminal history category and advisory range would have affected\n\n8    the ultimate sentence imposed.\n\n 9         Because Rasheed\u2019s arguments founder under the third prong of plain error\n\n10   review, there is also no need for us to determine whether the District Court\u2019s\n\n11   erred in treating the Pennsylvania state sentences as prior sentences rather than\n\n12   relevant conduct under the Guidelines.\n\n13                                            B\n\n14         Finally, Rasheed challenges three of the conditions of supervised release\n\n15   that the District Court imposed at sentencing. The first two are special\n\n16   conditions, with one directing him to participate in a substance abuse program\n\n17   and the other in a mental health treatment program. The third condition is a\n\n18   standard \u201crisk-notification\u201d condition, which we explain further below.\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\f 1            As we confirmed in United States v. Boles, each of these conditions of\n\n 2   supervised release must be \u201creasonably related to (i) the nature and\n\n 3   circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\n\n4    and (ii) the purposes of sentencing, including the need to afford adequate\n\n5    deterrence, to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and to\n\n6    provide the defendant with needed training or treatment.\u201d 914 F.3d 95, 111 (2d\n\n 7   Cir. 2019); see also 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). Because Rasheed did not object to the\n\n 8   conditions he now contests, we review the District Court\u2019s decision to impose\n\n 9   them for plain error. See United States v. Haverkamp, 958 F.3d 145, 151 (2d Cir.\n\n10   2020).\n\n11                                              1\n\n12            Rasheed criticizes the two special conditions of supervised release that\n\n13   relate to substance abuse and mental health programs on the ground that each\n\n14   requires that he \u201ccontribute to the cost of services rendered.\u201d Rasheed contends\n\n15   that before imposing the cost-contribution requirement the District Court failed\n\n16   to find that he was able to pay for the costs of those programs. See Sp. App\u2019x at\n\n17   5. In support, Rasheed points out that the District Court found that, after\n\n18   spending over 23 years in state prison, he would not be able to pay a fine.

The cost\n\n14   contribution requirement here is silent on the issue of how Rasheed\u2019s\n\n15   \u201ccontribution\u201d is to be calculated. But the District Court found that Rasheed was\n\n16   likely to be unable to pay a fine, which suggests that his ability to pay is a\n\n17   relevant concern in Rasheed\u2019s case. We therefore construe the cost-contribution\n\n18   conditions to provide that the requirement that Rasheed contribute to the cost of\n\n\n\n                                               25\n\f 1   services rendered is contingent upon a finding that he is able to pay such a\n\n 2   contribution. See United States v. Young, 910 F.3d 665, 671\u201372 (2d Cir. 2018)\n\n 3   (construing substance abuse and mental health conditions of supervised release\n\n 4   to exclude inpatient treatment). Rasheed also retains the ability to later move to\n\n5    modify or terminate the condition under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e).\n\n 6                                             2\n\n 7         As noted, Rasheed also raises a challenge to the standard risk-notification\n\n 8   condition imposed by the District Court, which provided as follows:\n\n 9         If the probation officer determines that you pose a risk to another person\n10         (including an organization), the probation officer may require you to\n11         notify the person about the risk and you must comply with that\n12         instruction. The probation officer may contact the person and confirm that\n13         you have notified the person about the risk.\n14\n15   Sp. App\u2019x at 4. Rasheed claims that the condition is an improper delegation of\n\n16   judicial authority and discretion to the probation officer.\n\n17         Two months after judgment was entered in this case, we held in Boles that\n\n18   an identically worded risk-notification condition was an impermissible\n\n19   delegation to the probation officer of \u201cunfettered discretion with respect to the\n\n20   notification requirement.\u201d 914 F.3d at 112. In light of our decision, the District\n\n21   Court for the Western District of New York entered a standing district-wide\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\f 1   order modifying the standard risk-notification condition (including as it applies\n\n 2   to Rasheed) to read as follows:\n\n 3         If the court determines in consultation with your probation\n 4         officer that, based on your criminal record, personal history\n 5         and characteristics, and the nature and circumstances of your\n 6         offense, you pose a risk of committing further crimes against\n 7         another person (including an organization), the probation\n 8         officer may require you to notify the person about the risk and\n 9         you must comply with that instruction. The probation officer\n10         may contact the person and confirm that you have notified the\n11         person about the risk.\n\n12   Am. Standing Order in re: United States v. Boles (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2019)\n\n13   [hereinafter \u201cW.D.N.Y. Standing Order\u201d]. As modified by the Western District of\n\n14   New York\u2019s standing order, the risk-notification condition now requires Rasheed\n\n15   to notify a third party that he \u201cpose[s] a risk of committing further crimes against\n\n16   another person\u201d if \u201cthe court determines in consultation with [the] probation\n\n17   officer\u201d that he poses such a risk and if required by the probation officer.\n\n18   W.D.N.Y. Standing Order.\n\n19         Rasheed argues that the modified condition still violates our holding in\n\n20   Boles because it continues to delegate discretion to the probation officer to\n\n21   determine \u201cwhether [Rasheed] must notify the person or entity at risk.\u201d\n\n22   Appellant\u2019s Br. 50. But that argument is foreclosed by a number of recent\n\n23   decisions in which we have addressed the Western District\u2019s modified standing\n                                              27\n\f 1   order. See United States v. Bryant, 976 F.3d 165, 182 (2d Cir. 2020); United States\n\n 2   v. Birkedahl, 973 F.3d 49, 57 (2d Cir. 2020); United States v. Traficante, 966 F.3d\n\n 3   99, 105\u201307 (2d Cir. 2020). 3 As we have reasoned in those decisions, Rasheed\u2019s\n\n 4   claim is not yet ripe for review because \u201cany allegedly improper delegation is\n\n 5   conditioned on the district court finding, during [Rasheed\u2019s] term of supervised\n\n 6   release, that he poses a risk of committing further crimes against another\n\n 7   person,\u201d see Birkedahl, 973 F.3d at 57 (quotation marks omitted), and any such\n\n 8   \u201costensibly improper delegation may never actually occur,\u201d Traficante, 966 F.3d\n\n 9   at 106. Accordingly, we decline to consider Rasheed\u2019s challenge to this condition\n\n10   of supervised release, and we express no view of any challenge he may bring in\n\n11   the future should the District Court determine that Rasheed poses a risk to an\n\n12   individual and allows the probation officer to decide whether that individual\n\n13   must be notified.\n\n\n\n\n     3See also United States v.
