No written order\n\ndenying the writ application was filed in the clerk\u2019s record or a supplemental clerk\u2019s\n\nrecord.\n\n      After the Court requested letter briefs to address its jurisdiction, appellant\n\nfiled a letter brief and an amended notice of appeal that addressed problems with the\n\nrecord, but never indicated that a final written order had been signed. The State\u2019s\n\nletter brief indicated that there was no final written order and proposed the Court\n\neither dismiss the appeal or abate the appeal to allow entry of a final written order.\n\f      On September 9, 2021, the district clerk filed a second supplemental clerk\u2019s\n\nrecord showing appellant was tried on July 12, 2021, convicted of manslaughter, and\n\nsentenced to ten years in prison.\n\n      Because the trial court has not entered an appealable order in the habeas\n\nproceeding, appellant\u2019s notice of appeal does not confer jurisdiction upon the Court.\n\nSee Henderson v. State, 153 S.W.3d 735, 735\u201336 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2005, no pet.);\n\nEx parte Evans, 611 S.W.3d 86, 88 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2020, no pet.); see also Ex\n\nparte Terry, No. 12-20-00006-CR, 2020 WL 827591, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Tyler Feb.\n\n19, 2020, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication) (habeas appeal seeking\n\nbond reduction must be dismissed if no final written order has been entered).\n\n      Moreover, appellant\u2019s conviction renders moot his habeas contentions\n\nregarding pre-trial confinement. Martinez v. State, 826 S.W.2d 620, 620 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1992).\n\n      Concluding we lack jurisdiction and the matter is moot, we dismiss the appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                           /Robert D.
