A coalition of conservation organizations and one individual (\u201cForest Guardians\u201d) sought to enjoin this practice on the ground that it violates the Wilderness Act. Forest Guardians also claimed that APHIS and the Forest Service failed to conduct adequate environmental studies \u2014 as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) \u2014 before deciding to kill the mountain lions. The district court granted summary judgment to the federal defendants. We affirm.\nBACKGROUND\nIn 1984, Congress designated an area of the Coronado National Forest in Arizona as the Santa Teresa Wilderness. See Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-406, \u00a7 101(a)(23), 98 Stat. 1485. In May 1997, the Regional Forester delegated authority to APHIS to perform predator control in wilderness areas, including the Santa Teresa Wilderness, to \u201cprevent serious losses of domestic livestock.\u201d The Regional Forester defined \u201cserious loss\u201d as \u201ca determination made by APHIS or State Game and Fish after investigations, historical evidence and patterns of loss show the habitual nature of kills.\u201d APHIS killed six mountain lions between July 18, 1997, and March 22, 1999, at the request of a rancher who grazed cattle within the Santa Teresa Wilderness.\nDISCUSSION\nThe district court did not err in concluding that the Forest Service may authorize APHIS to perform lethal predator control of mountain lions in the Santa Teresa Wilderness in order to protect private livestock. Nor did it err by allowing predator control in areas where it had not been used in the past. The Wilderness Act of 1964 and the Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984 do not expressly prohibit predator control in wilderness areas. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1131-1136; Arizona Wilderness Act \u00a7 101(a)(23), (f)(1); H.R.Rep. No. 96-617, at 10-13 (1979). They do, however, allow pre-existing grazing operations to continue in areas later designated as wilderness. See Arizona Wilderness Act \u00a7 101(f)(1). We agree with the Forest Service that \u201cprivate livestock grazing implicitly includes operations to support that grazing, such as lethal control of predators.\u201d Forest Guardians v. Animal &amp; Plant Health Inspection Serv., No. CV 99-61-TUC-WDB, slip op. at 6 (D.Ariz. Nov. *114314, 2000). We therefore defer to the Forest Service\u2019s conclusion that the Act authorizes predator control as one of the \u201cflexible opportunities to manage grazing in a creative and realistic site specific fashion,\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 96-617, at 11. See Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944).\nForest Guardians\u2019s reliance on congressional grazing guidelines is unavailing. These guidelines, set out in a House of Representatives report on the Colorado Wilderness Act of 1980, clarified that certain grazing uses that pre-existed wilderness designation should not be phased out. See H.R.Rep. No. 96-617, at 10-13. The Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984 incorporated these grazing guidelines by reference. See \u00a7 101(f)(1). Forest Guardians asserts that, because the guidelines permit the maintenance of only pre-existing supporting facilities, by implication they prohibit predator control unless it pre-existed the wilderness designation. But the guidelines do not address the conflict between predator control and grazing in wilderness, and thus do not undermine our conclusion that the Act allows lethal predator control where necessary to protect pre-existing grazing operations.\nForest Guardians\u2019s assertion that the Forest Service Manual bars predator control in wilderness areas except where it was used before the wilderness designation is also unpersuasive. Even if the Manual did prohibit predator control in those areas, we previously made clear that the Manual does not have the force of law and does not bind the agency and is therefore not entitled to deference. See Southwest Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Forest Serv., 100 F.3d 1443, 1450 (9th Cir.1996); W. Radio Servs. Co. v. Espy, 79 F.3d 896, 901 (9th Cir.1996).\nFinally, the Forest Service\u2019s decision that its existing environmental assessments complied with the National Environmental Policy Act and sufficiently considered the effects of predator control in the Santa Teresa Wilderness was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\u201d Hells Canyon Alliance v. United States Forest Serv., 227 F.3d 1170, 1176-77 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). APHIS and the Forest Service have performed a number of environmental studies since the 1990s, among them a statewide study that specifically addressed the effects of lethal predator control in wilderness areas including the Santa Teresa Wilderness. Forest Guardians may prefer that the federal defendants conduct a separate analysis that solely evaluates the environmental impact of predator control in the Santa Teresa Wilderness, but the agency has discretion to determine the geographic scope of its NEPA analyses.
