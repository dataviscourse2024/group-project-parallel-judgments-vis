RCW 74.34.035. The act also requires a report to law enforcement\n\fNo. 70892-9-1 / 2\n\n\nwhen one has \"reason to suspect\" that a physical assault has taken place. RCW\n\n74.34.035. Here, the defendant, a nurse, informed DSHS about a report that she\n\nhad received regarding potential abuse at the adult family home. There was no\n\nduty to call law enforcement about someone else's patient when the information\n\ncame from a person with whom the defendant was familiar and whose reliability\n\nwas questionable.\n\n       Nor did the plaintiff establish that a second nurse had a duty to call\n\nauthorities when she observed the patient back in bed, with her eyes open, and\n\nable to move her legs, after a fall on the floor the day before.\n\n       Because the plaintiff has failed to establish any duty, a necessary element\n\nof a negligence action, summary judgment dismissal was appropriate.\n\n       We affirm the trial court.\n\n                                       FACTS\n\n       Ho Im Bae (Bae) was one of four inpatient residents at Lakeside Adult\n\nFamily Home (Lakeside).        Lakeside was owned and operated by Gretchen\n\nDhaliwal, Inc.\n\n       Bae was admitted to Lakeside on January 23, 2009, suffering from\n\nParkinson's, arthritis, dementia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and spinal stenosis.\n\nShe died less than three months later on March 30 from acute morphine\n\nintoxication. Morphine was not a prescribed drug for Bae. Her death was ruled a\n\nhomicide.\n\n       Lakeside employed Fannie Irawati as a caregiver for Bae during this time.\n\nTwo employees of Alpha Nursing and Services, Inc. (Alpha), Christine Thomas,\nRegistered Nurse (RN), and Marian Binondo, Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN),\n\fNo. 70892-9-1 / 3\n\n\nprovided nursing care to two of the four residents at Lakeside, but did not provide\n\nnursing services for Bae. Binondo filled in for the regularly assigned Thomas on\n\nweekends and vacation days in March 2009.1\n\n       Binondo was in the kitchen at Lakeside with Kerri Salzbrun, her patient,\n\nwhen she heard a \"thud\" from the adjacent room. Salzbrun entered the adjacent\n\nroom and Binondo followed. Binondo saw Bae lying on the floor near her bed.\n\nBinondo told Irawati that Irawati might need to call 911 and that Bae might need\n\nfurther assessment by her nurse. Irawati returned Bae to her bed and told Binondo\n\nthat Bae falls a lot, but that she would call Dhaliwal, an RN and the owner of\n\nLakeside, who lived across the street from the home. Binondo saw that Bae's eyes\n\nwere open and she was able to move her legs. She did not observe any bruising\n\nat the time. As she left the facility, Binondo saw Irawati on the telephone.\n\n       Salzbrun asserted in her declaration that she observed a knot on Bae's\n\nhead. Over the next day or two, the knot appeared larger and Bae's face was\n\ncovered in a large bruise.\n\n       On March 30, the morning of Bae's death, Thomas resumed her regular\n\nrounds at Lakeside, visiting her patients. Salzbrun told Thomas that Bae was\n\nbeing given morphine. Thomas checked the medical records located in the\n\nkitchen. From there, she saw Bae, unable to walk, being taken to the bathroom to\n\nbe washed. Irawati \"held her under her arms and walked backwards pulling her\n\n\n\n1There appears to be a discrepancy on the date of the fall with Kim stating it occurred on\nMarch 28 and Alpha contending March 21. Appellant's Br. at 5; Resp't's Br. at 6-7. The\nrespondent's brief indicates late March, but cites to an assessment by Lakeside's owner\noccurring on March 21. 1 Clerk's Papers (CP) at 844. Binondo's time sheet does not\nhave the patient written in for the March 21 date, but does for the March 28 and 29 dates.\n3 CP at 972. Binondo's deposition shows her agreeing with counsel that the date could\nbe March 28 as does Kerri Salzbrun's declaration. 1 CP at 123, 127, 328-29.\n\fNo. 70892-9-1/4\n\n\nwhile her feet were sliding on the floor.\"2 Thomas did not observe any bruising or\n\ninjuries.\n\n        Shortly after leaving Lakeside, at approximately 10:00 a.m., concerned\n\nabout the allegation of morphine, Thomas called the DSHS Complaint Resolution\n\nUnit (1-800-END-HARM hotline) to report her observations and the concerns\n\nSalzbrun had expressed to her about Bae. The phone was busy. She called again\n\nat 11:30 a.m. and left a voice mail message as instructed.\n\n        That same night, Salzbrun found Bae unresponsive and called 911. Bae's\n\ndeath from acute morphine intoxication was subsequently ruled a homicide.\n\n        On April 1, both Binondo and Thomas were at Alpha's office. Thomas\n\nrelated her concerns about Bae to Binondo. Binondo, recalling the fall that had\n\noccurred when she was there, thought the patient might well have been the same\n\none. The supervisor recommended that Binondo report the incident to DSHS in\n\nlight of Thomas's recent information. Binondo placed a call and left a voice mail\n\nmessage describing her observations.\n\n        Esther Kim as Personal Representative of Bae's estate brought this civil\n\naction for damages against Lakeside and Dhaliwal. In 2012, she added Alpha and\n\nThomas asserting a claim for negligence for failure to report Bae's abuse under\n\nWashington's vulnerable adult protection act, chapter 74.34 RCW.\n\n        The parties stipulated to dismissal of all claims against Lakeside, and\nDhaliwal individually.   Thomas moved to dismiss the action against her for\nimproper service. Alpha moved to dismiss the action on summary judgment. The\ntrial court ruled service on Thomas was timely and proper and later dismissed the\n\n\n21 CPat178.\n\fNo. 70892-9-1 / 5\n\n\nsuit on summary judgment.         The trial court also denied Kim's motion for\n\nreconsideration.    Kim appeals the summary judgment dismissal of her action.\n\nThomas cross-appeals the trial court's ruling that service on her in Norway was\n\nproper.\n\n                                    ANALYSIS\n\n                             I.    Service on Thomas\n\n      Thomas first contends the trial court erred in not dismissing the action\n\nagainst her because such service was untimely. Service on one of two or more\n\nco-defendants tolls the statutes of limitations as to unserved defendants. Powers\n\nv. W.B. Mobile Servs., Inc., _     Wn.2d _, 339 P.3d 173, 176 (2014); RCW\n\n4.16.170. There is no dispute that Alpha, the co-defendant, was timely served.\n\nThus, service on Thomas was timely.\n\n       Thomas next argues that service was invalid because it failed to comply\n\nwith the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial\n\nDocuments in Civil or Commercial Matters, Nov. 15, 1965, T.I.A.S. No. 6638, 20.\n\nU.S.T. 361 (hereinafter Hague Convention). Because Thomas was a Norwegian\n\ncitizen, living in Norway at the time ofservice, Kim was obligated to serve her under\n\nthe requirements of the Hague Convention.\n\n          Under the supremacy clause, United States Constitution, article VI, the\n\n\"Hague Convention preempts inconsistent methods of service prescribed by state\nlaw in all cases to which [t]he Hague Convention applies.\" Broad v. Mannesmann\n\nAniaaenbau. A.G.. 141 Wn.2d 670, 674-75, 10 P.3d 371 (2000). Article 1 of the\n\nHague Convention provides that it applies \"'in all cases, in civil or commercial\n\fNo. 70892-9-1 / 6\n\nmatters, where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for\n\nservice abroad.'\" Broad, 141 Wn.2d at 678 (quoting Hague Convention, art. 1).\n\n      The Hague Convention specifies that \"the Central Authority of the State\n\naddressed shall itself serve the document or shall arrange to have it served by an\n\nappropriate agency ... by a method prescribed by its internal law for the service\n\nof documents in domestic actions upon persons who are within its territory.\" Hague\n\nConvention, art. 4(a). Thus, service on Thomas would be effective if it was\n\naccomplished in accordance with Norwegian law.\n\n       Further, the Hague Convention \"allows service to be effected without\n\nutilizing the Central Authority as long as the nation receiving service has not\n\nobjected to the method used.\" DeJames v. Magnificence Carriers, Inc., 654 F.2d\n\n280,288 (3rd Cir. 1981); see also Restatement (third) of Foreign Relations Law\n\nof the United States \u00a7 471 cmt. e (1987) (\"for states that have objected to all of\n\nthe alternative methods, service through the Central Authority is in effect the\n\nexclusive means\").\n\n       Here, Kim personally served Thomas. The record contains the affidavit of\nThomas's process server, in which the process server swore that he personally\n\nserved Thomas at her residence, which is considered due and proper service\n\nunder the laws of Norway. Because Norway has not objected to personal service\n\nand, in fact, such service complied with its laws, there is no reason to invalidate\n\nservice in this case.\n\n       Furthermore, such service was proper and accomplished in accordance\n\nwith the superior court's civil rules of procedure in Washington State. CR 4(i)(1)\nprovides for \"Alternative Provisions for Service in a Foreign Country\":\n\fNo. 70892-9-1 / 7\n\n\n          Manner. When a statute or rule authorizes service upon a party\n          not an inhabitant of or found within the state, and service is to be\n          effected upon the party in a foreign country, it is also sufficient if\n          service of the summons and complaint is made: (A) in the manner\n          prescribed by the law of the foreign country for service in that\n          country in an action in any of its courts of general jurisdiction; or\n          (B) as directed by the foreign authority in response to a letter\n          rogatory or a letter of request; or (C) upon an individual, by\n          delivery to him personally, and upon a corporation or partnership\n          or association, by delivery to an officer, a managing or general\n          agent; or (D) by any form of mail, requiring a signed receipt, to be\n          addressed and mailed to the party to be served; or (E) pursuant\n          to the means and terms of any applicable treaty or convention; or\n          (F) by diplomatic or consular officers when authorized by the\n          United States Department of State; or (G) as directed by order of\n          the court. Service under (C) or (G) above may be made by any\n          person who is not a party and is not less than 21 years of age or\n          who is designated by order of the court or by the foreign court.\n          The method for service of process in a foreign country must\n          comply with applicable treaties, if any, and must be reasonably\n          calculated, under all the circumstances, to give actual notice.\n\nHere, the service complied with both the Hague Convention and CR 4(i)(1), giving\n\nThomas actual notice.\n\n       Because we hold that service was effective, we need not address whether\n\nThomas waived her affirmative defense objection to such service of process.\n\n                                  II. Summary Judgment\n\nStandard of Review\n\n       A motion for summary judgment may be granted when there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law. CR 56(c). When a defendant moves for summary judgment, it bears\n\nthe initial burden of showing the absence of an issue of material fact. Young v.\n\nKey Pharm., Inc., 112 Wn.2d 216, 225, 770 P.2d 182 (1989). The burden then\n\nmoves to the plaintiff to \"make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an\n\nelement essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden\n\fNo. 70892-9-1 / 8\n\n\nof proof at trial.\" Young, 112 Wn.2d at 225 (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\n\nU.S. 317, 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). In meeting his burden,\n\nthe plaintiff cannot rely solely on allegations made in his pleadings, but must set\n\nforth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Young, 112\n\nWn.2d at 225-26.     If the plaintiff does not meet his burden, \"'there can be no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact, since a complete failure of proof concerning\n\nan essential element of the nonmoving party's case necessarily renders all other\n\nfacts immaterial.'\" Young, 112 Wn.2d at 225 (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(quoting Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322-23).\n\n       This court reviews summary judgment orders de novo, viewing the facts and\n\nreasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Lowman\n\nv. Wilbur, 178 Wn.2d 165, 168-69, 309 P.3d 387 (2013). Issues of negligence and\n\ncausation in tort actions are questions of fact not usually susceptible to summary\n\njudgment, but a question of fact may be determined as a matter of law where\n\nreasonable minds can reach only one conclusion. Moore v. Hagge, 158 Wn. App.\n\n137, 147-48, 241 P.3d 787 (2010).\n\n       The elements of a negligence claim are (1) a legal duty owed by the\n\ndefendant to the plaintiff, (2) breach of that duty, and (3) injury to the plaintiff\n\nproximately caused by the breach, and (4) damages. Schoolev v. Pinch's Deli\nMkt.. Inc.. 134 Wn.2d 468, 951 P.2d 749 (1998).       All four must be present to\n\nestablish a claim.\n\nLegal Duty\n\n       Kim argues that Binondo and Thomas failed to report suspected abuse to\nthe appropriate governmental agency. She argues that both had a mandatory duty\n\n\n                                         8\n\fNo. 70892-9-1 / 9\n\n\nto report the abuse and that their failure to do so constituted neglect under RCW\n\n74.34.020(12).\n\n       RCW 74.34.020(12) defines neglect as follows:\n\n       \"Neglect\" means (a) a pattern of conduct or inaction by a person or\n       entity with a duty of care that fails to provide the goods and services\n       that maintain physical or mental health of a vulnerable adult, or that\n       fails to avoid or prevent physical or mental harm or pain to a\n       vulnerable adult; or (b) an act or omission by a person or entity with\n       a duty of care that demonstrates a serious disregard of\n       conseguences of such a magnitude as to constitute a clear and\n       present danger to the vulnerable adult's health, welfare, or safety,\n       including but not limited to conduct prohibited under RCW\n       9A.42.100.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) To establish neglect, then Kim must demonstrate that Alpha\n\nhad a duty to report.\n\n       We agree that both Binondo and Thomas were mandatory reporters under\n\nthe act:\n\n       \"Mandated reporter\" is an employee of the department; law\n       enforcement officer; social worker; professional school personnel;\n       individual provider; an employee of a facility; an operator of a facility;\n       an employee of a social service, welfare, mental health, adult day\n       health, adult day care, home health, home care, or hospice agency;\n       county coroner or medical examiner; Christian Science practitioner;\n       or health care provider subject to chapter 18.130 RCW.\n\nRCW 74.34.020(11) (emphasis added).\n\n       Both employees of Alpha fall within that definition as they are clearly\nemployeesofan agency that provides health care. The act does not limit a reporter\n\nto only those who provide services to a specific patient.\n\n       Kim argues that the statute creates an implied statutory cause against\nmandatory reporters who violate their reporting duties. Alpha argues that even if\nthe employees are mandated reporters, Binondo was not required to make an\n\fNo. 70892-9-1/10\n\n\nimmediate report because she did not observe any abuse; and Thomas did, in fact,\n\nreport the suspected abuse to DSHS almost immediately after learning about it.\n\nThus, neither breached their duty.\n\nBinondo\n\n\n      Binondo's declaration states:\n\n\n             4.     In mid-March. I made a nursing visit to one of Alpha's\n      patient's at the Lakeside Adult Family Home because Christine\n      Thomas, RN was off-duty. During my visit, at one point I was in the\n      kitchen with my patient, when we both heard a \"thud\" in the adjacent\n      room. My patient left the kitchen and entered the adjacent room\n      where the \"thud\" had originated. I then followed my patient, and\n      entered the room. A caregiver who I knew as \"Fannie\" entered the\n      room at about that time. The room was a resident's bedroom, but I\n      did not know the resident's name and I had never seen her prior to\n      that date, as she was not a patient of Alpha.\n\n              5.     When I entered the room, I saw a small elderly Asian\n      woman, lying on floor near her bed. Aside from that woman, Fannie,\n      myself and my patient, there was no one else in the room. I told\n      Fannie that she might need to call 911 and would probably need\n      further assessment by her nurse. Idid not knowthe resident's history,\n       or health and mental status because she was not my patient.\n             6.    Fannie told me that the resident \"falls a lot.\" Fanny told\n       me that she would call the owner of Lakeside Adult Family Home,\n       Ms. Gretchen Dhaliwal, R.N., who lives just across the street from\n       the home, and report the fall. Itdid not appear to me that the resident\n       was injured in the un-witnessed fall. I did not witness any abuse of\n       the resident. The resident did not seem to be in distress once she\n       was placed in bed, and was moving her extremities without difficulty.\n       I knew that Ms. Dhaliwal was the home's primary nurse, and\n       concluded, based on Fanny's statement, that Ms. Dhaliwal would\n       perform an assessment ofthe resident's condition. As Ideparted the\n       home, I saw Fannie dialing the phone.[3]\nThe declaration further states that on the morning after Bae died, Binondo learned\n\nof Thomas's observations. Suspecting the patient might be the same one, she\n\n\n\n\n3 2 CP at 655-56, 758-59.\n\n                                         10\n\fNo. 70892-9-1 /11\n\n\nreported her observations to her supervisor and then to the DSHS hotline on April\n\n1,2009.\n\n      Under the statute, Binondo met her mandatory reporting requirement. She\n\ndid not learn of any possible abuse until she became aware of Thomas's\n\nexperience the day following her observations. Without more, no reasonable\n\nperson would assume that Binondo had an obligation to report her initial\n\nobservations to DSHS or law enforcement at the time she observed Bae fallen by\n\nher bed.\n\n\nThomas\n\n      On March 30, Thomas visited her patients at Lakeside.         Salzburn told\n\nThomas that Bae was being given morphine and sedated all the time. Thomas\n\nchecked the book listing the patients' drugs and learned that morphine was not a\n\nprescribed drug for Bae.\n\n      Thomas was aware that, as a nurse, she was a mandatory reporter. Indeed\n\nupon leaving the home, Thomas immediately called DSHS but received a busy\nsignal. At the next opportunity, one and half hours later, she called and reported\nthe possibility of suspected abuse to DSHS:\n\n       I work as a visiting nurse for Alpha Nursing in Snohomish and I\n       worked in an AFH [(Adult Family Home)] today, Lakeside AFH,\n       16011 Eastshort Dr., Lynnwood, WA 98037. I have a patient there,\n       Carrie Salsbrun [(CS)]. She was telling me about thing [sic] she was\n       concerned about, that she had seen with another resident in the\n       home, so itwasn't me observing, itwas kind of a second hand report\n       here.\n\n       CS was saying she believed that one of the staff members had\n       sedated one of the residents and that she observed two purple\n       morphine tablets sitting in a cup next to her bed. The person does\n       not have an order for morphine and she said the resident was totally\n       sedated, she wasn't able to wake up and eat all day. Ithink she was\n       referring to yesterday. CS also said she has seen some old med\n                                        11\n\fNo. 70892-9-1/12\n\n\n      sheets of some morphine in the closet. CS has a history of drug\n      abuse. She is on narcotic medication so I can't say for sure that\n      she's a reliable source. I thought it was rather concerning. She said\n      she would call this in.\n\n      When I was at the home today, the patient that CS thought was over\n      medicated was very drowsy. She kind of had to be dragged to the\n      bathroom. She wasn't able to walk to the bathroom. The caregiver\n      pulled her to the bathroom, sat her down to wash her and clean her.\n      Of course, I don't work with the patient so I don't know what was\n      going on. The patient is one of two Korean ladies that live in the\n       home. She's the smallest of the two.\n\n       Like I said, CS is the one who reported this to me so she can give\n      further details. The owner of the AFH is Gretchen and she is not in\n       the home. The caregiver that CS said did this, her name ... it just\n       slipped my mind. She said it was the Asian lady who was working in\n       the home today.\n\n       CALLED THE COMPL 3/30/09:\n\n       The Compl did not know the name of the resident effected. The\n       Compl said Carrie Salsbrun may know but could not pronounce the\n       name, as it was Korean.W\n\n       That report relayed her observations and the fact that it was based in part\n\non information provided to her by a patient whom she could not say was reliable.\n\nThus, under the provisions of the act, Thomas met her mandatory reporting duty.\n\n        Kim contends that although Thomas reported the suspicion of abuse to\n\nDSHS, she failed to report the abuse to a law enforcement agency.             RCW\n\n74.34.020(2) defines abuse as\n\n       \"Abuse\" means the willful action or inaction that inflicts injury,\n       unreasonable confinement, intimidation, or punishment on a\n       vulnerable adult. In instances of abuse of a vulnerable adult who is\n       unable to express or demonstrate physical harm, pain, or mental\n       anguish, the abuse is presumed to cause physical harm, pain, or\n       mental anguish. Abuse includes sexual abuse, mental abuse,\n\n\n\n4 3 CP at 999.\n\n                                        12\n\fNo. 70892-9-1/13\n\n\n       physical abuse, and exploitation of a vulnerable adult, which have\n       the following meanings:\n\n\n               (b) \"Physical abuse\" means the willful action of inflicting bodily\n       injury or physical mistreatment. Physical abuse includes, but is not\n       limited to, striking with or without an object, slapping, pinching,\n       choking, kicking, shoving, prodding, or the use of chemical restraints\n       or physical restraints unless the restraints are consistent with\n       licensing requirements, and includes restraints that are otherwise\n       being used inappropriately.\n       RCW 74.34.035(1) provides that \"[w]hen there is reasonable cause to\n\nbelieve that abandonment, abuse, financial exploitation, or neglect of a vulnerable\n\nadult has occurred, mandated reporters shall immediately report to the\n\ndepartment.\"5\n\n       RCW 74.34.035(3) provides that \"fwlhen there is reason to suspect that\n\nphysical assault has occurred or there is reasonable cause to believe that an act\n\nhas caused fear of imminent harm,\" mandated reporters are required to\n\nimmediately report to the department and to the appropriate law enforcement\n\nagency.6\n\n       RCW 74.34.035(3) imposes an additional requirement to report to law\n\nenforcement. In analyzing whether Thomas had a \"reason to suspect\" a \"physical\n\nassault\" had occurred, it is helpful to compare the language of subsection (1) with\n\nsubsection (3).    A \"reason to suspect an assault\" mandating a report to law\n\n\n\n5 (Emphasis added.) Although this statute does not define the term \"reasonable cause to\nbelieve\" that term was recently defined by the legislature in 2013 in chapter 26.44 RCW,\na statute dealing with child abuse and neglect. \"Reasonable cause\" means a person\nwitnesses or receives a credible written or oral report alleging abuse, including sexual\ncontact, or neglect of a child.\" RCW 26.44.030(b)(iii). That definition lends support to our\nholding here that Thomas, because her report to DSHS clearly stated that it was based\non information provided to her by a patient whom she did not deem reliable, did not receive\na \"credible\" oral report alleging abuse.\n6 RCW 74.34.035(3)(a),(b) (emphasis added).\n\n                                            13\n\fNo. 70892-9-1/14\n\n\nenforcement must require a higher showing that a mere \"reasonable cause to\n\nbelieve\" that abuse has occurred which does not require a report to law\n\nenforcement. \"When the legislature uses two different terms in the same statute,\n\ncourts presume the legislature intends the terms to have different meanings.\"\n\nDenslevv.Dep'tofRet.Svs.. 162 Wn.2d 210, 219, 173 P.3d 885 (2007).\n\n       Thomas did not observe the event later determined to be an assault.7 She\n\nonly had the suspicions expressed by patient Salzbrun. Alpha established that\n\nThomas had insufficient reason to believe that Salzbrun, under the influence of\n\nnarcotics, was a reliable witness. Thomas had a relationship with Salzbrun and\n\nshe had concerns about that Salzbrun's credibility. In her initial report to DSHS,\n\nThomas's message clearly indicated that she did not think Salzbrun was reliable.\n\n       Kim fails to counteract this evidence of unreliability. The fact that Bae was\n\nmurdered by an overdose of morphine became known after the fact. Thomas did\n\nnot witness the caregiver administering any morphine, or any other medication for\n\nthat matter.\n\n       Thomas observed a non-ambulatory patient being taken to the bathroom to\n\nbe cleaned. This is characterized as being \"dragged\" to the bathroom.8 Thomas's\n\ndeposition clearly showed that she observed Bae as having a decreased level of\nconsciousness, which is consistent with several health factors. She only notified\n\nDSHS of a potential problem. In fact, DSHS assessed the report as not needing\n\nreview for 10 days.\n\n\n\n7 RCW 74.34.035(5) provides that when there is \"reason to suspect\" that the death of a\nvulnerable adult was caused by abuse or neglect, mandated reporters shall report the\ndeath to the medical examiner as well as the department and law enforcement as\nexpeditiously as possible.\n8 3 CP at 999.\n\n                                         14\n\fNo. 70892-9-1/15\n\n        Salzbrun's declaration in response to the motion for summary judgment\n\nmerely states that she told Thomas that Bae was given someone else's morphine\n\nand was \"doped up.\"9 Salzbrun does not state how she knew this or on what basis\n\nshe reached that conclusion, other than she saw two blue pills. All Thomas knew\n\nwas that Salzbrun, a person whom Thomas felt to be less than reliable, declared\n\nthat Bae was being given morphine.\n\n        Kim presented evidence of bruising being present at the time of the autopsy.\n\nHowever, neither Binondo nor Thomas saw any evidence of such bruising or\n\ninjuries. Salzbrun testified that there was a knot when Bae fell, but that bruising\n\ndeveloped later. But bruises in and of themselves would not have mandated a law\n\nenforcement call. Such bruises could be reasonably explained to be a result of the\n\nfall.\n\n        The basis of the abuse was asserted by another patient\u2014a patient who was\n\nunder narcotics and whose reliability was questioned by both her caregivers.\n\nWhile the suspicions espoused by the other patient may have raised a concern,\n\nthat concern was passed to DSHS when Thomas made her call. Taking all the\n\nevidence in favor of Kim, there simply was not enough evidence of a physical\n\nassault to \"mandate\" Thomas calling law enforcement in these circumstances.10\nVoluntary Rescue Doctrine\n\n        Finally, Kim argues that Alpha owed a duty of care under the voluntary\nrescue doctrine. Where the existence of a legal duty is dependent on disputed\n\n\n\n91 CPat124.\n10 Given our conclusion that no duty was breached under the circumstances of this case,\nwe do not reach the issue of whether a breach of a mandatory duty to report under chapter\n74.34 RCW would give rise to an implied cause of action.\n\n                                           15\n\fNo. 70892-9-1/16\n\n\nmaterial facts, summary judgment is inappropriate. Mita v. Guardsmark, LLC, 182\n\nWn. App. 76, 328 P.3d 962 (2014). Under this doctrine, a person owes a duty to\n\none that he or she knows is in need if \"(1) the actor voluntarily promises to aid or\n\nwarn the person in need and (2) the person in need reasonably relies on the\n\npromise or a third person who reasonably relies on the promise.\" Mita. 182 Wn.\n\nApp. at 85.\n\n              The person in need may reasonably rely on the promise if it\n       induces him or her to \"refrain from seeking help elsewhere.\" Folsom\n       fv. Burger King, 135 Wn.2d 658, 676, 958 P.2d 301(1998)]; Brown\n       fv. MacPherson's. Inc.. 86 Wn.2d 293, 300, 545 P.2d 13 (1975)]. The\n       person in need may reasonably rely on the third person if \"privity of\n       reliance\" exists between them.      Osborn fv. Mason County, 157\n       Wn.2d 18, 26, 134 P.3d 197 (2006)]. The third person, in turn, may\n       reasonably rely on the promise if it induces him or her to \"refrain[ ]\n       from acting on . . . behalf of the person in need. Chambers-\n       Castanes fv. King County, 100 Wn.2d 275, 285 n.3, 669 P.2d 451\n       (1983); accord Brown, 86 Wn.2d at 299-300. \"[Either] person may\n       reasonably rely on explicit or implicit assurances.\" Osborn, 157\n       Wn.2d at 26; Brown, 86 Wn.2d at 301.\n\nMita, 182 Wn. App. at 85 (alteration in original). Kim argues that Salzbrun took no\naction because she relied upon both Binondo and Thomas to take care of the\n\nproblem. Salzbrun's declaration states:\n\n       Ithought [Binondo] was going to get help, but none arrived\n       ... I thought Nurse Thomas would leave and call for help, but no\n       help arrived.1111\n\nSalzbrun's declaration does not assert that either nurse promised to make a call,\n\nrather she states that she \"thought\" either one of them would do something. This\n\nis insufficient to create a duty under the rescue doctrine.\n\n\n\n\n 11 1 CPat 124.\n\n                                          16\n\fNo. 70892-9-1/17\n\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n       We hold that Thomas was properly and timely served in accordance with\n\nthe superior court's civil rules, Norway's rules on service of process, and the Hague\n\nConvention. Binondo had no duty to report to either DSHS or law enforcement.\n\nLikewise, under the circumstances present here, Thomas did not have a duty to\n\nreportto lawenforcement.
