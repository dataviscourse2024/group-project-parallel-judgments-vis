Taylor v. State, 444 So.2d 931 (Fla.1983); Arline v. State, 550 So.2d 1180 (Fla. 1st DCA 1989). We also remand for resentencing on O\u2019Brian\u2019s conviction for aggravated battery (a second-degree felony), as the State concedes that the sentence was improperly enhanced to a first-degree felony under section 775.087(1), Florida Statutes (1991), based upon O\u2019Brian\u2019s use of a weapon in committing the offense.\nBOOTH, MICKLE and BENTON, JJ., concur.\n",
