Romano, for the appellant (petitioner).\n   Ronald G. Weller, senior assistant state\u2019s attorney,\nwith whom, on the brief, were Gail P. Hardy, state\u2019s\nattorney, and Jo Anne Sulik, supervisory assistant\nstate\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (respondent).\n\f                          Opinion\n\n  ALVORD, J. The petitioner, Troy Westberry, appeals\nfrom the judgment of the habeas court denying his\nsecond petition for a writ of habeas corpus.1 On appeal,\nthe petitioner claims that the habeas court erred by\nrejecting his claim that perjured testimony was used at\nhis criminal trial, in violation of the fourteenth amend-\nment to the federal constitution, and that he is actually\ninnocent. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judg-\nment of the habeas court.\n   At trial, the jury reasonably could have found the\nfollowing facts. The events giving rise to the petitioner\u2019s\nconviction were the culmination of a period of animos-\nity between a group of individuals that included the\npetitioner and Jesse Pope and another group of individ-\nuals that included Gerald Jenkins, Dwayne Stewart, and\nthe victim, Anthony Bennefield. That hostility mani-\nfested itself in several violent altercations between\nmembers of the two groups.\n   On May 5, 1999, Jenkins unsuccessfully attempted to\ndrive Pope off the road with his Chevrolet Lumina, and,\nwhen he was unsuccessful, Jenkins fired shots in Pope\u2019s\ndirection as he drove away. Around 8 p.m. that same\nday, Stewart saw the petitioner driving a gold Chevrolet\nMonte Carlo along the same street as the victim was\nwalking. He then heard the sound of two gunshots and\nobserved the victim \u2018\u2018hit the ground.\u2019\u2019 After the peti-\ntioner drove away, the victim approached Stewart and\ntold him that the petitioner had fired the shots in his\ndirection but that he was unsure whether the petitioner\nwas trying to shoot him. Later that night, the victim,\nStewart, and others celebrated the victim\u2019s birthday at\na local night club. At some point that evening, the victim\nwent outside and fell asleep in the Lumina, which was\nparked in front of the club. At around 1:30 a.m., Stewart,\nJoseph Smith, and two other men, left in the Lumina\nwith the victim, who was still asleep. Shortly after driv-\ning away from the club, Stewart pulled over to the side\nof Lenox Street, and several of the vehicle\u2019s occupants\nsmoked marijuana.\n   Thereafter, the petitioner pulled very closely along\nthe driver\u2019s side of the Lumina in the Monte Carlo and\nfired four shots in its direction. After the petitioner had\ndriven away, Stewart and the other men in the Lumina\nrealized that the victim had been shot. Police and emer-\ngency medical personnel arrived on the scene shortly\nafter one of the men summoned help, but the victim\nultimately died from his injuries.\n  On May 6, 1999, the day after the shooting, the police\ntook a voluntary statement from Smith, who recalled\nanother passenger yelling, \u2018\u2018that\u2019s Troy,\u2019\u2019 when the\nMonte Carlo pulled up. On May 8, 1999, the police took a\nvoluntary statement from Stewart, who recalled hearing\nsomeone yell, \u2018\u2018Yo, that\u2019s Troy,\u2019\u2019 and observed someone\n\fthat appeared to be the petitioner just before shots\nwere fired. On May 13, 1999, the police took a voluntary\nstatement from Jesse Campbell. Campbell explained\nthat just prior to the shooting the petitioner pulled into\na Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in a Monte Carlo\nand parked next to him. Campbell stated that he recog-\nnized the petitioner because they had lived near each\nother for about two years, and they waved to each other\nwhile in the parking lot. A short while later, Campbell\nwatched as the Monte Carlo turned off its headlights,\nproceeded down Lenox Street, and drove alongside the\nLumina. He then heard shots being fired and observed\nflashes coming from the Monte Carlo. The Monte Carlo\nsped away, and Campbell observed the petitioner as\nits only occupant. Campbell identified a picture of the\nMonte Carlo as the vehicle he saw the petitioner driving\non night of the shooting, and he identified a photograph\nof the petitioner from a photographic array.\n   The petitioner was tried and convicted of murder in\nviolation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a in Hartford in\n2000. At trial, the state\u2019s evidence included the following\nrelevant testimony from Campbell, Smith, and Stewart.\nCampbell testified about his observation of the Monte\nCarlo and the petitioner on the night of the shooting.\nHe also identified the petitioner in court, and he identi-\nfied the photograph of petitioner he selected from a\nphotographic array he was shown when he gave his\nstatement to the police. Smith testified that he was a\npassenger in the Lumina when the shooting occurred,\nbut he stated that he did not see who fired the shots\nbecause he \u2018\u2018ducked\u2019\u2019 down until after the shooter drove\naway. He also explained that he did not remember much\nabout the night of the shooting because he had con-\nsumed about six shots of alcohol and six marijuana\njoints and had suffered permanent memory loss from\na brain injury in August 1999. Finally, Stewart testified\nthat he was driving the Lumina on the night of the\nshooting and that he remembered a Monte Carlo pulling\nup very closely alongside the Lumina. Stewart testified\nthat he looked into the Monte Carlo to see who was\ndriving and, seconds before the shots were fired,\nshouted, \u2018\u2018That\u2019s Troy!\u2019\u2019 Stewart also stated that he rec-\nognized the Monte Carlo as being the same vehicle that\nhe had seen the petitioner driving earlier that evening.\nAfter his conviction, the petitioner filed a direct appeal,\nand this court affirmed the petitioner\u2019s conviction on\nMarch 19, 2002. State v. Westberry, 68 Conn. App. 622,\n638, 792 A.2d 154, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 923, 797 A.2d\n519 (2002).\n   On December 30, 2003, Campbell and his mother had\na conversation over a monitored telephone line while he\nwas incarcerated on unrelated criminal charges. During\nthat conversation, Campbell opined that the prosecutor\nrecently discussed in open court the fact that he testi-\nfied for the state in the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. In the\nrecorded conversation, Campbell repeatedly expressed\n\fhis concern that people in jail were going to find out\nthat he testified for the state. At one point during the\nconversation, Campbell said: \u2018\u2018Well of course that I lied;\nI don\u2019t know nothing about that shit, what?\u2019\u2019 The\nrecording of the conversation between Campbell and\nhis mother subsequently was disclosed to the peti-\ntioner.\n   On January 14, 2003, the petitioner filed his first peti-\ntion for a writ of habeas corpus, in which he claimed\nactual innocence and a due process violation based on\nCampbell\u2019s purported perjury. Westberry v. Commis-\nsioner of Correction, Superior Court, judicial district\nof New Haven, Docket No. CV-03-0473101-S, (Septem-\nber 15, 2011), aff\u2019d, 141 Conn. App. 901, 59 A.3d 1205\n(2013). On June 7, 2011, the first habeas court, Zoarski,\nJ., conducted an evidentiary hearing at which the peti-\ntioner presented the testimony of James Ouludsen, the\npetitioner\u2019s investigator, and Assistant State\u2019s Attorney\nVicki Melchiorre.2 Ouludsen testified that on June 17,\n2007 he interviewed and took a statement from Camp-\nbell. In that statement, Campbell denied knowing the\npetitioner or seeing him at the time of the shooting\nincident and admitted to lying at the petitioner\u2019s crimi-\nnal trial. Melchiorre testified that she was the attorney\nthat prosecuted the petitioner at his criminal trial. She\ntestified that Campbell was reluctant to testify at the\npetitioner\u2019s criminal trial because he was concerned\nabout his safety in prison and because \u2018\u2018he didn\u2019t want\nto be labeled as a snitch.\u2019\u2019 On September 15, 2011, the\nfirst habeas court denied the petitioner\u2019s first habeas\npetition because the petitioner failed to establish that\nhe was actually innocent of murder or that his convic-\ntion was the result of a due process violation. Westberry\nv. Commissioner of Correction, supra. In particular,\nthe first habeas court found that it could not \u2018\u2018judge the\ncredibility of the alleged recantations of Jesse Campbell\nin the absence of his testimony under oath and subject\nto cross-examination.\u2019\u2019 Id. This court summarily\naffirmed the judgment of the first habeas court. Westb-\nerry v. Commissioner of Correction, 141 Conn. App.\n901, 59 A.2d 1205 (2013).\n   On June 5, 2012, Smith participated in a proffer ses-\nsion3 with federal authorities in which he stated that\nhe had lied at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial about not\nremembering anything about the shooting incident. He\nclaimed that when the petitioner pulled alongside the\nLumina, he observed \u2018\u2018Bub,\u2019\u2019 subsequently identified as\nLorenza Mack, in the front passenger seat of the Monte\nCarlo . At the proffer session, Smith stated that he\nattempted to fire a nine millimeter firearm at the Monte\nCarlo, but the firearm malfunctioned and did not fire.4\nSmith then claimed that he saw Mack produce a firearm\nand shoot at the Lumina before he and the petitioner\ndrove away. After the proffer session, a federal agent\nthat participated in the proffer session prepared a writ-\nten report summarizing Smith\u2019s statements (proffer\n\fstatement). A copy of the proffer statement was subse-\nquently provided to Smith and the petitioner.\n   On November 19, 2014, the petitioner filed an\namended petition for a writ of habeas corpus (second\nhabeas petition), which is the subject of this appeal. In\nthis action, the petitioner alleged actual innocence and\na due process violation based on the purported perjury\nof Campbell and Smith at his criminal trial.5 On January\n5, 2015, the second habeas court, Schuman, J., con-\nducted hearing trial at which the petitioner presented\nthe testimony of the following witnesses.6\n   The first witness presented by the petitioner was\nSmith, who testified by telephone from a federal correc-\ntional facility. During his testimony, Smith stated that he\nnever reviewed the proffer statement, and he disagreed\nwith the federal agent\u2019s summary of his statements on\nmultiple occasions, particularly concerning the order\nof events during the shooting incident.7 Smith also pro-\nvided equivocal testimony concerning the shooting\nitself. Smith stated on multiple occasions that he\n\u2018\u2018believed\u2019\u2019 that Mack was the shooter rather than peti-\ntioner8 because that was the rumor on the street. In\nparticular, Smith explained that \u2018\u2018being that I was\nyounger than most of them, I never really knew them\n[i.e., the petitioner or Mack], but I was in the car that\nnight and that\u2019s who everybody believes it was [i.e.,\nMack]. That was the rumor on the street.\u2019\u2019\n   The petitioner then presented the testimony of Jill\nTherriault, a forensic firearms examiner, and Stewart\nto corroborate Smith\u2019s proffer statement to federal\nauthorities. Therriault testified that she inspected the\nunfired nine millimeter cartridges that were recovered\nfrom the scene of the shooting, but she could not iden-\ntify or eliminate them as having been cycled through\nthe type of firearm Smith said he attempted to shoot\nat the Monte Carlo. Stewart testified that a defense\ninvestigator had shown him Smith\u2019s proffer statement,\nbut, during the second habeas trial, he gave equivocal\ntestimony concerning its accuracy. On direct examina-\ntion, Stewart was asked whether Smith\u2019s proffer state-\nment said that \u2018\u2018Mack was the shooter and that he fired\nand Troy drove away,\u2019\u2019 and Stewart replied, \u2018\u2018Yes.\u2019\u2019 Stew-\nart was then asked, \u2018\u2018isn\u2019t that true?\u2019\u2019 and he replied,\n\u2018\u2018Yes.\u2019\u2019 On cross-examination, however, Stewart\nacknowledged that in his statement to the police on May\n8, 1999, two days after the shooting, he never mentioned\nMack. He also acknowledged that he never mentioned\nMack at trial and that he testified that he yelled, \u2018\u2018That\u2019s\nTroy,\u2019\u2019 when the Monte Carlo pulled up next to them.\nOn redirect examination, Stewart was asked again if\nSmith\u2019s proffer statement was \u2018\u2018the true version of the\nevents,\u2019\u2019 and he replied, \u2018\u2018Sort of, yes.\u2019\u2019 Later, when\nasked about whether he remembered Smith attempting\nto shoot at the Monte Carlo, Stewart replied, \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t\nknow about that,\u2019\u2019 and when he was asked if he wanted\n\fto look at Smith\u2019s statement again, he replied, \u2018\u2018Some-\nthing ain\u2019t right.\u2019\u2019\n   The petitioner\u2019s final two witnesses were Thomas\nDavis and Jason Douglas, who were called to establish\nthat Mack shot the victim, not the petitioner. Davis\ntestified that Mack was \u2018\u2018jumped\u2019\u2019 by the victim and two\nother men three months before the shooting. Douglas,\na defense investigator, testified about his interview of\nGuy Eugene, who is currently serving a sentence for\nkilling Mack. Douglas explained that Eugene told him\nthat he killed Mack in retaliation for the victim\u2019s death,\nand he then prepared a written statement of their dis-\ncussion. Douglas stated that he gave Eugene an oppor-\ntunity to look at his notes but that Eugene declined to\nsign the statement he prepared.\n   In addition to the testimony of these witnesses, the\nhabeas court admitted several exhibits, including all of\nthe transcripts from the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, the\ntranscripts from the petitioner\u2019s first habeas trial,\nCampbell\u2019s telephone conversation with his mother,\nCampbell\u2019s sworn statement,9 Smith\u2019s proffer state-\nment,10 and the affidavit by Douglas in which he memori-\nalized Eugene\u2019s purported statements to him\n(Eugene\u2019s statement).11\n   On February 18, 2015, the second habeas court issued\na written memorandum of decision denying the petition-\ner\u2019s second habeas petition. In that memorandum, the\ncourt discredited the testimony and statements of Smith\nand Stewart as well as the statements made by Campbell\nand Eugene.12 Concerning Smith, the court found that\nhis testimony at the hearing was not credible because\n\u2018\u2018his testimony at the hearing on the shooting was hesi-\ntant, saying he does not \u2018believe\u2019 the shooter was the\npetitioner and that he \u2018believes\u2019 the shooter was Lorenza\nMack. He also admitted that some of his proffer, particu-\nlarly concerning the order of events during the shooting\nincident, was wrong.\u2019\u2019 The court observed: \u2018\u2018It is hard\nto see how he could have remembered so little in 2000,\none year after the shooting, perhaps understandably\nbecause he was under the influence of alcohol and\ndrugs, and yet recant and identify the shooter twelve\nand fourteen years after the incident.\u2019\u2019\n   Concerning Stewart, the court noted that Stewart\u2019s\ntestimony was \u2018\u2018extremely hesitant\u2019\u2019 and that \u2018\u2018[h]e pro-\nvided only reluctant answers in response to leading\nquestions.\u2019\u2019 The court observed: \u2018\u2018There was no mention\nin [Stewart\u2019s] virtually contemporaneous [sworn] state-\nment [to the police two days after the shooting] of\nLorenza Mack or Bub, thus casting grave doubt on the\nveracity of Stewart\u2019s testimony at the habeas trial over\nfourteen years later.\u2019\u2019\n    Concerning Campbell, the court found that, after\nreviewing Campbell\u2019s phone call and sworn statement,\n\u2018\u2018it cannot put any weight on his alleged recantations\n\fin the absence of seeing Campbell in person and having\nhim face cross-examination.\u2019\u2019\n   Finally, the court \u2018\u2018attach[ed] no weight to Eugene\u2019s\nstatement\u2019\u2019 because \u2018\u2018[t]he affidavit consisted of the\ninvestigator\u2019s rendition of Eugene\u2019s oral statements,\u2019\u2019\n\u2018\u2018Eugene himself declined to sign a written statement,\u2019\u2019\nand the affidavit stated that Eugene would be willing\nto testify in court, which was untrue. The court also\nobserved: \u2018\u2018Eugene\u2019s motive or state of mind as to why\nhe would kill Mack is essentially irrelevant and does\nnot in any way constitute reliable evidence as to who\nkilled [the victim].\u2019\u201913\n   In its memorandum of decision, the second habeas\ncourt also rejected the petitioner\u2019s actual innocence\nand due process claims. The court articulated several\nbases for its conclusion. In relevant part, the court\nrejected the petitioner\u2019s actual innocence claim on the\nmerits because he \u2018\u2018failed to prove by clear and convinc-\ning evidence that he is actually innocent of murder\nand that no reasonable jury would find him guilty.\u2019\u2019 In\nparticular, the court observed that \u2018\u2018[t]he petitioner\u2019s\ncase instead rested almost entirely on the recantations\nof the key witnesses,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018[o]ur law views such recan-\ntations with skepticism.\u2019\u2019 Furthermore, the court\nexplained that \u2018\u2018there are good reasons to remain highly\nskeptical of the recantations in this case. In addition\nto those specific reasons, there is the more general\nconcern that the petitioner did not offer any valid expla-\nnation, such as a mistaken identification, why the\nrecanting witnesses would all proceed to provide false\ntestimony at the criminal trial and, with the exception\nof Smith, implicate the petitioner.\u2019\u2019\n   The court also rejected the petitioner\u2019s due process\nclaim on the merits. The court first explained that the\npetitioner had withdrawn the claim in his petition that\nthe state knew or should have known that false testi-\nmony was presented at the criminal trial. Nonetheless,\nthe court explained that the petitioner, relying on\nOrtega v. Duncan, 333 F.3d 102 (2d Cir. 2003), claimed\nthat \u2018\u2018the court should grant habeas relief because the\njury relied on perjured, material testimony, even if the\nstate did not know . . . of the perjury.\u2019\u2019 Although the\ncourt observed that \u2018\u2018Connecticut . . . has not adopted\nthe Ortega rule,\u2019\u2019 it nonetheless held that, regardless, the\ndefendant could not prevail under the Ortega standard\nbecause he failed to establish that \u2018\u2018the witnesses pre-\nsented false testimony at trial and that their recanta-\ntions are true.\u2019\u2019\n                             I\n  We first address the petitioner\u2019s claim that the habeas\ncourt erroneously concluded that his due process rights\nwere not violated by the use of perjured testimony at\nhis criminal trial. The petitioner has withdrawn any\nclaim that the state knew or should have known that\n\fit was presenting purportedly perjured testimony, and,\ninstead, he argues that \u2018\u2018the use of perjured testimony\n[in his criminal trial], even absent the [s]tate\u2019s knowl-\nedge, is a violation of due process. . . .\u2019\u2019 It remains\nan open question in Connecticut whether the state\u2019s\nunknowing use of perjured testimony at trial can violate\ndue process. Gould v. Commissioner of Correction, 301\nConn. 544, 570\u201371 and n.18, 22 A.3d 1196 (2011). The\nmajority of jurisdictions require a habeas petitioner to\nprove that the state knew or should have known that\nit was presenting false testimony to raise a due process\nclaim. Id., 570 n.18. However, a minority of jurisdictions,\nincluding the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit, have held that the use of perjured testi-\nmony at trial by itself, even without the state\u2019s knowl-\nedge of its falsity, can give rise to a due process claim.\nId; see, e.g., Ortega v. Duncan, supra, 333 F.3d 108. We\nconclude that it is unnecessary for us to resolve whether\nConnecticut recognizes a due process claim based on\nthe state\u2019s unknowing use of perjured testimony\nbecause we agree with the second habeas court that\nthe petitioner failed to establish that perjured testimony\nwas used at his criminal trial.\n   To support his claim that his conviction was based\non the use of perjured testimony, the petitioner relies\non Campbell\u2019s and Smith\u2019s recantations. However, the\nhabeas court explicitly discredited these recantations.\nIt is well established that \u2018\u2018[t]his court does not retry\nthe case or evaluate the credibility of witnesses. Rather,\nwe must defer to the [trier of fact\u2019s] assessment of\nthe credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand\nobservation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude.\u2019\u2019\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Jackson v. Com-\nmissioner of Correction, 149 Conn. App. 681, 711, 89\nA.3d 426 (2014), appeal dismissed, 321 Conn. 765, 138\nA.3d 278 (2016) (certification improvidently granted).\nWe cannot disturb the underlying credibility determina-\ntions or facts found by the habeas court unless they\nare clearly erroneous. State v. Buhl, 321 Conn. 688,\n708, 138 A.3d 868 (2016). The petitioner has failed to\nestablish that the second habeas court\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations were clearly erroneous.\n   Concerning Campbell, the court reasonably con-\ncluded that \u2018\u2018it [could not] put any weight on [Camp-\nbell\u2019s] alleged recantations in the absence of seeing\nCampbell in person and having him face cross-examina-\ntion.\u2019\u2019 The petitioner maintains that the court could\nhave, and should have, credited Campbell\u2019s recantation\nbecause Campbell invoked his fifth amendment right\nagainst self-incrimination and his statements were\nadmitted as statements against penal interest, which\nrequires \u2018\u2018a judicial determination of trustworthiness\u2019\u2019\nand \u2018\u2018must be accorded equivalent consideration as tes-\ntimony . . . .\u2019\u201914 We disagree. The court acted well\nwithin its discretion by declining to speculate as to\nwhy Campbell invoked his fifth amendment right not\n\fto testify. See Skakel v. State, 295 Conn. 447, 500, 991\nA.2d 414 (2010). The petitioner also erroneously con-\nflates admissibility with weight. When the habeas court\ndetermined that Campbell\u2019s statements were admissi-\nble, it was engaging in a gatekeeping function. See id.\nThe court simply determined that the evidence met the\nthreshold that would allow it to consider the evidence.\nIt was not acting in its capacity as the trier of fact to\ndetermine whether it would find the evidence credible.\nSee id., 479.15 The mere fact that a court determines\nthat evidence is admissible under the Connecticut Code\nof Evidence does not mean that the trier of fact must\nultimately credit that evidence.\n   The court also had an adequate factual basis for dis-\ncrediting Smith. Smith\u2019s testimony was hesitant and\nequivocal, and he merely stated that he \u2018\u2018believes\u2019\u2019 that\nMack was the shooter, not that he knows that Mack was\nthe shooter. Additionally, Smith repeatedly corrected\nportions of the proffer statement, particularly the\ndetails concerning the order of events during the shoot-\ning. The petitioner maintains that the court clearly erred\nin its credibility determination because Smith\u2019s recanta-\ntion was corroborated by Eugene\u2019s statement and Stew-\nart\u2019s and Theriault\u2019s testimony. However, the court\ndiscredited Eugene\u2019s statement because it was neither\nwritten nor signed by him and the investigator\u2019s affidavit\ncontained an incorrect assertion that Eugene was will-\ning to testify at the habeas trial. Additionally, Eugene\u2019s\nstatement merely addressed his purported reason for\nkilling Mack. The court also discredited Stewart\u2019s recan-\ntation because his testimony about the night of the\nshooting was \u2018\u2018extremely hesitant\u2019\u2019 and he was reluctant\nto answer even leading questions. Finally, although the\ncourt credited Theriault\u2019s testimony, that testimony\nmerely established that two nine millimeter bullets were\nrecovered from the Lumina and that they would fit in\nSmith\u2019s firearm, not that Smith saw Mack during the\nshooting incident.\n  Therefore, we conclude that the second habeas court\ndid not err in rejecting the petitioner\u2019s due process\nclaim.\n                            II\n   We now turn to the petitioner\u2019s claim that he is actu-\nally innocent. We begin our analysis by setting forth\nthe relevant legal principles and standard of review\nthat governs our analysis. In Miller v. Commissioner\nof Correction, 242 Conn. 745, 791\u201392, 700 A.2d 1108\n(1997), our Supreme Court articulated the standard of\nproof that a habeas corpus petitioner must satisfy in\norder to prevail on a claim of actual innocence: \u2018\u2018First,\ntaking into account both the evidence produced in the\noriginal criminal trial and the evidence produced in\nthe habeas hearing, the petitioner must persuade the\nhabeas court by clear and convincing evidence, as that\nstandard is properly understood and applied in the con-\n\ftext of such a claim,16 that the petitioner is actually\ninnocent of the crime of which he stands convicted.\nSecond, the petitioner must establish that, after consid-\nering all of that evidence and the inferences drawn\ntherefrom . . . no reasonable fact finder would find\nthe petitioner guilty.\u2019\u201917 (Footnote added.) Id., 791\u201392.\n   Under the first Miller prong, actual innocence means\n\u2018\u2018factual innocence,\u2019\u2019 not \u2018\u2018legal innocence,\u2019\u2019 and must\nbe \u2018\u2018demonstrated by affirmative proof that the peti-\ntioner did not commit the crime.\u2019\u2019 (Emphasis added.)\nGould v. Commissioner of Correction, supra, 301 Conn.\n560\u201361. \u2018\u2018Affirmative proof of actual innocence is that\nwhich might tend to establish that the petitioner could\nnot have committed the crime even though it is\nunknown who committed the crime, that a third party\ncommitted the crime or that no crime actually\noccurred.\u2019\u2019 (Emphasis in original.) Id., 563. \u2018\u2018Recanta-\ntions of inculpatory criminal trial testimony undoubt-\nedly are relevant to a determination of innocence. But\nevidence of that nature must be accompanied by affir-\nmative evidence of innocence to meet Miller\u2019s standard\nof clear and convincing evidence.18 (Emphasis in origi-\nnal.) Id., 564.\n   Our standard of review for claims of actual innocence\nis twofold. \u2018\u2018The appropriate scope of review [for the\nfirst Miller prong] is whether, after an independent and\nscrupulous examination of the entire record, we are\nconvinced that the finding of the habeas court . . . is\nsupported by substantial evidence.\u2019\u2019 Miller v. Commis-\nsioner of Correction, supra, 242 Conn. 803. In contrast,\nthe plenary standard of review applies to the second\nMiller prong. Id., 805.\n   In the present case, the petitioner\u2019s claim of actual\ninnocence is based on Campbell\u2019s and Smith\u2019s discred-\nited recantations as well as Eugene\u2019s discredited state-\nment. The petitioner offers no credible or affirmative\nevidence of his actual innocence. The only nonrecanta-\ntion evidence offered at the second habeas trial was\nevidence that (1) two nine millimeter bullets were\nrecovered from the Lumina, (2) Mack was \u2018\u2018jumped\u2019\u2019 by\nthe victim and two other men three months before\nthe shooting, and (3) Eugene shot Mack because he\nbelieved, based on street rumors, that Mack shot the\nvictim. Even if this evidence were accepted as true,\nnone of it constitutes affirmative evidence of the peti-\ntioner\u2019s actual, factual innocence. \u2018\u2018[I]t is important to\nunderscore that courts universally view recantation evi-\ndence with a healthy dose of skepticism.\u2019\u2019 Gould v.\nCommissioner of Correction, supra, 301 Conn. 568. One\nof the reasons that reviewing courts are highly skeptical\nof recantations is that recantations can often be out of\nsympathy for the petitioner rather than a desire to\n\u2018\u2018come clean\u2019\u2019 about prior perjury. Id., 568 n.17. Our\nreview of the record reveals that the impetus for the\nwitnesses\u2019 recantations might well be the street rumors\n\fthat Mack was the shooter, rather than personal knowl-\nedge that Mack was in the Monte Carlo the night of the\nshooting and that Mack shot the victim.19\n   We conclude for the foregoing reasons and after an\nindependent and scrupulous examination of the entire\nrecord that the habeas court did not err in denying the\npetitioner\u2019s actual innocence claim because the peti-\ntioner did not meet his burden under the first prong\nof Miller.20\n      The judgment is affirmed.\n      In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  1\n     The habeas court granted the petition for certification to appeal. See\nGeneral Statutes \u00a7 52-470.\n   2\n     The petitioner attempted to call Campbell as a witness at his first habeas\ntrial, but Campbell invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimi-\nnation.\n   3\n     Under the federal sentencing guidelines, the federal government may file\na motion on behalf of a defendant that has \u2018\u2018provided substantial assistance in\nthe investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an\noffense\u2019\u2019 in which it asks the court to depart from the sentencing guidelines\nat sentencing, including a departure below a mandatory minimum sentence.\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. A \u2018\u2018proffer session\u2019\u2019 is the meeting between federal authori-\nties, the defendant, and his counsel at which the defendant makes a state-\nment concerning his or other individuals\u2019 criminal conduct. Depending on\nthe content of the defendant\u2019s statement and his credibility, the government\nmay or may not filed a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion with the court prior to sentencing.\nAt sentencing, when deciding whether to depart from the guidelines based\non a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, the court may consider, inter alia, \u2018\u2018the truthfulness,\ncompleteness, and reliability of any information or testimony provided by\nthe defendant.\u2019\u2019 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 (a) (2).\n   4\n     During his brief, and reluctant, trial testimony, Smith did not mention\nthat he attempted to shoot at the Monte Carlo. In relevant part, he engaged\nin the following colloquy with the prosecutor:\n   \u2018\u2018Q. All right. Do you recall seeing whether or not a car pulled up next\nto you?\n   \u2018\u2018A. Yeah. A car pulled up. Yeah, a car pulled up.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. Okay. Then what happened?\n   \u2018\u2018A. They started shooting. Somebody started shooting.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. Okay. Did you see who started shooting? Is that a no?\n   \u2018\u2018A. No.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. What did you see?\n   \u2018\u2018A. I seen\u2014I just looked. I seen a car, and I ducked. I just ducked.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. You always duck every time a car comes near you? What made\nyou duck?\n   \u2018\u2018A. \u2018Cause\n   \u2018\u2018Q. \u2018Cause why?\n   \u2018\u2018A. \u2018Cause, you know, I just ducked.\u2019\u2019\n   5\n     The respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, argues that any claim\nof actual innocence or a due process violation based on Campbell\u2019s recanta-\ntion is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. As we have disposed of the\npetitioner\u2019s claim on other grounds, we need not address this argument.\nSee Edwards v. Commissioner of Correction, 141 Conn. App. 430, 431\nn.1, 63 A.3d 540, cert. denied, 308 Conn. 940, 66 A.3d 882 (2013); Cole v.\nCommissioner of Correction, 126 Conn. App. 775, 777 n.1, 12 A.3d 1065\n(per curiam), cert. denied, 300 Conn. 937, 17 A.3d 473 (2011).\n   6\n     The petitioner attempted to call Campbell and Eugene to testify, but\nthey both invoked their fifth amendment right against self-incrimination.\n   7\n     For example, the following exchange occurred between the petitioner\u2019s\ncounsel and Smith during direct examination:\n   \u2018\u2018Q. Okay. Sir, if I read you the portion of the proffer session, would that\nrefresh your recollection as to the order of events?\n   \u2018\u2018A. It might.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. Okay. It says: \u2018Smith attempted to fire the TEK-9 at [the petitioner\u2019s]\ncar but the TEK-9 malfunctioned and didn\u2019t fire. Smith then saw Bub [i.e.,\nMack] produce a firearm and proceed to shoot in the car occupied by Smith.\u2019\nDoes that refresh your recollection?\n   \u2018\u2018A. No, I don\u2019t think it happened like that.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. No, you don\u2019t think it happened like that?\n\f   \u2018\u2018A. No.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. All right. This is certainly what you told the [federal] agents.\n   \u2018\u2018A. No.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. At any time with your discussions with your lawyers or [the federal]\nprosecutors or the [federal] agents, did you ever tell them that you were\nfired upon first and then you tried to fire?\n   \u2018\u2018A. I\u2019m not sure.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. All right. After\u2014you know that you were ordered to be truthful in\nthis statement. Correct?\n   \u2018\u2018A. Correct.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. And that the 5K [motion] would not be given to you unless you told\nthe truth to the [federal] agents and to the [assistant United States attorney].\n   \u2018\u2018A. That\u2019s true.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. And now you\u2019re saying that what\u2019s in the report is not true.\n   \u2018\u2018A. I\u2019m not saying that. I\u2019m just saying I can\u2019t remember if that\u2019s how\nit happened.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. Well, can you not remember?\n   \u2018\u2018A. No, you know, I also had a brain injury.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. Okay. We understand that, but when you spoke to the [federal] agents,\nyou gave them [a] very specific order as to how things happened, isn\u2019t that\ncorrect, according to this report?\n   \u2018\u2018A. It could appear like that, but I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s how it happened.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. All right. Well, did you make any corrections to the [federal]\nagent\u2019s report?\n   \u2018\u2018A. No, I never seen it.\u2019\u2019\n   8\n     For example, the following exchange occurred between the petitioner\u2019s\ncounsel and Smith during direct examination:\n   \u2018\u2018Q. . . . Do you recall a car pulling up alongside the car that you were in?\n   \u2018\u2018A. Yeah.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. Do you recall being able to see the driver of the car?\n   \u2018\u2018A. I mean it was blurry, but yeah.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. Okay. And who was the driver?\n   \u2018\u2018A. Well, I believe it was [the petitioner\u2019s].\n   \u2018\u2018Q. Okay.\n   \u2018\u2018A. That\u2019s what I believe.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. All right. Could you see someone else in the front seat passenger of\n[the petitioner\u2019s] car?\n   \u2018\u2018A. Yeah.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. And who was that?\n   \u2018\u2018A. I believe that was, um, Bub.\n   \u2018\u2018Q. Okay. Is Bub also known as Lorenz[a] Mack?\n   \u2018\u2018A. Yeah.\n                                       ***\n   \u2018\u2018Q. Okay. And so did you attempt to shoot at [the petitioner\u2019s] car?\n   \u2018\u2018A. I think they fired. They already fired.\u2019\u2019\n                                       ***\n   \u2018\u2018Q. And you reiterated is it true that [the petitioner]] did not shoot or\nfire on the car that you were in. Is that correct?\n   \u2018\u2018A. Yeah, I don\u2019t believe it was him.\u2019\u2019 (Emphasis added.)\n   9\n     A transcript and recording of Campbell\u2019s phone conversation and Camp-\nbell\u2019s sworn statement were admitted as statements against penal interest.\n   10\n      The petitioner offered and the court admitted Smith\u2019s proffer statement\nas a prior inconsistent statement.\n   11\n      When Eugene invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimina-\ntion, the court admitted Douglas\u2019 affidavit about their meeting into evidence\nonly for nonhearsay purposes, i.e., for establishing that Eugene\u2019s motive\nfor killing Mack was his belief, based on street rumors, that Mack killed\nthe victim.\n   12\n      The court credited the testimony of Davis and Therriault, but ultimately\nconcluded that their testimony did not support the petitioner\u2019s claim.\n   13\n      The court emphasized that the investigator\u2019s description of Eugene\u2019s\nclaim that \u2018\u2018 \u2018it is well known on the street\u2019 \u2019\u2019 that Mack killed the victim\nwas not admitted \u2018\u2018for the truth of the matter but rather it [was admitted]\nonly for the nonhearsay purpose of showing Eugene\u2019s motive or state of\nmind, to the extent that the latter was relevant.\u2019\u2019\n   14\n      Section 8-6 (4) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence provides: \u2018\u2018State-\nment against penal interest. A trustworthy statement against penal interest\nthat, at the time of its making, so far tended to subject the declarant to\ncriminal liability that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would\nnot have made the statement unless the person believed it to be true. In\ndetermining the trustworthiness of a statement against penal interest, the\ncourt shall consider (A) the time the statement was made and the person\nto whom the statement was made, (B) the existence of corroborating evi-\n\fdence in the case, and (C) the extent to which the statement was against\nthe declarant\u2019s penal interest.\u2019\u2019\n   15\n      We note that the petitioner argues in his brief that Skakel supports his\nargument that \u2018\u2018the only adverse inference that may be logically inferred\n[from Campbell\u2019s invocation of his fifth amendment right], is that Jesse\nCampbell\u2019s trial testimony was perjured.\u2019\u2019 In particular, he quotes a portion of\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s summary of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision,\nwithout attribution, to support his assertion that \u2018\u2018[b]y refusing to testify as\nto the veracity of his testimony at the [p]etitioner\u2019s criminal trial, Mr. Camp-\nbell is acknowledging criminal liability [from his trial testimony].\u2019\u2019 We\nobserve that Skakel is squarely adverse to the petitioner\u2019s position with\nrespect to Campbell. In Skakel, the defendant sought a new trial based on\nstatements by Gitano Bryant that inculpated two other persons in the victim\u2019s\nmurder. Skakel v. State, supra, 295 Conn. 468. While the court admitted\nBryant\u2019s statement as a statement against penal interest after Bryant invoked\nhis fifth amendment right against self-incrimination, it ultimately did not\ncredit Bryant\u2019s statement. Id., 473\u201377. In affirming the trial court\u2019s decision,\nthe Supreme Court not only \u2018\u2018decline[d] to speculate as to why Bryant\ninvoked his fifth amendment right not to testify\u2019\u2019 but also held that the court\ndid not abuse its discretion by \u2018\u2018concluding that Bryant\u2019s account, while\nsufficiently trustworthy to be admissible, \u2018is absent any genuine corrobora-\ntion . . . lacks credibility, and therefore, would not produce a different\nresult in a new trial.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Id., 500\u2013501.\n   16\n      \u2018\u2018The clear and convincing standard of proof is substantially greater\nthan the usual civil standard of a preponderance of the evidence, but less\nthan the highest legal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. It is\nsustained if the evidence induces in the mind of the trier a reasonable belief\nthat the facts asserted are highly probably true, that the probability that\nthey are true or exist is substantially greater than the probability that they\nare false or do not exist. . . . [T]he clear and convincing evidence standard\nshould operate as a weighty caution upon the minds of all judges, and it\nforbids relief whenever the evidence is loose, equivocal or contradictory.\u2019\u2019\n(Emphasis in original; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\nMiller v. Commissioner of Correction, supra, 242 Conn. 794\u201395.\n   17\n      \u2018\u2018There are two types of actual innocence claims: Gateway and freestand-\ning. In a freestanding claim of actual innocence, \u2018there is no claim of an\nantecedent constitutional violation that affected the result of [the] criminal\ntrial. Such a freestanding claim is to be contrasted with what has come to\nbe known in federal habeas jurisprudence as a \u2018\u2018gateway\u2019\u2019 claim of actual\ninnocence. Such a claim serves as a gateway to permit federal habeas review\nof an otherwise procedurally barred state conviction that the petitioner\nasserts is constitutionally flawed\u2019; Miller v. Commissioner of Correction,\n[supra, 242 Conn. 788 n. 28]; it is \u2018[a] claim based on an antecedent constitu-\ntional violation that affects the results of the criminal trial . . . .\u2019 Id., 813\nn. 7 (Berdon, J., concurring and dissenting).\u2019\u2019 Rivera v.

Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 115 S. Ct. 851,\n130 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1995). We disagree. \u2018\u2018Neither this court nor our Supreme\nCourt has expressly recognized the viability of a gateway claim of actual\ninnocence in this state. In the federal courts, a habeas petitioner may assert\na claim of actual innocence to circumvent a procedural obstacle [under\nfederal statutory law] that would otherwise operate to bar review of a claim\nof constitutional error affecting the criminal trial. See [Schlup v. Delo, supra],\n314. Such an actual innocence claim is thus \u2018a gateway through which a\nhabeas petitioner must pass to have his otherwise barred constitutional\nclaim considered on the merits.\u2019 Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 404, 113\nS. Ct. 853, 112 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1993).\u2019\u2019 Rivera v. Commissioner of Correction,\nsupra, 70 Conn. App. 461; see also Rivas v. Fischer, 687 F.3d 514, 541 (2d Cir.\n2012) (\u2018\u2018A claim of actual innocence under Schlup is therefore procedural, not\nsubstantive. . . . The petitioner raising such a claim does not seek to have\nhis conviction vacated on grounds of innocence; rather, he seeks to create\nsufficient doubt about his guilt that the habeas court will permit him to\npursue his accompanying constitutional claims notwithstanding an other-\nwise applicable procedural bar.\u2019\u2019 [Citation omitted.]). In the present case,\nthe petitioner was not confronted with any procedural impediments to\nreview of his actual innocence claim, and, indeed, the habeas court and this\ncourt have fully addressed the merits of that claim. The petitioner was\ntherefore in no need of a \u2018\u2018gateway.\u2019\u2019\n\f   18\n      Our Supreme Court has not addressed whether a habeas petitioner must\nsupport his claim of actual innocence with newly discovered evidence. \u2018\u2018This\ncourt, nevertheless, has held that a claim of actual innocence must be based\non newly discovered evidence. [A] writ of habeas corpus cannot issue unless\nthe petitioner first demonstrates that the evidence put forth in support of\nhis claim of actual innocence is newly discovered. . . . This evidentiary\nburden is satisfied if a petitioner can demonstrate, by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, that the proffered evidence could not have been discovered\nprior to the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial by the exercise of due diligence.\u2019\u2019\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Jackson v. Commissioner of Correction,\nsupra, 149 Conn.

We have held\nthat information that the petitioner \u2018\u2018had personal knowledge of from his\nown experience and activities . . . is not, as a matter of law, newly discov-\nered evidence.\u2019\u2019 Morant v.

State, 259 Conn. 811, 830 n.13, 792 A.2d 797 (2002); see, e.g., State\nv. White, 76 Conn. App. 509, 513, 819 A.2d 932 (2003) (victim\u2019s recantation did\nnot constitute newly discovered evidence where defendant knew at time of\nplea hearing that victim, who had resumed a relationship with the defendant,\nwas uncooperative with police, and wanted to avoid his incarceration). The\npetitioner maintains, however, that \u2018\u2018[t]he newly discovered evidence is not\nMr. Mack\u2019s culpability, but rather the recantations of three of the [s]tate\u2019s\nwitnesses: Jesse Campbell, Joseph Smith, and Dwayne Stewart.\u2019\u2019\n   Even if we assume, without deciding, that the recantations and Eugene\u2019s\nstatement constitute newly discovered evidence, however, the petitioner\u2019s\nactual innocence claim fails on the merits.\n   19\n      \u2018\u2018They say\u2019\u2019 is often a great liar, according to the Irish proverb. Accord\nConn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-2.\n   20\n      Accordingly, we need not address whether the petitioner has satisfied\nMiller\u2019s second prong. See Gould v. Commissioner of Correction, supra,\n301 Conn. 559 n.14 (\u2018\u2018That examination [of the Miller test] suggests to us\nthat there may not be any case in which the first prong [of the Miller test]\nis not dispositive of the petition. . . . Indeed . . . the first prong of Miller\nsets forth the heart of an actual innocence claim.\u2019\u2019); see, e.g., Jackson v.\nCommissioner of Correction, supra, 149 Conn. App. 713\u201314.\n\f",
