Carlson was convicted following two trials in the superior\ncourt. At both of these trials, Carlson was represented by Allen Dayan, a private\ncriminal defense attorney hired by Carlson\u2019s parents.\n              During the investigation of the homicide, Carlson (who was then seventeen\nyears old) gave conflicting accounts of Featherly\u2019s death to the police. Chief among\nthese accounts was Carlson\u2019s assertion that Featherly was shot by a black man named\n\u201cB\u201d or \u201cBee.\u201d But Carlson eventually told Dayan that these earlier accounts were false\n\u2014 that, in truth, Carlson accidentally shot Featherly while he was handling a pistol that\nFeatherly had recently purchased.\n              After Carlson told Dayan that he shot Featherly by accident, Dayan\narranged a new police interview for Carlson. At this interview, with Dayan\u2019s prompting\nand assistance, Carlson offered this new version of events to the police. (This interview\nwas videotaped and later shown at Carlson\u2019s trials.) Despite Carlson\u2019s assertion that the\nkilling had been accidental, the State charged him with first-degree murder (i.e.,\nintentionally killing Featherly).\n              Then, while Dayan and Carlson were preparing for trial, Carlson told Dayan\nthat the \u201caccidental shooting\u201d version of events was false. Carlson informed Dayan that\nhe intended to take the stand at trial and reaffirm his earlier assertion that Featherly was\nkilled by a black man named B.\n              Despite Carlson\u2019s recantation of the police confession that Dayan had\nhelped facilitate, Dayan continued to represent Carlson at both of his trials. At Carlson\u2019s\nfirst trial, the jury acquitted him of first-degree murder but was unable to reach a verdict\non the charge of second-degree murder. At Carlson\u2019s second trial, he was convicted of\nsecond-degree murder.\n\n                                           \u20132\u2013                                        2641\n\f              Carlson later filed an application for post-conviction relief asserting that he\nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel from Dayan. Specifically, Carlson contended\nthat Dayan acted incompetently when he failed to withdraw from the case after it became\nclear that Carlson intended to take the stand and repudiate the accidental shooting version\nof events that Dayan had actively facilitated and previously promoted as the truth.\n              The superior court ultimately granted post-conviction relief to Carlson. In\nits order granting relief, the superior court found that Dayan\u2019s active participation in\nCarlson\u2019s later repudiated videotaped confession constituted an \u201cactual conflict of\ninterest\u201d that gave rise to a \u201cnon-rebuttable presumption of prejudice.\u201d The superior\ncourt also found that Dayan\u2019s failure either to withdraw from Carlson\u2019s case, or to at\nleast seek a protective order that would have prevented the jury from knowing about\nDayan\u2019s involvement in the now-repudiated videotaped confession, constituted\nineffective assistance of counsel under Risher v. State.1\n              The State now appeals the superior court\u2019s decision, raising multiple claims\nof error. In its brief, the State attacks the superior court\u2019s analysis as unsupported by the\nrecord and legally flawed. For the reasons explained here, we agree with the State that\nthe superior court\u2019s conflict analysis is flawed and, in key respects, unsupported by the\nevidentiary record. We therefore reverse that ruling. We also conclude that there are\nsufficient questions about the superior court\u2019s findings and legal reasoning on the\nineffective assistance of counsel claim that a remand for further proceedings on that\nclaim is required.\n              The State also raises three additional claims of error on appeal. The State\nargues first that Carlson\u2019s application for post-conviction relief was time-barred, and\nthat the superior court erred when it allowed Carlson to pursue this application. We\n\n\n   1\n       Risher v. State, 523 P.2d 421 (Alaska 1974).\n\n                                            \u20133\u2013                                        2641\n\freject the State\u2019s arguments primarily on preservation grounds, and we affirm the\nsuperior court\u2019s timeliness ruling. The State also argues that Carlson was barred as a\nmatter of law from raising any ineffective assistance of counsel claims against his trial\nattorney under our decision in Arnett v. State.2 We disagree with the State\u2019s expansive\nreading of Arnett, and we affirm this aspect of the superior court\u2019s decision.\n              Lastly, the State argues that the superior court erred when it found that\nCarlson\u2019s appellate attorney was ineffective for failing to raise the issue of Dayan\u2019s\neffectiveness in Carlson\u2019s direct appeal. Carlson concedes that this aspect of the superior\ncourt\u2019s ruling is erroneous. This concession is well-taken, and we reverse this ruling.3\n\n\n       Factual background and prior proceedings\n              The police investigation\n              In the late evening of September 24, 1998, police found a vehicle parked\non the side of King Street in Anchorage. The car\u2019s engine and headlights were running\nand the parking brake was engaged. Both front doors were open. Inside the car, the\npolice discovered the body of seventeen-year-old George Featherly. Featherly\u2019s body\nwas in the driver\u2019s seat, covered up by a jacket. Featherly had been killed by a single\nclose-range gunshot to the back of his head. According to the medical examiner\u2019s\ntestimony at trial, the gun must have been fired only \u201cfractions of an inch\u201d from\nFeatherly\u2019s head.\n\n\n\n\n   2\n       Arnett v. State, 938 P.2d 1079 (Alaska App. 1997).\n   3\n       See Barry v. State, 675 P.2d 1292, 1295-96 (Alaska App. 1984) (noting that\nineffective assistance claims \u201cmust ordinarily be litigated in post-conviction relief\nproceedings\u201d because \u201cthe record of the trial proceedings will seldom conclusively establish\nincompetent representation\u201d).\n\n                                           \u20134\u2013                                        2641\n\f             During the initial investigation into Featherly\u2019s death, seventeen-year-old\nJason Carlson \u2014 Featherly\u2019s best friend \u2014 came under suspicion. Carlson initially told\npolice that he had lost track of Featherly at the nearby Dimond Center Mall around 7:30\np.m. on the day of the shooting. After the mall security tapes failed to corroborate\nCarlson\u2019s story, Carlson admitted to the police that he had been in Featherly\u2019s car when\nthe shooting took place. Carlson told the police that he and Featherly had left the\nDimond Center to purchase a gun from a man named \u201cB\u201d or \u201cBee\u201d \u2014 and that B, after\nattempting to rob Featherly, shot him in the back of the head while Featherly was\ndriving. According to Carlson\u2019s account, the car swerved, but Carlson was able to reach\nover, steer the car to the side of the road, and engage the emergency brake. As this was\nhappening, another car going the other direction passed by.\n             In this second version of events, Carlson claimed that, after the shooting,\nhe grabbed Featherly\u2019s Makarov pistol and shot B. Carlson also claimed that he jumped\ninto the back seat and struggled with B. (Carlson would later recant this portion of his\nstatement when he testified at his two trials.) Carlson also initially denied covering\nFeatherly\u2019s body with the jacket, suggesting to the police that B must have done that.\n             Carlson told the police that B fled soon after the shooting, taking the murder\nweapon with him. Carlson then also fled, taking Featherly\u2019s Makarov pistol with him.\nCarlson told the police that when he got home, he hid the Makarov pistol in his house\nand he called Featherly\u2019s pager in an attempt to create a false alibi for himself. (The\npolice were already aware of Carlson\u2019s call to Featherly\u2019s pager, and the police\nsubsequently located the Makarov pistol in Carlson\u2019s house inside of a stereo speaker\nwhere Carlson had told the police he hid it.)\n             In the next few weeks, the police investigated Carlson\u2019s \u201cB\u201d version of\nevents, but they were unable to find anyone who matched Carlson\u2019s description of B,\nnor anyone who had sought treatment for a gunshot wound that night. In their\n\n                                          \u20135\u2013                                        2641\n\fsubsequent interviews with Carlson, the police were openly skeptical of this version of\nevents. In one interview, the lead investigator, Detective Larry Arend, urged Carlson to\ntell the truth about what happened. Arend also told Carlson that it would be a \u201cwhole\nnew ballgame\u201d if Carlson had accidentally shot Featherly.\n              On October 20 Carlson\u2019s parents retained private criminal defense attorney\nAllen Dayan to advise Carlson in connection with the police investigation. Carlson at\nfirst told Dayan the same thing he told the police \u2014 that B shot Featherly. Dayan hired\nprivate investigators to try to locate B, and he passed on any leads to the police.4\n              A few weeks later, on November 6 Carlson\u2019s mother found what appeared\nto be a death threat outside Carlson\u2019s window. The death threat was composed of cut-out\nmagazine letters that read \u201cU will d [picture of an eye] 2nite II\u201d \u2014 i.e., \u201cyou will die\ntonight too.\u201d Carlson\u2019s mother gave the death threat to Dayan, who turned it over to the\npolice shortly before Carlson\u2019s first trial \u2014 in early February, 1999. After the police\nreceived the death threat, they subjected it to forensic testing and discovered Carlson\u2019s\nfingerprints in the tape that was used to attach the letters to the paper. At trial, Carlson\nadmitted that he fabricated the death threat note. He testified that he felt that the police\nwere not doing enough to find B, and he hoped that the fake death threat would prompt\nthem to step up their investigation.\n              On the same day that Carlson\u2019s mother found the fabricated death threat,\nthe police located the driver of the oncoming vehicle that passed by Featherly\u2019s car after\n\n\n   4\n       During the post-conviction relief discovery in this case, Carlson obtained recordings\nof Dayan\u2019s conversations with the police. None of these statements were played to the jury\nor known to Carlson prior to the post-conviction relief proceedings. In those recordings,\nDayan can be heard expressing skepticism to Detective Arend about Carlson\u2019s \u201cB\u201d version\nof events, including questioning why B would not have just shot Carlson too. Dayan also\ndisparages Carlson as \u201cnot terribly bright.\u201d The superior court refers to this recording in a\nfootnote, although the superior court does not directly explain its significance to its analysis.\n\n                                             \u20136\u2013                                           2641\n\fFeatherly was shot. The driver, Heather Dickens, later testified at both of Carlson\u2019s\ntrials.\n              In her trial testimony, Dickens described seeing Featherly\u2019s car erratically\nswerve, and she also described driving past the car and looking into the car as she passed.\nAs Dickens looked into the car, she saw one man, who \u201clooked like he was passed out,\u201d\nsitting in the driver\u2019s seat \u201cwith his head sort of back\u201d and his hands on the steering\nwheel. She also saw another man with his head by the driver\u2019s right shoulder. It looked\nto Dickens as if this second man was leaning forward between the front seats with his\nbody partially in the back seat.\n              Dickens admitted that she could not see fully into the back seat of the car,\nbut she was certain that there was nobody in the front passenger seat, and that there were\nonly two men in the car. Dickens was also \u201cpositive\u201d that the man in the back seat was\nnot black. (Carlson is not black.)\n              After interviewing Dickens on November 6, 1998, Detective Arend called\nDayan and told him that the police had an eyewitness, and that the eyewitness saw only\ntwo men in the car and did not see any black man in the car. Arend also told Dayan that\nthe district attorney\u2019s office was considering filing first-degree murder charges against\nCarlson.\n              Dayan informed Carlson of what he had learned from the detective.\nAccording to Dayan\u2019s testimony at the later post-conviction relief evidentiary hearing,\nCarlson responded to this information by asking, \u201cWhat if it [i.e., the shooting] was an\naccident?\u201d    In response, Dayan explained to Carlson that if he shot Featherly\naccidentally, he could face a charge of manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide,\nbut that either of these charges was much less serious than the first-degree murder charge\nthat the State was currently considering. According to Dayan, after he gave Carlson this\nexplanation, Carlson told Dayan that the B story was not true, and that the truth was that\n\n                                           \u20137\u2013                                       2641\n\fCarlson shot Featherly by accident. Carlson also told Dayan that he now wanted to tell\nthe police the truth.\n              On November 9 Dayan contacted Detective Arend and told him that\nCarlson now admitted that he had been alone in the car with Featherly, and that he\naccidentally shot Featherly. Dayan told Arend that Carlson wanted to participate in\nanother police interview, where he would confess to accidentally killing Featherly.\n              That same day, Dayan accompanied Carlson and his family to the police\nstation \u2014 but, upon their arrival, Dayan requested that the interview be delayed for one\nmore day. According to Arend\u2019s later trial testimony (which was not objected to by\nDayan), Dayan told Arend that he \u201cwanted to make sure that he had all of his T\u2019s crossed\n[and] I\u2019s dotted,\u201d and also to make sure that \u201cwhat [Carlson] was telling him was the\ntruth.\u201d Dayan told Arend that he (Dayan) was \u201cpretty confident ... that what [Carlson]\nhad told him was the truth, but he just wanted to make sure of it.\u201d\n              The next day, November 10, Dayan and Carlson returned to the police\nstation for the interview. Arend conducted this interview, which was videotaped and\naudiotaped.\n              At the beginning of the interview, Detective Arend advised Carlson of his\nMiranda rights. Carlson waived his Miranda rights and confirmed that he was\nparticipating in the interview voluntarily, after consulting with his attorney (Dayan), who\nwas present throughout the interview.\n              Carlson then proceeded to offer a new \u201caccidental shooting\u201d account of\nwhat happened. According to Carlson\u2019s new version of events, Carlson and Featherly\nwere alone in Featherly\u2019s car when the shooting occurred. Carlson was sitting in the\nback seat and Featherly was driving on an unpaved section of King Street that was filled\nwith potholes. Featherly had recently bought a gun, and Carlson was inspecting this gun,\nwhich he did not realize was loaded. Carlson told Arend that he was \u201cscrewing around\u201d\n\n                                           \u20138\u2013                                       2641\n\fwith the gun and pointing the gun at Featherly when the gun suddenly went off, killing\nFeatherly. Carlson also admitted that his finger was on the trigger when the gun\ndischarged.5\n               Carlson told Arend that he panicked after the shooting. He admitted to\nArend that he wiped down the car for fingerprints, and he also admitted (contrary to his\nprior statements) that he covered Featherly\u2019s body with a jacket so that it could not be\neasily seen. Carlson then fled with Featherly\u2019s two guns, throwing the gun that killed\nFeatherly into a nearby creek and hiding the Makarov pistol in his home. The police\nlater looked for a gun in the creek, but they could not find one.\n               Both the audio recording and the video recording of this November 10\nconfession show that Dayan was an active participant in the confession. At various\npoints during the interview, Dayan encouraged Carlson to provide more details about this\nnew version of events. Dayan also vouched for Carlson\u2019s claim that it was Carlson\u2019s\nhabit to sit in the back seat even when no one was in the front passenger seat. In the\ninterview, Dayan stated that he \u201c[thought] the evidence will bear it out\u201d that this was\n\u201cjust [Carlson\u2019s] habit and style; he likes to ride in the back seat.\u201d\n               Dayan was also an enthusiastic participant in the reenactment suggested by\nDetective Arend. Dayan agreed to play the role of Featherly in the reenactment. On the\nvideotape portions of the interview shown to the jury at Carlson\u2019s second trial, Dayan\ncan be seen scooting his chair around so that it is positioned in front of Carlson\u2019s chair,\nas though Dayan was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat and Carlson was in the back seat. Dayan\ncan also be seen handing Carlson his cell phone and urging him to use the phone as a\n\n\n   5\n       Carlson made a similar admission in an interview with a police polygrapher that was\nconducted after the recorded interview with Arend. According to the State\u2019s briefing on\nappeal, the results of the polygraph were \u201cinconclusive.\u201d The fact that Carlson had submitted\nto a police polygraph was not told to the jury at either trial.\n\n                                            \u20139\u2013                                        2641\n\fprop for the gun that killed Featherly. In the video, Carlson handles the \u201cgun,\u201d but he\ndoes not place it directly against Dayan\u2019s head.\n              Following the videotaped confession, Carlson was allowed to leave the\npolice station. But the next day Carlson was arrested and charged with first-degree\nmurder, second-degree murder, and multiple counts of evidence tampering and weapons\nmisconduct.\n              The grand jury later indicted Carlson on the following charges: one count\nof first-degree murder (for intentionally shooting Featherly); an alternative count of\nsecond-degree murder (for knowingly shooting Featherly under circumstances\nmanifesting extreme indifference to human life); one count of evidence tampering for\nmaking the fake alibi phone call to Featherly\u2019s pager; a second count of evidence\ntampering for wiping off the fingerprints from the car; a third count of evidence\ntampering for laying Featherly\u2019s body on the seat and covering it with the jacket; a fourth\ncount of evidence tampering for disposing of the murder weapon; a fifth count of\nevidence tampering for creating the fake death threat; one count of third-degree weapons\nmisconduct for possessing the murder weapon (a concealable firearm) after having been\nadjudicated a delinquent minor for a crime that would have been a felony if Carlson had\nbeen an adult; and a second count of third-degree weapons misconduct for possessing\nFeatherly\u2019s Makarov pistol after having been adjudicated a delinquent minor for a crime\nthat would have been a felony if Carlson had been an adult.6\n\n\n\n\n   6\n        AS 11.41.100(a)(1)(A); AS 11.41.110(a)(2); AS 11.56.610(a)(1), (2) and/or (4); and\nAS 11.61.200(a)(1), respectively. Carlson had previously been adjudicated a delinquent\nminor for committing burglary (conduct that would have been a felony if he had been an\nadult).\n\n                                          \u2013 10 \u2013                                     2641\n\f              Carlson\u2019s recantation of the \u201caccidental discharge\u201d version\n              of events\n              Approximately one month after his arrest (i.e., sometime in December\n1998), Carlson called Featherly\u2019s father from jail. In his conversation with Featherly\u2019s\nfather (which was recorded by corrections personnel), Carlson said that it was not true\nthat he had shot Featherly, and he declared that he had given a false confession to the\npolice. Carlson also falsely claimed that he had been receiving death threats. (Carlson\nlater admitted at trial that his statement to Featherly\u2019s father about \u201cdeath threats\u201d was\na reference to the fake death threat that he himself had created.)\n              Around this same time, Carlson called Dayan and told him that the\naccidental shooting story was not true \u2014 that, instead, the truth was his earlier assertion\nthat B shot Featherly. Dayan testified at the post-conviction relief evidentiary hearing\nthat Carlson had previously been very close to Featherly\u2019s family, and that Carlson was\nupset that Featherly\u2019s family blamed him for their son\u2019s death. The testimony at trial was\nthat the two were \u201clike brothers,\u201d frequently staying over at each other\u2019s houses.\n              Carlson told Dayan that, if his case went to trial, he intended to take the\nstand and testify that his videotaped confession was false and that B killed Featherly.\nHowever, with Carlson\u2019s permission, Dayan continued to try to negotiate a plea\nagreement with the State.\n              The plea negotiations ultimately broke down sometime in early February\n1999, at which point it became clear that the case was headed to trial and that Carlson\nwould take the stand and testify that B shot Featherly \u2014 thereby repudiating the\nvideotaped confession that Dayan had arranged for and actively participated in.\n              Dayan did not move to withdraw as Carlson\u2019s counsel or take any steps to\naddress the fact that the jury would likely become aware that the attorney who was\nrepresenting Carlson at trial had previously promoted Carlson\u2019s accidental discharge\n\n                                          \u2013 11 \u2013                                     2641\n\fversion of events as the truth. According to Dayan\u2019s testimony at the post-conviction\nrelief evidentiary hearing, it never occurred to him to withdraw, nor did he see any\nreason to believe that Carlson would be better served by having a different attorney\nrepresent him at trial. Dayan also defended his performance as Carlson\u2019s trial attorney,\nand argued that the criticisms now being leveled against him were unfair.\n\n\n              Carlson\u2019s first trial\n              At Carlson\u2019s first trial, the prosecution\u2019s primary theory was that Carlson\nintentionally shot Featherly over a dispute involving money and/or a girl. In support of\nthis theory, the prosecutor introduced evidence that Featherly owed Carlson $30 and that\nFeatherly was dating (or possibly engaged to) a girl that Carlson used to date more than\na year earlier.\n              During his opening statement, the prosecutor played portions of the\nvideotape of the November 10 interview in which Carlson confessed to accidentally\nshooting Featherly. And in the State\u2019s case-in-chief, the prosecutor introduced the\ncomplete audio recording of this interview into evidence, but the prosecutor failed to\nintroduce the corresponding videotape of the interview into evidence. This oversight\nwas discovered when, during jury deliberations, the jurors asked to re-watch the portions\nof the videotape that they had been shown during the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement.\nThe trial judge told the jurors that, while the audio recording was available, the videotape\nhad not been introduced into evidence and was therefore unavailable for their review.\n              Carlson took the stand at his first trial and, as he had previously informed\nDayan he would do, Carlson testified that B shot Featherly. Carlson admitted, however,\nthat it was not true that he shot B in return. Carlson told the jury that he had lied about\nshooting and struggling with B because he felt that it was \u201ccowardly\u201d for him not to have\n\n\n\n                                           \u2013 12 \u2013                                     2641\n\fdone so, and he felt \u201cguilty\u201d that he had done nothing to the man who killed his best\nfriend.\n             Carlson also admitted that he had repeatedly lied about what happened,\nstarting with his initial interview with the police where he claimed that he had not been\npresent when Featherly was killed. Carlson testified that he later falsely confessed to\naccidentally shooting Featherly because he felt overwhelmed by the police investigation\nand he \u201cjust wanted everybody off my back.\u201d Carlson also stated that he thought that he\nwould not get into any trouble if he claimed to have accidentally shot Featherly.\n             Carlson admitted that he engaged in most of the conduct that formed the\nbasis for the evidence tampering and weapons misconduct charges. That is, Carlson\nadmitted to making the fake alibi call to Featherly\u2019s pager, wiping down the car for\nfingerprints, covering Featherly\u2019s body with a coat, possessing the Makarov pistol, and\nmaking the fake death threat note that his mother found outside his window. However,\nCarlson denied that he ever possessed the gun that was used to kill Featherly, and he\ndenied throwing that gun into the creek \u2014 conduct that was the basis for one of the\nweapons misconduct charges and one of the evidence tampering charges.\n             During his cross-examination of Carlson, the prosecutor focused primarily\non the number of different lies that Carlson had told, and the prosecutor had Carlson\nadmit that many of his prior statements were lies. Dayan subsequently argued in closing\nargument that, while the State had proved that Carlson was a liar, the State had not\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt that Carlson was a murderer.\n             After deliberating for several days and requesting multiple playbacks of the\ntestimony (including the request to view the videotape of the November 10 confession\nthat was denied because the videotape was not in evidence), the jury announced its\nverdicts. The jury acquitted Carlson of first-degree murder, rejecting the prosecutor\u2019s\ntheory that Carlson had intentionally killed his best friend while his friend was driving\n\n                                         \u2013 13 \u2013                                     2641\n\fthe car Carlson was riding in. However, the jury could not reach a unanimous verdict\non the second-degree murder charge, and a mistrial was declared on that charge.7\n                The jury convicted Carlson of the four evidence tampering charges that he\nhad admitted during his trial testimony, as well as the weapons misconduct charge related\nto the Makarov pistol, which Carlson had also admitted.8 But the jury was unable to\nreach a verdict on the evidence tampering and weapons misconduct charges that Carlson\nhad denied \u2014 charges that would have required the jury to find that Carlson personally\nhandled the gun that killed Featherly.\n                According to Dayan\u2019s testimony at the post-conviction relief evidentiary\nhearing, both he and Carlson\u2019s family were \u201csurprised\u201d and \u201celated\u201d by the jury\u2019s\nverdicts at Carlson\u2019s first trial. Dayan testified that it was clear from the jury\u2019s behavior\nduring closing argument that his defense strategy of arguing that Carlson was a liar but\nnot a murderer had resonated with the jurors.\n\n\n                Carlson\u2019s second trial\n                At the second trial, Carlson gave substantially the same testimony, although\nhe provided some additional detail about why he told the police that he accidentally shot\nFeatherly. According to Carlson, he falsely confessed to accidentally shooting Featherly\nbecause nobody would believe the truth \u2014 i.e., that B shot Featherly. Carlson testified\nthat Dayan told him that nobody would believe that B shot Featherly because Carlson\nhad already \u201clied so much.\u201d Carlson also testified that Detective Arend\u2019s statement\nabout an accidental shooting being a \u201cwhole new ballgame\u201d led him to believe that he\n\n    7\n      The jury was not instructed on any lesser included charges at the first trial. At the\nsecond trial, the jury was instructed on the lesser included charge of manslaughter.\n    8\n          Carlson does not challenge these convictions in his application for post-conviction\nrelief.\n\n                                             \u2013 14 \u2013                                    2641\n\fwould not get into much trouble, if any, if he falsely told the police that the shooting was\nan accident.\n               The main difference between the two trials, however, was the shift in the\nprosecution\u2019s theory of the case. With first-degree murder no longer an option, the\nprosecutor argued that Carlson had told a basically truthful version of events during the\nNovember 10 confession \u2014 and that Carlson\u2019s accidental shooting of Featherly\nconstituted second-degree murder because it manifested extreme indifference to the value\nof human life. The prosecutor told the jury, \u201cJason Carlson did the stupidest thing he\u2019s\never done in his life [when he held] a gun he didn\u2019t know ... was loaded to the back of\nGeorge Featherly\u2019s head. The gun went off, and he\u2019s been lying about it ever since.\u201d9\n               At various points during the second trial, the prosecutor referred to Dayan\u2019s\npresence at the November 10 police interview. In closing argument, the prosecutor told\nthe jury:\n               [Y]ou\u2019ve got the interview on the [10th] of November. It\u2019s\n               on the videotape. This is in the presence of Mr. Dayan. With\n               his own attorney there. After presumably he\u2019s had all the\n               options laid out ... . Look, any promises, any threats? No.\n               In his closing argument to the defense, Dayan continued to argue that the\nState had proved Carlson was a liar but had failed to prove that he was a murderer.\nDayan\u2019s closing argument also focused on various discrepancies in Heather Dickens\u2019s\ntestimony, including the fact that she did not have a full view of the back seat.\nAccording to Dayan, what Dickens actually saw was Carlson after he moved out of the\nfront seat so that he could grab the steering wheel after B shot Featherly.\n               Lastly, Dayan addressed the reasons why Carlson would falsely confess to\naccidentally shooting Featherly. Dayan emphasized Carlson\u2019s youth, and susceptibility\n\n\n   9\n       See AS 11.41.110(a)(2).\n\n                                           \u2013 15 \u2013                                     2641\n\fto pressure, arguing that Carlson was overwhelmed by the police investigation. Dayan\nalso emphasized that Carlson was easily influenced by the adults around him \u2014\nincluding both Detective Arend and Dayan himself.\n              Following its deliberations, the second jury convicted Carlson of second-\ndegree murder and the two remaining evidence tampering and weapons misconduct\ncharges.\n\n\n              Carlson\u2019s sentencing\n              The trial judge sentenced Carlson to 50 years\u2019 imprisonment with 10 years\nsuspended for the second-degree murder conviction. Carlson\u2019s composite sentence for\nthe murder and the evidence tampering and weapons misconduct charges was 64 years\u2019\nimprisonment with 17 years suspended (47 years to serve).\n              During the sentencing hearing, the trial judge expressly found that Carlson\nhad perjured himself at his two trials. The judge declared that Carlson\u2019s story about a\nblack man named B shooting Featherly was \u201cpatently false\u201d:\n              I listened to it twice. I don\u2019t believe a word of it. There\n              wasn\u2019t a B present. B didn\u2019t shoot anybody, and Mr. Carlson\n              did not shoot B. He testified [that] all those things occurred,\n              but they didn\u2019t, and he did commit perjury in telling that\n              story.\n\n\n              Carlson\u2019s direct appeal and subsequent federal litigation\n              Carlson appealed his murder conviction and his sentence. This Court\naffirmed Carlson\u2019s conviction and sentence on January 27, 2006.10 The Alaska Supreme\nCourt denied Carlson\u2019s petition for hearing on May 24, 2006.\n\n\n   10\n        Carlson v. State, 128 P.3d 197 (Alaska App. 2006).\n\n                                          \u2013 16 \u2013                                   2641\n\f              Around the time that the Alaska Supreme Court denied Carlson\u2019s petition\nfor hearing, a private criminal defense attorney from North Carolina contacted the\nassistant public defender who represented Carlson in his direct appeal. The North\nCarolina attorney had seen this Court\u2019s decision on a national blog, and he volunteered\nto represent Carlson in a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court\nraising a Blakely sentencing issue.11\n              Carlson\u2019s public defender assisted the North Carolina attorney in contacting\nCarlson and having the North Carolina attorney take over the representation. But neither\nthe public defender nor the North Carolina attorney advised Carlson that he had only one\nyear to seek post-conviction relief in state court if he wanted to raise claims of ineffective\nassistance of counsel against Dayan or against his appellate attorney.12 In addition, no\none advised Carlson that the federal litigation with the North Carolina attorney would\nnot toll this deadline.\n              The United States Supreme Court denied Carlson\u2019s petition for writ of\ncertiorari in October 2006. The North Carolina attorney then assisted Carlson in filing\na petition for writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court, attempting to raise\nineffective assistance of counsel claims that could only be raised if Carlson had first\nexhausted his post-conviction relief remedies in state court.13 A federal assistant public\ndefender was appointed to represent Carlson in his federal habeas petition. That attorney\nrequested that the federal district court stay the proceedings until Carlson had the\nopportunity to exhaust his state post-conviction relief remedies. The federal district court\ngranted this request.\n\n\n   11\n        See Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004).\n   12\n        See AS 12.72.020(a)(3)(A).\n   13\n        See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A).\n\n                                           \u2013 17 \u2013                                       2641\n\f               Carlson\u2019s application for post-conviction relief\n               On December 10, 2007 \u2014 six and one-half months after the statutory\ndeadline for seeking post-conviction relief \u2014 Carlson filed a pro se post-conviction relief\napplication in the superior court, raising various claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel against Dayan. The superior court appointed counsel to represent Carlson and\nto address the late filing of the application. Carlson\u2019s post-conviction relief attorney filed\na motion to accept the late-filed application, arguing that the delay had been caused by\nineffective assistance of Carlson\u2019s state and federal appellate counsel.14 Superior Court\nJudge Jack Smith granted this motion over the State\u2019s objection. (This ruling is\nchallenged on appeal and discussed later in our opinion.) The case then proceeded to a\nlitigation of the merits of Carlson\u2019s underlying post-conviction relief claims.\n               In his amended application for post-conviction relief, Carlson raised three\nprimary claims of ineffective assistance of counsel against Dayan.15\n\n\n\n\n   14\n       See Alex v. State, 210 P.3d 1225, 1228 (Alaska App. 2009) (suggesting that the statute\nof limitations could be equitably tolled in cases where the applicant mistakenly attempted to\npursue his claim in another forum due to ineffective assistance of counsel); see also Holland\nv. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 652 (2010) (recognizing that the statute of limitations for federal\nhabeas corpus claims may be equitably extended to remedy the egregious performance of\nappointed counsel that contributed to the missed deadline).\n   15\n       Carlson also raised ineffective assistance of counsel claims against his state appellate\nattorney, assistant public defender Paul Malin. Carlson alleged specifically that Malin was\nineffective for failing to challenge the trial judge\u2019s denial of Carlson\u2019s post-trial pro se\nmotion requesting that Dayan withdraw and the Alaska Public Defender Agency be\nappointed for sentencing. Cf. Peterson v. State, 1985 WL 1077992, at *2 (Alaska App. Mar.\n6, 1985) (unpublished) (\u201c[A] party retaining counsel may fire his attorney and retain new\ncounsel at will, so long as substitution of counsel does not substantially prejudice the state.\u201d).\nOn appeal, Carlson concedes that he abandoned this claim during the post-conviction relief\nproceedings.\n\n                                             \u2013 18 \u2013                                         2641\n\f              In his first claim, Carlson alleged that Dayan was ineffective for advising\nCarlson to participate in the videotaped November 10 interview with the police without\nany guarantees of confidentiality or promises of leniency in place. This claim was\ndismissed by Judge Smith on the ground that the November 10 interview occurred before\nformal charges were filed, and the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel does not attach until criminal charges have been filed.16 Carlson has not cross-\nappealed the dismissal of this claim, and it is therefore not before us in this appeal.\n              In his second claim, Carlson alleged that Dayan was ineffective for failing\nto withdraw from his case once it became clear that Carlson intended to testify at trial\nthat B shot Featherly, and that Carlson intended to repudiate the accidental shooting\nconfession that Dayan had participated in and previously promoted as the truth. Carlson\nargued that any competent attorney under these circumstances would have withdrawn\nfrom his case or, at the very least, would have moved for a protective order to prevent\n\n\n\n   16\n        See, e.g., Philmore v. McNeil, 575 F.3d 1251, 1258-59 (11th Cir. 2009) (holding that\nSixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached at the time defendant made his statements\nto the police because there had been no formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, or\narraignment); United States v. Edelmann, 458 F.3d 791, 804 (8th Cir. 2006) (same); Sweeney\nv. Carter, 361 F.3d 327, 333-34 (7th Cir. 2004) (same); People v. Claudio, 629 N.E.2d 384,\n385 (N.Y. 1993) (holding that, \u201cexcept in most unusual circumstances,\u201d the state is not\ncharged with responsibility of guaranteeing effective legal representation upon entry of\ncounsel at preaccusatory, investigatory stage of a criminal matter, i.e., before commencement\nof formal adversarial judicial criminal proceedings). But see McNeil, 575 F.3d at 1265-75\n(Tjoflat, J., concurring) (explaining that defendant had no Sixth Amendment claim based on\ndefense attorney\u2019s incompetent advice prior to initial charges being filed but defendant might\nhave had due process claim under the Fifth Amendment); United States v. Wilson, 719 F.\nSupp. 2d 1260, 1267 (D. Or. 2010) (concluding that defendant\u2019s precharge plea negotiations\nwere a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the criminal process for purposes of Sixth Amendment because\nprosecution had already committed to prosecution and parties\u2019 adverse positions had already\nsolidified).\n\n                                           \u2013 19 \u2013                                       2641\n\fthe jury from learning about the attorney\u2019s involvement in the earlier, now-repudiated\nconfession.\n              Lastly, Carlson alleged that Dayan\u2019s involvement in the November 10\ninterview constituted an \u201cactual conflict of interest\u201d that adversely affected Dayan\u2019s\nperformance at trial and which required the court to presume prejudice and reverse\nCarlson\u2019s convictions.\n              Carlson\u2019s case proceeded to a three-day evidentiary hearing on the latter\ntwo claims, which was held in front of Superior Court Judge Frank A. Pfiffner.\n              At this evidentiary hearing, Carlson presented an expert witness, long-time\ncriminal defense attorney, John Murtagh. Murtagh testified that, in his opinion, Dayan\nacted incompetently in failing to either withdraw or move for a protective order.\nMurtagh acknowledged, however, that trying to redact all indications of Dayan\u2019s\npresence from the November 10 videotape would be \u201can elaborate project\u201d \u2014 a project\nthat Murtagh did not think \u201cwould work well\u201d or provide \u201ca complete solution.\u201d\nMurtagh therefore testified that he felt \u201cvery strongly\u201d that Dayan should have\nwithdrawn as Carlson\u2019s trial counsel. According to Murtagh, if Carlson had had a\ndifferent trial attorney \u2014 one who \u201cchalleng[ed] the entire procedure of the [November\n10] interview\u201d and \u201cdevelop[ed] in some exquisite detail Mr. Carlson\u2019s psychological\nmental state,\u201d this would have made it a \u201ccompletely different trial.\u201d Murtagh\nacknowledged, however, that Carlson\u2019s multiple lies and shifting narratives would have\nmade this a difficult case for any attorney.\n              For his part, Dayan actively defended his decision to continue representing\nCarlson at his two trials. According to Dayan, it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to claim that Carlson\nhad been coerced into falsely confessing to accidentally shooting Featherly, either by\nDayan or anyone else. In Dayan\u2019s view, Carlson\u2019s demeanor during the videotaped\n\n\n\n                                          \u2013 20 \u2013                                   2641\n\fconfession belied such a claim: \u201cYou can tell he\u2019s not being pressured to lie there. It\nsounds like he\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d\n              Dayan testified that, after watching the videotaped interview again, he was\nreminded of the reasons why, at the time, he believed that the accidental discharge story\nwas the truth. He further indicated that, sitting there at the evidentiary hearing, he still\nbelieved that the accidental discharge story probably was the truth. Dayan also\nexpressed optimism about the result he could have obtained for Carlson if Carlson had\nnot reverted to the B story.\n              Dayan disagreed with Murtagh\u2019s criticisms of his performance. Dayan\ntestified that he had zealously and competently represented Carlson and he did not\nbelieve that Carlson was prejudiced by his representation at the two trials. Dayan also\nsuggested that he shared Murtagh\u2019s view that any attorney would have had difficulty\nrepresenting Carlson, given Carlson\u2019s many lies and shifting stories, which (according\nto Dayan) continued to shift in small ways up until the first trial.\n              Following this evidentiary hearing, the superior court issued a twenty-eight\npage written order. In this order, the court granted post-conviction relief to Carlson and\nvacated his convictions for second-degree murder, weapons misconduct, and evidence\ntampering from the second trial.\n              First, the superior court concluded that Dayan\u2019s active participation in the\nNovember 10 videotaped interview created an \u201cactual conflict of interest\u201d that gave rise\nto a \u201cnon-rebuttable\u201d presumption of prejudice that required the court to reverse\nCarlson\u2019s convictions. Specifically, the court found that, because of Dayan\u2019s involve\u00ad\nment in this interview, he became an \u201cactual witness\u201d in Carlson\u2019s case for purposes of\nAlaska Rule of Professional Conduct 3.7(a), and that Dayan\u2019s actions and statements\nduring the videotaped interview were tantamount to \u201ctestifying\u201d against his client in\nviolation of that rule.\n\n                                          \u2013 21 \u2013                                      2641\n\f              Second, the court concluded that Dayan rendered ineffective assistance of\ncounsel when he failed to either withdraw from the case or at least to seek a protective\norder that would prevent the jury from learning of his involvement in the November 10\nvideotaped confession. The court found specifically that, had Dayan moved for a\nprotective order, the motion would have been granted, and that this was \u201cthe minimum\nrequired for Carlson to have received a fair trial.\u201d The court also concluded that Dayan\nacted incompetently by failing to recognize that his presence at trial undermined\nCarlson\u2019s credibility and the credibility of the B defense. The court faulted Dayan for\nfailing to take adequate steps to try to discredit the November 10 confession as a false\nand coerced confession, and the court concluded that a different attorney \u2014 one who was\nnot directly involved in the now-repudiated confession \u2014 would have been better\nsituated to make such an attack.\n              Although the court\u2019s order is twenty-eight pages long, the court spent only\na page and a half on the prejudice prong of Carlson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim.17 The court\u2019s analysis of the question of prejudice ultimately turned on its finding\nthat a protective order would have been granted if one had been requested, and its finding\nthat the jury at Carlson\u2019s first trial \u201cdid not see or hear\u201d the November 10 interview,\nwhile the jury at the second trial saw the videotape of that interview and thus essentially\n\u201csaw Dayan refute his [own] theory of the case.\u201d Based on these findings about the\ndifferences between the two trials, the court concluded that \u201cthere is a possibility that\nDayan\u2019s support for the accident version and repudiation of the Bee version ... was an\ninfluential factor in the jurors\u2019 decision to convict.\u201d\n\n\n\n   17\n       To prove an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under the federal and state\nconstitutions, a defendant must prove both incompetence and prejudice. See Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 693 (1984); Risher v. State, 523 P.2d 421, 425 (Alaska 1974).\n\n                                           \u2013 22 \u2013                                    2641\n\f              In addition to these rulings on Carlson\u2019s two main post-conviction relief\nclaims, the superior court also made two other rulings that are challenged on appeal.\nFirst, the court rejected the State\u2019s argument that Carlson was barred as a matter of law\nfrom raising any claims of ineffective assistance of counsel against Dayan based on our\nprior decision in Arnett v. State.18 Second, the court found that Carlson\u2019s state appellate\nattorney was ineffective for failing to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim\nagainst Dayan in Carlson\u2019s direct appeal. (As already noted, Carlson concedes that this\nlast ruling was error.)\n\n\n        The State\u2019s arguments on appeal\n              The State raises multiple claims of error on appeal. Specifically, the State\nargues: (1) the superior court erred when it granted Carlson\u2019s motion to proceed on the\nmerits despite the late filing of the application; (2) the superior court erred when it\nrejected the State\u2019s argument that, under this Court\u2019s decision in Arnett v. State, Carlson\nwas barred from raising any ineffective assistance of counsel claims against Dayan;\n(3) the superior court\u2019s decision to grant post-conviction relief to Carlson was based on\nclearly erroneous findings regarding the difference between the two trials; (4) the\nsuperior court erred when it granted post-conviction relief to Carlson without finding\ncase-specific prejudice to Carlson arising from Dayan\u2019s purported conflict of interest;\nand (5) the superior court erred when it found that Dayan violated the advocate-witness\nrule.\n              We now address each of these claims.\n\n\n\n\n   18\n        Arnett v. State, 938 P.2d 1079 (Alaska App. 1997).\n\n                                          \u2013 23 \u2013                                     2641\n\f        A. The superior court\u2019s timeliness ruling\n              As already mentioned, Carlson\u2019s original pro se application for post-\nconviction relief was filed approximately six and one-half months after the statutory\ndeadline.19 Carlson\u2019s post-conviction attorney argued that this delay should be excused,\nalleging that Carlson received ineffective assistance of counsel from his appellate\nattorneys because neither of them warned Carlson of the post-conviction relief filing\ndeadline or that this deadline would not be tolled by the intervening federal litigation.20\n              To support his claim, Carlson provided affidavits from Paul Malin, the\nassistant public defender who represented Carlson in his direct appeal, and Bruce\nCunningham, the pro bono North Carolina attorney who represented Carlson in his\npetition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court and who assisted\nCarlson in filing his procedurally deficient petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal\ndistrict court.\n              In his affidavit, Malin asserted that he believed that he had provided\nineffective assistance of counsel to Carlson because \u201c[i]t would be reasonable for\n\n\n\n\n   19\n       Under AS 12.72.020, a defendant who unsuccessfully appeals his conviction has one\nyear from the date on which the appeal becomes final to file an application for post-\nconviction relief. See AS 12.72.020(a)(3)(A).\n   20\n       Although Carlson argues on appeal that he did not raise a claim of equitable tolling\nbased on the ineffective assistance of his appellate counsel, we conclude that Carlson\u2019s\nclaims necessarily encompassed the same fundamental due process principles as equitable\ntolling. See Alex v. State, 210 P.3d 1225, 1228 (Alaska App. 2009) (suggesting that the\nstatute of limitations could be equitably tolled in cases where the applicant mistakenly\nattempted to pursue his claim in another forum due to ineffective assistance of counsel); see\nalso Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649, 652 (2010) (holding that the statute of limitations\nfor federal habeas corpus claims may be equitably extended to remedy the egregious\nperformance of appointed counsel that contributed to the missed deadline).\n\n                                            \u2013 24 \u2013                                       2641\n\f[Carlson] to think that, as long as he was actively pursuing relief in the federal courts,\nhis state post-conviction relief options would not be harmed.\u201d\n              Unlike Malin, Cunningham did not directly state that he had provided\nineffective assistance of counsel. However, he admitted in his affidavit that he never\ndiscussed state post-conviction relief remedies with Carlson, and he also admitted that\nhe was \u201cnot aware of Alaska\u2019s statute of limitations regarding PCR applications\n[because] in North Carolina we do not have a statute of limitations for post-conviction\nrelief.\u201d\n              In response to these affidavits and the legal memorandum filed in support\nof Carlson\u2019s motion, the State filed a two-page opposition. In that opposition, the State\nargued that Carlson\u2019s application should be dismissed as time-barred. However, the\nState did not challenge any of the legal or factual assertions made in Carlson\u2019s pleadings.\nInstead, the State argued only that the pleadings showed that Carlson had been in\ncommunication with his attorneys and that he had made \u201ca choice ... in consultation with\nhis attorneys\u201d to forgo his state post-conviction relief remedies, \u201cpresumably because he\nthought his chances for success were stronger in the federal system.\u201d\n              Carlson then filed a pleading asserting that he made no such choice; he also\npointed out that it would be incompetent for an attorney to advise a defendant to skip\nlitigating his post-conviction relief claims in state court when the availability of federal\nhabeas review is directly contingent on a defendant having exhausted his state post-\nconviction relief remedies.21\n              Neither party requested an evidentiary hearing or oral argument on this\ntimeliness determination. Instead, the matter was submitted to Superior Court Judge Jack\nSmith based solely on the arguments and assertions made in the pleadings.\n\n\n   21\n        See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A).\n\n                                          \u2013 25 \u2013                                      2641\n\f              Judge Smith subsequently issued an oral ruling granting Carlson\u2019s motion\nto proceed. In his ruling, Judge Smith excused Cunningham\u2019s failure to inform Carlson\nof the state post-conviction deadline, apparently concluding that Cunningham could not\nbe expected to know the post-conviction relief procedures of a state in which he was not\nlicensed. However, Judge Smith concluded that, under the circumstances, Malin was\nineffective for failing to advise Carlson of the statutory deadline for seeking post-\nconviction relief. After Judge Smith issued this ruling, the parties proceeded to litigate\nthe merits of Carlson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims against Dayan.\n              The State challenges Judge Smith\u2019s ruling on appeal, but the State relies on\narguments that were never raised in the proceedings below. The State also violated the\nappellate rules by failing to have Judge Smith\u2019s oral ruling transcribed.22 An appellant\u2019s\nfailure to designate the portions of the record that are necessary for deciding a claim on\nappeal can constitute a waiver or abandonment of that claim.23\n              The timeliness of a post-conviction relief application is a threshold\ndetermination that must be made before the court undertakes litigation of the merits of\n\n\n\n\n   22\n       Alaska Appellate Rule 210(b)(1)(A) requires the appellant to designate for\ntranscription \u201call parts [of the record] which are essential to a determination of the issues on\nappeal.\u201d The rule further provides that \u201cif appellant claims that the written findings of fact\nor conclusions of law are insufficient or erroneous, the designation shall include any oral\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d Id.\n   23\n       See Bertilson v. State, 64 P.3d 180, 185 (Alaska App. 2003); see also Miscovich v.\nTryck, 875 P.2d 1293, 1304 (Alaska 1994) (\u201cIt is well established that a party\u2019s failure to\ndesignate portions of the record that are necessary to allow the determination of a point on\nappeal will amount to a waiver or abandonment of that point.\u201d); Jackson v. State, 31 P.3d\n105, 110 (Alaska App. 2001) (noting that a party\u2019s failure to designate a record to support\nthe party\u2019s claims justifies a reviewing court in deciding those claims against the party)\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n                                            \u2013 26 \u2013                                        2641\n\fthe defendant\u2019s post-conviction relief claims.24 Under Alaska Civil Rule 8(c), a statute\nof limitations defense must be pleaded as an affirmative defense.25 Failure to do so may\nconstitute a waiver of this defense.26 (Federal habeas corpus law is similar: a statute of\nlimitations defense is not jurisdictional and can be waived.27)\n              In Carlson\u2019s case, the prosecutor cursorily raised the timeliness issue and\nargued that Carlson\u2019s post-conviction relief application should be rejected as time-barred.\nBut the prosecutor otherwise accepted all of the factual assertions contained in Carlson\u2019s\nmotion, and she never challenged the legal framework that Carlson put forward to\nexplain the tardiness of the application. The prosecutor also failed to challenge or seek\nclarification of the aspects of the court\u2019s ruling that the State now challenges on appeal.\n              Given the cursory manner in which the statute of limitations issue was\nlitigated by the State in the superior court, and given the reasonable inferences to be\ndrawn from the uncontested facts alleged by Carlson in his pleadings, we conclude that\nthe superior court did not err when it granted Carlson\u2019s motion to accept his application\nas timely and to proceed to litigation of his claims on their merits.\n              In reaching this conclusion, we make two additional points.\n\n\n\n\n   24\n        See Holden v. State, 172 P.3d 815, 818 (Alaska App. 2007); Alex, 210 P.3d at 1229.\n   25\n       Alaska Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c) is applicable to post-conviction relief litigation.\nSee Alaska Criminal Rule 35.1(g). Under Civil Rule 8(c), a defendant must \u201cset forth\naffirmatively\u201d its affirmative defenses.\n   26\n        See Morrow v. New Moon Homes, Inc., 548 P.2d 279, 295 (Alaska 1976); cf. Barrett\nv. Byrnes, 556 P.2d 1254, 1254-55 (Alaska 1976) (failure to file responsive pleadings can\nresult in waiver of statute of limitations defense).\n   27\n        See Day v. McDonough, 547 U.S. 198, 208-10 (2006).\n\n                                           \u2013 27 \u2013                                       2641\n\f              First, we agree with the State that Alaska law is unsettled with regard to the\nquestion of whether an appellate attorney has a duty to inform a client of the statute of\nlimitations governing any potential future post-conviction relief application.\n              In Roe v. Flores-Ortega, the United States Supreme Court held that a\ndefendant\u2019s failure to meet a filing deadline for a direct appeal could be excused, based\non ineffective assistance of counsel, if the defendant can show (1) that the defendant\u2019s\nattorney unreasonably failed to consult with the defendant about the possibility of an\nappeal, and (2) that, but for the defense attorney\u2019s unreasonable failure to consult with\nthe defendant about an appeal, the defendant would have filed a timely appeal.28\n              In Harvey v. State,29 we adopted the Flores-Ortega test to define a trial\nattorney\u2019s duty to consult with a client regarding the client\u2019s appellate rights.30 But we\nhave not held that an attorney who represents a defendant on direct appeal has a duty to\nconsult with the defendant regarding potential post-conviction relief remedies.\n\n\n\n\n   28\n        Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 476-77 (2000).\n   29\n        Harvey v. State, 285 P.3d 295, 305 (Alaska App. 2012).\n   30\n        See Harvey, 285 P.3d at 305, where we held that a trial attorney acts incompetently\nwhen the attorney \u201cfails to engage in meaningful discussions with the defendant about the\npossibility of an appeal in either of two situations: (1) when the defendant has given the\nattorney a reasonable indication that they are interested in appealing, or (2) when there are\nobjective reasons to think that a rational person in the defendant\u2019s position might want to\nappeal.\u201d See also Wassilie v. State, 331 P.3d 1285, 1288 (Alaska App. 2014).\n        We have also found the Flores-Ortega test applicable in a situation where a trial\nattorney failed to file for judicial review of an administrative decision. See Frank v. State,\n2009 WL 349791, at *2 (Alaska App. Feb. 11, 2009) (unpublished); see also Basargin v.\nState, 2006 WL 3334018, at *1-2 (Alaska App. Nov. 15, 2006) (unpublished) (suggesting\nthat Flores-Ortega may be applicable in a situation where defendant hired an attorney to file\nan application for post-conviction relief).\n\n                                           \u2013 28 \u2013                                       2641\n\f               In Wassilie v. State, we extended this duty to attorneys who represent a\ndefendant in an application for post-conviction relief in the trial court, and who file a\ncertificate of no merit as to the defendant\u2019s claims.31 In Wassilie, we held that an\nattorney who files a certificate of no merit has an obligation \u201cto ascertain [the\ndefendant\u2019s] desires regarding a potential appeal, and to take the steps necessary to\npreserve [the] right of appeal if that is what [the applicant] wishes to do.\u201d32\n               On appeal, Carlson argues that this same duty should extend to attorneys\nwho represent defendants on direct appeal and who are aware, through their review of\nthe record on appeal and conversations with their clients, of potential ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims that the defendant cannot bring on direct appeal but may\nwish to pursue in an application for post-conviction relief. For its part, the State argues\nthat no such duty should apply because ineffective assistance of counsel claims are\nnormally wholly collateral to a defendant\u2019s direct appeal.33\n               We conclude that we need not reach the question of what duty, if any,\nappellate attorneys owe their clients with regard to ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaims or other post-conviction relief remedies. We reach this conclusion because we\ndo not read the superior court\u2019s ruling as broadly as the State does.\n               The State asserts that Judge Smith\u2019s ruling \u201crests on the assumption that\ncounsel on direct appeal has an affirmative duty to expressly inform an unsuccessful\n\n   31\n        Wassilie, 331 P.3d at 1288.\n   32\n        Id.; see also Alaska R. Prof. Conduct 1.2(a) & 1.16.\n   33\n        The State also argues that there is nothing in the record to suggest that Carlson ever\nasked Malin about raising ineffective assistance of counsel claims against Dayan. The State\nis correct that the record is silent on this issue, and that this issue was never litigated in the\nsuperior court. But Malin presumably would have been aware of Carlson\u2019s pro se motion\nalleging that Dayan was ineffective. This motion was filed prior to Carlson\u2019s sentencing, and\nit was therefore part of the record on appeal.\n\n                                             \u2013 29 \u2013                                         2641\n\fappellant of the deadline to file a post-conviction application.\u201d We do not read the\ncourt\u2019s ruling this way. Instead, we view the court\u2019s ruling as grounded in the specific\ncircumstances presented here \u2014 circumstances that involved a highly unusual turn of\nevents where a state appellate attorney essentially handed off his client to a pro bono out\u00ad\nof-state attorney who was unfamiliar with Alaska\u2019s post-conviction relief procedures\n(and apparently also unfamiliar with the \u201cexhaustion of state remedies\u201d requirement for\nfederal habeas relief). We also note that, unlike the cases cited by the State in its brief,\nCarlson remained represented by the same out-of-state attorney even after his direct\nappeal was over.34 Thus, unlike the defendants in the other cases, Carlson potentially had\ngood reason to believe that his post-conviction relief rights were being safeguarded by\nhis attorney during this representation.35\n              In sum, we view the superior court\u2019s ruling on the timeliness of Carlson\u2019s\npost-conviction relief application as limited to the unusual circumstances presented by\nCarlson\u2019s case. We also conclude that our review of that ruling should be limited to the\nissues actually raised and litigated in the superior court. Given the State\u2019s failure to\n\n\n\n   34\n        See Miranda v. Castro, 292 F.3d 1063, 1067-68 (9th Cir. 2002) (appellate attorney\nmisadvised client of deadline for habeas petition in letter ending her representation of him);\nSummers v. Patrick, 535 F. Supp. 2d 995, 999 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (defendant failed to comply\nwith statutory time limits due to \u201cnot having [an] attorney\u201d); Noyakuk v.

The superior court\u2019s Arnett ruling\n              In Arnett v. State, we held that a defendant who voluntarily commits a crime\non the advice of counsel cannot later claim that the attorney\u2019s advice amounted to\nineffective assistance of counsel \u2014 because, \u201cin almost all such cases, the defendant\u2019s\nown voluntary acts will be a superseding cause of any resulting misfortune.\u201d36\n              The State argues that our decision in Arnett bars Carlson from raising\nineffective assistance of counsel claims against Dayan as a matter of law. Specifically,\nthe State argues that Carlson should be estopped from claiming that Dayan provided\nineffective assistance of counsel because it was Carlson\u2019s own conduct \u2014 repeatedly\nlying to the police and potentially perjuring himself at trial \u2014 that gave rise to Dayan\u2019s\nalleged ineffective assistance of counsel.\n              We are not persuaded by this argument. The rule in Arnett is limited to\ncircumstances where an attorney and a defendant act in collusion.37 It would be counter\n\n   36\n        Arnett v. State, 938 P.2d 1079, 1083 (Alaska App. 1997). As we explained in Arnett:\n            We have no doubt that a lawyer who counsels a client to commit a\n            crime for tactical gain acts incompetently. But by the same token, this\n            form of advice falls so far beyond the pale of anything that could\n            conceivably be considered legitimate legal assistance that a defendant\u2019s\n            voluntary reliance on it is tantamount to a willing abandonment of\n            competent representation.\nId.; see also Harding v. Lewis, 834 F.2d 853, 858-59 (9th Cir. 1987) (rejecting ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim based on involuntary self-representation when defendant, in an\nattempt to inject reversible error into the trial through self-representation, conspired with\ncounsel to invent an excuse for discharging counsel in the midst of trial).\n   37\n        See, e.g., Prentzel v. State, 2009 WL 1361959, at *2-3 & n.3 (Alaska App. May 13,\n                                                                             (continued...)\n\n                                           \u2013 31 \u2013                                      2641\n\fto public policy to apply this rule to defendants who, on their own initiative, provide a\nversion of events at trial that contradicts what they earlier told the police. Such a rule\nwould effectively prevent defendants who claim they were pressured to falsely confess\nfrom challenging the effectiveness of their attorneys\u2019 litigation of this issue.\n              Here, Carlson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims against Dayan rest\nprimarily on Carlson\u2019s assertion that any competent attorney would have moved to\nwithdraw once Carlson made it clear that he intended to testify at trial and repudiate the\nNovember 10 confession that Dayan had helped facilitate and had previously promoted\nas the truth. Carlson does not claim that Dayan advised him to give a false confession\nto the police. Nor has Carlson claimed that Dayan advised him to perjure himself at trial.\n              Accordingly, we affirm the superior court\u2019s rejection of the State\u2019s Arnett\nargument, and we conclude that Carlson was not barred as a matter of law from raising\nhis claims of ineffective assistance of counsel against Dayan.\n\n\n        C. The superior court\u2019s conflict analysis\n              The superior court found that Carlson had proved, by clear and convincing\nevidence, that Dayan was laboring under an \u201cactual conflict of interest\u201d based on\nDayan\u2019s personal involvement in the later-repudiated November 10 confession. The\nsuperior court further found that this \u201cconflict of interest\u201d gave rise to a non-rebuttable\npresumption of prejudice \u2014 a presumption that required the court to reverse Carlson\u2019s\n\n\n   37\n       (...continued)\n2009) (unpublished) (defendant barred from claiming ineffectiveness under Arnett where\nattorney advised defendant not to file an appeal in hopes that the superior court would forget\nthat the defendant had been released on bail pending appeal); Nelson v.

We agree with the State that the superior court\u2019s conflict analysis is\nflawed, although we do not completely agree with the State\u2019s analysis of the relevant\nlaw. We therefore provide a brief history and overview of the applicable law in order\nto ground our explanation of the errors in the superior court\u2019s reasoning and ultimate\nfindings.\n\n\n              1. Brief overview of the law on post-conviction conflict of\n              interest claims\n              A defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth\nAmendment has two components: competent representation, and zealous, conflict-free\nrepresentation.38 Because the right to conflict-free counsel is a subset of the right to\neffective assistance of counsel, a defendant who seeks post-conviction relief based on a\nclaim that his attorney was laboring under a conflict of interest would typically need to\nprove both prongs of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim \u2014 including the\nprejudice prong.39\n\n\n   38\n        Wood v. Georgia, 450 U.S. 261, 271 (1981).\n   39\n        See Newby v. State, 967 P.2d 1008, 1011-12 (Alaska App. 1998) (describing a conflict\nclaim as a subset of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim); see also Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 692 (1984) (setting forth the two-prong test for ineffective\nassistance of counsel under the federal constitution); Risher v. State, 523 P.2d 421, 425\n(Alaska 1974) (setting forth the two-prong test for ineffective assistance of counsel under the\nAlaska constitution and requiring only a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d of a different outcome\nrather than the \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard required under federal law).\n\n                                            \u2013 33 \u2013                                       2641\n\f               In 1980, however, the United States Supreme Court held in Cuyler v.\nSullivan that a defendant who could prove that his attorney was laboring under \u201can actual\nconflict of interest [that] adversely affected his [attorney\u2019s] performance\u201d would not have\nthe additional burden of proving the traditional prejudice prong of an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim.40 That is, the defendant would be relieved of the additional\nburden of showing that there was a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial\nwould have been different.41\n               The presumed prejudice aspect of Cuyler applies only to the question of\nwhether the defendant\u2019s trial might have had a different ultimate outcome. The\ndefendant still bears the burden of showing that the attorney\u2019s conflict of interest\nprejudiced him in the sense that, because of the attorney\u2019s conflicting interest, the\nattorney took some action (or refrained from taking some action) that was contrary to the\ndefendant\u2019s interests.42 As the United States Supreme Court later explained in Strickland\nv. Washington, this presumption of prejudice as to the ultimate outcome was adopted\nbecause \u201cit is difficult to measure the precise effect on the defense of representation\ncorrupted by conflicting interests.\u201d43\n\n\n   40\n        Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 350 (1980).\n   41\n        Id.; see Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n   42\n       See generally 3 Wayne R.

Professor LaFave explains the Court\u2019s reasoning as\nfollows:\n          Once it is shown that counsel was adversely influenced by the conflict\n          in one aspect of his performance, it would be inappropriate to measure\n          the impact of that conflict solely by reference to that action or inaction.\n          A court could not assume that counsel so motivated had not also been\n                                                                                  (continued...)\n\n                                            \u2013 34 \u2013                                        2641\n\f              The Cuyler standard is therefore different from the rule of per se reversal\nthat applies to situations where a defendant is deprived of counsel altogether.44 Instead,\nunder Cuyler, prejudice is presumed only if the defendant demonstrates that (1) the\nattorney was placed in a situation where conflicting loyalties pointed in opposite\ndirections (an \u201cactual conflict\u201d), and that, because of the conflicting loyalties, (2) the\nattorney acted against the defendant\u2019s interests (i.e., the conflict of interests \u201cadversely\naffected his performance\u201d).45\n              In the years since Cuyler was decided, disagreement has arisen in the\nfederal courts regarding whether the Cuyler standard applies to all alleged conflicts of\ninterest or only to the types of conflicts that were primarily at issue in Cuyler \u2014 i.e.,\nconflicts of interest arising from the attorney\u2019s concurrent or joint representation of co-\ndefendants. As a result of this disagreement, some federal circuit courts have refused to\napply the Cuyler rule of presumed prejudice to conflict of interest claims that do not\n\n\n\n\n   43\n     (...continued)\n          influenced by the conflict in various other aspects of his representation.\n          It was at this point that an assessment of prejudice became too\n          speculative.\n3 Wayne R.

In cases involving \u201cegregious\u201d conflicts of interest such as the joint\nrepresentation of co-defendants presented in Cuyler, the Alaska courts apply a standard\nthat was formulated by the Alaska Supreme Court in its pre-Cuyler 1978 decision\nMoreau v. State.48\n              Under the Moreau standard, the trial court is required to affirmatively\nadvise co-defendants who are jointly represented by the same attorney of the dangers\n\n\n\n   46\n       See, e.g., Beets v. Scott, 65 F.3d 1258, 1268-73 (5th Cir. 1995) (en banc) (rejecting\nextension of Cuyler to breaches of loyalty pitted against an attorney\u2019s self-interest, and\ninstead analyzing such claims under the Strickland test).\n   47\n       See, e.g., Summerlin v. Stewart, 267 F.3d 926, 935-41 (9th Cir. 2001) (analyzing\nromantic \u201centanglement\u201d with the prosecutor under the Cuyler standard); Freund v.\nButterworth, 165 F.3d 839, 858-60 (11th Cir. 1999) (analyzing obligation to a former client\nunder Cuyler standard); Garcia v. Bunnell, 33 F.3d 1193, 1194-95, 1198, n.4 (9th Cir. 1994)\n(holding that under Cuyler defendant must demonstrate why his attorney\u2019s future\nemployment with the prosecution posed an actual conflict of interest); United States v.\nYoung, 644 F.2d 1008, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981) (applying Cuyler to successive representation\nof co-defendants); United States v.

Although the United States Supreme Court has not directly answered\nthe question of how broadly Cuyler was intended to apply, dicta in Mickens v. Taylor, a 2002\ndecision, suggests that the Cuyler standard may not have been intended to apply as broadly\nas some federal courts have assumed. See Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 175-76 (2002)\n(explaining in dicta that it was an open question under the Court\u2019s jurisprudence whether\nCuyler would apply beyond the concurrent representation context, or whether the prejudice\nrequirement from Strickland would be necessary, and noting that \u201cnot all attorney conflicts\npresent comparable difficulties\u201d).\n   48\n        Moreau v. State, 588 P.2d 275, 283-84 (Alaska 1978).\n\n                                            \u2013 36 \u2013                                       2641\n\finherent in such a joint representation.49 If the trial judge fails to conduct this inquiry,\nand a defendant subsequently raises a post-conviction claim based on the joint\nrepresentation, the burden then shifts to the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe joint representation had no adverse effect on the outcome of the defendant\u2019s trial.50\n              In all other conflict of interest claims, the Alaska courts apply the Cuyler\nstandard \u2014 oftentimes referred to as the LaPierre standard because of this Court\u2019s\ndecision in LaPierre v. State.51 The Alaska courts have applied this standard to a wide\nvariety of conflict of interest claims.52 A \u201cconflict in the abstract,\u201d or the mere possibility\nof a conflict of interest, is insufficient to meet this standard.53\n\n\n\n\n   49\n        Id.\n   50\n        Id.; State v.

We note that the superior court relies heavily on an earlier case, Wilson v. State, 711\nP.2d 547 (Alaska App. 1985). However, Wilson does not lay out the Cuyler standard as\nclearly as it could, referring in short hand to the requirement that the defendant show an\n\u201cactual conflict of interest that adversely affected the attorney\u2019s performance\u201d simply as a\nrequirement that the defendant show \u201can actual conflict of interest.\u201d Id. at 549.\n   52\n        See, e.g., White v.

Application of these principles to the present case\n              In order for Carlson to prevail in his claim for post-conviction relief based\non Dayan\u2019s alleged conflict of interest, Carlson was required to prove by clear and\nconvincing evidence that (1) Dayan had a loyalty to someone else or, alternatively, some\npersonal interest, that conflicted with Dayan\u2019s loyalty to Carlson, and (2) this loyalty to\nsomeone else (or to his own self-interest) actually affected Dayan\u2019s preparation or\npresentation of Carlson\u2019s case in a manner that was adverse to Carlson\u2019s interests.54\n              The superior court failed to use this standard when it assessed Carlson\u2019s\nconflict of interest claim. Instead, the superior court appeared to rely on a colloquial\nunderstanding of the term \u201cconflict.\u201d The court found that there was \u201cconflict\u201d between\nDayan\u2019s role as the participant in the videotaped confession and Dayan\u2019s role as\nCarlson\u2019s advocate at trial. But the superior court never explained how this purported\n\u201cconflict\u201d between Dayan\u2019s roles translated into actively conflicting loyalties in the sense\nintended by LaPierre and Cuyler.\n              Notably, there is nothing in the record currently before us to suggest that\nDayan was laboring under an actual conflict of interest in the sense of being motivated\nby loyalty to any person other than Carlson.55 Nor is there any basis for concluding that\nDayan was working against Carlson\u2019s interests to protect his own professional self\ninterest. For example, the record does not suggest that Dayan failed to withdraw because\nhe was concerned that another attorney would attack his professional competence at trial\nor argue that Dayan coerced Carlson into giving a false confession to the police. To the\n\n\n   54\n        See Newby, 967 P.2d at 1014.\n   55\n       We acknowledge that Carlson\u2019s amended application alleges various conflicts of\ninterest related to Dayan\u2019s interactions with the police and with a potential witness. But\nthese claims were not litigated at the evidentiary hearing, and Dayan was not asked to\nrespond to them at that hearing.\n\n                                          \u2013 38 \u2013                                      2641\n\fcontrary, Dayan\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing made clear that he did not believe\nhe had done anything wrong when he advised Carlson to participate in the videotaped\npolice interview on November 10. Dayan likewise testified that he believed it was\n\u201cnonsense\u201d to claim that he coerced Carlson into giving this confession. Dayan was also\nadamant that there were many defense attorneys who would agree that having Carlson\n\u201ccome clean\u201d to the police was a reasonable tactical decision, given the circumstances\nknown to Dayan at the time.\n              As we explain in the next section, it may well have been incompetent for\nDayan to fail to recognize the \u201cconflict\u201d or tension between (1) his earlier stance that the\naccidental shooting version of events was the truth and (2) his role as Carlson\u2019s trial\nadvocate arguing for the truth of the \u201cB\u201d version of events. But even if Dayan acted\nincompetently when he continued to represent Carlson under these circumstances, this\ndoes not mean that Dayan had a conflict of interest within the meaning of our case law.\n              Accordingly, we conclude that the superior court erred when it found that\nCarlson had proved that Dayan was laboring under \u201can actual conflict of interest\u201d that\ngave rise to a \u201cnon-rebuttable\u201d presumption of prejudice that required reversal of\nCarlson\u2019s convictions.\n\n\n       D. The superior court\u2019s finding that Dayan violated the advocate-witness\n       rule\n            The State also challenges the superior court\u2019s finding that Dayan violated\nAlaska Rule of Professional Conduct 3.7(a) by representing Carlson at trial. Alaska\nProfessional Conduct Rule 3.7(a) provides that a lawyer shall not act as an advocate at\na trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a \u201cnecessary witness\u201d unless the lawyer\u2019s\ntestimony relates to an uncontested issue, or is limited to \u201cthe nature and value of legal\n\n\n\n\n                                          \u2013 39 \u2013                                      2641\n\fservices rendered in the case,\u201d or unless the lawyer\u2019s disqualification \u201cwould work\nsubstantial hardship on the client.\u201d\n              As the commentary to Rule 3.7(a) states, \u201c[c]ombining the roles of advocate\nand witness can prejudice the tribunal and the opposing party and can also involve a\nconflict of interest between the lawyer and client.\u201d56 The conflict of interest typically\nidentified in these circumstances is the conflict that might exist between the attorney\u2019s\nobligation to testify truthfully and the attorney\u2019s duty of loyalty to the client, in cases\nwhere the client\u2019s position might be weakened by the attorney\u2019s truthful testimony.57\n\n\n              1. Was Dayan a \u201cnecessary\u201d witness for the defense?\n              Concerns about a potential violation of the advocate-witness rule typically\narise when the attorney has material personal knowledge of the underlying events being\nlitigated, and the attorney is therefore likely to be called as a witness at trial by one of the\nparties.58 If the anticipated testimony will be adverse to the attorney\u2019s client, the attorney\nis generally required to withdraw.59 If the anticipated testimony will be favorable to the\nclient, the attorney is not necessarily required to withdraw, although the attorney is\n\n\n\n\n   56\n        See Alaska Professional Conduct Rule 3.7(a), comment para. 1.\n   57\n        See id. at comment para. 6.\n   58\n        See United States v.

Rodriguez,\n115 Cal. App. 3d 1018, 1021-22 (Cal.

Patterson, for example, the Massachusetts Supreme\nJudicial Court held that a defense attorney who was a material witness to her client\u2019s\nunrecorded statements to the police acted incompetently when she failed to withdraw\nfrom the representation so that she would be available to testify on her client\u2019s behalf.61\n              Relying on Patterson, the superior court in Carlson\u2019s case appears to have\nconcluded that Dayan was similarly ineffective for failing to recognize his value to\nCarlson as a defense witness. The court stated in its order:\n              Had Dayan been a witness rather than an attorney, he could\n              have potentially aided the defense by testifying as to the\n              pressure on Carlson leading up to his confession, as well as\n              his and Detective Arend\u2019s statements that a confession would\n              be much easier for Carlson and would result in a lesser\n              punishment.\n              But there is very little in the evidentiary record to support the superior\ncourt\u2019s conclusion that Dayan would have been a helpful witness for Carlson. Instead,\nDayan\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing suggests that he would not have had\nparticularly favorable testimony to offer with regard to the circumstances that led Carlson\nto come forward with the accidental shooting version of events. Dayan testified that it\nwas \u201cnonsense\u201d to claim that he had coerced Carlson into telling this version of events\nto the police. And Dayan\u2019s testimony about the advice he gave to Carlson regarding the\n\n\n\n   60\n       See Commonwealth v. Patterson, 739 N.E.2d 682, 692 (Mass. 2000); Commonwealth\nv. Rondeau, 392 N.E.2d 1001,1004 (Mass. 1979) (concluding that once it \u201cbecame apparent\nto [defense counsel] that his testimony might be necessary to the proper defense of his client,\nhe was ethically obligated to withdraw as counsel\u201d).\n   61\n        See Patterson, 739 N.E.2d at 693-94.\n\n                                            \u2013 41 \u2013                                       2641\n\fconsequences of admitting to accidentally shooting Featherly would have directly\ncontradicted Carlson\u2019s trial testimony on this matter.62\n               Nor does it appear that Dayan would have given testimony to support\nCarlson\u2019s readoption of the \u201cB\u201d version of events after he was arrested. According to\nDayan, even Carlson\u2019s \u201cB\u201d version of events kept shifting, and it remained unclear to\nDayan what version of events Carlson was actually committed to until right before the\nfirst trial.\n               We therefore find little support in the current record for the superior court\u2019s\nconclusion that Dayan would have given favorable testimony for Carlson\u2019s defense had\nhe been available to testify at trial.\n\n\n               2. Was Dayan an \u201cactual witness\u201d?\n               In its order, the superior court found that Dayan\u2019s actions and statements\nin the confession of November 10 were \u201ctantamount to Dayan testifying against his client\nat his trial in clear violation of Alaska Rule of Professional Conduct 3.7.\u201d The superior\ncourt wrote:\n               Dayan\u2019s failure to withdraw as counsel, or alternatively to\n               seek a protective order excluding any reference to his\n               presence at the interview of his client, meant that the trial jury\n               knew that the lawyer seeking to establish the credibility of his\n               client\u2019s story at trial had already told the police that the\n               version of the story he was espousing at trial was untrue.\n               Dayan told the jury that his client did not shoot Featherly,\n\n\n    62\n       On cross-examination during his second trial, Carlson testified that \u201cnobody\u201d \u2014\nincluding Dayan \u2014 ever warned him that he could face criminal charges if he accidentally\nshot Featherly. The prosecutor later argued to the jury that Carlson\u2019s testimony on this point\nwas not believable \u2014 that it was inconceivable that Carlson\u2019s attorney would not have\nwarned him that he might face criminal charges for an accidental shooting.\n\n                                            \u2013 42 \u2013                                      2641\n\f              while the prosecution showed the jury a recording of Dayan\n              actively participating in Featherly\u2019s confession and stating\n              that he was confident that the confession was truthful.\n              On appeal, the State takes issue with the superior court\u2019s characterization\nof Dayan as an \u201cactual witness.\u201d We agree with the State that Dayan did not become an\n\u201cactual witness\u201d at Carlson\u2019s trials. Dayan did not take the stand and provide statements\nunder oath at either of Carlson\u2019s trials. However, we agree with the superior court that\nDayan\u2019s participation as Carlson\u2019s attorney created problems akin to the \u201cunsworn\nwitness\u201d problem recognized by this Court in Kanulie v. State.63\n              The problem of the attorney as \u201cunsworn witness\u201d can arise when either the\ndefense attorney or the prosecutor in a criminal case has participated in or witnessed the\nevents that will be explored at the trial.64 The concern in such situations is two-fold:\nFirst, the attorney may be \u201cconstrained from making certain arguments on behalf of his\nclient because of his own involvement, or may be tempted to minimize his own conduct\nat the expense of his client.\u201d65 Second, the attorney\u2019s role \u201cas advocate may give his\nclient an unfair advantage, because the attorney can subtly impart to the jury his\nfirst-hand knowledge of the events without having to swear an oath or be subject to\ncross-examination.\u201d66\n              Here, there may be an argument that, because of Dayan\u2019s personal\ninvolvement in the now-repudiated confession of November 10, he was constrained from\nattacking that confession as aggressively as another attorney might have. But as we have\n\n\n\n   63\n        Kanulie v. State, 796 P.2d 844 (Alaska App. 1990).\n   64\n        Losascio, 6 F.3d at 933-34.\n   65\n        Id.\n   66\n        Id.\n\n                                          \u2013 43 \u2013                                    2641\n\falready discussed, there is little in the record to suggest that Dayan actually felt such a\nconstraint. Moreover, as we discuss later in this opinion, the record shows that Dayan\ndid attack the November 10 confession as false, and Dayan provided multiple\nexplanations for why Carlson might have falsely confessed to accidentally shooting\nFeatherly.\n               The bigger problem appears to be the inconsistency between Dayan\u2019s prior\nstatements and actions related to the November 10 confession and his later actions and\nstatements at trial in support of the \u201cB\u201d defense. In other words, unlike the typical\nunsworn witness case, the concern here is not that Dayan\u2019s dual role might have given\nhis client an unfair advantage. Rather, the concern is that Dayan\u2019s dual role (as both\nCarlson\u2019s attorney and as a participant in the November 10 interview) would have\nworked to Carlson\u2019s disadvantage because Dayan\u2019s statements during (and leading up\nto) the November 10 interview were adverse to Carlson\u2019s trial testimony.67\n               We addressed the more traditional problem presented by an attorney acting\nas an \u201cunsworn witness\u201d in Kanulie v. State.68 In the middle of Kanulie\u2019s trial, Kanulie\nfiled a motion to preclude the State from introducing two police interviews because the\ntrial prosecutor had personally participated in both interviews.69 Kanulie argued that, if\nthe interviews were played, he would want to call the prosecutor as a witness to testify\nto Kanulie\u2019s demeanor at the time, and to explain what was said during certain portions\n\n\n\n   67\n         Cf. People v. Rodriguez, 115 Cal. App. 3d 1018, 1021, 171 Cal. Rptr. 798 (Cal. App.\n1981) (noting that when a defense attorney has been placed in a position adverse to his client,\nall his efforts on the defendant\u2019s behalf will be suspect: \u201cThe jury can hardly avoid inferring\nthe defendant\u2019s own attorney does not believe in the defense he himself is presenting.\u201d).\n   68\n        Kanulie v.

According to the State, Dayan played only a limited role in the\nNovember 10 interview, and his participation involved little more than asking neutral\n\u201cclarifying questions\u201d about parts of Carlson\u2019s accidental shooting story.\n\n\n\n   70\n        Id.\n   71\n        Id.\n   72\n        Id.\n   73\n        Id. at 848.\n   74\n        Kanulie, 796 P.2d at 846-48.\n\n                                           \u2013 45 \u2013                                    2641\n\f              We disagree with the State\u2019s characterization of this evidence. Although\nthe State is correct that Dayan never directly asserted in the videotaped interview that he\nbelieved the accidental shooting version of events and disbelieved Carlson\u2019s \u201cB\u201d version\nof events, Dayan\u2019s behavior throughout the interview is consistent with this attitude. In\nthe videotaped confession, Dayan can be seen actively encouraging Carlson to provide\nmore details about the accidental shooting version of events, and Dayan readily\nparticipated in Carlson\u2019s purported reenactment of the shooting; indeed, Dayan appeared\nto be more enthusiastic about the reenactment than Carlson himself. And Dayan even\nvouched for Carlson\u2019s credibility at one point during the interview.\n              Moreover, the State\u2019s brief fails to acknowledge that the jury did hear\nstatements from Dayan in which he indicated that he was \u201cpretty confident\u201d that the\naccidental discharge version of events was true. At Carlson\u2019s second trial, the prosecutor\nelicited these statements from Detective Arend (with no hearsay objection from Dayan).\n              We therefore agree with the superior court that Dayan\u2019s dual roles at\nCarlson\u2019s trials potentially created significant liabilities for the defense. We also agree\nwith the superior court that it was not reasonable for Dayan to believe that he would be\njust as able as any other lawyer to represent Carlson in advocating the truth of the \u201cB\u201d\nversion of events at trial, knowing that the jury would learn that he had actively\nfacilitated and promoted what Carlson now claimed to be a false confession.75\n\n   75\n       We note that the problem of Dayan as an \u201cunsworn witness\u201d was raised by the\nprosecutor in a pleading filed between the two trials. That pleading, which was filed on\nMarch 7, 2000, discussed the problem of Dayan as an \u201cunsworn witness\u201d if a former client\nof Dayan testified at trial, suggesting that the former client\u2019s testimony could require\ndisqualification of Dayan at the second trial. In the prosecutor\u2019s discussion of the potential\nunsworn witness problem that would be created by this witness\u2019s testimony, the prosecutor\nnoted that this was a problem that \u201calready existed in this case\u201d based on \u201cAttorney Dayan\u2019s\npresence at Carlson\u2019s November 1998 video-taped confession which Attorney Dayan\n                                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                           \u2013 46 \u2013                                       2641\n\f              That said, we disagree with the superior court\u2019s finding that Dayan\u2019s failure\nto recognize the potential liabilities of his dual roles constituted an \u201cactual conflict of\ninterest\u201d for purposes of the \u201cpresumed prejudice\u201d rule under Cuyler and LaPierre.\nInstead, based on the record currently before us, we conclude that these deficiencies in\nDayan\u2019s representation must be analyzed under the normal two-prong Risher test for\nineffective assistance of counsel \u2014 a test that requires the defendant to show that there\nis a reasonable possibility that the litigation would have ended with a different outcome.\n\n\n         E. The superior court\u2019s findings on Carlson\u2019s ineffective assistance of\n        counsel claim\n              Under Risher v. State, a defendant who claims ineffective assistance of\ncounsel must prove two things: first, that their attorney acted incompetently (i.e., that\nthe attorney failed to meet the standard of performance minimally required of criminal\nlaw practitioners); and second, that the attorney\u2019s incompetence prejudiced the defendant\nin the sense that there is at least a reasonable possibility that the result at the defendant\u2019s\ntrial would have been different but for the attorney\u2019s incompetence.76\n              In Carlson\u2019s case, the superior court found that Carlson had proved both\nprongs by clear and convincing evidence. On appeal, the State challenges this\nconclusion, arguing that it rests on clearly erroneous factual findings and incorrect legal\nassumptions. Although we disagree with certain aspects of the State\u2019s characterization\nof the record, we nevertheless agree with the State that there are sufficient questions\n\n\n   75\n       (...continued)\nsubsequently argued was false.\u201d Carlson subsequently decided to forgo the testimony of this\nformer client and no further discussion of the unsworn witness problem appears to have\noccurred.\n   76\n        Risher, 523 P.2d at 424-25.\n\n                                            \u2013 47 \u2013                                       2641\n\fabout the court\u2019s factual findings and legal reasoning to require a remand for further\nproceedings on the underlying ineffective assistance of counsel claim, particularly with\nregard to the prejudice prong of the Risher test.\n\n\n              1. The superior court\u2019s erroneous ruling regarding the\n              protective order\n              In the superior court, Carlson argued that Dayan acted below the standard\nof competence when he failed either to withdraw from the representation or to seek a\nprotective order that would have prevented the jury from learning that Dayan was the\nattorney who facilitated the November 10 videotaped confession. In its order, the\nsuperior court focused primarily on Dayan\u2019s failure to seek a protective order. The court\nfound that \u201c[such] a motion for protective order [would] have been granted,\u201d and that this\nmotion \u201cwas the minimum required for Carlson to have received a fair trial.\u201d\n              We disagree with the superior court\u2019s finding that a protective order would\nhave been granted in these circumstances. As Carlson\u2019s own expert witness, John\nMurtagh, acknowledged at the evidentiary hearing, Dayan\u2019s participation in the\nNovember 10 interview was an integral part of that interview, and it would be extremely\ndifficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to edit Dayan out of the videotape without substantively\naltering one of the prosecution\u2019s most important pieces of evidence against Carlson.\nSeeking a protective order might have brought additional attention to the problem that\nDayan\u2019s dual roles presented, and it might have resulted in either Dayan\u2019s withdrawal\nor some form of knowing waiver of the problem by Carlson. But there is no reason to\nbelieve that a request for a protective order would have been granted.77\n\n\n   77\n       See Adams v. State, 390 P.3d 1194, 1203-04 (Alaska App. 2017) (\u201c[W]hen a claim\nof ineffective assistance of counsel is based on an attorney\u2019s failure to pursue a motion, the\n                                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                           \u2013 48 \u2013                                       2641\n\f              2. The superior court\u2019s erroneous findings regarding the\n              first jury\u2019s awareness of the recorded confession\n              As we just explained, there are two prongs to an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim: incompetency, and resulting prejudice. In Carlson\u2019s case, the majority\nof the superior court\u2019s order addressed the incompetency prong, and very little attention\nwas paid to the prejudice prong. The superior court devoted only a page and a half of\nits twenty-eight page order to its prejudice analysis. The superior court\u2019s reasons for\nfinding prejudice ultimately rested on its erroneous findings that (1) the protective order\nwould have been granted; and (2) \u201cthere is a possibility\u201d that the granting of the\nprotective order would have made a difference to the outcome of Carlson\u2019s second trial.\n              The superior court reached this conclusion because of a mistaken finding\nthat the jury at Carlson\u2019s first trial \u201cdid not see or hear\u201d Dayan\u2019s participation in the\nNovember 10 confession (and they could not reach a verdict on the murder charge),\nwhile the jurors at the second trial were informed of Dayan\u2019s participation in the\nNovember 10 confession (and they convicted Carlson).\n              As the State points out on appeal, the superior court is mistaken in its\ncharacterization of the difference between the two trials. The record shows that the jury\nat the first trial heard (and partially saw) Dayan\u2019s participation in the November 10\nconfession.78 The audio recording of the November 10 interview was played for the\n\n   77\n        (...continued)\ndefendant must show (1) that the proposed motion would ultimately have been successful,\n(2) that any competent attorney would have pursued the proposed motion, and (3) that there\nis reason to believe that the ultimate outcome of the proceedings would have been different\nhad the motion been granted.\u201d) (citing State v. Steffensen, 902 P.2d 340, 342 (Alaska App.\n1995)).\n   78\n       As previously explained, the prosecutor played portions of the videotape for the first\njury during his opening statement. But the prosecutor failed to introduce this evidence at\n                                                                              (continued...)\n\n                                           \u2013 49 \u2013                                      2641\n\fjuries at both trials, and Dayan\u2019s active participation was obvious from that recording.\nThus, contrary to the superior court\u2019s assumptions, the jury at Carlson\u2019s first trial was\nwell aware of Dayan\u2019s support for the \u201caccidental shooting\u201d version of events that\nCarlson described during the November 10 confession \u2014 and thus well aware of the\npotential dissonance between the position Dayan advocated in November 1998 and the\nposition he was advocating at Carlson\u2019s trial.\n              In sum, even though there were differences between the two trials that are\npotentially relevant to an analysis of Carlson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim,\nthe superior court was mistaken as to what those differences were.79\n\n\n              3. The trial court\u2019s finding that Dayan \u201cmade little to no\n              attempt to unring the accidental discharge bell\u201d\n              At the evidentiary hearing, attorney Murtagh testified that Carlson\u2019s trial\nwould have been \u201ccompletely different\u201d if a different attorney had \u201cdevelop[ed] ...\nCarlson\u2019s psychological mental state on the day of the [November 10] confession.\u201d In\nthe superior court\u2019s written ruling, the court quoted Murtagh\u2019s testimony approvingly\nand seemingly adopted Murtagh\u2019s view that a different lawyer would have done more\nto attack the November 10 confession as false. According to the superior court, a\n\n\n   78\n       (...continued)\ntrial. The jury asked to review this evidence during its lengthy deliberations and were\ninformed that the audiotape was available but the videotaped portions (which included\nCarlson\u2019s confession and the reenactment) were not available because they were never\nintroduced into evidence. This error was not repeated at the second trial, where the relevant\nvideotaped portions were admitted at trial and widely discussed by both parties during\nclosing arguments.\n   79\n        We note that, with the exception of Carlson\u2019s trial testimony, the first trial has not\nbeen transcribed and it is therefore not clear how the confession was argued and presented\nto the jury at that trial.\n\n                                           \u2013 50 \u2013                                       2641\n\fdifferent lawyer would have been able to \u201cattack[] the [November 10] statement by\npointing out mistakes and [the] influence Dayan had in eliciting the statement,\u201d and by\nattributing that statement to \u201cthe natural progression of youth.\u201d\n               The superior court also contrasted what this hypothetical new attorney\nmight have done with what Dayan did at trial \u2014 criticizing Dayan for \u201cnot utiliz[ing] any\nof these tools\u201d and making \u201clittle to no attempt to unring the accidental discharge bell.\u201d\n               But contrary to the superior court\u2019s characterization of Dayan\u2019s trial\nperformance, Dayan actually did utilize many of these tools, and he made active efforts\nto \u201cunring\u201d the accidental shooting version of events. In his summation to the jury,\nDayan expressly argued that Carlson falsely confessed during the November 10\ninterview, and Dayan discussed the reasons why Carlson would have done that. He\nemphasized Carlson\u2019s youth, and he argued that Carlson was overwhelmed by the\ninvestigation and easily influenced by the adults around him \u2014 including both Detective\nArend and Dayan himself.\n               This is not to say that these same arguments could not have been stronger\nif a different attorney was making them. But the difficulty we face in reviewing the\nsuperior court\u2019s prejudice analysis is that the court\u2019s analysis fails to address the\nconsiderable strength of the State\u2019s case against Carlson, and it likewise fails to address\nthe credibility problems Carlson faced, regardless of who was representing him. This is\nnot a case where prejudice \u2014 i.e., the possibility of a different outcome at trial \u2014 is so\nobvious that an in-depth prejudice analysis is not required. Currently, the superior\ncourt\u2019s prejudice analysis is premised on faulty assumptions and incorrect facts. The\nsuperior court\u2019s order barely mentions the State\u2019s evidence in its analysis, and the court\u2019s\norder only briefly acknowledges the trial judge\u2019s finding that Carlson committed perjury\nat both of his trials.\n\n\n\n                                          \u2013 51 \u2013                                      2641\n\f              To be clear, we are not saying that the superior court was bound by the trial\njudge\u2019s finding that Carlson perjured himself at the two trials, or by the trial judge\u2019s\nfinding that the \u201cB\u201d version of events was \u201cpatently false.\u201d But the superior court\nneeded to acknowledge those findings and address them in some way \u2014 particularly\ngiven the fact that, unlike the trial judge, the superior court never heard Carlson testify.\n(Carlson did not take the stand during the post-conviction relief proceedings.) The\nsuperior court also needed to acknowledge the credibility difficulties that Carlson faced,\nregardless of who represented him at trial.\n              Because the superior court\u2019s order fails to provide adequate reasons for the\ncourt\u2019s finding of prejudice, we conclude that a remand for further proceedings is\nrequired.\n\n\n       Conclusion\n              For the reasons explained above, we AFFIRM the superior court\u2019s ruling\nthat Carlson\u2019s application for post-conviction relief was timely. We likewise AFFIRM\nthe superior court\u2019s ruling that Carlson\u2019s application is not prohibited by our decision in\nArnett. However, we REVERSE the superior court\u2019s ruling on Carlson\u2019s ineffective\nassistance of appellate counsel claim (a ruling which Carlson concedes is erroneous), and\nwe VACATE the superior court\u2019s rulings on Carlson\u2019s conflict of interest claim and his\nineffective assistance of trial counsel claim. We REMAND this case to the superior\ncourt for further proceedings consistent with the guidance provided here.\n\n\n\n\n                                          \u2013 52 \u2013                                      2641\n\f",
