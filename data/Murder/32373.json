The defendant presented no evidence that he suffered from a mental infirmity not rising to the level of insanity at the time of the homicide (see People v Smith, 1 NY3d 610 [2004]; People v Roche, supra at 75-76), and his conduct was \u201cinconsistent with the loss of control associated with extreme emotional disturbance\u201d (People v Yong Ho Han, 200 AD2d 780, 781 [1994]; see People v Roche, supra at 77; People v Barber, 2 AD3d 1290 [2003]; People v Murden, 190 AD2d 822 [1993]).\n*632The defendant received the effective assistance of counsel (see People v Benevento, 91 NY2d 708 [1998]).\nThe sentence imposed was not excessive (see People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]).
