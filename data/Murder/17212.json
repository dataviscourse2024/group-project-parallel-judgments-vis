SMITH, Circuit Judges.\n\n       Ronda Renee Bird appeals from the 37-month sentence imposed following\n\nher guilty-plea conviction for involuntary manslaughter, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 1153(a) and 1112(a). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we\n\n\n\n\n          *\n             This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent\nexcept as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.\n          **\n             The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision\nwithout oral argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).\n\faffirm.\n\n      Bird contends that the government breached the plea agreement by failing to\n\nmove for a third point for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b).\n\nUnder the terms of the plea agreement, the government was not obligated to move\n\nfor the third point if Bird acted in any way that was inconsistent with acceptance of\n\nresponsibility. The record reflects that the government had an adequate basis to\n\ndecline to move for the third point. Accordingly, it did not breach the plea\n\nagreement. See United States v. Cannel, 517 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir. 2008)\n\n(\"Because the government was obligated to move for the reduction only if [the\n\ndefendant] met the specified conditions, and because there is no suggestion that it\n\nacted based on unconstitutional or arbitrary motives, the government did not\n\nbreach the plea agreement by not recommending an adjustment for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility.\") (footnote omitted).\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2                                    11-30198\n\f",
