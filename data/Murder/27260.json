ALLEN, JR.,\n\n     Defendant-Appellant.\n____________________________\n\n                   Submitted June 15, 2020 \u2013 Decided June 26, 2020\n\n                   Before Judges Fisher and Fasciale.\n\n                   On appeal from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law\n                   Division, Sussex County, Indictment No. 10-01-0027.\n\n                   Joseph E. Krakora, Public Defender, attorney for\n                   appellant (Anderson David Harkov, Designated\n                   Counsel, on the brief).\n\n                   Francis A. Koch, Sussex County Prosecutor, attorney\n                   for respondent (Shaina Brenner, Assistant Prosecutor,\n                   of counsel and on the brief).\n\nPER CURIAM\n\f      Defendant appeals from an April 17, 2019 order denying his petition for\n\npost-conviction relief (PCR), which challenged his sentence as illegal for failure\n\nto award gap-time credit.1 Without conducting an evidentiary hearing, the PCR\n\njudge denied the petition\u2014not squarely on the merits of whether the sentence\n\nwas illegal for failure to award gap-time credits\u2014but rather by concluding that\n\nthe petition was time-barred under Rule 3:22-12, that plea counsel was not\n\nineffective for seeking gap-time credits at sentencing, and, determinatively, that\n\nthe gap-time issue was moot because defendant served his NERA sentence and\n\nwas on parole by the time he filed the petition.2 Having considered the legality\n\nof the sentence de novo, we reverse.\n\n      Defendant first unsuccessfully sought gap-time credit at sentencing.\n\nThen, after our Supreme Court denied certification, but before the filing of the\n\n\n1\n  In 2013, defendant pled guilty to second-degree aggravated assault, N.J.S.A.\n2C:12-1(b)(1) and received a ten-year prison sentence subject to the No Early\nRelease Act (NERA), N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2. In January 2014, we upheld the\nconviction on our excessive sentence oral argument calendar, rejecting\ndefendant's sole contention that the sentencing judge double counted\naggravating factors, and our Supreme Court denied certification in July 2014.\nState v. Allen, 218 N.J. 530 (2014). Defendant did not file the petition until he\nwas on parole after serving the NERA portion of his sentence.\n2\n  Defendant did not challenge the PCR judge's determination that plea counsel\nrendered effective assistance of counsel by vigorously arguing at sentencing that\ndefendant was entitled to gap-time credit. The effectiveness of plea counsel is\nnot an issue on appeal.\n                                                                          A-4705-18T2\n                                        2\n\fpetition, defendant made numerous additional attempts to amend the judgment\n\nof conviction (JOC) to include 277 days of gap-time credit.        Initially, he\n\nsucceeded in having the motion judge amend the JOC after a senior probation\n\nofficer recommended awarding the additional credit. The motion judge then\n\nvacated the amended JOC because he entered it without notice to the State.\n\nThereafter, defendant filed multiple motions seeking to correct what he believed\n\nwas an illegal sentence. The motion judge rejected defendant's contention,\n\ndenied his motions, and in January 2018, entered an amended JOC reflecting no\n\ngap-time credit. Defendant filed his PCR petition in May 2018.\n\n      On appeal, defendant argues:\n\n            POINT I\n\n            THE TIME BAR OF R[ULE] 3:22-12 SHOULD NOT\n            BE APPLIED TO DEFENDANT'S PETITION FOR\n            [PCR] BECAUSE 1) IT DOES NOT APPLY TO AN\n            ILLEGAL SENTENCE, 2) THE JUDGMENT IN\n            QUESTION WAS FILED ON JANUARY 17, 2018, 3)\n            TWO YEARS OF DELAYS WERE DUE TO\n            INEFFICIENCIES IN THE COURT SYSTEM, AND\n            4) THE [FORTY-DAY] DEADLINE WAS ONLY\n            MISSED BY ONE MONTH[.]\n\n            POINT II\n\n            DEFENDANT'S SENTENCE WAS ILLEGAL\n            BECAUSE IT FAILED TO ALLOCATE TO HIM THE\n            277 DAYS OF GAP-TIME HE WAS EN[T]ITLED TO\n\n\n                                                                        A-4705-18T2\n                                       3\n\f            AND THE [PCR JUDGE] ERRED WHEN [HE]\n            FAILED TO CORRECT THIS ERROR[.]\n\n      An argument pertaining to gap-time credit presents questions of the\n\nsentence's legality, which may be raised\u2014like here\u2014by filing a PCR petition.\n\nSee State v. Shabazz, 263 N.J. Super. 246, 251 (App. Div. 1993) (permitting a\n\ndefendant to challenge a sentence's legality through a PCR petition). Of course,\n\nan illegal sentence may be corrected at any time and is not time-barred by Rule\n\n3:22-12. State v. Acevedo, 205 N.J. 40, 47 n.4 (2011).\n\n      N.J.S.A. 2C:44-5(b) governs gap-time credit for prison sentences imposed\n\nat different times. In particular, the statute addresses situations in which a\n\ndefendant, \"who has previously been sentenced to imprisonment[,] is\n\nsubsequently sentenced to another term for an offense committed prior to the\n\nformer sentence, other than an offense committed while in custody.\" N.J.S.A.\n\n2C:44-5(b)(2) provides: \"Whether the [judge] determines that the terms shall\n\nrun concurrently or consecutively, the defendant shall be credited with ti me\n\nserved in imprisonment on the prior sentence in determining the permissible\n\naggregate length of the term or terms remaining to be served[.]\" See also State\n\nv. Hernandez, 208 N.J. 24, 38 (2011), overruled in part on other grounds, State\n\nv. C.H., 228 N.J. 111, 123 (2017).\n\n\n\n                                                                        A-4705-18T2\n                                       4\n\f      Thus, this statute \"awards a defendant who is given two separate sentences\n\non two different dates credit toward the second sentence for the time spent in\n\ncustody since he or she began serving the first sentence.\" Ibid. Our Supreme\n\nCourt has said that a defendant is entitled to gap-time credit when \"(1) the\n\ndefendant has been sentenced previously to a term of imprisonment[;] (2) the\n\ndefendant is sentenced subsequently to another term[;] and (3) both offenses\n\noccurred prior to the imposition of the first sentence.\" State v. Franklin, 175\n\nN.J. 456, 462 (2003).      If the defendant satisfies those requirements, the\n\nsentencing judge must award gap-time credit. Booker v. N.J. State Parole Bd.,\n\n136 N.J. 257, 261 (1994). The imposition of gap-time credit is not subject to\n\nwhether a defendant received a NERA sentence or whether it will protect a\n\ndefendant from parole violations.\n\n      The parties and judges involved in this case touched upon whether the\n\nrequested gap-credit was moot given the NERA sentence. Gap-time credits do\n\nnot affect a period of parole ineligibility but may otherwise affect the actual date\n\nof parole eligibility. Id. at 263-65. Gap-time credits will not reduce the period\n\nof parole ineligibility imposed by NERA. See Hernandez, 208 N.J. at 41. But\n\nhere, the question is not whether the gap-time credit affected defendant's NERA\n\nsentence\u2014or for that matter\u2014whether the gap-time credit impacted a potential\n\n\n                                                                            A-4705-18T2\n                                         5\n\fparole violation while defendant served his three-year period of parole\n\nsupervision. Instead, the legal issue is whether defendant satisfied the statute's\n\nelements and case law.     Such a question requires an analysis of the three\n\nstatutory requirements, which the judge failed to do. In turn, we will perform\n\nthis analysis as our review is de novo.\n\n      First, it is undisputed that defendant has been sentenced \"previously to a\n\nterm of imprisonment.\" Franklin, 175 N.J. at 462. That is, he committed a\n\nseparate   weapons    offense   and   received     an   eighteen-month   sentence\n\ncommencing on November 7, 2008. He served 277 days\u2014from November 7,\n\n2008 to May 1, 2010, the date he was released from prison for the weapons\n\nconviction. Thus, he met the first statutory requirement.\n\n      Second, it is also clear that defendant was \"sentenced subsequently to\n\nanother term.\" Ibid. On January 21, 2010, the State charged defendant with\n\nfirst-degree attempted murder, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-l(a)(l) and N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3;\n\nsecond-degree aggravated assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-l(b)(l); and third-degree\n\nendangering an injured victim, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-l.2(a). He pled guilty to the\n\naggravated assault charge, and on March 28, 2013, defendant received a ten-\n\nyear prison term, subject to NERA.            Thus, he met the second statutory\n\nrequirement.\n\n\n                                                                          A-4705-18T2\n                                          6\n\f      Third, \"both offenses occurred prior to the imposition of the first\n\nsentence.\" Ibid. That is, the weapons offense occurred before November 7,\n\n2008. The aggravated assault occurred either on November 7, 2008 (before the\n\njudge sentenced him on the weapons charge), or before November 7, 2008.\n\nAlthough police did not arrest defendant for committing the aggravated assault\n\nuntil July 2009, it is undisputed that the aggravated assault \"occurred prior to\n\nthe imposition of the first sentence.\" Ibid. Thus, defendant satisfied the third\n\nstatutory requirement.\n\n      Accordingly, under N.J.S.A. 2C:44-5(b), defendant's sentence was illegal\n\nbecause he was entitled to 277 days of gap-time credit from November 7, 2008\n\nto May 1, 2010. The questions of what impact the gap credit may have had on\n\nhis release date\u2014if any\u2014and whether the gap credit will affect any subsequent\n\nparole violation is not before us and are not relevant factors under the statute.\n\n      Reversed and remanded. We direct that the judge enter an amended JOC\n\nreflecting defendant is entitled to 277 days in gap-time credit from November 7,\n\n2008 to May 1, 2010. We do not retain jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-4705-18T2\n                                        7\n\f",
