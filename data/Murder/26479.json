The inmates filed\nsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that 2015 Neb. Laws, L.B.\n268, which abolished the death penalty in Nebraska, was not\nrepealed by referendum. The inmates further sought injunctive\nrelief preventing the Department of Correctional Services and\nits director, Scott R. Frakes, from carrying out executions or\nsteps toward execution against any plaintiffs or indispensable\nparties. The Lancaster County District Court dismissed the\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim. The inmates appeal. We\naffirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.\n                         BACKGROUND\n   Plaintiffs in this case are Jose Sandoval, Roy L. Ellis, Jorge\nGalindo, Nikko Jenkins, John L. Lotter, Raymond Mata, Marco\nE. Torres, and Eric F. Vela (the inmates). Indispensable parties\nare Arthur L. Gales, Jeffrey Hessler, and Carey Dean Moore.\nThe inmates and indispensable parties were all convicted of\nfirst degree murder and sentenced to death. Since the filing of\nthe complaint, Moore has been executed.\n\f                             - 140 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   302 Nebraska R eports\n                     SANDOVAL v. RICKETTS\n                       Cite as 302 Neb. 138\n\n   The Nebraska Legislature passed L.B. 268 over the veto of\nGovernor John Peter Ricketts on May 27, 2015. L.B. 268 abol-\nished the death penalty in Nebraska. The Legislature adjourned\non May 29; under Neb. Const. art. III, \u00a7 27, L.B. 268 would\ntake effect on August 30.\n   Following the passage of L.B. 268, opponents of the bill\norganized as \u201cNebraskans for the Death Penalty, Inc.,\u201d and, on\nJune 1, 2015, filed documents with the Nebraska Secretary of\nState seeking a referendum to repeal L.B. 268. On August 26,\nthe opponents so organized filed with the Secretary of State\npetitions purporting to include the signatures of approximately\n166,000 Nebraskans in support of the referendum. On October\n16, the Secretary of State\u2019s office announced that verification\nof those signatures was complete and that enough signatures\n(in this case 143,000) had been verified to suspend the opera-\ntion of L.B. 268. During the November 8 election, a vote was\nheld on the referendum. The referendum passed, and L.B. 268\nwas repealed.\n   The complaint in this case was filed on December 4, 2017,\nand seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. Defendants in this\naction are Ricketts (in both his individual and official capaci-\nties), State Treasurer Don Stenberg (in both his individual and\nofficial capacities), Attorney General Doug Peterson (in only\nhis official capacity), Frakes (in only his official capacity),\nJudy Glassburner, Aimee Melton, and Bob Evnen.\n   Count I seeks a declaratory judgment that the referendum\nwas not legally sufficient or effective because members of the\nexecutive branch, including Ricketts and Stenberg, proposed,\ninitiated, financed, organized, managed, and directed the proc\u00ad\ness, in violation of the Nebraska Constitution\u2019s separation of\npowers provision.\n   Count II seeks a declaratory judgment that the referendum\nagainst L.B. 268 failed for lack of a sworn statement from the\nsponsors stating that the list of identified sponsors was truth-\nful and accurate.\n\f                             - 141 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   302 Nebraska R eports\n                     SANDOVAL v. RICKETTS\n                       Cite as 302 Neb. 138\n\n   Count III seeks a declaratory judgment that the punishments\nfor the inmates and the indispensable parties (except Jenkins,\nwho was not sentenced to death as of May 30, 2017) were, by\noperation of law, converted into sentences of life imprisonment\non August 30, 2015, and that the August 26 filing of unverified\nsignatures did not suspend the effect of L.B. 268. Moreover,\nthe October 15 announcement that sufficient signatures had\nbeen verified did not reinstate the death penalty for those indi-\nviduals whose penalties had been changed to life imprisonment\non August 30.\n   Defendants filed motions to dismiss, which were granted by\nthe district court. The court reasoned that (1) the inmates had\nequally serviceable remedies, (2) the inmates failed to state\na claim that Ricketts or Stenberg violated the separation of\npowers doctrine, (3) L.B. 268 never took effect, and (4) the\nLegislature lacked the power to modify the inmates\u2019 sentences.\n   The inmates appeal.\n                  ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   The inmates assign, renumbered and restated, that the district\ncourt erred in finding that (1) the inmates had other serviceable\nremedies; (2) L.B. 268 was suspended on August 26, 2015,\nupon the filing of unverified signatures; (3) the Legislature\nwas without the power to modify the inmates\u2019 sentences from\ndeath to life imprisonment; and (4) the inmates failed to state\na cause of action under the separation of powers provisions of\nthe Nebraska Constitution, and by failing to allow the inmates\nto amend their pleading to state a claim.\n   On cross-appeal, defendants Stenberg, Glassburner, Melton,\nand Evnen assign that the district court erred in not finding\nthey were misjoined parties and not accordingly dismissing\nthem from the action.\n                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1] Determination of a jurisdictional issue which does not\ninvolve a factual dispute is a matter of law which requires an\n\f                                     - 142 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        302 Nebraska R eports\n                            SANDOVAL v.

The\ndistrict court implicitly rejected this argument, and defendants\nagain raise it here. They argued that the inmates\n      filed a civil declaratory judgment action to collaterally\n      attack their final death penalty sentences ordered by other\n      district courts who had jurisdiction over [the inmates]\n      and their crimes, which sentences were final after having\n      been affirmed on appeal by the Nebraska Supreme Court.\n      In short, [the inmates] filed the wrong procedure in the\n      wrong court against the wrong defendants to obtain the\n      remedy of having their death penalty sentences vacated\n      and enjoined from being carried out.4\n   We disagree. Plainly, a district court has jurisdiction to hear\nand decide a declaratory judgment action.5 But defendants\u2019\nargument regarding jurisdiction certainly touches on the allega-\ntions made by the inmates and whether those allegations stated\n\n\u20021\t\n      State v.

We now turn to that question.\nEqually Serviceable Remedies.\n   The inmates argue that the district court erred in finding\nthey could not maintain a declaratory judgment claim because\nthey had other equally serviceable remedies\u2014in their cases,\npostconviction actions arguing that their death sentences were\nvoid as a result of L.B. 268.\n   [4] We have held under similar circumstances that an action\nfor a declaratory judgment does not lie where another equally\nserviceable remedy is available.6 In Hall v. State, the defendant\nwas convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to life\nimprisonment. This court affirmed that conviction and sentence\nand later dismissed an appeal of the denial of the defendant\u2019s\nmotion seeking postconviction relief. The defendant then filed\nthree motions seeking declaratory judgments and a second\npetition for postconviction relief. In those motions, he sought a\nfinding that the second degree murder statute was unconstitu-\ntionally vague and overbroad.\n   We rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that declaratory judg-\nment was an available remedy, observing that he had the\nopportunity to challenge the constitutionality of the relevant\nstatutes in the criminal proceedings against him, through his\ndirect appeal or a postconviction motion, but failed to do\nso. The defendant\u2019s motions seeking a declaratory judgment\nwere a collateral attack on his convictions. We also dismissed\nhis postconviction motion seeking similar relief as procedur-\nally barred.\n   We addressed a similar situation in State v. Dunster.7 In\nDunster, the defendant filed a motion for new trial and a\nmotion to vacate his death sentence. He asked us to recognize\na new procedure for the purpose of challenging a purportedly\n\n\u20026\t\n      Hall v. State, 264 Neb. 151, 646 N.W.2d 572 (2002).\n\u20027\t\n      State v. Dunster, 270 Neb. 773, 707 N.W.2d 412 (2005).\n\f                              - 144 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   302 Nebraska R eports\n                      SANDOVAL v.

We declined that invitation, noting that a post-\nconviction motion, properly made, would be available to assert\nthat one\u2019s sentence was void.\n   In this case, the record establishes that Jenkins\u2019 direct appeal\nis pending and that the other inmates have filed motions seek-\ning postconviction relief. Each has raised the assertion that his\ndeath sentence or sentences are unconstitutional and void under\nL.B. 268. While we decline to hold that a postconviction action\nwill always be the correct procedure, it is available here and\nprovides all but Jenkins with a remedy which, compared to the\ndeclaratory judgment sought, is equally serviceable. Jenkins\u2019\nequally serviceable remedy is his pending direct appeal.\n   We conclude that the inmates have equally serviceable rem-\nedies and accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of\ntheir declaratory judgment action. We need not reach the\ninmates\u2019 remaining assignments of error or the cross-appeal\nfiled by Stenberg, Glassburner, Melton, and Evnen.\n                       CONCLUSION\n   We affirm the decision of the district court dismissing\nthe inmates\u2019 suit because other equally serviceable remedies\nwere available.\n                                                  A ffirmed.\n   Miller-Lerman and Freudenberg, JJ., not participating.\n\f",
