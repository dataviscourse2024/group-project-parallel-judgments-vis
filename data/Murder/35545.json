Lamb, Judge\n\n       Timothy Shepherd appeals his conviction for driving while intoxicated in which\n\nhe was sentenced as a habitual offender. Shepherd argues the state failed to prove he was\n\na habitual offender based solely on a certified copy of his Colorado driving record\n\nbecause the state introduced no facts underlying the Colorado convictions to show the\n\nconduct involved would qualify as intoxication-related traffic offenses (\u201cIRTOs\u201d) in\n\nMissouri at the time of his current offense. This Court has jurisdiction, Mo. Const. art. V,\n\nsec. 10. The circuit court\u2019s judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for\n\nresentencing.\n\f                                          Background\n\n       On March 21, 2017, Timothy Shepherd was involved in a single-vehicle accident\n\nin Warren County, Missouri, while driving after consuming about six beers. A blood test\n\nafter the accident revealed Shepherd\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.280 percent. Relevant\n\nto this appeal, Shepherd was charged with one count of the class B felony of driving\n\nwhile intoxicated as a habitual offender. 1 To prove Shepherd was a habitual offender, the\n\nstate offered only a certified copy of Shepherd\u2019s Colorado driving record, which outlines\n\nseven prior convictions: four (involving conduct occurring in 1985, 1991, 2000, and\n\n2003) for \u201cdriving while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs,\u201d and three\n\n(involving conduct occurring in 1984, 1988, and 2001) for \u201cdriving while ability was\n\nimpaired by alcohol and/or drugs.\u201d\n\n       Shepherd objected to the admission of his Colorado record as evidence that he was\n\na habitual offender. 2 The circuit court overruled his objection and held the Colorado\n\nrecord sufficiently proved he was a habitual offender because it showed \u201c[Shepherd] has\n\nbeen found guilty of driving while intoxicated in Boulder County, Colorado on seven\n\ndifferent occasions.\u201d\n\n       After his bench trial, the circuit court found Shepherd guilty of the present offense\n\nof driving while intoxicated and sentenced him to 10 years\u2019 incarceration as a habitual\n\n\n\n1\n   Shepherd also was convicted on one count of failing to drive on the right half of a roadway\nwhen the roadway was of sufficient width, resulting in an accident. Shepherd does not dispute\nthis conviction on appeal.\n2\n   Shepherd does not pursue his evidentiary objection in this appeal, only his claim regarding the\nsufficiency of the evidence. Accordingly, this Court assumes the Colorado record was\n\n                                                2\n\foffender. Shepherd appeals, arguing the Colorado record \u2013 standing alone \u2013 was\n\ninsufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt he was a habitual offender. This Court\n\nagrees.\n\n                                           Analysis\n\n       Driving while intoxicated is a class B misdemeanor. \u00a7 577.010.2(1). 3 If the state\n\nproves the defendant is a \u201chabitual offender\u201d under section 577.010.2(6)(a), however, the\n\noffense is enhanced to a class B felony. As relevant to this appeal, a habitual offender is\n\n\u201ca person who has been found guilty of \u2026 five or more [IRTOs] committed on separate\n\noccasions.\u201d \u00a7 577.001(11)(a). When Shepherd committed the present DWI offense in\n\nMarch 2017, IRTOs were defined as:\n\n       [D]riving while intoxicated, driving with excessive blood alcohol content,\n       driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs in violation of a county or\n       municipal ordinance, or an offense in which the defendant was operating a\n       vehicle while intoxicated and another person was injured or killed in\n       violation of any state law, county or municipal ordinance, any federal\n       offense, or any military offense[.]\n\n\u00a7 577.001(15). In other words, Missouri law contemplates four categories of conduct that\n\nqualify as IRTOs: (1) driving while intoxicated; (2) driving with excessive blood alcohol\n\ncontent; (3) driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs in violation of a county or\n\nmunicipal ordinance; 4 and (4) operating a vehicle while intoxicated and another person\n\n\nadmissible and addresses only whether that record was sufficient to prove Shepherd\u2019s habitual\noffender status.\n3\n   Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to RSMo 2016 (effective January 1, 2017,\nto August 27, 2017), which were in effect at the time of Shepherd\u2019s present offense.\n4\n   Prior and subsequent versions of section 577.001(15) included the words \u201cof a state law\u201d\nimmediately before the words \u201ccounty or municipal ordinance\u201d in the third clause pertaining to\ndriving under the influence of alcohol. Shepherd\u2019s case arose in the brief period during which\n\n                                               3\n\fwas injured or killed in violation of any state law, county or municipal ordinance, any\n\nfederal offense, or any military offense. 5 Accordingly, the issue in this case is whether\n\nthe state proved five or more instances of conduct that qualify under the first two\n\napplicable IRTO categories and, in particular, whether Shepherd\u2019s driving record from\n\nColorado 6 \u2013 without more \u2013 constitutes such proof. It does not.\n\n       First, Shepherd contends the state must satisfy the version of section 577.001(15)\n\nand the definitions of the words used in that section that were in effect at the time of his\n\npresent offense rather than those in effect at the time of the prior Colorado offenses. This\n\nis correct. The enhancement provision in section 577.010.2(6)(a) and the definition\n\nprovided in section 577.001(15) speak only at the time of the enhancement, i.e., at the\n\ntime of Shepherd\u2019s present offense, and there is nothing in the plain language of section\n\n577.001(15) suggesting otherwise. Accordingly, this Court holds that a prior conviction\n\nqualifies as an IRTO only if the conduct involved constituted \u201cdriving while intoxicated\u201d\n\n(or another portion of the IRTO definition in section 577.001(15)) as defined at the time\n\n\n\nthis phrase was missing from this third clause. Thus, because Shepherd\u2019s Colorado convictions\nare in violation of Colorado state law, they cannot qualify under the third category of IRTOs,\nwhich contemplates \u201cdriving under the influence of alcohol or drugs in violation of county or\nmunicipal ordinance.\u201d\n5\n   Because Shepherd\u2019s Colorado convictions apparently do not involve the injuring or killing of\nanother person, they also cannot qualify under the fourth category of IRTOs, which contemplates\noffenses \u201cin which the defendant was operating a vehicle while intoxicated and another person\nwas injured or killed in violation of any state law, county or municipal ordinance, any federal\noffense, or any military offense[.]\u201d \u00a7 577.001(15) (emphasis added).\n6\n   Shepherd suggests, in an argument not made below, that the language of this statute permits\nonly Missouri convictions to be used to prove habitual offender status. Because the Court holds\nthe evidence was insufficient to prove habitual offender status in this case on other grounds, the\nCourt does not reach this issue.\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fof the current offense for which the state seeks enhancement, not the time of the conduct\n\nunderlying the prior conviction.\n\n       We now move to the question of whether Shepherd\u2019s Colorado conduct could\n\nqualify under any of the four applicable IRTO categories, as they were defined at the time\n\nof the present offense. As an initial matter, it is important to note that Shepherd\u2019s\n\nColorado conduct underlying his convictions, which constitute violations of state law that\n\ndid not involve the injuring or killing of another person, could not possibly fall under\n\nIRTO categories three or four, which contemplate violations of county or municipal\n\nordinances and offenses involving the injuring or killing of another person, respectively.\n\nWe must determine, therefore, whether Shepherd was convicted in Colorado of conduct\n\nthat constitutes either \u201cdriving while intoxicated\u201d or \u201cdriving with excessive blood\n\nalcohol content\u201d \u2013 the remaining two IRTO definitions. 7\n\n       In making this determination, it is necessary first to determine what is meant by\n\n\u201cdriving\u201d in the IRTO statute. As used in chapter 577 at the time of Shepherd\u2019s present\n\noffense, the word \u201cdriving\u201d means \u201cphysically driving or operating a vehicle or vessel.\u201d\n\n\u00a7 577.001(9). This does not include merely being in \u201cactual physical control\u201d of a\n\nvehicle. Cox v. Dir. of Revenue, 98 S.W.3d 548, 550 (Mo. banc 2003). 8 Because IRTOs\n\n\n7\n   Shepherd does not argue his Colorado convictions cannot constitute IRTOs under either of\nthese two definitions because the limitation in definition (3), i.e., that the out-of-state conviction\nwas for a county or municipal ordinance violation and not a state law violation, also modifies\ndefinitions (1) and (2) as well. Because the Court is vacating Shepherd\u2019s sentence on the basis of\narguments he does make, it need not address arguments he did not raise.\n8\n   Until 1996, \u201cdriving,\u201d as used in chapter 577, was defined as \u201cphysically driving or operating\nor being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle.\u201d \u00a7 577.001.1, RSMo 1994 (emphasis\nadded). Being in actual physical control of a vehicle included being in a position to regulate a\n\n                                                  5\n\fare defined in chapter 577, the definition of \u201cdriving\u201d provided in section 577.001(9)\n\napplies to the use of that term in the IRTO definition provided in section 577.001(15),\n\nincluding its use in the phrases \u201cdriving while intoxicated\u201d and \u201cdriving with excessive\n\nblood alcohol content.\u201d As a result, a prior offense that was based solely on the defendant\n\nbeing in physical control of a vehicle while intoxicated cannot qualify as an IRTO under\n\nthe definition in effect at the time of Shepherd\u2019s present offense because it did not\n\ninvolve \u201cdriving\u201d as that word was defined at the time of Shepherd\u2019s present offense.\n\nThis distinction is the key to identifying the failure of the state\u2019s proof.\n\n       The Colorado statutes under which Shepherd was convicted in his prior offenses\n\nmade no distinction between \u201cdriving\u201d a vehicle while in a proscribed condition and\n\nmerely being in \u201cactual physical control\u201d of that vehicle. Colorado\u2019s \u201cdriving under the\n\ninfluence\u201d statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 42-4-1301(1)(a) (Supp. 1996), made it \u201cunlawful for\n\nany person under the influence or while impaired by the use of alcohol, drugs, or both to\n\nbe in \u2018actual physical control\u2019 of a vehicle.\u201d People v. Swain, 959 P.2d 426, 431 (Colo.\n\n1998) (affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction for driving under the influence when found\n\nin a truck with keys in the ignition but the engine was not running). 9 Accordingly, this\n\n\n\nvehicle\u2019s movements. Cox, 98 S.W.3d at 550. In 1996, however, the General Assembly\nremoved the phrase \u201cbeing in actual physical control\u201d from the definition of \u201cdriving\u201d in section\n577.001.1, RSMo Supp. 1997. As a result, this Court held being in actual physical control of a\nvehicle is no longer \u201cdriving\u201d a vehicle for purposes of chapter 577. Cox, 98 S.W.3d at 550-51.\n9\n  The state contends Swain\u2019s construction of Colorado law applies only from the date of Swain\nforward and the only inference that can be drawn from convictions occurring before Swain is that\nthey were for \u201cdriving\u201d a vehicle while intoxicated and not merely being in \u201cactual physical\ncontrol\u201d of a vehicle while intoxicated. There is nothing in Swain to suggest it was changing any\nprior construction of Colorado law, however, and there are no Colorado cases adopting any\ndifferent construction. In fact, Swain is based on Brewer v. Motor Vehicle Division, Department\n\n                                                6\n\fCourt concludes that \u2013 at all times relevant to this case \u2013 it was possible to violate\n\nColorado\u2019s \u201cdriving under the influence\u201d statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 42-4-1301(1)(a),\n\neither by driving a vehicle while under the influence of drugs or alcohol or by merely\n\nbeing in actual physical control of the vehicle while in that condition.\n\n       Colorado\u2019s \u201cdriving while impaired\u201d statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 42-4-1301(1)(b)\n\n(Supp. 1996), also extends to merely being in actual physical control of the vehicle while\n\nimpaired. Plainly, the word at issue in Swain (i.e., \u201cdrives\u201d) appears in both provisions.\n\nMoreover, the Colorado \u201cdriving while under the influence\u201d and \u201cdriving while\n\nimpaired\u201d provisions are subsections of the same statute, and it is not credible that the\n\nColorado Supreme Court would give \u201cdrives\u201d one interpretation in the first subsection\n\nconcerning \u201cdriving while under the influence\u201d and a different interpretation to \u201cdrives\u201d\n\nin the very next subsection concerning \u201cdriving while impaired.\u201d Indeed, Swain drew no\n\ndistinction between the two anywhere in the opinion and addressed both in its concluding\n\nparagraph:\n\n       In sum, we hold that section 42-4-1301 makes it unlawful for any person\n       under the influence or while impaired by the use of alcohol, drugs, or both\n       to be in \u201cactual physical control\u201d of a vehicle. Accordingly, the judgment\n       of the district court is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the district\n       court with directions to reinstate the judgments of conviction and sentences\n       imposed for DWAI and driving without a driver\u2019s license.\n\nSwain, 959 P.2d at 431 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\nof Revenue, 720 P.2d 564, 567 (Colo. 1986) (construing \u201cdrove\u201d to include being in actual\nphysical control of a vehicle for purposes of Colorado informed consent law), and Swain noted\nthe Colorado legislature had not rejected the Brewer construction in the intervening 12 years.\nSwain, 959 P.2d at 430.\n\n                                               7\n\f       As a result, every one of Shepherd\u2019s seven prior Colorado convictions, whether for\n\n\u201cdriving\u201d under the influence or while impaired, could have been for driving a vehicle in\n\neither condition or for being in actual physical control of a vehicle in either condition.\n\nOnly the former, however, satisfies the definition of an IRTO in effect at the time of\n\nShepherd\u2019s present offense. In other words, the Colorado offenses prohibited conduct\n\nthat constituted \u201cdriving\u201d as that term was used in Missouri\u2019s IRTO statute and defined in\n\nsection 577.001(9) at the time of Shepherd\u2019s present offense, but they also prohibited\n\nconduct that would not be considered \u201cdriving\u201d as that term was used in section\n\n577.001(15) and defined in section 577.001(9).\n\n       In circumstances such as these (i.e., when the defendant was convicted in another\n\nstate under a statute prohibiting both conduct that does meet the applicable definition of\n\nan IRTO in Missouri and conduct that does not), this Court holds that it is the state\u2019s\n\nburden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, State v. Craig, 287 S.W.3d 676, 681 (Mo.\n\nbanc 2009), not merely that this out-of-state conviction occurred but also that the\n\nconviction arose from conduct that meets the definition of an IRTO under Missouri law at\n\nthe time of the present offense. 10\n\n\n10\n    From time to time, the court of appeals has stated that \u2013 in addition to meeting the applicable\ndefinition of an IRTO \u2013 the conduct underlying a prior out-of-state conviction must also\nconstitute a crime under Missouri law in effect at the time of the present offense. See, e.g., State\nv. Coday, 496 S.W.3d 572, 576 (Mo. App. 2016) (\u201c[I]n determining whether a defendant is a\n[habitual] offender, [a court] must determine whether the acts constituting the foreign conviction\nconstitute the commission of a crime under Missouri law.\u201d); State v. Gibson, 122 S.W.3d 121,\n130 (Mo. App. 2003) (holding the defendant\u2019s prior municipal DWI was not an IRTO because it\nwould no longer constitute the state offense of DWI under section 577.010, as defined in 2001).\nBut nothing in the plain text of the IRTO definition in section 577.001(15) supports such a\nrequirement, and this Court has no authority to impose requirements the legislature chose not to\nenact. Accordingly, to the extent Coday, Gibson, and similar cases purport to require that the\n\n                                                 8\n\f       Here, the state failed to show that five or more of Shepherd\u2019s Colorado\n\nconvictions were for conduct that qualifies as \u201cdriving\u201d while intoxicated or with\n\nexcessive blood alcohol content under the definitions of an IRTO and \u201cdriving\u201d that were\n\nin effect at the time of Shepherd\u2019s present offense. The state\u2019s proof consisted solely of a\n\ncopy of Shepherd\u2019s Colorado driving record, which showed seven prior Colorado\n\nconvictions for conduct that may \u2013 or may not \u2013 qualify as an IRTO under the applicable\n\nMissouri law. There was no evidence regarding the nature of the conduct underlying\n\nShepherd\u2019s Colorado convictions, i.e., whether he was convicted for actually driving\n\nwhile in a proscribed condition or was merely convicted for being in actual physical\n\ncontrol of a vehicle while in such a condition.\n\n       Nevertheless, the state argues its evidence was sufficient to prove five or more\n\nIRTOs because, even if one (or all) of the Colorado convictions \u201cmight\u201d have been for\n\nmerely being in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of or\n\nimpaired by drugs or alcohol, the circuit court was free to infer from the driving record\n\nalone that at least five of them were not, i.e., that at least five of them were for driving a\n\nvehicle while in a proscribed condition and not being merely in actual physical control.\n\nThis Court rejects this argument.\n\n\n\n\nconduct underlying a prior out-of-state conviction must qualify as an IRTO under the definition\nin effect at the time of the present offense and that such conduct must be a crime under Missouri\nlaw at the time of the present offense, those cases are now overruled.\n\n\n                                                9\n\f       With three exceptions, 11 there is nothing in Shepherd\u2019s Colorado driving record\n\nthat proves \u2013 or even suggests \u2013 anything about whether these convictions were for\n\ndriving while in a proscribed condition versus merely being in actual physical control\n\nwhile in that condition. On the face of the Colorado driving record, without more, there\n\nwas simply no evidence \u2013 nor any basis from which to draw a reasonable inference \u2013 as\n\nto whether the remaining four convictions involved conduct that qualifies as \u201cdriving\u201d as\n\nthat term is used in the applicable version of Missouri\u2019s IRTO definition. Those four\n\nconvictions might have been for driving while intoxicated or with excessive blood\n\n\n11\n    Shepherd\u2019s Colorado driving record shows three of his convictions (i.e., the driving under the\ninfluence conviction for conduct in 2000 and the driving while impaired convictions for conduct\nin 1984 and 1988) involved accidents. Shepherd concedes that the fact the record shows an\naccident was involved breaks the silence as to whether the conviction was for driving or merely\nbeing in actual physical control and allows the circuit court to infer that the underlying conduct\nwas the former. But he makes this concession only as to the 2000 conviction. He maintains that\n\u2013 even if his Colorado driving record supplies evidence showing two of his convictions for\ndriving while his ability was impaired by drugs or alcohol were for driving and not merely being\nin actual physical control \u2013 those do not qualify as IRTOs because he maintains the levels of\nblood alcohol required to establish a presumption of intoxication or impairment are different\nunder Colorado law and Missouri law. The Court rejects this argument because it confuses the\nelements of the two criminal statutes with the evidence that can be used to prove a violation of\nthose statutes. Driving while intoxicated in Missouri means that the defendant operated a motor\nvehicle in an intoxicated condition. \u00a7 577.010.1. \u201c[I]ntoxicated condition\u201d is defined as \u201cwhen a\nperson is under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance, or drug, or any combination\nthereof.\u201d \u00a7 577.001(13). That influence need only be slight. See State v. Schroeder, 330 S.W.3d\n468, 475 (Mo. banc 2011) (\u201cMissouri courts have also recognized that a driver is in an\n\u2018intoxicated condition\u2019 for purposes of a DWI prosecution if his use of alcohol impairs his ability\nto operate an automobile.\u201d); State v. Raines, 62 S.W.2d 727, 729 (Mo. banc 1933) (\u201cAny\nintoxication that in any manner impairs the ability of a person to operate an automobile is\nsufficient to sustain a conviction under the statute in question.\u201d). Colorado law defines that a\nperson is \u201cdriving while ability impaired\u201d when the consumption of alcohol or drugs (or both)\n\u201caffects the person to the slightest degree so that the person is less able than the person ordinarily\nwould have been, either mentally or physically \u2026 to exercise clear judgment, sufficient physical\ncontrol, or due care in the operation of a vehicle.\u201d Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 42-4-1301(1)(g).\nAccordingly, proof of driving while ability impaired under Colorado law, whether proved by\npresumption based on blood alcohol content or otherwise (including by admission in the course\nof a guilty plea) constitutes proof of driving while intoxicated under Missouri law.\n\n\n                                                 10\n\falcohol content, or they might have been for merely being in actual physical control of a\n\nvehicle while in such a condition. Despite the fact that this distinction is critical to\n\nwhether Shepherd\u2019s Colorado convictions qualify as IRTOs, the state\u2019s evidence was\n\nsilent on this issue.\n\n       The state argues the circuit court was entitled to fill this void with an inference\n\nthat the Colorado convictions were for \u201cdriving\u201d and not merely being in actual physical\n\ncontrol. True, the circuit court can choose to believe all, part, or none of the evidence,\n\nand can \u2013 if persuaded \u2013 draw any reasonable inference such evidence supports, but the\n\nkey word overlooked in the state\u2019s argument is the word \u201creasonable.\u201d For four of\n\nShepherd\u2019s Colorado convictions, the driving record is entirely silent as to whether he\n\nwas driving or merely in actual physical control of the vehicle and such silence provides\n\nno basis, let alone a reasonable one, for inferring the former is true and not the latter.\n\nWhen the evidence is utterly silent about the existence or non-existence of some fact, and\n\nthe finder of fact draws from such silence a conclusion about that fact, this is mere\n\nsupposition or speculation. It is not an inference, and certainly not a reasonable\n\ninference. Draper v. Louisville & N.R. Co., 156 S.W.2d 626, 630 (Mo. 1941)\n\n(\u201c[C]onjecture based on the possibility that a thing could have happened\u201d or \u201can idea or\n\nnotion founded on the probability that a thing may have occurred, but without proof that\n\nit did occur\u201d is not an inference but rather a \u201csupposition.\u201d).\n\n       To be clear, the flaw in the state\u2019s case is not that the evidence gave rise to two\n\nequally likely inferences as to whether the conduct underlying the four Colorado\n\nconvictions qualify as IRTOs under Missouri law at the time of the present offense. Had\n\n\n                                              11\n\fthat been the case, the circuit court could draw whichever inference it was persuaded to\n\ndraw. Instead, the problem is that the evidence in this case gave rise to no inference, and\n\ncertainly no reasonable inference, on that issue with respect to four of the Colorado\n\nconvictions. As explained above, there was a reasonable basis in the driving record to\n\ninfer that three of the Colorado convictions qualified as IRTOs under the applicable\n\nMissouri law, but no basis at all from which to draw a similar inference regarding the\n\nother four convictions. Because the state was required to prove five or more IRTOs to\n\nenhance Shepherd\u2019s sentence for the present offense on the ground that he was a\n\n\u201chabitual offender\u201d under section 577.010.2(6)(a), the sentence imposed was beyond the\n\nlawful range for the present offense.\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons set forth above, the state failed to meet its burden of proving\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Shepherd was convicted of at least five prior IRTOs\n\nbased solely on his Colorado diving record. As a result, the circuit court erred in\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fsentencing him as a habitual offender. The judgment of the circuit court, therefore, is\n\nvacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing. 12\n\n\n\n                                                             _____________________________\n                                                             Paul C.

Ransom, J., not participating.\n\n\n\n\n12\n    The case is remanded for resentencing because Shepherd concedes there was sufficient\nevidence for the circuit court to infer, if it is persuaded to do so, that Shepherd had one prior\nIRTO and, as explained herein, there was sufficient evidence for the circuit court to infer he had\ntwo more, subject to any further legal arguments Shepherd may raise not resolved herein. See\nState v. Collins, 849 S.W.2d 228 (Mo.

I also concur that the Colorado record\n\nshowing nothing more than the fact of convictions for driving under the influence of\n\nalcohol or drugs (\u201cDUI\u201d) and driving while impaired in violation of Colorado law did not\n\nsupport an inference that the offenses involved \u201cdriving,\u201d as defined in section\n\n577.001(15), because Colorado includes within its definition of driving being in actual\n\nphysical control of a vehicle. Further, I concur in overruling the holdings in State v.\n\nGibson, 122 S.W.3d 121 (Mo. App. 2003), State v. Coday, 496 S.W.3d 572 (Mo. App.\n\n\n1\n    All statutory references are to RSMo 2016, unless otherwise noted.\n\f2016), and similar cases to the extent they require a prior offense to constitute the\n\ncommission of a present-day crime in Missouri in order to qualify as an IRTO.             I\n\nrespectfully dissent, however, from the principal opinion\u2019s determination that a DUI in\n\nviolation of state law is an IRTO under section 577.001(15) and the resulting holding that\n\nthe state presented sufficient evidence of three IRTOs.\n\n      Because the principal opinion adequately explains the holdings with which I concur,\n\nthis opinion will explain only the point of dissent. Mr. Shepherd\u2019s certified Colorado\n\ndriving record showed three of Mr. Shepherd\u2019s prior offenses involved accidents \u2013 his DUI\n\nin violation of state law for conduct in 2000 and his driving while impaired offenses for\n\nconduct in 1984 and 1988. The principal opinion is correct that, for those three offenses,\n\nit can be inferred Mr. Shepherd\u2019s conduct involved driving, so the ambiguity in Colorado\u2019s\n\ndefinition of driving does not preclude the three offenses from qualifying as IRTOs. The\n\nanalysis of these three offenses, therefore, requires going beyond whether they involved\n\ndriving to decide whether they otherwise qualify as IRTOs.\n\n      Neither DUI in violation of state law nor driving while impaired are listed as IRTOs.\n\nSection 577.001(15). The omission of those offenses raises the question of whether a\n\nconviction for an offense that is not labeled the same as the listed offenses meets the\n\ndefinition of an IRTO in section 577.001(15). In deciding how courts should treat foreign\n\nconvictions for offenses that, in name, do not correspond to an IRTO, it is helpful to\n\ncompare the language of another statute that also considers whether out-of-state\n\nconvictions have consequences in Missouri.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       For purposes of assessing points and suspension or revocation of a driver\u2019s license,\n\nsection 302.160 provides:\n\n       When the director of revenue receives notice of a conviction in another state\n       or from a federal court, which, if committed in this state, would result in the\n       assessment of points, the director is authorized to assess the points and\n       suspend or revoke the operating privilege when the accumulated points so\n       require as provided in section 302.304.\n\nIn McIntyre v. David, 431 S.W.2d 216, 220 (Mo. 1968), this Court considered whether\n\nCalifornia\u2019s \u201cMisdemeanor Drunk Driving\u201d offense that made it a crime for \u201cany person\n\nwho is under the influence of intoxicating liquor, . . . to drive a vehicle upon any highway\u201d\n\nwould result in the assessment of 12 points if committed in this state. The Court found\n\n\u201c\u2018under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u2019 as used in said Section 23102(a) of the\n\nCalifornia Vehicle Code [was] synonymous with \u2018while in an intoxicated condition\u2019 as\n\nused in [s]ections 564.440 and 302.302, subd. 1(7)[, RSMo 1959,];\u201d therefore, a conviction\n\nof an offense under the California statute, if committed in this state, would result in the\n\nassessment of 12 points. Id. McIntyre\u2019s reasoning should be applied here. Foreign\n\nconvictions for offenses that do not correspond to an IRTO may generally qualify as IRTOs\n\nif they are synonymous with an offense listed as an IRTO.\n\n       Accepting that IRTOs generally include synonymous offenses, the principal opinion\n\nreaches the correct conclusion that Mr. Shepherd\u2019s driving while impaired convictions\n\ninvolving accidents qualify as IRTOs. The accidents resolve any ambiguity about whether\n\nthe driving while impaired convictions involved \u201cdriving,\u201d as defined in section\n\n577.001(9), and the offense is synonymous with a Missouri DWI.\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       It is tempting to say the same for Mr. Shepherd\u2019s convictions for DUI in violation\n\nof state law but for one significant difference. When Mr. Shepherd committed the present\n\nDWI offense in March 2017, section 577.001(15) included the offense of \u201cdriving under\n\nthe influence of alcohol or drugs\u201d as an IRTO only if the DUI was \u201cin violation of a county\n\nor municipal ordinance.\u201d This is in contrast to the other listed offenses, which included\n\nviolations of state law. Therefore, under the plain language of section 577.001(15), DUI\n\nin violation of state law was not an IRTO; only DUI in violation of a county or municipal\n\nordinance qualified. 2\n\n       The omission of DUI in violation of state law must be given effect. The general\n\nrule that synonymous foreign convictions qualify as IRTOs cannot apply to Mr. Shepherd\u2019s\n\nconvictions for DUI in violation of state law for it would give no effect to section\n\n577.001(15)\u2019s express inclusion of only DUIs in violation of a county or municipal\n\nordinances and plain omission of DUI in violation of state law. Concluding, as the\n\nprincipal opinion does, that a DUI in violation of state law is an IRTO because it amounts\n\nto a DWI runs afoul of section 577.001(15)\u2019s plain language.\n\n       If DUIs in violation of state law are IRTOs because they are DWIs, then the\n\nprincipal opinion\u2019s interpretation gives no effect to the omission of DUI in violation of\n\n\n2\n  Though resort to statutory construction is unnecessary because section 577.001(15), as\nwritten, does not include DUI in violation of state law, statutory construction reinforces its\nplain meaning. Under the familiar maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, when a\nstatute designates the persons or things to which it refers, courts should infer that all\nomissions are intentional exclusions. See Greenbriar Hills Country Club v. Dir. of\nRevenue, 47 S.W.3d 346, 352 (Mo. banc 2001) (finding omissions from an enumerated list\nin section 536.085, RSMo 1994, were intentional exclusions). Applying the maxim here,\nthe Court should infer the omission of DUI in violation of state law was intentionally\nexcluded from the list of IRTOs in section 577.001(15).\n                                              4\n\fstate law and the express inclusion of only DUI in violation of county or municipal\n\nordinance. It also brings into question the effect of the 2017 amendment to section\n\n577.001(15), which added DUI in violation of state law to the list of IRTOs. If DUI\u2019s in\n\nviolation of state law were already IRTOs under section 577.001(15) because they are\n\ninterchangeable with DWIs, then adding DUIs in violation of state law to the list of IRTOs\n\nin section 577.001(15), RSMo Supp. 2017, would be a meaningless act. The principal\n\nopinion\u2019s interpretation also renders the express inclusion of DUIs in violation of a county\n\nor municipal ordinance completely superfluous, for DUIs in violation of county or\n\nmunicipal ordinance would surely amount to a DWI in the same way a DUI in violation of\n\na state law would.\n\n       The only way to give effect to the express inclusion of DUI in violation of county\n\nor municipal ordinance and the omission of DUI in violation of state law is to hold a DUI\n\nin violation of state law is not an IRTO. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the\n\nprincipal opinion\u2019s holdings that a DUI in violation of state law is an IRTO under section\n\n577.001(15) and that the state presented sufficient evidence of three IRTOs. The DUI in\n\nviolation of state law is not an IRTO, so the state presented sufficient evidence of only two\n\nIRTOs. Mr. Shepherd\u2019s sentence should be vacated, and the case should be remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                          ___________________________________\n                                           PATRICIA BRECKENRIDGE, JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f                SUPREME COURT OF MISSOURI\n                                            en banc\n\nSTATE OF MISSOURI,                             )\n                                               )\n                             Respondent,       )\n                                               )\nv.                                             )   No. SC99081\n                                               )\nTIMOTHY A.

Due to the unique facts and circumstances of this case, I would affirm Timothy A.\n\nShepherd\u2019s (hereinafter, \u201cShepherd\u201d) enhanced sentence.\n\n       Shepherd challenged the sufficiency of the evidence from which he was found to be a\n\nhabitual offender. Shepherd claimed the substance of his prior Colorado IRTO convictions do not\n\ncorrespond to the conduct the Missouri legislature sought to deter by enhancing sentencing for\n\nhabitual offenders who have committed IRTOs.\n\n       Reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence \u201cis limited to ascertaining whether the [s]tate\n\npresented sufficient evidence \u2018from with a trier of fact could have reasonable found the defendant\n\fguilty.\u2019\u201d State v.

This Court reviews \u201cthe evidence and inferences in the\n\nlight most favorable to the verdict, ignoring all contrary evidence and inferences.\u201d Id. (quoting\n\nState v. Niederstadt, 66 S.W.3d 12, 14 (Mo. banc 2002)). \u201cThis is not an assessment of whether\n\nthe Court believes that the evidence at trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but rather\n\na question of whether, in light of the evidence most favorable to the [s]tate, any rational fact-finder\n\ncould have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d State v. Stewart,\n\n560 S.W.3d 531, 533 (Mo. banc 2018) (quoting State v. Wright, 382 S.W.3d 902, 903 (Mo. banc\n\n2012)). This Court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is de novo. McCord, 621 S.W.3d at 498.\n\n       Shepherd claims the state failed to prove he had been found guilty of five or more IRTOs\n\nbecause it failed to lay a foundation that his Colorado convictions \u201cactually are DWIs as compared\n\nto Missouri law or Colorado law.\u201d The crux of his argument is that his prior Colorado convictions\n\nare not IRTOs because the Colorado statutes under which he was convicted encompass conduct\n\nthat would\u2014and conduct that would not\u2014amount to the current Missouri offense of driving while\n\nintoxicated. Specifically, he asserts the Colorado statutes under which he was convicted made it\n\nunlawful to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol\n\nor drugs or while ability-impaired by alcohol or drugs. In contrast, being in physical control of a\n\nvehicle while under the influence currently does not constitute a Missouri offense of driving while\n\nintoxicated because it does not involve \u201cdriving,\u201d as that term is defined statutorily for purposes\n\nof chapter 577. 1\n\n\n1\n Until 1996, \u201cdriving,\u201d as used in chapter 577, was defined as \u201cphysically driving or operating or\nbeing in actual physical control of a motor vehicle.\u201d Section 577.001.1, RSMo 1994 (emphasis\n                                                  2\n\f                                       Statutory Analysis\n\n      \u201cThe primary goal of statutory interpretation is to give effect to legislative intent, which is\n\nmost clearly evidenced by the plain text of the statute.\u201d Gross v. Parson, 624 S.W.3d 877, 884\n\n(Mo. banc 2021). \u201cWhen a statute defines a term, that definition is given effect.\u201d Am. Nat\u2019l Life\n\nIns. Co. of Tex. v. Dir. of Revenue, 269 S.W.3d 19, 21 (Mo. banc 2008). Otherwise, a statute\u2019s\n\nwords are \u201ctaken in their plain or ordinary and usual sense.\u201d Section 1.090.\n\n      Driving while intoxicated is a class B misdemeanor. Section 577.010.2(1). 2 If the\n\ndefendant is a habitual offender, however, the offense is enhanced to a class B felony. Section\n\n577.010.2(6)(a). A habitual offender is \u201ca person who has been found guilty of five or more\n\n[IRTOs] committed on separate occasions.\u201d Section 577.001(11)(a). When Shepherd committed\n\nthe present driving while intoxicated offense in March 2017, IRTOs were defined as:\n\n      [D]riving while intoxicated, driving with excessive blood alcohol content, driving\n      under the influence of alcohol or drugs in violation of a county or municipal\n      ordinance, or an offense in which the defendant was operating a vehicle while\n      intoxicated and another person was injured or killed in violation of any state law,\n      county or municipal ordinance, any federal offense, or any military offense[.]\n\nSection 577.001(15).\n\n      Section 577.023.4 sets forth the type of evidence that may be used to prove prior IRTOs.\n\nHere, the state submitted a certified copy of Shepherd\u2019s Colorado driving records from the\n\n\n\n\nadded). Being in actual physical control of a vehicle included \u201cbeing in a position to regulate a\nvehicle\u2019s movements.\u201d Cox v. Dir. of Revenue, 98 S.W.3d 548, 550 (Mo. banc 2003). In 1996,\nhowever, the general assembly removed the phrase \u201cbeing in actual physical control\u201d from the\ndefinition of \u201cdriving\u201d in section 577.001.1, RSMo Supp. 1997. As a result, this Court held being\nin actual physical control of a vehicle no longer constitutes \u201cdriving\u201d a vehicle for purposes of\nchapter 577. Id.\n2\n  Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to RSMo 2016.\n                                                 3\n\fColorado department of revenue.        These records indicate Shepherd has seven prior IRTO\n\nconvictions and indicate he either \u201cDrove Vehicle While Under Influence of Alcohol and or\n\nDrugs\u201d or \u201cDrove Vehicle While Ability Impaired by Alcohol and or Drugs.\u201d This record\n\ndemonstrates Shepherd has more than five separate, prior IRTOs, which would classify him as a\n\nhabitual offender pursuant to section 577.001(11)(a). I would find there is no need to \u201cgo behind\n\nthe curtain\u201d of the certified Colorado driving record to determine whether those prior convictions\n\ncurrently would be punishable in Missouri. The legislature codified its determination that\n\ncertified driving records would be evidence of proof of a defendant\u2019s status as a prior offender.\n\nSection 577.023.4; see also State v. Collins, 328 S.W.3d 705, 708 n.4 (Mo. banc 2011) (finding\n\ndefendant\u2019s driving record, which listed his prior convictions, established defendant pleaded\n\nguilty to or was found guilty of those offenses). I would not create and insert language into the\n\nstatute, requiring an additional, and possibly burdensome, step in this analysis. This record\n\ndemonstrates Shepherd has more than five separate, prior IRTOs, which would classify him as a\n\nhabitual offender under Missouri law.\n\n       Additionally, it is clear the legislature did not intend to limit IRTOs to only violations of\n\nMissouri law. \u201c[H]ad the [g]eneral [a]ssembly intended to restrict [section] 577.023 to\n\nconvictions of [IRTOs] in violation of only Missouri State law, there would be no reason to\n\ninclude the crime \u2018driving under the influence of alcohol\u2019 in the definition of [IRTO].\u201d State v.\n\nRyan, 813 S.W.2d 898, 903 (Mo. App. S.D. 1991). The inclusion of such an offense signifies \u201ca\n\nlegislative intent to allow convictions of [IRTOs] in violation of the laws of other states to be\n\nused for enhancement under [section] 577.023.\u201d Id. To require that prior offenses be based on\n\nacts that would constitute a Missouri state offense at the time of the current offense, if\n\n                                                  4\n\fcommitted in Missouri, the Court would have to add words to section 577.001(15) under the\n\nauspice of discerning legislative intent, which it unquestionably cannot do. State v. Rowe, 63\n\nS.W.3d 647, 650 (Mo. banc 2002); Doyle v. Tidball, 625 S.W.3d 459, 466 (Mo. banc 2021).\n\n       The principal opinion\u2019s analysis of determining the applicable IRTO convictions for\n\npurposes of enhancement endangers Missouri citizens, whom the legislature sought to protect.\n\nStated differently, if at the time the out-of-state IRTO were committed the other jurisdiction\n\nwould have sanctioned the conduct, the IRTO conviction should be allowed to enhance\n\nsentencing regardless of any current Missouri statutory definitions. Failure to abide by this\n\napproach also would disqualify all prior Missouri IRTOs that do not meet a present definition\n\nfrom enhancing an offender\u2019s sentence. Excluding some prior IRTO convictions from\n\nenhancing a conviction when they previously would have been applicable is disturbing. I\n\nbelieve this was not the legislature\u2019s intent, thwarts the legislature\u2019s attempt to keep habitual\n\noffenders off our roadways, and endangers our citizens. Accordingly, I would affirm the circuit\n\ncourt\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          ____________________________\n                                                          GEORGE W.
