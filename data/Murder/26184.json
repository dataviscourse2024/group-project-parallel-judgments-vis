Date: October 4, 2017\n\n               This appeal comes before the Superior Court following the denial of a petition for writ of\n\n     habeas corpus and the dismissal of a Post Conviction Relief Act (hereinafter referred to as\n\n     \"PCRA\")1 petition. On July 17, 2017, the court dismissed the PCRA petition and denied habeas\n\n     corpus relief for the reasons set forth below.\n\n          I.      PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n               Gregory Stover (hereinafter referred to as \"Petitioner\") was found guilty by a jury of\n\n     second degree murder, robbery, and criminal conspiracy before the Honorable Robert A. Latrone.\n\n     On November 21, 1988, Judge Latrone sentenced Petitioner to life imprisonment without the\n\n     possibility of parole. The Superior Court affirmed the judgement of sentence on October 24, 1990.\n\n     The Supreme Court denied allocatur on October 17, 1991.\n\n               Petitioner filed his first prose PCRA petition on January 14, 1997. Counsel was appointed,\n\n     and upon review, filed a \"no merit\" Jetter pursuant to Finley/Turner. 2 The PCRA court accepted\n\n     the \"no merit\" letter, conducted an independent review, and eventually denied the petition on\n\n\n\n     1 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546.\n     2\n        Commonwealth v. Turner, 544 A.2d 927 (Pa. 1988), and Commonwealth v, Finley, 550 A.2d 213 {Pa. Super. 1988)\n     _(en bane).\n\f\u2022   \u2022\n\n\n\n\n        January 14, 1998. The Superior Court affirmed the denial on January 16, 1999, and the Supreme\n\n        Court denied allocatur on November 14, 1999.\n\n                 Petitioner filed three additional requests for post-conviction relief; all were unsuccessful.\n\n        The instant petition, his fourth, was filed on December 24, 2014, followed by twenty-one\n\n        supplemental filings before the court filed a 907 notice of intent to dismiss on May 23, 2017.\n\n        Petitioner thereafter filed a Response to the 907 notice on May 31, 2017. After a comprehensive\n\n        review of Petitioner's copious submissions, the court found all of his claims untimely, without\n\n        exception, and his habeas petition meritless. Therefore, the court dismissed the petition as untimely\n\n        and denied habeas corpus relief on July 17, 2017. On July 24, 2017, Petitioner filed a timely notice\n\n        of appeal to the Superior Court.\n\n           II.       DISCUSSION\n\n                 Petitioner's PCRA petition challenging the constitutionality of his sentence was facially\n\n        untimely. As a prefatory matter, the timeliness of a PCRA petition is a jurisdictional requisite.\n\n        Commonwealth v. Robinson, 12 A.3 d 4 77 (Pa. Super. 2011 ). A PCRA petition, including a second\n\n        or subsequent petition, shall be filed within one year of the date the underlying judgment becomes\n\n        final. 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 9545 (b)( 1 ). A judgment is deemed final \"at the conclusion of direct\n\n        review, including discretionary review in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme\n\n        Court of Pennsylvania, or at the expiration of time for seeking the review.\" Id. \u00a7 9545(b )(3).\n\n                 Petitioner's judgment of sentence became final on or about January 17, 1992, ninety days\n\n        after our Supreme Court denied his petition for allowance of appeal and the time for seeking a\n\n        petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court expired. See id. \u00a7 9545(b)(3);\n\n        U.S.Sup.Ct.R. 13 (\"a petition for a writ of certiorari to review a judgment in any case ... is timely\n\n        when it is filed with the Clerk of this Court within 90 days after entry of the judgment\"). A timely\n\n\n\n                                                            2\n\fPCRA petition would have been filed within one year of the judgement of sentencing becoming\n\nfinal. 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 954S(b)(l). His petition, filed on December 24, 2014 was therefore\n\nmanifestly untimely by over twenty-one (21) years.3\n\n        The three statutory exceptions to the timeliness provisions in the PCRA allow for very\n\nlimited circumstances under which the late filing of a petition will be excused. Id. To invoke an\n\nexception, a petition must allege and the petitioner must prove:\n\n        (i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of interference by government\n        officials with the presentation of the claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this\n        Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States;\n\n        (ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner and could\n        not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence; or\n\n        (iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was recognized by the Supreme Court                 of\n        the United States or the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in\n        this section and has been held by that court to apply retroactively.\n\nId \u00a7 9545(b )( 1 )(i)-(i ii).\n\n         In an effort to invoke the \"newly-recognized constitutional right\" statutory exception, 42\n\nPa. Cons. Stat.\u00a7 9545(b)(l)(iii), Petitioner presented the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision\n\nin Commonwealth v. Hopkins, 117 A.3d 247 (Pa. 2015) and the United States Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Alleyne v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2151 (2013). See PCRA petitions, 2/25/16 and\n\n5/24/16. Neither case, however, announced a new constitutional right that has been held to apply\n\nretroactively to untimely petitions on collateral review. See Commonwealth v. Washington, 142\n\nA.3d 810, 813-820 (addressing the retroactivity of Alleyne); see also Commonwealth v.\n\n\n3 The current version of the PCRA contains a provision permitting a defendant whose conviction became final prior\nto January 16, 1996, the date the current version of the PCRA took effect, to file a timely first PCRA petition within\none year of that date. See Commonwealth v. Alcorn. 703 A.2d 1054, 1056-57 (Pa. Super. 1997) (holding that where\na petitioner's judgment of sentence became final on or before the effective date of the amendment to the PCRA, the\namended PCRA contained a provision whereby a first PCRA petition could be filed by January 16, 1997, even if the\nconviction in question became final more than a year prior to the date of the filing). Petitioner's most recently tiled\nPCRA petition was neither his first nor was it filed within one year of the date the amendment took effect. His\npetition, therefore, did not qualify for this grace period.\n                                                           3\n\fWhitehawk, 146 A.3d 266, 271 (Pa. Super. 2016) (\"the Hopkins decision did not announce a 'new\n\nrule;' rather, the Court simply assessed the validity of section 6317 under Alleyne. . . . \").\n\nFurthermore, Petitioner failed to invoke either Alleyne or Hopkins within sixty days of the date\n\nthey were decided, namely June 17, 2013 and June 15, 2015 respectively. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\n\n9545(b )(2).\n\n        Petitioner additionally argued lack of statutory authority to support his life sentence due to\n\na procedural defect in 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 1102.4 Petitioner averred that his claim can be heard\n\npursuant to a \"newly recognized\" constitutional right and cited Welch v. United States, 136 S. Ct.\n\nI 257 (2016) and .Johnson v. United Stales, 13 5 S. Ct. 2551 (2016). s Petitioner was mistaken. Both\n\nthese cases altered the range of conduct or the class of persons that the Armed Career Criminal\n\nAct punishes, and Petitioner failed to cite to any authority holding that Welch and Johnson created\n\na new constitutional right that applied retroactively to grant relief to those convicted of murder\n\npursuant to Pennsylvania's murder statue.\n\n         Petitioner filed a number of filings structured in what appears to be a civil action. 6 In so far\n\nas Petitioner is attacking his conviction or sentence in order to obtain post-conviction relief, his\n\nclaims are untimely and he failed to invoke an exception. 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 9542 (stating PCRA\n\n\n4  Petitioner raised this claim in his tilings of6/22/16, 12/28/16, and 4/5/17 as well as his Response to the 907 Notice\nof 5/31/17. To the extent Petitioner endeavored to raise his Welch/Johnsons under the guise of a writ of habeas corpus,\nhis efforts were futile. These claims are cognizable under the PCRA and must be reviewed under the Act. See\nCommonwealth v. Peterkin, 722 A.2d 638, 640 (Pa. 1998); 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 6503(b) (\"Where a person is restrained\nby virtue of sentence after conviction for a criminal offense, the writ of habeas corpus shall not be available if a remedy\nbe had by post-conviction hearing proceedings authorized by law.\").\n5 In Welch, the United States Supreme Court, considering its prior holding in Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551\n\n(2015) that the imposition of an increased sentence under the federal Armed Career Criminal Act's residual clause\nviolated the defendant's due process rights, concluded that Johnson announced a new substantive rule that has\nretroactive effect on cases under collateral review. Welch, 136 S. Ct. 1257, 1295 (2016) (citation and quotation marks\nomitted). This ruling has not been held to grant collateral relief to those applying under Pennsylvania's PCRA statute.\nSee generally Commonwealth v. Washtngton, 142 A.3d 810, n. 11 (Pa. 2016) (declining to apply the reasoning of\n Welch and hold Alleyne retroactive to cases on collateral review).\n6 See Writ of Habeas Corpus, 12/24/14; Supplement to Writ of Habeas Corpus, 1/5/15, Pro se Correspondence,\n 1/15/15, Notice of Praecipe to Enter Default Judgment, 1/29/15; Writ of Mandamus, 1/29/15; Motion for Rule to Show\nCause, 3/9/15; Case Correspondence, 4/ 17/15; and Prose Correspondence, 4/23/15; Motion for Recusal, 5/12/ I 6.\n\n                                                             4\n\fshall be sole means of obtaining collateral relief and encompasses all other common law and\n\nstatutory remedies for same purpose); Commonwealth v. Gamboa-Taylor, 753 A.2d 780, 783 (Pa.\n\n2000) (\"As such, when a PCRA petition is not filed within one year of the expiration of direct\n\nreview, or not eligible for one of the three limited exceptions, or entitled to one of the exceptions,\n\nbut not filed within 60 days of the date that the claim could have been first brought, the trial court\n\nhas no power to address the substantive merits of a petitioner's PCRA claims.\")\n\n        The PCRA court did, however, evaluate Petitioner's claim raised in his writ of habeas\n\ncorpus claiming that the Department of Corrections (\"DOC\") lacked legal authority for his\n\ncontinued detention due to the lack of a written sentencing order, in contravention of 42 Pa. Cons.\n\nStat. \u00a7 9764(a)(8) and 37 Pa. Code\u00a7 91.3.7 See Joseph v. Glunt, 96 A.3d 365 (Pa. Super. 2014)\n\n(concluding that the PCRA did not subsume an illegal-sentence claim based on the inability of the\n\nDepartment of Corrections to produce a written sentencing order). A review of the record\n\nconfirmed that Petitioner was sentenced on November 21, 1988 by the Honorable Robert A.\n\nLatrone to a term of life imprisonment. A copy of the sentencing order is being maintained by the\n\nClerk of Courts of this court, and the docket reflects the pronouncement of sentence. Additionally,\n\nthe Superior Court has held that even in the absence of a written sentencing order, the DOC retains\n\ndetention authority. Id.\n\n        Petitioner's remaining claims interspersed throughout his various petitions can be broadly\n\ncategorized as raising various claims cognizable under the PCRA.8 Again, Petitioner has wholly\n\nfailed to invoke an exception, therefore depriving this court of jurisdiction. Commonwealth v.\n\n\n\n\n1Petitioner raised this claim, or its variation, in his filings of 1/29/15, 12/28/16, 4/S/17, and S/31/17.\n8See Writ of Habeas Corpus, 1/29/15 at 1-25, 63-73 {attacking the statutory authority for conviction and sentence);\nId at 49-62 (arguing the sentence of\"life\" is void for vagueness); Id at 74-85 (lack of jurisdiction); Writ of Habeas\nCorpus, 6/22/16 and Response to 907 Notice, 5/31 I 17 (asserting the sentencing statute for murder is unconstitutional);\nProse Correspondence, 2/ 13/17 (arguing he is subject to an illegal sentence).\n                                                           5\n\fJones, 932 A.2d 179, 182 (Pa. Super. 2007) (holding that where a petitioner files an untimely\n\nPCRA petition raising a legality of sentence claim, the jurisdictional limits of the PCRA render\n\nthe claim incapable of review); see also Commonwealth v. Chester, 895 A.2d 520, 524 (Pa. 2006)\n\n(courts have no jurisdiction to review the merits of an untimely PCRA petition).\n\n    III.      CONCLUSION\n\n           This court has once again evaluated an untimely collateral relief petition filed by Mr.\n\nStover. Petitioner's PCRA petition could not be considered because he failed to satisfy his burden\n\nof establishing an exception to the PCRA 's statutory time-bar. Furthermore, although falling\n\noutside the ambit of the PCRA, Petitioner's challenge to the legality of his detention due to the\n\nlack of sentencing order was meritless. Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein, the decision of\n\nthe court dismissing his untimely PCRA petition and denying habeas corpus relief should be\n\naffirmed.9\n\n                                                                             THE COURT,\n                                                                                                               ';\n\n\n\n\n9 Mr. Stover has a penchant for inundating this court with filings that can only be categorized as patently frivolous.\n His actions thwart the true purpose of the PCRA and waste the court's limited time and resources.\n\n                                                           6\n\f",
