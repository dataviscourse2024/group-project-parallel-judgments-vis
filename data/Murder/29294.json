There is nothing in the record to show that such motion was ever presented to the trial court or that he acted thereon. Since there is no order and no exception thereto, there is no informal hill of exception which can he considered under Article 760c, Vernon\u2019s Ann.C.C.P., and nothing is presented for review. Crawford v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 30S S.W.2d 362.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\n",
