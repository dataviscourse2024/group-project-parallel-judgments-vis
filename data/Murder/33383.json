The defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court delivered an unbalanced \"interested witness\u201d charge insofar as it instructed the jury that defendant may be considered an interested witness, but omitted to so charge with respect to the complainant (see, People v Brabham, 77 AD2d 626; People v Srbu, 51 AD2d 978) is unpreserved for our review and, in any event, is without merit. Gibbons, J. P., Weinstein, Lawrence and Eiber, JJ., concur.\n",
