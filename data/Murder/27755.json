For the following\n\nreasons, we affirm.\n\n                   I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n      Simpson was convicted of being in possession of a stolen black walnut\n\nlog from Joseph Chad Wheet\u2019s property on White Oak Church Road in Adair\n\nCounty, Kentucky. Evidence was introduced that the approximate value of the\n\n\n\n      1   Ky. Const. \u00a7 110(2)(b).\n\flog was between $1,700 and $3,000. In the spring of 2018, Wheet had entered\n\ninto an agreement with timber cutter Clifford Jasper to harvest black walnut\n\ntrees located near a creek on Wheet\u2019s property, and the two were to divide the\n\nproceeds equally. Because cutting trees next to a waterway is prohibited,\n\nJasper examined them with a forestry official who decided which trees he could\n\ncut and marked those trees with orange paint. In May 2018, Jasper cut the\n\ntrees marked with orange, yarded the logs in the adjacent fields, took bids, and\n\nfound a buyer.\n\n      On the morning of May 22, 2018, the logs were still in Wheet\u2019s field.\n\nThat day, Wheet traveled to Somerset to train for his job as a paramedic. While\n\nthere, Wheet received a phone call from his neighbor, Mike Schweppe, who\n\ninformed him that boys were dragging logs from his property up the road with a\n\nDodge truck and loading them onto a green flatbed trailer. Wheet and\n\nSchweppe exchange multiple phone calls that morning; during one call, Wheet\n\nsaid that Schweppe identified Simpson as the perpetrator. However, at trial,\n\nSchweppe denied saying this.\n\n      Wheet called the Adair County 911 center to report the theft, to which\n\nDeputy Aaron Rainwater and Sheriff Harrison Moss responded, arrivng at his\n\nhouse shortly thereafter. No one was there, and Deputy Rainwater saw no\n\nindication that a log had been dragged onto White Oak Church Road. However,\n\nonce they drove to intersecting Providence Road, Deputy Rainwater saw deep\n\ndrag marks in the road that indicated something had been dragged from\n\nWheet\u2019s field to the road and up a rise.\n\n                                           2\n\f      Wheet called Jasper, who went to his house and observed drag marks\n\nleading from a strip of dead grass \u2013 where one of the logs had been \u2013 up to\n\nProvidence Road. Jasper had not left those drag marks; he used a skidder to\n\nbear the weight of the logs and did not take any of them to Providence Road.\n\nJasper drove to a local sawmill and learned that no one had taken the stolen\n\nlog there. Jasper knew that nearby Wolford & Wethington Lumber also\n\npurchased black walnut logs at the time and believed that whoever stole the log\n\nwould probably take it there.\n\n      Information about the theft and Simpson\u2019s likely destination was relayed\n\nto law enforcement agencies in adjacent Casey County. Deputy Jeffrey Brown\n\nwaited off Route 127 for Simpson and stopped his vehicle - a Dodge pickup\n\ntruck pulling a green utility trailer with a single log on it. Simpson\u2019s license\n\nplate was expired, his operator\u2019s license was suspended, and he had no\n\nregistration receipt or proof of insurance. He told Deputy Brown that he had\n\ncut the log on his friend Stacy\u2019s farm in Adair County and asserted that he was\n\nin lawful possession of it. He did not know Stacy\u2019s last name.\n\n      Deputy Rainwater and Sheriff Moss went to the location of the traffic\n\nstop; Wheet and Jasper arrived separately. Keith Wolford, of Wolford &\n\nWethington Lumber, was previously notified by Jasper to watch for the log.\n\nWhen Wolford heard about the nearby stop he went there to see if it was\n\nSimpson \u2013 who had recently asked him what a black walnut would be worth.\n\nJasper identified the log on the trailer by the orange marking he had made,\n\nwhich Deputy Rainwater testified he observed, along with markings on the log\n\n                                         3\n\fwhere it had been dragged up the road. Though the bark was gone from\n\nhaving been dragged, orange paint remained in the crevices. Deputy Brown\n\narrested Simpson for the motor vehicle offenses, as well as for receiving stolen\n\nproperty, and released the log to Wheet at the scene. Wheet then sold the log\n\nto a buyer shortly thereafter.\n\n      Before trial, Simpson moved to dismiss the indictment or, in the\n\nalternative, to exclude Wheet\u2019s testimony in its entirety. Simpson argued that\n\nthe log was improperly released from state custody to Wheet, in violation of\n\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and that the photographs Wheet took\n\nof the log showing the orange markings were taken in a field after the log was\n\nreleased from custody, thus calling into question whether the log he\n\nphotographed was the log at issue. Simpson emphasized that the photos taken\n\nby the officers at the traffic stop did not show any orange markings on the log,\n\nthereby making Wheet\u2019s photographs of the log showing the orange markings\n\neven more prejudicial. The trial court denied both of Simpson\u2019s motions. A\n\none-day jury trial was held; at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief,\n\nSimpson renewed his motion to dismiss the indictment, as well as moved for a\n\ndirected verdict on the charge of receiving stolen property over $500. Again,\n\nthe trial court denied his motions.\n\n      The jury convicted Simpson of receiving stolen property valued at $500\n\nor more (a class D felony), and multiple motor vehicle offenses (having no\n\nregistration receipt, having no registration plate, failure to maintain insurance,\n\ndriving on a DUI suspended license). During the penalty phase, the\n\n                                        4\n\fCommonwealth introduced evidence that Simpson had been previously\n\nconvicted of second-degree manslaughter, second-degree assault, first-degree\n\nwanton endangerment, driving under the influence in Russell County, burglary\n\nand three counts of theft by unlawful taking in Georgia, burglary of a\n\nconveyance in Florida, and two counts of burglary of a dwelling in Florida. The\n\njury determined Simpson was a PFO-1 and fixed his punishment at five years,\n\nenhanced to twenty years by virtue of his PFO-1 status. Simpson moved for a\n\nnew trial, which the trial court denied. This appeal followed.\n\n                                        II. ANALYSIS\n\n   A. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Wheet to\n      testify, in admitting his photographs of the log, and in allowing the\n      911 dispatch call to be played for the jury.\n\n      Simpson argues that the trial court should have dismissed the\n\nindictment against him or, alternatively, should have excluded Wheet\u2019s\n\ntestimony, including the photographs Wheet took of the log, his mobile cell\n\nphone records, and the recording of the 911 dispatch call. Simpson claims\n\nthat under the \u201cbest evidence rule\u201d the Commonwealth was required to\n\nintroduce the most authentic evidence which was within its power to present,\n\nwhich was the log itself. Savage v. Three Rivers Med. Ctr., 390 S.W.3d 104, 114\n\n(Ky. 2012); KRE2 1002 (providing that \u201c[t]o prove the content of a writing,\n\nrecording, or photograph [e.g. an x-ray], the original writing, recording, or\n\nphotograph is required, except as otherwise provided in these rules, in other\n\n\n\n\n      2   Kentucky Rules of Evidence.\n\n                                            5\n\frules adopted by the Kentucky Supreme Court, or by statute[]\u201d). Simpson\n\nfurther argues that the officers\u2019 failure to preserve the log as evidence was a\n\nBrady violation, warranting dismissal of the indictment or exclusion of Wheet\u2019s\n\ntestimony and photographs.3\n\n       In his motion to exclude, Simpson specifically argued that Wheet had no\n\npersonal knowledge of the matters to which he would testify, as required by\n\nKRE 602; the expert testimony exception in KRE 703 did not apply; his\n\ntestimony would violate the hearsay prohibitions in KRE 802 and 805; and he\n\nwould be unable to authenticate his mobile phone log, thus running afoul of\n\nKRE 901(a). Simpson avers that the call log should have been authenticated\n\nby the custodian of the business records under KRE 902(11) and that its\n\nadmission was highly prejudicial, as it bolstered Wheet\u2019s testimony and\n\nimpeached Schweppe\u2019s testimony, given that the two of them disagreed on who\n\nmade the first phone call the morning of May 22, 2018.4\n\n\n\n       3 Simpson further asserts that the trial court should have instructed the jury on\nmissing evidence, however, the record shows he did not request such an instruction.\nAccordingly, RCr 9.54(2) forecloses our review of this claimed error. See Martin v.\nCommonwealth, 409 S.W.3d 340, 345 (Ky. 2013) (\u201cRCr 9.54(2) bars palpable error\nreview for unpreserved claims that the trial court erred in the giving or failure to give a\nspecific instruction[]\u201d).\n       4Simpson also argues now for the first time that the 911 dispatch recording\nshould have been excluded since it contained inadmissible hearsay. However, the\nrecord shows that defense counsel not only failed to object to the introduction of the\n911 dispatch call, but rather insisted on playing the recording in its entirety. Given\ncounsel\u2019s waiver, we will not address this claim of error on appeal. See Tackett v.\nCommonwealth, 445 S.W.3d 20, 29 (Ky. 2014) (\u201c A party cannot ask a trial court to do\nsomething and, when the court does it, complain on appeal that the court erred. . . .\nWhen, as here, a party not only forfeits an error by failing to object to the admission of\nevidence, but specifically waives any objection, the party cannot complain on appeal\nthat the court erroneously admitted that evidence[]\u201d). See also Jefferson v. Eggemeyer,\n516 S.W.3d 325, 339\u201340 (Ky. 2017) (\u201cAn appellant may not \u2018feed one can of worms to\n                                            6\n\f      This Court reviews evidentiary rulings on the admission or exclusion of\n\nevidence for an abuse of discretion. Baker v. Commonwealth, 545 S.W.3d 267,\n\n275 (Ky. 2018). \u201c\u2018The test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial judge\u2019s\n\ndecision was arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair, or unsupported by sound legal\n\nprinciples.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Commonwealth. v. English, 993 S.W.2d 941, 945 (Ky.\n\n1999)).\n\n      Regarding Simpson\u2019s alleged Brady violation, the law is clear that the\n\nintentional destruction of exculpatory evidence by the Commonwealth is a Due\n\nProcess violation requiring \u201c(1) dismissal, (2) exclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s\n\nevidence, or (3) an instruction permitting the jury to infer that the missing\n\nevidence, if available, would be adverse to the Commonwealth and favorable to\n\nthe defendant.\u201d Estep v. Commonwealth, 64 S.W.3d 805, 809 (Ky. 2002). The\n\nDue Process Clause is implicated when the Commonwealth destroys or loses\n\nexculpatory evidence, the potentially exculpatory nature of that evidence was\n\napparent when it was lost or destroyed, and the Commonwealth acted in bad\n\nfaith. Id. (citing Collins v. Commonwealth, 951 S.W.2d 569, 572 (Ky. 1997)). If\n\na due process violation occurs,\n\n      dismissal is only one of several remedies available for such\n      violations. See, e.g., Sanborn v. Commonwealth, 754 S.W.2d 534,\n      540 (Ky. 1988). Other remedies, such as exclusion of evidence or a\n      missing-evidence instruction to the jury, may be appropriate\n      depending on the facts. Id. In fact, our law appears to express a\n      preference for missing-evidence instructions, which are used \u201cto\n      cure any Due Process violation attributable to the loss or\n      destruction of exculpatory evidence by a less onerous remedy than\n      dismissal or the suppression of relevant evidence.\u201d Estep v.\n\nthe trial judge and another to the appellate court[]\u2019\u201d) (internal quotations and citation\nomitted).\n                                            7\n\f      Commonwealth, 64 S.W.3d 805, 810 (Ky. 2002).\n\nSwan v. Commonwealth, 384 S.W.3d 77, 91\u201392 (Ky. 2012). This Court has\n\nexplained,\n\n      In Brady, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe\n      suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused\n      upon request violates due process where the evidence is material\n      either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or\n      bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10\n      L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). In Arizona v. Youngblood, the Supreme Court\n      clarified what a defendant must prove when the government fails\n      to collect or preserve evidence, holding, \u201cunless a criminal\n      defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to\n      preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of\n      due process of law.\u201d 488 U.S. 51, 58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d\n      281 (1988). In other words, government culpability is irrelevant\n      when the Commonwealth withholds plainly exculpatory evidence,\n      but when the Commonwealth merely fails to collect or preserve\n      evidence, as in the case here, the defendant must prove bad faith.\n      When this Court adopted Youngblood, we added that \u201cnegligence\n      simply does not rise to the level of bad faith....\u201d Collins v.\n      Commonwealth, 951 S.W.2d 569, 573 (Ky. 1997).\n\nCommonwealth v. Parrish, 471 S.W.3d 694, 697 (Ky. 2015).\n\n      Prior to trial, the court denied Simpson\u2019s motions to dismiss and exclude.\n\nAt trial, Simpson renewed his objection to Wheet\u2019s testimony, including\n\nintroduction of the photographs he took. During the bench conference that\n\nfollowed, the parties did not discuss any case law or rules of evidence; Simpson\n\nsimply argued that it could not be proven that Wheet photographed the log in\n\nquestion, since the pictures were taken in a field, after the log was released\n\nfrom state custody. In response, the Commonwealth maintained that Wheet\n\ntook the pictures, he would testify to such and therefore they were admissible,\n\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\fand that Simpson could cross examine him concerning any authenticity issues\n\nhe had. The trial court overruled Simpson\u2019s objection.\n\n      On appeal, the parties dispute whether the log was exculpatory or\n\ninculpatory evidence. The Commonwealth argues that the orange marking on\n\nthe log, as shown in Wheet\u2019s photographs and identified at the scene by\n\nJasper, proves that the log came from Wheet\u2019s property. Conversely, Simpson\n\nasserts that the identity and source of the log was crucial to the\n\nCommonwealth\u2019s case, and to his defense, and would have exonerated him. He\n\npoints out that even if he had photos of a stump or other evidence that a\n\nwalnut log had been cut from Stacy\u2019s property, as he claims he did, due to the\n\nCommonwealth\u2019s release of the log from custody, no log exists for a forester or\n\ntimber expert to compare.\n\n      To show a Brady violation, a party must establish bad faith on the part\n\nof the government. Here, the record contains no allegation or proof of official\n\nanimus toward Simpson or of a conscious effort to suppress exculpatory\n\nevidence. While the officers\u2019 failure to preserve the log as evidence may have\n\nbeen negligent, Simpson has failed to establish that their conduct rose to the\n\nlevel of bad faith. Rather, it appears the consensus at the traffic stop was that\n\nthe log belonged to Wheet, so officials released it to him.\n\n      Furthermore, a review of the record shows that Simpson extensively\n\ncross-examined Wheet concerning his photographs of the log - presenting the\n\npolice photos of all sides of the log, and getting Wheet to admit no orange\n\nmarkings appeared on the log in the police photos. On re-direct, the\n\n                                         9\n\fCommonwealth elicited testimony from Wheet that he texted Schweppe a\n\npicture from the traffic stop, which had Simpson in it, and that Schweppe\n\nidentified him as the person who stole the log. During Deputy Rainwater\u2019s\n\ntestimony, he identified the log and its distinct orange marking from Wheet\u2019s\n\nphotographs. At this point, determining the weight and credibility of the\n\ntestimony fell in the jury\u2019s hands. Commonwealth v. James, 586 S.W.3d 717,\n\n721 (Ky. 2019) (citing Commonwealth v. Benham, 816 S.W.2d 186, 187 (Ky.\n\n1991) (judging the credibility of a witness and the weight to be given the\n\nwitness\u2019s testimony are purely jury functions)). We have long-recognized that\n\nin the exercise of these functions, the jury, as finders of fact, were entitled to\n\nbelieve all or part of any witness\u2019s testimony and to discount other parts.\n\nGillispie v. Commonwealth, 212 Ky. 472, 474, 279 S.W. 671, 672 (1926).\n\nMoreover, the law is clear that \u201cthe Commonwealth may prove its case by direct\n\nor circumstantial evidence. James, 586 S.W.3d at 721. Here, despite the log\n\nnot being preserved as evidence, the jury could have made reasonable\n\ninferences from the presented evidence sufficient to sustain Simpson\u2019s\n\nconviction.5\n\n\n\n\n      5 Simpson mentioned the best evidence rule in his motion to dismiss\nindictment, without citing any case law in support, and wholly failed to discuss the\nissue on appeal. That said, we note that the best evidence rule largely pertains to\ndocumentary evidence, not physical evidence. See Marcum v. Commonwealth, 390\nS.W.2d 884, 886 (Ky. 1965) (holding that the best evidence rule \u201crequires one to\nintroduce the most authentic evidence which is within the power of one to produce,\nbut in practical application it applies almost exclusively to documentary evidence. It\nis concerned with the content of a written instrument[]\u201d) (citations omitted).\n\n\n                                          10\n\f      Simpson next challenges Wheet\u2019s testimony with respect to his account\n\nof his phone calls with Schewppe the morning of May 22, 2018 and the\n\nintroduction of Wheet\u2019s mobile phone log from that day into evidence. Wheet\n\ntestified that he received a call about logs being taken from his property on the\n\nmorning of May 22, 2018. Initially, he did not know the identity of the caller,\n\nbut the caller later identified himself in a subsequent call as Schweppe, and\n\nsaid Simpson was the one taking the log but told Wheet that he did not want to\n\nbecome involved in the matter any further.6 Wheet\u2019s testimony impeached\n\nSchweppe\u2019s, who testified that Wheet was the one who called him first that\n\nmorning and who denied having identified Simpson as the perpetrator. When\n\npresented with the Ebill of Wheet\u2019s mobile phone record, Schweppe confirmed\n\nhis mobile phone number was on that log. During Wheet\u2019s testimony, he\n\nauthenticated the Ebill, confirmed his own number, stated that the phone bill\n\nwas in his ex-wife\u2019s name, she printed the bill for him, and it looked like a fair\n\nand accurate representation of his phone bill. The phone log showed that\n\nWheet received a call from Schweppe first that morning.\n\n      Before presenting Wheet\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth elicited\n\ntestimony from Schweppe that Wheet called him first that morning. Schweppe\n\nalso denied identifying Simpson as the perpetrator. With that KRE 613(a)7\n\n\n      6During his testimony, Schweppe revealed that he was good friends with\nSimpson\u2019s father, that Simpson was dating his niece, and that he, Schweppe, put up a\n$5,000 cash bond to get Simpson out of jail following his arrest.\n      7   KRE 613 provides in part:\n      (a) Examining witness concerning prior statement. Before other evidence\n      can be offered of the witness having made at another time a different\n                                        11\n\ffoundation, Wheet\u2019s testimony about Schweppe\u2019s prior statements was\n\nadmissible under KRE 801A(a)(1)8 as a hearsay exception for prior inconsistent\n\nstatements. As a result, the jury\u2019s province was to weigh the testimony and\n\nevaluate the credibility of the witnesses.\n\n      Regarding the trial court\u2019s admission of Wheet\u2019s mobile phone log, the\n\nlaw is clear that \u201c[a]uthentication is a foundational requirement or condition\n\nprecedent to admissibility. Before evidence may be admitted, there must be\n\n\u2018evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its\n\nproponent claims.\u2019\u201d Hall v. Commonwealth, 468 S.W.3d 814, 831 (Ky. 2015)\n\n(quoting KRE 901(a)). \u201cThe burden on the proponent of authentication is\n\nslight; only a prima facie showing of authenticity is required. . . . This means of\n\ncourse that the trial judge decides only if the evidence can be admitted and the\n\ntrier of fact determines the authenticity of the evidence and its probative force.\u201d\n\nId. (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n      statement, he must be inquired of concerning it, with the circumstances\n      of time, place, and persons present, as correctly as the examining party\n      can present them; and, if it be in writing, it must be shown to the\n      witness, with opportunity to explain it. The court may allow such\n      evidence to be introduced when it is impossible to comply with this rule\n      because of the absence at the trial or hearing of the witness sought to be\n      contradicted, and when the court finds that the impeaching party has\n      acted in good faith.\n      8   KRE 801A(a)(1) provides in part:\n      (a) Prior statements of witnesses. A statement is not excluded by the\n      hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness, if the\n      declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is examined concerning the\n      statement, with a foundation laid as required by KRE 613, and the\n      statement is: (1) Inconsistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony[.]\n                                             12\n\f      Simpson does not allege that the mobile phone record was hearsay, he\n\nsimply claims the custodian of the record (Wheet\u2019s ex-wife, Kasey) should have\n\nauthenticated the EBill pursuant to KRE 902(11) since the phone was in her\n\nname and she printed the call log for Wheet. Simpson cites no case law in\n\nsupport of his assertion. Looking to the rules of evidence as guidance, KRE\n\n902(11) provides, in relevant part:\n\n      Extrinsic evidence of authenticity as a condition precedent to\n      admissibility is not required with respect to the following:\n\n      ***\n\n      (11) Business records.\n\n      (A)    Unless the sources of information or other circumstances\n      indicate lack of trustworthiness, the original or a duplicate of a\n      record of regularly conducted activity within the scope of KRE\n      803(6) or KRE 803(7), which the custodian thereof certifies:\n\n            (i)  Was made, at or near the time of the occurrence of the\n            matters set forth, by (or from information transmitted by) a\n            person with knowledge of those matters;\n            (ii)   Is kept in the course of the regularly conducted\n            activity; and\n            (iii) Was made by the regularly conducted activity as a\n            regular practice.\n\n      KRE 901 sets forth methods of authentication, providing in part that\n\n\u201c[t]he requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent\n\nto admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the\n\nmatter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d KRE 901(a). Under KRE\n\n901(b)(1), a witness with knowledge may testify to this. And under KRE\n\n901(b)(4), \u201c[a]ppearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\fdistinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances\u201d may be\n\nused to authenticate an item.\n\n      Here, Wheet had first-hand knowledge of his mobile phone\n\ncommunications on May 22, 2018. Wheet identified his phone number and\n\nrecognized the mobile phone bill itself, which he said was a fair and accurate\n\ndepiction of the Ebill. Wheet explained that in May 2018, the phone was\n\nregistered in his then wife\u2019s name, and she printed the bill for him. He also\n\nidentified Schweppe\u2019s phone number and a number of other numbers on the\n\ncall log, including the call he made to the Adair County 911 center on May 22,\n\n2018. Under KRE 901(a), Wheet\u2019s testimony, in conjunction with the\n\nappearance of the phone bill itself, sufficiently authenticated the record.\n\nSimpson has not alleged hearsay or any lack of trustworthiness with respect to\n\nthe Ebill itself, other than it should have been introduced through Kasey,\n\nrather than Wheet. Based on the lack of any issues with respect to the\n\ntrustworthiness of the document, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nallowing the mobile call log to be admitted into evidence through Wheet.\n\n   B. Improper juror contact with the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses did not\n      constitute palpable error.\n\n      Prior to the jury being discharged (and before the penalty phase),\n\nSimpson brought two instances of alleged juror misconduct to the trial court\u2019s\n\nattention, claiming that those jurors had ignored the court\u2019s admonition not to\n\nspeak with witnesses. Simpson suggests that the trial court should have sua\n\nsponte granted a mistrial, but admits he did not request one, or any other relief\n\nfrom the trial court. Accordingly, he asks us to review his claim for palpable\n                                        14\n\ferror. See Cash v. Commonwealth, 892 S.W.2d 292, 295 (Ky. 1995) (per RCr\n\n9.22, a party is required to make \u201cknown to the court the action he desires the\n\ncourt to take or his objection to the action of the court\u201d and failure to do so\n\nrenders an error unpreserved). Notwithstanding the contemporaneous\n\nobjection rule embodied in RCr 9.22, this Court can consider a \u201cpalpable error\u201d\n\nwhich affects the \u201csubstantial rights\u201d of a defendant even though the error was\n\ninsufficiently raised or preserved before the trial court.9 Id.\n\n       Simpson contends that palpable error occurred since no more\n\nrecognizable right of a defendant exists than the right to be tried before a fair\n\nand impartial jury. Both Section 11 of the Kentucky Constitution and the\n\nSixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantee an accused the\n\nright to a speedy and public trial \u201cby an impartial jury.\u201d Simpson cites to\n\nKRS10 29A.310(2), affirming this right: \u201cNo officer, party, or witness to an\n\naction pending, or his attorney or attorneys shall, without leave of the court,\n\nconverse with the jury or any member thereof upon any subject after they have\n\nbeen sworn.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n       9  RCr 10.26 provides: \u201cA palpable error which affects the substantial rights of a\nparty may be considered . . . by an appellate court on appeal, even though\ninsufficiently raised or preserved for review, and appropriate relief may be granted\nupon a determination that manifest injustice has resulted from the error.\u201d \u201cPalpable\nerror relief is available under RCr 10.26 only upon a determination that manifest\ninjustice has resulted from the error. Manifest injustice is error [that] so seriously\naffect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceeding as to be shocking\nor jurisprudentially intolerable.\u201d Davidson v. Commonwealth, 548 S.W.3d 255, 261\n(Ky. 2018) (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n       10   Kentucky Revised Statutes.\n\n                                            15\n\f      This Court has distinguished between innocent conversations in which\n\nmatters of substance are not involved and conversations which prejudice the\n\ndefendant to the extent he is deprived of a fair trial. Oro-Jimenez v.\n\nCommonwealth, 412 S.W.3d 174, 180\u201381 (Ky. 2013).\n\n      The true test is whether the misconduct has prejudiced the\n      defendant to the extent that he has not received a fair trial.\n      Kentucky courts have generally drawn a bright line between\n      conversations between jurors and witnesses about the case and\n      those which are about unrelated matters. The former prejudice the\n      defendant, whereas the latter are harmless.\n\nId. at 181 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\n      Simpson\u2019s first alleged instance of juror misconduct concerns a juror\n\nwho had a conversation with Detective Dennis Allen during one of the breaks.\n\nWhen questioned by the trial court about this encounter, the juror stated that\n\nhe thought he recognized Det. Allen and as he was walking out the courtroom\n\ndoor, he commented to him that he thought he knew him. That was the extent\n\nof their interaction. Det. Allen did not testify during the trial but was\n\nintroduced to the jury at the beginning of the trial while being seated at the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s table. Nevertheless, the trial court\u2019s questioning of this juror\n\nrevealed that the juror did not discuss this case or any case-related matter\n\nwith Det. Allen and did not intentionally fail to disclose during voir dire a\n\nconnection of which the juror was aware. Rather, the juror simply realized he\n\nmay know Det. Allen and sought to confirm it. At this point, the trial court\n\nasked counsel if \u201cwe were good\u201d to which they both responded affirmatively.\n\nDefense counsel requested no further relief.\n\n\n\n                                        16\n\f      While the contact between Det. Allen and this juror violated KRS\n\n29A.310(2), the interaction was harmless and certainly did not rise to the level\n\nof palpable error. See id. (Although violative of KRS 29A.310(2), the\n\nconversation between a juror and a witness was innocent, was not calculated\n\nby either the juror or the witness to corrupt the proceeding in any way, it\n\ninvolved no improper exchange of information material to the case, nor did it\n\notherwise reveal the presence of an improper influence that might have affected\n\nthe verdict.); Talbott v. Commonwealth, 968 S.W.2d 76, 86 (Ky. 1998) (While\n\nthree jurors engaged in separate conversations with a witness for the\n\nCommonwealth (the sheriff) during trial recesses in violation of KRS\n\n29A.310(2), none of the conversations related to the trial and were found to be\n\nharmless.)\n\n      Simpson\u2019s second instance of alleged juror misconduct was also\n\nharmless error. In that instance, a spectator observed one of the jurors\n\ninteracting with Deputy Rainwater on the elevator. This spectator informed the\n\ncourt that the juror was already on the elevator and held the door for Deputy\n\nRainwater, insisting that he join him on the elevator. Deputy Rainwater did,\n\nand the juror, who is a constable, asked Deputy Rainwater if he knew an\n\nindividual who lived in Danville, Kentucky. Deputy Rainwater responded that\n\nhe did. The spectator did not hear the two discuss anything related to this\n\ncase. When this juror was questioned by the court about this encounter, the\n\njuror admitted discussing with Deputy Rainwater an individual the juror was\n\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\flooking for who had warrants for his arrest. The juror denied discussing the\n\ncase at bar with Deputy Rainwater.\n\n      Simpson maintains that this juror\u2019s contact with Deputy Rainwater\n\n\u201camounts to a cooperative effort between a juror and an officer\u201d and exhibits a\n\nhigh level of prejudice which affected his right to an impartial jury. Again,\n\nwhile this contact violated KRS 29A.310(2), the brief conversation was\n\nharmless and did not amount to palpable error. No mistrial was requested,\n\nand none was warranted.\n\n   C. Simpson was not entitled to a directed verdict.\n\n      At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, Simpson moved for a\n\ndirected verdict on the charge of receiving stolen property over $500.\n\n      When reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a directed verdict,\n\n      On motion for directed verdict, the trial court must draw all fair\n      and reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the\n      Commonwealth. If the evidence is sufficient to induce a reasonable\n      juror to believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is\n      guilty, a directed verdict should not be given. For the purpose of\n      ruling on the motion, the trial court must assume that the\n      evidence for the Commonwealth is true, but reserving to the jury\n      questions as to the credibility and weight to be given to such\n      testimony.\n\n             On appellate review, we must determine whether, given the\n      evidence as a whole, it would be clearly unreasonable for a jury to\n      find guilt. Only then is a defendant entitled to a directed verdict of\n      acquittal. Further, the Commonwealth need only produce more\n      than a \u201cmere scintilla\u201d of evidence to defeat a defendant's motion\n      for a directed verdict.\n\nJames, 586 S.W.3d at 721 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\n      Simpson maintains that a directed verdict in his favor was merited\n\nbecause the Commonwealth relied on circumstantial evidence and hearsay to\n                                        18\n\festablish its case. However, as we have discussed, a conviction may be\n\nsustained on circumstantial evidence alone. We also have found no merit in\n\nSimpson\u2019s claims of error with respect to the evidentiary issues he raises.\n\n      Further, the evidence was sufficient to send the case to the jury. At\n\nSimpson\u2019s traffic stop, Jasper identified the log as being one he cut from\n\nWheet\u2019s property and pointed out the orange marking. At trial, Deputy\n\nRainwater corroborated Jasper\u2019s identification of the orange marking on the log\n\nduring the traffic stop. The evidence also showed that neither Wheet nor\n\nJasper gave Simpson permission to be in possession of the log. Wheet testified\n\nthat Schweppe called him the morning of May 22 to report the theft, from an\n\nindividual driving a Dodge pickup truck and green trailer and said that\n\nSchweppe identified Simpson as the perpetrator. Schweppe\u2019s phone number\n\nappeared on Wheet\u2019s mobile call log from that day. Lastly, Simpson was pulled\n\nover in a Dodge pickup truck hauling a mostly green trailer with a black walnut\n\nlog on it, and heading in the direction of Wolford & Wethington Lumber, from\n\nwhom Simpson had recently inquired as to the value of a black walnut log.\n\nThe value of the black walnut log was estimated to exceed $500. Based on this\n\nevidence, it would not have been clearly unreasonable for a jury to convict\n\nSimpson of receiving stolen property over $500. Therefore, the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in denying Simpson\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.\n\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\f                                 III.   CONCLUSION\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment and sentence of the Casey\n\nCircuit Court is affirmed.\n\n      All sitting.
