The facts show, from the State's standpoint, that appellant was standing by a road with a shot gun in his hand when Mr. Hare passed by with his wife and child in a car. After they had passed appellant discharged his gun and both Mrs. Hare and the child were struck by the shot. Appellant claimed he was shooting at a bird. The charge of the court submitted the issues of law in a manner so satisfactory to appellant that he took no exception thereto. We think the facts sufficient to justify the verdict and judgment.\nNo error appearing, the judgment will be affirmed.\nAffirmed.",
