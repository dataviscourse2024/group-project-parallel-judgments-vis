NATHANIEL RICHARDSON\n\n                    Appeal from the Criminal Court for Shelby County\n                      No. 05-04653 James M. Lammey, Jr., Judge\n\n\n\n                 No. W2008-01652-CCA-R3-CD - Filed February 11, 2010\n\n\nAppellant, Nathaniel Richardson, pled guilty to second degree murder in Shelby County and\nreceived a twenty-year sentence. At the guilty plea hearing, Appellant reserved the following\ncertified questions of law for appeal pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2) of the Tennessee Rules of\nCriminal Procedure:\n\n       1) Whether the trial court erred by denying [Appellant\u2019s] motion to suppress\n       all the evidence taken from the trunk of the car that was seized by the police\n       on September 13, 2004? Whether the seizure of the car from the parking lot\n       where [Appellant] worked in the absence of a search warrant violated the U.S.\n       Const. amend. IV and amend. XIV and Art. 1 \u00a7 7 and \u00a7 8 of the Tennessee\n       Constitution and in violation of Rule 41 of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal\n       Procedure; thereby[ ] requiring that the evidence taken from the trunk be\n       suppressed? A search warrant was later signed on September 15, 2004[,] and\n       the vehicle was searched.\n\n       2) Whether the trial court erred by determining that [Appellant] was legally\n       competent to stand trial.\n\nWe determine that the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress where officers had\nprobable cause to seize Appellant\u2019s car. We decline to address Appellant\u2019s remaining\narguments regarding his statements to police, detention by police, and validity of the search\nwarrant as they were not presented in the certified questions presented. Further, we\ndetermine that the issue regarding Appellant\u2019s competency is not dispositive and, therefore,\nnot a proper certified question. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n     Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Trial Court is Affirmed.\n\fJ ERRY L. S MITH, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which J OHN E VERETT W ILLIAMS and\nC AMILLE R. M CM ULLEN, JJ., joined.\n\nPhyllis Aluko, Assistant Public Defender, Memphis, Tennessee, for the appellant, Nathaniel\nRichardson.\n\nRobert E. Cooper, Jr., Attorney General and Reporter; Rachel W. Willis, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral; William L. Gibbons, District Attorney General; and David Zak, Assistant District\nAttorney General; for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                                   OPINION\n\n        Appellant was indicted for first degree murder by the Shelby County Grand Jury on\nJuly 14, 2005. Appellant subsequently filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized as a\nresult of the \u201cunlawful\u201d search of a Chevrolet Lumina because no warrant existed at the time\nthe vehicle was seized, the officer who was issued a subsequent search warrant was not\npresent at the search and did not secure any of the collected items, there was no copy of the\nwarrant at the site of the search, and the car was stored in a location that was not secure and\nsafe from outside tampering. The trial court held a hearing on the motion to suppress.\n\n       At the hearing, Sergeant Anthony Mullins testified that he was assigned to investigate\nthe death of Kenneth Miller, Jr. The victim\u2019s body was found in a vacant house in Memphis\non September 9, 2004. The victim had been stabbed multiple times before being set on fire.\n\n\n       Sergeant Mullins explained that during the investigation, he learned that Appellant\nwas the last person to be seen with Miller while the victim was alive. Appellant gave Miller\na ride in a white Chevrolet Lumina the night before Miller\u2019s body was discovered. On\nSeptember 13, 2004, Sergeant Mullins and his partner, Sergeant Doreen Shelton,1 located\nAppellant at his place of employment, Super Value grocery store. A white Chevrolet Lumina\nwas parked in the front of the store.\n\n        Appellant agreed to cooperate with authorities and went with Sergeants Mullins and\nShelton to the police department to discuss the case. Appellant was advised of his Miranda\nrights and signed a waiver. During the discussions, Appellant informed the officers that he\npossessed an eleventh grade education. The officers, however, determined that Appellant\nhad difficulty reading some of the advice of rights form, so the form was read aloud to\n\n\n         1\n          Sergeant Shelton was later promoted to Lieutenant. For the sake of clarity, we will refer to her as Sergeant\nShelton, her status at the time of the proceedings herein.\n\n                                                         -2-\n\fAppellant. The interview lasted approximately six hours, during which Appellant was\noffered food and drink. Appellant refused these offers but requested and received a\nbathroom break.\n\n        Appellant gave a statement in which he admitted that he gave Miller a ride in his\nChevrolet Lumina for one or two blocks. At that time, the victim got out of the car and got\ninto another car with two black men. Appellant was not under arrest at the time he gave the\nstatement but during the course of the interview, Sergeant Mullins decided to arrest\nAppellant and place him under arrest on a \u201c48-hour hold\u201d based on the fact that he admitted\nto giving Miller a ride and was the last person seen with Miller alive. Sergeant Mullins also\nfelt that Appellant was \u201cvague\u201d on some of the details and went \u201cback and forth in his\nexplanation of what happened\u201d as far as whether Miller was going to give Appellant money\nin exchange for the ride and the amount of money he would provide to Appellant for the ride.\n\n\n        Sergeant Mullins left the police station at one point during the interview to take a look\nat Appellant\u2019s car. Sergeant Mullins suspected that Appellant\u2019s car had been used to\ntransport the victim\u2019s body because they had determined in the course of the investigation\nthat the victim was not killed at the location where the body was found. Appellant gave the\nkeys to the car to Sergeant Mullins when he was told that the car would be towed. Sergeant\nMullins looked in the windows but could not see everything inside the car because \u201c[t]here\nwas some clothing or something that was obstructing the rear seat and floorboard of the car.\u201d\nSergeant Mullins decided to tow the car because he \u201ccould not see everything in that\ncompartment.\u201d\n\n        During the interview, Appellant indicated that other people had access to the car. The\ncar was actually registered to someone other than Appellant and \u201canother individual had\nreceived a ticket in that vehicle.\u201d Out of concern of preserving evidence, the car was towed\nto the crime scene office, a garage-like facility within a larger building.\n\n        Appellant was released from arrest at the expiration of the forty-eight hour hold, prior\nto the issuance or execution of the search warrant.\n\n        A search warrant was issued on September 15, 2004. Sergeant Mullins directed\nforensic scientist Paulette Sutton and Sergeant Shelton to begin the search of the vehicle in\nhis absence. Sergeant Mullins appeared at the scene of the search about thirty minutes after\nthe search began. He saw the evidence that was recovered from the trunk of the car, which\nincluded: a knife with a serrated blade, a box cutter, a white t-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, a red\nplastic gasoline container, and a piece of paper with burn marks on it. When lab reports\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\findicated that the victim\u2019s blood was on the t-shirt and jeans found in Appellant\u2019s car, he was\nre-arrested and ultimately indicted for the victim\u2019s death.\n\n       The trial court denied the motion to suppress at the conclusion of the hearing. The\ntranscript reflects the trial judge\u2019s decision to deny the motion to suppress, although the\nappellate record contains no entry of an order denying the suppression motion. Specifically,\nthe trial court ruled that the seizure of the car was \u201creasonable under the [F]ourth\n[A]mendment\u201d and was based on probable cause. The trial court found that the officers had\nevidence that Appellant was the last person seen with the victim while he was alive and\nsuspected that the victim had been transported in Appellant\u2019s car from the murder site to the\nlocation where the body was found. Further, the trial court determined that the fact that other\npeople had access to the car supported the decision to seize the car.\n\n       Subsequently, the trial court had several hearings in early 2008 to determine\nAppellant\u2019s competency to stand trial. Appellant was evaluated by multiple doctors prior to\nthe hearing and had spent some time as a patient in a mental health facility prior to the\nhearings. At least three of the doctors who evaluated Appellant reported that Appellant was\n\u201cmalingering\u201d or feigning mental illness. One of the doctors reported that Appellant was\ndepressed and \u201cphase[d] in and out of competence\u201d but could return to competence with\ntreatment. The majority of the doctors concluded, however, that Appellant exhibited some\nform of mental illness but was competent to stand trial at that time. The trial court ultimately\ndetermined that Appellant was competent.\n\n       In July of 2008, Appellant filed a petition to enter a guilty plea. At the guilty plea\nhearing, Appellant agreed to plead guilty to second degree murder in exchange for a twenty-\nyear sentence. At the guilty plea hearing, counsel for the State informed the trial court that,\nhad the case gone to trial, the proof would have established that:\n\n       [O]n September 9 th , 2004, Kenneth Miller, Jr. was found inside a vacant house\n       at 869 North Third Street.\n\n              Homicide began investigating the case. Mr. Miller was the victim of\n       a stab wound. He suffered numerous stab wounds, and then after dying, his\n       body was burned. This did not happen at the location of the abandoned house,\n       but he was transported there after death.\n\n              At that point, officers were able to investigate the case; they began\n       talking to witnesses and friends of the victim. They came upon a person they\n       now know to be [Appellant] who was the last known person to see the victim\n       alive. They were able to establish that he was the last person to see him alive.\n\n                                              -4-\n\f              Through their investigation, they developed enough evidence for a\n       search warrant. They executed that search warrant on his vehicle. When they\n       went into his vehicle, in the trunk of his vehicle, they found what appeared to\n       be two box cutters and a knife with blood on them. That did not turn out to be\n       the case. There was no blood on them. They were all clean. They were\n       actually - it was actually paint.\n\n              They also found a T-shirt and jeans that did have blood on them, and\n       those came back to the victim through DNA analysis that was done days later.\n       Based on the knives, based on the clothing, based on a third factor - that being\n       a gas can in the back of the trunk along with accelerant on the T-shirt and\n       jeans, the state had a circumstantial case to go forward with the fact that\n       [Appellant] was, in fact, the one that last saw the victim, . . . , and did\n       participate in his killing.\n\n        The trial court accepted the guilty plea and the parties agreed to reserve the following\ncertified questions for appeal:\n\n       1) Whether the trial court erred by denying the [Appellant\u2019s] motion to\n       suppress all the evidence taken from the trunk of the car that was seized by the\n       police on September 13, 2004? Whether the seizure of the car from the parking\n       lot where [Appellant] worked in the absence of a search warrant violated the\n       U.S. Const. amend. IV and amend. XIV and Art. 1 \u00a7 7 and \u00a7 8 of the\n       Tennessee Constitution and in violation of Rule 41 of the Tennessee Rules of\n       Criminal Procedure; thereby[ ] requiring that the evidence taken from the\n       trunk be suppressed? A search warrant was later signed on September 15,\n       2004[,] and the vehicle was searched.\n\n       2) Whether the trial court erred by determining that [Appellant] was legally\n       competent to stand trial.\n\n                                           Analysis\n\n                                     Search and Seizure\n\n        On appeal, Appellant argues that his \u201cwarrantless arrest\u201d was not based on probable\ncause. Further, Appellant contends that his statements to officers and the evidence seized\nfrom the car were the result of his warrantless arrest. Appellant also argues that the search\nof his car was illegal because the police lacked probable cause to seize it without a warrant.\nFinally, Appellant contends that the search warrant was invalid because there was insufficient\n\n                                              -5-\n\fprobable cause to support the issuance of the warrant and the warrant was executed illegally.\nThe State counters that the record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the officers\nproperly seized Appellant\u2019s car based on probable cause. Further, the State suggests that \u201call\nissues concerning the detention of [Appellant], the validity and execution of the search\nwarrant and the voluntariness of [Appellant\u2019s] statement are beyond the scope of the certified\nquestion. It is plain from the written reservation of the certified question that the State is\ncorrect and we cannot review these latter issues.\n\n        This Court will uphold a trial court\u2019s findings of fact in a suppression hearing unless\nthe evidence preponderates otherwise. State v. Hayes, 188 S.W.3d 505, 510 (Tenn. 2006)\n(citing State v. Odom, 928 S.W.2d 18, 23 (Tenn. 1996)). On appeal, \u201c[t]he prevailing party\nin the trial court is afforded the \u2018strongest legitimate view of the evidence and all reasonable\nand legitimate inferences that may be drawn from that evidence.\u2019\u201d State v. Carter, 16\nS.W.3d 762, 765 (Tenn. 2000) (quoting State v. Keith, 978 S.W.2d 861, 864 (Tenn. 1998)).\n\u201cQuestions of credibility of the witnesses, the weight and value of the evidence, and\nresolution of conflicts in the evidence are matters entrusted to the trial judge as the trier of\nfact.\u201d Odom, 928 S.W.2d at 23. Our review of a trial court\u2019s application of law to the facts\nis de novo, with no presumption of correctness. State v. Walton, 41 S .W.3d 75, 81 (Tenn.\n2001) (citing State v. Crutcher, 989 S.W.2d 295, 299 (Tenn. 1999); State v. Yeargan, 958\nS.W.2d 626, 629 (Tenn. 1997)). When the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are based entirely on\nevidence that does not involve issues of witness credibility, however, appellate courts are as\ncapable as trial courts of reviewing the evidence and drawing conclusions, and the trial\ncourt\u2019s findings of fact are subject to de novo review. State v. Binette, 33 S.W.3d 215, 217\n(Tenn. 2000).\n\n       Both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section\n7 of the Tennessee Constitution protect individuals against unreasonable searches and\nseizures by government agents. See U.S. Const. amend. IV; Tenn. Const. art. I, \u00a7 7. \u201cThese\nconstitutional provisions are designed to \u2018safeguard the privacy and security of individuals\nagainst arbitrary invasions of government officials.\u2019\u201d State v. Keith, 978 S.W.2d 861, 865\n(Tenn. 1998) (quoting Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 528 (1967)). The\nTennessee Supreme Court has noted previously that \u201c[a]rticle I, [section] 7 [of the Tennessee\nConstitution] is identical in intent and purpose with the Fourth Amendment [of the United\nStates Constitution],\u201d and that federal cases applying the Fourth Amendment should be\nregarded as \u201cparticularly persuasive.\u201d Sneed v. State, 423 S.W.2d 857, 860 (Tenn. 1968).\n\n      Under both constitutions, \u201ca warrantless search or seizure is presumed unreasonable,\nand evidence discovered as a result thereof is subject to suppression unless the State\ndemonstrates that the search or seizure was conducted pursuant to one of the narrowly\ndefined exceptions to the warrant requirement.\u201d Yeargan, 958 S .W.2d at 629 (citing\n\n                                              -6-\n\fCoolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 454-55 (1971)); see also State v. Garcia, 123\nS.W.3d 335, 343 (Tenn. 2003).\n\n        The \u201cautomobile exception\u201d allows police officers to search or seize a vehicle without\na warrant if they have probable cause to believe the vehicle contains contraband. Carroll v.\nUnited States, 267 U.S. 132, 149 (1925); State v. Leveye, 796 S.W.2d 948 (Tenn. 1990).\nThe rationale for the exception rests upon (1) the impracticability of obtaining a search\nwarrant in light of the inherent mobility of an automobile; and (2) the reduced expectation\nof privacy with respect to one\u2019s automobile. California v. Carney, 471 U.S. 386, 390-93\n(1985); South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U.S. 364, 367 (1976). \u201cProbable cause has been\ndefined as a reasonable ground for suspicion, supported by circumstances indicative of an\nillegal act.\u201d State v. Hemming, 975 S.W.2d 290, 294 (Tenn. 1998). If the police have\nprobable cause to believe that an automobile contains contraband, the officers may either\nseize the vehicle and then obtain a warrant or they may search the vehicle immediately.\nChambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 52 (1970).\n\n        Looking at the case herein, the investigation revealed that Appellant was the last\nperson seen with the victim alive. Officers knew that Appellant had given the victim a ride\nin the Lumina on the night before the victim\u2019s body was discovered. Appellant was vague\nand inconsistent under questioning about whether the ride Appellant gave the victim was for\nmoney or not. The car was parked in a public lot and Appellant had informed the officers\nthat other people had access to the vehicle. Officer Mullins expressed concern about the\nmobility of the vehicle and the preservation of any evidence that might have been inside.\nFurther, officers knew that the victim\u2019s body had been transported from the scene of the\nmurder to the location where the body was found. Although, this case presents a close\nquestion, we believe there is at least minimal probable cause to seize the Appellant\u2019s car and\ntow it to a secure location. This issue is without merit.\n\n                                        Competency\n\n       Appellant also challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that he was legally competent\nto stand trial. The State argues that this issue is not dispositive and, therefore, not\nappropriate for review via a certified question of law. We agree.\n\n      For a question to be dispositive we \u201cmust either affirm the judgment or reverse and\ndismiss. A question is never dispositive when we might reverse and remand . . . if we . . .\ndecided the question on its merits and found in favor of the defendant.\u201d State v. Wilkes, 684\nS.W.2d 663, 667 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1984). Further, a question regarding suppression of the\nevidence is not dispositive if other incriminating evidence exists in the record outside the\nscope of that question. State v. Dailey, 235 S.W.3d 131, 135 (Tenn. 2007).\n\n                                             -7-\n\f        In State v. Bailey, 213 S.W.3d 907 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2006), this Court examined the\nissue of a defendant\u2019s competency in the context of a certified question and determined that\nthe resolution of the issue would not result in a final disposition of the case because, even if\nthe court determined that the trial court erred, the result would be to remand the matter to the\ntrial court. Id. at 912. Thus, we determined that this issue was not dispositive and that the\ncourt was without jurisdiction to make a determination on the matter. The case herein is akin\nto Bailey. A determination of incompetence would not lead to a dismissal of the charges\nagainst Appellant. This question was not properly certified. Accordingly, we are without\njurisdiction to review this issue on appeal.\n\n                                         Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            ___________________________________\n                                            JERRY L.
