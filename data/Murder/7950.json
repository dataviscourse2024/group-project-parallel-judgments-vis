Jefferson and George committed the\nfirebombing to retaliate against a fellow member for breaking the gang\u2019s code of\nsilence. Following a six-week trial in 1998, a federal jury convicted Jefferson of\ntwelve crimes he committed as part of the 6-0 Tres Crips, including the five murders\n(Counts 51-55) and conspiracy to distribute cocaine and crack cocaine (Count 2).\nUnder the mandatory sentencing guidelines then in effect, the district court2 imposed\nstatutory maximum life imprisonment sentences on those counts. See 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a)(1) (1988); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(b)(1)(A) (1988). On direct\nappeal, we affirmed Jefferson\u2019s convictions and sentence (and, with one exception,\nthe convictions and sentences of four co-defendants). United States v. Jefferson, 215\nF.3d 820 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 911 (2000). We later denied his 2003 and\n2004 motions for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\n\n       In Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012), the Supreme Court held that\nimposing a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole on a juvenile\nviolates the Eighth Amendment. In 2013, Jefferson petitioned for \u00a7 2255 relief,\narguing he should be resentenced under Miller, a decision subsequently made\nretroactive in Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U.S. 190 (2016). The district court\nvacated Jefferson\u2019s sentence and, after a two-day sentencing hearing, varied\ndownward from the now advisory guidelines range of life in prison and resentenced\nJefferson to terms of 600 months imprisonment (50 years) for the firebombing murder\nconvictions, 120 months for the cocaine conspiracy conviction, 48 months on each\nof two other counts, 120 months on each of three other counts, and 240 months on the\nlast count, all to be served concurrently. United States v. Jefferson, No. 97-276-04-\nMJD, 2015 WL 501968 (D. Minn. Feb. 5, 2015). We affirmed. United States v.\nJefferson, 816 F.3d 1016 (8th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 2290 (2017).\n\n\n      2\n      The Honorable Michael J. Davis, United States District Judge for the District\nof Minnesota.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f       In a pro se motion filed in May 2021, Jefferson sought \u00a7 2255 relief under\nSection 404 of the First Step Act of 2018, which made relief under Sections 2 and 3\nof the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 available to eligible defendants sentenced prior\nto 2010. See First Step Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 404, 132 Stat. 5194,\n5222. Jefferson claimed that Section 2 of the Fair Sentencing Act reduced the\nmandatory minimum penalties for his Count 2 cocaine conspiracy offense by raising\nthe drug quantity needed to trigger the mandatory minimum sentence from 50 grams\nto 280 grams of cocaine base. See Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-220,\n\u00a7 2, 124 Stat. 2372. Count 2 is therefore a covered offense making him eligible for\nthe grant of discretionary First Step Act relief, Jefferson argued. He urged the district\ncourt to reduce his 600-month sentence to time served plus five years of supervised\nrelease. The government concedes that Count 2 is a covered First Step Act offense.\n\n       Invoking the concurrent sentence doctrine, the district court denied First Step\nAct relief. Noting it had previously denied George\u2019s First Step Act application for\na \u201cfull resentencing,\u201d the court found that Jefferson\u2019s concurrent 600-month\nsentences on the five murder counts remain valid, and the court would not reduce the\nsentences on the murder counts if the sentence on the drug count was reduced.\nJefferson\u2019s sentence has already been reduced from life to 50 years, the court\nexplained, \u201cand the arguments he makes for a further reduction . . . were all\nconsidered by the Court at his 2015 resentencing.\u201d United States v. Jefferson, No.\nCR 97-276-4-MJD, 2021 WL 5494652, at *3 (D. Minn. Nov. 23, 2021).\n\n      Jefferson appeals this Order, raising a single issue on appeal: \u201cThe District\nCourt abused its discretion by employing the concurrent sentence doctrine to avoid\nresentencing Mr. Jefferson.\u201d Reviewing the district court\u2019s use of the concurrent\nsentence doctrine for an abuse of discretion, we conclude the court applied the\ndoctrine consistent with controlling Eighth Circuit decisions and therefore affirm.\nSee Smith v. United States, 930 F.3d 978, 981 (8th Cir. 2019) (standard of review).\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f       \u201cThe concurrent sentence doctrine allows courts to decline to review the\nvalidity of a concurrent conviction or sentence when a ruling in the defendant\u2019s favor\n\u2018would not reduce the time he is required to serve\u2019 or otherwise \u2018prejudice him in any\nway.\u2019\u201d Eason v. United States, 912 F.3d 1122, 1123 (8th Cir. 2019) (emphasis\nadded), quoting United States v. Olunloyo, 10 F.3d 578, 581-82 (8th Cir. 1993).\nWhen the defendant\u2019s underlying challenge is to the validity of a concurrent\nconviction, we apply the doctrine \u201conly when there was no possibility of prejudicial\ncollateral consequences attendant upon the [challenged] convictions.\u201d Oslund v.\nUnited States, 944 F.3d 743, 746 n.2 (8th Cir. 2019) (cleaned up). The Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision that the special assessment imposed on each count of conviction\nconstitutes sufficient prejudice to require \u00a7 2255 review of a concurrent conviction\u2019s\nvalidity \u201chad the practical effect of eliminating the doctrine from challenges to\nconcurrent convictions.\u201d Id. at 748 (Arnold, J., dissenting); id. at 746 n.2; see Ray\nv. United States, 481 U.S. 736, 737 (1987). Here, however, there is no challenge to\nthe validity of Jefferson\u2019s Count 2 conviction. He seeks First Step Act relief based\non the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s impact on his Count 2 sentence.\n\n      When the challenge is to the validity of a concurrent sentence, the prejudicial\nconsequences inquiry turns on whether a \u00a7 2255 ruling in defendant\u2019s favor would\n\u201creduce the time he is required to serve or otherwise prejudice him in any way.\u201d\nEason, 912 F.3d at 1123 (cleaned up). As the Fourth Circuit described this standard:\n\n      [T]he doctrine still has continuing force as a species of harmless-error\n      review where a defendant seeks to challenge the legality of a sentence\n      that was imposed for a valid conviction, but where the challenged\n      sentence runs concurrently with a valid sentence of an equal or greater\n      duration.\n\nUnited States v. Charles, 932 F.3d 153, 160 (4th Cir. 2019) (emphasis in original);\naccord United States v. Stuckey, No. 20-1565, 2021 WL 2470308, at *2 (6th Cir. Feb.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f8, 2021); United States v. Parker, 993 F.3d 595, 607 (8th Cir. 2021). That is the\nsituation presented by this appeal.\n\n      Jefferson argues that retroactive application of Section 2 of the Fair Sentencing\nAct makes his sentence on Count 2 invalid because it reduces, indeed eliminates, the\nmandatory minimum sentence of ten years by changing the now advisory guidelines\nrange from 10 years to life to zero to 20 years. Assuming Jefferson is correct, but not\ndeciding the issue, the district court noted that the concurrent sentences on his eleven\nother counts of conviction are not affected by the Fair Sentencing Act as made\napplicable by \u00a7 404 of the First Step Act and then properly addressed the critical\nconcurrent-sentence-doctrine question -- whether a ruling in Jefferson\u2019s favor would\n\u201creduce the time he is required to serve or otherwise prejudice him in any way.\u201d\nEason, 912 F.3d at 1123 (cleaned up).\n\n       Jefferson argued the court should \u201cresentence him on all counts\u201d for the same\nreasons he argued for a reduced sentence in 2015 -- disparity between his sentence\nand those of less culpable co-defendants, his status as a juvenile under Miller v.\nAlabama, the length of time he has served, and his substantial rehabilitation,\nincluding a discipline-free record while in custody. In effect, Jefferson asked the\ncourt to reconsider its 2015 resentencing decision that we affirmed on appeal. He\nargued that \u201c[n]othing in the text of the First Step Act requires a sentencing guideline\nto have changed for a court to consider whether to reduce an aggregate term of\nimprisonment.\u201d If he only faced a 20-year statutory maximum on the cocaine\nconspiracy conviction when he was resentenced, this might have favorably affected\nthe district court\u2019s resentencing on the murder counts.\n\n      In denying First Step Act relief, the district court squarely addressed these\ncontentions. The court explained that \u201cthe arguments [Jefferson] makes for a further\nreduction . . . were all [expressly] considered by the Court\u201d in its Miller factors and\nSection 3553(a) analysis at Jefferson\u2019s 2015 resentencing hearing. Jefferson, 2021\n\n                                          -5-\n\fWL 5494652, at *3.3 The court again rejected Jefferson\u2019s sentencing disparity\narguments on the merits, distinguishing his case from two co-defendants who\nbenefitted from the First Step Act. Noting it had previously applied the concurrent\nsentence doctrine in denying George\u2019s First Step Act motion, the court expressly\nfound it would not reduce Jefferson\u2019s sentences on the murder counts if his sentence\non the drug count was reduced. Id. at *2-3.\n\n       A district court considering whether to exercise its First Step Act discretion\nconducts a \u201ccomplete review,\u201d not a full resentencing. United States v. Moore, 963\nF.3d 725, 728 (8th Cir. 2020). \u201cA complete review . . . means that a district court\nconsidered [Jefferson\u2019s] arguments . . . and had a reasoned basis for its decision.\u201d\nUnited States v. Hoskins, 973 F.3d 918, 921 (8th Cir. 2020) (quotation omitted).\nReducing Jefferson\u2019s 120-month sentence on Count 2 would not require the court to\nreduce the length of his other concurrent sentences. He points to no other evidence\nof potential prejudice. When, as here, the district court ruling on a First Step Act\nmotion initially sentenced the defendant and later granted a sentence reduction, the\ncourt\u2019s \u201cplain statement\u201d that it declined to exercise its discretion to grant a further\nreduction \u201ccloses the matter.\u201d United States v. Howard, 962 F.3d 1013, 1015 (8th\nCir. 2020); see United States v. Downs, 830 F. App\u2019x 482, 483-84 (8th Cir. 2020).\nThe district court properly treated the concurrent sentence doctrine as \u201ca species of\nharmless-error review.\u201d Charles, 932 F.3d at 160. As it applied the proper analysis\nin invoking the doctrine, and its analysis is consistent with our First Step Act\nprecedents, there was no abuse of its broad First Step Act discretion.\n\n      The Order of the district court dated November 23, 2021 is affirmed.\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n      3\n        Likewise, we expressly considered these arguments in concluding that the\ndistrict court\u2019s 600-month sentence was not substantively unreasonable. Jefferson,\n816 F.3d at 1020-21.\n\n                                          -6-\n\f",
