F01-40949-V(B) IN THE 292ND JUDICIAL DISTRICT\r\nCOURT\r\n\r\nDALLAS COUNTY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPer Curiam.  \r\n\r\n\r\nO R D E R\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThis is a subsequent application for writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to the\r\nprovisions of Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 11.071, \u00a7 5.\r\n\r\n\tIn April 2002, a jury found applicant guilty of the offense of capital murder.  The jury\r\nanswered the special issues submitted pursuant to Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article\r\n37.071, and the trial court, accordingly, set applicant's punishment at death.  This Court\r\naffirmed applicant's conviction and sentence on direct appeal.  Stroman v. State, No. AP-74,354 (Tex. Crim. App. Nov. 19, 2003)(not designated for publication).  Applicant filed his\r\ninitial post-conviction application for writ of habeas corpus in the trial court on November\r\n13, 2003.  This Court denied relief.  Ex parte Stroman, No. WR-62,298-01 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\nJuly 27, 2005)(not designated for publication).  Applicant filed this his first subsequent\r\napplication in the trial court on July 12, 2011.\r\n\r\n\tApplicant presents three allegations in his application.  In the first allegation, he\r\nasserts that he is actually innocent of the crime with which he is charged and that he is\r\nactually innocent of the death penalty.  In his second allegation, applicant asserts that the\r\nfailure to respect the wishes of the victims violates the law.  And in his third claim, he asserts\r\nthat he was deprived of his right to the effective assistance of counsel for a number of\r\nreasons.  We have reviewed the application and find that applicant's allegations fail to satisfy\r\nthe requirements of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5.  Accordingly, we dismiss the application as an abuse\r\nof the writ without considering the merits of the claims.  Applicant's motion to stay his\r\nexecution is denied.   \r\n\r\n\tIT IS SO ORDERED THIS THE 14th DAY OF JULY, 2011.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Publish \r\n\r\n\r\n",
