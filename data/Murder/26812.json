After thorough review, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Criminal Court Affirmed\n\nALAN E. GLENN, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which ROBERT L. HOLLOWAY,\nJR., and TIMOTHY L. EASTER, JJ., joined.\n\nMartez Wheeler, Harstville, Tennessee, Pro Se.\n\nHerbert H. Slatery III, Attorney General and Reporter; Jonathan H. Wardle, Assistant\nAttorney General; Amy P. Weirich, District Attorney General; and Bryce Phillips,\nAssistant District Attorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n\n                                       OPINION\n\n                                        FACTS\n\n       On December 4, 2014, the Defendant was indicted by a Shelby County Grand Jury\non two counts of attempted first degree murder, two counts of employing a firearm\nduring the commission of a dangerous felony, and one count of evading arrest. On\nOctober 5, 2015, the Defendant pled guilty to two counts of attempted first degree murder\nand one count of employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony, and\nthe State dismissed the remaining charges. The Defendant received concurrent 20-year\nsentences for the two attempted murder convictions and a six-year consecutive sentence\n\ffor the firearm conviction, for a total effective sentence of 26 years. The Defendant did\nnot appeal.\n\n       On October 16, 2018, the Defendant filed a pro se \u201cMotion for Correction of\nIllegal Sentence.\u201d In his motion, the Defendant asserted that his sentence was \u201cnot\nauthorized by applicable statutes\u201d because \u201cwith a charge [of] Criminal Attempt to\nCommit First Degree Murder where a gun is part of the crime, Tennessee Code\nAnnotated \u00a739-17-1324, cannot be used to increase it again.\u201d The trial court summarily\ndismissed the Defendant\u2019s motion by written order on November 13, 2018, finding that\nhe had not stated a colorable claim for relief from an illegal sentence.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n       The Defendant argues on appeal, as he argued in his Rule 36.1 motion, that he\nreceived illegal sentences for his attempted murder and firearm convictions because he\ncould not be convicted of both attempted first degree murder and the firearm charge\nbecause the firearm was used to commit the attempted first degree murder.\n\n        Rule 36.1 provides \u201ca mechanism for the defendant or the State to seek to correct\nan illegal sentence.\u201d State v. Brown, 479 S.W.3d 200, 208-09 (Tenn. 2015). An illegal\nsentence is defined as \u201cone that is not authorized by the applicable statutes or that directly\ncontravenes an applicable statute.\u201d Tenn. R. Crim. P. 36.1(a). When a defendant files a\nmotion under Rule 36.1, the trial court must determine whether the motion \u201cstates a\ncolorable claim that the sentence is illegal.\u201d Tenn. R. Crim. P. 36.1(b). In the context of\nRule 36.1, a colorable claim is a claim that, \u201cif taken as true and viewed in a light most\nfavorable to the moving party, would entitle the moving party to relief under Rule 36.1.\u201d\nState v. Wooden, 478 S.W.3d 585, 593 (Tenn. 2015).\n\n        Our supreme court has classified the three categories of sentencing errors: clerical\nerrors (those arising from a clerical mistake in the judgment sheet), appealable errors\n(those for which the Sentencing Act specifically provides a right of direct appeal) and\nfatal errors (those so profound as to render a sentence illegal and void). Id. at 594-95.\nFatal errors are \u201csentences imposed pursuant to an inapplicable statutory scheme,\nsentences designating release eligibility dates where early release is statutorily prohibited,\nsentences that are ordered to be served concurrently where statutorily required to be\nserved consecutively, and sentences not authorized by any statute for the offenses.\u201d Id.\nThe court held that only fatal errors render sentences illegal. Id.\n\n       The Defendant impliedly argues that such a sentence is illegal because the use of a\nfirearm was an element of the underlying dangerous felony, attempted first degree\nmurder, which he was convicted of. The State responds that the Defendant has not stated\n                                            -2-\n\fa colorable claim for relief, noting that his \u201cbasic legal premise is wrong\u201d and that even if\nhis legal premise were correct, it would still not be a colorable claim for relief under Rule\n36.1. We agree with the State.\n\n       The Defendant is correct in asserting that a defendant cannot be charged with both\nemploying a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony and the underlying\ndangerous felony if an essential element of that dangerous felony is possession or\nemployment of a firearm. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-17-1324(c). However, as noted by\nthe State, employing or possessing a firearm is not an essential element of either first\ndegree murder or criminal attempt. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 39-12-101(a), 39-13-202(a)(1). The\nDefendant\u2019s indictments do not indicate that a firearm was essential to the attempted first\ndegree murders. Accordingly, as noted by both the State and the trial court, there was\nnothing preventing the Defendant from being charged with both attempted first degree\nmurder and employing a firearm. Even if such an argument had merit, this court has\npreviously stated that \u201cRule 36.1 applies to sentences and \u2018does not provide an avenue for\nseeking reversal of convictions.\u2019\u201d State v. Carl Hall, No. W2016-00915-CCA-R3-CD,\n2017 WL 1093991, at *2 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 22, 2017) (quoting State v. Jimmy\nWayne Wilson, No. E2013-02354-CCA-R3-CD, 2014 WL 185622, at *2 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. Mar. 31, 2014)). Thus, even if the Defendant\u2019s assertion were meritorious, it is\ninappropriate for a Rule 36.1 motion. The Defendant is not entitled to relief.\n\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n        Based on the foregoing authorities and reasoning, we affirm the judgment of the\ntrial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                             ____________________________________\n                                             ALAN E.
