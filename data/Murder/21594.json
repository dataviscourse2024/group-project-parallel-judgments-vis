FERGUSON\n\n                           SUMMARY**\n\n\n                          Habeas Corpus\n\n    The panel reversed the district court\u2019s judgment granting,\non reconsideration, habeas corpus relief to Kirk Rishor \u2013\nwho, on remand from the Washington Court of Appeals, pled\nguilty to second degree assault \u2013 and remanded for\nreinstatement of the district court\u2019s judgment denying habeas\nrelief.\n\n    The panel held that a motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n59(e) that raises entirely new claims should be construed as\na second or successive habeas petition subject to AEDPA\u2019s\nrestrictions; and that a Rule 59(e) motion raises a \u201cnew\nclaim\u201d when it seeks to add a ground for relief not articulated\nin the original federal habeas petition, presents newly\ndiscovered evidence, or seeks relief based on a subsequent\nchange in the law. The panel wrote that, in contrast, a timely\nRule 59(e) motion that asks the district court to \u201ccorrect\nmanifest errors of law or fact upon which the judgment rests\u201d\nshould not be construed as a second or successive petition.\n\n    The panel held that Rishor\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion \u2013 which\nasked the district court to reconsider whether the state court\nviolated clearly established federal law (1) by holding that\nRishor had validly waived counsel on remand, and (2) by\nholding that the prosecution did not violate double jeopardy\nprinciples on remand \u2013 did not raise \u201cnew claims,\u201d and that\nthe district court therefore had jurisdiction to consider the\n\n  **\n     This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\f                    RISHOR V. FERGUSON                         3\n\npost-judgment motion in the first instance without seeking\npre-certification by the Court of Appeals under 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A).\n\n     Applying AEDPA review on the merits, the panel held\nthat the district court abused its discretion by granting\nreconsideration and awarding Rishor habeas relief. As to\nRishor\u2019s waiver of counsel claim, the panel held that the\ndistrict court erred by finding that the United States Supreme\nCourt had authored clearly established law on whether a\ndefendant, who has validly waived counsel before his first\ntrial, is entitled to a second Faretta hearing on remand. The\npanel could not say that the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s\nalternative holding \u2013 that Rishor was not prejudiced by the\ncourt\u2019s failure to secure a second waiver of counsel \u2013 was\ncontrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished federal law.\n\n    The panel held that the district court also erred in granting\nhabeas relief on Rishor\u2019s claim that the state improperly re-\nfiled first degree assault charges on remand in violation of his\nrights under the Double Jeopardy Clause. The panel could\nnot say that the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s determination\nthat Rishor\u2019s guilty plea to second degree assault was \u201cwholly\nvoluntary\u201d was based on an unreasonable determination of\nthe facts in light of the evidence, or was contrary to, or\ninvolved an unreasonable application of clearly established\nfederal law. The panel explained that the fact that the state\nre-charged Rishor with first degree assault does not\nundermine the voluntariness of his guilty plea to second\ndegree assault. The panel concluded that since this court\nmust defer to the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s decision that\nRishor\u2019s guilty plea was valid, Rishor could not attack his\n\f4                  RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\nconviction based on a constitutional violation that occurred\nprior to his guilty plea.\n\n\n                        COUNSEL\n\nAlex Kostin (argued), Assistant Attorney General; Robert W.\nFerguson, Attorney General, Olympia, Washington, for\nRespondent-Appellant.\n\nTodd Maybrown, Allen, Hansen & Maybrown, Seattle,\nWashington, for Petitioner-Appellee.\n\n\n                         OPINION\n\nTALLMAN, Circuit Judge:\n\n     Kirk Rishor waived counsel and represented himself\nduring his 2004 trial in Washington\u2019s Whatcom County\nSuperior Court on charges of first degree assault, second\ndegree assault, and unlawful possession of a firearm. The\njury convicted him on the unlawful possession charge but\nacquitted him on the two charged counts of second degree\nassault. The jury, however, impliedly acquitted Rishor on\nfirst degree assault, and convicted him instead of the lesser-\nincluded offense of second degree assault.\n\n    Rishor\u2019s conviction was reversed by the Washington\nCourt of Appeals, and on remand, Rishor pled guilty to\nsecond degree assault. Despite pleading guilty, Rishor\ncommenced a series of post-judgment motions in superior\ncourt challenging his conviction. After exhausting review of\nhis conviction in state court, Rishor petitioned the federal\n\f                    RISHOR V. FERGUSON                         5\n\ndistrict court for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254,\narguing that he did not validly waive counsel and that the\nState violated double jeopardy principles on remand. The\ndistrict court initially dismissed Rishor\u2019s habeas petition with\nprejudice, and Rishor then filed a motion for reconsideration.\nIn 2014, nearly a year later, the district court granted Rishor\u2019s\nmotion for reconsideration, vacated its prior judgment, and\ngranted habeas relief. We now reverse the district court\u2019s\njudgment and remand for reinstatement of the judgment\ndenying habeas relief.\n\n                               I\n\n     In May 2004, Kirk Rishor proceeded to trial in Whatcom\nCounty Superior Court on charges of first degree assault\n(count 1), second degree assault (counts 2 and 3), and first\ndegree unlawful possession of a firearm (count 4). In a pre-\ntrial hearing, Rishor informed Judge Steven J. Mura, the\nsuperior court judge assigned to the trial, that he wished to\nproceed pro se. Judge Mura fully advised Rishor of the risks\nand responsibilities associated with self-representation and\nattempted to dissuade Rishor from waiving counsel.\nSpecifically, Judge Mura informed Rishor that he would not\nbe able to claim ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal,\nthat he would be responsible for putting together proposed\njury instructions, and that he would be bound by the same\nrules as lawyers\u2014including the rules of evidence and ethics.\nJudge Mura and Rishor also engaged in the following\ncolloquy:\n\n        THE COURT: [I]n my 30 years of being on\n        both sides of the courtroom as a defense\n        counsel, prosecutor and now 12 years as a\n        judge in a criminal case I have never seen\n\f6                 RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\n       anybody who has ever represented themselves\n       competently; do you understand that?\n\n       THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I do.\n\n       THE COURT: If you represent yourself\n       incompetently you\u2019re stuck with you and you\n       suffer the consequences. The consequences if\n       convicted, the State informs me, is a sentence\n       of life without possibility of parole.\n\n       THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.              I fully\n       understand that.\n\n       THE COURT: And that as a practical matter\n       if you represent yourself\u2014and this is just me\n       talking up here.\n\n       THE DEFENDANT: Okay.\n\n       THE COURT: As a practical matter the court\n       might as well sign an order sending you to\n       prison without possibility of parole right now\n       because you\u2019re going to screw your case up;\n       do you understand that?\n\nDespite these warnings, Rishor confirmed his desire to\nproceed pro se, Judge Mura approved the request, and Rishor\n(assisted by standby counsel) ably represented himself\nthroughout his jury trial.\n\n   Ultimately, the jury acquitted Rishor on the two charged\ncounts of second degree assault (counts 2 and 3) and\nconvicted him on the charge of unlawful possession of a\n\f                       RISHOR V. FERGUSON                               7\n\nfirearm (count 4). The jury, however, impliedly acquitted\nRishor on the greater charge of first degree assault (count 1)1\nand convicted Rishor of the lesser-included offense of second\ndegree assault. The jury also made a special finding that\nRishor was armed with a firearm at the time of the assault.\nRishor was sentenced to 115 months confinement on the\nassault charge, which included 36 months for the weapon\nenhancement, and 102 months on the unlawful possession\ncharge. All sentences were ordered to run concurrently.\n\n    On direct review, the Washington Court of Appeals\nreversed Rishor\u2019s second degree assault conviction due to\nerroneous jury instructions and remanded the case back to the\nsuperior court for a new trial on that charge. On November\n2, 2006, the parties again met with Judge Mura, the same\njudge who had presided over Rishor\u2019s first trial, to \u201creiterate\n[Rishor\u2019s] request to proceed in a pro se basis.\u201d At this initial\nhearing on remand, Rishor requested that Thomas Fryer be\nappointed as his standby counsel to assist him with filing\nmotions from jail because incarceration made it difficult for\nRishor to do so. Judge Mura instructed Rishor to draft an\norder appointing Fryer as standby counsel, which Rishor\nsubsequently prepared and filed with the court several days\nlater.\n\n    On remand, the State initially filed a first amended\ninformation charging Rishor with one count of first degree\n\n  1\n     Here, the jury failed to reach a verdict on first degree assault and,\ninstead, convicted Rishor of the lesser charge of second degree assault.\nThis amounts to an implied acquittal under our decision in Brazzel v.\nWashington, which held that \u201cwhen a jury convicts on a lesser alternate\ncharge and fails to reach a verdict on the greater charge . . . the jury\u2019s\nsilence on the second charge is an implied acquittal.\u201d 491 F.3d 976, 978\n(9th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted).\n\f8                      RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\nassault while armed with a deadly weapon, the same conduct\nfor which the jury impliedly acquitted Rishor at his first trial.\nOn January 8, 2007, the State filed a second amended\ninformation charging Rishor with second degree assault\nwithout a firearm allegation, and that same day Rishor\nentered a guilty plea to that unenhanced charge. At his plea\nhearing, Rishor explained that he was pleading guilty \u201cfreely\nand voluntarily.\u201d He acknowledged that the plea agreement\nallowed him to avoid the weapon enhancement. He also\nstated that he wanted to take the plea so that his daughter,\nwho was about to start college, would not have to come back\nfor a second trial. The court imposed an 84-month sentence\non the second degree assault charge, which was ordered to\nrun concurrently with Rishor\u2019s 102-month unlawful\npossession conviction.\n\n    Rishor then, through counsel, appealed his new sentence\nto the Washington Court of Appeals, arguing that the\nprosecutor breached the plea agreement by urging the trial\ncourt to impose a higher sentence on the unlawful possession\ncharge.2 The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed Rishor\u2019s\njudgment and sentence, and Rishor did not seek further\nreview from the Washington Supreme Court.\n\n    On January 10, 2008, Rishor filed a motion to withdraw\nhis guilty plea and a state habeas petition in Whatcom County\nSuperior Court. In his post-judgment motion and state habeas\npetition, Rishor argued that he was not formally arraigned on\n\n\n    2\n   At his second sentencing hearing, Rishor asked the court to impose an\n84-month sentence on the unlawful possession charge and the State\nrecommended a new sentence of 115 months. The court rejected both\nrecommendations and imposed the same concurrent sentence of 102\nmonths as it had done previously.\n\f                       RISHOR V. FERGUSON                               9\n\nremand, he was coerced into pleading guilty, and he did not\nadequately waive his right to counsel following remand.\nRishor\u2019s post-judgment motion and petition were eventually\ntransferred to the Washington Court of Appeals for\nconsideration as a collateral state habeas petition, called a\n\u201cpersonal restraint petition\u201d (PRP), which was dismissed on\nMarch 8, 2010.\n\n     On September 9, 2010, the Washington Supreme Court\ndenied Rishor\u2019s motion for discretionary review. Relevant to\nthis appeal, the Washington Supreme Court found that Rishor\nhad validly waived his right to counsel before his original\ntrial and that Rishor was \u201cmore than ready to proceed pro se\u201d\non remand. The court also found that Rishor\u2019s standby\ncounsel had waived Rishor\u2019s right to first appearance and\nformal arraignment on remand. Finally, the court rejected\nRishor\u2019s claim that he was coerced into pleading guilty and\nfound that Rishor\u2019s plea was \u201cwholly voluntary.\u201d\n\n     Next, Rishor filed a federal habeas corpus petition under\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the United States District Court for the\nWestern District of Washington. Rishor alleged that he was\nentitled to relief on three grounds stemming from his remand\nproceedings: (1) he did not receive notice of the charges\nagainst him, (2) he was not arraigned, and (3) he did not\nvalidly waive counsel. Rishor also filed a supplemental brief\nin connection with his habeas petition that argued that the\nprosecution violated double jeopardy principles on remand by\ninitially recharging him with first degree assault, conduct on\nwhich the jury had acquitted him during his first trial.3 On\n\n\n 3\n   The parties contest whether Rishor fairly presented his double jeopardy\nclaim in state court. However, Rishor\u2019s appeal does not require us to\ndecide this issue for the reasons explained in Part V of this opinion.\n\f10                      RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\nOctober 28, 2013, United States Magistrate Judge James P.\nDonohue issued a Report and Recommendation, concluding\nthat the district court should deny the habeas petition with\nprejudice. Chief United States District Judge Marsha J.\nPechman adopted the Report and Recommendation,\ndismissed the habeas petition with prejudice, and entered\njudgment against Rishor.\n\n    Rishor then filed a motion for reconsideration\u2014the\nsubject of this appeal. Rishor asked the district court to\nreconsider whether he was entitled to habeas relief on the\nground that he did not validly waive counsel on remand.\nRishor also asked the district court to reconsider whether he\nwas entitled to habeas relief on the ground that the\nprosecution had violated due process and double jeopardy\nprinciples by failing to re-arraign him and re-charging him\nwith first degree assault in order to secure a plea bargain.4\n\n    On December 3, 2014, the district court granted Rishor\u2019s\nmotion to reconsider and vacated its prior judgment. The\ncourt held that the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s decision was\ncontrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished federal law and that Rishor was entitled to habeas\nrelief on both his waiver of counsel and double jeopardy\nclaims. The State timely appealed.\n\n                                     II\n\n   Our review in this case is guided in part by the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104\u2013132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). The\n\n  4\n    In its order denying Rishor\u2019s habeas petition, the district court did not\ndiscuss Rishor\u2019s double jeopardy claim.\n\f                    RISHOR V. FERGUSON                      11\n\nprovisions of AEDPA \u201ccreate an independent, high standard\nto be met before a federal court may issue a writ of habeas\ncorpus to set aside state-court rulings.\u201d Uttecht v. Brown,\n551 U.S. 1, 10 (2007). As the Supreme Court has made clear,\n\u201c\u2018[t]his is a \u2018difficult to meet,\u2019 and \u2018highly deferential\nstandard for evaluating state-court rulings, which demands\nthat state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\u2019\u201d\nCullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 182 (2011) (quoting\nWoodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 24 (2002)).\n\n    Under AEDPA, a state prisoner\u2019s habeas petition shall not\nbe granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on\nthe merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication\nof the claim\u2014\n\n       (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to,\n       or involved an unreasonable application of,\n       clearly established Federal law, as determined\n       by the Supreme Court of the United States; or\n\n       (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an\n       unreasonable determination of the facts in\n       light of the evidence presented in the State\n       court proceeding.\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\n    Finally, before we proceed to apply AEDPA\u2019s standards\nin this case, we must identify the state court decision that is\nappropriate for our review. \u201cWhen more than one state court\nhas adjudicated a claim, we analyze the last reasoned\ndecision.\u201d Barker v. Fleming, 423 F.3d 1085, 1091 (9th Cir.\n2005). Here, the last reasoned state court decision is the\nWashington Supreme Court\u2019s denial of discretionary review\n\f12                    RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\nof Rishor\u2019s personal restraint petition dismissal. See id. at\n1091\u201392 (holding that a seven-page order from the\nWashington Supreme Court denying review of a PRP was the\nlast reasoned state court decision).\n\n                                 III\n\n    As an initial matter, we must determine whether the\ndistrict court had jurisdiction to rule on Rishor\u2019s motion for\nreconsideration, and whether we, in turn, have jurisdiction to\nreview it on appeal. The district court properly construed\nRishor\u2019s post-judgment motion for reconsideration,5 filed\nwithin twenty-eight days of entry of judgment, as a motion to\nalter or amend the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 59(e). See Am. Ironworks & Erectors, Inc. v. N.\nAm. Const. Corp., 248 F.3d 892, 898\u201399 (9th Cir. 2001);\n11 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice\nand Procedure \u00a7 2810.1 (2012) (\u201cRule 59(e) does, however,\ninclude motions for reconsideration.\u201d). The question\npresented, therefore, is whether Rishor\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion\nis subject to the additional restrictions that apply to \u201csecond\nor successive\u201d habeas corpus petitions under the provisions\nof AEDPA. Whether Rishor\u2019s motion should be construed as\na second or successive habeas petition is a conclusion of law\nthat we review de novo. Riordan v. State Farm Mut.

If a petitioner presents\na new claim in a second or successive habeas corpus\napplication, we must also dismiss that claim unless one of\ntwo exceptions applies:\n\n       (A) the applicant shows that the claim relies\n       on a new rule of constitutional law, made\n       retroactive to cases on collateral review by the\n       Supreme Court, that was previously\n       unavailable; or\n\n       (B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could\n       not have been discovered previously through\n       the exercise of due diligence; and\n\n       (ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven\n       and viewed in light of the evidence as a\n       whole, would be sufficient to establish by\n       clear and convincing evidence that, but for\n       constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder\n       would have found the applicant guilty of the\n       underlying offense.\n\nId. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A)\u2013(B)(ii). \u201cBefore a second or successive\napplication permitted by this section is filed in the district\n\f14                     RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\ncourt, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of\nappeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider\nthe application.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). A petitioner\u2019s failure\nto seek such authorization from the appropriate appellate\ncourt before filing a second or successive habeas petition acts\nas a jurisdictional bar. United States v. Key, 205 F.3d 773,\n774 (5th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                   B\n\n    Our discussion of this issue begins with the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005).\nThere, the Supreme Court addressed when a federal court\nshould construe a petitioner\u2019s Rule 60(b)6 motion as a second\nor successive habeas petition subject to the restrictions of\nAEDPA. Id. at 526. Although Gonzalez limited its holding\nto Rule 60(b) motions, our sister circuits have split on\nwhether Gonzalez\u2019s holding extends to Rule 59(e) motions,\nsuch as Rishor\u2019s post-judgment motion for reconsideration.\nSee id. at 529 n.3 (\u201cIn this case we consider only the extent to\nwhich Rule 60(b) applies to habeas proceedings under\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, which governs federal habeas relief for\nprisoners convicted in state court.\u201d).\n\n    Gonzalez explained that the Rules of Civil Procedure\napply \u201cin habeas corpus proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\nonly to the extent\u201d that they are \u201cnot inconsistent\u201d with the\n\u201cstatutory provisions and rules\u201d of AEDPA. Id. at 529. The\nCourt also noted that \u201c[a]s a textual matter, \u00a7 2244(b) applies\n\n\n  6\n    \u201cRule 60(b) allows a party to seek relief from a final judgment, and\nrequest reopening of his case, under a limited set of circumstances\nincluding fraud, mistake, and newly discovered evidence.\u201d Gonzalez,\n545 U.S. at 528.\n\f                    RISHOR V. FERGUSON                        15\n\nonly where the court acts pursuant to a prisoner\u2019s\n\u2018application\u2019 for a writ of habeas corpus,\u201d and that \u201can\n\u2018application\u2019 for habeas relief is a filing that contains one or\nmore \u2018claims.\u2019\u201d Id. at 530.\n\n     Accordingly, Gonzalez held that a Rule 60(b) motion is\nsubject to AEDPA\u2019s restrictions when the motion advances\none or more claims, such as a motion that: seeks to present\nnewly discovered evidence, seeks to add a new ground for\nrelief, attacks the resolution of a claim on the merits, or seeks\nto vacate the judgment because of a subsequent change in\nsubstantive law. Id. at 531. \u201cA habeas petitioner\u2019s filing that\nseeks vindication of such a claim is, if not in substance a\n\u2018habeas corpus application,\u2019 at least similar enough that\nfailing to subject it to the same requirements would be\n\u2018inconsistent with\u2019 the statute.\u201d Id. This is so because\n\n        [u]sing Rule 60(b) to present new claims for\n        relief from a state court\u2019s judgment of\n        conviction\u2014even claims couched in the\n        language of a true Rule 60(b) motion\u2014\n        circumvents AEDPA\u2019s requirement that a new\n        claim be dismissed unless it relies on either a\n        new rule of constitutional law or newly\n        discovered facts.\n\nId. In contrast, a Rule 60(b) motion that \u201cattacks, not the\nsubstance of the federal court\u2019s resolution of a claim on the\nmerits, but some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas\nproceedings,\u201d should not be construed as a second or\nsuccessive habeas petition. Id. at 532.\n\f16                     RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\n                                   C\n\n    Our sister circuits disagree over the application of\nGonzalez and second-or-successive principles to Rule 59(e)\nmotions. The Fifth, Eighth, Tenth, and Fourth Circuits have\nconcluded that a Rule 59(e) motion that advances a \u201cclaim\u201d\nas defined by Gonzalez should be construed as a second or\nsuccessive habeas petition. See Williams v. Thaler, 602 F.3d\n291, 303\u201305 (5th Cir. 2010); Ward v. Norris, 577 F.3d 925,\n935 (8th Cir. 2009); United States v. Pedraza, 466 F.3d 932,\n934 (10th Cir. 2006); United States v. Martin, 132 Fed. App\u2019x\n450, 451 (4th Cir. 2005) (unpublished).7 The Third, Sixth,\nand Seventh Circuits have held that a Rule 59(e) motion\nshould never be construed as a second or successive habeas\npetition, whether or not it advances a Gonzalez claim.\nBlystone v. Horn, 664 F.3d 397, 415 (3d Cir. 2011); Howard\nv. United States, 533 F.3d 472, 475\u201376 (6th Cir. 2008); Curry\nv. United States, 307 F.3d 664, 665 (7th Cir. 2002).\n\n    Today we address this issue for the first time. We have\npreviously held that altering or amending a judgment under\nRule 59(e) is an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d usually available\nonly when (1) the court committed manifest errors of law or\nfact, (2) the court is presented with newly discovered or\npreviously unavailable evidence, (3) the decision was\nmanifestly unjust, or (4) there is an intervening change in the\ncontrolling law. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Herron, 634 F.3d 1101,\n1111 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing McDowell v. Calderon, 197 F.3d\n1253, 1255 n.1 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc)). We have also held\nthat a Rule 59(e) motion may not be used to \u201craise arguments\n\n\n  7\n   See also United States v. Winestock, 340 F.3d 200, 203 n.1 (4th Cir.\n2003) (treating all motions for reconsideration, whether filed under Rule\n59 or Rule 60, as subject to AEDPA\u2019s successive petition rule).\n\f                       RISHOR V. FERGUSON                            17\n\nor present evidence for the first time when they could\nreasonably have been raised earlier in the litigation.\u201d Id.\n(citing Kona Enters., Inc. v. Estate of Bishop, 229 F.3d 877,\n890 (9th Cir. 2000)).\n\n    We now hold that a Rule 59(e) motion that raises entirely\nnew claims should be construed as a second or successive\nhabeas petition subject to AEDPA\u2019s restrictions. A Rule\n59(e) motion raises a \u201cnew claim\u201d when the motion seeks to\nadd a ground for relief not articulated in the original federal\nhabeas petition, presents newly discovered evidence, or seeks\nrelief based on a subsequent change in the law. In contrast,\na timely Rule 59(e) motion that asks the district court to\n\u201ccorrect manifest errors of law or fact upon which the\njudgment rests\u201d should not be construed as a second or\nsuccessive habeas petition.\n\n    Accordingly, a district court presented with a motion for\nreconsideration in a habeas case must first determine whether\nthe motion should be construed as a second or successive\nhabeas petition: that is whether it seeks to raise an argument\nor ground for relief that was not raised in the initial habeas\npetition.8 If so, the district court should dismiss the motion\nwithout prejudice to allow the applicant to move in the Court\nof Appeals for an order authorizing the district court to\nconsider the second habeas application. However, the district\n\n 8\n    We note that in other contexts a Rule 59(e) motion may be granted to\nallow a movant to present newly discovered evidence or an intervening\nchange in controlling law. In the context of habeas proceedings, however,\na Rule 59(e) motion raising such grounds for relief is in \u201csubstance\u201d a\nsecond habeas petition subject to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s additional restrictions. A\nhabeas petitioner may certainly still bring these arguments in a second\npetition if the additional and more restrictive requirements of \u00a7 2244(b)\nare met.\n\f18                  RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\ncourt may proceed to consider the merits of a Rule 59(e)\nmotion that is filed within twenty-eight days of judgment and\nasks the court to correct errors of fact or law. As always, the\ndistrict court will \u201cenjoy[] considerable discretion in granting\nor denying the motion.\u201d Id. (citing McDowell, 197 F.3d at\n1255 n.1).\n\n    The approach we adopt today is, in essence, a hybrid of\nthe approaches adopted by our sister circuits thus far. The\nFifth, Eighth, Tenth, and Fourth Circuits apply Gonzalez to\nRule 59(e) motions that raise both previously adjudicated\nclaims and new claims. We decline to adopt this approach,\nas it \u201cattribute[s] to Congress the unlikely intent to preclude\nbroadly the reconsideration of just-entered judgments.\u201d\nHoward, 533 F.3d at 475; see id. (\u201cIf the holding of Gonzalez\napplied to Rule 59(e) motions, it would almost always be\neffectively impossible for a district court to correct flaws in\nits reasoning, even when the problems were immediately\npointed out and could easily be fixed by that court.\u201d). We see\nno sign that Congress intended AEDPA to vitiate the district\ncourt\u2019s power to \u201crectify its own mistakes in the period\nimmediately following the entry of judgment,\u201d obviating the\ntime and expense of unnecessary appellate proceedings.\nWhite v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Emp\u2019t Sec., 455 U.S. 445, 450 (1982).\n\n    We similarly decline to adopt the approach of the Third,\nSixth, and Seventh Circuits, which never applies Gonzalez or\nAEDPA to Rule 59(e) motions. While this bright-line\napproach may be easy to apply, it allows district courts to\nimproperly entertain Rule 59(e) motions that are \u201cin\nsubstance\u201d second habeas petitions. See, e.g., Howard,\n533 F.3d at 473 (errors in sentencing raised for the first time\nin a Rule 59(e) motion); see also Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\n\f                       RISHOR V. FERGUSON                            19\n\n(instructing courts to focus on the \u201csubstance\u201d rather than the\nlabel of the post-judgment motion).\n\n    For these reasons, we depart from our sister circuits and\nhold that Gonzalez and \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rule 59(e) motions\nonly when the motion raises entirely new claims. We believe\nthis approach properly recognizes the key distinctions\nbetween post-judgment motions under Rules 59 and 60. A\nmotion for reconsideration under Rule 59(e) suspends the\nfinality of the judgment and tolls the time for appeal until the\nmotion is resolved.9 See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A);\nBlystone, 664 F.3d at 414. Accordingly, a timely Rule 59(e)\nmotion is \u201cneither a collateral attack on the initial habeas\njudgment, nor a new collateral attack on the underlying\ncriminal judgment\u2014rather it is part and parcel of the\npetitioner\u2019s one full opportunity to seek collateral review.\u201d\nBlystone, 664 F.3d at 414 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nA Rule 60(b) motion, in contrast, only comes into play after\nthe time to appeal has expired, the judgment has become\nfinal, and the petitioner has \u201cexpended the one full\nopportunity to seek collateral review that AEDPA ensures.\u201d\nId. at 413 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly,\na Rule 60(b) motion that raises a Gonzalez claim marks the\nstart of a second round of habeas litigation, triggering\nAEDPA\u2019s additional restrictions. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b).\n\n   While we recognize that motions for reconsideration\npursuant to Rule 59(e) can be consistent with AEDPA, we\n\n\n 9\n   Rule 60(b) motions filed within twenty-eight days of entry of judgment\nalso toll the time to appeal, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(vi), but such\nmotions are treated as Rule 59 motions. See Am. Ironworks, 248 F.3d at\n898\u201399; see also Fed. R. App. P. 4 advisory committee\u2019s note to the 1993\namendment.\n\f20                  RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\ncannot say that Rule 59(e) motions should never be construed\nas second habeas petitions. Experience has taught us that\nhabeas petitioners sometimes use Rule 59(e) improperly\u2014to\nraise entirely new claims. See, e.g., Howard, 533 F.3d at 473\n(errors in sentencing raised for the first time in Rule 59(e)\nmotion). Such a post-judgment motion, although \u201clabeled\u201d\na Rule 59(e) motion, is in substance a second habeas petition\nthat clearly \u201crequire[s] Court of Appeals permission to be\nfiled and considered.\u201d Id. at 476 (Boggs, J., dissenting).\nAccordingly, when faced with such a post-judgment motion,\ndistrict courts should follow Gonzalez\u2019s teaching and\npreclude a petitioner from improperly using Rule 59(e) to\n\u201ccircumvent[] AEDPA\u2019s requirement that a new claim be\ndismissed unless it relies on either a new rule of\nconstitutional law or newly discovered facts.\u201d Gonzalez,\n545 U.S. at 531.\n\n    In sum, we hold that a motion for reconsideration filed\nwithin twenty-eight days of judgment that raises a new claim,\nincluding one based on newly discovered evidence or an\nintervening change in substantive law, is subject to AEDPA\u2019s\nsecond-or-successive petition bar. However, a timely motion\nfor reconsideration that asks the district court to reconsider a\npreviously adjudicated claim on grounds already raised\nshould not be construed as a second or successive habeas\npetition subject to AEDPA\u2019s additional restrictions. See 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b).\n\n                               D\n\n    We now turn to Rishor\u2019s motion for reconsideration to\ndetermine whether it raised any \u201cnew claims\u201d such that it\nshould be construed as a second or successive habeas petition.\nWe conclude that it did not.\n\f                       RISHOR V. FERGUSON                             21\n\n    Rishor\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion asked the court to reconsider\ntwo issues: (1) whether the state court violated clearly\nestablished federal law when it held that Rishor had validly\nwaived counsel on remand, and (2) whether the state court\nviolated clearly established federal law by holding that the\nprosecution did not violate double jeopardy principles on\nremand.10 Rishor\u2019s habeas petition argued that he did not\nvalidly waive counsel on remand, in violation of the Sixth\nAmendment. Accordingly, Rishor did not raise his waiver of\ncounsel claim for the first time in his motion for\nreconsideration.\n\n    Nor can we say that Rishor raised his double jeopardy\nargument for the first time in his post-judgment motion.\nRishor\u2019s handwritten habeas \u201cform\u201d petition alleged that he\nwas not arraigned on remand and did not receive notice of the\ncharges filed against him. Neither of these claims implicate\ndouble jeopardy principles on their face. However, the\nstandard form Rishor used to fill out his habeas petition\ninstructed him not to argue or cite law. And, just seven days\nlater, Rishor filed a supplemental brief and argued:\n\n         The state had no legal authority to re-file first\n         degree assault charges against the petitioner.\n\n\n  10\n     Rishor\u2019s motion for reconsideration also asked the district court to\nreconsider whether his due process rights were violated when he was not\nre-arraigned or given notice of the charges filed against him on remand.\nThe district court, however, only granted reconsideration on Rishor\u2019s\ndouble jeopardy claim. Rishor does not argue this his due process rights\nwere violated on appeal. We therefore decline to consider this issue. See\nChadd v. United States, 794 F.3d 1104, 1109 n.4 (9th Cir. 2015).\nNonetheless, these issues are still relevant as to whether Rishor\u2019s guilty\nplea was knowing and voluntary. This issue is discussed in Section V.A\nof this opinion.\n\f22                   RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\n        State v. ahluwalia, 143 Wash. 2. 527, 540. . .41,\n        22 p. 3d. 1254 (2001) [sic] as demonstrated by\n        the discussion in ahluwalia and arraignment is\n        required afther [sic] a reversal, especially\n        when an amended information is filled [sic]\n        and there is a basis to be confused about the\n        charges . . . .\n\nIn State v. Ahluwalia, 143 Wash. 2d 527, 529 (Wash. 2001),\nthe Washington Supreme Court addressed whether federal\nand state constitutional double jeopardy principles were\nviolated when Ahluwalia was retried for second degree\nmurder after his first trial ended in a mistrial because the jury\nwas unable to reach a verdict on that charge. The Ahluwalia\ncourt held that constitutional double jeopardy principles bar\na defendant\u2019s retrial only on charges for which a defendant\nwas definitively convicted or acquitted in a previous trial. Id.\nat 536\u201339. Ultimately, the Washington Supreme Court held\nthat Ahluwalia\u2019s retrial for second degree murder did not\nviolate double jeopardy principles because Ahluwalia was\nneither acquitted nor convicted of that charge at his first trial;\nrather, the jury had merely been unable to reach a verdict. Id.\nat 541.\n\n    Although Ahluwalia\u2019s facts are distinguishable from\nRishor\u2019s case, Ahluwalia discussed double jeopardy\nprinciples at length. In addition, Rishor unequivocally stated\nin his supplemental briefing that \u201c[t]he state had no legal\nauthority to re-file first degree assault charges.\u201d On the other\nhand, it is unclear from Rishor\u2019s arguments whether he\nunderstood that a court\u2019s failure to re-arraign a defendant and\ngive him notice of the charges against him is a separate and\ndistinct argument from whether double jeopardy principles\nwere violated. Rishor failed to make these arguments\n\f                    RISHOR V. FERGUSON                       23\n\nseparately and distinctly. Nonetheless, we give Rishor\u2019s\narguments the \u201cbenefit of liberal construction,\u201d and conclude\nthat he adequately raised his double jeopardy claim in his\ninitial habeas filings. Porter v. Ollison, 620 F.3d 952, 958\n(9th Cir. 2010); see also Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94\n(2007) (\u201cA document filed pro se is to be liberally\nconstrued.\u201d).\n\n     In sum, we hold that Rishor\u2019s motion for reconsideration\nproperly asked the district court to reconsider the merits of\ntwo claims that were raised in Rishor\u2019s initial habeas petition.\nRishor\u2019s motion for reconsideration was, therefore, part and\nparcel of his one full opportunity to seek habeas relief and\nshould not be construed as a second or successive habeas\npetition. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court had\njurisdiction to consider Rishor\u2019s post-judgment motion in the\nfirst instance without seeking pre-certification by the Court of\nAppeals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A).\n\n                              IV\n\n    Having determined that the district court properly\nexercised jurisdiction over Rishor\u2019s motion for\nreconsideration, we turn to the merits of the district court\u2019s\nruling. On September 9, 2010, the Washington Supreme\nCourt denied discretionary relief on Rishor\u2019s waiver of\ncounsel claim and held that \u201cthe record indicates that Rishor\nwas more than ready to proceed pro se with the active\nassistance of standby counsel.\u201d On reconsideration, the\ndistrict court held that this decision was contrary to, or an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as\ndetermined by the United States Supreme Court. We review\nthe district court\u2019s grant of Rishor\u2019s motion for\n\f24                  RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\nreconsideration for abuse of discretion. Allstate Ins. Co.,\n634 F.3d at 1111.\n\n                              A\n\n    The Sixth Amendment guarantees that in all criminal\nprosecutions a defendant shall have the right to the assistance\nof counsel for his defense. U.S. Const. amend. VI; Powell v.\nAlabama, 287 U.S. 45, 66 (1932). The Sixth Amendment\nalso guarantees a defendant the right to refuse the assistance\nof counsel and to represent himself in criminal proceedings.\nFaretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 834 (1975). While a\ndefendant\u2019s choice to proceed pro se \u201cmust be honored out of\n\u2018that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the\nlaw,\u2019\u201d id. (citing Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 350\u201351\n(1970)), the Constitution \u201crequire[s] that any waiver of the\nright to counsel be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent,\u201d Iowa\nv. Tovar, 541 U.S. 77, 88 (2004). In other words, a defendant\nwho requests to proceed pro se \u201cmust be warned specifically\nof the hazards ahead.\u201d Tovar, 541 U.S. at 89.\n\n    There is no doubt that Rishor\u2019s waiver of counsel in 2004\nwas knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. He does not argue\nto the contrary. How could he? Before his trial, Rishor\nadamantly requested to proceed pro se even after Judge Mura\nclearly warned him that he would be bound by all the same\nrules as a lawyer, that he would almost certainly \u201cscrew up\u201d\nhis case, and that he had never seen a pro se litigant\neffectively represent himself.\n\n    Instead, Rishor relies on Faretta v. California, 422 U.S.\n806 (1975), to argue that the Washington trial court\u2019s failure\nto conduct a second, formal Faretta hearing violated the Sixth\nAmendment. In Faretta, the Supreme Court explained what\n\f                    RISHOR V. FERGUSON                      25\n\nis constitutionally required before a criminal defendant can\nvalidly waive counsel and proceed pro se, stating:\n\n       Although a defendant need not himself have\n       the skill and experience of a lawyer in order\n       competently and intelligently to choose self-\n       representation, he should be made aware of\n       the dangers and disadvantages of self-\n       representation, so that the record will establish\n       that \u201che knows what he is doing and his\n       choice is made with eyes open.\u201d\n\nId. at 835 (quoting Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann,\n317 U.S. 269, 279 (1942)).\n\n    The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Faretta, however, is\nsilent on whether a defendant, who has validly waived\ncounsel before his first trial, is entitled to a second Faretta\nhearing on remand. So is the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\nCarnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506 (1962), a case cited by\nRishor for the proposition that waiver of counsel cannot be\nimplied from the record. And where the holdings of the\nSupreme Court regarding the issue presented on habeas\nreview are lacking, \u201cit cannot be said that the state court\n\u2018unreasonabl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law.\u2019\u201d\nCarey v. Musladin, 549 U.S. 70, 77 (2006) (quoting\n\u00a7 2254(d)(1)). The district court, therefore, erred by finding\nthat the United States Supreme Court had authored \u201cclearly\nestablished\u201d law on this issue.\n\n    Nor can it be said that a \u201cgeneral standard\u201d from the\nSupreme Court\u2019s Sixth Amendment case law clearly\nestablishes that Rishor was entitled to a second, formal\nFaretta hearing. See Marshall v. Rodgers, 133 S. Ct. 1446,\n\f26                  RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\n1449 (2013) (\u201c[T]he lack of a Supreme Court decision on\nnearly identical facts does not by itself mean that there is no\nclearly established federal law, since \u2018a general standard\u2019\nfrom this Court\u2019s cases can supply such law.\u201d) (quoting\nYarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 664 (2004)). To the\ncontrary, the bright-line rule suggested by Rishor, and\nadopted by the district court, contravenes the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s adoption of a \u201cpragmatic approach to the waiver\nquestion\u201d in order to determine \u201cthe type of warnings and\nprocedures that should be required before a waiver of that\nright will be recognized.\u201d Tovar, 541 U.S. at 90 (citation\nomitted). In fact, the Supreme Court has expressly declined\nto \u201cprescribe[] any formula or script to be read to a defendant\nwho states that he elects to proceed without counsel,\u201d as the\ninformation a defendant needs to make an intelligent waiver\ndepends on \u201ca range of case-specific factors, including the\ndefendant\u2019s education or sophistication, the complex or easily\ngrasped nature of the charge, and the stage of the\nproceeding.\u201d Id. at 88.\n\n    Viewing Rishor\u2019s waiver argument through a \u201cpragmatic\u201d\nlens, it is clear that fairminded jurists could disagree as to\nwhether Rishor\u2019s original waiver of counsel remained intact\nthroughout his criminal prosecution. For instance, Rishor, on\nremand, had specifically requested to be placed on Judge\nMura\u2019s docket to request that attorney Thomas Fryer be\nappointed as his standby counsel. At this initial hearing, the\nprosecution informed Judge Mura that the parties were \u201chere\nthis morning to reiterate [Rishor\u2019s] request to proceed in a pro\nse basis.\u201d Rishor gave the court absolutely no indication that\nthis was not the case or that he no longer wished to proceed\npro se. Instead, Rishor proceeded to tell Judge Mura that he\nwanted to get standby counsel appointed so that he could\nhave assistance filing motions from jail. Rishor\u2019s renewed\n\f                    RISHOR V. FERGUSON                       27\n\nrequest for standby counsel was approved, and Rishor\npersonally drafted and filed the appropriate order appointing\nFryer as his standby counsel. Given Rishor\u2019s valid waiver of\ncounsel before his first trial and his unwavering resolve to\nproceed pro se on remand, we cannot say that the Washington\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision was \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d\nSee Renico v. Lett, 559 U.S. 766, 773 (2010) (finding that\nAEDPA creates \u201ca substantially higher threshold for\nobtaining relief than de novo review\u201d).\n\n    It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine what\nrule the Sixth Amendment in fact establishes for post-remand\nFaretta colloquies. All this case requires us to observe is\nthat, in light of Supreme Court precedent, fairminded jurists\ncould disagree as to whether Rishor\u2019s constitutional rights\nwere violated on remand. Under AEDPA, this issue is one on\nwhich we must defer to the considered judgment of our\ncolleagues on the Washington Supreme Court. Rishor\u2019s\nargument, accepted by the district court, does not pass muster\nunder AEDPA review.\n\n                               B\n\n    The district court concluded that the state court violated\nclearly established federal law by putting \u201cthe burden on\n[Rishor] to demonstrate lack of waiver and [failing] to apply\na presumption against waiver.\u201d The district court relied on\nMichigan v. Harvey, 494 U.S. 344, 354 (1990), and Brewer\nv. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 407 (1977)\u2014two cases involving\nthe right to counsel in police interrogations. Not only do\nthese cases involve a different factual scenario from this case,\nbut the district court also overlooked the Supreme Court\u2019s\nopinion in Iowa v. Tovar, 541 U.S. 77 (2004). There, the\nCourt held that \u201cin a collateral attack on an uncounseled\n\f28                 RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\nconviction, it is the defendant\u2019s burden to prove that he did\nnot competently and intelligently waive his right to the\nassistance of counsel.\u201d Id. at 92. Tovar illustrates that the\nstrict presumption against waiver of counsel does not last\nindefinitely. At the very least, Tovar creates room for\ndisagreement as to whether Rishor bore the burden of proof\non the waiver of counsel issue.\n\n    Finally, the district court also suggested that the\nWashington Supreme Court improperly required Rishor to\nshow that he was prejudiced by his invalid waiver of counsel.\nBut, as the district court noted and Rishor concedes on\nappeal, the Supreme Court has never held that a court\u2019s\nfailure to conduct a Faretta waiver is per se prejudicial.\nAccordingly, we cannot say that the Washington Supreme\nCourt\u2019s alternative holding\u2014that Rishor was not prejudiced\nby the court\u2019s failure to secure a second waiver of\ncounsel\u2014was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of,\nclearly established federal law.\n\n    \u201cIf no Supreme Court precedent creates clearly\nestablished federal law relating to the legal issue the habeas\npetitioner raised in state court, the state court\u2019s decision\ncannot be contrary to or an unreasonable application of\nclearly established federal law.\u201d Brewer v. Hall, 378 F.3d\n952, 955 (9th Cir. 2004). Therefore, the Washington\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision denying review of Rishor\u2019s waiver\nof counsel claim was not contrary to, or an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established federal law as established\nby the United States Supreme Court. The district court erred\nin concluding otherwise.\n\n    Accordingly, we hold that the district court abused its\ndiscretion by granting reconsideration and awarding Rishor\n\f                    RISHOR V. FERGUSON                      29\n\nhabeas relief on his waiver of counsel claim. See Koon v.\nUnited States, 518 U.S. 81, 100 (1996) (\u201cThe abuse-of-\ndiscretion standard includes review to determine that the\ndiscretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.\u201d);\nsee also Richard S. v. Dep\u2019t of Developmental Servs. of Cal.,\n317 F.3d 1080, 1086 (9th Cir. 2003) (district court abuses its\ndiscretion when it bases its ruling on an \u201cinaccurate view of\nthe law\u201d).\n\n                              V\n\n    Finally, we turn to Rishor\u2019s claim that the State\nimproperly re-filed first degree assault charges on remand in\nviolation of Rishor\u2019s rights under the Double Jeopardy\nClause. On remand, Rishor was initially charged with first\ndegree assault, the same conduct on which his first jury had\nimpliedly acquitted him after his first trial. Rishor, however,\nwas not ultimately convicted of that charge on remand. On\nJanuary 8, 2007, the State filed a second amended\ninformation changing the charge to second degree assault.\nThat same day, Rishor pled guilty to that charge.\n\n    Although the district court failed to address Rishor\u2019s\ndouble jeopardy argument in its initial order denying Rishor\nhabeas relief, the district court granted Rishor\u2019s motion for\nreconsideration and granted habeas relief on this claim. The\ndistrict court first determined that Rishor had properly\nexhausted this claim in the state courts. Citing Green v.\nUnited States, 355 U.S. 184, 190 (1957), which held that a\njury\u2019s verdict of acquittal bars a subsequent retrial on those\nsame offenses under the Double Jeopardy Clause, the district\ncourt held that Rishor was prosecuted in violation of the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause when he was charged on remand\nwith first degree assault. The district court then concluded\n\f30                 RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\nthat the state court\u2019s decision on the double jeopardy issue\nwas \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\u201d\nclearly established Supreme Court precedent.\n\n    The district court went on to consider de novo whether\nRishor\u2019s guilty plea to second degree assault prevented him\nfrom seeking habeas relief based on a double jeopardy\nviolation that occurred before his plea. The district court\ndetermined that Rishor\u2019s guilty plea was invalid and did not\npreclude habeas relief because Rishor had received bad\nadvice from his standby counsel and because \u201c[t]he filing of\nthe first degree assault charge placed [him] at a grave\ndisadvantage in the plea bargaining process.\u201d\n\n    We review the district court\u2019s ruling on reconsideration\nfor an abuse of discretion. Allstate, 634 F.3d at 1111.\n\n                              A\n\n   As an initial matter, we note that the parties contest\nwhether Rishor exhausted his double jeopardy claim in state\ncourt. However, Rishor\u2019s appeal does not require us to\ndecide this issue for the reasons below.\n\n    Before we can reach the merits of Rishor\u2019s double\njeopardy argument, we must resolve whether Rishor\u2019s guilty\nplea to second degree assault forecloses his double jeopardy\nclaim. This is so because the Supreme Court has held,\n\n       [A] guilty plea represents a break in the chain\n       of events which has preceded it in the criminal\n       process. When a criminal defendant has\n       solemnly admitted in open court that he is in\n       fact guilty of the offense with which he is\n\f                    RISHOR V. FERGUSON                       31\n\n       charged, he may not thereafter raise\n       independent claims relating to the deprivation\n       of constitutional rights that occurred prior to\n       the entry of the guilty plea.\n\nTollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973). Therefore,\n\u201cwhen the judgment of conviction upon a guilty plea has\nbecome final and the offender seeks to reopen the proceeding,\nthe inquiry is ordinarily confined to whether the underlying\nplea was both counseled and voluntary.\u201d United States v.\nBroce, 488 U.S. 563, 569 (1989). If the underlying guilty\nplea was entered into knowingly and voluntarily, the guilty\nplea forecloses a collateral attack on the underlying judgment.\nId.; see also Bradshaw v. Stumpf, 545 U.S. 175, 183 (2005)\n(\u201cA guilty plea operates as a waiver of important rights, and\nis valid only if done voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently,\n\u2018with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and\nlikely consequences.\u2019\u201d).\n\n    Whether Rishor\u2019s guilty plea to second degree assault\nforecloses his double jeopardy claim depends on whether it\nwas knowing and voluntary. See Broce, 488 U.S. at 574\n(finding it to be \u201cwell settled\u201d that a \u201cvoluntary and\nintelligent plea of guilty\u201d may not be collaterally attacked).\nThe Washington Supreme Court addressed this very issue in\nresponse to Rishor\u2019s argument that the State \u201ccoerced him\ninto pleading guilty\u201d by initially charging him with first\ndegree assault on remand. Specifically, the Washington\nSupreme Court held that \u201cnothing in the record indicates that\nthe plea was anything but wholly voluntary. The plea offer\nwas generous, and Mr. Rishor understandably took advantage\nof it rather than risk another trial.\u201d We give this\ndetermination deference under AEDPA.              28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2254(d)(2); see also Wood v. Allen, 558 U.S. 290, 301\n\f32                 RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\n(2010) (\u201c[A] state-court factual determination is not\nunreasonable merely because the federal habeas court would\nhave reached a different conclusion in the first instance.\u201d).\n\n    Our review of the record confirms that the state court\u2019s\ndecision was not objectively unreasonable. 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2254(d)(2). In his habeas petition, Rishor asserts that he\nwas \u201cnever given notice, read, or arraigned on any charges\nafter remand.\u201d However, on November 27, 2006, Rishor\u2019s\nstandby counsel waived the right to a first appearance and\narraignment, and Rishor provides no evidence that his\nstandby counsel was acting without his authority. Then, at\nhis plea hearing, Rishor confirmed that he was pleading guilty\nto second degree assault, with an 84-month sentence.\nRishor\u2019s plea deal was generous, as it allowed him to avoid\na weapon enhancement that may have added 36 additional\nmonths to his sentence. At his plea hearing, Rishor\nacknowledged this fact and explained that he was pleading\nguilty to avoid the weapon enhancement charge.\n\n    Rishor also stated that he was taking the plea deal to\navoid making his daughter come back for a second trial and\nto avoid a trial altogether. Specifically, he stated,\n\n       That\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m taking the guilty\n       plea is because I don\u2019t want to have to put my\n       daughter coming here and I have enough\n       problems and I\u2019ll take this deal. I just wanted\n       to make sure I plead guilty to the 84 months\n       for the assault minus the weapon\n       enhancement, okay, fine to get around the\n       trial.\n\f                    RISHOR V. FERGUSON                       33\n\nAnd later, he stated: \u201cYes. I went through [the plea deal] with\nMr. Fryer now. I don\u2019t want to bring my daughter back for\nanother trial. She just started school . . . . She\u2019s going to be\na lawyer.\u201d Finally, Rishor confirmed that he had reviewed\nthe plea deal with his standby counsel, that he understood the\nrights he was giving up, that he was not being threatened or\ncoerced into pleading guilty, and that he was doing so \u201cfreely\nand voluntarily.\u201d\n\n    That the State initially re-charged Rishor with first degree\nassault does not undermine the voluntariness of Rishor\u2019s\nguilty plea to second degree assault. Rishor never mentioned\nthat he was pleading to a lesser charge to avoid a first degree\nassault conviction; instead, Rishor unequivocally explained\nthat he was pleading guilty to avoid a weapon enhancement\nand because he wanted to avoid a trial altogether. Rishor\nconfirmed this fact less than a month later at his sentencing\non January 30, 2007 when he stated,\n\n       Your Honor, you\u2019re familiar with the case that\n       happened. I took a guilty plea on the assault\n       two mostly because I didn\u2019t want to bring my\n       daughter back from college and put her\n       through all of this was the main reason.\n\n           It was entirely reasonable for Rishor to\n       choose to avoid a second trial, especially\n       when a jury had already convicted him of the\n       charged offense plus an added weapon\n       enhancement. The record does not suggest\n       that Rishor\u2019s decision to plead guilty was\n       motivated by a fear of a potential first degree\n       assault conviction.       Rather, Rishor\u2019s\n       admissions made upon entry of his guilty plea\n\f34                     RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\n          show that he understood the nature of the\n          charges against him and that his guilty plea\n          was not driven in any part from the State\u2019s\n          initial filing of first degree assault. The\n          record evidence is certainly sufficient for the\n          Washington Court to have concluded that\n          Rishor\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary.\n\n    Finally, Rishor\u2019s standby counsel\u2019s alleged failure to\nadvise Rishor that the State\u2019s re-filing of first degree assault\npotentially violated the Double Jeopardy Clause does not\nrender Rishor\u2019s guilty plea invalid.11 There is no clearly\nestablished constitutional right to effective assistance of\nstandby counsel; nor is there a clearly established right to\nreceive correct advice from standby counsel in the plea\nbargaining process. See Locks v. Sumner, 703 F.2d 403,\n407\u201308 (9th Cir. 1983) (holding that the right to advisory\ncounsel is \u201cnot of constitutional dimension\u201d); United States\nv. Kienenberger, 13 F.3d 1354, 1356 (9th Cir. 1994) (holding\nthat a district court has discretion in deciding whether to\nappoint standby counsel).\n\n    Rishor had the opportunity to challenge the first amended\ninformation and attempt to show the existence of a double\njeopardy violation. He did not. Morever, Rishor knowingly\nassumed the risk that he would not understand the law well\nenough to defend himself competently when he decided to\nwaive his right to counsel. Rishor was specifically warned\n\n\n     11\n        Standby counsel Fryer, submitted an affidavit that stated:\n\u201cpresumptively the information I provided him as to the consequences of\nbeing convicted of assault in the first degree in contrast to the\nconsequences of pleading guilty to assault in the second degree factored\ninto [Rishor\u2019s] decision to plead guilty to the amended charge.\u201d\n\f                    RISHOR V. FERGUSON                      35\n\nthat he might fail to make a motion to dismiss the indictment\nbecause he did not know the law. Judge Mura told Rishor,\n\n       There might be a good motion somewhere for\n       you to make, a legal motion to dismiss, let\u2019s\n       say, or for some other relief, and if you don\u2019t\n       know what the law is you won\u2019t even know\n       what motions to make. Do you understand\n       that?\n\n    Accordingly, we cannot say that the state court\u2019s\ndecision\u2014finding that Rishor\u2019s guilty plea was \u201cwholly\nvoluntary\u201d\u2014resulted in a decision that was based on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\nevidence or in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2). Since we must defer to the\nWashington Supreme Court\u2019s decision that Rishor\u2019s guilty\nplea was valid, Rishor could not, under Tollett, attack his\nconviction based on a constitutional violation that occurred\nprior to his guilty plea. Therefore, double jeopardy was not\na valid basis for granting habeas relief.\n\n                              B\n\n    In determining whether Rishor was entitled to collateral\nrelief based on his double jeopardy argument, the district\ncourt was required to first decide whether Rishor\u2019s guilty plea\nwas knowing and voluntary. See Broce, 488 U.S. at 574. The\ndistrict court erred by skipping this initial step and first\naddressing the merits of Rishor\u2019s double jeopardy claim.\nAfter finding that the prosecution violated double jeopardy\nprinciples on remand, the district court proceeded to conduct\na de novo review as to whether Rishor\u2019s guilty plea was valid\n\f36                  RISHOR V. FERGUSON\n\nand precluded his double jeopardy argument. The district\ncourt legally erred by failing to give AEDPA deference to the\nWashington state court\u2019s determination that Rishor\u2019s guilty\nplea was knowing and voluntary.\n\n    In sum, the district court erred by granting Rishor habeas\nrelief on his double jeopardy claim. We therefore reverse the\ndistrict court on this issue as well and hold that Rishor is not\nentitled to habeas relief on his double jeopardy claim.\n\n                              VI\n\n    The Washington Supreme Court\u2019s decision that Rishor\nwas not entitled to habeas relief on his waiver of counsel and\ndouble jeopardy claims was neither contrary to, nor an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as\ndetermined by the United States Supreme Court. Due to its\nlegal errors, the district court abused its discretion by\nconcluding otherwise. Rishor\u2019s motion for reconsideration\nshould have been denied.\n\n    REVERSED, VACATED, and REMANDED with\ninstructions to reinstate the judgment denying habeas\nrelief.\n\f",
