R. APP. P. 68.4 (c), the State requests oral argument because\n\nthis case deals with a self-defense claim involving unique facts, and specific\n\nquestions regarding the facts may assist this Court in reaching a just decision.\n\nFurthermore, in order to reach its holding in this case, the court of appeals was\n\nrequired to distinguish its own precedent as well as precedent from other courts of\n\nappeals. Finally, the issue of who decides predicate questions for a self-defense\n\ninstruction and the factors involved in that analysis could have an impact on a\n\nsubstantial number of cases throughout the State of Texas.\n\n\n\n\n                                        vi\n\fTO THE HONORABLE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TEXAS:\n\n\n                          STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n      The State charged the appellant with the felony murder of Tevin Williams\n\n(CR\u20137). The jury found the appellant guilty (CR\u2013121; 6 RR 22). The trial court\n\nsentenced him in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict to twelve years in the Texas\n\nDepartment of Criminal Justice, Institutional Division (CR\u2013128-30; 7 RR 32-33).\n\nThe appellant filed timely notice of appeal, and the trial court certified that he had\n\nthe right to appeal (CR\u2013132-34).\n\n\n                   STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      The court of appeals issued a published opinion reversing the conviction,\n\nholding that the trial court was required to give a jury instruction on the law of\n\nself-defense. Dugar v. State, 14-14-00245-CR, 2015 WL 1632690 (Tex.App.\u2014\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] April 9, 2015, pet. filed) (attached as Appendix A). This\n\npetition for discretionary review is timely if filed on or before May 11, 2015. TEX.\n\nR. APP. P. 68.2.\n\n\n\n\n                                         vii\n\f                                 STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n       On May 2, 2010, 17-year-old Tevin Williams arrived at a going away party\n\nfor a friend heading to jail (3 RR 34-5, 84). Over a hundred people gathered in an\n\nabandoned K-Mart parking lot for the sendoff (3 RR 34-5, 85). About fifteen\n\nminutes after Williams arrived, the police shut down the party; everyone cleared in\n\na hurry and moved to a nearby park (3 RR 34, 39).\n\n       Williams rode along with Frederick Gibson, Adrian King and William\n\nWatson to the park in Gibson\u2019s black Dodge Charger (3 RR 39, 87-88, 166-67). See\n\n(St.Ex. #8). As cars left the K-Mart parking lot, some jostling occurred near the\n\nexits, where people tried to maneuver their vehicles in front of others (3 RR 89). A\n\ncaravan of vehicles followed Gibson onto Wallisville Road, including a black\n\nCadillac driven by a friend, Timothy Stallworth, and a red Ford Focus (3 RR 86-\n\n89, 92, 169). The appellant, driving in a Jeep, and his brothers, driving in two\n\nseparate Buicks,1 also followed the caravan (3 RR 88).\n\n       On the way to the park, several of the cars following Gibson were involved\n\nin an accident2 (3 RR 92, 168). Watson and Gibson did not see the accident\n\n\n1\n  Watson first testified that the two Cadillacs were with the appellant\u2019s convoy, but later clarified\nthat they were Buicks (3 RR 51-3). See (St.Ex. #7).\n2\n  The accounts of who was involved in the actual collision vary from witness to witness. Watson\nstated he did not have personal knowledge of the accident, but knew the Hispanic couple in the\ngreen Explorer had been hit (3 RR 47-8). Gibson testified that he did not see who was involved\nin the wreck, but thought it may have been Stallworth and the appellant (3 RR 92). Gibson later\n\fthemselves, but King saw some cars \u201cswinging\u201d \u2013 going side-to-side with their\n\ncars (3 RR 47-8, 92-4, 167). King saw the appellant\u2019s car hit another car and\n\nStallworth\u2019s vehicle, causing Stallworth to hit a green Ford Explorer (3 RR 168-9).\n\nThe green Explorer was not part of the caravan or going-away party, and contained\n\na Hispanic couple, Cesar Gonzalez and Jennifer Javier, and their nine-month-old\n\nchild (3 RR 94, 195-7). See (St. Ex. #9).\n\n       After learning about the accident, Gibson pulled over into a Workforce\n\nSolutions parking lot along Wallisville Road and flagged others down (3 RR 70,\n\n115). Stallworth and the green Explorer pulled over into the lot, but the appellant\n\nand the two Buicks left the scene (3 RR 49, 170). People in the parking lot were\n\nupset and confused about the accident (3 RR 97-8, 171). The appellant and his\n\nbrothers returned to the parking lot about ten to fifteen minutes after they drove off\n\n(3 RR 53, 115, 173).\n\n       When the appellant\u2019s convoy arrived, they did not exit their vehicles; instead\n\nthey stayed in their vehicles and \u201crolled\u201d through the parking lot (3 RR 50, 75-6,\n\n175). The others attempted to get information from the appellant regarding the\n\naccident, but the appellant would not provide any information (3 RR 174-5).\n\n\nlearned the Hispanic couple in the green Explorer had been hit (3 RR 94). King testified he saw\nthe appellant hit multiple cars (3 RR 168). The appellant\u2019s brother testified that the red Ford hit\nthe Explorer (5 RR 64). The appellant\u2019s cousin testified that the Cadillac ran a red light and hit\nanother vehicle (5 RR 96). The appellant testified that the Cadillac and the red Ford sandwiched\nhis vehicle, which caused his Jeep to hit the red Ford (5 RR 128).\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\fAlthough there was some arguing according to Watson, King, and Gibson, no\n\nthreats were made and no guns were drawn (3 RR 55-7, 103, 175, 201, 207; 5 RR\n\n131). The State\u2019s witnesses all testified no one showed a weapon to the appellant or\n\nhis convoy (3 RR 55-7, 103, 175, 201, 207). The appellant\u2019s brother and the\n\nappellant\u2019s cousin testified they saw multiple people with guns (5 RR 65-6, 99).\n\nThe appellant testified he saw only one person with a gun, but it was never pointed\n\nat him or anyone else (5 RR 131).\n\n      No one, including the appellant, saw Williams with a weapon (3 RR 105,\n\n181; 5 RR 158). No one, including the appellant, saw Williams threaten the\n\nappellant (3 RR 105, 181). No one, including the appellant, saw Williams and the\n\nappellant in any altercation (3 RR 105, 181).\n\n      The appellant stated he did not argue with anyone and was only in the\n\nparking lot for three to five minutes (5 RR 131). But because he was riding in a\n\nJeep, the appellant felt vulnerable and threatened by the hostile group of people in\n\nthe parking lot (5 RR 131). The appellant grabbed his gun out of fear, but did not\n\nshow it to anyone (5 RR 132).\n\n      The appellant and his brothers left the parking lot (5 RR 134). When the\n\nappellant was out of the parking lot on Wallisville Road, he turned and pointed his\n\ngun loaded with hollow-point bullets towards the crowd of people (5 RR 134).\n\nThough no one pointed a firearm at him and he was in the process of leaving, the\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fappellant shot two times towards the crowd (5 RR 134, 157-8). He felt that the\n\ncrowd pursued his vehicle and was going to cause him harm (5 RR 133-4). The\n\nappellant, with military training, knew it was unsafe and dangerous to human life\n\nto fire into a crowd of people (5 RR 141-2). The appellant was the first to shoot (5\n\nRR 157-8). The appellant shot Williams (5 RR 57). The appellant kept driving and\n\ndid not return (5 RR 157-8).\n\n      Dennis Wolfford, a homicide detective with the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s\n\nOffice, arrived on the scene around 7:00 pm (4 RR 3). Wolfford, along with other\n\ndeputies, interviewed the witnesses on the scene and tested each of their hands for\n\ngunshot residue (4 RR 8, 12). Williams\u2019 test results were negative (4 RR 88-90).\n\nJustin Harris, a passenger in Stallworth\u2019s Cadillac, admitted to firing several return\n\nshots at the appellant from Gibson\u2019s .380 handgun (3 RR 114; 4 RR 12). Officers\n\nrecovered spent .380 caliber bullet cartridges from the parking lot that matched that\n\ngun (3 RR 128-9; 5 RR 55).\n\n      From his investigation, Wolfford identified the appellant as the suspected\n\nshooter and issued a warrant for his arrest (4 RR 21-4). After the appellant was\n\narrested, he provided a statement to police (4 RR 26). See (St.Ex. #46). The\n\nappellant admitted to being the first shooter after Wolfford mentioned self-defense\n\n(4 RR 39; 5 RR 145-8). The appellant told officers that he thought the other group\n\ncould have been trying to steal his brothers\u2019 Buicks (4 RR 41-2; 5 RR 150). The\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fappellant admitted he knew of Williams\u2019 death but did not report anything about\n\nhis involvement (5 RR 83, 92, 111-12, 114). The appellant told officers he had\n\ngiven the 9-millimeter pistol to his brother after the shooting (4 RR 33-4). After\n\nfurther investigation, law enforcement found two shell casings from a 9-millimeter\n\npistol in the road near the parking lot that matched the appellant\u2019s weapon (4 RR\n\n18-19; 5 RR 56-8). And a 9-millimeter projectile was found with Williams\u2019 blood\n\non it that matched the appellant\u2019s weapon as well (5 RR 45-7, 57).\n\n      Williams died from a gunshot wound to the chest, and his death was ruled a\n\nhomicide (5 RR 24-5). The bullet entered through the top front part of his chest,\n\ntraveled through his right lung in a downward direction, and exited through his\n\nmid-back (5 RR 17-18). The medical examiner that performed Williams\u2019 autopsy\n\ndescribed this trajectory as unusual, and explained that Williams could have been\n\nbending over at the waist (5 RR 18-19). He also explained that he would not expect\n\na through and through injury to be caused by a \u201cfalling\u201d bullet, one shot directly\n\ninto the air, because it would not have enough force to exit the body (5 RR 31).\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f                          GROUNDS FOR REVIEW\n\n      A.    The appellant was not entitled to self-defense under a\n            multiple assailants theory when the victim was merely\n            present at the scene.\n\n      B.    The court of appeals erred in finding that the appellant was\n            entitled to a self-defense instruction because there was no\n            evidence that he reasonably apprehended an immediate\n            danger.\n      C.    The trial court could determine as a matter of law that the\n            victim was an innocent third person under Section 9.05 of\n            the Texas Penal Code thus precluding an instruction on self-\n            defense.\n      D.    The court of appeals erred in finding that the appellant was\n            harmed by the failure to include a self-defense instruction\n            because evidence sufficiently established beyond a\n            reasonable doubt that there was no justification for\n            protection against deadly force.\n\n                                  ARGUMENT\n\n      This petition for discretionary review should be granted because the lower\n\ncourt decided an important issue of state law that should be settled by this Court,\n\nbecause the decision conflicts with other courts of appeals\u2019 decisions on the same\n\nissue, and because the analysis used by the court has so far departed from the\n\naccepted and usual course of judicial proceedings so as to call for an exercise of\n\nthis Court\u2019s power of supervision. TEX. R. APP. P. 66.3. Specifically, the court of\n\nappeals held that the appellant was entitled to a jury instruction on self-defense\n\nunder a theory of multiple assailants despite the fact there was no evidence\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\findicating that the victim was a part of the perceived hostility and no reasonable\n\nbelief of an immediate danger. Furthermore, the court of appeals determined that\n\nwhether a victim is an innocent bystander under Section 9.05 is a question for the\n\nfactfinder, contrary to its previous precedent and other courts of appeals.\n\n\n                          GROUND FOR REVIEW ONE\n\n      The appellant was not entitled to self-defense under a multiple\n      assailants theory when the victim was merely present at the scene.\n\n      The court of appeals appears to contend that the appellant was entitled to an\n\ninstruction on self-defense from multiple assailants regardless of the complainant\u2019s\n\nactions. See Dugar, 2015 WL 1632690 at *11. But Williams\u2019 mere presence in the\n\nparking lot fails to establish that he acted as a party to the threat the appellant\n\nperceived. A claim of self-defense from multiple assailants requires some evidence\n\nthat the appellant could have perceived that the victim was complicit with those\n\nwho threatened his life. See Dickey v. State, 22 S.W.3d 490, 493 (Tex.Crim.App.\n\n1999) (Keller, J., concurring) (\u201cThe rule concerning multiple assailants is\n\nessentially an application of the law of parties to the defendant\u2019s assailants.\u201d);\n\nBlack v. State, 65 Tex. Crim. 336, 343-44, 145 S.W. 944, 947 (1912) (holding the\n\nappellant is entitled to act in self-defense against another that is part of a larger\n\ngroup of assailants when they \u201cin any way are encouraging, aiding, or advising the\n\nreal assaulting party.\u201d); TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 7.02 (West 2011). Without requiring\n\nsome evidence of a victim\u2019s connection to the hostility, a defendant could\n\n                                          7\n\fpresumably kill anyone merely in the vicinity of a hostile group and claim self-\n\ndefense.\n\n      Here, no evidence was presented that Williams encouraged, aided, directed,\n\nor acted with deadly force against the appellant; he did not have a weapon, there\n\nwas no gunshot residue found on his hands and he did not threaten or speak to\n\nanyone, and there was no evidence that he was complicit with other\u2019s actions\n\ntowards the appellant (3 RR 105, 158, 181). Cf. Cunningham v. State, 982 S.W.2d\n\n513, 520 (Tex.App.\u2014San Antonio 1998, pet. ref\u2019d) (holding that appellant\u2019s\n\npresence at the time of the shooting and pointing towards the victims suggested he\n\nacted in concert with the shooters; even if he did not shoot a gun himself and only\n\npointed, his action suggested he was encouraging those who were shooting); see\n\nalso Dickey, 22 S.W.3d at 493 (providing a hypothetical that deadly force may be\n\njustified against a victim who only blocked the exit while other individuals\n\nbrandished firearms and attacked the defendant). Therefore, the appellant was not\n\njustified in his actions against Williams because he could not be considered \u201ca\n\nparty\u201d to any group attack on the appellant.\n\n      The lower court appears to conclude that merely being present with a group\n\nof angry people is enough to garner responsibility for the group\u2019s actions. See\n\nDugar, 2015 WL 1632690 at *12. The court of appeals relies on Williams being a\n\npassenger in the Cadillac in order to support its contention that Williams partook in\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\fdeadly force against the appellant. Id. But the court misstated the record on this\n\npoint.3 Williams was not a passenger in the Cadillac that \u201caggressively chased\u201d the\n\nappellant down; rather, the record indicated that Williams was a passenger in\n\nGibson\u2019s Dodge Charger (3 RR 44, 87-88, 92, 166-67; 5 RR 126). The Charger\n\nwas not involved in the accident and Gibson only pulled into the parking lot after\n\nhe witnessed the accident behind him (3 RR 44, 87-88, 92, 166-67; 5 RR 126).\n\n       The only evidence that connected Williams with the alleged \u201cangry mob\u201d\n\nwas that he was merely present in the parking lot. But mere presence has never\n\nbeen held sufficient to determine any level of criminal responsibility. See, e.g.,\n\nBeardsley v. State, 738 S.W.2d 681, 685 (Tex.Crim.App. 1987) (holding that for\n\npurposes of the law of parties mere presence of the defendant at the scene of the\n\noffense will not support a conviction; but, it is a circumstance which, combined\n\nwith other facts, may show the defendant was a participant); Evans v. State, 202\n\nS.W.3d 158, 162 (Tex.Crim.App. 2006) (holding that mere presence at the location\n\nwhere drugs are found is insufficient, by itself, to establish possession of those\n\ndrugs).\n\n\n\n\n3\n The court of appeals may have relied on Watson\u2019s misstatement when he referred to the black\nCadillac as Tevin\u2019s; however, Watson later clarified that the Cadillac belonged to Stallworth (3\nRR 39, 44). And Watson, Gibson and King all testified that the complainant rode with them in\nGibson\u2019s Charger (3 RR 44, 87-88, 92, 166-67). Even if the appellant was a passenger in the\nCadillac, finding that he encouraged the road rage or was a party to the aggression against the\nappellant as a passenger would be speculation.\n\n                                               9\n\f      Moreover, courts that have addressed the issue have required more than\n\nvague testimony that the crowd as a whole was hostile or that they were \u201call\n\ncoming after the defendant\u201d to support a finding that the injured third party acted\n\nin concert with the angry mob. Cf. State v. Sandoval, 258 P.3d 1016, 1021 (N.M.\n\n2011) (finding that the defendant\u2019s testimony that the victim looked as if he were\n\nsearching for something in the car was evidence to support providing an instruction\n\non self-defense from multiple attackers); Horn v. State, 647 S.W.2d 283, 285\n\n(Tex.Crim.App. 1983) (finding the evidence showed the victim acted in concert\n\nwith two other assailants when the defendant testified that the victim kicked him\n\nand there was undisputed testimony that he aided the other two assailants).\n\n      The principle of self-defense against multiple assailants does \u201cnot give a\n\ndefendant carte blanche to kill anybody who is marginally associated with the\n\nalleged assailant.\u201d People v. Johnson, 316 N.W.2d 247, 249 (Mich. 1982).\n\nFollowing the lower court\u2019s logic, the appellant would have been justified in killing\n\nanyone in the parking lot, including Javier\u2019s nine-month-old child that was also\n\nmerely present in the crowd. See (3 RR 196-200). Therefore, the court of appeals\n\nerred in holding otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f                          GROUND FOR REVIEW TWO\n\n       The court of appeals erred in finding that the appellant was entitled\n      to a self-defense instruction because there was no evidence that he\n      reasonably apprehended an immediate danger.\n\n      A defendant is not entitled to a self-defense instruction merely because he\n\nasks for it and claims that he felt fear at the time he used deadly force; rather, the\n\nfact that he reasonably believed his use of force was immediately necessary to\n\nprotect himself from another\u2019s use or potential use of deadly force must be raised\n\nby the evidence. Shaw v. State, 243 S.W.3d 647, 658 (Tex.Crim.App. 2007); TEX.\n\nPENAL CODE \u00a7\u00a7 9.31, 9.32 (West 2011). This belief is measured by a mixed\n\nobjective and subjective standard to determine whether a defendant was justified in\n\nusing deadly force. See Hamel v. State, 916 S.W.2d 491, 493 (Tex.Crim.App. 1996)\n\n(noting that the \u201cterm \u2018reasonably believes\u2019 in \u00a7 9.32 encompasses the traditional\n\nholding that a suspect is justified in defending against danger as he reasonably\n\napprehends it.\u201d); TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 1.07(42) (West supp. 2014) (measuring\n\nreasonableness of the belief by the objective standard of an \u201cordinary and prudent\n\nman.\u201d).\n\n      An instruction on self-defense is not required when it is not raised by the\n\nevidence. Id. And when the undisputed facts demonstrate a complete absence of\n\nimmediate necessity or harm, a trial court may deem it unreasonable as a matter of\n\nlaw. Scroggs v. State, 396 S.W.3d 1, 13 (Tex.App.\u2014Amarillo 2010, pet. ref\u2019d,\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\funtimely filed); Wilson v. State, 777 S.W.2d 823, 825 (Tex.App.\u2014Austin 1989),\n\naff\u2019d, 853 S.W.2d 547 (Tex.Crim.App. 1993).\n\n      In the present case, looking at the evidence from the appellant\u2019s viewpoint,\n\nthe evidence failed to show a reasonable belief that he was in imminent danger. At\n\nthe time he fired the gun, the undisputed facts show that the appellant was driving\n\naway in a vehicle from a crowd that was pursuing him on foot (5 RR 132-5, 157-\n\n8). He was driving on a separate road, outside of the parking lot where the crowd\n\nremained (5 RR 133). And as he drove away from the crowd, no one got in a\n\nvehicle and no evidence was presented that the group would have been able to\n\ncatch the appellant in his vehicle as they pursued on foot. Although the appellant\n\nstated he felt vulnerable and threatened because the crowd was acting \u201cvicious\u201d\n\nand \u201cferocious\u201d towards him, he did not testify that he feared for his life or that\n\nfiring the gun was immediately necessary to protect himself from harm (5 RR 131-\n\n4). Moreover, in the three to five minutes he was in the parking lot, he testified that\n\nthere was no argument between the groups. And while he saw a gun, no one\n\npointed it at him or used it in a threatening manner (5 RR 133-4).\n\n      Additionally, the appellant\u2019s admission that he intended to fire over the\n\ncrowd, rather than into the crowd, shows that he did not think it was immediately\n\nnecessary to defend himself from another\u2019s use or potential use of deadly force (5\n\nRR 134-5). Rather, he testified that he wanted to \u201cfrighten the crowd to keep them\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\ffrom pursuing [him]\u201d (5 RR 135). Because he did not testify that he feared for his\n\nlife and firing a gun over a crowd of people to frighten them is not evidence of a\n\nbelief harm was imminent, no rational factfinder could have determined that the\n\nappellant\u2019s use of deadly force was immediately necessary. Thus, the court of\n\nappeals erred in holding that the appellant was entitled to an instruction on self-\n\ndefense.\n\n\n                        GROUND FOR REVIEW THREE\n\n      The trial court could determine as a matter of law that the victim was\n      an innocent third person under Section 9.05 of the Texas Penal Code\n      thus precluding an instruction on self-defense.\n\n      The lower courts of appeals are split in their treatment of Section 9.05 of the\n\nTexas Penal Code and its ability to preclude a self-defense instruction. Section 9.05\n\nlimits the justification of self-defense, indicating that a justification is\n\n\u201cunavailable\u201d if while using or threatening justified deadly force against another,\n\nthe defendant recklessly injures or kills an innocent third person. TEX. PENAL CODE\n\n\u00a7 9.05 (West 2011). Although it is clear that there is no justification corollary to the\n\ndoctrine of transferred intent, it is unclear how Section 9.05 applies. See TEX.\n\nPENAL CODE \u00a7 6.04 (West 2011).\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f       The statute neither defines \u201cunavailable\u201d nor \u201cinnocent third person.\u201d4 See\n\nTEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 9.05 (West 2011). More importantly, it is unclear who decides\n\nwhether a victim was an innocent bystander: is it a question of fact to be\n\ndetermined by the jury or a question of law to be determined by the trial judge. See\n\nid.\n\n       Some courts treat Section 9.05 as question of law to be determined by the\n\ntrial court in its role as a gatekeeper, barring a self-defense instruction. See Banks v.\n\nState, 955 S.W.2d 116, 119 (Tex.App.\u2014Fort Worth 1997, no pet.) (affirming trial\n\ncourt\u2019s decision not to include an instruction on self-defense because appellant\n\nkilled an innocent third person under Section 9.05); Vidal v. State, 418 S.W.3d 907,\n\n911 (Tex.App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet. ref\u2019d) (affirming trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision to exclude self-defense instruction because the complainant was an\n\ninnocent bystander under Section 9.05); Thomas v.

See Sparks v. State, 177 S.W.3d 127, 134 n. 5 (Tex.App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2005, no pet.) (holding that \u201c[w]hen the evidence raises the issue whether an\n\ninnocent third person was killed recklessly during a defendant\u2019s use of self-\n\ndefense, the trial court must first charge the jury on the law of [the] appellant\u2019s\n\nright to self-defense and then further charge the jury on the section 9.05 limitation\n\nconcerning reckless injury or death of an innocent third person.\u201d); Arias v. State,\n\n04-04-00247-CR, 2005 WL 1334536, at *5 (Tex.App.\u2014San Antonio June 8, 2005,\n\npet. ref\u2019d) (mem. op., not designated for publication) (holding that a jury\n\ninstruction on Section 9.05 as a limitation to the appellant\u2019s self-defense\n\njustification was proper).\n\n       The present case shows why guidance on this issue is needed. The court of\n\nappeals held that the trial judge could not determine if Section 9.05 applied as a\n\nmatter of law; that it was a question for the factfinder. Dugar, 2015 WL 1632690 at\n\n*12. But without evidence that Williams used deadly force, attempted to use\n\ndeadly force, or complied with another\u2019s use of deadly force, the trial court should\n\nbe able to determine as a matter of law whether he was an innocent bystander.5 See\n\n5\n As previously stated, no evidence was presented of Williams\u2019 actions (3 RR 105, 158, 181).\nMoreover, the appellant admitted that he killed Williams by accident (5 RR 158-59).\n\n                                              15\n\fBrown, 2010 WL 138331 at *1 (holding Section 9.05 applied when there was no\n\nevidence in the record that the complainant used or exhibited deadly force during\n\nthe altercation from a group at a bar which led to the fatal shooting; thus, appellant\n\nwas not entitled to a self-defense instruction).\n\n      Additionally, the lower court contradicts its previous holding in Vidal, where\n\nit held that Section 9.05 precluded an instruction on self-defense. Vidal, 418\n\nS.W.3d at 911. In Vidal, the appellant pushed the intended victim\u2019s truck into a\n\nditch causing injury to a child passenger. Vidal, 418 S.W.3d at 909-10. The lower\n\ncourt distinguishes Vidal on the facts stating that there was no dispute the child was\n\nan innocent third person. Dugar, 2015 WL 1632690 at *13. But Williams\u2019 actions\n\nare not different than the child-victim in Vidal, they both were merely present.\n\n      Moreover, the lower court concludes that even assuming Williams was an\n\ninnocent bystander the jury should still determine whether the appellant acted\n\nrecklessly in killing him, thereby determining whether his killing was justified.\n\nDugar, 2015 WL 1632690 at *12. But this conclusion is untenable. If the appellant\n\nintentionally killed an innocent third person it would be an unjustifiable homicide.\n\nSee TEX. PENAL CODE \u00a7 19.02 (West 2011). And to receive a self-defense\n\ninstruction for the use of a firearm against another, the defendant cannot claim an\n\naccidently firing; he must admit he intentionally fired the weapon. Shaw, 243\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fS.W.3d at 658. Therefore, because the lower courts are split on the treatment of\n\nSection 9.05 and need guidance, this Court should grant discretionary review.\n\n\n                        GROUND FOR REVIEW FOUR\n\n       The court of appeals erred in finding that the appellant was harmed\n      by the failure to include a self-defense instruction because evidence\n      sufficiently established beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no\n      justification for protection against deadly force.\n\n      The appellant was not harmed by any potential jury charge error based on\n\nthe lack of a multiple assailants self-defense instruction. The remainder of the jury\n\ncharge was correct, and the appellant did not complain about any other charge error\n\non appeal. The state of the evidence was strongly in favor of a conviction. The\n\nState\u2019s witnesses testified that, though they were upset, no threats were made or\n\nweapons drawn (3 RR 55-56, 103, 175). All witnesses were clear that Williams\n\nwas merely present on the scene at the time and had no altercation with the\n\nappellant (3 RR 105, 181; 5 RR 158). And the forensic evidence showed that\n\nWilliams was killed by a bullet from the appellant\u2019s gun (5 RR 30-32, 47).\n\n      The appellant testified he felt vulnerable, but the lower court recognized that\n\n\u201c[b]ecause [the] appellant gave more than one story of the events, his claim of self-\n\ndefense may not strike all as especially strong or convincing.\u201d Dugar, 2015 WL\n\n1632690 at *11. And other evidence supporting the appellant\u2019s fear of a group\n\nattack was vague testimony that the crowd as a whole was hostile (5 RR 101).\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\fMoreover, the appellant testified that he intended to only warn the crowd by\n\nshooting \u201cover\u201d it (5 RR 154-57). Therefore, no rational factfinder could determine\n\nthat the appellant reasonably believed he was in imminent danger. See Dickey, 22\n\nS.W.3d at 492-93 (holding there was no harm for exclusion of a multiple assailants\n\ninstruction because the evidence that the deceased and another were acting in\n\nconcert was ambiguous at best).\n\n      Finally, the lack of an instruction on self-defense did not foreclose all other\n\ndefenses. See Dugar, 2015 WL 1632690 at *16. The appellant still had evidence\n\nthat he fired over the crowd, which he could claim was not an act clearly\n\ndangerous to human life. Therefore, the appellant could not show that he was\n\nharmed by any error in the jury charge, and the court of appeals erred in holding to\n\nthe contrary.\n\n\n                             PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n      It is respectfully requested that this petition should be granted and that the\n\nopinion of the court of appeals should be reversed.\n\n\n\n                                                DEVON ANDERSON\n                                                District Attorney\n                                                Harris County, Texas\n\n                                                      /S/ _Katie Davis_________\n                                                      KATIE M.
