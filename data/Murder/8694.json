They each received enhanced\n\nsentences because they had each been convicted of an aggravated\n\nfelony prior to their deportation.              8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).      All four\n\nhere now challenge the voluntariness of their guilty pleas because\n\nthe trial court did not comply with the admonishment requirements\n\nof FED. R. CRIM. P. 11.      Because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s\n\nfailure to admonish the defendants of the nature of the charge, as\n\nrequired   by   Rule   11,   was    not       harmless   error,   we   vacate   the\n\nconviction and sentence of each defendant and remand these cases\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                               I.    BACKGROUND\n\n     Encarnacion Lujano-Perez was deported on April 29, 1999.\n\nWithout the Attorney General\u2019s permission, he reentered the United\n\nStates on May 2, 1999.          Border Patrol agents arrested him in\n\nLaredo, Texas, on March 30, 2000, and he was indicted for unlawful\n\nreentry on April 18, 2000. Prior to this deportation, Lujano-Perez\n\nhad been convicted in Florida for Attempted Sexual Battery of a\n\nChild.\n\n     Antonio Mata-Ortiz was deported on October 12, 1999.                 Without\n                                          3\n\fthe Attorney General\u2019s permission, he reentered the United States.\n\nBorder Patrol agents arrested him in Laredo, Texas, on March 26,\n\n2000, and he was indicted for unlawful reentry on April 18, 2000.\n\nPrior to his deportation, Mata-Ortiz had been convicted in Denton,\n\nTexas, for Aggravated Assault and Murder.\n\n      Juan Torres-Rodriguez was deported on June 24, 1999.        Without\n\nthe Attorney General\u2019s permission, he reentered the United States\n\non March 29, 2000.    Border Patrol agents arrested him in Laredo,\n\nTexas, on March 29, 2000, and he was indicted for unlawful reentry\n\non April, 18, 2000. Prior to his deportation, Torres-Rodriguez had\n\nbeen convicted in Palm Beach, Florida, for Cocaine Possession.\n\n      Jose Efrain Garcia-Luna was deported on February 12, 2000.\n\nWithout the Attorney General\u2019s permission, he reentered the United\n\nStates. Border Patrol agents arrested him in El Cenizo, Texas, and\n\nhe was indicted for unlawful reentry on April 4, 2000.           Prior to\n\nhis   deportation,   Garcia-Luna   had   been   convicted   in   Chicago,\n\nIllinois, for Delivery of a Controlled Substance.\n\n      All four defendants pleaded guilty to violating 8 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s prohibition on reentering the United States after\n\ndeportation without permission from the Attorney General.         Garcia-\n\nLuna was found guilty at a hearing before the district court on May\n\n22, 2000.   The other three defendants, Lujano-Perez, Mata-Ortiz,\n\nand Torres-Rodriguez, were found guilty at a hearing before the\n\nsame district court on May 23, 2000.\n\n      The defendants each appeal here, arguing that their pleas were\n\n                                   4\n\frendered involuntary by the district court\u2019s failure, at their\n\nrearraignment hearings, to properly admonish them of their rights\n\nas Rule 11 requires.          The government concedes that Rule 11 was not\n\ncomplied with, but nonetheless urges us to affirm the defendants\u2019\n\nconvictions because the district court\u2019s deviation from the rule\n\namounted to harmless error.\n\n\n\n                             1.   The May 22 Hearing\n\n     On May 22, 2000, Garcia-Luna, along with five other defendants\n\nunrelated      to     this    case,    appeared       and       participated    in     a\n\nrearraignment hearing before the district court.                    The judge began\n\nby addressing the whole group.                 First, he told the group that if\n\nthey could not understand the proceedings, they needed to let him\n\nknow because silence would be interpreted as understanding.\n\n     While still addressing the entire group, the judge then\n\nconfirmed that (1) the defendants wished to plead guilty; (2) the\n\ndefendants understood they were under oath; (3) the defendants\u2019\n\npleas   were    not    the    result      of    threats    or    coercion;    (4)    the\n\ndefendants had not taken drugs or alcohol within the prior 24\n\nhours; (5) the defendants did not have any mental or physical\n\nproblems    that      limited     their    ability    to    understand       what    was\n\nhappening; (6) the defendants had not been known by any names\n\ndifferent than those charged in the indictment; (7) the defendants\n\nunderstood their right to appointed counsel if they could not\n\nafford an attorney; (8) the defendants were satisfied with their\n                                            5\n\fattorneys; (9) the defendants understood their right to a jury\n\ntrial and the presumption of innocence; and (10) the defendants\n\nunderstood that pleading guilty waived their right to a jury trial.\n\n      The judge then addressed the defendants individually. When he\n\nreached Garcia-Luna\u2019s case, he asked the Assistant United States\n\nAttorney (AUSA) to present the court with the \u201cfactual basis\u201d of\n\nthe charge.       The AUSA described the circumstances of Garcia-Luna\u2019s\n\narrest, and       informed    the    court    that   Garcia-Luna   had    a   prior\n\naggravated felony conviction for the sale of cocaine.                    The court\n\nconfirmed the existence of the conviction with Garcia-Luna and then\n\nconfirmed that he understood, because he was an aggravated felon,\n\nthe maximum sentence he faced.            Finally, the court asked whether\n\nGarcia-Luna would like to say anything about the charge.                   Garcia-\n\nLuna answered with: \u201cEverything that is being said has already been\n\ngiven to my attorney.\u201d            The court then found him guilty.1\n\n\n\n                             2.    The May 23 Hearing\n\n      On    May    23,   2000,     Lujano-Perez,     Mata-Ortiz,   and     Torres-\n\nRodriguez, along with two other defendants unrelated to this case,\n\nappeared and participated in a rearraignment hearing before the\n\nsame district court. The judge again began by addressing the whole\n\ngroup.     First, he told the group that if they could not understand\n\nthe proceedings, they needed to let him know.                He also reminded\n\n  1\n   He was sentenced to 48 months\u2019 incarceration at a separate\nsentencing hearing on August 10, 2000.\n                                          6\n\fthem that, even though they were before the court as a group, they\n\nhad the right to an individual audience with their counsel, and\n\nexplained that they could ask the court questions about their case.\n\n     While still addressing the entire group, the judge then\n\nconfirmed that (1) the defendants wished to plead guilty; (2) the\n\ndefendants understood they were under oath; (3) the defendants had\n\nnot failed to disclose that they had been known by any names\n\ndifferent than those charged in the indictment; (4) the defendants\u2019\n\npleas were not the result of threats; (5) the defendants did not\n\nhave any medical or psychological problems that limited their\n\nability to understand what was happening; (6) the defendants\n\nunderstood their right to appointed counsel if they could not\n\nafford an attorney; (7) the defendants were satisfied with their\n\nattorneys; (8) the defendants understood their right to a jury\n\ntrial and the presumption of innocence; and (9) the defendants\n\nunderstood that pleading guilty waived their right to a jury trial.\n\n     The   judge   then   addressed   the   defendants   individually.\n\nBeginning with Torres-Rodriguez\u2019s case, he asked the AUSA for the\n\nfactual basis of the charge.    The AUSA described the circumstances\n\nof Torres-Rodriguez\u2019s arrest, and informed the court that he had\n\nseveral prior misdemeanor convictions and possibly an arrest for\n\nBurglary of a Habitation.      The court asked Torres-Rodriguez if,\n\naside from the allegations of previous misconduct, the rest of the\n\nAUSA\u2019s statement was correct.    Torres-Rodriguez replied: \u201cYes, but\n\nI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d The court again asked, and Torres-Rodriguez\n\n                                  7\n\fconfirmed, that he had returned to the United States without\n\npermission after being deported. Because the AUSA was unsure about\n\nTorres-Rodriguez\u2019s criminal history, it advised the court that he\n\nshould     be   admonished   about    the   maximum   penalty   range   for   a\n\nconvicted aggregated felon.          The court confirmed he understood the\n\npunishment range and then found him guilty.2\n\n      Next, the court addressed Mata-Ortiz. At the court\u2019s request,\n\nthe AUSA gave a brief factual statement about his arrest and\n\ninformed the court that he had prior convictions for Aggravated\n\nAssault and Murder.      The judge confirmed with Mata-Ortiz that the\n\nfactual statement was correct and that he understood the maximum\n\npossible sentence.      The court then found him guilty.3\n\n      Finally, the court addressed Lujano-Perez.            The AUSA gave a\n\nbrief factual statement about the circumstances of Lujano-Perez\u2019s\n\narrest, and informed the court that he had been convicted of\n\nBattery prior to his deportation. The court confirmed that Lujano-\n\nPerez understood the possible maximum penalty, and then found him\n\nguilty.4\n\n\n  2\n   At a sentencing hearing on August 14, 2000, the existence of a\nprior conviction for cocaine possession was confirmed, and he was\nsentenced to 46 months\u2019 incarceration for illegal reentry. The\ncourt also revoked his probation that he was serving for another\noffense and ordered him to serve an additional 3 months, to run\nconsecutive to his 46-month sentence.\n  3\n   At a sentencing hearing on August 9, 2000, he was sentenced to\n57 months\u2019 incarceration.\n  4\n    At a sentencing hearing on August 9, 2000, he was sentenced to\n70 months\u2019 incarceration.\n                                        8\n\f                                   II.     RULE 11\n\n       Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs\n\npleas.     And it sets forth the procedures the court must follow\n\nbefore     accepting      a   plea       of     guilty     or   nolo     contendere.\n\nSpecifically, the court must address the defendant personally in\n\nopen     court    to    explain,     and       ascertain    that   the    defendant\n\nunderstands, certain information and rights: the nature of the\n\ncharge; the mandatary minimum and maximum penalties (including any\n\nspecial parole or supervised release term); the fact that the court\n\nis required to consider sentencing guidelines, but may depart from\n\nthem   under     some   circumstances;         the   court\u2019s    ability    to   order\n\nrestitution to victims (when applicable); the defendant\u2019s right to\n\nan attorney at every stage of the proceeding (and the right to have\n\none appointed, if necessary); the defendant\u2019s right to plead not\n\nguilty; the defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial; the defendant\u2019s\n\nright at trial to assistance of counsel, to confront and cross-\n\nexamine adverse witnesses, and the right against compelled self-\n\nincrimination; that pleading guilty waives the right to trial; that\n\nanswers related to the plea, given to the court under oath, can be\n\nthe subject of a perjury charge; and the terms of any agreement\n\nwaiving the right to appeal or collaterally attack the sentence.\n\nThe court must also address the defendant personally in open court\n\nto determine that the plea is voluntary and not the result of\n\nthreats or coercion. Finally, the court is required to ask whether\n\nthe plea is the result of negotiations with the government\u2019s\n                                           9\n\fattorney.     The court may not accept a guilty plea unless it\n\ndetermines, after inquiry, that there is an adequate \u201cfactual\n\nbasis\u201d for the plea.\n\n       Any variance from these procedures is subject to a harmless-\n\nerror analysis, FED. R. CRIM. PROC. 11(h), and we review such\n\nchallenges de novo. United States v. Cuevas-Andrade, 232 F.3d 440,\n\n443 (5th Cir. 2000).         Specifically, we look to whether (1) the\n\ntrial court failed to comply with the rule, and (2) if so, whether\n\nthis noncompliance affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights such\n\nthat    \u201cknowledge     and   comprehension   of   the    full   and   correct\n\ninformation would have been likely to affect his willingness to\n\nplead guilty.\u201d   United States v. Johnson, 1 F.3d 296, 302 (5th Cir.\n\n1993) (en banc).\n\n\n\n                                III.   ANALYSIS\n\n       Here, there is no dispute that the trial court did not comply\n\nwith Rule 11.        The record reflects that the court failed to:\n\naddress the defendants personally in open court; explain the nature\n\nof the charge; explain the effect of any supervised release term;\n\nexplain   that   the    court   was    required   to    consider   applicable\n\nsentencing guidelines, but could depart from those in certain\n\ncircumstances; explain the defendants\u2019 right to plead not guilty;\n\nexplain the defendants\u2019 right to be tried by a jury; explain that\n\nat trial the defendants had the right to an attorney; inform the\n\n\n                                       10\n\fdefendants of their right against self incrimination at their\n\ntrial; address each defendant personally to ascertain that his plea\n\nwas not the result of threats or coercion; and inquire whether the\n\ndefendants\u2019    guilty   pleas      were    the   result   of   negotiations     or\n\ndiscussions with the government.\n\n     The defendants limit their complaints here to the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s failure to explain: the nature of the charge; the right to\n\nplead not guilty; the right to a jury trial; the right to counsel\n\nat trial; and the right against compelled self incrimination.\n\nAccordingly, any complaints about the other variations are waived.\n\nSee Yohey v. Collins, 985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\n                        The Nature of the Charge\n\n     Rule 11's requirement that defendants understand the \u201cnature\n\nof the charge\u201d against them refers to the elements of the offense.\n\nUnited States v. Calderon, 243 F.3d 587, 589 (5th Cir. 2001).\n\nHere, the record reflects that the elements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, the\n\nstatute the defendants were charged with violating, were never\n\ndiscussed during the plea hearings.              Further, the indictment was\n\nnot read, and there were no written plea agreements.               Nonetheless,\n\nthe government asserts that its recital of the \u201cfactual basis,\u201d\n\nalong   with   the   fact   that    the    charge   is    simple   and   easy   to\n\nunderstand, renders the court\u2019s failure to explain the nature of\n\nthe charge harmless error.         We disagree.\n\n     This Circuit has never found that recitation of a \u201cfactual\n\n\n                                          11\n\fbasis,\u201d which is a distinct and separate requirement under Rule 11,\n\nobliterated the need to ensure that a defendant understands the\n\nnature of the charge.   Rather, in every case where we have found\n\nthe failure to explain the nature of the charge to be harmless,\n\nthere has been evidence, other than recitation of the factual\n\nbasis, indicating that the defendant understood the nature of the\n\ncharge.   See, e.g., Cuevas-Andrade, 232 F.3d at 444 (holding\n\nfailure to explain nature of charge harmless because the indictment\n\nwas read to the defendant, the defendant signed a written plea\n\nagreement listing the elements of the charge, and the defendant\u2019s\n\nattorney reviewed the charges with the defendant); United States v.\n\nSmith, 184 F.3d 415, 417 (5th Cir. 1999) (holding failure to\n\nexplain nature of charge harmless because the indictment was read\n\nto the defendant, and her attorney stated that he had reviewed the\n\nindictment and charges with her and that she understood them and\n\nvoluntary pleaded guilty); United States v. Reyna, 130 F.3d 104,\n\n111 (5th Cir. 1997) (holding failure to explain nature of charge\n\nharmless because the indictment was read to the defendant, the\n\ndefendant stated he understood the charges, and the court asked the\n\ndefendant several questions about his understanding of the nature\n\nof the offense); United States v. Guichard, 779 F.2d 1139, 1145-46\n\n(5th Cir. 1986) (holding failure to explain nature of charge\n\nharmless because the indictment was read to the defendant, the\n\ndefendant stated he had discussed charges with his attorney, and\n\n\n                                12\n\fthe court inquired about the defendant\u2019s understanding of the\n\ncharge).\n\n     In support of its argument, the government relies almost\n\nexclusively on one First Circuit case.   United States v. Martinez-\n\nMartinez, 69 F.3d 1215 (1st Cir. 1995).      In Martinez, the court\n\nnoted that the trial court\u2019s failure to explain the nature of the\n\ncharges \u201cstretched the outer boundaries of Rule 11's express\n\nmandate,\u201d but, nonetheless, it found the failure to be harmless\n\nerror.     Id. at 1222.   It explained that \u201c[r]ather than exalting\n\nform over substance, on appeal we employ a \u2018totality of the\n\ncircumstances\u2019 test to determine if a core violation has indeed\n\noccurred.\u201d    Id. at 1220.\n\n     The government here emphasizes the Martinez court\u2019s statement\n\nthat \u201c[i]f, during the plea colloquy, the government\u2019s statement or\n\nthe defendant\u2019s own version of the facts sets forth all elements\n\nand conduct of the offense, admission to that conduct sufficiently\n\nestablishes the defendant\u2019s understanding of the charge.\u201d    Id. at\n\n1220.    However, a closer look at the case shows that, even though\n\nthe court stated that recitation of a factual basis was enough to\n\nrender the failure to explain the charge harmless, the court did\n\nnot rely solely on this fact.     Rather, the court emphasized that\n\n(1) Martinez acknowledged twice during the plea hearing that she\n\nhad discussed the charges with her counsel and understood them, (2)\n\nshe waited to plead guilty until the day of trial (after months of\n\n\n                                  13\n\ftrial preparation), (3) she signed a written plea agreement, and\n\n(4) the court did ask her if she had read the charges and consulted\n\nwith her counsel about them.       Id. at 1221-22.\n\n     Here, in contrast with the facts in Martinez, it is undisputed\n\nthat neither the judge nor the prosecutor described the elements of\n\nthe charge; the indictment was not read; and the judge did not ask\n\nthe defendants whether they understood the charges.           Thus, none of\n\nthe safeguards were in place that we have in the past held might\n\nrender a judge\u2019s failure to personally apprise the defendant of the\n\nnature of the charge nonetheless harmless.        Accordingly, the sole\n\nbasis for us to find harmless error would be that the AUSA recited\n\nthe factual basis for the charges.\n\n     However, Rule 11 requires both that the judge explain the\n\nnature of the charge, FED. R. CRIM. P. 11(c)(1), and that the judge\n\nascertain that there is a factual basis for the charge.               FED. R.\n\nCRIM. P. 11(f). Consequently, if we were to hold, as the government\n\nurges us to, that wholly failing to admonish defendants of the\n\nnature   of   the   charge   is   harmless   whenever   the   trial    court\n\nestablishes a factual basis, we would, in essence, obliterate the\n\nneed to ever comply with Rule 11's express requirement that the\n\ncourt explain the nature of the charge.          This we decline to do.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court\u2019s failure to admonish the\n\n\n\n\n                                     14\n\fdefendants of the nature of the charge was harmful error.5\n\n      We also take this opportunity to reiterate that, although\n\nnoncompliance with Rule 11 is subject to harmless-error review, the\n\nimportance of adhering to all Rule 11's requirements cannot be\n\noverstated.   Indeed, when the harmless-error subdivision (h) was\n\nadded to Rule 11, the Advisory Committee cautioned that:\n\n           [S]ubdivision (h) should not be read as an\n           invitation to trial judges to take a more casual\n           approach to Rule 11 proceedings. It is still true,\n           as the Supreme Court pointed out in McCarthy, that\n           thoughtful and careful compliance with Rule 11 best\n           serves   the   cause    of   fair   and   efficient\n           administration of criminal justice, as it \u201cwill\n           help reduce the great waste of judicial resources\n           required to process the frivolous attacks on guilty\n           plea convictions that are encouraged, and are more\n           difficult to dispose of, when the original record\n           is inadequate. It is, therefore, not too much to\n           require that, before sentencing defendants to years\n           of imprisonment, district judges take the few\n           minutes necessary to inform them of their rights\n           and to determine whether they understand the action\n           they are taking.\u201d\n\nFED. R. CRIM. P. 11 (advisory committee\u2019s notes to 1983 amendment)\n\n\n\n  5\n      We note that this result is consistent with the Advisory\nCommittee Notes to Rule 11, which state that:\n\n      There would not be harmless error under subdivision (h)\n      where, for example, as in McCarthy, there had been\n      absolutely no inquiry by the judge into defendant\u2019s\n      understanding of the nature of the charge and the\n      harmless error claim of the government rests upon nothing\n      more than the assertion that it may be \u201cassumed\u201d\n      defendant possessed such understanding merely because he\n      expressed a desire to plead guilty.\n\nFED. R. CRIM. P. 11 (advisory committee\u2019s notes to 1983 amendment)\n(citing McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459 (1969)).\n                                 15\n\f(quoting McCarthy, 394 U.S. at 472).\n\n\n\n                         IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n     Because our conclusion that the trial court\u2019s failure to\n\nexplain the nature of the charge mandates reversal, we need not\n\nreach the defendants\u2019 contention that other portions of the plea\n\ncolloquy were also deficient.   The conviction and sentence of each\n\ndefendant is vacated and remanded to the trial court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 16\n\fEDITH H. JONES, dissenting:\n\n          With due respect, my colleagues\u2019 conclusion that a single\n\ntechnical Rule 11 omission by the district court is not harmless error\n\nreturns us to the law as it was nine years ago, before this court took\n\nRule 11(h) seriously.6   Until the en banc decision in United States\n\nv. Johnson, 1 F.3d 296-302, (5th Cir. 1993) (en banc), this court\n\nevaluated Rule 11 compliance in terms of three \u201ccore concerns,\u201d the\n\nomission of any one of which would automatically result in the vacatur\n\nof a guilty plea.    United States v. Dayton, 604 F.2d 931 (5th Cir.\n\n1979) (en banc).    One of Dayton\u2019s \u201ccore concerns,\u201d the one at issue\n\nhere, was that the court must address a defendant concerning the\n\nnature of the charge against him.      Fed. Crim. Rule Proc. 11(c)(1).\n\nJohnson involved another of the core concerns, but this court rejected\n\nDayton\u2019s per se approach in favor of the harmless error analysis\n\nspecified by Rule 11(h).   The Johnson test, given lip service by the\n\nmajority, identifies reversible Rule 11 error only if the court\u2019s non-\n\ncompliance affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights such that his\n\n\u201cknowledge and comprehension of the full and correct information would\n\n\n\n\n     6\n       Appellants also complain that the district court omitted from\n  its guilty plea advice other information required by Rule 11, e.g.\n  the defendant\u2019s right to plead not guilty and proceed to a jury\n  trial, to counsel at trial, to confront witnesses, and not to\n  incriminate himself. The majority do not discuss these omissions.\n  I would find them insufficient to overturn the guilty plea, based\n  on the whole record and the analysis in United States v. Cuevas-\n  Andrade, 232 F.3d 440 (5th Cir. 2000).\n                                  17\n\fhave been likely to affect his willingness to plead guilty.\u201d            1 F.3d\n\nat 302.\n\n          The majority opinion dwells on the trial court\u2019s admitted\n\nnon-compliance     with   Rule   11,   but   it   never   discusses   how   the\n\nappellants\u2019 substantial rights were violated by the court\u2019s failure\n\nto read them their indictments or otherwise explain the charge of\n\nillegal reentry.    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326.        There is no basis in the record\n\nfor a conclusion that, had appellants been specifically informed at\n\nthe plea colloquy of the nature of a \u00a7 1326 violation, they would not\n\nhave pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\n\n          The majority assert that the \u201csole\u201d basis for a finding of\n\nharmless error is the Assistant U.S. Attorney\u2019s recitation of the\n\nfactual basis of the charge at the guilty plea colloquy.                    This\n\nassertion suffers from two flaws.       It misstates Johnson, which holds\n\nthat the entire trial court record must be consulted to evaluate the\n\neffect of a Rule 11 error.       1 F.3d at 302.    It also misapprehends the\n\nrecord.   These appellants certainly knew what charge they were\n\npleading guilty to.\n\n          The crime of illegal reentry is not recondite.          It consists\n\nof a person\u2019s being found in the United States without the permission\n\nof the Attorney General after having been previously deported.              All\n\nfour appellants responded affirmatively to the court\u2019s introductory\n\nquery whether they wished to plead guilty.                The factual resum\u00e9s\n\nrecited by an    AUSA at the court\u2019s request embody the simple elements\n\nof a \u00a7 1326 violation for each appellant.\n\n                                       18\n\f          As to Garcia-Luna, the AUSA stated:\n\n     Mr. Garcia Luna is a native and citizen of Mexico, Your\n     Honor. He was encountered by Border Patrol wading the \u2013 or\n     crossing the Rio Grande River at a location near El Cenizo,\n     Texas, at about 10:00 in the morning on March the 9th,\n     2000, entering without immigration inspection. He has \u2013\n     records show that he has been previously deported from\n     Laredo on February the 12th, 2000. He has \u2013 records show\n     that he has not applied for or received permission from the\n     attorney general to re-enter the United States. We believe\n     Mr. Garcia is an aggravated felon. His criminal history\n     includes a 1995 conviction for sale of cocaine. He was\n     sentenced to 12 years in that offense.\n\nGarcia-Luna admitted his crime in the plea colloquy.\n\n          The facts pertaining to Torres-Rodriguez, as recited by the\n\nAUSA, are as follows:\n\n     The defendant is a citizen and national of Mexico.       On\n     March 29th of this year he was apprehended by Border Patrol\n     at the river banks here in Laredo, Texas.      He had just\n     crossed. On June 24, 1999, he was deported back to Mexico\n     through Laredo. This was subsequent to several misdemeanor\n     convictions for theft out of Travis County.        It also\n     appears that he was arrested for a burglary of a\n     habitation. I don\u2019t know what has happened with that case,\n     Your Honor.    I can\u2019t tell from my file.       He has not\n     received permission to re-enter or reapply for readmission\n     to enter the United States from the attorney general.\n\nTorres admitted that the factual basis was true.\n\n          The factual basis for Mata was given by the government:\n\n     His true name, Your Honor, is Turruviartez-Sanchez. He is\n     a native and citizen of the Republic of Mexico. He was\n     apprehended by Border Patrol agents performing line-watch\n     duty near Laredo Community College on the 26th of March of\n     this year at about 10:00 p.m. just at the time of this\n     entry. He was previously deported through Laredo on the\n     12th of October of 1999. And he had neither applied for\n     nor received permission of the attorney general to re-enter\n     after deportation.\n\n     We believe he qualifies as an aggravated felon.       His\n     criminal history includes a 1992 aggravated assault and a\n\n                                 19\n\f     1995 murder intending serious bodily injury for which he\n     served time in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\n     Institution.\n\nMata admitted the truth of the facts concerning his reentry.\n\n           The Government gave the following factual basis for Lujano-\n\nPerez:\n\n     Mr. Lujano-Perez is also a native and citizen of the\n     Republic of Mexico, Your Honor. He was apprehended on the\n     30th of March of this year at 11:00 p.m. by Border Patrol\n     agents. They were following up on a tip that the defendant\n     was an illegal alien living in the Santa Fe subdivision of\n     Laredo, Texas, and working at a restaurant called Las\n     Asadas. He confirmed his illegal status and admitted he\n     had last entered the United States on the 2nd of May of\n     1999 by making a false claim of United States citizenship\n     at the port of entry, bridge number two, here in Laredo.\n     He was last deported on the 29th of April through Laredo\n     and has neither applied for nor received permission of the\n     attorney general to re-enter after that deportation.\n     [emphasis added.]\n\n     We do believe he qualifies as an aggravated felon. His\n     criminal history includes a battery for which he received\n     a 15-year sentence and a number of prior crimes for which\n     the dispositions are not known by the investigating\n     officers.\n\nLujano acknowledged the truth of the facts regarding his illegal\n\nentry.    Based on the simplicity of the charge, and the appellants\u2019\n\nunderstanding,   emphasized   by   the   court,   that   they   could   seek\n\nclarification at any time, it is a close question whether these\n\nfactual resum\u00e9s alone sufficiently identified the nature of the\n\ncharge.   This court has noted that, \u201c[n]either Rule 11 nor the case\n\nlaw specifies the minimum that the district court must do to \u2018inform\n\nthe defendant . . . of the nature of the charge\u2019\u201d.       United States v.\n\nReyna, 130 F.3d 104, 110 (5th Cir. 1997).\n\n\n                                   20\n\f          The record is rife with additional confirmation of the\n\nappellants\u2019 knowing intent to plead guilty to the crime with which\n\nthey were charged.    All of the appellants were represented by the\n\nFederal Public Defender.    This court should be able to rely on the\n\npublic defender\u2019s expertise in advising their clients.               We should\n\nassume that where, as here, each defendant admitted to the judge that\n\nhe committed the acts that form the basis of an illegal re-entry, he\n\ndid so on the advice of competent counsel.           None of the defendants\n\nraised a peep when the court asked if they were satisfied with their\n\ncounsel and if they were under any compulsion to plead guilty.              In\n\nfact, defense counsel raised no objections to the factual resum\u00e9s\n\nrecited by the AUSA\u2019s, to the clients\u2019 assent to the resum\u00e9s, or to\n\nthe crime summaries contained in each appellant\u2019s PSR.           No defense\n\ncounsel called the trial court\u2019s attention to its omissions from the\n\nprecise Rule 11 \u201cscript.\u201d More to the point, no defense counsel moved\n\nin the trial court to withdraw his client\u2019s guilty plea on the basis\n\nof ignorance or involuntariness.\n\n          Finally,   each   of   the    defendants   appended   an    explicit\n\nadmission of guilt to his PSR in order to qualify for a 3-level\n\nreduction in the sentencing guidelines, a reduction granted by the\n\ncourt.7   Since none of the defendants received anywhere near the\n\n\n     7\n       One example of these statements was executed on behalf of\n  Lujano-Perez:\n\n        I, Encarnacion Lujano-Perez, admit that I am an alien that\n     entered the United States without obtaining permission from the\n     Attorney General of the United States.     I admit that I was\n                                       21\n\fmaximum 20-year statutory sentence for his admitted offense, and all\n\nwere sentenced at the bottom of the guidelines range, there is no\n\nobjective    basis    for    dissatisfaction   with     the   outcome   of   the\n\nprosecution.   Indeed, it cannot be emphasized too strongly that none\n\nof the appellants contends he would have insisted on going to trial\n\nif he had been explicitly informed by the court of the \u201cnature\u201d of a\n\nsection 1326 charge.\n\n            Rather than examine the objective circumstances surrounding\n\nthe trial court\u2019s errors, the majority express fear that allowing the\n\nfactual resum\u00e9       to   fulfill   the function   of   the   nature-of-charge\n\nexplanation will \u201cobliterate\u201d a particular requirement of Rule 11.\n\nBut their holding threatens to \u201cobliterate\u201d Rule 11(h) and the Johnson\n\nharmless error test: harmless error comes into play whenever a trial\n\ncourt has \u201cobliterated\u201d some facet of Rule 11.\n\n            The majority suggest in a footnote that their analysis\n\ncomports with the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 11, which eschew\n\na harmless error claim where \u201cthe government rests upon nothing more\n\nthan the assertion that it may be \u2018assumed\u2019 defendant possessed such\n\nunderstanding [of the charge against him] merely because he expressed\n\na desire to plead guilty.\u201d Majority Opn. at n.5, citing Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 11 (advisory committee notes to 1983 amendment).            But as has been\n\n\n\n     deported before I re-entered the United States.            I was found by\n     a U.S. Border Patrol Agent in Laredo, Texas.\n\n     And at sentencing, Garcia-Luna apologized for having \u201centered\n  illegally into the country.\u201d\n                                       22\n\fdemonstrated, the government does not rely solely on these appellants\u2019\n\nexpressed desire to plead guilty, but upon many other indicia of their\n\nknowledge and understanding that they committed the federal crime of\n\nillegal re-entry. The same Advisory Committee Notes also caution that\n\nRule 11 does not prescribe a \u201clitany or other ritual which can be\n\ncarried out only by word-for-word adherence to a set \u2018script.\u2019\u201d   Id.\n\nSee also United States v. Henry, 113 F.3d 37, 41 (5th Cir 1997) (Rule\n\n11 does not require ritual adherence to its precise contours for a\n\nguilty plea to be upheld.)\n\n          This court has frequently addressed the sufficiency of Rule\n\n11 colloquies following Johnson.    In a few decisions, we have found\n\nthat a defendant\u2019s substantial rights were violated by errors such as\n\nserious, prejudicial misinformation about the punishment range or the\n\nomission of a minimum prison term.8     No post-Johnson case I have\n\nfound, published or unpublished, isolates one technical omission and\n\nholds it a reversible error without assessing the objective, likely\n\neffect on the appellant\u2019s willingness to plead guilty in light of the\n\nwhole trial court record. On the contrary, even a series of technical\n\nomissions has been found harmless under the circumstances.     United\n\nStates v. Cuevas-Andrade, 232 F.3d 440 (5th Cir. 2000). And in United\n\nStates v. Vasquez-Bernal, 197 F.3d 169 (5th Cir. 1999), where the\n\n\n     8\n       See United States v. Herndon, 7 F.3d 55 (5th Cir. 1993);\n  United States v. Whyte, 3 F.3d 129 (5th Cir. 1993); see also United\n  States v. Suarez, 155 F.3d 521 (5th Cir. 19998) (defendant\u2019s\n  statement during rearraignment that he was \u201conly guilty of\n  possession\u201d suggested he did not understand that he was charged\n  with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute).\n                                   23\n\ftrial court failed to expressly advise an illegal re-entrant of the\n\napplicable range of punishment, this court held that without proof,\n\nor even an allegation, that the omission affected his guilty plea, the\n\nRule 11 complaint was meritless.   See also United States v. Moralez-\n\nSosa, 191 F.3d 586, 587-88 (5th Cir. 1999) (\u201cSosa has never alleged\n\nthat full compliance with Rule 11 would have affected his decision to\n\nplead guilty, nor does the record support such a suggestion.\u201d).\n\n          The purpose of these appeals is difficult to discern. While\n\nI heartily agree that it is better practice for the district court to\n\nadhere closely to Rule 11, I also find it inconceivable that these\n\nappellants will not plead guilty upon remand. The public defender has\n\nmade no effort to demonstrate substantial harm to these appellants\u2019\n\nrights from the trial court\u2019s technical Rule 11 errors.   Moreover, we\n\nwere assured by an AUSA at oral argument that procedures are now in\n\nplace to advise the district court of omissions in Rule 11 colloquies.\n\nAs we said in Vasquez-Bernal, \u201cthe federal public defender must have\n\nbetter things to do.\u201d   I respectfully DISSENT.\n\n\n\n\n                                   24\n\f",
