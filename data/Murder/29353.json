Contrary to the provisions of CiviF Rule 78.01, V.A.M.R. (\u201cEvery order allowing a new trial shall specify of record the ground or grounds on which said new trial is granted\u201d), the trial court sustained the state\u2019s motion for new trial without specifying any of the fourteen assignments of error set forth in its motion. Since \u201cit shall never be presumed that the new trial was granted on any discretionary grounds\u201d (Civil Rule 83.06(c)) and \u201cthe presumption shall be that the trial court erroneously granted the motion for new trial\u201d (Civil Rule 83.06(b)) the state has assumed the burden of sustaining the court\u2019s action. In recognition of the rules and its burden the state does \u201cnot raise any discretionary grounds\u201d but asserts that the court erred as a matter of law in striking and later admitting for the jury\u2019s consideration the testimony of its witness, expert appraiser Frank DeGear.\nIn brief these are the background circumstances: Mr. Hovis, age 78, owned a farm consisting of 487 acres near Frederick-town in Madison County. He moved onto the land as a tenant in 1916, purchased 211 acres of the tract in 1938 and the remaining 276 acres in 1945. In that year he built a six-room house with bath, furnace and basement. In relocating and rebuilding U. S. Route 67 as a limited access four-lane highway the state condemned 34.73 acres of the Hovis farm. The road was so constructed that 305 acres were, as one wit*131ness said, \u201csevered from the other land,\u201d leaving approximately 147 acres on the left side of the highway. Among other items considered by the witnesses was the fact that the highway necessitated the construction of 10,000 feet of fencing, a large ever-running spring was destroyed, the barn had to be moved and a new cattle chute had to be constructed. The landowners produced three expert witnesses, at least two of them residents of Madison County, who fixed the before and after v\u00e1lues and damages at $41,320.00, $24,170.00, $17,210.00; $43,200.00, $24,000.00, $19,250.-00, and $43,500.00, $26,050.00, and $17,450.00, respectively. Mr. Hovis fixed the values and damages at $45,000.00 before the taking and $25,000.00 after and his damages at $20,000.00. The state produced two expert witnesses, one from Sikeston and the other, Dub Crutcher, from Essex who fixed the values and damages at these sums \u2014$22,685.00 before the taking, $17,635.00 after, damages $5,055.00, and $19,070.00, $13,217.00 and $5,823.00 respectively.\nThe state\u2019s third witness was Mr. De-Gear, age 70, who fixed these values and losses to the Hovis farm, $25,045.00, $22,548.00 and $5,563.00. While he qualified as an appraiser he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been a lumberman and contractor outside of the seven years, I was a flour miller at that time, but my last 40 years has been in one spot. * * * As a contractor and a retail lumber man.\u201d The land was condemned as of April 8, 1962, and the witnesses in testifying in December 1966, gave their opinion of values, of course, as of April 1962. It developed that Mr. DeGear had not been employed by the state until November 15, 1966, and did not make his appraisal until after that date, about ten days prior to the trial. On cross-examination landowners\u2019 counsel observed that Mr. De-Gear had \u201ctestified from figures\u201d and he asked to see them, state\u2019s counsel objected as \u201cwork product\u201d and a colloquy ensued and state\u2019s counsel said, \u201cHe has a sort of a, it\u2019s this kind of folder, he opened it up and looked at notes and things he has in here, yes, sir. Part of it\u2019s work product and part of it\u2019s work product for the State Highway Department giving him the various information he needs and things of that kind.\u201d At this point the court ruled that landowners\u2019 counsel could not have the folder. Then in further cross-examination as to Mr. DeGear\u2019s personal knowledge of the type of building and improvements he said, \u201cI have a list of them now. Q. Who gave you that list ? A. Nobody gave them to me, I acquired them.\u201d And finally he said that he acquired \u201cthem\u201d from \u201can appraiser that made an appraisal on it,\u201d Silas Dees who did not testify. He insisted that he had personally checked the buildings and he knew they were the same from \u201ca photograph of some of them.\u201d And he got the photograph in \u201c(a) kit that Silas had.\u201d Counsel again asked to see the kit and state\u2019s counsel again objected \u201cit\u2019s a work product of Silas Dees an appraiser of the State Highway Department.\u201d Based on counsel\u2019s statement landowners\u2019 counsel objected that the kit was \u201chearsay\u201d and he said, \u201cthis man is testifying from hearsay and I ask all of his testimony be stricken from the record and the jury advised to disregard it. It\u2019s based on hearsay and wholly incompetent.\u201d The court responded: \u201cSustained. Jury disregard this man\u2019s testimony.\u201d State\u2019s counsel then again examined the witness and developed that he had a personal acquaintance with the Hovis property in 1962 and he requested the court ruling striking DeGear\u2019s testimony be \u201cwithdrawn and that the jury be instructed that he is a competent witness under all the testimony.\u201d The court said, \u201cI\u2019ll deny that. Call your next witness please.\u201d The state had no other witnesses, the landowners called two witnesses in brief rebuttal and then the court of its own motion addressed the jury: \u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, we have reviewed a certain portion of the transcript, on account of a ruling, the Court made on a motion after reviewing the transcript we found the ruling, the Court made was incorrect. You are, at this time, instructed by the Court to consider the testimony of Mr. DeGear. He was a *132competent witness and he was qualified to give the testimony that he gave.\u201d There was no response to this ruling by state\u2019s counsel, the instructions were read and the trial proceeded.\nDespite the court\u2019s instruction to the jury the state insists that the court\u2019s ruling was nevertheless erroneous and prejudicial as a matter of law and that the court\u2019s final ruling did not cure the error. It is said that the court\u2019s ruling was an erroneous application of the hearsay rule and \u201cwas based on the erroneous mistake of law.\u201d The state cites no precisely applicable cases in support of its argument but relies on rules which it says by analogy should govern here. It is not necessary to distinguish these cases in detail, they are Jones v. Terminal R.R. Ass\u2019n of St. Louis, Mo.App., 246 S.W.2d 356; Dorn v. St. Louis Public Service Co., Mo.App., 250 S.W.2d 859, and City of Gallatin ex rel. Dixon v. Murphy, Mo.App., 217 S.W.2d 400. The latter case was a suit on the official bond of a town marshal for shooting and killing the plaintiff\u2019s husband in an attempt to arrest him. The plaintiff called the defendant marshal as a witness and established the basic circumstances of the killing. Then the plaintiff called a witness who testified that the marshal\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity was bad. When asked about his personal feelings toward the defendant marshal the witness said, \u201cWhy he is all right only he ain\u2019t honest, that\u2019s all.\u201d Then it developed that the witness\u2019 unfavorable opinion grew out of the fact that many years before he had loaned the marshal $50.00 \u201cTo pay himself out of the Maysville jail\u201d and had never been repaid. The next day the court instructed the jury \u201cthat you will entirely disregard and hold for naught the entire testimony of the witness Harrison Worrell, in so far as it pertains to the character or reputation of the defendant City Marshal.\u201d The court denied defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial. Upon appeal the court applied the rule that \u201c(a) party cannot directly impeach his own witness even though he be the other party to the suit.\u201d And the court concluded, \u201cIn a close case, such as the one with which we are dealing, the withdrawal of incompetent evidence, or the court\u2019s instruction to the jury to disregard it, does not cure the error in admitting it in the first instance.\u201d\nThe incident complained of here was not so manifestly inflammatory or \u201cthis infraction (was) so reprehensible and damaging as to require appellate interference.\u201d Jones v. Terminal R.R. Ass\u2019n of St. Louis, Mo.App., 246 S.W.2d l. c. 361. Aside from the problem of whether the court in fact ruled on the qualification of the witness, a discretionary matter, the witness was not conspicuously qualified and his evidence was but corroborative of the state\u2019s other two witnesses. In any event it may not be said, to avoid the force and effect of Civil Rules 78.01 and 83.06, that as a matter of law the state is entitled to a new trial. In the circumstances here the applicable principle is that \u201c(t)he exclusion of testimony when first offered is not erroneous where the record shows that it was later admitted,\u201d particularly when there has been no manifest prejudice (5 Am.Jur.2d Appeal &amp; Error, Sec. 806, p. 248) by the court\u2019s ruling, Shelby County R-IV School District v. Herman, Mo., 392 S.W.2d 609, 616-617; State ex rel. State Highway Comm. v. Devenyns, Mo.App., 179 S.W.2d 740, 741, both condemnation cases.\nIn accordance with these views the order granting a new trial is reversed and the cause remanded with directions to reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict and enter a judgment in favor of the landowners.\nSTOCKARD and PRITCHARD, CC, concur.\nPER CURIAM.\nThe foregoing opinion by BARRETT, C., is adopted as the opinion of the court.\nAll of the Judges concur.\n",
