See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546. We affirm.\n\n     Following a non-jury trial, Stewart was convicted of first-degree murder.\n\nThe trial court sentenced Stewart to life in prison without parole. This Court\n\naffirmed Stewart\u2019s judgment of sentence, and on August 20, 2001, the\n\nPennsylvania    Supreme    Court   denied    allowance   of   appeal.    See\n\nCommonwealth v. Stewart, 777 A.2d 510 (Pa. Super. 2001) (unpublished\n\nmemorandum), appeal denied, 784 A.2d 117 (Pa. 2001).\n\n     Following numerous unsuccessful PCRA petitions, on April 22, 2019,\n\nStewart filed a pro se \u201cMotion to Open and Vacate Order/Sentence Pursuant\n\nto [42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5505],\u201d which the PCRA court treated as a PCRA Petition,\n\fJ-S05035-20\n\n\n\nand subsequently denied without a hearing.1        Stewart filed a timely Notice\n\nof Appeal.    The PCRA court filed an Order, pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b),\n\ndirecting Stewart to file a concise statement of matters complained of on\n\nappeal.\n\n       On appeal, Stewart presents the following questions for our review:\n\n       I. Whether the [PCRA] court abused its discretion in denying relief\n       [under 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5505]?\n\n       II. Whether a petitioner can be \u201ctime barred\u201d while on a pending\n       collateral appeal?\n\n       III. Whether the PCRA court & Superior Court erred in its decision\n       to deny second PCRA, when other courts recognize and \u201cgrant\n       relief\u201d in similarly situated cases?\n\nBrief for Appellant at 3 (brackets and capitalization omitted).\n\n                We review an order [denying] a petition under the PCRA in\n       the light most favorable to the prevailing party at the PCRA level.\n       This review is limited to the findings of the PCRA court and the\n       evidence of the record. We will not disturb a PCRA court\u2019s ruling\n       if it is supported by evidence of record and is free of legal error.\n\nCommonwealth v. Ford, 44 A.3d 1190, 1194 (Pa. Super. 2012) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n       Initially, our review of the record discloses that Stewart never filed a\n\ncourt-ordered Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise statement. See Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b).\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 The PCRA court failed to issue a Pa.R.Crim.P. 907 notice before denying\nrelief. Nevertheless, Stewart failed to raise this issue on appeal. Further, this\nomission is not reversible error where, as here, \u201cthe record is clear that the\npetition is untimely,\u201d and no timeliness exceptions were invoked.\nCommonwealth v. Zeigler, 148 A.3d 849, 852 n.2 (Pa. Super. 2016).\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S05035-20\n\n\nThus,    Stewart\u2019s   claims   are   waived.   See Pa.R.A.P.     1925(b)(4)(vii);\n\nCommonwealth v. Castillo, 888 A.2d 775, 780 (Pa. 2005) (stating that\n\n\u201c[a]ny issues not raised in a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement will be deemed\n\nwaived.\u201d); see also Commonwealth v. Mason, 130 A.3d 601, 635-36 (Pa.\n\n2015) (stating that \u201c[i]ssues not raised in the lower court are waived and\n\ncannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d).\n\n        Nevertheless, even if Stewart had complied with the trial court\u2019s Order\n\nto file a Rule 1925(b) concise statement, we would conclude that the PCRA\n\ncourt properly held that it did not have jurisdiction over the PCRA Petition.\n\nAny PCRA petition \u201cshall be filed within one year of the date the judgment\n\nbecomes final.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9545(b)(1). A judgment of sentence becomes\n\nfinal \u201cat the conclusion of direct review, including discretionary review in the\n\nSupreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,\n\nor at the expiration of time for seeking the review.\u201d Id. \u00a7 9545(b)(3). The\n\nPCRA\u2019s timeliness requirements are jurisdictional in nature and a court may\n\nnot address the merits of the issues raised if the PCRA petition was not timely\n\nfiled. Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 994 A.2d 1091, 1093 (Pa. 2010).\n\n        Stewart\u2019s judgment of sentence became final in November 2001, when\n\nthe time to file a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme\n\nCourt expired. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. 9545(b)(3); SUP. CT. R. 13. Thus, Stewart\u2019s\n\nPetition is facially untimely.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fJ-S05035-20\n\n\n       However, Pennsylvania courts may consider an untimely petition if the\n\npetitioner can explicitly plead and prove one of three exceptions set forth at\n\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii). Any PCRA Petition invoking one of the\n\nexceptions \u201cshall be filed within one year of the date the claim could have\n\nbeen presented.\u201d Id. \u00a7 9545(b)(2).\n\n       Here, Stewart did not prove any of the three timeliness exceptions.2\n\nTherefore, we lack jurisdiction to address the merits of his claims on appeal.\n\n       Order affirmed.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D. Seletyn, Esq.\nProthonotary\n\n\n\nDate: 3/16/2020\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2 Stewart purports to invoke the \u201cnewly-discovered facts\u201d exception at 42\nPa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii). Stewart alleges that in September 2018, he\ndiscovered that the Commonwealth had \u201cestablished [b]onds\u201d on him before\nand after he was arrested, \u201cwithout [Stewart\u2019s] consent or knowledge, which\nis a fraud, by mail and/or wire.\u201d See Brief for Appellant at 15. Stewart does\nnot explain what he means by \u201cbonds,\u201d how this constitutes newly-discovered\nfacts, or how these \u201cfacts\u201d could not have been ascertained by the exercise of\ndue diligence. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii).\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fJ-S05035-20\n\n\n\n\n              -5-\n\f",
