Sweet, Judge; L.T. Case No. 562011CF002629C.\n\n   Carey Haughwout, Public Defender, and Amy Lora Rabinowitz,\nAssistant Public Defender, West Palm Beach, for appellant.\n\n   Pamela Jo Bondi, Attorney General, Tallahassee, and Richard\nValuntas, Assistant Attorney General, West Palm Beach, for appellee.\n\nSTEVENSON, J.\n\n   Gregory Angelo Ferraro (\u201cDefendant\u201d) appeals from a final judgment\nadjudicating him guilty of first degree murder with a firearm and\nattempted first degree murder with a firearm. Defendant argues the trial\ncourt erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the grounds\nthat the State presented insufficient evidence to support premeditation. A\nde novo standard of review applies when reviewing a motion for judgment\nof acquittal. Pagan v. State, 830 So. 2d 792, 803 (Fla. 2002). \u201cA motion\nfor judgment of acquittal should be granted in a circumstantial evidence\ncase if the state fails to present evidence from which the jury can exclude\nevery reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d State v. Law, 559 So. 2d\n187, 188 (Fla. 1989). Applying that heightened standard here, we find the\nState met its burden and we affirm.\n\n    On the night of the incident, Defendant and others were gathered at a\nfriend\u2019s house for a party. Towards the end of the night, Defendant started\narguing with one of the other men at the party. The fight was broken up,\nand Defendant drove away with a handful of other partygoers. Apparently\n\fstill disturbed by the incident, Defendant obtained a gun and returned to\nthe house approximately two to three hours later. Hearing someone\noutside the house, Casey Jackson and Daniel White walked out onto the\nporch. Both men leaned out from behind a wall, whereupon Daniel White\nwas shot and killed by Defendant. Defendant also shot at Casey Jackson.\nDefendant claimed that he did not see anyone but heard a gun cock, and\nhe fired his weapon only in an attempt to scare anyone outside into\nreturning inside the house so that he could run away.\n\n    Defendant argues his motion for judgment of acquittal should have\nbeen granted because there was insufficient evidence to prove\npremeditation. We disagree. The State presented sufficient evidence that\nshowed Defendant had formed the requisite premeditation, including\nevidence that he arranged to pick up some \u201cbig artillery\u201d shortly before the\nshootings and his remarks that he intended on \u201cbring[ing] . . . fire.\u201d Cf.\nKirkland v. State, 684 So. 2d 732, 735 (Fla. 1996) (holding there was not\nsufficient evidence of premeditation when, in part, the defendant did not\nmake \u201cspecial arrangements to obtain a murder weapon in advance of the\nhomicide\u201d). Additionally, despite Defendant\u2019s testimony that he heard\nsomeone walk outside the house and cock a gun, Defendant still elected\nto shoot straight and not up into the air or towards the ground. This\nevidence negates Defendant\u2019s suggestion that he intended only to scare\nthe victims. There was also some evidence that the front lawn was\nilluminated, which refuted Defendant\u2019s claim that he was unable to see\nanyone because it was dark outside. Based on these reasons, and other\nevidence presented at trial, we affirm the final judgment.\n\n   Affirmed.\n\nMAY and LEVINE, JJ., concur.\n\n                           *         *         *\n\n   Not final until disposition of timely filed motion for rehearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                     2\n\f",
