No. S-18-342.\n\n                 1. Constitutional Law: Motions to Suppress: Confessions: Miranda\n                    Rights: Appeal and Error. In reviewing a motion to suppress a state-\n                    ment based on its claimed involuntariness, including claims that law\n                    enforcement procured it by violating the safeguards established by the\n                    U.S. Supreme Court in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct.\n                    1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), an appellate court applies a two-part\n                    standard of review. Regarding historical facts, an appellate court reviews\n                    the trial court\u2019s findings for clear error. Whether those facts meet con-\n                    stitutional standards, however, is a question of law, which an appellate\n                    court reviews independently of the trial court\u2019s determination.\n                 2. Statutes: Appeal and Error. Statutory interpretation presents a ques-\n                    tion of law, which an appellate court reviews independently of the lower\n                    court\u2019s determination.\n                 3. Constitutional Law: Statutes: Judgments: Appeal and Error. The\n                    constitutionality and construction of statutes are questions of law,\n                    regarding which appellate courts are obligated to reach conclusions\n                    independent of those reached by the court below.\n                 4. Trial: Convictions: Evidence: Appeal and Error. An appellate court\n                    will sustain a conviction in a bench trial of a criminal case if the prop-\n                    erly admitted evidence, viewed and construed most favorably to the\n                    State, is sufficient to support that conviction. In making this determi-\n                    nation, an appellate court does not resolve conflicts in the evidence,\n                    pass on the credibility of witnesses, evaluate explanations, or reweigh\n                    the evidence presented, which are within a fact finder\u2019s province for\n                    disposition. Instead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the\n                    evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier\n                    of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a\n                    reasonable doubt.\n\f                                    - 97 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                     304 Nebraska R eports\n                             STATE v. MONTOYA\n                              Cite as 304 Neb. 96\n\n 5. Sentences: Appeal and Error. An appellate court will not disturb a sen-\n    tence imposed within the statutory limits absent an abuse of discretion\n    by the trial court.\n 6. Miranda Rights. The warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384\n    U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), are required only\n    when a suspect interrogated by the police is \u201cin custody.\u201d\n 7. ____. The ultimate inquiry for determining whether a person is \u201cin cus-\n    tody\u201d for purposes of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602,\n    16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), is simply whether there is a formal arrest or\n    restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a for-\n    mal arrest.\n 8. ____. The test for custody under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86\n    S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), is to be determined based on how\n    a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s situation would perceive his or her\n    circumstances. It is an objective inquiry and does not depend on the sub-\n    jective views harbored by either the interrogating officer or the person\n    being interrogated.\n 9. ____. The test for determining custody under Miranda v. Arizona, 384\n    U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), involves two discrete\n    inquiries: first, what were the circumstances surrounding the interroga-\n    tion; and second, given those circumstances, would a reasonable person\n    have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation\n    and leave.\n10. Constitutional Law: Confessions. The 5th Amendment to the U.S.\n    Constitution, along with the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment,\n    prevents the use of involuntary confessions in criminal convictions.\n11. Miranda Rights. The question of whether a custodial interrogation\n    complies with Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L.\n    Ed. 2d 694 (1966), is distinct from the question of whether statements\n    made during a custodial interrogation were sufficiently voluntary.\n12. Confessions: Proof. The State has the burden to prove that a defend\u00ad\n    ant\u2019s statement was voluntary and not coerced.\n13. Confessions. Whether a defendant\u2019s statement was voluntarily given\n    depends on the totality of the circumstances. Factors to consider include\n    the interrogator\u2019s tactics, the details of the interrogation, and any char-\n    acteristics of the accused that might cause his or her will to be eas-\n    ily overborne.\n14. Confessions: Police Officers and Sheriffs. While the confession of an\n    accused may be involuntary and inadmissible if obtained in exchange\n    for a promise of leniency, mere advice or exhortation by the police that\n    it would be better for the accused to tell the truth, when unaccompanied\n    by either a threat or promise, does not make a subsequent confession\n\f                                      - 98 -\n              Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                      304 Nebraska R eports\n                              STATE v. MONTOYA\n                               Cite as 304 Neb. 96\n\n      involuntary. In order to render a statement involuntary, any benefit\n      offered to a defendant must be definite and must overbear his or her\n      free will.\n15.   Statutes: Appeal and Error. Statutory language is to be given its plain\n      and ordinary meaning, and an appellate court will not resort to inter-\n      pretation to ascertain the meaning of statutory words which are plain,\n      direct, and unambiguous.\n16.   Criminal Law: Minors: Intent. Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-707(1)(a) through\n      (f) (Reissue 2016) defines the offense of child abuse. Then, \u00a7 28-707(3)\n      through (8) classifies the level of any such offense based on two factors:\n      the actor\u2019s state of mind when committing the offense and the degree of\n      harm to the child resulting from the offense.\n17.   Criminal Law: Minors: Intent: Proof. To convict a defendant of the\n      Class IB felony of knowing and intentional child abuse resulting in\n      death under Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-707 (Reissue 2016), the State must\n      prove the defendant knowingly and intentionally caused or permitted the\n      child to be abused in one or more of the ways defined in \u00a7 28-707(1),\n      and also must prove the offense resulted in the child\u2019s death, as required\n      by \u00a7 28-707(8). It is not necessary, however, to prove the defendant\n      intended the abuse to result in death.\n18.   Statutes. It is not within the province of the courts to read a meaning\n      into a statute that is not there or to read anything direct and plain out of\n      a statute.\n19.   Plea in Abatement: Evidence: Appeal and Error. An error in a rul-\n      ing on a plea in abatement challenging whether there was sufficient\n      evidence to bind a case over for trial is cured by a subsequent finding\n      at trial of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt which is supported by suf-\n      ficient evidence.\n20.   Criminal Law: Evidence: Appeal and Error. When a criminal defend\u00ad\n      ant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence upon which a conviction\n      is based, the relevant question for an appellate court is whether, after\n      viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any\n      rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime\n      beyond a reasonable doubt.\n21.   Constitutional Law: Statutes: Standing: Proof. Standing to challenge\n      the constitutionality of a statute under the federal or state Constitution\n      depends upon whether one is, or is about to be, adversely affected by the\n      language in question. To establish standing, the contestant must show\n      that as a consequence of the alleged unconstitutionality, the contestant\n      is, or is about to be, deprived of a protected right.\n22.   Constitutional Law: Statutes. Courts will not decide a question con-\n      cerning the constitutionality of a statute unless such question has been\n\f                                     - 99 -\n              Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                      304 Nebraska R eports\n                              STATE v. MONTOYA\n                               Cite as 304 Neb. 96\n\n      raised by a litigant whose interests are adversely affected by the ques-\n      tioned statute.\n23.   Constitutional Law: Statutes: Presumptions. Courts will presume\n      a statute to be constitutional and will resolve all reasonable doubts in\n      favor of its constitutionality.\n24.   Constitutional Law: Statutes: Proof. The burden to clearly demon-\n      strate that a statute is unconstitutional rests upon the party making the\n      claim of unconstitutionality.\n25.   Constitutional Law: Criminal Law: Statutes. A penal statute must be\n      construed so as to meet constitutional requirements if such can reason-\n      ably be done.\n26.   Equal Protection. The Equal Protection Clause does not forbid clas-\n      sifications; it simply keeps governmental decisionmakers from treating\n      differently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.\n27.   ____. When a classification created by state action does not jeopardize\n      the exercise of a fundamental right or categorize because of an inher-\n      ently suspect characteristic, the Equal Protection Clause requires only\n      that the classification rationally further a legitimate state interest.\n28.   Constitutional Law: Statutes: Legislature: Intent: Appeal and Error.\n      Under rational basis review, an appellate court will uphold a classifica-\n      tion created by the Legislature where it has a rational means of promot-\n      ing a legitimate government interest or purpose. In other words, the\n      difference in classification need only bear some relevance to the purpose\n      for which the difference is made.\n29.   Equal Protection: Proof. Under the rational basis test, whether an equal\n      protection claim challenges a statute or some other government act or\n      decision, the burden is upon the challenging party to eliminate any rea-\n      sonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for\n      the classification.\n30.   Constitutional Law: Criminal Law: Statutes. The void-for-vagueness\n      doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with\n      sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct\n      is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and dis-\n      criminatory enforcement.\n31.   Constitutional Law: Statutes: Standing. The test for standing to assert\n      a vagueness challenge is the same whether the challenge asserted is\n      facial or as applied. To assert a claim of vagueness, a defendant must\n      not have engaged in conduct which is clearly prohibited by the ques-\n      tioned statute. Furthermore, a defendant cannot maintain that the statute\n      is vague when applied to the conduct of others, because a court will not\n      examine the vagueness of the law as it might apply to the conduct of\n      persons not before the court.\n\f                                    - 100 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                     304 Nebraska R eports\n                             STATE v. MONTOYA\n                              Cite as 304 Neb. 96\n\n32. Sentences: Appeal and Error. Absent an abuse of discretion by the trial\n    court, an appellate court will not disturb a sentence imposed within the\n    statutory limits.\n33. Judgments: Words and Phrases. An abuse of discretion occurs when a\n    trial court\u2019s decision is based upon reasons that are untenable or unrea-\n    sonable or if its action is clearly against justice or conscience, reason,\n    and evidence.\n34. Sentences: Appeal and Error. Where a sentence imposed within the\n    statutory limits is alleged on appeal to be excessive, the appellate court\n    must determine whether a sentencing court abused its discretion in con-\n    sidering and applying the relevant factors as well as any applicable legal\n    principles in determining the sentence to be imposed.\n35. Sentences. In determining a sentence to be imposed, relevant factors\n    customarily considered and applied are the defendant\u2019s (1) age, (2) men-\n    tality, (3) education and experience, (4) social and cultural background,\n    (5) past criminal record or record of law-abiding conduct, and (6) moti-\n    vation for the offense, as well as (7) the nature of the offense and (8) the\n    amount of violence involved in the commission of the crime.\n36. ____. The appropriateness of a sentence is necessarily a subjective judg-\n    ment and includes the sentencing judge\u2019s observation of the defendant\u2019s\n    demeanor and attitude and all the facts and circumstances surrounding\n    the defendant\u2019s life.\n\n  Appeal from the District Court for Madison County: James\nG.

FACTS\n   At approximately 1 a.m. on March 13, 2016, Montoya\nbrought her 41\u20442-year-old daughter, C.H., to the emergency room\nat Faith Regional Health Services (Faith Regional) in Norfolk,\nNebraska. C.H. was unresponsive, tremoring, and posturing,\nand she had bruising on her body. A CT scan revealed bilat-\neral bleeding between the brain and the skull. C.H. was \u201clife-\nflighted\u201d to Children\u2019s Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, where\nshe subsequently died from her injuries. The cause of death\nwas blunt force trauma to the head.\n                     1. Police Investigation\n   Shortly after C.H. was brought to the emergency room,\nstaff there contacted police to report possible child abuse. The\npolice conducted a series of three interviews with Montoya;\ntwo of those interviews occurred the same day that C.H. was\ntaken to Faith Regional, and the third interview occurred the\nnext day.\n                      (a) First Interview\n  When police arrived at Faith Regional, an officer asked to\nspeak with Montoya in a private area. They proceeded to a\nfamily waiting room where the officer questioned Montoya\nabout how C.H. had sustained her injuries. This interview,\nwhich was recorded on the officer\u2019s body microphone, was\nsuppressed by the trial court. That suppression ruling has not\nbeen challenged on appeal.\n                      (b) Second Interview\n   Shortly after the first interview ended, the lead investigator,\nJosh Bauermeister, arrived at Faith Regional. After C.H. was\nlife-flighted to Children\u2019s Hospital in Omaha, Bauermeister\nwas introduced to Montoya and told her he wanted \u201cto find out\na little bit about what happened.\u201d He asked whether Montoya\nwould allow police to search and photograph her apartment\n\f                             - 102 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   304 Nebraska R eports\n                       STATE v. MONTOYA\n                        Cite as 304 Neb. 96\n\nand whether she would give a recorded interview at the police\nstation. Montoya agreed to both requests. Montoya\u2019s boyfriend\nthen took officers to the apartment, and Montoya\u2014who did not\nhave a car available\u2014rode with Bauermeister to the police sta-\ntion in the front seat of his unmarked patrol car.\n   The recorded interview occurred in an interview room at the\npolice station, and lasted about 1 hour. At the beginning of the\ninterview, Bauermeister told Montoya that she was not under\narrest, that she did not have to speak with him, and that she\ncould leave at any time. Bauermeister also explained how to\nleave the police station from the interview room.\n   During the interview, Montoya explained that around noon\non March 12, 2016, she became frustrated that C.H. would not\nstay in her bed and would not stop crying, so she squeezed\nC.H.\u2019s torso hard enough to leave marks and then threw C.H.\nonto her bed three times. Montoya said that C.H. struck her\nhead on the wall the third time she was thrown. After that,\nC.H. fell asleep around 1 p.m. and slept until around 4 p.m.,\nwhen she woke briefly before falling asleep again. Around 9\np.m., C.H. began to vomit. Montoya put C.H. into the bathtub\nto wash her off, but C.H. would not stand; Montoya described\nC.H.\u2019s body as \u201cJell-O.\u201d Montoya said that when she turned on\nthe cold water, C.H. became responsive and was able to answer\nquestions. Montoya asked C.H. whether her head hurt, and\nC.H. answered yes. Montoya also asked whether C.H. wanted\nice cream, and C.H. again answered yes.\n   Montoya and her boyfriend put C.H. in the car to get some\nice cream. They proceeded to drive several places with C.H.,\nincluding to Montoya\u2019s mother\u2019s house, a grocery store, a\ndiscount department store, and a fast-food restaurant. When\nthey returned home, C.H. was unresponsive. Montoya called a\nfriend who convinced her to take C.H. to the hospital.\n   At the end of the recorded interview, Bauermeister asked\nMontoya to write a statement summarizing her interview, and\nshe complied. When Montoya finished writing out her three-\npage statement, she left the police station.\n\f                                - 103 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                     304 Nebraska R eports\n                          STATE v. MONTOYA\n                           Cite as 304 Neb. 96\n\n  Bauermeister subsequently obtained an arrest warrant, and\nMontoya was arrested at Children\u2019s Hospital in Omaha on\nMarch 14, 2016. She was transported to the downtown Omaha\npolice station, where she was interviewed a third time.\n                       (c) Third Interview\n   Montoya\u2019s third interview was conducted by Bauermeister\non March 14, 2016, at 1:30 p.m. and lasted 11\u20444 hours.\nBefore questioning Montoya, Bauermeister spoke about the\nimportance of telling the truth during the interview, saying,\n\u201cWhatever you do today though, don\u2019t lie about it, because if\nyou lie about anything or fail to tell me anything, it\u2019s going to\nlook really bad for you when you go to court.\u201d Bauermeister\nalso advised Montoya of her rights under Miranda v.\nArizona1 before questioning her. Throughout the interview,\nBauermeister continued to emphasize the importance of being\ntruthful. His statements in that regard are addressed more\nfully in our analysis of Montoya\u2019s assignment of error relating\nto the third interview.\n   During the third interview, Montoya admitted she slammed\nC.H. into the wall as hard as she could and held her there.\nMontoya explained that she also pushed C.H. against the wall\nthree or four times to stop her from getting away, all while\nscreaming and yelling at her to \u201cshut up\u201d and to stop crying.\nMontoya said that C.H.\u2019s head slammed into the wall and that\nMontoya pressed C.H. so hard against the wall that she worried\nit would break her ribs. Additionally, Montoya said that when\nshe threw C.H. onto her bed, she did it forcefully and C.H. hit\nher head on the bedframe both the first and last time she was\nthrown. Montoya said she did not take C.H. to the hospital\nsooner, because she was afraid what people might think about\nthe bruises and because she was in denial about hurting C.H.\nand was hoping she might recover.\n\n1\n    Miranda v.

Her\nwritten statement tracked generally with her statements to\npolice during the interview.\n   C.H. died from her injuries on March 20, 2016, after which\nthe State charged Montoya with knowing and intentional child\nabuse resulting in death, a Class IB felony.2\n\n                    2. Pretrial Proceedings\n                    (a) Motions to Suppress\n   Montoya moved to suppress all of her oral and written\nstatements to police. She claimed she was in custody during\nall three interviews and argued her statements should be sup-\npressed, because (1) in the first and second interviews, she was\nnot advised of her Miranda rights, and (2) in the second and\nthird interviews her will was overborne by coercive interroga-\ntion tactics.\n   After a hearing, the trial court sustained in part and denied\nin part Montoya\u2019s motion to suppress. Regarding the first inter-\nview, the trial court sustained the motion to suppress, finding\nMontoya was in custody during police questioning at Faith\nRegional and should have received the Miranda advisement.\nAs stated, the State has not challenged the suppression of the\nfirst interview.\n   Regarding the second interview, the court found that under\nthe totality of the circumstances, Montoya was not in cus-\ntody and her statements were made freely and voluntarily.\nRegarding the third interview, the trial court found that the\nofficer\u2019s interrogation tactics did not amount to improper\nthreats, inducements, or lies and that Montoya\u2019s confession\nwas freely and voluntarily made. The court thus overruled\nMontoya\u2019s motion to suppress as it regarded both the second\nand third interviews.\n\n2\n    \u00a7 28-707(1) and (8).\n\f                                   - 105 -\n              Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                      304 Nebraska R eports\n                            STATE v.

In support\nof her plea in abatement, Montoya argued the State had not\noffered any evidence that she intended to kill C.H., and she\nsuggested that a finding of guilt under \u00a7 28-707 requires the\nState to prove the defendant had specific intent to cause the\nresulting harm. The trial court rejected Montoya\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of \u00a7 28-707, reasoning it was inconsistent with the plain\nlanguage of the statute and with settled precedent from both\nthis court3 and the Nebraska Court of Appeals.4 The trial court\nfound the evidence offered at the preliminary hearing was suf-\nficient to establish probable cause that Montoya committed\nthe crime of intentional child abuse resulting in death under\n\u00a7 28-707, and it overruled the plea in abatement.\n                      (c) Motion to Quash\n   Once the plea in abatement was overruled, Montoya filed\na motion to quash the information. In support of the motion,\nMontoya argued that unless \u00a7 28-707 was construed to require\nproof that she intended to cause the resulting harm to the\nchild, the statute would be unconstitutional, both facially and\nas applied. The trial court overruled the motion to quash,\nrejecting all of Montoya\u2019s facial constitutional challenges and\nreserving ruling on the as-applied challenges.\n                3. Bench Trial and Sentencing\n   After Montoya reentered a plea of not guilty, she waived her\nright to a jury and a bench trial was held. Montoya renewed\nher motion to suppress and her constitutional challenges to\n\u00a7 28-707, and the court overruled them. In an order entered\n\n3\n    See State v.

Her actions directed against the child . . .\n     were intentional.\nMontoya was found guilty of intentional child abuse resulting\nin death, a Class IB felony. She was sentenced to an indeter-\nminate prison term of 55 to 75 years. Montoya filed this timely\nappeal, which we moved to our docket.\n                II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Montoya assigns, consolidated and restated, that the trial\ncourt erred in (1) overruling her motion to suppress, (2) over-\nruling her plea in abatement, (3) overruling her motion to\nquash and rejecting her constitutional challenges, (4) finding\nher guilty of intentional child abuse resulting in death, and (5)\nimposing an excessive sentence.\n                 III.

Regarding the second interview, Montoya\nclaims her statements should have been suppressed because\npolice questioned her without first giving her the Miranda\nadvisement. Regarding both the second and third interviews,\nMontoya claims her will was overborne by coercive police\ntactics and argues her statements should have been suppressed\nas involuntary. We address each argument in turn.\n\n                    (a) Miranda Advisement\n   [6] In Miranda, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that\n\u201cwithout proper safeguards the process of in-custody inter-\nrogation of persons suspected or accused of crime contains\ninherently compelling pressures which work to undermine\nthe individual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak\nwhere he would not otherwise do so freely.\u201d15 To com-\nbat against these pressures and protect the privilege against\nself-incrimination, Miranda announced a set of prophylactic\nwarnings that law enforcement officers must give before\ninterrogating someone who is in custody. \u201cPrior to any ques-\ntioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to\nremain silent, that any statement he does make may be\nused as evidence against him, and that he has a right to\nthe presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\u201d16\nThese warnings are considered \u201cprerequisites to the admis-\nsibility of any statement made by a defendant\u201d during custo-\ndial interrogation.17 But Miranda warnings are required only\nwhen a suspect interrogated by the police is \u201cin custody.\u201d18\nAnd the fact that a suspect is questioned by police at\n\n15\n     Miranda, supra note 1, 384 U.S. at 467.\n16\n     Id., 384 U.S. at 444.

Rogers,24 we observed that a \u201clarge body of\ncase law\u201d had developed to assist courts in identifying which\ncircumstances may be most relevant to the Miranda custody\ninquiry. Rogers mentioned eight such circumstances, includ-\ning: (1) the location of the interrogation and whether it was a\nplace where the defendant would normally feel free to leave;\n\n19\n     See, e.g., California v.

In analyzing\nwhether Montoya was in custody during that interrogation, the\ndistrict court recited the governing principles outlined above,\nand it expressly analyzed each of the six Axsom indicia before\nconcluding, based on a review of all the circumstances sur-\nrounding the interrogation, that Montoya was not in custody.\nOn appeal, Montoya argues the district court erred when it ana-\nlyzed custody using the Axsom indicia without also expressly\naddressing the eight circumstances we identified in Rogers.\nShe contends this is grounds for reversal. She is incorrect.\n   Both Rogers and Axsom offer guidance to courts when\nanalyzing the circumstances surrounding an interrogation to\ndetermine whether a reasonable person in those circumstances\nwould have believed they were in custody, and both cases\nwere decided at a time when the U.S. Supreme Court had not\nexpressly identified relevant factors to consider in making the\nMiranda custody determination. But neither Rogers nor Axsom\npurported to develop an exclusive test which must be applied\nin every case, and we expressly reject Montoya\u2019s suggestion to\nthe contrary.\n   For the sake of completeness, we note that in 2012, the U.S.\nSupreme Court, in Howes v.

These factors include the location\nof the questioning, its duration, statements made during the\ninterview, the presence or absence of physical restraints during\nthe questioning, and the release of the interviewee at the end\nof the questioning.32\n   While many appellate courts have developed factors to help\nguide the Miranda custody determination,33 neither the U.S.\nSupreme Court nor this court has developed a single set of fac-\ntors that courts are required to apply in every case. So while\nthe factors identified in Howes, the circumstances summarized\nin Rogers, and the indicia outlined in Axsom all provide guid-\nance, none are meant to be applied mechanically or exclusively\nto determine whether a suspect is in custody for purposes of\nMiranda. We reject Montoya\u2019s argument that the district court\nerred in not expressly considering each circumstance refer-\nenced in Rogers.\n   Here, the district court properly considered the relevant\ncircumstances surrounding Montoya\u2019s interrogation and made\nspecific factual findings which we review for clear error.34\nAmong others, the court found that Montoya voluntarily agreed\nto ride with police to the station because she did not have a\ncar available. Once Montoya was in the interview room, she\nwas expressly told that she was not in custody, that she was\nfree to leave at any time, that she was not under arrest, and\nthat she would be walking out of the police station after the\ninterview. Nothing about the officer\u2019s subsequent questioning\nor conduct nullified these statements. In addition, Montoya\nwas instructed by police how to leave the police station from\nthe interview room, and during questioning, police did not\n\n32\n     Id.\n33\n     See, e.g., U.S. v.

All of these findings\npertain to the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, and\nall are supported by the record.\n   Based on these findings, the district court concluded that\nMontoya voluntarily agreed to an interview at the police sta-\ntion and that a reasonable person in her position would \u201cnot\nhave necessarily felt compelled to do so.\u201d This is a conclu-\nsion of law which an appellate court reviews independently.35\nHaving done so, we conclude that a reasonable person in\nMontoya\u2019s position would not have felt he or she was not\nat liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.36 Because\nMontoya was not \u201cin custody\u201d during the second interview,\nno Miranda advisement was required prior to questioning.\nThe district court properly denied her motion to suppress\nto the extent it was based on the absence of a Miranda\nadvisement.\n\n           (b) Voluntariness of Montoya\u2019s Statements\n   With respect to both the second and third interviews,\nMontoya argues that her statements should have been sup-\npressed, because they were not voluntarily made and her will\nwas overborne by coercive police tactics.\n   [10,11] The 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, appli-\ncable to state governments by incorporation through the 14th\nAmendment, protects against compelled self-incrimination by\nproviding that \u201c[n]o person shall be . . . compelled in any\ncriminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\u201d37 This\namendment, along with the Due Process Clause of the 14th\nAmendment, prevents the use of involuntary confessions in\n\n35\n     Id.\n36\n     Accord, Beheler, supra note 19; Mathiason, supra note 19.\n37\n     U.S. Const. amend.

These findings are supported by the record and are not\nclearly erroneous.\n   Based on these factual findings and our de novo review of\nthe record, including the video recording of the second inter-\nview, we conclude the statements Montoya made during the\nsecond interview were voluntary and were not the result of\npolice coercion. There was no error in overruling the motion to\nsuppress as to the second interview.\n                        (ii) Third Interview\n    Montoya argues her statements in the third interview were\nnot voluntary, because improper inducements were made to\nher by police in the form of either promises of leniency or\nthreats of harsher punishment. Some additional factual back-\nground is necessary to understand her arguments.\n    Before questioning Montoya, Bauermeister spoke at length\nabout the importance of telling the truth during the interview,\nsaying, \u201cWhatever you do today though, don\u2019t lie about it,\nbecause if you lie about anything or fail to tell me anything,\nit\u2019s going to look really bad for you when you go to court.\u201d\nBauermeister went on to say:\n      You can choose not to talk to me and that\u2019s fine, but the\n      story I got, and the injuries [C.H.] has, I can prove that\n      you had something to do with this. I can prove you are\n      responsible for this at this point. Now, if you go into\n      court, and you will go to court for this at some point . .\n      . . If you go into court, if you stand up there on the stand\n      and you say anything that is a lie and I get up there on\n      the stand and say that this is what she told me and this\n      is a lie and I can prove it because of this, this, and this,\n      that\u2019s going to make you look very bad to a judge or a\n      jury.

I don\u2019t want to say more harshly, but who would you\n      want to work with?\nBauermeister then advised Montoya of her Miranda rights and\nbegan questioning her. Throughout the interview, Bauermeister\ncontinued to emphasize the importance of being truthful. He\ntold Montoya he did not think she was being completely hon-\nest, and he commented that judges and juries do not like liars,\nthat it would be better for Montoya to tell the truth, and that\nprosecutors and police would be more likely to \u201cwork\u201d with\nsomeone who was truthful.\n   [14] While the confession of an accused may be involuntary\nand inadmissible if obtained in exchange for a promise of leni-\nency, mere advice or exhortation by the police that it would be\nbetter for the accused to tell the truth, when unaccompanied by\neither a threat or promise, does not make a subsequent confes-\nsion involuntary.44 In order to render a statement involuntary,\nany benefit offered to a defendant must be definite and must\noverbear his or her free will.45\n   The district court found that Bauermeister\u2019s statements dur-\ning the third interview did not rise to the level of promises\n\n44\n     See id.\n45\n     Id.\n\f                                    - 117 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       304 Nebraska R eports\n                             STATE v.

After reviewing\nthe video recording and considering the totality of the circum-\nstances, we agree. Bauermeister used standard interrogation\ntechniques, and nothing about the circumstances of the inter-\nrogation or the characteristics and reaction of Montoya suggest\nher will was overborne. On this record, we agree with the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s conclusion that Montoya\u2019s statements in the third\ninterview, both oral and written, were voluntarily made. The\ntrial court did not err in overruling Montoya\u2019s motion to sup-\npress, and her first assignment of error is without merit.\n\n                     2. Interpreting \u00a7 28-707\n   Several of Montoya\u2019s remaining assignments of error rise\nand fall on the merits of her statutory interpretation argu-\nment, so we consider that argument as a threshold matter.\nSummarized, Montoya argues that to be found guilty of the\nClass IB felony of intentional child abuse resulting in death\nunder \u00a7 28-707(1) and (8), the State was required to prove not\nonly that she knowingly and intentionally committed the crime\nof child abuse, but also that she intended that abuse to result in\nthe child\u2019s death. The trial court rejected Montoya\u2019s proposed\ninterpretation of \u00a7 28-707, and so do we.\n   [15] Our analysis begins with the plain language of the\nstatute. Statutory language is to be given its plain and ordinary\nmeaning, and an appellate court will not resort to interpretation\nto ascertain the meaning of statutory words which are plain,\ndirect, and unambiguous.46 Section \u00a7 28-707 provides in rel-\nevant part:\n         (1) A person commits child abuse if he or she know-\n      ingly, intentionally, or negligently causes or permits a\n      minor child to be:\n         (a) Placed in a situation that endangers his or her life or\n      physical or mental health;\n         (b) Cruelly confined or cruelly punished;\n\n46\n     State v.

MONTOYA\n                              Cite as 304 Neb. 96\n\n   Montoya does not take issue with the trial court\u2019s con-\nclusion that she knowingly and intentionally committed the\noffense of child abuse as defined in \u00a7 28-707(1)(a) and (b).\nInstead, she contends that in order to find her guilty of inten-\ntional child abuse resulting in death under \u00a7 28-707(1) and\n(8), the trial court also had to find that she had the \u201cintent\nto commit the harm\u201d48 or the \u201cintent to commit the result\u201d49\nof the child abuse. In other words, Montoya contends that\nto be found guilty of knowing and intentional child abuse\nresulting in death, the State was required to prove not only\nthat she intentionally committed the offense of child abuse,\nbut also that she intended the abuse to result in death. As we\nexplain below, Montoya\u2019s construction is inconsistent with\nthe plain language of the statute and is contrary to this court\u2019s\ncase law.\n   [16] Section 28-707(1) defines the offense of child abuse\nand states that one commits child abuse \u201cif he or she know-\ningly, intentionally, or negligently causes or permits a minor\nchild to be\u201d abused in any of the six ways identified in sub-\nsections (a) through (f). Then, \u00a7 28-707(3) through (8) clas-\nsify the level of any such offense based on two factors: the\nactor\u2019s state of mind when committing the offense and the\ndegree of harm to the child resulting from the offense.50 But\nneither the plain language of \u00a7 28-707 nor our cases interpret-\ning it require the State to prove the defendant intended the\nresulting harm to the child. We said so expressly in State v.\nMolina 51 when we observed that \u201c[c]hild abuse resulting in\ndeath requires proof of the defendant\u2019s intent to commit child\nabuse, as defined in the subsections of \u00a7 28-707(1), but it\ndoes not require proof that the defendant intended to kill the\nminor child.\u201d\n\n48\n     Brief for appellant at 29.\n49\n     Id. at 23.\n50\n     See State v.

First, we\nobserved that intentional child abuse resulting in death requires\nproof that the death was that of a minor child, which is not\nrequired to prove second degree murder. We then stated:\n      [S]econd degree murder also requires proof of an element\n      that child abuse resulting in death does not: an intent to\n      kill. . . . Child abuse resulting in death requires proof of\n      the defendant\u2019s intent to commit child abuse, as defined\n      in the subsections of \u00a7 28-707(1), but it does not require\n      proof that the defendant intended to kill the minor child.\n      Second degree murder, on the other hand, requires proof\n      of an intent to kill.53\nMolina therefore held that second degree murder was not a\nlesser-included offense of intentional child abuse resulting\nin death.\n   Our opinion in State v. Muro54 is also instructive. In that\ncase, we explained that under the statutory framework of\n\u00a7 28-707, the proscribed conduct is \u201cexactly the same\u201d whether\nthe offense is classified as a felony or a misdemeanor,55 but\nthat the classification of the offense will vary depending on\ntwo factors: the defendant\u2019s state of mind in committing the\noffense and the degree of harm caused by the offense.

By the time the child arrived at a hospital, she was not\nbreathing, her pupils were fixed and dilated, and she was limp\nand cold. Tests eventually concluded brain death had occurred,\nand the decision was made to discontinue life support. An\nautopsy showed the cause of death was a skull fracture that\nresulted in cerebral edema and ultimately brain death. The\ndefendant was convicted of intentional child abuse result-\ning in death, a Class IB felony, and sentenced to 20 years\u2019\nimprisonment.\n   We confirmed the conviction for child abuse, reasoning the\nevidence supported a finding that the defendant knowingly\nand intentionally caused or permitted her child to be deprived\nof necessary medical care, in violation of \u00a7 28-707(1)(c). But\nfor purposes of classifying the crime, we found the medi-\ncal evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the child\u2019s death was proxi-\nmately caused by the delay in seeking medical care. Notably,\nwe explained that the State\u2019s failure to prove that the child\u2019s\ndeath resulted from the abuse \u201cd[id] not relieve [the defendant]\nof criminal responsibility\u201d57 for the offense of child abuse, but\naffected only the level of the offense under \u00a7 28-707. We thus\nconcluded the evidence was \u201csufficient to sustain a conviction\nfor Class IIIA felony child abuse under \u00a7 28-707(4) without\nany proof of resulting harm to the child.\u201d58 So, we reclassi-\nfied the offense from a Class IB felony to a Class IIIA felony\nand remanded the matter for resentencing. Muro illustrates\nthat proof of the resulting harm is pertinent to classifying the\noffense of child abuse, but it does not impact criminal respon-\nsibility for the offense.\n\n56\n     Id. at 705, 695 N.W.2d at 427.\n57\n     Id. at 713, 695 N.W.2d at 432.\n58\n     Id. at 713-14, 695 N.W.2d at 432.\n\f                                    - 122 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       304 Nebraska R eports\n                             STATE v.

We hold that to convict a\ndefendant of the Class IB felony of knowing and intentional\nchild abuse resulting in death under \u00a7 28-707, the State must\nprove the defendant knowingly and intentionally caused or\npermitted the child to be abused in one or more of the ways\ndefined in \u00a7 28-707(1), and also must prove the offense\nresulted in the child\u2019s death, as required by \u00a7 28-707(8). It is\nnot necessary, however, to prove the defendant intended the\nabuse to result in the child\u2019s death.59\n   [18] In arguing for a contrary interpretation, Montoya\npresents a number of different arguments which invite this\ncourt to ignore the statutory requirements established by the\nLegislature, to conflate the statutory provisions defining the\noffense of child abuse60 with the statutory provisions classify-\ning the level of offense for purposes of punishment,61 and to\nread provisions into the statutory language which are not there.\nBut it is not within the province of the courts to read a mean-\ning into a statute that is not there or to read anything direct and\nplain out of a statute.62 It would add nothing to our jurispru-\ndence to address all of Montoya\u2019s arguments individually.

Plea in A batement and\n                     Sufficiency of Evidence\n   [19] Montoya\u2019s second assignment of error challenges the\ndenial of her plea in abatement and argues the evidence offered\nat her preliminary hearing was insufficient to bind the case\nover. Her fourth assignment of error argues that the State\u2019s\nevidence at trial was insufficient to convict her of intentional\nchild abuse resulting in death. We address these assignments\ntogether, because we have held that \u201can error in a ruling on\na plea in abatement challenging whether there was sufficient\nevidence to bind a case over for trial is cured by a subsequent\nfinding at trial of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt which is\nsupported by sufficient evidence.\u201d63 Consequently, Montoya\u2019s\nsecond and fourth assignments both turn on whether the evi-\ndence at trial was sufficient to convict her of intentional child\nabuse resulting in death.\n   [20] When a criminal defendant challenges the sufficiency\nof the evidence upon which a conviction is based, the relevant\nquestion for an appellate court is whether, after viewing the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements\nof the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.64 The evidence that\nMontoya knowingly and intentionally committed child abuse\nwas overwhelming.\n   Montoya admitted that on March 12, 2016, she threw\nC.H. against the bed multiple times causing her to hit her\nhead on the wall and the bedframe. She admitted slamming\nC.H.\u2019s head into the wall and pressing C.H. against the wall\nso hard she thought the child\u2019s ribs would break. By the time\nMontoya took C.H. to the hospital some 13 hours later, C.H.\nwas unresponsive, tremoring, and posturing and had bruis-\ning all over her body. Imaging revealed a skull fracture and\nbleeding in the brain, and medical evidence showed the cause\n\n63\n     State v. Chauncey, 295 Neb. 453, 464, 890 N.W.2d 453, 462 (2017).\n64\n     State v.

This\nevidence was sufficient to prove that Montoya knowingly\nand intentionally caused C.H. to be placed in a situation that\nendangered her life or physical or mental health, in violation\nof \u00a7 28-707(1)(a), and knowingly and intentionally caused\nC.H. to be cruelly punished, in violation of \u00a7 28-707(1)(b).\nThe evidence was also sufficient to prove that Montoya\u2019s\noffense resulted in C.H.\u2019s death, making it a Class IB felony\nunder \u00a7 28-707(8).\n   Montoya does not challenge any of this evidence, but instead\nargues the State offered no evidence that she intended to kill\nC.H. She points specifically to her own statement that she\nnever intended to kill C.H. and to the investigating officer\u2019s\ntestimony that he \u201cuncovered no evidence suggesting that\n. . . Montoya intended to cause the death of [C.H.].\u201d But\nsince intent to cause death is neither an element of the offense\nof child abuse nor a factor in determining the level of such\noffense, Montoya\u2019s argument in that regard is simply immate-\nrial. The evidence at trial was sufficient to support Montoya\u2019s\nconviction for intentional child abuse resulting in death, and\nher arguments to the contrary are meritless.\n                4. Constitutionality of \u00a7 28-707\n   In her third assignment of error, Montoya argues the district\ncourt erred in overruling her motion to quash the informa-\ntion and rejecting her constitutional challenges to \u00a7 28-707.\nMontoya\u2019s motion to quash alleged that \u00a7 28-707(1), (3),\n(6), and (8) violate equal protection, violate due process, and\nare unconstitutionally vague and overbroad both facially and\nas applied.\n   [21,22] As a preliminary matter, we point out that Montoya\nwas convicted of child abuse under \u00a7 28-707(1)(a) and (b) and\n(8), but her constitutional challenge purports to extend to other\nportions of the statute as well. Standing to challenge the con-\nstitutionality of a statute under the federal or state Constitution\ndepends upon whether one is, or is about to be, adversely\n\f                                      - 125 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        304 Nebraska R eports\n                               STATE v.

Furthermore, we limit our analysis to only those\nconstitutional arguments specifically discussed in Montoya\u2019s\nappellate briefing.68\n   Montoya\u2019s appellate briefing focuses on just two of the con-\nstitutional claims alleged in her motion to quash. Her primary\nargument is that \u00a7 28-707 violates equal protection principles,\nbecause it \u201ccriminalizes the same conduct [but] imposes sub-\nstantially different penalties for that conduct\u201d69 depending on\nhow the crime is classified. She also argues that \u00a7 28-707 is\nunconstitutionally vague.\n   [23-25] In considering these two constitutional challenges,\nwe presume \u00a7 28-707 to be constitutional and resolve all rea-\nsonable doubts in favor of its constitutionality.70 The burden\nto clearly demonstrate that a statute is unconstitutional rests\nupon the party making the claim of unconstitutionality.71 A\n\n65\n     State v.

She generally argues, through a series\nof hypotheticals, that her criminal conduct was charged as a\nClass IB felony, yet someone else committing the same acts\nof abuse might be charged with and convicted of a lower level\nfelony, or even a misdemeanor. She contends this shows a vio-\nlation of equal protection. We disagree.\n   As explained earlier, \u00a7 28-707 differentiates between levels\nof offense based on two factors: the actor\u2019s state of mind in\ncommitting the proscribed conduct and the degree of harm\nresulting to the child. Generally speaking, those who commit\nchild abuse knowingly and intentionally are subject to a higher\npenalty range than those who commit the crime negligently;\nand, as the degree of harm caused to the child increases, so\ndoes the penalty range. As a result, depending on the actor\u2019s\nstate of mind in committing the offense and the harm caused to\nthe child, the same criminal conduct can be classified as either\n\n72\n     Id.\n73\n     Brief for appellant at 27.\n74\n     Hibler, supra note 65.\n\f                                    - 127 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       304 Nebraska R eports\n                             STATE v.

She suggests the only way to classify\nher offense as a Class IB felony without offending equal\nprotection is to read into the statute an \u201cintent to kill\u201d require-\nment. There are two problems with her argument: We have\nalready rejected her statutory interpretation as unsound, and\nshe has not presented any argument showing how the classifi-\ncation of crimes under \u00a7 28-707 violates the Equal Protection\nClause.\n   [26,27] The Equal Protection Clause does not forbid clas-\nsifications; it simply keeps governmental decisionmakers from\ntreating differently persons who are in all relevant respects\nalike.80 When a classification created by state action does\nnot jeopardize the exercise of a fundamental right or catego-\nrize because of an inherently suspect characteristic, the Equal\nProtection Clause requires only that the classification rationally\nfurther a legitimate state interest.81 Montoya does not claim\nthat the classification of her crime as a Class IB felony turns on\na suspect characterization or affects a fundamental right, and\nwe have been clear that child abuse is not a constitutionally\nprotected activity.82 Accordingly, Montoya\u2019s equal protection\nclaim is subject to rational basis review.\n   [28,29] Under rational basis review, we will uphold a clas-\nsification created by the Legislature where it has a rational\n\n75\n     \u00a7 28-707(3).\n76\n     \u00a7 28-707(4) and (5).\n77\n     \u00a7 28-707(6).\n78\n     \u00a7 28-707(7).\n79\n     \u00a7 28-707(8).\n80\n     Hibler, supra note 65.\n81\n     Id.\n82\n     State v.

She does not\nmention or discuss the rational basis test or attempt to apply\nany other level of constitutional scrutiny to the classification\nshe challenges. She does not argue, or even imply, that clas-\nsifying the crime of child abuse as a Class IB felony when it\nis committed intentionally rather than negligently, and when\nit results in the death of the child, somehow fails to rationally\nfurther a legitimate state interest.\n    In short, Montoya has failed to present any viable equal\nprotection argument related to the classification of her crime\nunder \u00a7 28-707(8). The district court did not err in rejecting\nher equal protection claim.\n                      (b) Void for Vagueness\n   Montoya\u2019s motion to quash alleged that \u00a7 28-707 was both\n\u201coverbroad and vague\u201d and thus facially invalid. But on appeal,\nshe argues only that the statute should be found \u201cfacially uncon-\nstitutional as violative of the void-for-vagueness doctrine,\u201d86 so\nwe confine our analysis accordingly.\n\n83\n     Rung, supra note 70.\n84\n     Id.\n85\n     Id.

Instead, she focuses on the\ndifferent criminal classifications of the crime under \u00a7 28-707\nand argues the classifications are potentially vague as applied\nto the conduct of others:\n      Is the situation where a child dies in an accident where\n      the defendant was speeding a Class IB, a Class IIA, or a\n\n87\n     Scott, supra note 10; Rung, supra note 70.\n88\n     Id.\n89\n     Id.\n90\n     Id.\n91\n     See id.\n92\n     See, State v.

Is a case where very\n      young children are left at home and a fire ensues a Class\n      IIA Felony or a Class I misdemeanor? The examples\n      are endless.93\n   We conclude that Montoya lacks standing to assert a claim\nthat \u00a7 28-707 is void for vagueness, because she was engag-\ning in conduct that is clearly proscribed by \u00a7 28-707(1)(a) and\n(b) when she abused C.H. Furthermore, she lacks standing to\nassert a claim of vagueness on behalf of others. Montoya\u2019s\nthird assignment of error has no merit.\n\n                     5. Excessive Sentence\n   [32,33] In her final assignment of error, Montoya challenges\nher sentence as excessive. She was convicted of a Class IB\nfelony, which is punishable by a minimum of 20 years\u2019 impris-\nonment and a maximum of life imprisonment.94 Montoya was\nsentenced to a term of 55 to 75 years in prison. Absent an\nabuse of discretion by the trial court, an appellate court will\nnot disturb a sentence imposed within the statutory limits.95\nAn abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court\u2019s decision\nis based upon reasons that are untenable or unreasonable or\nif its action is clearly against justice or conscience, reason,\nand evidence.96\n   [34-36] Where, as here, a sentence imposed within the statu-\ntory limits is alleged on appeal to be excessive, the appellate\ncourt must determine whether a sentencing court abused its\ndiscretion in considering and applying the relevant factors\nas well as any applicable legal principles in determining the\n\n93\n     Reply brief for appellant at 7-8.\n94\n     Neb.

Montoya nevertheless presents two arguments in support\nof her claim that the sentencing court abused its discretion.\n   First, she argues that during sentencing, the trial court\nimproperly considered the State\u2019s suggestion that a delay in\nproviding medical treatment to C.H. was a factor weighing\nin favor of a harsher sentence. Montoya contends this was\nimproper because there was no evidence that if she had sought\ntreatment more promptly, C.H.\u2019s injuries would have been\nreduced. But when imposing sentence, the trial judge expressly\ntold Montoya: \u201cI\u2019m not sentencing you because of the delay.\nCould [earlier treatment] have helped? Nobody will ever know.\nThe doctors evidently don\u2019t seem to think so.\u201d The record\non appeal affirmatively refutes Montoya\u2019s contention that the\ntrial court improperly considered the delay in treatment when\nimposing sentence.\n   Next, Montoya argues the sentence imposed was exces-\nsive when compared to sentences imposed in other cases\nwhich defense counsel brought to the trial court\u2019s attention\nduring sentencing. Montoya suggests this was an abuse of\n\n97\n     State v.

I\u2019m also aware of a lot of other cases that you\n      did not speak of that I researched and looked into and\n      that were sentenced significantly greater than what you\n      indicated.\n         . . . The law is different in some instances.
