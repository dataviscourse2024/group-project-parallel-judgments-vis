This insurance-coverage dispute\n\narises from an auction at which a motor vehicle being displayed\n\nfor bidding suddenly accelerated into a group of attendees, killing\n\nfive   and   injuring   many   others.      Motorists    Commercial   Mutual\n\nInsurance Company (\"Motorists\"), which insured the dealership that\n\nowned the vehicle, brought this action seeking a declaration that\n\nits policies do not cover the auctioneer or its employee who was\n\nbehind the wheel of the vehicle when it struck the victims.\n\nDefendants in this action include those who claim an interest in\n\nMotorists'     coverage:   the   victims,     the   auctioneer,   and   its\n\nemployee.      Both sides moved for summary judgment, which the\n\ndistrict court granted in favor of Motorists.           Motorists Com. Mut.\n\nIns. Co. v. Hartwell, 549 F. Supp. 3d 220, 231 (D. Mass. 2021).\n\nAfter a fresh look at defendants' arguments spanning several\n\npolicies and provisions, we agree with the district court that\n\nMotorists' policies do not cover this accident.              Our reasoning\n\nfollows.\n\n                                    I.\n\n                                    A.\n\n             We draw the following facts primarily from the parties'\n\nstatements of material facts, the responses to each, and the\n\nMotorists policies at issue.\n\n             Nashua Automotive, LLC is a New Hampshire car dealership\n\nthat sells new and used cars.       It is owned by a dealership group\n\n\n                                   - 3 -\n\fcalled   AutoFair,   Inc.    and   operates   under   the   name   \"AutoFair\n\nVolkswagen of Nashua.\"      We will refer to Nashua Automotive, LLC as\n\n\"Nashua.\"\n\n            While AutoFair dealerships, like Nashua, sell most of\n\ntheir vehicles \"retail\" (to the public), about 8% or 9% of their\n\nrevenues come from vehicles sold \"wholesale\" (online or at an\n\nauction).      For its vehicles sold wholesale, Nashua primarily\n\nengages with a company called Lynnway Auto Auction, Inc., which\n\noperates an auction facility in Billerica, Massachusetts.            Neither\n\nAutoFair nor Nashua owns Lynnway, and Lynnway does not own Nashua\n\nor AutoFair.\n\n            In April 2017, Nashua received a 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee\n\nas a trade-in for a new vehicle it sold.              Nashua arranged for\n\nLynnway to auction the Jeep.        On May 3, 2017, while that Jeep was\n\nbeing put up for auction inside Lynnway's Billerica facility, it\n\naccelerated into a crowd, causing multiple serious injuries and\n\nfive deaths.    At the time of the accident, Lynnway employee Roger\n\nHartwell was seated in the driver's seat of the Jeep, though he\n\nclaims that the vehicle accelerated uncontrollably despite his\n\nefforts to stop it.         Hartwell was subject to a long series of\n\nsuspensions of his driver's license, although the parties dispute\n\nwhether Hartwell's license was suspended at the time of the\n\naccident.\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 4 -\n\f            In due course, the victims and their estates filed a\n\nseries of lawsuits in Massachusetts state court, alleging several\n\ntheories    of   liability    against   Lynnway,   Hartwell,   Nashua   and\n\nAutoFair, as well as other related individuals and entities.\n\n                                     B.\n\n            Of the various insurance companies whose policies may be\n\nimplicated by those underlying claims, this case concerns only\n\none: Motorists Commercial Mutual Insurance Company.              Motorists\n\nprovided a liability policy (the \"Primary Policy\") that covered\n\nAutoFair, Nashua, and other AutoFair-affiliated dealerships as\n\nnamed insureds, but did not name Lynnway or Hartwell among the\n\ninsureds.        Motorists   also   provided   a   so-called   \"Commercial\n\nUmbrella\"    policy    (the    \"Umbrella    Policy\"),    which   provided\n\nsupplemental insurance above the Primary Policy's limits to many\n\nof the same named insureds, including Nashua and AutoFair.\n\n            The Primary Policy includes a \"Garage Coverage Form\"\n\nthat provides that Motorists \"will pay all sums an 'insured'\n\nlegally must pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property\n\ndamage' to which this insurance applies, caused by an 'accident'\n\nand resulting from 'garage operations' involving the ownership,\n\nmaintenance or use of covered 'autos.'\"        This form was modified by\n\na New Hampshire Changes in Policy endorsement (the \"New Hampshire\n\nEndorsement\").      We train our attention on two provisions giving\n\nrise to the parties' dispute. First, the New Hampshire Endorsement\n\n\n                                    - 5 -\n\fchanged the definition of \"Who Is An Insured\" such that it includes\n\n\"[a]nyone else while using with your permission a covered 'auto'\n\nyou own . . . except . . . [s]omeone using a covered 'auto' while\n\nhe or she is working in a business of selling, servicing or\n\nrepairing 'autos' unless that business is yours.\"       Following the\n\nparties' lead, we refer to this provision as the \"auto business\n\nexclusion.\"1   Second, the New Hampshire Endorsement added an\n\nexclusion that provides that the insurance does not apply to \"[a]ny\n\n'insured' for 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' arising out of\n\nthe operation of any vehicle by that 'insured' and while that\n\n'insured's' driver's license is under suspension or revocation.\"\n\nWe call this the \"suspended license exclusion.\"\n\n          The Umbrella Policy, in turn, provides further coverage\n\nfor bodily injuries, but contains an \"Automobile Liability --\n\nFollowing Form\" endorsement, which provides:\n\n          Except as coverage is available to you in the\n          underlying policies as set forth in the\n          Schedule of Underlying Insurance, this policy\n          does not apply to the ownership, maintenance,\n          operation, [or] use . . . of any automobile\n          while away from premises owned by, rented to,\n          or controlled by you.2\n\n\n     1  Though styled as such by the parties and other courts, the\nauto business exclusion appears in the policy here not as an\nexclusion but as part of the definition of who is an insured. We\nadopt the parties' use of the \"exclusion\" phrasing only for ease\nof discussion.\n     2  The Primary Policy is included in         the    Schedule   of\nUnderlying Insurance for the Umbrella Policy.\n\n\n                              - 6 -\n\f      Finally, as relevant here, the Umbrella Policy also defines\n\n\"who is an insured\" for that policy, which specifically excludes\n\n\"[a]ny person employed by or engaged in the duties of an auto sales\n\nagency . . . that you do not operate.\"\n\n                                     C.\n\n            Motorists initiated this federal action in the District\n\nof Massachusetts on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, seeking\n\na declaratory judgment that its policies do not provide coverage\n\nfor   the   victims'    claims    against      Lynnway   and   its   employee.\n\nDefendants include Lynnway and Hartwell (the \"Lynnway defendants\")\n\nand the accident victims who brought the state-court suits (the\n\n\"victim defendants\").      All defendants moved for summary judgment\n\nbelow, prompting a cross-motion from Motorists.            Motorists pointed\n\nto both the auto business exclusion and the suspended license\n\nexclusion   described    above,    each   of    which    Motorists   contended\n\nforeclosed coverage under the Primary Policy.            It also argued that\n\nits Umbrella Policy's Following Form Endorsement provides auto\n\ncoverage that is no broader than that provided for in the Primary\n\nPolicy.\n\n            The district court agreed with Motorists on all three\n\nscores, granting summary judgment in its favor.            Motorists, 549 F.\n\nSupp. 3d at 229\u201331.         Defendants took timely appeals that we\n\nconsolidated for briefing and argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 7 -\n\f                                II.\n\n            We review de novo the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment.    AJC Int'l, Inc. v. Triple-S Propiedad, 790 F.3d 1, 3\n\n(1st Cir. 2015).    A district court awards summary judgment when\n\n\"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant\n\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\nFor a factual dispute to be \"genuine,\" there must be \"sufficient\n\nevidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a\n\nverdict for that party.\"     Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477\n\nU.S. 242, 249 (1986).      \"[O]n an appeal from cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment, the standard does not change; we view each motion\n\nseparately and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the\n\nrespective non-moving party.\"   Pac. Indem. Co. v. Deming, 828 F.3d\n\n19, 23 (1st Cir. 2016) (quoting Roman Cath. Bishop of Springfield\n\nv. City of Springfield, 724 F.3d 78, 89 (1st Cir. 2013)).\n\n            The parties agree that New Hampshire substantive law\n\ngoverns the insurance contracts because the policies were issued\n\nto New Hampshire insureds.   We therefore look to that state's law\n\nfor the insurance-law principles that will guide our review.    See\n\nMerch. Ins. Co. of N.H. v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 143 F.3d 5, 8\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (forgoing independent choice-of-law analysis where\n\nthe parties agreed Massachusetts law applied and there was \"at\n\nleast a 'reasonable relation' between the dispute and the forum\n\n\n\n\n                                - 8 -\n\fwhose law has been selected by the parties\" (quoting Bird v.\n\nCentennial Ins. Co., 11 F.3d 228, 231 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993))).\n\n          Among those principles is the familiar instruction that\n\n\"[i]nterpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.\"\n\nTodd v. Vt. Mut. Ins. Co., 137 A.3d 1115, 1120 (N.H. 2016).      We\n\nexamine \"the plain and ordinary meaning of the words in context\"\n\nto construe the policy's terms \"as would a reasonable person in\n\nthe position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of\n\nthe policy as a whole.\"    Id. (quoting Great Am. Dining, Inc. v.\n\nPhila. Indem. Ins. Co., 62 A.3d 843, 846 (N.H. 2013)).   Our inquiry\n\nmust be objective, so where the policy is \"clear and unambiguous,\"\n\nwe will \"accord the language its natural and ordinary meaning.\"\n\nNewell v. Markel Corp., 145 A.3d 127, 130 (N.H. 2016) (quoting\n\nColony Ins. Co. v. Dover Indoor Climbing Gym, 974 A.2d 399, 401\n\n(N.H. 2009)).   But, \"[i]f more than one reasonable interpretation\n\nis possible, and an interpretation provides coverage, the policy\n\ncontains an ambiguity and will be construed against the insurer.\"\n\nBrickley v. Progressive N. Ins. Co., 7 A.3d 1215, 1217 (N.H. 2010)\n\n(quoting Cath. Med. Ctr. v. Exec. Risk Indem., 867 A.2d 453, 456\n\n(N.H. 2005)).\n\n                               III.\n\n          On appeal, both the Lynnway defendants and the victim\n\ndefendants contend that the coverage provided by the broad insuring\n\nclause of the Primary Policy survives that policy's auto business\n\n\n                               - 9 -\n\fexclusion as well as its suspended license exclusion.            They also\n\ninsist that the Umbrella Policy separately provides coverage.\n\n                                    A.\n\n          We consider first the Primary Policy.       The parties agree\n\nthat Lynnway and Hartwell are covered under the Primary Policy\n\nunless one of the two exclusions relied upon by Motorists applies.\n\nLike the parties, we train our attention first on the auto business\n\nexclusion.    As modified by the New Hampshire Endorsement, that\n\nexclusion excepts from the definition of insureds \"[s]omeone using\n\na covered 'auto' while he or she is working in a business of\n\nselling, servicing or repairing 'autos' unless that business is\n\nyours.\"   The \"yours\" in this language refers to a named insured -\n\n- in this case, Nashua.    Defendants argue, first, that Lynnway was\n\nnot \"in a business of selling, servicing, or repairing autos.\"\n\nSecond, they argue that even if Lynnway was in such a business,\n\nthat business was Nashua's.      We address these arguments in turn.\n\n                                    1.\n\n          Defendants' contention that Lynnway and its employee\n\nwere not in the business of selling autos warrants only a brief\n\ndiscussion,   as   they   were   plainly   engaged   in   that   business.\n\nLynnway's Articles of Incorporation describe it as \"a general\n\nautomobile auction business\" whose purpose is \"to auction, sell\n\nand distribute automobiles\" and \"[t]o engage in the business of\n\npurchasing, . . . [and] selling . . . all types of new and used\n\n\n                                  - 10 -\n\fautomobiles.\"    The Lynnway defendants principally argue that an\n\nauctioneer who never takes title to the goods sold acts merely as\n\na broker, rather than the seller (or offeror) of the goods.       But\n\nunder the plain language of the policy, we focus not on whether\n\nLynnway took title to the auto.         We focus instead on whether\n\nHartwell and Lynnway were working in a business of selling autos.\n\n          Under New Hampshire law, we are bound to consider \"the\n\nplain and ordinary meaning\" of the exclusion language \"as would a\n\nreasonable person in the position of the insured.\"    Todd, 137 A.3d\n\nat 1120 (quoting Great Am. Dining, 62 A.3d at 846).     A reasonable\n\nperson understands that an auction is a sale, and thus that someone\n\nengaged in an auction business is engaged in a selling business.\n\nSee Auction,    Black's Law Dictionary    (11th ed. 2019) (defining\n\n\"auction\" as \"[a] public sale of property to the highest bidder;\n\na sale by consecutive bidding, intended to reach the highest price\n\nof the article through competition for it\"); Auction, Merriam-\n\nWebster   Online     Dictionary,   https://www.merriam-webster.com/\n\ndictionary/auction    (last   visited    Nov. 22,   2022)   (defining\n\n\"auction\" as \"a sale of property to the highest bidder\").     Indeed,\n\nthe Lynnway defendants' own brief elsewhere appears to adopt this\n\ncommonsense understanding, referring to Lynnway's business as\n\n\"engaged in the activity of selling cars for AutoFair at the time\n\nof the accident.\"    In the absence of any authority holding that\n\nonly someone with title to goods can be engaged in a business of\n\n\n                               - 11 -\n\fselling those goods, we decline to adopt defendants' strained\n\nreading of the unambiguous policy language.3   See Russell v. NGM\n\nIns. Co., 176 A.3d 196, 200 (N.H. 2017) (\"For an ambiguity to\n\nexist, the disagreement must be reasonable. . . .    [T]his court\n\nwill not perform amazing feats of linguistic gymnastics to find a\n\npurported ambiguity simply to construe the policy against the\n\ninsurer and create coverage where it is clear that none was\n\nintended.\" (quoting Bartlett v. Com. Ins. Co., 114 A.3d 724, 733\n\n(N.H. 2015))).4\n\n                                2.\n\n          As an alternative, defendants contend that any selling\n\nbusiness in which Lynnway and Hartwell were engaged at the time of\n\nthe accident was Nashua's business.     This contention fares no\n\nbetter than the first.   As just established, Lynnway and Hartwell\n\n\n     3  The Lynnway defendants invoke several Massachusetts\nstatutes defining \"dealer,\" \"owner,\" and \"seller\" to support their\nargument that they were not in the business of selling autos. See\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, \u00a7 1; id. ch. 106, \u00a7 2-103(1)(a), (d). But\nthese statutes largely bear on irrelevant questions, such as\nwhether Lynnway was an auto \"dealer,\" or what obligations Nashua\nhad as the owner of the auto being sold. At best, these statutes\nclarify who is \"the seller\" of an auto in a given transaction.\nNone shed light on the separate inquiry of why the \"business of\nselling autos\" under New Hampshire law must be construed to\nencompass   only  the   title-holding   seller   and  to   exclude\nauctioneers.\n     4  Because we find that Lynnway and Hartwell were working in\na business of selling autos, we need not consider Motorists'\nalternative argument that they were working in a business of\n\"servicing\" autos, on account of Lynnway's washing and refueling\nthe cars it auctioned.\n\n\n                              - 12 -\n\fwere at that time engaged in a particular method of selling:         They\n\nwere auctioning the Jeep.         And it is undisputed that Nashua was\n\nnot itself an auction house -- it engaged with other entities,\n\nlike Lynnway, for this purpose.           So while Nashua can fairly be\n\nsaid to have retained Lynnway to sell its vehicle, we see nothing\n\nin that relationship to suggest that Lynnway's independent auction\n\nbusiness had been converted into an arm of Nashua's business.            Cf.\n\nCarney v. Erie Ins. Co., 434 S.E.2d 374, 377, 379 (W. Va. 1993)\n\n(holding that the \"unless the business is yours\" exception in a\n\nnearly identical auto business exclusion did not apply because the\n\npolicyholder \"did not own the automobile business\" that she was\n\nworking for when the accident occurred).\n\n            Defendants   resist    this   conclusion,   arguing   that   we\n\nshould read \"business\" to mean the \"activity\" of selling the car.\n\nSo construed, one might then say, as defendants do, that Lynnway\n\nand Hartwell were engaged in Nashua's \"business\" because they \"were\n\nusing Nashua's vehicle in support of Nashua's efforts to sell its\n\nvehicle.\"   At the least, defendants maintain that it is ambiguous\n\nwhether the exclusion refers to a business entity or a business\n\nactivity, and thus that the ambiguity should be construed against\n\nthe insurer.5\n\n\n     5  Defendants also urge us to consider the import of Nautilus\nInsurance Co. v. Ferreira, No. 1:20-cv-1053-JL, 2021 WL 3677713\n(D.N.H. Aug. 19, 2021), for the question whether Lynnway was\nworking in Nashua's business. But that case examined materially\n\n\n                                   - 13 -\n\f           We are unpersuaded.     In reading language in an insurance\n\npolicy, we consider the context, see Great Am. Dining, 62 A.3d at\n\n846 (\"We look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy's\n\nwords in context.\"), the reasonable expectations of the insured,\n\nsee Contoocook Valley Sch. Dist. v. Graphic Arts Mut. Ins. Co.,\n\n788 A.2d 259, 261 (N.H. 2001), and the purpose of the language in\n\nquestion, Tech-Built 153, Inc. v. Va. Sur. Co., 898 A.2d 1007,\n\n1009   (N.H.   2006)   (\"The   fundamental   goal   of   interpreting   an\n\ninsurance policy, as in all contracts, is to carry out the intent\n\nof the contracting parties.       To discern the parties' intent, we\n\nfirst examine the language of the contract itself.\" (citations\n\nomitted)).\n\n           Here, the language at issue plainly aims at making sure\n\nthat coverage does not extend in general to persons or entities\n\nworking in any business of selling autos, while at the same time\n\ncarving out an exception.       The issue posed here is the reach of\n\nthat exception.    Clearly it preserves coverage for Nashua and its\n\nemployees.     Construing the \"business\" that is \"yours\" to mean\n\nNashua's business enterprise -- i.e., its dealership that sells\n\n\n\ndifferent policy language that excluded coverage for certain\nworkers \"[d]irectly or indirectly performing duties related to the\nconduct of any insured's business.\"     Id. at *3, *6.    Plainly,\nwhether someone's work duties are \"[d]irectly or indirectly . . .\nrelated to the conduct of any insured's business\" is a\nsubstantially broader inquiry than whether that person is working\nin the insured's business.\n\n\n                                  - 14 -\n\fautos -- fully accomplishes this aim.    Defendants, though, urge a\n\nbroader reading of business to mean \"business activity,\" which\n\nthey construe to mean the activity of auctioning the Jeep.    They\n\nthen assume that that activity is a part of Nashua's activity of\n\nselling the Jeep.\n\n          We see no reason to adopt such a broad reading.        No\n\nreasonable insured that procured the policy would ordinarily have\n\nany interest in paying for a policy that provided coverage for\n\nanother person who works for another unrelated seller of autos.\n\nPresumably, this is likely why neither Nashua -- which obtained\n\nthe policy -- nor the insurer voices any support for construing\n\nthe policy as deeming Hartwell or Lynnway to be an insured.\n\nRather, the auto business that assumes control of the vehicle\n\nshould turn to its own insurer to cover any losses.   See Borden v.\n\nProgressive Direct Ins. Co., 30 N.E.3d 856, 858 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n2015).   And that is the precise situation here:   Lynnway retained\n\nits own insurance policies, the providers of which have conceded\n\nthe availability of coverage.    It also strikes us as contrived to\n\nsay that Hartwell was working in Nashua's business.   Certainly, if\n\nasked at the time of the accident to name which business he worked\n\nin, he would not have said Nashua's.\n\n          The fact that Hartwell was employed by and subject to\n\nthe control of Lynnway reinforces our conclusion that he was not\n\nworking in Nashua's business.   Courts across the country recognize\n\n\n                                - 15 -\n\fthat the exclusion at issue here is \"based on the assumption that\n\nthe lack of control over the insured vehicle increases the risk to\n\nthe owner's insurer.\"    Borden, 30 N.E.3d at 857\u201358 (citing Haley\n\nv. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 202 S.E.2d 838, 840 (Ga. Ct.\n\nApp. 1973)); see also Grisham v. Allstate Ins. Co., 992 P.2d 891,\n\n893 (N.M. Ct. App. 1999) (\"Lack of control increases risk to the\n\nowner's insurer, a risk that is neither included in the policy nor\n\ncalculated in the premium charged to the owner.\"); Carney, 434\n\nS.E.2d at 378 (W. Va. 1993) (discussing same explanation supplied\n\nby 7 Am. Jur. 2d Automobile Insurance \u00a7 90 (1990)).          If we were to\n\nconclude that the relevant business was a unitary \"activity\" of\n\nselling Nashua's cars, and that that \"business\" was Nashua's, then\n\nthe auto business exclusion would appear to be inapplicable in\n\nmost of the circumstances for when its purpose would seem to make\n\nit applicable, at least when included in a garage coverage policy\n\nfor auto dealers. One who uses with permission an insured dealer's\n\nvehicle in a \"selling, servicing[,] or repairing\" business would\n\nseemingly always be able to argue that their use also necessarily\n\nsupported   Nashua's   business    activity   of   selling    autos.   We\n\nspecifically asked counsel for each set of defendants at oral\n\nargument to identify some situation in which, under their reading\n\nof this policy's auto business exclusion and its exception, it\n\nwould actually exclude coverage.      Neither could do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                  - 16 -\n\f          The Lynnway defendants respond that AutoFair or Nashua\n\nexerted some de facto control over the Jeep while it was being\n\nauctioned by Lynnway, due to certain features of the businesses'\n\nextensive commercial relationship, including that AutoFair had use\n\nof an office at Lynnway's premises and could make certain decisions\n\nabout how its cars were sold.       But nothing in the policy suggests\n\nthat this type of control is equivalent to making the auction\n\nbusiness Nashua's or AutoFair's business.       On all occasions when\n\na dealership permits another business to sell, service, or repair\n\none of its vehicles, the dealer presumably always retains some\n\ncontrol over the transaction.         Exerting some influence over a\n\nbusiness's   operations   through    mutually   beneficial   commercial\n\narrangements does not make that business \"yours.\"       Hence, we are\n\nstill left with the conclusion that defendants' reading is wrong.6\n\n          To be sure, defendants dispute the precise degree of\n\n\"control\" Nashua relinquished or retained over the disposition of\n\nthe vehicle at auction, and by extension dispute whether the\n\nexclusion's normative underpinnings apply here.       But this misses\n\nthe forest for the trees.    Regardless of whether Nashua had some\n\ninput on whether and how its vehicle would be sold, defendants do\n\nnot contest that Nashua surrendered the Jeep's keys to Lynnway so\n\n\n\n     6  We hasten to add that nothing in this opinion bears on the\nentirely different question of whether the actions of the named\ninsured Nashua render it liable to any defendants.\n\n\n                                - 17 -\n\fthat Lynnway's employee could drive the vehicle for its independent\n\nbusiness of selling autos by auction.7                        A reasonable entity in\n\neither party's position would not expect its own garage policy to\n\ncover another auto-selling business.\n\n                  Defendants marshal the same set of business-relationship\n\nfacts       in    support     of   an    argument    concerning       Nashua's        \"garage\n\noperations.\"            The Primary Policy defines \"garage operations\" to\n\ninclude          \"all   operations       necessary    or    incidental       to   a    garage\n\nbusiness.\"         Defendants argue that Lynnway's auction was \"necessary\n\nand incidental\" to Nashua's ability to sell its cars and thus part\n\nof    its    garage      operations.         This    argument      may   have     had    some\n\nrelevance were we considering the language of the exclusion before\n\nthe    New        Hampshire    Endorsement,         as     the    original     exclusion's\n\nexception read \"unless that business is your 'garage operations.'\"\n\nBut seeing as that language has been modified by the endorsement\n\nto    eliminate         the   reference      to     garage       operations,      and   that\n\ndefendants concede the                  endorsement applies, whether Lynnway's\n\n\n\n\n       7For the same reason, defendants' invocation of a\nMassachusetts statutory presumption that a vehicle's owner is\nlegally responsible, in the event of an accident, for the conduct\nof the vehicle's driver, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 85A\u2013B --\na presumption that can be rebutted by evidence to the contrary,\nsee Cheek v. Econo-Car Rental Sys. of Bos., Inc., 473 N.E.2d 659,\n660\u201361 (Mass. 1985) -- also misses the mark even assuming New\nHampshire law also recognized such a presumption.\n\n\n                                            - 18 -\n\fauction was part of Nashua's \"garage operations\" simply has no\n\nbearing on the case now before us.8\n\n          Finally, the Lynnway defendants assert that our reading\n\nwould create surplusage in the policy, specifically by reading out\n\nthe different coverage treatment that the Primary Policy provides\n\nfor \"employees\" and \"anyone else\" using a covered auto.    Not so.\n\n\"Employees\" are simply a subset of \"anyone else,\" a category that\n\nincludes everyone other than \"[y]ou, your executives and . . .\n\nmembers (if you are a limited liability company).\" While employees\n\nare subject to certain special provisions under the policy, Nashua\n\nemployees driving Nashua vehicles are covered under the general\n\nprovision that grants coverage to \"[a]nyone else while using with\n\nyour permission a covered 'auto' you own\" -- and such employees\n\nare not subject to the auto business exclusion because the business\n\nthey are working in is Nashua's.\n\n          In sum, we find that the Primary Policy's auto business\n\nexclusion defines the policy's insureds so as to exclude Lynnway\n\nand Hartwell from coverage for the underlying claims here.      We\n\ntherefore need not take up the parties' alternative arguments\n\nconcerning the Primary Policy's suspended license exclusion.\n\n\n     8  For the same reason, we need not discuss defendants'\nargument that we ought reach the same outcome as Blue Ridge Auto\nAuction v. Acceptance Indemnity Insurance Co., which considered a\nversion of the exclusion that retained the \"unless that business\nis your 'garage operations'\" formulation. 807 S.E.2d 51, 54 (Ga.\nCt. App. 2017).\n\n\n                              - 19 -\n\f                                       B.\n\n            Defendants    next      contend   that    the   Umbrella   Policy\n\nprovides    coverage    for   the    underlying      claims.    This   policy\n\nseparately defines the insureds for its own purposes and excludes\n\nfrom that definition those employed by an \"auto sales agency.\"\n\nBoth groups of appellants argue this is an ambiguous term and so\n\nshould be construed narrowly to exclude only auto dealerships,\n\nwhich would presumptively leave Lynnway within the definition of\n\ninsureds.    Motorists points out that this particular argument was\n\nraised to but not addressed by the district court below.               Rather,\n\nthe district court agreed with Motorists' contention that the\n\nUmbrella Policy provides no coverage for the underlying claims\n\nbecause it is limited by its Following Form Endorsement, which\n\nprovides that the Umbrella Policy \"does not apply\" to auto coverage\n\n\"[e]xcept as coverage is available to you in the underlying\n\npolicies.\"   See Motorists, 549 F. Supp. 3d at 230\u201331.           Neither set\n\nof appellants discusses, much less contests, Motorists' contention\n\nor the grounds on which the district court decided the issue below.\n\nIn the absence of any preserved challenge, we have no reason not\n\nto assume that the district court was correct that the Umbrella\n\nPolicy applies only to the extent auto coverage is provided in the\n\nPrimary Policy.        Id. at 230.      Certainly the caselaw seems to\n\nprovide comfort in making this assumption.            See Jalbert ex rel. F2\n\nLiquidating Tr. v. Zurich Servs. Corp., 953 F.3d 143, 148 (1st\n\n\n                                     - 20 -\n\fCir. 2020) (applying Massachusetts law in finding that the disputed\n\npolicy was \"a 'follow-form' policy . . . , meaning that coverage\n\nis subject to the terms and conditions of the primary policy\");\n\nInsituform Techs., Inc. v. Am. Home Assurance Co., 566 F.3d 274,\n\n278 (1st Cir. 2009) (\"The phrase 'follow form' refers to the\n\npractice, common in excess policies, of having the second-layer\n\ncoverage follow substantively the primary layer provided by the\n\nmain insurer.\" (citing 2 Ostrager & Newman, Handbook on Insurance\n\nCoverage Disputes \u00a7 13.01 (11th ed. 2002))).       Given that the\n\nunderlying Primary Policy does not cover the claimed liabilities,\n\nwe need linger no longer on the Umbrella Policy.\n\n                               IV.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              - 21 -\n\f",
