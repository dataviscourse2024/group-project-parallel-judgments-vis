WR-62,593-04\n\n\n\n               EX PARTE BERNARDO ABAN TERCERO, Applicant\n\n\n\n  ON APPLICATION FOR POST-CONVICTION WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\n   AND MOTION TO STAY THE EXECUTION FROM CAUSE NO. 762351\n              IN THE 232 ND JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT\n                          HARRIS COUNTY\n\n       Per curiam. M EYERS, J., dissents.\n\n                                        ORDER\n\n       This is a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to the\n\nprovisions of Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 11.071 \u00a7 5 and a motion to stay\n\napplicant\u2019s execution.1\n\n       In October 2000, a jury found applicant guilty of the offense of capital murder.\n\nThe jury answered the special issues submitted pursuant to Article 37.071, and the trial\n\n\n      1\n        Unless otherwise indicated all references to Articles refer to the Code of\nCriminal Procedure.\n\f                                                                                  Tercero - 2\n\ncourt, accordingly, set applicant\u2019s punishment at death.\n\n       This Court affirmed applicant\u2019s conviction and sentence on direct appeal. Tercero\n\nv. State, No. AP-73,992 (Tex. Crim. App. Sept. 18, 2002)(not designated for publication).\n\nThis Court denied relief on applicant\u2019s initial post-conviction application for a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus and dismissed his first subsequent writ application. Ex parte Tercero, Nos.\n\nWR-62,593-01 and WR-62,593-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Nov. 16, 2005)(not designated for\n\npublication).\n\n       In his second subsequent writ application, applicant alleged that he was younger\n\nthan 18 years of age when he committed the crime for which he was sentenced to death.\n\nThe Court found that the application met the requirements of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5 and\n\nremanded the application to the trial court. The trial court found that applicant had failed\n\nto show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was younger than 18 years of age\n\nwhen he committed the offense. The Court reviewed the record, adopted the trial court\u2019s\n\nfindings and conclusions, and denied relief. Ex parte Tercero, No. WR-62,593-03 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. Mar. 3, 2010)(not designated for publication).\n\n       On August 24, 2015, applicant filed in the trial court a subsequent application for a\n\nwrit of habeas corpus. In this subsequent application, applicant asserts that he was denied\n\ndue process because the State presented false testimony at his trial.\n\n       After reviewing applicant\u2019s subsequent application, we find that he has satisfied\n\nthe requirements of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5. Accordingly, we remand the application to the\n\f                                                                                Tercero - 3\n\ntrial court to review the merits of the claim. Applicant\u2019s execution is stayed pending\n\nresolution of this application.\n\n       IT IS SO ORDERED THIS THE 25 th DAY OF AUGUST, 2015.\n\nDo Not Publish\n\f",
