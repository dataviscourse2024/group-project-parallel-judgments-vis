Defendant\u2019s conviction of felony murder must stand because the victim was killed in the course of the burglary (see, People v Joyner, 26 NY2d 106).\nThe other issues raised by defendant have not been preserved for review and we decline to address them in the interest of justice. Weinstein, J. P, Rubin, Lawrence and Kunzeman, JJ, concur.\n",
