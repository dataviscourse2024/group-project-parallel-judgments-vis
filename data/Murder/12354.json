TIMOTHY WAYNE HOLLAND\n\n                Direct Appeal from the Criminal Court for Robertson County\n                          No. 00-0188    Michael R. Jones, Judge\n\n\n\n                  No. M2001-03129-CCA-R3-CD - Filed September 4, 2002\n\n\nThe defendant was convicted of facilitation of aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary for his\nparticipation with a codefendant in robbing a resident of a Springfield motel and burglarizing his\nroom. The trial court sentenced him as a Range I, standard offender to an effective sentence of six\nyears. Following the denial of his motion for a new trial, he filed a timely appeal to this court,\nraising the following issues: (1) whether the trial court properly denied his motion for a new trial\nbased on his claim of an improper closing by the State; and (2) whether the trial court properly\ndenied his request for a jury instruction on accessory after the fact. Based on our review, we affirm\nthe judgment of the trial court.\n\n     Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Criminal Court Affirmed\n\nALAN E. GLENN, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which DAVID G. HAYES and ROBERT W.\nWEDEMEYER, JJ., joined.\n\nLee Borthick, Springfield, Tennessee (on appeal); Roger Eric Nell, District Public Defender; and\nCharles S. Bloodworth, Assistant Public Defender (at trial), for the appellant, Timothy Wayne\nHolland.\n\nPaul G. Summers, Attorney General & Reporter; Helena Walton Yarbrough, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral; John Wesley Carney, Jr., District Attorney General; and Dent Morriss, Assistant District\nAttorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                            OPINION\n\n                                              FACTS\n\n        The defendant, Timothy Wayne Holland, was charged by a Robertson County Grand Jury in\na five-count indictment with aggravated robbery, a Class B felony; aggravated burglary, a Class C\nfelony; theft of property over $1000, a Class D felony; evading arrest, a Class A misdemeanor; and\nassault, a Class A misdemeanor. The State subsequently dismissed the latter three counts of the\n\findictment, electing at the defendant\u2019s November 6-7, 2001, trial to proceed solely on the counts of\naggravated robbery and aggravated burglary, charges stemming from an incident that occurred in a\nSpringfield motel room on the afternoon of December 20, 1999.\n\n        The State\u2019s first witness was the victim, Jimmy Lee Wright, who testified that he was\ntemporarily living in a room at the Royal Inn in Springfield in December 1999, having just moved\nback to the area from out-of-state. Although the motel was rundown, it was cheap, which enabled\nhim to save the money he made as a painting contractor to apply toward getting a permanent\nresidence. On December 20, 1999, he came home from work at approximately 4:00 p.m. to find a\nnote on his door addressed to \u201cMelissa.\u201d Knowing no one by that name, he took the note down, went\ninto his room, and took a shower. Soon thereafter, he heard a knock at his door. After throwing a\npillow over some cash he had lying on the bed, he opened the door to find two young African-\nAmerican men who said they were looking for Melissa. He told the men he did not know any\nMelissa, and shut the door. The men immediately knocked again. When he opened the door the\nsecond time, one of the men pressed a gun against his head, and both men pushed him against a wall\nand entered the room, cursing and demanding his money. Inside the room, the men made him open\nhis mouth, and inserted the gun.\n\n        The victim positively identified the defendant as the man who entered his room immediately\nbehind the gunman. Although the gunman did most of the talking, the defendant also \u201ctalked some,\u201d\nsaying, \u201cWhere\u2019s the money and you won\u2019t get hurt.\u201d When he pointed to the bed, the defendant\nwent over, moved the pillow, saw the money, and picked it up. The victim said he had about $900\nin cash on his bed: $400 in a money clip and a little over $500 in a pay envelope he had just received\nfrom his job. In addition, he had six $100 bills hidden inside the nightstand beside his bed, along\nwith a bowl full of loose change. After the defendant took the money that was on the bed, the\ngunman ordered him to go into the bathroom and lie down in the bathtub. From there, he was able\nto hear the men rummaging through his belongings in the bedroom.\n\n        The victim testified that the two men came into the bathroom about three different times\nduring the ten to fifteen minutes they spent in his room. The first time they came into the bathroom,\nthe gunman accused him of lying to them. Calling him a \u201cno good MF,\u201d the men told the victim that\nthey were going to put \u201ca cap\u201d in his \u201cass,\u201d threatening to kill him if he did not tell them where all\nhis money was. Both men talked at once, with some of the threats coming from the gunman and\nsome from the defendant. Next, the gunman came back into the bathroom with some rubbing\nalcohol, holding a cigarette lighter and \u201claughing real crazy.\u201d The defendant, who was with him, was\nalso laughing. The men first poured the alcohol all over him and then poured it all over the room,\nsaying, \u201c[W]e going to torch you you no good white piece of trash.\u201d As the victim prayed in the\nbathroom, he heard the men talking in his room. It then got quiet, and the victim realized they had\nleft. Before they left, however, they told him that they knew where he worked, knew his car, and\nwould return the coming weekend, after he got paid, to get the rest of his money. Regarding these\nthreats, the victim testified that the defendant was \u201cright in the middle of it just as deep as the other\nguy.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                                  -2-\n\f        The victim estimated that the total amount of money taken from him was $1500, which did\nnot include the value of the bowl of change taken from his nightstand. In addition to the cash, the\nmen also took business cards he had used for a painting business he had operated in South Carolina,\ntwo watches, lottery tickets, his telephone, and a carton of cigarettes. After he was sure the men had\ngone, he made a \u201cmad dash\u201d to the motel office, where the manager telephoned the police. The\nfollowing day, he saw some of his possessions in the office of Detective Terry Dorris of the\nSpringfield Police Department. The victim identified a photograph of the recovered items, which,\nhe said, showed his telephone, lottery tickets, and business cards. He said he had never seen either\nman before they appeared at his door. He had had no difficulty in picking both men\u2019s photographs\nout of separate photographic lineups shown to him by the police.\n\n        On cross-examination, the victim acknowledged that he had failed to mention, in the\nstatement he gave police immediately after the crimes, that the defendant had talked or that he had\nbeen standing right behind the gunman inside the bathroom. He insisted, however, that the\ndefendant was a full participant with the gunman in the crimes, testifying, \u201cI just know that [the\ndefendant] was there [in the bathroom] and he was right behind [the gunman]. And the exact words\nhe said, I did not record every word he said by memory, but I know he was talking.\u201d\n\n        The State\u2019s next witness, Teresa Swinson, began her testimony by acknowledging that she\nwas currently in prison on a parole violation. She testified that she was classified as a career\ncriminal, and that her long history of \u201cdifficulties\u201d with the law, including many prior convictions\nfor forgery, stemmed from her abuse of drugs, primarily cocaine. However, she was currently drug-\nfree and possessed a clear memory of the events of December 20, 1999. On that day she was in a\nroom at the Royal Inn when three people, with whom she had had an earlier association, came into\nher room: a younger African-American man in his twenties; an older African-American man, whom\nshe positively identified as the defendant; and a young, blonde-headed Caucasian woman who was\n\u201cprobably in her 20s also.\u201d The defendant told the woman to stay in Swinson\u2019s room, and left with\nthe younger man. When the men returned to her room approximately ten or fifteen minutes later,\nthey began \u201cpulling stuff out of their pockets,\u201d including change, cash, pocketknives, cigarettes that\nwere still in the carton, a cordless telephone, and some business cards.\n\n       Swinson identified Exhibit 1, previously identified by the victim as a photograph of his\ntelephone, business cards, and lottery tickets, as items the men had brought into the room and which\nshe had later turned over to Detective Richard Head of the Robertson County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\nWhen asked which man had the property, she hesitantly answered \u201cthe younger gentleman,\u201d but\nimmediately added, \u201cThey were just pulling out stuff so fast, you know. Everything just really\nhappened fast. And everything at that time was on the bed, you know. They were going through it.\u201d\nShe saw the younger man lay a gun on the bed, but got only a brief look because both men were\n\u201cvery nervous . . . [t]rying to hurry up and rumble through stuff.\u201d After asking her to get rid of the\ncordless telephone and business cards, the men took the rest of the property, including the cash, and\ndeparted with the woman. Shortly after their departure, Detective Terry Dorris knocked on\nSwinson\u2019s door and asked to search her room, telling her that a robbery had just occurred and that\nthe suspects had been seen entering her room. Although she allowed him inside to search, she did\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fnot inform him of what had transpired in her room and did not turn over to him the items she had\nbeen given, opting instead to later telephone Detective Head, inform him of the situation, and turn\nthe items over to him. Swinson explained that she did not want to be seen talking to a police officer\nat the motel, and that she knew and trusted Detective Head, having had dealings with him in the\nrecent past.\n\n        Swinson claimed that she had had no knowledge of how the men obtained the property. She\nsaid that she had not been involved in the crimes, and that her parole violation had nothing to do with\nthe instant case. She acknowledged on cross-examination that she had additional charges pending\nagainst her, but said she had not been promised anything by the State in exchange for her testimony\nin the case.\n\n        The State\u2019s last witness was Springfield Police Department Detective Terry Scott Dorris, who\nconducted the investigation of the case. He testified that he interviewed the victim at the motel\nimmediately after the crimes, and later at the police department. At some point during his\ninvestigation, he showed the victim a series of photographs of different individuals. The victim first\nidentified the gunman, Antonio Dowlen, and later, the defendant.1 The victim expressed no\nhesitation or uncertainty when identifying the defendant. Detective Dorris confirmed that the\nproperty he had recovered and returned to the victim had been turned over to him by Detective Head.\nOn cross-examination, he acknowledged that Antonio Dowlen fled to the Metropolitan Nashville\narea after the crimes, where he was arrested approximately six months later, while the defendant,\nwho was arrested after fleeing from bicycle patrol officers who had spotted him on the street,\nremained in the Springfield vicinity. Dorris testified that he had not seen or talked to the defendant\nbefore his arrest.\n\n        The defendant began his defense proof by recalling Detective Dorris to the stand, whose\nmemory defense counsel had refreshed during the break. Detective Dorris testified he now recalled\nthat the defendant, accompanied by another individual he had been seeking in connection with a\ndifferent robbery, had voluntarily come to his office to talk with him on January 4, 2000. He had\ntaken the defendant\u2019s photograph at that time, and it was that photograph he had used in the January\n6 photographic lineup in which the victim had identified the defendant.\n\n        The twenty-five-year-old defendant also elected to testify in his own defense. He said that\nhe and Antonio Dowlen, who was about 20 or 21, had basically grown up together, having lived\nacross the street from each other as children. On December 20, 1999, he was at the Royal Inn when\nhe ran into Dowlen, who owed him $25. He asked Dowlen for his money. Dowlen responded by\ntelling him that a man at the motel owed him some money, leading the defendant to believe that\nDowlen knew the victim. The defendant said that he went with Dowlen to the victim\u2019s room, and\ndescribed what next ensued:\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           The victim identified Do wlen on De cember 2 2, 19 99, and the defendant on January 6 , 200 0.\n\n                                                          -4-\n\f                        He knocked on the door. [The victim] opened the door.\n               Antonio asked him where is the money and pulled out a gun. [The\n               victim] said I don\u2019t have your money. We go into the room. Antonio\n               still got the gun on [the victim] and he asked him about the money.\n               Then he tell him to go to the bathroom. When they go to the\n               bathroom I heard [the victim] holler.\n\n        The defendant testified that when he heard the victim yell, he left the room and headed\ntoward the motel breezeway. Dowlen caught up with him about halfway between the breezeway and\nthe other side of the motel, told him he had gotten $50, and gave him the $25 he was owed. At that\npoint, he did not know that Dowlen had robbed the victim, believing instead the story that Dowlen\ntold him, which was that the victim had owed Dowlen money for drugs. The defendant said that he\ndid not have a gun, and did not threaten the victim or pour rubbing alcohol on him. The only money\nhe took was the $25 Dowlen owed him.\n\n       The defendant claimed that the first time he learned of the robbery was about a week later,\nwhen he heard from Teresa Swinson that the police wanted to question him and Dowlen about a\nrobbery. He said he also got a telephone call sometime around Christmas from a man named\nAntonio Jones, who informed him that Dowlen had robbed the victim. When he confronted Dowlen,\nDowlen told him, \u201c[D]on\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll take my charge.\u201d On January 4, he went to see\nDetective Dorris, who took his photograph. On January 10, six days after he had turned himself in,\nhe was arrested. Approximately six months later, Dowlen was arrested. He did not know Dowlen\u2019s\nwhereabouts during the months that transpired between his arrest and Dowlen\u2019s arrest.\n\n       On cross-examination, the defendant testified that he had just been released from prison after\nserving time for an aggravated assault conviction, and, therefore, would not have had anything to do\nwith Dowlen had he known that Dowlen had a gun. He denied taking the victim\u2019s money off the\nbed, but admitted that he was in the victim\u2019s room with Dowlen. He did not know the victim and\nhad no explanation for the victim\u2019s testimony against him, other than to speculate that the victim\nmay have been coached to lie. He was unable to offer an explanation as to why someone would have\ncoached the victim to lie.\n\n        In rebuttal, the State recalled the victim to the stand, who testified that he had not owed\nanyone any money for drugs. The victim also affirmed his earlier testimony that the defendant had\nparticipated with Dowlen in the crimes.\n\n        After deliberating, the jury convicted the defendant of aggravated burglary and facilitation\nof aggravated robbery, a lesser-included offense of aggravated robbery. In his motion for a new trial,\nthe defendant asserted, inter alia, that the State made improper comments during closing argument\nand that the trial court erred by failing to provide jury instructions on accessory after the fact. The\ntrial court overruled the motion, and the defendant filed a timely appeal to this court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\f                                            ANALYSIS\n\n                                       I. Closing Argument\n\n        As his first issue, the defendant contends that the State made improper comments regarding\nhis credibility in its closing argument, thereby depriving him of a fair trial. He argues that the\nprosecutor\u2019s comment that he had an interest in the outcome of the case because he was the\ndefendant, \u201ccrossed the line of proper argument and insinuated that any defendant\u2019s testimony should\nbe per se less believable than that of any other witness.\u201d The State responds by arguing that the\ndefendant has waived the issue by his failure to raise a timely objection at trial. The State further\nargues that, even if not waived, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were proper under the facts, law, and\ncircumstances of this case. We agree with the State.\n\n        The manner and conduct of closing argument is left to the discretion of the trial court. State\nv. Bigbee, 885 S.W.2d 797, 809 (Tenn. 1994). Generally, both the State and the defense are afforded\nwide latitude in the scope of their closing argument to the jury. Id. The trial court, in turn, is\nafforded wide discretion in its determination of the propriety of closing argument, and its decision\nin these matters will not be reversed on appeal absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. See State\nv. Middlebrooks, 995 S.W.2d 550, 557 (Tenn. 1999); Coker v. State, 911 S.W.2d 357, 368 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. 1995); State v. Zirkle 910 S.W.2d 874, 888 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995). A party\u2019s closing\nargument \u201cmust be temperate, predicated on evidence introduced during the trial, relevant to the\nissues being tried, and not otherwise improper under the facts or law.\u201d Middlebrooks, 995 S.W.2d\nat 557. For a defendant to be granted a new trial based on the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments\nduring closing, the complained-of conduct must have affected the verdict to the prejudice of the\ndefendant. See Harrington v. State, 385 S.W.2d 758, 759 (Tenn. 1965).\n\n        We first agree with the State that the defendant has waived this issue by his failure to raise\na contemporaneous objection at trial. See Tenn. R. App. P. 36(a); State v. Little, 854 S.W.2d 643,\n651 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992) (stating that failure to object to prosecutor\u2019s alleged misconduct in\nclosing argument waives any later complaint). However, even if not waived, we conclude that this\nissue is without merit. The defendant objects to the following statements made by the prosecutor\nin closing:\n\n                        In this case the Defendant has admitted that he was previously\n               convicted of the crime of aggravated assault. Went to the penitentiary\n               for it. He was very candid. Told you all about that. It would be\n               wrong to say well, he did that crime so he must of done this one. And\n               that is not the way that you use that evidence. That\u2019s impermissible.\n               That\u2019s some kind of proof that would be like a character trait or\n               something, and that\u2019s not the way you\u2019re permitted to consider it.\n\n                       The Court will tell you that the point is the person committed\n               the crime of aggravated assault previously, prior to this case ever\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f               happened, goes to the penitentiary for it, would that person lie? In\n               other words, if a person commits a felony of aggravated assault,\n               would that person come into a courtroom and have any compulsion\n               about raising their hand and swearing that they would tell the truth\n               and then lie about it? Particularly when it\u2019s his hide in this case that\n               he\u2019s trying to safe [sic].\n\n                        So, Ladies and Gentlemen, as the Defendant tells you all the\n               reasons why you should maybe think about that this is just conduct\n               that he just kind of sort of fell into, remember when [the victim] came\n               back to the witness stand he told you no, [the defendant] didn\u2019t leave.\n               [The defendant] did not leave. Who\u2019s the person with an interest in\n               the outcome of this case?\n\n                        Naturally, I would submit [the victim] would like justice done.\n               I would submit that all participants in the trial process would like to\n               see the process work, and would like to see us get to that word called\n               truth. But there\u2019s one person here who has a reason, I submit to you,\n               an interest, or bias for the outcome of the case, and a prior felony\n               conviction, which is interesting to consider on the issue of his truth\n               telling, his credibility.\n\n        The defendant concedes that the comments regarding his prior conviction were proper, but\ncontends that the mention of his interest in the outcome of the case was an improper comment upon\nhis credibility, based not on the evidence at trial, but instead on the mere fact of his status as a\ndefendant. We respectfully disagree. The defendant cites State v. Beasley, 536 S.W.2d 328, 330\n(Tenn. 1976), as support for his contention that the prosecutor\u2019s comment regarding his interest in\nthe outcome of the case was improper. In Beasley, our supreme court held that closing argument\nshould be supported by the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from it, and that a\nprosecutor\u2019s personal opinion as to the credibility of witnesses should not be interjected into\nargument. Id. In the case at bar, the prosecutor did not interject his personal opinion as to the\ndefendant\u2019s credibility into closing argument, but instead merely asked that the jury consider, when\nevaluating the different accounts presented by the victim and the defendant, which party had an\ninterest in the outcome of the case. There was nothing improper in this request. We agree with the\nState that the defendant made his credibility a key issue by taking the stand to deny that he\nparticipated in the crimes, and by suggesting that the victim was lying when he testified that the\ndefendant was involved in the crimes. Since a resolution of conflicting testimony was key to the\ndetermination of the defendant\u2019s guilt, it was permissible for the prosecutor to argue that the jury\nconsider the bias of the defendant versus the bias of the victim when evaluating the credibility of\neach witness\u2019s testimony. We, therefore, conclude that the trial court did not err in overruling the\ndefendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on the State\u2019s allegedly improper closing argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\f                            II. Instruction on Accessory After the Fact\n\n        The defendant next contends that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on\naccessory after the fact as a lesser-included offense to the crimes, arguing that there was sufficient\nevidence at trial to warrant an instruction on the offense. The State contends that the trial court\nproperly denied the defendant\u2019s request for an instruction on accessory after the fact because it is a\nseparate and distinct offense, rather than a lesser-included offense of the crimes with which the\ndefendant was charged. The State points out that the defendant was not indicted with accessory after\nthe fact, and asserts that there was no evidence to charge the defendant with the offense. We agree\nwith the State.\n\n        Accessory after the fact is defined as follows:\n\n                (a) A person is an accessory after the fact who, after the commission\n                of a felony, with knowledge or reasonable ground to believe that the\n                offender has committed the felony, and with the intent to hinder the\n                arrest, trial, conviction or punishment of the offender:\n                     (1) Harbors or conceals the offender;\n                     (2) Provides or aids in providing the offender with any\n                     means of avoiding arrest, trial, conviction or punishment; or\n                     (3) Warns the offender of impending apprehension or\n                     discovery.\n\n                ....\n\n                 (c) Accessory after the fact is a Class E felony.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-11-411 (1997).\n\n        The defendant asserts that accessory after the fact is a lesser-included offense, and argues that\nsubsections (1) and (2) of the statute are applicable in his case based on the fact that there was no\nevidence that he revealed Dowlen\u2019s name to Detective Dorris when he spoke with him on January\n4. This court has consistently held, however, that accessory after the fact is a separate and distinct\noffense, rather than a lesser-included offense of a felony committed by the perpetrator of a crime.\nSee State v. Hodgkinson, 778 S.W.2d 54, 63 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1989) (stating that accessory after\nthe fact \u201cis a separate and distinct offense and is not a lesser included offense\u201d); State v. Hoosier,\n631 S.W.2d 474, 476 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1982) (\u201cThe offense of accessory after the fact is a separate\nand distinct crime from that of a principal.\u201d); State v. Reginald Merriweather, No. W2001-02206-\nCCA-RM-CD, 2002 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 123, at *34-*35 (Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 11, 2002)\n(holding that trial court did not err in failing to instruct jury on accessory after the fact because it is\nnot a lesser-included offense of attempted second degree murder, aggravated assault, or especially\naggravated robbery, and the defendant was not charged separately with the offense of accessory after\nthe fact); State v. Joel M. Puentes, No. M2001-01115-CCA-R3-CD, 2002 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS\n\n\n                                                   -8-\n\f92, at *11-*12 (Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 1, 2002) (concluding that a review of the issue under analysis\ndictated by State v. Burns, 6 S.W.3d 453, 466-67 (Tenn. 1999), does not change the traditional view\nthat accessory after the fact is a separate and distinct offense from the substantive offense); State v.\nJames E. (Junebug) Ligon, No. M1999-02461-CCA-R3-CD, 2001 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 29, at\n*19 (Tenn. Crim. App. Jan. 12, 2001), perm. to appeal granted and remanded on other grounds\n(Tenn. May 29, 2001) (\u201cAccessory after the fact fails to meet the definition of a lesser-included\noffense of either aggravated burglary or theft according to the Burns analysis.\u201d).\n\n        Moreover, we agree with the State that there was no evidence to warrant that the defendant\nbe charged with the offense of accessory after the fact. No proof was presented to show that the\ndefendant harbored or concealed Dowlen, or provided or aided in providing him any means of\navoiding arrest or detection. By the defendant\u2019s own testimony, he had no knowledge of Dowlen\u2019s\nwhereabouts. He was also aware that the police already had Dowlen\u2019s name as a suspect, since\nTeresa Swinson had informed him that they were seeking both him and Dowlen for questioning\nabout the crimes. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not err in refusing the defendant\u2019s\nrequest to have the jury instructed on accessory after the fact as a lesser-included offense.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n        Having reviewed the entire record in this case, we conclude that the trial court did not err in\noverruling the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on his claim of an improper closing argument\nby the State and the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on accessory after the fact. Accordingly,\nwe affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n                                                        ___________________________________\n                                                        ALAN E.
