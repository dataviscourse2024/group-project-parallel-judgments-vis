We reverse and remand.\n\n     This matter arose following the death of Antoine Wilkinson. On March\n\n28, 2015, Appellee and Wilkinson were living together. Appellee\u2019s ten-year-\n\nold brother, J.F., overheard Appellee and Wilkinson become ensnared in a\n\nheated   argument    regarding   Wilkinson\u2019s   alleged   rough   treatment   of\n\nAppellee\u2019s three-year-old son, and objects breaking while the two adults\n\nloudly argued. When J.F. entered the room, Appellee told him to go outside\n\nwith her son.     J.F. complied, but soon after, was called back into the\n\nresidence.\n\n* Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-S81003-16\n\n\n\n      Upon returning, the boy observed Wilkinson sitting on the floor.\n\nUnbeknownst to the boy, Wilkinson was either dead or dying.            Appellee\n\ndirected him to clean up broken glass scattered throughout the house. As\n\nthey cleaned, Wilkinson did not move, and J.F. noticed a knife on the floor\n\nnearby.   The police arrived some time later; however, when they arrived,\n\nthe knife was no longer in the living room.\n\n      Wilkinson died of a single, fatal stab wound to his chest.       Appellee\n\nspoke with Detective Jeff Burke who was assigned to investigate the death.\n\nShe told Detective Burke that Wilkinson had returned home with the stab\n\nwound, apparently inflicted by a third-party. Appellee identified that person,\n\nbut further investigation proved this recounting of events to be fabricated.\n\nAppellee was arrested and charged with murder generally and possession of\n\nan instrument of crime.\n\n      On September 9, 2015, a preliminary hearing was held before the\n\nPhiladelphia municipal court. The Commonwealth proffered the testimony of\n\nJ.F., Detective Burke, and stipulated to the contents of the medical\n\nexaminer\u2019s report as to Wilkinson\u2019s cause of death. Nevertheless, the court\n\nbarred the Commonwealth from pursuing a first degree murder charge,\n\nfinding no evidence that Appellee exhibited a specific intent to kill Wilkinson.\n\n      On September 14, 2015, the Commonwealth filed a notice of its intent\n\nto refile the criminal complaint. The court held a hearing on the matter on\n\nNovember 16, 2015, and after considering additional evidence, denied the\n\n                                      -2-\n\fJ-S81003-16\n\n\n\nCommonwealth\u2019s motion to refile the criminal complaint including a charge\n\nfor first degree murder.     The Commonwealth filed a timely appeal and\n\ncomplied with the trial court\u2019s directive to file a Rule 1925(b) statement of\n\nmatters complained of on appeal.       The court authored its Rule 1925(a)\n\nopinion and this matter is now ripe for review.\n\n      The Commonwealth brings one issue to our attention: \u201cDid the lower\n\ncourt err in declining to permit refiling of the charge of murder of the first\n\ndegree or murder generally where the evidence was sufficient to establish a\n\nprima facie case that [Appellee] fatally stabbed the victim in the chest?\u201d\n\nCommonwealth\u2019s brief at 1.\n\n      At a preliminary hearing the Commonwealth must establish a prima\n\nfacie case.       Commonwealth v. Claffey, 80 A.3d 780, 788 (Pa.Super.\n\n2013). A prima facie case requires evidence tending to prove the existence\n\nof each material element of the charged offenses and probable cause to\n\nbelieve the defendant committed the crimes such that, if that evidence were\n\nproffered at trial, the court would be warranted in presenting the case to the\n\nfinder-of-fact.     Id.   Whether the Commonwealth presented sufficient\n\nevidence to establish a prima facie case is a question of law.      Thus, our\n\nstandard of review is plenary, and we are not bound by the legal\n\ndeterminations of the trial court. Commonwealth v. Dantzler, 135 A.3d\n\n1109, 1112 (Pa.Super. 2016).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fJ-S81003-16\n\n\n\n      When determining whether the Commonwealth established a prima\n\nfacie case, \u201cwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nCommonwealth, and we are to consider all reasonable inferences based on\n\nthat evidence which could support a guilty verdict.\u201d         Commonwealth v.\n\nLandis, 48 A.3d 432, 444 (Pa.Super. 2012) (citation omitted).                 This\n\nstandard \u201cdoes not require that the Commonwealth prove the accused\u2019s guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt at this stage.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). Instead,\n\nthe Commonwealth must simply present evidence of each element of the\n\ncrime charged. Id.\n\n      To sustain a conviction for first-degree murder, the court must find\n\nthat: (1) a human being was unlawfully killed; (2) the defendant was\n\nresponsible for the killing; and (3) the defendant acted with malice and a\n\nspecific intent to kill, that is, a \u201cwillful, deliberate and premeditated killing.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Woodard, 129 A.3d 480, 490 (Pa. 2015); 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n\n2502(a), (d).   Specific intent to kill can be proven through circumstantial\n\nevidence, such as the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim\u2019s\n\nbody. Commonwealth v. Mattison, 82 A.3d 386, 392 (Pa. 2013).\n\n      The trial court determined that the Commonwealth failed to produce\n\nevidence of Appellee\u2019s specific intent to kill Wilkinson.     The court asserted\n\nthat the evidence proffered by the Commonwealth demonstrated that\n\nAppellee and Wilkinson were involved in a heated argument.            It observed\n\nthat, \u201c[a] single stab would under these circumstances, during a mutual\n\n                                       -4-\n\fJ-S81003-16\n\n\n\naffray, clearly demonstrates legal malice.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 3/14/16, at\n\n5. However, it stated that, \u201cwithout more, a finding of specific intent to kill\n\nwould be based on speculation rather than reasonable inference.\u201d             Id.\n\nMoreover, the court was not persuaded that Appellee\u2019s post-incident attempt\n\nto cover-up Wilkinson\u2019s death was probative of her intent to kill him.         It\n\ndiscounted this evidence, and further referred to the Commonwealth\u2019s\n\nreliance on evidence that Appellee used a deadly weapon on a vital area as a\n\n\u201cquasi-presumption.\u201d Id. at 6. Thus, it concluded that the Commonwealth\n\nhad not met its burden of presenting evidence of every element of first\n\ndegree murder.\n\n      The Commonwealth assails the trial court\u2019s ruling that it failed to\n\nproduce evidence of Appellee\u2019s specific intent to kill Wilkinson, contending\n\nthat the evidence that Appellee stabbed the victim in the chest creates an\n\ninference that she specifically intended to kill him.     In addition, it asserts\n\nthat Appellee\u2019s specific intent is bolstered by her attempt to conceal her\n\ninvolvement in the homicide, first by cleaning up the crime scene, and then\n\nby   falsely   accusing   a   third-party   of   committing   the   crime.   The\n\nCommonwealth reasons that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the mutuality of the\n\naltercation does not preclude the possibility that Appellee intended to\n\nmurder Wilkinson.     The Commonwealth concludes that, when considering\n\nthis evidence together, it offered sufficient proof to establish a prima facie\n\ncase that Appellee stabbed Wilkinson with the intent to kill him. We agree.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fJ-S81003-16\n\n\n\n      At the first preliminary hearing, the Commonwealth offered the\n\ntestimony of Appellee\u2019s brother, J.F., who recounted the events leading up to\n\nWilkinson\u2019s death.    J.F. intimated that, during a heated exchange with the\n\nvictim, Appellee directed him to leave the house.        Preliminary Hearing,\n\n9/9/15, at 14. When he reentered the house, his sister did not call 9-1-1,\n\nbut rather, instructed him to help clear the broken glass scattered\n\nthroughout the house.      Id. at 15; 17.     Moreover, the alleged murder\n\nweapon, which had been lying on the floor near Wilkinson, disappeared\n\nbefore police arrived. Id. at 18-19. J.F. stated that he did not move the\n\nknife, but that it had been moved. Id. at 19.\n\n      The Commonwealth also entered a stipulation as to Wilkinson\u2019s cause\n\nof death.   It produced a medical examiner\u2019s report indicating that he died\n\nfrom a single stab to the lower anterior chest wall, which penetrated his left\n\nlung and lacerated the left main pulmonary artery. Id. at 31-32. Finally,\n\nthe Commonwealth presented the testimony of Detective Burke who was\n\nresponsible for the homicide investigation. Detective Burke indicated that,\n\nupon arriving at the scene of the murder, Appellee stated that Wilkinson had\n\nreturned home with the wound, and that the wound was inflicted by a third\n\nparty. Id. at 33-34. That person was identified, but further investigation\n\nproved that the third party did not stab the victim. Id. at 34.\n\n      A second hearing was held after the Commonwealth refiled the\n\ncriminal complaint.     At this hearing, the Commonwealth again offered\n\n                                     -6-\n\fJ-S81003-16\n\n\n\ntestimony by Detective Burke. Detective Burke relayed further information\n\nobtained during his ongoing investigation from Wilkinson\u2019s brother, C.W.\n\nC.W. had provided the detective with information regarding an earlier\n\nincident in the summer of 2014 between Appellee and Wilkinson wherein\n\nAppellee had purportedly attacked Wilkinson with a razor blade. Preliminary\n\nHearing, 11/16/15, at 7-8.        C.W. then supplied the detective with\n\nphotographs of Wilkinson\u2019s alleged injuries.\n\n      Upon our review of the certified record, the trial court did not give\n\neffect to the reasonable inferences available to support intent.    The court\n\ngrounded its conclusion on its belief that a single stab wound to a vital part\n\nof the body inflicted during an argument is a mere \u201cquasi-presumption,\u201d\n\nwhich it found could not alone support a finding that Appellee acted with the\n\nrequisite intent to kill when she stabbed Wilkinson. Although it is not clear\n\nfrom the trial court\u2019s opinion what a \u201cquasi-presumption\u201d is, we find that the\n\nevidence, when considered as a whole, is sufficient to establish a prima facie\n\ncase of first degree murder.\n\n      As noted above, the trial court determined that Appellee\u2019s behavior\n\nbefore and after Wilkinson\u2019s slaying was probative of malice, but not intent.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, 5/14/15, at 5-6. Indeed, it stated that, without more\n\nevidence, a finding of specific intent would be based on \u201cspeculation.\u201d Id. at\n\n5. We agree with the court that Appellee\u2019s behavior is proof of legal malice,\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fJ-S81003-16\n\n\n\nbut disagree that the additional evidence does not support the reasonable\n\ninference that Appellee had the specific intent to kill Wilkinson.\n\n      Instantly, we can reasonably infer from the circumstances outlined\n\nabove that Appellee\u2019s conduct on the day in question evidences that Appellee\n\ndeliberately killed Wilkinson.    Despite being engrossed in an animated\n\nexchange, Appellee ordered her brother to exit the house.             Shortly\n\nthereafter, she called him in to help clean up the evidence of her battle with\n\nWilkinson.    In the interim, Appellee attacked and killed the victim by\n\nstabbing him in a vital portion of his body. A reasonable person could find\n\nthat Appellee had formulated a plan to kill Wilkinson, but did not want her\n\nbrother and son present for the encounter.           Following the attack on\n\nWilkinson, Appellee did not call the paramedics, but rather, evinced a\n\ndetermination to avoid accountability. Not only did she hide the supposed\n\nmurder weapon before police appeared at her house, when they did arrive,\n\nshe deceived the officers as to the cause of Wilkinson\u2019s death.\n\n      Although there is no indication that Appellee formed her intent to kill\n\nWilkinson prior to their argument on the day in question, the period of\n\npremeditation necessary to form the specific intent to kill may be very brief\n\nand can be formulated in a fraction of a second.           Commonwealth v.\n\nHitcho, 123 A.3d 731, 746 (Pa. 2015). When we view this evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the Commonwealth, and in light of the presumption\n\nthat the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body raises the factual\n\n                                      -8-\n\fJ-S81003-16\n\n\n\npresumption of a specific intent to kill, we can reasonably infer that Appellee\n\npossessed the conscious purpose to slay Wilkinson when she stabbed him in\n\nthe chest, and then sought to cover up her crime. Landis, supra. These\n\nactions not only corroborate a consciousness of guilt, but also substantiate\n\nthe inference that Appellee formulated a plan to murder Wilkinson, albeit\n\nduring a heated dispute, and then carried out that plan in order to escape\n\nprosecution for his death.\n\n      The   evidence   proffered   by   the   Commonwealth      supports   the\n\npresumption that Appellee acted with specific intent to kill when she used a\n\ndeadly weapon on a vital part of his body.        Thus, for the purposes of\n\nestablishing a prima facie case, we find that the Commonwealth bore its\n\nburden of supplying probable cause to believe the defendant committed first\n\ndegree murder such that, if that evidence were proffered at trial, the court\n\nwould be warranted in presenting the case to the finder-of-fact.\n\n      Order reversed. Case remanded. Jurisdiction relinquished.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
