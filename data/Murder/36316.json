            "opinion_text": "\nOPINION OF THE COURT BY\nACOBA, J.\nWhile the Defendant Minor (hereinafter Defendant) was changing a tire on his truck, he was arrested by the police for a curfew violation. The police subsequently seized a wooden implement from his truck and charged *405Defendant with carrying a \u201cbilly\u201d in a vehicle, in violation of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 134-51 (Supp. 1991).1 Defendant appealed from the family court\u2019s February 10, 1992 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order denying Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the seizure of the implement and Defendant\u2019s motion to reconsider which had attacked the applicability of HRS \u00a7 134-51 on various grounds, and from the guilty finding in the February 10, 1992 Decree Re: Law Violation Petition. The suppression portion of the Order need not be determined on appeal under our disposition of the case.\nThat part of HRS \u00a7 134-51 applicable to this case states, \u201cAny person not authorized by law, who carries ... within any vehicle used ... by the person ... any ... billy ... or other deadly or dangerous weapon, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d The court concluded as a matter of law, that the implement \u201cfalls within the definition of... \u2018billy\u2019 as that term is used in HRS Section 134-51.\u201d The court\u2019s conclusions of law are freely reviewable on appeal. State v. Ferraro, 8 Haw. App. 284, 290, 800 P.2d 623, 628 (1990).\nI.\nReceived in evidence as State\u2019s Exhibit 1, the purported \u201cbilly\u201d is a wooden implement sixteen and one-fourth inches in length, cylindrically shaped, with a knobbed handle at its grip end. The diameter of the handle base is two and seven-sixteenths inches. The head end is flat at the top, measuring two inches in diameter. *406The circumference of the implement measures seven and seven-eighths inches at its widest point, and five and one-fourth inches at its narrowest point. The trial court found it was \u201csimilar to the shape of a baseball bat.\u201d\nThe purpose of the implement is to stun or kill fish. The parties stipulated that the implement was made by Defendant\u2019s friend in the school wood shop for Defendant. The parties also stipulated that the shop teacher \u201cin the past permitted students to make clubs of the kind that\u2019s [sic] involved in this case for purposes of killing fish.\u201d Defendant\u2019s undisputed testimony is that he \u201cuse[d] it to knock out the fish instead of... a gun____\u201d The arresting officer himself testified that the implement resembled equipment used to kill fish. 2\nAlso received in evidence was Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 3, an \u201caluminum fishing club.\u201d The implement is seventeen and three-fourths inches in length, cylindrically shaped, with a knobbed handle at its grip end. The diameter of the handle base is two inches. The rounded head end measures two and one-fourth inches in diameter. The circumference of the implement measures seven and one-fourth *407inches at its widest point and three and one-fourth inches at its narrowest point. It also resembles a small baseball bat and is heavier than the wooden implement.3 The parties stipulated that the metal implement was an \u201caluminum fish club... made available for sale... [at two] [flishing [s]upply\u201d stores and purchased from one of them.\nThe aluminum fishing club closely resembles the wooden implement found in Defendant\u2019s truck. Based on the evidence, then, the court properly found that \u201cclubs such as State\u2019s Exhibit 1 [the wooden club] are used by fishermen for the purpose of killing large fish caught on the open sea.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cthe wooden club . . . was designed to be used as a weapon for striking animals on the head.\u201d\nThe term \u201cbilly\u201d is not statutorily defined. However, \u201cbilly\u201d is almost universally defined as a \u201cpoliceman\u2019s club\u201d or \u201ctruncheon.\u201d 4\n*408Even the arresting officer defined a \u201cbilly club\u201d as a \u201cpolice officer\u2019s night stick.\u201d According to the officer a billy club is \u201ca long stick ... [with] a small handle.\u201d5\nAll the evidence at trial established that Defendant\u2019s wooden club was a \u201cfishing club,\u201d not a \u201cpoliceman\u2019s club\u201d or \u201ctruncheon.\u201d Thus, a club-like implement designed for the purpose of striking or killing fish is not a \u201cbilly\u201d as that term is used in HRS \u00a7 134-51. Rather, the term \u201cbilly\u201d as used in HRS \u00a7 134-51 refers to a \u201cpoliceman\u2019s club\u201d or \u201ctruncheon.\u201d\nn.\nThe family court had concluded that the fishing club \u201ccould be used as a deadly weapon against either large fish or humans.\u201d But HRS \u00a7 134-51 does not reach so far. \u201cThe statute is founded upon public policy having for its principal object the preservation of human life.....\u201d State v. Ogata, 58 Haw. 514, 520, 572 P.2d 1222, 1226 (1977). And in construing the statute the Hawai\u2018i Supreme Court has said, \u201cthe statute . . . bring[s] within its ambit instruments closely associated with criminal activity whose sole design and purpose is to inflict bodily injury or death upon another human being\u201d State v. Rackle, 55 *409Haw. 531, 537, 523 P.2d 299, 303 (1974) (emphasis added). Thus, HRS \u00a7 134-51 extends only to weapons deadly or dangerous to people.\nThe possibility that a fishing club \u201ccould be used\u201d as a weapon against \u201chumans\u201d does not bring it within the statutory proscription. \u201cThe fact that an object originally designed for normal or lawful use can be perverted to a use dangerous to oiie attacked does not convert it into a \u2018deadly or dangerous weapon\u2019 within the meaning of [the] statute.\u201d State v. Giltner, 56 Haw. 374, 376, 537 P.2d 14, 16 (1975). In refining its interpretation of HRS \u00a7 134-51, the Hawai'i Supreme Court has distinguished those weapons which \u201c\u2018can be used offensively... but also have recognized uses of a socially acceptable nature\u2019\u201d from those weapons which are offensive in themselves. State v. Muliufi, 64 Haw. 485, 488, 643 P.2d 546, 548 (1982) (quoting Commonwealth v. Adams, 245 Pa. Super. 431, 436, 369 A.2d 479, 482 (1976))(emphasis in original) (nunchaku sticks not considered dangerous weapons). See also, State v. Giltner, 56 Haw. 374, 537 P.2d 14 (1975) (diver\u2019s knife not considered \u201cdagger\u201d). The \u201cfishing club\u201d here may be so distinguished. Thus, \u201cif the health, safety, and welfare of the public\u201d require the inclusion of fishing clubs under HRS \u00a7 134-51, the \u201cmeans of providing such [inclusion] lies solely within the province of the legislature.\u201d State v. Rodrigues, 56 Haw. 642, 643 n.2, 547 P.2d 587, 588 n.2 (1976).\nHI.\nAccordingly, with respect to its determination of a violation of HRS \u00a7 134-51 and a finding of guilt therefor, the family court\u2019s Order filed on February 10, 1992, and *410Decree Re: Law Violation Petition(s) filed on February 10, 1992 are reversed.\nTodd W. Eddins and Theodore Y. H. Chinn (Toby M. Tonaki, Law Student Intern with them on the brief), Deputy Public Defenders, on the brief for defendant-appellant.\nBarbara T Takase (J. William Vroom and Kevin S. Hashizaki, Law Student Interns with her on the brief), Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, County of Hawaii, on the brief for plaintiff-appellee.\n\n Defendant was also charged with curfew violation, harassment, and property damage in the third degree. The property damage charge was dismissed with prejudice. The family court found Defendant not guilty of curfew violation and harassment.\n\n\n The officer testified as follows:\nQ. Have you \u2014 do you have any familiarity with people that go fishing out \u2014 out in the ocean?\nA. Yes, I do.\nQ. Uh, is a club one of the pieces of \u2014 of equipment that a fisherman frequently has as part of his equipment?\nA. Uh, yes\nQ. And the club is used to kill the fish?\nA. That is correct.\nQ. Have you seen clubs similar in size and shape as to State\u2019s 1, uh, as part of the paraphernalia that a fisherman has?\nA. Um, yeah. I would \u2014 I would say I did.\n\n\n Both State\u2019s Exhibit 1 and Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 3 are part of the record on appeal and were available for inspection by the appellate court.\n\n\n BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 213 (4th ed. 1968) states that a \u201cbilly\u201d is a \u201csmall bludgeon that may be carried in the pocket; a club; especially, a policeman\u2019s club.\u201d Likewise, the Second College Edition of THE AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY 179 .(2d ed. 1982) deems \u201cbilly club\u201d to mean \u201ca short wooden club, esp. a policeman\u2019s club.\u201d THE CONCISE OXFORD DICTIONARY OF CURRENT ENGLISH 89,1151 (7th ed. 1982) explains that a \u201cbilly\u201d is a \u201cpoliceman\u2019s truncheon.\u201d It defines \u201ctruncheon\u201d as \u201ca short club or cudgel e.g. that carried by policeman.\u201d Similarly, the SCRIBNER-BANTAM ENGLISH DICTIONARY 93,977 (1st ed. 1977) describes \u201cbilly\u201d as a \u201ctruncheon\u201d which is a \u201cpoliceman\u2019s club.\u201d BALLENTINE\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 183 (3d ed. 1969) does not differ from these sources, stating that a \u201cbilly\u201d is \u201ca club carried by a policeman.\u201d THE RANDOM HOUSE COLLEGE DICTIONARY 134, 324 (rev. ed. 1980) also finds that a \u201cbilly\u201d is a \u201cpoliceman\u2019s club or baton.\u201d\n\n\n The officer testified as follows:\nQ. Officer Thomas, uh, how do you define a \u201cbilly club\u201d?\nA. Just by the shape and the, uh, by looks, I suppose.\nQ. When you say \u201cshape,\u201d what do you mean by \u201cshape\u201d?\nA.. Well, it looks \u2014 it\u2019s a small stick, uh, with a handle.\nUh, we have a billy club, and it\u2019s a long stick. It\u2019s got a small handle, and it\u2019s just the shape of a billy club.\nQ. The \u2014 the stick, when you say, \u201cWe have a stick,\u201d are you referring to the police officer\u2019s night stick?\nA. My \u2014 my night stick. That is correct.\n\n",
