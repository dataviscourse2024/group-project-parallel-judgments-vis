Appellant filed several motions\n\nand a pretrial writ of habeas corpus, which the State answered in a consolidated\n\nresponse filed on August 26, 2014. After the trial court denied Appellant\u2019s\n\napplication, he filed a notice of appeal in this Court, with his brief initially being\n\ndue on January 12, 2015. After Appellant\u2019s motion for extension was granted,\n\nAppellant submitted his brief on January 26, 2015. The State\u2019s brief is currently\n\ndue on February 17, 2015.\n\n                                          1\n\f                                         II.\n\n      Ms. Chari Kelly \u2013 the Assistant District Attorney who is prosecuting this\n\ncase at trial \u2013 is handling the appeal for the State.

Ms. Kelly is currently preparing to try a case\n\nbeginning on February 17th in Cause Number CR2011-399, involving charges of\n\nAttempted Murder, Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon and Tampering.\n\nMs. Kelly has not yet had an opportunity to begin working on the appeal in the\n\ninstant case, and in light of the foregoing, the State respectfully requests that the\n\nCourt grant her a 20-day extension to file the Appellee\u2019s Brief. This is the first\n\nextension sought by Appellee.\n\n\n\n                                        III.\n\n      WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the State\u2019s counsel\n\nrespectfully requests an extension of 20 days, until March 9, 2015, so that an\n\nadequate response may be made to Appellant\u2019s brief.
