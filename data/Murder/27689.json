On appeal, the defendant argues that (1) the trial\n      court erred in responding to a jury question regarding the definition of possession by giving a\n      constructive possession instruction and (2) he is entitled to 80 additional days of presentence\n      credit. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County\n      and remand the case for further proceedings regarding the issue of presentence custody credit.\n\n\u00b62                                           BACKGROUND\n\u00b63         On June 2, 2015, there was a shooting at 1006 North Monticello Avenue, near Augusta\n      Boulevard in Chicago. A car chase followed, during which the defendant threw a gun from his\n      car. The State charged the defendant with multiple counts of aggravated discharge of a firearm,\n      unlawful use or possession of a weapon by a felon, and aggravated unlawful use of a weapon.\n\u00b64         A jury trial commenced on August 29, 2016. Darreyl Williams, a convicted felon many\n      times over, testified that on June 2, 2015, he lived on the second floor of 1006 North Monticello\n      Avenue. Latoya Johnson also lived there with her three children. On the morning of June 2,\n      Williams went downstairs and opened the front door facing the street. Through the \u201ccrack\u201d in\n      the door, he saw a gold Pontiac Bonneville driving by at approximately 20 miles per hour. He\n      could not tell how many people were in the car, but he recognized the driver as a man he knew\n      as \u201cKelly\u201d and identified him in open court as the defendant. A single gunshot was fired from\n      the driver\u2019s side, and Williams immediately ran upstairs to tell Johnson. Johnson called the\n      police, who arrived in 10 to 15 minutes. When the police arrived, Williams did not tell them\n      that \u201cKelly\u201d was the driver, because Williams did not know Kelly\u2019s real name. Later that\n      morning, the police returned to 1006 North Monticello with the defendant in a squad car.\n      Williams identified him as the shooter. He again identified the defendant in an in-person lineup\n      that evening at the police station.\n\u00b65         Johnson, who also had a felony conviction, testified that she lived at 1006 North Monticello\n      Avenue with her children. On the morning of June 2, as she was getting the children ready for\n      school, she heard seven to eight gunshots. She went to the window, where she saw a gold\n      Pontiac Grand Am or Grand Prix driving by. She called the police, who arrived less than 10\n      minutes later. When an officer arrived, Johnson went outside to talk to her. As Johnson was\n      telling the officer what she knew, she saw the same gold car drive down the street and told the\n      officer, who got in her squad car and gave chase. When the police returned later that morning,\n      they showed her the man they had in custody, whom she identified in court as the defendant.\n      Johnson recognized the defendant from the neighborhood, though she denied having any\n      problems with him.\n\n\n                                                  -2-\n\f\u00b66         Officer Joanne Cardinale, a Chicago police officer for 21 years, was the officer on patrol\n       who arrived at 1006 North Monticello Avenue responding to the report of shots fired. As she\n       spoke to Johnson, Johnson pointed at a tan Bonneville on Monticello Avenue immediately\n       before Augusta Boulevard, approximately four houses away from where the officer had parked\n       her marked squad car. Officer Cardinale immediately pursued the Bonneville in her squad car\n       with her emergency equipment activated. The Bonneville, rather than pull over, increased\n       speed and led the officer on a chase. At one point during the chase, the officer observed a \u201cdark\n       object\u201d fly out of the vehicle. The officer remained in pursuit of the car until it finally stopped\n       at 818 North Drake Avenue, where another police car blocked its way. At no point during the\n       chase did the officer lose sight of the Bonneville. Officer Cardinale placed the driver, whom\n       she identified in court as the defendant, in custody.\n\u00b67         Officer Cardinale observed two .40-caliber live rounds on the floorboard of the driver\u2019s\n       side of the car and a spent .40-caliber shell casing on the outside windshield well on the driver\u2019s\n       side. Officer Cardinale then walked with another police officer who had arrived on the scene\n       back to Iowa Street, where she had seen the dark object thrown from the window. At 3439\n       West Iowa Street, the officers found a broken magazine and a Glock .40-caliber handgun.\n\u00b68         Chicago police officer Erick von Kondrat, in the meantime, went to 1006 North Monticello\n       Avenue to block off the scene and recover evidence. He saw a smashed bullet fragment on the\n       street in front of 1008 North Monticello Avenue that, upon testing, was revealed to be a .25-\n       caliber bullet that could not have been fired from the .40-caliber gun recovered on Iowa Street.\n       The spent bullet on the windshield of the defendant\u2019s car, however, was determined to be fired\n       from the gun that was recovered.\n\u00b69         The police also recovered the shirt the defendant was wearing that day, which, upon testing,\n       was revealed to have gunshot residue on the cuffs.\n\u00b6 10       The parties stipulated to the defendant\u2019s prior felony, and the State rested. The defendant\n       then moved for a directed verdict as to the counts of aggravated discharge of a firearm, which\n       was denied. The defendant rested without testifying and without putting on any evidence.\n\u00b6 11       During closing argument, the State limited its argument in support of the charge of\n       unlawful use or possession of a firearm by a felon to the allegation that the defendant\n       knowingly possessed a firearm. The defendant in closing focused on the charges of aggravated\n       discharge of a firearm and relied on the theory that there was a second individual in the car\n       who fired a .25-caliber gun. The defendant claims that individual could have exited the car in\n       the 10 minutes before the defendant circled back to Monticello Avenue where he was seen,\n       alone in the car, by the police. Defense counsel explicitly stated that the defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t\n       deny\u201d that he threw the .40-caliber gun out of the car window. He argued, \u201c[I]f throwing some\n       gun that was left in his car out the window while being pursued by law enforcement makes\n       him guilty of unlawful possession of a weapon with a prior felony conviction, then you can\n       find him guilty of that.\u201d\n\u00b6 12       At some point during the deliberations, the jury sent out a note reading, \u201cIn regard to the\n       charge of unlawful use and possession of [sic] weapon by a felon. What defines \u2018possession\u2019?\u201d\n\u00b6 13       The court conferred with the parties in open court, at which the defendant was also present.\n       The State suggested giving paragraph one of Illinois Pattern Jury Instruction 4.16 (Illinois\n       Pattern Jury Instructions, Criminal, No. 4.16(1) (4th ed. 2000) (hereinafter IPI Criminal 4th)),\n       defining actual and constructive possession. The defendant objected on the basis that neither\n       party addressed \u201cpossession\u201d in their closing arguments and giving the jury the instruction now\n\n                                                    -3-\n\f       would \u201cextend[ ] the basis of what\u2019s in dispute.\u201d Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the court sent\n       a response attaching the definition of actual and constructive possession: \u201cPossession may be\n       actual or constructive. A person has actual possession when he has immediate and exclusive\n       control over a thing. A person has constructive possession when he lacks actual possession of\n       a thing but he has both the power and the intention to exercise control over a thing.\u201d\n\u00b6 14       Later that evening, the jury returned a verdict acquitting the defendant of both counts of\n       aggravated discharge of a firearm but finding him guilty of unlawful use or possession of a\n       weapon by a felon.\n\u00b6 15       The defendant did not file a posttrial motion. The trial court ultimately sentenced the\n       defendant to the maximum 14 years of imprisonment based largely on the fact that the\n       defendant\u2019s qualifying felony was murder. The defendant appealed.\n\n\u00b6 16                                             ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 17       We note that we have jurisdiction to review this matter, as we allowed the defendant\u2019s late\n       notice of appeal following the imposition of sentence. Ill. S. Ct. R. 301 (eff. Feb. 1, 1994); R.\n       303 (eff. July 1, 2017).\n\u00b6 18       The defendant\u2019s primary challenge on appeal is the trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s\n       question regarding the definition of possession. The defendant maintains that it was error to\n       instruct the jury on the definition of possession because the theory of constructive possession\n       was not introduced at trial. He contends that this error deprived him of his constitutional right\n       to make a closing argument.\n\u00b6 19       Initially, the State maintains that the defendant has forfeited this challenge by failing to\n       raise it in a posttrial motion. Ordinarily, in order to preserve an error for review, a defendant\n       must make a contemporaneous objection at trial and raise the issue in a posttrial motion. People\n       v. Sebby, 2017 IL 119445, \u00b6 48. But our supreme court has carved out a narrow exception to\n       this rule where the error is of a constitutional dimension. See People v. Cregan, 2014 IL\n       113600, \u00b6 18. In Cregan, the supreme court, citing People v. Enoch, 122 Ill. 2d 176 (1988),\n       held that a constitutional issue that is properly raised at trial and that can be raised in\n       postconviction proceedings is not subject to forfeiture though it is not raised in a posttrial\n       motion. Cregan, 2014 IL 113600, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20. The court reasoned that this exception serves the\n       interest of judicial economy, given that postconviction review allows a defendant to challenge\n       a constitutional error that was not raised on direct appeal. Id. \u00b6 18. Therefore, \u201c[i]f a defendant\n       were precluded from raising a constitutional issue previously raised at trial on direct appeal,\n       merely because he failed to raise it in a posttrial motion, the defendant could simply allege the\n       issue in a later postconviction petition.\u201d Id. For this reason, judicial economy favors addressing\n       the otherwise forfeited issue on direct appeal rather than requiring a defendant to file a\n       postconviction petition. Id.\n\u00b6 20       Here, the defendant alleges that he was deprived of his constitutional right to make a\n       closing argument. This is an issue that is cognizable under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act\n       (725 ILCS 5/122-1 et seq. (West 2016)) (see Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 857-59\n       (1975) (holding that a defendant\u2019s right to make a closing argument is guaranteed by the United\n       States Constitution)), and so the defendant was not required to raise the issue in a posttrial\n       motion in order to preserve it on appeal. In an effort to avoid this inevitable conclusion, the\n       State mischaracterizes the defendant\u2019s challenge as one to a defective jury instruction, which\n       is decidedly not a constitutional violation. See, e.g., People v. Mendez, 221 Ill. App. 3d 868,\n\n                                                    -4-\n\f       876 (1991). But the defendant has never alleged that the court gave an incorrect instruction; to\n       the contrary, he acknowledged that the definition of possession that the court sent to the jury\n       was correct. His challenge at trial, repeated on appeal, is that the instruction introduced a new\n       theory of guilt that he did not have the opportunity to rebut in closing argument. This is an\n       allegation of a constitutional violation that is not forfeited for the defendant\u2019s failure to raise it\n       in a posttrial motion.\n\u00b6 21        Turning to the merits, we observe that, while the jury should be instructed prior to closing\n       arguments, the jury is generally entitled to further instructions if it has a question during\n       deliberations. People v. Leach, 2011 IL App (1st) 090339, \u00b6 15 (citing People v. Childs, 159\n       Ill. 2d 217, 228 (1994)). But a trial court may, in its discretion, decline to answer a jury\u2019s\n       question where the previous instructions \u201care readily understandable and sufficiently explain\n       the relevant law\u201d or \u201cwhere further instructions would serve no useful purpose or would\n       potentially mislead the jury.\u201d People v. Millsap, 189 Ill. 2d 155, 161 (2000). A trial court must\n       also refrain from introducing new theories or charges to the jury after deliberations have\n       commenced. Id.\n\u00b6 22        The defendant argues that instructing the jury on constructive possession when the parties\n       had limited their argument to actual possession introduced a new theory that he did not have\n       the opportunity to address and so the court erred in answering the jury\u2019s question. This court\n       considered an identical issue in People v. Alexander, 2019 IL App (3d) 160709. There, the\n       defendant was charged with unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon based on the allegation\n       that he ran from a traffic stop with a gun in his hand. Id. \u00b6 3. At trial, the police testified that\n       they effectuated a traffic stop, after which multiple people ran from the vehicle. Id. \u00b6 4. There\n       was testimony that one officer saw the defendant with a gun, while another officer saw both\n       the defendant and another male passenger with a gun. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. On the other hand, the\n       defendant\u2019s sister, who was driving the car, testified that only the other male passenger had a\n       gun. Id. \u00b6 9. The police recovered a single gun along the path the defendant took. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7.\n       During deliberations, the jury asked for the definition of possession. Id. \u00b6 11. Over the\n       defendant\u2019s objection, the court gave the jury IPI Criminal 4th No. 4.16, defining actual and\n       constructive possession. Alexander, 2019 IL App (3d) 160709, \u00b6 11.\n\u00b6 23        On appeal, the defendant argued that the court\u2019s response was error because it introduced\n       a new theory\u2014constructive possession\u2014into the case, and we agreed. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18. We\n       explained that, while actual possession requires \u201csome form of dominion over the object,\u201d\n       constructive possession requires evidence of the defendant\u2019s \u201cintent and capability to maintain\n       control and dominion over the object.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. \u00b6 18. Because the State had only\n       argued that the defendant was in actual possession of the gun, we concluded that constructive\n       possession was a new theory and agreed that it was error to instruct the jury on constructive\n       possession in response to its question. Id.; see also Millsap, 189 Ill. 2d at 164-65 (holding that\n       giving jury accountability instruction in response to question introduced new theory into the\n       case where the State argued only that defendant was responsible as a principal).\n\u00b6 24        The same holds true here. By instructing the jury on constructive possession, the court\n       introduced a new theory to the jury. Constructive possession and actual possession, as even the\n       State concedes, have different elements. Because the defendant did not have the opportunity\n       to address the theory of constructive possession, the court abused its discretion in responding\n       to the jury\u2019s question with that instruction.\n\n\n                                                     -5-\n\f\u00b6 25        Having found that the court\u2019s instruction in response to the jury\u2019s question deprived the\n       defendant of his right to address it in closing argument, we next consider whether this error\n       was harmless. See People v. Shaw, 186 Ill. 2d 301, 344 (1998) (most constitutional errors are\n       subject to harmless error analysis); see also Millsap, 189 Ill. 2d at 166 (considering (and\n       rejecting) the State\u2019s theory that error in responding to the jury\u2019s question was harmless). A\n       constitutional error is harmless where it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did\n       not contribute to the verdict. People v. Sandifer, 2017 IL App (1st) 142740, \u00b6 73. There are\n       three approaches we may take to determining whether an error is harmless: (1) focus on the\n       error to determine whether it contributed to the conviction, (2) consider whether the other\n       evidence overwhelmingly supports the conviction, and (3) determine if the improperly\n       admitted evidence is cumulative. Id.\n\u00b6 26        Here, the error could not have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction where there was\n       no evidence that the defendant lacked actual possession over the gun. The unrebutted\n       testimony from Officer Cardinale revealed that the defendant threw a black object, later\n       identified as a .40-caliber Glock handgun, from a car as he attempted to evade capture by the\n       police. Indeed, in closing argument, defense counsel himself conceded this fact multiple times,\n       stating that the defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t deny that he tossed that .40 caliber gun out the window of his\n       Bonneville that day\u201d and acknowledging that, \u201cif throwing some gun that was left in his car\n       out the window while being pursued by law enforcement makes him guilty of unlawful\n       possession of a weapon with a prior felony conviction, then you can find him guilty of that.\u201d\n       Handling a gun to throw it out a window unquestionably amounts to actual possession, or\n       \u201cexercising dominion\u201d over an object. While the defendant may also have had constructive\n       possession of the gun while it was in his car but was not in his immediate or exclusive control,\n       this could not have been the basis for the defendant\u2019s conviction where the defendant\n       essentially conceded actual possession. Therefore, the error in instructing the jury was\n       harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\u00b6 27        Finally, the defendant argues that he is entitled to 80 additional days of presentence custody\n       credit. The State correctly notes that pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 472 (eff. May\n       17, 2019), the circuit court retains jurisdiction to correct, inter alia, errors in the calculation of\n       presentence custody credit, at any time following judgment, including during the pendency of\n       appeal. Before a defendant may challenge such a calculation on appeal, he must first file a\n       motion in the trial court to allow the court an opportunity to correct the error. People v.\n       Whittenberg, 2019 IL App (1st) 163267, \u00b6 4. Where, as here, there is no indication that the\n       defendant raised this claim in the trial court, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. See People v.\n       Scott, 2019 IL App (1st) 163022, \u00b6 26. Therefore, pursuant to Rule 472(e), we remand this\n       matter to the trial court to allow the defendant the opportunity to move to correct the mittimus.\n       Ill. S. Ct. R. 472(e) (eff. May 17, 2019).\n\n\u00b6 28                                         CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 29      The defendant\u2019s conviction for unlawful use of a weapon by a felon is affirmed, and we\n       remand this case to the circuit court of Cook County pursuant to Rule 472(e) for the court to\n       consider the defendant\u2019s challenge to his presentence custody credit.\n\n\u00b6 30       Affirmed and remanded.\n\n\n                                                     -6-\n\f",
