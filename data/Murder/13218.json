Gordon Widenhouse, Jr.,\n     for Defendant.\n\n\n     STEPHENS, Judge.\n\n\n                  Factual and Procedural Background\n\n     This case arises from the death of James Allen Shore, Jr.\n\n(\u201cthe    decedent\u201d),    who   was   shot   by   Defendant    Charles    Anthony\n\nMcGrady in a field near both individuals\u2019 homes. Defendant and\n\nthe decedent are first cousins and were involved in a number of\n\ndisputes    during     the    decedent\u2019s   life.    On   6   February    2012,\n\nDefendant was charged with first-degree murder. The trial began\n\non Monday, 30 July 2012, and continued through the following\n\f                                     -2-\nWednesday. The evidence presented at trial tended to show the\n\nfollowing:\n\n      At the time of the shooting, the decedent lived on the\n\nwestern side of Wiles Ridge Road with his fianc\u00e9e, Tammy Wood\n\n(\u201cWood\u201d), in Hays, North Carolina. Defendant and his girlfriend,\n\nDarlene Kellum, lived on the eastern side of the road, opposite\n\nthe   decedent.    Defendant\u2019s     son,    Brandon     McGrady     (\u201cBrandon\u201d),\n\nlived approximately 400 feet to the northwest of his father\u2019s\n\nhome. Defendant\u2019s aunt and the decedent\u2019s mother, Betty Shore,\n\nlived on the western side of the road. The area encompassing\n\nthese homes is approximately nine acres.\n\n      In   the   early   morning   hours     of   20    December    2011,   the\n\ndecedent took his dog for a walk outside his house. Afterward,\n\nhe returned home upset and told Wood that Defendant had been\n\nshining a light on him. Later that morning, around 10:00 a.m.,\n\nthe decedent got up, walked his dog to his mother\u2019s house, and\n\ntold her the same thing. He was wearing a knife on his waist,\n\nattached by a rope, and carrying a walking stick. After talking\n\nwith his mother, the decedent walked back toward his house with\n\nhis dog. On the way, he came in contact with Defendant and\n\nDefendant\u2019s son, Brandon, who were riding together in a golf\n\ncart to get the mail. Defendant was seated in the driver\u2019s seat,\n\f                                              -3-\nand Brandon was           seated in the passenger seat. Defendant was\n\ncarrying    a    loaded,     9-millimeter           Beretta     pistol    in   his   right\n\npocket and an audio cassette player in his left hand. Brandon\n\nhad a loaded AR-15 semi-automatic rifle between his legs.\n\n      While Defendant and Brandon were checking the mail, they\n\nsaw   the   decedent         walking      toward          the   golf      cart.   Shortly\n\nthereafter,          Defendant     and   the    decedent        started    arguing,    and\n\nDefendant began recording with his cassette player. Speaking to\n\nthe decedent, Defendant asked,                  \u201cDo you have anything to add\n\nabout murdering my family last night?\u201d The decedent responded,\n\n\u201cNo, I plainly told you.\u201d Defendant repeated his question and\n\nthe   decedent        told   him    to   \u201cshut      the    fuck    up.\u201d    More   arguing\n\noccurred, and Defendant told the decedent to \u201cstay away from\n\nus.\u201d The decedent responded, \u201cYou know I\u2019ll whoop your ass and\n\nput you on the ground if you try to stab me in the back; now get\n\nover here and get some.\u201d Defendant responded by saying, \u201cI\u2019ll\n\nput   you       in     the   grave;      in     the    morgue,      in     the    morgue,\n\nmotherfucker.\u201d\n\n      The argument continued, and the decedent put his hands on\n\nthe golf cart, shaking it. Defendant asked Brandon to give him\n\nthe AR-15. As Brandon attempted to hand it to his father, the\n\ndecedent took the AR-15 and stood back, pointing it at Defendant\n\f                                           -4-\nand his son. Brandon got out of the golf cart, but Defendant\n\nremained       seated.      After    exchanging        more    insults     with    the\n\ndecedent, Defendant stepped out of the golf cart, pulled out his\n\npistol, and fired approximately seven shots at the decedent in\n\nrapid succession.1 Afterward, Defendant said to the decedent,\n\n\u201cWhat about now, Bozo? What about now, motherfucker, huh?\u201d He\n\nthen proclaimed that the decedent \u201cattacked                      us, by God\u201d and\n\nreturned to his house with his weapons and son.\n\n       The     decedent     died    shortly      thereafter,      at     12:35    p.m.\n\nAccording to the medical examiner, some of the bullets entered\n\nthe    decedent\u2019s     arm    and    then   reentered     his    torso,    making    it\n\ndifficult to calculate an exact number of shots. Other bullets\n\nentered the decedent\u2019s back. The medical examiner testified that\n\nthere were gunshot wounds in the upper part of the decedent\u2019s\n\nbuttocks, going from left to right. There were also two gunshot\n\nwounds    in    the   decedent\u2019s      torso.     The   lower    wound    was     fatal,\n\nresulting from a \u201cstraight-on shot\u201d into the decedent\u2019s back\n\nthat went through his lung and into his heart.\n\n       Defendant      was   eventually      taken   into      custody    and   charged\n\nwith first-degree murder. At trial, Defendant testified that the\n\ndecedent was pointing the AR-15 at Brandon\u2019s head and he shot\n\n\n1   The shots were fired in 1.82 seconds.\n\f                                      -5-\nthe decedent \u201cout of instinct, to protect my son.\u201d At the close\n\nof all the evidence and after the parties\u2019 arguments, the trial\n\ncourt   instructed      the   jury   on,    inter    alia,       self-defense     and\n\ndefense of a family member. On 8 August 2012, Defendant was\n\nconvicted     of     first-degree     murder        and    sentenced      to     life\n\nimprisonment without parole. He gave notice of appeal that same\n\nday.\n\n                                  Discussion\n\n       Defendant makes two arguments on appeal. First, he contends\n\nthat the     trial   court abused its discretion by                 excluding     the\n\nexpert testimony offered by Defendant regarding the doctrine of\n\n\u201cuse of force,\u201d in violation of his right to present a defense.\n\nSecond,     Defendant    asserts     that    the     trial       court   erred    by\n\npreventing    him    from     introducing    evidence       of    the    decedent\u2019s\n\n\u201cproclivity    toward    violence    based     on    his   reputation      and   his\n\nprevious violent actions.\u201d We find no error.\n\n        I. Expert Witness Testimony on Use of Force\n\n                 It   is   well-established  that   trial\n            courts must decide preliminary questions\n            concerning the qualifications of experts to\n            testify or the admissibility of expert\n            testimony. . . . In this capacity, trial\n            courts   are   afforded   wide  latitude   of\n            discretion when making a determination about\n            the admissibility of expert testimony. Given\n            such latitude, it follows that a trial\n            court\u2019s ruling on the qualifications of an\n\f                               -6-\n         expert or the admissibility of an expert\u2019s\n         opinion will not be reversed on appeal\n         absent a showing of abuse of discretion.\n\nHowerton v. Arai Helmet, Ltd., 358 N.C. 440, 458, 597 S.E.2d\n\n674, 686 (2004) (citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cAbuse\n\nof discretion results where the court\u2019s ruling is manifestly\n\nunsupported by reason or is so arbitrary that it could not have\n\nbeen the result of a reasoned decision.\u201d State v. Hennis, 323\n\nN.C. 279, 285, 372 S.E.2d 523, 527 (1988).\n\n         A. Voir Dire\n\n    On 30 July 2012, the State filed a motion in limine to\n\nexclude the testimony of Dave F. Cloutier. A voir dire hearing\n\non that motion was held at trial. During the hearing, Cloutier\n\ntestified on the \u201cscience\u201d of \u201cuse of force\u201d as applied to the\n\nfacts of this case. Specifically, he discussed the concepts of\n\n(1) \u201creaction time,\u201d (2) an individual\u2019s response to perceived\n\nlethal and nonlethal force, (3) \u201cforce variables,\u201d (4) \u201cpre-\n\nattack cues,\u201d and (5) \u201cperceptual narrowing.\u201d Cloutier described\n\n\u201creaction time\u201d as \u201cthe time it takes [to react] once the brain\n\nhas perceived a threat \u2014 [the perception of such a threat is]\n\f                                         -7-\nusually visual, by the eyes, although it could be with other\n\nsenses.\u201d2 He defined \u201cforce variables\u201d as\n\n             circumstances and events that would . . .\n             influence someone\u2019s decision of a use of\n             force that was necessary to overcome a\n             perceived threat. That could include the\n             actual weapons involved, the number of\n             weapons, the number of individuals, the\n             environment, the time of day, the lighting,\n             any number of variables.\n\n\u201cPre-attack cues\u201d are \u201cthose exhibitions by an individual which\n\nan    individual      would   actually     perceive    or    view    and     make   the\n\nassumption that an attack was likely.\u201d For example, \u201ca glaring\n\nlook in [an individual\u2019s] face, a clinched jaw, . . . clinched\n\nfist,\u201d    or       bringing   a   weapon    up   as    if    to     fire.    Finally,\n\n\u201cperceptual narrowing\u201d is \u201cthe reason people have a tendency to\n\nnot   have     a   total   recall   of   what    actually     may    have    happened\n\n[during      an    altercation].\u201d    According        to    Cloutier,       perceptual\n\nnarrowing could result in difficulty remembering, for example,\n\n\u201cthe number of shots that may have been fired in an actual\n\nlethal encounter.\u201d\n\n\n\n2 He elaborated: \u201c[B]y the time the individual perceives a\nthreat, recognize[s] it as a threat, and makes the decision to\nbegin to use some technique, tactic, or method to either flee or\nfight[, i]t usually takes the average person about three-\nquarters of a second to begin to react to some stimulus that\nthey perceive as a threat. So we utilize that reaction time in\nanalyzing these various cases.\u201d\n\f                                            -8-\n      Regarding          his    experience    and     training      in   the    field,\n\nCloutier testified that he had worked in \u201cuse of force\u201d since\n\nJanuary of 1991. At the time of the trial, he was a \u201cprivate\n\ncitizen\u201d who provided \u201cexpert witness services in regards to use\n\nof force . . . .\u201d Before that, he worked for the North Carolina\n\nDepartment of Justice as an instructor \u201cfor subject control and\n\narrest      techniques         for   law   enforcement     training      . . . \u201d     and\n\nserved in the military. He holds a bachelor of science degree in\n\ncriminal justice from North Carolina Wesleyan College and is a\n\ngraduate of the FBI National Academy. He has held certifications\n\nin   (1)    firearms      instruction,       (2)   subject   control      and   arrest\n\ntechniques,        (3)    specialized      subject   control,    and     (4)    unarmed\n\nself-defense. At the time of trial, however, he was certified\n\nonly as an \u201cFBI defensive tactics instructor . . . .\u201d Before the\n\ntrial, Cloutier had been admitted as an expert approximately\n\ntwenty-two times in state and federal court. Cloutier does not\n\nhave a Ph.D or any medical degree.\n\n      Applying the use of force doctrine to the facts in this\n\ncase,      Cloutier      offered     the   following      observations:        (1)   The\n\ndecedent exhibited a number of pre-attack cues that might have\n\nindicated      a    forthcoming       assault.      (2)   \u201c[A]ge,     gender,    size,\n\nenvironment, use of a weapon, type of weapon, number of weapons,\n\f                                     -9-\nand . . . number of       subjects\u201d were      \u201cuse of force variables\u201d\n\npresent in this case and, along with the pre-attack cues, these\n\nfactors were \u201cconsistent with exhibition by an individual that\n\nan attack was likely imminent.\u201d (3) The rounds fired at the\n\ndecedent were fired in \u201csomewhere around 1.8 seconds . . . [,\n\nmeaning] it\u2019s very possible and likely that during the course of\n\nfiring in that 1.8 seconds that [the decedent] could have, in\n\nfact, [reacted and] turned 90 to 180 degrees, or, in fact, could\n\nhave turned 360 degrees,\u201d accounting for the injuries in his\n\nside and back. In addition, (4) Defendant was possibly affected\n\nby perceptual narrowing.\n\n      When Cloutier was questioned about the scientific basis for\n\nhis   opinions,   he    testified     that   his     knowledge    came    from\n\npublished articles in the field of use of force and the training\n\nhe received \u201cby some of those authors and studies that I have\n\nmyself been involved in . . . .\u201d He explained that the \u201cJustice\n\nAcademy\u201d   uses   \u201ca   number   of   tests   . . .    to   look   at   various\n\nprinciples of use of force . . . .\u201d According to Cloutier, this\n\ninformation is regularly relied on by people in the field. When\n\nasked to explain the reliability of the information described in\n\nhis testimony, Cloutier explained:\n\n           The tests, for example, that I have been a\n           part of performing and been involved in with\n\f                                     -10-\n            the   Justice  Academy   . . .  measure   the\n            physiological results of an individual under\n            stress and their reaction time; once they\n            perceive a threat, how long it takes to\n            react and what type of reaction they have.\n            Those results of those studies that we have\n            performed   at   the   Justice  Academy   are\n            consistent with the studies that have been\n            performed and published on a national basis.\n\nAccording   to   Cloutier,   these    tests       have   \u201cremained    consistent\n\nover time.\u201d When asked to describe the \u201cknown or potential rate\n\nof error,\u201d however, Cloutier admitted that he did not know.3\n\n     At the end of the hearing, the trial court sustained the\n\nState\u2019s   objection   and    excluded       Cloutier\u2019s     testimony     in   its\n\nentirety.   The court    pointed out        that (1) much of Cloutier\u2019s\n\nreport constituted impermissible witness bolstering, (2) certain\n\nof Cloutier\u2019s opinions were based on medical knowledge that he\n\nwas not qualified to discuss, (3) Cloutier\u2019s opinion on use of\n\nforce variables would not be helpful to the jury because most\n\nindividuals are able to recognize pre-attack cues and other use\n\nof force variables, and (4) Cloutier is not competent to testify\n\nabout reaction times. In addition, the court determined that\n\nCloutier\u2019s \u201ctestimony [was] not based on sufficient facts or\n\ndata. . . . [,]    not   the   product       of     reliable   principles     or\n\n\n3  Cloutier later     stated: \u201cI have not done[ a]                   statistical\nanalysis on any       of these studies or read a                     statistical\nanalysis.\u201d\n\f                                           -11-\nmethods. . . . [, and] simply a conclusory approach that [could\n\nnot] reasonably assess for reliability.\u201d The court noted that\n\nCloutier\u2019s      testimony      had    not    been      subject       to    peer   review,\n\nCloutier had no knowledge of a potential rate of error regarding\n\nany of the use of force factors, and Cloutier did not recognize\n\nor apply the variables that could have affected his opinions in\n\nthe    case.

Ed. 2d 508, 519 (1997).\n\n              C. Analysis\n\n      Defendant argues that the trial court erroneously excluded\n\nCloutier\u2019s testimony under Rule 702 and, in doing so, abused its\n\ndiscretion. Specifically, Defendant asserts that \u201cuse of force\n\nis a science,\u201d based on scientific principles and utilized by\n\nother experts. He states that concepts like \u201creaction time\u201d are\n\nbased on \u201creliable\u201d studies, which were cited by Cloutier, and\n\npoints out that Cloutier unearthed a number of \u201cuse of force\n\nvariables     that      came     into    play      in    this   situation. . . .         Most\n\f                                          -16-\nimportant[ly], Cloutier explained that [the decedent] could have\n\nturned 90 to 180 degrees in 1.8 seconds,\u201d the amount of time it\n\ntook Defendant to fire the shots. Defendant argues that this\n\nfact, in particular, could have assisted the jury in determining\n\nthat Defendant used \u201cdefensive force\u201d in the confrontation with\n\nthe   decedent.        Defendant     also     argues     that   expert       testimony\n\n\u201cshould     be       liberally   admitted\u201d       and    that    the    trial        court\n\n\u201cunfairly        interject[ed]       itself      into    the      litigation\u201d         and\n\ndisregarded the liberal admission precept. In conjunction with\n\nthe above argument, Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision        to     exclude     Cloutier\u2019s         testimony       violated       his\n\nconstitutional right to present a defense. We disagree.\n\n                      (1) Rule 702\n\n      In Joiner, the United States Supreme Court reviewed a trial\n\ncourt\u2019s application of the Daubert test. 522 U.S. at 136, 139 L.\n\nEd. 2d at 508. The respondent-employee worked as an electrician\n\nfor the petitioner-employer. Id. at 139, 139 L. Ed. 2d at 514.\n\nBy expert testimony, the employee linked the development of his\n\ncancer     to    his    exposure     to     certain     chemicals     used     by     his\n\nemployer. Id. at 139\u201340, 139 L. Ed. 2d at 514. In providing that\n\ntestimony, the experts relied on a number of specific scientific\n\nstudies. Id. at 143\u201344, 139 L. Ed. 2d at 517. Nonetheless, the\n\f                                        -17-\ntrial court excluded the proffered testimony on grounds that it\n\ndid    not     rise     above     \u201csubjective     belief      or     unsupported\n\nspeculation.\u201d Id. at 140, 139 L. Ed. 2d at 515. On appeal, the\n\ncircuit      court    reversed    the    trial   court,    citing        a   general\n\n\u201cpreference\u201d for the admission of expert                  testimony.5 Id. The\n\nUnited States Supreme Court reversed that decision on writ of\n\ncertiorari and affirmed the trial court\u2019s original decision to\n\nexclude the expert testimony. Id. at 141, 139 L. Ed. 2d at 515.\n\n       In his argument to the Supreme Court, the employee asserted\n\nthat    the     trial    court\u2019s        disagreement   with        the       experts\u2019\n\nconclusions was error           because the experts had relied on the\n\nspecific principles and methodology used in the cited studies,\n\npursuant to the requirements laid down in Daubert. Id. at 146,\n\n139 L. Ed. 2d at 518. The Supreme Court overruled that argument\n\nand stated that, while the focus of a trial court\u2019s analysis\n\nmust be on principles and methodology,\n\n              conclusions and methodology are not entirely\n              distinct from one another. . . .

A court may conclude that there is\n             simply too great an analytical gap between\n             the data and the opinion proffered.\n\nId. at 146, 139 L. Ed. 2d at 519 (emphasis added). Citing the\n\nhighly deferential standard afforded to a trial court\u2019s decision\n\nto exclude or admit expert testimony, the Court concluded that\n\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the\n\nemployee\u2019s      expert     testimony     and     in   determining     that   the\n\nanalytical gap between the data and the opinion in that case was\n\ntoo great. Id.\n\n       In this case, just as in Joiner, the trial court determined\n\nthat    there   was      too    great   an     analytical   gap   between    the\n\nauthorities      cited     by    Cloutier      and    his   offered    opinion.\n\nSpecifically, the court concluded that Cloutier\u2019s testimony was\n\nnot based on sufficient facts or data or the product of reliable\n\nprinciples and methods. The trial court also noted that (1) the\n\ntestimony served as \u201csimply a conclusory approach that cannot\n\nreasonably assess for reliability\u201d and (2) Cloutier had failed\n\nto provide any known rate of error or show that any of the\n\nreferenced studies were the subject of peer review. For those\n\nreasons, the trial court determined that Cloutier\u2019s testimony\n\nwas merely \u201cbased on speculation\u201d and commented that \u201c[Cloutier]\n\n\n905 (9th ed. 2009).\n\f                                          -19-\nis just guessing and overlooking [variables that] could . . .\n\naffect his opinions in this case.\u201d\n\n      Defendant     contests       the     trial      court\u2019s     conclusions         and\n\nasserts    that    it    abused    its     discretion        in   coming   to       those\n\nconclusions,      but does not show            how the court\u2019s decision was\n\narbitrarily or manifestly unreasonable. Rather, he argues for\n\nthe reasonableness of a different conclusion based on the same\n\nevidence.7 This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard.\n\n      The federal courts have traditionally granted \u201ca great deal\n\nof   discretion\u201d    to     the    trial       court   when    determining      whether\n\nexpert testimony is admissible under Daubert. See, e.g., U.S. v.\n\nDorsey, 45 F.3d 809 (4th Cir. 1995); Maryland Cas. Co. v. Therm-\n\nO-Disc, Inc., 137 F.3d 780 (4th Cir. 1998) (\u201cDaubert clearly\n\ncontemplates      the    vesting     of       significant     discretion       in     the\n\ndistrict   court    with    regard       to    the    decision    to   admit    expert\n\nscientific testimony.\u201d). As the State points out in its brief,\n\nCloutier provided little data to support the reliability of his\n\nproposed methodology. Though Cloutier testified that (1) use of\n\n\n\n\n7 We also note that Defendant does not address the trial court\u2019s\ndetermination that the testimony is inadmissible under Rule 403.\n\f                                      -20-\nforce has been \u201ctested,\u201d (2) publications exist in the field,8\n\nand (3) the theory is \u201crelied upon regularly,\u201d he provided no\n\nsubstantive reasons \u2014 no specific scientific knowledge, methods,\n\nor procedures \u2014 to support those assertions. Indeed, unlike the\n\nexperts in Joiner, Cloutier was not even able to cite a single\n\nspecific study, merely referring to the existence of studies and\n\ntheir authors generally. In addition, when the court asked about\n\nthe relevant \u201crate of error,\u201d Cloutier admitted that he knew\n\nnothing about that factor or how it related to his opinions.\n\n    A   review     of   the   trial     transcript    indicates    that,   in\n\nexcluding Cloutier\u2019s testimony, the trial court properly applied\n\nthe standard laid down by the Supreme Court in Daubert. The\n\ncourt determined that Cloutier\u2019s testimony was firmly within the\n\nrealm of common knowledge and would not be helpful to the jury.\n\nThe Court pointed out that Cloutier completely lacked medical\n\ncredentials    and      provided      little   evidence      regarding     the\n\nprinciples    or   methodology     used   to   come   to   his   conclusions.\n\nTherefore, even if we were to assume that the doctrine of \u201cuse\n\n\n\n\n8 Cloutier stated that he had read and even participated in some\nof the studies leading to these publications. Nevertheless, he\nwas completely unable to provide details regarding their\ncontent.\n\f                                    -21-\nof force\u201d constitutes scientific knowledge,9 we see no reason to\n\nconclude that the trial court was manifestly unreasonable in\n\ndetermining   that     Cloutier\u2019s    knowledge   of    that     doctrine     \u2014\n\nincluding the way an individual reacts in a confrontation or the\n\nfact that an individual might turn away when a gun is fired \u2014\n\nwas not helpful to the jury. See generally Braswell v.

In our    view, the\n\ncourt\u2019s decision was well-reasoned, especially given the Daubert\n\nrequirements invoked by amended Rule 702. Therefore, Defendant\u2019s\n\nfirst argument is overruled, and we affirm the trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision to exclude Cloutier\u2019s testimony under Rule 702.\n\n                (2) Right to Present a Defense\n\n    Defendant also contends that the exclusion of Cloutier\u2019s\n\ntestimony under Rule 702 violated his constitutional right to\n\n\n\n9 We do not offer an opinion as to whether it does.

Indeed, only\n\nrarely has the Supreme Court \u201cheld that the right to present a\n\ncomplete   defense      [is]    violated      by      the   exclusion     of   defense\n\nevidence under a state rule of evidence.\u201d Nevada v. Jackson, __\n\nU.S. __, __, 186 L. Ed. 2d 62,                   66 (2013). Because we have\n\ndetermined that the trial court excluded Cloutier\u2019s testimony\n\nwithin   the    bounds    of    our   rules      of    evidence,     we     hold    that\n\nDefendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense was not\n\nviolated. Defendant\u2019s second argument is therefore overruled.\n\f                                     -23-\n      II. Character Evidence\n\n      Defendant      also   argues   that     the   trial    court   erred     in\n\nexcluding the testimony of Dr. Jerry Brittain, who addressed the\n\ndecedent\u2019s alleged proclivity toward violence. We disagree.\n\n             A. Voir Dire\n\n      At trial, Defendant called Dr. Brittain to the stand as a\n\nlay witness. The State objected, and the trial court conducted a\n\nvoir dire examination.\n\n      On voir dire, Dr. Brittain discussed meetings he held with\n\nthe decedent in June and July of 2011, approximately one year\n\nbefore the decedent\u2019s death. Referencing his notes from those\n\nmeetings, Dr. Brittain testified that the decedent was angry and\n\nfrustrated with many \u201careas\u201d of his life. By his second meeting\n\nwith the decedent, Dr. Brittain had begun \u201cto surmise\u201d that the\n\ndecedent was dealing with \u201caggression,\u201d \u201cthoughts of violence,\u201d\n\nand \u201cconflict that he had with the people that were around him.\u201d\n\nIn that meeting, Dr. Brittain and the decedent discussed \u201cthe\n\nviolence,\u201d and Dr. Brittain stressed the need for the decedent\n\nto   avoid   being    either   the   victim    or   the     perpetrator   in    a\n\nconfrontation. Dr. Brittain also referred to the decedent as \u201ca\n\nvery angry man,\u201d but noted that he was taking his medication,\n\n\u201cha[d] not perpetrated violence,\u201d and, in the decedent\u2019s words,\n\f                                        -24-\nwas \u201ctrying to not become angry and harm someone.\u201d When asked\n\nabout the source of the decedent\u2019s anger, Dr. Brittain testified\n\nthat it \u201cpermeated all of his life,\u201d but noted that the source\n\nwas not specifically related to Defendant, who was not discussed\n\nduring the meetings.\n\n       At the conclusion of voir dire, the trial court excluded\n\nDr. Brittain\u2019s testimony in its entirety on relevance grounds\n\nand under Rules 403 and 404(a)(2) of the North Carolina Rules of\n\nEvidence.\n\n             B. Legal Background and Analysis\n\n       Defendant argues that the trial court erred in excluding\n\nDr. Brittain\u2019s testimony, \u201c[s]imply put, [because] a violent man\n\nis    more   likely   to   be   the    aggressor   than       a    peaceable    man.\u201d\n\nDefendant     also    argues    that    this    error     prevented       him       from\n\noffering important evidence in his defense and, thus, \u201cdenied\n\nhim   his    constitutional     right    to    present    a       defense.\u201d    We    are\n\nunpersuaded.\n\n                  (1) Rule 404(a)(2)\n\n       Rule 404 provides, in pertinent part, that:\n\n             (a) . . . Evidence of a person\u2019s character\n             or   a  trait   of  his   character is not\n             admissible for the purpose of proving that\n             he acted in conformity therewith on a\n             particular occasion, except:\n\f                                     -25-\n           . . .\n\n                 (2) . . . Evidence of a pertinent\n                 trait of character of the victim\n                 of   the   crime   offered   by  an\n                 accused, or by the prosecution to\n                 rebut the same, or evidence of a\n                 character trait of peacefulness of\n                 the    victim    offered   by   the\n                 prosecution in a homicide case to\n                 rebut evidence that the victim was\n                 the first aggressor.\n\nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 404.\n\n    Character evidence is evidence of \u201c[t]he peculiar qualities\n\nimpressed by nature or by habit on the person, which distinguish\n\nhim from others.\u201d Bottoms v. Kent, 48 N.C. (3 Jones) 154, 160\n\n(1855). A person\u2019s character \u201ccan only be known indirectly . . .\n\nby inference from acts. A witness called to prove them, can only\n\ngive the opinion which he has formed by his observations of the\n\nconduct of the person under particular circumstances . . . .\u201d\n\nId. As distinct from reputation, \u201ccharacter is what a man is\u201d\n\nand \u201creputation is what others say he is.\u201d Kenneth S. Broun, 1\n\nBrandis & Broun on North Carolina Evidence 253 (6th ed. 2004)\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n    \u201cRule 404(a) is a general rule of exclusion, prohibiting\n\nthe introduction of character evidence to prove that a person\n\nacted in conformity with that evidence of character.\u201d State v.\n\nBogle,   324   N.C.   190,   201,   376   S.E.2d   745,   751   (1989).   Such\n\f                                     -26-\nevidence may be admitted, however, when testimony regarding a\n\npertinent character trait of the victim (here, the decedent) is\n\noffered by the defendant in a criminal case. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\n\n8C-1, Rule 404(a)(2). In cases where self-defense is at issue,\n\nevidence of a victim\u2019s violent or dangerous character may be\n\nadmitted under Rule 404(a)(2) when \u201c(1) such character was known\n\nto the accused, or (2) the [other] evidence of the crime is all\n\ncircumstantial or the nature of the transaction is in doubt.\u201d\n\nState v. Winfrey, 298 N.C. 260, 262, 258 S.E.2d 346, 347 (1979)\n\n(emphasis added); see also State v. Blackwell, 162 N.C. 672, 78\n\nS.E. 316 (1913) (\u201c[Evidence] is . . . competent to show the\n\ncharacter of the deceased as a violent and dangerous man when\n\nthe   [remaining]    evidence   is     wholly   circumstantial    and    the\n\ncharacter of the encounter is in doubt.\u201d) (emphasis added). This\n\nis because the evidence of the victim\u2019s violent character \u201ctends\n\nto shed some light upon who was the aggressor since a violent\n\nman is more likely to be the aggressor than is a peaceable man.\u201d\n\nWinfrey, 298 N.C. at 262, 258 S.E.2d at 348 (emphasis added).\n\n      In this case, the court excluded Dr. Brittain\u2019s testimony\n\nunder Rule 404(a)(2) because the witness \u201cdidn\u2019t testify as to\n\nany   trait   or   character.   He   was    simply   testifying   as    to   a\n\nfact. . . . He . . . was merely reciting what the facts were\n\f                                      -27-\nwhen    the    victim   presented     himself    [during     the     meetings].\u201d\n\nDefendant argues, however, that Dr. Brittain\u2019s testimony should\n\nhave been admitted pursuant to State v. Everett, 178 N.C. App.\n\n44, 630 S.E.2d 703 (2006), affirmed, 361 N.C. 217, 639 S.E.2d\n\n442 (2007). In that case, the defendant, arguing that she killed\n\nthe victim in self-defense, presented evidence that the victim\n\nhad committed a separate violent act. Id. at 52, 630 S.E.2d at\n\n708. The trial court excluded that testimony as irrelevant. Id.\n\nat 50, 630 S.E.2d at 707. We reversed the trial court\u2019s decision\n\nunder Winfrey and Rule 404(a)(2) and held that the evidence of\n\nthe violent act was relevant and admissible, in part, because it\n\nwas known by the defendant. Id. Defendant argues under Everett\n\nthat, \u201c[w]ithout the testimony from Dr. Brittain, the jury was\n\nunable to understand how [the decedent] was the aggressor. This\n\nevidence      established,   through       specific   examples,      that     [the\n\ndecedent] was a violent man and likely was the aggressor. The\n\nexclusion of this evidence by the trial court was error.\u201d We\n\ndisagree.\n\n       Dr. Brittain\u2019s testimony        \u2014     as the trial court noted in\n\nexcluding it under Rule 404(a) \u2014 does not constitute evidence of\n\nthe    decedent\u2019s   character   for    violence.      When   asked    about    his\n\nmeetings with the decedent, Dr. Brittain testified to the fact\n\f                                           -28-\nthat   the    decedent       was    an    angry    person       who   had   thoughts        of\n\nviolence. He did not, however, testify to his opinion that the\n\ndecedent was, inherently, a man of violent character or even a\n\nviolent person as distinguished from others. In fact, contrary\n\nto   Defendant\u2019s      argument       on    appeal,      Dr.     Brittain    affirmed        on\n\ncross-examination          that     \u201cthere        was     no    evidence      that        [the\n\ndecedent]      was    actually       committing         any    acts   of    violence[.]\u201d\n\nRather,     \u201c[h]e    was     just    generally      frustrated        at    the    system.\u201d\n\nBecause      Rule    404(a)(2)       only       allows        testimony     regarding       a\n\npertinent     character       trait,      the     trial       court   did   not     err    in\n\nexcluding      Dr.    Brittain\u2019s         testimony       as    inadmissible        on     that\n\nbasis.\n\n       To    the    extent    that       Dr.    Brittain\u2019s       testimony        could    be\n\nconstrued as character evidence, however, we note that this case\n\nis   distinct       from   Everett.       In    Everett,       the    evidence      of     the\n\nvictim\u2019s violent act fulfilled one of the Winfrey requirements \u2014\n\nit was known by the defendant \u2014 and, therefore, increased the\n\nlikelihood that the defendant acted out of self-defense. Dr.\n\nBrittain\u2019s testimony met neither requirement. First, it failed\n\nto show that Defendant was aware of any anger issues or the\n\nalleged violent nature of the decedent. Indeed, Dr. Brittain\n\nclearly stated that the source of the decedent\u2019s anger was not\n\f                                       -29-\nDefendant and that Defendant was not even discussed. Second,\n\nthere is ample direct evidence regarding the altercation between\n\nthe    decedent    and    Defendant.   The    altercation     was   recorded   on\n\nDefendant\u2019s tape recorder and was the subject of eye-witness\n\ntestimony. Such evidence is not circumstantial and, therefore,\n\ndoes not allow the trial court to admit the evidence under Rule\n\n404(a)(2). Accordingly, Defendant\u2019s argument is overruled.\n\n                   (2) Rules 401, 402, and 403\n\n       Defendant     also    argues    that    the    trial   court    erred   in\n\nexcluding Dr. Brittain\u2019s testimony as to Defendant\u2019s character\n\nfor violence because \u201c[the decedent\u2019s alleged] violent character\n\nis relevant as it relates to whether [he] was the aggressor\u201d and\n\nis not unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403 because \u201c[i]ts only\n\nprejudice to the State was its relevance to the defense.\u201d This\n\nargument is without merit.\n\n       Rule 401 of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence states\n\nthat \u201c\u2018[r]elevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency\n\nto make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the\n\ndetermination of the action more probable or less probable than\n\nit would be without the evidence.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule\n\n401.    Rule   402       provides   that     \u201c[a]ll   relevant      evidence   is\n\nadmissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of\n\f                                              -30-\nthe United States, by the Constitution of North Carolina, by Act\n\nof Congress, by Act of the General Assembly or by these rules.\n\nEvidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d N.C. Gen.\n\nStat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 402 (emphasis added). Rule 403 provides that\n\n\u201c[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative\n\nvalue    is    substantially           outweighed         by     the     danger     of    unfair\n\nprejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or\n\nby considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless\n\npresentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1,\n\nRule    403.    \u201cWe     review     a     trial       court\u2019s          decision     to    exclude\n\nevidence      under    Rule    403      for       abuse    of    discretion.\u201d           State   v.\n\nWhaley, 362 N.C. 156, 160, 655 S.E.2d 388, 390 (2008).\n\n       Because we have already determined that the trial court\n\nproperly      excluded      Dr.    Brittain\u2019s         testimony         as   not    admissible\n\nunder   Rule    404(a)(2),         we    need       not    address       these     alternative\n\nbases    for    exclusion.         Nonetheless,            we    note     that     Defendant\u2019s\n\nargument      does    not    provide         any    reason       to    believe     that    Judge\n\nAlbright      acted    arbitrarily           or    was    manifestly         unreasonable       in\n\ndetermining      that       \u201cany   probative             value    of     this    evidence       is\n\nsubstantially         outweighed        by    the    danger       of     unfair     prejudice,\n\nconfusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\u201d Defendant\u2019s\n\nargument is overruled.\n\f                                      -31-\n                   (3) Constitutional Right to Present a Defense\n\n    As a part of his preceding arguments, Defendant contends\n\nthat the trial court\u2019s exclusion of Dr. Brittain\u2019s testimony\n\nrequires    a    new   trial   because    it   violated   his    constitutional\n\nright to present witnesses in his own defense under Article VI\n\nof the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 23 of\n\nthe North Carolina Constitution. We disagree.\n\n    As we noted in section I(C)(2), the right to present a\n\ndefense is not absolute and does not apply when a trial court\n\nproperly    deems      evidence    inadmissible       under     the   rules   of\n\nevidence.       Because   we   have      determined   that      Dr.   Brittain\u2019s\n\ntestimony was properly excluded by the trial court under Rule\n\n404(a)(2), this argument is overruled.\n\n    NO ERROR.\n\n    Judges CALABRIA and ELMORE concur.\n\f",
