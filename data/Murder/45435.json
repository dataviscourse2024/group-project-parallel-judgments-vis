            "opinion_text": "\nMEMORANDUM*\nAlfonso Pascual-Garcia petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 decision denying his requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b) and we grant the petition.\nThis is a mixed motive case. Although the BIA is correct that PascualGarcia, an indigenous Mayan native of rural Guatemala, may have been persecuted because he witnessed his father\u2019s murder, it disregarded compelling evidence that Pascual-Garcia was also persecuted on the basis of an imputed political opinion. See Sangha v. INS, 103 F.3d 1482, 1489-90 (9th Cir.1997) (imputed political opinion provides basis for asylum relief). To establish eligibility for asylum, Pascual-Garcia needed to show only that he was persecuted, in part, on a statutory ground. See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, 320 F.3d 1061, 1068 (9th Cir.2003); Garcia-Ramos v. INS, 775 F.2d 1370 (9th Cir.1985).\nNeither the IJ nor the BIA questioned Pascual-Garcia\u2019s credibility. Pascual-Garcia\u2019s father was a long-time member and prominent leader of the Civil Patrols, a government unit, with a history of confrontations with the guerillas, including specifically Reyes. Pascual-Garcia testified that his father\u2019s murderer, whom Pascual-Garcia recognized as a neighbor and guerilla leader named Reyes, threatened to kill him if he either \u201cturned him over or ... told anybody that he was a guerilla.\u201d When Reyes learned that he was wanted by Guatemalan soldiers, he believed it was Pascual-Garcia who had informed upon him (even though this was in fact not true). Reyes began looking for the boy, causing him to flee the country. This evidence shows Reyes believed Pascual-Garcia was aligned with the government and antiguerilla (because if he were anti-government \u2014 unlike his father \u2014 he would not have informed), and pursued Pascual-Garcia on that basis.\nA rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution arises upon a finding of past persecution. See, e.g., Hoxha v. Ashcroft, 319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003); Ruano v. Ashcroft, *234301 F.3d 1155, 1159 (9th Cir.2002). Because substantial evidence compels a finding of past persecution on the basis of imputed political opinion, we must remand to give the government an opportunity to rebut this presumption. See Ventura v. INS, 317 F.3d 1003, 1005 (9th Cir.2003).\nBecause the BIA denied PascualGarcia\u2019s claim for withholding of deportation solely on the ground that he did not satisfy the lower threshold for asylum relief, we must remand Pascual-Gareia\u2019s withholding claim for further proceedings.\nThe BIA applied an incorrect legal standard in determining that Pascual-Garcia failed to state a prima facie case for relief under the CAT because he failed to establish that he would be tortured \u201cby or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical control of the victim.\u201d A CAT claim does not require that the torture would occur while the \u2019victim is in the custody or physical control of a public official. See Li Chen Zheng v. Ashcroft, 332 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir.2003) (remanding CAT claim where petitioner feared retaliation from \u201csnakeheads,\u201d i.e., \u201chuman smugglers\u201d of Chinese immigrants). We therefore must remand this claim as well.\nWe lack jurisdiction to grant Pascual-Garcia\u2019s request for voluntary departure. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c.\nPETITION GRANTED, ORDER VACATED, and REMANDED.\nKLEINFELD, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\nI respectfully dissent. This case turns on the standard of review. We may reverse the BIA decision where the evidence not only supports the contrary conclusion, but \u201ccompels\u201d the contrary conclusion that Pascual-Garcia was persecuted because of his political opinion.1 No one should have to witness his father\u2019s murder, but I respectfully disagree with the majority that Reyes statement \u201ccompels\u201d a finding that Pascual-Garcia has met his burden of establishing persecution of himself (as opposed to his father) because of his political opinion.\nThere is no evidence in the record that Pascual-Garcia had any political opinion of his own when his father was murdered or when he left Guatemala. While Reyes\u2019s threat to Pascual-Garcia \u201cthat if I, uh, turned him over or that if I told anybody that he was a guerrilla man that he was going to kill me\u201d2 might support the inference that Reyes imputed the father\u2019s political opinion onto his eleven year old son, Reyes\u2019s threat certainly does not compel such a finding. Rather, it is perfectly reasonable to conclude that Reyes threatened Pascual-Garcia to keep Pascual-Garcia \u2014 a witness to the murder \u2014 quiet. Given this reasonable interpretation of the threat, I cannot agree that the record compels a conclusion that Pascual-Garcia was threatened on account of an imputed political opinion.3 Even if his father\u2019s murderer had threatened Pascual-Garcia because he imputed a pro-government political opinion to the eleven year old boy, the evidence does not permit an inference that he faces a risk of persecution on account of his opinion if he returns. There is no reason evident from the record why he must re*235turn to the same village, or that his father\u2019s murderer is still there. And if he does, he is now twenty-two, not eleven. He is likely to recognize the murderer much more easily then the murderer can recognize him.\nBecause Pascual-Garcia has not presented evidence \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could find\u201d4 that Pascual-Garcia has not established past persecution, no remand is necessary to allow the INS to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. On this record, Pascual-Garcia\u2019s petition should be denied.5\n\n This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n\n\n.
