Because the record supports the trial court\u2019s\ndecision that the requirements for expunction have not been met, we conclude that\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion. We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s\njudgment.\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n      Appellant filed a pro se petition for expunction, seeking to expunge the\nrecords of an arrest for capital murder. Appellant attached some of those records to\nhis petition, and they included a felony complaint with a probable cause affidavit,\n\fan arrest warrant, and an offense report. These records revealed that appellant and\nanother individual were suspected in the robbery and killing of a convenience store\nclerk. Appellant claimed that these records should be expunged because the arrest\nnever resulted in an indictment, trial, or conviction for capital murder.\n\n       The district attorney filed an answer that generally denied appellant\u2019s claims.\nAccording to appellant, the district attorney submitted a letter in addition to this\nanswer, and the letter represented that appellant had been \u201ccharged with capital\nmurder . . . and that punishment was assessed at 75 years TDC.\u201d\n\n       The letter from the district attorney is not in our record, which means that we\ncannot confirm its contents.1 In any event, appellant filed a response for the express\npurpose of disproving the letter. The response included a judgment of conviction\nshowing that appellant had not been convicted of capital murder, as he correctly\nclaimed. However, the judgment showed that appellant was convicted of aggravated\nrobbery, and that the punishment was indeed seventy-five years\u2019 imprisonment.\nMoreover, the judgment revealed that the aggravated robbery occurred on the same\ndate as the capital murder, according to the arrest records attached to appellant\u2019s\npetition. The cause number that appears on that judgment is also the same cause\nnumber that appears on those arrest records.\n\n       The trial court set appellant\u2019s case for a hearing, but no transcript was made,2\nand the record is unclear as to whether any evidence was taken at that hearing or\n\n\n\n       1\n          As a matter of law, the representation that appellant alleges the letter contained could not\nbe true because, at the time of the offense, a capital felony was punishable either by life with the\npossibility of parole or by death\u2014not by a determinate period of years. See Act approved June 19,\n1993, 73d Leg., R.S., ch. 900, \u00a7 1.01, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 3586, 3602 (amended 2005) (current\nversion at Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 12.31).\n       2\n         Appellant asserted in his docketing statement on appeal that he would not be requesting\na reporter\u2019s record \u201cfor there are no reporter\u2019s records in this case.\u201d\n\n                                                  2\n\fwhether the case was simply decided by submission.3 What is clear, however, is the\nbasis for the trial court\u2019s decision. The recitals in the final judgment state that the\ntrial court considered the pleadings and the evidence and then determined that the\nsubstantive requirements for expunction had not been met.\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\n       Expunction is a statutory remedy governed by Article 55.01 of the Texas Code\nof Criminal Procedure. See Ex parte Scott, 476 S.W.3d 93, 94\u201395 (Tex. App.\u2014\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2015, no pet.). Even though this statute is contained in a\ncriminal code, an expunction proceeding is actually civil in nature. See Tex. Dep\u2019t\nof Pub. Safety v. J.H.J., 274 S.W.3d 803, 806 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.]\n2008, no pet.). The petitioner accordingly bears the burden of proving that all\nstatutory requirements have been met. See Harris Cnty. Dist. Att\u2019ys Office v.\nHopson, 880 S.W.2d 1, 3 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, no writ). Also,\nbecause an expunction is a statutory privilege rather than a constitutional or common\nlaw right, the statutory requirements are mandatory and exclusive. See Harris Cnty.\nDist. Att\u2019y v. Lacafta, 965 S.W.2d 568, 569 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 1997,\nno pet.). The trial court has no power to extend equitable relief beyond the clear\nmeaning of the expunction statute. See Ex parte Reed, 343 S.W.3d 306, 308 (Tex.\nApp.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, no pet.).\n\n       In pertinent part, the statute provides the following terms regarding a person\u2019s\nentitlement to expunction:\n\n\n       3\n          \u201cA trial court may rule on an expunction petition without conducting an oral hearing and\nwithout considering live testimony if the court has at its disposal all the information it needs to\nresolve the issues raised by the petition. Such information may be found, for example, in the\npleadings, affidavits, or other evidence in the record.\u201d Sepeda v. State, No. 14-15-00790-CV, 2016\nWL 6561473, at *4 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] Nov. 2, 2016, no pet.) (mem. op.) (internal\ncitations omitted).\n\n                                                3\n\f      (a) A person who has been placed under a custodial or noncustodial\n      arrest for commission of either a felony or misdemeanor is entitled to\n      have all records and files relating to the arrest expunged if . . .\n             (2) the person has been released and the charge, if any, has not\n             resulted in a final conviction and is no longer pending and there\n             was no court-ordered community supervision under Chapter 42A\n             for the offense, unless the offense is a Class C misdemeanor,\n             provided that:\n                    (A) . . . an indictment . . . charging the person with the\n                    commission of any felony offense arising out of the same\n                    transaction for which the person was arrested:\n                          (i) has not been presented against the person at any\n                          time following the arrest . . . or\n                          (ii) if presented at any time following the arrest, was\n                          dismissed or quashed . . . .\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 55.01.\n\n      The trial court decided that these substantive requirements were not met, and\nunder our standard of review, we must uphold that decision unless the trial court\nclearly abused its discretion. See Ex parte Cephus, 410 S.W.3d 416, 418 (Tex.\nApp.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, no pet.). In deciding whether the trial court\nabused its discretion, we consider whether the trial court\u2019s ruling is supported by the\nevidence. See Tex. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety v. G.B.E., 459 S.W.3d 622, 624 (Tex. App.\u2014\nAustin 2014, pet. denied).\n\n      When viewed in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s decision, the\nevidence supports an implied finding that appellant is disqualified for an expunction\nbecause his conviction for aggravated robbery arose out of the same transaction as\nhis arrest for capital murder. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 55.01(a)(2)(A)\n(providing that a person is not entitled to an expunction if he was indicted \u201cwith the\ncommission of any felony offense arising out of the same transaction for which the\n\n\n                                          4\n\fperson was arrested\u201d and the indictment was neither dismissed nor quashed).4\nAppellant\u2019s arrest records show that the capital murder was based on an underlying\nfelony of aggravated robbery. His judgment of conviction shows that the aggravated\nrobbery was committed on the same date as the capital murder. His judgment of\nconviction also shows that the aggravated robbery was assigned the same cause\nnumber as the capital murder.\n\n       Based on all of these parallels, the trial court could have reasonably concluded\nthat appellant was arrested for capital murder but indicted with the lesser offense of\naggravated robbery.5 Because the evidence also establishes that appellant was\nconvicted of that offense, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the\nindictment for aggravated robbery was neither dismissed nor quashed. Therefore,\nthe trial court could have reasonably decided that appellant did not carry his burden\nof showing that he was entitled to an expunction. Cf. Travis Cnty. Dist. Att\u2019y v. M.M.,\n354 S.W.3d 920, 927\u201328 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2011, no pet.) (en banc) (the petitioner\nwas not entitled to expunge her arrest records for DWI where the evidence was\nundisputed that she was indicted for a felony assault on a public servant that arose\nduring the same criminal transaction and the indictment was not dismissed or\nquashed).\n\n\n       4\n         Because this case involves related offenses under subsection (a)(2)(A), our analysis is not\naffected by the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s decision in T.S.N. or by our own court\u2019s decision in N.B.J.\nSee State v. T.S.N., 547 S.W.3d 617, 621 (Tex. 2018) (\u201cHere, a single arrest occurred for multiple\nunrelated offenses.\u201d); id. at 623 (applying subsection (a)(1) rather than subsection (a)(2)(A)); Ex\nparte N.B.J., \u2014 S.W.3d \u2014, 2018 WL 2701270, at *4 n.6 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] June\n5, 2018, no pet.) (\u201cHere, it is undisputed that N.B.J.\u2019s two charges arose out of unrelated criminal\nconduct.\u201d); id. at *6 (applying T.S.N. to subsection (a)(2)(B) rather than subsection (a)(2)(A)).\n       5\n          The district attorney attached several documents to her appellate brief in an effort to\nfurther establish the connection between the aggravated robbery and the capital murder. However,\nwe do not consider the appended documents in our analysis because they do not appear in the\nofficial appellate record. See Pablo Rion y Asociados, S.A. de C.V. v. Dauajare, 495 S.W.3d 494,\n499 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, no pet.).\n\n                                                 5\n\f                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      The trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      /s/       Tracy Christopher\n                                                Justice\n\n\nPanel consists of Justices Boyce, Christopher, and Busby.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f",
