Kirkendall, Judge Presiding\n\nOpinion by:       Marialyn Barnard, Justice\n\nSitting:          Marialyn Barnard, Justice\n                  Rebeca C. Martinez, Justice\n                  Patricia O. Alvarez, Justice\n\nDelivered and Filed: June 11, 2014\n\nAFFIRMED\n\n           Appellant Cody James Lorenz entered an open plea to the offense of felony murder and\n\nelected to have the trial court assess punishment. The trial court sentenced Lorenz to confinement\n\nfor fifty years in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2014Institutional Division. Lorenz raises\n\none issue on appeal, contending he received ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s judgment.\n\f                                                                                       04-13-00085-CR\n\n\n                                           BACKGROUND\n\n       Lorenz ran a red light and struck a vehicle driven by Amber Rollins as she proceeded\n\nthrough an intersection. Rollins died as a result of the collision. After the incident, Lorenz\u2019s blood\n\nwas drawn and it was determined he was intoxicated, having a blood alcohol level of .17 \u2014 more\n\nthan twice the legal limit. The parties stipulated to the blood alcohol level, and stipulated that\n\nLorenz had two prior convictions for driving while intoxicated (\u201cDWI\u201d).\n\n       Lorenz was indicted for the offense of felony murder \u2014 the underlying felony was DWI.\n\nAlthough the State need not prove a particular mental state to obtain a conviction for murder\n\ncommitted in the course of committing felony DWI, see Lomax v. State, 233 S.W.3d 302, 304, 311\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007), Lorenz\u2019s indictment stated, in part, that Lorenz, \u201cdid then and there\n\nintentionally or knowingly commit or attempt to commit an act clearly dangerous to human life\n\n. . . and the defendant was then and there in the course of intentionally or knowingly committing a\n\nfelony[.]\u201d\n\n       The case was called for jury trial. During pretrial hearing discussions, and before Lorenz\n\nwas present in the courtroom, the trial court asked \u201cif there was any chance of a plea in this case.\u201d\n\nLorenz\u2019s trial counsel replied, \u201cNo, your Honor.\u201d Almost immediately thereafter, the State moved\n\nto strike the portion of the indictment quoted above, arguing it was surplusage. The trial court\n\nstated the matter would be determined once Lorenz was in the courtroom. Lorenz\u2019s trial counsel\n\nstated he intended to object and would argue \u201cthat it\u2019s a fundamental right . . . my whole case was\n\n\u2014 was based on that.\u201d At that time, Lorenz was brought to the courtroom.\n\n       Once Lorenz was in the courtroom, the trial court took up the State\u2019s motion to strike the\n\nmental state portions of the indictment. The State argued that under the Lomax decision, the\n\nlanguage was surplusage because the State was not required to prove a mental state in a felony\n\nmurder case where the underlying felony is DWI. Lorenz\u2019s trial counsel objected, stating \u201cI object\n                                                 -2-\n\f                                                                                      04-13-00085-CR\n\n\non the grounds it\u2019s a fundamental right of the Defendant. In addition to that, it\u2019s not surplusage.\n\nThis is a violation of his Constitutional rights.\u201d The court overruled the objection and granted the\n\nState\u2019s motion. The trial court interlineated the mental state language from the indictment and\n\ninitialed the change.\n\n       At that point, having mentioned his intent to seek a continuance earlier in the proceedings\n\nin the event the State\u2019s motion was granted, Lorenz\u2019s counsel urged a motion for continuance, and\n\nin support called Lorenz to the stand. Lorenz testified he and his trial attorney spent a significant\n\namount of time discussing the importance of the \u201cintentionally or knowingly\u201d language that was\n\nincluded in the indictment. Lorenz testified that neither he nor his attorney knew the State was\n\ngoing to file a motion to delete the mental state language from the indictment. Lorenz further\n\nstated their entire case was premised on the existence of the mental state language in the\n\nindictment. According to Lorenz, given the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the State\u2019s motion to\n\nstrike that language, he needed time to discuss the case with his attorney so he could \u201cintelligently\n\nand voluntarily\u201d make decisions about how to proceed, specifically about whether to plead guilty.\n\n       The trial court denied the motion for continuance, but granted Lorenz and his counsel one\n\nhour and twenty minutes to confer about the case. After they conferred, they re-entered the\n\ncourtroom. The record establishes Lorenz was called to the stand, apparently having decided to\n\nenter a plea of guilt. The trial court first asked Lorenz if he had \u201cbeen over that indictment\u201d with\n\nhis attorney. Lorenz stated he had. The trial court then asked Lorenz if he understood the charges\n\nagainst him, to which Lorenz replied that he did. The trial court explained the range of punishment.\n\nThe trial court thereafter admonished Lorenz about his rights \u2014 right to a jury trial, cross-examine\n\nwitnesses, introduce evidence, etc. Lorenz stated he understood that if he pled guilty, he would\n\ngive up those rights. Lorenz admitted he and his attorney had reviewed the \u201cWaiver, Stipulations\n\nand Admonishments,\u201d and that he understood it before he signed it. Lorenz stated he had enough\n                                                -3-\n\f                                                                                         04-13-00085-CR\n\n\ntime to discuss the case with his attorney and review all the necessary paperwork. Lorenz further\n\nstated he was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s representation of him and that no one had forced him to\n\nplead guilty. Lorenz testified he was entering a plea of guilty because he committed the crime he\n\nwas pleading to. Lorenz then entered an open plea of guilty to the offense of felony murder.\n\n        Having entered an open plea and elected to have the trial court assess punishment, a\n\npunishment hearing was subsequently held. At the hearing, the State asked the trial court to\n\nincarcerate Lorenz for life. Lorenz asked for a lesser sentence, though he did not request a specific\n\nnumber of years. The trial court assessed punishment at fifty years\u2019 confinement.\n\n        Thereafter, Lorenz filed a motion for new trial in which he argued the trial court erred in\n\ngranting the State\u2019s motion to remove the mental state language from the indictment and in denying\n\nhis motion for continuance. Lorenz claimed these errors resulted in an involuntary plea given the\n\nshort time he was given to confer with trial counsel. He also asserted his trial counsel was\n\nineffective, testifying he did not understand the effect of the trial court\u2019s decision to strike portions\n\nof the indictment or how it would affect any trial strategy. Lorenz also claimed he did not\n\nunderstand his decision to plead guilty, and asserted he was taking a narcotic medication on the\n\nday of his plea, which may have affected his ability to understand what was happening. Lorenz\n\ntestified: (1) his attorney did not effectively explain the case to him, (2) he did not understand the\n\ndifference between murder and felony murder, (3) and he did not fully understand his possible\n\ndefense, particularly after the trial court granted the State\u2019s motion to remove the mental state\n\nlanguage from the indictment.\n\n        However, on cross-examination, Lorenz admitted he had pled guilty on four other\n\noccasions and that in those cases his attorneys explained the terms of the plea agreement and\n\naccompanying paperwork.         He also admitted that he read the \u201cWaiver, Stipulation and\n\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f                                                                                    04-13-00085-CR\n\n\nAdmonishments,\u201d discussed the terms with his attorney, and that he swore in court he understood\n\nthe document.\n\n       The trial court did not render a formal order denying the motion for new trial. Lorenz\n\nsubsequently filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n       On appeal, Lorenz contends he did not receive effective assistance of counsel as required\n\nby the Sixth Amendment. Specifically, Lorenz argues his trial counsel was ineffective because:\n\n(1) he believed he could defend Lorenz by arguing the State did not prove Lorenz acted\n\nintentionally or knowingly; and (2) he believed he could obtain a ten-day continuance under article\n\n28.10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when the State\u2019s request to abandon the mental state\n\nlanguage from the indictment was granted. Lorenz contends this deficient conduct resulted in his\n\nopen plea of guilt and subsequent fifty-year sentence.\n\n                                       Standard of Review\n\n       A criminal defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984); U.S. CONST. amend. VI. To determine whether\n\ncounsel\u2019s representation was inadequate so as to violate a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to\n\ncounsel, we apply the United States Supreme Court\u2019s two-pronged Strickland test. Thompson v.\n\nState, 9 S.W.3d 808, 812 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). Under Strickland, a party claiming ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel has the burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) deficient\n\nperformance of trial counsel; and (2) harm resulting from that deficiency sufficient to undermine\n\nconfidence in the outcome of the trial. Ex Parte LaHood, 401 S.W.3d 45, 49 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2013) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687). The assessment of whether a defendant received\n\neffective assistance of counsel is made on a case-by-case basis by looking to the totality of the\n\nrepresentation and the particular circumstances of the case. Thompson, 9 S.W.3d at 813.\n                                                -5-\n\f                                                                                     04-13-00085-CR\n\n\n       Our review of defense counsel\u2019s trial representation is highly deferential, and we must\n\npresume trial counsel\u2019s actions fell within the wide range of reasonable and professional\n\nassistance. Bone v. State, 77 S.W.3d 828, 833 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). Generally, a direct appeal\n\nis insufficient for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the record is typically\n\ninsufficient to show trial counsel\u2019s representation was so deficient and so lacking in legal tactics\n\nor strategy as to overcome the presumption that trial counsel\u2019s conduct was reasonable and\n\nprofessional. Id. Any claim of ineffectiveness must be firmly founded in the record and the record\n\nmust affirmatively demonstrate the alleged ineffectiveness.        Thompson, 9 S.W.3d at 813.\n\nMoreover, our inability to \u201cdiscern any particular strategy or tactical purpose in counsel\u2019s trial\n\npresentation,\u201d does not entitle us to assume there was none. Bone, 77 S.W.3d at 836. In fact, to\n\ndo so \u201cinverts the analysis.\u201d Id. It is up to the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence a lack of any plausible reason for trial counsel\u2019s act or omission. Id.\n\n                                           Application\n\n       We hold the record does not affirmatively demonstrate trial counsel lacked a sound trial\n\nstrategy or acted outside the proper range of reasonable and professional assistance. See Ex parte\n\nJimenez, 364 S.W.3d 866, 883 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012); Badillo v. State, 255 S.W.3d 125, 129\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 2008, no pet.). Thus, Lorenz has not sustained his burden.\n\n       Lorenz first argues trial counsel was ineffective because he erroneously believed he could\n\ndefend the felony-murder case by arguing the State could not prove that Lorenz acted intentionally\n\nor knowingly. Lorenz correctly points out that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held no proof\n\nof a mental state is necessary to obtain a conviction for felony murder when the underlying felony\n\nis DWI. See Lomax, 233 S.W.3d at 304, 311. However, the record does not establish that lack of\n\nevidence of a mental state was trial counsel\u2019s proposed trial strategy. In fact, the record belies\n\nsuch a claim, i.e., that counsel was unaware of the applicable law according to Lomax. When\n                                                -6-\n\f                                                                                       04-13-00085-CR\n\n\nspecifically asked by the trial court if his position was that a culpable mental state is required for\n\nthe offense of felony murder when the underlying felony is DWI, trial counsel responded \u201cNo,\n\nJudge. I\u2019m objecting to amending \u2014 . . . [w]ell abandoning.\u201d Thus, trial counsel affirmatively\n\ndenied a lack of knowledge of the applicable law. Moreover, trial counsel never stated this was\n\nhis strategy. Rather, he merely stated \u201cmy whole case was \u2014 was based on that.\u201d He then objected\n\nto the State\u2019s motion by stating \u201cit\u2019s a fundamental right of the Defendant . . . it\u2019s not surplusage\n\n. . . [t]his is a violation of his Constitutional rights.\u201d Nowhere does trial counsel contend he\n\nintended to defend Lorenz by arguing lack of evidence with regard to a mental state.\n\n        Trial counsel\u2019s conduct could plausibly be explained as an attack on a defective indictment,\n\npointing out a variance between the indictment and the offense charged. When an indictment\n\ncontains a defect, defense counsel may develop a trial strategy designed to exploit the defect. We\n\ndo not know the exact nature of trial counsel\u2019s strategy with regard to his objection to the\n\nindictment, but such knowledge is not necessary. Based on this record, it is possible counsel had\n\nlegitimate and professionally sound reasons for his objection \u2014 other than those attributed to him\n\nin this appeal.\n\n        Based on the record before this court, we cannot say trial counsel\u2019s strategy was outside of\n\nprofessional norms \u2014 such a finding is not firmly founded in the record.\n\n        Second, Lorenz contends that trial counsel erred in believing that he could automatically\n\nobtain a ten-day continuance when the State\u2019s request to abandon the surplus language was\n\ngranted. Lorenz argues that this resulted in his decision to plead guilty, after which he received a\n\nfifty-year sentence. There are, however, two problems with this argument. First, the record does\n\nnot support Lorenz\u2019s claim that trial counsel believed he was automatically entitled to a ten-day\n\ncontinuance under article 28.10, which states that when the State amends an indictment the court\n\nshall allow the defendant not less than ten days to respond to the amended indictment. See TEX.\n                                                 -7-\n\f                                                                                     04-13-00085-CR\n\n\nCODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 28.10(a) (West 2006). Rather, the record reflects trial counsel sought\n\na continuance so he would have additional time to discuss the surplusage issue with Lorenz and\n\nthe impact it might have on a decision to plead guilty. Extrapolating from the record, it could well\n\nbe that trial counsel \u2014 having lost the opportunity to possibly exploit a variance in the indictment\n\n\u2014 wanted to recommend Lorenz plead guilty, particularly given that the record establishes Lorenz\n\nintended to stipulate to his blood alcohol level and his two prior convictions. Counsel never\n\nmentions article 28.10(a).\n\n       In addition, the record is silent as to whether Lorenz would have made a different decision,\n\nthat is, pled not guilty, had the ten-day continuance been granted. It is unclear from the record\n\nwhat went into Lorenz\u2019s decision-making process. The record reflects that after the State\u2019s motion\n\nto remove the mental state language was granted, Lorenz and his trial counsel conferred for over\n\nan hour \u2014 despite Lorenz\u2019s claim at the motion for new trial hearing that it was mere minutes.\n\nAfter they conferred, Lorenz stated on the record that he was pleading guilty of his own volition\n\nbecause he did in fact commit the crime he was being charged with. He swore he understood the\n\ncharges and possible sentence, as well as the rights he was waiving.            Moreover, Lorenz\n\naffirmatively stated on the record that he was satisfied with his trial counsel\u2019s performance. Thus,\n\nwe hold the record does not demonstrate trial counsel acted outside the proper range of reasonable\n\nand professional assistance. See Badillo, 255 S.W.3d at 129.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       Because Lorenz has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that trial counsel\n\nwas ineffective for either reason asserted, we overrule his claims of ineffective assistance of\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f                                                                                 04-13-00085-CR\n\n\ncounsel. Lorenz\u2019s claims are not firmly founded in the record. Accordingly, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s judgment.\n\n                                               Marialyn Barnard, Justice\n\nDo Not Publish\n\n\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\f",
