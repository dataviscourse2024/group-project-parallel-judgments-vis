Barnett, 262 So. 3d\n\n750 (Fla. 4th DCA 2018). In a separate opinion in the same case, State\n\nDepartment of Financial Services v.

We have jurisdiction. See art. V, \u00a7 3(b)(4), Fla. Const. We rephrase\n\nthe certified question as follows:\n\n       WHEN MULTIPLE CLAIMS OF INJURY AGAINST A STATE\n       AGENCY OR ACTOR ARISE FROM ONE OVERALL INJURY-\n       CAUSING EVENT, DOES THE LIMITATION ON THE WAIVER\n       OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY IN SECTION 768.28(5), FLORIDA\n       STATUTES, CAP THE LIABILITY OF STATE AGENCIES AT\n       $200,000 FOR ALL RESULTING INJURIES OR DEATHS AS\n       CLAIMS AND JUDGMENTS \u201cARISING OUT OF THE SAME\n       INCIDENT OR OCCURRENCE\u201d?\n\nGiven this Court\u2019s long-standing precedent that strictly construes Florida law\n\nwaiving sovereign immunity, we answer the rephrased certified question in the\n\naffirmative and hold that the mass shooting committed by Patrick Dell is a single\n\n\u201cincident or occurrence\u201d for purposes of section 768.28(5), Florida Statutes (2010)\n\n(subsection (5)), and that the cumulative liability for all claims of injury resulting\n\nfrom the incident may not exceed the aggregate cap of $200,000 set forth in the\n\nstatute.\n\n                    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       In September 2010, Patrick Dell (Dell) entered the Riviera Beach residence\n\nof his estranged wife, Natasha Whyte-Dell (Whyte-Dell), where he fatally shot her\n\nand four of her children. Dell also severely wounded a fifth child by shooting him\n\nin the neck. Dell committed suicide shortly after exiting the residence.\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      Several months prior to the shootings, on January 26, 2010, the abuse hotline\n\nof the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) received a phone call\n\nabout an incident that occurred in December 2009. According to the police report,\n\nwhile Whyte-Dell was visiting a friend, Dell charged at and threatened Whyte-Dell\n\nwith a knife, verbally threatened to kill her, and flattened all four tires on her\n\nvehicle. Later the same morning, Dell was arrested for aggravated assault with a\n\ndeadly weapon and criminal mischief.\n\n      Over the course of the following month, DCF conducted an investigation but\n\nsubsequently closed the case file on February 25, 2010, after concluding that the\n\nchildren were not at significant risk of harm. The investigator\u2019s report stated:\n\n      [A]lthough there have been prior domestic disturbances between the\n      parents, this is the first time that there has been a significant domestic\n      violence matter between the two, and they have both agreed to a\n      safety plan which involves calling 911 should any future incidents\n      occur. The older children have been made aware of this as well.\n      Despite the serious nature of the matter for which the father was\n      arrested, investigation did not reveal any reliable evidence which\n      would lead this [investigator] to believe that the children are in any\n      significant risk at this time.\n             ....\n             The family requested daycare/aftercare services for the four\n      younger children, and such referral was made.\n\n      Michael Barnett (Barnett), individually, as the natural father and guardian of\n\nthe injured child, and in his capacity as the personal representative of the estates of\n\nthree of the deceased children, filed an action against DCF alleging claims of\n\nwrongful death and negligence. Leroy Nelson, Jr., (Nelson) filed a separate\n\n                                          -3-\n\fwrongful death action against DCF in his capacity as the personal representative of\n\nthe estate of the fourth deceased child.\n\n      Barnett\u2019s and Nelson\u2019s complaints alleged that DCF breached multiple\n\nnondelegable duties and failed to protect the children from an unreasonable risk of\n\nharm. Among the actions that DCF allegedly failed to take were failing to\n\nadequately follow up on the December 2009 incident, failing to inquire into\n\ndomestic disturbance calls placed from Whyte-Dell\u2019s residence between July 2009\n\nand November 2009, and failing to inquire into a domestic violence injunction\n\nobtained by Whyte-Dell against Dell that expired in July 2009.\n\n      DCF raised various affirmative defenses, including that Florida\u2019s limited\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity, codified at section 768.28, limited the aggregate\n\nrecovery available to Barnett and Nelson to $200,000.\n\n      Barnett and Nelson filed separate motions for partial summary judgment on\n\nthe sovereign immunity issue and adopted each other\u2019s motions. The Florida\n\nDepartment of Financial Services (DFS) filed a petition for declaratory relief,\n\nseeking a determination as to whether the $200,000 aggregate cap applied to all\n\nclaims arising out of the mass shooting committed at Whyte-Dell\u2019s residence. DFS\n\nalso filed a motion to intervene in the Barnett action and a motion to consolidate\n\nthe Barnett and Nelson cases for purposes of ruling on the petition for declaratory\n\nrelief and the motions for partial summary judgment. The trial court granted the\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fmotions to intervene in the declaratory action and to consolidate the two cases for\n\nthe limited purposes sought.\n\n      Following a hearing, the trial court granted both motions for partial\n\nsummary judgment, concluding that the shooting of each individual child was a\n\nseparate incident or occurrence for purposes of the sovereign immunity damage\n\ncaps set forth in subsection (5). The court also determined that as to the DFS\n\npetition for declaratory relief, \u201ceach wrongful death or personal injury claim is\n\neligible for the $100,000 per person and $200,000 per claim limitation found in\n\n[subsection (5)].\u201d\n\n      On appeal, the Fourth District reversed the decisions of the trial court. See\n\nBarnett, 262 So. 3d at 751. The district court concluded that the present case\n\n\u201cinvolves a single claim of negligence against [DCF] in the failure to properly\n\ninvestigate the family and the stepfather before closing its file. Thus, each estate\u2019s\n\nclaim and the claim of the injured child arise from the same incident of negligence\n\nof [DCF]. Therefore, the $200,000 cap per incident or occurrence applies to limit\n\nrecovery for all claims.\u201d Id. at 753.\n\n      In a separate opinion in the same case, on the motion to certify a question of\n\ngreat public importance, the Fourth District stated:\n\n             Unfortunately, our state has experienced a number of high-\n      profile mass shootings in the past several years, some of which have\n      led to negligence complaints against state agencies. In our opinion in\n      the instant case, we narrowly construed [subsection (5)] to limit the\n\n                                         -5-\n\f        sovereign immunity waiver to $200,000 when there are multiple\n        claims arising out of the same negligent act(s) committed by the state\n        agency. However, we acknowledge that a broader reading of the\n        statute could allow a per injury limitation.\n\nBarnett, 268 So. 3d at 759 (footnote omitted). The district court then certified the\n\nquestion set forth above as one of great public importance.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n   I.      Sovereign Immunity\n\n        The common law doctrine of sovereign immunity, pursuant to which a\n\ngovernment is immune from suit unless it consents to being sued, dates back to\n\nthirteenth-century England, Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44,\n\n102-03 (1996), and became Florida law when \u201c[t]he common law of England in\n\neffect on July 4, 1776, was adopted [by the Legislative Council of the Territory of\n\nFlorida] as the law of Florida and declared to be of full force and effect [in 1829].\u201d\n\nState v. Egan, 287 So. 2d 1, 3 (Fla. 1973) (quoting Coleman v. State, 159 So. 504,\n\n507 (Fla. 1935)). Florida\u2019s constitution expressly vests the Legislature with the\n\npower to waive sovereign immunity. See art. X, \u00a7 13, Fla. Const. (\u201cProvision may\n\nbe made by general law for bringing suit against the state as to all liabilities now\n\nexisting or hereafter originating.\u201d).\n\n        In 1973, the Legislature enacted section 768.28 waiving sovereign immunity\n\nwith respect to tort claims, \u201cbut only to the extent specified in this act.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f\u00a7 768.28(1), Fla. Stat. In pertinent part, subsection (5) provides that in the absence\n\nof a \u201cfurther act of the Legislature,\u201d known as a claims bill, the damages that may\n\nbe paid by the State, its agencies, or subdivisions are limited to $100,000 for a\n\nclaim or judgment by any one person and that all claims or judgments \u201carising out\n\nof the same incident or occurrence\u201d may not exceed $200,000. At the time of the\n\n2010 mass shooting, the statute provided in pertinent part as follows:\n\n             (1) In accordance with s. 13, Art. X of the State Constitution,\n      the state, for itself and for its agencies or subdivisions, hereby waives\n      sovereign immunity for liability for torts, but only to the extent\n      specified in this act. Actions at law against the state or any of its\n      agencies or subdivisions to recover damages in tort for money\n      damages against the state or its agencies or subdivisions for injury or\n      loss of property, personal injury, or death caused by the negligent or\n      wrongful act or omission of any employee of the agency or\n      subdivision while acting within the scope of the employee\u2019s office or\n      employment under circumstances in which the state or such agency or\n      subdivision, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant, in\n      accordance with the general laws of this state, may be prosecuted\n      subject to the limitations specified in this act. . . .\n\n             ....\n\n             (5) The state and its agencies and subdivisions shall be liable\n      for tort claims in the same manner and to the same extent as a private\n      individual under like circumstances, but liability shall not include\n      punitive damages or interest for the period before judgment. Neither\n      the state nor its agencies or subdivisions shall be liable to pay a claim\n      or a judgment by any one person which exceeds the sum of $100,000\n      or any claim or judgment, or portions thereof, which, when totaled\n      with all other claims or judgments paid by the state or its agencies or\n      subdivisions arising out of the same incident or occurrence, exceeds\n      the sum of $200,000. However, a judgment or judgments may be\n      claimed and rendered in excess of these amounts and may be settled\n      and paid pursuant to this act up to $100,000 or $200,000, as the case\n\n                                         -7-\n\f            may be; and that portion of the judgment that exceeds these amounts\n            may be reported to the Legislature, but may be paid in part or in\n            whole only by further act of the Legislature.\n\n\u00a7 768.28(1), (5), Fla. Stat. (emphasis added). 1\n\n            This case requires us to decide, as applied to this mass shooting, what the\n\nstatute means when it limits the State\u2019s liability to a total of $200,000 for all claims\n\nor judgments \u201carising out of the same incident or occurrence,\u201d id., after which\n\nclaimants must seek additional compensation \u201cby further act of the Legislature.\u201d\n\nId.\n\n      II.      Relevant Principles of Statutory Construction\n\n            The statute here does not define the key phrase \u201carising out of the same\n\nincident or occurrence.\u201d Accordingly, \u201cthe phrase should be accorded its plain and\n\nordinary meaning, giving due regard for the context in which it is used.\u201d Hampton\n\nv. State, 103 So. 3d 98, 110 (Fla. 2012).\n\n            Only if there is any ambiguity in the statute would we resort to substantive\n\nrules of statutory construction. The two rules applicable to the certified question\n\nwould require that we resolve any ambiguity by reading the statute narrowly, in the\n\nmanner that limits the amount recoverable from the State without further action by\n\n\n\n\n      1. In 2010, subsection (5) was amended to raise the individual cap to\n$200,000 and the aggregate cap to $300,000, effective October 1, 2011. Ch. 2010-\n26, Laws of Fla.\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\fthe Legislature. First, \u201c[s]tatutes that alter the common law are narrowly\n\nconstrued.\u201d Hardee County v. FINR II, Inc., 221 So. 3d 1162, 1165 (Fla. 2017).\n\nSecond, \u201c[w]aivers of sovereign immunity must be construed narrowly in favor of\n\nthe government.\u201d Id.; see Manatee County v. Town of Longboat Key, 365 So. 2d\n\n143, 147 (Fla. 1978); see also Spangler v. Florida State Tpk. Auth., 106 So. 2d\n\n421, 424 (Fla. 1958) (explaining that \u201c[i]nasmuch as immunity of the state and its\n\nagencies is an aspect of sovereignty, the courts have consistently held that statutes\n\npurporting to waive the sovereign immunity must be clear and unequivocal\u201d and\n\nthat the narrow interpretation of waivers of sovereign immunity protect \u201cthe public\n\nagainst profligate encroachments on the public treasury\u201d). No party has argued\n\nthat this precedent is unsound.\n\n   III.   DFS\u2019s Breach of Duty Argument\n\n      \u201cThe elements of a cause of action in tort are: (1) a legal duty owed by\n\ndefendant to plaintiff, (2) breach of that duty by defendant, (3) injury to plaintiff\n\nlegally caused by defendant\u2019s breach, and (4) damages as a result of that injury.\u201d\n\nEstate of Rotell v. Kuehnle, 38 So. 3d 783, 788 (Fla. 2d DCA 2010) (quoting\n\nO\u2019Keefe v. Orea, 731 So. 2d 680, 684 (Fla. 1st DCA 1998)). Most negligence\n\nclaims involve a negligent actor (one who owes a legal duty and breaches that\n\nduty) directly causing injury for which a plaintiff seeks to recover damages. This\n\nis because \u201c[g]enerally, one has no duty to control the conduct of another to\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fprevent harm, and no duty to warn those who may be endangered by harmful\n\nconduct, including the criminal acts of a third person.\u201d 65 C.J.S., Negligence \u00a7 60\n\n(2010) (footnotes omitted). However, \u201c[a]n act or an omission may be negligent if\n\nthe actor realizes or should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to\n\nanother through the conduct of the other or a third person which is intended to\n\ncause harm, even though such conduct is criminal.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\n\u00a7 302B (1965). This theory of liability is often referred to as \u201cderivative liability\u201d\n\nand involves \u201cwrongful conduct both by the person who is derivatively liable and\n\nthe actor whose wrongful conduct was the direct cause of injury to another. The\n\nliability is derivative because it depends upon a subsequent wrongful act or\n\nomission.\u201d William D. Underwood & Michael D. Morrison, Apportioning\n\nResponsibility in Cases Involving Claims of Vicarious, Derivative, or Statutory\n\nLiability for Harm Directly Caused by the Conduct of Another, 55 Baylor L. Rev.\n\n617, 619 (2003) (footnote omitted). Barnett\u2019s tort theory is that DCF is\n\nderivatively liable for Dell\u2019s criminal conduct, and the parties disagree as to\n\nwhether the $200,000 limit in subsection (5) is linked to DCF\u2019s wrongful conduct\n\nor Dell\u2019s wrongful conduct.\n\n      DFS argues that the statutory phrase \u201cincident or occurrence\u201d refers to the\n\nnegligent or wrongful acts or omissions of its employees, the \u201cstate actors,\u201d as held\n\nby the Fourth District. Barnett disagrees, arguing that \u201cincident or occurrence\u201d\n\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\frefers to Dell\u2019s crimes, which directly harmed Whyte-Dell and her children. On\n\nthis issue, we agree with Barnett for three reasons.\n\n      First, to equate \u201cnegligent or wrongful act or omission\u201d with \u201cincident or\n\noccurrence\u201d would negate the Legislature\u2019s decision to use different phrases in\n\ndifferent parts of section 768.28. Section 768.28 does not limit liability to\n\n$200,000 for all claims arising out of the same \u201cnegligent or wrongful act or\n\nomission\u201d of a state actor. Instead, it uses the phrase \u201cnegligent or wrongful act or\n\nomission\u201d to describe the state actor\u2019s breach of duty in subsections (1) and (14);\n\nuses the phrases \u201cact or omission,\u201d \u201cacts or omissions,\u201d and \u201cact, event or\n\nomission\u201d to describe the state actor\u2019s breach of duty in subsection (9); and uses\n\nthe phrases \u201cacts or omissions\u201d and \u201cact or omission\u201d to describe the State\u2019s breach\n\nof duty in subsections (14) and (19). If the Legislature wanted to link the limit of\n\nliability to a state actor\u2019s breach of duty, it knew how to describe the breach,\n\nhaving done so repeatedly with the \u201cact or omission\u201d language. Use of the words\n\n\u201cincident or occurrence\u201d in subsection (5) signals that the language means\n\nsomething different.\n\n      Second, the definitions cited by Barnett show that the words \u201cincident\u201d and\n\n\u201coccurrence\u201d more naturally and reasonably include the point at which damages\n\nare inflicted, not just the (potentially remote) point at which the state defendant\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\fnegligent or wrongful act occurs. \u201cIncident\u201d is defined as \u201can individual\n\noccurrence or event,\u201d Dictionary.com, https://www.dictionary.com/browse\n\n/incident?s=t (last visited Sept. 17, 2020); \u201can occurrence of an action or situation\n\nthat is a separate unit of experience,\u201d Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-\n\nwebster.com/dictionary/incident (last visited Sept. 17, 2020); or \u201ca discrete\n\noccurrence or happening; an event,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 911(11th ed. 2019).\n\nThe word \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201csomething that takes place[;] the action or\n\nprocess of happening or taking place,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International\n\nDictionary 1561 (1981); \u201cthe action, fact, or instance of occurring,\u201d\n\nDictionary.com, https://www.dictionary.com/browse/occurrence?s=t (last visited\n\nSept. 17, 2020); or \u201csomething that occurs; the action or fact of happening or\n\noccurring,\u201d Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-\n\nwebster.com/dictionary/occurrence (last visited Sept. 17, 2020). What these\n\ndefinitions all share in common is action, a happening, an event. The words work\n\nto describe Dell\u2019s immediate harm-causing actions, which could also be described\n\nas an event, but not to describe DCF\u2019s alleged omissions and failures to act. With\n\nrespect to DCF, Barnett alleged that \u201c[d]espite the growing number of domestic\n\ndisturbance calls and . . . DCF\u2019s obligations to comply with all state and federal\n\nlaws and regulations as well as departmental/district procedures regarding the\n\nsafety of minor children . . .

Because the definitions\n\nof \u201cincident\u201d and \u201coccurrence\u201d match the injury-causing event in all cases and do\n\nnot match the omissions or wrongful conduct of the initial tortfeasor in a derivative\n\nliability case, we conclude that the phrase \u201cinjury or occurrence\u201d is most\n\nreasonably understood as referring to the injury-causing event.\n\n      Finally, the relevant statutory phrase is \u201cclaim or judgment . . . arising out of\n\nthe same incident or occurrence\u201d and the text\u2019s use of the words \u201carising out of\u201d\n\nalso are best understood to include the immediate injury-causing event, not just the\n\nnegligent omissions that allegedly gave rise to that event. The object of \u201carising\n\nout of\u201d in the statute is the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cclaim or judgment.\u201d No claim exists, and no\n\njudgment can occur, until the cause of action accrues by completion of the last\n\nelement\u2014\u201cdamages as a result of [an] injury.\u201d Kuehnle, 38 So. 3d at 788 (quoting\n\nO\u2019Keefe, 731 So. 2d at 684). \u201cArise\u201d is defined as \u201cto begin to occur or to exist[;]\n\nto come into being.\u201d Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-\n\nwebster.com/dictionary/arise (last visited Sept. 17, 2020). Because the claim does\n\nnot \u201ccome into being\u201d or \u201cbegin to exist\u201d until the last element accrues, the text is\n\nmost reasonably read as including the \u201cincident or occurrence\u201d that caused the last\n\n\n                                         - 13 -\n\felement and the cause of action to accrue\u2014the injury-causing event, that is, the\n\nevent at which damages are actually inflicted.\n\n      Having determined that the incident or occurrence in this derivative liability\n\ncase is the injury-causing event, the next question is whether, in the context of a\n\nmass shooting incident involving multiple deaths or injuries, the \u201csame incident or\n\noccurrence\u201d is referring to the whole event or criminal episode, i.e., the \u201cshooting\n\nincident,\u201d or whether the shooting of each victim constitutes a separate incident or\n\noccurrence.\n\n   IV.    One \u201cIncident or Occurrence\u201d or Multiple Incidents?\n\n      Barnett argues that the shooting of each individual victim should be viewed\n\nas a separate \u201cincident or occurrence,\u201d relying primarily on Florida cases that\n\neither (1) involved distinct and separate events that could only be reasonably\n\nviewed as separate incidents, see, e.g., Pierce v. Town of Hastings, 509 So. 2d\n\n1134, 1135 (Fla. 5th DCA 1987) (holding that separate counts of false\n\nimprisonment and malicious prosecution arising from arrests separated by more\n\nthan a month for violations of a county ordinance that were also separated by an\n\nequivalent amount of time constituted separate incidents for purposes of applying\n\nsubsection (5)); Zamora v. Fla. Atl. Univ. Bd. of Trs., 969. So. 2d 1108, 1114 (Fla.\n\n4th DCA 2007) (ruling that an age discrimination claim and a separate cause of\n\naction for retaliation, based upon action taken after the claimant filed the age\n\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\fdiscrimination complaint, constituted separate incidents for purposes of applying\n\nsubsection (5)), or (2) interpreted the word \u201coccurrence\u201d in an insurance contract,\n\nsee, e.g., Koikos v. Travelers Ins. Co., 849 So. 2d 263, 273 (Fla. 2003) (holding\n\nthat the shooting of each individual victim at an insured\u2019s property during the same\n\ncriminal episode constituted a separate \u201coccurrence\u201d for purposes of recovery\n\nunder the terms of the insurance contract); N.H. Ins. Co. v. RLI Ins. Co., 807 So. 2d\n\n171, 171-72 (Fla. 3d DCA 2002) (same). The first group of cases, that could only\n\nbe reasonably viewed as involving separate incidents, are not analogous to the facts\n\nof this case, do not address the question at issue in this case, do not analyze the text\n\nof subsection (5) in a way that sheds any light on the issue before us, and in no way\n\naid our analysis.\n\n      With respect to the second group of cases, the insurance contract cases,\n\nBarnett\u2019s argument ignores the \u201cfundamental principle of statutory construction\n\n(and, indeed, of language itself) that the meaning of a word cannot be determined\n\nin isolation, but must be drawn from the context in which it is used.\u201d Advisory Op.\n\nto Governor re Implementation of Amendment 4, the Voting Restoration\n\nAmendment, 288 So. 3d 1070, 1079 (Fla. 2020) (quoting Textron Lycoming\n\nReciprocating Engine Div., Avco Corp. v. United Auto., Aerospace, Agric.\n\nImplement Workers of Am., Int\u2019l Union, 523 U.S. 653, 657 (1998)). The question\n\npresented in Koikos focused on how the word \u201coccurrence\u201d was \u201cdefined in the\n\n\n                                         - 15 -\n\fpolicy of liability issued by Travelers to Koikos, the insured.\u201d 849 So. 2d at 266.\n\nThe majority answered this question by analyzing the word \u201caccident,\u201d a word\n\ncentral to the policy\u2019s definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d and which the majority found to\n\nbe controlling in its analysis of the policy language. Id. at 266-71. Subsection (5)\n\ndoes not use the word \u201caccident,\u201d and given the wholly different contexts, we find\n\nthe argument based upon the insurance policy cases unhelpful and unpersuasive.\n\nWe also note that any ambiguity in an insurance contract must be \u201cliberally\n\nconstrued in favor of coverage and strictly against the insurer.\u201d Gov\u2019t Emps. Ins.\n\nCo. v. Macedo, 228 So. 3d 1111, 1113 (Fla. 2017) (quoting Wash. Nat\u2019l Ins. Corp.\n\nv. Ruderman, 117 So. 3d 943, 950 (Fla. 2013)). By contrast, and as already\n\ndiscussed, ambiguities in this sovereign-immunity-waiving statute must be\n\n\u201cconstrued narrowly in favor of the government.\u201d FINR II, Inc., 221 So. 3d at\n\n1165.\n\n        Finally, Barnett focuses on the word \u201csame,\u201d arguing that it modifies the\n\nphrase \u201cincident or occurrence\u201d and that because each victim was shot \u201cat different\n\npoints in time, in different parts of the home,\u201d and was \u201ca specific targeted\n\nindividual,\u201d we should view each separate shooting as a different event. Barnett\u2019s\n\njuxtaposition of the words \u201csame\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d is not helpful because one could\n\nalso accurately say that all victims were targeted by the same person, in the same\n\nhouse, at the same time, with the same weapon, in a single criminal episode. See\n\n\n                                        - 16 -\n\fe.g., State v. Sousa, 903 So. 2d 923, 924, 927 (Fla. 2005) (describing \u201ca shooting\n\nspree at a greyhound track and involved three victims, with two of the victims\n\nbeing shot by Sousa in rapid succession\u201d as \u201ca single criminal episode\u201d); Francis\n\nv. State, 808 So. 2d 110, 136 (Fla. 2001) (\u201cThis Court has repeatedly held that\n\nwhere a defendant is convicted of multiple murders, arising from the same criminal\n\nepisode, the contemporaneous conviction as to one victim may support the finding\n\nof the prior violent felony aggravator as to the murder of another victim.\u201d)\n\n(emphasis added); James v. State, 695 So. 2d 1229, 1231, 1236 (Fla. 1997)\n\n(describing the murder of one victim by strangulation in one room followed by\n\nsexual assault, and then murder of a second victim by stabbing in a second room,\n\nand followed by the kidnapping of a third victim confined in a third room as a\n\n\u201csingle criminal episode\u201d).\n\n      The phrase \u201csame incident or occurrence\u201d is most reasonably understood as\n\nreferring to the criminal (more broadly, injury-causing) event as a whole, not to the\n\nsmaller segments of time and action that make up the crime against each individual\n\nvictim, because this is the way that we commonly talk about this type of tragic\n\noccurrence\u2014as a single event with multiple victims. Additionally, this reading fits\n\nmost naturally given the context of subsection (5), which is designed to limit the\n\nState\u2019s liability to a set amount for all claims arising out of an \u201cincident or\n\noccurrence,\u201d after which all claimants must seek additional compensation from the\n\n\n                                         - 17 -\n\fLegislature. See \u00a7 768.28(5) (limiting the State\u2019s liability to $100,000 per person\n\nwith an aggregate cap of $200,000 for \u201call . . . claims or judgments paid by the\n\nstate or its agencies or subdivisions arising out of the same incident or\n\noccurrence\u201d). As argued by DFS, Barnett would essentially have us write this\n\naggregate cap out of the statute altogether for most claims involving a criminal\n\nepisode with multiple victims. We cannot rewrite the statute and do not view\n\nBarnett\u2019s reading as reasonable.\n\n      However, to the extent that the phrase \u201cincident or occurrence\u201d is ambiguous\n\nand could reasonably be read as referring either to the overall incident or to the\n\nsmaller segments of time and action that constitute the individual crimes against\n\neach separate victim, this would lead us to the substantive rules of statutory\n\nconstruction that statutes altering the common law \u201care narrowly construed\u201d and\n\nthat \u201c[w]aivers of sovereign immunity must be construed narrowly in favor of the\n\ngovernment.\u201d FINR II, Inc., 221 So. 3d at 1165.\n\n      In sum, the claims stemming from the mass shooting of Dell\u2019s victims arose\n\nfrom the same incident or occurrence and are therefore subject to the $200,000\n\naggregate cap for damages paid by the State, its agencies, or subdivisions.\n\nSubsection (5) does not prevent Barnett and Nelson from obtaining a judgment in\n\nexcess of the sovereign immunity damage caps set forth therein. The caps do,\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 18 -\n\fhowever, limit the amount of the recovery that the State\u2014in the absence of a\n\nclaims bill\u2014shall be liable to pay without further act by the Legislature.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n      Today\u2019s decision in no way devalues the lives of those injured or killed as a\n\nresult of mass shootings, or the harm suffered as a result of such tragedies. It is a\n\ndecision that is rendered within the narrow confines of Florida law relating to the\n\nLegislature\u2019s limited waiver of sovereign immunity. Further, nothing precludes\n\nthe parties from seeking a claims bill from the Legislature for compensation in\n\nexcess of the sovereign immunity damage caps in subsection (5).\n\n      For the reasons expressed, we answer the rephrased certified question in the\n\naffirmative and approve the result reached in the Fourth District Court of Appeal.\n\n      It is so ordered.\n\nCANADY, C.J., and POLSTON, LABARGA, LAWSON, and MU\u00d1IZ, JJ.,\nconcur.\nCOURIEL and GROSSHANS, JJ., did not participate.\n\nNOT FINAL UNTIL TIME EXPIRES TO FILE REHEARING MOTION AND,\nIF FILED, DETERMINED.\n\nApplication for Review of the Decision of the District Court of Appeal \u2013 Certified\nGreat Public Importance\n\n      Fourth District - Case No. 4D17-2840\n\n      (Palm Beach County)\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 19 -\n\fH.
