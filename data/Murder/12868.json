Background\n\n        On April 4, 2003, the Petitioner pled guilty to second degree murder, and the trial court\nsentenced him to serve eighteen years. The Petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus relief on\nDecember 27, 2007, and the habeas court denied him relief. It is from this judgment that the\nPetitioner now appeals.\n\n                                             II. Analysis\n\n       On appeal, the Petitioner claims the habeas court erred because: (1) the trial court sentenced\n\fhim in contravention of his constitutional rights; and (2) the trial court sentenced him in\ncontravention of state statutes.\n\n        Article I, section 15 of the Tennessee Constitution guarantees the right to seek habeas corpus\nrelief. See Faulkner v. State, 226 S.W.3d 358, 361 (Tenn. 2007). Tennessee statute, however,\ngoverns the exercise of this constitutional guarantee. See T.C.A. \u00a7 29-21-101 (2006). Although\nstatute does not limit the number of requests for habeas corpus relief a petitioner may make, it does\nnarrowly limit the grounds upon which a court may grant habeas corpus relief. Taylor v. State, 995\nS.W.2d 78, 83 (Tenn. 1999). The petitioner must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence\nthat \u201cthe sentence is void or that confinement is illegal.\u201d Wyatt v. State, 24 S.W.3d 319, 322 (Tenn.\n2000). In other words, a petitioner must base his request for habeas corpus relief upon the following\nvery narrow grounds: (1) a claim that, because the convicting court was without jurisdiction or\nauthority to sentence the petitioner, the convicting court\u2019s judgment is facially invalid and, thus,\nvoid; or (2) a claim that the petitioner\u2019s sentence has expired. Stephenson v. Carlton, 28 S.W.3d\n910, 911 (Tenn. 2000); Archer v. State, 851 S.W.2d 157, 164 (Tenn. 1993). Also, \u201c[a]n illegal\nsentence, one whose imposition directly contravenes a statute, is considered void and may be set\naside at any time.\u201d May v. Carlton, 245 S.W.3d 340, 344 (Tenn. 2008) (citing State v. Burkhard,\n566 S.W.2d 871, 873 (Tenn. 1978). In contrast, a voidable judgment is \u201cone that is facially valid\nand requires the introduction of proof beyond the face of the record or judgment to establish its\nvalidity.\u201d Taylor, 955 S.W. 2d at 83; see State v. Richie, 20 S.W.3d 624, 633 (Tenn. 2000).\n\n        A habeas court is not required, as a matter of law, to grant the writ or conduct an inquiry into\nthe allegations contained in the petition. See T.C.A. \u00a7 29-21-109 (2006). If the petition fails on its\nface to state a cognizable claim, it may be summarily dismissed by the trial court. See State ex. rel.\nByrd v. Bomar, 381 S.W.2d 280, 283 (1964); T.C.A. \u00a7 29-21-109. \u201cIf from the showing of the\npetitioner, the plaintiff would not be entitled to any relief, the writ may be refused.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 29-21-\n109.\n\n       Whether habeas corpus relief should be granted is a question of law. Edwards v. State, 269\nS.W.3d 915, 919 (Tenn. 2008). Thus, we apply de novo review and afford no presumption of\ncorrectness to the findings and conclusions of the court below. Summers v. State, 212 S.W.3d 251,\n255 (Tenn. 2007); Hogan v. Mills, 168 S.W.3d 753, 755 (Tenn. 2005).\n\n                                       A. Constitutional Claim\n\n        In this appeal, the Petitioner claims that he is entitled to habeas corpus relief because the trial\ncourt sentenced him in contravention of his constitutional rights, as described in Apprendi v. New\nJersey. 530 U.S. 466 (2000). We note the Petitioner is adamant that he is not arguing that his\nsentence was imposed in violation of his constitutional right to a jury trial as articulated in Blakely\nv. Washington, rather, he argues that his right a jury trial was infringed upon as interpreted in\nApprendi. See Blakely, 542 U.S. 296 (2004); see also Apprendi, 530 U.S. 466. More specifically,\nhe argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enhance his sentence by two years without a jury\nmaking a finding of those enhancement facts or without using a standard greater than a\n\n\n                                                    2\n\fpreponderance of the evidence of the existence of enhancement factors.\n\n        The United States Supreme Court created a bright line rule in Apprendi v. New Jersey that\n\u201cany fact [other than a prior conviction] that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed\nstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S.\nat 490. In Blakely v. Washington, the Court held that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for Apprendi\npurposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in\nthe jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is\nnot the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he\nmay impose without any additional findings.\u201d 542 U.S. at 303-04. Blakely is a further clarification\nof the Sixth amendment right to a jury trial described in Apprendi.\n\n         We have previously held that while \u201c[i]t is constitutional error in violation of a defendant\u2019s\nright to trial by jury for the trial court to increase a sentence above the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 sentence\nbased upon facts, other than prior convictions, not found by a jury,\u201d such an error would \u201crender the\njudgment merely voidable, and not void.\u201d Billy Merle Meeks v. Ricky J. Bell, Warden, No. M2005-\n00626-CCA-R3-HC, 2007 WL 4116486, at *7 (Tenn. Crim. App., at Nashville, Nov. 13, 2007),\nperm. app. denied (Tenn. Apr. 7, 2008). Thus, such a claim is not a cognizable Tennessee habeas\ncorpus claim. Id. Moreover, the Petitioner\u2019s claim requires this Court to look beyond the face of\nthe judgment, which is beyond the scope of habeas corpus relief. See Taylor, 955 S.W. 2d at 83.\nThe Petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief on this issue.\n\n                                         B. Statutory Claim\n\n         The Petitioner next contends that he is entitled to relief because the trial court sentenced him\nin violation of the Tennessee Criminal Reform Act of 1989. See T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-101 et seq. The\nPetitioner directs this Court to the record and the transcript of his sentencing hearing as evidence of\nthe trial court\u2019s errors in applying mitigating and enhancement factors and meeting the requirements\nof a proper guilty plea hearing, as prescribed by Rule 11 of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal\nProcedure.\n\n        As we stated above, in order to grant habeas relief, there must be an error on the face of the\njudgment that renders the petitioner\u2019s judgment void. See Taylor, 955 S.W.2d at 83. The Petitioner\npled guilty to second degree murder, which is a Class A felony, and the trial court classified him as\na Standard, Range I offender. T.C.A. \u00a7 39-13-210(b) (2001). A defendant convicted of a Class A\nfelony and classified as a Standard, Range I offender may be sentenced to serve between fifteen and\ntwenty-five years. T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-112(a)(1) (2001). The Petitioner was sentenced to eighteen years,\nwhich is within the statutory range. His judgment is not void on its face, and he is not entitled to\nrelief on this issue.\n\n                                           III. Conclusion\n\n        After a thorough review of the record and relevant authorities, we conclude that the habeas\n\n\n                                                   3\n\fcourt properly dismissed the Petitioner\u2019s petition for habeas corpus relief. Accordingly, we affirm\nthe judgment of the habeas court.\n\n\n                                                          ________________________________\n                                                           ROBERT W.
