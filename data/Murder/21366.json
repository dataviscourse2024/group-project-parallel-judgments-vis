He was sentenced to 60\n\nyears\u2019 imprisonment for murder, a concurrent term of 20 years for armed robbery, and a\n\nconsecutive term of 8 years for attempted armed robbery. On appeal, defendant argues that the\n\nconvictions must be reversed because the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his\n\nrequest for a separate jury verdict form for felony murder. For the reasons that follow, we\n\nmodify defendant\u2019s attempted armed robbery sentence to run concurrently with his other\n\nsentences.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       An indictment charged defendant with four counts of first-degree murder of Tony Colon\n\fNo. 1-04-1946\n\n\n(intentional murder, knowing murder, and two counts of felony murder predicated on armed\n\nrobbery and attempted armed robbery), armed robbery of Chris Callas, and attempted armed\n\nrobbery of Tony Colon.\n\n       The State presented evidence at trial showing that on December 4, 1998, at 11:45 p.m.,\n\nTony Colon was standing outside Pete\u2019s Sidelines Bar talking on his cellular phone when\n\ndefendant grabbed Colon around the neck, pointed his gun at him, and brought him into the bar.\n\nDefendant told everyone to get on the floor and told the bartender, Chris Callas, to open the\n\nregister. Defendant struggled with Colon and attempted to grab his cellular phone, and the phone\n\nfell to the floor. Colon said that defendant was holding a BB gun, not a real gun. Defendant said\n\nthat he would show him it was a real gun and shot Colon in the chest. Defendant proceeded to\n\ntake the money off the bar and left.\n\n       An off-duty police officer was crossing the street toward Pete\u2019s Sidelines when he heard a\n\nloud pop. He saw defendant walk quickly out of the bar while placing a dark object in his\n\nwaistband and get into the driver\u2019s side of a dark, older-model Buick. He followed defendant\n\nand noted the car\u2019s make, model, and license plate number. He also saw that there was someone\n\nsitting in the front passenger side of the car. However, he soon lost sight of the car.\n\n       Michelle Boyd, who was defendant\u2019s girlfriend, testified that defendant and Charles\n\nTaylor left Boyd\u2019s sister\u2019s apartment at 9 p.m. on December 4, 1998, and returned after midnight.\n\nWhen they returned, Boyd asked defendant where he had been, and he replied that he did not\n\nmean to shoot that man. Defendant told her he went to a club armed with a gun and pushed a\n\nman talking on a cellular phone into the lounge. He told everyone to get on the floor and to put\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fNo. 1-04-1946\n\n\ntheir money on the counter. She testified that defendant further told her that a man grabbed him\n\nfrom behind, so defendant hit him over the head with a gun. Defendant said that the man thought\n\nit was a BB gun. Defendant shot the man, then he ran out of the bar. Defendant handed Boyd\n\n$700, which he said he had gotten from the bar, and then took the money back. Boyd testified\n\nthat when she and defendant returned to their own apartment, defendant hid the money and gun.\n\nIn the morning, defendant\u2019s brother told him that his license plates were on television.\n\nDefendant told Boyd he was sorry and asked her to go to his mother\u2019s house with him. There, he\n\ncalled the police and reported his license plates stolen.\n\n         The police arrested defendant when they responded to his report of stolen license plates.\n\nA police detective testified that defendant, after learning that he was positively identified in a\n\nlineup, confessed to the robbery and shooting. Defendant also gave an inculpatory court-reported\n\nstatement to an assistant State\u2019s Attorney. In this statement, he admitted that he intended to rob\n\nsomeone with a gun to make money to buy Christmas presents. He further stated that Colon\n\ncharged defendant during the robbery and that he shot Colon when he started to charge at him\n\nagain.\n\n         In his defense, defendant testified that on December 4, 1998, he and Taylor left in\n\ndefendant\u2019s car to look for Taylor\u2019s girlfriend. Taylor stopped the car and walked across the\n\nstreet, where he approached a man standing outside. When Taylor put his hand on the man\u2019s\n\nneck, defendant assumed that the man was a friend of Taylor\u2019s. The two went inside a bar, and\n\nafter a minute or two, defendant heard a gunshot. Taylor left the bar while placing a gun under\n\nhis shirt and entered the car on the driver\u2019s side. Defendant asked Taylor what was going on, and\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fNo. 1-04-1946\n\n\nhe responded that he had a fight with someone in the bar and shot him. Defendant told Taylor to\n\nget out of his car and to get rid of the gun. Taylor pulled over and told him he would meet him\n\nlater. Defendant proceeded to his girlfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s house, where Taylor later arrived. Taylor\n\ngave defendant money, which defendant gave to his girlfriend.\n\n       Defendant testified that after his arrest, the police hit him, put a gun to his head, and\n\nthreatened to have his child taken away in order to coerce his confession.\n\n       At an informal instructions conference, defendant requested that the trial court give the\n\njury a separate verdict form for felony murder. The trial court stated, \u201cHe is charged with first\n\ndegree murder based upon armed robbery, first degree murder based upon attempted armed\n\nrobbery, first degree murder based on knowing and intentional, so if you want different verdict\n\nforms, you will get all of them, unless the State is nolle-ing [sic] some of the charges. We are not\n\ngoing to separate out some of them and have *** confusion for the jury. You can think about it.\u201d\n\nThe court proceeded to say that the State should \u201chave it prepared correctly, based on what the\n\nIPI says.\u201d The State responded that it might proceed on only felony murder.\n\n       At the formal instructions conference, defense counsel again asked that the murder\n\nverdicts be individualized so that the jury could make specific findings as to each one. He cited\n\nthe importance of knowing what charge the jury finds defendant guilty of because of the different\n\nconsequences flowing from different verdicts. The State responded that giving separate verdict\n\nforms would set a \u201cbad precedent\u201d because of the possibility of inconsistent verdicts. The trial\n\ncourt denied defendant\u2019s request. The jury was therefore given general verdict forms (one guilty\n\nand one not guilty) for first-degree murder, armed robbery, and attempted armed robbery.\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fNo. 1-04-1946\n\n\n       The jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder of Colon, armed robbery of Callas,\n\nand attempted armed robbery of Colon. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for new trial,\n\nwhich included the argument that his request for a separate verdict form for felony murder was\n\nerroneously denied.\n\n       Defendant chose to be sentenced under the sentencing statute in effect when the crime\n\nwas committed rather than under the version in place at the time of sentencing. In 1998, section\n\n5-8-4(a) of the Unified Code of Corrections provided that when multiple sentences are imposed\n\non a defendant at the same time, a court shall not impose consecutive sentences for offenses that\n\nwere committed as part of a single course of conduct during which there was no substantial\n\nchange in the nature of the criminal objective, unless one of the offenses was a Class X or Class\n\n1 felony and the defendant inflicted severe bodily injury during the commission of that felony.\n\nPeople v. Whitney, 188 Ill. 2d 91, 98-99 (1999); 730 ILCS 5/5-8-4(a) (West 1996). The trial\n\ncourt found that the offenses were committed as part of a single course of conduct. It also found\n\nthat the attempted armed robbery charge was mandatorily consecutive because there was severe\n\nbodily injury to Colon, the victim in the attempted armed robbery case. Accordingly, the court\n\nsentenced defendant to 60 years\u2019 imprisonment for the murder, a concurrent term of 20 years for\n\narmed robbery, and a consecutive term of 8 years for attempted armed robbery.\n\n       The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to reconsider his sentence, and this appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                         II. ANALYSIS\n\n       Defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the trial court abused its discretion when it\n\n                                                -5-\n\fNo. 1-04-1946\n\n\ndenied his request for a separate jury verdict form for felony murder. Defendant argues that if the\n\njury had returned a verdict of guilty for the count of felony murder based on the attempted armed\n\nrobbery of Colon, he would not have received a consecutive eight-year sentence because the\n\noffense underlying the felony murder charge would not have supported a separate conviction and\n\nsentence under People v. Coady, 156 Ill. 2d 531, 537 (1993). Neither party cites a case where a\n\ndefendant sought a separate verdict form for felony murder but was denied such a request.\n\nDefendant analogizes these circumstances to the denial of an instruction for lesser-included\n\noffenses, while the State cites cases that are distinguishable. This is an issue of first impression.\n\n       A jury instruction is to \u201cconvey to the minds of the jury the correct principles of law\n\napplicable to the evidence submitted to it.\u201d People v. Harris, No. 98942, slip op. at 33 (February\n\n1, 2007). Further, Supreme Court Rule 451(a) provides that whenever the pattern jury\n\ninstructions 4th contain an instruction applicable in a criminal case and the court determines that\n\nthe jury should be instructed on the subject, the pattern instruction shall be used, unless the court\n\ndetermines that it does not accurately state the law. 210 Ill. 2d 451(a); People v. Harris, slip op.\n\nat 32. An appellate court applies an abuse-of-discretion standard when reviewing a trial court\u2019s\n\ndecisions relating to verdict forms. People v. Roberts, 351 Ill. App. 3d 684, 690 (2004).\n\n       In a criminal trial, a jury is required to return a general verdict as to each offense charged.\n\n725 ILCS 5/115-4(j) (West 2004). Just as an instruction must be given where there is any\n\nevidence that supports a party\u2019s theory of the case, \u201cit is the trial judge\u2019s duty to give *** [a]\n\nverdict form when enough evidence has been presented to \u2018support\u2019 or \u2018warrant\u2019 the giving of\n\nsuch.\u201d People v. Newell, 196 Ill. App. 3d 373, 382 (1990). The State argues on appeal that no\n\n                                                  -6-\n\fNo. 1-04-1946\n\n\nreasonable jury would have found defendant guilty of felony murder but not guilty of both\n\nintentional and knowing murder. However, the State\u2019s position is inconsistent with its own\n\nactions, as it charged defendant with felony murder, argued in closing that he was guilty under\n\nthat theory, and submitted it to the jury. Further, during the informal instruction conference, the\n\nState said that it was considering only proceeding on felony murder. While evidence presented\n\nby the State supported the charge of intentional murder, defendant also cites evidence supporting\n\nthe charge of felony murder. For example, Michelle Boyd testified that shortly after the crime,\n\ndefendant told her that he did not mean to shoot that man, and in his confession, defendant stated\n\nthat he did not go to the tavern to hurt anyone but, rather, that all \u201c[he] wanted was the money.\u201d\n\nIn his confession, he also stated that Colon became aggressive and attempted to grab at the gun,\n\nand defendant told him not to force him to do anything he did not want to do. Therefore,\n\nevidence was presented at trial that defendant shot Colon while attempting to rob him.\n\nDefendant also testified at trial that he waited in his car while Taylor approached a man standing\n\noutside the bar, put his hand on the man\u2019s neck, had a fight with someone in the bar and shot\n\nhim, and left the bar while placing a gun under his shirt.\n\n       Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions, Criminal, No. 26.01 (4th ed. 2000) (hereinafter IPI\n\nCriminal 4th No. 26.01), gives three alternatives for the concluding instruction. The committee\n\ncomment suggests that paragraph [1] be used when there is a single charge and paragraph [2] be\n\nused when multiple offenses are charged. As to paragraph [3], it provides:\n\n                \u201cWhen a defendant is charged in multiple counts with an offense that can\n\n       be charged with different elements, paragraph [3] may be used if the court\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fNo. 1-04-1946\n\n\n       believes its use will assist the jury in deciding the issues. An example would be a\n\n       defendant charged in three separate counts with aggravated battery based on his\n\n       alleged (1) causing great bodily harm, (2) causing bodily harm to a police officer,\n\n       and (3) committing a battery upon a public way. Each of these charges is called\n\n       aggravated battery, but each contains an element that must be proved beyond a\n\n       reasonable doubt that neither of the other charges contains.\u201d IPI Criminal 4th No.\n\n       26.01, Committee Note, at 364.\n\nPreliminarily, the fact that the comments to IPI Criminal 4th No. 26.01 give an option suggests\n\nthat the general verdict form was not intended to be used in every circumstance.\n\n       In addition, here, defendant was charged with four counts of first degree murder based on\n\nthree theories: intentional murder (720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(1) (West 2004)), knowing murder (720\n\nILCS 5/9-1(a)(2) (West 2004)), and felony murder (720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(3) (West 2004)). Each\n\nhas elements that are different from the others. For example, to show intentional murder, the\n\nState must prove that the defendant intended to kill or do bodily harm to the individual or that he\n\nor she knew that such acts would cause the death of the individual. 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(1) (West\n\n2004). To establish knowing murder, the State need not show that the defendant had a specific\n\nintent to kill or do great bodily harm or that the defendant knew that his or her acts would\n\nachieve murderous results. People v. Howery, 178 Ill. 2d 1, 42-43 (1997), citing People v.\n\nBartall, 98 Ill. 2d 294 (1983). The requisite mental state for knowing murder under section 9-\n\n1(a)(2) is knowledge \u201cthat such acts create a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to\n\nthat individual.\u201d 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(2) (West 2004). For felony murder, the State is not required\n\n                                                -8-\n\fNo. 1-04-1946\n\n\nto prove that the defendant could foresee the death or that the defendant committed murder; it\n\nmust merely show that the defendant intended to commit the underlying felony. People v.\n\nCausey, 341 Ill. App. 3d 759, 769 (2003).\n\n       More important, however, a verdict of guilty on felony murder instead of intentional or\n\nknowing murder under these circumstances has vastly different consequences. When a general\n\nverdict of guilty is returned on an indictment that contains several counts arising out of the same\n\ntransaction, such as the four murder counts here, a defendant is considered guilty on each count\n\nto which proof is applicable. People v. Rodriguez, 169 Ill. 2d 183, 190 (1996), citing People v.\n\nScott, 148 Ill. 2d 479 (1992). \u201c[W]here multiple convictions are obtained for offenses arising out\n\nof a single act, sentence is imposed on the most serious offense.\u201d People v. Cardona, 158 Ill. 2d\n\n403, 411 (1994). The most serious of the first-degree murder charges in this case is the one with\n\nthe most culpable mental state: intentional murder. Cardona, 158 Ill. 2d at 412. Accordingly,\n\ndefendant was sentenced to 60 years\u2019 imprisonment on the intentional first-degree murder\n\nconviction and was also sentenced to a concurrent term of 20 years for armed robbery of Callas\n\nand a consecutive term of 8 years for attempted armed robbery of Colon. See 730 ILCS 5/5-8-\n\n4(a) (West 1996).\n\n       However, if defendant had been found guilty of felony murder predicated on attempted\n\narmed robbery and not guilty of both intentional and knowing murder, the resulting sentences\n\nwould have been different. Multiple convictions are improper if they are based on lesser-\n\nincluded offenses. People v. King, 66 Ill. 2d 551, 566 (1977). Because attempted armed robbery\n\nis the underlying felony of one of the felony murder counts, it is a lesser-included offense of\n\n                                                -9-\n\fNo. 1-04-1946\n\n\nfelony murder and cannot support a separate conviction and sentence. Coady, 156 Ill. 2d at 537.\n\nTherefore, if the jury had found defendant guilty of felony murder based on attempted armed\n\nrobbery, defendant could only be sentenced on the felony murder conviction and not on the\n\nlesser-included offense of attempted armed robbery.\n\n        In support of its argument that separate verdict forms were unnecessary, the State relies\n\non the general proposition articulated in People v. Travis, 170 Ill. App. 3d 873 (1988), and\n\nPeople v. Diaz, 244 Ill. App. 3d 268 (1993), that it is sufficient for jurors to unanimously agree\n\non their ultimate conclusion that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged, even if they do\n\nnot agree on the manner in which the crime was committed. These cases are distinguishable,\n\nhowever.\n\n        In People v. Travis, 170 Ill. App. 3d 873 (1988), the court rejected the argument asserted\n\nby the defendant that distinctions among the various ways in which a given charge is brought\n\nwere mandatory. An instruction allowed the defendant to be convicted of murder as a principal\n\nor under an accountability theory based on three different states of mind or by the defendant\u2019s\n\ncommission of one of three felonies. The defendant in Travis argued that, under the instruction,\n\nhe could have been convicted of murder under a general verdict even though the jury may not\n\nhave unanimously agreed as to whether guilt was direct or vicarious, whether defendant or his\n\n\u201cagent\u201d possessed one of the requisite states of mind, or whether the defendant committed one of\n\nthree different felonies.\n\n        The Travis court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument: \u201cthe best rule is that the jury need\n\nonly be unanimous with respect to the ultimate question of defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of the\n\n                                                -10-\n\fNo. 1-04-1946\n\n\ncrime charged, and unanimity is not required concerning alternate ways in which the crime can\n\nbe committed.\u201d Travis, 170 Ill. App. 3d at 890. To hold otherwise, the court held, \u201cwould create\n\nchaos with an already burdened criminal justice system\u201d and would \u201cunnecessarily hobble an\n\nalready staggering court system.\u201d Travis, 170 Ill. App. 3d at 892. It concluded, \u201cAll that is\n\nnecessary is that the jury is unanimous that he is guilty of the offense, regardless of their\n\nagreement on the underlying conduct.\u201d Travis, 170 Ill. App. 3d at 892.\n\n       In People v. Diaz, 244 Ill. App. 3d 268 (1993), the court gave an instruction that the jury\n\ncould convict the defendant of aggravated battery if he either caused great bodily harm to the\n\nvictim or caused bodily harm while using a deadly weapon. The jury was given alternative,\n\ngeneral verdict forms for aggravated battery, one finding him guilty and the other finding him not\n\nguilty. The appellate court discussed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Schad v.\n\nArizona, 501 U.S. 624, 115 L. Ed. 2d 555, 111 S. Ct. 2491 (1991), where a jury convicted the\n\ndefendant of first-degree murder. The prosecutor argued for a first-degree murder conviction\n\nbased on the theories of both felony murder and premeditated murder, and the jury convicted the\n\ndefendant of first-degree murder in a general verdict without indicating on which theory it relied.\n\nA plurality of the Court held that when a single crime can be committed in various ways, jurors\n\nneed not agree on the mode of commission. Schad, 501 U.S. at 631-32, 649, 115 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n565, 577, 111 S. Ct. at 2497, 2506. While some alternative courses of conduct are so different\n\nthat the due process clause prohibits them from being defined as alternative means of committing\n\na single offense, there was nothing unconstitutional about offering a jury premeditated murder\n\nand felony murder as alternative methods of committing first-degree murder. Schad, 501 U.S. at\n\n                                                 -11-\n\fNo. 1-04-1946\n\n\n632-33, 649-50, 115 L. Ed. 2d at 566, 577, 111 S. Ct. at 2497-98, 2506. The Diaz court held,\n\ntherefore, \u201cConstitutional limitations on State instructional combinations, whatever they may be\n\nfollowing Schad, were not crossed in this case.\u201d Diaz, 244 Ill. App. 3d at 273.\n\n       Travis and Diaz are distinguishable. In both Travis and Diaz, unlike here, the verdicts\n\nhad no impact on the defendants\u2019 sentences. In Travis, the defendant\u2019s sentences for murder,\n\nhome invasion, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and burglary were to be served concurrently.\n\nDiaz involved instructions for aggravated battery, and there was no allegation that the sentence\n\nwould change if the trial court had separated the aggravated battery instructions based on which\n\nalternative course of conduct that the defendant committed. Similarly, in Schad, the defendant\n\nwas charged with and convicted of only murder, unlike here, where defendant was also convicted\n\nof the underlying felonies. See also People v. Wilson, 61 Ill. App. 3d 1029, 1033 (1978) (it is not\n\nerror to submit general verdict forms for murder even though a defendant is prosecuted under\n\nmore than one theory). In addition, the defendants in both cases waived their arguments when\n\nthey failed to object at trial and to raise them in their posttrial motions. Travis, 170 Ill. App. 3d\n\nat 889; Diaz, 244 Ill. App. 3d at 270. Finally, both involved jury instructions, not the issue of\n\nwhether the trial court erred by denying requests for a separate verdict form.\n\n       People v. Carney, 317 Ill. App. 3d 806 (2000), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 196 Ill. 2d 518\n\n(2001), ruled on similar facts. In Carney, the defendant was charged with armed robbery and\n\nfirst-degree murder based on the theories of intentional murder, knowing murder, and felony\n\nmurder predicated on armed robbery. The defendant was convicted of murder and armed robbery\n\nand sentenced to consecutive terms of 29 years for murder and 10 years for armed robbery.\n\n                                                 -12-\n\fNo. 1-04-1946\n\n\nWhile the issues instruction defined first-degree murder under any one of four theories, the\n\ngeneral verdict form allowed the jury to find the defendant guilty of first-degree murder without\n\nspecifying the theory upon which they relied. The defendant argued that his attorney\u2019s\n\nperformance was deficient because he failed to tender a separate verdict form for felony murder.\n\nBased on Travis, Diaz, and the comment to IPI Criminal 4th No. 26.01, Carney concluded that\n\ndefense counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient. Carney, 317 Ill. App. 3d at 815. The court\n\ndeclined to address prejudice, the second prong of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,\n\nbecause it already decided to vacate the consecutive sentences on other grounds. Carney, 317 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 815-16; People v. Carney, 327 Ill. App. 3d 998, 1001 (2002).\n\n       While the facts in Carney, 317 Ill. App. 3d 806, are quite similar, its holding rested on\n\ndefense counsel\u2019s failure to tender a separate verdict form, not the trial court\u2019s denial of defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s request. Furthermore, the court decided not to address whether the defendant was\n\nprejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to request a separate verdict form, since it was already\n\nreversing the consecutive sentence on other grounds.\n\n       In support of its argument, the State also cites to the comment to IPI Criminal 4th No.\n\n26.01. It provides, \u201cWhen a defendant is charged in multiple counts that can be charged with\n\ndifferent elements,\u201d the court has the discretion to use different verdict forms if it \u201cbelieves its\n\nuse will assist the jury in deciding the issues. *** The Committee wishes to emphasize that\n\ndistinguishing among the various ways in which a given charge is brought is not required by\n\nlaw.\u201d IPI Criminal 4th No. 26.01, Committee Note, at 364-65. The State argues that defendant\n\nhas not shown how separate verdict forms would assist the jury in deciding the issues. However,\n\n                                                 -13-\n\fNo. 1-04-1946\n\n\nseparate verdict forms could have helped the jury decide the issues of whether defendant was\n\nguilty of intentional, knowing, or felony murder.\n\n       As previously discussed in this opinion, had the jury found defendant guilty of felony\n\nmurder premised on attempted armed robbery and not guilty of both intentional and knowing\n\nmurder, defendant would not have been eligible to be sentenced to a consecutive sentence on the\n\nattempted armed robbery conviction.\n\n       Based on the aforementioned principles, we hold that when a defendant who is charged\n\nwith intentional or knowing murder and felony murder requests a separate verdict form for felony\n\nmurder and such a request has a basis in the evidence presented at trial, the separate verdict form\n\nmust be given or consecutive sentences cannot be imposed based on the offense underlying the\n\nfelony murder, pursuant to section 5-8-4(a) of the Unified Code of Corrections (730 ILCS 5/5-8-\n\n4(a) (West 2004)).\n\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\n\n       It is difficult to find fault with a learned trial judge, especially one whose apparent motive\n\nwas not to confuse the jury. However, in this case, where the decision not to give the separate\n\nverdict form may have added eight years to defendant\u2019s sentence, we find that the error\n\nnecessitates a modification of defendant\u2019s sentence. As a result of the trial court\u2019s failure to\n\ntender the requested verdict form in the instant case, we modify defendant\u2019s consecutive eight-\n\nyear sentence for attempted armed robbery to run concurrently with his sentences for first-degree\n\nmurder and armed robbery. 134 Ill. 2d R. 615(b)(4).\n\n       Affirmed; sentence modified.\n\n                                                -14-\n\fNo. 1-04-1946\n\n\n      QUINN, P.J., and NEVILLE, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\f",
