Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 21.11(a), 22.021(a) (Vernon Supp. 2009); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(a), (c) (Vernon 2006). \u00a0We reverse and remand.\n\nBackground Facts\n\nIn May 2006, a Tarrant County grand jury indicted Cardenas for three counts of aggravated sexual assault and one count of indecency with a child. The charges involved Cardenas\u2019s sexual contact with a four-year-old girl.\u00a0\u00a0Before his trial, Cardenas swore that he had not been previously convicted of a felony and asked the trial court to submit his request for a probated sentence to the jury.\n\nCardenas\u2019s trial proceedings started with his pleas of not guilty, and then the trial court instructed an almost 100-member jury panel about voir dire and other issues. \u00a0The court informed the panel that if it convicted Cardenas, it could assess punishment at a minimum of five years\u2019 confinement for the aggravated sexual assault charges and two years\u2019 confinement for the indecency with a child charge and that it could probate his sentence if he proved that he had not been previously convicted of a felony. \u00a0It then told the panel that although jurors do not have to \u201cleave [their] common sense at the courthouse steps,\u201d they must be free from prejudice or bias.\n\nAfter the parties presented evidence on Cardenas\u2019s guilt and innocence and his punishment, the jury convicted him of two counts of aggravated sexual assault and one count of indecency with a child,\n(footnote: 1) and it assessed twenty years\u2019 confinement on each charge. \u00a0Cardenas filed his notice of appeal.\n\nThe Trial Court\u2019s Denial of Cardenas\u2019s Challenges for Cause\n\nIn thirty connected issues that he has briefed together, Cardenas asserts that the trial court erred by denying his challenges for cause to thirty members of the jury panel because they indicated that they could not consider the full range of punishment for his charges. \u00a0\n\nStandard of review\n\nWe review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a challenge for cause with considerable deference because the trial court is in the best position to evaluate the veniremember\u2019s demeanor and responses. \n Newbury v. State\n, 135 S.W.3d 22, 32 (Tex.Crim.App.), \ncert. denied\n, 543 U.S. 990 (2004); \nTucker v. State\n, 183 S.W.3d 501, 511 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2005, no pet.). \u00a0We reverse a trial court\u2019s ruling on a challenge for cause only upon a clear abuse of discretion.\n Newbury\n, 135 S.W.3d at 32; \nCurry v. State\n, 910 S.W.2d 490, 493 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995); \nTucker\n, 183 S.W.3d at 511. \u00a0In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, we review the total voir dire record in context. \u00a0\nSee Mathis v. State\n, 67 S.W.3d 918, 924 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002);\n King v. State\n, 29 S.W.3d 556, 568 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000); \nEmenhiser v. State\n, 196 S.W.3d 915, 927 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2006, pet. ref\u2019d).\n\nApplicable law\n\n\u201cA challenge for cause is an objection made to a particular juror, alleging some fact which renders the juror incapable or unfit to serve on the jury.\u201d Tex.\u00a0Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(a). \n A challenge for cause may be made by the defendant when a juror \u201chas a bias or prejudice against any of the law applicable to the case upon which the [defendant] is entitled to rely, either as a defense to some phase of the offense for which the defendant is being prosecuted or as a mitigation thereof or of the punishment therefor.\u201d \u00a0\nId.\n art. 35.16(c)(2); \nsee Sadler v. State\n,\n \n977 S.W.2d 140, 142 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998) (stating that bias against the law exists when a juror\u2019s beliefs \u201cwould prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties\u201d);\n Garcia v. State\n, 887 S.W.2d 846, 857 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994), \ncert. denied\n, 514 U.S. 1005 (1995). \n\nThe burden is on the proponent of the challenge for cause to establish that the challenge is proper. \u00a0\nFeldman v. State\n, 71 S.W.3d 738, 747 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). \u00a0This burden is not met until the proponent has demonstrated that the panel member understood the requirements of the law and was not able to overcome his prejudice well enough to follow them. \n Id. \nIn\u00a0other words, \u201c[b]efore a prospective juror can be excused for cause . . . the law must be explained to him and he must be asked whether he can follow that law regardless of his personal views.\u201d \u00a0\nId.\n at 744; \nJones v. State\n, 982 S.W.2d 386, 390 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998), \ncert. denied\n, 528 U.S. 985 (1999); \nCurtis v. State\n, 205 S.W.3d 656, 659 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2006, pet. ref\u2019d). The\u00a0defendant\u2019s right to an unbiased jury is both statutory and constitutional in nature. \u00a0\nSee State v. Morales\n, 253 S.W.3d 686, 694 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008).\n\nA juror must be able to consider the full range of punishment for an offense, and a defendant\u2019s voir dire question about a juror\u2019s ability to do so is generally proper. \u00a0\nStandefer v. State\n, 59 S.W.3d 177, 181 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001); \nBanda v. State\n, 890 S.W.2d 42, 55 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994), \ncert. denied\n, 515 U.S. 1105 (1995); \nsee\n Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. \nart. 35.16(c)(2). \u00a0If\u00a0a juror cannot consider an offense\u2019s full range of punishment, the juror is challengeable for cause. \u00a0\nStandefer\n, 59 S.W.3d at 181; \nsee Banda\n, 890 S.W.2d at 55 (explaining that a \u201cperson who testifies unequivocally that he could not consider the minimum sentence as a proper punishment for [an] offense . . . is properly the subject of a challenge for cause\u201d); \nPierce v. State\n, 696 S.W.2d 899, 902\u201303 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985) (holding that the trial court erroneously denied the defendant\u2019s challenge for cause when a panel member said that he could not consider granting probation in a murder case);\n Von Byrd v. State\n, 569 S.W.2d 883, 891 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978), \ncert. denied\n, 441 U.S. 967 (1979).\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe State discussed range of punishment issues with the jury panel during the voir dire process. \u00a0For example, the State\u2019s prosecutor extensively explained to the jury their duty to consider the full range of punishment without assuming any particular factual circumstances and regardless of their personal views by stating, \t\n\nIt\u2019s a first-degree felony, a minimum of five years all the way up to 99 years or life. \u00a0Remember, you don\u2019t know what the facts are yet. \u00a0You know what the elements are. . . . \u00a0That\u2019s why the legislature gives you a big range of punishment. \u00a0You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be yet. \u00a0Okay? \u00a0You don\u2019t know. . . .\n\n\n\n. . . .\n\n\n\nNow, you guys have not heard any facts yet. \u00a0Okay? \u00a0And in the same manner that you have to keep an open mind to whatever the evidence may be and wait to make your decision as to whether or not someone is guilty, it\u2019s the same thing for punishment. \u00a0You don\u2019t know what the rest of the story is. \u00a0You have to wait. . . . \u00a0To sit on a jury, this is what\u2019s required: \u00a0At this point without having heard anything, you have to be able to keep an open mind. You have to be able to consider the full range of punishment.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Just say you know what, I don\u2019t know; I\u2019m going to wait. \u00a0I\u2019m going to wait to hear what it actually is. . . . \u00a0And that\u2019s the word we need from you now. \u00a0And if you can\u2019t give me that word, then I need to know about it. \u00a0We both need to know about it.\n\n\n\n. . . .\n\n\n\n. . . \u00a0I need to make sure that you can be fair. \u00a0And not having heard any evidence, just wait until you hear any evidence, so that, you know, you can decide what\u2019s appropriate. \u00a0And all we\u2019re asking here is can you consider the full range of punishment. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t even mean you have to give it.\n\n\n\n. . . .\n\n\n\n. . . \u00a0You don\u2019t have to give it. \u00a0You have to consider it. . . .\n\n\n\n. . . .\n\n\n\n. . . \u00a0[Y]ou are not supposed to come into this jury box with any thoughts ahead of time as to whether or not the defendant is guilty or what the facts are. \u00a0We know what the law is at this point and what he has been accused of. \u00a0And you guys are going to have to say, I am going to wait to hear the evidence. \u00a0Okay? \u00a0I have to wait to hear the evidence.\n\n\n\n. . . \u00a0[A]t this point in time, since you haven\u2019t heard anything, you have to be able to consider the full range.\n\n\n\n. . . .\n\n\n\n. . . \u00a0I am just telling you what the law says. \u00a0It says for you to be on a jury, to sit here and to make a decision . . ., you have to be able to consider the full range. . . .[\n(footnote: 2)]\n\n\n\nThen, during part of his own voir dire examination, Cardenas\u2019s counsel said to the jury,\n\n\n\nAll right. \u00a0Aggravated sexual assault of a child. \u00a0Five to 99 years or life, up to a $10,000 fine, possibility of probation, if you decide deserving and sentence to under ten years.[\n(footnote: 3)] \u00a0And we all agree that there\u2019s different punishment areas for different offenses, right? \u00a0Speeding ticket going two miles an hour over the speed limit shouldn\u2019t be fined as much as somebody going 30 miles an hour; is that a fair statement? \u00a0I\u2019m not saying that this is equivalent to a speeding ticket. \u00a0But there are different punishments. \u00a0And there is a big range of punishments. \u00a0All right.\n\n\n\nI want you to assume something. \u00a0I want you to assume that you are sitting on a jury, okay? \u00a0I want you to assume that you have found somebody guilty of sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault of a child. \u00a0They intentionally or knowingly caused the penetration of the sexual organ of the complaining witness, of the victim, by the means of the sexual organ or any other or with a finger or with touching genital to genital. \u00a0I want you to assume that there is no reasonable doubt, that you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the \u00a0person is guilty. \u00a0Okay? \u00a0I want you to assume that it\u2019s a unanimous decision amongst the 12 of you, that all of you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty. Not consensual; it was an intentional and knowing assault.[\n(footnote: 4)] Intentional and knowing basically means wanting to do it; he meant to do it. \u00a0This is the question: \u00a0Could you honestly ever fairly consider on an aggravated sexual assault of a child as little as five years in prison and give probation as an appropriate punishment[?] \n\n\n\nFifty-two members of the jury panel answered the question negatively. \u00a0Nobody asked those jurors to clarify or reweigh their negative answers to the question. After voir dire concluded, as the trial court asked whether the parties had challenges for cause to each remaining potential juror, the following exchange occurred:\n\nTHE COURT: \u00a0[Panel member] No. 6?\n\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: \u00a0Range of punishment.\n\n[STATE]: \u00a0Judge, we would object to that. \u00a0Counsel asked the wrong question, is the bottom line. \u00a0And frankly, to make it easier, I assume he will challenge for cause numerous other jurors. There\u2019s some that we would agree to, but for the most part, he asked the wrong question, and that\u2019s the bottom line. \u00a0His question very specifically was, \u201cCan you honestly ever fairly consider as little as five years in prison and give probation as an appropriate punishment,\u201d and that\u2019s not what the law provides. \u00a0And frankly, I think this court has been present in other jury selections where Defense counsel asked the wrong question. \u00a0And the real question that is supported by case law is if the facts justify it and the law allows it, can you consider it. \u00a0And counsel very specifically asked him to entertain a hypothetical and to imagine factual circumstances where they could give that, and that\u2019s inappropriate. \u00a0It\u2019s the wrong question. \u00a0And we would agree to [some challenges, but] [e]veryone else challenged under that question, we would object to.\n\n\n\nCardenas\u2019s thirty issues relate to the thirty jury panel members whom he similarly challenged under \u201crange of punishment\u201d and whom the trial court did not release from the jury list by either granting that challenge or otherwise excusing the jurors through the State\u2019s agreement or on other challengeable grounds. \u00a0Those panel members\u2019 negative responses to Cardenas\u2019s question show that they could not follow the law by considering the minimum punishment and that they were therefore challengeable for cause. \u00a0\nSee\n \nStandefer\n, 59 S.W.3d at 181;\n Banda\n, 890 S.W.2d at 55; \nsee also Faulder v. State\n, 745 S.W.2d 327, 339 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987)\n (explaining that it is \u201caxiomatic that a prospective juror who states that he cannot consider [the full range of punishment] is subject to challenge for cause\u201d) (citation omitted); \nVon Byrd\n, 569 S.W.2d at 891 (stating that it is \u201cwell established that the [defendant] has a right to challenge for cause any juror who could not give the minimum punishment\u201d).\n\nHowever, in its first response to Cardenas\u2019s issue, the State argues that he did not preserve error. \u00a0To preserve error on his challenges for cause, Cardenas had to (1) assert a clear and specific challenge for cause, (2) use a peremptory challenge on the complained-of veniremember, (3) exhaust all of his peremptory challenges, (4) request and be denied additional peremptory challenges, and (5) be forced to accept an objectionable juror on the jury. \u00a0\nFeldman\n, 71 S.W.3d at 744; \nGreen v. State\n, 934 S.W.2d 92, 105 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996), \ncert. denied\n, 520 U.S. 1200 (1997). \u00a0Cardenas did all of these things; the State has not argued otherwise.\n\nNonetheless, the State argues that Cardenas still did not preserve error because he did not ensure that the jury panel understood the law\u2019s requirements and could not overcome their prejudice well enough to follow them. \u00a0But leading up to his question, as indicated above, Cardenas\u2019s counsel did explain the law on punishment to the panel. \u00a0And, as the State argues, although Cardenas\u2019s counsel did not follow up with additional questions to the jurors individually about overcoming their respective prejudices after they unequivocally indicated that they could not consider giving a person convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child the minimum statutory punishment, including probation, we hold that under the limited circumstances of this case, such a follow-up question was not required. \u00a0The jury had previously been repeatedly informed by the trial court and the State that a jury must act without prejudice and that the law commands that they consider the minimum punishment regardless of their personal views, and in that context, the panel members\u2019 answers to the question at issue demonstrated that they could not do so.\n(footnote: 5)\n\tSecondly, the State asserts that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Cardenas\u2019s challenges because his counsel\u2019s question sought an improper commitment\n from the panel members. \u00a0The State contends that the question failed the first and third parts of the test for valid commitment questions as set forth in \nStandefer.\n\nThe determination of whether a question is a proper commitment question is a three-part test: \u00a0(1) is the question a commitment question; (2)\u00a0could a possible answer to the question produce a valid challenge for cause because it would show that a juror would not follow the law; and (3) does the question only contain the facts required to make such a challenge.\n \u00a0See Tijerina v. State\n, 202 S.W.3d 299, 302 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2006, pet. ref\u2019d) (op. on reh\u2019g). A question is a commitment question\u2014although not necessarily an \nimproper \ncommitment question\u2014when it commits a prospective juror to resolve, or refrain from resolving, an issue in a certain way after learning a particular fact. \u00a0\nSee\u00a0Standefer\n, 59 S.W.3d at 179\u201380; \nLydia v. State\n, 117 S.W.3d 902, 905 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2003, pet. ref\u2019d) (op. on remand). \u00a0Counsel may ask prospective jurors whether they can follow the law when it requires a certain type of commitment from jurors and when the question states only the facts required to establish a challenge for cause; however, when \u201cthe law does not require the commitment, a commitment question is invariably improper.\u201d \u00a0\nStandefer\n, 59 S.W.3d at 181; \nsee Lydia\n,\n \n117 S.W.3d at 905.\t\n\nAs we have explained, the law requires potential jurors to consider the full range of punishment; thus, although Cardenas\u2019s counsel\u2019s question connected hypothetical facts (the jury\u2019s finding of guilt for aggravated sexual assault of a child) to the resolution of a legal issue (consideration of the minimum punishment), the question was not improper on the first part of the commitment question test. \u00a0\nSee Standefer\n, 59 S.W.3d at 181 (stating that \u201cquestions concerning a juror\u2019s ability to consider the full range of punishment for a particular offense meet the . . . definition of commitment questions but are nevertheless proper\u201d); \nRivera v. State\n, 82 S.W.3d 64, 66 n.2 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 2002, pet. ref\u2019d).\n\nThe State has also argued on the final page of its brief and during oral argument that the question fails the third part of the \nStandefer \ntest\u2014which requires the question to include only the facts necessary for a challenge for cause\u2014because it allegedly \u201ccontained the approximate age of the victim, the type of assault, and the manner and means of the actual assault.\u201d\n(footnote: 6) \u00a0But the State has not explained how the lead-in to Cardenas\u2019s counsel\u2019s question\n(footnote: 7) about the offense\u2019s alleged \u201cmanner and means\u201d (presumably the part of the question that hypothesized that the jury had found someone guilty of penetrating the sexual organ of the complaining witness \u201cby the means of the sexual organ or any other or with a finger or with touching genital to genital\u201d) affected the veniremembers\u2019 responsibility in this particular case to consider the entire range of punishment for the offenses. \u00a0The alleged \u201cmanner and means\u201d described by Cardenas\u2019s counsel directly corresponds with the indictment\u2019s allegations.\n \u00a0See Barajas v. State\n, 93 S.W.3d 36, 38 n.1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (stating that under \nStandefer\n, \u201cparties may not ask whether venire members can consider probation under the particular facts of the case beyond the offense as charged in the indictment\u201d). \u00a0\n\nAlso, the State\u2019s indictment \ndid not \naver that Cardenas\u2019s alleged contact with the victim\u2019s sexual organ with either his finger or with his own sexual organ were different \nmanners and means \nof committing one offense at all; rather, the State alleged that Cardenas\u2019s alleged contact with the victim in these ways comprised \nindependent offenses\n for which the State sought separate convictions. \u00a0\nSee\n Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.021(a)(1)(B)(i), (a)(1)(B)(iii) (stating that a person commits aggravated sexual assault of a child if the person \u201ccauses the penetration of the anus or sexual organ of a child by any means\u201d \nor if the person \n\u201ccauses the sexual organ of a child to contact or penetrate the mouth, anus, or sexual organ of another person, including the actor\u201d);\n Vick v. State\n, 991 S.W.2d 830, 833 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (holding that the various methods of contact described by section 22.021(a)(1)(B) comprise \u201cdistinct statutory offense[s]\u201d for which multiple convictions may be obtained); \nMcGlothlin v. State\n, 260 S.W.3d 124, 126\u201329 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2008, pet. ref\u2019d). \u00a0Thus, Cardenas\u2019s counsel\u2019s question can be read as properly asking the jury whether they could consider the minimum punishment upon conviction of two of the \nspecific crimes \n(beyond generally referencing aggravated sexual assault of a child)\u2014not the specific \nmanners and means\n of those crimes\u2014that were contained in the indictment. \u00a0In other words, the question did not give unnecessary, additional details about Cardenas\u2019s charges; the question simply described the core elements of the charges. \u00a0Therefore, we hold that under the facts of this case, the specification of the methods of sexual contact in Cardenas\u2019s counsel\u2019s question did not negate the potency of the question to establish that the veniremembers could not follow the law on punishment and were therefore challengeable for cause.\n(footnote: 8)\n\tFor all of these reasons, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion by denying Cardenas\u2019s challenges for cause to jurors who unequivocally stated that they could not consider the full range of punishment for Cardenas\u2019s charges. \u00a0\nSee Newbury\n, 135 S.W.3d at 32; \nStandefer\n, 59 S.W.3d at 181;\n Banda\n, 890 S.W.2d at 55. \u00a0Specifically, we sustain Cardenas\u2019s second issue, regarding the denial of his challenge for cause to juror number 28. \u00a0Cardenas was harmed because of the denial as to juror number 28 because he (1) used a peremptory strike to remove juror number 28, (2) exhausted his peremptory strikes, (3) requested and was denied additional peremptory strikes, and (4)\u00a0identified three specific objectionable veniremembers who sat on the jury and on whom he would have exercised peremptory strikes.\n(footnote: 9) \u00a0\nSee\n\u00a0\nJohnson v. State\n, 43 S.W.3d 1, 7 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001) (holding that harm for a denial of a challenge to cause, which is based under the nonconstitutional error standard of rule of appellate procedure 44.2(b), requires these four elements); \nsee also Busby v. State\n, 253 S.W.3d 661, 670 (Tex. Crim. App.), \ncert. denied\n, 129 S. Ct. 625 (2008). \u00a0Because we sustain his second issue, we decline to specifically address his other twenty-nine issues. \u00a0\nSee\n Tex. R. App. P. 47.1.\n\nConclusion\n\nHaving sustained Cardenas\u2019s second issue, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment convicting Cardenas of counts one, two, and four of the State\u2019s indictment, and we remand this case to the trial court for a new trial to decide his guilt and his punishment on those three counts. \u00a0\nSee\n Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.29(a) (Vernon Supp. 2009); \nJohnson\n, 43 S.W.3d at 7; \nCarson v. State\n, 6 S.W.3d 536, 539 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).\n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nTERRIE LIVINGSTON\n\nJUSTICE\n\n\n\nPANEL: \u00a0CAYCE, C.J.; LIVINGSTON and WALKER, JJ.\n\n\n\nCAYCE, C.J. dissents without opinion. \n\n\n\nPUBLISH\n\n\n\nDELIVERED: \u00a0November 25, 2009\n\nFOOTNOTES\n1:The trial court granted Cardenas\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of not guilty on one of the aggravated sexual assault counts.\n\n\n2:In relation to the jury\u2019s role in assessing punishment, the prosecutor had also previously said, \u201cThe jury must base their verdict on the evidence heard in the courtroom, okay? \u00a0And not on your personal experience. . . . \u00a0People with strong feelings are not automatically disqualified. . . . \u00a0However, you can be disqualified if you have already made up your minds about this case without hearing and considering the evidence.\u201d\n\n\n3:This was the correct punishment range for aggravated sexual assault under the facts of this case at the time of Cardenas\u2019s alleged criminal act in 2005. \u00a0\nSee\n\u00a0Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 12.32, 22.021(e) (Vernon Supp. 2009). For\u00a0offenses committed on or after September 1, 2007, the minimum term of confinement for aggravated sexual assault of a child younger than six years old is twenty-five years. \u00a0Act of May 18, 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., ch. 593, \u00a7 1.18, 2007 Tex. Gen. Laws 1120, 1128 (current version at \nTex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.021(f)). \u00a0Also, for offenses committed on or after September 1, 2007, a jury may not recommend probation in an aggravated sexual assault case when the victim is younger than fourteen years old. \u00a0Act of May 18, 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., ch. 593, \u00a7 1.06, 2007 Tex. Gen. Laws 1120, 1123 (current version at Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12 \u00a7 (4)(d)(5) (Vernon Supp. 2009)). \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n4:Cardenas\u2019s counsel tracked the language of the statute in his question for aggravated sexual assault regarding the defendant\u2019s intentional or knowing state of mind. \u00a0\nSee\n Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.021(a)(1)(B).\n\n\n5:At oral argument, the State relied on the court of criminal appeals\u2019s \nJones \ndecision to propose that Cardenas\u2019s counsel was required to follow up with each of the panel members who answered his question negatively. However, we cannot find any language in the \nJones\n opinion that requires further questioning under the circumstances at issue here. \u00a0\nSee Jones\n, 982 S.W.2d at 388\u201390. \n\n\n6:The question quoted above does not state the age of the victim beyond the question\u2019s language that the charge involved a child. \n\n\n7:The question was asked by Cardenas\u2019s counsel and answered by the panel members without any objection by the State regarding an allegation that it required an improper commitment or was improper on any other basis.\n\n\n8:We note that the State\u2019s prosecutor also discussed particular methods of sexual contact during his questioning on the range of punishment for Cardenas\u2019s offenses.\n\n\n9:Specifically, Cardenas asserted that he would have struck three panel members who served on the jury because a mother of one of the jurors was a child abuse victim, another juror is an elementary school teacher, and the third juror is a nurse and has \u201cexperience in different things that makes her undesirable.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n",
