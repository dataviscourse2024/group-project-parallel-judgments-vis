Code,1 \u00a7 187, subd. (a)) and\nshooting at an occupied vehicle (\u00a7 246) with true findings on\nfirearm enhancement allegations (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (b)-(d)).\nOn appeal, Cruz contends the trial court erred in failing to\ninstruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter under a heat of\npassion theory. Cruz also claims the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in imposing a firearm enhancement on the murder\ncount under section 12022.53, subdivision (d) rather than a\nlesser-included enhancement under subdivision (b) or (c). We\nmodify the judgment to accurately reflect Cruz\u2019s actual custody\ncredits, but otherwise affirm.\n\n      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       Cruz\u2019s Prior Relationship with the Victim\n       The victim in this case was Arturo Villanueva San Vicente.\nCruz and Villanueva became friends after working together at a\ncar wash. While hanging out with Cruz, Villanueva met Cruz\u2019s\nwife, Jennifer Perez, and they also became friends. At some\npoint, Villanueva began suggesting to Perez that Cruz was\ncheating on her. Perez initially did not believe him. However, in\nApril 2017, Perez became upset at Cruz because he was flirting\nwith a friend that Perez had invited to their home. When Cruz\nleft with Perez\u2019s friend and did not return home until later that\nnight, Perez believed he was having an affair.\n       On April 8, 2017, Perez began a four-month affair with\nVillanueva as revenge against Cruz. On the day the affair\n\n\n     1   All further statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n\n\n\n                                  2\n\fstarted, Villanueva posted on his Instagram account a picture of\na hand holding a gun with the statement \u201c[a] short one for the\nones I\u2019m against.\u201d The post included the hashtag \u201cJuanito,\u201d\nwhich was Cruz\u2019s nickname. When Villanueva showed the post\nto Perez, he said he wanted to prove he was not afraid of Cruz\nand to see if Cruz would confront him. Villanueva\u2019s Facebook\nprofile also had a picture of him with a rifle.\n       According to Perez, Villanueva became obsessed with her\nover the course of their affair. He repeatedly asked her to leave\nCruz and run away with him to Mexico. He began checking\nCruz\u2019s location on social media platforms, and he once showed up\nat Perez\u2019s home when he thought Cruz was not there. Although\nPerez told him to leave, Villanueva refused and said he would\n\u201cstart doing drama\u201d if she did not come outside. He also said he\nwas not afraid of Cruz and would not mind facing him if Cruz\ncame home. On another occasion, Villanueva told Perez, \u201c[I]f you\ndon\u2019t leave with me in a good way, you\u2019re going to leave with me\nin a bad way.\u201d He then slashed Perez\u2019s bedroom window screen.\n       Starting in July 2017, Villanueva began making threats\nto Perez about killing Cruz. He told Perez he would \u201cget rid of\u201d\nCruz because \u201cthat\u2019s what it was going to take\u201d for her to leave\nhim. He also said he would get a gun from his friend, Jonathan\nCastro, who was in a gang and was willing to help him kill Cruz.\nVillanueva told Perez \u201call it takes is one,\u201d which she understood\nto mean \u201cone gunshot to remove\u201d Cruz. By early August, Perez\nwas fearful because Villanueva was talking more about killing\nCruz and leaving with Perez to Mexico. Villanueva made clear to\nPerez that he was willing to get rid of Cruz so that they could\nbe together, and he was angry when Perez refused to leave her\nhusband for him.\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\f       Perez told her friend, Estefany Merino, about her affair\nwith Villanueva. On a few occasions, Perez also asked Merino to\naccompany her on dates with Villanueva so that Merino could act\nas a cover for Perez in case anyone she knew saw them together.\nAlthough Perez told Merino that Villanueva had twice threatened\nto \u201ckill or get rid\u201d of Cruz, Merino did not consider the threats to\nbe \u201ctoo serious.\u201d On one occasion, Villanueva called Merino and\ntold her he wanted Perez to run away with him, and he wanted to\nget a gun from his friend so that he could get rid of Cruz. In\nresponse, Merino warned Villanueva \u201cnot to do anything crazy,\u201d\nand to leave Perez alone because she would \u201cnever leave her\nfamily.\u201d The last time Merino went out with Perez and\nVillanueva, she heard Villanueva tell Perez that she needed to\nleave Cruz and that he would kill him. At that point, Merino\nadvised Perez that she should stop seeing Villanueva.\n       On August 4, 2017, Perez ended the affair with Villanueva\nbecause of his escalating threats and other behavior. On\nOctober 5, Villanueva changed his Facebook profile to a picture of\nhim holding a rifle with the statement: \u201cI went out with God. If I\ndon\u2019t come back, it\u2019s because I left with him.\u201d The profile picture\nalso showed a girl next to a truck stating \u201cfuck your Ford.\u201d Perez\nbelieved Villanueva intended the picture to \u201ctrigger\u201d Cruz, who\ndrove a Ford Explorer at the time.\n       On November 13, 2017, Perez disclosed the affair to Cruz.\nAccording to Perez, she confessed to Cruz because Villanueva\u2019s\nthreats had \u201cstarted getting more intense.\u201d Cruz initially was\ncalm, but became angry at both Perez and Villanueva as Perez\ndisclosed the details of the affair. When Cruz asked Perez why\nshe decided to tell him at that time, Perez said that Villanueva\nwas making threats against him. In describing the threats to\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\fCruz, Perez said Villanueva and Castro were setting Cruz up to\nkill him, and Villanueva claimed he could get a gun from Castro\nto use against Cruz. She also told Cruz that Villanueva\nrepeatedly said he was going to kill Cruz and had slashed their\nbedroom window screen. After Perez told Cruz about the affair,\nhe was so angry that he did not want to see or talk to her. Cruz\nwas also worried about the threats and feared for his life and the\nlives of their young children, who might be with Cruz if he were\nattacked. Perez believed Cruz stayed upset over the next several\ndays and did not calm down.\n\n      Cruz Fatally Shoots Villanueva in His Vehicle\n      On the night of November 18, 2017, five days after\nPerez disclosed the affair, Cruz fatally shot Villanueva while\nVillanueva was sitting inside his vehicle. Earlier that evening,\nVillanueva had been with his good friend, Castro, a self-admitted\ngang member.2 As Villanueva was driving Castro home, he\nmentioned he had dropped a container of medical marijuana\ninside his vehicle. When they arrived at the apartment complex\nwhere Castro resided, they recognized Cruz\u2019s truck parked in the\ndriveway. Villanueva parked his vehicle along the street.\nVillanueva told Castro he was going to look for the container\nof marijuana he had dropped while driving. As Castro was\nleaving the vehicle, Villanueva remained in the driver\u2019s seat. He\nwas turned toward his right, looking in the center console area.\n\n\n\n\n      2According to Castro, Villanueva had asked Castro to get\nhim a gun because he was afraid of Cruz. Castro did not own or\npossess a gun and did not obtain one for Villanueva.\n\n\n\n\n                                5\n\f      Castro stopped on the sidewalk to talk to a neighbor. While\nthe men were having a conversation, Cruz walked past them\nbetween two parked trucks. Cruz did not say anything to the\nmen, and instead continued walking toward the driver\u2019s side of\nVillanueva\u2019s vehicle. Castro saw Cruz open the driver\u2019s door and\nquickly fire multiple shots at Villanueva with a gun. Cruz then\nclosed the door, walked toward the back of the vehicle, and made\neye contact with Castro. Cruz\u2019s face showed panic, shock, and\nhorror, but he did not speak.\n      Fearing for his life, Castro ran inside his apartment.\nHe told his girlfriend, Guadalupe Flores, that something had\nhappened to Villanueva and asked her to check on him. As\nFlores walked outside, she saw Cruz get in his truck and drive\naway. Flores approached Villanueva\u2019s vehicle and opened the\npassenger door. Villanueva was slouched over the center console\nbetween the driver\u2019s and passenger seats. His knees were on the\ndriver\u2019s seat and his body was turned toward the back of the\nvehicle. After calling 911, Flores opened the driver\u2019s door so that\nshe could render aid to Villanueva. At that time, Castro came\nback outside and helped Flores pull Villanueva out of the vehicle\nand onto the ground. Responding paramedics were unable to\nrevive Villanueva at the scene.\n      Villanueva died from multiple gunshot wounds. He\nsustained six gunshot wounds, four of which were fatal. The\npathway of each of the bullets was back to front, right to left,\nand downward in the victim. The four fatal wounds were caused\nby bullets entering the back or right side of the body and exiting\nthe front or left side. The two nonfatal wounds were due to\nbullets entering and exiting the back and right arm.\n\n\n\n\n                                6\n\f      Surveillance video from an apartment building across the\nstreet did not capture the actual shooting. However, it showed\nthat, prior to the shooting, Villanueva\u2019s vehicle slowed down as it\npassed in front of Cruz\u2019s parked truck. A short time later, two\nfigures walked in succession from Cruz\u2019s truck in the direction\nwhere Villanueva had parked his vehicle. After some time, one\nfigure ran back to Cruz\u2019s truck followed by a second figure who\nwalked back to the truck. A third figure, who appeared to be\nCastro, then walked toward the gate of the apartment complex.\nNo weapon was found inside Villanueva\u2019s vehicle.\n\n       Cruz\u2019s Statement to the Police\n       On November 30, 2017, Cruz was arrested. In a recorded\ninterview with the police, Cruz initially denied he was present at\nthe shooting. When told he was captured on video at the scene\nof the shooting, Cruz admitted that he and a friend named Lalo\nwere standing nearby and heard gunshots, but denied he was\ninvolved. Later in the interview, Cruz admitted that he shot\nVillanueva. Cruz said he was high on drugs and felt his life was\nin danger because he had been told Villanueva wanted to kill\nhim. Cruz also said he felt threatened by Villanueva and \u201c[j]ust\nsnapped.\u201d As described by Cruz, he went to the apartment\ncomplex to visit a friend and \u201c[p]anicked\u201d when he saw\nVillanueva pull up in his vehicle. Because Villanueva stayed\ninside the vehicle, Cruz began to think Villanueva was going to\nshoot him so he \u201chad to do what [he] had to do, before [he was]\nkilled.\u201d Cruz did not say anything to Villanueva. He \u201c[j]ust\nwalked up and shot him.\u201d Cruz then panicked and left in his\ntruck. He later got rid of the gun by tossing it into a lagoon.\n\n\n\n\n                                 7\n\f       Cruz\u2019s Trial Testimony\n       Cruz testified on his own behalf at trial. According to his\ntestimony, Cruz was 28 years old at the time of trial, was married\nto Perez, and had three young children with her. He did not have\nany prior misdemeanor or felony convictions. As of 2017, Cruz\nhad known Villanueva for about five years and considered him to\nbe a good friend. In April 2017, however, Villanueva suddenly\nstopped talking to him. In July, Cruz saw Villanueva\u2019s\nInstagram post showing the picture of a gun with the hashtag\n\u201cJuanito.\u201d Although Cruz wondered about the meaning of the\npost, he did not perceive it as a threat at that time. In July, Cruz\nleft his job at the car wash and began working in a bakery. After\nchanging jobs, Cruz did not have any contact with Villanueva\nuntil the shooting.\n       In November 2017, about five days before the shooting,\nPerez told Cruz she had an affair with Villanueva, and\nVillanueva was making threats against his life. Cruz initially\nwas shocked, but when Perez disclosed details of the affair, he\nunderstood why Villanueva had stopped talking to him. Cruz\nalso understood the meaning of Villanueva\u2019s social media post\nwhen Perez disclosed that Villanueva wanted to kill Cruz and\nwanted Perez to run away with him. While Perez did not tell\nCruz if Villanueva had a gun, Cruz knew Villanueva had access\nto guns through Castro. Perez\u2019s admissions made Cruz feel hurt,\nangry, and worried. The affair was humiliating to Cruz. He had\nfriends in common with Villanueva and was embarrassed that\nthey would know his wife had a sexual relationship with his\nfriend. Cruz was also worried because he believed Villanueva\nwas serious about wanting to kill him. After Perez told him\n\n\n\n\n                                 8\n\fabout the threats, Cruz began carrying a loaded revolver in his\npocket for protection from Villanueva.\n       On the night of the shooting, Cruz and Lalo went to the\napartment complex to visit a friend named Alfredo. Cruz had\nconsumed alcohol, cocaine, and methamphetamine throughout\nthe day. As Cruz was standing on the sidewalk talking to the\nmen, he noticed Villanueva\u2019s vehicle parked on the street. Castro\ngot out of the vehicle and approached the group. He spoke to\nAlfredo but ignored Cruz. Cruz wondered why Villanueva had\nstayed inside the vehicle, and started to get worried and nervous.\nCruz decided to talk to Villanueva rather than leave. He believed\nthat, even if he left at that time, \u201cthe problem [was] still going to\nbe there,\u201d and he did not \u201cwant to be living [his] life looking over\n[his] shoulder.\u201d As he was walking toward the vehicle, Cruz did\nnot intend to shoot Villanueva, but only to speak with him.\n       Cruz could not see inside Villanueva\u2019s vehicle because the\nwindows were darkly tinted. The driver\u2019s door of the vehicle was\nslightly ajar. When Cruz pulled the handle and opened the door,\nhe saw Villanueva sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. Villanueva gave\nCruz an angry look and then quickly reached to his right and\ngrabbed a gun from the center console area. In response, Cruz\npulled his own gun from his pocket, pointed it at Villanueva, and\n\u201cshot him as fast as [he] could.\u201d Cruz did not wait for Villanueva\nto point the gun at him because he did not want to get shot.\nWhile firing his weapon, Cruz felt panic and fear for his life. At\nthat moment, Cruz believed he was going to die based on the look\non Villanueva\u2019s face, his social media post, the fact that\nVillanueva had suddenly stopped talking to Cruz, and Perez\u2019s\nstatements that Villanueva wanted to kill him. Cruz would not\nhave shot Villanueva if he did not think he saw a gun.\n\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\f       Immediately after the shooting, Cruz was scared and in\nshock. He stood by the vehicle for a few seconds, then walked\nback to his truck. He decided to leave the scene because he\nthought the police would not believe him. Cruz got rid of the gun\nafter the shooting because he was afraid and did not want the\nweapon in his possession. Although Cruz was under the\ninfluence of drugs and alcohol at the time of the shooting, he\ndenied that it caused him to fire his gun at Villanueva. Cruz\ntestified that the \u201c[o]nly thing that caused [him] to shoot\n[Villanueva] was fear, that [Villanueva] was about to shoot\n[him].\u201d\n\n      Jury Verdict and Sentencing\n      The jury found Cruz guilty of second degree murder (\u00a7 187,\nsubd. (a)) and shooting at an occupied motor vehicle (\u00a7 246). On\neach count, the jury found the firearm enhancement allegations\nunder section 12022.53, subdivisions (b), (c), and (d) to be true.\nThe trial court sentenced Cruz to a total term of 40 years to life\nin state prison, consisting of 15 years to life on the second degree\nmurder count, plus 25 years to life on the firearm enhancement\nunder section 12022.53, subdivision (d). The court stayed the\nsentence on the remaining firearm enhancements on the murder\ncount pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (f). The court\nalso stayed the sentence on the shooting at an occupied vehicle\ncount pursuant to section 654, and struck each firearm\nenhancement on that count pursuant to section 1385.\n      Cruz timely appealed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 10\n\f                           DISCUSSION\n\n      Failure to Instruct on Voluntary Manslaughter\n      Based on Heat of Passion\n      On appeal, Cruz asserts the trial court erred in failing to\ninstruct the jury sua sponte on voluntary manslaughter under\na heat of passion theory. Although the trial court instructed the\njury on voluntary manslaughter based on imperfect self-defense,\nCruz argues a voluntary manslaughter instruction based on heat\nof passion was also warranted because there was substantial\nevidence to support a finding that he killed Villanueva in a heat\nof passion due to sufficient and continuing provocation.\n\n\n       It is the trial court\u2019s \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018duty to instruct the jury not only\non the crime with which the defendant is charged, but also on\nany lesser offense that is both included in the offense charged\nand shown by the evidence to have been committed.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (People\nv. Westerfield (2019) 6 Cal.5th 632, 718, italics omitted.)\n\u201c \u2018 \u201cConversely, even on request, the court \u2018has no duty to instruct\non any lesser offense unless there is substantial evidence to\nsupport such instruction.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Souza (2012) 54 Cal.4th\n90, 116.) In this context, the \u201c \u2018substantial evidence requirement\nis not satisfied by \u201c \u2018any evidence . . . no matter how weak,\u2019 \u201d but\nrather by evidence from which a jury . . . could conclude \u201cthat the\nlesser offense, but not the greater, was committed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v.\nNelson (2016) 1 Cal.5th 513, 538.) \u201c \u2018On appeal, we review\nindependently the question whether the trial court improperly\nfailed to instruct on a lesser included offense.\u2019 \u201d (Ibid.)\n       \u201c \u2018Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being . . . with\nmalice aforethought.\u2019 (\u00a7 187, subd. (a).) \u2018Manslaughter is the\n\n\n\n\n                                  11\n\funlawful killing of a human being without malice.\u2019 (\u00a7 192,\nsubd. (a).) Manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder,\nand a defendant who commits an intentional and unlawful killing\nbut who lacks malice is guilty of voluntary manslaughter.\u201d\n(People v. Nelson, supra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 538.) For \u201cpurposes of\nvoluntary manslaughter\u2014an unlawful killing without malice\u2014\nthe absence of malice is limited to two circumstances: \u2018 \u201c \u2018when\nthe defendant acts in a \u201csudden quarrel or heat of passion\u201d (\u00a7 192,\nsubd. (a)), or when the defendant kills in \u201cunreasonable self-\ndefense\u201d\u2014the unreasonable but good faith belief in having to act\nin self-defense.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Landry (2016) 2 Cal.5th 52, 92.)\n\u201cIf either of these circumstances is found, an unlawful killing will\nbe voluntary manslaughter rather than murder.\u201d (Id. at p. 97.)\n       \u201cHeat of passion arises if, \u2018 \u201cat the time of the killing, the\nreason of the accused was obscured or disturbed by passion to\nsuch an extent as would cause the ordinarily reasonable person\nof average disposition to act rashly and without deliberation and\nreflection, and from such passion rather than from judgment.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n(People v. Beltran (2013) 56 Cal.4th 935, 942.) A heat of passion\ntheory of voluntary manslaughter has both an objective and a\nsubjective component. (People v. Moye (2009) 47 Cal.4th 537,\n549.) Objectively, \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe accused\u2019s heat of passion must be due to\n\u2018sufficient provocation\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (ibid.), and subjectively, \u201cthe accused\nmust be shown to have killed while under \u2018the actual influence\nof a strong passion\u2019 induced by such provocation\u201d (id. at p. 550).\nThe \u201c \u2018 \u201cfactor which distinguishes the \u2018heat of passion\u2019 form of\nvoluntary manslaughter from murder is provocation.\u201d \u2019\n[Citation.] \u2018To be adequate, the provocation must be one that\nwould cause an emotion so intense that an ordinary person would\nsimply react, without reflection. . . . . [T]he anger or other\n\n\n\n\n                                 12\n\fpassion must be so strong that the defendant\u2019s reaction bypassed\nhis thought process to such an extent that judgment could not\nand did not intervene.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Beck and Cruz (2019)\n8 Cal.5th 548, 649.)\n\n\n\n\n      For purposes of the murder charge in this case, the trial\ncourt instructed the jury on first and second degree murder with\nmalice aforethought, involuntary manslaughter, and the effect of\nvoluntary intoxication on homicide crimes. The trial court also\ninstructed the jury on both justifiable homicide based on self-\ndefense and voluntary manslaughter based on imperfect self-\ndefense. Cruz did not request, and the trial court did not give,\nan instruction on voluntary manslaughter based on heat of\npassion. On appeal, Cruz contends there was substantial\nevidence from which the jury could have found that he killed\nVillanueva in the heat of passion, and thus, the failure to instruct\nthe jury sua sponte on this theory of voluntary manslaughter\nconstitutes reversible error. We conclude this claim lacks merit.\n      Cruz argues a heat of passion instruction was required\nbecause there was evidence that Villanueva made provocative\nand continuing threats to kill Cruz and take his family to Mexico,\nand that upon learning of the threats from his wife, Cruz reacted\nby confronting and shooting Villanueva in a heat of passion. It is\ntrue, as Cruz asserts, that the \u201cprovocation sufficient to reduce\nmurder to manslaughter need not occur instantaneously, but may\noccur over a period of time.\u201d (People v. Wharton (1991) 53 Cal.3d\n522, 569; accord, People v. McShane (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 245,\n256 [\u201cprovocation \u2018may comprise a single incident or numerous\n\n\n\n\n                                13\n\fincidents over a period of time\u2019\u201d].) However, if \u201c \u2018sufficient time\nhas elapsed between the provocation and the fatal blow for\npassion to subside and reason to return, the killing is not\nvoluntary manslaughter.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Beltran, supra, 56 Cal.4th\nat p. 951.) To warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction,\n\u201cthe killing must be \u2018upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion\u2019\n[citation]; that is, \u2018suddenly as a response to the provocation, and\nnot belatedly as revenge or punishment.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Daniels\n(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 868.) \u201cAccordingly, it is not sufficient that\na person \u2018is provoked and [then] later kills.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Nelson,\nsupra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 539.)\n       Here, Cruz\u2019s wife, Perez, testified that Villanueva made\nrepeated and escalating threats to kill Cruz between July and\nAugust 2017. Although Perez did not have any contact with\nVillanueva after she ended their affair in early August, she\nperceived Villanueva\u2019s October 5 Facebook post in which he\nposed with a rifle and made a derogatory remark about the\ntype of vehicle that Cruz drove as an additional attempt to\n\u201ctrigger\u201d Cruz. On November 13, Perez disclosed to Cruz the\naffair and Villanueva\u2019s threats. While Cruz felt hurt, angry, and\nworried upon learning of the affair and Villanueva\u2019s threats\nagainst his life, he did not take any immediate action in response\nto Perez\u2019s disclosures. It was not until five days later, on\nNovember 18, that Cruz decided to approach Villanueva when he\nsaw Villanueva\u2019s vehicle parked on the street. Because this five-\nday period was sufficient time for Cruz\u2019s \u201cpassion to subside and\nreason to return,\u201d the evidence of Villanueva\u2019s prior threats of\nviolence did not, standing alone, constitute legally sufficient\nprovocation to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction.\n(People v. Beltran, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 951; see People v. Moye,\n\n\n\n\n                                14\n\fsupra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 551 [voluntary manslaughter instruction\nnot required where evidence of fight involving defendant and\nvictim the evening before victim\u2019s deadly beating \u201cdid not itself\nconstitute legally sufficient provocation\u201d]; People v. Pride (1992) 3\nCal.4th 195, 250 [three-day gap between act of provocation and\nfatal stabbing of victim rendered provocation \u201cinsufficient as a\nmatter of law to arouse feelings of homicidal rage or passion in\nan ordinarily reasonable person\u201d]; People v. McShane, supra,\n36 Cal.App.5th at p. 256 [defendant\u2019s altercation with victim four\ndays before fatal shooting was not adequate provocation because\n\u201c[f]our days was sufficient \u2018cooling time,\u2019 as a matter of law\u201d].)\n       Cruz further asserts that, on the night of the shooting, he\nwas provoked into killing Villanueva because he believed that\nVillanueva was prepared to kill him and that Villanueva might\nbe armed with a gun. Cruz notes that Perez testified she told\nhim about Villanueva\u2019s plan to get a gun from his gang member\nfriend, Castro, and to use it to \u201cset [Cruz] up and kill [him].\u201d\nCruz also notes that, while no gun was found in Villanueva\u2019s\nvehicle, Castro could have removed the weapon prior to the\narrival of the police to avoid scrutiny into his own involvement in\nthe shooting.\n       Yet, even assuming that Cruz reasonably believed\nVillanueva was armed with a gun when he approached the\nvehicle, Cruz was not entitled to an instruction on voluntary\nmanslaughter under a heat of passion theory. Based on Cruz\u2019s\nown trial testimony, immediately before the shooting he\napproached Villanueva\u2019s vehicle feeling worried or nervous, but\nwith the rational intent of merely talking to Villanueva. The only\npassion or intense emotion that Cruz experienced occurred as he\nshot Villanueva because he feared for his own life and thought\n\n\n\n\n                                 15\n\fVillanueva was going to shoot him. The jury was instructed both\non justifiable homicide based on reasonable self-defense and\nvoluntary manslaughter based on imperfect self-defense. Under\nthese circumstances, the trial court was not required to also\ninstruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter based on heat of\npassion.\n       The California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in People v. Moye,\nsupra, 47 Cal.4th 537, is instructive on this issue. The defendant\nin Moye was convicted of second degree murder. (Id. at p. 540.)\nThe evidence showed he killed the victim during a confrontation\nthat took place the morning after they had engaged in a fistfight.\n(Id. at pp. 542\u2013554.) According to the defendant\u2019s uncontested\ntestimony, on the morning of the killing, the victim attacked him\nwith a baseball bat after he approached the victim on the street\nand then chased him over a fence. (Id. at p. 552.) The defendant\nfended off the attack by grabbing the bat from the victim and\nstriking him with it in self-defense until the victim fell to the\nground. (Ibid.) While the trial court instructed the jury both\non justifiable homicide based on reasonable self-defense and\nvoluntary manslaughter based on imperfect self-defense, it\nrefused a defense request for an instruction on voluntary\nmanslaughter based on heat of passion. (Id. at p. 550.) On\nappeal, the Supreme Court concluded the trial court did not err\nin refusing to give a heat of passion instruction, stating: The\n\u201cthrust of defendant\u2019s testimony below was self-defense\u2014both\nreasonable self-defense (a complete defense to the criminal\ncharges), and unreasonable or imperfect self-defense (a partial\ndefense that reduces murder to manslaughter). There was\ninsubstantial evidence at the close of the evidentiary phase to\nestablish that defendant \u2018actually, subjectively, kill[ed] under\n\n\n\n\n                                16\n\fthe heat of passion.\u2019 \u201d (Id. at p. 554.) While the Supreme Court\nrecognized there may be circumstances where instructions on\nboth theories of manslaughter are warranted, it rejected any\nsuggestion that a heat of passion instruction is required \u201cin every\ncase in which the only evidence of unreasonable self-defense is\nthe circumstance that a defendant is attacked and consequently\nfears for his life.\u201d (Id. at p. 555, italics omitted.)\n       In this case, Cruz testified in unambiguous terms that the\n\u201c[o]nly thing that caused [him] to shoot [Villanueva] was fear,\nthat [Villanueva] was about to shoot [him].\u201d Cruz stated that,\nwhen he approached Villanueva\u2019s parked vehicle, he did not\nintend to kill Villanueva, but only \u201c[t]o talk to him.\u201d However,\nonce Cruz opened the driver\u2019s door of the vehicle and saw\nVillanueva reach for a gun, Cruz pulled out his own gun and\n\u201cshot him as fast as [he] could.\u201d Cruz stated that he shot\nVillanueva because he was \u201cscared\u201d and in \u201cfear.\u201d At one point in\nhis testimony, Cruz stated that he felt \u201c[p]anic\u201d as he was firing\nthe gun. However, he attributed his panic and fear at the time of\nthe shooting to his belief that he was \u201cgoing to die\u201d given the\npresence of a gun, the look on Villanueva\u2019s face, and the prior\nthreats that Villanueva had made against his life. Cruz\nmaintained that he would not have fired his weapon if he did not\nsee Villanueva with a gun. Cruz further testified that he knew it\nwas \u201cnot right to take someone\u2019s life[,] [b]ut what is there to do\nwhen you\u2019re about to get your life taken?\u201d\n       Accordingly, as in Moye, the thrust of Cruz\u2019s testimony was\nthat he acted in self-defense. Cruz repeatedly testified that the\nreason he shot Villanueva was because he feared for his own life.\nIn explaining his mental state at the time of the shooting, Cruz\ndid not describe any passion or other extreme emotion beyond the\n\n\n\n\n                                17\n\fpanic and fear that he felt because he believed Villanueva was\ngoing to kill him. Because there was no substantial evidence\nto support a finding that Cruz \u201c \u2018actually, subjectively, kill[ed]\nunder the heat of passion,\u2019 \u201d rather than in reasonable or\nunreasonable self-defense, the trial court had no duty to\ninstruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter under a heat of\npassion theory. (People v. Moye, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 554.)\n       Moreover, even assuming the trial court erred in failing\nto instruct the jury on the heat of passion theory of voluntary\nmanslaughter, any such error would be harmless under the\nstandard set forth in People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836\nbecause it is not reasonably probable that Cruz would have\nobtained a more favorable outcome if the jury had been so\ninstructed. (People v. Gonzalez (2019) 5 Cal.5th 186, 195\u2013196\n[Watson standard applies to failure to instruct on lesser included\noffenses supported by substantial evidence in noncapital cases];\nPeople v. Moye, supra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 555\u2013556 [same].)\n       In finding Cruz guilty of second degree murder, the jury\nnecessarily rejected his account that he shot Villanueva based\non an actual or perceived need to defend himself. As the\nSupreme Court explained in People v. Moye, supra, 47 Cal.4th\nat page 557: \u201cOnce the jury rejected defendant\u2019s claims of\nreasonable and imperfect self-defense, there was little if any\nindependent evidence remaining to support his further claim\nthat he killed in the heat of passion, and no direct testimonial\nevidence from defendant himself to support an inference that he\nsubjectively harbored such strong passion, or acted rashly or\nimpulsively while under its influence for reasons unrelated to his\nperceived need for self-defense. . . . [\u00b6] Moreover, the jury\nhaving rejected the factual basis for the claims of reasonable and\n\n\n\n\n                                18\n\funreasonable self-defense, it is not reasonably probable the jury\nwould have found the requisite objective component of a heat of\npassion defense (legally sufficient provocation) even had it been\ninstructed on that theory of voluntary manslaughter.\u201d (Italics\nomitted.)\n      As in Moye, once the jury in this case rejected Cruz\u2019s claims\nof reasonable and unreasonable self-defense, there was no\nreasonable probability that it would have found Cruz guilty of\nvoluntary manslaughter based on heat of passion even if it had\nbeen instructed on that theory. Cruz therefore has failed to show\nprejudicial instructional error.\n\n      Imposition of Section 12022.53, Subdivision (d)\n      Firearm Enhancement\n      Cruz argues the matter must be remanded for resentencing\nbecause the trial court abused its discretion in imposing a 25-\nyear-to-life firearm enhancement on the murder count under\nsection 12022.53, subdivision (d) rather than a lesser-included\nenhancement under subdivision (b) or (c) of the statute. We find\nno abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision.\n\n\n       Section 12022.53 sets forth three escalating sentence\nenhancements for the personal use of a firearm in the commission\nof certain enumerated felonies, including murder: a 10-year\nprison term if the defendant \u201cpersonally uses a firearm,\u201d even if\nthe weapon is not operable or loaded (id., subd. (b)); a 20-year\nterm if the defendant \u201cpersonally and intentionally discharges\na firearm\u201d (id., subd. (c)); and a 25-year-to-life term if the\nintentional discharge of the firearm causes \u201cgreat bodily injury\u201d\nor \u201cdeath, to any person other than an accomplice\u201d (id., subd. (d)).\n\n\n\n\n                                19\n\fIn cases where multiple section 12022.53 enhancements are\nfound true on the same count, once the trial court imposes\npunishment for the firearm enhancement with the longest term\nof imprisonment, the remaining firearm enhancements on that\ncount must be imposed and then stayed. (Id., subd. (f); People v.\nGonzalez (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1118, 1123.)\n       Effective January 1, 2018, the Legislature amended section\n12022.53, subdivision (h), to give trial courts discretion to strike\nor dismiss firearm enhancements \u201cin the interest of justice\npursuant to Section 1385.\u201d (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (h), as amended\nby Stats. 2017, ch. 682, \u00a7 2.) In deciding whether to strike or\ndismiss a firearm enhancement, a trial court is required to\nconsider the factors bearing on its section 1385 discretion,\nincluding \u201cthe rights of the defendant, the interests of society\nrepresented by the People, and individualized considerations\npertaining to the defendant and his or her offenses and\nbackground.\u201d (People v. Rocha (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 352, 359.)\n       A \u201c \u2018court\u2019s discretionary decision to dismiss or to strike a\nsentencing allegation under section 1385 is\u2019 reviewable for abuse\nof discretion.\u201d (People v. Carmony (2004) 33 Cal.4th 367, 373;\naccord, People v. Pearson (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 112, 116.)\n\u201cIn reviewing for abuse of discretion, we are guided by two\nfundamental precepts. First, \u2018 \u201c[t]he burden is on the party\nattacking the sentence to clearly show that the sentencing\ndecision was irrational or arbitrary. [Citation.] In the absence\nof such a showing, the trial court is presumed to have acted to\nachieve legitimate sentencing objectives, and its discretionary\ndetermination to impose a particular sentence will not be set\naside on review.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] Second, a \u2018 \u201cdecision will not be\nreversed merely because reasonable people might disagree.\n\n\n\n\n                                 20\n\f\u2018An appellate tribunal is neither authorized nor warranted in\nsubstituting its judgment for the judgment of the trial judge.\u2019 \u201d \u2019\n[Citations.] Taken together, these precepts establish that a\ntrial court does not abuse its discretion unless its decision is so\nirrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree\nwith it.\u201d (Carmony, at pp. 376\u2013377.)\n\n\n\n\n       In connection with the murder count, the jury found true\nthe firearm enhancement allegations under section 12022.53,\nsubdivisions (b), (c), and (d). In sentencing Cruz on this count,\nthe trial court imposed the 25-year-to life firearm enhancement\nunder section 12022.53, subdivision (d) and stayed the remaining\nfirearm enhancements pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision\n(f). On appeal, Cruz asserts the trial court abused its discretion\nin declining to strike or dismiss the section 12022.53, subdivision\n(d) enhancement in favor of one of the lesser-included firearm\nenhancements found true by the jury.\n       As Cruz points out, appellate courts are currently split on\nwhether the trial court has discretion to impose a 10-year or 20-\nyear firearm enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision\n(b) or (c) where only a 25-year-to-life firearm enhancement under\nsection 12022.53, subdivision (d) was alleged and found to be\ntrue. (Compare People v. Morrison (2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 217\n[courts may impose uncharged lesser enhancements] with People\nv. Tirado (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 637, review granted Nov. 13,\n2019, S257658 [courts may not]; People v. Garcia (2020) 46\nCal.App.5th 786, review granted June 10, 2020, S261772 [same].)\nIn this case, however, the People alleged all three section\n\n\n\n\n                                 21\n\f12022.53 enhancements on the murder count, and the jury found\neach of those enhancements to be true. Moreover, the record\nreflects that the trial court understood it had the discretion to\nstrike or dismiss any of the section 12022.53 enhancements in the\ninterest of justice, and that it expressly declined to do so.\n       At the January 15, 2020 sentencing hearing, defense\ncounsel specifically asked the trial court to strike each of the\nthree firearm enhancements based on the recent amendment to\nsection 12022.53, or alternatively, to impose only the 10-year\nfirearm enhancement under section 12022.53, subdivision (b).\nAfter hearing the argument of counsel, the trial court stated: \u201cAll\nright. Obviously I presided over the trial. I heard the case. I\nheard the evidence. I was able to observe the witnesses who\ntestified including Mr. Cruz. And the court is aware, the record\nshould be clear the court is aware, of its discretion. I do have\nthat discretion now to strike any firearm enhancement.\nHowever, the court is going to deny the request and deny the\nmotion to strike the firearm enhancements for the following\nreasons.\u201d Contrary to Cruz\u2019s claim on appeal, there is nothing in\nthe record to suggest that the trial court was unaware of its\ndiscretion to strike any or all firearm enhancements under\nsection 12022.53, subdivision (h).\n       Cruz also asserts the trial court abused its discretion in\nimposing the section 12022.53, subdivision (d) enhancement\ngiven the circumstances of the offense, his lack of a criminal\nrecord, and his status as an upstanding citizen and father of\nyoung children. However, the record shows the trial court\nconsidered relevant aggravating and mitigating factors in\ndeclining to strike any of the firearm enhancements on the\nmurder count. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rules 4.421, 4.423,\n\n\n\n\n                                22\n\f4.428(b).) In particular, the trial court noted that, while Cruz\u2019s\nlack of a criminal record was a mitigating circumstance that the\ncourt considered, there were several aggravating circumstances,\nincluding that the victim was particularly vulnerable, multiple\nshots were fired, and Cruz fled the scene of the shooting. Cruz\ntakes issue with the trial court\u2019s statements that the victim\n\u201cdidn\u2019t do anything to instigate\u201d the offense and that the manner\nin which Cruz carried out the murder \u201cwould indicate some\nplanning, sophistication, and professionalism.\u201d However, in\ndetermining whether the trial court abused its discretion in\nrefusing to strike or dismiss an enhancement, the relevant\ninquiry is whether its sentencing decision was \u201cso irrational\nor arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree with it.\u201d\n(People v. Carmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 377.) Here, the\ntotality of the record at sentencing demonstrates that the trial\ncourt weighed the relevant factors and made an informed\nsentencing decision that was neither irrational nor arbitrary.\nThere was no abuse of discretion.\n\n      Presentence Custody Credits\n      Lastly, Cruz asserts, and the People agree, that the\nsentencing minute order and the abstract of judgment do not\naccurately reflect his presentence custody credits. At the\nsentencing hearing, the trial court awarded Cruz 777 days\nof actual custody credit. However, the minute order for the\nsentencing hearing fails to identify any custody credit, and the\nabstract of judgment incorrectly lists Cruz\u2019s actual custody credit\nas \u201c000.\u201d Accordingly, the sentencing minute order and abstract\nof judgment must be modified to reflect that Cruz was awarded\n777 days of actual custody credit at sentencing. (See People v.\nMitchell (2001) 26 Cal.4th 181, 185\u2013186 [when there is a\n\n\n\n\n                                23\n\fdiscrepancy between the court\u2019s oral pronouncement and the\nminute order or abstract of judgment, the oral pronouncement\ncontrols].)\n\n                         DISPOSITION\n\n      The judgment is modified to reflect an award of 777 days\nof actual custody credit.
