    "summary": "Isham Maile was indicted in the circuit superiour court of Chesterfield, for the murder of Archer Maile. The indictment charges, that Isham Maile, on &c. in the county of Chesterfield, feloniously &c. and of his malice , aforethought, did make an assault upon Archer Maile, and did then and there, feloniously &c. and of his malice aforesaid, shoot off and discharge to, upon and against the said Archer Maile a certain shot gun charged with gunpowder and shot, and did then and there, with the shot aforesaid, feloniously &c. and of his malice aforesaid, strike, penetrate and wound the said Archer Maile, giving him then and there, with the shot aforesaid, one mortal wound, of which he then and there instantly died ; and so the jurors said that Isham Maile him the said Archer Maile, feloniously &c. and of his malice aforesaid, did kill and murder, against the form of the act of assembly. On the trial of the case, Thomas Gibbs, being called as a juror and sworn on the voir dire, stated \u201c that he was not present at the examining court, but that he has heard a report of some of the circumstances of this case, which report he believes to be true, and upon which he has formed and expressed a decided opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner. He believes, however, that notwithstanding what he has heard, his mind is open to conviction; and he has no doubt that if the facts should turn out to be different from what they have been represented to him, his opinion would be changed. He does not know that what he has heard came from any one who heard the evidence at the examining court, nor does he believe that what he heard was a full detail of all the circumstances, but he believes it to .be true, and upon that belief he has formed and expressed a decided opinion, which opinion is still abiding on his mind.\u201d The prisoner then challenged the said Thomas Gibbs for cause; but the court overruled the challenge, and put the prisoner upon his election; to which opinion of the court he excepted. The jury found the prisoner guilty of voluntary manslaughter, and ascertained his term of imprisonment in the penitentiary to be five years. When brought up to receive his sentence, he moved \u00b0 1 . , the court to arrest the judgment, \u201c because ot the m-sufficiency of the indictment in not charging him with the crime of murder, for which he was arraigned and tried before the jury.\u201d The court overruled the motion, and pronounced judgment according to the verdict; and the prisoner excepted to the opinion overruling his said motion. At the last term of the general court, he applied for and obtained a writ of error to the judgment, upon a petition assigning for error, 1. That the circuit court improperly overruled his challenge of the juror Thomas Gibbs. 2. That the said court improperly overruled his motion in arrest of judgment; the indictment being \u201c insufficient to charge the crime of murder, because it does not allege that the prisoner, of his malice aforethought, murdered the deceased, but substitutes an entirely different phrase; whereas the words malice aforethought are absolutely indispensable, and admit of no substitute.\u201d",

            "opinion_text": "\nClopton, J.\ndelivered the opinion of the court.\u2014 From the statement made by Thomas Gibbs when called as a juror in this case, it does not appear that he had any prejudice against the prisoner. The opinion which he had formed and expressed, although called by him a decided opinion upon the report which he had heard, did not involve the full question of the guilt or innocence of the prisoner; because the mind of the juror was satisfied that what he had heard was not a full detail of all the circumstances. What he had heard, therefore, could not afford materials for such an opinion. The *664opinion formed was evidently, in its character, merely \u2022 hypothetical, depending upon the truth of what he had heard, and the addition of other and fuller proof, and could not influence the mind of a juror otherwise unbiassed and impartial. The court is therefore of opinion that the juror was competent, and that the prisoner\u2019s challenge for cause was properly overruled. ' On this point, however, judges Estill, Brown, Duncan and Fry dissent.\nThe court is of opinion that the indictment is a good indictment for murder, the term \u201caforesaid\u201d referring with sufficient certainty to the malice previously charged as malice aforethought; and although it is the most usual course to repeat the terms malice aforethought, it is well settled that the substitution of aforesaid for aforethotight is not error. In Heydon\u2019s case, 4 Rep. 41. the words ufel\u00f3nica et ex malitia jproecogitala\u201d were omitted in that part of the indictment which charged the blow, which was connected wi.th the felony and malice previously charged, by a copulative; and the court decided that the conjunction coupled all the sentences together, and referred the felony and malice charged in the first part of the indictment to all the subsequent verbs. And in 2 Hawk. P. C. 314. it is laid down, that the law will not admit of too great nicety, and that if, in the first part of an indictment of death, the assault be laid with malice prepense, there is no need to repeat it in the clause which shews the giving the wound, that being joined by a copulative to the precedent sentence, and 'laid at the sam\u00e9 time and place with the assault.\nThe court doth therefore decide that there is no error in the judgment, and that it be affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed.\n",
