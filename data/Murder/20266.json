Hilbig, Justice\n\nDelivered and Filed: August 6, 2008\n\n           To convict Melissa Ann Fulcher of possession of methamphetamine, the State was required\n\nto prove she intentionally and knowingly possessed methamphetamine. During her trial, Fulcher\n\ndid not contest that a trace amount of methamphetamine was found on two items seized from her\n\ntruck: a mirror found in the glove box and a broken light bulb found in a blue canvas bag in the\n\nback of her vehicle. However, Fulcher disputed that she knowingly possessed the two items.\n\nEssentially, her position at trial was she did not intentionally or knowingly possess any item that\n\ncontained a controlled substance. The trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that the State was\n\fDissenting Opinion                                                                         04-07-00303-CR\n\nrequired to prove beyond a reasonable doubt a knowing or intentional possession of\n\nmethamphetamine thus \u201cvitally affected\u201d Fulcher\u2019s only defensive theory. See Sanchez v. State, 209\n\nS.W.3d 117, 121 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). Because the majority holds Fulcher did not suffer\n\negregious harm as a result of the trial court\u2019s failure to include a mens rea in the application\n\nparagraph of the court\u2019s charge, I respectfully dissent.\n\n        As the majority opinion correctly states, unpreserved jury charge error is reversible only if\n\nthe resulting harm is \u201cegregious\u201d; that is, if the error in the charge \u201caffects the very basis of the case,\n\ndeprives the defendant of a valuable right, or vitally affects a defensive theory.\u201d Stuhler v. State,\n\n218 S.W.3d 706, 719 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). In determining whether there was egregious harm,\n\nthe reviewing court must consider the entire jury charge, the state of the evidence, including the\n\ncontested issues and the weight of probative evidence, counsels\u2019 arguments to the jury, and any other\n\nrelevant information revealed by the record of the trial as a whole. Id.; Sanchez, 209 S.W.3d at 121.\n\nI review each in turn.\n\n                                           The Jury Charge\n\n        The jury charge stated in relevant part:\n\n                The defendant, Melissa Ann Fulcher, stands charged by indictment with the\n        offense of possession of a controlled substance, to wit, methamphetamine, in the\n        amount of less than one gram, alleged to have been committed on or about the 16th\n        day of September, 2004, in Bandera County, Texas. The defendant has pleaded \u201cnot\n        guilty.\u201d\n\n                                               I.\n               Our law provides that a person commits an offense if, she intentionally or\n        knowingly possesses a controlled substance. Under our law, methamphetamine is\n        a controlled substance.\n\n                                                    II.\n\n\n                                                    -2-\n\fDissenting Opinion                                                                      04-07-00303-CR\n\n                Possession means actual care, custody, control, or management. Possession\n        is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly obtains or receives the thing possessed\n        or is aware of her control of the thing for a sufficient time to permit her to terminate\n        her control.\n\n        [definition of \u201cadulterant or dilutant\u201d omitted]\n\n                                               III.\n              A person acts intentionally, or with intent, with respect to the nature of her\n        conduct when it is her conscious objective or desire to engage in the conduct.\n\n               A person acts knowingly, or with knowledge, with respect to the nature of her\n        conduct when she is aware of the nature of her conduct or to the circumstances\n        surrounding her conduct when she is aware of the nature of her conduct or that the\n        circumstances exist.\n\n                                              IV.\n               Now if you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that on or\n        about the 16th day of September, 2004, in Bandera County, Texas, the defendant,\n        Melissa Ann Fulcher, did then and there possess a controlled substance, to wit:\n        methamphetamine in an amount of less than one (1) gram, then you will find the\n        defendant guilty as charged.\n\n        The majority concludes the charge \u201csufficiently informed the jury of the mental state\n\nrequired for commission of the charged offense.\u201d Fulcher v. State, No. 04-07-00303-CR, slip op.\n\nat 8 (Tex. App.\u2013San Antonio Aug. 6, 2008). Although this may be a true statement, the charge did\n\nnot sufficiently inform the jury of the mental state required for conviction of the charged offense.\n\nThe charge provided the jury the definitions for intentionally and knowingly, but the jury was given\n\nno guidance on how to apply those definitions to its determination of Fulcher\u2019s guilt. The\n\nintroductory paragraph of the charge told the jury Fulcher was charged with possession of\n\nmethamphetamine without any reference to a mens rea. Paragraph I instructed the jury that the law\n\nprovides an offense is committed if possession is intentional or knowing. Yet Paragraph III, the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -3-\n\fDissenting Opinion                                                                     04-07-00303-CR\n\napplication paragraph, commands the jury to find guilt for possession alone, without any\n\nrequirement of a mens rea.\n\n                         The State of the Evidence and Contested Issues\n\n        The State was required to prove Fulcher intentionally or knowingly possessed an item and\n\nknew the item was methamphetamine. See Joseph v. State, 897 S.W.2d 374, 376 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1995). The State\u2019s chemist testified two items submitted to him contained trace amounts of\n\nmethamphetamine. He testified a trace amount, not visible to the naked eye, was found on a broken\n\nlight bulb. To conduct the test, he had to rinse the glass with water and test the resulting solution:\n\n        A:      [by chemist] On State\u2019s Exhibit 7, I only rinsed two pieces of the glass in\n                State\u2019s Exhibit No. 7, the broken glass, so I took out two of the pieces of\n                glass and rinsed them for my analysis.\n\n        Q:      [by prosecutor] Okay, and I\u2019m assuming if you couldn\u2019t weigh it, once you\n                tested it, it no longer exists?\n\n        A:      The substances that I rinsed were consumed in the analysis, the portion that\n                I analyzed.\n\nThe prosecutor continued with questioning about the mirror:\n\n        Q:      Okay, and that\u2019s the same thing for the mirror?\n\n        A:      Yes, there really wasn\u2019t anything for me to scrape off, to weigh, and so I\n                didn\u2019t rinse it for my analysis, and it was consumed in my analysis.\n\n        Q:      Do you remember what type of substance was in the mirror? Was it white,\n                black, blue, or \u2013\n\n        A:      No, the only thing that I do [sic] was it was a residue. I don\u2019t have the color\n                written down, what color it was.\n\nThe chemist\u2019s testimony about the appearance of the mirror and his testing of it was less than clear.\n\nHowever, the officer who seized the mirror testified a powdery residue was present on its surface.\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\fDissenting Opinion                                                                   04-07-00303-CR\n\nThe only additional item the State submitted for testing, the contents of a Sunkist bottle, tested\n\nnegative for methamphetamine.\n\n        The State\u2019s evidence thus showed only a trace of methamphetamine on two items. The trace\n\nwas not visible at all on the broken light bulb and the mirror contained a residue of unspecified\n\nappearance and too small to scrape off. \u201c\u2018[W]hen the quantity of a substance possessed is so small\n\nthat it cannot be measured, there must be evidence other than mere possession to prove that the\n\ndefendant knew the substance in his possession was a controlled substance.\u2019\u201d King v. State,\n\n895 S.W.2d 701, 703 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (quoting Shults v. State, 575 S.W.2d 29, 30 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1979)).\n\n        To prove Fulcher knew the substance on the mirror and light bulb was methamphetamine,\n\nthe State presented evidence that she exhibited many signs associated with an abuser of\n\nmethamphetamine and that she was under the influence of the drug when she was arrested. Deputy\n\nPrice testified Fulcher had \u201cstrong signs\u201d of a methamphetamine user, such as sores and blisters on\n\nher tongue and mouth and open sores on her arms and body. Deputy Johnson testified Fulcher also\n\nhad burn marks on her lips, indicating she had smoked \u201cmethamphetamine or crack cocaine.\u201d He\n\nalso testified Fulcher\u2019s purse contained receipts for the purchase of items that are used to\n\nmanufacture methamphetamine. Deputies Price and Harrell testified Fulcher engaged in violent,\n\nemotional, and irrational behavior when she was arrested, including banging her head against the\n\nside and rear windows of the patrol car. Deputy Johnson testified Fulcher\u2019s eyes were dilated, which\n\n\u201cindicates a stimulant is present inside the body, methamphetamine, cocaine or common stimulants.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fDissenting Opinion                                                                                  04-07-00303-CR\n\n         The State also sought to prove Fulcher knowingly possessed methamphetamine with\n\nevidence that the items containing a trace of methamphetamine were associated with use of the drug.\n\nThe chemist explained to the jury how drug abusers convert an ordinary incandescent light bulb into\n\na pipe for smoking methamphetamine. Deputy Harrell testified a mirror is commonly used to\n\nfacilitate the smoking of methamphetamine by using it as a base on which to \u201cchop\u201d the\n\nmethamphetamine crystals.\n\n         Finally, the State attempted to show knowledge of the presence of methamphetamine through\n\ntestimony that a drug-sniffing dog used during the search alerted to four additional locations in the\n\nvehicle. However, the dog handler testified the dog was trained to alert to many different controlled\n\nsubstances, not just methamphetamine. In fact, marijuana was found in one of the locations to which\n\nthe dog alerted.\n\n         The evidence of Fulcher\u2019s past and current methamphetamine use could support an inference\n\nthat she had knowledge the broken light bulb and the mirror contained at least a trace of\n\nmethamphetamine. However, the inference holds only if the State demonstrated Fulcher knowingly\n\npossessed those items. \u201c[P]ossession of the container in which the [controlled] substance is found\n\nis not, itself, sufficient to prove a knowing possession.\u201d Joseph, 897 S.W.2d at 377 (Baird, J.,\n\nconcurring). Deputy Harrell testified the light bulb was found in a blue canvas bag in the back of\n\nFulcher\u2019s truck and that the bag also contained women\u2019s undergarments. The State did not present\n\nany other evidence connecting the bag or its contents to Fulcher. Fulcher testified she did not own\n\nthe blue canvas bag, the clothing found in the bag was not hers, and she \u201cdid not recall\u201d the mirror.1\n\n\n         1\n         The majority opinion notes the mirror was found in an \u201copen\u201d glove box. However, the record does not disclose\nwhether the mirror was visible in the glove box.\n\n                                                         -6-\n\fDissenting Opinion                                                                                       04-07-00303-CR\n\nFulcher and her husband both testified that earlier on the day of Fulcher\u2019s arrest, someone named\n\n\u201cNancy\u201d had borrowed the truck to move some of Nancy\u2019s personal belongings.\n\n         The State clearly established two items found in Fulcher\u2019s vehicle contained trace amounts\n\nof methamphetamine. However, the evidence she knowingly possessed those items and she knew\n\nthey contained methamphetamine was far from overwhelming. Fulcher\u2019s evidence joined issue on\n\nwhether she intentionally or knowingly possessed methamphetamine, making the omission of the\n\nmens rea element from the charge more likely to result in harm.\n\n                         The Jury Arguments and Trial Record Trial as a Whole\n\n         The possibility of egregious harm resulting from the failure to properly instruct the jury\n\nwould have been lessened had the attorneys argued to the jury that the mens rea was an element\n\nrequired for conviction.2 But that did not occur.\n\n         In voir dire, the prosecutor told the jury one time that it must prove Fulcher \u201cunlawfully,\n\nintentionally or knowingly\u201d possessed methamphetamine. The jury heard reference to the required\n\nmental state when the indictment was read. The prosecutor mentioned the mens rea element once\n\nin his opening statement to the jury. And, after the evidence closed, the judge read the charge to the\n\njury. These were the only times the jury heard any statement about the mens rea.\n\n\n\n         2\n           See and compare Allen v. State, 253 S.W.3d 260 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (holding defendant was not\negregiously harmed by failure to instruct jury that it must acquit if it had reasonable doubt as to whether victim consented\nto assault while noting that defense counsel had informed the jury of the correct burden in his closing argument), and\nOlivas v. State, 202 S.W.3d 137 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (holding error in failing to instruct jury that State had burden\nto prove deadly weapon issue beyond a reasonable doubt did not result in egregious harm where both State and defense\ncounsel informed jury of correct burden and standard of proof during jury arguments), with Green v. State, 233 S.W.3d\n72 (Tex. App.\u2013Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. ref\u2019d)(holding defendant was egregiously harmed by application\nparagraph of charge that allowed jury to convict if codefendant committed offense without finding defendant guilty as\na party, notwithstanding correct statement of law of parties in abstract portion of charge, where State argued to jury that\ndefendant was guilty of murder based on codefendant\u2019s firing of fired fatal bullet without arguing culpability based on\nlaw of parties).\n\n                                                            -7-\n\fDissenting Opinion                                                                       04-07-00303-CR\n\n        The State did not argue to the jury that it had proved knowing or intentional possession of\n\nmethamphetamine. Instead, the prosecutor essentially told the jury that an \u201cunknowing\u201d possession\n\nwas sufficient to convict. In his opening argument, he referred the jury to the \u201cvoluntary possession\u201d\n\ndefinition of the charge, telling the jury that mere possession, presuming knowledge from length of\n\ntime in the vehicle, was sufficient for conviction:\n\n        I don\u2019t care if somebody else used the truck earlier in the day. Who cares about that?\n        They drove, her and her husband, drove back in that truck all the way from there\n        back to their house to take care of their kids. That truck was in their possession and\n        under their control all during that time period, and then at sometime that evening the\n        Defendant, by her own testimony, all by herself, drives that truck all the way back\n        up here to Bandera County from San Antonio, a good hour drive, stopped and got\n        some gas, got out there to English Crossing, was out there for some period of time.\n        That\u2019s plenty of time to know what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s in your truck . . . .\n\n                The charge there under page 2 says possession is a voluntary act if the\n        possessor knowingly obtains or receives the thing possessed or is aware of her\n        control of the thing for a sufficient time to permit her to terminate her control. You\n        possess stuff that\u2019s in your vehicle and you know about it, bottom line.\n\nThe prosecutor continued to emphasize mere possession and the voluntary possession definition in\n\nhis closing, with no mention of the mens rea requirement:\n\n                The law is, as the Judge has told you, possession means aware of her control\n        of the thing for a sufficient time to permit her to terminate her control. It is actual\n        care, custody, control or management. I don\u2019t know, but \u2013 but in the vehicle I own,\n        if there\u2019s anything in there, I control it because I can pitch it out. If I see something\n        in my vehicle and I think, \u201cHey, that\u2019s not mine. What is it?\u201d, what do we do? We\n        check it out \u2013 right \u2013 especially if we loaned our car out to somebody, which, by the\n        way, you only heard that from Ms. Fulcher and her spouse . . . .\n\n                ....\n\n               A lot of talk here about possession, a lot of talk about it, and I think the thing\n        to focus on is this: If something is in your car, you have control over it. Why?\n        Because it\u2019s in your car. Just like the CDs, the clothing, the floor mat, whatever is\n\n\n\n                                                   -8-\n\fDissenting Opinion                                                                     04-07-00303-CR\n\n        in your car, you can do with it what you want; right? It\u2019s in your car. That is the\n        definition of possession.\n\n                ....\n\n                . . . The only thing they are really arguing over is whether or not the stuff\n        found in the truck was in her possession. Page 1 of the charge, paragraph 2\n        [voluntary possession] , takes care of that right away. She had the ability to control,\n        manage, do anything she wanted with anything in that truck for at least several hours\n        that night, even giving her the benefit of the doubt, even after it got back from\n        whoever she borrowed it to . . . .\n\nFulcher\u2019s trial counsel never mentioned the mens rea requirement in his closing argument. He made\n\nonly an indirect reference when discussing the amount of methamphetamine discovered by the\n\ndeputies:\n\n                Now, if there was 10 pounds of marijuana, 10 pounds of cocaine in the back\n        seat, that\u2019s a deciding difference, but when you have a controlled substance that is\n        under a gram, that according to the chemist, you couldn\u2019t even weigh it, couldn\u2019t\n        even see it, you actually have care, custody, control and management over that,\n        quote, \u201ctrace\u201d?\n\nBased on the trial court\u2019s instruction on voluntary possession and the prosecutor\u2019s arguments to the\n\njury, the jury could easily have concluded it could presume Fulcher had knowledge of the controlled\n\nsubstances from the passage of time.\n\n                                             Conclusion\n\n        A fair reading of the record reflects Fulcher\u2019s defense was that she did not own, was not\n\naware of, and therefore did not possess the drugs with the requisite mens rea. The jury charge did\n\nnot require the jury to find the mens rea be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before it could convict\n\nFulcher, and the prosecutor\u2019s arguments suggested the jury could convict without finding Fulcher\n\nintentionally or knowingly possessed an item she knew to be methamphetamine. Considering the\n\n\n\n                                                  -9-\n\fDissenting Opinion                                                                     04-07-00303-CR\n\ncharge as a whole, the state of the evidence, and the arguments of counsel, the failure to include the\n\nrequirement of an intentional or knowing possession in the application paragraph of the jury charge\n\nvitally affected Fulcher\u2019s only defense. Because I believe this error in the charge egregiously harmed\n\nFulcher, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the cause for a new trial.\n\n\n\n                                               Steven C.
