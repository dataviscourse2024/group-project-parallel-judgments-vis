Kirby,\n                      Defendant-Appellant.                )       Judge Presiding.\n\n\n\n\n       JUSTICE PIERCE delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\n       Presiding Justice Harris and Justice Liu concurred in the judgment and opinion\n\n                                            OPINION\n\n\n\u00b61     Following a jury trial, defendant Kasey Guyton was convicted of second degree murder,\n\nattempted first degree murder, and aggravated discharge of a firearm. In a simultaneous bench\n\ntrial, defendant was convicted of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon. Defendant was\n\nsubsequently sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment for second degree murder and 16 years'\n\nimprisonment for attempted first degree murder with a 20-year mandatory add-on for the\n\npersonal discharge of a weapon, and 6-year concurrent terms for aggravated discharge of a\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nfirearm and unlawful use of a weapon by a felon. On appeal, defendant argues: (1) his\n\nconvictions for second degree murder and attempted first degree murder are inconsistent; (2) the\n\ntrial court improperly limited his presentation of Lynch material (People v. Lynch, 104 Ill. 2d 194\n\n(1984)); (3) his sentence for attempted first degree murder is unconstitutional because it shocks\n\nthe conscience and violates equal protection and due process; (4) his sentence for attempted first\n\ndegree murder is unconstitutional because the firearm add-on imposed is not reasonably related\n\nto the aim of deterring firearm use and thus violates due process; (5) his sentences for attempted\n\nfirst degree murder and second degree murder are excessive; (6) counsel was ineffective for\n\nfailing to request defendant's sentence for attempted first degree murder be reduced based on\n\nprovocation; and (7) his conviction for aggravated discharge of a firearm violates the one-act,\n\none-crime doctrine and should be vacated. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe trial court but vacate defendant\u2019s conviction for aggravated discharge of a firearm.\n\n\u00b62                                    BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63     Defendant was charged by way of indictment with first degree murder, attempted first\n\ndegree murder, aggravated discharge of a firearm, and unlawful use of a weapon by a felon. At\n\ntrial, Edner Flores testified that at 7:30 p.m. on August 22, 2006, he was a passenger in a van\n\nbeing driven by Adam Saldivar, which collided with defendant's Grand Marquis at the\n\nintersection of Leclaire and Augusta in Chicago. Both Saldivar and the driver of the Grand\n\nMarquis, whom Flores identified as defendant, exited their cars. Flores remained in the\n\npassenger seat. Although Flores could hear their voices, he could not hear what Saldivar and\n\ndefendant were saying. He could hear that they were yelling. After a few minutes, Saldivar got\n\nback into the van and they drove south on Leclaire, while defendant returned to his car and drove\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\neast on Augusta.\n\n\u00b64     Saldivar followed several one-way streets to get back around to Augusta. There, he\n\nstopped briefly to assess the damage to the van. Saldivar then drove to the intersection of\n\nAugusta and Lawler, one block east of the initial accident. Saldivar stopped at the stop sign and\n\nthen proceeded through the intersection. Flores then heard six or seven shots but could not tell\n\nwhere they were coming from. He felt a burning sensation in his upper back and looked at\n\nSaldivar. Saldivar appeared to be in \"shock\" and lost control of the van, hitting an oncoming car\n\nand crashing into a brick building.\n\n\u00b65     Flores jumped out of the van and ran toward a young woman on a nearby front porch. He\n\nasked her to call the police. Flores went home, changed his shirt, went to Saldivar's house to tell\n\nSaldivar's family what had happened and returned to the scene with Saldivar's family. Flores\n\nspoke to the police and then went to the police station where he saw a little burn mark in the\n\nmiddle of his back. Flores identified defendant in a photo array and a lineup as the man from the\n\naccident.\n\n\u00b66     David Johnson testified that he lived near the intersection of Augusta and Leclaire and\n\nwas outside at 7:30 p.m. on August 22, 2006. He witnessed a collision between a maroon van\n\nand blue car. He walked toward the scene and heard the drivers of the two vehicles arguing over\n\nwho was at fault. Johnson saw a passenger in the van but the passenger never got out. After\n\nthey were done arguing, the men got into their cars and drove away. Johnson then saw the van\n\nas it returned to the area. As the van made a left turn from Lawler onto Augusta, Johnson saw\n\ndefendant, who was standing by a tree on the southwestern corner of the intersection holding a\n\nsemiautomatic pistol, step out and shoot at the van. He heard four or five shots. The van then\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nstruck another car and crashed into a building. The driver of the van was slumped over the\n\nsteering wheel and the passenger fled west on Augusta. Johnson saw defendant get into a car\n\nand drive east. Johnson had seen defendant in the neighborhood several times and knew that he\n\nlived on the corner of Leclaire and Augusta. Johnson did not see anyone in the van shoot at\n\ndefendant.\n\n\u00b67     Johnson did not talk to the police until three days later, when he flagged down an officer\n\nhe knew. He identified defendant as the shooter in a photo array and in a lineup. Johnson\n\nadmitted that he had three prior convictions for drug offenses and admitted that he was a heroin\n\naddict. He also testified that although he worked as a confidential informant for the police in\n\nother cases, he was not paid in this case.\n\n\u00b68     Eric Smith testified that he knew defendant from the neighborhood and knew that he\n\ndrove a sky blue Grand Marquis. On August 22, 2006, he saw defendant twice at the intersection\n\nof Augusta and Lawler. The first time he saw defendant, defendant pulled up, parked his car, got\n\nout and knocked on the window of a building, got back in his car and drove off. About an hour\n\nlater, Smith saw defendant, who had a young woman in his car, park in the same location. Smith\n\nleft and returned a few minutes later. When he came back, he heard a commotion on the corner.\n\nWhen he approached, he saw that defendant's car had been hit. He heard defendant say, \"this\n\nmotherfucker is going to pay.\" Defendant went into his car and returned with a gun in his hand.\n\nSmith saw defendant walk southbound on Lawler. Defendant stopped, and \"tucked\" himself\n\nbehind a big tree on the corner. Smith saw a maroon van approach the stop sign on the corner\n\nand as the van was about to turn westbound on Leclaire, Smith heard a gunshot from behind the\n\ntree and saw defendant with a gun in his hands. Smith saw defendant bang on the gun and fire\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nseveral more shots. The shots were fired at the passenger side back window of the van. Smith\n\ndid not see anyone in the van point anything out of the window. The van struck another car and\n\ncrashed into a building. The passenger of the van jumped out and ran. He had nothing in his\n\nhands.\n\n\u00b69       Defendant jumped into the passenger side of his car and took off. Smith talked to police\n\non August 30, 2006, after he was stopped by the police when he ran from them. Smith had a\n\nprior felony conviction for delivery of a controlled substance.\n\n\u00b6 10     Eardia Basset was driving eastbound on Augusta at approximately 7:45 p.m. on August\n\n22, 2006. She was on her way to her son's house and her granddaughter sat in the backseat of\n\nher car. As she was about to turn onto Lawler, she heard a \"pow\" and then heard it again. She\n\ntold her granddaughter to get low in the seat. She then saw a van come around the corner, heard\n\nanother shot and saw the van crash into her car on the driver's side.\n\n\u00b6 11     She looked to where she heard the shots coming from and saw defendant standing on the\n\nsoutheast corner of Lawler and Augusta with a gun in his hand, firing at a maroon-colored van.\n\nNeither the driver nor the passenger in the van had a gun, and they were not yelling. The\n\npassenger got out of the van and ran west, then north. Eardia identified defendant as the shooter\n\nin a photo array and in open court.\n\n\u00b6 12     Forensic investigator Donald Fanelli arrived at the scene at about 8:30 p.m. and took\n\nvideo and photographs of the area. Investigator Fanelli observed a white painted tree on Lawler\n\nand saw four fired cartridge cases and a live unfired bullet on the ground by the tree. All five\n\ncartridges were Winchester 9 millimeter Luger. He also observed a bullet hole in the house on\n\nthe corner of Lawler and Augusta, as well as a hole in the fence.\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\n\u00b6 13   Investigator Fanelli also observed that the window on the passenger side of the maroon\n\nvan was broken and that Saldivar was still inside the van, lying between the seats. A baseball bat\n\nwas found under the front passenger seat of the van. A bullet was recovered from the back of the\n\nfront passenger seat.\n\n\u00b6 14   Detective Anthony Noradin arrived at the scene and saw Saldivar lying in the front seat\n\nof the van. On August 25, 2006, Detective Noradin showed Eardia Bassett and Edner Flores a\n\nphoto array and both witnesses identified defendant. Bassett, Flores, Smith and Johnson all\n\nidentified defendant from lineups.\n\n\u00b6 15   Assistant Cook County Medical Examiner Michel Humilier conducted an autopsy on\n\nSaldivar on August 23, 2006, and observed an irregular gunshot wound entrance to the back of\n\ndefendant's head. Dr. Humilier opined that the cause of death was a gunshot wound and the\n\nmanner of death was homicide.\n\n\u00b6 16   Defendant's girlfriend Stephanie Sims testified that defendant arrived at her apartment in\n\nCalumet City between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. on August 22, 2006. He drove his Mercury Marquis.\n\nAfter defendant spent the night, Sims drove defendant to work in the morning because his car\n\nhad a flat tire. Defendant's car remained in the parking lot.\n\n\u00b6 17   On September 1, 2006, she found a gun under some mattresses in the second bedroom of\n\nher apartment. Sims put the gun in a plastic bag and called police. When officers arrived, Sims\n\ngave written consent for officers to search her apartment. The officers recovered the loaded\n\nBeretta 9 millimeter black handgun that Sims had found. The weapon and nine bullets were\n\ninventoried the following day by Chicago police. Chicago police detective DeSalvo also\n\nobserved a blue Mercury Marquis in the parking lot of Sims' apartment building and had the\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nvehicle towed.\n\n\u00b6 18   Marc Pomerance, a firearm and tool expert, examined the firearm recovered, and after\n\ntest firing the weapon, concluded that all four fired cartridge cases recovered at the scene were\n\nfired from the weapon recovered from Stephanie Sims' apartment.\n\n\u00b6 19   The State rested. Defendant's motion for a directed verdict was denied.\n\n\u00b6 20    Defendant testified that on August 23, 2006, he lived with his mother at 5105 West\n\nAugusta and owned a blue Grand Marquis. He had taken his son Maliek to get something to eat\n\nand as they approached the intersection of Augusta and Leclaire going east, a van turned right in\n\nfront of him and they collided. The passenger, who was hanging out of the van's window and the\n\ndriver of the van, told him to \"pull the fuck over.\"\n\n\u00b6 21   Defendant and the driver of the van got out of their vehicles. Defendant testified that the\n\nvan\u2019s driver said, \"[w]here the fuck you come from? I didn't see you.\" The van's driver told\n\ndefendant that the collision was defendant's fault and the two men argued. The van's driver was\n\nstanding in a fighting stance. Defendant told the driver that he had insurance and the driver\n\nshould call the police. While they were arguing, Flores got out of the van and started yelling at\n\ndefendant. Flores told defendant that he caused the accident and pulled a black gun out from his\n\nshirt. Flores told defendant that either defendant would pay or Flores would take his car. Flores\n\nrepeated that statement a second time.\n\n\u00b6 22   Saldivar and Flores got back into the van but told defendant, \"[t]his shit ain't over with,\n\non nation\" and that they were coming back. Saldivar drove off. Defendant took his son to his\n\nmother's house and parked his car on Augusta and Lawler. He took his gun from his car and\n\nbegan to walk home. As he was walking, he saw Saldivar's van approaching and feared the van\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nwould hit him so he walked south on Lawler. When he was near a tree, he saw Flores reach\n\ndown with his right arm. As Flores put his arm back up, defendant fired his gun at the van.\n\nDefendant testified that he thought Flores was going to shoot him. After he shot into the van, he\n\nran to his car and drove to his girlfriend's house in Calumet City. He spent the night and left his\n\ngun there.\n\n\u00b6 23   On cross-examination, defendant admitted that he had told police that he had not been in\n\nan accident.\n\n\u00b6 24   Pursuant to People v. Lynch, 104 Ill. 2d 194 (1984), Flores was recalled in defendant's\n\ncase in chief. Flores testified that he was convicted of battery in 2009. In May 2005, Flores was\n\noutside of a gas station putting his son in a car seat when a car pulled in quickly and almost hit\n\nhim. A man got out of the car and came directly at Flores. Flores punched him in the face,\n\nknocking the man to the ground. Flores testified that he did not know the man was blind. He\n\nwas subsequently arrested by the case was ultimately dismissed.\n\n\u00b6 25   Aaron Pawlow, the blind man that Flores punched, testified that his was considered\n\nlegally blind but did have partial vision in one eye. He testified that on May 14, 2005, he was\n\nwith his 82-year-old mother, who was trying to pull into a parking spot in a gas station when she\n\nsaid that someone was standing too close to the spot. His mother spoke to the person through her\n\nopen car window and asked him to move over so she could pull in. That person was later\n\nidentified as Edner Flores. Flores responded that she had plenty of room. His mother felt\n\nuncomfortable so she asked Flores to move again. The third time she asked, Flores started\n\nscreaming at her. Pawlow got out of the car, tried to unfold his cane, and walked up to Flores.\n\nPawlow told Flores that he was blind and then felt something hit him on the head. Pawlow fell\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nto the ground and Flores sat on his chest and punched him in the eye. Pawlow was treated at the\n\nhospital for a hemorrhage in his eye.\n\n\u00b6 26   Isaias Casteneda also testified also pursuant to Lynch. On June 9, 1997, he was in a car\n\nof several people when a car pulled up next to them and a guy named \"Low Rider\" got out and\n\nstarted shooting at them. Castaneda could not remember \"Low Rider's\" name and when defense\n\ncounsel showed Casteneda a picture, the court sustained the State's objection. Defendant was\n\nunable to establish that Saldivar was \"Low Rider.\"\n\n\u00b6 27   Defendant then introduced a certified copy of Adam Saldivar's conviction for aggravated\n\ndischarge of a firearm in October 1997 and a certified copy of Edner Flores' conviction for\n\nbattery causing bodily harm in May 2009.\n\n\u00b6 28   In rebuttal, the State played a portion of the videotape of defendant's interrogation\n\nfollowing his arrest. In that portion of the videotape, defendant denied being involved in a car\n\naccident on August 22, 2006, and stated that his car was in the shop on that date. The State\n\npresented a certified copy of a vehicle record showing a 1990 Mercury registered to defendant.\n\n\u00b6 29   Following deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of second degree murder,\n\nattempted first degree murder, and aggravated discharge of a firearm. The jury found that\n\ndefendant had personally discharged a firearm during the attempted murder. Defendant was also\n\nfound guilty of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon. Defendant was sentenced to a total of 54\n\nyears\u2019 imprisonment. It is from this judgment that defendant now appeals.\n\n\u00b6 30                                     ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 31                               I. One Act, One Crime\n\n\u00b6 32   Defendant argues that because all of the charges arose from his shooting into the van and\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nthe State did not differentiate between the different shots fired, his conviction for aggravated\n\ndischarge of a firearm should be vacated because it violates the one-act, one-crime rule. The\n\nState agrees and responds that although defendant committed a series of closely related but\n\nseparate acts when he fired five shots at the van, the State did not apportion those shots in the\n\nindictments so that each formed the basis of a separate offense.\n\n\u00b6 33   Under the one-act one-crime rule, multiple convictions arising out of a single physical act\n\nare prohibited. People v. King, 66 Ill. 2d 551 (1977). We therefore vacate defendant's\n\nconviction for aggravated discharge of a firearm. People v. Garcia, 179 Ill. 2d 55, 71 (1997)\n\n(under the one-act, one-crime rule, a sentence should be imposed on the more serious offense\n\nand the conviction on the less serious offense should be vacated).\n\n\u00b6 34                                    II. Verdicts\n\n\u00b6 35   Defendant argues that the jury verdicts in this case reflect that defendant thought he was\n\nacting in self-defense when he committed the shooting. Therefore, he could not have the\n\nrequisite intent to be convicted of both attempted first degree murder and second degree murder\n\nand his attempted first degree murder conviction must be vacated.\n\n\u00b6 36   The standard of review on a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is whether, after\n\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could\n\nhave found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. People v. Ross, 229\n\nIll. 2d 255, 272 (2008). It is not the function of the reviewing court to retry the defendant or\n\nsubstitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact. People v. Collins, 214 Ill. 2d 206, 217 (2005).\n\nThe trier of fact assesses the credibility of the witnesses, determines the appropriate weight of the\n\ntestimony and resolves conflicts or inconsistencies in the evidence. People v. Naylor, 229 Ill. 2d\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\n584, 614 (2008). The trier of fact is not required to disregard inferences that flow from the\n\nevidence or search out all possible explanations consistent with innocence and raise them to a\n\nlevel of reasonable doubt. People v. Hall, 194 Ill. 2d 305, 332 (2000). A criminal conviction\n\nwill not be set aside unless the evidence is so improbable or unsatisfactory that it creates a\n\nreasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt. People v. Siguenza-Brito, 235 Ill. 2d 213, 225 (2009).\n\nDefendant's conviction will not be reversed on review simply because he claims a witness was\n\nnot credible or the evidence was contradictory. Id. at 228.\n\n\u00b6 37   Defendant was charged with the first degree murder of Adam Saldivar and attempted first\n\ndegree murder of Edner Flores. To sustain a conviction for first degree murder the State must\n\nprove that a defendant killed an individual without lawful justification and in performing the acts\n\nwhich caused the death, he intended to kill or do great bodily harm or knew that his acts created\n\na strong probability of death or great bodily harm to that individual. 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(1), (a)(2)\n\n(West 2006). Once the State has proven all of the elements of first degree murder, the burden\n\nshifts to the defendant who wishes to mitigate the offense to second degree murder, to prove the\n\nexistence of one of the statutory mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence. See 720\n\nILCS 5/9-2(c) (West 2006); People v. Lopez, 166 Ill. 2d 441, 447 (1995).\n\n\u00b6 38   First degree murder may be reduced to second degree murder when either of the\n\nfollowing mitigating factors is present:\n\n               \u201c(1) [Provocation] At the time of the killing he is acting under a sudden and\n\n       intense passion resulting from serious provocation by the individual killed or another\n\n       whom the offender endeavors to kill, but he negligently or accidentally causes the death\n\n       of the individual killed; or\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\n               (2) [Imperfect self-defense] At the time of the killing he believes the\n\n       circumstances to be such that, if they existed, would justify or exonerate the killing under\n\n       the principles stated in Article 7 of this Code [Justifiable Use of Force; Exoneration], but\n\n       his belief is unreasonable.\u201d 720 ILCS 5/9-2(a)(1), (a)(2) (West 2006).\n\n\u00b6 39   In this case, defendant argued that the first degree murder of Adam Saldivar should be\n\nmitigated to second degree murder because he acted in self-defense. The jury agreed.\n\nSecond degree murder is a \"lesser mitigated offense\" of first degree murder and is distinguished\n\nfrom self-defense only in terms of the nature of the defendant\u2019s belief at the time of the killing.\n\n(Emphasis omitted.) People v. Jeffries, 164 Ill. 2d 104, 122 (1995) (citing People v. Newbern,\n\n219 Ill. App. 3d 333, 353 (1991)). If the defendant\u2019s belief at the time of the killing was\n\nreasonable, self-defense may apply; if the defendant\u2019s belief was unreasonable, a conviction for\n\nsecond degree murder may be appropriate. People v. Hooker, 249 Ill. App. 3d 394, 403 (1993).\n\nHere, the jury found defendant's belief in the need for self-defense to be unreasonable and\n\nconvicted him of second degree murder.\n\n\u00b6 40   Guyton was also charged with the attempted first degree murder of Flores. To be\n\nconvicted of attempt, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the intent to commit a\n\nspecific offense, in this case first degree murder. 720 ILCS 5/8-4(a) (West 2006). Defendant\n\nclaims that no reasonable argument exists that his mental state changed between when he fired\n\nthe bullet that hit and killed Saldivar, which resulted in a second degree murder conviction, and\n\nwhen he fired the bullet that hit and injured Flores, which resulted in an attempted murder\n\nconviction. In short, defendant argues that he cannot have had an unreasonable belief in the need\n\nfor self-defense as to Saldivar, but not as to Flores.\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\n\u00b6 41   There is no difference between the mental states required to prove attempted first degree\n\nmurder and second degree murder. First degree murder and second degree murder share the\n\nsame elements, including the same mental states, but second degree murder requires the presence\n\nof a mitigating circumstance. Jeffries, 164 Ill. 2d at 121-22. The presence of a mitigating factor\n\ndoes not negate the mental state of murder because mitigating factors are not elements of the\n\ncrime. Jeffries, 164 Ill. 2d at 121.\n\n\u00b6 42   In People v. Lopez, 166 Ill. 2d 441 (1995), our supreme court held that the offense of\n\nattempted second degree murder does not exist in Illinois because:\n\n       \u201c[T]he crime of attempted second degree murder would require the intent to commit the\n\n       specific offense of second degree murder. Thus, the intent required for attempted second\n\n       degree murder, if it existed, would be the intent to kill without lawful justification, plus\n\n       the intent to have a mitigating circumstance present. However, one cannot intend either a\n\n       sudden and intense passion due to serious provocation or an unreasonable belief in the\n\n       need to use deadly force. Moreover, concerning the mitigating factor of an imperfect self-\n\n       defense, one cannot intend to unlawfully kill while at the same time intending to\n\n       justifiably use deadly force. Thus, the offense of attempted second degree murder does\n\n       not exist in this State.\u201d Id. at 448-49.\n\n\u00b6 43   Writing separately, Justice McMorrow predicted the precise conundrum presented here:\n\nabsent a crime of attempted second degree murder, a defendant could be punished more severely\n\nif the victim lives than if the victim dies. Id. at 452-53 (McMorrow, J., concurring in part and\n\ndissenting in part, joined by Bilandic, C.J.) (quoting Timothy P. O\u2019Neill, \u201cWith Malice Toward\n\nNone\u201d: A Solution to an Illinois Homicide Quandary, 32 DePaul L. Rev. 107, 107-08 (1982)).\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nDespite Justice McMorrow's prescience, the majority rejected a state constitutional challenge to\n\nthe sentencing differential where a victim dies and where the victim survives and suggested that\n\nany changes to the attempt statute to allow attempt second degree murder would have to\n\noriginate with the legislature. Id. at 450.\n\n\u00b6 44      Almost 15 years after Lopez, the legislature addressed the sentencing disparity addressed\n\nby Justice Mc Morrow, but only with respect to serious provocation by adding subsection 8-\n\n4(c)(1)(E) (see Pub. Act 96-710 (eff. Jan. 1, 2010) (adding 720 ILCS 5/8-4(c)(1)(E))) which\n\nstates:\n\n          \u201c[I]f the defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence at sentencing that, at the\n\n          time of the attempted murder, he or she was acting under a sudden and intense passion\n\n          resulting from serious provocation by the individual whom the defendant endeavored to\n\n          kill, or another, and, had the individual the defendant endeavored to kill died, the\n\n          defendant would have negligently or accidentally caused that death, then the sentence for\n\n          the attempted murder is the sentence for a Class 1 felony.\u201d 720 ILCS 5/8-4(c)(1)(E)\n\n          (West 2010).\n\n\u00b6 45      The legislature could have easily addressed the issue of whether imperfect self-defense\n\nwould be a mitigating factor in an attempted murder situation by adding such language when it\n\nmade the above amendment, but chose not to. The legislature is presumed to know of judicial\n\ninterpretation of statutes; thus, its inaction suggests agreement with the judicial interpretation of\n\nLopez (In re May 1991 Will County Grand Jury, 152 Ill. 2d 381, 388 (1992); People v. Agnew,\n\n105 Ill. 2d 275, 280 (1985)) and further suggests a decision not to provide a mitigating factor of\n\nimperfect self-defense to attempted second degree murder. Should our presumption be incorrect\n\n\n\n                                                   14\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nthe legislature again has the opportunity to consider whether subsection 8-4(c)(1)(E) should be\n\namended to allow proof of imperfect self-defense as a basis for mitigation of a sentence for the\n\ncrime of attempted murder.\n\n\u00b6 46   The jury's verdict on second degree murder in this case indeed shows that it found\n\ndefendant acted under the unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense as to Saldivar.\n\nBecause there is no offense of attempted second degree murder, the jury could not be instructed\n\nand could not find the defendant guilty of attempted second degree murder of Flores based on the\n\nsame unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense. In other words, because the defendant did\n\nnot actually kill Flores, the legislature determined he could not lawfully mitigate his attempt to\n\nmurder him because he had the same unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense.\n\nDefendant's mental state at the time of performing the act giving rise to the attempted murder of\n\nFlores and the second degree murder of Saldivar were the same. The evidence established, and\n\nthe jury found, the intent required to sustain an attempted first degree murder conviction. The\n\ndetermination by the jury that mitigating circumstances existed to allow for a conviction of a\n\nlesser second degree murder offense because of defendant's unreasonable belief in the need to\n\ndefend does not invalidate the attempted murder conviction. Consequently, defendant's\n\nargument fails and his conviction for attempted first degree murder stands.\n\n\u00b6 47                                III. Lynch Evidence\n\n\u00b6 48   Defendant argues that the trial court denied him his right to present a defense by limiting\n\nand delaying his use of Lynch evidence. Although trial court allowed defendant to introduce the\n\nprior violent acts by the two victims pursuant to Lynch, 104 Ill. 2d 194, the court ruled that the\n\nevidence could only be brought in during the defense case and could not be elaborated on in\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nopening statements. Defendant argues that these limitations robbed important defense evidence\n\nof its power, amounting to reversible error.\n\n\u00b6 49    In Lynch, our supreme court held that when a defendant raises self-defense as a theory in\n\nhis case, evidence showing the victim's aggressive and violent character is relevant to show: (1)\n\nthe defendant's knowledge of the victim's violent tendencies affected his perceptions of and\n\nreactions to the victim's behavior; or (2) to support the defendant's version of the facts when\n\nthere are conflicting versions of events. Id. at 200. \u201cUnder the first approach, evidence is\n\nrelevant only if the defendant knew of the victim's violent acts. Under the second approach, the\n\ndefendant's knowledge is irrelevant.\u201d People v. Nunn, 357 Ill. App. 3d 625, 631 (2005).\n\n\u00b6 50    The question of whether defendant could present evidence of Saldivar's and Flores's prior\n\naggressive behavior under Lynch was litigated extensively prior to, during, and after trial. In a\n\npretrial motion, defense counsel indicated that defendant would raise a claim of self-defense at\n\ntrial. Counsel moved to admit six prior acts by Saldivar and Flores to prove that the men were\n\nthe aggressors. The court allowed four of the acts, including Flores's 2005 battery of a blind\n\nman. During trial, the court also allowed Flores's separate 2009 battery conviction. However,\n\nthe court prevented defendant from admitting any evidence of self-defense in the State's case in\n\nchief. The court stated, \"[i]f [defendant] testifies at self-defense [sic], then it's opened up and all\n\nthose prior bad acts come in.\" The court also limited reference to Lynch material during opening\n\nstatements and barred the defense from mentioning \"specific facts\" about the acts.\n\n\u00b6 51    No issue has been raised regarding whether the Lynch evidence introduced in this case\n\nwas proper. The issue is whether the trial court erred when it ruled that the defense had to bring\n\nup the issue of self-defense in its case in chief before any Lynch evidence could be introduced.\n\n\n\n                                                   16\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\n\u00b6 52    A plain reading of Lynch establishes that the introduction of Lynch evidence is not proper\n\nuntil a defendant introduces evidence of self-defense. Lynch, 104 Ill. 2d at 204 (\u201ca defendant\n\nmay not introduce evidence of the victim's character until some evidence has been presented that\n\nthe victim was, or appeared to be, the assailant, and that the defendant therefore acted in self-\n\ndefense\u201d); see also Nunn, 357 Ill. App. 3d at 631. The reason for the rule is to ensure that such\n\ncharacter evidence is not admitted unless self-defense is at issue in the case. People v. Allen, 50\n\nIll. 2d 280, 284 (1972). In some instances Lynch evidence may be properly admitted prior to the\n\ndefense's case in chief; however, \"[t]he order of proof is within the discretion of the trial judge,\n\nwho, in the interest of convenience and efficiency, might properly [decide] to allow the proof out\n\nof the usual order.\" Lynch, 104 Ill. 2d at 205. There is no indication in this case that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion in choosing to limit the order of proof. We therefore cannot find that\n\nthe trial court erred in preventing Lynch evidence from being presented prior to the defense's\n\ncase in chief.\n\n\u00b6 53                IV. 20-Year Add-On Violates Due Process and Equal Protection\n\n\u00b6 54    Defendant argues that the 36-year sentence he received for attempted first degree murder,\n\nwhich included a 20-year add-on because he personally discharged a firearm during the offense,\n\nis unconstitutional. Specifically, defendant argues that his sentence for attempted murder is\n\nunconstitutional because it shocks the conscience to punish an attempted killing more severely\n\nthan the completed offense of first degree murder and the harsher treatment of an inchoate\n\noffense also renders the sentence unreasonable, violating principles of equal protection and due\n\nprocess.\n\n\u00b6 55    We begin with the presumption that all statutes are constitutional. People v. Sharpe, 216\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nIll. 2d 481, 487 (2005). As a result of this presumption, the party challenging the\n\nconstitutionality of a statute bears the burden of demonstrating that a constitutional violation\n\nexists. Id. Great deference is given to the legislature's determination of the seriousness of\n\nvarious offenses and the sentences that the legislature has deemed appropriate for those offenses.\n\nId. We review the question of whether a statute is constitutional de novo. Id. at 846-47.\n\n\u00b6 56   The proportionate penalties clause provides that \"[a]ll penalties shall be determined both\n\naccording to the seriousness of the offense and with the objective of restoring the offender to\n\nuseful citizenship.\u201d Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a7 11. In assessing an alleged proportionate penalties\n\nviolation, we must determine whether the penalty at issue has been set by the legislature\n\naccording to the seriousness of the offense. Sharpe, 216 Ill. 2d at 487. There are currently two\n\nways to determine whether a penalty will violate the proportionate penalties clause: (1) whether\n\nthe penalty is cruel, degrading, or so wholly disproportionate to the offense committed as to\n\nshock the moral sense of the community; and (2) whether offenses with identical elements are\n\ngiven different sentences. Sharpe, 216 Ill. 2d at 517, 521.\n\n\u00b6 57   Defendant's challenge, made pursuant to the first test, is that the sentence imposed for\n\nattempted murder in this case, 16 years' imprisonment plus a 20-year add-on because he used a\n\nfirearm for a total of 36 years' imprisonment, violates due process and is grossly disproportionate\n\nto the offense, especially considering that his sentence for attempted murder was twice the\n\nsentence he received for actually killing Saldivar. Defendant claims \"[i]t offends any sense of\n\nproportionality to impose twice the punishment on an offender for a victim who sustained a\n\nminor injury than for a victim who was killed.\"\n\n\u00b6 58   Effective January 1, 2000, the legislature enacted Public Act 91-404. The purpose was\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\n\u201cto deter the use of firearms in the commission of a felony offense.\u201d Pub. Act 91-404, \u00a7 5 (eff.\n\nJan. 1, 2000) (adding 720 ILCS 5/33A-1(b)(1)). Intending to deter the use of dangerous weapons\n\nand firearms during the commission of a felony offense, the legislature increased the penalties\n\nfor certain offenses when the offender is armed with a dangerous weapon other than a firearm,\n\npossesses a firearm, discharges a firearm, and discharges a firearm that causes great bodily harm,\n\npermanent disability, disfigurement or death. These additional penalties are commonly referred\n\nto as \u201c15/20/25-to-life\u201d sentencing provisions. People v. Moss, 206 Ill. 2d 503, 506 (2003).\n\n\u00b6 59      Our supreme court in People v. Morgan, 203 Ill. 2d 470, 488 (2003), ruled that it is\n\nneither cruel nor degrading, nor would it shock the moral sense of the community, to apply the\n\n15/20/25-to-life enhancements to attempted first degree murder. Subsequently in Sharpe, the\n\ncourt affirmed its holding in Morgan with respect to the 15/20/25-to-life enhancements and\n\nstated:\n\n          \"We conclude that it would not shock the conscience of the community to learn that the\n\n          legislature has determined that an additional penalty ought to be imposed when murder is\n\n          committed with a weapon that not only enhances the perpetrator's ability to kill the\n\n          intended victim, but also increases the risk that grievous harm or death will be inflicted\n\n          upon bystanders. See Morgan, 203 Ill. 2d at 488\u201389; Hill, 199 Ill.v2d at 452\u201353,\n\n          (rejecting 'shock the conscience' challenge to Public Act 91\u2013404 enhancements to home\n\n          invasion).\" Sharpe, 216 Ill. 2d at 525.\n\n\u00b6 60      In Lopez, 166 Ill. 2d 441, the defendant argued that because Illinois does not recognize\n\nthe crime of attempted second degree murder, it was a possibility that a defendant would be\n\nsentenced to a greater term of imprisonment if the victim lived than if the victim died. Lopez\n\n\n\n                                                    19\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nargued that had he actually killed his wife and the jury believed he acted under a sudden and\n\nintense passion due to serious provocation, he would have been guilty of second degree murder,\n\na Class 1 felony that was punishable by a term of imprisonment ranging from 4 to 15 years (720\n\nILCS 5/9-2(d) (West 1992); 730 ILCS 5/5-8-1(a)(4) (West 1992)), instead of attempted first\n\ndegree murder that was a Class X felony punishable by a term of imprisonment ranging from 6\n\nto 30 years. Lopez argued that this possibility violated the Illinois Constitution's requirement\n\nthat \u201c[a]ll penalties *** be determined *** according to the seriousness of the offense.\u201d Ill.\n\nConst. 1970, art. I, \u00a7 11. Lopez, 166 Ill. 2d 441.\n\n\u00b6 61   However, the majority rejected the challenge finding the disparity in sentencing not to be\n\ncruel, degrading or so wholly disproportionate as to shock the moral sense of the community and\n\ntherefore did not violate due process, despite Justice McMorrow's separate opinion. Lopez, 166\n\nIll. 2d at 452 (quoting O'Neill, \u201cWith Malice Toward None\u201d: A Solution to an Illinois Homicide\n\nQuandary, 32 DePaul L. Rev. 107, 107-08 (1982) (McMorrow, J., concurring in part and\n\ndissenting in part, joined by Bilandic, C.J.)). The Lopez court suggested that any changes to the\n\nstatus of attempted second degree murder in Illinois would have to originate with the legislature.\n\nId. at 450. As previously discussed, in the almost 20 years since Lopez, the legislature has not\n\nmade any amendments to the attempted murder statute to allow a defendant to mitigate the crime\n\nbased on an unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense, despite the fact that the legislature\n\namended section 8-4(c)(1)(E) in 2010 allowing for defendants convicted of attempted murder to\n\nprove at sentencing, by preponderance of the evidence, that the mitigating factor of provocation\n\nwas present, so as to reduce the class of offense from a Class X offense to a Class 1 offense. 720\n\nILCS 5/8-4(c)(1)(E) (West 2010). The legislature's inaction suggests agreement with the judicial\n\n\n\n                                                     20\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\ninterpretation of Lopez. In re May 1991 Will County Grand Jury, 152 Ill. 2d at 388; Agnew, 105\n\nIll. 2d at 280.\n\n\u00b6 62    In accordance with Morgan, Sharpe and Lopez, we hold that the alleged disparity in\n\nsentencing range between defendant\u2019s sentence for attempted first degree murder and second\n\ndegree murder is not cruel, degrading, or so wholly disproportionate to the offense committed as\n\nto shock the moral sense of the community and therefore does not violate due process.\n\n\u00b6 63    Defendant next claims that his sentence for attempted murder violates equal protection by\n\nimposing a harsher sentence than defendant would have received had he killed Flores.\n\n\u00b6 64    Equal protection requires that similarly situated individuals will be treated in a similar\n\nmanner. People v. Reed, 148 Ill. 2d 1, 7 (1992). The equal protection clauses of the United\n\nStates and Illinois Constitutions do not deny the State the power to draw lines that treat different\n\nclasses of people differently, but prohibits the State from according unequal treatment to persons\n\nplaced by a statute into different classes for reasons wholly unrelated to the purpose of the\n\nlegislation. People v. Shephard, 152 Ill. 2d 489, 499 (1992). To state a cause of action for a\n\nviolation of equal protection, a plaintiff must allege that there are other people similarly situated\n\nto him, that these people are treated differently than him, and that there is no rational basis for\n\nthis differentiation. See Safanda v. Zoning Board of Appeals, 203 Ill. App. 3d 687, 695 (1990);\n\naccord Kaczka v. Retirement Board of the Policemen's Annuity & Benefit Fund, 398 Ill. App. 3d\n\n702, 707-08 (2010).    A court uses the same analysis in assessing equal protection claims under\n\nboth the state and federal constitutions. Reed, 148 Ill. 2d at 7.\n\n\u00b6 65    The legislative classification at issue determines the level of scrutiny to be applied when\n\nanalyzing legislation under equal protection. Classifications based on race or national origin or\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\naffecting fundamental rights are strictly scrutinized. McLean v. Department of Revenue, 184 Ill.\n\n2d 341, 354 (1998). When the legislative classification does not implicate a suspect\n\nclassification or a fundamental right, rational basis review is employed. Shephard, 152 Ill. 2d at\n\n500. Under the rational basis test, the challenged statute must bear a rational relationship to the\n\npurpose the legislature intended to achieve by enacting it. Id.\n\n\u00b6 66   Defendant is not a member of a suspect class. \u201c[E]qual protection analysis requires strict\n\nscrutiny of a legislative classification only when the classification impermissibly interferes with\n\nthe exercise of a fundamental right or operates to the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 312 (1976). Accordingly, we\n\nemploy the rational basis test.\n\n\u00b6 67   Under the rational basis test, a statutory classification need only bear a rational\n\nrelationship to a legitimate state goal. Reed, 148 Ill. 2d at 7-8. More specifically, we are\n\ncharged with determining, \" 'whether the statute is reasonably designed to remedy the evils\n\nwhich the legislature has determined to be a threat to the public health, safety and general\n\nwelfare.' \" People v. Bradley, 79 Ill. 2d 410, 417 (1980) (quoting Heimgaertner v. Benjamin\n\nElectric Manufacturing Co., 6 Ill. 2d 152, 159 (1955)). Only if the statute withstands this test\n\ncan it be upheld. Reed, 148 Ill. 2d at 7-8.\n\n\u00b6 68   However, before we can reach the ultimate question of whether the complained of statute\n\nviolates the equal protection clause, we must first determine whether respondent is similarly\n\nsituated to the comparison group. People v. Whitfield, 228 Ill. 2d 502, 513 (2007). When a party\n\nfails to make this showing, his equal protection challenge must fail. Id.\n\n\u00b6 69   Without explanation other than to say that \"a defendant who shoots and kills a person\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nwith intent to kill and an unreasonable belief in self-defense receives a far less harsh sentence\n\nthat one who fails to kill,\" defendant argues that principles of equal protection were violated.\n\nWe agree with the State that defendant has failed to indentify a suspect class or identify others\n\nconvicted of attempted first degree murder that have been treated unequally under the law.\n\nTherefore, defendant has not established that his sentence for attempted first degree murder was\n\ndisproportionate to the offense or that his guarantee of equal protection was violated.\n\n\u00b6 70                             V. Deterring the Use of Firearms\n\n\u00b6 71    Defendant next argues that his sentence for attempted first degree murder is\n\nunconstitutional because the firearm add-on imposed is not reasonably related to the aim of\n\ndeterring firearm use and thus violates due process. In support of his argument defendant cites\n\nPeople v. Alejos, 97 Ill. 2d 502 (1983).\n\n\u00b6 72    We begin by noting that defendant did not raise this specific challenge to the\n\nconstitutionality of the firearm add-on statute in the trial court or in his posttrial motion, but a\n\nchallenge to the constitutionality of a statute can be raised at any time. People v. Spencer, 2012\n\nIL App (1st) 102094, \u00b6 23.\n\n\u00b6 73    In Alejos, the defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and armed violence\n\nbased on voluntary manslaughter and argued that armed violence could not be predicated on\n\nvoluntary manslaughter. At the time of the offenses, the armed violence statute made it a Class\n\nX felony to commit any felony under Illinois law while armed with a dangerous weapon such as\n\na handgun, knife or bludgeon. See Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 38, \u00b6 33A-1 et seq.\n\n\u00b6 74    The court found that the \"stiff punishment mandated by the armed violence provision\n\n[was] intended not only to punish the criminal and protect society from him but also to deter his\n\n\n\n                                                   23\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nconduct-that of carrying the weapon while committing a felony.\" Alejos, 97 Ill. 2d at 509. With\n\nthat in mind, the court found that because voluntary manslaughter was not a premeditated crime\n\nbut was committed \"on the spur of the moment,\" it was not likely to be deterred by the armed\n\nviolence provisions punishing those offenses more severely. Therefore, armed violence could\n\nnot be predicated on voluntary manslaughter. Id.\n\n\u00b6 75     Defendant attempts to use the framework of Alejos to support his claim here. Defendant\n\nmaintains that that the analysis in Alejos is dispositive in this case because both the attempted\n\nmurder of Flores and the killing in Alejos were accompanied by a mitigating fact. Defendant\n\nurges:\n\n         \"The purpose of the armed violence statute and the firearm add-ons are the same, to deter\n\n         the usage of firearms in certain named felonies. [Citations omitted]. There is thus no\n\n         daylight between the analysis in Alejos and the one in this case. The add-on could not\n\n         logically deter the use of a firearm in an attempted killing done with an unreasonable\n\n         belief in self-defense, as it does not in second degree murder. \"\n\n\u00b6 76     As previously discussed, the legislature enacted Public Act 91-404 for the purpose of\n\ndeterring the use of firearms in the commission of a felony offense. Pub. Act 91-404, \u00a75 (eff.\n\nJan. 1, 2000) (adding 720 ILCS 5/33A-1(b)(1)). In an effort to deter the use of firearms during\n\nthe commission of a felony offense, the legislature increased the penalties for certain offenses\n\nwhen the offender is armed with a dangerous weapon other than a firearm, possesses a firearm,\n\ndischarges a firearm, and discharges a firearm that causes great bodily harm, permanent\n\ndisability, disfigurement or death. Moss, 206 Ill. 2d at 506.\n\n\u00b6 77     Contrary to defendant's argument, we find sufficient \"daylight\" between the analysis in\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nAlejos and the facts in this case to find the 20-year add on in this case reasonably related to the\n\nevil targeted by the legislature. After Alejos, the legislature in 1986 replaced the offense of\n\nvoluntary manslaughter with the offense of second degree murder where either provocation or\n\nimperfect self-dense is established. People v. Shumpert, 126 Ill. 2d 344, 348 (1989). In\n\nenacting the second degree murder statute the legislature addressed the elements of the offense\n\nand did not deal with the sentencing enhancements. The legislature has determined that the\n\nsentencing add-on mandated under section 5/33A-1(b)(1) applies in certain instances where\n\nfirearms are involved without consideration of whether mitigating factors of provocation or\n\nimperfect self-defense exist. Defendant has advanced no compelling reason within a due process\n\nframework that convinces this court that an unconstitutional sentence has been imposed in this\n\ncase. Unlike the voluntary manslaughter in Alejos, defendant's attempted murder of Flores\n\ncannot be mitigated by consideration of defendant's second degree murder conviction to avoid\n\nthe mandatory sentence enhancement imposed by the trial court.\n\n\u00b6 78                                 VI. Excessive Sentence\n\n\u00b6 79   Defendant contends that his 18-year sentence for second degree murder and 36-year\n\nsentence for attempted murder are excessive given his great potential for rehabilitation and other\n\nmitigating factors.\n\n\u00b6 80   A trial court has broad discretionary powers in choosing the appropriate sentence a\n\ndefendant should receive. People v. Jones, 168 Ill. 2d 367, 373 (1995). A reasoned judgment as\n\nto the proper sentence to be imposed must be based upon the particular circumstances of each\n\nindividual case and depends upon many factors, including the defendant's credibility, demeanor,\n\ngeneral moral character, mentality, social environment, habits and age. People v. Perruquet, 68\n\n\n\n                                                  25\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nIll. 2d 149, 154 (1977). \"In determining an appropriate sentence, the defendant's history,\n\ncharacter, rehabilitative potential, the seriousness of the offense, the need to protect society and\n\nthe need for deterrence and punishment must be equally weighed.\" People v. Jones, 295 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 444, 455 (1998). There is a strong presumption that the trial court based its sentencing\n\ndetermination on proper legal reasoning, and the court is presumed to have considered any\n\nevidence in mitigation that is before it. People v. Partin, 156 Ill. App. 3d 365, 373 (1987). The\n\nimposition of a sentence is a matter within the trial court's discretion, and a reviewing court has\n\nthe power to disturb the sentence only if the trial court abused its discretion. Jones, 168 Ill. 2d at\n\n373-74.\n\n\u00b6 81   We find no abuse of discretion in this case. At sentencing, the court was advised that\n\ndefendant, who is a high school graduate, was working at the time of his arrest and was close\n\nwith his family. The presentence investigation report (PSI) stated that defendant had one\n\nmisdemeanor and three drug-related felony convictions in his background. In allocution,\n\ndefendant apologized to Saldivar's family, repeating that he never intended to hurt anyone and he\n\nwas afraid that the victims were going to come back and harm him. In imposing sentence, the\n\ncourt indicated that it had considered the arguments of counsel, the PSI, the evidence offered in\n\naggravation and mitigation and the statutory factors in aggravation and mitigation. See 730\n\nILCS 5/5-5-3.1, 5-5-3.2 (West 2008). Based on the record, the court clearly considered\n\ndefendant's potential for rehabilitation, and other mitigating factors.   Furthermore, defendant\u2019s\n\nsentences fell within the statutory range and are therefore presumptively proper. People v.\n\nHauschild, 226 Ill. 2d 63, 90 (2007); see 720 ILCS 5/8-4(c)(1) (West 2006); 730 ILCS 5/5-8-\n\n1(a)(3) (West 2006); 720 ILCS 5/8-4(a)(1)(C) (West 2006); 720 ILCS 5/5-8-1(a)(1.5) (West\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\n2006). Consequently, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in imposing the\n\naggregate 54-year sentence.\n\n\u00b6 82                          VII. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n\u00b6 83   Defendant claims that counsel was ineffective for not seeking to have his sentence for\n\nattempted first degree murder reduced based on provocation. Defendant argues that at the time\n\nof sentencing, section 8-4(c)(1)(E) allowed for defendants convicted of attempted murder to\n\nprove, by preponderance of the evidence, that the mitigating factor of provocation was present,\n\nso as to reduce the class of offense from a Class X offense to a Class 1 offense. 720 ILCS 5/8-\n\n4(c)(1)(E) (West 2010). Defendant faults counsel for not invoking this statute where there was a\n\n\"substantial physical assault\" which preceded the shooting.\n\n\u00b6 84   In a criminal case a defendant is constitutionally guaranteed effective assistance of\n\ncounsel. U.S. Const., amends. VI, XIV; Ill. Const., 1970, art. I, \u00a7 8; Strickland v. Washington,\n\n466 U.S. 668 (1984); adopted by People v. Albanese, 104 Ill. 2d 504 (1984). A defendant must\n\nmeet a two-prong test to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim: (1) counsel's performance fell\n\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness and; (2) there is reasonable probability that, but\n\nfor counsel's errors, the result of the trial would have been different. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687.\n\n\u00b6 85   Under the first prong of the Strickland test, defendant must overcome a \"strong\n\npresumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional\n\nassistance; that is, defendant must overcome the presumption that under the circumstances, the\n\nchallenged action 'might be considered sound trial strategy.' \" Id. at 689 (quoting Michel v.\n\nLouisiana, 350 U.S. 91, 101 (1955)). A defendant satisfies the second prong of Strickland if he\n\ncan show that a reasonable probability exists that, had counsel not erred, the trier of fact would\n\n\n\n                                                 27\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\nnot have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. People v. Caballero, 126 Ill. 2d 248, 260\n\n(1989). Where the defendant fails to prove prejudice, the reviewing court need not determine\n\nwhether counsel's performance constituted less than reasonable assistance. Strickland, 466 U.S.\n\nat 697, 699; People v. Flores, 153 Ill. 2d 264, 283-84 (1992).\n\n\u00b6 86   The burden is on the defendant to overcome the strong presumption that defense\n\ncounsel rendered adequate assistance using reasonable professional judgment pursuant to sound\n\ntrial strategy. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689-90. It is not enough that trial counsel failed to meet\n\nthe competence standard; defendant must also show that he was prejudiced as a result. Id. at\n\n692-93.\n\n\u00b6 87   The statute in question here, which became effective January 1, 2010, reads that in a\n\nprosecution for attempted first degree murder:\n\n       \"[I]f the defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence at sentencing that, at the\n\n       time of the attempted murder, he or she was acting under a sudden and intense passion\n\n       resulting from serious provocation by the individual whom the defendant\n\n       endeavored to kill, or another, and, had the individual the defendant endeavored to kill\n\n       died, the defendant would have negligently or accidentally caused that death, then the\n\n       sentence for attempted murder is the sentence for a Class 1 felony.\" 720 ILCS 5/8-\n\n       4(c)(1)(E) (West 2010).\n\n\u00b6 88   A plain reading of the statute establishes that a reduction in sentence is available in\n\nprosecutions for attempted murder only if the defendant \"was acting under a sudden and intense\n\npassion resulting from serious provocation.\" Whether provocation existed was not at issue in\n\nthis case. Indeed, the trial court found that the evidence did not support defendant's proposed\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\f1-11-0450\n\n\njury instruction on provocation, an issue that defendant does not raise before this court.\n\nDefendant's theory of the case was that he acted in self-defense and argued as such throughout all\n\nstages of the proceedings. The statute does not provide for a reduction in sentence when a\n\ndefendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that he is acting in self-defense. Where no\n\nprovocation occurred in this case, section 8-4(c)(1)(E) was not applicable and therefore\n\ndefendant was not prejudiced by counsel's failure to request the reduction at sentencing.\n\n\u00b6 89                                   CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 90   For the foregoing reasons, we vacate defendant\u2019s conviction for aggravated discharge of\n\na firearm and affirm defendant's remaining convictions.\n\n\u00b6 91   Affirmed in part and vacated in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\f",
