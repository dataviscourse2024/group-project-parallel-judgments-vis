LANCE, JUDGE PRESIDING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAppellant Tremain Tunstall appeals his conviction for capital murder (multiple\r\nhomicides).  See Tex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a7 19.03(a)(7)(A) (West 1994).  The State did not seek the\r\ndeath penalty, therefore punishment was life imprisonment.  See Tex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a7 12.31\r\n(West 1994).  Appellant brings two issues for review.  In the first, he contends that the warnings\r\nhe was given before he made his written and videotaped confessions were not adequate, and in the\r\nsecond, he claims his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise the issue of\r\nthese inadequate warnings.  We will affirm the judgment. \r\n\r\n\r\nADMISSIBILITY OF CONFESSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn his first issue, appellant contends that the warnings given to him before he gave\r\nhis written and videotaped confessions did not comply with the requirements of article 38.22 of\r\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure because they did not include the information that any statement \r\nhe makes may be used against him.  See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.22 \u00a7 2(a)(1), (2)\r\n(West 1979) &amp; \u00a7 3(2) (West Supp. 1998).  In order to complain on appeal about the admissibility\r\nof a confession, an objection must have been made to its admission on that same ground in the trial\r\ncourt.   See  Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1)(A);  Little v. State, 758 S.W.2d 551, 564 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. 1988); Fancher v. State, 659 S.W.2d 836, 839 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983).  In the instant case, \r\nappellant's trial counsel objected on other grounds to the admission of his written confession, and\r\na pre-trial hearing was held on appellant's motion to suppress it, but the claim now made on\r\nappeal--concerning the omitted item--was not raised at trial.  We hold that the complaint was\r\nwaived.  See Briggs v. State, 789 S.W.2d 918, 924 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).\r\n\r\n\tUnder the same point, appellant attempts to raise the separate question of whether\r\nimproper inducements were made which, when combined with the effect of the claimed improper\r\nwarnings, caused appellant to confess to the killings.  This is also an objection different from the\r\none presented in appellant's motion to suppress which was heard and ruled upon by the trial court. \r\n\tThe ground urged in appellant's motion was a claim that the deputy sheriff's\r\nstatement to appellant was an improper inducement to confess.  The statement appellant contended\r\nwas improper was, \"[H]ey, your [sic] looking at Capital Murder charges and if this is self defense,\r\nyou better tell me.\"  The trial court found there was no direct or implied promise of benefit or\r\ngain given to induce the statement.  Appellant renewed this objection to admission of the written\r\nconfession at trial and the trial court again overruled it.  Appellant made no claim at the hearing\r\nnor at trial that a defect in the warning influenced his decision to confess.  We note that evidence\r\nat the hearing showed that appellant had been taken before magistrates for warnings in two\r\ndifferent counties, the one in which he was captured and the one in which he was prosecuted,\r\nbefore he was questioned.\r\n\r\n\tNow, on appeal, appellant makes a different argument than he made at trial, and\r\nhe attempts to combine the new defective-warning issue with his original objection.  Appellant's\r\narguments on appeal must correspond to his objection at trial.  Butler v. State, 872  S.W.2d 227, \r\n236 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994).  We hold the claim of error was waived.\r\n\r\n\tAnother reason why appellant's issue fails is that he did not object to the\r\nintroduction of his videotaped statement.  After appellant gave a written confession, he went with\r\nlaw enforcement officers to show them where to hunt for the weapon he used in the killings and\r\nto point out the scenes of the crimes.  He described and demonstrated the events at different\r\nlocations to provide more detail about what happened.  His statements and reenactments were\r\nvideotaped.  Even if the written statement had been improperly admitted, the admission of\r\nsubstantially the same testimony without objection, through admission of the videotaped\r\nconfession, made the error, if any, harmless.  See Hicks v. State, 860 S.W.2d 419, 430-31 (Tex.\r\nCrim. App. 1993), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1227 (1994) (improper admission of defendant's grand\r\njury testimony  harmless because substantively the same evidence properly admitted in form of\r\ntaped interview with deputy  sheriff).  Appellant's first issue for review is overruled. \r\n\r\n\r\nINEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\tIn his second issue, appellant contends that his trial attorney rendered ineffective\r\nassistance by failing to object to the admission of appellant's written statement and his video\r\nstatement on the basis that the warning given to appellant was incomplete.  To show ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel, appellant must show that:  (1) trial counsel's performance was deficient in\r\nthat counsel made such serious errors that he was not functioning effectively as counsel; and (2)\r\nthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense to such a degree that appellant was deprived of\r\na fair trial.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); Hernandez v. State, 726 S.W.2d\r\n53, 57 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986); O'Hara v. State, 837 S.W.2d 139 (Tex. App.--Austin 1992, pet.\r\nref'd).  Counsel's performance is to be judged by the totality of representation provided. \r\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 690; Butler v. State, 716 S.W.2d 48, 54 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986). \r\nCounsel is strongly presumed to have provided adequate assistance and to have made all significant\r\ndecisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690.  See\r\nValencia v. State, 946 S.W.2d 81, 83 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (reviewing court applies strong\r\npresumption that counsel's actions were within wide range of reasonable professional assistance).\r\n\r\n\tAppellant has the burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel.  Cannon v.\r\nState, 668 S.W.2d 401, 403 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984).  In the present case, no motion for new trial\r\nwas filed.  Thus, appellant has not brought to this Court any evidentiary record showing the\r\nreasons for his attorney's actions, and we decline to speculate on trial counsel's strategy.  Due to\r\nthe absence of evidence concerning counsel's reasons--or lack thereof--for his actions, we are\r\nunable to conclude that his performance was deficient.  See Jackson v. State, 877 S.W.2d 768, 771\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1994).  The record does show that appellant's counsel was not inactive.  He\r\nfiled numerous motions, including one for change of venue, and obtained a hearing and ruling on\r\nit; he pursued a motion to suppress the written confession and obtained a ruling; he made  motions\r\nto obtain investigators and expert witnesses, filed motions for discovery, and apparently obtained\r\nfull disclosure; he obtained depositions of out-of-state witnesses, presented six defense witnesses,\r\nconducted thorough cross-examination of the State's witnesses, and made numerous objections\r\nthroughout the trial.  This substantial activity in defense of appellant gives factual support to the\r\nstrong presumption of reasonable representation.  \r\n\r\n\tIn any event, appellant's decision to testify against his counsel's advice almost\r\ncertainly renders the question of the effectiveness of counsel moot.  After the State rested, and\r\noutside the presence of the jury, appellant took the stand and acknowledged that his attorney had\r\nadvised him not to testify but, despite that advice, appellant said \"I'd like to tell my side.\"\r\nAppellant then testified and in the process of telling his side, acknowledged that the events detailed\r\nin his written and videotaped statements were true.  He added new information, but did not\r\ncontradict the facts previously given about how he shot both of his victims.  When a defendant\r\npreempts his attorney's strategy by insisting that a different defense be followed, no claim of\r\nineffectiveness can be made.  Duncan v. State, 717 S.W.2d 345, 348 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986);\r\nMedina v. State, 962 S.W.2d 83, 87 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 1997, pet. ref'd).  See also \r\nRandall v. State, 464 S.W.2d 836 (Tex. Crim. App. 1971) (defendant who insisted on testifying\r\nagainst advice of counsel and testified to substantially the same facts as in confession would not\r\nbe heard to complain about admission of disputed confession).  We overrule appellant's second\r\nissue for review.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\tHaving overruled appellant's issues for review, we affirm the judgment of\r\nconviction.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t                                                                       \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tJohn Powers, Justice \r\n\r\nBefore Justices Powers, Kidd and B. A. Smith \r\n\r\nAffirmed\r\n\r\nFiled:   November 5, 1998\r\n\r\nDo Not Publish\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper admission of defendant's grand\r\njury testimony  harmless because substantively the same evidence properly admitted in form of\r\ntaped interview with deputy  sheriff).  Appellant's first issue for review is overruled. \r\n\r\n\r\nINEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\tIn his second issue, appellant contends that his trial attorney rendered ineffective\r\nassistance by failing to object to the admission of appellant's written statement and his video\r\nstatement on the basis that the warning given to appellant was incomplete.
