The defendant, Treizy Lopez, appeals from\nthe judgment of conviction, following a jury trial, of\nattempt to commit robbery in the first degree in viola-\ntion of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-134 (a) (2),\nand conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree\nin violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-134\n(a) (2).1 On appeal, the defendant claims that the court\nimproperly admitted uncharged misconduct evidence\nof a separate robbery. We conclude that the defendant\nhas not met his burden of establishing harmful error.\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following\nfacts. On April 11, 2015, the defendant met with his\nfriend, Leighton Vanderberg. They drove to Bridgeport\nin a light green Ford Focus owned by Vanderberg\u2019s wife\nto \u2018\u2018hit a stain to get some money.\u2019\u20192 At approximately\n3 p.m., the defendant and Vanderberg entered Sapiao\u2019s\nGrocery store in Bridgeport. The defendant went to the\ncounter, where Maria Salgado (Maria) was located, and\nVanderberg went to the back of the store where he\nconfronted Jose Salgado (Jose).3 Maria testified that\nthe defendant, who was wearing a black mask, pointed\na gun at her and told her not to talk or move. Meanwhile,\nVanderberg, who also had a gun, approached Jose and\ndemanded that he give him the $900 that Jose was\nholding. Speaking in Portuguese, Jose requested that\nMaria retrieve his gun located behind the counter. As\nshe was reaching for the gun, Vanderberg shot Jose\nthree times. Two bullets entered his body, one in the\nneck and the other in his right upper shoulder, which\n\u2018\u2018went through the muscles of the upper arm and shoul-\nder area and then continued into . . . the chest where\nit went into the chest cavities and [injured] the right\nlung, as well as the pulmonary artery . . . and then it\ncontinued and it injured the left lung, as well.\u2019\u2019 The\nbullet that injured the chest and torso was fatal.4 There-\nafter, the defendant and Vanderberg fled the store and\ndrove to New Haven where they planned to commit a\nsecond robbery at the Smokin\u2019 Wings restaurant.5\n  Officers from the Bridgeport Police Department sub-\nsequently were called to the scene at Sapiao\u2019s Grocery.\nDuring their investigation, the police obtained video\nsurveillance from surrounding stores. The videos\nrevealed that the defendant had purchased items from\na nearby market shortly before the robbery. The videos\nfurther showed the defendant and Vanderberg entering\nSapiao\u2019s Grocery, fleeing, and driving away in a green\nFord Focus, which had been parked nearby.6\n   The defendant also was identified by a witness who\nsaw the two men flee the store. She testified that \u2018\u2018[o]ne\nof [the men] was tall [with darker skin] and the other\n. . . was wearing some type of mask. . . . [The man\nwearing the mask] had light[er] skin. He wasn\u2019t too\n\fdark and he wasn\u2019t too fair.\u2019\u2019 The witness further\ndescribed the lighter skinned man as having longer\nblack hair that went down to his neck.\n   Later that day, New Haven police officers found a\ngun in a trash can in New Haven. The gun was sent to\nthe state\u2019s forensic laboratory for testing. The forensic\nfirearms examiner concluded that the bullets and bullet\nfragments recovered from Jose\u2019s body during an\nautopsy matched test samples fired from the gun that\nhad been recovered by the New Haven police.7 The\nforensic DNA examiner concluded that the defendant\nwas a DNA contributor to samples found on multiple\nlocations on the gun, including the gun\u2019s grip, trigger,\nand hammer.8\n   On April 27, 2015, Bridgeport police detectives\narrested the defendant and conducted an interview,\nwhich was video recorded, and, ultimately, shown to\nthe jury. During the interview, the defendant admitted\nto participating in the robbery.9 The defendant further\ndescribed the type of gun that he had used during the\nrobbery10 and what happened to the gun after the rob-\nbery.11 He also admitted to changing his physical\nappearance after the day of the robbery.12 The defendant\nwas charged with felony murder in violation of General\nStatutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54c, attempt to commit robbery in the\nfirst degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-134 (a) (2),\nand conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree\nin violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-134 (a) (2).\n   On May 2, 2018, the defendant filed a pretrial motion\nin limine seeking to preclude the state from presenting\n\u2018\u2018any and all evidence regarding a robbery/shooting\ninvestigation of a commercial establishment called\n\u2018Smokin\u2019 Wings\u2019 in New Haven . . . on April 11, 2015\n. . . .\u2019\u201913 He argued that the evidence was irrelevant and\nunduly prejudicial. The state objected to this motion.\nOn May 15, 2018, after conducting a hearing, the court,\nKavanewsky, J., denied the defendant\u2019s motion, subject\nto reargument, stating: \u2018\u2018Okay, at this point, I\u2019m going\nto deny the motion to preclude. . . . [Y]ou\u2019ve got the\nBridgeport homicide, that\u2019s the one the defendant is\ncharged with participating in. Very, very close in time,\nwe have the Smokin\u2019 Wings [robbery], same day, within\na matter of hours. The weapon that was used in the\nBridgeport homicide was used in the Smokin\u2019 Wings\n[robbery] and was recovered by the police, identified\nto be the . . . Bridgeport homicide weapon. There\u2019s\nDNA of the defendant on this weapon.\n  \u2018\u2018In the Smokin\u2019 Wings [robbery] there are three per-\npetrators supposed to be involved, an African-American\nand two either white or Hispanic.\n  \u2018\u2018Now, the state does not have to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the defendant participated in the\nSmokin\u2019 Wings [robbery], but yet, I think I have to keep\nmy eye on the ball here, and the question is, is this New\n\fHaven Smokin\u2019 Wings incident and the [gun] and the\n. . . evidence concerning the [gun] relevant to estab-\nlishing the defendant\u2019s guilt in the Bridgeport homicide.\nI think the answer is clearly it\u2019s relevant. It tends to\nprove a fact that\u2019s in issue. It doesn\u2019t have to be conclu-\nsive but it\u2019s relevant and I\u2019ll consider a limiting instruc-\ntion concerning what you may object to being adduced\nabout what happened within Smokin\u2019 Wings but I\u2019m not\ngoing to just outright preclude that . . . I think all of\nthis is relevant to the charge of the defendant\u2019s guilt\nof the felony murder in Bridgeport . . . . I think it\u2019s\nadmissible evidence.\u2019\u2019\n  During trial, on May 23, 2018, the state proffered\nevidence of the Smokin\u2019 Wings robbery for the purposes\nof establishing identity, outside the presence of the\njury. The defendant renewed his initial objection to the\nadmission of the evidence. The court concluded that\nthe evidence \u2018\u2018should be . . . admitted for purposes\nof the jury\u2019s consideration that the defendant was a\nperpetrator in the charged offense here in Bridgeport.\u2019\u2019\nEvidence regarding the robbery at Smokin\u2019 Wings was\nthen presented to the jury.\n   On May 31, 2018, the defendant was convicted of\nattempt to commit robbery in the first degree and con-\nspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree.14 The\ncourt sentenced the defendant to a total effective sen-\ntence of thirty years of incarceration, ten years of which\nwere mandatory, followed by a period of special parole\nfor five years. This appeal followed.\n  The defendant claims that the trial court improperly\nadmitted evidence of the separate robbery at the\nSmokin\u2019 Wings restaurant in New Haven. He argues that\n(1) the evidence of the Smokin\u2019 Wings robbery was\nnot relevant or material to any uncharged misconduct\nexception pursuant to \u00a7 4-5 (c) of the Connecticut Code\nof Evidence, (2) the prejudicial effect of evidence of\nthe Smokin\u2019 Wings robbery outweighed its probative\nvalue, and (3) the admission of this evidence was harm-\nful error.\n   We have no need to consider whether the admission\nof evidence of misconduct at the Smokin\u2019 Wings restau-\nrant was improper, because the evidence was emphati-\ncally harmless. See State v. Osimanti, 299 Conn. 1,\n18, 6. A.3d 790 (2010) (no abuse of discretion analysis\nconducted when concluding that trial court\u2019s eviden-\ntiary rulings were harmless). The evidence was prof-\nfered and admitted on the ground that it was relevant\nto identification, that is, that it tended to show that the\ndefendant participated in the robbery at the Sapiao\u2019s\nGrocery. The court instructed the jurors several times\nthat they could consider the evidence only for the pur-\npose of identification.15\n  Other evidence overwhelmingly established identifi-\ncation. The jury could have found that the defendant\u2019s\n\fDNA was on the gun that fired the fatal bullets. Surveil-\nlance video and eyewitness\u2019 descriptive testimony con-\nfirmed the identification. Furthermore, the defendant\nhimself stated to the police and testified that he and\nVanderberg had intended to commit robberies and that\nthey were present in Sapiao\u2019s Grocery.16\n   The defendant claims evidential rather than constitu-\ntional error; he, thus, has the burden on appeal of show-\ning harmful error. \u2018\u2018[W]hen an improper evidentiary rul-\ning is not constitutional in nature, the defendant bears\nthe burden ofdemonstrating that the error was harmful.\n. . . [W]e must examine the impact of the [improperly\nadmitted] evidence on the trier of fact and the result\nof the trial. . . . [T]he proper standard for determining\nwhether an erroneous evidentiary ruling is harmless\nshould be whether the jury\u2019s verdict was substantially\nswayed by the error. . . . Accordingly, a nonconstitu-\ntional error is harmless when an appellate court has a\nfair assurance that the error did not substantially affect\nthe verdict. . . . If the evidence may have had a ten-\ndency to influence the judgment of the jury, it cannot\nbe considered harmless. . . . That determination must\nbe made in light of the entire record [including the\nstrength of the state\u2019s case without the evidence admit-\nted in error].\u2019\u2019 (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State\nv. LeBlanc, 148 Conn. App. 503, 508\u2013509, 84 A.3d 1242,\ncert. denied, 311 Conn. 945, 90 A.3d 975 (2014).\n   The defendant argues that because the jury returned a\nsplit verdict, finding him not guilty of the felony murder\ncharge but guilty of both robbery charges, the state\u2019s\ncase against him was \u2018\u2018close\u2019\u2019 and, therefore, the admis-\nsion of evidence of the Smokin\u2019 Wings robbery \u2018\u2018cannot\nbe said to have not substantially affected the verdict.\u2019\u2019\n(Emphasis in original.) He argues that, \u2018\u2018after carefully\nconsidering the evidence, the jury refused to find that\nall the elements of felony murder were proven beyond\na reasonable doubt. . . . The fact that the jury split its\nverdicts after hearing [evidence of the Smokin\u2019 Wings\nrobbery] and considering it to the point that it entered\nat least one acquittal further shows how close this case\nwas.\u2019\u2019 According to the defendant, the purported weak-\nness in the state\u2019s case contributed to the harmfulness\nof the uncharged misconduct evidence. The defendant\ndoes not claim that there was insufficient evidence to\nsupport his conviction.\n  To support his assertion that the jury had doubts\nconcerning the strength of the state\u2019s case, the defen-\ndant cites State v. Angel T., 292 Conn. 262, 294\u201395, 973\nA.2d 1207 (2009).17 In Angel T., our Supreme Court\ndetermined that where there was no physical evidence\nintroduced concerning a sexual assault and the jury\ntwice reported to the court that it was deadlocked in\nmaking its decision, \u2018\u2018the state\u2019s case was not suffi-\nciently strong so as to not be overshadowed by the\n[harmful error].\u2019\u2019 Id., 293. The court held: \u2018\u2018[T]he lack\n\fof physical evidence of sexual assault . . . rendered it\na credibility contest between the defendant and his\naccusers, and the jury\u2019s deadlock, followed by a split\nverdict, leads us to believe that the state\u2019s evidence did\nnot overwhelm the jury, indicating that the jury may\nwell have been unduly influenced by the [harmful\nerror].\u2019\u2019 Id., 295.\n    In the present case, the jury reported to the court\nthat it was deadlocked regarding the charge of felony\nmurder. In a note to the court, the jury stated: \u2018\u2018[T]he\njury has\u2014I think it\u2019s found\u2014found consensus on charge\ntwo [(attempted robbery)] and [charge] three [(conspir-\nacy to commit robbery)] and is divided on charge one\n[(felony murder)]. Jury members have indicated unwill-\ningness to change.\u2019\u2019 Shortly before the jury was released\nfor the day, the foreperson indicated that \u2018\u2018[he] just\nwould prefer to have redacted the note.\u2019\u2019 He clarified:\n\u2018\u2018I sent it out too early and I don\u2019t really want the court\nto address [it], if that makes sense. . . . I sent the note\nout premature[ly] and I\u2014I would wish to\u2014to redact it,\nto take it back and not have the court address it.\u2019\u2019 The\nnext day, the court, acknowledging the note and the\nforeperson\u2019s request, instructed the jury to continue its\ndeliberations. The jury then informed the court that it\nhad reached a consensus on all counts and delivered\nits verdict.\n   Although the record discloses that the jury briefly\nwas deadlocked as to one count, there is no indication\nof deadlock as to the other two counts, or as to identity\nin any event. There was strong physical evidence linking\nthe defendant to the gun that was used in the robbery,\nas well as witness identification and the defendant\u2019s\nown admissions. The court instructed the jury to con-\nsider the Smokin\u2019 Wings evidence, if at all, only on\nthe issue of identification. We presume that the jury\nfollowed the instructions of the court. See State v. Paul\nB., 315 Conn. 19, 32, 105 A.3d 130 (2014) (in absence\nof contrary evidence, appellate courts presume jury\nfollowed limiting instruction). A review of the evidence\nin this case, therefore, shows that the evidence of identi-\nfication was so strong that any error regarding the\nadmission of evidence concerning Smokin\u2019 Wings was\ninconsequential. The defendant has not met his burden\nof showing harmful error.\n      The judgment is affirmed.\n      In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  1\n    The jury also found that the defendant used a firearm in the commission\nof the crime of attempt to commit robbery, and his sentence was enhanced\nby application of General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k.\n  2\n    The defendant testified: \u2018\u2018A stain means we\u2019re going to commit a robbery\nor just pretty much get in over on anybody. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to\nbe a robbery. It just could be something as easy as, all right, I told you I\u2019m\ngoing to do something for you and I got you for your money. Like, you gave\nme money to do something and\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014like, you [were] going to\nbuy my car and you gave me the money for my car, but in return I didn\u2019t\nsell you the car. I filled out false paperwork. So, pretty much, basically, just\nscam somebody for money. That could be considered a stain as well. It\u2019s\n\fjust anything\u2014pretty much anything to get some money that\u2014basically,\nthat\u2019s it.\u2019\u2019\n   3\n     The Salgados owned Sapiao\u2019s Grocery.\n   4\n     The medical examiner testified: \u2018\u2018I would say that the [bullet] that went\nthrough the torso . . . the trunk, and the lungs, that was, clearly, a fatal\ninjury.\u2019\u2019 He further testified: \u2018\u2018The cause of death was the gunshot wound\nof the trunk.\u2019\u2019\n   5\n     During the police interview, the defendant stated: \u2018\u2018[W]e got back to New\nHaven . . . [a]nd [Vanderberg] was planning on robbing another store.\u2019\u2019\n   6\n     The vehicle also was identified by Augusto Cesar Manazare, who testified\nthat while he was waiting in his car to do laundry, he saw \u2018\u2018[t]wo guys\nrunning and . . . going into a [light green] car that was parked in front of\n[his] . . . house.\u2019\u2019 Although he could not describe the men in detail, he did\nidentify the light green Ford Focus. Referring to the light green Ford Focus,\nManazare testified: \u2018\u2018That was the car that was parked in front of my house.\u2019\u2019\n   7\n     The forensic firearms examiner testified: \u2018\u2018[A]fter a microscopic compari-\nson of the two items to each other and then to test fires that the laboratory\nmade with this actual firearm there was agreement between the bullets from\nthe test fires, as well as the two evidence bullets. Enough for an examiner\nto say that, yes, these were fired in this gun.\u2019\u2019\n   8\n     In regard to the hammer, the forensic DNA examiner testified: \u2018\u2018[The\ndefendant] is included as a potential contributor to the major DNA profile\nfrom item 3-3G1, which was the hammer. And the expected frequency of\nindividuals who could be a contributor to this major mixture profile is less\nthan one in seven billion in the African-American, Caucasian, and Hispanic\npopulation. That\u2019s actually our laboratory ceiling. We won\u2019t report out a\nstatistic higher than that. We\u2019ve capped it at one in seven billion because\nseven billion is approximately the population of the earth.\u2019\u2019\n   9\n     The defendant stated: \u2018\u2018So we were driving around Bridgeport and like,\nyou know, we just going, we just going to get a store. I\u2019m like, but how\n[are] we [going to] do it? We can\u2019t just go in there without having a plan.\n[Vanderberg\u2019s] like, just do it. We\u2019re just [going to] do it. You can\u2019t think.\nYou think I\u2019m [going to] be there like it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t even know how to\nexplain it like, it\u2019s just . . . we got to the store, we got out. . . .\u2019\u2019\n   He continued: \u2018\u2018[Vanderberg] told me, just do it, just do it, this, that and\na third. . . . So we go in the store, we both got guns. . . . He [goes] behind\nthe counter, or whatever, I got the gun pointed at the lady. . . . I told her\njust, don\u2019t move, nobody is [going to] get hurt, we just want the money. So\nshe\u2019s sitting there, she\u2019s not replying to nothing at all. She\u2019s just completely\nquiet and shocked. . . .\n   \u2018\u2018So, next thing you know, the man come, he over here grabbing whatever\nhe grabbing, gunshots go off. After that, we run out the store. . . . I\u2019m like,\nI\u2019m completely shocked, I don\u2019t know what the fuck [is] going on. I\u2019m\nthinking he got [the] money, we [are about] to be good, everything, we just\nabout to get away. . . .\n   \u2018\u2018We got into the car and we just took off.\u2019\u2019\n   10\n      The defendant stated: \u2018\u2018I had a nine millimeter. . . . It was chrome.\n. . . [Vanderberg had] a .38 or something.\u2019\u2019\n   11\n      When questioned about the location of the guns that were used in the\nrobbery, he stated: \u2018\u2018I gave it to [Vanderberg]. I really don\u2019t know what he\ndid with them. But I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re gone.\u2019\u2019\n   12\n      The following colloquy occurred:\n   \u2018\u2018[Detective Curet]: Your hair was different that day, right?\n   \u2018\u2018[Lieutenant Lamaine]: It was like pretty long. And you had a decent\nlooking beard, kind of scruffle thing going. When did you shave the head\nand the beard?\n   \u2018\u2018[The Defendant]: The same day you talked to me.\n   \u2018\u2018[Lieutenant Lamaine]: That Wednesday morning, that would be the\nWednesday after the homicide.\u2019\u2019\n   13\n      The motion did not seek to preclude the physical evidence regarding\nthe gun recovered by the New Haven police. During the hearing on the\nmotion, defense counsel stated: \u2018\u2018I think my objection is really\u2014it\u2019s not the\nrecovery of the firearm or any subsequent testing . . . . I understand that\nthe court is going to allow the firearm . . . but as far as [what occurred]\ninside the store, that would really be my specific objection because the\nperson in the store cannot tell . . . who fired the firearm . . . . I\u2019m asking\nthe court to limit that testimony, more so than the actual physical recovery\nof the firearm . . . because the owner . . . of that store could not say who\nit was.\u2019\u2019\n   14\n      The jury found the defendant not guilty of the felony murder charge.\n\f   15\n      The court gave the following limiting instruction at the time the evidence\nwas admitted: \u2018\u2018You may not consider the Smokin\u2019 Wings evidence as estab-\nlishing a predisposition on the part of the defendant to commit any crime\ncharged or to demonstrate criminal propensity. You may consider such\nevidence if you believe it and further find it logically and rationally supports\nthe issue for which its being offered by the state, but only as it may bear\non the issue of the identity of the defendant in the Bridgeport homicide. So\nyou can consider this evidence of the New Haven matter if you believe it\nand only for purposes of your consideration of identity of the defendant in\nthe Bridgeport homicide.\u2019\u2019\n   When charging the jury, the court also stated: \u2018\u2018The state . . . offered\n[evidence of the Smokin\u2019 Wings robbery] . . . as an alleged act of miscon-\nduct of the defendant as it [may] bear upon your consideration of the identity\nof the defendant as a perpetrator of the crimes charged in this case. You\nmay not consider such evidence as establishing a predisposition on the part\nof the defendant to commit any of the crimes charged or to demonstrate a\ncriminal propensity. You may consider such evidence if you believe it and\nfurther to find that it logically and rationally supports the issue for which\nit is being offered by the state, but only as it may bear on the issue of\nidentity of the defendant in the Bridgeport matters. On the other hand, if\nyou do not believe such evidence, or even if you do, if you find that it does\nnot logically and rationally support the issue for which it is being offered\nby the state\u2014namely, the identity of the defendant\u2014then you may not\nconsider such [evidence] for any other purpose.\u2019\u2019 We presume that the jury\nfollowed the instructions of the court.\n   16\n      The following examination transpired between the prosecutor and the\ndefendant at trial:\n   \u2018\u2018Q. And the store that you\u2019re talking about, is that Sapiao\u2019s Grocery store?\n   \u2018\u2018A. Yes. It is.\n                                       ***\n   \u2018\u2018Q. And what happens inside the store?\n   \u2018\u2018A. I mean, I walk in the store, [Vanderberg] runs around the counter,\nand the next thing you know I just hear arguing. . . .\n                                       ***\n   \u2018\u2018Q. And what happens next?\n   \u2018\u2018A. I just heard gunshots. Like, I heard the arguing. . . . But I didn\u2019t\nnecessarily hear everything. . . . [T]he main things I remember was just\ngive me the money or I\u2019mma shoot you.\n                                       ***\n   \u2018\u2018Q. Okay. So, you hear a shot and what do you do?\n   \u2018\u2018A. I froze up. I was completely in shock. . . . I didn\u2019t know what to do.\nLike, I didn\u2019t even know what was happening. I thought the lady got shot,\nbut then I [saw] a man and the man was coming because I couldn\u2019t see.\nLike, I knew Vanderberg . . . was arguing with somebody, but I thought,\nlike\u2014I don\u2019t know. I just couldn\u2019t tell who he was arguing with. I didn\u2019t\nknow what was going on until after the fact when the shots went off and\nthere was a man in front of me. And he was, like, clutching his neck and\nhis chest.\u2019\u2019\n   17\n      The defendant also cites State v. Sawyer, 279 Conn. 331, 359\u201360, 904\nA.2d 101 (2006), overruled in part on other grounds by State v. DeJesus,\n288 Conn. 418, 953 A.2d 45 (2008), to support the proposition that the state\u2019s\ncase was not particularly strong. In Sawyer, which involved a sexual assault,\nour Supreme Court held that when there is a lack of physical evidence of\nthe sexual assault, the state does not have a strong case and the admission\nof uncharged misconduct is harmful. Id., 359. The present case is distinguish-\nable from Sawyer. Here, there is an abundance of physical evidence linking\nthe defendant to the robbery as well as the defendant\u2019s admissions. As such,\nSawyer does not apply.\n\f",
