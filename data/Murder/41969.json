            "opinion_text": "\nTHE prisoner was indicted at the Winchester District Court, April 1796, for the murder of Frederick Becktoil, The jury found a special verdict as follows:\n\u201c We the jury find, that on the evening of the 21st of \u201c January, 1796, the said Robert Mitcht.il the prisoner \u201c at the bar, came to his own house in the county of \u201c Berkeley, and within the jurisdiction of this court, in a \u201c state of intoxication; that he the said Robert Mitchell, \u201c then and there eat his supper, and then and there went \u201c to bed about six o\u2019clock at night, and apparently went to \u201c sleep; that about a quarter of an hour after six o\u2019clock, he \u201c then and there awoke, and desired his the said Robert \u201c Mitchell\u2019s wife to come to bed, which she not comply- \u201c ing with, a quarrel immediately ensued, and he, the \u201c said Robert Mitchell, then and there pulled his said \u201c wife by the hair of her head. That the deceased, the \u201c said Frederick Becktoil, then and there interposed to \u201c part them; that a scuffle ensued between the said Ro- \u201c bert Mitchell and the said Frederick Becktoil. the said \u201c Frederick Becktoil then and there residing and board- \u201c ing with the said Robert Mitchell, whereupon the said \u201c Robert Mitchell then and there took down his gun, that *117\u201c the said Frederick Becktoli then and there took the \u201c said gun away from the said Robert Mitchell, and he \u201c the said Frederick Becktoli then and there put the said \u201c gun up again. That a second quarrel and scuffle again \u201c immediately then and there ensued between the said Ro \u201c bert Mitchell and his said wife, that the said Frederick \u201c Becktoli again interposed to part them, and a second \u201c scuffle again then and there immediately ensued between \u201c the said Robert Mitchell and the said Frederick Beck- \u201c toll: that in the scuffle the said Robert Mitchell fell \u201c over a spinning wheel, which hurt his face so that it \u201c bled; that the said Frederick Becktoli, then and there \u201c immediately ran out of the house. That the moment \u201c the said Robert Mitchell recovered from his fall, he \u201c then and there ran and got his said gun again, the \u201c same being then, and before the said Robert Mitchell \u201c came home in the evening, ready loaded by the said \u201c Frederick Becktoli, to whom it had been lent some days \u201c before, but whether the said Robert Mitchell then and \u201c there knew the said gun to be loaded the j urors are \u201c wholly ignorant; and the said Robert Mitchell then and \u201c there instantly pursued the said Frederick Becktoli to \u201c the door of the house, and then and there standing at \u201c the door of the said house, he the said Robert Mitchell \u201c then and there instantly discharged the said gun to- \u201c wards the said Frederick Becktoli, the moon being then \u201c shining so that the; said Frederick could be seen, and *118\u201c the ground covered with snow, he the said Frederick \u201c Becktoll then and there being at the distance of be. \u201c tween twelve and fifteen yards from the said Robert \u201c Mitchell and going away from the house, , and with a \u201c leaden bullet, as charged in the said indictment, from u the said gun shot, did intentionally shoot and wound the \u201c said Frederick Becktoll then and there in the back, as \u201c in the said indictment is charged, of which wound the \u201c said Frederick Becktoll then and there instantly died. \u201c That soon after the said Frederick Becktoll fell, he the \u201c said Frederick Becktoll was carried into the house of the \u201c said Robert Mitchell. That the said Robert Mitchell \u201c directed Ms, son to take the gun and lay it where the \u201csaid Frederick Becktoll had fallen, in order that the M people might be induced to believe that the said Frede- \u201c rick Becktoll had shot himself. That from the time the \u201csaid Robert Mitchell first got out of his bed to beat his \u25a0\u201c said wife as is aforesaid,.to:the time of the shooting the \u201c aforesaid Frederick Becktoll, was near one quarter of an \u201chour; .that during that .whole period the said Robert \u201c Mitchell and his said wife, and the said Robert Mit- \u201c cheII and the said Frederick Becktoll were quarrelling. \u201c or scuffling. We find that the said Frederick Becktoll \u201c was during the whole time, then and there unarmed, \u201c that there had not been any former quarrel or grudge \u201c between the said Robert Mitchell and the said Frede \u201c rick Becktoll the deceased, so .far as the jurors are in *119\u201c formed. And if upon the whole matter, the court shall \u201c be of opinion that the said Robert Mitchell is guilty of \u201c murder, then-we the j&amp;ry find the said Robert Mitchell K guilty of murder; otherwise we the jury find the said \u201c Robert Mitchell guilty of manslaughter only.\u201d\nThe question arising on this special verdict was adjourned, and at a general court, November 16th, 1796, present judges Prentis, Tacker, Tyler, Jones, White, and Nelson, the following judgment was entered. \u201cThe \u201c question of law arising on the special verdict in the \u201c transcript of the record of the said case mentioned be- \u201c ing argued, it is the opinion of the court that the said \u201c Mitchell is not guilty of murder.\u201d\n",
