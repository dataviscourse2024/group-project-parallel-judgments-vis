CLARK v. THE STATE.\n\n\n       WARREN, Justice.\n\n       William Clark was convicted of felony murder and other crimes\n\nin connection with the shooting death of Anthony King and the\n\naggravated assault of Anthony Davis. 1                                  In this appeal, Clark\n\n\n       1The crimes occurred on August 3, 2012. In October 2012, a Richmond\nCounty grand jury indicted Clark and Jeremiah Kelly for malice murder,\nfelony murder (based on the aggravated assault of King), two counts of\naggravated assault (one against Davis and the other against his brother,\nTravis Davis), and three counts of possession of a firearm during the\ncommission of a crime (based on the murder of King, the aggravated assault of\nDavis, and the aggravated assault of Travis). Clark alone was tried from\nOctober 11 to 14, 2016; the jury found him not guilty of malice murder and the\naggravated assault and firearm offense against Travis, but guilty of the\nremaining crimes. The trial court sentenced him to serve life in prison without\nthe possibility of parole for felony murder, 20 consecutive years for the\naggravated assault against Davis, and five consecutive years each for the two\ncounts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. Kelly, who\nwas tried in March 2015, was found not guilty of malice murder but guilty of\nthe remaining counts against him; we address his appeal today in a separate\nopinion. See Kelly v. State, ___ Ga. ___ (Case No. S22A0979, Jan. 18, 2023).\nClark filed a timely motion for new trial, which he amended twice through new\ncounsel. After hearings in November 2021 and February 2022, the trial court\n\fcontends that the evidence presented at his trial was legally\n\ninsufficient to support his convictions for the crimes against King;\n\nthe trial court applied the wrong standard in admitting evidence of\n\nan audio recording of his interview with the lead investigator for his\n\ncase; the trial court committed plain error by failing to instruct the\n\njury on knowledge, grave suspicion, mere presence, and mere\n\nassociation; and his trial counsel provided constitutionally\n\nineffective assistance by failing to request those instructions and by\n\nfailing to file a demurrer to the indictment. Each of these claims is\n\nmeritless, so we affirm.\n\n      1. The evidence presented at Clark\u2019s trial showed the\n\nfollowing. 2 On the evening of August 3, 2012, King, Davis, and\n\nDavis\u2019s brother, Travis Davis (\u201cTravis\u201d), hung out and drank alcohol.\n\n\n\ndenied the motion in March 2022 but modified Clark\u2019s sentence for felony\nmurder to life with the possibility of parole. Clark then filed a timely notice of\nappeal, and his case was docketed to the August 2022 term of this Court and\nsubmitted for a decision on the briefs.\n\n      2 \u201cBecause this case requires an assessment of the harmful or prejudicial\neffect of certain alleged trial court errors and deficiencies of trial counsel, we\nlay out the evidence in detail and not only in the light most favorable to the\nverdicts.\u201d Rawls v. State, 310 Ga. 209, 210 n.2 (850 SE2d 90) (2020).\n                                        2\n\fAround 11:00 p.m., Travis drove them to a convenience store in\n\nAugusta to buy beer. Travis stayed in his SUV while King and Davis\n\nwalked toward the store.\n\n     According to Davis, he and King recognized two young men,\n\nwhom he identified at trial as Clark and Jeremiah Kelly, outside the\n\nstore.3 Davis told King that he believed that Clark and Kelly had\n\nfired shots at him about two weeks earlier. King stopped to talk to\n\nthem while Davis went inside the store.               A surveillance video\n\nrecording from the convenience store showed King, Clark, and Kelly\n\ncalmly talking in front of the store at 11:00 p.m. A few minutes later,\n\nKing went inside the store and Clark and Kelly walked out of view\n\nof the cameras. Davis testified that King then said something like\n\n\u201cthem little f**kers outside.\u201d King and Davis purchased some beer\n\nand left the store.\n\n     Travis dropped off King and Davis on a nearby street so they\n\ncould walk to a friend\u2019s house. Davis testified as follows. As he and\n\nKing walked through a parking lot, they saw Clark and Kelly again.\n\n\n     3   Clark was then 16 years old, and Kelly was 15 years old.\n                                       3\n\fKing said something to them; the four men started arguing; and\n\nClark and Kelly pulled out guns. King and Davis were not carrying\n\nguns.   An Oldsmobile pulled up, and two men, who were later\n\nidentified as Curtis Washington and Treyvon Archie, told Clark and\n\nKelly to put their guns away. Moments later, Travis pulled up in\n\nhis SUV and tried to \u201cdefuse the situation.\u201d Clark then fired his gun\n\ninto the air; Kelly started shooting; and Clark shot toward Davis.\n\nKing got in the SUV and began to drive away as Davis and Travis\n\nran, and Kelly told Clark to \u201cchase after them.\u201d Davis fled to a\n\nnearby restaurant, where he called 911.\n\n     Travis recounted a similar story.        According to Travis,\n\nmoments after he dropped off King and Davis, he had \u201ca bad feeling,\u201d\n\nso he drove back toward them. Two men, whom he identified at trial\n\nas Clark and Kelly, were pointing guns at King and Davis. Travis\n\nwas not carrying a gun. An Oldsmobile was parked in the middle of\n\nthe street, but the men in it did not appear to be involved in the\n\nargument. Travis got out of his SUV and told Clark and Kelly to put\n\ntheir guns down.    Clark then fired his gun, and Kelly started\n\n                                 4\n\fshooting. Davis ran away, and Kelly told Clark, \u201cwe\u2019ve got one\n\ntrying to get away, get him.\u201d Clark chased Davis, firing two more\n\nshots, as Kelly walked toward the SUV and said \u201cuh-huh, pow.\u201d\n\nTravis ran, but soon saw King driving the SUV and jumped in the\n\npassenger seat. Travis then saw that King had been shot. The SUV\n\ncrashed into a tree, and Travis got out and ran away. 4\n\n      Investigators who responded to the scene found King, who had\n\nbeen shot once in the chest, in the driver\u2019s seat of the SUV. He was\n\ntransported to a hospital, where he later died. A medical examiner\n\nrecovered a bullet fragment from King\u2019s chest, and investigators\n\nfound three .380 shell casings at the scene. A firearms examiner\n\nlater concluded that all of the shell casings had been fired from the\n\nsame .380 pistol and that the bullet fragment was fired from a .380\n\n\n\n      4 A surveillance video recording from the parking lot where the shooting\noccurred, the quality of which the prosecutor described as \u201cpoor,\u201d was admitted\ninto evidence. Davis and the lead investigator for the case testified that the\nvideo showed the following. King and Davis walked through the parking lot\naround 11:20 p.m.; an Oldsmobile pulled up, followed by an SUV; Davis and\nTravis ran away as a man, whom Davis identified at trial as Clark, chased\nthem; and Travis got in the passenger side of the SUV, which drove through\nthe parking lot and out of view.\n\n                                      5\n\fpistol. Investigators did not find any guns at the scene.\n\n     Investigators identified Clark and Kelly as suspects, and Clark\n\nand Kelly turned themselves in the day after the shooting. The lead\n\ninvestigator interviewed Clark that evening; the interview was\n\naudio-recorded and later played for the jury. Initially, Clark denied\n\nbeing present during the shooting, but he eventually told the\n\nfollowing story. He and Kelly were outside the convenience store\n\nwhen two men approached and asked if they had been involved in a\n\nprior shooting. When they denied any involvement, the men left,\n\nbut Clark and Kelly soon encountered them again in a nearby\n\nparking lot. The men \u201ckept walking up on them\u201d and again asked if\n\nthey had been involved in the shooting. Clark said \u201cno.\u201d Clark\u2019s\n\nfriend Washington then pulled up in an Oldsmobile and asked what\n\nwas happening. Clark responded that he did not know. An SUV\n\nthen drove up, and \u201ca big dude jumped out.\u201d Kelly fired his gun as\n\nClark fled. 5\n\n\n     5Washington and Archie did not testify. The lead investigator testified\nthat Washington said during an interview that he did not see Clark with a gun\n\n                                     6\n\f      The lead investigator testified that his investigation indicated\n\nthat Kelly fired the shot that killed King, and it appears that the\n\nState\u2019s theory of the case was that Kelly was the shooter and Clark\n\nwas a party to the crimes. Clark did not testify, and the trial\u2019s\n\nopening statements and closing arguments were not transcribed.\n\n      2. Clark contends that the evidence presented at his trial was\n\ninsufficient as a matter of constitutional due process to support his\n\nconvictions for felony murder (based on aggravated assault against\n\nKing) and possession of a firearm during the commission of that\n\ncrime. 6 Specifically, Clark argues that the State failed to prove that\n\nhe participated in killing King because the evidence showed that\n\n\n\n\nthat night and that Kelly shot at King, Davis, and Travis. The investigator\nalso testified that Archie said during an interview that both Clark and Kelly\nhad guns that night. Clark did not object to this testimony at trial, and he does\nnot contend in this appeal that the testimony was improperly admitted.\n\n      6 Clark does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his\nconvictions for aggravated assault against Davis or possession of a firearm\nduring the commission of that crime, and this Court no longer routinely\nreviews evidentiary sufficiency sua sponte, except with respect to murder\nconvictions resulting in the death penalty. See Davenport v. State, 309 Ga. 385\n398-399 (846 SE2d 83) (2020).\n\n                                       7\n\fKelly was the shooter. We reject that argument.7\n\n      In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence as a matter of\n\nconstitutional due process, we view all of the evidence presented at\n\ntrial in the light most favorable to the verdicts and consider whether\n\nany rational juror could have found the defendant guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt of the crimes of which he was convicted. See\n\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (99 SCt 2781, 61 LE2d 560)\n\n(1979); Perkins v. State, 313 Ga. 885, 891 (873 SE2d 185) (2022).\n\n\u201cWe leave to the jury \u2018the resolution of conflicts or inconsistencies in\n\nthe evidence, credibility of witnesses, and reasonable inferences to\n\nbe derived from the facts.\u2019\u201d           Perkins, 313 Ga. at 891 (citation\n\n\n\n      7 In arguing about the sufficiency of the evidence, Clark asserts that the\nState was required to charge him with aggravated assault against King\nbecause his felony-murder conviction was based on that crime. That claim,\nhowever, relates to the sufficiency of the substance of the indictment\u2014not the\nsufficiency of the evidence presented at trial. Because Clark did not challenge\nthe substance of the indictment in the trial court, he has forfeited this claim.\nSee Hinkson v. State, 310 Ga. 388, 397 (850 SE2d 41) (2020) (explaining that\n\u201c\u2018a general demurrer may be raised after jeopardy has attached and at any\ntime during trial,\u2019 as well as \u2018in the form of a motion in arrest of judgment after\na verdict in the same term of court\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted). Clark also raises this\nissue in the context of a claim that his trial counsel provided constitutionally\nineffective assistance by failing to file a demurrer to the indictment (an\nargument he also made in his amended and second amended motion for new\ntrial). We address that claim in Division 5 (b).\n                                        8\n\fomitted).\n\n     To support Clark\u2019s conviction for felony murder, the evidence\n\npresented at trial had to show that he proximately caused King\u2019s\n\ndeath, either directly or as a party to the crime, while in the\n\ncommission of an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. See\n\nOCGA \u00a7 16-5-1 (c). See also Mathews v. State, 314 Ga. 360, 365 (877\n\nSE2d 188) (2022) (\u201c\u2018Felony murder requires only that the defendant\n\npossessed the requisite criminal intent to commit the underlying\n\nfelony\u2014in this case, aggravated assault, which also does not require\n\nintent to kill.\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted). The trial court instructed the jury\n\non aggravated assault, which OCGA \u00a7 16-5-21 (a) (2) defines, in\n\npertinent part, as an \u201cassault[] . . . [w]ith a deadly weapon.\u201d The\n\ncourt also instructed on parties to a crime under OCGA \u00a7 16-2-20.\n\nThat statute says, among other things, that \u201c[e]very person\n\nconcerned in the commission of a crime[,]\u201d including one who\n\n\u201c[i]ntentionally aids or abets in the commission of the crime\u201d or\n\n\u201c[i]ntentionally advises [or] encourages . . . another to commit the\n\ncrime\u201d is \u201ca party thereto and may be charged with and convicted of\n\n                                    9\n\fcommission of the crime.\u201d OCGA \u00a7 16-2-20 (a) & (b) (3)-(4).\n\n      It is well established that \u201c\u2018[a] person who does not directly\n\ncommit a crime may be convicted upon proof that the crime was\n\ncommitted and that person was a party to it.\u2019\u201d Glenn v. State, 306\n\nGa. 550, 553 (832 SE2d 433) (2019) (citation omitted). See also\n\nCrawford v. State, 312 Ga. 452, 455-456 (863 SE2d 75) (2021) (\u201c\u2018Even\n\nwhere it is undisputed that the victim was shot by another person,\n\nevery person concerned in the commission of the crime may be\n\nconvicted of the crime.\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted). Conviction as a party to\n\na crime requires proof of a common criminal intent, which the jury\n\nmay infer from the defendant\u2019s presence, companionship, and\n\nconduct with another perpetrator before, during, and after the\n\ncrimes. See, e.g., Glenn, 306 Ga. at 553. However, mere presence\n\nat the crime scene is insufficient to make someone a party to a crime.\n\nSee, e.g., id.\n\n      Although the evidence presented at trial indicated, and the\n\nparties did not dispute, that Clark did not personally fire the shot\n\nthat killed King, there was ample evidence from which the jury\n\n                                  10\n\freasonably could infer that Clark and Kelly shared a common\n\ncriminal intent with respect to the shooting. When properly viewed\n\nin the light most favorable to the verdicts, the evidence showed that\n\nClark and Kelly encountered King and Davis outside the\n\nconvenience store shortly before the shooting\u2014a fact supported by\n\nsurveillance video. A few minutes later, when Clark and Kelly saw\n\nKing and Davis again, the men argued. Clark and Kelly each pulled\n\nout a gun; Clark fired first; and Kelly then began shooting. Kelly\n\napproached the SUV, and at some point, King was shot and killed.\n\nIn addition, Kelly told Clark to chase Davis, and Clark followed that\n\ninstruction, firing more shots as he ran after him. Clark then lied\n\nduring his interview with the lead investigator, claiming that he had\n\nnot been present during the shooting.\n\n     Thus, even if Clark did not himself shoot King, the evidence\n\npresented at trial was still sufficient as a matter of constitutional\n\ndue process to authorize a rational jury to find him guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt as a party to the crimes of felony murder based on\n\naggravated assault and possession of a firearm during that offense.\n\n                                 11\n\fSee, e.g., Mathews, 314 Ga. at 365 (holding that the jury was\n\nauthorized to conclude that the appellant was guilty of felony\n\nmurder based on aggravated assault, even though the evidence\n\npresented at trial did not establish whether he or his co-defendant\n\nshot the murder victim, because they shared a common criminal\n\nintent); Williams v. State, 307 Ga. 689, 691 (838 SE2d 314) (2020)\n\n(holding that the evidence presented at trial was legally sufficient to\n\nprove that the appellant, who did not shoot the victim, was guilty as\n\na party to the murder, partly because he and some of the other\n\nassailants were in a car together, argued with the victim, and pulled\n\nout guns just before the shooting). 8\n\n      3. Clark contends that the trial court applied the \u201cwrong\n\nstandard\u201d in admitting into evidence the audio recording of his\n\ninterview with the lead investigator. He argues that because he was\n\n\n\n      8 To the extent Clark also challenges his felony-murder and firearm\nconvictions under OCGA \u00a7 24-14-6, even if we assume that the evidence\npresented at trial was entirely circumstantial, it was nonetheless sufficient to\nexclude every reasonable hypothesis other than that of his guilt. See id. (\u201cTo\nwarrant a conviction on circumstantial evidence, the proved facts shall not only\nbe consistent with the hypothesis of guilt, but shall exclude every other\nreasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt of the accused.\u201d).\n                                      12\n\fa juvenile at the time of his interview, see OCGA \u00a7 15-11-2 (10) (B)\n\n(defining \u201c[c]hild\u201d), the trial court was required to consider each of\n\nthe nine factors set forth in Riley v. State, 237 Ga. 124 (226 SE2d\n\n922) (1976), to determine whether he knowingly and voluntarily\n\nwaived his rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (86\n\nSCt 1602, 16 LE2d 694) (1966).\n\n      As we will explain more below, we take this opportunity to\n\nclarify that Riley held that trial courts are to use a totality-of-the-\n\ncircumstances test to determine whether a juvenile knowingly and\n\nvoluntarily waived his constitutional rights, and we reaffirm that\n\nholding today.9 However, requiring courts to apply the specific nine-\n\nfactor framework Riley set forth for assessing the totality of the\n\ncircumstances is in tension with the totality-of-the-circumstances\n\ntest itself, and we therefore disapprove language in Riley and later\n\n\n\n\n      9 We note that we have also applied Riley\u2019s totality-of-the-circumstances\ntest in evaluating whether a juvenile\u2019s statement to law enforcement officials\nwas voluntarily made as a matter of due process. See, e.g., State v. Powell, 315\nGa. 5, 12 (880 SE2d 189) (2022); Lester v. State, 310 Ga. 81, 85 n.7 (849 SE2d\n425) (2020). Clark does not claim a due-process violation here.\n\n                                      13\n\fcases suggesting that the nine-factor framework is required or\n\nexclusive. 10 Finally, because the record in this case does not indicate\n\nthat the trial court failed to apply a totality-of-the-circumstances\n\ntest, Clark\u2019s claim fails.\n\n      (a) We begin with a discussion of Riley and other cases from\n\nthe United States Supreme Court and this Court that have\n\nestablished the legal standard that a trial court must apply in\n\ndetermining whether a juvenile knowingly and voluntarily waived\n\nhis rights under Miranda.\n\n      It appears that Riley was one of the earliest cases in which this\n\n\n\n\n      10  Our concern about Riley is not new: several of us recently have\nexpressed concerns about Riley\u2019s nine-factor framework. See State v. Powell,\n315 Ga. 5, 12 n.5 (880 SE2d 189) (2022) (noting that \u201c[a] number of us have\nrecently expressed concerns about the prescriptive and restrictive nature of\nRiley\u2019s nine-factor analysis for juveniles\u201d); State v. Burton, 314 Ga. 637, 650\n(878 SE2d 515) (2022) (Pinson, J., concurring, joined by Boggs, C.J., and\nWarren, Bethel, and McMillian, JJ.) (expressing doubts about the \u201cjuvenile-\nspecific,\u201d nine-factor analysis in Riley); Daniels v. State, 313 Ga. 400, 418 (870\nSE2d 409) (2022) (Nahmias, C.J. concurring specially in part, joined by Boggs,\nP.J. and Warren, J.) (expressing \u201cdoubts about how a trial court is to make,\nand an appellate court is to review, a ruling based on a nine-factor, totality-of-\nthe-circumstances test\u201d) (emphasis in original).\n\n\n\n                                       14\n\fCourt considered a waiver of rights by a juvenile. 11 Riley argued\n\nthat he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his rights under\n\nMiranda because he was a juvenile and his parents were not present\n\nwhen he was interviewed by the police. See Riley, 237 Ga. at 127.\n\nThis Court declined to determine that such a waiver was\n\ninvoluntary per se, holding instead that \u201cthe question of a voluntary\n\nand knowing waiver depends on the totality of the circumstances[,]\n\nand the state has a heavy burden in showing that the juvenile did\n\nunderstand and waive his rights.\u201d Id. at 128. Relying on a decision\n\nof the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that\n\nsimilarly declined to apply a per se rule excluding evidence of a\n\njuvenile\u2019s incriminating statements to the police, the Riley Court\n\nwent on to say that\n\n      age alone is not determinative of whether a person can\n\n      11 Three years before Riley was decided, this Court summarily held in\nWilliams v. State, 231 Ga. 508 (202 SE2d 433) (1973), that the trial court did\nnot err by admitting into evidence a juvenile\u2019s statement to the police, noting\nthat the statement was made in the presence of his mother and after he was\nadvised of his rights under Miranda. See id. at 509. In addition, a few months\nbefore the decision in Riley, we similarly held (with little discussion) in\nCrawford v. State, 236 Ga. 491 (224 SE2d 365) (1976), that the trial court did\nnot err by admitting evidence of a juvenile\u2019s confession, noting that he had been\ngiven Miranda warnings and that his statement was voluntary.

These are\n     \u201c(1) age of the accused; (2) education of the accused; (3)\n     knowledge of the accused as to both the substance of the\n     charge . . . and the nature of his rights to consult with an\n     attorney and remain silent; (4) whether the accused is\n     held incommunicado or allowed to consult with relatives,\n     friends or an attorney; (5) whether the accused was\n     interrogated before or after formal charges had been filed;\n     (6) methods used in interrogation; (7) length of\n     interrogations; (8) whether vel non the accused refused to\n     voluntarily give statements on prior occasions; and (9)\n     whether the accused has repudiated an extra judicial\n     statement at a later date.\u201d\n\nId. at 128 (quoting West v. United States, 399 F2d 467, 469 (5th Cir.\n\n1968)).12   The Riley Court then disapproved a Georgia Court of\n\nAppeals case, Freeman v. Wilcox, to the extent it could be read as\n\nrequiring an automatic exclusion of a juvenile\u2019s statement to the\n\npolice, and summarily concluded that Riley knowingly and\n\nvoluntarily waived his rights, without expressly applying any of the\n\nnine factors it laid out before reaching its conclusion. See id. at 128\n\n\n     12  In West, the Fifth Circuit rejected the appellant\u2019s contention that\nbecause he was a juvenile when he was interviewed by an investigator, he was\n\u201cper se incapable of waiving\u201d his rights under Miranda. 399 F2d at 468.\nNoting that \u201c[f]actors considered by the courts in resolving this question\ninclude\u201d the nine factors later listed in Riley, the court held that whether a\njuvenile knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights did not depend on \u201cage\nalone,\u201d but rather on \u201cthe totality of circumstances.\u201d Id. at 469.\n                                     16\n\f(disapproving Freeman v. Wilcox, 119 Ga. App. 325 (167 SE2d 163)\n\n(1969)).\n\n     Three years later, the United States Supreme Court in Fare v.\n\nMichael C., 442 U.S. 707 (99 SCt 2560, 61 LE2d 197) (1979),\n\nexamined whether a juvenile had invoked his rights pursuant to\n\nMiranda by requesting to speak with his probation officer. See id.\n\nat 710-716. Concluding that the juvenile\u2019s request was not a per se\n\ninvocation of his rights, the Court explained that \u201cthe determination\n\nwhether statements obtained during custodial interrogation are\n\nadmissible against the accused is to be made upon an inquiry into\n\nthe totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, to\n\nascertain whether the accused in fact knowingly and voluntarily\n\ndecided to forgo his rights to remain silent and to have the\n\nassistance of counsel.\u201d    Id. at 724-725.     \u201cThis totality-of-the-\n\ncircumstances approach is adequate to determine whether there has\n\nbeen a waiver even where interrogation of juveniles is involved.\u201d Id.\n\nat 725. The Court further explained,\n\n     [w]e discern no persuasive reasons why any other\n\n                                 17\n\f     approach is required where the question is whether a\n     juvenile has waived his rights, as opposed to whether an\n     adult has done so. The totality approach permits\u2014\n     indeed, it mandates\u2014inquiry into all the circumstances\n     surrounding the interrogation. This includes evaluation\n     of the juvenile\u2019s age, experience, education, background,\n     and intelligence, and into whether he has the capacity to\n     understand the warnings given him, the nature of his\n     Fifth Amendment rights, and the consequences of\n     waiving those rights.\n\nId. at 725.\n\n     Thus,    our   holding    in    Riley\u2014that   a   totality-of-the-\n\ncircumstances test is used to determine whether a juvenile\n\nknowingly and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights\u2014is\n\nconsistent with the totality-of-the-circumstances approach for\n\njuvenile waiver that was later established in Fare.      And in the\n\ndecades following Riley and Fare, this Court has repeatedly held\n\nthat trial courts are to apply a totality-of-the-circumstances test in\n\nevaluating the admissibility of a juvenile\u2019s statement.

Because requiring\n\napplication of a fixed set of factors is inherently in tension with a\n\ntotality-of-the-circumstances        test,   we    disapprove      any    such\n\nlanguage.\n\n      (b) As we mentioned above, after we correctly held in Riley that\n\nwhether a juvenile knowingly and voluntarily waives his\n\n\n      13 Indeed, if Riley\u2019s holding were inconsistent with the totality-of-the-\ncircumstances test that Fare later established, we would be obligated to\noverrule Riley, because we must follow the United States Supreme Court\u2019s\ninstructions on how to determine, as a matter of federal constitutional law,\nwhether a juvenile has knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights protected\nby Miranda.

But proper application of a totality-of-the-circumstances\n\ntest \u201cmandates . . . inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding\n\nthe interrogation.\u201d Fare, 442 U.S. at 725 (emphasis supplied). See\n\nalso, e.g., United States v.

See West, 399 F2d at 469 (emphasis supplied). In other words, the nine\nfactors listed in West were not exclusive.\n                                      24\n\fmaterial \u2018circumstances should be considered\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted);\n\nUnited States v.

See Fare, 442 U.S. at 725. And given that in\n\na number of cases decided after Riley, this Court perpetuated the\n\ndicta in Riley that set forth the nine-factor framework of analysis as\n\npart of a totality-of-the-circumstances inquiry and used language\n\nincorrectly suggesting that trial courts are required to analyze each\n\nof those factors or are required to analyze those factors exclusively,\n\nwe disapprove any language in those cases indicating that the nine-\n\n\n\n\n      15 As we mentioned above, the Riley Court announced in dicta its list of\nnine factors after holding that \u201cthe question of a voluntary and knowing waiver\ndepends on the totality of the circumstances,\u201d and the factors were not\ndispositive of the Court\u2019s conclusion that the trial court correctly determined\nthat Riley knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights under Miranda.

Rather, as we have explained above, the totality-\n\nof-the-circumstances test requires trial courts to consider all of the\n\nrelevant circumstances surrounding a juvenile\u2019s interview with law\n\nenforcement officials to determine whether the State has met its\n\nburden of showing that the juvenile knowingly and voluntarily\n\nwaived his rights. See Fare, 442 U.S. at 725.\n\n\n\n\n       In addition, we have said that the factors listed in Riley are inapplicable\nin cases involving whether an adult knowingly and voluntarily waived his\nconstitutional rights. See Andrews v. State, 302 Ga. 809, 811 n.5 (809 SE2d\n746) (2018), overruled on other grounds by State v. Abbott, 303 Ga. 297 (812\nSE2d 225) (2018); Sewell v.

To the extent that language in these or other Georgia\nappellate cases indicates that the test for whether a defendant has knowingly\nand voluntarily waived his rights under Miranda is not the same for juveniles\nas it is for adults, that language is disapproved. See Fare, 442 U.S. at 725\n(explaining that the totality-of-the-circumstances test is used for determining\nwhether a juvenile has knowingly and voluntarily waived his constitutional\nrights, and that this same test is used for determining whether an adult has\nwaived his rights).\n                                       30\n\f     (c) We turn now to whether the trial court in this case applied\n\nthe proper standard\u2014the totality-of-the-circumstances test\u2014to\n\ndetermine whether Clark knowingly and voluntarily waived his\n\nrights under Miranda. As explained below, nothing in the record\n\nindicates that the court failed to apply the test, so Clark does not\n\nprevail on this claim.\n\n        (i) Near the beginning of the trial, the trial court held a\n\nhearing pursuant to Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368 (84 SCt 1774,\n\n12 LE2d 908) (1964), to determine the admissibility of the audio-\n\nrecording of Clark\u2019s interview with the lead investigator.       The\n\nevidence presented at the hearing, which included testimony from\n\nthe investigator and the recording of the interview, showed the\n\nfollowing. On the day after the shooting, the investigator spoke with\n\nClark\u2019s mother, who said that she did not know where Clark was;\n\naround 6:45 p.m., Clark and Kelly turned themselves in at the\n\nRichmond County Sheriff\u2019s Office; and at 8:15 p.m., the investigator\n\ninterviewed Clark for about an hour and 10 minutes. Clark, who\n\nwas then 16 years old, attended high school and was in the tenth\n\n                                 31\n\fgrade. He confirmed during the interview that he understood right\n\nfrom wrong; he understood English; and he did not have any \u201cmental\n\ndisorder\u201d or take any drugs that would prevent him from\n\nunderstanding the investigator\u2019s questions.              The investigator\n\ninformed Clark that he and Kelly were being charged with murder.\n\nHe then read to Clark the language that was contained on a \u201cWaiver\n\nof Counsel\u201d form; Clark wrote his initials next to each of the six\n\nrights listed on the form and signed it.17\n\n     Clark initially denied any knowledge of the shooting, saying\n\nthat he had not seen Kelly that night. During the course of the\n\ninterview, Clark said that he had \u201cbeen in trouble with the police\u201d\n\nbefore, and he understood that giving a false statement to a police\n\n\n     17 The form advised Clark that he could \u201cremain silent and [did] not have\nto make any statement at all\u201d; \u201cany statement which [he] might make\u201d could\n\u201cbe used against [him] in court\u201d; he had a \u201cright to consult with an attorney\nbefore making any statements and to have such attorney present with [him]\nwhile [he was] making a statement\u201d; if he did not have enough money to employ\nan attorney, he had \u201cthe right to have one appointed by the [c]ourt\u201d; if he\nrequested an attorney, \u201cno questions [would] be asked until an attorney [was]\npresent\u201d; and he could decide \u201cat any time to exercise these rights and not\nanswer any questions or make any statements.\u201d Just above the date and\nsignature lines, the form said, \u201cI have read this Waiver of Counsel and fully\nunderstand it. No threats or promises have been made to induce me to sign\nthis Waiver of Counsel.\u201d\n                                     32\n\fofficer was against the law.             At one point, Clark asked the\n\ninvestigator if he was going to be \u201clocked up,\u201d and the investigator\n\nreplied, \u201cYou have to be locked up for what happened.                    I have\n\nwarrants on you.\u201d When the investigator said that telling the truth\n\nmight \u201clook[] good\u201d if Clark \u201cwent to court,\u201d Clark mumbled\n\nsomething about \u201c30 years,\u201d and the investigator said, \u201cYou don\u2019t\n\nknow that.\u201d The investigator later asked if Clark knew the sentence\n\nfor murder, and Clark replied, \u201cLife.\u201d\n\n      About 35 minutes after the interview began, Clark said\n\nsomething like, \u201cI [inaudible] talk to a lawyer.\u201d18 The investigator\n\nasked, \u201cDo what?\u201d Clark again said something like, \u201cI [inaudible]\n\ntalk to a lawyer.\u201d The investigator said, \u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t\n\nwant to talk no more and you want to talk to a lawyer? Is that what\n\nyou\u2019re saying?\u201d Clark responded, \u201cI\u2019m saying I don\u2019t understand\n\nwhy you all got me for something I didn\u2019t do.\u201d The investigator then\n\nsaid that he had surveillance recordings showing Clark and Kelly\n\n\n\n      18Clark\u2019s trial counsel argued at the hearing that Clark said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to\na lawyer.\u201d\n                                       33\n\ftogether on the night of the murder.      Clark again denied any\n\ninvolvement, and asked about the evidence the investigator had.\n\nWhen the investigator asked Clark to \u201ctell the truth,\u201d he eventually\n\nadmitted that he was present when Kelly fired at King and his\n\ncompanions, although he claimed that he fled when the shooting\n\nbegan.\n\n     The investigator testified at the hearing that during the\n\ninterview, Clark did not appear to be intoxicated or suffering from\n\nany mental defects; he seemed to understand and coherently answer\n\nquestions; no one had threatened him or promised him anything;\n\nand he did not ask to speak with his mother or any other family\n\nmember. He also testified that the Richmond County Sheriff\u2019s Office\n\nhad a special form used to advise juveniles of their rights under\n\nMiranda, but he did not use that form for Clark. In addition, he\n\ntestified that about an hour and a half after the interview ended,\n\nClark said that he wanted to change his statement, saying that\n\nArchie was the shooter. About five minutes later, Clark repeated\n\nthat Kelly was actually the shooter and that he had tried to change\n\n                                34\n\fhis statement because he was \u201cscared\u201d of Kelly.\n\n     At the hearing, the parties argued about whether the\n\ninvestigator should have used the juvenile waiver-of-rights form and\n\nshould have advised Clark that a parent could be present during the\n\ninterview. They also argued about whether Clark unequivocally\n\ninvoked his right to counsel. In addition, the prosecutor asserted\n\nthat Clark\u2019s comments during the interview showed that he was\n\n\u201cwell versed in the criminal justice system.\u201d\n\n     The trial court ruled that the recording of the interview was\n\nadmissible. It concluded that Clark had not clearly invoked his right\n\nto counsel, pointing out that when the investigator tried to clarify\n\nwhether Clark wanted to talk to a lawyer, Clark replied, \u201cI\u2019m saying\n\nI don\u2019t understand why you got me for something I didn\u2019t do.\u201d 19 The\n\ncourt then stated that the investigator was not required to use a\n\njuvenile waiver-of-rights form and that Clark clearly \u201cunderstood\n\nwhat was going on\u201d and \u201cunderstood the system.\u201d The trial court\n\nruled that the State had shown by a preponderance of the evidence\n\n\n     19   Clark does not raise this issue on appeal.\n                                        35\n\fthat Clark was advised of his rights under Miranda, understood\n\nthem, and voluntarily waived them.\n\n      (ii) Nothing in the record suggests that the trial court failed\n\nto apply a totality-of-the-circumstances test. To the contrary, the\n\nrecord shows that the court reviewed the entire audio recording of\n\nthe interview, which contained pertinent information regarding\n\nClark\u2019s age, intelligence, education, previous experience with the\n\ncriminal justice system, and understanding of his rights under\n\nMiranda.   Moreover, during the hearing, the parties argued at\n\nlength about whether a juvenile waiver-of-rights form should have\n\nbeen used, whether Clark should have been advised that a parent\n\ncould be present during his interview, and whether Clark had\n\nclearly invoked his right to counsel when he mentioned \u201ctalk[ing] to\n\na lawyer.\u201d The prosecutor also asserted that the recording of the\n\ninterview, including Clark\u2019s comments about being \u201clocked up\u201d and\n\npotentially serving a sentence of \u201c30 years\u201d or \u201clife\u201d in prison for\n\nmurder, showed that he was familiar with the criminal justice\n\nsystem.\n\n                                 36\n\f     In ruling that the recording of the interview was admissible,\n\nthe trial court expressly concluded that a juvenile waiver-of-rights\n\nform was not required, that Clark had not invoked his right to\n\ncounsel, and that he understood \u201cwhat was going on\u201d and understood\n\nthe criminal justice \u201csystem.\u201d Although the court did not expressly\n\nacknowledge other factors that may have been pertinent in\n\nanalyzing the totality of the circumstances, \u201cwe generally do not\n\nrequire trial courts to make specific, on-the-record findings about\n\neach aspect of the totality of the circumstances they evaluate or to\n\nmake \u2018explicit factual findings or credibility determinations on the\n\nrecord.\u2019\u201d   Lester v. State, 310 Ga. 81, 86 (849 SE2d 425) (2020)\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n     In sum, we see no indication that the trial court failed to apply\n\na totality-of-the-circumstances test in determining whether Clark\n\nknowingly and voluntarily waived his rights under Miranda.\n\nClark\u2019s claim therefore fails.20 See Holmes v. State, 311 Ga. 698, 706\n\n\n     20  Because Clark contends only that the trial court applied the wrong\nlegal test and does not contend that the court erred in concluding that he\n\n                                    37\n\f(859 SE2d 475) (2021) (\u201c\u2018Trial judges . . . are presumed to know the\n\nlaw and apply it in making their decisions, absent some indication\n\nin the record suggesting otherwise.\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted). See also\n\nDrennon v. State, 314 Ga. 854, 860 (880 SE2d 139) (2022)\n\n(explaining that when a trial court evaluates the general grounds as\n\nthe \u201cthirteenth juror,\u201d we presume that the court understood the\n\nnature of its discretion and exercised it, unless the record shows\n\notherwise, even if the court did not explicitly speak of its discretion\n\nwith respect to the general grounds).\n\n      4. Clark also asserts that the trial court committed plain error\n\nby failing to instruct the jury on knowledge, grave suspicion, mere\n\npresence, and mere association. These instructions were necessary,\n\nClark says, to inform the jurors that in order to find him guilty as a\n\nparty to the crimes against King, the jury would be required to\n\ndetermine that he shared a common criminal intent with Kelly. As\n\nClark acknowledges, his trial counsel did not object to the omission\n\n\n\nknowingly and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights under the proper\ntest, we do not address that issue.\n                                    38\n\fof these instructions, so we review this claim for plain error only. To\n\nestablish plain error, Clark must show that the alleged instructional\n\nerror \u201c\u2018was not affirmatively waived; was clear and obvious, rather\n\nthan subject to reasonable dispute; likely affected the outcome of the\n\ntrial; and seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d Collins v. State, 312 Ga. 727,\n\n738 (864 SE2d 85) (2021) (citation omitted). \u201c\u2018An appellant must\n\nestablish all four elements of the test in order to demonstrate plain\n\nerror, so satisfying this test is difficult, as it should be.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation\n\nomitted). Because Clark has not met his burden of proving that the\n\ntrial court clearly and obviously erred, or that any such error likely\n\naffected the outcome of his trial, he has failed to establish plain\n\nerror.\n\n     In evaluating a claim that the trial court was required to give\n\ncertain jury instructions, \u201c\u2018we view the charge as a whole to\n\ndetermine whether the jury was fully and fairly instructed.\u2019\u201d Lopez\n\nv. State, 310 Ga. 529, 537 (852 SE2d 547) (2020) (citation omitted).\n\nDuring the final charge, the trial court read the indictment to the\n\n                                     39\n\fjury and provided instructions on the presumption of innocence and\n\nthe State\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each essential\n\nelement of the charged crimes. The court also instructed on felony\n\nmurder and aggravated assault, saying, among other things, that\n\nfelony murder \u201crequire[s] that the defendant possess the requisite\n\ncriminal intent to commit the underlying felony\u201d and that\n\naggravated assault requires \u201cthat the defendant intentionally\n\ncommitted an act which placed the alleged victim in reasonable fear\n\nof immediately receiving a violent injury.\u201d The court told the jury\n\nthat \u201c[i]ntent is an essential element of any crime and must be\n\nproved by the State beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and that \u201c[Clark]\n\nwill not be presumed to have acted with criminal intent.\u201d           In\n\naddition, the trial court thoroughly and accurately instructed on\n\nparties to a crime, specifically telling the jury that a person may be\n\nconvicted as a party to a crime if he intentionally aided or abetted in\n\nthe commission of the crime or intentionally advised or encouraged\n\nanother to commit the crime. Thus, the jury was fully informed that\n\nit was not authorized to find Clark guilty as a party to the crimes\n\n                                  40\n\funless he shared Kelly\u2019s criminal intent to shoot King.\n\n     When evaluated in the context of the jury instructions as a\n\nwhole, the trial court\u2019s failure to expressly instruct on knowledge,\n\ngrave suspicion, mere presence, and mere association did not create\n\na clear and obvious error beyond reasonable dispute with respect to\n\nthe jury\u2019s understanding of criminal intent. See, e.g., Adkins v.\n\nState, 314 Ga. 477, 483 (877 SE2d 582) (2022) (holding that the trial\n\ncourt did not err by failing to instruct the jury on grave suspicion,\n\n\u201cbecause the concept was covered in other jury instructions\u201d);\n\nDowney v. State, 298 Ga. 568, 574 (783 SE2d 622) (2016) (explaining\n\nthat trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the\n\nomission of a jury instruction on knowledge, because the charge as\n\na whole sufficiently informed the jury of the knowledge required for\n\na defendant to be convicted as a party to the crimes); Simmons v.\n\nState, 282 Ga. 183, 188 (646 SE2d 55) (2007) (holding that the trial\n\ncourt did not err by failing to instruct the jury on mere presence and\n\nguilt by association, because \u201cmere presence is only a corollary to\n\nthe requirement that the State prove each element of the crime\n\n                                 41\n\fcharged, and . . . the trial court\u2019s instructions clearly informed the\n\njury of this requirement\u201d).\n\n     For the same reason, Clark has not established that there is a\n\nreasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been\n\nmore favorable to him had the trial court given these instructions.\n\nSee Downey, 298 Ga. at 574-575. See also, e.g., Walker v. State, 311\n\nGa. 719, 724-725 (859 SE2d 25) (2021) (holding that an allegedly\n\nimproper jury instruction did not likely affect the outcome of the\n\nappellant\u2019s trial under the third part of the plain-error test, because\n\nthe charge as a whole adequately instructed the jury as to how to\n\ndetermine his guilt); Cochran v. State, 305 Ga. 827, 832 (828 SE2d\n\n338) (2019) (holding that trial counsel\u2019s withdrawal of a requested\n\njury instruction on mere presence did not prejudice the appellant,\n\nbecause other instructions sufficiently covered that point).\n\nAccordingly, Clark has not met his high burden of proving plain\n\nerror.\n\n     5. Finally, Clark argues that his trial counsel provided\n\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to request the jury\n\n                                  42\n\finstructions discussed above and by failing to file a demurrer to the\n\nindictment. To prevail on these claims, Clark must show that his\n\nlawyer\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient and that he\n\nsuffered prejudice as a result. See Strickland v. Washington, 466\n\nU.S. 668, 687 (104 SCt 2052, 80 LE2d 674) (1984). To prove deficient\n\nperformance, Clark must demonstrate that his counsel \u201c\u2018performed\n\nat trial in an objectively unreasonable way considering all the\n\ncircumstances and in the light of prevailing professional norms.\u2019\u201d\n\nLewis v. State, 314 Ga. 654, 668 (878 SE2d 467) (2022) (citation\n\nomitted). See also Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688-689. To establish\n\nprejudice, Clark must show a reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel\u2019s deficient performance, the result of the trial would have\n\nbeen different. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694; Lewis, 878 SE2d at\n\n479. We need not address both components of the Strickland test if\n\nClark makes an insufficient showing on one. See Strickland, 466\n\nU.S. at 697; Lewis, 878 SE2d at 479.\n\n     (a) Clark first claims that his trial counsel provided\n\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to request jury\n\n                                 43\n\finstructions on knowledge, grave suspicion, mere presence, and\n\nmere association. As we explained in Division 4 above, the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s omission of the instructions Clark now says should have been\n\ngiven was not an obvious or harmful error under plain-error review.\n\nEven if we assume that trial counsel performed deficiently by failing\n\nto request the instructions, Clark has not established that any such\n\ndeficiency resulted in prejudice, given that \u201c\u2018[t]he test for prejudice\n\nin the ineffective assistance analysis is equivalent to the test for\n\nharm in plain error review.\u2019\u201d Harris v. State, 310 Ga. 372, 385 (850\n\nSE2d 77) (2020) (citation omitted).         This claim of ineffective\n\nassistance therefore fails.\n\n     (b)   Clark   also   asserts    that   his   trial   counsel   was\n\nconstitutionally ineffective for failing to file a general demurrer to\n\nthe felony-murder count in the indictment. Because counsel did not\n\nperform deficiently in this regard, Clark cannot succeed on this\n\nclaim.\n\n     \u201c\u2018A general demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nsubstance of the indictment,\u2019 and asks whether it is capable of\n\n                                    44\n\f\u2018supporting a conviction.\u2019\u201d Budhani v. State, 306 Ga. 315, 319 (830\n\nSE2d 195) (2019) (citation omitted). An indictment is void to the\n\nextent it fails to allege all of the essential elements of the charged\n\ncrime. See id. To that end, an indictment is subject to a general\n\ndemurrer \u201c\u2018if the accused could admit each and every fact alleged in\n\nthe indictment and still be innocent of any crime.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation\n\nomitted). If, on the other hand, the admission of the facts alleged in\n\nthe indictment leads to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty\n\nof the charged crime, the indictment is sufficient. See id.\n\n     The indictment charged Clark with felony murder \u201cwhile in the\n\ncommission of the felony of [a]ggravated [a]ssault\u201d by \u201ccaus[ing] the\n\ndeath of . . . King . . . by shooting him with an unknown type\n\nhandgun, a deadly weapon[.]\u201d This language substantially tracked\n\nOCGA \u00a7 16-5-1 (c), which defines felony murder as \u201ccaus[ing] the\n\ndeath of another human being irrespective of malice\u201d while \u201cin the\n\ncommission of a felony.\u201d And OCGA \u00a7 16-5-21 (b) provides that the\n\ncrime of aggravated assault is a felony. Thus, the felony-murder\n\ncount in the indictment was sufficient to withstand a general\n\n                                 45\n\fdemurrer, \u201cbecause [Clark] cannot admit he caused the death of the\n\nvictim while in the commission of aggravated assault and not be\n\nguilty of the crime [of felony murder].\u201d Stinson v. State, 279 Ga. 177,\n\n179 & n.2 (611 SE2d 52) (2005) (holding that an indictment charging\n\nthe appellant with felony murder by causing the death of the victim\n\n\u201c\u2018while in the commission of a felony, to wit: aggravated assault\u2019\u201d\n\nwas not subject to a general demurrer). See also Smith v. State, 313\n\nGa. 752, 758-759 (873 SE2d 142) (2022) (determining that an\n\nindictment charging the appellant with felony murder by causing\n\nthe victim\u2019s death \u201c\u2018while in the commission of the offense of\n\naggravated assault, a felony, and/or aggravated battery, a felony\u2019\u201d\n\nwas sufficient to withstand a general demurrer). 21\n\n      Clark nevertheless argues that the indictment was flawed\n\nbecause it did not charge him with a count of aggravated assault\n\nagainst King.      Such a charge was necessary, he says, because\n\naggravated assault was the felony that formed the basis of the\n\n\n\n       Clark does not argue that the indictment failed to contain the essential\n      21\n\nelements of the underlying crime of aggravated assault.\n                                      46\n\ffelony-murder count. But it is well settled that \u201c\u2018the crime of [felony]\n\nmurder is independent of the underlying felony. . . . Therefore, the\n\nunderlying felony need not be charged as a separate substantive\n\noffense[.]\u2019\u201d State v. Jones, 274 Ga. 287, 288 (553 SE2d 612) (2001)\n\n(citation omitted). See also Freeman v. State, 297 Ga. 146, 150 (771\n\nSE2d 889) (2015) (noting that OCGA \u00a7 16-5-1 (c) does \u201cnot require\n\nthat the defendant be charged and convicted of the underlying\n\nfelony. The jury must simply find that the defendant committed or\n\nattempted to commit it\u201d) (citation and punctuation omitted),\n\noverruled on other grounds by Collier v. State, 307 Ga. 363 (834\n\nSE2d 769) (2019). Cf. Smith, 313 Ga. at 758-759 (determining that\n\na one-count indictment charging the appellant with felony murder\n\nbased on aggravated assault was sufficient to withstand a general\n\ndemurrer); Stinson, 279 Ga. at 179 (same). Thus, the indictment\n\nwas not defective in this respect.\n\n     Because a general demurrer to the indictment on the ground\n\nthat it failed to charge Clark with aggravated assault would have\n\nbeen meritless, Clark has not shown that his trial counsel performed\n\n                                     47\n\fdeficiently. See Smith, 313 Ga. at 759 (holding that trial counsel\n\nwas not deficient for failing to file a general demurrer, because such\n\na filing would have been meritless). Accordingly, he cannot prevail\n\non this ineffective-assistance claim.\n\n     Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                  48\n\f",
