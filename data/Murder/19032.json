            "opinion_text": "\f                              To overcome the procedural bars, appellant claimed that\n                Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. , 130 S. Ct. 2011 (2010), provided good\n                cause to challenge his sentence. Even assuming Graham provided good\n                cause, appellant waited approximately two years from the issuance of that\n                decision and failed to explain the entire delay. See Hathaway v. State, 119\n                Nev. 248, 252, 71 P.3d 503, 506 (2003). In addition, appellant cannot\n                demonstrate actual prejudice related to the Graham decision. In Graham,\n                the Supreme Court determined that the Eighth Amendment barred\n                imposition of sentences of life without the possibility of parole for juvenile\n                offenders who did not commit homicide. 560 U.S. at , 130 S. Ct. at\n                2034. Because appellant was convicted of first-degree murder, the\n                Graham decision had no bearing on his sentence. Therefore, the district\n                court did not err in denying the petition as procedurally barred.\n                Accordingly, we\n                              ORDER the judgment of the district court AFFIRMED. 4\n\n\n\n\n                                         Hardesty\n\n\n                  COO- Ct-52---k7\"---77\n                Parraguirre                                            Cherry\n\n\n\n                      4We have reviewed all documents that appellant has submitted in\n                proper person to the clerk of this court in this matter, and we conclude\n                that no relief based upon those submissions is warranted. To the extent\n                that appellant has attempted to present claims or facts in those\n                submissions which were not previously presented in the proceedings\n                below, we have declined to consider them in the first instance.\n\n\nSUPREME COURT\n        OF\n     NEVADA\n                                                             2\n(0) 1947A\n\n                                              114191121MBENt, '`VANIXE/k-LZ,5,M\n                                                           ':.=\n\f                cc: Hon.
