Thumma joined.\n\n\nJ O N E S, Judge:\n\n\u00b61            While on duty, deputy sheriff John France was assaulted by a\nmanic gunman, who, screaming in rage, aimed a shotgun at France\u2019s chest\nand face from close range before the gunman was shot and killed by France\nand his partner. In this statutory special action, France challenges the\ndenial of workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his resulting post-traumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD).\n\n\u00b62             For workers\u2019 compensation purposes, a \u201cmental injury, illness\nor condition . . . is not compensable . . . unless some unexpected, unusual or\nextraordinary stress related to the employment . . . was a substantial\ncontributing cause of the mental injury, illness or condition.\u201d Ariz. Rev.\nStat. (A.R.S.) \u00a7 23-1043.01(B).1 In this Opinion, we interpret the phrase\n\u201cunexpected, unusual or extraordinary stress\u201d contained within A.R.S. \u00a7 23-\n1043.01(B) to mean that the injury-inducing stress, imposed upon the\nclaimant by virtue of his employment, was sufficiently significant and\nnoteworthy to differentiate it from non-compensable, general stress caused\nby the work regimen. Applying that standard to the facts presented here,\nwe set aside the Industrial Commission of Arizona (ICA) decision and\naward denying France\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\n\n\n\n\n1      Absent material changes from the relevant date, we cite the current\nversion of rules and statutes.\n\n\n                                      2\n\f                FRANCE v. GILA/ARIZONA COUNTIES\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n                 FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\u00b63           In June 2017, France and another deputy sheriff were\ndispatched to a residence investigate a person threatening to kill himself\nwith a shotgun.2 When they arrived at the house, a man burst through the\ndoorway between them, holding a shotgun in a shooting stance. The man\npointed the shotgun at France and screamed in rage. The man rushed\ntoward France, his shotgun only a few feet away from France\u2019s face and\ntorso, and ignored repeated requests to drop his weapon. With the man\nbetween them, neither officer could act without endangering the other.\nFrance eventually backed around the corner of the house with the gunman\nin pursuit. When the officers were no longer within each other\u2019s line of fire,\nthey each shot the man several times before he finally fell to the ground,\nwhere France watched him die.\n\n\u00b64             By mid-July 2017, France had been diagnosed with PTSD as a\nresult of this trauma and filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim. The Gila\nCounty Sheriff\u2019s Office and its insurer (collectively, GCSO) conceded that\nFrance suffers from PTSD caused by work-related stress but disagreed that\nthe injury arose out of \u201csome unexpected, unusual, or extraordinary stress\nrelated to the employment.\u201d France challenged the denial of his claim.\n\n\u00b65             After considering evidence of the training and responsibilities\nof law enforcement officers, the administrative law judge (ALJ) found, both\ninitially and later upon review, that France was exposed to the \u201csame stress\nthat any other Gila County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy would have faced under the\nsame circumstances, and therefore [France\u2019s] job-related stress was not\nunusual, unexpected or extraordinary.\u201d The ALJ noted that, although\nFrance presented expert medical testimony that the incident \u201cwas\npsychologically extraordinary,\u201d this \u201cd[id] not mean that it was legally\nextraordinary.\u201d She then reasoned that \u201cto accept [France\u2019s] claim as an\nindustrial responsibility would reduce industrial insurance to a general\nhealth and accident insurance, which it is not.\u201d3\n\n\n\n2      We view the facts and all inferences to be drawn therefrom in the\nlight most favorable to upholding the ICA\u2019s findings and award. Polanco v.\nIndus. Comm\u2019n, 214 Ariz. 489, 490-91, \u00b6 2 (App. 2007) (quoting Roberts v.\nIndus. Comm\u2019n, 162 Ariz. 108, 110 (1989)).\n\n3      The ALJ did not consider France\u2019s argument that A.R.S. \u00a7 23-\n1043.01(B), is unconstitutional as applied to claimants \u201cwho work in high-\n\n\n\n                                      3\n\f                 FRANCE v. GILA/ARIZONA COUNTIES\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00b66            France timely petitions for special action review of the ICA\u2019s\ndecision and award. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-\n120.21(A)(2), 23-951(A), and Arizona Rule of Procedure for Special Actions\n10.\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n\u00b67             Almost since statehood, workers\u2019 compensation has been a\ncritical part of Arizona law. In 1925, Arizonans approved an amendment\nto the Arizona Constitution requiring the legislature to enact a workers\u2019\ncompensation law for those \u201cengaged in manual or mechanical labor in all\npublic employment.\u201d Ariz. Const. art. 18, \u00a7 8. The Arizona Constitution\nthus mandates that:\n\n       compensation shall be required to be paid to any such\n       workman, in case of his injury . . . by his employer, if in the\n       course of such employment personal injury to or death of any\n       such workman from any accident arising out of and in the\n       course of, such employment, is caused in whole, or in part, or\n       is contributed to, by a necessary risk or danger of such\n       employment, or a necessary risk or danger inherent in the\n       nature thereof . . . .\n\nId. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act) was enacted in response to\nthis directive. Grammatico v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 211 Ariz. 67, 70, \u00b6 13 (2005).\n\n\u00b68            Now codified at A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 23-901 to -1105, the Act provides an\nadministrative compensation system for workers injured in the course of\ntheir employment. Twin City Fire Ins. v. Leija, 244 Ariz. 493, 495, \u00b6 11 (2018).\nOver time, the legislature has expanded the types of injuries covered by the\nAct, and, in 1980, the legislature enacted A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1043.01(B) to include\nmental injuries. See 1980 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 246, \u00a7 32 (2nd Reg. Sess.).\nUnder that statute:\n\n       A mental injury, illness or condition shall not be considered a\n       personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of\n       employment and is not compensable . . . unless some\n       unexpected, unusual or extraordinary stress related to the\n       employment or some physical injury related to the\n\n\n\n\nstress occupations.\u201d Because we set aside the ICA\u2019s decision and award,\nwe need not address this argument.\n\n\n                                       4\n\f                 FRANCE v. GILA/ARIZONA COUNTIES\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n       employment was a substantial contributing cause of the\n       mental injury, illness or condition.\n\nA.R.S. \u00a7 23-1043.01(B).\n\n\u00b69             France challenges the ALJ\u2019s determination that his\nconfrontation with the gunman in June 2017 did not constitute an\n\u201cunexpected, unusual or extraordinary stress related to the employment\u201d\nwithin the meaning of A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1043.01(B). Although the ALJ\u2019s factual\nfindings are reviewed for an abuse of discretion, the scope and application\nof A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1043.01(B) present legal questions subject to de novo review.\nSee Ibarra v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 245 Ariz. 171, 174, \u00b6 12 (App. 2018) (citing PF\nChang\u2019s v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 216 Ariz. 344, 347, \u00b6 13 (App. 2007)).\n\n\u00b610            Pursuant to our supreme court\u2019s direction, we construe the\nAct liberally to accomplish its remedial purpose: to protect employees\ninjured while performing work-related activity. Engler v. Gulf Interstate\nEng\u2019g, 230 Ariz. 55, 59, \u00b6 15 (2012) (citing Robarge v. Bechtel Power Corp., 131\nAriz. 280, 282 (App. 1982), and Grammatico, 211 Ariz. at 72, \u00b6 23); accord\nEnglish v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 73 Ariz. 86, 89 (1951) (\u201cThe Workmen\u2019s\nCompensation Act was enacted to protect the workman and to relieve\nsociety of the burden caused by industrial accidents. Industry is chargeable\nwith and must bear the burden of the loss by injury and death to the human\nmachine.\u201d) (collecting cases). We \u201cmust [also] take into consideration the\nprinciple that every statute has to be read in the light of the constitution,\u201d\nGoodyear Aircraft Corp. v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 62 Ariz. 398, 407 (1945), and will\navoid an interpretation that renders the statute unconstitutional, Brenda D.\nv. Dep\u2019t of Child Safety, 243 Ariz. 437, 444, \u00b6 23 (2018) (citing Bus. Realty of\nAz., Inc. v. Maricopa Cty., 181 Ariz. 551, 559 (1995), and Hayes v. Cont\u2019l Ins.,\n178 Ariz. 264, 273 (1994)).\n\n\u00b611          Here, after considering evidence that GCSO deputies are\ntrained \u201cto deal with a variety of dangerous situations on the job,\u201d\nincluding \u201cdeciding whether to shoot or not shoot a subject in the line of\nduty,\u201d the ALJ determined \u201c[t]here is nothing in the\u201d incident \u201cthat sets this\nsituation apart from the normal duties of a\u201d GCSO deputy. Concluding\nFrance \u201cwas not subjected to any greater stress than any other\u201d deputy\nduring the incident, the ALJ concluded that incident was not unusual,\nunexpected, or extraordinary, and, as a result, denied France\u2019s claim.\n\n\u00b612           At first blush, prior cases addressing mental injuries seem to\nsuggest that a claimant seeking compensation for a work-related emotional\ninjury must prove the injury-causing event was not contemplated as part of\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\f                 FRANCE v. GILA/ARIZONA COUNTIES\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhis job responsibilities. See, e.g., Sloss v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 121 Ariz. 10, 11-12\n(1978) (affirming the non-compensability of a claim for mental injury where\nthe claimant \u201cwas exposed to nothing other than the usual ordinary and\nexpected incidents of his job as a Highway Patrolman\u201d). But France does\nnot assert a gradual or chronic mental injury, see id.; Verdugo v. Indus.\nComm\u2019n, 114 Ariz. 477, 479 (App. 1977); Muse v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 27 Ariz.\nApp. 312, 314 (1976), or that his mental injury was caused by concerns\nregarding job security, Lapare v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 154 Ariz. 318, 319 (App.\n1987), his subjective underlying psychiatric makeup, Archer v. Indus.\nComm\u2019n, 127 Ariz. 199, 205 (App. 1980),4 or perceived conflicts with his\nsupervisor, Barnes v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 156 Ariz. 179, 180-81 (App. 1988); Pima\nCmty. Coll. v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 137 Ariz. 137, 138-39 (App. 1983). In those\ncases \u2014 which differ from France\u2019s claim here \u2014 the circumstances\nsurrounding a claimant\u2019s employment and job duties were relevant to\ndetermining whether the mental injury complained of was attributable to\nthe \u201cstress related to the employment,\u201d A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1043.01(B), rather than\nthe non-compensable failings of the human machine \u201cinherent in life,\ngenerally,\u201d Ziv v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 160 Ariz. 330, 334 (App. 1989).\n\n\u00b613            The issue to be resolved here, where the confrontation that\nprecipitated France\u2019s PTSD was undoubtedly work-related, was not\nwhether the event itself was \u201cunexpected, unusual or extraordinary,\u201d but\nwhether the stress France was exposed to as a result of his employment was\n\u201cunexpected, unusual or extraordinary.\u201d It is, of course, events that create\nstress, but the distinction, however subtle, has meaning. An event \u2014 such\nas the dispatch of a law enforcement officer to investigate a report of\nthreatened violence \u2014 may be routine. The stress of the event \u2014 which\nhere included staring down the barrel of a loaded shotgun held by a\nscreaming manic gunman, careful repositioning to avoid injury to a fellow\nofficer, and shooting and killing another human being at point-blank range\n\n4      Our supreme court has confirmed that Archer\u2019s discussion of\nunexpected, unusual, or extraordinary stress no longer applies to heart-\nrelated injuries, which now, by statute, need not arise from any particular\ntype of stress. See A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1043.01(A) (stating heart-related injuries are\ncompensable if \u201csome injury, stress or exertion related to the employment\nwas a substantial contributing cause\u201d); Bush v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 136 Ariz. 522,\n524 (1983) (confirming that the nature of stress as unexpected, unusual, or\nextraordinary is not necessary to establish a right to compensation for a\nheart-related injury). The discussion and conclusions in Archer remain\nsound as applied to mental injuries, which are compensable if \u201csome\nunexpected, unusual or extraordinary stress related to the employment . . .\nwas a substantial contributing cause.\u201d A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1043.01(B).\n\n\n                                       6\n\f                FRANCE v. GILA/ARIZONA COUNTIES\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\u2014 may not be. Yet, the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding France\u2019s training and job\nduties indicate it focused upon the nature of the event, rather than the\nnature of the stress. This was error, and the ICA\u2019s decision and award must\nbe set aside.\n\n\u00b614            Moreover, the ALJ defined \u201cunexpected\u201d as \u201cnot expected,\nunforeseen,\u201d \u201cunusual\u201d as \u201cnot usual,\u201d and \u201cextraordinary\u201d as \u201cgoing\nbeyond what is usual, regular or customary.\u201d In doing so, the ALJ conflated\nthe terms \u201cunexpected,\u201d \u201cextraordinary,\u201d and \u201cunusual,\u201d rendering the\nterms redundant. But, the legislature\u2019s decision to use these words suggests\nit understood there to be a difference between the three. See State v. Harm,\n236 Ariz. 402, 407, \u00b6 19 & n.4 (App. 2015) (\u201c[W]hen the legislature chooses\ndifferent words within a statutory scheme, we presume those distinctions\nare meaningful and evidence an intent to give a different meaning and\nconsequence to the alternate language.\u201d) (citations omitted). Indeed, \u201c[w]e\npresume the legislature avoids redundancy in favor of concision.\u201d Saban\nRent-a-Car L.L.C. v. Ariz. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 246 Ariz. 89, 97, \u00b6 29 (2019); see\nalso Obregon v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 217 Ariz. 612, 615, \u00b6 16 (App. 2008) (\u201c[E]ach\nword or phrase in a statute must be given meaning so that no part is\nrendered void, superfluous, contradictory, or insignificant.\u201d) (citing Pinal\nVista Props., L.L.C. v. Turnbull, 208 Ariz. 188, 190, \u00b6 10 (App. 2004)).\n\n\u00b615            The phrase \u201cunexpected, unusual or extraordinary stress\nrelated to the employment\u201d must be read as a whole and in a more general\nsense to mean, simply, that the injury-inducing stress imposed upon the\nclaimant by virtue of his employment was sufficiently significant and\nnoteworthy to differentiate it from the daily wear and tear of living. In this\ncontext, the \u201chypothetical \u2018reasonable person\u2019 working alongside\nclaimant,\u201d identified in Barnes and generally relied upon to analyze\ncompensability in other cases is not without purpose; the comparison of a\nclaimant to a similarly situated person is limited, however, to providing a\nyardstick by which to distinguish \u201cthe work related nature of the\n[particularized] injury as compared to non-work related stress.\u201d Barnes, 156\nAriz. at 183.\n\n\u00b616           We do not suggest that every situation in which a law\nenforcement officer draws a weapon or uses deadly force will result in a\ncompensable claim; a causal connection between the employment-related\nevent and the alleged mental injury must also be established, see A.R.S. \u00a7 23-\n1043.01(B) \u2014 typically through expert testimony, see DeSchaaf v. Indus.\nComm\u2019n, 141 Ariz. 318, 320 (App. 1984) (citing Allen v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 124\nAriz. 173, 175 (App. 1979)).
