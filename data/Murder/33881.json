In any event, there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s contention. The challenged questions were based on information derived from the Grand Jury proceedings. Therefore, the prosecutor had a good-faith basis for asking them (People v Sealy, 167 AD2d 362).\nThe defendant\u2019s remaining contentions do not warrant reversal. Balletta, J. P., Miller, Santucci and Altman, JJ., concur.\n",
