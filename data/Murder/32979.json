County Court subsequently sentenced him, as agreed, to a prison term of 22 years to life. Defendant now appeals.\nAppellate counsel for defendant seeks to be relieved of his assignment, arguing that no nonfrivolous issues exist. After reviewing the record, we agree. The judgment is accordingly affirmed and counsel\u2019s applic\u00e1tion for leave to withdraw is granted (see People v Cruwys, 113 AD2d 979, 980 [1985], lv denied 67 NY2d 650 [1986]).\nCardona, P.J., Rose, Lahtinen, Garry and Egan Jr., JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, and application to be relieved of assignment granted.\n",
