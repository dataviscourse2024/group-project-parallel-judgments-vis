Martinez, Public Defender, and Jonathan Greenberg, Assistant\nPublic Defender, for appellant.\n\n     Pamela Jo Bondi, Attorney General, and Linda S. Katz, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, for appellee.\n\n\nBefore FERNANDEZ, LOGUE, and SCALES, JJ.\n\n     LOGUE, J.\n\f      The defendant, Joseph Carter, seeks review of the trial court\u2019s denial of his\n\n3.850 motion for postconviction relief challenging the constitutionality of his\n\naggregate sentence of 152 years in prison, with parole. We reverse.\n\n      In 1979, the defendant, who was a minor at the time, was found guilty of\n\nburglary and sexual battery and was sentenced to a total of 152 years for both\n\ncounts, with parole.1 In 1982, he was given a presumptive parole release date\n\n(PPRD) of March 25, 1993. The PPRD was pushed back, however, due to various\n\ndisciplinary reports. From 2007 forward, the defendant did not have any\n\ndisciplinary reports and in 2007, his PPRD was set for March 2016.\n\n      In December 2015, the defendant was interviewed by a parole commission\n\ninvestigator regarding the possibility of parole. The investigator recommended\n\nparole.   However, in April 2016, the parole commission denied parole and\n\nprovided that the defendant \u201cwill be Reinterviewed for [his] Extraordinary\n\nInterview during the month of October, 2022.\u201d\n\n      The defendant argued in his postconviction motion that the aggregate\n\nsentence of 152 years was a de facto life sentence of a minor and therefore\n\nunconstitutional under Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48 (2010) and Henry v. State,\n\n175 So. 3d 675 (Fla. 2015). His sentence was unconstitutional, he contended,\n\n\n1 The defendant was sentenced to 137 years for the burglary count and 15 years for\nthe sexual battery count. The conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct\nappeal in Carter v. State, 410 So. 2d 552 (Fla. 3d DCA 1982).\n\n                                        2\n\fbecause his parole eligibility was not a meaningful opportunity for release. The\n\ndefendant sought resentencing under sections 775.082(3)(c) and 921.1401, Florida\n\nStatutes (2014). The trial court denied his motion and this appeal followed.\n\n      Notwithstanding the fact that he will be reevaluated for the possibility of\n\nparole in 2022, we conclude the defendant is correct and that he is entitled to\n\nresentencing under sections 775.082(3)(c) and 921.1401. See Atwell v. State, 197\n\nSo. 3d 1040, 1048 (Fla. 2016) (\u201cIn most respects, a sentence of life with the\n\npossibility of parole for first-degree murder, based on the way Florida\u2019s parole\n\nprocess operates under the existing statutory scheme, actually resembles a\n\nmandatorily imposed life sentence without parole that is not \u2018proportionate to the\n\noffense and the offender.\u2019\u201d (quoting Horsley v. State, 160 So. 3d 393, 406 (Fla.\n\n2015))); Henry v. State, 175 So. 3d 675, 680 (Fla. 2015), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct.\n\n1455 (2016) (\u201cBecause we have determined that [the defendant\u2019s] sentence is\n\nunconstitutional under Graham, we conclude that [the defendant] should be\n\nresentenced in light of the new juvenile sentencing legislation enacted by the\n\nFlorida Legislature in 2014, ch.2014\u2013220, Laws of Fla.\u201d); Miller v. State, 42 Fla.\n\nL. Weekly D51 at *1 n.1 (Fla. 3d DCA Jan. 25, 2017) (\u201cThe State\u2019s contention that\n\n[the defendant] was parole-eligible as early as twelve years after the commission of\n\nfirst-degree murder is irrelevant.\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f      We therefore reverse the defendant\u2019s aggregate 152-year sentence for\n\nburglary and sexual battery and remand to the trial court for the appropriate\n\nresentencing under section 775.082(3)(c), Florida Statutes and section 921.1401,\n\nFlorida Statutes.\n\n      Reversed and remanded with instructions.\n\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\f",
