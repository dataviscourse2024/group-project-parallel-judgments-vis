PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 19.02(b)(1) (Vernon 2011).\n\fIn three issues, appellant contends that the trial court erred in not admonishing him\n\nof the potential immigration consequences of his guilty plea, the trial court erred in\n\nnot making certain findings before accepting his guilty plea,2 and, as a result, he\n\nentered his guilty plea involuntarily. In its sole cross-point, the State requests\n\nreformation of clerical errors in the judgment.\n\n      We reverse and remand.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      At his arraignment, the trial court advised appellant as to the range of\n\npunishment for the offense of murder, but it did not provide any further\n\nadmonitions. Appellant testified that he discussed his case at length with his trial\n\ncounsel, including all potential defensive theories and strategies. However, despite\n\nhis trial counsel\u2019s presentation of various possible defensive strategies, appellant\n\nchose to plead guilty to committing the 2004 murder of Soeuth Nay, the\n\n\u201ccomplainant,\u201d and for a jury to assess his punishment.\n\n      During the trial on the issue of punishment, Tavey Mao, the complainant\u2019s\n\ncousin, testified that he saw appellant threaten the complainant with a firearm near\n\nthe time of his murder.\n\n      N.M. testified that she thought highly of the complainant and that her family\n\nhad hoped she would marry him when she was older.              However, she feared\n\n\n2\n      See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 26.13 (Vernon Supp. 2017).\n                                          2\n\fappellant, explaining that when she was twelve years old, he kissed her against her\n\nwill while she babysat his son. And after the complainant\u2019s disappearance in 2004,\n\nwhen N.M. was fourteen years old, appellant called to tell her that the complainant\n\n\u201cwas gone.\u201d Shortly thereafter, N.M. ran into appellant. He offered to buy her a\n\nsoft drink, and she got into his car because she was afraid to refuse his offer.\n\nAppellant then drove her to a motel where he sexually assaulted her.\n\n      N.H., appellant\u2019s former \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and the mother of two of his children,\n\ntestified that they began a \u201crelationship\u201d when she was fifteen years old and he was\n\nmuch older. During their on-and-off relationship, which lasted for six or seven\n\nyears, he was violent towards her and would point a firearm at her when he was\n\nangry. Appellant even fired a shot at her one time while she was pregnant. In\n\n2004, on the night of the complainant\u2019s murder, appellant insisted that N.H. go to\n\nwork even though she was not scheduled to do so. Later that evening, when she\n\ntelephoned him after her shift for a ride home, he did not answer, despite\n\nattempting to reach him numerous times. N.H. took a cab home and discovered\n\nthat appellant had left their two young children home alone. When he arrived\n\nhome later that night, he went straight to the bathroom to wash his hands and\n\nclothing. N.H. explained that she and her children subsequently fled with appellant\n\nto live with his mother in Alvin, Texas. Less than a month later, appellant moved\n\nto Florida. He later admitted to N.H. that he had shot and killed the complainant.\n\n\n                                         3\n\f      M.S., who had been in a \u201crelationship\u201d with appellant before N.H., and is the\n\nmother of two of his children, testified that she met appellant when she was\n\nthirteen years old and he was approximately twenty-three years old. She explained\n\nthat he was violent. Appellant knocked her unconscious around the time she\n\nreturned home from the hospital after giving birth to their second son. After they\n\nbroke up, appellant showed up at her home late one night in 2004. He was nervous\n\nand told M.S. that law enforcement officers were looking for him. Appellant asked\n\nto stay with her, but she refused. Two years later, he admitted to M.S. during a\n\ntelephone call that he had killed the complainant.\n\n      The trial court admitted into evidence a stipulation in which appellant stated\n\nthat he had been previously convicted of six additional felonies: three in Texas and\n\nthree in Florida. The trial court also admitted into evidence a statement made by\n\nappellant to law enforcement officers at the time of his arrest. In that statement, he\n\nadmitted to having killed the complainant.\n\n                                 Plea Admonitions\n\n      In his first issue, appellant argues that the trial court erred in not\n\nadmonishing him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea. Although\n\nthe State concedes that the trial court so erred, it asserts that the error was\n\nharmless.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f       To ensure that trial courts enter and accept only constitutionally valid pleas\n\nand to assist trial courts in making the determination that a defendant\u2019s\n\nrelinquishment of rights is made knowingly and voluntarily, Texas law requires\n\nthat trial courts make certain admonishments to defendants before accepting a plea\n\nof guilty. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 26.13(a) (Vernon Supp. 2017). And a\n\ntrial court is explicitly required to admonish the defendant of, among other things,\n\nthe fact \u201cthat if [he] is not a citizen of the United States of America, a plea of guilty\n\nor nolo contendere for the offense charged may result in deportation, the exclusion\n\nfrom admission to this country, or the denial of naturalization under federal law.\u201d\n\nId. art. 26.13(a)(4).\n\n       Here, the record demonstrates, and the State concedes, that the trial court did\n\nnot admonish appellant of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea.\n\nTherefore, the trial court committed error. See VanNortrick v. State, 227 S.W.3d\n\n706, 708 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).               However, because the error is non-\n\nconstitutional, if it did not affect appellant\u2019s substantial rights, we must hold it to\n\nbe harmless. See TEX. R. APP. P. 44.2(b).\n\n       In order to determine whether appellant\u2019s substantial rights were affected,\n\nwe must review the entire record. Anderson v. State, 182 S.W.3d 914, 918\u201319\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2006). There is no burden on either party to prove harm or\n\nharmlessness resulting from the error. VanNortrick, 227 S.W.3d at 709. While we\n\n\n                                           5\n\fmay draw reasonable inferences from the record, we may not use mere\n\nsupposition. Id. at 710\u201311. In order to determine whether the error was harmless,\n\nwe must decide whether we have fair assurance that appellant\u2019s decision to plead\n\nguilty would not have changed had the trial court properly admonished him of the\n\npotential immigration consequences of his guilty plea. Id. at 709. In conducting\n\nthis review, we focus on three issues: (1) whether appellant knew the consequences\n\nof his plea, (2) the strength of the evidence of his guilt, and (3) his citizenship and\n\nimmigration status. Id. at 712\u201313.\n\n      First, we consider whether appellant was aware of the deportation\n\nconsequences of his guilty plea.       VanNortrick, 227 S.W.3d at 712; see also\n\nGutierrez-Gomez v. State, 321 S.W.3d 679, 683\u201384 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2010, no pet.) (holding error in not admonishing defendant of immigration\n\nconsequences harmless where issue referenced five times during voir dire). In this\n\ncase, the record demonstrates that the trial court did not admonish appellant of any\n\ndeportation consequences of his guilty plea, and no one made any reference on the\n\nrecord to deportation or other potential immigration consequences that might result\n\nfrom his guilty plea. \u201c[W]hen the record is silent regarding the consequences of\n\nconviction in the context of a guilty plea, we infer that the defendant did not know\n\nthe consequences of his plea.\u201d VanNortrick, 227 S.W.3d at 710\u201311.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f      The State argues that appellant must have been aware of the immigration\n\nconsequences of his guilty plea because he would have presumably been\n\nadmonished when pleading guilty in any one of his six prior felony cases in Texas\n\nand Florida.3 It further notes that a Texas \u201cpen packet\u201d for one of his prior\n\nconvictions states \u201cpossible DETN from USI for Immigration Violation.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is no evidence in the record that establishes that appellant actually\n\nreceived an admonishment in any of those cases or was otherwise made aware of\n\nthe immigration consequences of his plea. See VanNortrick, 227 S.W.3d at 711\n\n(holding \u201cpen packet documenting [defendant]\u2019s prior conviction qualifying as a\n\ndeportable felony conviction\u201d insufficient to support inference defendant non-\n\ncitizen). And we note that the records in the cases relied upon by the State in\n\nsupport of its position contain direct references to the immigration consequences of\n\npleading guilty, supporting the inference that those defendants had knowledge of\n\nthe consequences of their pleas. See Rodriguez v. State, 425 S.W.3d 655, 665\u201367\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (holding harmless error in not\n\nadmonishing defendant who had twice been previously deported after pleading\n\nguilty, admitted discussing consequences of plea with attorney, and discussed\n\nmarrying citizen with prior counsel to stay in country); Gutierrez-Gomez, 321\n\nS.W.3d at 683\u201384 (holding trial judge\u2019s statement, during voir dire, defendant\n\n\n3\n      The State asserts that, at the time, Florida law required a similar admonition.\n                                            7\n\flikely automatically deported if released on community supervision, along with\n\nreferences to deportation by defense counsel and prospective juror, supported\n\ninference defendant knew consequences of plea).         Conversely, in this case,\n\n\u201c[d]rawing any sort of reasonable inference from the record before us is no more\n\nthan mere supposition, which cannot support what the State suggests.\u201d\n\nVanNortrick, 227 S.W.3d at 711.\n\n      Next, we consider the strength of the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt. This\n\nevidence unquestionably favors the State.      Both N.H. and M.S. testified that\n\nappellant admitted to them that he had killed the complainant. N.M. also testified\n\nthat after the complainant\u2019s disappearance, appellant telephoned her and told her\n\nthat the complainant \u201cwas gone.\u201d Additionally, Tavey Mao testified that he saw\n\nappellant threaten the complainant with a firearm around the time of his\n\ndisappearance.\n\n      However, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has made it clear that where\n\nwe cannot infer that appellant knew about the immigration consequences of his\n\nplea, \u201cthe strength or weakness of the evidence against [him] makes little\n\ndifference to the harm analysis in the context of the whole record.\u201d Id. at 713.\n\nThis is because we cannot be certain that, even if the evidence of guilt against him\n\nis strong, appellant would necessarily have chosen to enter a guilty plea and accept\n\nconviction over taking his chances at trial knowing that is the only way he could\n\n\n                                         8\n\fhave attempted to avoid deportation or being forever denied the opportunity to\n\nbecome a naturalized citizen. Id.\n\n       Finally, it is undisputed in this case that appellant is not a United States\n\ncitizen.\n\n       Although the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt is strong, there is no evidence in\n\nthe record from which we can infer that he had knowledge of the immigration\n\nconsequences of his guilty plea. Thus, we cannot have fair assurance that his\n\ndecision to plead guilty would not have changed had the trial court admonished\n\nhim of the possible deportation consequences of his guilty plea. Accordingly, we\n\nhold that the trial court\u2019s error in not admonishing appellant of the immigration\n\nconsequences of his guilty plea was not harmless.\n\n       We sustain appellant\u2019s first issue. Because we sustain appellant\u2019s first issue,\n\nwe need not reach his second or third issues. We also need not address the State\u2019s\n\ncross-point requesting modification of the judgment for clerical errors.\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f                                    Conclusion\n\n      We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case to the trial\n\ncourt for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                Terry Jennings\n                                                Justice\n\nPanel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Jennings and Lloyd.\n\nDo not publish.
