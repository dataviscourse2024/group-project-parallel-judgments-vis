Memorandum: We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the jury\u2019s verdict convicting him of murder in the second degree (see, Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [1]) was against the weight of the evidence (see, People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490). From the conflicting evidence presented, the jury reasonably concluded that defendant was not acting under extreme emotional disturbance when he viciously attacked the decedent.\nWe have considered the other issues raised by defendant and find them lacking in merit. (Appeal from Judgment of Supreme Court, Monroe County, Doyle, J. \u2014 Murder, 2nd Degree.) Present \u2014 Denman, P. J., Boomer, Balio, Lawton and Fallon, JJ.\n",
