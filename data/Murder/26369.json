No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.\n\n       We begin with some background information pertinent to our review in this\n\nappeal. In 2001, Alfred was convicted of second-degree murder and was\n\nsentenced to life imprisonment. His state conviction and sentence were affirmed\n\non direct appeal. See Alfred v. State, 820 So. 2d 1084 (Fla. 3d Dist. Ct. App.\n\n2002); Alfred v. State, 935 So. 2d 72 (Fla. 3d Dist. Ct. App. 2006).\n\n       In 2007, Alfred filed his first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for habeas corpus,\n\nwhich the district court denied on the merits. This Court then denied Alfred a\n\ncertificate of appealability. Alfred later filed other section 2254 petitions, which\n\nwere dismissed as successive.\n\n       Between 2015 and 2017, Alfred also filed four petitions for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus with the Florida Supreme Court, each of which was dismissed as\n\nunauthorized, pursuant to the procedure announced by the Florida Supreme Court\n\nin Baker v. State, 878 So. 2d 1236 (Fla. 2004).1 See Alfred v. Jones, 163 So. 3d 507\n\n\n1\n In Baker, the Florida Supreme Court explained that non-capital state prisoners seeking\ncollateral postconviction relief must do so by filing (in the sentencing court) a motion, pursuant\n                                                  2\n\f                 Case: 17-13580      Date Filed: 11/27/2018       Page: 3 of 6\n\n\n(Fla. 2015) (table); Alfred v. Jones, No. SC16-908 (Fla. July 13, 2016); Alfred v.\n\nJones, No. SC16-1427 (Fla. Sept. 29, 2016); Alfred v. Jones, No. SC17-1566 (Fla.\n\nNov. 14, 2017).\n\n          Meanwhile -- in December 2016 -- Alfred filed the pro se \u201cPetition for\n\nDeclaratory Judgment\u201d at issue in this appeal. In his petition, Alfred challenged\n\nthe constitutionality of the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Baker. Alfred\n\nargued that the Florida Supreme Court amended impermissibly the Florida\n\nConstitution by announcing a new procedure for disposing of improperly filed state\n\nhabeas petitions. As relief, Alfred sought a declaration that the Florida Supreme\n\nCourt violated the Florida and United States Constitutions by denying non-capital\n\nprisoners a fundamental right guaranteed by the Florida Constitution. Alfred also\n\nsought to enjoin the Florida Supreme Court from applying the procedure\n\nannounced in Baker. Attached to Alfred\u2019s petition was the Florida Supreme\n\nCourt\u2019s 2016 order dismissing -- pursuant to Baker -- Alfred\u2019s petition for habeas\n\nrelief.\n\n\n\n\nto Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 -- not a petition for habeas corpus with the Florida Supreme Court. 878\nSo. 2d at 1245. The Florida Supreme Court also announced a new procedure by which the Court\nwould dismiss as unauthorized -- instead of denying -- improperly filed habeas petitions that\nwere clearly procedurally barred or without merit. Id. at 1245-46.\n                                                   3\n\f                 Case: 17-13580        Date Filed: 11/27/2018        Page: 4 of 6\n\n\n       The district court construed Alfred\u2019s petition as a section 2254 petition for\n\nhabeas corpus and ultimately dismissed sua sponte Alfred\u2019s petition.2 The district\n\ncourt noted that, to the extent Alfred sought section 2254 habeas relief, his petition\n\nwould be subject to dismissal as successively filed and because Alfred raised no\n\nchallenge to the fact or duration of his confinement. The district court also\n\ndetermined that Alfred\u2019s petition was subject to dismissal because Alfred\u2019s\n\nchallenge to the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Baker was not a claim that\n\ncould be raised properly in either a section 2254 or a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n\nproceeding. 3\n\n       Alfred filed a Fed. R. Civ. P 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment,\n\nwhich the district court denied. In pertinent part, the district court said that\n\nAlfred\u2019s petition was subject to dismissal because federal district courts lack\n\nauthority to invalidate state court decisions concerning matters of state law.\n\n       We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s dismissal of a claim for\n\ndeclaratory judgment. Smith v. Casey, 741 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir. 2014). We\n\nalso review a denial of a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a judgment under an\n\n\n2\n To the extent the district court erred in construing Alfred\u2019s petition as one for habeas relief\nunder section 2254, that error was harmless because Alfred\u2019s petition -- however construed --\nwas still subject to dismissal for the reasons explained in this opinion.\n\n3\n  Although the district court noted that Alfred had failed to pay the filing fee or move for leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis, that observation was no ground for the district court\u2019s dismissal.\n                                                 4\n\f                Case: 17-13580      Date Filed: 11/27/2018     Page: 5 of 6\n\n\nabuse-of-discretion standard. Case v. Eslinger, 555 F.3d 1317, 1325 (11th Cir.\n\n2009). We construe liberally pro se pleadings. Tannenbaum v. United States, 148\n\nF.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir. 1998).\n\n       The district court determined correctly that Alfred\u2019s petition was subject to\n\ndismissal. Under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, 4 federal district courts lack\n\njurisdiction to review final judgments of state courts. Casale v. Tillman, 558 F.3d\n\n1258, 1260 (11th Cir. 2009) (explaining that the doctrine applies to federal claims\n\npreviously raised and ruled on by a state court and to those claims \u201cinextricably\n\nintertwined\u201d with a state court\u2019s judgment). Rooker-Feldman bars lower federal-\n\ncourt jurisdiction in \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries\n\ncaused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings\n\ncommenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d\n\nId. at 1261 (citation omitted).\n\n       Before Alfred filed the petition at issue in this appeal, the Florida Supreme\n\nCourt dismissed as unauthorized -- pursuant to Baker -- three habeas petitions filed\n\nby Alfred. Although Alfred raises no direct challenge to these dismissals in this\n\nproceeding, those state court judgments are intertwined with the injury complained\n\nof in Alfred\u2019s petition: that the Florida Supreme Court unlawfully deprived him of\n\n4\n D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983); Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., 263 U.S.\n413 (1923).\n                                             5\n\f              Case: 17-13580     Date Filed: 11/27/2018    Page: 6 of 6\n\n\nhis constitutionally-protected right to seek habeas relief. In other words, by\n\nchallenging the validity of the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Baker, Alfred\n\nsought -- in effect -- a declaration that the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s dismissals of\n\nhis petitions for habeas corpus were unlawful. Alfred\u2019s claim was, thus, barred by\n\nRooker-Feldman.\n\n      Because the district court lacked jurisdiction over Alfred\u2019s claim, his petition\n\nwas subject to dismissal. Moreover, because amendment would have been futile,\n\nthe district court committed no error in dismissing Alfred\u2019s petition without first\n\ngiving him an opportunity to amend. See Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 367 F.3d\n\n1255, 1262 (11th Cir. 2004).\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f",
