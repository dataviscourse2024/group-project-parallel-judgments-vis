Koenig, Assistant Federal Public Defender,\nOFFICE OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER, Alexandria, Virginia, for Appellant.\nG. Zachary Terwilliger, United States Attorney, Daniel T. Young, Assistant United States\nAttorney, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, Alexandria, Virginia, for\nAppellee.\n\fDIANA GRIBBON MOTZ, Circuit Judge:\n\n       In this successive federal habeas petition, Justin Eugene Taylor, convicted of using\n\na firearm in furtherance of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), asks\n\nus to vacate this conviction and remand for resentencing. He contends that this conviction\n\nwas predicated on two offenses \u2014 conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery and attempted\n\nHobbs Act robbery \u2014 that do not constitute \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under \u00a7 924(c). The\n\nparties agree that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery no longer qualifies as a valid\n\n\u00a7 924(c) predicate. The Government contends, however, that attempted Hobbs Act robbery\n\ndoes constitute a crime of violence and so is a valid predicate. The district court so held.\n\nTaylor petitioned for a certificate of appealability, which we granted. Because the elements\n\nof attempted Hobbs Act robbery do not invariably require \u201cthe use, attempted use, or\n\nthreatened use of physical force,\u201d the offense does not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d\n\nunder \u00a7 924(c).1 Accordingly, we vacate Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction and remand for\n\nresentencing consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Relying on United States v. Vann, 660 F.3d 771 (4th Cir. 2011) (en banc) and\nUnited States v. Chapman, 666 F.3d 220 (4th Cir. 2012), Taylor also contends that because\nhis \u00a7 924(c) conviction rested on at least one invalid predicate, there is grave ambiguity as\nto which predicate constituted the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d necessary to sustain his conviction.\nSee also United States v. Quicksey, 525 F.2d 337 (4th Cir. 1975). We also granted a\ncertificate of appealability as to this question. But given our holding that here neither\npredicate constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 924(c), we cannot reach that question\nin this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f                                            I.\n\n      This case arises from a 2003 conspiracy to rob a drug dealer. Taylor arranged a\n\ntransaction to sell marijuana to Martin Sylvester, who in turn planned to sell marijuana to\n\nothers. But Taylor had an ulterior plan: rather than complete the proposed transaction,\n\nTaylor and a coconspirator (whose name does not appear in the record) would steal\n\nSylvester\u2019s money.\n\n      After meeting at a mutual acquaintance\u2019s residence, Taylor and Sylvester traveled\n\ntogether to Richmond, Virginia.     Upon their arrival in Richmond, Taylor instructed\n\nSylvester to meet Taylor\u2019s coconspirator in a nearby alleyway to complete the transaction.\n\nSylvester did so, but Taylor\u2019s plan quickly went off the rails. The coconspirator, who was\n\narmed with a semiautomatic pistol, demanded Sylvester\u2019s money. Sylvester refused and\n\nresisted. The pistol discharged and Sylvester sustained a fatal gunshot wound.\n\n      The Government charged Taylor in a seven-count indictment. In relevant part, the\n\nindictment alleges Taylor conspired to commit Hobbs Act robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 1951, attempted Hobbs Act robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, and used a firearm\n\nin furtherance of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The indictment\n\nfurther alleges two predicate crimes of violence: the conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act\n\nrobbery and the attempted Hobbs Act robbery. Taylor pled guilty to conspiracy to commit\n\nHobbs Act robbery and use of a firearm in furtherance of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The\n\nGovernment agreed to dismiss the remaining charges. The district court sentenced Taylor\n\nto 240 months\u2019 incarceration for the conspiracy conviction and 120 consecutive months for\n\nthe \u00a7 924(c) conviction, yielding a total sentence of 360 months.\n\n\n                                            3\n\f       Taylor appealed, but his appeal was dismissed based on a waiver in his plea\n\nagreement. In 2015, the district court denied Taylor\u2019s first motion to vacate his sentence\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In 2016, we granted Taylor permission to file a second \u00a7 2255\n\nmotion in light of Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), which substantially\n\nnarrowed the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n\nand Welch v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 1257 (2016), which held that Johnson applied\n\nretroactively to cases on collateral review.2\n\n       In this second \u00a7 2255 motion, Taylor contends that, after Johnson, attempted Hobbs\n\nAct robbery and conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery no longer qualify as crimes of\n\nviolence under \u00a7 924(c)(3) and so his conviction for use of a firearm in furtherance of a\n\n\u201ccrime of violence\u201d must be vacated. During the pendency of that motion, we invalidated\n\n\u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), one of the statute\u2019s two clauses defining \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and further\n\nheld that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery does not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d\n\nunder either clause. United States v. Simms, 914 F.3d 229, 233\u201334, 236 (4th Cir. 2019) (en\n\nbanc). Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court similarly invalidated \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) as\n\nunconstitutionally vague. United States v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2336 (2019).\n\n       Notwithstanding these shifts in the legal landscape, the district court denied Taylor\u2019s\n\nsecond \u00a7 2255 motion. The court held that attempted Hobbs Act robbery continued to\n\nqualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) and that Taylor\u2019s conviction for use\n\n\n       2\n         Because the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) is almost identical\nto the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d in ACCA our \u201cdecisions interpreting one [] definition\nare persuasive as to the meaning of the other[].\u201d United States v. McNeal, 818 F.3d 141,\n153 n.9 (4th Cir. 2016).\n\n                                                4\n\fof a firearm in furtherance of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d remained valid because it was\n\npredicated on attempted Hobbs Act robbery. Taylor noted this appeal, and we granted a\n\ncertificate of appealability. For the reasons that follow, we now vacate Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 924(c)\n\nconviction and remand for resentencing.\n\n\n\n                                            II.\n\n      Under federal law, a person who uses or carries a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to\n\nany crime of violence\u201d or who \u201cpossesses a firearm\u201d \u201cin furtherance of any such crime\u201d\n\nmay be convicted of both the underlying \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and the additional crime of\n\nutilizing a firearm in connection with a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).\n\n      Section 924(c)(3) defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201can offense that is a felony\u201d and:\n\n      (A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\n      force against the person or property of another, or\n\n      (B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against\n      the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing\n      the offense.\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3). Courts typically refer to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) as the \u201cforce clause\u201d and \u00a7\n\n924(c)(3)(B) as the \u201cresidual clause.\u201d In view of the Supreme Court\u2019s invalidation of the\n\nresidual clause as unconstitutionally vague, Davis, 139 S. Ct. at 2336, Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 924(c)\n\nconviction may stand only if attempted Hobbs Act robbery constitutes a \u201ccrime of\n\nviolence\u201d under the force clause.\n\n      To determine whether an offense constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the force\n\nclause, courts must employ the \u201ccategorical\u201d approach. Descamps v. United States, 570\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fU.S. 254, 258 (2013); United States v. Dinkins, 928 F.3d 349, 354 (4th Cir. 2019). Pursuant\n\nto the categorical approach, a court \u201cfocuses on the elements of the prior offense rather than\n\nthe conduct underlying the conviction.\u201d United States v. Cabrera-Umanzor, 728 F.3d 347,\n\n350 (4th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted) (emphasis in original); see also Simms, 914 F.3d at\n\n233 (observing that, under the categorical approach, our analysis \u201cbegins and ends with the\n\noffense\u2019s elements\u201d). We must ask whether the elements of the underlying offense\n\nnecessarily require \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\u201d McNeal,\n\n818 F.3d at 151\u201352 (quoting \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)). When the elements of an offense encompass\n\nboth violent and nonviolent means of commission \u2014 that is, when the offense may be\n\ncommitted without the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force \u2014 the offense\n\nis not \u201ccategorically\u201d a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d\n\n       To obtain a conviction for attempted Hobbs Act robbery, the Government must\n\nprove two elements: (1) the defendant had the culpable intent to commit Hobbs Act\n\nrobbery; and (2) the defendant took a substantial step toward the completion of Hobbs Act\n\nrobbery that strongly corroborates the intent to commit the offense. See United States v.\n\nEngle, 676 F.3d 405, 419\u201320 (4th Cir. 2012).\n\n       As to the first element, the Hobbs Act penalizes a person who \u201cin any way or degree\n\nobstructs, delays, or affects commerce . . . by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires\n\nso to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance\n\nof a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). The\n\nHobbs Act defines \u201crobbery\u201d as the \u201cunlawful taking or obtaining of personal property\n\nfrom the person or in the presence of another, against his will, by means of actual or\n\n\n                                             6\n\fthreatened force, or violence, or fear of injury, immediate or future.\u201d           18 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n1951(b)(1).\n\n       With respect to the second element, a \u201csubstantial step\u201d is a \u201cdirect act in a course\n\nof conduct planned to culminate in commission of a crime that is strongly corroborative of\n\nthe defendant\u2019s criminal purpose.\u201d United States v. Dozier, 848 F.3d 180, 186 (4th Cir.\n\n2017) (quoting Engle, 676 F.3d at 423). \u201cThis definition is consistent with the definition\n\nof attempt found in the Model Penal Code,\u201d which includes some nonviolent acts. United\n\nStates v. Neal, 78 F.3d 901, 906 (4th Cir. 1996); see also Model Penal Code \u00a7 5.01(1)(c)\n\n(enumerating examples of conduct that constitute a substantial step, like \u201cpossession of\n\nmaterials to be employed in the commission of the crime\u201d). While \u201c[m]ere preparation . . .\n\ndoes not constitute an attempt to commit a crime,\u201d a \u201cdirect, substantial act toward the\n\ncommission of a crime need not be the last possible act before its commission.\u201d United\n\nStates v. Pratt, 351 F.3d 131, 136 (4th Cir. 2003) (noting that \u201ca specific discussion\u201d may\n\nconstitute a \u201csubstantial step\u201d where it is \u201cso final in nature that it left little doubt that a\n\ncrime was intended and would be committed\u201d).\n\n       Our application of the categorical approach to attempted Hobbs Act robbery is\n\ninformed by our recent decision in United States v. Mathis, 932 F.3d 242 (4th Cir. 2019).\n\nIn Mathis, we held that substantive Hobbs Act robbery \u201ccategorically\u201d qualifies as a \u201ccrime\n\nof violence\u201d under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) because although it may be committed simply by causing\n\n\u201cfear of injury,\u201d doing so \u201cnecessarily \u2018involves the threat to use [physical] force.\u2019\u201d Id. at\n\n266 (quoting McNeal, 818 F.3d at 153). In other words, because the commission of Hobbs\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fAct robbery requires, at a minimum, the \u201cthreatened use of physical force,\u201d it categorically\n\nqualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s force clause.\n\n       However, a straightforward application of the categorical approach to attempted\n\nHobbs Act robbery yields a different result. This is so because, unlike substantive Hobbs\n\nAct robbery, attempted Hobbs Act robbery does not invariably require the use, attempted\n\nuse, or threatened use of physical force. The Government may obtain a conviction for\n\nattempted Hobbs Act robbery by proving that: (1) the defendant specifically intended to\n\ncommit robbery by means of a threat to use physical force; and (2) the defendant took a\n\nsubstantial step corroborating that intent. The substantial step need not be violent. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. McFadden, 739 F.2d 149, 152 (4th Cir. 1984) (concluding that\n\ndefendants took a substantial step toward bank robbery where they \u201cdiscussed their plans,\u201d\n\n\u201creconnoitered the banks in question,\u201d \u201cassembled [] weapons and disguises,\u201d and\n\n\u201cproceeded to the area of the bank\u201d). Where a defendant takes a nonviolent substantial\n\nstep toward threatening to use physical force \u2014 conduct that undoubtedly satisfies the\n\nelements of attempted Hobbs Act robbery \u2014 the defendant has not used, attempted to use,\n\nor threatened to use physical force. Rather, the defendant has merely attempted to threaten\n\nto use physical force. The plain text of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) does not cover such conduct.\n\n       Three of our sister circuits have eschewed this conclusion, instead holding that\n\nattempted Hobbs Act robbery does qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d See United States v.\n\nDominguez, 954 F.3d 1251, 1255 (9th Cir. 2020); United States v. Ingram, 947 F.3d 1021,\n\n1026 (7th Cir. 2020); United States v. St. Hubert, 909 F.3d 335, 351\u201353 (11th Cir. 2018).\n\nRather than apply the categorical approach \u2014 as directed by the Supreme Court \u2014 they\n\n\n                                            8\n\f instead rest their conclusion on a rule of their own creation. Specifically, they hold that\n\n \u201c[w]hen a substantive offense would be a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e) and similar statutes,\n\n an attempt to commit that offense also is a violent felony.\u201d St. Hubert, 909 F.3d at 351\n\n (quoting Hill v. United States, 877 F.3d 717, 719 (7th Cir. 2017)); Ingram, 947 F.3d at\n\n 1026 (same); Dominguez, 954 F.3d at 1261 (same). In doing so, those courts adopt the\n\n same flawed premise that the Government recites here: that an attempt to commit a \u201ccrime\n\n of violence\u201d necessarily constitutes an attempt to use physical force. See, e.g., St. Hubert,\n\n 909 F.3d at 351 (asserting that an attempt to commit a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d \u201cmust [] include\n\n at least the \u2018attempted use\u2019 of force\u201d); Gov\u2019t Br. at 12 (arguing that \u201can attempt to commit\n\n a substantive crime of violence is an \u2018attempted use . . . of physical force\u2019\u201d).\n\n       This simply is not so. Rather, as we have repeatedly held, certain crimes of violence\n\n\u2014 like Hobbs Act robbery, federal bank robbery, and carjacking \u2014 may be committed\n\nwithout the use or attempted use of physical force because they may be committed merely\n\nby means of threats. See Mathis, 932 F.3d at 266 (holding that \u201cHobbs Act robbery, when\n\ncommitted by means of causing fear of injury, qualifies as a crime of violence\u201d) (emphasis\n\nadded); McNeal, 818 F.3d at 153 (holding that \u201c[b]ank robbery under [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7\n\n2113(a), \u2018by intimidation,\u2019 requires the threatened use of physical force\u201d and thus\n\n\u201cconstitutes a crime of violence\u201d) (emphasis added); United States v. Evans, 848 F.3d 242,\n\n247 (4th Cir. 2017) (holding \u201cthat the term \u2018intimidation,\u2019 as used in the phrase \u2018by force\n\nand violence or by intimidation\u2019 in the carjacking statute, necessarily includes a threat of\n\nviolent force within the meaning of the \u2018force clause\u2019\u201d) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       These cases establish that, contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, an attempt to\n\ncommit a crime of violence need not involve the attempted use of physical force. Some\n\ncrimes of violence can be accomplished merely though the threatened use of force. The\n\ncrime at issue here \u2014 attempted Hobbs Act robbery \u2014 is just such a crime. But an attempt\n\nto threaten force does not constitute an attempt to use force. A person who attempts to\n\ncommit Hobbs Act robbery by passing a threatening note to a store cashier has attempted\n\nthe planned robbery without using or attempting to use physical force. He may case the\n\nstore that he intends to rob, discuss plans with a coconspirator, and buy weapons to\n\ncomplete the job. But none of this conduct involves an attempt to use physical force, nor\n\ndoes it involve the use of physical force or the threatened use of physical force. In these\n\ncircumstances, the defendant has merely taken nonviolent substantial steps toward\n\nthreatening to use physical force. The plain text of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) does not embrace such\n\nactivity.\n\n       Resisting this conclusion, the Government protests that application of the\n\ncategorical approach here would, by extension, \u201cleave[] all federal attempt crimes,\u201d even\n\nattempted murder, \u201coutside \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. at 18 (emphasis in original). Not\n\nso. To be sure, where a crime of violence may be committed without the use or attempted\n\nuse of physical force, an attempt to commit that crime falls outside the purview of the force\n\nclause. But where a crime of violence requires the use of physical force \u2014 as is usually\n\nthe case \u2014 the categorical approach produces the opposite outcome: because the\n\nsubstantive crime of violence invariably involves the use of force, the corresponding\n\nattempt to commit that crime necessarily involves the attempted use of force. Such an\n\n\n                                             10\n\fattempt constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of the force clause in \u00a7\n\n924(c)(3). See, e.g., Mathis, 932 F.3d at 265 (explaining that \u201c[m]urder requires the use\n\nof force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person\u201d and so \u201cqualifies\n\ncategorically as a crime of violence under the force clause\u201d) (quotation marks omitted)\n\n(emphasis added); In re Irby, 858 F.3d 231, 236 (4th Cir. 2017) (holding that \u201csecond-\n\ndegree retaliatory murder is a crime of violence under the force clause because unlawfully\n\nkilling another human being requires the use of force\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, the\n\nGovernment\u2019s dire warning rests on a misunderstanding of the consequences of adhering\n\nto the categorical approach in this case.3\n\n       Accordingly, we hold that attempted Hobbs Act robbery is not \u201ccategorically\u201d a\n\n\u201ccrime of violence.\u201d We must vacate Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction predicated on attempted\n\nHobbs Act robbery and conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery \u2014 two offenses that are\n\nnot crimes of violence.\n\n\n       3\n         In a post-argument letter, the Government contends that Stokeling v. United States,\n139 S. Ct. 544 (2019), supports its view that attempted Hobbs Act robbery constitutes a\ncrime of violence. Stokeling is of no aid to the Government because Stokeling considered\nonly whether common law robbery constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d; it held it did because\ncommon law robbery \u201crequire[s] the criminal to overcome the victim\u2019s resistance.\u201d Id. at\n550. But of course, the crime at issue here, Hobbs Act robbery, contains no similar\nrequirement. Rather, Hobbs Act robbery criminalizes the \u201cunlawful taking or obtaining of\npersonal property . . . by means of actual or threatened force.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(1)\n(emphasis added). Compare Stokeling, 139 S. Ct. at 550 (noting that \u201cat common law, an\nunlawful taking was merely larceny unless the crime involved \u2018violence,\u2019\u201d defined as\n\u201csufficient force [] exerted to overcome the resistance encountered\u201d). Thus, as we held in\nMathis, Hobbs Act robbery does not require an offender to overcome the victim\u2019s\nresistance; instead, this federal statutory crime, unlike common law robbery, may be\ncommitted solely by causing fear of injury \u2014 that is, by conveying a threat \u2014 and a threat\ndoes not itself constitute \u201cforce [] exerted to overcome the resistance encountered.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f                                           III.\n\n      For these reasons, we reverse the district court, vacate Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction,\n\nand remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                                            VACATED AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\f",
