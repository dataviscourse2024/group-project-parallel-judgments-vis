As noted\n\nabove, on October 28, 2011, Tucker entered a negotiated guilty plea to\n\ncharges of third-degree murder and possessing an instrument of crime for\n\nthe September 29, 2010, shooting death of Carmen Duran. In exchange for\n\nthe plea, the Commonwealth agreed to nolle pros the remaining charges of\n\nfirst-degree murder, firearms not to be carried without a license, and\n\ncarrying a firearm on a public street in Philadelphia,3 as well as recommend\n\na sentence of 17\u00bd to 35 years\u2019 imprisonment.            The case proceeded\n\nimmediately to sentencing, and the trial court imposed the sentence\n\nprovided for in the plea agreement. No post-sentence motion or direct\n\nappeal was filed.\n\n        On September 17, 2013, Tucker filed a pro se PCRA petition, alleging\n\nthe ineffective assistance of plea counsel and requesting the reinstatement\n\nof his direct appeal rights. He filed a pro se, amended petition on July 11,\n\n2014. Thereafter, PCRA counsel was appointed. However, on September 3,\n\n2015, counsel filed a Turner/Finley4 \u201cno merit\u201d letter, stating Tucker\u2019s\n\npetition was untimely filed, and requesting permission to withdraw.        On\n\nSeptember 22, 2015, the PCRA court sent Tucker notice of its intent to\n\ndismiss his petition as untimely filed. Although Tucker sought an extension\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3\n    18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2502, 6106, and 6108, respectively.\n4\n  Commonwealth v. Turner, 544 A.2d 927 (Pa. 1988), and\nCommonwealth v. Finley, 550 A.2d 213 (Pa.

Ultimately, on November 6, 2015, the PCRA court entered an order\n\ndismissing Tucker\u2019s petition as untimely, and permitting appointed counsel\n\nto withdraw. This appeal followed.5, 6\n\n       Our review of an order denying PCRA relief is well-established:    \u201cIn\n\nreviewing the denial of PCRA relief, we examine whether the PCRA court\u2019s\n\ndetermination is supported by the record and free of legal error.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Mitchell, 141 A.3d 1277, 1283\u20131284 (Pa. 2016)\n\n(internal punctuation and citation omitted).     Further, a PCRA court may\n\ndismiss a petition \u201cwithout an evidentiary hearing if there are no genuine\n\nissues of material fact and the petitioner is not entitled to relief.\u201d    Id.\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n5\n  We note Tucker\u2019s notice of appeal, filed on December 11, 2015, is facially\nuntimely. See Pa.R.A.P. 903 (notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days\nafter entry of order on appeal).        Nevertheless, Pennsylvania Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 108 provides the date of the entry of an appealable\norder \u201cshall be the day the clerk of the court \u2026 mails or delivers copies of\nthe order to the parties.\u201d Pa.R.A.P. 108(a)(1). Here, neither the order itself\nnor the docket entry for November 6, 2015, reflects the date the order\ndismissing the PCRA petition was sent to Tucker.           See Pa.R.Crim.P.\n114(B)(1) (requiring copies of order be \u201cpromptly\u201d served on \u201ceach party\u2019s\nattorney, or the party if unrepresented\u201d); (C)(2) (requiring clerk of court to\nenter on the docket the date of service of an order). Accordingly, we will\npresume the appeal was timely filed.\n6\n  The PCRA court did not order Tucker to file a concise statement of errors\ncomplained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b).\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S70020-16\n\n\n\n       Here, the PCRA court dismissed Tucker\u2019s petition after concluding it\n\nwas untimely filed. See PCRA Court Opinion, 1/5/2016, at 4-5. The PCRA\u2019s\n\ntime limitations are jurisdictional in nature, and neither a trial court nor an\n\nappeals court may ignore the untimeliness of a petition to address the\n\nsubstantive claims raised therein. See Mitchell, supra, 141 A.3d at 1284.\n\n       Pursuant to Section 9545(b)(1), a PCRA petition must be filed within\n\none year of the date the judgment of sentence becomes final.            See 42\n\nPa.C.S. 9545(b)(1). Tucker\u2019s judgment of sentence was final on November\n\n28, 2011, 30 days after the sentence was imposed, and Tucker failed to file\n\na direct appeal.7        See id. at \u00a7 9545(b)(3).       Therefore, he had until\n\nNovember 28, 2012, to file a timely petition, and the one before us, filed ten\n\nmonths later, is facially untimely.\n\n       However, the PCRA provides that an otherwise untimely petition is not\n\ntime-barred if a petitioner pleads and proves the applicability of one of three\n\ntime-for-filing exceptions:        (1) interference by government officials, (2)\n\nnewly discovered evidence, or (3) a newly-recognized constitutional right\n\nwhich had been applied retroactively. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii).\n\nAny petition invoking one of these exceptions must be filed \u201cwithin 60 days\n\nof the date the claim could have been presented.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 9545(b)(2).\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n7\n Because the 30th day, November 27, 2011, fell on a Sunday, Tucker had\nuntil Monday, November 28, 2011, to file a timely notice of appeal. See 1\nPa.C.S. \u00a7 1908.\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fJ-S70020-16\n\n\n\n      In his brief, Tucker provides two explanations for his untimely filing.\n\nFirst, he claims that in \u201cSeptember or October of 2012,\u201d he filed a motion for\n\nextension of time to file a PCRA petition with the trial court, but the motion\n\nwas never docketed.     Tucker\u2019s Brief at 5.   See also PCRA Court Opinion,\n\n1/5/2015, at 2 n.1.   Since this filing would have been within the requisite\n\none-year time period, Tucker suggests his petition should be consider timely\n\nfiled. See Tucker\u2019s Brief at 5.\n\n      Preliminarily, we note Tucker did not include this claim in his initial or\n\namended PCRA petitions, or in response to the PCRA court\u2019s notice of intent\n\nto dismiss the petition as untimely. Because it was never presented to the\n\nPCRA court, this argument is now waived on appeal. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a);\n\nCommonwealth v. Wharton, 811 A.2d 978, 987 (Pa. 2002) (holding PCRA\n\n\u201cclaims cannot be raised for the first time on appeal to this Court\u201d).\n\n      Moreover, our review reveals his purported attempt to file a timely\n\npetition - or rather, his attempt to extend the time to file a timely petition -\n\nis neither included in the certified record nor listed on the docket. \u201cAs an\n\nappellate court, we are \u2018limited to considering only those facts that have\n\nbeen duly certified in the record on appeal.\u2019\u201d Commonwealth v. Spotz, 18\n\nA.3d 244, 323 (Pa. 2011), quoting Commonwealth v. Williams, 715 A.2d\n\n1101, 1103 (Pa. 1998). Accordingly, for our purposes, Tucker\u2019s first post-\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJ-S70020-16\n\n\n\nsentence filing was his September 2013 PCRA petition.       His alleged extra-\n\nrecord attempt to preserve his rights does not provide a basis for relief.8\n\n       Second, Tucker contends he made \u201csufficient allegations\u201d to invoke the\n\nnewly-discovered evidence exception set forth at Subsection 9545(b)(1)(ii).\n\nTucker\u2019s Brief at 8.         Specifically, he maintains plea counsel provided\n\nineffective assistance by failing to move to withdraw his plea and/or file a\n\ndirect appeal. See id. at 8-9.\n\n       Again, we conclude this claim is waived because Tucker did not include\n\nit in his initial or amended PCRA petitions, or in response to the PCRA court\u2019s\n\nnotice of intent to dismiss the petition as untimely. See Commonwealth v.\n\nFurgess, ___ A.3d ___, ___, 2016 PA Super 219, *1 (Pa. Super. Sept. 28,\n\n2016) (\u201cAsserted exceptions to the time restrictions for the PCRA must be\n\nincluded in the petition, and may not be raised for the first time on\n\nappeal.\u201d). Moreover, even if this claim was not waived, we would conclude it\n\nis meritless.    Attached to PCRA counsel\u2019s \u201cno-merit\u201d letter is a letter from\n\nplea counsel to Tucker dated January 6, 2012.          In that letter, counsel\n\nexplained to Tucker why he did not file a post-sentence motion or an appeal\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n8\n  We recognize that, in its opinion, the PCRA court refers to pro se\ncorrespondence, purportedly sent to the \u201cClerk of Courts\u201d in September and\nOctober of 2012, in which Tucker requested \u201cdocket sheets to determine the\nstatus of his case \u2026 and extension of time to file a PCRA petition.\u201d PCRA\nCourt Opinion, 1/5/2016, at 2 n.1. However, the court, concluded, like this\npanel, that it could not \u201cconsider [the motions] as filings for PCRA purposes\u201d\nbecause they were never docketed. Id.\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fJ-S70020-16\n\n\n\non his behalf, and that the time for filing such requests had expired. See\n\n\u201cNo Merit\u201d Letter, 9/3/2015, at Exhibit A.    Therefore, Tucker knew well\n\nwithin the one-year filing period that counsel had failed to file a direct\n\nappeal.   However, he then waited an additional 20 months to file a PCRA\n\npetition. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(2) (stating any petition invoking timing\n\nexception must be filed within 60 days of the date the claim could have been\n\npresented). Consequently, no relief is warranted.\n\n     Order affirmed.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
