Mr. Darden\u2019s estate sued, alleging that the officers used excessive\nforce and that the City was liable for failing to adequately train the officers.\n\n\n       * Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH\nCIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\f    Case: 18-11624    Document: 00515394735    Page: 2   Date Filed: 04/24/2020\n\n\n\n                                No. 18-11624\nWith respect to the failure-to-train claim, the district court granted summary\njudgment in the City\u2019s favor. We affirm.\n                             I. BACKGROUND\n      On May 16, 2013, a large team of heavily armed police officers executed\na no-knock warrant on a private residence in Fort Worth, Texas. Darden v. City\nof Fort Worth, Tex., 880 F.3d 722, 725 (5th Cir. 2018). Officer W. F. Snow was\nassigned to the entry team, which was tasked with breaking down the front\ndoor, entering the residence, and securing the premises. Id. Officer Javier\nRomero drove the van that transported the team to the residence, but was also\nassigned to stand guard near the front door while other officers entered the\nresidence and arrested the people inside. Id. Two other members of the team\nwore cameras on their helmets, which captured on video some, but not all, of\nthe events that transpired as the warrant was executed. Id.\n      When the police first arrived at the house, the entry team broke down\nthe front door with a battering ram, yelled that they were police, and ordered\neveryone to get down. Id. A man, later identified as Jermaine Darden (\u201cMr.\nDarden\u201d), was kneeling on the seat of a couch near the door when the officers\nentered, and he immediately raised his hands in the air. Id. Mr. Darden\nweighed approximately 340 pounds. Id. As Officer Snow entered the residence,\nhe reached out and ripped the shirt off Mr. Darden\u2019s back, apparently in an\nattempt to get Mr. Darden from the couch to the ground. Id. The videos do not\nshow what happened during the twenty-five seconds that followed, and there\nis conflicting testimony about what transpired. Id. at 725\u201326. Officer Snow\ntwice used a Taser on Mr. Darden, who at one point appeared to push himself\nup on his hands. Id. at 726. Other people in the house repeatedly yelled, \u201cHe\u2019s\ngot asthma,\u201d and, \u201cHe can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Eyewitnesses also testified that Mr.\nDarden told the officers he could not breathe and that he pushed himself up on\n\n\n                                      2\n\f    Case: 18-11624     Document: 00515394735     Page: 3   Date Filed: 04/24/2020\n\n\n\n                                  No. 18-11624\nhis hands because he was trying to get into a position where he could breathe.\nId.; id. at 726 n.3.\n      As Officer Romero finished placing handcuffs on Mr. Darden, Mr.\nDarden\u2019s body went limp. Id. at 726. The officers then pulled Mr. Darden\u2019s\ndebilitated body up into a sitting position and left him there. Id. Mr. Darden\nappeared to be unconscious, and his head hung down on his chest. Id. It was\nsubsequently determined that Mr. Darden had suffered a heart attack and\ndied. Id.\n      The administrator of Mr. Darden\u2019s estate (\u201cPlaintiff-Appellant\u201d) brought\nsuit under Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming (1) that Officers Snow and Romero\nused excessive force in arresting Mr. Darden; (2) that the City of Fort Worth\n(\u201cthe City\u201d) was liable for failing to adequately train the officers; and (3) that\nvarious defendants were liable for state-law torts. Id. at 727. All of the\ndefendants filed motions for summary judgment, and the district court granted\nthose motions and dismissed the case. Darden, 880 F.3d at 727. The district\ncourt determined that the officers had not violated clearly established law and\nwere thus entitled to qualified immunity. Id. Because it held that the officers\nhad not violated Mr. Darden\u2019s constitutional rights, the district court also\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the City on the municipal liability\nclaims. Id.\n      The administrator of Mr. Darden\u2019s estate appealed to this court, which\nreversed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claims against Officers Snow and\nRomero. Id. at 734. The panel also vacated the dismissal of the claims against\nthe City, remanding the case for further proceedings. Id. On remand, the\n\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 18-11624       Document: 00515394735          Page: 4     Date Filed: 04/24/2020\n\n\n\n                                       No. 18-11624\ndistrict court again granted summary judgment in favor of the City on the\nestate\u2019s municipal liability claims. 1 This appeal followed.\n                            II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       \u201cWe review a summary judgment de novo, \u2018using the same standard as\nthat employed by the district court under Rule 56.\u2019\u201d Newman v. Guedry, 703\nF.3d 757, 761 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting Kerstetter v. Pac. Sci. Co., 210 F.3d 431,\n435 (5th Cir. 2000)). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows\nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n                                   III. DISCUSSION\n       Only one question is before this court: did the district court err in\ngranting the City summary judgment on Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s municipal\nliability claim? We conclude that it did not.\n       A municipality may be liable under Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (\u201cSection\n1983\u201d) if the municipality itself \u201c\u2018subjects\u2019 a person to a deprivation of rights or\n\u2018causes\u2019 a person \u2018to be subjected\u2019 to such deprivation.\u201d Connick v. Thompson,\n563 U.S. 51, 60 (2011) (quoting Monnell v. New York City Dep\u2019t Soc. Servs., 436\nU.S. 658, 692 (1978)). But local governments are only responsible for \u201ctheir\nown illegal acts.\u201d Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 479 (1986) (citing\nMonell, 436 U.S. at 665\u201383). \u201cIn limited circumstances, a local government\u2019s\ndecision not to train certain employees about their legal duty to avoid violating\ncitizens\u2019 rights may rise to the level of an official government policy\u201d for\npurposes of Section 1983. Connick, 563 U.S. at 61. However, \u201c[a] municipality\u2019s\n\n\n\n       1  The district court also found that the City was entitled to summary judgment on\nPlaintiff-Appellant\u2019s state law claims. Plaintiff-Appellant did not address those claims in his\nappellate briefing. They are therefore forfeited. See Cinel v. Connick, 15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th\nCir. 1994) (\u201cAn appellant abandons all issues not raised and argued in its initial brief on\nappeal.\u201d); Davis v. Maggio, 706 F.2d 568, 571 (5th Cir. 1983) (per curiam) (\u201cClaims not\npressed on appeal are deemed abandoned.\u201d)\n                                              4\n\f    Case: 18-11624     Document: 00515394735     Page: 5   Date Filed: 04/24/2020\n\n\n\n                                  No. 18-11624\nculpability for a deprivation of rights is at its most tenuous where a claim turns\non a failure to train.\u201d Id. (citing Okla. City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 822\u201323\n(1985)). When such a claim is made, \u201cthe focus must be on adequacy of the\ntraining program in relation to the tasks the particular officers must perform.\u201d\nSnyder v. Trepagnier, 142 F.3d 791, 798 (5th Cir. 1998) (quoting City of Canton,\nOhio v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 390 (1989)).\n      Here, Plaintiff-Appellant alleges that the City provided inadequate\ntraining regarding the proper use of no-knock warrants, Tasers, and excessive\nand deadly force. In order to succeed at this stage, the City must show that\nthere is no genuine dispute as to a material fact regarding (1) whether there\nwas an inadequacy in the City\u2019s training policy; (2) whether the City was\ndeliberately indifferent in its adoption of that policy; or (3) whether the\ninadequate training policy directly caused the constitutional violation\nallegedly suffered by Mr. Darden. See, e.g., Sanders-Burns v. City of Plano, 594\nF.3d 366, 381 (5th Cir. 2010); Zarnow v. City of Wichita Falls, 614 F.3d 161,\n170 (5th Cir. 2010).\n      Plaintiff-Appellant does not argue a pattern of similar constitutional\nviolations. Instead, it relies on the single-incident exception to that rule. As\nsuch, the City must show that there is no genuine dispute as to whether the\nconstitutional violation allegedly suffered by Mr. Darden was the \u201chighly\npredictable\u201d consequence of the City\u2019s failure to train the officers in its Zero-\nTolerance Unit. See Valle v. City of Houston, 613 F.3d 536, 549 (5th Cir. 2010).\nIt has met that burden.\n      The City proffered, and the district court relied on, several \u201cGeneral\nOrders\u201d governing police practices that were in place on the day of Mr.\nDarden\u2019s death. Those orders largely restate applicable law regarding the use\nof force. While the existence of such policies is not dispositive, \u201c[w]e consider\n\n\n                                        5\n\f     Case: 18-11624        Document: 00515394735          Page: 6     Date Filed: 04/24/2020\n\n\n\n                                        No. 18-11624\ncompliance with state requirements as a factor counseling against a \u2018failure to\ntrain\u2019 finding.\u201d Zarnow, 614 F.3d at 171.\n       Plaintiff-Appellant seeks to evade the import of the City\u2019s existing\npolicies by emphasizing that its allegations are specific to the City\u2019s Zero-\nTolerance Unit, which specializes in serving search warrants and conducting\nsearches of residences, including \u201cdynamic entries\u201d and no-knock warrants.\nPlaintiff-Appellant offered evidence, in the form of an affidavit by Dallas\nIndependent School District Police Chief Craig Miller, 2 that \u201c[n]othing can\npotentially be more dangerous than making a Dynamic Entry into a location\u201d\nabout which officers have \u201cvery little information.\u201d The City, Plaintiff-\nAppellant emphasizes, offered no evidence that members of the Unit receive\ntraining on the use of excessive force and Tasers in the context of dynamic\nentries.\n       However, \u201ca plaintiff must allege with specificity how a particular\ntraining program is defective.\u201d Roberts v. City of Shreveport, 397 F.3d 287, 293\n(5th Cir. 2005). Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s general position is that the City failed to\nprovide any training specific to the use of excessive force and Tasers in the\ncontext of no-knock entries. But it has not identified\u2014in its briefing, at oral\nargument, or in post-argument supplemental briefing\u2014how such training\nwould differ from the existing training on using excessive force and Tasers. 3\nEven Chief Miller, in his affidavit, neglected to address this issue. Indeed, he\noffered the conclusory statement that \u201ca lack of adequate training [was] a\n\n\n\n       2   Prior to being employed by the Dallas Independent School District, Mr. Miller served\nas the Deputy Chief of the Crimes Against Persons Division of the Dallas Police Department.\nMr. Miller also served as the Homicide Unit Commander.\n         3 Plaintiff-Appellant emphasizes that the City \u201cwas supposed to provide the members\n\nof this unit with a \u2018briefing sheet\u2019 in order to \u2018make sure that all of the pertinent information\nis communicated to everybody that\u2019s involved,\u2019\u201d but that no such information was provided.\nThis argument is unhelpful to Plaintiff-Appellant, as it suggests that the City did have an\nofficial policy of providing briefing sheets before no-knock entries.\n                                               6\n\f     Case: 18-11624       Document: 00515394735          Page: 7     Date Filed: 04/24/2020\n\n\n\n                                       No. 18-11624\nsignificant part of the reason [the officers] utilized more force than the\nsituation required\u201d and opined that (1) \u201cthere were alternatives to conducting\na dynamic entry search warrant,\u201d (2) the Zero Tolerance Unit \u201cmade entry into\na location without proper intelligence and ultimately caused the death of\nJermaine Darden,\u201d and (3) \u201cnothing can potentially be more dangerous than\nmaking a dynamic entry into a location where, according to the briefing sheet,\nthey had very little information.\u201d\n       Given this gap in Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s allegations and summary\njudgment evidence, we conclude that the City is entitled to summary judgment.\nIt has shown that\u2014in this case, given the evidence now before the court\u2014there\nis no genuine dispute as to a material fact regarding whether there was an\ninadequacy in the City\u2019s training policy. 4\n                                   IV. CONCLUSION\n       The district court order granting summary judgment in favor of the\nCity on Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s municipal liability claims is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       4 The parties dispute whether Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s failure-to-train claim includes not\njust a failure-to-train on the use of excessive force and Tasers, but also a failure-to train-on\nrendering medical aid. That claim was largely ignored by the district court, and it is unclear\nwhether or not it was adequately pled. (The operative complaint alleges only that the City\n\u201cfailed to implement and/or enforce policies, practices, and procedures for the Fort Worth\nPolice Department that respected Jermaine Darden\u2019s constitutional rights to assistance,\nprotection, and equal treatment under the law\u201d; that the City is responsible for \u201cassuring\nsafety for all citizens of the City of Fort Worth\u201d; that Mr. Darden told Officers Snow and\nRomero that he could not breathe but that his pleas were ignored; that Mr. Darden \u201cwas not\nprovided with medical attention and sat unresponsive for at least 15 minutes before Medstar\narrived\u201d; and that the City \u201cfailed to implement and/or enforce the policies, procedures, and\npractices necessary to provide constitutionally adequate protection and assistance to [Mr.]\nDarden during his struggle to survive and implemented policies, procedures and practices\nwhich actually interfered with or prevented [Mr.] Darden from receiving the protection,\nassistance, and care he deserved.\u201d) But resolving that question is unnecessary. At no point\ndid Plaintiff-Appellant offer any evidence regarding how the City\u2019s training on rendering\nmedical aid is defective. That claim, like the others, therefore fails.\n\n\n                                               7\n\f",
