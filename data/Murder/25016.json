            "opinion_text": "\nW. FLETCHER,\nconcurring in the denial of rehearing en banc, joined by Judge BYBEE. Judge SINGLETON may not vote on petitions for rehearing en banc, but he agrees with what is written here.\nWe make four points in response to Judge CALLAHAN\u2019S dissent from the denial of the petition for rehearing en banc.\nFirst, the dissent begins:\nFifteen-year-old Adrian Reyes confessed to killing sixteen-year-old Derek Ochoa in a drive-by shooting. He first confessed after acknowledging many times that he was not under arrest and was not required to talk, freely leaving two previous police interviews, taking a polygraph that he and his parents not only consented to but that Reyes initially suggested, and then asking to speak with detectives. After Reyes confessed, those detectives drove him to another location where they told him that he was no longer free to leave and read him his Miranda rights. He again confessed.\nDissent at 1004.\nAn unsuspecting reader might conclude that Reyes was not in custody when he \u201cfirst confessed,\u201d and that his first confession was therefore not taken in violation of Miranda. The reader would be mistaken. The California Court of Appeal explicitly held to the contrary. It wrote:\nIt is not disputed that defendant was in custody after completion of the polygraph exam, when [polygraph examiner] Heard told defendant he had failed the polygraph test and had lied about his nonparticipation in the murder. Because defendant was not advised of his Miranda rights at this point, his statements made thereafter, while at the sheriffs station, were inadmissible under Miranda v. Arizona[.]\nPeople v. Reyes, No. D047521, 2010 WL 3026227, at *7 (Cal. Ct. App. Aug. 4, 2010).\nSecond, the dissent contends that Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence in Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004), does not provide the controlling test in two-step interrogation cases. We first concluded in 2006 that Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence provides the controlling test. See United States v. Williams, 435 F.3d 1148 (9th Cir. 2006). Of the seven circuits that have addressed the issue, six agree with us. See United States v. Capers, 627 F.3d 470, 476 (2d Cir. 2010); United States v. Torres-Lona, 491 F.3d 750, 758 (8th Cir. 2007); United States v. Street, 472 F.3d 1298, 1313 (11th Cir. 2006); United States v. Courtney, 463 F.3d 333, 338 (5th Cir. 2006); United States v. Kiam, 432 F.3d 524, 532 (3d Cir. 2006); United States v. Mashburn, 406 F.3d 303, 309 (4th Cir. 2005). The seventh concludes that Justice Souter\u2019s plurality controls. See United States v. Ray, 803 F.3d 244, 272 (6th Cir. 2015). That conclusion cannot *1003help the dissent because Justice Souter\u2019s test is less favorable to police interrogators; an interrogation that fails Justice Kennedy\u2019s test will necessarily fail Justice Souter\u2019s test. Three other circuits have applied both Justice Kennedy and Justice Souter\u2019s tests without choosing between the two. See United States v. Widi, 684 F.3d 216, 221 (1st Cir. 2012); United States v. Lee, 618 F.3d 667, 678 (7th Cir. 2010); United States v. Carrizales-Toledo, 454 F.3d 1142, 1151 (10th Cir. 2006).\nThird, the dissent contends that our opinion \u201cpermits federal courts to read the worst into state court decisions on habeas review,\u201d and that it \u201crequires all courts to presume the worst of police officers in applying Seibert.\u201d Dissent at 1004. We strongly disagree. We carefully provide AEDPA deference to the decision of the California Court of Appeal, and our opinion presumes the contrary.\nTwo of us, Judges Fletcher and Bybee, conclude that the Court of Appeal misunderstood both Miranda and Seibert, and that its decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d those cases, when it tested the validity of Reyes\u2019s confession based on whether it had been voluntary. It has been clearly established Supreme Court law, ever since Miranda, that the test for admissibility of a confession is not whether it was voluntary. Rather, the test is whether it was taken in violation of Miranda.\nAll three of us conclude that the Court of Appeal made an \u201cunreasonable determination of the facts\u201d in concluding that, in employing their two-step interrogation, the officers did not deliberately undermine the effectiveness of the Miranda warning that was eventually provided. We describe in painstaking detail every interaction between the officers and Reyes. We unanimously conclude that a court cannot reasonably determine, based on the factual record, that the officers did not deliberately undermine the effectiveness of the Miranda warning.\nFourth, the dissent says that our decision \u201clet[s] a confessed murderer walk.\u201d Dissent at 1004. We are not as confident as the dissent that Reyes is, in fact, a murderer. There is reason to believe that fifteen-year-old Reyes confessed to a crime he did not commit.\nExcept for Reyes\u2019s confession, the evidence at trial pointed to Reyes\u2019s cousin, Munoz, as the shooter. It is undisputed that Reyes was a passenger in the back seat, and that Munoz was the driver. Two witnesses testified that the driver of the car shot the victim. One of those witnesses identified Munoz as the driver and shooter. The other witness testified that the driver was the shooter, but could not identify Munoz. Two other witnesses testified that they heard shots, but did not see the shooting. None of the witnesses testified that the shooter had been a passenger in the back seat.\nReyes did not want to snitch on his older cousin. During the interrogation, Reyes said, \u201cWell, if I say something like what\u2019s going to happen with my cousin? Is he still gonna go to jail? ... He had nothing to do with it.\u201d Further, Reyes may well have thought that a confession would have limited adverse consequences for him. Before Reyes made his in-custody confession, Officer Heard had told him, \u201c[Y]ou have my word I won\u2019t trick you,\u201d and \u201cFifteen-year-olds don\u2019t go to state prison, Adrian.\u201d\nIn sum, our opinion gives full deference under AEDPA to the decision of the California Court of Appeal. After careful consideration of the entire record and of the decision of the Court of Appeal, we conclude that the decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d Seibert, and that it was based on an unreasonable factual determination that the interrogating officers did not deliberately *1004undermine the effectiveness of their belated Miranda warning.\n",

            "opinion_text": "\nCALLAHAN, Circuit Judge,\nwith whom, O\u2019SCANNLAIN, TALLMAN, BE A, and IKUTA, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:\nFifteen-year-old Adrian Reyes confessed to killing sixteen-year-old Derek Ochoa in a drive-by shooting. He first confessed after acknowledging many times that he was not under arrest and was not required to talk, freely leaving two previous police interviews, taking a polygraph that he and his parents not only consented to but that Reyes initially suggested, and then asking to speak with detectives. After Reyes confessed, those detectives drove him to another location where they told him that he was no longer free to leave and read him his Miranda rights. He again confessed. A jury found Reyes guilty of first-degree murder. The state appellate court affirmed, the California Supreme Court denied Reyes\u2019s petition for review, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari. In a supreme display of Ninth Circuit legerdemain, the panel majority reviewed de novo, found that Reyes\u2019s confession was obtained in violation of Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 169 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004), and thus reversed the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief. The panel truly conjured its magic from nothing \u2014 the panel did not watch the videos of the police interviews, Reyes argued to the state appellate court that a deliberate Miranda violation was not at issue, and Reyes never mentioned Seibert in federal court until the panel told him to.\nLike the district court and state court judges, I disagree with the panel, which makes three errors of exceptional importance. First, the panel wrongly concludes that Justice Kennedy\u2019s subjective-intent requirement in Seibert, which seven other Justices rejected, is clearly established Supreme Court law. Second, the panel wrongly permits federal courts to read the worst into state court decisions on habeas review. Third, the panel wrongly requires all courts to presume the worst of police officers in applying Seibert. The panel\u2019s decision not only misunderstands Seibert, conflicts with our recent en banc decisions, and creates circuit splits, but also threatens to interfere with reasonable police work and let a confessed murderer walk.\nI respectfully dissent from this court\u2019s failure to rehear this case en banc.\nI.\nThis case\u2019s background is important to understanding how far the panel strayed from the scope of its review under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). While the panel\u2019s coverage of this background is incomplete in other respects, I will only supplement the panel\u2019s depiction of Reyes\u2019s third police interview and this case\u2019s procedural history.\nA. Factual background\nPolice officers questioned Reyes about Ochoa\u2019s murder on January 13, 2006, February 9, 2006, and February 10, 2006. Reyes was told that he was not under arrest at the first two interviews, and he left both interviews free. At the February 9th interview, Reyes offered to take a polygraph test.\nThe following day, Reyes voluntarily returned to the San Bernardino County Sheriffs station to take the polygraph test. Reyes\u2019s parents consented to the test, which Robert Heard, the San Bernardino Sheriffs polygrapher, administered. Heard first explained at great length that Reyes was not under arrest, and Reyes responded that he understood. Heard noted that Reyes\u2019s parents had given permission for Reyes to take the test but emphasized that *1005\u201c[t]he decision on whether or not Adrian is gonna take a polygraph exam is with Adrian. That\u2019s your decision. Okay?\u201d Heard reiterated, \u201cAfter we talk or at any time you can say you know what Bob? I ain\u2019t spillin\u2019, I don\u2019t wanna talk to you anymore. I wanna go. Just say so. You\u2019re out a here, you\u2019re gone, you with me?\u201d Reyes said he understood. Heard walked Reyes through a consent form in detail. Reyes read part of the form aloud, stating \u201cI understand that I cannot be forced to take this test. And you know what? I have the right at any time to leave ... my examination room.\u201d Reyes confirmed that he understood the consent form and signed it.\nAfter several \u201cdry runs\u201d during which Reyes contradicted his previous narrative by placing himself in the silver Toyota Camry involved in the shooting near the scene and time of Ochoa\u2019s murder, Reyes took the polygraph and denied involvement in the murder. Heard told Reyes that he failed the test. Heard continued questioning, appealed to the importance of telling the truth, and suggested that Reyes tell him if there were any mitigating circumstances. Reyes stated a few times that he didn\u2019t want to talk any more during the questioning that followed, but he never sought to end the interview and leave. Reyes asked what would happen if he didn\u2019t say anything. Heard responded that the investigation would continue \u2014 \u201cThey!re gonna work it, and they\u2019re gonna put it together.\u201d Reyes later said he didn\u2019t want to talk \u201ccause even if I say anything or if I don\u2019t, everybody[ ] that they got on the list is gonna do 25 years prison.\u201d Reyes asked, \u201cSo if I say who the shooter was, I\u2019m still gonna go to jail?\u201d Heard responded more than once that he did not have an answer to that question, though Heard had previously stated that fifteen-year olds don\u2019t go to state prison.\nReyes asked for some time and Heard offered to wait outside, but Reyes then said \u201cNo, it\u2019s alright.\u201d After Heard asked another question, Reyes responded \u201cnot that I know, you know, so don\u2019t ask any question.\u201d Heard asked Reyes if he wanted to be alone, and Reyes responded \u201cNo, it\u2019s just, just don\u2019t ask any questions.\u201d When Heard said he was not just going to sit there and do nothing, Reyes asked, \u201cCan we just call the detectives?\u201d\nShortly thereafter, in the same room, Detectives Brandt and Medici questioned Reyes. When Brandt asked whether Reyes was in the front passenger seat, Reyes stated \u201cNo, I\u2019ll say nothing, man.\u201d Reyes refused to identify the other person in the car and stated that \u201cwe\u2019re still gonna do time in jail anyway.\u201d Detective Brandt responded that the jail time \u201cmay be minimal or it, it may be a lot, but like we told you yesterday, uh, people have, you have to tell the, the truth.\u201d Detective Brandt later asked Reyes how many 15-year olds he knew that went to jail for 25 years and why Reyes would be any different. Later in the interrogation, however, Reyes continued to acknowledge that he would do \u201c25 years to life\u201d if he shot Ochoa.\nNot long after the Detectives began questioning, Reyes confessed that he shot Ochoa: \u201cI just shot.\u201d As Ochoa approached the car, Reyes felt afraid and \u201cgot mad. [He] opened the door so he would like back up.\u201d Then he shot. As the panel majority observes, \u201cReyes\u2019s statement that he had shot Ochoa came early in the interview, on the seventh page of the transcript.\u201d Maj. Op. 1021. After this confession, the detectives continued questioning and tried unsuccessfully to determine who else was involved.\nAfter the interview at the San Bernardi-no Sheriffs station concluded, Detective Brandt drove Reyes back to the Riverside police station where Detectives Brandt and Medici again questioned Reyes. It is unclear how much time passed, but the panel *1006states that the station was 15 miles away. At the beginning of the interview, Brandt explained that Reyes was no longer free to leave and thus Brandt was required to read Reyes his Miranda rights. After reading him his rights, Brandt then asked if they could \u201ctalk about stuff we talked about earlier today?\u201d Reyes said yes. In the interrogation that followed, the detectives did not use the earlier interview to impeach Reyes. The only reference back was to an earlier statement by Reyes that Ochoa had thrown something at the car. Reyes admitted to shooting Ochoa but said Ochoa looked like he also had a gun.\nB. Procedural background\nReyes was charged in California Superi- or Court with first-degree murder. At the outset of the trial, Reyes sought to suppress the statements he had made to law enforcement on February 10, 2006. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial judge suppressed the statements Reyes made before being advised of his Miranda rights, finding that Reyes had been in custody. The trial judge did not suppress the post-warning statements. The jury found Reyes guilty of first-degree murder with gang and firearm enhancements.\nReyes appealed, claiming, among other things, that the trial court erred in admitting his post-warning confession. Reyes argued that \u201cthe coercive atmosphere of the involuntary statements was never dissipated\u201d and that the \u201cadmonition of rights was too little, too late.\u201d He did not argue that the detectives deliberately violated Miranda. In fact, Reyes argued at length in his reply brief in the state appellate court that the State had incorrectly characterized Seibert as requiring \u201ccoordinated interrogation tactics designed to produce an unwarned confession.\u201d1 In other words, according to Reyes, whether the officers deliberately employed a two-part interrogation tactic designed to undermine the import of subsequent Miranda warnings was not at issue. Rather, the operative question, according to Reyes himself, was whether \u201cappellant\u2019s post-polygraph statements were voluntary,\u201d and, if not, \u201cwhether the taint from the involuntary admissions was dissipated before the sta-tionhouse admissions were made.\u201d\nThe state appellate court affirmed in a lengthy, reasoned decision. People v. Reyes, No. D047521, 2010 WL 3026227 (Cal. Ct. App. Aug. 4, 2010). Because it was uncontested that the detectives did not violate Miranda in bad faith, the state appellate court agreed with Reyes on the relevant legal inquiry. The court explained, \u201c[A]s defendant recognizes, the fact the interrogation at the sheriffs station was not accompanied by Miranda advisals does not invalidate the later Mirandized statements unless the later admissions were in fact involuntary or the tainted product of the initial statements or confession.\u201d Id. at *12. Applying this standard, the court determined that Reyes\u2019s pre- and post-warning confessions were voluntary and thus the post-warning confession was admissible. The court distinguished Seibert, explaining that \u201cthe circumstances in the instant case need not \u2018be seen as challenging the comprehensibility and efficacy of the Miranda warnings to the point that a *1007reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes would not have understood them to convey a message that [he] retained a choice about continuing to talk.\u2019\u201d Id. at *13 (alteration in original) (quoting Seibert, 542 U.S. at 616, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (plurality opinion)).\nReyes sought review of the state appellate court\u2019s decision by the California Supreme Court. In his briefs before the California Supreme Court, Reyes did not mention Seibert. The California Supreme Court denied his petitions. The U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari.\nReyes then filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court. In his briefs below, he again did not mention Seibert. Magistrate Judge Eick issued a 53-page report and recommendation that relief be denied. District Judge Feess adopted the report in full. Consistent with Reyes\u2019s arguments, and like the state appellate court, the district court focused on whether a reasonable jurist could conclude that Reyes\u2019s confessions were voluntary. However, the district court raised and distinguished Seibert because \u201cthere is no evidence that the law enforcement officers deliberately applied a two-step method, and the state courts reasonably concluded that Petitioner\u2019s post-warning statements were voluntarily made.\u201d\nReyes then appealed to the Ninth Circuit. On appeal, he did not cite Seibert or take issue with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the detectives had not employed a two-part interrogation in deliberate violation of Miranda. The panel nonetheless ordered \u201csupplemental briefing on the applicability of [Seibert] to this case.\u201d Reyes\u2019s supplemental brief marked the first time that he clearly argued that the officers\u2019 \u201cfailure to warn ... was not made in good faith and was ... a deliberate attempt to deprive him of his constitutional rights.\u201d The panel reviewed de novo the Seibert argument that it directed Reyes to make and, after engaging in appellate fact-finding on a record that did not even include the videos of the police interviews, found it persuasive.2 The panel thus reversed the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief and ordered that relief be granted if Reyes is not retried for Ochoa\u2019s now ten-and-a-half-year-old murder.\nII.\nIn reversing the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief, the panel committed three critical errors, any one of which should have prompted en banc review.\nA. The panel wrongly concluded that Justice Kennedy\u2019s lone concurrence in Seibert is clearly established Supreme Court law.\nThe panel\u2019s amended opinion holds that Justice Kennedy\u2019s lone concurrence in Sei-bert is clearly established law under the reasoning-based approach to applying Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977). We recently adopted the reasoning-based or \u201ccommon-denominator-of-the-reasoning rule\u201d in United States v. Davis, 825 F.3d 1014 (9th Cir.2016) (en banc). In Davis, we concluded that Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in Freeman v. United States, 564 U.S. 522, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), was not controlling under the reasoning-based rule because the Freeman plurality and dissent explicitly rejected the concurrence\u2019s reasoning. Davis, 825 F.3d at 1022 (\u201cThe Freeman plurality explicitly rejected the concurrence\u2019s reasoning.\u201d); id. at 1025 (\u201cThe Freeman dissent is similarly critical of Justice Sotomayor .... \u201d); see also id. (emphasizing that \u201cJustice Soto-*1008mayor explicitly\u201d rejected the dissent\u2019s rule). We concluded that \u201c[t]his fundamental divergence in reasoning is enough to demonstrate that Justice Sotomayor\u2019s rationale is not controlling Supreme Court law.\u201d Id. at 1022. We explained that this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that there may be cases where relief would be granted under the concurrence\u2019s rule but not the plurality\u2019s rule. Id. at 1022-23.\nApplying the common-denominator-of-the-reasoning Marks rule to Seibert, other circuit courts have found that Justice Kennedy\u2019s Seibert concurrence is \u201cobviously not the \u2018common denominator\u2019 that Marks was talking about.\u201d United States v. Heron, 564 F.3d 879, 883-87 (7th Cir. 2009); see also United States v. Ray, 803 F.3d 244, 270-72 (6th Cir. 2015). Just as the plurality and dissent expressly rejected elements of Justice Sotomayor\u2019s reasoning in Freeman, the plurality and dissent expressly (and even more emphatically) rejected Justice Kennedy\u2019s reasoning in Sei-bert. As the Sixth Circuit explained, \u201cthree of the four Justices in the plurality and the four dissenters decisively rejected any subjective good faith consideration, based on deliberateness on the part of the police.\u201d3 Ray, 803 F.3d at 271 (quoting United States v. Rodriguez-Preciado, 399 F.3d 1118, 1139-41 (9th Cir. 2005) (Berzon, J., dissenting)); see also United States v. Carrizales-Toledo, 454 F.3d 1142, 1151 (10th Cir. 2006). Under the reasoning-based Marks rule, reasoning expressly rejected by at least seven Justices cannot be elevated to the status of controlling Supreme Court law.\nAs in Davis, this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that there are likely to be cases where relief would be granted under Justice Kennedy\u2019s test but not the plurality\u2019s test. The plurality\u2019s test is concerned with the effectiveness of the belated Miranda warnings. The plurality looks to \u201cthe completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation, the overlapping content of the two statements, the timing and setting of the first and the second, the continuity of police personnel, and the degree to which the interrogator\u2019s questions treated the second round as continuous with the first.\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at 615, 124 S.Ct. 2601. These and other objective facts are relevant to assessing whether \u201ca reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes would [ ] have understood [the Miranda warnings] to convey a message that she retained a choice about continuing to talk.\u201d Id. at 617, 124 S.Ct. 2601. By contrast, Justice Kennedy looks first to whether the police deliberately violated Miranda and, if so, whether the officers used \u201ccurative measures ... before the postwarning statement is made,\u201d such as \u201can additional warning that explains the likely inadmissibility of the prewarning custodial statement.\u201d Id. at 622, 124 S.Ct. 2601.\nThere are likely to be cases involving deliberate Miranda violations where most of the plurality\u2019s \u201ceffectiveness factors\u201d are met but, because no explanation of the *1009prewarning statement\u2019s inadmissibility or other \u201cspecific, curative step\u201d was taken, Justice Kennedy\u2019s curative measures requirement isn\u2019t. Similarly, there are likely cases involving deliberate violations where Justice Kennedy\u2019s curative-measures requirement is met because \u201cspecific, curative steps\u201d were taken, such as a warning that the pre-Miranda confession could not be used against the suspect, but the plurality\u2019s effectiveness requirement isn\u2019t. For example, the plurality\u2019s effectiveness requirement may not be satisfied because of \u201cthe completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation, the overlapping content of the two statements, the timing and setting of the first and the second, [and] the continuity of police personnel.\u201d Id. at 615, 124 S.Ct. 2601.\nIt is true that some courts have held that Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence is controlling. However, just as the Davis opinion observed in distinguishing other circuits\u2019 treatment of Freeman, all of these courts \u201cengage with Marks only superficially, quoting its language with no analysis,\u201d Davis, 825 F.3d at 1024, and apparently applying a results-based Marks rule.4 It is clear that the panel\u2019s amended opinion creates an additional circuit split on how the reasoning-based Marks rule applies to Seibert. See Ray, 803 F.3d at 267-73; Heron, 564 F.3d at 883-87.5\nEvidently, the upshot of our en banc decision in Davis is that fractured Supreme Court decisions like Seibert are binding on state courts but not on us. But the panel\u2019s conclusion that Seibert is binding on state courts is even more questionable under AEDPA. At the very least, the \u201cfair-minded disagreement\u201d between circuit courts on whether Seibert created any controlling rule, shows that Justice Kennedy\u2019s deliberateness requirement is not \u201cclearly established law\u201d within the meaning of AEDPA.6 See White v. Woodall, \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1697, 1703, 188 L.Ed.2d 698 (2014); Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 102-03, 131 S.Ct. 770, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).\nB. The panel violated AEDPA by presuming that the state appellate court did not understand and follow clearly established law.\nEven if Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence were clearly established Supreme Court law, the panel violated AEDPA. The panel majority deemed itself unfettered by AEDPA because, in its view, the state appellate court\u2019s decision did not expressly make a finding regarding the deliberate*1010ness element of Justice Kennedy\u2019s test in Seibert. However, the state appellate court\u2019s decision is readily reconciled with Seibert.\nFirst, several parts of the state appellate court\u2019s decision may be read to acknowledge expressly that the detectives did not deliberately violate Miranda. The court found \u201cno evidence that defendant was coerced into waiving his rights,\u201d and explained that Detective Brandt \u201cadvise[d] [Reyes] of his Miranda rights before questioning him further\u201d at the police station because Brandt no longer regarded Reyes as being \u201cfree to leave.\u201d Reyes, 2010 WL 3026227, at *6, 13. The state appellate court also distinguished People v. Neal, 31 Cal.4th 63, 80-81, 1 Cal.Rptr.3d 650, 72 P.3d 280 (2003), \u201cin which a police detective intentionally continued interrogation in deliberate violation of Miranda.\u201d Id. at *9. Moreover, the state court\u2019s decision tacitly acknowledges, as the record confirms, that Reyes did not even contend that the officers violated Miranda in bad faith. The court explained that, accordingly, \u201cas defendant recognizes, the fact the interrogation at the sheriffs station was not accompanied by Miranda advisals does not invalidate the later Mirandized statements unless the later admissions were in fact involuntary or the tainted product of the initial statements or confession.\u201d Id. at *12 (emphasis added). This is the correct inquiry under Justice Kennedy\u2019s Seibert test in cases where it is undisputed that the officers did not violate Miranda in bad faith.7\nThe panel does not attempt to address this textual evidence that the state court correctly understood the law. In any case, such parsing of sentences in the state court\u2019s decision takes us beyond our role under AEDPA. Even if the decision were silent or ambiguous on whether the detectives deliberately violated Miranda, de novo review is still foreclosed. Under controlling Supreme Court precedent, we must presume \u201cstate courts know and follow the law,\u201d give state courts \u201cthe benefit of the doubt,\u201d and make an \u201ceffort to reconcile\u201d the reasoning of state courts with controlling Supreme Court rules. Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 24, 123 S.Ct. 357, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002); see also Renico v. Lett, 559 U.S. 766, 773, 130 S.Ct. 1855, 176 L.Ed.2d 678 (2010); Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 333, n.7, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997); Poyson v. Ryan, 743 F.3d 1185, 1199 (9th Cir. 2013), as amended (Apr. 2, 2014) (\u201cAEDPA does not allow us to presume from an ambiguous record that the state court applied an unconstitutional standard.\u201d), overruled on other grounds by McKinney v. Ryan, 813 F.3d 798 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc). Like its first major error, the panel\u2019s second error also conflicts with a recent en banc decision of this court. The panel majority\u2019s reasoning is clearly irreconcilable with our rule in Mann v. Ryan, 828 F.3d 1143, 1158, 2016 WL 3854234, at *11 (9th Cir. July 15, 2016) (en banc), that if \u201cwe can read the [state court] decision to comport with clearly established federal law, we must do so.\u201d\nSecond, as Judge Singleton explained in his concurrence in this ease, the state court\u2019s analysis can also be reconciled with Seibert if the decision is read to have found that the Miranda warnings were effective.\n*1011The state court made the following finding in distinguishing Seibert:\nUnlike in Missouri v. Seibert (2004) 542 U.S. 600, 616, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643, the circumstances in the instant case need not \u201cbe se\u00e9n as challenging the comprehensibility and efficacy of the Miranda warnings to the point that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes would not have understood them to convey a message that [he] retained a choice about continuing to talk.\u201d (Id. at p. 616, 124 S.Ct. 2601.)\nReyes, 2010 WL 3026227, at *13. This finding of effectiveness provides an additional ground for distinguishing Seibert, even assuming that the detectives deliberately violated Miranda. Under either ground, the panel majority erred in \u201cfreeing] itself from AEDPA\u2019s strictures.\u201d Keman v. Hinojosa, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1603, 1605, 194 L.Ed.2d 701 (2016) (per curiam). As explained below, we need not reach the question whether the state appellate court\u2019s effectiveness finding was an objectively unreasonable application of Seibert because a reasonable jurist could conclude that any Miranda violation was unintentional.\nC. The panel wrongly presumed that the police violated Miranda in bad faith, and conflated the deliberateness of a Miranda violation with the effectiveness of a subsequent Miranda warning.\nEven if de novo review were appropriate, the panel\u2019s decision misinterprets Sei-bert and creates bad law on how courts should assess whether police officers deliberately violated Miranda.\nThe panel begins its analysis of whether the detectives deliberately violated Miranda by stating, \u201c \u2018the most plausible reason\u2019 for delaying Miranda warnings until after a suspect has confessed \u2018is an illegitimate one, which is the interrogator\u2019s desire to weaken the warning\u2019s effectiveness.\u2019\u201d Maj. Op. 1030 (quoting United States v. Williams, 435 F.3d 1148, 1159 (9th Cir. 2006)). The panel\u2019s presumption of bad faith is contrary to Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence in Seibert, effectively overrules Elstad, and removes a habeas corpus petitioner\u2019s burden of proving a constitutional violation. See Thompson v. Runnels, 657 F.3d 784, 788-91 (9th Cir.) (Callahan, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (explaining that \u201ccontrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, ... Seibert did not overrule Elstad'\u2019), vae\u2019d sub nom. McEwen v. Thompson, \u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 578, 181 L.Ed.2d 418 (2011).\nAs the State points out, nothing in Sei-bert \u201csuggests that it is necessary or proper to presume wrongdoing on the part of police.\u201d Justice Kennedy explained that his test would apply only \u201cin the infrequent case\u201d where detectives deliberately violated Miranda. Seibert, 542 U.S. at 622, 124 S.Ct. 2601. He emphasized that in most cases \u201c[t]he admissibility of postwarning statements should continue to be governed by the principles of Elstad.\u201d Id. He \u201csuggested a number of plausible reasons why an officer might legitimately wait to deliver Miranda warnings, including that \u2018[a]n officer may not realize that a suspect is in custody and warnings are required.\u2019\u201d United States v. Stewart, 536 F.3d 714, 720 (7th Cir. 2008) (alteration in original) (quoting Seibert, 542 U.S. at 620, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment)).\nOther circuits have rightly refused to presume that police officers act in bad faith. See, e.g., id. at 720-21; Carrizales-Toledo, 454 F.3d at 1153 (concluding that there was no deliberate two-step interrogation because \u201cit is likely that [the officer] failed to provide the Miranda warning because at that point it was unclear whether [the suspect] was in custody\u201d). Indeed, *1012the Supreme Court has admonished that \u201cthe task of defining \u2018custody\u2019 is a slippery one, and police [officers] investigating serious crimes [cannot realistically be expected to] make no errors whatsoever.\u201d Elstad, 470 U.S. at 309, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (second alteration in original). Where police officers engrossed in the moment mistake the difficult line between custodial and noncustodial interviews, we will not suppress subsequent warned and voluntary \u201cadmissions of guilt by wrongdoers, [which] are inherently desirable.\u201d Id. at 305, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (quoting United States v. Washington, 431 U.S. 181, 187, 97 S.Ct. 1814, 52 L.Ed.2d 238 (1977)).\nThe panel also misconstrued Seibert, collapsed the plurality and concurrence\u2019s tests, and effectively overruled Elstad by conflating the issue of whether the detectives deliberately violated Miranda with the issue of whether the midstream-Afi-randa warning was effective. The majority found indicative of deliberateness the facts that the pre-warning and post-warning confessions overlapped in content, the detectives did not take specific curative measures, and there was overlap in personnel. These facts do not pertain to the subjective intent of the detectives; they pertain to assessing whether \u201ca reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes would ... have understood [the midstream-Afircmda. warnings] to convey a message that she retained a choice about continuing to talk.\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at 617, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (plurality opinion).\nAt best, such evidence is neutral on whether detectives deliberately violated Miranda. For example, the fact that \u201cReyes provided essentially the same information,\u201d Maj. Op. 1031, during the warned and unwarned interrogations has little bearing on whether the detectives deliberately violated Miranda. Of course Reyes\u2019s pre-warning confession to murdering Ochoa overlapped with his post-warning confession to murdering Ochoa. How could it be otherwise? If \u201cthere was no earlier confession to repeat,\u201d Seibert would not apply and we would not need to consider deliberateness. Bobby v. Dixon, \u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 26, 31, 181 L.Ed.2d 328 (2011) (per curiam). Similarly, the fact that \u201cBrandt did not take curative measures,\u201d Maj. Op. 1031, is relevant to whether the midstream-Afmmda warning was effective. But this fact does not show that detectives who clearly endeavored to create a non-custodial interview employed a two-part interrogation in deliberate violation of Miranda. If the detectives thought the pre-warning interview was non-custodial, then they would have thought such \u201ccorrective measures\u201d to have been unnecessary. The panel\u2019s view that Brandt \u201cplayed down\u201d the importance of the Miranda warnings by stating that he wanted \u201cjust to clarify stuff,\u201d id. also is relevant to whether the midstre&amp;m-Miranda warning was effective. But such statements do not establish a deliberate Miranda violation. Again, if the detectives thought the pre-warning interview was non-custodial, they would have seen no problem with referencing it. As Justice Kennedy noted, \u201cSkilled investigators often interview suspects multiple times, and good police work may involve referring to prior statements to test their veracity or to refresh recollection.\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at 620, 124 S.Ct. 2601.\nThe panel also found the fact that the \u201cthree Riverside police officers involved in the case \u2014 Brandt, Wheeler and Medici\u2014 were all experienced officers\u201d to evidence a deliberate Miranda violation. Maj. Op. 1031. But the fact that the officers were seasoned is just as likely to evidence that they understood Miranda and endeavored to keep the interview non-custodial. Similarly, the fact that the detectives \u201cobtained the incriminating information from Reyes very early in the unwarned custodial inter*1013rogation,\u201d Maj. Op. 1032, does not evidence a deliberate Miranda violation. Rather, that Reyes quickly confessed once the detectives entered, at Reyes\u2019s request, shows that the officers would have had little reason to believe that Reyes no longer felt free to leave and thus that the interview had become custodial.\nInexplicably, the panel went as far as to attribute bad faith to the detectives because they questioned Reyes \u201cin a non-confrontational, sympathetic way, with the result that Reyes was made to feel ... comfortable ... and laugh[ ].\u201d Id. As explained below, this fact and many others that the panel ignored show that a reasonable jurist could find that the detectives did \u201cnot realize that [the] suspect [was] ip custody and warnings [were] required,\u201d which is a good-faith reason for not delivering Miranda warnings earlier. Seibert, 542 U.S. at 620, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment).\nD. The state appellate court and federal district court correctly found that the detectives did not deliberately violate Miranda and that Reyes\u2019s post-warning murder confession was admissible.\nUnder AEDPA, the state court\u2019s determination that no Miranda violation occurred is entitled to deference and should be upheld as long as \u201cfairminded jurists could disagree\u201d on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision. Harrington, 562 U.S. at 101, 131 S.Ct. 770. Even if de novo review applied' here, however, the panel erroneously concluded that the detectives deliberately violated Miranda. The weight of objective and subjective evidence favors the view that the reason that the pre-warning interview was unwarned is that the officers believed that Reyes was not in custody. After all, Reyes was repeatedly told that he was not under arrest and was free to leave, left two previous interviews free, requested the polygraph interview, consented to it verbally and in writing, and then asked to speak to the detectives after its conclusion. Under applicable case law, these facts and many others weigh strongly in favor of the view that the officers reasonably viewed the pre-warning interview to have been non-custodial.\nFor example, following the Supreme Court, \u201c[w]e have consistently held that a defendant is not in custody when officers tell him that he is not under arrest and is free to leave at any time,\u201d United States v. Bassignani, 575 F.3d 879, 886 (9th Cir. 2009), as the officers here repeatedly told Reyes.8 Courts have also consistently held that the fact that a defendant came to the police station voluntarily, as Reyes did here, weighs in favor of the view that he was not in custody. Beheler, 463 U.S. at 1122, 103 S.Ct. 3517 (noting that the suspect \u201cvoluntarily agreed to accompany police to the station house\u201d).9 Courts have also held that the fact that a defendant consented in writing to a polygraph test, as Reyes did here, is powerful evidence *1014that the defendant was not in custody. People v. Ochoa, 19 Cal.4th 353, 402, 79 Cal.Rptr.2d 408, 966 P.2d 442 (Cal. 1998).\nStill other objective facts support the view that the detectives reasonably believed that Reyes did not view himself to be in custody. For example, the detectives released Reyes after two previous interviews. See, e.g., Beheler, 463 U.S. at 1122, 103 S.Ct. 3517 (emphasizing that \u201cBeheler was permitted to return to his home\u201d). The officers did not restrain Reyes in the exam room or yell at him. They permitted Reyes to give narrative answers and \u201cappealed to his interest in telling the truth and being helpful.\u201d Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004). These are all signs that the officers endeavored to keep the pre-warning interview non-custodial, not to violate Miranda in bad faith.\nMoreover, the panel concedes that there is no subjective evidence that the detectives deliberately violated Miranda. There is, however, subjective evidence that they did not. As the state appellate court observed, Detective Brandt stated before giving the Miranda warnings that the warnings were now required because Reyes was no longer free to leave. Reyes, 2010 WL 3026227, at *6. The clear implication is that Detective Brandt did not believe that the warnings were required earlier because he believed the earlier interview was non-custodial.\nIt is true that some circumstances were indicative of custody and thus lend some support to the view that the officers knew that the pre-warning interview had turned custodial. In its analysis, the panel oddly does not mention the strongest of such evidence, that Reyes intermittently stated that he did not want to answer particular questions. Reyes, however, never sought to terminate the interview and leave. Especially given that Reyes had previously acknowledged many times that he could terminate the interview and leave, and had left two previous interviews free after intermittently declining to answer questions, the fact that the officers continued questioning him is not dispositive of a deliberate Miranda violation. Moreover, as the state appellate court emphasized, Officer \u201cHeard ultimately terminated the postpo-lygraph questioning upon defendant\u2019s request.\u201d Id. at *8. Reyes then asked to speak with the detectives, not to leave. Indeed, the transcripts suggest that Reyes remained because he was fishing for a deal.\nSimilarly, I cannot conclude on AEDPA or clear error review that the officers employed a two-part interrogation in deliberate violation of Miranda simply because the officers questioned Reyes\u2019s veracity, confronted him with evidence of his guilt, and suggested leniency. See, e.g., Mathiason, 429 U.S. at 493, 97 S.Ct. 711 (officers told the suspect that his fingerprints had been found at the scene and that \u201chis truthfulness would possibly be considered by the district attorney or judge\u201d); Stansbury v. California, 511 U.S. 318, 325, 114 S.Ct. 1526, 128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994) (telling a person he is a \u201cprime suspect\u201d does not necessarily mean he is under arrest because \u201csome suspects are free to come and go until the police decide to make an arrest\u201d).\nAgain, this is not to say that the pre-warning interview could not reasonably be viewed as custodial; that 20-20 hindsight legal conclusion made by judges is not at issue. What is at issue is whether officers engrossed in the moment knew that the interview had become custodial but deliberately pressed on to undermine the effect of subsequent Miranda warnings. It bears repeating that Miranda warnings need be given only once a suspect is in custody. There is nothing wrong with officers seeking to question a suspect in a non-custodial *1015situation. Rather, this may be viewed as good police work. So long as the officers believed that the interview remained noncustodial, where they turned out to be mistaken, a subsequent, warned confession must be allowed into evidence if voluntarily given. Here, a reasonable jurist could conclude, as did the state appellate court and the district court, that the detectives did \u201cnot realize that [Reyes was] in custody and warnings [were] required.\u201d See Seibert, 542 U.S. at 620, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment).\nBecause any Miranda violation by the detectives was not deliberate, the operative question under de novo review, as the state courts, the district court, the prosecution, and Reyes correctly recognized, is whether Reyes\u2019s post-warning confession is admissible under Elstad. Under Elstad, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, in fact, the second statement was also voluntarily made.\u201d Elstad, 470 U.S. at 318, 105 S.Ct. 1285. The state appellate court and the district court explained in detail why both the pre-warning and post-warning confessions were voluntary, and thus the post-warning confession was admissible. Reyes, 2010 WL 3026227, at *8-14. I will not repeat those courts\u2019 exhaustive analyses here. I note only that the state appellate court\u2019s conclusion that Reyes\u2019s confessions were voluntary must be given even \u201cmore leeway\u201d on AEDPA review given the inquiry\u2019s open-ended nature. See Alvarado, 541 U.S. at 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140; Harrington, 562 U.S. at 102, 131 S.Ct. 770 (\u201c[E]ven a strong case for relief does not mean the state court\u2019s contrary conclusion was unreasonable.\u201d). The panel majority has not conducted this inquiry, which should have been the focus of its analysis from the start given the absence of bad faith by the detectives.10\nIII.\nThe panel\u2019s decision conflicts with AED-PA, Supreme Court precedent, other circuits\u2019 precedent, our recent en banc decisions, and Seibert itself. Moreover, the panel is wrong in finding that Detective Brandt, Detective Wheeler, and Officer Heard violated Miranda in bad faith. Our failure to go en banc has consequences. Courts in our circuit will be permitted to read the worst into state court decisions and required to presume the worst of police officers in assessing whether a confession was constitutionally obtained. Reasonable police work will be disrupted. The decision effectively forces officers to tell wrongdoers that their pre-warning admissions may not be used against them, even where the officers do not believe that the pre-warning interview had become custodial. The State will be required to retry a *1016confessed murderer to secure justice. Its ability to succeed is uncertain given the decade that has passed since Ochoa\u2019s murder.\nFor these reasons, I dissent from our failure to take this case en banc.\n\n. The State had argued in its answering brief that there was no Miranda violation and that Seibert was distinguishable because, among other reasons, \"[tjhere was no evidence of a police policy of coordinated tactics designed to produce an un-warned confession.\u201d In one paragraph of his state habeas petition, Reyes argued that some tactics that the officers used, namely sneering and refusing to \"respect petitioner\u2019s efforts to end the interrogation,\u201d were \"deliberate\u201d and \"flagrant\u201d misconduct. But he did not argue that the officers employed a two-part interrogation in deliberate violation of Miranda, even after the State had addressed this issue.\n\n\n. The state appellate court and district court referenced videos of the interviews, but none was included in the record. Reyes, 2010 WL 3026227, at *6.\n\n\n. See Seibert, 542 U.S. at 616 n.6, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (plurality opinion) (\"[T]he focus is on facts apart from intent ....\u201d); id. at 623, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (\"[T]he plurality correctly declines to focus its analysis on the subjective intent of the interrogating officer.\u201d); id. at 624, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (\"The plurality's rejection of an intent-based test is also, in my view, correct.\u201d); id. at 625-26, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (\"[R]ecognizing an exception to [Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985)] for intentional violations would require focusing constitutional analysis on a police officer\u2019s subjective intent, an unattractive proposition that we all but uniformly avoid.\u201d); id. at 626-27, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (\"[T]he approach espoused by Justice Kennedy is ill advised ....

Circuits have also expressed skepticism. United States v. Straker, 800 F.3d 570, 617 (D.C. Cir. 2015); United States v. Verdugo, 617 F.3d 565, 575 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n\n.The panel\u2019s statement that the Sixth Circuit found the Seibert plurality opinion controlling in Ray is wrong. In Ray, the Sixth Circuit found that Seibert did not establish a controlling rule, and then chose to adopt as binding the rule articulated by the four-Justice plurality. Ray, 803 F.3d at 272. The panel fails to understand that a fractured Supreme Court decision that did not establish a controlling rule is not clearly established Supreme Court law under AEDPA.\n\n\n. The panel fundamentally misses the point of Seibert and Elstad in arguing that \"that the test for admissibility of a confession is not whether it was voluntary [but] whether it was taken in violation of Miranda.\u201d Concurrence at 1003. Again, even where a pre-warning interview was custodial and thus administered in violation of Miranda, a post-warning confession remains admissible under Justice Kennedy's concurrence so long as the officers did not deliberately violate Miranda and the confession was voluntary.\n\n\n.

Fields, - U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1181, 1185, 182 L.Ed.2d 17 (2012) (\u201cMost important, respondent was told at the outset of the interrogation, and was reminded again thereafter, that he could leave ....\u201d); California v.

The panel suggests that Reyes might not have been the triggerman, noting that two witnesses testified that the driver was the shooter. This suggestion not only epitomizes the type of second-guessing by our court that AEDPA is designed to limit, but also inaccurately characterizes the record. One of these two witnesses stated that the initial shots that hit Ochoa came from inside the car and then the driver stepped around the car and fired additional shots. Another witness testified that he heard gunshots and then saw a passenger get out of the back of the car and approach Ochoa. All of this, of course, went to the jury, but the panel apparently thinks itself capable of finding facts based on an incomplete, cold record. The panel\u2019s suggestion that Reyes was an innocent passenger who took the fall for his older cousin is further undercut by the fact that Reyes voluntarily confessed after acknowledging several times that he would do \u201c25 years to life\u201d for shooting Ochoa. Moreover, Reyes\u2019s guilt is beyond reasonable dispute. The evidence presented at trial shows overwhelmingly that Reyes and his cousin set out in Reyes\u2019s aunt's car to exact revenge on a rival neighborhood in retaliation for an assault on Reyes the previous day. They came across Ochoa and killed him in a drive-by as he waited outside of his house for his parents to take him to school.\n\n",

I join Judge Callahan\u2019s dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.\n2. I write separately to reiterate my view that United States v. Davis, 825 F.3d 1014 (9th Cir.2016) (en banc), was wrongly decided. As I explained in my Davis dissent, id. at 1032-37 (Bea, J., dissenting), Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977), requires that we apply a \u201cresults-based\u201d approach, not a \u201creasoning-based\u201d approach, when interpreting splintered Supreme Court decisions.\n3. Had my view commanded a majority of the Davis en banc Court, I would likely agree with the panel that Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion in Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004), provides a controlling rule. In my Davis dissent, I cited with approval United States v. Williams, 435 F.3d 1148, 1157-58 (9th Cir. 2006), which applied a results-based approach and concluded that \u201cboth the [Seibert] plurality and Justice Kennedy agree that where law enforcement officers deliberately employ a two-step interrogation to obtain a confession and where separations of time and circumstance and additional curative warnings are absent or fail to apprise a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes of his rights, the trial court should suppress the confession.\u201d However, I agree with Judge Callahan that, under the reasoning-based approach adopted in Davis, Williams should be revisited. See Callahan Dissent at 1007-09; see also United States v. Rodriguez-Preciado, 399 F.3d 1118, 1138-43 (9th Cir. 2005) (Berzon, J., dissenting).\n4.I also wish to underline two AED-PA-related points made by Judge Callahan in her dissent. First, our conclusion that Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion in Seibert provides a controlling rule \u2014 right or wrong \u2014 is not \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Even if we are bound by Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion in cases on direct review, there is a \u201cpossibility for fairminded disagreement\u201d regarding the controlling effect of that opinion, such that it may not control in cases, such as this one, in which AEDPA applies. Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 103, 131 S.Ct. 770, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011); see Callahan Dissent at 1008-09 (noting that other federal courts of appeals have found that Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion in Seibert does not provide a controlling rule). Second, we must give state -courts \u201cthe benefit of the doubt\u201d and attempt to reconcile the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision with Seibert. Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 24, 123 S.Ct. 357, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002) (per curiam). As Judge Callahan discusses, we can do so by reading the state-court decision to \u201cacknowledge expressly that the detectives did not deliberately violate Miranda.\u201d Callahan Dissent at 1010. Of course, whether the detectives acted with deliberation is quintessentially a factual issue. As Judge Callahan explains, a finding by the California Court of Appeal that the detectives did not deliberately violate Miranda was not \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2); see Callahan Dissent at 1012-15.\n*10175. For these reasons, I join Judge Callahan\u2019s dissent with the caveat that I continue to believe Dams was wrongly decided.\nW. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\nOPINION\nPetitioner Adrian Reyes petitions for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground, inter alia, that his state-court conviction rested on a confession obtained in violation of Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004). For the reasons that follow, we reverse the district court and remand with instructions to grant the writ.\nI. Factual Background\nOn January 11, 2006, an armed person exited a silver Toyota Camry and shot Derek Ochoa three times. The person may have yelled \u201cDelhi\u201d (the name of an Orange County gang). Ochoa died as a result of the shooting. He was a senior at La Sierra High School in Riverside County.\nRiverside Police Department officers traced the Camry to the home of Andres Munoz, an older cousin of petitioner Adrian Reyes. The car was registered to another member of the Munoz family, Albert. Reyes had recently moved to Riverside County from Orange County. He was a freshman at La Sierra. He was not quite two months past his fifteenth birthday.\nThe day before the shooting, Reyes had been walking home from school with a friend. A carload of gang members drove up and asked Reyes where he was from. Reyes answered \u201cDelhi.\u201d One of the gang members punched Reyes in the eye. They then drove away, yelling \u201cSouth Side Riverside 51-50.\u201d\nTwo days after the shooting, Riverside Police Department homicide detectives James Brandt and Rick Wheeler questioned Reyes at his aunt\u2019s home. Reyes had moved from his family\u2019s home to his aunt\u2019s home the day after his assault by the gang members. The detectives\u2019 questions related primarily to the assault. During the questioning, Reyes acknowledged that he had known Ochoa and that he knew Delhi was a \u201cgroup in Santa Ana.\u201d\nNearly a month later, on February 9, sometime between 5:20 and 5:30 in the morning, a SWAT team of between fifteen and twenty officers executed a search warrant on Reyes\u2019s aunt\u2019s home. They handcuffed Reyes and searched the house. In Reyes\u2019s bedroom they discovered papers with \u201cDelhi\u201d written in large block letters. After the house was secured, Reyes was released from handcuffs and allowed to eat breakfast.\nBrandt told Reyes that he was not under arrest, but that he wanted to ask him some questions at the station. Reyes acquiesced, and he was driven to the Riverside police station. Reyes was not accompanied to the station by any family member. At the station, Brandt and Wheeler together questioned Reyes. At no point during their questioning on February 9 did they provide Miranda warnings.\nReyes was held at the station for some time before he was questioned. Wheeler began the interview by saying, \u201cThanks for being so dang patient man I appreciate you ..'. [hjanging out for us \u2019cause it\u2019s been a long day, long day.\u201d Wheeler told Reyes that he could stop the interview at any time: \u201cI just wanna make sure that you understand that if we get at some point in the interview that you\u2019re done talkin\u2019 ... and you don\u2019t feel like answering any more questions or whatever, let me know, okay?\u201d\nWheeler asked briefly about the assault the day before the shooting. He then asked about the shooting. He said that the search *1018warrants had been executed and that they had talked \u201cwith all these different people.\u201d \u201c[W]e got pictures, too, ... and I\u2019ve had more than one person say that\u2019s the car that the guy was in, okay? ... I\u2019ve got enough information that shows that you were there.\u201d (Wheeler\u2019s . statement was false. The only witness who had made any type of identification had not identified Reyes.) According to the transcript, Wheeler was interrupted by the \u201csound of sniffing.\u201d Wheeler continued, \u201c[TJhere\u2019s no denying it. ... [T]he truth is gonna come out and, and I already know what it is.\u201d Reyes denied that he was there. \u201cI didn\u2019t go out that day you could ask my Mom, you would ask anybody in my home I didn\u2019t come out that day, I was sleeping.\u201d When Wheeler said that the police had spoken to kis family already, Reyes said, \u201cDon\u2019t you guys have a lie detector or something? I, I was in my house.\u201d\nBrandt then took over the questioning. He challenged Reyes, saying that he had his phone records. \u201cWhen your phone is being used basically six, seven, eight times an hour every, you know, on an average every five minutes so you\u2019re not sleeping okay?\u201d Brandt was interrupted by the \u201csound of sniffing.\u201d Brandt suggested a mitigating version of events: \u201cThere is a big difference between being in the car when this thing happens ... and being the shooter and stuff.... So just tell us what happened, okay?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve done our homework, dude and ... don\u2019t screw yourself and lie to us, seriously, tell us what happened.\u201d\nWheeler and Brandt pressed Reyes on the' inconsistency between Reyes\u2019s statements and his phone records. Wheeler asked him about the papers found in his room with \u201cDelhi written in big letters.\u201d Brandt said, \u201cWe work homicide, alright, we gonna do our homework, definitely, I\u2019m telling you, we have the car, we have the gun, we have five guns total.... \u201d (Brandt\u2019s statement was false. The Sheriffs Department had not recovered \u2014 indeed, never did recover \u2014 the gun used to shoot Ochoa.)\nWheeler and Brandt continued to press Reyes. Brandt said, \u201c[Tjhere\u2019s another detective was out showing witnesses the picture ... \u2019cause we had a picture of you.\u201d Wheeler immediately followed, \u201cAnd we identified you as being in the car.\u201d (Wheeler\u2019s statement was false. Reyes had not been identified by anyone as having been in the car.) Brandt said, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to trick you and ... I\u2019m not making the stuff up that I\u2019m telling you .... [S]o you know I\u2019m not trying to trick you.\u201d\nBrandt talked about Ochoa\u2019s family and their \u201cright to understand what happened.\u201d Reyes responded, \u201cI don\u2019t really want to say nothing no more ... trying to cooperate here.\u201d (Elision in original.) Brandt replied, \u201cYou\u2019re not cooperating.\u201d Brandt was interrupted multiple times by the \u201csound of sniffing.\u201d A moment later, Brandt said, \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d Reyes responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know nothing man.\u201d\nReyes said, \u201cStop asking me questions.\u201d Brandt said, \u201cNo I\u2019m not gonna stop asking you questions.\u201d Brandt was again interrupted by the \u201csound of sniffing.\u201d\nBrandt said, \u201c[A]re you willing to take a polygraph examination?\u201d Reyes responded, \u201cYeah.\u201d Brandt elaborated, \u201cAbout everything.\u201d Reyes responded, \u201cI guess, man, I don\u2019t know nothing man.\u201d Reyes mentioned that he might need to have his parents there, but Brandt interrupted him, saying, \u201c[W]e\u2019ll certainly arrange for all that stuff just seeing that you\u2019re willing to ... do it.\u201d\nA moment later, Reyes said, \u201cYou guys stop asking me ... kinda questions.\u201d (Elision in original.) \u201cStop[ ] asking this kind of stuff man.\u201d Wheeler, who had begun the *1019interview by telling Reyes that he could stop at any time, did not stop. He responded to Reyes, \u201cThe only rope that you got is me throwing it to you right now and telling you \u2018y gotta be clean\u2019 because you haven\u2019t been. This thing\u2019s gonna burn you down.\u201d\nWheeler persisted, interrupted frequently by the \u201csound of sniffing.\u201d Reyes continued to indicate that he did not want to talk. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to say man.\u201d Brandt took over the questioning: \u201cOkay, so witnesses identifying you and other people in the car identifying you, ... you\u2019re good with that? ... You want us to go in there with this two-hour conversation of you just lying about where you were when your phone records show it\u2019s not the case and all that stuff, you\u2019re comfortable with that.\u201d Reyes replied, \u201cStop asking me man. I don\u2019t know nothing.\u201d\nBrandt terminated the interview, saying, \u201cThis time when I walk out I\u2019m not gonna come back and give you another shot, okay? We\u2019re gonna, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll go to the D.A.\u2019s office and, and then later on to court with the case we have and, and I\u2019m, I\u2019m not worried about it, I\u2019m not gonna lose.\u201d Wheeler added, \u201cOh ya, we\u2019re not gonna lose that case.\u201d Brandt said, \u201cLast chance.\u201d Reyes responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know nothing man.\u201d\nThe transcript of the February 9 interview does not indicate start and stop times, but it is apparent from Brandt\u2019s statement referring to \u201cthis two-hour conversation,\u201d quoted above, that the interview took about two hours. Brandt testified at Reyes\u2019s preliminary hearing that the interview had taken \u201cforty minutes to an hour,\u201d but his testimony is inconsistent with what he himself said during the interview and with the length of the transcript. The interview was interrupted thirty-three times by the \u201csound of sniffing.\u201d\nReyes went to his mother\u2019s house to sleep that night. The next morning, Brandt and Michael Medici, another Riverside Police Department detective, picked up Reyes and took him to the San Bernardino County sheriffs station for a polygraph test. There is no written consent by an adult to the polygraph test. Brandt testified at the preliminary hearing that Reyes\u2019s mother gave permission \u201con the phone,\u201d and the record contains a police report stating that she had given permission. No family member accompanied Reyes to the sheriffs station.\nRobert Heard of the San Bernardino County Sheriffs Department administered the polygraph test. Before administering the test, Heard spoke with Reyes for a sustained period. He impressed on Reyes the fact that he was an experienced test administrator. He recounted that he had gone to \u201cpolygraph school\u201d \u201c9 years before you were born,\u201d and that he was in high demand as a polygraph teacher. At no point did Heard provide Miranda warnings.\nReyes had difficulty filling out a form Heard gave him, not knowing his zip code or his height and weight. Reyes had even more difficulty with the written consent form. When he did not understand the terms \u201cduress and coercion\u201d and \u201cimmunity,\u201d Heard explained them in simpler language. Reyes had particular trouble understanding what was meant by the sentence, \u201cI hereby release the County of San Ber-nardino, the Sheriffs Department and Examiner administering this examination from any and all claims resulting from, or arising out of, this examination. ...\u201d After Heard explained what \u201crelease ... from any and all claims\u201d meant, Reyes said, \u201cAlright, so that, that means like that you guys won\u2019t, won\u2019t trick me ....\u201d Heard corrected him, saying, \u201cWell, no, this doesn\u2019t say I won\u2019t trick you.\u201d Heard then added, \u201c[Y]ou have my word I won\u2019t trick you.\u201d Heard again explained what \u201cre*1020lease\u201d meant, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s what it means.\u201d Reyes responded, \u201cLike you haven\u2019t tricked me or something.\u201d Heard replied, \u201cExactly, exactly.\u201d Thus informed, Reyes signed the consent form.\nAfter administering the test, Heard told Reyes, \u2018You failed the test. I have no doubt that you were there when Derek was shot.\u201d (There is nothing in the record to indicate whether Reyes had in fact failed the test.) Heard pressed Reyes to give details about what he had done. Reyes asked, \u201c[L]ike what\u2019s the truth gonna help?\u201d Heard answered:\n[TJhey read my report and the detectives, their supervisor reads the report. ... And the District Attorney\u2019s gonna ask these detectives hey, how was Adrian? Is he one of these, you know \u2022 tough, gang banger type guys[ ]? No, no. Adrian\u2019s a nice young man. He cooperated, failed the test, and without hesitation he says hey, look, man, I feel bad about what happened.... Adrian, I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s gonna happen because you know what? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t[ ] know what\u2019s gonna happen because you haven\u2019t told me what happened out there.... [Y]ou tell me I\u2019m going to state prison for, I, I, said 25 to life or something like that. Fifteen year olds don\u2019t go to state prison, Adrian.\nReyes responded, \u201cI know, but I\u2019ve got a go to Juvenile Hall.\u201d Heard replied, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen because I, you haven\u2019t told me anything yet, Adrian.\u201d\nHeard continued to ask Reyes what happened, and Reyes repeated several times that he did not know. Heard asked from what side of the car the shooter had shot. Reyes responded, \u201cOh, not that I know, you know, so don\u2019t ask any question.\u201d Heard asked, \u201cYou wanna be alone?\u201d Reyes replied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s just, just don\u2019t ask any questions,\u201d and then said, \u201cCan we just call the detectives?\u201d\nBrandt and Medici then came into the room and took over from Heard. At no point in the interview that followed did they provide Miranda warnings.\nBrandt asked at the outset, \u201c[Wjhat\u2019s your biggest concern, going to jail?\u201d\nReyes: Think so.\nBrandt: At all or for a long time?\nReyes: For a long time.\nBrandt: Okay, how long do you think you would go to jail for?\nReyes: I don\u2019t know. Like it\u2019s a murder, probably like 25 years.\nBrandt: Yeah? How old are you?\nReyes: 15.\nBrandt: How many 15 year olds do you know that go to jail for 25 years?\nReyes: None.\nBrandt: Huh?\nReyes: None.\nBrandt: Okay, so why would you be any different?\nReyes: I don\u2019t know.\nBrandt then asked, \u201cRemember yesterday I asked you ... if Derek had anything in his hands or reached for his pockets, anything like that? You remember me asking you that?\u201d Reyes .replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Brandt then told Reyes that Ochoa had had a gun:\nThere\u2019s a reason, a very easy explanation to this whole thing.... The deal is ... Derek had a gun in his pocket.... Now, if he\u2019s going for a gun in his pocket or you believed he was going for a gun in his pocket and we find one, that\u2019s obviously, and it\u2019s, there\u2019s an explanation as to what happened. Maybe you just stopped and talked to him because you knew him, and then he\u2019s going for a gun or something like that ... and shit happens.\n(Third elision in original.) (Brandt\u2019s statement was false. Ochoa had not had a gun.)\n*1021Brandt went on, \u201cIf it\u2019s just ... a cold blooded thing, no, we just, went up and ... did it and, and shot him just because, um, and I don\u2019t feel bad about it ... that looks bad.\u201d Reyes said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d Brandt said, \u201cTell me, tell me why, how did it happen then?\u201d Reyes hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m scared, man. ... Make everybody go to prison and everything, like I want everybody to get locked up.\u201d Brandt responded, \u201c[I]f he\u2019s going for a gun, dude, ... that\u2019s gotta be explained. We have to know that and we have to be able to tell the District Attorney\u2019s office that .... \u201d Reyes still hesitated. After encouragement from Brandt, he finally said, \u201cUm hmm, hmm, well, he, you, he always had a gun.\u201d\nAfter more encouragement, Reyes said, \u201cHe was just running up to the car.\u201d Brandt asked, \u201cOkay, was he reaching for his pockets or anything like that?\u201d Reyes replied, \u201cYeah.\u201d Brandt said, \u201cOkay, and what happened?\u201d Reyes replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Reyes expressed concern about his older cousin, Andres Munoz, and sought to exculpate him. \u201cWell, if I say something like what\u2019s going to happen with my cousin? Is he still gonna go to jail? ... He had nothing to do with it.\u201d\nBrandt asked, \u201cDid you shoot him because you thought he was going for a gun? Yeah? Did you ... see the gun in his pocket?\u201d\nReyes: He was reaching for it.\nBrandt: Okay ... and then what happened?\nReyes: He had a grip on it.\nBrandt: Okay, do you remember ... what pocket it was in, what side it was in? Okay, do you remember seeing the grip of the gun though? And he was reaching for it? But what was he yelling at you guys?\nReyes: I don\u2019t know. It was just, I wasn\u2019t panicked ... ain\u2019t gonna say nothing, just scared.\nBrandt: You were scared cause he was going for the gun? And then, and what happened?\nReyes: I don\u2019t know. I just shot.\nReyes\u2019s statement that he had shot Ochoa came early in the interview, on the seventh page of the transcript. Brandt and Medici continued to question and talk to Reyes for another thirty-five pages. Much of the later exchange was friendly, even including a discussion of Christmas. Reyes said that his family opens presents at \u201ctwelve in the night.\u201d Brandt responded, \u201cOh, see I can\u2019t stay up that late,\u201d and Reyes laughed. Near the end of the interview, Medici asked, \u201cDoes your Mom know about any of this, your Dad?\u201d Reyes responded, \u201cIt\u2019ll be cool like if you guys don\u2019t tell my Mom, you know, cause ... [ljike it\u2019ll break her heart and shit, you know, cause like she\u2019s very religious.\u201d Brandt told Reyes, \u201cOh, we don\u2019t need to run over there.\u201d\nImmediately after the February 10 interview at the San Bernardino sheriffs station, Brandt drove Reyes back to the Riverside police station where he and Wheeler had interviewed him the day before. The length of the drive is not in the record, but it is apparent from a map of the area that it was no more than fifteen miles. When they arrived at the Riverside police station, Reyes was put in an interview room.\nBrandt and Medici together questioned Reyes. Brandt began the interview:\nOK. Uuh, we talked to people at the D.A.\u2019s office and stuff about the case. Kinda told them that, you know, you came clean and finally told us the truth and why things happened and, you know that you were, you know, obviously scared and all that kind of stuff. Uuh, there\u2019s more questions that they want answered, if we can. OK, just to, to clarify stuff. Alright, so I wanna talk to *1022you again, but because you\u2019ve been sitting in that .room and the door was locked and you\u2019re not free to leave, I wanna read you your rights, OK? And then ask you some questions. OK? You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer and have him present with you while you\u2019re being questioned. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before any questioning. Do you understand each of these rights that I\u2019ve explained to you? Yeah? OK. Can we talk \u25a0 about the stuff we talked about earlier today? Is that a yes?\nReyes, who had not previously spoken, answered, \u201cYeah.\u201d\nUnder questioning from Brandt, Reyes repeated his confession. At the end of the interview, Reyes said, \u201cLet me call my mom.\u201d Medici then handcuffed Reyes before taking him to McDonald\u2019s to get something to eat.\nThe total elapsed time, from when Brandt picked up Reyes at his mother\u2019s house on February 10 until the conclusion of the interview at the Riverside police station on the same day, was somewhere between five and six hours. Brandt testified at Reyes\u2019s preliminary hearing that he picked up Reyes at approximately 9:00 am to drive him to the San Bernardino sheriff\u2019s station. He estimated that Reyes then spent about three hours at that station, including both his polygraph test with Heard and his post-polygraph interview with Brandt and Medici. During the suppression hearing, the state represented that Reyes spent four hours at the San Bernardino sheriffs station. Brandt then drove Reyes to the Riverside police station for the second interview with Brandt and Medici. Brandt estimated that the second interview took between forty minutes and an hour. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Reyes had anything to eat until Medici took him to McDonald\u2019s for a late lunch at the conclusion of the interview at the Riverside police station.\nII. Prior Judicial Proceedings\nReyes and his cousin Andres Munoz were charged in California Superior Court with first-degree murder. They were tried before the same judge with separate juries. Reyes moved to suppress his confession as having been obtained in violation of Miranda. The judge concluded that Reyes\u2019s February 10 post-polygraph confession at the San Bernardino sheriffs station was voluntary but that he had been in custody within the meaning of Miranda when he made the statement. The judge therefore suppressed the unwarned post-polygraph statement at the sheriffs station due to a Miranda violation. However, the judge refused to suppress Reyes\u2019s postwarning confession at the Riverside police station.\nAt trial, there was inconsistent evidence about the identity of the shooter. Except for Reyes\u2019s postwarning confession, the evidence largely pointed to Reyes\u2019s cousin, Munoz, who had been the driver of the car, rather than Reyes, who had been a passenger.\nA friend of both Ochoa and Reyes testified that Reyes had been in the back seat, on the passenger side, of a silver ear on the afternoon of the shooting. An eyewitness to the shooting testified that she saw the driver of a silver Camry get out of the car and shoot Ochoa. She made an in-court identification of the driver as Munoz. Another eyewitness agreed with this account. She testified that the driver got out of the car, walked toward Ochoa, shot Ochoa, and \u201ccontinue[d] shooting until he couldn\u2019t anymore.\u201d She testified that the back door on the driver\u2019s side was opened, but that no one got out of the back seat. She was *1023unable to identify the shooter, either when shown photographs shortly after the shooting, or in the courtroom. .\nAnother witness testified that he heard gunshots as he was pulling out of his father\u2019s driveway. He pulled back into the driveway and got out of the car to look. He testified that he saw someone get out of the back seat on the passenger side and come around to the -driver\u2019s side. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he actually went to check on the kid [who had been shot] or ... what else happened.... [I]t just happened so quick.\u201d He estimated that the time between the shots being fired and the person getting out of the back passenger seat \u201cwasn\u2019t long\u201d \u2014 \u201c[m]aybe a couple of seconds.\u201d Yet another witness, a friend of Ochoa\u2019s, testified that he was on the front porch of a friend\u2019s house when he heard shots. His view was obscured by cacti, so he \u201cstarted walking toward the front yard.\u201d \u201cWe were going towards [Ochoa], and that\u2019s when we saw the guy shooting at him. But I only saw when he just went inside the car, like turned around inside the car and yelled out \u2018Delhi.\u2019 \u201d He testified that there were five people in the car and that it was \u201clight brown.\u201d He testified that he saw only one person get into the car, and that this person got into the back seat on the driver\u2019s side.\nThe jury returned a verdict finding Reyes guilty of first-degree murder with gang and firearm enhancements. The judge sentenced Reyes to fifty years to life in prison: twenty-five years to life for the murder conviction to be served consecutively with a twenty-five years to life sentence for the firearm enhancement. The court stayed sentencing on the two gang enhancements.\nReyes appealed. Citing Seibert, Reyes claimed, inter alia, that the trial court had erred in admitting his February 10 confession at the Riverside police station, after he had received Miranda warnings. The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge\u2019s suppression of Reyes\u2019s unwarned post-polygraph statement at the San Ber-nardino sheriffs office. The court wrote that it was \u201cnot disputed\u201d that Reyes was in custody at the time he made the statement, and that this statement was thus obtained in violation of Miranda. The Court of Appeal nonetheless affirmed Reyes\u2019s conviction, holding that his subsequent, warned confession at the Riverside police station was admissible.\nIn the view of the Court of Appeal, the \u201coperative question\u201d was whether Reyes\u2019s post-polygraph unwarned and custodial statement had been voluntary. The Court of Appeal wrote:\nThe issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in allowing defendant\u2019s subsequent statements made at the Riverside police station after defendant was advised of his Miranda rights. The operative question is thus whether defendant was subjected to coercion within the meaning of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments when he was interrogated at the sheriffs station and, if so, whether his statements made thereafter at the Riverside police station were the tainted product of the earlier statements.\nWe thus will consider whether the trial court erred in finding that defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary.\n(Emphasis added.)\nThe Court of Appeal then spent nine pages analyzing in detail what had taken place during the post-polygraph unwarned custodial interview at the police station, concluding that the \u201ctrial court had properly ruled defendant\u2019s statements, both at the sheriffs station and thereafter at the Riverside police station, were voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In the view of the Court of Appeal, because Reyes\u2019s unwarned statements while in custody at the *1024sheriffs station had been voluntary, his later postwarning statements at the police station were necessarily \u201clikewise volitional.\u201d The Court of Appeal dismissed Reyes\u2019s argument under Seibert in a single paragraph, on the ground that his statement at the Riverside police station had been \u201cvolitional\u201d:\nSince defendant\u2019s statements made at the sheriffs station were voluntary, his waiver of Miranda rights at the Riverside police station and statements made thereafter were likewise volitional. Unlike in Missouri v. Seibert[, 542 U.S. 600, 617, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004) ], the circumstances in the instant case need not \u201cbe seen as challenging the comprehensibility and efficacy of the Miranda warnings to the point that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes would not have understood them to convey a message that [he] retained a choice about continuing to talk.\u201d'\n(Second alteration in original.)\nReyes filed a state habeas petition contemporaneously with his direct appeal.' The Court of Appeal declined to consolidate the petition and the appeal, summarily denying the petition in a one-sentence order. The California Supreme Court summarily denied both Reyes\u2019s direct appeal and his habeas petition.\nReyes timely filed a petition for federal habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. In his Report and Recommendation, the magistrate judge devoted most of his analysis to whether Reyes\u2019s postwarning Riverside police station confession was coerced. He concluded under the deferential standard of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) that the Court of Appeal had not been unreasonable in concluding that the confession was not coerced. He dismissed Reyes\u2019s Seibert argument in a footnote, concluding that there - was no evidence that the law enforcement, officers deliberately employed the two-step method of interrogation condemned in that case. The district court adopted without comment or correction the conclusions and recommendations of the magistrate judge.\nReyes timely appealed. Prior to oral argument, we asked the parties to provide supplemental briefs on Seibert and its application to the facts of this case.\nIII. Standard of Review\nWe review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny Reyes\u2019s habeas petition. Martinez-Villareal v. Lewis, 80 F.3d 1301, 1305 (9th Cir. 1996).\nUnder AEDPA, we may not grant an application for a writ of habeas corpus for a state prisoner with respect to any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d id. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). \u201c[C]learly established Federal law\u201d includes only governing legal principles established by the United States Supreme Court at the time the state decision was rendered. Greene v. Fisher, \u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 38, 44, 181 L.Ed.2d 336 (2011).\nA state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law if it applies a rule that contradicts governing Supreme Court precedent or it decides a case differ1 ently than the Supreme Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405-07, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court decision is an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law \u201cif the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule ... but unrea*1025sonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d White v. Woodall, \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1697, 1705, 188 L.Ed.2d 698 (2014) (quoting Williams, 529 U.S. at 407-08, 120 S.Ct. 1495).\n\u201cA state-court decision will certainly be contrary to ... clearly established precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in '[Supreme Court] cases.\u201d Williams, 529 U.S. at 405, 120 S.Ct. 1495; see also Early v. Packer, 537 U.S. 3, 8, 123 S.Ct. 362, 154 L.Ed.2d 263 (2002) (per curiam) (\u201cAvoiding [a \u2018contrary to\u2019 error] does not require citation of [Supreme Court] cases \u2014 indeed, it does not even require awareness of [Supreme Court] cases, so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the state-court decision contradicts them.\u201d); Frantz v. Hazey, 533 F.3d 724, 734 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (\u201c[Mistakes in reasoning or in predicate decisions of the type in question here \u2014 use of the wrong legal rule or framework \u2014 do constitute error under the \u2018contrary to\u2019 prong of \u00a7 2254(d)(1).\u201d). If a state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1), a federal habeas court does not owe deference under AEDPA to that decision. Frantz, 533 F.3d at 739; cf. Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 948, 127 S.Ct. 2842, 168 L.Ed.2d 662 (2007) (stating this rule for \u201cunreasonable application\u201d error). If a \u201ccontrary to\u201d error is identified, then \u201cwe must decide the habeas petition by considering de novo the constitutional issues raised.\u201d Frantz, 533 F.3d at 735.\nWe may also grant a writ of habeas corpus in cases where the state-court decision \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). We \u201cmay not second-guess a state court\u2019s fact-finding process unless, after review of the state-court record, [we] determine[ ] that the state court was not merely wrong, but actually unreasonable.\u201d Taylor v. Maddox, 366 F.3d 992, 999 (9th Cir. 2004). To grant relief under this prong, \u201cwe must be convinced that an appellate panel, applying the normal standards of appellate review, could not reasonably conclude that the finding is supported by the record.\u201d Id. at 1000.\nThe relevant state court decision for purposes of AEDPA review is the last reasoned state court decision. Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U.S. 797, 804-06, 111 S.Ct. 2590, 115 L.Ed.2d 706 (1991); Medley v. Runnels, 506 F.3d 857, 862 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc). Here, that decision is the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision on direct review of Reyes\u2019s conviction. See Nunnemaker, 501 U.S. at 805-06, 111 S.Ct. 2590.\nIV. Discussion\nReyes makes two arguments. First, he argues that his postwarning Riverside police station confession on February 10 was coerced in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Second, he argues that this confession was admitted in violation of Seibert. For the reasons that follow, we agree with Reyes\u2019s second argument. We therefore do not need to reach his first argument.\nA. \u201cContrary To\u201d\nAs the Supreme Court explained in Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 304, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985), \u201c[p]rior to Miranda, the admissibility of an accused\u2019s in-custody statements was judged solely by whether they were \u2018voluntary\u2019 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.\u201d That is, the pre-Miranda exclusionary rule analysis was simply a Due Process Clause voluntariness inquiry. Miranda fundamentally altered the analysis: \u201cThe Miranda Court ... presumed that interrogation in certain custodial circumstances is inherent*1026ly coercive and held that statements made under those circumstances are inadmissible unless the suspect is specifically informed of his Miranda rights and freely decides to forgo those rights.\u201d New York v. Quarles, 467 U.S. 649, 654, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984) (footnote omitted). The Court was concerned in Miranda that its \u201c \u2018traditional totality-of-the-circumstances\u2019 test posed an \u2018unacceptably great\u2019 risk that involuntary custodial confessions would escape detection.\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at 608, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (quoting Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 444, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000)). The Court therefore held in Miranda that finding a statement had been \u201cvoluntary\u201d would no longer be sufficient. The Court explained, \u201cFailure to administer Miranda warnings creates a presumption of compulsion. Consequently, unwarned statements that are otherwise voluntary within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment must nevertheless be excluded from evidence under Miranda.\u201d Elstad, 470 U.S. at 307, 105 S.Ct. 1285 (emphasis added). Miranda and later cases thus clearly establish that the voluntariness of an unwarned statement during a custodial interrogation is not sufficient to establish the statement\u2019s admissibility.\nMiranda was decided in 1966. By the time the Court decided Seibert in 2004, \u201cMiranda warnings\u201d had taken on near-talismanic significance, almost guaranteeing admissibility of a warned statement. Justice Souter wrote in Seibert that \u201cgiving the warnings and getting a waiver has generally produced a virtual ticket of admissibility; maintaining that a statement is involuntary even though given after warnings and voluntary waiver of rights requires unusual stamina, and litigation over voluntariness tends to end with the finding of a valid waiver.\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at 608-09, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (Souter, J., plurality opinion). In Elstad, the Court had held that an unwarned voluntary custodial confession followed by a voluntary warned confession did not require the exclusion of the second, warned confession. But in Sei-bert, the Court limited its holding in El-stad. The Court in Seibert recognized that \u201c[t]he technique of interrogating in successive, unwarned and warned phases,\u201d was a \u201cnew challenge to Miranda\u201d that Elstad had not resolved. Id. at 609, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (Souter, J., plurality opinion); see also id. at 618, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment).\nIn Seibert, a police officer in Rolla, Missouri, conducted an unwarned custodial interrogation of Seibert that was \u201csystematic, exhaustive, and managed with psychological skill.\u201d Id. at 616, 124 S.Ct. 2601. The unwarned custodial interrogation produced a confession. The officer then gave Seibert a twenty-minute coffee and cigarette break. After the break, he read Sei-bert her Miranda warnings, and she signed a written waiver. The officer then resumed questioning, reminding Seibert of her prior prewarning statements. Id. at 605, 124 S.Ct. 2601. The officer later \u201ctestified that he made a \u2018conscious decision\u2019 to withhold Miranda warnings, thus resorting to an interrogation technique he had been taught: question first, then give the warnings, and then repeat the question \u2018until I get the answer that she\u2019s already provided once.\u2019\u201d Id. at 605-06, 124 S.Ct. 2601. The Seibert plurality wrote, with some understatement, that the use of this two-step interrogation technique \u201c[wa]s not confined to Rolla, Missouri.\u201d Id. at 609, 124 S.Ct. 2601. Indeed, as the plurality noted, its use had been promoted and endorsed by national police training organizations including the Police Law Institute. Id. at 609-10, 124 S.Ct. 2601.\nJustice Souter observed in his plurality opinion in Seibert that the purpose of the two-step interrogation technique was \u201cto *1027render Miranda warnings ineffective by waiting for a particularly opportune time to give them, after the suspect has already confessed.\u201d Id. at 611, 124 S.Ct. 2601. He concluded:\nIt would have been reasonable to regard the two sessions as parts of a continuum, in which it would have been unnatural to refuse to repeat at the second stage what had been said before. These circumstances must be seen as challenging the comprehensibility and efficacy of the Miranda warnings to the point that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes would not have understood them to convey a message that she retained a choice about continuing to talk.\nId. at 616-17, 124 S.Ct. 2601. In a footnote appended to this passage, Justice Souter made clear that if a two-step interrogation technique violated Miranda, the voluntariness of the postwarning statement is irrelevant. In that circumstance, even a voluntary postwarning statement must be suppressed. Justice Souter wrote, \u201cBecause we find that the. warnings were inadequate, there is no need to assess the actual voluntariness of the statement.\u201d Id. at 617 n.8, 124 S.Ct. 2601.\nConcurring, Justice Kennedy agreed with Justice Souter that, if deliberately employed, a two-part interrogation technique presented \u201cdifferent considerations\u201d from earlier Miranda cases. Id. at 620, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment). While Justice Kennedy\u2019s fifth-vote concurrence narrowed Seibert\u2019s holding to \u201cthose cases involving deliberate use of the two-step procedure to weaken Miranda\u2019s protections,\u201d United States v. Williams, 435 F.3d 1148, 1157-58 (9th Cir. 2006) (emphasis added), the plurality and Justice Kennedy agreed that even a voluntary postwarning confession must be excluded where law enforcement officials deliberately withheld Miranda warnings until after obtaining an in-custody confession, and where insufficient curative measures had been taken to ensure that the suspect understood the meaning and importance of the previously withheld warnings.\nJustice Kennedy wrote:\n- The plurality concludes that whenever a two-stage interview occurs, admissibility of the postwarning statement should depend on \u201cwhether [the] Miranda warnings delivered midstream could have been effective enough to accomplish their object\u201d given the specific facts of the case.... I would apply a narrower test applicable only in the infrequent case, such as we have here, in which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the Miranda warning.\nThe admissibility of postwarning statements should continue to be governed by the principles of Elstad unless the deliberate two-step strategy was employed. If the deliberate two-step strategy has been used, postwarning statements that are related to the substance of prewarning statements must be excluded unless curative measures are taken before the postwarning statement is made. Curative measures should be designed to ensure that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s situation would understand the import and effect of the Miranda warning and of the Miranda waiver. For example, a substantial break in time and circumstances between the prewarning statement and the Miranda warning may suffice in most circumstances, as it allows the accused to distinguish the two contexts and appreciate that the interrogation has taken a new turn. Alternatively, an additional warning that explains the likely inadmissibility of the prewarning custodial statement may be sufficient.\n*1028Id. at 621-22, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (internal citations omitted).\nWe take as \u201cclearly established\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2254 the \u201cnarrowest\u201d opinion in a fractured majority. See Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977); see also Panetti, 551 U.S. at 949, 127 S.Ct. 2842. In United States v. Davis, 825 F.3d 1014, 1020- (9th Cir.2016) (en banc), we interpreted Marks as requiring us to analyze \u201cwhether the reasoning of a narrower opinion fit[s] entirely into the circle drawn by a broader opinion.\u201d Stated differently, a fractured Supreme Court opinion binds us \u201conly ... when a majority of the Justices agree upon a single underlying rationale and one opinion can reasonably be described as a logical subset of the other.\u201d Id.\nPreviously, in Williams, we applied Marks to hold that the rule established in Seibert is to be found by looking at Justice Souter\u2019s plurality opinion for four justices, together with Justice Kennedy\u2019s narrower concurring opinion. 435 F.3d at 1157. In Davis, we cited with approval our earlier opinion in Williams. Davis, 825 F.3d at 1020-21. Justice Souter\u2019s plurality opinion requires suppression only where officers employ a two-step technique that renders the Miranda warnings ineffective. His opinion does not require a deliberate intent 'to employ the forbidden two-step technique. Justice Kennedy largely agreed with the plurality, but wrote that he would add one criterion before finding a Seibert violation. Justice Kennedy wrote, \u201cIn my view, [the plurality\u2019s] test cuts too broadly.... I would apply a narrower test[.]\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at 622, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment). In Justice Kennedy\u2019s view, an interrogating officer not only must employ the two-step technique condemned by the plurality; he or she must also do so \u201cdeliberately.\u201d Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence, based on a rationale narrowing the result reached by the plurality in Seibert, thus constitutes \u201cclearly established\u201d law for the purpose of AEDPA review.\nUnder Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence, a postwarning statement must be suppressed if interrogating officers deliberately use the two-step interrogation technique that was used in Seibert, and if effective curative measures are not taken to ensure that the suspect genuinely understood the Miranda warnings. In the words of Justice Kennedy, quoted above, \u201c[cjurative measures should be designed to ensure that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s situation would understand the import and effect of the Miranda warning and of the Miranda waiver.\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at 622, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment).\nThe California Court of Appeal did not understand Seibert. In the view of the Court of Appeal, the \u201coperative question\u201d under Miranda was whether Reyes\u2019s unwarned post-polygraph custodial statement at the San Bernardino sheriffs station had been voluntary. According to the Court of Appeal, if that statement had been voluntary, his later Mirandized statement at the San Bernardino police station was necessarily \u201clik\u00e9wise volitional.\u201d The Court of Appeal spent nine pages addressing the voluntariness of Reyes\u2019s unwarned post-polygraph custodial statement at the San Bernardino sheriffs station. For the Court of Appeal, the voluntariness of that statement determined the admissibility of the subsequent warned statement at the Riverside police station. The Court of Appeal addressed Seibert in a single paragraph.\nWe quoted that paragraph above, but we reproduce it here, in its entirety, for the convenience of the reader:\nSince defendant\u2019s statements made at the sheriffs station were voluntary, his waiver of Miranda rights at the Riverside police station and statements made *1029thereafter were likewise volitional. Unlike in Missouri v. Seibert[, 542 U.S. 600, 617, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004) ], the circumstances in the instant case need not \u201cbe seen as challenging the comprehensibility and efficacy of the Miranda warnings to the point that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes would not have understood them to convey a message that [he] retained a choice about continuing to talk.\u201d\n(Alteration in original.) The first sentence of the paragraph recites the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that Reyes\u2019s postwarning statement was \u201cvolitional.\u201d The second sentence states that, unlike in Seibert, Reyes \u201cretained a choice about continuing to talk.\u201d That is, in the Court of Appeal\u2019s view, because Reyes \u201cretained a choice,\u201d his \u201ccontinuing to talk\u201d was voluntary.\nThe clearly established rule under Sei-bert is that if officers deliberately employ the two-step technique employed in Sei-bert, and if insufficient curative measures are taken to ensure that later Miranda warnings are genuinely understood, any warned statement thereby obtained must be suppressed, even if the statement is voluntary. Contrary to Seibert, the Court of Appeal did not address the question whether the officers deliberately employed the two-step technique. Also contrary to Seibert, the Court of Appeal did not address the adequacy, or even existence, of any \u201ccurative measures.\u201d Instead, the Court of Appeal analyzed at length the coerciveness surrounding Reyes\u2019s post-polygraph unwarned custodial statement at the San Bernardino sheriffs station and concluded that because his confession was voluntary his subsequent warned statement at the Riverside police station was also voluntary.\nUnder the circumstances of this case\u2014 where police interrogated fifteen-year-old Reyes over the course of two days; where on the first day at the Riverside police station they conducted a two-hour unwarned interrogation; where on the second day at the San Bernardino sheriffs station they obtained a confession during an unwarned interrogation following an unwarned custodial polygraph test; and where they transported Reyes back to the Riverside police station and obtained a postwarning confession \u201cclarifying\u201d what he had stated at the sheriffs station- \u2014 a Seibert analysis was clearly required.\nContrary to Seibert, the Court of Appeal did not conduct such an analysis. Instead, the Court of Appeal examined only whether Reyes\u2019s statement in his post-polygraph custodial interrogation was voluntary. It wrote, as a prelude to its analysis, that the \u201coperative question\u201d was voluntariness: \u201cWe thus will consider whether the trial court erred in finding that defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary.\u201d Upon determining that Reyes\u2019s unwarned statements were voluntary, the Court of Appeal concluded that Reyes\u2019s later warned statement at the Riverside police station was necessarily \u201clikewise volitional.\u201d The Court of Appeal then affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision not to suppress Reyes\u2019s postwarn-ing statement. The Court of Appeal thus addressed, and treated as dispositive, the question whether Reyes\u2019s postwarning statement was voluntary, which is precisely the question that is irrelevant under Seibert.\nWe therefore conclude that the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to ... clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Because its decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d Seibert, we owe it no deference.\nOn habeas review, the federal magistrate judge recommended denying relief, rejecting in a footnote Reyes\u2019s argument under Seibert. The magistrate judge correctly understood the rule in Seibert but concluded without analysis of the evidence *1030that the law enforcement officers in this case had not deliberately employed the two-step interrogation process. Deliberateness is a factual finding that we review for clear error. United States v. Narvaez-Gomez, 489 F.3d 970, 974 (9th Cir. 2007); McClure v. Thompson, 323 F.3d 1233, 1240 (9th Cir. 2003) (applying clear error review to findings of fact made by a district court on AEDPA review). Clear error review requires us to form a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234, 242, 121 S.Ct. 1452, 149 L.Ed.2d 430 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). A more searching review is appropriate where the trial court\u2019s decision was based on documents, as it was here, rather than credibility evaluations. See id. at 243, 121 S.Ct. 1452 (\u201c[T]he key evidence consisted primarily of documents and expert testimony. Credibility determinations played a minor role. Accordingly, we find that an extensive review of the District Court\u2019s findings, for clear error, is warranted.\u201d); Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 500-01, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984) (\u201cThe same \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard applies to findings based on documentary evidence as to those based entirely on oral testimony, but the presumption has lesser force in the former situation than in the latter.\u201d (internal citation omitted)).\nWe conclude that the magistrate judge, and the district court in entering judgment based on the recommendation of the magistrate judge, clearly erred. We wrote in Williams that evidence' of deliberateness in a Seibert inquiry can be either objective or subjective. \u201c[I]n determining whether the interrogator deliberately withheld the Miranda warning, courts should consider whether objective evidence and any available subjective evidence, such as an officer\u2019s testimony, support an inference that the two-step interrogation procedure was used to undermine the Miranda warning.\u201d 435 F.3d at 1158. The absence of direct evidence of subjective intent is not dispositive. United States v. Capers, 627 F.3d 470, 479 (2d Cir. 2010). As we have recognized, \u201cthe most plausible reason\u201d for delaying Miranda warnings until after a suspect has confessed \u201cis an illegitimate one, which is the interrogator\u2019s desire to weaken the warning\u2019s effectiveness,\u201d see Williams, 435 F.3d at 1159, and \u201cthe intent of the officer will rarely be as candidly admitted as it was [in Seibert].\u201d Id. at 1158 (quoting Seibert, 542 U.S. at 617 n.6, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (Souter, J., plurality opinion)).\nIn Williams, we provided a nonexhaustive list of probative objective evidence of deliberateness. Such evidence includes \u201cthe timing, setting and completeness of the prewarning interrogation, the continuity of police personnel and the overlapping content of the pre- and postwarning statements.\u201d Id. at 1159; see also United States v. Barnes, 713 F.3d 1200, 1205 (9th Cir. 2013) (per curiam) (examining the record for objective evidence under Seibert); Capers, 627 F.3d at 479 (\u201c[W]e join our sister circuits in concluding that a court should review the totality of the objective and subjective evidence surrounding the interrogations in order to determine deliberateness, with a recognition that in most instances the inquiry will rely heavily, if not entirely, upon objective evidence.\u201d); United States v. Nunez-Sanchez, 478 F.3d 663, 668-69 (5th Cir. 2007) (examining the totality of the circumstances to infer deliberateness); United States v. Street, 472 F.3d 1298, 1314 (11th Cir. 2006) (holding that the deliberateness determination requires an evaluation of \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including \u2018the timing, setting and completeness of the prewarning interrogation, the continuity of police personnel and the overlapping content of the pre- and post-warning statements\u2019\u201d (quoting Williams, 435 F.3d at 1159)); United *1031States v. Briones, 390 F.3d 610, 614 (8th Cir. 2004).\nBased on the objective evidence in this case, we conclude that Brandt and his fellow officers deliberately employed the two-step interrogation technique condemned in Seibert, and that the magistrate judge and the district court clearly erred in concluding otherwise. Reyes first confessed in the unwarned custodial interrogation conducted by Brandt and Medici at the San Bernardino sheriff\u2019s station on February 10, after Heard told Reyes that he had failed the polygraph test. The California Court of Appeal wrote that it is \u201cnot disputed\u201d that Reyes was in custody during this interrogation. Because the interrogation was custodial, both the trial judge and California Court of Appeal concluded that this unwarned confession at the San Bernardino sheriffs station was obtained in violation of Miranda. This unwarned interrogation, as well as the unwarned interrogation the previous day at the Riverside police station, were, like the interrogation in Seibert, \u201csystematic, exhaustive, and managed with psychological skill.\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at 616, 124 S.Ct. 2601.\nIn the unwarned custodial interrogation at the San Bernardino sheriffs station, Brandt and Medici obtained statements from Reyes admitting that he shot Ochoa; providing the outline of the events that occurred that afternoon; providing information about how Reyes obtained the gun used in the shooting and what happened to it afterward; and providing details about the shooting. In the warned interrogation at the Riverside police station that followed, Reyes provided essentially the same information.\nThe three Riverside police officers involved in the case \u2014 Brandt, Wheeler and Medici \u2014 were all experienced officers. Cf. Capers, 627 F.3d at 481 (\u201cInexperience, while not a legitimate excuse for postponing a Miranda warning, nevertheless may save a confession from exclusion under Seibert.\u201d). All three were homicide detectives. At the time of the interrogations, Brandt had been a police officer in California for twelve years and a homicide detective for the last four. The tenure of Wheeler and Medici is not specified in the record, but we may infer from their ranks that they both had substantial experience.\nBrandt did not take \u201ccurative measures\u201d to ensure that Reyes understood \u201cthe import and effect of the Miranda warning and of the Miranda waiver.\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at 622, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment). Indeed, he did quite the opposite. Brandt was the lead investigator. He was involved in the case from beginning to end. Brandt asked .Reyes to accompany him to the Riverside police station on the morning of February 9 after the SWAT team had entered Reyes\u2019s aunt\u2019s house and placed him in handcuffs. Brandt and Wheeler questioned Reyes at the police station for about two hours that day. During that interview, Brandt asked Reyes if he would be willing to take a polygraph examination. Brandt picked Reyes up at his mother\u2019s house the next morning and took him to the San Bernardino sheriffs station for the examination. After Heard told Reyes that he had failed the polygraph examination, Brandt and Medici came into the room and took over from Heard. During the unwarned\u2019 custodial interview at the San Bernardino sheriffs station on February 10, Brandt and Medici obtained a detailed confession from Reyes. After obtaining the confession, Brandt immediately drove Reyes directly to the Riverside police station, where he and Wheeler had questioned him the day before. On arrival at the Riverside station, Brandt and Medici questioned Reyes again. At the beginning of this interview, Brandt finally provided Miranda warnings. During this interview, Reyes *1032gave Brandt and Medici the same detailed confessions he had just given.\nBrandt and Medici had obtained the incriminating information from Reyes very early in the unwarned custodial interrogation at the sheriffs station, on the seventh page of the transcript. Yet they continued questioning and talking to Reyes for another thirty-five pages. They did so in a noneonfrontational, sympathetic way, with the result that Reyes was made to feel sufficiently comfortable that he talked about his family\u2019s Christmas rituals and laughed when Brandt said he could not stay up late enough to open presents. At the end of the session, Reyes even asked Brandt and Medici not to tell his mother what he had confessed to them: \u201cIt\u2019ll be cool like if you guys don\u2019t tell my Mom.\u201d\nAt the beginning of the follow-up questioning at the Riverside police station, Brandt gave Reyes the Miranda warnings, as recounted above. But, as is evident from the transcript, he played down their importance. He said he wanted \u201cjust to clarify stuff,\u201d suggesting by his use of the word \u201cclarify\u201d that the \u201cstuff\u2019 had already been conveyed in the earlier interview, and that the only purpose of the later interview was clarification. Brandt then said he wanted to \u201cread you your rights\u201d because \u201cyou\u2019ve been sitting in that room and the door was locked and you\u2019re not free to leave.\u201d An experienced officer in Brandt\u2019s position would have known that to a reasonable person not trained in the law, let alone a fifteen-year-old high school freshman, these stated reasons were hardly an effective means of conveying the fact that the warning he was about to give could mean the difference between serving life in prison and going home that night.\nAfter Brandt read the Miranda warnings, he said, \u201cDo you understand each of these rights that I\u2019ve explained to you? Yeah? OK. Can we talk about the stuff we talked about earlier today? Is that a yes?\u201d While giving the Miranda warnings, Brandt did not pause to ask \u201cIs that a yes?\u201d after asking if Reyes understood \u201ceach of the rights\u201d listed. Only after the Miranda warnings had been completed and after Brandt asked whether \u201cwe [can] talk about the stuff we talked about earlier today\u201d did Brandt finally ask \u201cIs that a yes?\u201d and wait for a response. In contrast to the interrogation in Seibert, Brandt did not ask Reyes for a signed waiver of rights or a signed acknowledgment of having read and understood the Miranda warnings.\nThe psychological, spatial, and temporal break between the unwarned and warned interrogations was not enough to cure the Miranda violation. Perhaps most important, Brandt had been a continuous presence throughout. He and Wheeler were the two questioners in the unwarned interrogation on February 9; he was the primary questioner in both the unwarned and warned interrogations on February 10; and he had personally driven Reyes on February 9 and 10, including the short trip between the sheriffs station and the police station on February 10. Further, although the unwarned custodial interrogation on February 10 took place at the San Bernar-dino sheriffs station and the warned interrogation took place at the Riverside police station later that day, the warned interrogation was conducted in a familiar place where Reyes had been questioned by Brandt the day before. The record does not tell us the driving distance and time between the sheriffs station and the Riverside police station, but a map of the area indicates that it was no more than fifteen miles. The timeline for the events on February 10, described above, indicated that the driving time was not likely to have been more than about thirty minutes. This case is quite unlike Bobby v. Dixon, \u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 26, 32, 181 L.Ed.2d 328 (2011) (per curiam), in which there was *1033a four-hour gap, during which the defendant was transported from, the police station to a separate jail and back, and during which the defendant spoke with his lawyer and learned material facts about the ongoing investigation. See also Capers, 627 F.3d at 484 (holding that a ninety-minute break in time between interrogations was not curative in part because police personnel were consistent and \u201cboth [interrogations] occurred while Capers remained in handcuffs and in settings that clearly established the authoritative nature of the questioning\u201d).\nB. \u201cUnreasonable Determination of the Facts\u201d\nOur concurring colleague reads the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision as understanding and applying Seibert. In his view, the Court of Appeal\u2019s quotation from Justice Souter\u2019s plurality opinion (in the paragraph we quoted above) shows that it understood Seibert, and that the Court of Appeal viewed the question before it to be whether Brandt and his fellow officers took sufficient curative measures to ensure that the Miranda warnings given at the Riverside police station were effective. But our colleague nonetheless agrees with the result we reach in this case. In his view, even under AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard, we must grant habeas relief because the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that sufficient curative measures were taken is an \u201cunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). See Concurrence at 1035-86.\nFor the reasons given above, we disagree with our concurring colleague on the question whether, the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d Seibert. However, we note that, although we do not need to reach the question whether the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision rests on an \u201cunreasonable determination of the facts,\u201d we entirely agree with him on that question. It is readily apparent, on the factual record of this case, that Brandt and the others were experienced officers who acted carefully and deliberately in performing their two-step interrogation, and further, that they did not take \u201ccurative measures\u201d that would \u201censure that a reasonable person in [Reyes\u2019s] situation would understand the import and effect of the Miranda warning and of the Miranda waiver.\u201d 542 U.S. at 622, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment). Ihdeed, as described above, far from taking \u201ccurative measures,\u201d they took affirmative steps to ensure that Reyes did not \u201cunderstand the import and effect\u201d of the Miranda warnings he was finally given at the Riverside police station.\nConclusion\nThe California Court of Appeal applied a rule that was contrary to federal law as clearly established by the Supreme Court in Seibert when it concluded that Reyes\u2019s postwarning confession was admissible solely on the ground that his unwarned custodial statement was voluntary, and that his subsequent warned statement therefore was also necessarily voluntary. We hold that police officers deliberately employed a two-step interrogation technique, and that they did not take appropriate \u201ccurative measures,\u201d in violation of Seibert. We therefore hold that Reyes\u2019s postwarning confession should have been suppressed. Because the state did not argue harmless error in this court or the district court, that defense is waived. See United States v. Vallejo, 237 F.3d 1008, 1026 (9th Cir. 2001). Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Reyes\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus and remand with instructions to grant the writ unless Reyes is retried within a reasonable time, not to exceed 180 days.\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n.

            "opinion_text": "\n*1034SINGLETON, Senior\nDistrict Judge, concurring:\nThe majority has joined in a thoughtful and thorough judgment in this case. I concur in that judgment. The majority has forcefully marshaled the facts and analyzed the applicable law. If this case had arisen entirely within the federal system, e.g., under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, I would fully join in the opinion and have no further comments or suggestions.\nThis case does not arise entirely within the federal system, however, but comes to us from state court under \u00a7 2254, and thus our review must be guided by the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). AEDPA requires us to give deference to decisions of the state courts both as to the facts and the law, except in limited circumstances.\nThe majority identifies Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004), as clearly established federal law at the time the California Court of Appeal decided this case and looks to Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion to provide the appropriate rule of decision. I agree. See United States v. Williams, 435 F.3d 1148, 1157-59 (9th Cir. 2006) (analyzing Seibert and concluding that Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion is the narrowest holding obtaining five votes). In the majority\u2019s view, the California Court of Appeal recognized Seibert as controlling but unreasonably interpreted it, effectively ignoring Seibert and deciding the case under the prior law set out in Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985). The majority concludes that, since the California court failed to apply clearly established law, we may withhold any deference and exercise our independent judgment in reviewing the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision de novo.\nI disagree. My review of the record leads me to conclude that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusions of law are in conformity with Seibert and Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence. In my view, the state court\u2019s approach to the law is sound, but its finding of facts are unreasonable in context. I therefore, on this alternate ground, join in this Court\u2019s judgment. My reasons are as follows.\nIn reaching a contrary view, the majority focuses exclusively on one part of Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence. Seibert addresses what we have termed a two-step interrogation leading to a confession. The first part of the interrogation is unwarned. Once the suspect confesses, Miranda warnings are given, and the interrogation resumes. Typically, the suspect confirms his confession. In practice, the earlier confession is suppressed, but following Elstad, the subsequent post-warning statement is allowed into evidence if it is voluntary. Seibert modified Elstad in cases such as this. The opinion was fragmented. Justice Souter wrote an opinion for a plurality of four justices. Justice Kennedy separately concurred, arguably on a more limited basis, and Justice O\u2019Connor wrote a dissent in which three other justices joined. The majority and I agree that Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion provides the holding of Sei-bert. We disagree on how Seibert should be applied to this case.\nIn my view, Justice Kennedy adopts all of Justice Souter\u2019s plurality opinion but imposes a limitation. Rightly understood, Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion adopts a two-part test for determining the validity of a confession where the police use a two-step approach in their interrogation of a suspect. The first prong, which I will call the Kennedy prong, asks whether the two-step procedure was chosen intentionally in order to render subsequent Miranda warnings ineffective. The second prong, which I *1035will call the Souter prong, asks if the two-step process, whether or not intentional, rendered the subsequent warnings ineffective. For Justice Kennedy, both prongs must be satisfied in order to create a Seibert violation and take the case out of Oregon v. Elstad. Since the test has two prongsi it is analogous to the Strickland test for determining ineffective assistance of counsel.1 Like that test, a reviewing court should be able to look to either prong first, and, if that prong is not satisfied, there is no need to address the other prong. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 241, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009). Viewed in this fight, the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision is within the law. That court quoted Justice Souter directly for the second prong of the test and concluded that nothing in the record of the interrogation \u201cchallenged the comprehensibility and efficacy of the Miranda warnings to the point that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes would not have understood them to convey a message that [he] retained a choice about continuing to talk.\u201d\nJustice Kennedy\u2019s test requires that any two-step procedure must be intentionally motivated to undermine Miranda. Justice Souter rejects reference to the police intent and focuses only on whether the process itself challenged the comprehensibility and effectiveness of the Miranda warnings. Thus, if as the California Court of Appeal found, Reyes understood at the time of the second stage of the interview that he retained a choice about whether to talk, his decision to talk was consistent with Seibert, and there was no need for the Court of Appeal to address the first prong of the test and determine whether the police intended to nullify the Miranda warnings.\nThe Court of Appeal did not separately address the first prong of the test, and so by analogy to Strickland, we may review that prong de novo and exercise independent judgment.2 See Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 39, 130 S.Ct. 447, 175 L.Ed.2d 398 (2009); Mann v. Ryan, 774 F.3d 1203, 1215 (9th Cir. 2014) (\u201cBecause the state post-conviction court did not reach the deficiency prong of the Strickland analysis, our review of this prong is not circumscribed by AEDPA.\u201d). I agree with the majority that, under the facts of this case, the use of the two-step procedure was a conscious effort to undermine Miranda. See Williams, 435 F.3d at 1158-60 (discussing how a court should determine whether an interrogation was deliberately used to undermine Miranda).\nThe second prong of the test was addressed by the Court of Appeal, and we must grant deference and may only reject the finding if it was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in fight of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (d)(2).\nThe majority points out that the Court of Appeal did not explain its factual finding that the mid-stream Miranda warning was *1036not undermined by the interrogation procedure chosen by the police. In such a case, we must look to all of the relevant evidence to determine if the fact finding is reasonably supported. See Delgado v. Lewis, 223 F.3d 976, 982 (9th Cir. 2000) (\u201cFederal habeas review is not de novo when the state court does not supply reasoning for its decision, but an independent review of the record is required to determine whether the state court clearly erred in its application of controlling federal law.\u201d). Reyes has a heavy burden to establish that a state court fact finding is unreasonable. See Burt v. Titlow, \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 10, 15-16, 187 L.Ed.2d 348 (2013). I am satisfied that he has sustained that burden here.\nThe majority has summarized all of the relevant evidence, and it need not be repeated here. Guided by Williams regarding a determination of the effectiveness of mid-stream Miranda warnings, see Williams, 435 F.3d at 1160-62, I do not believe that there is substantial evidence that would support an inference that the warnings given to Reyes were effective at the time they were given. There is no evidence of the corrective measures identified by Justice Kennedy. Turning to the factors considered relevant by the plurality: 1) the pre-warning interrogation was complete and detailed, consuming many hours; 2) the two rounds of interrogation overlapped; 3) the two rounds of interrogation were close in time; 4) there was a continuity of police personnel; and, most importantly, 5) the interrogator\u2019s questions treated the second round of interrogation as continuous with the first.\nViewed in light of the totality of the circumstances, there is no evidence that would permit a finding that the two-step interrogation in this case did not undermine Miranda and lead to an involuntary confession.\n\n. It is clear that the Court of Appeal did not think that the procedure .followed undermined the effectiveness of the mid-stream Miranda warnings. It is not clear that the Court of Appeal considered whether the procedure was chosen to undermine Miranda. Even if I were to assume that the Court of Appeal found no intent, sub silentio, requiring deference I would still conclude under Williams that the procedure was chosen intentionally. See Williams, 435 F.3d at 1160 (discussing how to prove a deliberate choice of procedure).\n\n",

Seibert, 542 U.S. 600\n(2004).\n\n    The panel held that Justice Kennedy\u2019s Seibert\nconcurrence, based on a rationale narrowing the result\nreached by the Seibert plurality, constitutes \u201cclearly\nestablished\u201d Supreme Court law for the purpose of AEDPA\nreview. Under this concurrence, a post-Miranda-warning\nstatement must be suppressed if interrogating officers\ndeliberately use the two-step interrogation technique that was\nused in Seibert, and if effective curative measures are not\ntaken to ensure that the suspect genuinely understood the\nMiranda warnings. The two-step technique involves\ninterrogating in successive, unwarned and warned phases.\n\n    The panel held that under the circumstances of this\ncase\u00afwhere police interrogated the fifteen-year-old\npetitioner over the course of two days; where on the first day\nat a police station they conducted a two-hour unwarned\ninterrogation; where on the second day at a sheriff\u2019s station\nthey obtained a confession during an unwarned interrogation\n\n  **\n     This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\f4                      REYES V. LEWIS\n\nfollowing an unwarned polygraph test; and where they\ntransported the petitioner back to the police station and\nobtained a postwarning confession \u201cclarifying\u201d what he had\nstated at the sheriff\u2019s station\u00afa Seibert analysis was clearly\nrequired.\n\n    The panel held that the California Court of Appeal\napplied a rule that was contrary to federal law as clearly\nestablished by the Supreme Court in Seibert, and thus was\nowed no deference, when it concluded that the petitioner\u2019s\npostwarning confession was admissible solely on the ground\nthat his unwarned custodial statement was voluntary, and that\nhis subsequent warned statement therefore was also\nnecessarily voluntary.\n\n    The panel held that police officers deliberately employed\na two-step interrogation technique, and that they did not take\nappropriate \u201ccurative measures,\u201d in violation of Seibert. The\npanel therefore held that the petitioner\u2019s postwarning\nconfession should have been suppressed.\n\n    The panel remanded with instructions to grant the writ\nunless the petitioner is tried within a reasonable time, not to\nexceed 180 days.\n\n    Concurring, District Judge Singleton wrote that the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusions of law are in\nconformity with Seibert and Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence,\nbut its findings of fact are unreasonable in context.\n\n    Concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc, Judge W.\nFletcher, joined by Judge Bybee, made four points in\nresponse to Judge Callahan\u2019s dissent from the denial of the\npetition for rehearing en banc.\n\f                      REYES V.

Davis, 2016 WL\n3245043 (9th Cir.

LEWIS\n\n                           ORDER\n\n   The opinion filed August 14, 2015, and reported at\n798 F.3d 815, is hereby amended, and is replaced by the\nAmended Opinion attached hereto.\n\n   A judge requested a vote on whether to rehear the case en\nbanc. The case failed to receive a majority of the votes of the\nnon-recused active judges in favor of en banc consideration.\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 35.\n\n    Future petitions for panel rehearing or rehearing en banc\nwill not be entertained.\n\n\n\nW. FLETCHER, concurring in the denial of rehearing en\nbanc, joined by Judge BYBEE. Judge Singleton may not vote\non petitions for rehearing en banc, but he agrees with what is\nwritten here.\n\n    We make four points in response to Judge Callahan\u2019s\ndissent from the denial of the petition for rehearing en banc.\n\n    First, the dissent begins:\n\n            Fifteen-year-old Adrian Reyes confessed\n        to killing sixteen-year-old Derek Ochoa in a\n        drive-by shooting. He first confessed after\n        acknowledging many times that he was not\n        under arrest and was not required to talk,\n        freely leaving two previous police interviews,\n        taking a polygraph that he and his parents not\n        only consented to but that Reyes initially\n\f                      REYES V. LEWIS                       7\n\n       suggested, and then asking to speak with\n       detectives. After Reyes confessed, those\n       detectives drove him to another location\n       where they told him that he was no longer free\n       to leave and read him his Miranda rights. He\n       again confessed.\n\nDissent at 10.\n\n    An unsuspecting reader might conclude that Reyes was\nnot in custody when he \u201cfirst confessed,\u201d and that his first\nconfession was therefore not taken in violation of Miranda.\nThe reader would be mistaken. The California Court of\nAppeal explicitly held to the contrary. It wrote:\n\n           It is not disputed that defendant was in\n       custody after completion of the polygraph\n       exam, when [polygraph examiner] Heard told\n       defendant he had failed the polygraph test and\n       had lied about his nonparticipation in the\n       murder. Because defendant was not advised\n       of his Miranda rights at this point, his\n       statements made thereafter, while at the\n       sheriff\u2019s station, were inadmissible under\n       Miranda v. Arizona[.]\n\nPeople v. Reyes, No. D047521, 2010 WL 3026227, at *7\n(Cal. Ct. App. Aug. 4, 2010).\n\n    Second, the dissent contends that Justice Kennedy\u2019s\nconcurrence in Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600 (2004), does\nnot provide the controlling test in two-step interrogation\ncases. We first concluded in 2006 that Justice Kennedy\u2019s\nconcurrence provides the controlling test. See United States\n\f8                      REYES V. LEWIS\n\nv. Williams, 435 F.3d 1148 (9th Cir. 2006). Of the seven\ncircuits that have addressed the issue, six agree with us. See\nUnited States v. Capers, 627 F.3d 470, 476 (2d Cir. 2010);\nUnited States v. Torres-Lona, 491 F.3d 750, 758 (8th Cir.\n2007); United States v. Street, 472 F.3d 1298, 1313 (11th Cir.\n2006); United States v. Courtney, 463 F.3d 333, 338 (5th Cir.\n2006); United States v. Kiam, 432 F.3d 524, 532 (3d Cir.\n2006); United States v. Mashburn, 406 F.3d 303, 309 (4th\nCir. 2005). The seventh concludes that Justice Souter\u2019s\nplurality controls. See United States v. Ray, 803 F.3d 244,\n272 (6th Cir. 2015). That conclusion cannot help the dissent\nbecause Justice Souter\u2019s test is less favorable to police\ninterrogators; an interrogation that fails Justice Kennedy\u2019s\ntest will necessarily fail Justice Souter\u2019s test. Three other\ncircuits have applied both Justice Kennedy and Justice\nSouter\u2019s tests without choosing between the two. See United\nStates v. Widi, 684 F.3d 216, 221 (1st Cir. 2012); United\nStates v. Lee, 618 F.3d 667, 678 (7th Cir. 2010); United\nStates v. Carrizales-Toledo, 454 F.3d 1142, 1151 (10th Cir.\n2006).\n\n    Third, the dissent contends that our opinion \u201cpermits\nfederal courts to read the worst into state court decisions on\nhabeas review,\u201d and that it \u201crequires all courts to presume the\nworst of police officers in applying Seibert.\u201d Dissent at 11.\nWe strongly disagree. We carefully provide AEDPA\ndeference to the decision of the California Court of Appeal,\nand our opinion presumes the contrary.\n\n    Two of us, Judges Fletcher and Bybee, conclude that the\nCourt of Appeal misunderstood both Miranda and Seibert,\nand that its decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d those cases, when it\ntested the validity of Reyes\u2019s confession based on whether it\nhad been voluntary. It has been clearly established Supreme\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                          9\n\nCourt law, ever since Miranda, that the test for admissibility\nof a confession is not whether it was voluntary. Rather, the\ntest is whether it was taken in violation of Miranda.\n\n    All three of us conclude that the Court of Appeal made an\n\u201cunreasonable determination of the facts\u201d in concluding that,\nin employing their two-step interrogation, the officers did not\ndeliberately undermine the effectiveness of the Miranda\nwarning that was eventually provided. We describe in\npainstaking detail every interaction between the officers and\nReyes. We unanimously conclude that a court cannot\nreasonably determine, based on the factual record, that the\nofficers did not deliberately undermine the effectiveness of\nthe Miranda warning.\n\n   Fourth, the dissent says that our decision \u201clet[s] a\nconfessed murderer walk.\u201d Dissent at 11. We are not as\nconfident as the dissent that Reyes is, in fact, a murderer.\nThere is reason to believe that fifteen-year-old Reyes\nconfessed to a crime he did not commit.\n\n    Except for Reyes\u2019s confession, the evidence at trial\npointed to Reyes\u2019s cousin, Munoz, as the shooter. It is\nundisputed that Reyes was a passenger in the back seat, and\nthat Munoz was the driver. Two witnesses testified that the\ndriver of the car shot the victim. One of those witnesses\nidentified Munoz as the driver and shooter. The other witness\ntestified that the driver was the shooter, but could not identify\nMunoz. Two other witnesses testified that they heard shots,\nbut did not see the shooting. None of the witnesses testified\nthat the shooter had been a passenger in the back seat.\n\n    Reyes did not want to snitch on his older cousin. During\nthe interrogation, Reyes said, \u201cWell, if I say something like\n\f10                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nwhat\u2019s going to happen with my cousin? Is he still gonna go\nto jail? . . . He had nothing to do with it.\u201d Further, Reyes may\nwell have thought that a confession would have limited\nadverse consequences for him. Before Reyes made his in-\ncustody confession, Officer Heard had told him, \u201c[Y]ou have\nmy word I won\u2019t trick you,\u201d and \u201cFifteen-year-olds don\u2019t go\nto state prison, Adrian.\u201d\n\n    In sum, our opinion gives full deference under AEDPA to\nthe decision of the California Court of Appeal. After careful\nconsideration of the entire record and of the decision of the\nCourt of Appeal, we conclude that the decision was \u201ccontrary\nto\u201d Seibert, and that it was based on an unreasonable factual\ndetermination that the interrogating officers did not\ndeliberately undermine the effectiveness of their belated\nMiranda warning.\n\n\n\nCALLAHAN, Circuit Judge, with whom, O\u2019SCANNLAIN,\nTALLMAN, BEA, and IKUTA, Circuit Judges, join,\ndissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:\n\n    Fifteen-year-old Adrian Reyes confessed to killing\nsixteen-year-old Derek Ochoa in a drive-by shooting. He first\nconfessed after acknowledging many times that he was not\nunder arrest and was not required to talk, freely leaving two\nprevious police interviews, taking a polygraph that he and his\nparents not only consented to but that Reyes initially\nsuggested, and then asking to speak with detectives. After\nReyes confessed, those detectives drove him to another\nlocation where they told him that he was no longer free to\nleave and read him his Miranda rights. He again confessed.\nA jury found Reyes guilty of first-degree murder. The state\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                       11\n\nappellate court affirmed, the California Supreme Court denied\nReyes\u2019s petition for review, and the U.S. Supreme Court\ndenied certiorari. In a supreme display of Ninth Circuit\nlegerdemain, the panel majority reviewed de novo, found that\nReyes\u2019s confession was obtained in violation of Missouri v.\nSeibert, 542 U.S. 600 (2004), and thus reversed the district\ncourt\u2019s denial of habeas relief. The panel truly conjured its\nmagic from nothing\u2014the panel did not watch the videos of\nthe police interviews, Reyes argued to the state appellate\ncourt that a deliberate Miranda violation was not at issue, and\nReyes never mentioned Seibert in federal court until the panel\ntold him to.\n\n    Like the district court and state court judges, I disagree\nwith the panel, which makes three errors of exceptional\nimportance. First, the panel wrongly concludes that Justice\nKennedy\u2019s subjective-intent requirement in Seibert, which\nseven other Justices rejected, is clearly established Supreme\nCourt law. Second, the panel wrongly permits federal courts\nto read the worst into state court decisions on habeas review.\nThird, the panel wrongly requires all courts to presume the\nworst of police officers in applying Seibert. The panel\u2019s\ndecision not only misunderstands Seibert, conflicts with our\nrecent en banc decisions, and creates circuit splits, but also\nthreatens to interfere with reasonable police work and let a\nconfessed murderer walk.\n\n    I respectfully dissent from this court\u2019s failure to rehear\nthis case en banc.\n\n                              I.\n\n   This case\u2019s background is important to understanding\nhow far the panel strayed from the scope of its review under\n\f12                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(AEDPA). While the panel\u2019s coverage of this background is\nincomplete in other respects, I will only supplement the\npanel\u2019s depiction of Reyes\u2019s third police interview and this\ncase\u2019s procedural history.\n\nA. Factual background\n\n    Police officers questioned Reyes about Ochoa\u2019s murder\non January 13, 2006, February 9, 2006, and February 10,\n2006. Reyes was told that he was not under arrest at the first\ntwo interviews, and he left both interviews free. At the\nFebruary 9th interview, Reyes offered to take a polygraph\ntest.\n\n    The following day, Reyes voluntarily returned to the San\nBernardino County Sheriff\u2019s station to take the polygraph\ntest. Reyes\u2019s parents consented to the test, which Robert\nHeard, the San Bernardino Sheriff\u2019s polygrapher,\nadministered. Heard first explained at great length that Reyes\nwas not under arrest, and Reyes responded that he\nunderstood. Heard noted that Reyes\u2019s parents had given\npermission for Reyes to take the test but emphasized that\n\u201c[t]he decision on whether or not Adrian is gonna take a\npolygraph exam is with Adrian. That\u2019s your decision.\nOkay?\u201d Heard reiterated, \u201cAfter we talk or at any time you\ncan say you know what Bob? I ain\u2019t spillin\u2019, I don\u2019t wanna\ntalk to you anymore. I wanna go. Just say so. You\u2019re out a\nhere, you\u2019re gone, you with me?\u201d Reyes said he understood.\nHeard walked Reyes through a consent form in detail. Reyes\nread part of the form aloud, stating \u201cI understand that I cannot\nbe forced to take this test. And you know what? I have the\nright at any time to leave . . . my examination room.\u201d Reyes\nconfirmed that he understood the consent form and signed it.\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                        13\n\n    After several \u201cdry runs\u201d during which Reyes contradicted\nhis previous narrative by placing himself in the silver Toyota\nCamry involved in the shooting near the scene and time of\nOchoa\u2019s murder, Reyes took the polygraph and denied\ninvolvement in the murder. Heard told Reyes that he failed\nthe test. Heard continued questioning, appealed to the\nimportance of telling the truth, and suggested that Reyes tell\nhim if there were any mitigating circumstances. Reyes stated\na few times that he didn\u2019t want to talk any more during the\nquestioning that followed, but he never sought to end the\ninterview and leave. Reyes asked what would happen if he\ndidn\u2019t say anything. Heard responded that the investigation\nwould continue\u2014\u201cThey\u2019re gonna work it, and they\u2019re gonna\nput it together.\u201d Reyes later said he didn\u2019t want to talk \u201ccause\neven if I say anything or if I don\u2019t, everybody[] that they got\non the list is gonna do 25 years prison.\u201d Reyes asked, \u201cSo if\nI say who the shooter was, I\u2019m still gonna go to jail?\u201d Heard\nresponded more than once that he did not have an answer to\nthat question, though Heard had previously stated that fifteen-\nyear olds don\u2019t go to state prison.\n\n    Reyes asked for some time and Heard offered to wait\noutside, but Reyes then said \u201cNo, it\u2019s alright.\u201d After Heard\nasked another question, Reyes responded \u201cnot that I know,\nyou know, so don\u2019t ask any question.\u201d Heard asked Reyes if\nhe wanted to be alone, and Reyes responded \u201cNo, it\u2019s just,\njust don\u2019t ask any questions.\u201d When Heard said he was not\njust going to sit there and do nothing, Reyes asked, \u201cCan we\njust call the detectives?\u201d\n\n    Shortly thereafter, in the same room, Detectives Brandt\nand Medici questioned Reyes. When Brandt asked whether\nReyes was in the front passenger seat, Reyes stated \u201cNo, I\u2019ll\nsay nothing, man.\u201d Reyes refused to identify the other person\n\f14                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nin the car and stated that \u201cwe\u2019re still gonna do time in jail\nanyway.\u201d Detective Brandt responded that the jail time \u201cmay\nbe minimal or it, it may be a lot, but like we told you\nyesterday, uh, people have, you have to tell the, the truth.\u201d\nDetective Brandt later asked Reyes how many 15-year olds\nhe knew that went to jail for 25 years and why Reyes would\nbe any different. Later in the interrogation, however, Reyes\ncontinued to acknowledge that he would do \u201c25 years to life\u201d\nif he shot Ochoa.\n\n    Not long after the Detectives began questioning, Reyes\nconfessed that he shot Ochoa: \u201cI just shot.\u201d As Ochoa\napproached the car, Reyes felt afraid and \u201cgot mad. [He]\nopened the door so he would like back up.\u201d Then he shot. As\nthe panel majority observes, \u201cReyes\u2019s statement that he had\nshot Ochoa came early in the interview, on the seventh page\nof the transcript.\u201d Maj. Op. 48. After this confession, the\ndetectives continued questioning and tried unsuccessfully to\ndetermine who else was involved.\n\n    After the interview at the San Bernardino Sheriff\u2019s station\nconcluded, Detective Brandt drove Reyes back to the\nRiverside police station where Detectives Brandt and Medici\nagain questioned Reyes. It is unclear how much time passed,\nbut the panel states that the station was 15 miles away. At the\nbeginning of the interview, Brandt explained that Reyes was\nno longer free to leave and thus Brandt was required to read\nReyes his Miranda rights. After reading him his rights,\nBrandt then asked if they could \u201ctalk about stuff we talked\nabout earlier today?\u201d Reyes said yes. In the interrogation\nthat followed, the detectives did not use the earlier interview\nto impeach Reyes. The only reference back was to an earlier\nstatement by Reyes that Ochoa had thrown something at the\n\f                            REYES V. LEWIS                               15\n\ncar. Reyes admitted to shooting Ochoa but said Ochoa\nlooked like he also had a gun.\n\nB. Procedural background\n\n     Reyes was charged in California Superior Court with\nfirst-degree murder. At the outset of the trial, Reyes sought\nto suppress the statements he had made to law enforcement\non February 10, 2006. Following an evidentiary hearing, the\ntrial judge suppressed the statements Reyes made before\nbeing advised of his Miranda rights, finding that Reyes had\nbeen in custody. The trial judge did not suppress the post-\nwarning statements. The jury found Reyes guilty of first-\ndegree murder with gang and firearm enhancements.\n\n     Reyes appealed, claiming, among other things, that the\ntrial court erred in admitting his post-warning confession.\nReyes argued that \u201cthe coercive atmosphere of the\ninvoluntary statements was never dissipated\u201d and that the\n\u201cadmonition of rights was too little, too late.\u201d He did not\nargue that the detectives deliberately violated Miranda. In\nfact, Reyes argued at length in his reply brief in the state\nappellate court that the State had incorrectly characterized\nSeibert as requiring \u201ccoordinated interrogation tactics\ndesigned to produce an unwarned confession.\u201d1 In other\n\n\n  1\n    The State had argued in its answering brief that there was no Miranda\nviolation and that Seibert was distinguishable because, among other\nreasons, \u201c[t]here was no evidence of a police policy of coordinated tactics\ndesigned to produce an un-warned confession.\u201d In one paragraph of his\nstate habeas petition, Reyes argued that some tactics that the officers used,\nnamely sneering and refusing to \u201crespect petitioner\u2019s efforts to end the\ninterrogation,\u201d were \u201cdeliberate\u201d and \u201cflagrant\u201d misconduct. But he did\nnot argue that the officers employed a two-part interrogation in deliberate\nviolation of Miranda, even after the State had addressed this issue.\n\f16                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nwords, according to Reyes, whether the officers deliberately\nemployed a two-part interrogation tactic designed to\nundermine the import of subsequent Miranda warnings was\nnot at issue. Rather, the operative question, according to\nReyes himself, was whether \u201cappellant\u2019s post-polygraph\nstatements were voluntary,\u201d and, if not, \u201cwhether the taint\nfrom the involuntary admissions was dissipated before the\nstationhouse admissions were made.\u201d\n\n    The state appellate court affirmed in a lengthy, reasoned\ndecision. People v. Reyes, No. D047521, 2010 WL 3026227\n(Cal. Ct. App. Aug. 4, 2010). Because it was uncontested that\nthe detectives did not violate Miranda in bad faith, the state\nappellate court agreed with Reyes on the relevant legal\ninquiry. The court explained, \u201c[A]s defendant recognizes, the\nfact the interrogation at the sheriff\u2019s station was not\naccompanied by Miranda advisals does not invalidate the\nlater Mirandized statements unless the later admissions were\nin fact involuntary or the tainted product of the initial\nstatements or confession.\u201d Id. at *12. Applying this\nstandard, the court determined that Reyes\u2019s pre- and post-\nwarning confessions were voluntary and thus the post-\nwarning confession was admissible. The court distinguished\nSeibert, explaining that \u201cthe circumstances in the instant case\nneed not \u2018be seen as challenging the comprehensibility and\nefficacy of the Miranda warnings to the point that a\nreasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes would not have\nunderstood them to convey a message that [he] retained a\nchoice about continuing to talk.\u2019\u201d Id. at *13 (alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Seibert, 542 U.S. at 616 (plurality\nopinion)).\n\n   Reyes sought review of the state appellate court\u2019s\ndecision by the California Supreme Court. In his briefs\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                         17\n\nbefore the California Supreme Court, Reyes did not mention\nSeibert. The California Supreme Court denied his petitions.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari.\n\n    Reyes then filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal\ndistrict court. In his briefs below, he again did not mention\nSeibert. Magistrate Judge Eick issued a 53-page report and\nrecommendation that relief be denied. District Judge Feess\nadopted the report in full. Consistent with Reyes\u2019s\narguments, and like the state appellate court, the district court\nfocused on whether a reasonable jurist could conclude that\nReyes\u2019s confessions were voluntary. However, the district\ncourt raised and distinguished Seibert because \u201cthere is no\nevidence that the law enforcement officers deliberately\napplied a two-step method, and the state courts reasonably\nconcluded that Petitioner\u2019s post-warning statements were\nvoluntarily made.\u201d\n\n    Reyes then appealed to the Ninth Circuit. On appeal, he\ndid not cite Seibert or take issue with the district court\u2019s\nconclusion that the detectives had not employed a two-part\ninterrogation in deliberate violation of Miranda. The panel\nnonetheless ordered \u201csupplemental briefing on the\napplicability of [Seibert] to this case.\u201d Reyes\u2019s supplemental\nbrief marked the first time that he clearly argued that the\nofficers\u2019 \u201cfailure to warn . . . was not made in good faith and\nwas . . . a deliberate attempt to deprive him of his\nconstitutional rights.\u201d The panel reviewed de novo the\nSeibert argument that it directed Reyes to make and, after\nengaging in appellate fact-finding on a record that did not\neven include the videos of the police interviews, found it\n\f18                        REYES V. LEWIS\n\npersuasive.2 The panel thus reversed the district court\u2019s\ndenial of habeas relief and ordered that relief be granted if\nReyes is not retried for Ochoa\u2019s now ten-and-a-half-year-old\nmurder.\n\n                                  II.\n\n   In reversing the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief, the\npanel committed three critical errors, any one of which should\nhave prompted en banc review.\n\nA. The panel wrongly concluded that Justice Kennedy\u2019s\n   lone concurrence in Seibert is clearly established\n   Supreme Court law.\n\n    The panel\u2019s amended opinion holds that Justice\nKennedy\u2019s lone concurrence in Seibert is clearly established\nlaw under the reasoning-based approach to applying Marks v.\nUnited States, 430 U.S. 188 (1977). We recently adopted the\nreasoning-based or \u201ccommon-denominator-of-the-reasoning\nrule\u201d in United States v. Davis, \u2014 F.3d \u2014, 2016 WL\n3245043 (9th Cir. June 13, 2016) (en banc). In Davis, we\nconcluded that Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in Freeman\nv. United States, 564 U.S. 522 (2011), was not controlling\nunder the reasoning-based rule because the Freeman plurality\nand dissent explicitly rejected the concurrence\u2019s reasoning.\nDavis, 2016 WL 3245043, at *6 (\u201cThe Freeman plurality\nexplicitly rejected the concurrence\u2019s reasoning.\u201d); id. at *9\n(\u201cThe Freeman dissent is similarly critical of Justice\nSotomayor . . . .\u201d); see also id. (emphasizing that \u201cJustice\n\n\n  2\n    The state appellate court and district court referenced videos of the\ninterviews, but none was included in the record. Reyes, 2010 WL\n3026227, at *6.\n\f                             REYES V. LEWIS                                 19\n\nSotomayor explicitly\u201d rejected the dissent\u2019s rule). We\nconcluded that \u201c[t]his fundamental divergence in reasoning\nis enough to demonstrate that Justice Sotomayor\u2019s rationale\nis not controlling Supreme Court law.\u201d Id. at *6. We\nexplained that this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that\nthere may be cases where relief would be granted under the\nconcurrence\u2019s rule but not the plurality\u2019s rule. Id. at *6\u20137.\n\n    Applying the common-denominator-of-the-reasoning\nMarks rule to Seibert, other circuit courts have found that\nJustice Kennedy\u2019s Seibert concurrence is \u201cobviously not the\n\u2018common denominator\u2019 that Marks was talking about.\u201d\nUnited States v. Heron, 564 F.3d 879, 883\u201387 (7th Cir. 2009);\nsee also United States v. Ray, 803 F.3d 244, 270\u201372 (6th Cir.\n2015). Just as the plurality and dissent expressly rejected\nelements of Justice Sotomayor\u2019s reasoning in Freeman, the\nplurality and dissent expressly (and even more emphatically)\nrejected Justice Kennedy\u2019s reasoning in Seibert. As the Sixth\nCircuit explained,\u201cthree of the four Justices in the plurality\nand the four dissenters decisively rejected any subjective\ngood faith consideration, based on deliberateness on the part\nof the police.\u201d3 Ray, 803 F.3d at 271 (quoting United States\n\n\n 3\n   See Seibert, 542 U.S. at 616 n.6 (plurality opinion) (\u201c[T]he focus is on\nfacts apart from intent . . . .\u201d); id. at 623 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he\nplurality correctly declines to focus its analysis on the subjective intent of\nthe interrogating officer.\u201d); id. at 624 (\u201cThe plurality\u2019s rejection of an\nintent-based test is also, in my view, correct.\u201d); id. at 625\u201326\n(\u201c[R]ecognizing an exception to [Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298 (1985)]\nfor intentional violations would require focusing constitutional analysis on\na police officer\u2019s subjective intent, an unattractive proposition that we all\nbut uniformly avoid.\u201d); id. at 626\u201327 (\u201c[T]he approach espoused by\nJustice Kennedy is ill advised . . . . This approach untethers the analysis\nfrom facts knowable to, and therefore having any potential directly to\naffect, the suspect.\u201d).\n\f20                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nv. Rodriguez-Preciado, 399 F.3d 1118, 1139\u201341 (9th Cir.\n2005) (Berzon, J., dissenting)); see also United States v.\nCarrizales-Toledo, 454 F.3d 1142, 1151 (10th Cir. 2006).\nUnder the reasoning-based Marks rule, reasoning expressly\nrejected by at least seven Justices cannot be elevated to the\nstatus of controlling Supreme Court law.\n\n     As in Davis, this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that\nthere are likely to be cases where relief would be granted\nunder Justice Kennedy\u2019s test but not the plurality\u2019s test. The\nplurality\u2019s test is concerned with the effectiveness of the\nbelated Miranda warnings. The plurality looks to \u201cthe\ncompleteness and detail of the questions and answers in the\nfirst round of interrogation, the overlapping content of the\ntwo statements, the timing and setting of the first and the\nsecond, the continuity of police personnel, and the degree to\nwhich the interrogator\u2019s questions treated the second round as\ncontinuous with the first.\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at 615. These\nand other objective facts are relevant to assessing whether \u201ca\nreasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes would [] have\nunderstood [the Miranda warnings] to convey a message that\nshe retained a choice about continuing to talk.\u201d Id. at 617.\nBy contrast, Justice Kennedy looks first to whether the police\ndeliberately violated Miranda and, if so, whether the officers\nused \u201ccurative measures . . . before the postwarning statement\nis made,\u201d such as \u201can additional warning that explains the\nlikely inadmissibility of the prewarning custodial statement.\u201d\nId. at 622.\n\n    There are likely to be cases involving deliberate Miranda\nviolations where most of the plurality\u2019s \u201ceffectiveness\nfactors\u201d are met but, because no explanation of the pre-\nwarning statement\u2019s inadmissibility or other \u201cspecific,\ncurative step\u201d was taken, Justice Kennedy\u2019s curative\n\f                          REYES V. LEWIS                             21\n\nmeasures requirement isn\u2019t. Similarly, there are likely cases\ninvolving deliberate violations where Justice Kennedy\u2019s\ncurative-measures requirement is met because \u201cspecific,\ncurative steps\u201d were taken, such as a warning that the pre-\nMiranda confession could not be used against the suspect, but\nthe plurality\u2019s effectiveness requirement isn\u2019t. For example,\nthe plurality\u2019s effectiveness requirement may not be satisfied\nbecause of \u201cthe completeness and detail of the questions and\nanswers in the first round of interrogation, the overlapping\ncontent of the two statements, the timing and setting of the\nfirst and the second, [and] the continuity of police personnel.\u201d\nId. at 615.\n\n    It is true that some courts have held that Justice\nKennedy\u2019s concurrence is controlling. However, just as the\nDavis opinion observed in distinguishing other circuits\u2019\ntreatment of Freeman, all of these courts \u201cengage with Marks\nonly superficially, quoting its language with no analysis,\u201d\nDavis, 2016 WL 3245043, at *8, and apparently applying a\nresults-based Marks rule.4 It is clear that the panel\u2019s amended\nopinion creates an additional circuit split on how the\n\n\n\n\n  4\n    United States v. Carter, 489 F.3d 528, 535\u201336 (2d Cir. 2007) (without\nmentioning Marks, summarily ruling that Seibert established an exception\nto Elstad); United States v. Torres-Lona, 491 F.3d 750, 758 (8th Cir.\n2007) (concluding without explanation that Justice Kennedy\u2019s\nconcurrence is controlling because it is \u201cnarrower\u201d); United States v.\nCourtney, 463 F.3d 333, 338 (5th Cir. 2006) (same); United States v.\nStreet, 472 F.3d 1298, 1313 (11th Cir. 2006) (same); United States v.\nNaranjo, 426 F.3d 221, 231\u201332 (3d Cir. 2005) (same); United States v.\nMashburn, 406 F.3d 303, 308\u201309 (4th Cir. 2005) (same).\n\f22                          REYES V. LEWIS\n\nreasoning-based Marks rule applies to Seibert. See Ray,\n803 F.3d at 267\u201373; Heron, 564 F.3d at 883\u201387.5\n\n    Evidently, the upshot of our en banc decision in Davis is\nthat fractured Supreme Court decisions like Seibert are\nbinding on state courts but not on us. But the panel\u2019s\nconclusion that Seibert is binding on state courts is even more\nquestionable under AEDPA. At the very least, the \u201cfair-\nminded disagreement\u201d between circuit courts on whether\nSeibert created any controlling rule, shows that Justice\nKennedy\u2019s deliberateness requirement is not \u201cclearly\nestablished law\u201d within the meaning of AEDPA.6 See White\nv. Woodall, 134 S. Ct. 1697, 1703 (2014); Harrington v.\nRichter, 562 U.S. 86, 102\u201303 (2011).\n\nB. The panel violated AEDPA by presuming that the\n   state appellate court did not understand and follow\n   clearly established law.\n\n    Even if Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence were clearly\nestablished Supreme Court law, the panel violated AEDPA.\nThe panel majority deemed itself unfettered by AEDPA\n\n  5\n   The Tenth Circuit similarly questioned whether Seibert established a\ncontrolling rule, but found it unnecessary to reach the issue. Carrizales-\nToledo, 454 F.3d at 1151. The First and D.C. Circuits have also expressed\nskepticism. United States v. Straker, 800 F.3d 570, 617 (D.C. Cir. 2015);\nUnited States v. Verdugo, 617 F.3d 565, 575 (1st Cir. 2010).\n 6\n   The panel\u2019s statement that the Sixth Circuit found the Seibert plurality\nopinion controlling in Ray is wrong. In Ray, the Sixth Circuit found that\nSeibert did not establish a controlling rule, and then chose to adopt as\nbinding the rule articulated by the four-Justice plurality. Ray, 803 F.3d at\n272. The panel fails to understand that a fractured Supreme Court\ndecision that did not establish a controlling rule is not clearly established\nSupreme Court law under AEDPA.\n\f                           REYES V. LEWIS                               23\n\nbecause, in its view, the state appellate court\u2019s decision did\nnot expressly make a finding regarding the deliberateness\nelement of Justice Kennedy\u2019s test in Seibert. However, the\nstate appellate court\u2019s decision is readily reconciled with\nSeibert.\n\n     First, several parts of the state appellate court\u2019s decision\nmay be read to acknowledge expressly that the detectives did\nnot deliberately violate Miranda. The court found \u201cno\nevidence that defendant was coerced into waiving his rights,\u201d\nand explained that Detective Brandt \u201cadvise[d] [Reyes] of his\nMiranda rights before questioning him further\u201d at the police\nstation because Brandt no longer regarded Reyes as being\n\u201cfree to leave.\u201d Reyes, 2010 WL 3026227, at *6, 13. The\nstate appellate court also distinguished People v. Neal,\n31 Cal. 4th 63, 80\u201381 (2003), \u201cin which a police detective\nintentionally continued interrogation in deliberate violation of\nMiranda.\u201d Id. at *9. Moreover, the state court\u2019s decision\ntacitly acknowledges, as the record confirms, that Reyes did\nnot even contend that the officers violated Miranda in bad\nfaith. The court explained that, accordingly, \u201cas defendant\nrecognizes, the fact the interrogation at the sheriff\u2019s station\nwas not accompanied by Miranda advisals does not invalidate\nthe later Mirandized statements unless the later admissions\nwere in fact involuntary or the tainted product of the initial\nstatements or confession.\u201d Id. at *12 (emphasis added). This\nis the correct inquiry under Justice Kennedy\u2019s Seibert test in\ncases where it is undisputed that the officers did not violate\nMiranda in bad faith.7\n\n\n  7\n    The panel fundamentally misses the point of Seibert and Elstad in\narguing that \u201cthat the test for admissibility of a confession is not whether\nit was voluntary [but] whether it was taken in violation of Miranda.\u201d\nConcurrence at 3. Again, even where a pre-warning interview was\n\f24                        REYES V. LEWIS\n\n    The panel does not attempt to address this textual\nevidence that the state court correctly understood the law. In\nany case, such parsing of sentences in the state court\u2019s\ndecision takes us beyond our role under AEDPA. Even if the\ndecision were silent or ambiguous on whether the detectives\ndeliberately violated Miranda, de novo review is still\nforeclosed. Under controlling Supreme Court precedent, we\nmust presume \u201cstate courts know and follow the law,\u201d give\nstate courts \u201cthe benefit of the doubt,\u201d and make an \u201ceffort to\nreconcile\u201d the reasoning of state courts with controlling\nSupreme Court rules. Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 24\n(2002); see also Renico v. Lett, 559 U.S. 766, 773 (2010);\nLindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 333, n.7 (1997); Poyson v.\nRyan, 743 F.3d 1185, 1199 (9th Cir. 2013), as amended\n(Apr. 2, 2014) (\u201cAEDPA does not allow us to presume from\nan ambiguous record that the state court applied an\nunconstitutional standard.\u201d), overruled on other grounds by\nMcKinney v. Ryan, 813 F.3d 798 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc).\nLike its first major error, the panel\u2019s second error also\nconflicts with a recent en banc decision of this court. The\npanel majority\u2019s reasoning is clearly irreconcilable with our\nrule in Mann v. Ryan, \u2014 F.3d \u2014, 2016 WL 3854234, at *11\n(9th Cir. July 15, 2016) (en banc), that if \u201cwe can read the\n[state court] decision to comport with clearly established\nfederal law, we must do so.\u201d\n\n    Second, as Judge Singleton explained in his concurrence\nin this case, the state court\u2019s analysis can also be reconciled\nwith Seibert if the decision is read to have found that the\n\n\ncustodial and thus administered in violation of Miranda, a post-warning\nconfession remains admissible under Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence so\nlong as the officers did not deliberately violate Miranda and the\nconfession was voluntary.\n\f                      REYES V. LEWIS                       25\n\nMiranda warnings were effective. The state court made the\nfollowing finding in distinguishing Seibert:\n\n       Unlike in Missouri v. Seibert (2004) 542 U.S.\n       600, 616, the circumstances in the instant case\n       need not \u201cbe seen as challenging the\n       comprehensibility and efficacy of the\n       Miranda warnings to the point that a\n       reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes\n       would not have understood them to convey a\n       message that [he] retained a choice about\n       continuing to talk.\u201d (Id. at p. 616.)\n\nReyes, 2010 WL 3026227, at *13. This finding of\neffectiveness provides an additional ground for distinguishing\nSeibert, even assuming that the detectives deliberately\nviolated Miranda. Under either ground, the panel majority\nerred in \u201cfree[ing] itself from AEDPA\u2019s strictures.\u201d Kernan\nv. Hinojosa, 136 S. Ct. 1603, 1605 (2016) (per curiam). As\nexplained below, we need not reach the question whether the\nstate appellate court\u2019s effectiveness finding was an\nobjectively unreasonable application of Seibert because a\nreasonable jurist could conclude that any Miranda violation\nwas unintentional.\n\nC. The panel wrongly presumed that the police violated\n   Miranda in bad faith, and conflated the deliberateness\n   of a Miranda violation with the effectiveness of a\n   subsequent Miranda warning.\n\n    Even if de novo review were appropriate, the panel\u2019s\ndecision misinterprets Seibert and creates bad law on how\ncourts should assess whether police officers deliberately\nviolated Miranda.\n\f26                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\n    The panel begins its analysis of whether the detectives\ndeliberately violated Miranda by stating, \u201c\u2018the most plausible\nreason\u2019 for delaying Miranda warnings until after a suspect\nhas confessed \u2018is an illegitimate one, which is the\ninterrogator\u2019s desire to weaken the warning\u2019s effectiveness.\u2019\u201d\nMaj. Op. 67 (quoting United States v. Williams, 435 F.3d\n1148, 1159 (9th Cir. 2006)). The panel\u2019s presumption of bad\nfaith is contrary to Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence in Seibert,\neffectively overrules Elstad, and removes a habeas corpus\npetitioner\u2019s burden of proving a constitutional violation. See\nThompson v. Runnels, 657 F.3d 784, 788\u201391 (9th Cir.)\n(Callahan, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc)\n(explaining that \u201ccontrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, . . .\nSeibert did not overrule Elstad\u201d), vac\u2019d sub nom. McEwen v.\nThompson, 132 S. Ct. 578 (2011).\n\n     As the State points out, nothing in Seibert \u201csuggests that\nit is necessary or proper to presume wrongdoing on the part\nof police.\u201d Justice Kennedy explained that his test would\napply only \u201cin the infrequent case\u201d where detectives\ndeliberately violated Miranda. Seibert, 542 U.S. at 622. He\nemphasized that in most cases \u201c[t]he admissibility of\npostwarning statements should continue to be governed by\nthe principles of Elstad.\u201d Id. He \u201csuggested a number of\nplausible reasons why an officer might legitimately wait to\ndeliver Miranda warnings, including that \u2018[a]n officer may\nnot realize that a suspect is in custody and warnings are\nrequired.\u2019\u201d United States v. Stewart, 536 F.3d 714, 720 (7th\nCir. 2008) (alteration in original) (quoting Seibert, 542 U.S.\nat 620 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment)).\n\n    Other circuits have rightly refused to presume that police\nofficers act in bad faith. See, e.g., id. at 720\u201321; Carrizales-\nToledo, 454 F.3d at 1153 (concluding that there was no\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                         27\n\ndeliberate two-step interrogation because \u201cit is likely that [the\nofficer] failed to provide the Miranda warning because at that\npoint it was unclear whether [the suspect] was in custody\u201d).\nIndeed, the Supreme Court has admonished that \u201cthe task of\ndefining \u2018custody\u2019 is a slippery one, and police[ officers]\ninvestigating serious crimes [cannot realistically be expected\nto] make no errors whatsoever.\u201d Elstad, 470 U.S. at 309\n(second alteration in original). Where police officers\nengrossed in the moment mistake the difficult line between\ncustodial and non-custodial interviews, we will not suppress\nsubsequent warned and voluntary \u201cadmissions of guilt by\nwrongdoers, [which] are inherently desirable.\u201d Id. at 305\n(quoting United States v. Washington, 431 U.S. 181, 187\n(1977)).\n\n    The panel also misconstrued Seibert, collapsed the\nplurality and concurrence\u2019s tests, and effectively overruled\nElstad by conflating the issue of whether the detectives\ndeliberately violated Miranda with the issue of whether the\nmidstream-Miranda warning was effective. The majority\nfound indicative of deliberateness the facts that the pre-\nwarning and post-warning confessions overlapped in content,\nthe detectives did not take specific curative measures, and\nthere was overlap in personnel. These facts do not pertain to\nthe subjective intent of the detectives; they pertain to\nassessing whether \u201ca reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes\nwould . . . have understood [the midstream-Miranda\nwarnings] to convey a message that she retained a choice\nabout continuing to talk.\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at 617 (plurality\nopinion).\n\n    At best, such evidence is neutral on whether detectives\ndeliberately violated Miranda. For example, the fact that\n\u201cReyes provided essentially the same information,\u201d Maj. Op.\n\f28                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\n69, during the warned and unwarned interrogations has little\nbearing on whether the detectives deliberately violated\nMiranda. Of course Reyes\u2019s pre-warning confession to\nmurdering Ochoa overlapped with his post-warning\nconfession to murdering Ochoa. How could it be otherwise?\nIf \u201cthere was no earlier confession to repeat,\u201d Seibert would\nnot apply and we would not need to consider deliberateness.\nBobby v. Dixon, 132 S. Ct. 26, 31 (2011) (per curiam).\nSimilarly, the fact that \u201cBrandt did not take curative\nmeasures,\u201d Maj. Op. 70, is relevant to whether the\nmidstream-Miranda warning was effective. But this fact does\nnot show that detectives who clearly endeavored to create a\nnon-custodial interview employed a two-part interrogation in\ndeliberate violation of Miranda. If the detectives thought the\npre-warning interview was non-custodial, then they would\nhave thought such \u201ccorrective measures\u201d to have been\nunnecessary. The panel\u2019s view that Brandt \u201cplayed down\u201d\nthe importance of the Miranda warnings by stating that he\nwanted \u201cjust to clarify stuff,\u201d id., also is relevant to whether\nthe midstream-Miranda warning was effective. But such\nstatements do not establish a deliberate Miranda violation.\nAgain, if the detectives thought the pre-warning interview\nwas non-custodial, they would have seen no problem with\nreferencing it.     As Justice Kennedy noted, \u201cSkilled\ninvestigators often interview suspects multiple times, and\ngood police work may involve referring to prior statements to\ntest their veracity or to refresh recollection.\u201d Seibert,\n542 U.S. at 620.\n\n    The panel also found the fact that the \u201cthree Riverside\npolice officers involved in the case\u2014Brandt, Wheeler and\nMedici\u2014were all experienced officers\u201d to evidence a\ndeliberate Miranda violation. Maj. Op. 69. But the fact that\nthe officers were seasoned is just as likely to evidence that\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                         29\n\nthey understood Miranda and endeavored to keep the\ninterview non-custodial. Similarly, the fact that the\ndetectives \u201cobtained the incriminating information from\nReyes very early in the unwarned custodial interrogation,\u201d\nMaj. Op. 70\u201371, does not evidence a deliberate Miranda\nviolation. Rather, that Reyes quickly confessed once the\ndetectives entered, at Reyes\u2019s request, shows that the officers\nwould have had little reason to believe that Reyes no longer\nfelt free to leave and thus that the interview had become\ncustodial.\n\n    Inexplicably, the panel went as far as to attribute bad faith\nto the detectives because they questioned Reyes \u201cin a\nnonconfrontational, sympathetic way, with the result that\nReyes was made to feel . . . comfortable . . . and laugh[].\u201d Id.\nAs explained below, this fact and many others that the panel\nignored show that a reasonable jurist could find that the\ndetectives did \u201cnot realize that [the] suspect [was] in custody\nand warnings [were] required,\u201d which is a good-faith reason\nfor not delivering Miranda warnings earlier. Seibert,\n542 U.S. at 620 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment).\n\nD. The state appellate court and federal district court\n   correctly found that the detectives did not deliberately\n   violate Miranda and that Reyes\u2019s post-warning\n   murder confession was admissible.\n\n    Under AEDPA, the state court\u2019s determination that no\nMiranda violation occurred is entitled to deference and\nshould be upheld as long as \u201cfairminded jurists could\ndisagree\u201d on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\nHarrington, 562 U.S. at 101. Even if de novo review applied\nhere, however, the panel erroneously concluded that the\ndetectives deliberately violated Miranda. The weight of\n\f30                         REYES V. LEWIS\n\nobjective and subjective evidence favors the view that the\nreason that the pre-warning interview was unwarned is that\nthe officers believed that Reyes was not in custody. After all,\nReyes was repeatedly told that he was not under arrest and\nwas free to leave, left two previous interviews free, requested\nthe polygraph interview, consented to it verbally and in\nwriting, and then asked to speak to the detectives after its\nconclusion. Under applicable case law, these facts and many\nothers weigh strongly in favor of the view that the officers\nreasonably viewed the pre-warning interview to have been\nnon-custodial.\n\n    For example, following the Supreme Court, \u201c[w]e have\nconsistently held that a defendant is not in custody when\nofficers tell him that he is not under arrest and is free to leave\nat any time,\u201d United States v. Bassignani, 575 F.3d 879, 886\n(9th Cir. 2009), as the officers here repeatedly told Reyes.8\nCourts have also consistently held that the fact that a\ndefendant came to the police station voluntarily, as Reyes did\nhere, weighs in favor of the view that he was not in custody.\nBeheler, 463 U.S. at 1122 (noting that the suspect\n\u201cvoluntarily agreed to accompany police to the station\n\n\n\n\n   8\n     See also Howes v. Fields, 132 S. Ct. 1181, 1185 (2012) (\u201cMost\nimportant, respondent was told at the outset of the interrogation, and was\nreminded again thereafter, that he could leave . . . .\u201d); California v.\nBeheler, 463 U.S. 1121, 1122 (1983) (per curiam); Oregon v. Mathiason,\n429 U.S. 492, 495 (1977); United States v. Crawford, 372 F.3d 1048, 1060\n(9th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (\u201cPerhaps most significant for resolving the\nquestion of custody, Defendant was expressly told that he was not under\narrest . . . .\u201d); Dyer v. Hornbeck, 706 F.3d 1134, 1136\u201340 (9th Cir. 2013);\nUnited States v. Norris, 428 F.3d 907, 912 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\f                           REYES V. LEWIS                             31\n\nhouse\u201d).9 Courts have also held that the fact that a defendant\nconsented in writing to a polygraph test, as Reyes did here, is\npowerful evidence that the defendant was not in custody.\nPeople v. Ochoa, 19 Cal. 4th 353, 402 (Cal. 1998).\n\n    Still other objective facts support the view that the\ndetectives reasonably believed that Reyes did not view\nhimself to be in custody. For example, the detectives released\nReyes after two previous interviews. See, e.g., Beheler,\n463 U.S. at 1122 (emphasizing that \u201cBeheler was permitted\nto return to his home\u201d). The officers did not restrain Reyes\nin the exam room or yell at him. They permitted Reyes to\ngive narrative answers and \u201cappealed to his interest in telling\nthe truth and being helpful.\u201d Yarborough v. Alvarado,\n541 U.S. 652, 664 (2004). These are all signs that the officers\nendeavored to keep the pre-warning interview non-custodial,\nnot to violate Miranda in bad faith.\n\n    Moreover, the panel concedes that there is no subjective\nevidence that the detectives deliberately violated Miranda.\nThere is, however, subjective evidence that they did not. As\nthe state appellate court observed, Detective Brandt stated\nbefore giving the Miranda warnings that the warnings were\nnow required because Reyes was no longer free to leave.\nReyes, 2010 WL 3026227, at *6. The clear implication is that\nDetective Brandt did not believe that the warnings were\nrequired earlier because he believed the earlier interview was\nnon-custodial.\n\n\n\n\n  9\n    See also Mathiason, 429 U.S. at 495 (\u201cHe came voluntarily to the\npolice station . . . .\u201d); Crawford, 372 F.3d at 1059 (emphasizing that the\ndefendant \u201cagreed to accompany\u201d the officers).\n\f32                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\n    It is true that some circumstances were indicative of\ncustody and thus lend some support to the view that the\nofficers knew that the pre-warning interview had turned\ncustodial. In its analysis, the panel oddly does not mention\nthe strongest of such evidence, that Reyes intermittently\nstated that he did not want to answer particular questions.\nReyes, however, never sought to terminate the interview and\nleave.     Especially given that Reyes had previously\nacknowledged many times that he could terminate the\ninterview and leave, and had left two previous interviews free\nafter intermittently declining to answer questions, the fact that\nthe officers continued questioning him is not dispositive of a\ndeliberate Miranda violation. Moreover, as the state appellate\ncourt emphasized, Officer \u201cHeard ultimately terminated the\npostpolygraph questioning upon defendant\u2019s request.\u201d Id. at\n*8. Reyes then asked to speak with the detectives, not to\nleave. Indeed, the transcripts suggest that Reyes remained\nbecause he was fishing for a deal.\n\n    Similarly, I cannot conclude on AEDPA or clear error\nreview that the officers employed a two-part interrogation in\ndeliberate violation of Miranda simply because the officers\nquestioned Reyes\u2019s veracity, confronted him with evidence of\nhis guilt, and suggested leniency. See, e.g., Mathiason,\n429 U.S. at 493 (officers told the suspect that his fingerprints\nhad been found at the scene and that \u201chis truthfulness would\npossibly be considered by the district attorney or judge\u201d);\nStansbury v. California, 511 U.S. 318, 325 (1994) (telling a\nperson he is a \u201cprime suspect\u201d does not necessarily mean he\nis under arrest because \u201csome suspects are free to come and\ngo until the police decide to make an arrest\u201d).\n\n   Again, this is not to say that the pre-warning interview\ncould not reasonably be viewed as custodial; that 20\u201320\n\f                        REYES V. LEWIS                         33\n\nhindsight legal conclusion made by judges is not at issue.\nWhat is at issue is whether officers engrossed in the moment\nknew that the interview had become custodial but deliberately\npressed on to undermine the effect of subsequent Miranda\nwarnings. It bears repeating that Miranda warnings need be\ngiven only once a suspect is in custody. There is nothing\nwrong with officers seeking to question a suspect in a non-\ncustodial situation. Rather, this may be viewed as good\npolice work. So long as the officers believed that the\ninterview remained non-custodial, where they turned out to\nbe mistaken, a subsequent, warned confession must be\nallowed into evidence if voluntarily given. Here, a\nreasonable jurist could conclude, as did the state appellate\ncourt and the district court, that the detectives did \u201cnot realize\nthat [Reyes was] in custody and warnings [were] required.\u201d\nSee Seibert, 542 U.S. at 620 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the\njudgment).\n\n    Because any Miranda violation by the detectives was not\ndeliberate, the operative question under de novo review, as\nthe state courts, the district court, the prosecution, and Reyes\ncorrectly recognized, is whether Reyes\u2019s post-warning\nconfession is admissible under Elstad. Under Elstad, \u201c[t]he\nrelevant inquiry is whether, in fact, the second statement was\nalso voluntarily made.\u201d Elstad, 470 U.S. at 318. The state\nappellate court and the district court explained in detail why\nboth the pre-warning and post-warning confessions were\nvoluntary, and thus the post-warning confession was\nadmissible. Reyes, 2010 WL 3026227, at *8\u201314. I will not\nrepeat those courts\u2019 exhaustive analyses here. I note only that\nthe state appellate court\u2019s conclusion that Reyes\u2019s confessions\nwere voluntary must be given even \u201cmore leeway\u201d on\nAEDPA review given the inquiry\u2019s open-ended nature. See\nAlvarado, 541 U.S. at 664; Harrington, 562 U.S. at 102\n\f34                         REYES V. LEWIS\n\n(\u201c[E]ven a strong case for relief does not mean the state\ncourt\u2019s contrary conclusion was unreasonable.\u201d). The panel\nmajority has not conducted this inquiry, which should have\nbeen the focus of its analysis from the start given the absence\nof bad faith by the detectives.10\n\n                                   III.\n\n    The panel\u2019s decision conflicts with AEDPA, Supreme\nCourt precedent, other circuits\u2019 precedent, our recent en banc\ndecisions, and Seibert itself. Moreover, the panel is wrong in\nfinding that Detective Brandt, Detective Wheeler, and Officer\nHeard violated Miranda in bad faith. Our failure to go en\nbanc has consequences. Courts in our circuit will be\npermitted to read the worst into state court decisions and\nrequired to presume the worst of police officers in assessing\n\n  10\n     The panel suggests that Reyes might not have been the triggerman,\nnoting that two witnesses testified that the driver was the shooter. This\nsuggestion not only epitomizes the type of second-guessing by our court\nthat AEDPA is designed to limit, but also inaccurately characterizes the\nrecord. One of these two witnesses stated that the initial shots that hit\nOchoa came from inside the car and then the driver stepped around the car\nand fired additional shots. Another witness testified that he heard\ngunshots and then saw a passenger get out of the back of the car and\napproach Ochoa. All of this, of course, went to the jury, but the panel\napparently thinks itself capable of finding facts based on an incomplete,\ncold record. The panel\u2019s suggestion that Reyes was an innocent passenger\nwho took the fall for his older cousin is further undercut by the fact that\nReyes voluntarily confessed after acknowledging several times that he\nwould do \u201c25 years to life\u201d for shooting Ochoa. Moreover, Reyes\u2019s guilt\nis beyond reasonable dispute. The evidence presented at trial shows\noverwhelmingly that Reyes and his cousin set out in Reyes\u2019s aunt\u2019s car to\nexact revenge on a rival neighborhood in retaliation for an assault on\nReyes the previous day. They came across Ochoa and killed him in a\ndrive-by as he waited outside of his house for his parents to take him to\nschool.\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                       35\n\nwhether a confession was constitutionally obtained.\nReasonable police work will be disrupted. The decision\neffectively forces officers to tell wrongdoers that their pre-\nwarning admissions may not be used against them, even\nwhere the officers do not believe that the pre-warning\ninterview had become custodial. The State will be required\nto retry a confessed murderer to secure justice. Its ability to\nsucceed is uncertain given the decade that has passed since\nOchoa\u2019s murder.\n\n    For these reasons, I dissent from our failure to take this\ncase en banc.\n\n\n\nBEA, Circuit Judge, with whom O\u2019SCANNLAIN, Circuit\nJudge, joins as to paragraphs 1 and 4, dissenting from the\ndenial of rehearing en banc:\n\n    1. I join Judge Callahan\u2019s dissent from the denial of\nrehearing en banc.\n\n    2. I write separately to reiterate my view that United\nStates v. Davis, __ F.3d __, 2016 WL 3245043 (9th Cir. June\n13, 2016) (en banc), was wrongly decided. As I explained in\nmy Davis dissent, id. at *15\u2013*18 (Bea, J., dissenting), Marks\nv. United States, 430 U.S. 188 (1977), requires that we apply\na \u201cresults-based\u201d approach, not a \u201creasoning-based\u201d\napproach, when interpreting splintered Supreme Court\ndecisions.\n\n   3. Had my view commanded a majority of the Davis en\nbanc Court, I would likely agree with the panel that Justice\nKennedy\u2019s concurring opinion in Missouri v. Seibert,\n\f36                    REYES V. LEWIS\n\n542 U.S. 600 (2004), provides a controlling rule. In my Davis\ndissent, I cited with approval United States v. Williams,\n435 F.3d 1148, 1157\u201358 (9th Cir. 2006), which applied a\nresults-based approach and concluded that \u201cboth the [Seibert]\nplurality and Justice Kennedy agree that where law\nenforcement officers deliberately employ a two-step\ninterrogation to obtain a confession and where separations of\ntime and circumstance and additional curative warnings are\nabsent or fail to apprise a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s\nshoes of his rights, the trial court should suppress the\nconfession.\u201d However, I agree with Judge Callahan that,\nunder the reasoning-based approach adopted in Davis,\nWilliams should be revisited. See Callahan Dissent at 18\u201322;\nsee also United States v. Rodriguez\u2013Preciado, 399 F.3d 1118,\n1138\u201343 (9th Cir. 2005) (Berzon, J., dissenting).\n\n    4. I also wish to underline two AEDPA-related points\nmade by Judge Callahan in her dissent. First, our conclusion\nthat Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion in Seibert provides\na controlling rule\u2014right or wrong\u2014is not \u201cclearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Even if we are\nbound by Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion in cases on\ndirect review, there is a \u201cpossibility for fairminded\ndisagreement\u201d regarding the controlling effect of that\nopinion, such that it may not control in cases, such as this\none, in which AEDPA applies. Harrington v. Richter,\n562 U.S. 86, 103 (2011); see Callahan Dissent at 19\u201322\n(noting that other federal courts of appeals have found that\nJustice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion in Seibert does not\nprovide a controlling rule). Second, we must give state courts\n\u201cthe benefit of the doubt\u201d and attempt to reconcile the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal\u2019s decision with Seibert. Woodford\nv. Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 24 (2002) (per curiam). As Judge\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                       37\n\nCallahan discusses, we can do so by reading the state-court\ndecision to \u201cacknowledge expressly that the detectives did not\ndeliberately violate Miranda.\u201d Callahan Dissent at 23. Of\ncourse, whether the detectives acted with deliberation is\nquintessentially a factual issue. As Judge Callahan explains,\na finding by the California Court of Appeal that the detectives\ndid not deliberately violate Miranda was not \u201can\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\nevidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2254(d)(2); see Callahan Dissent at 29\u201334.\n\n    5. For these reasons, I join Judge Callahan\u2019s dissent with\nthe caveat that I continue to believe Davis was wrongly\ndecided.\n\n\n\n                         OPINION\n\nW. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\n\n    Petitioner Adrian Reyes petitions for a writ of habeas\ncorpus on the ground, inter alia, that his state-court\nconviction rested on a confession obtained in violation of\nMissouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600 (2004). For the reasons that\nfollow, we reverse the district court and remand with\ninstructions to grant the writ.\n\n                   I. Factual Background\n\n   On January 11, 2006, an armed person exited a silver\nToyota Camry and shot Derek Ochoa three times. The person\nmay have yelled \u201cDelhi\u201d (the name of an Orange County\n\f38                    REYES V. LEWIS\n\ngang). Ochoa died as a result of the shooting. He was a\nsenior at La Sierra High School in Riverside County.\n\n    Riverside Police Department officers traced the Camry to\nthe home of Andres Munoz, an older cousin of petitioner\nAdrian Reyes. The car was registered to another member of\nthe Munoz family, Albert. Reyes had recently moved to\nRiverside County from Orange County. He was a freshman\nat La Sierra. He was not quite two months past his fifteenth\nbirthday.\n\n    The day before the shooting, Reyes had been walking\nhome from school with a friend. A carload of gang members\ndrove up and asked Reyes where he was from. Reyes\nanswered \u201cDelhi.\u201d One of the gang members punched Reyes\nin the eye. They then drove away, yelling \u201cSouth Side\nRiverside 51-50.\u201d\n\n    Two days after the shooting, Riverside Police Department\nhomicide detectives James Brandt and Rick Wheeler\nquestioned Reyes at his aunt\u2019s home. Reyes had moved from\nhis family\u2019s home to his aunt\u2019s home the day after his assault\nby the gang members. The detectives\u2019 questions related\nprimarily to the assault. During the questioning, Reyes\nacknowledged that he had known Ochoa and that he knew\nDelhi was a \u201cgroup in Santa Ana.\u201d\n\n     Nearly a month later, on February 9, sometime between\n5:20 and 5:30 in the morning, a SWAT team of between\nfifteen and twenty officers executed a search warrant on\nReyes\u2019s aunt\u2019s home. They handcuffed Reyes and searched\nthe house. In Reyes\u2019s bedroom they discovered papers with\n\u201cDelhi\u201d written in large block letters. After the house was\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                         39\n\nsecured, Reyes was released from handcuffs and allowed to\neat breakfast.\n\n   Brandt told Reyes that he was not under arrest, but that he\nwanted to ask him some questions at the station. Reyes\nacquiesced, and he was driven to the Riverside police station.\nReyes was not accompanied to the station by any family\nmember. At the station, Brandt and Wheeler together\nquestioned Reyes. At no point during their questioning on\nFebruary 9 did they provide Miranda warnings.\n\n    Reyes was held at the station for some time before he was\nquestioned. Wheeler began the interview by saying, \u201cThanks\nfor being so dang patient man I appreciate you . . . [h]anging\nout for us \u2019cause it\u2019s been a long day, long day.\u201d Wheeler\ntold Reyes that he could stop the interview at any time: \u201cI just\nwanna make sure that you understand that if we get at some\npoint in the interview that you\u2019re done talkin\u2019 . . . and you\ndon\u2019t feel like answering any more questions or whatever, let\nme know, okay?\u201d\n\n    Wheeler asked briefly about the assault the day before the\nshooting. He then asked about the shooting. He said that the\nsearch warrants had been executed and that they had talked\n\u201cwith all these different people.\u201d \u201c[W]e got pictures, too, . . .\nand I\u2019ve had more than one person say that\u2019s the car that the\nguy was in, okay? . . . I\u2019ve got enough information that shows\nthat you were there.\u201d (Wheeler\u2019s statement was false. The\nonly witness who had made any type of identification had not\nidentified Reyes.) According to the transcript, Wheeler was\ninterrupted by the \u201csound of sniffing.\u201d Wheeler continued,\n\u201c[T]here\u2019s no denying it. . . . [T]he truth is gonna come out\nand, and I already know what it is.\u201d Reyes denied that he was\nthere. \u201cI didn\u2019t go out that day you could ask my Mom, you\n\f40                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nwould ask anybody in my home I didn\u2019t come out that day, I\nwas sleeping.\u201d When Wheeler said that the police had\nspoken to his family already, Reyes said, \u201cDon\u2019t you guys\nhave a lie detector or something? I, I was in my house.\u201d\n\n    Brandt then took over the questioning. He challenged\nReyes, saying that he had his phone records. \u201cWhen your\nphone is being used basically six, seven, eight times an hour\nevery, you know, on an average every five minutes so you\u2019re\nnot sleeping okay?\u201d Brandt was interrupted by the \u201csound of\nsniffing.\u201d Brandt suggested a mitigating version of events:\n\u201cThere is a big difference between being in the car when this\nthing happens . . . and being the shooter and stuff. . . . So\njust tell us what happened, okay?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve done our\nhomework, dude and . . . don\u2019t screw yourself and lie to us,\nseriously, tell us what happened.\u201d\n\n    Wheeler and Brandt pressed Reyes on the inconsistency\nbetween Reyes\u2019s statements and his phone records. Wheeler\nasked him about the papers found in his room with \u201cDelhi\nwritten in big letters.\u201d Brandt said, \u201cWe work homicide,\nalright, we gonna do our homework, definitely, I\u2019m telling\nyou, we have the car, we have the gun, we have five guns\ntotal. . . .\u201d (Brandt\u2019s statement was false. The Sheriff\u2019s\nDepartment had not recovered\u2014indeed, never did\nrecover\u2014the gun used to shoot Ochoa.)\n\n    Wheeler and Brandt continued to press Reyes. Brandt\nsaid, \u201c[T]here\u2019s another detective was out showing witnesses\nthe picture . . . \u2019cause we had a picture of you.\u201d Wheeler\nimmediately followed, \u201cAnd we identified you as being in the\ncar.\u201d (Wheeler\u2019s statement was false. Reyes had not been\nidentified by anyone as having been in the car.) Brandt said,\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to trick you and . . . I\u2019m not making the stuff\n\f                       REYES V.

[S]o you know I\u2019m not trying to\ntrick you.\u201d\n\n    Brandt talked about Ochoa\u2019s family and their \u201cright to\nunderstand what happened.\u201d Reyes responded, \u201cI don\u2019t really\nwant to say nothing no more . . . trying to cooperate here.\u201d\n(Elision in original.)    Brandt replied, \u201cYou\u2019re not\ncooperating.\u201d Brandt was interrupted multiple times by the\n\u201csound of sniffing.\u201d A moment later, Brandt said, \u201cTell me\nwhat happened.\u201d Reyes responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know nothing\nman.\u201d\n\n    Reyes said, \u201cStop asking me questions.\u201d Brandt said, \u201cNo\nI\u2019m not gonna stop asking you questions.\u201d Brandt was again\ninterrupted by the \u201csound of sniffing.\u201d\n\n   Brandt said, \u201c[A]re you willing to take a polygraph\nexamination?\u201d Reyes responded, \u201cYeah.\u201d Brandt elaborated,\n\u201cAbout everything.\u201d Reyes responded, \u201cI guess, man, I don\u2019t\nknow nothing man.\u201d Reyes mentioned that he might need to\nhave his parents there, but Brandt interrupted him, saying,\n\u201c[W]e\u2019ll certainly arrange for all that stuff just seeing that\nyou\u2019re willing to . . . do it.\u201d\n\n     A moment later, Reyes said, \u201cYou guys stop asking me\n. . . kinda questions.\u201d (Elision in original.) \u201cStop[] asking\nthis kind of stuff man.\u201d Wheeler, who had begun the\ninterview by telling Reyes that he could stop at any time, did\nnot stop. He responded to Reyes, \u201cThe only rope that you got\nis me throwing it to you right now and telling you \u2018you gotta\nbe clean\u2019 because you haven\u2019t been. This thing\u2019s gonna burn\nyou down.\u201d\n\f42                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\n    Wheeler persisted, interrupted frequently by the \u201csound\nof sniffing.\u201d Reyes continued to indicate that he did not want\nto talk. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to say man.\u201d Brandt took over the\nquestioning: \u201cOkay, so witnesses identifying you and other\npeople in the car identifying you, . . . you\u2019re good with that?\n. . . You want us to go in there with this two-hour\nconversation of you just lying about where you were when\nyour phone records show it\u2019s not the case and all that stuff,\nyou\u2019re comfortable with that.\u201d Reyes replied, \u201cStop asking\nme man. I don\u2019t know nothing.\u201d\n\n   Brandt terminated the interview, saying, \u201cThis time when\nI walk out I\u2019m not gonna come back and give you another\nshot, okay? We\u2019re gonna, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll go to the D.A.\u2019s office\nand, and then later on to court with the case we have and, and\nI\u2019m, I\u2019m not worried about it, I\u2019m not gonna lose.\u201d Wheeler\nadded, \u201cOh ya, we\u2019re not gonna lose that case.\u201d Brandt said,\n\u201cLast chance.\u201d Reyes responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know nothing\nman.\u201d\n\n    The transcript of the February 9 interview does not\nindicate start and stop times, but it is apparent from Brandt\u2019s\nstatement referring to \u201cthis two-hour conversation,\u201d quoted\nabove, that the interview took about two hours. Brandt\ntestified at Reyes\u2019s preliminary hearing that the interview had\ntaken \u201cforty minutes to an hour,\u201d but his testimony is\ninconsistent with what he himself said during the interview\nand with the length of the transcript. The interview was\ninterrupted thirty-three times by the \u201csound of sniffing.\u201d\n\n    Reyes went to his mother\u2019s house to sleep that night. The\nnext morning, Brandt and Michael Medici, another Riverside\nPolice Department detective, picked up Reyes and took him\nto the San Bernardino County sheriff \u2019s station for a\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                         43\n\npolygraph test. There is no written consent by an adult to the\npolygraph test. Brandt testified at the preliminary hearing\nthat Reyes\u2019s mother gave permission \u201con the phone,\u201d and the\nrecord contains a police report stating that she had given\npermission. No family member accompanied Reyes to the\nsheriff\u2019s station.\n\n    Robert Heard of the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s\nDepartment administered the polygraph test.           Before\nadministering the test, Heard spoke with Reyes for a\nsustained period. He impressed on Reyes the fact that he was\nan experienced test administrator. He recounted that he had\ngone to \u201cpolygraph school\u201d \u201c9 years before you were born,\u201d\nand that he was in high demand as a polygraph teacher. At no\npoint did Heard provide Miranda warnings.\n\n    Reyes had difficulty filling out a form Heard gave him,\nnot knowing his zip code or his height and weight. Reyes had\neven more difficulty with the written consent form. When he\ndid not understand the terms \u201cduress and coercion\u201d and\n\u201cimmunity,\u201d Heard explained them in simpler language.\nReyes had particular trouble understanding what was meant\nby the sentence, \u201cI hereby release the County of San\nBernardino, the Sheriff\u2019s Department and Examiner\nadministering this examination from any and all claims\nresulting from, or arising out of, this examination. . . .\u201d After\nHeard explained what \u201crelease . . . from any and all claims\u201d\nmeant, Reyes said, \u201cAlright, so that, that means like that you\nguys won\u2019t, won\u2019t trick me . . . .\u201d Heard corrected him,\nsaying, \u201cWell, no, this doesn\u2019t say I won\u2019t trick you.\u201d Heard\nthen added, \u201c[Y]ou have my word I won\u2019t trick you.\u201d Heard\nagain explained what \u201crelease\u201d meant, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s what\nit means.\u201d Reyes responded, \u201cLike you haven\u2019t tricked me or\n\f44                    REYES V. LEWIS\n\nsomething.\u201d Heard replied, \u201cExactly, exactly.\u201d           Thus\ninformed, Reyes signed the consent form.\n\n    After administering the test, Heard told Reyes, \u201cYou\nfailed the test. I have no doubt that you were there when\nDerek was shot.\u201d (There is nothing in the record to indicate\nwhether Reyes had in fact failed the test.) Heard pressed\nReyes to give details about what he had done. Reyes asked,\n\u201c[L]ike what\u2019s the truth gonna help?\u201d Heard answered:\n\n       [T]hey read my report and the detectives, their\n       supervisor reads the report. . . . And the\n       District Attorney\u2019s gonna ask these detectives\n       hey, how was Adrian? Is he one of these, you\n       know tough, gang banger type guys[]? No,\n       no. Adrian\u2019s a nice young man. He\n       cooperated, failed the test, and without\n       hesitation he says hey, look, man, I feel bad\n       about what happened. . . . Adrian, I can\u2019t tell\n       you what\u2019s gonna happen because you know\n       what? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t[] know what\u2019s\n       gonna happen because you haven\u2019t told me\n       what happened out there. . . . [Y]ou tell me\n       I\u2019m going to state prison for, I, I, said 25 to\n       life or something like that. Fifteen year olds\n       don\u2019t go to state prison, Adrian.\n\nReyes responded, \u201cI know, but I\u2019ve got a go to Juvenile\nHall.\u201d Heard replied, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna\nhappen because I, you haven\u2019t told me anything yet, Adrian.\u201d\n\n   Heard continued to ask Reyes what happened, and Reyes\nrepeated several times that he did not know. Heard asked\nfrom what side of the car the shooter had shot. Reyes\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                        45\n\nresponded, \u201cOh, not that I know, you know, so don\u2019t ask any\nquestion.\u201d Heard asked, \u201cYou wanna be alone?\u201d Reyes\nreplied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s just, just don\u2019t ask any questions,\u201d and then\nsaid, \u201cCan we just call the detectives?\u201d\n\n    Brandt and Medici then came into the room and took over\nfrom Heard. At no point in the interview that followed did\nthey provide Miranda warnings.\n\n   Brandt asked at the outset, \u201c[W]hat\u2019s your biggest\nconcern, going to jail?\u201d\n\n       Reyes: Think so.\n\n       Brandt: At all or for a long time?\n\n       Reyes: For a long time.\n\n       Brandt: Okay, how long do you think you\n       would go to jail for?\n\n       Reyes: I don\u2019t know. Like it\u2019s a murder,\n       probably like 25 years.\n\n       Brandt: Yeah? How old are you?\n\n       Reyes: 15.\n\n       Brandt: How many 15 year olds do you know\n       that go to jail for 25 years?\n\n       Reyes: None.\n\n       Brandt: Huh?\n\f46                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\n        Reyes: None.\n\n        Brandt: Okay, so why would you be any\n        different?\n\n        Reyes: I don\u2019t know.\n\n    Brandt then asked, \u201cRemember yesterday I asked you . . .\nif Derek had anything in his hands or reached for his pockets,\nanything like that? You remember me asking you that?\u201d\nReyes replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Brandt then told Reyes that Ochoa had\nhad a gun:\n\n        There\u2019s a reason, a very easy explanation to\n        this whole thing. . . . The deal is . . . Derek\n        had a gun in his pocket. . . . Now, if he\u2019s\n        going for a gun in his pocket or you believed\n        he was going for a gun in his pocket and we\n        find one, that\u2019s obviously, and it\u2019s, there\u2019s an\n        explanation as to what happened. Maybe you\n        just stopped and talked to him because you\n        knew him, and then he\u2019s going for a gun or\n        something like that . . . and shit happens.\n\n(Third elision in original.) (Brandt\u2019s statement was false.\nOchoa had not had a gun.)\n\n    Brandt went on, \u201cIf it\u2019s just . . . a cold blooded thing, no,\nwe just, went up and . . . did it and, and shot him just because,\num, and I don\u2019t feel bad about it . . . that looks bad.\u201d Reyes\nsaid, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d Brandt said, \u201cTell me, tell me why,\nhow did it happen then?\u201d Reyes hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\nman. . . . Make everybody go to prison and everything, like I\nwant everybody to get locked up.\u201d Brandt responded, \u201c[I]f\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                        47\n\nhe\u2019s going for a gun, dude, . . . that\u2019s gotta be explained. We\nhave to know that and we have to be able to tell the District\nAttorney\u2019s office that . . . .\u201d Reyes still hesitated. After\nencouragement from Brandt, he finally said, \u201cUm hmm,\nhmm, well, he, you, he always had a gun.\u201d\n\n    After more encouragement, Reyes said, \u201cHe was just\nrunning up to the car.\u201d Brandt asked, \u201cOkay, was he reaching\nfor his pockets or anything like that?\u201d Reyes replied, \u201cYeah.\u201d\nBrandt said, \u201cOkay, and what happened?\u201d Reyes replied, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know.\u201d Reyes expressed concern about his older\ncousin, Andres Munoz, and sought to exculpate him. \u201cWell,\nif I say something like what\u2019s going to happen with my\ncousin? Is he still gonna go to jail? . . . He had nothing to do\nwith it.\u201d\n\n   Brandt asked, \u201cDid you shoot him because you thought he\nwas going for a gun? Yeah? Did you . . . see the gun in his\npocket?\u201d\n\n       Reyes: He was reaching for it.\n\n       Brandt: Okay . . . and then what happened?\n\n       Reyes: He had a grip on it.\n\n       Brandt: Okay, do you remember . . . what\n       pocket it was in, what side it was in? Okay,\n       do you remember seeing the grip of the gun\n       though? And he was reaching for it? But\n       what was he yelling at you guys?\n\f48                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\n        Reyes: I don\u2019t know. It was just, I wasn\u2019t\n        panicked . . . ain\u2019t gonna say nothing, just\n        scared.\n\n        Brandt: You were scared cause he was going\n        for the gun? And then, and what happened?\n\n        Reyes: I don\u2019t know. I just shot.\n\n    Reyes\u2019s statement that he had shot Ochoa came early in\nthe interview, on the seventh page of the transcript. Brandt\nand Medici continued to question and talk to Reyes for\nanother thirty-five pages. Much of the later exchange was\nfriendly, even including a discussion of Christmas. Reyes\nsaid that his family opens presents at \u201ctwelve in the night.\u201d\nBrandt responded, \u201cOh, see I can\u2019t stay up that late,\u201d and\nReyes laughed. Near the end of the interview, Medici asked,\n\u201cDoes your Mom know about any of this, your Dad?\u201d Reyes\nresponded, \u201cIt\u2019ll be cool like if you guys don\u2019t tell my Mom,\nyou know, cause . . . [l]ike it\u2019ll break her heart and shit, you\nknow, cause like she\u2019s very religious.\u201d Brandt told Reyes,\n\u201cOh, we don\u2019t need to run over there.\u201d\n\n    Immediately after the February 10 interview at the San\nBernardino sheriff\u2019s station, Brandt drove Reyes back to the\nRiverside police station where he and Wheeler had\ninterviewed him the day before. The length of the drive is not\nin the record, but it is apparent from a map of the area that it\nwas no more than fifteen miles. When they arrived at the\nRiverside police station, Reyes was put in an interview room.\n\n   Brandt and Medici together questioned Reyes. Brandt\nbegan the interview:\n\f                     REYES V. LEWIS                      49\n\n       OK. Uuh, we talked to people at the D.A.\u2019s\n       office and stuff about the case. Kinda told\n       them that, you know, you came clean and\n       finally told us the truth and why things\n       happened and, you know that you were, you\n       know, obviously scared and all that kind of\n       stuff. Uuh, there\u2019s more questions that they\n       want answered, if we can. OK, just to, to\n       clarify stuff. Alright, so I wanna talk to you\n       again, but because you\u2019ve been sitting in that\n       room and the door was locked and you\u2019re not\n       free to leave, I wanna read you your rights,\n       OK? And then ask you some questions. OK?\n       You have the right to remain silent. Anything\n       you say can and will be used against you in a\n       court of law. You have the right to talk to a\n       lawyer and have him present with you while\n       you\u2019re being questioned. If you cannot afford\n       to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to\n       represent you before any questioning. Do you\n       understand each of these rights that I\u2019ve\n       explained to you? Yeah? OK. Can we talk\n       about the stuff we talked about earlier today?\n       Is that a yes?\n\nReyes, who had not previously spoken, answered, \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n    Under questioning from Brandt, Reyes repeated his\nconfession. At the end of the interview, Reyes said, \u201cLet me\ncall my mom.\u201d Medici then handcuffed Reyes before taking\nhim to McDonald\u2019s to get something to eat.\n\n   The total elapsed time, from when Brandt picked up\nReyes at his mother\u2019s house on February 10 until the\n\f50                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nconclusion of the interview at the Riverside police station on\nthe same day, was somewhere between five and six hours.\nBrandt testified at Reyes\u2019s preliminary hearing that he picked\nup Reyes at approximately 9:00 am to drive him to the San\nBernardino sheriff\u2019s station. He estimated that Reyes then\nspent about three hours at that station, including both his\npolygraph test with Heard and his post-polygraph interview\nwith Brandt and Medici. During the suppression hearing, the\nstate represented that Reyes spent four hours at the San\nBernardino sheriff\u2019s station. Brandt then drove Reyes to the\nRiverside police station for the second interview with Brandt\nand Medici. Brandt estimated that the second interview took\nbetween forty minutes and an hour. There is nothing in the\nrecord to indicate that Reyes had anything to eat until Medici\ntook him to McDonald\u2019s for a late lunch at the conclusion of\nthe interview at the Riverside police station.\n\n                II. Prior Judicial Proceedings\n\n    Reyes and his cousin Andres Munoz were charged in\nCalifornia Superior Court with first-degree murder. They\nwere tried before the same judge with separate juries. Reyes\nmoved to suppress his confession as having been obtained in\nviolation of Miranda. The judge concluded that Reyes\u2019s\nFebruary 10 post-polygraph confession at the San Bernardino\nsheriff\u2019s station was voluntary but that he had been in custody\nwithin the meaning of Miranda when he made the statement.\nThe judge therefore suppressed the unwarned post-polygraph\nstatement at the sheriff\u2019s station due to a Miranda violation.\nHowever, the judge refused to suppress Reyes\u2019s postwarning\nconfession at the Riverside police station.\n\n    At trial, there was inconsistent evidence about the identity\nof the shooter. Except for Reyes\u2019s postwarning confession,\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                        51\n\nthe evidence largely pointed to Reyes\u2019s cousin, Munoz, who\nhad been the driver of the car, rather than Reyes, who had\nbeen a passenger.\n\n    A friend of both Ochoa and Reyes testified that Reyes had\nbeen in the back seat, on the passenger side, of a silver car on\nthe afternoon of the shooting. An eyewitness to the shooting\ntestified that she saw the driver of a silver Camry get out of\nthe car and shoot Ochoa. She made an in-court identification\nof the driver as Munoz. Another eyewitness agreed with this\naccount. She testified that the driver got out of the car,\nwalked toward Ochoa, shot Ochoa, and \u201ccontinue[d] shooting\nuntil he couldn\u2019t anymore.\u201d She testified that the back door\non the driver\u2019s side was opened, but that no one got out of the\nback seat. She was unable to identify the shooter, either\nwhen shown photographs shortly after the shooting, or in the\ncourtroom.\n\n     Another witness testified that he heard gunshots as he was\npulling out of his father\u2019s driveway. He pulled back into the\ndriveway and got out of the car to look. He testified that he\nsaw someone get out of the back seat on the passenger side\nand come around to the driver\u2019s side. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\nactually went to check on the kid [who had been shot] or . . .\nwhat else happened. . . . [I]t just happened so quick.\u201d He\nestimated that the time between the shots being fired and the\nperson getting out of the back passenger seat \u201cwasn\u2019t\nlong\u201d\u2014\u201c[m]aybe a couple of seconds.\u201d Yet another witness,\na friend of Ochoa\u2019s, testified that he was on the front porch of\na friend\u2019s house when he heard shots. His view was obscured\nby cacti, so he \u201cstarted walking toward the front yard.\u201d \u201cWe\nwere going towards [Ochoa], and that\u2019s when we saw the guy\nshooting at him. But I only saw when he just went inside the\ncar, like turned around inside the car and yelled out \u2018Delhi.\u2019\u201d\n\f52                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nHe testified that there were five people in the car and that it\nwas \u201clight brown.\u201d He testified that he saw only one person\nget into the car, and that this person got into the back seat on\nthe driver\u2019s side.\n\n    The jury returned a verdict finding Reyes guilty of first-\ndegree murder with gang and firearm enhancements. The\njudge sentenced Reyes to fifty years to life in prison: twenty-\nfive years to life for the murder conviction to be served\nconsecutively with a twenty-five years to life sentence for the\nfirearm enhancement. The court stayed sentencing on the\ntwo gang enhancements.\n\n    Reyes appealed. Citing Seibert, Reyes claimed, inter alia,\nthat the trial court had erred in admitting his February 10\nconfession at the Riverside police station, after he had\nreceived Miranda warnings. The Court of Appeal agreed\nwith the trial judge\u2019s suppression of Reyes\u2019s unwarned post-\npolygraph statement at the San Bernardino sheriff\u2019s office.\nThe court wrote that it was \u201cnot disputed\u201d that Reyes was in\ncustody at the time he made the statement, and that this\nstatement was thus obtained in violation of Miranda. The\nCourt of Appeal nonetheless affirmed Reyes\u2019s conviction,\nholding that his subsequent, warned confession at the\nRiverside police station was admissible.\n\n    In the view of the Court of Appeal, the \u201coperative\nquestion\u201d was whether Reyes\u2019s post-polygraph unwarned and\ncustodial statement had been voluntary. The Court of Appeal\nwrote:\n\n          The issue on appeal is whether the trial\n       court erred in allowing defendant\u2019s\n       subsequent statements made at the Riverside\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                        53\n\n       police station after defendant was advised of\n       his Miranda rights. The operative question is\n       thus whether defendant was subjected to\n       coercion within the meaning of the Fifth and\n       Fourteenth Amendments when he was\n       interrogated at the sheriff\u2019s station and, if so,\n       whether his statements made thereafter at the\n       Riverside police station were the tainted\n       product of the earlier statements.\n\n           ...\n\n           We thus will consider whether the trial\n       court erred in finding that defendant\u2019s\n       statements were voluntary.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n    The Court of Appeal then spent nine pages analyzing in\ndetail what had taken place during the post-polygraph\nunwarned custodial interview at the police station, concluding\nthat the \u201ctrial court had properly ruled defendant\u2019s statements,\nboth at the sheriff\u2019s station and thereafter at the Riverside\npolice station, were voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\nIn the view of the Court of Appeal, because Reyes\u2019s\nunwarned statements while in custody at the sheriff\u2019s station\nhad been voluntary, his later postwarning statements at the\npolice station were necessarily \u201clikewise volitional.\u201d The\nCourt of Appeal dismissed Reyes\u2019s argument under Seibert\nin a single paragraph, on the ground that his statement at the\nRiverside police station had been \u201cvolitional\u201d:\n\n           Since defendant\u2019s statements made at the\n       sheriff\u2019s station were voluntary, his waiver of\n\f54                    REYES V. LEWIS\n\n       Miranda rights at the Riverside police station\n       and statements made thereafter were likewise\n       volitional. Unlike in Missouri v. Seibert[,\n       542 U.S. 600, 617 (2004)], the circumstances\n       in the instant case need not \u201cbe seen as\n       challenging the comprehensibility and\n       efficacy of the Miranda warnings to the point\n       that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes\n       would not have understood them to convey a\n       message that [he] retained a choice about\n       continuing to talk.\u201d\n\n(Second alteration in original.)\n\n    Reyes filed a state habeas petition contemporaneously\nwith his direct appeal. The Court of Appeal declined to\nconsolidate the petition and the appeal, summarily denying\nthe petition in a one-sentence order. The California Supreme\nCourt summarily denied both Reyes\u2019s direct appeal and his\nhabeas petition.\n\n    Reyes timely filed a petition for federal habeas corpus\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. In his Report and Recommendation,\nthe magistrate judge devoted most of his analysis to whether\nReyes\u2019s postwarning Riverside police station confession was\ncoerced. He concluded under the deferential standard of the\nAnti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d)\nthat the Court of Appeal had not been unreasonable in\nconcluding that the confession was not coerced. He\ndismissed Reyes\u2019s Seibert argument in a footnote, concluding\nthat there was no evidence that the law enforcement officers\ndeliberately employed the two-step method of interrogation\ncondemned in that case. The district court adopted without\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                       55\n\ncomment or correction the conclusions and recommendations\nof the magistrate judge.\n\n    Reyes timely appealed. Prior to oral argument, we asked\nthe parties to provide supplemental briefs on Seibert and its\napplication to the facts of this case.\n\n                  III. Standard of Review\n\n   We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny\nReyes\u2019s habeas petition. Martinez-Villareal v. Lewis, 80 F.3d\n1301, 1305 (9th Cir. 1996).\n\n    Under AEDPA, we may not grant an application for a writ\nof habeas corpus for a state prisoner with respect to any claim\nadjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state\nadjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\ninvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \u201cresulted in a\ndecision that was based on an unreasonable determination of\nthe facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding,\u201d id. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). \u201c[C]learly established Federal\nlaw\u201d includes only governing legal principles established by\nthe United States Supreme Court at the time the state decision\nwas rendered. Greene v. Fisher, 132 S. Ct. 38, 44 (2011).\n\n    A state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly\nestablished federal law if it applies a rule that contradicts\ngoverning Supreme Court precedent or it decides a case\ndifferently than the Supreme Court has on a set of materially\nindistinguishable facts. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362,\n405\u201307, 413 (2000). A state court decision is an\n\u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law\n\f56                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\n\u201cif the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule\n. . . but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular\nstate prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d White v. Woodall, 134 S. Ct. 1697,\n1705 (2014) (quoting Williams, 529 U.S. at 407\u201308).\n\n     \u201cA state-court decision will certainly be contrary to . . .\nclearly established precedent if the state court applies a rule\nthat contradicts the governing law set forth in [Supreme\nCourt] cases.\u201d Williams, 529 U.S. at 405; see also Early v.\nPacker, 537 U.S. 3, 8 (2002) (per curiam) (\u201cAvoiding [a\n\u2018contrary to\u2019 error] does not require citation of [Supreme\nCourt] cases\u2014indeed, it does not even require awareness of\n[Supreme Court] cases, so long as neither the reasoning nor\nthe result of the state-court decision contradicts them.\u201d);\nFrantz v.

If a state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1), a federal habeas court does\nnot owe deference under AEDPA to that decision. Frantz,\n533 F.3d at 739; cf. Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 948\n(2007) (stating this rule for \u201cunreasonable application\u201d error).\nIf a \u201ccontrary to\u201d error is identified, then \u201cwe must decide the\nhabeas petition by considering de novo the constitutional\nissues raised.\u201d Frantz, 533 F.3d at 735.\n\n    We may also grant a writ of habeas corpus in cases where\nthe state-court decision \u201cwas based on an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented\nin the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). We\n\u201cmay not second-guess a state court\u2019s fact-finding process\nunless, after review of the state-court record, [we]\n\f                      REYES V. LEWIS                       57\n\ndetermine[] that the state court was not merely wrong, but\nactually unreasonable.\u201d Taylor v. Maddox, 366 F.3d 992, 999\n(9th Cir. 2004). To grant relief under this prong, \u201cwe must be\nconvinced that an appellate panel, applying the normal\nstandards of appellate review, could not reasonably conclude\nthat the finding is supported by the record.\u201d Id. at 1000.\n\n    The relevant state court decision for purposes of AEDPA\nreview is the last reasoned state court decision. Ylst v.\nNunnemaker, 501 U.S. 797, 804\u201306 (1991); Medley v.\nRunnels, 506 F.3d 857, 862 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc). Here,\nthat decision is the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision on\ndirect review of Reyes\u2019s conviction. See Nunnemaker,\n501 U.S. at 805\u201306.\n\n                       IV. Discussion\n\n    Reyes makes two arguments. First, he argues that his\npostwarning Riverside police station confession on February\n10 was coerced in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Second,\nhe argues that this confession was admitted in violation of\nSeibert. For the reasons that follow, we agree with Reyes\u2019s\nsecond argument. We therefore do not need to reach his first\nargument.\n\n                     A. \u201cContrary To\u201d\n\n   As the Supreme Court explained in Oregon v. Elstad,\n470 U.S. 298, 304 (1985), \u201c[p]rior to Miranda, the\nadmissibility of an accused\u2019s in-custody statements was\njudged solely by whether they were \u2018voluntary\u2019 within the\nmeaning of the Due Process Clause.\u201d That is, the pre-\nMiranda exclusionary rule analysis was simply a Due Process\nClause voluntariness inquiry. Miranda fundamentally altered\n\f58                    REYES V. LEWIS\n\nthe analysis: \u201cThe Miranda Court . . . presumed that\ninterrogation in certain custodial circumstances is inherently\ncoercive and held that statements made under those\ncircumstances are inadmissible unless the suspect is\nspecifically informed of his Miranda rights and freely decides\nto forgo those rights.\u201d New York v. Quarles, 467 U.S. 649,\n654 (1984) (footnote omitted). The Court was concerned in\nMiranda that its \u201c\u2018traditional totality-of-the-circumstances\u2019\ntest posed an \u2018unacceptably great\u2019 risk that involuntary\ncustodial confessions would escape detection.\u201d Seibert,\n542 U.S. at 608 (quoting Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S.\n428, 444 (2000)). The Court therefore held in Miranda that\nfinding a statement had been \u201cvoluntary\u201d would no longer be\nsufficient. The Court explained, \u201cFailure to administer\nMiranda warnings creates a presumption of compulsion.\nConsequently, unwarned statements that are otherwise\nvoluntary within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment must\nnevertheless be excluded from evidence under Miranda.\u201d\nElstad, 470 U.S. at 307 (emphasis added). Miranda and later\ncases thus clearly establish that the voluntariness of an\nunwarned statement during a custodial interrogation is not\nsufficient to establish the statement\u2019s admissibility.\n\n    Miranda was decided in 1966. By the time the Court\ndecided Seibert in 2004, \u201cMiranda warnings\u201d had taken on\nnear-talismanic significance, almost guaranteeing\nadmissibility of a warned statement. Justice Souter wrote in\nSeibert that \u201cgiving the warnings and getting a waiver has\ngenerally produced a virtual ticket of admissibility;\nmaintaining that a statement is involuntary even though given\nafter warnings and voluntary waiver of rights requires\nunusual stamina, and litigation over voluntariness tends to\nend with the finding of a valid waiver.\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at\n608\u201309 (Souter, J., plurality opinion). In Elstad, the Court\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                       59\n\nhad held that an unwarned voluntary custodial confession\nfollowed by a voluntary warned confession did not require\nthe exclusion of the second, warned confession. But in\nSeibert, the Court limited its holding in Elstad. The Court in\nSeibert recognized that \u201c[t]he technique of interrogating in\nsuccessive, unwarned and warned phases,\u201d was a \u201cnew\nchallenge to Miranda\u201d that Elstad had not resolved. Id. at\n609 (Souter, J., plurality opinion); see also id. at 618\n(Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment).\n\n    In Seibert, a police officer in Rolla, Missouri, conducted\nan unwarned custodial interrogation of Seibert that was\n\u201csystematic, exhaustive, and managed with psychological\nskill.\u201d Id. at 616. The unwarned custodial interrogation\nproduced a confession. The officer then gave Seibert a\ntwenty-minute coffee and cigarette break. After the break, he\nread Seibert her Miranda warnings, and she signed a written\nwaiver. The officer then resumed questioning, reminding\nSeibert of her prior prewarning statements. Id. at 605. The\nofficer later \u201ctestified that he made a \u2018conscious decision\u2019 to\nwithhold Miranda warnings, thus resorting to an interrogation\ntechnique he had been taught: question first, then give the\nwarnings, and then repeat the question \u2018until I get the answer\nthat she\u2019s already provided once.\u2019\u201d Id. at 605\u201306. The\nSeibert plurality wrote, with some understatement, that the\nuse of this two-step interrogation technique \u201c[wa]s not\nconfined to Rolla, Missouri.\u201d Id. at 609. Indeed, as the\nplurality noted, its use had been promoted and endorsed by\nnational police training organizations including the Police\nLaw Institute. Id. at 609\u201310.\n\n    Justice Souter observed in his plurality opinion in Seibert\nthat the purpose of the two-step interrogation technique was\n\u201cto render Miranda warnings ineffective by waiting for a\n\f60                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nparticularly opportune time to give them, after the suspect has\nalready confessed.\u201d Id. at 611. He concluded:\n\n       It would have been reasonable to regard the\n       two sessions as parts of a continuum, in which\n       it would have been unnatural to refuse to\n       repeat at the second stage what had been said\n       before. These circumstances must be seen as\n       challenging the comprehensibility and\n       efficacy of the Miranda warnings to the point\n       that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes\n       would not have understood them to convey a\n       message that she retained a choice about\n       continuing to talk.\n\nId. at 616\u201317. In a footnote appended to this passage, Justice\nSouter made clear that if a two-step interrogation technique\nviolated Miranda, the voluntariness of the postwarning\nstatement is irrelevant. In that circumstance, even a voluntary\npostwarning statement must be suppressed. Justice Souter\nwrote, \u201cBecause we find that the warnings were inadequate,\nthere is no need to assess the actual voluntariness of the\nstatement.\u201d Id. at 617 n.8.\n\n    Concurring, Justice Kennedy agreed with Justice Souter\nthat, if deliberately employed, a two-part interrogation\ntechnique presented \u201cdifferent considerations\u201d from earlier\nMiranda cases. Id. at 620 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the\njudgment). While Justice Kennedy\u2019s fifth-vote concurrence\nnarrowed Seibert\u2019s holding to \u201cthose cases involving\ndeliberate use of the two-step procedure to weaken\nMiranda\u2019s protections,\u201d United States v. Williams, 435 F.3d\n1148, 1157\u201358 (9th Cir. 2006) (emphasis added), the plurality\nand Justice Kennedy agreed that even a voluntary\n\f                      REYES V. LEWIS                      61\n\npostwarning confession must be excluded where law\nenforcement officials deliberately withheld Miranda\nwarnings until after obtaining an in-custody confession, and\nwhere insufficient curative measures had been taken to ensure\nthat the suspect understood the meaning and importance of\nthe previously withheld warnings.\n\n   Justice Kennedy wrote:\n\n           The plurality concludes that whenever a\n       two-stage interview occurs, admissibility of\n       the postwarning statement should depend on\n       \u201cwhether [the] Miranda warnings delivered\n       midstream could have been effective enough\n       to accomplish their object\u201d given the specific\n       facts of the case. . . . I would apply a\n       narrower test applicable only in the infrequent\n       case, such as we have here, in which the two-\n       step interrogation technique was used in a\n       calculated way to undermine the Miranda\n       warning.\n\n           The admissibility of postwarning\n       statements should continue to be governed by\n       the principles of Elstad unless the deliberate\n       two-step strategy was employed. If the\n       deliberate two-step strategy has been used,\n       postwarning statements that are related to the\n       substance of prewarning statements must be\n       excluded unless curative measures are taken\n       before the postwarning statement is made.\n       Curative measures should be designed to\n       ensure that a reasonable person in the\n       suspect\u2019s situation would understand the\n\f62                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\n        import and effect of the Miranda warning and\n        of the Miranda waiver. For example, a\n        substantial break in time and circumstances\n        between the prewarning statement and the\n        Miranda warning may suffice in most\n        circumstances, as it allows the accused to\n        distinguish the two contexts and appreciate\n        that the interrogation has taken a new turn.\n        Alternatively, an additional warning that\n        explains the likely inadmissibility of the\n        prewarning custodial statement may be\n        sufficient.\n\nId. at 621\u201322 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment)\n(internal citations omitted).\n\n    We take as \u201cclearly established\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2254\nthe \u201cnarrowest\u201d opinion in a fractured majority. See Marks\nv. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977); see also Panetti,\n551 U.S. at 949. In United States v. Davis, \u2014 F.3d \u2014, 2016\nWL 3245043, at *5 (9th Cir. June 13, 2016) (en banc), we\ninterpreted Marks as requiring us to analyze \u201cwhether the\nreasoning of a narrower opinion fit[s] entirely into the circle\ndrawn by a broader opinion.\u201d Stated differently, a fractured\nSupreme Court opinion binds us \u201conly . . . when a majority of\nthe Justices agree upon a single underlying rationale and one\nopinion can reasonably be described as a logical subset of the\nother.\u201d Id.\n\n    Previously, in Williams, we applied Marks to hold that the\nrule established in Seibert is to be found by looking at Justice\nSouter\u2019s plurality opinion for four justices, together with\nJustice Kennedy\u2019s narrower concurring opinion. 435 F.3d at\n1157. In Davis, we cited with approval our earlier opinion in\n\f                        REYES V. LEWIS                         63\n\nWilliams. Davis, 2016 WL 3245043, at *5. Justice Souter\u2019s\nplurality opinion requires suppression only where officers\nemploy a two-step technique that renders the Miranda\nwarnings ineffective. His opinion does not require a\ndeliberate intent to employ the forbidden two-step technique.\nJustice Kennedy largely agreed with the plurality, but wrote\nthat he would add one criterion before finding a Seibert\nviolation. Justice Kennedy wrote, \u201cIn my view, [the\nplurality\u2019s] test cuts too broadly. . . . I would apply a narrower\ntest[.]\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at 622 (Kennedy, J., concurring in\nthe judgment). In Justice Kennedy\u2019s view, an interrogating\nofficer not only must employ the two-step technique\ncondemned by the plurality; he or she must also do so\n\u201cdeliberately.\u201d Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence, based on a\nrationale narrowing the result reached by the plurality in\nSeibert, thus constitutes \u201cclearly established\u201d law for the\npurpose of AEDPA review.\n\n     Under Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence, a postwarning\nstatement must be suppressed if interrogating officers\ndeliberately use the two-step interrogation technique that was\nused in Seibert, and if effective curative measures are not\ntaken to ensure that the suspect genuinely understood the\nMiranda warnings. In the words of Justice Kennedy, quoted\nabove, \u201c[c]urative measures should be designed to ensure that\na reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s situation would\nunderstand the import and effect of the Miranda warning and\nof the Miranda waiver.\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at 622 (Kennedy,\nJ., concurring in the judgment).\n\n    The California Court of Appeal did not understand\nSeibert. In the view of the Court of Appeal, the \u201coperative\nquestion\u201d under Miranda was whether Reyes\u2019s unwarned\npost-polygraph custodial statement at the San Bernardino\n\f64                    REYES V. LEWIS\n\nsheriff\u2019s station had been voluntary. According to the Court\nof Appeal, if that statement had been voluntary, his later\nMirandized statement at the San Bernardino police station\nwas necessarily \u201clikewise volitional.\u201d The Court of Appeal\nspent nine pages addressing the voluntariness of Reyes\u2019s\nunwarned post-polygraph custodial statement at the San\nBernardino sheriff\u2019s station. For the Court of Appeal, the\nvoluntariness of that statement determined the admissibility\nof the subsequent warned statement at the Riverside police\nstation. The Court of Appeal addressed Seibert in a single\nparagraph.\n\n    We quoted that paragraph above, but we reproduce it\nhere, in its entirety, for the convenience of the reader:\n\n           Since defendant\u2019s statements made at the\n       sheriff\u2019s station were voluntary, his waiver of\n       Miranda rights at the Riverside police station\n       and statements made thereafter were likewise\n       volitional. Unlike in Missouri v. Seibert[,\n       542 U.S. 600, 617 (2004)], the circumstances\n       in the instant case need not \u201cbe seen as\n       challenging the comprehensibility and\n       efficacy of the Miranda warnings to the point\n       that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes\n       would not have understood them to convey a\n       message that [he] retained a choice about\n       continuing to talk.\u201d\n\n(Alteration in original.) The first sentence of the paragraph\nrecites the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that Reyes\u2019s\npostwarning statement was \u201cvolitional.\u201d The second sentence\nstates that, unlike in Seibert, Reyes \u201cretained a choice about\ncontinuing to talk.\u201d That is, in the Court of Appeal\u2019s view,\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                       65\n\nbecause Reyes \u201cretained a choice,\u201d his \u201ccontinuing to talk\u201d\nwas voluntary.\n\n    The clearly established rule under Seibert is that if\nofficers deliberately employ the two-step technique employed\nin Seibert, and if insufficient curative measures are taken to\nensure that later Miranda warnings are genuinely understood,\nany warned statement thereby obtained must be suppressed,\neven if the statement is voluntary. Contrary to Seibert, the\nCourt of Appeal did not address the question whether the\nofficers deliberately employed the two-step technique. Also\ncontrary to Seibert, the Court of Appeal did not address the\nadequacy, or even existence, of any \u201ccurative measures.\u201d\nInstead, the Court of Appeal analyzed at length the\ncoerciveness surrounding Reyes\u2019s post-polygraph unwarned\ncustodial statement at the San Bernardino sheriff\u2019s station and\nconcluded that because his confession was voluntary his\nsubsequent warned statement at the Riverside police station\nwas also voluntary.\n\n    Under the circumstances of this case\u2014where police\ninterrogated fifteen-year-old Reyes over the course of two\ndays; where on the first day at the Riverside police station\nthey conducted a two-hour unwarned interrogation; where on\nthe second day at the San Bernardino sheriff\u2019s station they\nobtained a confession during an unwarned interrogation\nfollowing an unwarned custodial polygraph test; and where\nthey transported Reyes back to the Riverside police station\nand obtained a postwarning confession \u201cclarifying\u201d what he\nhad stated at the sheriff\u2019s station\u2014a Seibert analysis was\nclearly required.\n\n   Contrary to Seibert, the Court of Appeal did not conduct\nsuch an analysis. Instead, the Court of Appeal examined only\n\f66                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nwhether Reyes\u2019s statement in his post-polygraph custodial\ninterrogation was voluntary. It wrote, as a prelude to its\nanalysis, that the \u201coperative question\u201d was voluntariness:\n\u201cWe thus will consider whether the trial court erred in finding\nthat defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary.\u201d              Upon\ndetermining that Reyes\u2019s unwarned statements were\nvoluntary, the Court of Appeal concluded that Reyes\u2019s later\nwarned statement at the Riverside police station was\nnecessarily \u201clikewise volitional.\u201d The Court of Appeal then\naffirmed the trial court\u2019s decision not to suppress Reyes\u2019s\npostwarning statement. The Court of Appeal thus addressed,\nand treated as dispositive, the question whether Reyes\u2019s\npostwarning statement was voluntary, which is precisely the\nquestion that is irrelevant under Seibert.\n\n    We therefore conclude that the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision\nwas \u201ccontrary to . . . clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by the Supreme Court,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).\nBecause its decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d Seibert, we owe it no\ndeference.\n\n    On habeas review, the federal magistrate judge\nrecommended denying relief, rejecting in a footnote Reyes\u2019s\nargument under Seibert. The magistrate judge correctly\nunderstood the rule in Seibert but concluded without analysis\nof the evidence that the law enforcement officers in this case\nhad not deliberately employed the two-step interrogation\nprocess. Deliberateness is a factual finding that we review\nfor clear error. United States v. Narvaez-Gomez, 489 F.3d\n970, 974 (9th Cir. 2007); McClure v. Thompson, 323 F.3d\n1233, 1240 (9th Cir. 2003) (applying clear error review to\nfindings of fact made by a district court on AEDPA review).\nClear error review requires us to form a \u201cdefinite and firm\nconviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d Easley v.\n\f                       REYES V.

A more searching review is appropriate\nwhere the trial court\u2019s decision was based on documents, as\nit was here, rather than credibility evaluations. See id. at 243\n(\u201c[T]he key evidence consisted primarily of documents and\nexpert testimony. Credibility determinations played a minor\nrole. Accordingly, we find that an extensive review of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s findings, for clear error, is warranted.\u201d); Bose\nCorp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485,\n500\u201301 (1984) (\u201cThe same \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard\napplies to findings based on documentary evidence as to\nthose based entirely on oral testimony, but the presumption\nhas lesser force in the former situation than in the latter.\u201d\n(internal citation omitted)).\n\n    We conclude that the magistrate judge, and the district\ncourt in entering judgment based on the recommendation of\nthe magistrate judge, clearly erred. We wrote in Williams\nthat evidence of deliberateness in a Seibert inquiry can be\neither objective or subjective. \u201c[I]n determining whether the\ninterrogator deliberately withheld the Miranda warning,\ncourts should consider whether objective evidence and any\navailable subjective evidence, such as an officer\u2019s testimony,\nsupport an inference that the two-step interrogation procedure\nwas used to undermine the Miranda warning.\u201d 435 F.3d at\n1158. The absence of direct evidence of subjective intent is\nnot dispositive. United States v. Capers, 627 F.3d 470, 479\n(2d Cir. 2010). As we have recognized, \u201cthe most plausible\nreason\u201d for delaying Miranda warnings until after a suspect\nhas confessed \u201cis an illegitimate one, which is the\ninterrogator\u2019s desire to weaken the warning\u2019s effectiveness,\u201d\nsee Williams, 435 F.3d at 1159, and \u201cthe intent of the officer\nwill rarely be as candidly admitted as it was [in Seibert].\u201d Id.\n\f68                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nat 1158 (quoting Seibert, 542 U.S. at 617 n.6 (Souter, J.,\nplurality opinion)).\n\n    In Williams, we provided a nonexhaustive list of\nprobative objective evidence of deliberateness. Such\nevidence includes \u201cthe timing, setting and completeness of\nthe prewarning interrogation, the continuity of police\npersonnel and the overlapping content of the pre- and\npostwarning statements.\u201d Id. at 1159; see also United States\nv.

Briones, 390 F.3d 610, 614 (8th\nCir. 2004).\n\n    Based on the objective evidence in this case, we conclude\nthat Brandt and his fellow officers deliberately employed the\ntwo-step interrogation technique condemned in Seibert, and\nthat the magistrate judge and the district court clearly erred in\nconcluding otherwise. Reyes first confessed in the unwarned\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                       69\n\ncustodial interrogation conducted by Brandt and Medici at the\nSan Bernardino sheriff\u2019s station on February 10, after Heard\ntold Reyes that he had failed the polygraph test. The\nCalifornia Court of Appeal wrote that it is \u201cnot disputed\u201d that\nReyes was in custody during this interrogation. Because the\ninterrogation was custodial, both the trial judge and\nCalifornia Court of Appeal concluded that this unwarned\nconfession at the San Bernardino sheriff\u2019s station was\nobtained in violation of Miranda.             This unwarned\ninterrogation, as well as the unwarned interrogation the\nprevious day at the Riverside police station, were, like the\ninterrogation in Seibert, \u201csystematic, exhaustive, and\nmanaged with psychological skill.\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at 616.\n\n    In the unwarned custodial interrogation at the San\nBernardino sheriff\u2019s station, Brandt and Medici obtained\nstatements from Reyes admitting that he shot Ochoa;\nproviding the outline of the events that occurred that\nafternoon; providing information about how Reyes obtained\nthe gun used in the shooting and what happened to it\nafterward; and providing details about the shooting. In the\nwarned interrogation at the Riverside police station that\nfollowed, Reyes provided essentially the same information.\n\n    The three Riverside police officers involved in the\ncase\u2014Brandt, Wheeler and Medici\u2014were all experienced\nofficers. Cf. Capers, 627 F.3d at 481 (\u201cInexperience, while\nnot a legitimate excuse for postponing a Miranda warning,\nnevertheless may save a confession from exclusion under\nSeibert.\u201d). All three were homicide detectives. At the time\nof the interrogations, Brandt had been a police officer in\nCalifornia for twelve years and a homicide detective for the\nlast four. The tenure of Wheeler and Medici is not specified\n\f70                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nin the record, but we may infer from their ranks that they both\nhad substantial experience.\n\n    Brandt did not take \u201ccurative measures\u201d to ensure that\nReyes understood \u201cthe import and effect of the Miranda\nwarning and of the Miranda waiver.\u201d Seibert, 542 U.S. at\n622 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment). Indeed, he\ndid quite the opposite. Brandt was the lead investigator. He\nwas involved in the case from beginning to end. Brandt\nasked Reyes to accompany him to the Riverside police station\non the morning of February 9 after the SWAT team had\nentered Reyes\u2019s aunt\u2019s house and placed him in handcuffs.\nBrandt and Wheeler questioned Reyes at the police station for\nabout two hours that day. During that interview, Brandt\nasked Reyes if he would be willing to take a polygraph\nexamination. Brandt picked Reyes up at his mother\u2019s house\nthe next morning and took him to the San Bernardino\nsheriff\u2019s station for the examination. After Heard told Reyes\nthat he had failed the polygraph examination, Brandt and\nMedici came into the room and took over from Heard.\nDuring the unwarned custodial interview at the San\nBernardino sheriff\u2019s station on February 10, Brandt and\nMedici obtained a detailed confession from Reyes. After\nobtaining the confession, Brandt immediately drove Reyes\ndirectly to the Riverside police station, where he and Wheeler\nhad questioned him the day before. On arrival at the\nRiverside station, Brandt and Medici questioned Reyes again.\nAt the beginning of this interview, Brandt finally provided\nMiranda warnings. During this interview, Reyes gave Brandt\nand Medici the same detailed confessions he had just given.\n\n    Brandt and Medici had obtained the incriminating\ninformation from Reyes very early in the unwarned custodial\ninterrogation at the sheriff\u2019s station, on the seventh page of\n\f                      REYES V. LEWIS                       71\n\nthe transcript. Yet they continued questioning and talking to\nReyes for another thirty-five pages. They did so in a\nnonconfrontational, sympathetic way, with the result that\nReyes was made to feel sufficiently comfortable that he\ntalked about his family\u2019s Christmas rituals and laughed when\nBrandt said he could not stay up late enough to open presents.\nAt the end of the session, Reyes even asked Brandt and\nMedici not to tell his mother what he had confessed to them:\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be cool like if you guys don\u2019t tell my Mom.\u201d\n\n    At the beginning of the follow-up questioning at the\nRiverside police station, Brandt gave Reyes the Miranda\nwarnings, as recounted above. But, as is evident from the\ntranscript, he played down their importance. He said he\nwanted \u201cjust to clarify stuff,\u201d suggesting by his use of the\nword \u201cclarify\u201d that the \u201cstuff\u201d had already been conveyed in\nthe earlier interview, and that the only purpose of the later\ninterview was clarification. Brandt then said he wanted to\n\u201cread you your rights\u201d because \u201cyou\u2019ve been sitting in that\nroom and the door was locked and you\u2019re not free to leave.\u201d\nAn experienced officer in Brandt\u2019s position would have\nknown that to a reasonable person not trained in the law, let\nalone a fifteen-year-old high school freshman, these stated\nreasons were hardly an effective means of conveying the fact\nthat the warning he was about to give could mean the\ndifference between serving life in prison and going home that\nnight.\n\n   After Brandt read the Miranda warnings, he said, \u201cDo\nyou understand each of these rights that I\u2019ve explained to\nyou? Yeah? OK. Can we talk about the stuff we talked\nabout earlier today? Is that a yes?\u201d While giving the\nMiranda warnings, Brandt did not pause to ask \u201cIs that a\nyes?\u201d after asking if Reyes understood \u201ceach of the rights\u201d\n\f72                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nlisted. Only after the Miranda warnings had been completed\nand after Brandt asked whether \u201cwe [can] talk about the stuff\nwe talked about earlier today\u201d did Brandt finally ask \u201cIs that\na yes?\u201d and wait for a response. In contrast to the\ninterrogation in Seibert, Brandt did not ask Reyes for a signed\nwaiver of rights or a signed acknowledgment of having read\nand understood the Miranda warnings.\n\n    The psychological, spatial, and temporal break between\nthe unwarned and warned interrogations was not enough to\ncure the Miranda violation. Perhaps most important, Brandt\nhad been a continuous presence throughout. He and Wheeler\nwere the two questioners in the unwarned interrogation on\nFebruary 9; he was the primary questioner in both the\nunwarned and warned interrogations on February 10; and he\nhad personally driven Reyes on February 9 and 10, including\nthe short trip between the sheriff\u2019s station and the police\nstation on February 10. Further, although the unwarned\ncustodial interrogation on February 10 took place at the San\nBernardino sheriff\u2019s station and the warned interrogation took\nplace at the Riverside police station later that day, the warned\ninterrogation was conducted in a familiar place where Reyes\nhad been questioned by Brandt the day before. The record\ndoes not tell us the driving distance and time between the\nsheriff\u2019s station and the Riverside police station, but a map of\nthe area indicates that it was no more than fifteen miles. The\ntimeline for the events on February 10, described above,\nindicated that the driving time was not likely to have been\nmore than about thirty minutes. This case is quite unlike\nBobby v. Dixon, 132 S. Ct. 26, 32 (2011) (per curiam), in\nwhich there was a four-hour gap, during which the defendant\nwas transported from the police station to a separate jail and\nback, and during which the defendant spoke with his lawyer\nand learned material facts about the ongoing investigation.\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                         73\n\nSee also Capers, 627 F.3d at 484 (holding that a ninety-\nminute break in time between interrogations was not curative\nin part because police personnel were consistent and \u201cboth\n[interrogations] occurred while Capers remained in handcuffs\nand in settings that clearly established the authoritative nature\nof the questioning\u201d).\n\n       B. \u201cUnreasonable Determination of the Facts\u201d\n\n    Our concurring colleague reads the Court of Appeal\u2019s\ndecision as understanding and applying Seibert. In his view,\nthe Court of Appeal\u2019s quotation from Justice Souter\u2019s\nplurality opinion (in the paragraph we quoted above) shows\nthat it understood Seibert, and that the Court of Appeal\nviewed the question before it to be whether Brandt and his\nfellow officers took sufficient curative measures to ensure\nthat the Miranda warnings given at the Riverside police\nstation were effective. But our colleague nonetheless agrees\nwith the result we reach in this case. In his view, even under\nAEDPA\u2019s deferential standard, we must grant habeas relief\nbecause the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that sufficient\ncurative measures were taken is an \u201cunreasonable\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented\nin the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). See\nConcurrence at 78\u201380.\n\n    For the reasons given above, we disagree with our\nconcurring colleague on the question whether the Court of\nAppeal\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d Seibert. However, we\nnote that, although we do not need to reach the question\nwhether the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision rests on an\n\u201cunreasonable determination of the facts,\u201d we entirely agree\nwith him on that question. It is readily apparent, on the\nfactual record of this case, that Brandt and the others were\n\f74                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nexperienced officers who acted carefully and deliberately in\nperforming their two-step interrogation, and further, that they\ndid not take \u201ccurative measures\u201d that would \u201censure that a\nreasonable person in [Reyes\u2019s] situation would understand the\nimport and effect of the Miranda warning and of the Miranda\nwaiver.\u201d 542 U.S. at 622 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the\njudgment). Indeed, as described above, far from taking\n\u201ccurative measures,\u201d they took affirmative steps to ensure\nthat Reyes did not \u201cunderstand the import and effect\u201d of the\nMiranda warnings he was finally given at the Riverside\npolice station.\n\n                          Conclusion\n\n    The California Court of Appeal applied a rule that was\ncontrary to federal law as clearly established by the Supreme\nCourt in Seibert when it concluded that Reyes\u2019s postwarning\nconfession was admissible solely on the ground that his\nunwarned custodial statement was voluntary, and that his\nsubsequent warned statement therefore was also necessarily\nvoluntary. We hold that police officers deliberately\nemployed a two-step interrogation technique, and that they\ndid not take appropriate \u201ccurative measures,\u201d in violation of\nSeibert. We therefore hold that Reyes\u2019s postwarning\nconfession should have been suppressed. Because the state\ndid not argue harmless error in this court or the district court,\nthat defense is waived. See United States v. Vallejo, 237 F.3d\n1008, 1026 (9th Cir. 2001). Accordingly, we reverse the\ndistrict court\u2019s denial of Reyes\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                        75\n\ncorpus and remand with instructions to grant the writ unless\nReyes is retried within a reasonable time, not to exceed 180\ndays.\n\n   REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\nSINGLETON, Senior District Judge, concurring:\n\n    The majority has joined in a thoughtful and thorough\njudgment in this case. I concur in that judgment. The\nmajority has forcefully marshaled the facts and analyzed the\napplicable law. If this case had arisen entirely within the\nfederal system, e.g., under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, I would fully\njoin in the opinion and have no further comments or\nsuggestions.\n\n    This case does not arise entirely within the federal system,\nhowever, but comes to us from state court under \u00a7 2254, and\nthus our review must be guided by the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). AEDPA\nrequires us to give deference to decisions of the state courts\nboth as to the facts and the law, except in limited\ncircumstances.\n\n    The majority identifies Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600\n(2004), as clearly established federal law at the time the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal decided this case and looks to\nJustice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion to provide the\nappropriate rule of decision. I agree. See United States v.\nWilliams, 435 F.3d 1148, 1157\u201359 (9th Cir. 2006) (analyzing\nSeibert and concluding that Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion is the\nnarrowest holding obtaining five votes). In the majority\u2019s\n\f76                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\nview, the California Court of Appeal recognized Seibert as\ncontrolling but unreasonably interpreted it, effectively\nignoring Seibert and deciding the case under the prior law set\nout in Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298 (1985). The majority\nconcludes that, since the California court failed to apply\nclearly established law, we may withhold any deference and\nexercise our independent judgment in reviewing the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal\u2019s decision de novo.\n\n    I disagree. My review of the record leads me to conclude\nthat the California Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusions of law are\nin conformity with Seibert and Justice Kennedy\u2019s\nconcurrence. In my view, the state court\u2019s approach to the\nlaw is sound, but its finding of facts are unreasonable in\ncontext. I therefore, on this alternate ground, join in this\nCourt\u2019s judgment. My reasons are as follows.\n\n     In reaching a contrary view, the majority focuses\nexclusively on one part of Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence.\nSeibert addresses what we have termed a two-step\ninterrogation leading to a confession. The first part of the\ninterrogation is unwarned. Once the suspect confesses,\nMiranda warnings are given, and the interrogation resumes.\nTypically, the suspect confirms his confession. In practice,\nthe earlier confession is suppressed, but following Elstad, the\nsubsequent post-warning statement is allowed into evidence\nif it is voluntary. Seibert modified Elstad in cases such as\nthis. The opinion was fragmented. Justice Souter wrote an\nopinion for a plurality of four justices. Justice Kennedy\nseparately concurred, arguably on a more limited basis, and\nJustice O\u2019Connor wrote a dissent in which three other justices\njoined. The majority and I agree that Justice Kennedy\u2019s\nopinion provides the holding of Seibert. We disagree on how\nSeibert should be applied to this case.\n\f                           REYES V. LEWIS                    77\n\n    In my view, Justice Kennedy adopts all of Justice Souter\u2019s\nplurality opinion but imposes a limitation.              Rightly\nunderstood, Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion adopts a two-part test\nfor determining the validity of a confession where the police\nuse a two-step approach in their interrogation of a suspect.\nThe first prong, which I will call the Kennedy prong, asks\nwhether the two-step procedure was chosen intentionally in\norder to render subsequent Miranda warnings ineffective.\nThe second prong, which I will call the Souter prong, asks if\nthe two-step process, whether or not intentional, rendered the\nsubsequent warnings ineffective. For Justice Kennedy, both\nprongs must be satisfied in order to create a Siebert violation\nand take the case out of Oregon v. Elstad. Since the test has\ntwo prongs, it is analogous to the Strickland test for\ndetermining ineffective assistance of counsel.1 Like that test,\na reviewing court should be able to look to either prong first,\nand, if that prong is not satisfied, there is no need to address\nthe other prong. See Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 241\n(2009). Viewed in this light, the California Court of Appeal\u2019s\ndecision is within the law. That court quoted Justice Souter\ndirectly for the second prong of the test and concluded that\nnothing in the record of the interrogation \u201cchallenged the\ncomprehensibility and efficacy of the Miranda warnings to\nthe point that a reasonable person in the suspect\u2019s shoes\nwould not have understood them to convey a message that\n[he] retained a choice about continuing to talk.\u201d\n\n   Justice Kennedy\u2019s test requires that any two-step\nprocedure must be intentionally motivated to undermine\nMiranda. Justice Souter rejects reference to the police intent\nand focuses only on whether the process itself challenged the\ncomprehensibility and effectiveness of the Miranda warnings.\n\n 1\n     Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).\n\f78                         REYES V. LEWIS\n\nThus, if as the California Court of Appeal found, Reyes\nunderstood at the time of the second stage of the interview\nthat he retained a choice about whether to talk, his decision to\ntalk was consistent with Seibert, and there was no need for\nthe Court of Appeal to address the first prong of the test and\ndetermine whether the police intended to nullify the Miranda\nwarnings.\n\n    The Court of Appeal did not separately address the first\nprong of the test, and so by analogy to Strickland, we may\nreview that prong de novo and exercise independent\njudgment.2 See Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 39 (2009);\nMann v. Ryan, 774 F.3d 1203, 1215 (9th Cir. 2014)\n(\u201cBecause the state post-conviction court did not reach the\ndeficiency prong of the Strickland analysis, our review of this\nprong is not circumscribed by AEDPA.\u201d). I agree with the\nmajority that, under the facts of this case, the use of the two-\nstep procedure was a conscious effort to undermine Miranda.\nSee Williams, 435 F.3d at 1158\u201360 (discussing how a court\nshould determine whether an interrogation was deliberately\nused to undermine Miranda).\n\n    The second prong of the test was addressed by the Court\nof Appeal, and we must grant deference and may only reject\nthe finding if it was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination\n\n\n\n  2\n    It is clear that the Court of Appeal did not think that the procedure\nfollowed undermined the effectiveness of the mid-stream Miranda\nwarnings. It is not clear that the Court of Appeal considered whether the\nprocedure was chosen to undermine Miranda. Even if I were to assume\nthat the Court of Appeal found no intent, sub silentio, requiring deference\nI would still conclude under Williams that the procedure was chosen\nintentionally. See Williams, 435 F.3d at 1160 (discussing how to prove a\ndeliberate choice of procedure).\n\f                       REYES V. LEWIS                       79\n\nof the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state\ncourt proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (d)(2).\n\n    The majority points out that the Court of Appeal did not\nexplain its factual finding that the mid-stream Miranda\nwarning was not undermined by the interrogation procedure\nchosen by the police. In such a case, we must look to all of\nthe relevant evidence to determine if the fact finding is\nreasonably supported. See Delgado v. Lewis, 223 F.3d 976,\n982 (9th Cir. 2000) (\u201cFederal habeas review is not de novo\nwhen the state court does not supply reasoning for its\ndecision, but an independent review of the record is required\nto determine whether the state court clearly erred in its\napplication of controlling federal law.\u201d). Reyes has a heavy\nburden to establish that a state court fact finding is\nunreasonable. See Burt v. Titlow, __ U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 10,\n15\u201316 (2013). I am satisfied that he has sustained that burden\nhere.\n\n    The majority has summarized all of the relevant evidence,\nand it need not be repeated here. Guided by Williams\nregarding a determination of the effectiveness of mid-stream\nMiranda warnings, see Williams, 435 F.3d at 1160\u201362, I do\nnot believe that there is substantial evidence that would\nsupport an inference that the warnings given to Reyes were\neffective at the time they were given. There is no evidence of\nthe corrective measures identified by Justice Kennedy.\nTurning to the factors considered relevant by the plurality:\n1) the pre-warning interrogation was complete and detailed,\nconsuming many hours; 2) the two rounds of interrogation\noverlapped; 3) the two rounds of interrogation were close in\ntime; 4) there was a continuity of police personnel; and, most\nimportantly, 5) the interrogator\u2019s questions treated the second\nround of interrogation as continuous with the first.\n\f80                     REYES V. LEWIS\n\n    Viewed in light of the totality of the circumstances, there\nis no evidence that would permit a finding that the two-step\ninterrogation in this case did not undermine Miranda and lead\nto an involuntary confession.\n\f",
