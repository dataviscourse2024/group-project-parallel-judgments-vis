ELDRIDGE, Appellant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON DIRECT APPEAL FROM THE DENIAL OF A MOTION REGARDING\r\nCOMPETENCY TO BE EXECUTED FILED IN CAUSE NO. 9403201\r\n\r\nIN THE 178TH DISTRICT COURT\r\n\r\nHARRIS COUNTY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPer Curiam.  Price, J., dissents.\r\n\r\n\r\nO P I N I O N\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThis is a direct appeal of the denial of a Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article\r\n46.05 motion regarding appellant's competency to be executed filed in the 178th District \r\nCourt of Harris County, Cause No. 9403201 styled Ex parte Gerald Cornelius Eldridge.  \r\n\r\n\tIn April 1994, a jury found applicant guilty of the offense of capital murder.  The jury\r\nanswered the special issues submitted pursuant to Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article\r\n37.071, and the trial court, accordingly, set applicant's punishment at death.  This Court\r\naffirmed applicant's conviction and sentence on direct appeal.  Eldridge v. State, 940 S.W.2d\r\n646 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).  This Court denied relief on applicant's initial post-conviction\r\napplication for writ of habeas corpus and dismissed his subsequent application on February\r\n9, 2005.  Ex parte Eldridge, Nos. WR-60,478-01 and WR-60,478-02 (Tex. Crim. App. Feb.\r\n9, 2005)(not designated for publication).  On September 24, 2009, applicant filed in the trial\r\ncourt an Article 46.05 motion in which he asserted that he was incompetent to be executed. \r\nSee Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. 46.05.  Appellant's execution is set for November 17, 2009.\r\n\r\n\tAfter reviewing the record, the trial court found that appellant had failed to make a\r\nsubstantial showing of incompetency as required by Article 46.05.  It therefore determined\r\nthat it was not required to appoint additional experts or hold a hearing on the motion.  Upon\r\nappellant's request, the record was then sent to this Court for review.  See Art. 46.05(l). \r\nBecause appellant's motion was filed before the 20th day prior to his scheduled execution\r\ndate, this Court has the authority to review the trial court's determination that appellant failed\r\nto make a substantial showing.  \r\n\r\n\tHaving reviewed the record, we hold that the trial court's ruling was supported by the\r\nrecord.  Accordingly, we adopt the trial court's findings on the issue of appellant's\r\ncompetency to be executed.  No stay of execution need be granted.  Further, the mandate of\r\nthe Court shall issue immediately, and no motions for rehearing shall be entertained. \r\n\r\n\r\nDo not publish\r\n\r\nDelivered:  November 16, 2009\r\n\r\n\r\n",
