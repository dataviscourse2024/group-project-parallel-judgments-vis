Code Ann. ' 19.05(a).\u00a0 In October 2000, the grand jury re-indicted\r\nappellant for the greater offense of manslaughter in cause numbers 0859258 and\r\n0859259.\u00a0 See Tex. Pen. Code Ann. '\r\n19.04(a) (Vernon 2003).\u00a0 The State\r\nproceeded to trial on cause number 0859259 on November 27, 2001.\r\n\r\nAt\r\nthe close of evidence, the trial court presented its proposed jury charge to\r\nboth parties.\u00a0 The proposed charge\r\nincluded the offenses of criminally negligent homicide and manslaughter.\u00a0 Although appellant objected to inclusion of\r\nthe lesser offense, the jury received instructions on both offenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\njury convicted appellant of criminally negligent homicide and recommended a\r\nprobated sentence.\u00a0 The trial court\r\nsentenced appellant to three years= confinement in the Texas Department\r\nof Criminal Justice, State Jail Division, but suspended the sentence and placed\r\nappellant on community supervision for three years. Appellant timely filed\r\nnotice of appeal. \r\n\r\nIssues on Appeal\r\n\r\nOn\r\nappeal, appellant asserts (1) there is legally and factually insufficient\r\nevidence for a jury to have found he committed criminally negligent homicide;\r\n(2) the trial court erred when it instructed the jury on the lesser included\r\noffense of criminally negligent homicide; and (3) the trial court erred when it\r\nrefused to quash appellant=s indictment for manslaughter.\r\n\r\nI.\u00a0 Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\n\r\nIn\r\nhis first point of error, appellant asserts the evidence is legally and\r\nfactually insufficient to support a jury finding that he committed criminally\r\nnegligent homicide.\u00a0 No evidence exists,\r\nargues appellant, that he was Acriminally negligent@\r\nas this term is defined by Texas law.\u00a0 We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nA.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal sufficiency\r\n\r\nTo\r\ndetermine legal sufficiency, we view the evidence in the light most favorable\r\nto the verdict and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have\r\nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307,\r\n319 (1979); Garrett v. State, 851 S.W.2d 853, 857 (Tex. Crim.

App. 1995).\u00a0 On appeal, this\r\ncourt is not to reevaluate the weight and credibility of the evidence; rather,\r\nwe consider only whether the jury reached a rational decision.\u00a0 See Muniz v. State, 851 S.W.2d 238,\r\n246 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993).\u00a0 The jury, as the trier of fact, is the sole\r\njudge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u00a0\r\nSee Soto v. State, 864 S.W.2d 687, 691 (Tex. App.CHouston [14th Dist.] 1993, pet. ref=d).\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo\r\nsecure a conviction for criminally negligent homicide, the State must present\r\nevidence that a person caused the death of an individual by criminal\r\nnegligence.\u00a0 Tex.
