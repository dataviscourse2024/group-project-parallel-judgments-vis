App. 2000) (plurality op.).\n\f                                                                          PROENZA DISSENT - 2\n\nraised for the first time on appeal.3 Then, in Unkart,4 we held that Blue had no precedential value,5\n\nwhich has resulted in a steady decline in the number of opinions citing to Blue. Now, however, the\n\nCourt greatly expands the effect of the non-majority, non-precedential holding in Blue by exempting\n\nall judicial comments in front of a jury from the contemporaneous-objection rule. In doing so, the\n\nCourt overturns decades of caselaw, gives inventive appellate attorneys the ability to blindside trial\n\njudges, and fashions a regime that will entangle the appellate courts in micromanaging the conduct\n\nof jury trials. After this opinion, every statement made by a trial judge in front of a jury is subject\n\nto being examined under an appellate microscope. This is true no matter how innocuous the\n\nstatement and regardless of whether anyone at trial perceived it to be offensive.\n\n       Since the beginning of the millennium, Blue has resulted in a steady stream of opinions in\n\nwhich courts of appeals consider and reject unpreserved improper-comment claims or, occasionally,\n\nfind reversible error\u2014only to be reversed by this Court every single time that decision is challenged\n\nhere. Now that even minor comments are fair game on appeal, the number of meritless claims can\n\nonly grow. Instead of continuing this exercise in futility, we should disavow Blue in its entirety6 and\n\nhold that complaints under Article 38.05, just like most other claims, are subject to forfeiture.7\n\n\n       3\n        Id. at 130-32 (recognizing general rule with respect to judicial comments but taking notice\nof fundamental error in the case before it).\n       4\n           Unkart v.

But a disavowal would be as much a negation of the\nBlue decision as would occur if Blue had been binding precedent and were overruled.\n       7\n         The Court does not decide whether the right involved here is a category-one right under\nMarin or a category-two right.

Requiring Preservation is the General Rule\n\n       Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 33.1 requires the appealing party to raise a complaint at\n\ntrial before he can raise it on appeal.8 Although the rule speaks of no exceptions, we have\n\nrecognized the existence of exceptions under the three-tiered approach to error preservation in\n\nMarin.9      Under Marin, our system contains three types of rules: (1) absolute or systemic\n\nrequirements or prohibitions, (2) rights that must be implemented unless expressly waived, and (3)\n\nrights that are implemented upon request.10 Marin was a \u201cwatershed\u201d decision in the law of error\n\npreservation,11 and questions of \u201cfundamental error\u201d must now be considered within its framework.12\n\n       Marin explained that most rules fall within its third category\u2014rights that are forfeited by\n\ninaction.13 All but the most fundamental rights are forfeited if not insisted upon by the party to\n\n\nbe a category-one right, an improper-judicial-comment claim would then appear to eligible for\nconsideration for the first time even on habeas review.

According a particular rule status under one\n\nof the first two categories of Marin requires sufficient reasons to justify that decision. Otherwise,\n\nthe norm articulated by the contemporaneous objection requirement found in Rule 33.1 should\n\ncontrol. The question in this case, then, is whether there is sufficient justification for exempting the\n\ntype of complaint before us from the usual rules of procedural default.\n\n                B. The Statutory Language Does Not Require Judicial-Comment\n                               Complaints to be Non-Forfetitable\n\n        The statute prohibiting judicial comments provides:\n\n        In ruling upon the admissibility of evidence, the judge shall not discuss or comment\n        upon the weight of the same or its bearing in the case, but shall simply decide\n        whether or not it is admissible; nor shall he, at any stage of the proceeding previous\n        to the return of the verdict, make any remark calculated to convey to the jury his\n        opinion of the case.17\n\nThe Court points out that the statute is phrased in mandatory language (\u201cshall not\u201d), but as the Court\n\n\n       14\n          Id. at 279.

State, we so held\n\nin the course of determining that a violation of the prohibition against a person being with the jury\n\nwhile it is deliberating was forfeitable if the defendant was aware of the violation.19 The statute in\n\nthat case is similar to the statute at issue here in that both use \u201cshall\u201d in conjunction with a negative:\n\nIn Trinidad, the statute commanded, \u201cNo person shall be permitted to be with the jury while it is\n\ndeliberating,\u201d20 while the statute at issue here says that the judge \u201cshall not discuss or comment\n\nupon\u201d the weight of the evidence.21 Similarly, the statutory exclusionary rule found in Article 38.23\n\nprovides that, \u201cNo evidence obtained . . . in violation of [law] shall be admitted in evidence against\n\nthe accused on the trial of any criminal case.\u201d22 Despite the negative \u201cshall\u201d command, we have\n\nconstrued the statutory exclusionary rule to be a forfeitable right.23\n\n        It is true that the judicial-comment statute specifically refers to the \u201cjudge\u201d in connection\n\nwith its mandatory language, but it is hard to imagine how a judicial-comment statute could omit a\n\n\n\n\n        18\n             See Trinidad v.

App. 2006) (defendant\nrequired to raise complaint about failure of arrest to comply with Chapter 14 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure to raise complaint on appeal that evidence should have been excluded under Article\n38.23).\n\f                                                                          PROENZA DISSENT - 6\n\nreference to the judge. And while Article 38.23 does not refer specifically to the judge, its \u201cshall\u201d\n\nlanguage clearly applies to the judge, who is tasked with ruling upon the admissibility of evidence.\n\nMoreover, the judicial-comment statute, codified at Article 38.05, is in Chapter 38 of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure, which is titled \u201cEvidence in Criminal Actions,\u201d and which contains a number\n\nof evidentiary provisions that prescribe forfeitable rights.24 That is not to say that every provision\n\nin Chapter 38 prescribes a forfeitable right, but the status of Article 38.05 seems sufficiently\n\nambiguous to require resort to other factors to determine the nature of the right in question.\n\n             C. Historically, Judicial-Comment Complaints Had to be Preserved\n\n       The Texas statutory prohibition against judicial comments is not required by the United\n\nStates Constitution: allowing judicial comments on the evidence is a common-law tradition in\n\nfederal court,25 and federal trial courts are explicitly allowed to question witnesses.26\n\n\n       24\n          See TEX .

Ct. 920 (2016) (\u201cIt is well-established that a judge is not a mere moderator, but\nis the governor of the trial for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct and of determining\nquestions of law. He or she thus has a perfect right\u2014albeit a right that should be exercised with\ncare\u2014to participate actively in the trial proper.\u201d) (citing Quercia, citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted). But see United States v. Ottaviano, 738 F.3d 586, 595 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201cFederal Rule\nof Evidence 614(b) allows judges to question witnesses and act as more than \u2018a mere moderator.\u2019\nBut a judge must not \u2018abandon his or her proper role and assume that of an advocate. [I]solated\nquestioning to clarify ambiguities is one thing, but a trial judge cannot take over the\n\f                                                                           PROENZA DISSENT - 7\n\n        We have said, \u201cOrdinarily, a complaint regarding an improper judicial comment must be\n\npreserved at trial.\u201d27 The use of the word \u201cordinarily\u201d is a product of the plurality decision in Blue,\n\nwhich granted relief as a result of a judicial comment despite the absence of an objection.28 Before\n\nBlue, no such qualification was employed. In Minor v. State, we said simply, \u201cWhen no objection\n\nis made at trial to the judge\u2019s statements nor any request made to instruct the jury, nothing is\n\npresented for review.\u201d29 Other cases that predated Blue made similar unqualified statements in\n\nrejecting unpreserved judicial-comment claims.30 Even when a comment was thought to indicate\n\njudicial bias, the parties have historically been required to raise such claims at trial:\n\n        Prejudice of a trial judge not based on interest is not a legal disqualification. If\n        prejudice or opinion of guilt is indicated or shown the judge\u2019s rulings are subject to\n        close scrutiny. The right to complain lies not in the alleged prejudice of the judge but\n        in any errors in his rulings and conduct of the trial. The appellant complains of\n        several errors in the trial whereby the trial judge allegedly manifested prejudice and\n        commented on the evidence on numerous occasions. When no objection is made at\n        trial to the judge\u2019s statements nor any request made to instruct the jury, nothing is\n\n\n\n\ncross-examination for the government to merely emphasize the government\u2019s proof or question the\ncredibility of the defendant and his witnesses. The judge\u2019s participation must never reach the point\nwhere it appears clear to the jury that the court believes the accused is guilty.\u201d) (citations, internal\nquotation marks, brackets, and ellipsis omitted).

Equity and Policy Favor Giving Trial Judges the Opportunity\n                  to Address and Cure Complaints about Judicial Comments\n\n       One of the rationales for requiring a timely objection at trial is to give the trial judge the\n\nopportunity to cure error.32 In explaining the law and giving instructions, a trial judge might\n\ncomment on evidence without meaning to. It is possible that such an inadvertent comment could\n\nbe prejudicial but could and would be cured if the impropriety were explained to the trial judge or\n\notherwise brought to the judge\u2019s attention. A review of cases suggests that an objection is not\n\n\n\n       31\n           Minor, 469 S.W.2d at 580. The Court says that it is up to the legislature to decide whether\nit disagrees with the new rule the Court articulates today, but the matter has been left to the\nlegislature, and the rules of statutory construction support my position\u2014not that of the Court. Texas\nhas prohibited comments on the weight of the evidence almost since it achieved statehood. See\nGibson v. Hill, 21 Tex. 225, 228 (Tex. 1858) (\u201cWe have a statute which provides that \u2018the judge\nshall not in any case, civil or criminal, (charge or comment) on the weight of the evidence or\ntestimony\u2019\u201d). Along with the statutory prohibition, we have a long history of requiring complaints\nabout improper judicial comments to be brought to the trial court\u2019s attention before they could be\nraised on appeal. See Newton v. State, 150 Tex. Crim. 500, 509 (Tex. Crim. App. 1947) (\u201cWe have\nexamined the authorities relied upon by appellant and are in accord with their holding that a violation\nof this statute will ordinarily result in a reversal if the point is properly preserved by an exception\nto the court\u2019s remark.\u201d). Only a plurality in Blue indicated that a complaint about a judicial comment\nmight ever be exempted from preservation requirements and only for an exceptional case. Because\nthe legislature has recodified the prohibition against judicial comments several times, see Gibson,\nNewton, and Minor, supra, we should infer that it has approved of our construction of this right as\none that is forfeitable. See State v. Medrano, 67 S.W.3d 892, 902 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (\u201c[W]hen\na legislature reenacts a law using the same terms that have been judicially construed in a particular\nmanner, one may reasonably infer that the legislature approved of the judicial interpretation.\u201d). As\nJudge Newell has pointed out in his concurring opinion, Marin is good at explaining how to treat\nviolations of particular rights if we already know how those rights are to be categorized but is not\nas helpful with categorizing the rights in the first place. Instead of relying upon loose language in\nMarin to upend the parties\u2019 historical responsibility for enforcing Texas\u2019s comment-on-the-weight-\nof-the-evidence prohibition through trial objections, the Court should adhere to the historical practice\n(on which Blue was a slight aberration) and leave any change in that practice to the legislature if it\never desires to do so.\n       32\n            Hollins v.

By contrast, the parties\n\nat trial are in a position to observe the trial judge\u2019s tone and demeanor, and a failure to complain\n\nabout a particular comment would suggest that the comment was probably innocuous.38 If appellate\n\nattorneys are allowed to litigate the propriety of anything a trial court says, regardless of the presence\n\nor absence of a trial objection, then appellate courts could well find themselves micromanaging the\n\npractices of trial courts, a task for which the appellate courts are ill-suited.\n\n        The potential for widespread micromanagement of trial courts by the appellate courts can be\n\nseen in what has happened even after our decision in Unkart. Despite the holding in Unkart that the\n\nBlue case had no precedential value,39 numerous appellate decisions have still considered whether\n\njudicial comments in a particular case required reversal in the absence of an objection. Although the\n\nnumber of opinions citing Blue has dropped since Unkart, looking only at cases since the beginning\n\nof 2015 as a representative snapshot, at least twenty-two cases have involved discussions of Blue that\n\nultimately resulted in rejecting claims of improper judicial comments before a jury.40\n\n\n        37\n             See Smith v.

Although my dissent does address the\nfact that the Court\u2019s opinion will likely result in an avalanche of unmeritorious appellate claims, my\nmain point is that the nature of the right prescribed by Article 38.05 argues in favor of it being\nforfeitable. This right, which is not constitutional and does not exist in the federal system, is a right\nto be free of commentary by the trial judge on the evidence in the case. If the defendant thinks the\ntrial judge has strayed into the area of improper commentary under Texas law, he should point that\nout and seek a curative instruction. The concurrence worries about an \u201cadmittedly partial tribunal,\u201d\nbut the right to an unbiased judge is not the same as the right to be free from judicial commentary.\nEven if Article 38.05 may in some way help safeguard the right to an impartial tribunal, we have\nrecognized in other contexts that a statutory right designed to safeguard a constitutional right is not\nnecessarily treated the same as the constitutional right itself. See Gray v. State, 159 S.W.3d 95, 97\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2005) (violation of statute designed to help protect constitutional right to a jury\nthat is a fair cross section of the community is subject to non-constitutional harm analysis); Ex parte\nSadberry, 864 S.W.2d 541, 543 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (claim based on statute designed to\nsafeguard right to jury trial not cognizable on habeas corpus).\n\f",
