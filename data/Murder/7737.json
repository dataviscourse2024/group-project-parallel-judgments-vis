Jud. Admin. 14-807 (governing law student practice\nin the courts of Utah).\n\n1. Justice Jill M. Pohlman began her work on this case as a member\nof the Utah Court of Appeals. She became a member of the Utah\nSupreme Court thereafter and completed her work on the case\nsitting by special assignment as authorized by law. See generally\nid. R. 3-108(4).\n\f                           State v. Calata\n\n\ncar Calata was driving had been reported as stolen. As the\ntroopers approached Calata, he fled the scene in the car, leading\nthe troopers on a high-speed chase for nearly twenty blocks.\nEventually, after Calata\u2019s car slowed, both troopers employed a\npursuit intervention technique (PIT maneuver), causing Calata\u2019s\ncar to come to a stop. Calata was arrested, and he later pled guilty\nto failure to stop at command of police. As part of his sentence,\nthe district court ordered Calata to pay restitution for damages\nsustained by the troopers\u2019 patrol cars in ending the chase.\n\n\u00b62     Calata appeals, arguing that the district court erred when\nit refused to calculate court-ordered restitution and that his\ndefense counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance in\nthe restitution proceedings. We reject his claims of ineffective\nassistance of counsel, but we reverse and remand for the district\ncourt to determine court-ordered restitution.\n\n\n                         BACKGROUND2\n\n\u00b63      On July 13, 2017, a Utah Highway Patrol trooper\n(Trooper 1) ran a license plate check on a damaged car he\nobserved at a gas station. Calata was the driver of that car. The\ncheck revealed that the license plate had been reported stolen, so\nTrooper 1 followed the car as it left the gas station. After another\nUtah Highway Patrol trooper (Trooper 2) arrived as backup, the\ntroopers pulled Calata over. The troopers exited their patrol cars\n\u201cto conduct a felony stop,\u201d but as they approached Calata, he\ndrove away. The troopers pursued Calata as he \u201cweaved in and\nout of traffic on I-15,\u201d reaching speeds between 100 and 105 miles\n\n\n\n2. Because Calata pled guilty to failure to stop at command of\npolice, there was no trial and so we recite the facts consistent with\nthe district court\u2019s factual findings made in support of\nits restitution order. Like the parties, we also draw background\nfacts from the information, as well as from the restitution hearing\ntranscript.\n\n\n 20200145-CA                     2               2022 UT App 127\n\f                           State v. Calata\n\n\nper hour. The pursuit ended when both troopers performed PIT\nmaneuvers.\n\n\u00b64     Trooper 1 later explained that a PIT maneuver is a\ntechnique used to \u201crotate the vehicle\u201d an officer is \u201cin pursuit of\nin an attempt to get [the vehicle] to stop.\u201d The Utah Department\nof Public Safety has policies and procedures that apply to police\npursuit and PIT maneuvers. According to one such policy, an\nofficer is \u201crequired to request permission\u201d to perform a PIT\nmaneuver when traveling \u201cover 45 miles per hour.\u201d Here, when\nit appeared that Calata was slowing and was going to exit the\nfreeway, the troopers executed PIT maneuvers in an effort to end\nthe pursuit.\n\n\u00b65     The troopers testified that they were going 40\u201350 miles per\nhour when Trooper 1 executed the first PIT maneuver by using\nhis patrol car to contact the rear passenger side of Calata\u2019s car,\nwhich caused Calata\u2019s car to come to a rest after rotating 360\ndegrees and skidding toward the freeway off-ramp. As Trooper 2\n\u201cwas pulling up on\u201d Calata\u2019s car to box it in from behind, he\nnoticed that its brake lights were off and that it \u201cbegan rolling\ntowards the . . . [freeway] off ramp.\u201d Trooper 2 then performed a\nsecond PIT maneuver, also striking the rear passenger side of\nCalata\u2019s car to \u201cprevent it from moving and fleeing again.\u201d The\nPIT maneuvers damaged both troopers\u2019 vehicles but successfully\nstopped Calata.\n\n\u00b66     Calata was arrested and later pled guilty to failure to stop\nat command of police, a third-degree felony. As part of the plea\nagreement, the State recommended no prison time provided that\nCalata commit no new violations, obtain his presentence\ninvestigation report, and appear at his sentencing hearing. But\nwhen Calata failed to appear for his mandatory sentencing\nhearing, he was arrested and sentenced to an indeterminate\nprison term not to exceed five years.\n\n\u00b67     After sentencing, the State moved for an order of\nrestitution, arguing that Calata was liable for the cost of repairing\n\n\n\n 20200145-CA                     3               2022 UT App 127\n\f                           State v. Calata\n\n\nthe troopers\u2019 patrol cars. Calata requested a restitution hearing, at\nwhich the district court asked for briefing on whether Calata\u2019s\nactions proximately caused the damage to the troopers\u2019 vehicles.\nCalata argued that the State\u2019s request for restitution should be\ndenied because he was not the proximate cause of the damage. He\nasserted that the troopers\u2019 PIT maneuvers violated Utah\nDepartment of Public Safety policies and procedures and, as a\nresult, their actions were a \u201csuperseding cause that relieve[d]\n[him] of liability for the damage to the patrol vehicles.\u201d\n\n\u00b68     The district court disagreed. It first addressed whether the\ntroopers\u2019 actions were foreseeable \u201cto a reasonable person in Mr.\nCalata\u2019s circumstances.\u201d It found that even if the troopers \u201cmight\nhave violated the policies in one way or another,\u201d their actions\nwere foreseeable because they were working \u201cto protect the\ncommunity from the dangers posed by [Calata\u2019s] vehicle,\u201d which\nwas traveling \u201c105 miles an hour down the freeway.\u201d The court\nfurther explained that \u201ca reasonable person would foresee that\nthe [troopers] might initiate a collision in order to stop [Calata]\nfrom continuing with a high speed flight,\u201d regardless of what the\nUtah Department of Public Safety policies and procedures\nprovide.\n\n\u00b69     The court also addressed whether the restitution statute\nrequired it to determine complete restitution and court-ordered\nrestitution. The court explained it did not need to determine\ncourt-ordered restitution because the statute \u201conly contemplates\nthe determination of court ordered restitution in the event the\ndefendant is placed on probation.\u201d Calata objected, arguing that\nthe restitution statute requires the district court to consider both\ncomplete restitution and court-ordered restitution. But the court\nruled that it was obligated only \u201cto make a finding of complete\nrestitution\u201d because Calata was in prison, not on probation.\n\n\u00b610 The court then granted the State\u2019s motion for restitution\nand ordered Calata to pay $3,071.01\u2014an amount to which both\nparties stipulated.\n\n\n\n\n 20200145-CA                     4               2022 UT App 127\n\f                           State v. Calata\n\n\n\u00b611    Calata now appeals.\n\n\n            ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n\u00b612 Calata first argues that the district court erred in declining\nto determine court-ordered restitution. \u201cWe will not disturb a\ndistrict court\u2019s restitution determination unless the court exceeds\nthe authority prescribed by law or abuses its discretion.\u201d State v.\nOgden, 2018 UT 8, \u00b6 25, 416 P.3d 1132 (cleaned up). \u201cWe review a\ndistrict court\u2019s interpretation of restitution statutes for\ncorrectness.\u201d State v. Hedgcock, 2019 UT App 93, \u00b6 11, 443 P.3d\n1288 (cleaned up).\n\n\u00b613 Second, Calata raises two claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel. \u201cA claim of ineffective assistance of counsel raised for the\nfirst time on appeal presents a question of law . . . .\u201d State v.\nTapusoa, 2020 UT App 92, \u00b6 9, 467 P.3d 912 (cleaned up).\n\n\n                            ANALYSIS\n\n                   I. Court-ordered Restitution\n\n\u00b614 Calata contends that the district court erred when, over his\nobjection, it refused to calculate court-ordered restitution. Calata\nargues that \u201cthis determination is mandatory\u201d under the plain\nlanguage of the Crime Victims Restitution Act (the Restitution\nAct)3 and the caselaw interpreting it.\n\n\u00b615 \u201cComplete restitution and court-ordered restitution are\ndistinct concepts.\u201d State v. Grant, 2021 UT App 104, \u00b6 56, 499 P.3d\n\n\n3. Calata asserts that the 2017 version of the Restitution Act\u2014in\neffect at the time of his charged conduct\u2014applies in this case.\nAlthough the State asserts that the 2020 version of the Restitution\nAct controls, it acknowledges that as between the 2017 and 2020\n                                                     (continued\u2026)\n\n\n 20200145-CA                     5                2022 UT App 127\n\f                           State v. Calata\n\n\n176. Complete restitution is the restitution \u201cnecessary to\ncompensate a victim for all losses caused by the defendant.\u201d Id.\n(cleaned up). Court-ordered restitution, in contrast, is the\nrestitution the court \u201corders the defendant to pay as a part of the\ncriminal sentence.\u201d Id. (cleaned up). It is \u201ca subset of complete\nrestitution\u201d and accounts for, among other things, the defendant\u2019s\nability to pay.4 Id. (cleaned up).\n\n\u00b616 Although the district court calculated complete restitution,\nthe court did not calculate court-ordered restitution, concluding\nthat the Restitution Act \u201conly contemplates the determination of\ncourt ordered restitution in the event the defendant is placed on\nprobation.\u201d Stated another way, the court reasoned that because\ncourt-ordered restitution is \u201cessentially . . . a condition of\nprobation,\u201d it need not determine court-ordered restitution when,\nas here, \u201cthe defendant is committed to prison.\u201d\n\n\u00b617 The State agrees with Calata that this was error and\nwarrants remand to the district court for a determination of court-\nordered restitution. At the time of Calata\u2019s restitution hearing, the\nRestitution Act explained that \u201c[i]n determining restitution, the\ncourt shall determine complete restitution and court-ordered\n\n\nversions, \u201cthe text of the relevant provisions is the same.\u201d Given\nthe State\u2019s acknowledgment that any differences in the Restitution\nAct are immaterial to the issues raised on appeal, we assume\nwithout deciding that the 2017 version of the Restitution Act\napplies.\n\n4. The distinction between complete restitution and court-ordered\nrestitution \u201cno longer exists in current law.\u201d State v. Blake, 2022 UT\nApp 104, \u00b6 7 n.2, 517 P.3d 414; see also Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77-38b-\n205(1)(a)(i) (LexisNexis Supp. 2022) (\u201c[T]he court shall order a\ndefendant, as part of the sentence imposed under Section 76-3-\n201, to pay restitution to all victims . . . for the entire amount of\npecuniary damages that are proximately caused to each victim by\nthe criminal conduct of the defendant,\u201d or, in the case of a plea\nagreement, \u201cin accordance with the terms of\u201d that agreement.).\n\n\n 20200145-CA                      6               2022 UT App 127\n\f                           State v. Calata\n\n\nrestitution.\u201d Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77-38a-302(2) (LexisNexis 2017).\nOur appellate courts have interpreted this language as \u201ca clear\ndirective that district courts are to make two separate restitution\ndeterminations, one for complete restitution and a second for\ncourt-ordered restitution.\u201d State v. Laycock, 2009 UT 53, \u00b6 20, 214\nP.3d 104; see also State v. Ogden, 2018 UT 8, \u00b6 26, 416 P.3d 1132\n(same); Grant, 2021 UT App 104, \u00b6 57 (collecting cases). Based on\nthis governing law and the State\u2019s concession of error, we reverse\nthe court\u2019s ruling, and we remand with instructions for the court\nto determine court-ordered restitution under the factors set forth\nin the Restitution Act.\n\n           II. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims\n\n\u00b618 Calata contends that defense counsel rendered\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance in two ways. First, Calata\nasserts that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to request\nthat the court apportion the fault of Calata and the troopers in\nassessing Calata\u2019s restitution liability, arguing that \u201cthe district\ncourt should apportion fault in restitution proceedings if\nrequested to do so.\u201d Second, Calata asserts that defense counsel\nwas ineffective in failing to argue to the district court \u201cthat the\nRestitution Act impermissibly infringed\u201d on Calata\u2019s\n\u201cconstitutional right to have a jury determine the damages giving\nrise to a civil judgment,\u201d as well as on Calata\u2019s \u201cdue process rights\nto the procedural safeguards and remedies in a civil action.\u201d We\ndisagree with Calata.\n\n\u00b619 To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant\nmust meet the two-part test of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.\n668 (1984). The defendant must show, first, that counsel\u2019s\nperformance was deficient in that it \u201cfell below an objective\nstandard of reasonableness\u201d under prevailing professional\nnorms, id. at 687\u201388, and, second, that \u201cthe deficient performance\nprejudiced the defense,\u201d id. at 687. It is well established that we\nneed not \u201caddress both components of the inquiry if we\ndetermine that a defendant has made an insufficient showing on\none.\u201d Archuleta v. Galetka, 2011 UT 73, \u00b6 41, 267 P.3d 232 (cleaned\n\n\n\n 20200145-CA                     7               2022 UT App 127\n\f                           State v. Calata\n\n\nup). Here, we resolve and reject both of Calata\u2019s ineffective\nassistance claims on the deficient-performance component of\nStrickland.\n\n\u00b620 To establish deficient performance, a defendant must show\nthat \u201ccounsel made errors so serious that counsel was not\nfunctioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth\nAmendment.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687. Counsel\u2019s challenged\nconduct is judged \u201con the facts of the particular case, viewed as of\nthe time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d Id. at 690. Although attorneys are\nnot \u201ccategorially excused from failure to raise an argument not\nsupported by existing legal precedent,\u201d State v. Silva, 2019 UT 36,\n\u00b6 19, 456 P.3d 718, \u201cit is not the case that attorneys must raise\nevery conceivable objection in order to render constitutionally\neffective assistance,\u201d State v. Samora, 2021 UT App 29, \u00b6 44, 484\nP.3d 1206, cert. granted, 497 P.3d 828 (Utah 2021). Rather, attorneys\nare entitled to \u201cpick [their] battles,\u201d and \u201c[w]e must view a\ndecision to not object in context and determine whether correcting\nthe error was sufficiently important under the circumstances that\nfailure to do so was objectively unreasonable\u2014i.e., a battle that\ncompetent counsel would have fought.\u201d State v. Ray, 2020 UT 12,\n\u00b6 32, 469 P.3d 871. Additionally, \u201cthe failure of counsel to make\nmotions or objections which would be futile if raised does not\nconstitute ineffective assistance.\u201d State v. Karren, 2018 UT App 226,\n\u00b6 31, 438 P.3d 18 (cleaned up).\n\n\u00b621 We are also mindful that \u201c\u2018judicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s\nperformance is highly deferential\u2019 and includes a strong\npresumption that counsel \u2018rendered adequate assistance and\nmade all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable\nprofessional judgment.\u2019\u201d State v. Reigelsperger, 2017 UT App 101,\n\u00b6 92, 400 P.3d 1127 (cleaned up) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n689\u201390). Indeed, \u201c[t]he proper measure of attorney performance\nremains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional\nnorms.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688; accord Silva, 2019 UT 36, \u00b6 20;\nState v. Jones, 2020 UT App 31, \u00b6 44, 462 P.3d 372.\n\n\n\n\n 20200145-CA                     8               2022 UT App 127\n\f                           State v. Calata\n\n\n\u00b622 We now examine Calata\u2019s two claims of ineffective\nassistance in turn.\n\nA.     Apportionment of Fault\n\n\u00b623 Calata asserts that defense counsel was ineffective \u201cin\nfailing to request apportionment of fault\u201d between Calata and the\ntroopers. In Calata\u2019s view, both the \u201cRestitution Act and the Utah\nLiability Reform Act (LRA) demonstrate that the district court\nshould apportion fault in restitution proceedings if requested to\ndo so.\u201d5 Because defense counsel did not argue that the court\nshould apportion damages in the restitution proceedings, Calata\ncontends his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective level\nof reasonableness, which, in turn, prejudiced him.\n\n\u00b624 In support, Calata first argues that \u201c[t]he Restitution Act\nand case law interpreting it . . . demonstrate that the causation\nlanguage of the Restitution Act should be interpreted to require\napportionment as part of the causation analysis.\u201d The Restitution\nAct \u201crequires courts to order restitution when a defendant enters\ninto a plea disposition or is convicted of criminal activity that has\nresulted in pecuniary damages.\u201d State v. Ogden, 2018 UT 8, \u00b6 26,\n416 P.3d 1132 (cleaned up); Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77-38a-302(1)\n(LexisNexis 2017). Calata argues that \u201cUtah\u2019s appellate courts\nhave long recognized the legislature\u2019s intent to incorporate civil\nstandards into the Restitution Act.\u201d\n\n\u00b625 Specifically, Calata points to State v. Laycock, 2009 UT 53,\n214 P.3d 104, in which the Utah Supreme Court held \u201cthat issues\n\n\n5. The LRA \u201cdelineates the apportionment of comparative fault in\ncivil actions.\u201d State v. Grant, 2021 UT App 104, \u00b6 30, 499 P.3d 176.\nIt provides that the \u201cfact finder may, and when requested by a\nparty shall, allocate the percentage or proportion of fault\nattributable to each person seeking recovery, to each defendant,\nto any person immune from suit, and to any other [non-\nparties] . . . for whom there is a factual and legal basis to allocate\nfault.\u201d Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-5-818(4)(a) (LexisNexis 2018).\n\n\n 20200145-CA                      9               2022 UT App 127\n\f                            State v. Calata\n\n\nof comparative negligence may be relevant in determining\nrestitution.\u201d Id. \u00b6 27. Calata then turns to State v. Ogden, which\naddressed causation in the Restitution Act. 2018 UT 8, \u00b6\u00b6 26\u201348.\nThere, the supreme court explained that the Restitution Act\naddresses causation in two provisions. Id. \u00b6 32. First, \u201c[t]he statute\nallows the district court to enter an order when a defendant enters\ninto a plea disposition or is convicted of criminal activity that has\nresulted in pecuniary damages.\u201d Id. (cleaned up). And second, \u201cthe\ndistrict court awards complete restitution to compensate a victim\nfor all losses caused by the defendant.\u201d Id. (cleaned up). The\nrelevant language the court analyzed was \u201cresulted in\u201d and\n\u201ccaused by.\u201d See id. (cleaned up). After examining the Restitution\nAct\u2019s \u201cstructure,\u201d the court concluded \u201cthat the Legislature\nintended that the same causation standard apply in a restitution\nhearing that would apply in a parallel civil action.\u201d Id. \u00b6 38. That\nis, a proximate cause standard. Id. \u00b6 39.\n\n\u00b626 From this analysis, Calata extrapolates that \u201c[u]nder the\nlanguage and structure of the Restitution Act, \u2018caused by\u2019 and\n\u2018resulted in\u2019 also requires apportionment.\u201d While he concedes that\n\u201cLaycock and Ogden did not decide the question of whether\napportionment applies in restitution proceedings,\u201d Calata\ncontends that \u201cthe analysis in these cases dictates that the same\napportionment standards that would apply in a parallel civil\naction apply in restitution proceedings, just as the same causation\nstandard that applies in a parallel civil action applies to restitution\nproceedings.\u201d\n\n\u00b627 Next, Calata contends that \u201cthe plain language of the LRA\ndemonstrates that a defendant is entitled to apportionment when\nrequested in restitution proceedings.\u201d Under the LRA, \u201c[t]he fact\nfinder may, and when requested by a party shall, allocate the\npercentage or proportion of fault attributable to each person\nseeking recovery, to each defendant, to any person immune from\nsuit, and to any other person identified under Subsection 78B-5-\n821(4) for whom there is a factual and legal basis to allocate fault.\u201d\nUtah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-5-818(4)(a) (LexisNexis 2018).\n\n\n\n\n 20200145-CA                      10               2022 UT App 127\n\f                           State v. Calata\n\n\n\u00b628 Calata argues that the LRA applies to restitution\nproceedings because its definition of \u201cfault\u201d \u201cencompasses\ncriminal acts.\u201d The LRA defines \u201cfault\u201d as \u201cany actionable breach\nof legal duty, act, or omission proximately causing or contributing\nto injury or damages sustained by a person seeking recovery,\nincluding negligence in all its degrees, comparative negligence,\nassumption of risk, strict liability, breach of express or implied\nwarranty of a product, products liability, and misuse,\nmodification, or abuse of a product.\u201d Id. \u00a7 78B-5-817(2). Relying\non Graves v. North Eastern Services, Inc., 2015 UT 28, 345 P.3d 619,\nCalata proffers that \u201c[a]ny breach of duty, act, or omission counts\nas fault so long as it is proximately connected to injury or\ndamages.\u201d Id. \u00b6 49. Because \u201ca criminal act qualifies both as a\n\u2018breach of legal duty\u2019 and an \u2018act\u2019 proximately causing the injury\nor damages,\u201d Calata reasons that his \u201ccriminal act constitutes\n\u2018fault\u2019 under the LRA and is therefore subject to apportionment.\u201d\n\n\u00b629 And finally, Calata asserts that the LRA would have\nrequired fault to be apportioned between him and the troopers\nhad his counsel requested it. The LRA provides that \u201c[a] person\nimmune from suit may not be named as a defendant, but fault\nmay be allocated to a person immune from suit solely for the\npurpose of accurately determining the fault of the person seeking\nrecovery and all defendants.\u201d Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-5-821(2)\n(LexisNexis 2018). Here, Calata argues that although the troopers\nare immune from suit, he was \u201centitled to have fault allocated\nbetween him . . . and the troopers\u201d because their \u201cacts\u201d also fall\nunder the LRA\u2019s \u201cfault\u201d definition. Specifically, Calata contends\nthat \u201cthe troopers\u2019 acts in intentionally driving their vehicles into\n[his] car fall under the broad and categorical definition of fault, as\nan intentional tort, any intentional act, and indeed, any act that\nproximately causes or contributes to injury or damages\u2014that is,\nthe damage to their vehicles.\u201d (Cleaned up.) Calata also contends\nthat \u201cthere is proximate cause between the troopers\u2019 acts because\ntheir driving maneuvers were a but-for cause of the damage to\ntheir vehicles, and it was foreseeable that their vehicles would\nincur damage as a result of their maneuvers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 20200145-CA                     11               2022 UT App 127\n\f                           State v. Calata\n\n\n\u00b630 In Calata\u2019s view, his arguments are \u201cwell-founded on\nestablished caselaw and statutory language,\u201d and it was\nobjectively unreasonable for his counsel \u201cnot to argue the\napportionment issue to the district court.\u201d Although Calata has\npresented a thoughtful argument in support of his claim that \u201ca\ndefendant is entitled to apportionment when requested in\nrestitution proceedings,\u201d we do not share his view that it was\nobjectively unreasonable for defense counsel not to make these\narguments.\n\n\u00b631 First, the legal argument Calata weaves together from\nvarious sources is a difficult one. See State v. Grant, 2021 UT App\n104, \u00b6 27 & n.9, 499 P.3d 176 (stating that resolving \u201cwhether\ncomparative fault principles apply to restitution proceedings\u201d\n\u201cwould be difficult\u201d). Utah appellate courts have not addressed\nwhether the causation language in the Restitution Act should be\ninterpreted to allow apportioning fault or whether the LRA\napplies in this context. See Ogden, 2018 UT 8, \u00b6 32 n.7 (\u201cWe do not\ndecide whether the [LRA] has any place in restitution proceedings\nbecause Ogden did not preserve the argument below.\u201d); Grant,\n2021 UT App 104, \u00b6 27 (\u201c[W]e assume, without deciding, that\ncomparative fault principles apply to restitution proceedings.\u201d).\nIt is also not expressly provided in the statute that the LRA applies\nin this context, nor is there authority that indicates it does.\n\n\u00b632 Further, the authority on which Calata relies would have\nto be extended to reach the result for which Calata advocates. For\nexample, Laycock is a negligent homicide case in which the court\nheld \u201cthat issues of comparative negligence may be relevant in\ndetermining restitution.\u201d Laycock, 2009 UT 53, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27 (emphasis\nadded). Not only did our supreme court stop short of saying\nissues of comparative negligence are relevant in determining\nrestitution, but whether the court would have made the same\nobservation in a case involving an intentional crime, like failure to\n\n\n\n\n 20200145-CA                     12              2022 UT App 127\n\f                            State v. Calata\n\n\nstop at command of police,6 is questionable. And while the\nsupreme court in Ogden concluded that the legislature \u201cintended\nthat the same causation standard apply in a restitution hearing\nthat would apply in a parallel civil action,\u201d 2018 UT 8, \u00b6 38, it did\nnot hint that the apportionment standard should likewise be\nimported into the Restitution Act\u2019s causation analysis.\n\n\u00b633 Given the lack of clarity in the law and the difficulty\ndefense counsel would have faced in advocating for the\napplication of the apportionment standard in restitution\nproceedings, we are unpersuaded that it was unreasonable for\ndefense counsel to not make the argument Calata now crafts on\nappeal. While it is true that we do not \u201cjudge an attorney\u2019s\nperformance based only on settled law,\u201d Silva, 2019 UT 36, \u00b6 19,\nwe agree with the State that without a clear basis in the statutory\nlanguage and given the lack of legal precedent, defense counsel\u2019s\nperformance here did not fall below an objective standard of\nreasonableness, see Jones, 2020 UT App 31, \u00b6\u00b6 46\u201347 (explaining\nthat counsel could reasonably conclude there was no legal\nproblem to correct and that \u201csuch a conclusion is particularly\nreasonable given that no Utah appellate court has squarely\naddressed\u201d the relevant legal issue).\n\n\u00b634 Further, even if defense counsel believed she could succeed\nin persuading the court to extend the law to apply apportionment\nprinciples in restitution hearings, it would not have been\nunreasonable for counsel to conclude that arguing that the\ntroopers were at fault would have been a futile effort. See Karren,\n2018 UT App 226, \u00b6 31 (\u201c[T]he failure of counsel to make motions\nor objections which would be futile if raised does not constitute\nineffective assistance.\u201d (cleaned up)).\n\n\u00b635 The LRA provides that \u201c[a] person immune from suit may\nnot be named as a defendant, but fault may be allocated to a\n\n\n6. See State v. Bird, 2015 UT 7, \u00b6 23, 345 P.3d 1141 (stating that \u201cthe\nfailure-to-respond offense . . . implicates an intentional mens\nrea\u201d).\n\n\n 20200145-CA                      13               2022 UT App 127\n\f                            State v. Calata\n\n\nperson immune from suit solely for the purpose of accurately\ndetermining the fault of the person seeking recovery and all\ndefendants.\u201d Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-5-821(2) (LexisNexis 2018)\n(emphases added). As relevant here, fault is defined in the LRA\nas \u201cany actionable breach of legal duty, act, or omission\nproximately causing or contributing to injury or damages\nsustained by a person seeking recovery.\u201d Id. \u00a7 78B-5-817(2)\n(emphasis added). Thus, to apportion fault to the troopers,\ndefense counsel would have had to show that they were at \u201cfault\u201d\nby first establishing that their conduct was \u201cactionable.\u201d See id.\nAlthough Calata argues that at least one of the troopers\u2019 PIT\nmaneuvers violated the Utah Department of Public Safety policies\nand procedures, he has not undertaken the analysis to\ndemonstrate that either trooper\u2019s conduct was \u201cactionable\u201d7 and\ntherefore constituted fault under the LRA that could be\napportioned. Without additional analysis on this point, it is not\napparent to us that either trooper\u2019s conduct fell under the LRA,\nand thus Calata has not shown that it was unreasonable for\ndefense counsel to harbor similar doubt.\n\n\u00b636 Finally, even if fault could legally be apportioned to the\ntroopers, it would not have been unreasonable for defense counsel\n\n\n7. In Graves v. North Eastern Services, Inc., 2015 UT 28, 345 P.3d 619,\nin reaching its conclusion that the definition of fault in the LRA\nencompasses \u201cintentionally tortious activity,\u201d the Utah Supreme\nCourt observed that the \u201ccore definition is broad and categorical.\u201d\nId. \u00b6 49. Quoting the statute, the court stated that the definition of\nfault \u201cextends to \u2018any actionable breach of legal duty, act or\nomission proximately causing or contributing to injury or\ndamages.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-5-817(2)). Two\nsentences later, the court then emphasized, \u201cAny breach of duty,\nact, or omission counts as fault so long as it is proximately\nconnected to injury or damages.\u201d Id. In making the latter\nstatement, the court omitted the word \u201cactionable,\u201d but we do not\nread that omission as intentional or meaningful. After all, the\nword \u201cactionable\u201d is part of the LRA\u2019s definition of fault as the\nsupreme court acknowledged. See id.\n\n\n 20200145-CA                      14               2022 UT App 127\n\f                           State v. Calata\n\n\nto conclude that seeking apportionment would be futile under the\ncircumstances. Assuming the LRA applies to the Restitution Act\nand that at least one trooper was at fault for the damages incurred\nby the patrol cars, the district court could not have apportioned\nfault to them unless their \u201ccombined percentage or proportion of\nfault\u201d was \u201c40% or more.\u201d See id. \u00a7 78B-5-819(2)(b). In other words,\nif the troopers\u2019 combined percentage or proportion of fault was\nless than 40%, the court would have been statutorily obligated to\n\u201creduce that percentage or proportion of fault to zero and\nreallocate that percentage or proportion of fault to the other\nparties . . . for whom there is a factual and legal basis to allocate\nfault.\u201d See id. \u00a7 78B-5-819(2)(a).\n\n\u00b637 Here, defense counsel could have reasonably concluded\nthat the district court would not find that the troopers\u2019 combined\npercentage or proportion of fault equaled 40% or more. After all,\nit was Calata who fled from the troopers and engaged in a high-\nspeed chase that posed a danger to the public. And the troopers\nperformed their PIT maneuvers only after Calata had slowed\ndown but still demonstrated an intent to flee. Given these facts,\nreasonable counsel could conclude that undertaking the\nconsiderable effort to convince the court that apportionment\nshould be considered in setting restitution would ultimately be a\nfutile effort because the court was unlikely to apportion more than\n40% of the damages to the troopers. See Karren, 2018 UT App 226,\n\u00b6 31.\n\n\u00b638 In sum, because defense counsel would have faced\nsignificant hurdles in attempting to persuade the district court to\napportion damages between Calata and the troopers in setting\nrestitution, we conclude that it was not objectively unreasonable\nfor counsel not to raise apportionment arguments related to the\nRestitution Act and LRA before the district court. Therefore,\nCalata has not established ineffective assistance of counsel. See\nArchuleta, 2011 UT 73, \u00b6 41.\n\n\n\n\n 20200145-CA                     15              2022 UT App 127\n\f                            State v. Calata\n\n\nB.     Constitutional Arguments\n\n\u00b639 Last, Calata contends that defense counsel was ineffective\nin failing to argue to the district court that the Restitution Act\nimpermissibly infringes on his constitutional right to have a jury\ndetermine the damages forming the basis of a civil judgment and\n\u201calso infringes on the due process rights he would have had in a\ncivil jury trial,\u201d which includes \u201cthe right to have apportionment\nfor fault . . . like he would have had in a civil court.\u201d Thus, in\nCalata\u2019s view, the Restitution Act is unconstitutional, and defense\ncounsel acted deficiently in not making such an argument to the\ndistrict court. He also claims that he was prejudiced as a result.\n\n\u00b640 Article I, Section 10 of the Utah Constitution \u201cguarantees\nthe right of jury trial in civil cases.\u201d Simler v. Chilel, 2016 UT 23,\n\u00b6 10, 379 P.3d 1195 (cleaned up); see also Utah Const. art. I, \u00a7 10\n(\u201cA jury in civil cases shall be waived unless demanded.\u201d). The\nRestitution Act defines the \u201cpecuniary damages\u201d resulting from\ncriminal activity that are part of a restitution order. \u201c\u2018Pecuniary\ndamages\u2019\u201d means, in part, \u201call demonstrable economic injury,\nwhether or not yet incurred, including those which a person could\nrecover in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting\nthe defendant\u2019s criminal activities.\u201d Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77-38a-\n102(6) (LexisNexis 2017) (emphasis added). And an order of\ncomplete restitution ultimately will be entered \u201con the civil\njudgment docket.\u201d Id. \u00a7 77-38a-401(1). Consequently, \u201ceven\nthough the restitution proceeding takes place as part of a criminal\nproceeding, the end result is a civil judgment that a victim is\nentitled to enforce.\u201d Ogden, 2018 UT 8, \u00b6 38. Calata derives from\nthis and other authority that the Utah Constitution\u2019s right to a jury\ntrial in civil cases entitles him to have a jury determine the\ndamages for purposes of a restitution order.\n\n\u00b641 Calata further argues that defense counsel should have\nraised these constitutional arguments because counsel should\nhave been aware of a footnote in Ogden in which the defendant\nthere contended that the Restitution Act is unconstitutional\nbecause it denied him \u201cdue process by preventing him access to\n\n\n\n 20200145-CA                       16               2022 UT App 127\n\f                           State v. Calata\n\n\nthe procedural remedies he would have had in civil court.\u201d Id.\n\u00b6 24 n.3 (cleaned up). Although the supreme court concluded that\nthe \u201cdue process argument [was] unpreserved and decline[d] to\nreview [the defendant\u2019s] ineffective assistance of counsel\nargument because it [was] inadequately briefed,\u201d id., Calata\nasserts that \u201cOgden would have alerted reasonable counsel to the\nimportance of considering constitutionality issues in regard to the\nLRA in restitution proceedings.\u201d\n\n\u00b642 Once again, Calata presents interesting arguments. But we\nneed not definitively determine whether the Restitution Act is in\nfact unconstitutional in the ways Calata claims. See State v. Huey,\n2022 UT App 94, \u00b6\u00b6 48, 53, 516 P.3d 345; State v. Squires, 2019 UT\nApp 113, \u00b6 32 n.7, 446 P.3d 581. Instead, because Calata did not\npreserve these arguments in the district court, our obligation is\nlimited to assessing whether it was \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d for\ndefense counsel not to raise these constitutional objections. See\nRay, 2020 UT 12, \u00b6 32. We conclude that it was not.\n\n\u00b643 Not only has no Utah appellate court addressed whether\ncriminal defendants have a right to jury trial on damages in\nrestitution proceedings, but on the facts of this case, it would not\nhave been unreasonable for defense counsel to conclude that\nCalata had little to gain from making these constitutional\narguments. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690 (judging counsel\u2019s\nchallenged conduct \u201con the facts of the particular case\u201d). Even if\ndefense counsel ultimately could have persuaded the district\ncourt that a jury should determine the damages for which Calata\nwas liable, counsel could have reasonably decided that a jury was\nunlikely to be sympathetic toward Calata or to find that the\ntroopers were at fault. See State v. Gallegos, 2020 UT 19, \u00b6 34, 463\nP.3d 641 (\u201cWe give wide latitude to trial counsel to make tactical\ndecisions and will not question such decisions unless there is no\nreasonable basis supporting them.\u201d (cleaned up)). Indeed, Calata\nfled from the troopers and endangered the public by leading a\nhigh-speed chase that ended only when the troopers executed PIT\nmaneuvers. Under the circumstances, counsel could have\nreasonably concluded that a jury would not be receptive to\n\n\n\n 20200145-CA                     17             2022 UT App 127\n\f                          State v. Calata\n\n\nCalata\u2019s efforts to minimize his own fault for these events and\nensuing damage and thus Calata was better off (or at least no\nworse off) arguing his case to the judge. Thus, defense counsel did\nnot act deficiently under Strickland, and Calata\u2019s claim for\nineffective assistance of counsel fails. See Archuleta, 2011 UT 73,\n\u00b6 41.\n\n\n                         CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b644 We reject Calata\u2019s two claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel and affirm the district court\u2019s order of complete\nrestitution. But we conclude that the court erred when it declined\nto determine court-ordered restitution. Accordingly, we affirm in\npart, reverse in part, and remand for the district court to\ndetermine court-ordered restitution in accordance with the\nRestitution Act.\n\n\n\n\n 20200145-CA                    18              2022 UT App 127\n\f",
