After a few false starts with\nappointed counsel, Jason Best decided that he wanted to\nrepresent himself at his trial on federal drug charges. The\ndistrict court permitted him to do so, after warning him of\nthe difficulties he faced and finding that his waiver of\ncounsel was knowing and intelligent. Best began his trial\nacting as his own advocate. On the morning of the second\nday, however, he changed his mind and asked the court to\nreinstate his attorneys; the court did so. The jury went on\nto convict Best of one count of conspiracy to distribute more\nthan 50 grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\n846, two counts of possession with intent to distribute crack\ncocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and two counts\n\f2                                               No. 04-1324\n\nof maintaining a place for distribution of crack cocaine in\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1). The court sentenced Best\nto life imprisonment.\n  In this appeal, Best attacks the court\u2019s initial acquies-\ncence in his motion to waive his right to counsel, as well as\nthe court\u2019s decision to continue with prior counsel for the\nbalance of the trial and sentencing. Best also argues that he\nis entitled to be resentenced, because his sentence violates\nthe principles announced in the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions\nin Blakely v. Washington, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (2004) (which had\nbeen decided by the time his opening brief was filed) and\nUnited States v. Booker, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005) (which\nappeared prior to oral argument). We affirm Best\u2019s convic-\ntion and order a limited remand of Best\u2019s sentence under\nthe terms set forth in United States v. Paladino, 401 F.3d\n471, 483-84 (7th Cir. 2005), for a determination whether the\ndistrict court would impose a different sentence under the\nnow-advisory Guidelines.\n\n\n                             I\n  Best was involved in a crack cocaine distribution opera-\ntion in Gary, Indiana, from 1997 to 2000. He ran at least six\ndrug houses, supplying crack and marijuana, hiring and\npaying dealers, scheduling work shifts, and picking up the\nprofits at the various locations. In 1997, the Gary Response\nInvestigative Team (GRIT), a federal drug task force that\nincluded Gary police officers, began investigating drug\nactivity in the Bronx area of Gary. GRIT arranged for\nseveral controlled buys at various drug houses. As a result\nof these buys, the police arrested several of Best\u2019s associ-\nates, who agreed to cooperate in the government\u2019s investiga-\ntion.\n On November 9, 1997, three police officers followed Juble\nHairston, a suspected drug dealer, to 532 Hovey Street.\nHairston entered the house and shut the door. The officers\n\fNo. 04-1324                                                 3\n\nknocked and asked to enter the home. After a few minutes,\nBest\u2019s cousin opened the door and let the officers in. Upon\ntheir entry, the agents found seven to eight men including\nBest and Hairston. They also found crack cocaine, a scale,\nbeakers, and plastic bags. After conducting a protective\nsweep of the home, they recovered two shotguns, three\nhandguns, and an assault rifle. The agents also found\n$1,293 in Best\u2019s pocket.\n  On November 21, 1997, the GRIT officers spotted Garrett\nSmith, who they knew had an outstanding murder warrant,\non the porch at 532 Hovey Street. Smith retreated into the\nhome. Fearing for the occupants\u2019 safety, the agents followed\nhim, forcing entry. There they found 35.7 grams of crack,\nammunition, scales, and plastic bags. Best was once again\non the scene, this time with $1,500 in his pocket. According\nto the testimony of Best\u2019s accomplices, Best then moved his\noperations to various other locations in Gary including 1536\nJackson Street and 798 Porter Street.\n    On October 17, 2000, a grand jury indicted Best along\nwith five other individuals for their involvement in distrib-\nuting and selling crack cocaine. The court appointed Clark\nW. Holesinger to represent Best. On January 19, 2001, a\nsuperseding indictment charged Best with nine counts\nrelated to his drug activities, one count for murder during\nthe course of the drug conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 924(j) and 924(c)(1), and one count for being a felon in\npossession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1)\nand 924(a)(2). At that point, the court appointed co-counsel\nfor Best, attorney Gary S. Germann. By February Best had\ngrown dissatisfied with his counsel. He wrote a letter to\nJudge Lozano requesting the appointment of new counsel.\nBut on February 14, 2001, Magistrate Judge Rodovich held\na hearing at which Best indicated that he was pleased with\nHolesinger; Judge Rodovich accordingly denied Best\u2019s\nmotion. Tensions evidently continued, however. On Septem-\nber 25, 2001, Germann moved to withdraw from represent-\n\f4                                              No. 04-1324\n\ning Best. The court granted his motion and appointed\nThomas W. Vanes to replace him. Shortly thereafter, the\ngovernment filed notice that it intended to seek the death\npenalty on the murder count. Judge Lozano reset the date\nfor Best\u2019s trial for April 2002.\n  On November 26, 2001, Best sent another letter to Judge\nLozano complaining that Holesinger was afraid of the\nprosecutor and that his counsel was not listening to him.\nBest indicated that he wanted to represent himself with the\nhelp of Vanes or have the court appoint an attorney from\noutside the area to represent him. On December 6, 2001,\nJudge Rodovich held another hearing on the matter, and\nonce again, Best stated that he was satisfied with\nHolesinger\u2019s representation.\n  The court set March 1, 2002, as the deadline for all pre-\ntrial motions. Best\u2019s lawyers failed to get their motions in\non time. They did, however, file a motion to sever the\nmurder and felon-in-possession counts from his drug\ncharges, which the court granted on May 28, 2002. At the\nsame time, it set July 15, 2002, as the start date for the\ntrial on the drug charges. On June 21, 2002, less than a\nmonth before the trial was scheduled to begin, counsel\nasked for leave to file late motions to suppress on Best\u2019s\ndrug charges. The reason they gave for their tardiness was\ntheir preoccupation with Best\u2019s death penalty charge, which\nthey had successfully managed to sever from the drug case\njust a few weeks earlier. Judge Lozano denied their motion.\n  On July 12, 2002, Best sent another letter to Judge\nLozano indicating that he wished to proceed pro se. Just\nbefore trial was to start on the 15th, Judge Lozano himself\nheld a hearing on Best\u2019s renewed request. At the hearing,\nJudge Lozano asked about Best\u2019s legal knowledge and\nskills. He specifically quizzed Best on his knowledge of the\nFederal Rules of Evidence, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, and the law.\n\fNo. 04-1324                                                5\n\nIn addition, he repeatedly warned Best of the dangers of\nself-representation and the exposure he faced on his\nupcoming death penalty trial. Before accepting Best\u2019s\nwaiver, he warned:\n    Mr. Best, I must advise you that, in my opinion, you\n    would be far better defended by a trained lawyer who is\n    accredited by a State Bar Association and by the state\n    itself, than you could be by defending yourself. I think\n    that it is unwise for you to try to represent yourself.\n    You are not familiar with the law sufficient [sic] to\n    defend yourself. You are not familiar with the Court\u2019s\n    procedures sufficient [sic] to defend yourself. You are\n    not familiar with the Rules of Evidence sufficient [sic]\n    to defend yourself. I would strongly urge you not to try\n    to represent yourself.\nThe judge then asked whether Best was making his deci-\nsion \u201centirely voluntarily and knowingly.\u201d After Best\nrepeatedly responded that he understood the implications\nof his decision, the court found that Best \u201cknowingly and\nvoluntarily waived his right to counsel\u201d and permitted Best\nto represent himself. It then appointed Holesinger and\nVanes to serve as standby counsel.\n  Best quickly became disillusioned with self-representa-\ntion. He handled the case only during the selection of the\njury and the first day of trial. On the morning of the second\nday, he asked the court to reinstate Vanes and Holesinger.\nUnenthusiastic, the two lawyers immediately filed a motion\nto withdraw and a motion for a mistrial. Vanes explained\nthat the restraints that the court had imposed on them in\ntheir role as standby counsel had made effective representa-\ntion impossible. They also complained that the first day of\ntrial had irreversibly harmed Best\u2019s case in a number of\nways: the government had introduced evidence about the\nNovember 9, 1997, search of 532 Hovey Street despite the\nfact that the court had sustained Best\u2019s objection based on\n\f6                                                No. 04-1324\n\nthe lack of a search warrant; GRIT supervisor Mark Becker\nwas permitted to testify that GRIT was involved in drug\nand gang investigations; and Best failed to object when\nGary Police Officer Troy Campbell testified that a certain\nexhibit was an accurate copy of Best\u2019s parole ID card with\nthe exception of certain redactions, which was a veiled\nreference to Best\u2019s criminal history. Notwithstanding both\nthe lawyers\u2019 objections and Best\u2019s, the court reinstated\nVanes and Holesinger as Best\u2019s counsel and proceeded with\nthe trial. On July 23, 2002, the jury convicted Best on five\nof the seven counts.\n  On August 26, 2002, Best filed a pro se motion for a new\ntrial, claiming that Vanes and Holesinger had rendered\nineffective assistance of counsel. Best complained that they\nhad failed to investigate and call witnesses whom Best had\nidentified; they had failed to file timely motions to suppress;\nand they had failed to object to the indictment, jury instruc-\ntions, and verdict form for not including a specific drug\nquantity. Judge Lozano held a hearing on August 30, 2002,\nat which he inquired into Best\u2019s allegations. Holesinger and\nVanes offered strategic reasons for most of the decisions\nBest had mentioned. For example, they did not call the\nwitnesses that Best had named because they thought it was\na bad idea to have individuals who were incarcerated\ntestifying on his behalf. Their defense strategy was instead\nto try to impeach the government\u2019s witnesses, who were all\nincarcerated, many in the same location. Best\u2019s lawyers\nhoped to show that the government\u2019s witnesses had con-\ncocted stories against Best. They admitted, however, that\nJuble Hairston and Garrett Smith could have served as\nwitnesses for the motions to suppress had they filed timely\nmotions.\n  On September 6, 2002, the court ordered counsel to file\npost-trial motions to suppress. On September 11, Vanes and\nHolesinger filed a second motion to withdraw, claiming that\n\fNo. 04-1324                                                   7\n\ntheir testimony at the August 30 hearing created an\nirreconcilable conflict with Best. On October 3, 2002, after\nanother hearing, the court concluded that counsel could\ncontinue to represent Best adequately. The suppression\nhearing took place on November 1 and 15, 2002; a year\nlater, on November 26, 2003, the court denied those mo-\ntions.\n   On December 1, 2003, the court held Best\u2019s sentencing\nhearing. Best complained to the court again about his\nlawyers and asked the court to appoint substitute counsel.\nThe court refused, instead giving Best the choice of proceed-\ning pro se or staying with Vanes and Holesinger. Best\ndecided to proceed with them, although he felt that the\ncourt had put him to an unfair choice. The court imposed a\nlife sentence on Count One, 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on\nCount Two, 480 months on Count Three, and 240 months\neach on Counts Seven and Eight, with all terms to be\nserved concurrently.\n\n\n                              II\n  We begin with Best\u2019s claims about his representation at\ntrial, which relate to the court\u2019s initial decision to allow him\nto represent himself, the effectiveness of appointed counsel\nat the trial stage, and the court\u2019s refusal to appoint substi-\ntute counsel for the sentencing hearing.\n  The Supreme Court has held that a defendant has the\nright under the Sixth Amendment to waive his right to\ncounsel and proceed pro se. Faretta v. California, 422 U.S.\n806, 819 (1975). Nonetheless, a defendant is normally ill-\nadvised to avail himself of that right, given how difficult it\nis to face an experienced prosecutor and navigate the\ncomplexities of both criminal procedure and criminal law.\n\u201cBecause of the importance of the right to counsel in our\nconstitutional scheme, we do not lightly conclude that a\ndefendant has waived his right to counsel. Accordingly, we\n\f8                                                No. 04-1324\n\nwill indulge every reasonable presumption against the\nwaiver.\u201d United States v. Sandles, 23 F.3d 1121, 1125-26\n(7th Cir. 1994) (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). In the end, however, we must uphold a defen-\ndant\u2019s waiver of counsel if it was knowing and intelligent.\nId. at 1126.\n  In reviewing whether a criminal defendant\u2019s waiver of the\nright to counsel was knowing and intelligent, we consider\nfour factors: \u201c(1) whether and to what extent the district\njudge conducted a formal inquiry; (2) other evidence in the\nrecord that establishes whether the defendant in fact\nunderstood the dangers and disadvantages of\nself-representation; (3) the background and experience of\nthe defendant; and (4) the context of the defendant\u2019s\ndecision to proceed pro se.\u201d Sandles, 23 F.3d at 1126. See\nalso United States v. Egwaoje, 335 F.3d 579, 585 (7th Cir.\n2003).\n  Here, the first factor\u2014whether the court conducted a\nformal inquiry into Best\u2019s waiver\u2014points strongly toward\na finding that the waiver was knowing and intelligent. The\ndistrict judge carefully followed the model inquiry from the\nBenchbook for U.S. District Court Judges (4th ed. 1996,\nwith 2000 rev.), as he conducted the required inquiry.\nAlthough this court has held that it is not strictly necessary\nto follow the Benchbook, see Egwaoje, 335 F.3d at 585\n(affirming our holding in United States v. Moya-Gomez, 860\nF.2d 706, 732-33 (7th Cir. 1988), and rejecting a rule\ncompelling the adoption of the model inquiry set forth in\nthe federal Benchbook), it was certainly a sound approach\nfor the judge to take. Compare United States v. McDowell,\n814 F.2d 245, 249-50 (6th Cir. 1987) (requiring that district\ncourts use the model inquiry or \u201cone covering the same\nsubstantive points\u201d on the record to determine whether a\ndefendant\u2019s waiver is knowing and intelligent).\n    At the July 15, 2002, hearing, Judge Lozano asked Best\n\fNo. 04-1324                                               9\n\nspecific questions about his knowledge of the law, the\nFederal Rules of Evidence, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, and the federal Sentencing Guidelines. He also\nwarned Best about ways in which his first trial might\nimplicate his second trial, in which the government was\nseeking the death penalty. For example, he pointed out that\n\u201cin your questioning you might by accident acknowledge\nsomething that you may not want to acknowledge, or the\nwitness may say something in which you have not been able\nto cross-examine properly, and you will be stuck with that\nanswer.\u201d\n   Best now argues that the court\u2019s inquiry was inadequate\nbecause it failed to explore his educational background, and\nif it had done so, it would have learned that he had only a\nGED. But this one omission by the court does not automati-\ncally render the inquiry insufficient. Taken as a whole, the\nrecord shows that the court\u2019s inquiry into Best\u2019s knowledge\nand decision to waive his right to counsel was more than\nadequate. See also United States v. Bell, 901 F.2d 574, 579\n(7th Cir. 1990) (finding that the defendant knowingly and\nintelligently waived his right to counsel even though the\nmagistrate\u2019s warnings on the dangers of self-representation\nwere inadequate).\n  The second factor we evaluate is whether the defendant\nunderstood the danger and disadvantage of self-representa-\ntion. In other cases we have found that a defendant\u2019s\nadmission of lack of legal expertise, along with evidence\nthat former counsel warned the defendant of the \u201cpitfalls of\nself-representation\u201d and \u201cobvious reliance on standby\ncounsel during trial,\u201d are factors that weighed in favor of\nfinding waiver. Sandles, 23 F.3d at 1128. Several of those\nfactors exist here.\n  Best relied on his standby counsel during jury selection\nand in presenting a challenge to the venire. He mentioned\nthat he did not prepare the motion to quash the petit jury\n\f10                                                No. 04-1324\n\nvenire. At that point, however, the court warned Best that\nit would not allow \u201chybrid representation\u201d and again\nwarned Best of the \u201cdrawbacks\u201d of self-representation. After\na brief recess for Best to meet with his standby counsel,\nBest decided to remain pro se. During the first day of trial,\nBest made several statements to the jury that almost\nbragged about his lack of legal skill. In his opening state-\nment, Best announced:\n     This ain\u2019t my bag. He\u2019s a prosecutor, he\u2019s trained to try\n     trials. This is my first time ever. I don\u2019t even basically\n     know what to say, but I have two great attorneys over\n     there, but this is so\u2014I feel it\u2019s so simple\u2014it\u2019s so compli-\n     cated that it\u2019s simple. My attorneys don\u2019t know.\nBest went so far as to request a cautionary instruction\ntelling the jury not to hold his self-representation against\nhim. Finally, of course, by the morning of the second day of\ntrial Best asked the court whether it was \u201cpossible [for him]\nto go back to [his] attorneys.\u201d We find that the second factor\nalso weighs in favor of finding that Best understood the risk\nhe faced in representing himself.\n  Next, we consider Best\u2019s background and experience\nincluding \u201ceducational achievements, prior experience with\nthe legal system (including prior pro se representation), and\nperformance at trial in the case at bar.\u201d Sandles, 23 F.3d at\n1128. The court inquired into Best\u2019s legal education, but it\ndid not investigate his general education level. It now\nappears that Best has a GED, no college education, and a\nlegal education limited to 18 months of study with jailhouse\nlawyers while he was incarcerated at the MCC. He had\nnever represented himself in a prior legal proceeding.\n  Best did not do well while he was representing himself, as\nhis lawyers pointed out when they moved to withdraw\nrather than be reinstated as counsel. He did not raise\nimportant objections to Officer Campbell\u2019s testimony about\n\fNo. 04-1324                                                 11\n\nBest\u2019s parole ID card, Officer Becker\u2019s reference to gang\nactivity, and he allowed the government to proceed through\na sustained objection on a Fourth Amendment violation.\nThe combination of his lack of experience representing\nhimself, his relatively limited educational background and\nknowledge of the law, and whatever hindsight we legiti-\nmately can glean from his actual performance at trial weigh\nagainst finding that he knowingly and intelligently waived\nhis right to the assistance of counsel.\n  Finally, the context of Best\u2019s decision to proceed pro se is\nimportant. Best appears to have been a difficult client; at\nthe very least, it is clear that he had a contentious relation-\nship with his lawyers for virtually the entire duration of the\nproceeding. While Best\u2019s position was not always consistent,\nhe repeatedly complained about their representation of him\nand requested the court to appoint new counsel for him. The\ndistrict judge was in a better position to evaluate Best\u2019s\nmotives than we are. The judge\u2019s conclusion that Best had\nknowingly and intelligently opted for the lesser of two\nevils\u2014self-representation as opposed to the lawyers he so\ndisliked\u2014was a reasonable one. Evaluating this record as\na whole, we find that it demonstrates Best\u2019s knowing and\nintelligent waiver.\n\n\n                             III\n  Next, Best contends that he received ineffective assis-\ntance of counsel at both the guilt phase and the sentencing\nphase of the trial. We consider first his arguments relating\nto the guilt phase, and then his sentencing arguments\nrelating to the assistance of counsel.\n\n\n                              A\n  At the guilt phase, Best\u2019s lawyers presented only one\ntestifying witness on his behalf, and they failed to investi-\n\f12                                               No. 04-1324\n\ngate other witnesses Best identified for them, particularly\na number who were present during the raids on the alleged\ndrug houses.\n  Normally, we do not review ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claims on direct review. There is an exception to\nthat rule, however, for cases in which the defendant\u2019s claim\n\u201ccan be fully evaluated only on the record below, [ ] and not\nextrinsic evidence.\u201d United States v. Holman, 314 F.3d 837,\n839 (7th Cir. 2002). Here, the district court permitted a full\npost-trial hearing on the question whether Best\u2019s lawyers\nwere ineffective, in response to his pro se motion for new\ntrial. This is therefore the exceptional case where the record\npermits us to reach the question now.\n   Under the familiar Strickland standard, Best must show\nthat his counsels\u2019 performance was deficient and that the\ndeficient performance resulted in prejudice. Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 688, 692 (1984). We review those\ntwo questions de novo. Holman, 314 F.3d at 839. To estab-\nlish that counsels\u2019 performance was deficient, Best must\nshow that it fell below an \u201cobjective standard of reasonable-\nness.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. \u201cOur review of the\nattorney\u2019s performance is highly deferential and reflects a\nstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the\nwide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is,\nthe defendant must overcome the presumption that, under\nthe circumstances, the challenged action might be consid-\nered sound trial strategy.\u201d Davis v. Lambert, 388 F.3d 1052,\n1059 (7th Cir. 2004) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). To establish prejudice,\nthe defendant must show that \u201cthere is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the\nresult of the proceeding would have been different. A\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to under-\nmine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n694.\n\fNo. 04-1324                                                 13\n\n  A lawyer\u2019s failure to investigate potential defenses may\nconstitute deficient performance under Strickland. See\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 691; see also Lambert, 388 F.3d at\n1062 (holding that petitioner\u2019s claim that defense counsel\nfailed to investigate witnesses met the performance element\nof Strickland); Washington v. Smith, 219 F.3d 620, 630-31\n(7th Cir. 2000) (finding defense counsel\u2019s investigation of\none of fourteen witnesses satisfied the performance element\nfor an ineffective assistance of counsel claim). Nevertheless,\nas we have recognized, \u201c[a] lawyer\u2019s decision to call or not\nto call a witness is a strategic decision generally not subject\nto review. The Constitution does not oblige counsel to\npresent each and every witness that is suggested to him.\u201d\nUnited States v. Williams, 106 F.3d 1362, 1367 (7th Cir.\n1997) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). If\ncounsel has investigated witnesses and consciously decided\nnot to call them, the decision is probably strategic. An\noutright failure to investigate witnesses, however, is more\nlikely to be a sign of deficient performance. See Rompilla v.\nBeard, 125 S.Ct. 2456, 2466 (2005) (\u201cIt is the duty of the\nlawyer to conduct a prompt investigation of the circum-\nstances of the case and to explore all avenues leading to\nfacts relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty in\nthe event of conviction.\u201d) (quoting 1 ABA Standards for\nCriminal Justice 4-4.1 (2d ed. 1982 supp.)). Whether\ndeficient performance occurred, however, depends on factors\nlike counsel\u2019s overall diligence, the likely relevance of the\nwitness\u2019s testimony, whether alternative ways of proving\nthe point exist, and the strength of the government\u2019s case.\nCompare Washington, 219 F.3d at 630-32 (finding that\nfailure to investigate or call witnesses where \u201c[counsel]\nadmitted that he did no investigating because of the \u2018late\ndate\u2019 and because he was \u2018busy trying the case\u2019 \u201d was\ndeficient and prejudicial) with Williams, 106 F.3d at 1367\n(in a felon-in-possession case, counsel\u2019s failure to call alibi\nwitnesses where the government had proved each element\nof the crime was not deficient performance).\n\f14                                              No. 04-1324\n\n  Best provided a list of names of all the individuals who\nwere present during the two raids at the house on Hovey\nStreet and were allegedly part of the crack distribution\nring. Best\u2019s lawyers testified that they attempted to contact\nthe witnesses, but only one responded, Garrett Smith.\nMoreover, counsel did not receive the names from Best until\nafter the time for filing motions to suppress had expired.\nWhen they met with Smith, he told them in the presence of\nhis counsel that he would testify that the police had no idea\nwho he was. Instead, he said, when the police arrived at 532\nHovey Street on November 21, 1997, they came with dogs\nand arrested everyone in the home and only later learned\nof Smith\u2019s identity and his arrest warrant. This testimony\nwould have conflicted with testimony from the police\nofficers that they had followed Smith into the home because\nthey knew there was a murder warrant out for his arrest,\nand this was enough to support the conclusion that exigent\ncircumstances permitted them to enter the home.\n   Under the circumstances, Holesinger explained, he and\nVanes concluded that Smith would not be a useful witness\nfor Best at the trial, even if he could have helped with the\nmotion to suppress. They believed that the jury would not\n\u201cappreciate necessarily the niceties of Fourth Amendment\nlitigation.\u201d Furthermore, nothing Smith was prepared to\nsay would have cast any doubt on Best\u2019s connection to the\ndrugs and money found at the house. With this in mind,\nthey made the strategic decision not to call Smith at Best\u2019s\ntrial.\n  Holesinger also testified that Juble Hairston was \u201cfirst\nand foremost a potential witness for any motion to sup-\npress.\u201d Holesinger attempted to contact Hairston before\ntrial, but he was unsuccessful. Hairston, the individual\nwhom the police followed to the Hovey Street house on\nNovember 9, 1997, eventually testified on behalf of Best at\nthe post-trial suppression hearing.\n  In addition, Best wanted counsel to call Radar Tyler, who\n\fNo. 04-1324                                               15\n\n(according to Best) wrote a letter on behalf of Quincy\nJamison, one of Best\u2019s accomplices who testified for the\ngovernment. Counsel described their decision not to call\nTyler as strategic and said that they were able to prove on\ncross examination that Jamison was not able to read or\nwrite and could not have written the letters himself.\n  Best\u2019s counsel claimed that they did not call other\nwitnesses who were present during the raids because they\nwere incarcerated and the lawyers did not want witnesses\n\u201cwearing jumpsuits\u201d to testify on Best\u2019s behalf. They\nthought that this would undermine their defense strategy,\nwhich again was to discredit the government\u2019s witnesses as\nall being incarcerated together and \u201cconcocting up stories\ntogether\u201d against Best.\n  Taken together, these are not the strongest strategic\njustifications we have seen for presenting such a skimpy\ndefense. The problem is less with who was called than it is\nwith who was investigated. Few decisions not to present\ntestimony can be considered \u201cstrategic\u201d before some investi-\ngation has taken place. As we explained in United States ex\nrel. Hampton v. Leibach, 347 F.3d 219 (7th Cir. 2003),\n\u201cstrategic choices made after less than complete investiga-\ntion are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable\nprofessional judgments support the limitations on investiga-\ntion.\u201d Id. at 247 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. 690-91)\n(emphasis added). \u201cThough there may be unusual cases\nwhen an attorney can make a rational decision that investi-\ngation is unnecessary, as a general rule an attorney must\ninvestigate a case in order to provide minimally competent\nprofessional representation.\u201d Crisp v. Duckworth, 743 F.2d\n580, 583 (7th Cir. 1984).\n  We need not decide, however, whether this performance\nwas so deficient that it flunks the first part of the Strick-\nland test, because Best cannot show that he was prejudiced\nby any or all of these problems. The government had\n\f16                                             No. 04-1324\n\noverwhelming evidence of Best\u2019s guilt, including 21 wit-\nnesses testifying that Best was involved in selling and\ndistributing crack. The government\u2019s witnesses gave\ndetailed accounts of Best\u2019s involvement in supplying and\norganizing crack distribution in Gary. For example, Quincy\nJamison described himself as a \u201cminor worker\u201d for Best.\nJamison testified that Best paid him $1,000 a week to sell\ncrack for three eight-hour shifts at 1536 Jackson Street.\nDuring the two raids at Hovey Street, the agents found Best\nin the presence of crack and firearms with large sums of\ncash on his person. Therefore, Best cannot show a reason-\nable probability that the outcome of his trial would have\nbeen different had the lawyers done exactly what he\nwished.\n\n\n                            B\n  Best also complains that he received constitutionally\nineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing\nproceeding. He focuses his appeal, however, on the court\u2019s\ndenial of his request to appoint substitute counsel, rather\nthan on the performance rendered by the lawyers he had.\nWe review the denial to appoint substitute counsel for an\nabuse of discretion. United States v. Bjorkman, 270 F.3d\n482, 500 (7th Cir. 2001).\n  In determining whether the district court abused its\ndiscretion in denying such a motion, we have structured our\ninquiry around three non-exclusive factors: \u201c(1) the timeli-\nness of the motion; (2) the adequacy of the court\u2019s inquiry\ninto the defendant\u2019s motion; (3) whether the conflict was so\ngreat that it resulted in a total lack of communication\npreventing an adequate defense.\u201d Bjorkman, 270 F.3d at\n500.\n  As the record reflects, Best had been trying for a long\ntime to obtain new appointed counsel. After his conviction,\nhe tried again on August 26, 2002, one month before his\n\fNo. 04-1324                                                 17\n\nsentencing hearing was originally scheduled but more than\na year before it eventually took place. Vanes and Holesinger\nwere in favor of the motion, and the government agreed\nthat \u201cgood cause\u201d existed to remove them because an\n\u201cirreconcilable conflict exists between the attorneys and the\ndefendant.\u201d\n  One reason the court gave for denying Best\u2019s motion for\nnew counsel was that it was filed two months before Best\u2019s\ndeath penalty trial was supposed to begin and his attorneys\nhad already submitted charges for over $100,000. Later,\nBest\u2019s murder charges were vacated and dismissed. Al-\nthough the government points out that the dismissal of\nthose charges made the timeliness factor relatively unim-\nportant ex post, we must assume that the district court did\nnot have 20-20 foresight. At the time the court was required\nto rule, it was reasonable for the court to disfavor a change\nin lawyers because it would disrupt the overall ongoing\nproceedings.\n  The court also made an adequate inquiry into the need for\nnew counsel. At the hearing on August 30, 2002, the court\nheard what both Best and the two attorneys had to say\nabout their relationship. It also had the benefit of its\nobservations at the trial, which counsel had conducted after\nthey lost their motion to withdraw. In denying Best\u2019s\nmotion, the court concluded that \u201ctrial counsel did not allow\nthe potential conflict of interest they were facing as a result\nof Defendant\u2019s accusations [regarding their ineffectiveness]\nto develop into an actual conflict.\u201d\n  Finally, we consider whether the conflict between Best\nand his attorneys \u201cresulted in a total lack of communication\npreventing an adequate defense.\u201d Bjorkman, 270 F.3d at\n500. All parties agree that Best and his counsel had a\ncontentious relationship during the course of his trial. The\ncourt was entitled to conclude, based on what occurred at\nthe trial, that total breakdown had not occurred, and thus\n\f18                                              No. 04-1324\n\nthat it was not necessary to replace Vanes and Holesinger\nfor the sentencing phase. And indeed, the two lawyers\nhandled the sentencing proceeding professionally. They\nobjected to the drug quantities attributed to Best and to\nhow the government made its calculations. They objected to\nfinding that Best himself possessed a firearm in connection\nwith drug trafficking when the weapons were found with so\nmany other individuals in the home. On this record, we find\nthat the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Best\u2019s\nmotion for new counsel.\n\n\n                            IV\n  Finally, Best argues that his sentence violates the Sixth\nAmendment. The court sentenced Best to life imprisonment\nbased on its conclusion that his offense level was a level 44\nand a Criminal History Category V. The court found that\nover 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base were attributable to Best.\nThe court also found that he possessed a dangerous weapon\nin connection with drug trafficking and the court applied a\ntwo-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). The\ncourt finally concluded that he was an organizer or leader\nof five or more participants in the crime and imposed a four-\nlevel enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1(a).\n   Best does not challenge these computations as erroneous\nunder the Guidelines, and so we may take them as a proper\nstarting point. Nonetheless, under Booker it is now estab-\nlished that the Guidelines are advisory only. Because the\ncourt sentenced Best under the assumption that the\nGuidelines were mandatory, we order a limited remand\nunder the procedures outlined in United States v. Paladino,\n401 F.3d 471, 483-84 (7th Cir. 2005), so that the district\ncourt may inform us whether it is inclined to impose the\nsame sentence under the now-advisory Guidelines.\n\fNo. 04-1324                                           19\n\n                           V\n  We AFFIRM Best\u2019s conviction and order a LIMITED REMAND\nto the district court under Paladino.\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                      ________________________________\n                      Clerk of the United States Court of\n                        Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                 USCA-02-C-0072\u201410-24-05\n\f",
