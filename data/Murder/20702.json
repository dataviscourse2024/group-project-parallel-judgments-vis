A jury convicted Scott Wynne of murdering his\nneighbor, Philip Timmerman, and the trial court sentenced him to life in prison. Unable\nto obtain relief from the state courts, Wynne petitioned the federal district court for a\nwrit of habeas corpus. The district court granted the writ, holding that the state courts\ndenied Wynne his constitutional right to present a complete defense when it refused\nunder state evidentiary rules to admit propensity evidence designed to show that\nsomeone else\u2014namely, the prosecution\u2019s key witness\u2014committed the murder. We\nreverse.\n\n                                           I.\n\n       On May 18, 1995, Timmerman was shot to death while working on his farm. No\neyewitnesses to the shooting emerged, but several pieces of physical evidence linked\nWynne to the crime. Ballistics evidence identified Wynne\u2019s .45 caliber pistol as the\nmurder weapon. Wynne\u2019s fingerprint appeared on the weapon\u2019s ammunition magazine.\nAnd footprints at the crime scene matched boots found in Wynne\u2019s house. Wynne also\nhad a motive. Three days after the shooting, Wynne\u2019s friend Mark Peckham contacted\nthe police, telling them that he had heard Wynne say he wanted to kill Timmerman on\nseveral occasions, apparently because he thought Timmerman\u2019s long-term lease on the\nWynne family farm would terminate upon Timmerman\u2019s death. Wynne was so\nfrustrated about his land dispute with Timmerman, Peckham said, that he spoke with\nPeckham ten to thirty times about murdering Timmerman, sometimes in conversations\nthat turned into detailed descriptions of how he would carry out the crime.\n\n       In October 1995, Wynne stood trial for Timmerman\u2019s murder. As part of his\ndefense, Wynne alleged that Peckham had killed Timmerman. The trial court allowed\nWynne to introduce the following evidence to support this theory: Peckham wanted to\nframe him to retaliate for various wrongs, including Wynne\u2019s purported firing of\n\fNos. 03-2319; 09-1148             Wynne v. Renico                                     Page 3\n\n\nPeckham five months before the murder; Peckham acknowledged he had fired some of\nWynne\u2019s guns in the past and knew where Wynne kept most of his guns, including the\n.45 caliber murder weapon; Peckham told an investigator he was \u201creally pissed\u201d at\nWynne because Wynne \u201chad everything given to him and never returned anything to\n[his] family,\u201d App\u2019x at 2086; and Peckham\u2019s insurance agent testified that Peckham had\ntold him at least three or four times in the week after Wynne\u2019s arrest that Peckham was\n\u201cgoing to put [Wynne] away,\u201d id. at 2180.\n\n        The trial court, however, drew the line at evidence directed only to Peckham\u2019s\nbad character. The court excluded testimony by Peckham\u2019s former girlfriend that, eight\nyears before the murder when she was in middle school, he had threatened to cut off the\nfingers of a classmate who touched her breasts. It excluded her testimony that, several\nyears earlier, Peckham had abused her and threatened to kill her and that Peckham\u2019s\ntrailer mysteriously burned down within hours of their break-up. It excluded testimony\nthat, after a failed suicide attempt five years earlier, Peckham declined psychologically,\nbecoming \u201cpassive aggressive\u201d and intent on exacting revenge in secretive ways. Id. at\n1952. And it excluded evidence of Peckham\u2019s alleged admission to a co-worker several\nmonths before the murder that he had \u201cdone something so bad in his past that if the\npolice ever found out about it he would go to prison for life.\u201d Id. at 2070.\n\n        The trial court also excluded evidence about Peckham\u2019s apparent interest in\nwomen\u2019s underwear. At some point during the trial, Wynne\u2019s investigator discovered\na blue bag in Wynne\u2019s house, which contained a boot with tread that matched the\nfootprints found at the crime scene. The defense did not mention until several days after\ndelivering the bag to the court that it found a black camisole near the bag. With this\nevidence, the defense sought to link Peckham to the bag via his apparent underwear\nfascination, but the court would not allow it.\n\n        A jury convicted Wynne of murder, and the trial court sentenced him to life in\nprison. See People v. Wynne, No. 192512, 1999 WL 33328893, at *1 (Mich. Ct. App.\nDec. 3, 1999). After failing to obtain relief in the state courts, Wynne filed a petition for\na writ of federal habeas corpus in June 2001, arguing that the trial court violated his\n\fNos. 03-2319; 09-1148             Wynne v. Renico                                     Page 4\n\n\nconstitutional right to present a complete defense by excluding the Peckham evidence.\nIn September 2003, the district court granted the writ. See 279 F. Supp. 2d. 866 (E.D.\nMich.). After the State filed a notice of appeal, both parties alerted the district court that\nit had premised part of its ruling on several factual inaccuracies in Wynne\u2019s pleadings,\nwhich the Michigan Attorney General\u2019s Office had failed to notice. At Wynne\u2019s request,\nwe remanded the case to the district court to take a second look at the case, including the\nnew light cast on it by the revised characterizations of the evidence. In January 2009,\nthe district court issued a supplemental opinion, which also granted the writ but revised\nits reasons for doing so. See 595 F. Supp. 2d. 775.\n\n                                             II.\n\n         Although Wynne filed his habeas petition after the Anti-Terrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 went into effect, see Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 326\n(1997), we give fresh review to his federal claim because the state courts addressed only\nhis state law grounds for relief, see Wynne, 1999 WL 33328893, at *1, which means they\ndid not \u201cadjudicate[]\u201d the federal claim \u201con the merits,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); see Maples\nv. Stegall, 340 F.3d 433, 436 (6th Cir. 2003) (\u201cWhere, as here, the state court did not\nassess the merits of a claim properly raised in a habeas petition, the deference due under\nAEDPA does not apply.\u201d). The State does not argue that Wynne has failed to exhaust\nhis federal claim in the state courts or that a procedural bar otherwise applies to this\nclaim.\n\n         The Constitution guarantees \u201ca meaningful opportunity to present a complete\ndefense,\u201d Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 690 (1986) (quotation marks omitted), but\n\u201cnot an unlimited right to ride roughshod over reasonable evidentiary restrictions,\u201d\nRockwell v. Yukins, 341 F.3d 507, 512 (6th Cir. 2003) (en banc). A defendant must\n\u201ccomply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both\nfairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.\u201d Chambers v.\nMississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 302 (1973).               The right to present a complete\ndefense\u2014including the third-party culpability defense raised here\u2014thus does not mean\nthat a defendant may introduce whatever evidence he wishes, only that any state-law\n\fNos. 03-2319; 09-1148           Wynne v. Renico                                   Page 5\n\n\nevidentiary restrictions cannot be \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201cdisproportionate to the purposes they\nare designed to serve.\u201d United States v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 303, 308 (1998) (quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n       The question here, then, is not whether the Michigan courts properly construed\none of the State\u2019s evidentiary rules, namely Evidence Rule 404(b)\u2019s prohibition against\nintroducing character evidence to show that an individual acted consistently with the\nevidence. It is whether the state courts\u2019 construction of their evidentiary rule\u2014a matter\nfor them, not for us, to decide\u2014violates the Sixth Amendment right to present a\ncomplete defense.\n\n       Unfortunately for Wynne, we already have resolved the point. In United States\nv. Lucas, 357 F.3d 599 (6th Cir. 2004), the defendant tried to introduce propensity\nevidence\u2014a previous conviction for cocaine possession\u2014to prove that a third party, not\nthe defendant, committed a drug crime. Id. at 604. Relying on Federal Rule 404(b),\nwhich likewise bars evidence about a person\u2019s character \u201cin order to show action in\nconformity therewith,\u201d the district court excluded the evidence. In affirming, we first\nexplained that Federal Rule 404(b) applies to all propensity evidence, whether used to\nshow that the defendant or another individual acted in conformity with their prior\nmisconduct. Id. at 606. We then rejected Lucas\u2019 constitutional argument. The Sixth\nAmendment right to present \u201ca complete defense,\u201d we explained, \u201cdoes not imply a right\nto offer evidence that is otherwise inadmissible under the standard rules of evidence.\u201d\nId. And \u201c[t]he exclusion of [the third party\u2019s] prior conviction,\u201d we explained, \u201cdid not\nviolate Lucas\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense,\u201d because \u201cLucas was able to\nexplore her theory that [another individual] was in fact the culprit\u201d through other\nevidence. Id. at 606\u201307.\n\n       What was true in Lucas is true today. Just as Federal Rule 404(b) permissibly\nlimited Lucas\u2019s right to introduce propensity evidence directed toward a third party, so\nthe same kind of state law evidentiary rule\u2014indeed essentially the same rule, see Mich.\nR. Evid. 404(b)\u2014permissibly limited Wynne\u2019s right to introduce propensity evidence\nabout Peckham. And just as this rule did not bar Lucas from introducing other evidence\n\fNos. 03-2319; 09-1148            Wynne v. Renico                                   Page 6\n\n\nto support this defense, so the same was true for Wynne, who introduced considerable\nnon-propensity-based evidence in support of the Peckham-did-it defense. The court, for\nexample, allowed Wynne to introduce the following: Peckham wanted to frame Wynne\nto retaliate for various wrongs, including Wynne\u2019s purported firing of Peckham five\nmonths before the murder; Peckham acknowledged he had fired some of Wynne\u2019s guns\nin the past and knew where Wynne kept most of his guns, including the .45 caliber\nmurder weapon; Peckham told an investigator he was \u201creally pissed\u201d at Wynne because\nWynne \u201chad everything given to him and never returned anything to [his] family,\u201d\nApp\u2019x at 2086; and Peckham\u2019s insurance agent testified that Peckham had told him at\nleast three or four times in the week after Wynne\u2019s arrest that Peckham was \u201cgoing to\nput [Wynne] away,\u201d id. at 2180. The state trial court, in short, permitted Wynne to\nintroduce considerable evidence that Peckham was the murderer, and accordingly its\nreasonable limit on sheer propensity evidence, some of it eight years old and much of\nit far removed from the issues in the case, did not deprive Wynne of his right to make\na complete defense.\n\n       That leaves one other contention\u2014that the state trial court misapplied its own\nrule of evidence. But we cannot grant the writ based on our disagreement with \u201cstate-\ncourt determinations on state-law questions,\u201d Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 68\n(1991), unless the state-court determination is so \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d that it deprives\na defendant of due process, Bey v. Bagley, 500 F.3d 514, 519\u201320 (6th Cir. 2007).\nWynne does not argue that the state court\u2019s application of Michigan Rule 404(b) was so\naskew that it violated this standard.      And his explanations for introducing the\nevidence\u2014that it would show Peckham\u2019s \u201ccharacter for seeking secretive revenge, his\nviolent tendencies, mental deterioration, and readiness to frame another\u201d and that\nPeckham \u201cwas capable of murdering Timmerman\u201d and framing Wynne, Wynne\u2019s Br. at\n46\u2014represent precisely the kind of propensity evidence that any court (state or federal)\nreasonably could exclude, whether under Rule 404(b) or for that matter under Rule 403.\n\n       In defense of the district court\u2019s contrary ruling, we note that it faced a more\nvexing question when it first granted the writ in 2003. Not only had our 2004 Lucas\n\fNos. 03-2319; 09-1148           Wynne v. Renico                                   Page 7\n\n\ndecision not yet come down, but the parties\u2019 filings up to that point also suggested that\nPeckham\u2019s episodes of erratic behavior occurred soon before\u2014and even soon\nafter\u2014Timmerman\u2019s murder. It later became clear that much of Wynne\u2019s propensity\nevidence against Peckham stemmed from events up to eight years earlier. Now that the\nparties have corrected the record, and now that we have Lucas to guide us, there is far\nless to Wynne\u2019s position.\n\n                                          III.\n\n       For these reasons, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment.\n\fNos. 03-2319; 09-1148                  Wynne v. Renico                                             Page 8\n\n\n                                     _____________________\n\n                                        CONCURRENCE\n                                     _____________________\n\n         BOYCE F. MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge, concurring. I concur in the reasoning\nand conclusion of the lead opinion, but do so with reservations because the analysis and\nconclusion are based on a faulty precedential foundation. The majority has found that\nthe district court erred in granting Scott Wynne habeas relief on the ground that the state\ncourt denied Wynne his constitutional right to present a defense. The state court refused\nunder state evidentiary rule 404(b) to admit evidence that Wynne proffered to show that\na third party committed the murder and framed Wynne for its commission. As the\nmajority states, we cannot grant habeas relief solely because we disagree with a state\ncourt\u2019s interpretation of its own evidentiary rules. Rather, in order to grant habeas in this\ncase, we must find that the state court\u2019s application of its evidentiary rules (1) were\narbitrary and disproportionate to the purpose the state rule was designed to serve, and\n(2) deprived Wynne of his Sixth Amendment right to present a defense.1 Further, as the\nmajority correctly points out, in United States v. Lucas, 357 F.3d 599, 606 (6th Cir.\n2004) we held that the identical 404(b) analysis engaged in by the Michigan state court\nalso applies in this Court \u201cgenerally . . . in cases where such evidence is used with\nrespect to an absent third party not charged with any crime.\u201d Because it makes no sense\nto contend that it violates the Constitution for a state court to apply an evidentiary rule\nin a certain way but that a federal court can, I cannot dissent from the majority\u2019s\nopinion.2 Thus, I must concur, but I do not like the result we reach.\n\n\n\n\n         1\n            The majority discusses the fact that this case involves a state court applying state evidentiary\nrules. It is true that Michigan has never adopted the Federal Rules of Evidence per se, but as the Michigan\nRules of Evidence advisory notes state, \u201cMRE 404(b) is identical with Rule 404b of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence except that the word \u2018plan\u2019 is replaced by the phrase \u2018scheme, plan, or system in doing an act,\u2019\nand there is added the phrase \u2018when the same is material, whether such other crime, wrongs, or acts are\ncontemporaneous with, or prior or subsequent to the crime charged.\u2019\u201d MICH. R. EVID. 404, 1978 advisory\ncommittee\u2019s note.\n         2\n        The current case, while similar to Lucas in many respects, also differs in several substantive\nways. Thus, I believe that, had this case been brought under federal law, it is easily distinguished from\nLucas.\n\fNos. 03-2319; 09-1148                  Wynne v. Renico                                             Page 9\n\n\n         However, I write separately because I believe that the Lucas opinion was\nwrongly decided. As was pointed out in the concurrence to the Lucas opinion, there is\na split among the circuits regarding the appropriate standard to apply to reverse 404(b)\nadmitted evidence. Lucas, 357 F.3d at 612. The majority of circuits have rightly held\nthat Rule 404(b) primarily exists to protect a criminal defendant from the prejudice of\npropensity taint and should not be applied in cases where, as here, the defendant offers\nprior-act evidence of a third-party to prove some fact relevant to his defense.3 Only two\nother circuits have taken the approach of the Lucas majority, holding that the plain\nlanguage of the rule, \u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to\nprove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith\u201d, FED.\nR. EVID. 404(b) (emphasis added), protects every person, not just the criminal defendant\nor a victim.\n\n         Rule 404(b) was born of the common law in an effort to protect parties from\nwrongful inferences derived from character evidence.                           The \u201creason for the\ninadmissibility of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is that such evidence is\nirrelevant to prove the conduct in question.\u201d 22 Charles Alan Wright & Kenneth W.\nGraham, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 5239 (1st ed. 1978) (noting that it \u201chas long\nbeen accepted in our law . . . [t]hat the doing of one act is in itself no evidence that the\nsame or a like act was again done by the same person.\u201d Charles Wigmore, Wigmore\u2019s\nCode of the Rules of Evidence in Trials at Law \u00a7 192, p. 642 (3d ed. 1940) (emphasis\n\n         3\n            The First, Second, Third, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuits have determined that Federal Rule of\nEvidence 404(b) is not applicable to evidence regarding acts of someone other than the defendant. See\nUnited States v. Morano, 697 F.2d 923, 926 (11th Cir. 1983) (holding that \u201cRule 404(b) does not\nspecifically apply to exclude . . . evidence [that] involves an extraneous offense committed by someone\nother than the defendant [because] the evidence was not introduced to show that the defendant has a\ncriminal disposition . . . so the policies underlying Rule 404(b) are inapplicable.\u201d); United States v.\nGonzalez-Sanchez, 825 F.2d 572, 583 (1st Cir. 1987) (holding that \u201cRule 404(b) does not exclude\nevidence of prior crimes of persons other than the defendant.\u201d); United States v. Sepulveda, 710 F.2d 188,\n189 (5th Cir. 1983) (holding that Rule 404(b) only applies to acts by the defendant individually.); United\nStates v. Stevens, 935 F.2d 1380, 1401-06 (3d Cir. 1991) (allowing a defendant to introduce \u201cother crimes\u201d\nevidence against a third-party under Rule 404(b) because \u201cprejudice to the defendant is no longer a\nfactor.\u201d); United States v. Blum, 62 F.3d 63, 68 (2d Cir. 1995) (stating that Rule 404(b) permits \u201cadmission\nagainst third parties of evidence of \u2018crimes, wrongs or acts\u2019 if used to show \u2018motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knowledge, identity of absence of mistake or accident.\u201d) (quoting United States v.\nAboumoussallem, 726 F.2d 906, 911-12 (2d. Cir. 1984)); but see Agushi v. Duerr, 196 F.3d 754, 760 (7th\nCir. 1999) (holding that Rule 404(b) \u201cdoes apply to third parties.\u201d); United States v. McCourt, 925 F.2d\n1229, 1232 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that, \u201cbecause Rule 404(b) plainly proscribes other crimes evidence\nof a person, it cannot reasonably be construed as extending only to the accused.\u201d) (internal citations and\nquotations omitted).\n\fNos. 03-2319; 09-1148             Wynne v. Renico                                    Page 10\n\n\nadded). Although this logic could theoretically apply equally to defendants, victims, or\nthird parties, Wigmore points out that the common law rule barring prior bad act\nevidence existed to prevent the inference that a \u201cdefendant in a criminal case\u201d\nperpetrated the \u201ccriminal act charged.\u201d Charles Wigmore, Wigmore\u2019s Code of the Rules\nof Evidence in Trials at Law \u00a7\u00a7 355- 56, p. 81. (3d ed. 1942); See also United States v.\nDudek, 560 F.2d 1288, 1295-96 (6th Cir. 1977) (stating that Rule 404(b) restates the\ncommon law). Furthermore, history makes clear that the policy underlying the rule at\ncommon law sought to protect the criminal defendant. See Wright & Graham, Federal\nPractice and Procedure: Evidence \u00a7 5239, pp. 436-39 (1978). Moreover, although the\n404(b) Advisory Committee Notes do not clarify the meaning of \u201ca person\u201d, they\ngenerally discuss prosecutorial use of propensity evidence against a defendant and the\nuse of propensity evidence to show that a victim \u201chad it coming.\u201d The notes give no\nindication that they were intended to protect any other party.\n\n        We have summarized the policy concerns driving Rule 404(b), noting that \u201ctwo\nconcerns are expressed by the first sentence of Rule 404(b): (1) that the jury may\nconvict a \u2018bad man\u2019 . . . and (2) that the jury will infer that because the accused\ncommitted other crimes, he probably committed the crime charged.\u201d United States v.\nPhillips, 599 F.2d 134, 136 (6th Cir. 1979) (emphasis added). In short, 404(b) deals with\n(a) concerns that a jury will make prejudicial inferences based upon someone being a\n\u201cbad guy\u201d and thus convict a defendant and (b) logically dubious inferences based upon\nan imagined connection between past acts and current ones.\n\n        Generally, the concern with dubious inferences applies to defendants and to third\nparties, as it is equally irrational to assume that, because either a defendant or third party\ncommitted a past bad act, he is somehow connected to a particular current bad act. Here,\nthis concern seems equally applicable to both Wynne and Peckham.\n\n        However, the prejudice concern does not apply equally to a defendant and a third\nparty not being tried for a crime. Specifically, a third party not on trial for a crime is in\nno danger whatsoever that the jury will convict him for being a \u201cbad man.\u201d Thus, here\nand in probably most reverse evidence cases, one of 404(b)\u2019s two justifications would\n\fNos. 03-2319; 09-1148                  Wynne v. Renico                                            Page 11\n\n\nvanish completely. In such a situation, one wonders if, left with only one pillar to\nsupport it, the whole structure of 404(b) collapses under the weight of a defendant\u2019s\nconstitutional right to present a defense.4 Most circuits have found that it does. See\nsupra n. 3. Given the great weight that our Constitution and society place on the right\nto present a defense, if the policy reasons driving 404(b) are considerably weakened\u2014as\nthey are in cases of reverse 404(b) evidence\u2014in the majority of circumstances, the\nconstitutional right to present a defense easily trumps the sole remaining 404(b) interest.\nThis Court is clearly on the losing side of the equation. It is my hope that this Court and\nother courts will see the wisdom of distinguishing close cases involving important Sixth\nAmendment questions from Lucas and will admit 404(b) evidence under a simple\nrelevancy-balancing test, thus erring on the side of allowing defendants to present their\nbest defense.\n\n         Had this Court correctly decided the reverse 404(b) evidence question in Lucas,\nthen we could have reached the question of whether the state court ran afoul of Wynne\u2019s\nconstitutional rights in applying its evidentiary rules to exclude some of his proffered\nevidence. Were I hearing this case on direct appeal, I would have no difficulty\u2014given\nthe state\u2019s greatly diminished evidentiary interest\u2014 in finding that the state court erred\nin not permitting Wynne to present some or all of the excluded evidence in crafting his\ndefense. I recognize, however, that AEDPA requires a more exacting level of deference.\n\n\n         4\n           The absence of prejudice in the context of reverse 404(b) evidence has been emphasized by other\ncircuits. The Second Circuit has noted that:\n         [W]e believe that the standard of admissibility when a criminal defendant offers similar\n         acts evidence as a shield need not be as restrictive as when the prosecutor uses such\n         evidence as a sword . . . . [R]isks of prejudice are normally absent when the defendant\n         offers similar acts evidence of a third-party to prove some fact pertinent in the defense.\n         In such cases the only issue arising under 404(b) is whether the evidence is relevant to\n         the existence or non-existence of some fact pertinent to the defense.\nAboumoussallem, 726 F.2d at 911-12 (internal citations omitted). The Third Circuit makes similar\nobservations:\n         [W]hen the defendant is offering [other crimes testimony], prejudice to the defendant\n         is no longer a factor, and simple relevance to guilt or innocence should suffice as the\n         standard of admissibility, since ordinarily, and subject to rules of competency, an\n         accused in entitled to advance in his defense any evidence which may rationally tend\n         to refute his guilt or buttress his innocence of the charge made.\nStevens, 935 F.2d at 1401 (citation omitted).\n\fNos. 03-2319; 09-1148                  Wynne v. Renico                                          Page 12\n\n\nRegardless, I believe that the same interest that would require admission of this evidence\nin a direct appeal case applies equally to Wynne\u2019s habeas attack. The fact that, as a third\nparty, there is no risk that Peckham would be unfairly convicted for being a \u201cbad person\u201d\ndrastically reduces the need to exclude the questionable evidence, while Wynne\u2019s need\nto present a defense remains just as weighty.5 Thus, sitting in habeas, but for Lucas, I\nwould find that the evidence was excluded in violation of Wynne\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\n         However, as this panel is bound by the decisions of a prior panel, no matter how\nillogical,6 I must concur.\n\n\n\n\n         5\n          It is true that Wynne was permitted to present some evidence regarding Peckham\u2019s alleged\nscheme to murder. However, given that some of the excluded evidence would have helped Wynne show\nthat Peckham had (1) suffered a mental breakdown, (2) declined psychologically since that time,\n(3) allegedly attempted to frame someone else for a crime he had committed in the past, and (4) other\nevidence tending to substantiate Wynne\u2019s defense, its probative value was likely substantial.\n         6\n           A published prior panel decision \u201cremains controlling authority unless an inconsistent decision\nof the United States Supreme Court requires modification of the decision or this Court sitting en banc\noverrules the prior decision.\u201d Rutherford v. Columbia Gas, 575 F.3d 616, 619 (6th Cir. 2009) (citing Salmi\nv. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 774 F.2d 685, 689 (6th Cir. 1985)).\n\f",
