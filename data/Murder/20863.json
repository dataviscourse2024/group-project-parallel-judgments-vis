Long   is   serving   a   life   sentence   at   the   Iowa   State\nPenitentiary (ISP) for the brutal murder of a woman.            See Long v. Brewer,\n253 N.W.2d 549, 551 (Iowa 1977).          He filed this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1994)\nlawsuit against officials of the Iowa Department of Corrections seeking,\namong other things, treatment for a gender-identity disorder and damages\nfor the defendants' alleged deliberate indifference to his gender-identity\ndisorder.   Based on the evidence introduced during a one-day bench trial,\nthe District\n\fCourt1 held that (1) the extent of Long's gender-identity disorder does not\nconstitute a serious medical need, (2) even if Long has a serious medical\nneed, the defendants were not deliberately indifferent to that need, and\n(3) the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from Long's claim\nfor damages.   Long v. Nix, 877 F. Supp. 1358, 1365-67 (S.D. Iowa 1995).\nLong timely appeals from the judgment of the District Court, and we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                      I.\n\n\n     Long began his stay at ISP in 1964.       He arrived in full drag, but\ninitially prison officials refused to let him wear women's clothes.\nFollowing a hunger strike that began shortly after his arrival, Long was\nallowed to wear women's clothes and make-up on a regular basis.          This\nprivilege, however, was revoked in 1981 after a member of the Iowa Parole\nBoard complained to prison officials about Long's attire.   Since 1981 Long\nrepeatedly has sought permission to wear women's clothing and make-up.    ISP\nofficials have denied his request each time.   He also has requested hormone\ntherapy and sex-change surgery.    Aside from these requests, however, Long\nhas not sought, nor have prison health services employees ordered, any\ntreatment for a gender-identity disorder.      In fact, Long has repeatedly\nrefused to cooperate with prison psychologists and psychiatrists over the\npast twenty years.   See Long, 877 F. Supp. at 1362; see also Program Review\nCommittee Pre-Parole Evaluation (Feb. 3, 1978); Psychiatric Consultation\n(Apr. 24, 1981); Psychiatric Evaluation (Feb. 15, 1986).\n\n\n     As the District Court found, Long's 1990 evaluation was unproductive\nbecause Long presented himself in a \"hostile and belligerent,\" \"verbally\nabusive and abrasive manner.\"     Long, 877\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable Celeste F. Bremer, United States Magistrate\nJudge for the Southern District of Iowa. The case was tried before\nMagistrate Judge Bremer by consent of the parties pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (1994).\n\n                                     -2-\n\fF. Supp. at 1362.          During his 1991 psychological evaluation, all Long\nrequested was \"what he deserves\":            a transfer from ISP to a less structured\nsetting.       Id.    The psychologist concluded that \"[a]t this point in time\nthere    are    no    psychological     or    psychiatric    issues    that   need   to   be\naddressed.\"          Psychological Evaluation (Jan. 30, 1991).              In 1992, Long\n\"indicated no mental health issues or problems,\" and the psychologist\nconcluded that there were no psychological issues that needed to be\naddressed.       Psychological Evaluation (Jan. 29, 1992).                  In 1993, Long\nrefused to participate in a psychological interview and \"no meaningful\npsychological report\" was submitted.                Long, 877 F. Supp. at 1362.           In\ncontrast to Long's behavior, the record shows that prison officials have\nbeen responsive to Long's requests for treatment when they were reasonable.\nIn 1982, for example, Long requested \"treatment and evaluation\" at the Iowa\nState Medical Facility (ISMF).          ISMF Referral (Feb. 12, 1982).         His request\nwas granted, and he was transferred to ISMF.                Later that same year he was\ntransferred at his own request to a Missouri maximum security prison where\nhe was allowed to wear women's clothing at all times.                 In 1986 he returned\nto ISP.     His complaints to a member of the medical staff at that time\n\"center[ed] around the fact that he will not be allowed to have the\nnumerous       articles   of   female    clothing    which    he   owns.\"     Psychiatric\nEvaluation (Feb. 15, 1986).           Long, however, never has shown a continued\ninterest in psychiatric evaluation or treatment either for depression or\nhis gender-identity disorder.                \"In 1994, Long [again] declined to be\ninterviewed for his annual psychological evaluation.                  Long explained that\nhe is apprehensive about meeting with ISP staff members because they are\nunsympathetic and because he thinks it is unlikely that he will be\nparoled.\"       Long, 877 F. Supp. at 1362.\n\n\n        At trial, Dr. Walter O. Bockting, Ph.D., testified that Long has\ndeveloped an intense gender dysphoria.                 His report diagnosed Long as\nsuffering from a gender-identity disorder not otherwise specified, a sexual\ndisorder not otherwise specified, and an\n\n\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\fantisocial-personality disorder.       Dr. Bockting concluded that Long has\nother emotional problems in addition to his gender-identity disorder,\nstating that tests indicated that Long \"may be demanding, rebellious,\nhostile,    aggressive,    antisocial,      impulsive,     exhibitionistic,      and\npromiscuous.\"    Id.   Dr. Bockting suggested that these traits result from\nthe dysfunctional family setting in which Long was raised.            Id.\n\n\n      Several of the psychologists and psychiatrists that had worked with\nLong at ISP also testified at trial.     The state's principal expert witness\nwas Dr. Paul W. Loeffelholz, M.D.     For the most part, Dr. Loeffelholz did\nnot disagree with Dr. Bockting's diagnoses.        As the District Court noted,\nhowever, the diagnoses were in conflict on some points.            See id. at 1365-\n66.   The main disagreement between the experts was whether Long's gender-\nidentity disorder is his predominate psychiatric condition.            Dr. Bockting\nstated that Long's primary psychiatric condition is his gender-identity\ndisorder.   Dr. Loeffelholz testified that Long's gender-identity disorder\nis intermittent and generally exhibited when Long is under stress, while\nhis   \"primary    psychological   problem    is   his    serious    antisocial   and\nmanipulative behavior.\"      Id. at 1363.         At bottom, the difference in\ndiagnoses turns on whether Long primarily wants to wear women's clothing\nto achieve sexual arousal or to satisfy his desire to be a woman.\n\n\n      Despite his opinion that Long's gender-identity disorder is Long's\nprincipal condition, Dr. Bockting admitted that he believes that Long wears\nwomen's clothing both to express his feminine identity and for sexual\nstimulation.     Dr. Bockting concluded that, because Long experiences some\narousal, he suffers in part from paraphilia (a sexual attraction to an\nunusual subject or object) and transvestic fetishism (sexual arousal from\ncross-dressing).    As a result, Dr. Bockting stated that Long \"does not meet\nthe minimal requirements that would make him eligible\" for hormone therapy\nor\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fsex-change surgery.        Id. at 1362.    The experts thus agreed that Long is not\na transsexual.\n\n\n        In contradistinction to their general agreement on the diagnosis, the\nexperts flatly disagreed about the appropriate treatment for Long's\ncondition.       Dr. Bockting recommended psychotherapy for Long's gender-\nidentity disorder combined with tranquilizers for the depression and\nanxiety that has resulted from his inability to wear women's clothes.                  If\nthe tranquilizers prove to be ineffective, Dr. Bockting recommended that\nLong be given limited opportunities to wear women's clothes to relieve his\nanxiety.      Dr. Loeffelholz disagreed and noted that Long has not requested\ntreatment for his anxiety or depression nor has he fully cooperated with\nprison psychologists so that the staff could properly respond to his\nanxiety or depression, let alone his gender-identity disorder.\n\n\n        The   District     Court   found   that   Dr.   Loeffelholz   had    refused   to\nprescribe tranquilizers \"[i]n spite of Dr. Bockting's recommendation.\"                 Id.\nat 1363.       The District Court nonetheless found that Dr. Loeffelholz's\nrefusal was based on a difference in professional judgment.                 Id. at 1363,\n1366.    As a result, the court concluded that \"[Dr.] Loeffelholz did not act\nwith deliberate indifference to Long's allegedly serious medical need\" and\nthat the other defendants \"were justified in relying on the opinions of\nmedical staff.\"      Id.\n\n\n                                            II.\n\n\n        Long argues, among other things, that the District Court erred when\nit held that his gender-identity disorder does not constitute a serious\nmedical need and that the defendants were not\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fdeliberately indifferent to his gender-identity disorder.2       Furthermore,\nLong argues that both the District Court's findings of fact and its\nconclusions of law are subject to de novo review \"in light of the societal\nvalues underlying the relevant legal concepts.\"       Appellant's Brief at 2\n(citing Falls v. Nesbitt, 966 F.2d 375, 377 (8th Cir. 1992)).          We first\naddress the standard of review.\n\n\n                                       A.\n\n\n     In Nesbitt, we stated that \"[m]ixed questions of law and fact that\nrequire the consideration of legal concepts and involve the exercise of\njudgment about the values underlying legal principles are reviewable de\nnovo.\"       Id.   While we believe that the term \"mixed question of law and\nfact\" is confusing and best discarded, Nesbitt cannot be read to permit the\nde novo review of the factual findings of a district court.        First, in\nNesbitt, the \"operative facts\" were \"not in dispute.\"    Id. at 376.    Second,\nwe began our discussion of the standard of review by stating that \"[t]he\ntrial judge's findings of fact will not be set aside unless they are found\nto be `clearly erroneous.'\"       Id. at 377 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)).\nThe language cited by Long thus stands for the unremarkable proposition\nthat a legal conclusion drawn from established facts is subject to de novo\nreview.       Despite Long's invitation, we decline to subject the District\nCourt's findings of fact in this case to de novo review.        As usual, we\nreview the factual findings of the District Court for clear error and its\nlegal conclusions de novo.     See, e.g., Little Rock School Dist. v. Pulaski\nCounty Special School Dist., #1, Nos. 95-1481 & 95-1482, slip op. at 8 (8th\nCir. May 15, 1996); Williams v. Carter, 76 F.3d\n\n\n\n\n         2\n      Because we agree with the District Court's conclusion that\nthe prison officials did not act with deliberate indifference to\nLong's gender-identity disorder, we need not and do not address his\narguments regarding the prison officials' entitlement to qualified\nimmunity.\n\n                                       -6-\n\f199, 200 (8th Cir. 1996) (per curiam); see also Ornelas v. United States,\nNo. 95-5257, 1996 WL 276414 at *6 (U.S. May 28, 1996) (historical facts\nreviewed \"only for clear error\" but legal conclusions such as \"reasonable\nsuspicion\" and \"probable cause\" reviewed de novo).               After reviewing the\ntrial transcript and the documentary evidence, we conclude that the\nrelevant factual findings of the District Court, as outlined above, are not\nclearly erroneous.\n\n\n                                            B.\n\n\n     Turning to the merits of Long's legal arguments, we conclude that he\nfailed       to   prove   that    the   prison    officials   acted   with   deliberate\nindifference.       Deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of a\nprisoner constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nU.S. 97, 102-03 (1976), and the Constitution prohibits state governments\nfrom inflicting such punishments, Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber,\n329 U.S. 459, 463 (1947) (stating that Due Process Clause of Fourteenth\nAmendment incorporates Eighth Amendment's guarantee against cruel and\nunusual punishment).             We assume without deciding that Long's gender-\nidentity disorder constitutes a serious medical need for the purposes of\nthis case.3\n\n\n     \"A prison official exhibits deliberate indifference when the official\nactually `knows of and disregards' a prisoner's serious medical needs.\"\nBoyd v. Knox, 47 F.3d 966, 968 (8th Cir. 1995) (quoting Farmer v. Brennan,\n114 S. Ct. 1970, 1977, 1979 (1994)).\n\n\n\n\n         3\n       A psychological disorder may constitute a serious medical\nneed. White v. Farrier, 849 F.2d 322, 325 (8th Cir. 1988). We\nhave held that transsexualism is a serious medical need, id.,\nthough that holding may be in doubt in light of Farmer v. Brennan,\n114 S. Ct. 1970 (1994), and subsequent cases. It is undisputed in\nthis case, however, that Long is not a transsexual, and thus White\ndoes not control the resolution of whether Long's gender-identity\ndisorder is a serious medical need.\n\n                                            -7-\n\fThus,       the failure to treat a medical condition does not constitute\npunishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment unless prison\nofficials knew that the condition created an excessive risk to the inmate's\nhealth and then failed to act on that knowledge.          Moreover, nothing in the\nEighth Amendment prevents prison doctors from exercising their independent\nmedical judgment.        White v. Farrier, 849 F.2d 322, 327 (8th Cir. 1988).\nPrisoners do not have a constitutional right to any particular type of\ntreatment.       See id. at 327-28.   Prison officials do not violate the Eighth\nAmendment when, in the exercise of their professional judgment, they refuse\nto implement a prisoner's requested course of treatment.                     Kayser v.\nCaspari, 16 F.3d 280, 281 (8th Cir. 1994); Taylor v. Turner, 884 F.2d 1088,\n1090 (8th Cir. 1989).\n\n\n        The record indicates that Dr. Loeffelholz and other members of the\nprison medical staff were aware of Long's psychological problems.                  The\nrecord, however, does not show any deliberate indifference on the part of\nthe   prison      officials.     Long's   expert   in   this   case,   Dr.   Bockting,\nrecommended an initial course of treatment that consisted of psychotherapy\nand tranquilizers.      Dr. Loeffelholz did not reject psychotherapy, only the\nuse of tranquilizers.          In fact, the record is full of evidence of the\nattempts of the prison medical staff to evaluate Long's psychological\nproblems and Long's refusal to cooperate.          In these circumstances, Long has\nfailed to prove that Dr. Loeffelholz4 was deliberately indifferent to\nLong's gender-identity disorder, the only serious medical need alleged in\nthis case.5\n\n\n        4\n      We also agree with the District Court's conclusion, Long, 877\nF. Supp. at 1366, that the other defendants were entitled to rely\non the opinions of the medical staff when refusing Long's requests\nto cross-dress. See Heidemann v. Rother, Nos. 94-4112 & 95-1136,\nslip op. at 11-12 (8th Cir. May 23, 1996).\n             5\n        In his Reply Brief, Long alleges that his anxiety and\ndepression constitute independent serious medical needs and that\ncross-dressing is the appropriate treatment for these conditions.\nReply Brief at 7. This argument is not properly before us, having\nbeen raised for the first time in Long's Reply Brief. See United\nStates v. Darden, 70 F.3d 1507, 1549 n.18 (8th Cir. 1995), cert.\ndenied, 116 S. Ct. 1449 (1996). The only serious psychological\nneed referred to in Long's amended complaint, and the alleged\n\n                                          -8-\n\f     To the extent that Long's claim is based on the prison officials'\nfailure to provide tranquilizers, it fails because it is merely a dispute\nover the course of treatment.    The prison officials' decision not to treat\nLong with tranquilizers is \"a classic example of a matter for medical\njudgment\" that does not rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment.\nSee Gamble, 429 U.S. at 107.     To the extent that Long's claim is based on\nthe prison officials' failure to provide psychotherapy, it fails because\nLong consistently has refused psychological help.         It is perhaps possible\nthat Long would benefit from some form of therapy.           Long, however, has\nresisted the attempts of Iowa prison officials to provide psychological\nevaluation, treatment, and therapy over the past twenty years.           Even Dr.\nBockting   noted    that   \"Long's   profile   may   be   `highly   resistant   to\npsychological treatment.'\"     Long, 877 F. Supp. at 1362.      We reject Long's\ncontention that the Eighth Amendment requires the Iowa Department of\nCorrections to provide Long with a \"sensitive\" psychotherapist trained in\ngender-identity issues.      Appellant's Brief at 14, 15.      The record shows\nthat the ISP medical staff is competent to diagnose inmates' medical\nproblems and to order treatment or further evaluation by other medical\nprofessionals.6\n\n\n     The District Court correctly stated that \"[i]n essence, Long demands\nthe privilege of cross dressing so that he can exist in the prison on his\nown terms, rather than in conformity with prison regulations.\"         Long, 877\nF. Supp. at 1366.    Having no apparent\n\n\n\n\nserious medical need on which the case was tried, is his gender-\nidentity disorder.\n     6\n     ISP employs three full-time psychologists. The psychologists\nmay refer a prisoner to the prison system's 46-bed licensed\npsychiatric hospital or to outside facilities and specialists for\nfurther evaluation and treatment.\n\n                                       -9-\n\finterest in overcoming his gender-identity disorder, Long has frustrated\nthe attempts of prison doctors to treat that disorder by his consistent\nrefusal of psychological evaluation over the past twenty years.   In these\ncircumstances, the District Court unquestionably was correct when it held\nthat Long failed to prove that the defendant prison officials have been\ndeliberately indifferent to his gender-identity disorder.\n\n\n                                  III.\n\n\n     For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n     A true copy.\n\n\n            Attest:\n\n\n                 CLERK, U. S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f",
