For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n               Following his guilty plea to possession of a firearm\n\nand ammunition by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1)         &    924    (2006),       Harris         was    sentenced             in   2006   to\n\nforty-six      months\u2019       imprisonment           followed         by    a    thirty-six-month\n\nterm     of    supervised          release.               Harris         began        his       term   of\n\nsupervision on September 21, 2009.\n\n               On March 10, 2011, a probation officer petitioned the\n\ndistrict       court      for    revocation          of      Harris\u2019      term        of    supervised\n\nrelease.        The probation officer explained that Harris had, in\n\nviolation of the terms of his supervised release, engaged in\n\ncriminal        conduct          and     possessed            a      controlled             substance.\n\nSpecifically,          Harris     had        been    arrested        in    North        Carolina       on\n\ncharges of Possession With Intent to Sell and Deliver Marijuana,\n\nPossession of Stolen Goods/Property, and Driving While Impaired.\n\n               Harris pled no contest to the conduct charged in the\n\npetition for revocation of supervised release because the state\n\ncharges       were       still    pending.              He    presented          no    evidence        in\n\nresponse to the evidence introduced by the Government regarding\n\n                                                    2\n\fthe violations.           The court found that the violations had been\n\nestablished and that Harris\u2019 policy statement range under the\n\nSentencing Guidelines was twenty-four months.\n\n             Afterwards, defense counsel submitted a letter from a\n\nMcDonald\u2019s       restaurant    stating         that       Harris   was     a   \u201ccritical\n\nworker,\u201d and noted that Harris worked for McDonald\u2019s \u201cpretty\n\nregularly\u201d after being placed on supervised release.                             Harris\n\nasked the court for mercy.               The court questioned the parties\n\nabout     Harris\u2019   income,    the   status          of    the   state    charges,   the\n\ncircumstances under which drugs were found in Harris\u2019 vehicle,\n\nand his prior murder conviction.                 Without further elaboration,\n\nthe     court    then     imposed    a   twenty-four-month               sentence,   the\n\nstatutory       maximum    penalty   and       the    advisory     policy      statement\n\nterm. 1\n\n             Because Harris did not request a sentence outside the\n\npolicy statement range, we review his challenge to the adequacy\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       Harris\u2019 Grade A supervised release violation and placement\nin Criminal History Category V yielded an advisory policy\nstatement range of thirty to thirty-seven months under U.S.\nSentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 7B1.4(a)(1), p.s. (2005), but\nbecause the statutory maximum sentence for Harris\u2019 violation was\ntwenty-four months, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2006), his\nadvisory policy statement term became twenty-four months.    USSG\n\u00a7 7B1.4(b)(1) (stating where statutory maximum lower than bottom\nof policy statement range, statutory maximum becomes policy\nstatement range).\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fof the explanation for his sentence for plain error. 2                         Lynn, 592\n\nF.3d at 580 (finding error not preserved where defendant failed\n\nto seek sentence outside Guidelines range).                   \u201cTo establish plain\n\nerror, [Harris] must show that an error occurred, that the error\n\nwas plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Muhammad, 478 F.3d 247, 249 (4th Cir. 2007).\n\nEven if Harris satisfies these requirements, \u201ccorrection of the\n\nerror    remains       within   our    discretion,         which   we        should   not\n\nexercise    .     .    .    unless    the   error    seriously      affect[s]         the\n\nfairness,        integrity      or     public       reputation          of      judicial\n\nproceedings.\u201d         Id. (alteration in original) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).\n\n            In        the    sentencing         context,     an    error         affects\n\nsubstantial rights if the defendant can show that the sentence\n\nimposed \u201cwas longer than that to which he would otherwise be\n\nsubject.\u201d       United States v. Washington, 404 F.3d 834, 849 (4th\n\nCir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see\n\n     2\n        Harris contends that he preserved the issue of the\nadequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation for his sentence\nbecause he asked the court for mercy at the revocation hearing\nand counsel noted his positive work record.          A defendant\npreserves a claim of sentencing error when he \u201cdraw[s] arguments\nfrom [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553 [2006] for a sentence different than the\none ultimately imposed.\u201d   United States v. Lynn, 592 F.3d 572,\n578-79 (4th Cir. 2010). We find Harris\u2019 bald request for mercy\nand counsel\u2019s remarks were not sufficient to preserve for\nappellate   review  the   adequacy  of   the   district  court\u2019s\nexplanation of the sentence.\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\falso United States v. Miller, 557 F.3d 910, 916 (8th Cir. 2009)\n\n(\u201cIn the sentencing context, an error was prejudicial only if\n\nthere is a reasonable probability that the defendant would have\n\nreceived a lighter sentence but for the error.\u201d). We conclude\n\nHarris cannot meet this rigorous standard on this record.\n\n            Assuming        arguendo        that     the      district          court\u2019s\n\nexplanation was inadequate, Harris fails to argue, and nothing\n\nin the record indicates, that the court would have imposed a\n\nlighter sentence had it provided a more thorough explanation.\n\nAccordingly,    we    conclude      Harris\u2019    challenge      to   his     revocation\n\nsentence    cannot     withstand     plain     error    review,      as    he   cannot\n\nestablish   that     any    error   by   the   district      court    affected     his\n\nsubstantial rights.           We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s\n\njudgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and\n\nlegal    contentions       are   adequately    presented      in     the    materials\n\nbefore   the   court    and      argument    would     not   aid   the     decisional\n\nprocess.\n\n                                                                             AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f",
