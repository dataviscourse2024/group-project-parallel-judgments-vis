We affirm.Background\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the early morning hours of September 1, 2001, Frank Ibanez,\r\ncomplainant, drove his blue Impala into the parking lot of the Chili\u2019s Restaurant\r\nlocated at Westheimer and Greenridge in Houston.  Complainant was accompanied\r\nby two friends, Ulises Martinez, and Joe Antonio Garcia.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As complainant was about to leave, two armed men ran up to his car.  One of\r\nthe men, later identified as Sostenes Salinas, a/k/a \u201cTooter,\u201d pointed an assault rifle\r\nat complainant while he was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat.  The other man, later\r\nidentified as Fabian Rene Garcia, appellant, pointed a pistol at Joe Garcia who was\r\nsitting in the passenger side.  The gunmen shouted obscenities and ordered all the\r\npassengers to get out of the car and to get on the ground.  Martinez and Joe Garcia\r\ncomplied, but the complainant told the gunman, \u201cIf you are going to shoot me, shoot\r\nme.\u201d  Several shots were fired, and complainant was found dead in the parking lot. \r\nAlthough there were other persons standing in the parking lot who saw the robbery,\r\nnone of these eyewitnesses was able to identify the two gunmen.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The complainant\u2019s car was later found cut-up and stripped on Arnulfo\r\nLegoretta\u2019s property located in San Jacinto County.  Evidence presented at trial\r\nshowed that Legoretta\u2019s son was in Tooter\u2019s car when Tooter decided to rob\r\ncomplainant.\r\nMotion in Limine\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his first point of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in\r\ngranting the State\u2019s motion in limine regarding an \u201cindependent impulse\u201d defense. \r\nThe defense of independent impulse \u201cembrace[s] the theory that an accused, though\r\nhe was admittedly intent on some wrongful conduct, nevertheless did not contemplate\r\nthe extent of criminal conduct actually engaged in by his fellows, and thus cannot be\r\nheld vicariously responsible for their conduct.\u201d  Mayfield v. State, 716, S.W.2d 509,\r\n513 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986) overruled in part,  Solomon v. State, 49 S.W.3d 356, 368\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2001).  The motion required appellant\u2019s counsel to approach the\r\nbench and inform the court and the State that he intended to mention or refer to the\r\ndefense of independent impulse in front of the jury during voir dire or the\r\nguilt/innocence stage of trial.  Appellant concedes that he did not have a right to have\r\nthe defense submitted to the jury in the charge as an affirmative defense.  However,\r\nhe contends that he did have a right to voir dire on that theory of defense and had a\r\nright to argue the substance of that defense to the jury.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A ruling granting a motion in limine does not preserve error on appeal. \r\nWilkerson v. State, 881 S.W.2d 321, 326 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994).  A ruling on a\r\nmotion in limine that excludes evidence \u201cis subject to reconsideration throughout\r\ntrial\u201d and in order \u201cto preserve error an offer of the evidence must be made at trial.\u201d \r\nWarner v. State, 969 S.W.2d 1, 2 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998).  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During voir dire, appellant made no attempt to explain the independent impulse\r\ndefense to the venirepersons and made no attempt to question the venirepersons about\r\nit.  He failed to ask the trial court to reconsider the issue.  Accordingly, he has not\r\npreserved error for our review.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Likewise, during the guilt-innocence stage of trial, appellant neither made an \r\nattempt to explain the independent impulse defense to the jury nor did he ask in any\r\nway for the trial court to reconsider the issue. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Appellant did not offer any evidence that would establish the defense and, in\r\nfact, his testimony negated it.  Appellant testified that he did not plan or intend to rob\r\nanybody and that he was surprised when Tooter jumped out of the car.  He testified\r\nthat he was trying to stop Tooter, and that he repetitively told Tooter and the\r\nwitnesses \u201cto chill out.\u201d  Appellant presented no evidence that he agreed or conspired\r\nto commit the underlying robbery or that he intended to promote or assist in the\r\ncommission of the underlying robbery.  Therefore, the evidence he presented did not\r\nraise the independent impulse defense.  If a party fails to offer the evidence, error is\r\nnot preserved and the complaint is waived.  Taylor v. State, 939 S.W.2d 148, 155\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1996).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We overrule appellant\u2019s first point of error.\r\nMotion to Suppress\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his second point of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in\r\ndenying his motion to suppress his videotaped statement.  He argues that the\r\nstatement should be suppressed because it was made while he was in custody and the\r\nofficers did not give him Miranda warnings.  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86\r\nS. Ct. 1602 (1966). \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress using a bifurcated\r\nstandard of review.  Carmouche v. State, 10 S.W.3d 323, 327 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\r\nFirst, we give almost total deference to a trial judge\u2019s determination of historical facts\r\nand application of the law to fact questions that turn on credibility and demeanor of\r\nthe witnesses.  Id.; Martinez v. State, 29 S.W.3d 609, 611 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st\r\nDist.] 2000, pet. ref\u2019d).  Second, we review de novo application of the law to fact\r\nquestions that do not turn upon credibility and demeanor.  Carmouche, 10 S.W.3d at\r\n327. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.  In its findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law, the trial court concluded as follows: (1) appellant was not in\r\ncustody at the time his videotaped statement, State\u2019s Exhibit 121, was made; (2) the\r\nstatement was not the product of promises or coercion; (3) the statement was\r\nadmissible as it was not the product of custodial interrogation; and (4) the statement\r\nwas freely, knowingly, and voluntarily given.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article 38.22 section (3)(a) provides that, \u201cno oral or sign language statement\r\nof an accused made as a result of custodial interrogation shall be admissible against\r\nthe accused in a criminal proceeding\u201d unless certain exceptions are met.  Tex. Code\r\nCrim. P. Ann. art. 38.22 \u00a7 3(a) (Vernon 2002).  Article 38.22 section 5 provides that\r\nnothing in this article precludes the admission of a statement that does not stem from\r\ncustodial interrogation.  Tex. Code Crim. P. Ann. art. 38.22 \u00a7 5 (Vernon 2002).  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cA person is in \u2018custody\u2019 only if, under the circumstances, a reasonable person\r\nwould believe that his freedom of movement was restrained to the degree associated\r\nwith a formal arrest.\u201d  Dowhitt v. State, 931 S.W.2d 244, 254 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996);\r\nChiles v. State, 988 S.W.2d 411, 413 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 1999 pet.\r\nref\u2019d).  \u201cThe reasonable person standard presupposes an innocent person.\u201d  Dowhitt,\r\n931 S.W.2d at 254.  In Dowhitt, the Court of Criminal Appeals inferred custody when\r\nthe circumstances consisted of (1) a very long time period during which interrogation\r\noccurred, (2) the exercise of police control over the defendant, and (3) the\r\nmanifestation of probable cause after the defendant admitted to being present at the\r\nscene of the crime.  913 S.W.2d at 257.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Officer Henry Chisolm was the only witness who testified at the suppression\r\nhearing.  Chisolm testified that Legoretta told him that appellant was involved in the\r\nrobbery and murder.  He also testified that he was there when Sergeant Ferguson\r\ncalled appellant\u2019s girlfriend and told her that the police wanted to speak with\r\nappellant.  Appellant and his girlfriend voluntarily went to the Houston Police\r\nDepartment and waited in the visitor\u2019s room to speak with Chisolm.  Chisolm told\r\nappellant that they would like to videotape his statement.  Chisolm also told him that\r\nhe was free to leave, that he was there voluntarily, and that he could talk about the\r\nincident if he wanted to.  After Chisolm briefly told appellant the information the\r\npolice had, appellant told him that he wanted to tell his side of the story.  Chisolm\r\ntestified that appellant was very willing to talk to him.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There were only two officers in the room when appellant gave his statement. \r\nNeither officer was armed.  The police did not advise appellant of his rights under\r\nMiranda.  There was no evidence that the officers coerced or forced appellant to\r\nmake a statement.  The videotaped statement was approximately 30 minutes long. \r\nAfter appellant completed his statement, he was escorted back to the visitor\u2019s room\r\nwhere he was left unguarded with his girlfriend.  Chisolm testified that there was\r\nnothing to prevent appellant from getting up and walking out of the police\r\ndepartment.  Appellant was still not under arrest.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Within the hour, Chisolm contacted the assistant district attorney and told him\r\nabout appellant\u2019s statement, and charges against appellant were filed.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s\r\nmotion to suppress.  A reasonable person in appellant\u2019s position would not have\r\nbelieved he was restrained to the degree associated with a formal arrest.  Accordingly,\r\nwe overrule appellant\u2019s second point of error.  \r\nEffective Assistance\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his third point of error, appellant argues that he was denied effective\r\nassistance of counsel.  The standard of review for evaluating claims of ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel is set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104\r\nS. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984).  See also Gamble v. State, 916 S.W.2d 92, 93 (Tex.\r\nApp.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no pet.).  Appellant must show both that (1)\r\ncounsel\u2019s performance was so deficient that he was not functioning as acceptable\r\ncounsel under the Sixth Amendment, and (2) but for counsel\u2019s error, the result of the\r\nproceedings would have been different.  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at\r\n2064; Gamble, 916 S.W.2d at 93.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is the defendant\u2019s burden to prove ineffective assistance of counsel. \r\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064; Gamble, 916 S.W.2d at 93.  A\r\ndefendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the\r\nchallenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.  Strickland, 466 U.S. at\r\n689, 104 S. Ct. at 2064; Gamble, 916 S.W.2d at 93.  A claim of ineffective assistance\r\nof counsel must be firmly supported by the record.  McFarland v. State, 928 S.W.2d\r\n482, 500 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).  We will not speculate to find trial counsel\r\nineffective when the record is silent.  Alvarez v. State, 79 S.W.3d 679, 681 (Tex.\r\nApp.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, no pet.).  When a convicted criminal asserts that his\r\ncounsel was ineffective, only in rare cases will the record on direct appeal be\r\nsufficient for an appellant court to fairly evaluate the claim.  Robinson v. State, 16\r\nS.W.3d 808, 812 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Appellant contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because\r\nhis trial counsel did not understand the holding in Solomon v. State, 49 S.W.3d 356\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2001). In response to the State\u2019s motion in limine, appellant\u2019s trial\r\ncounsel argued that Solomon should not be followed because \u201cthat case could be\r\nreversed next week, and we never really know how any type of particular appellate\r\nissue is going to be resolved in the future.\u201d  Appellant contends that the independent\r\nimpulse defense was his only defense; therefore, his trial counsel was deficient by\r\nfailing to argue and present evidence to establish it.  We disagree.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The independent impulse defense was not appellant\u2019s only defense.  Trial\r\ncounsel argued and presented evidence that appellant did not promote, encourage, or \r\nagree to aid Tooter in the robbery.  There was also evidence that appellant was an\r\ninnocent witness who was trying to thwart the entire encounter.  The trial counsel was\r\nnot deficient simply because appellant\u2019s trial counsel chose a defense strategy other\r\nthan independent impulse.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Appellant also contends that trial counsel failed to object to (1) the State\u2019s voir\r\ndire explanation of section 7.02(b) of the Penal Code and (2) the State\u2019s misstatement\r\nabout whether a witness had identified the appellant.  During voir dire, the State\r\nexplained that section 7.02(b) requires that a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s\r\nposition foresee that the murder might happen.  Appellant argues that this statement\r\nled the jury into believing that it did not have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that\r\nappellant anticipated the murder would result.  During the State\u2019s examination of\r\nRuth Perez, a witness who could not identify appellant, the State asked, \u201cAnd we\r\ntalked about Mr. Garcia yelling stuff like get on the floor, basically telling them to get\r\non the ground.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Appellant did not allege that his counsel was ineffective in his motion for new\r\ntrial.  As a result, there is no evidence in the record as to why appellant\u2019s trial counsel\r\ndid not object to the statements.  Isolated failures to object to improper evidence or\r\ncertain procedural mistakes do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. \r\nIngraham v. State, 679 S.W.2d 503, 509 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984).  To find trial\r\ncounsel ineffective would call for speculation, which we will not do.  See Jackson v.\r\nState, 877 S.W.2d 768, 771 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999); Gamble, 916 S.W.2d at 93; see\r\nalso Henderson v. State, 29 S.W.3d 616, 624 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2000,\r\npet. ref\u2019d) (holding trial counsel not ineffective when record silent as to trial\r\ncounsel\u2019s reasons for declining to request instruction on concurrent causation). \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We overrule all of appellant\u2019s points of error.\r\n\u00a0\r\nConclusion\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adele Hedges\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice\r\nPanel consists of Justices Hedges, Nuchia, and Keyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
