The trial court sentenced defendant as a\nfourth-offense habitual offender, MCL 769.12, to concurrent prison terms of 18 years and 9 months\nto 40 years for each assault conviction, 1 to 10 years for the CCW conviction, and 3 to 10 years\nfor the felon-in-possession conviction. Those sentences are to be served consecutively to four\ndifferent terms of imprisonment for each of the felony-firearm convictions; each felony firearm\nsentence is of five-years duration, and each felony firearm sentence is to be served concurrently\nwith the other felony firearm sentences. Defendant\u2019s sentences are not at issue on appeal. Finding\nno reversible error, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions.\n\n                                     I. UNDERLYING FACTS\n\n        Defendant was convicted of assaulting John Thomas, Corey Hubbard, and Elliot Nelson\noutside a Detroit liquor store during the early morning hours of March 6, 2018. The prosecution\u2019s\ntheory at trial was that defendant and another person, Demonte Foster, assaulted the victims after\nthe victims saw defendant hit a woman in the store\u2019s parking lot.1 There was evidence that during\n\n\n1\n In recorded jail calls, defendant stated that cameras showed him in the store in an altercation with\na girl.\n\n\n                                                -1-\n\fdefendant\u2019s altercation with the woman, Thomas stopped his car, in which all three of the victims\nwere riding, at a traffic light in front of the store; Hubbard was in the front passenger seat and\nNelson sat behind Thomas. In an apparent reaction to seeing the occupants of the car watch as\ndefendant struck the woman, Foster stated, \u201cThis ain\u2019t no show,\u201d pulled a gun from his waistband,\napproached Thomas\u2019s car, and struck Hubbard in the face with the gun. As Thomas drove away,\ndefendant and Foster both fired several shots at the car and one bullet struck Nelson in the back.\nNone of the victims were able to identify defendant in a photo array as one of the shooters, but\nthey identified two individuals recorded on the store\u2019s interior surveillance camera as the two men\nwho shot at them. Later, Angie Brown, who had known defendant for more than 20 years,\nidentified defendant in the video footage from the interior surveillance camera. Brown was not at\nthe store on the night of the shooting, but had mentioned defendant\u2019s street name to the police in\nrelation to an unrelated matter. The defense theory at trial was that defendant was misidentified\nas one of the shooters, and that Brown\u2019s identification testimony was not credible because she had\nanimosity towards defendant.\n\n                                  II. MOTION FOR MISTRIAL\n\n        Defendant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a mistrial after the\nprosecutor elicited testimony from Brown that defendant \u201cshot up our house a couple years ago.\u201d\nThe trial court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection to Brown\u2019s response and instructed the jury:\n\u201c[D]isregard that last portion of the testimony related to someone shooting up a house. That hasn\u2019t\nbeen substantiated at all. Disregard that completely, okay.\u201d The trial court subsequently denied\ndefendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial related to this testimony. We find no error.\n\n                                  A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. People\nv Schaw, 288 Mich App 231, 236; 791 NW2d 743 (2010). \u201cThis Court will find an abuse of\ndiscretion if the trial court chose an outcome that is outside the range of principled outcomes.\u201d Id.\nFurthermore, \u201c[a] trial court should grant a mistrial only for an irregularity that is prejudicial to\nthe rights of the defendant and impairs his ability to get a fair trial.\u201d Id. (quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). Stated differently, a \u201cmistrial should be granted only where the error complained\nof is so egregious that the prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way.\u201d People v Gonzales,\n193 Mich App 263, 266; 483 NW2d 458 (1992).\n\n                                           B. ANALYSIS\n\n        As an initial matter, we note that, while it may have been better for the prosecutor to have\navoided asking Brown an opened-ended question about why she did not like defendant, the record\ndoes not reflect that the prosecutor knew what the answer would be, and therefore does not\nestablish that she intended to draw out the prejudicial testimony, as defendant claims. Defendant\ndoes not explain why the record compels imputing misconduct to the prosecutor, given that there\nis nothing to support the suggestion that the prosecutor knew about the prior shooting incident. In\nsupport of his claim that the prosecutor knew that the shooting response was probable, defendant\nrelies on comments Brown made about other incidents involving her nephew that she possibly\ncould have mentioned to the prosecutor in preparation of the case for trial. But defendant provides\nno support for his claim that Brown mentioned a shooting at any point before trial. Thus, there is\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fnothing in the record to support defendant\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor sought to elicit improper\ntestimony.2\n\n         The propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s opened-ended question aside, the issue is whether\nBrown\u2019s response that defendant \u201cshot up our house a couple years ago\u201d was \u201cso egregious\u201d that\na mistrial was required. See id. Defendant immediately objected to the response and the trial court\nsustained the objection. The court also instructed the jury to disregard Brown\u2019s testimony \u201crelated\nto someone shooting up a house\u201d and stated that Brown\u2019s accusation against defendant \u201chasn\u2019t\nbeen substantiated at all.\u201d Curative instructions can alleviate possible prejudice from isolated,\nimproper comments such that a mistrial is not required. People v Waclawski, 286 Mich App 634,\n709-710; 780 NW2d 321 (2009). In addition to the curative instructions that promptly and\nspecifically addressed the objectionable testimony, the trial court also instructed the jury that it\nwas not to consider any excluded evidence or stricken testimony; that the jury was to decide the\ncase based only on the properly admitted evidence; and that the jury was to follow the court\u2019s\ninstructions. Juries are presumed to have followed their instructions. People v Breidenbach, 489\nMich 1, 13; 798 NW2d 738 (2011). After the objection and the curative instruction, the\nobjectionable testimony was never referred to again. Defendant has not presented any basis for\novercoming the presumption that the instruction cured any error, or for concluding that the jury\ndid not or could not follow the trial court\u2019s instructions. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse\nits discretion by denying the motion for mistrial.\n\n                       III. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n\n        Related to his argument that the trial court erred by denying a motion for mistrial based on\nBrown\u2019s testimony, defendant additionally argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing\nto renew the motion for a mistrial after a detective testified that he knew defendant \u201c[f]rom\nprevious ongoing investigations,\u201d which, according to defendant, compounded the prejudicial\neffect of Brown\u2019s improper testimony. Again, we disagree.\n\n                                  A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        Because defendant failed to raise his ineffective-assistance claim in the trial court in\nconnection with a motion for a new trial or to request an evidentiary hearing, \u201cour review is limited\nto the facts on the record.\u201d People v Wilson, 242 Mich App 350, 352; 619 NW2d 413 (2000). \u201cA\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact. A trial court\u2019s\nfindings of fact, if any, are reviewed for clear error, and this Court reviews the ultimate\nconstitutional issue arising from an ineffective assistance of counsel claim de novo.\u201d People v\nPetri, 279 Mich App 407, 410; 760 NW2d 882 (2008).\n\n\n\n\n2\n  While we thus assume that counsel acted out of a lack of experience, given that she twice opened\nthe door to irrelevant and prejudicial testimony in this trial, she would be well-advised to cease the\npractice of asking open-ended questions in instances in which she lacks a reasonable basis for\nassuming that the answer would be admissible.\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f                                           B. ANALYSIS\n\n        To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s\nperformance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional\nnorms and that this performance prejudiced defendant. People v Nix, 301 Mich App 195, 207; 836\nNW2d 224 (2013) (citation omitted). \u201cA defendant must meet a heavy burden to overcome the\npresumption that counsel employed effective trial strategy.\u201d People v Payne, 285 Mich App 181,\n190; 774 NW2d 714 (2009). \u201cTo demonstrate prejudice, a defendant must show the probability\nthat, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d Nix, 301\nMich App at 207.\n\n        Defendant has failed to establish that defense counsel\u2019s response to the detective\u2019s\nobjectionable testimony was unreasonable. Immediately after the detective\u2019s testimony, defense\ncounsel asked to approach the bench. Because no record of the bench conference was made at\ntrial and defendant failed to request an evidentiary hearing, whether defense counsel requested or\ndiscussed the possibility of a mistrial with the trial judge during the bench conference is unknown.\nAs a result of defense counsel\u2019s immediate request for a bench conference, however, the trial judge\ninstructed the jury to \u201cdisregard the Prosecutor\u2019s last question and the witness\u2019 [sic] last answer.\u201d\nIn addition, as discussed earlier, the trial court later instructed the jury that it was not to consider\nany excluded evidence or testimony that was stricken, and that it was to follow the court\u2019s\ninstructions. Again, juries are presumed to have followed their instructions, Breidenbach, 489\nMich at 13, and we are not persuaded that the testimony was so prejudicial that it could not be\ncured by the court\u2019s instructions. Indeed, because defendant was charged with being a felon in\npossession of a firearm, the jury learned\u2014through a stipulation from the defense\u2014that defendant\nwas a convicted felon; that properly-introduced fact had the effect of negating much of the adverse\nimplication that defendant asserts was injected into the trial by virtue of the detective being familiar\nwith defendant through the detective\u2019s work on the \u201cFBI Violent Gang Task Force.\u201d Accordingly,\ndefense counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to move for a mistrial because any such\nobjection would have been futile. See People v Ericksen, 288 Mich App 192, 201; 793 NW2d 120\n(2010) (\u201cFailing to advance a meritless argument or raise a futile objection does not constitute\nineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d). Moreover, the detective\u2019s testimony merely provided\ninformation about his background, which included that he had been an officer for 20 years and his\nthen-current assignment. The record does not support defendant\u2019s claim that the detective\u2019s\nanswer, which provided basic background information, portrayed defendant as a violent gang\nmember.3 Thus, we reject this claim of error.\n\n                                IV. LAY OPINION TESTIMONY\n\n       Defendant next argues that Brown improperly invaded the province of the jury when she\noffered her opinion that defendant was the person depicted in the store\u2019s interior surveillance\nvideo. We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Indeed, the detective did not testify that he was working with the gang task force during the\ninvestigation in this case. He simply testified about his assignment as of the date he testified.\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f                     A. PRESERVATION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        To preserve an issue regarding a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, a defendant must raise that\nparticular issue in the trial court and raise the same basis for objection on appeal. People v Gaines,\n306 Mich App 289, 306; 856 NW2d 222 (2014). Defendant did not object to this testimony below,\nand thus this issue is unpreserved.\n\n     Unpreserved issues are reviewed for plain error. People v Cain, 498 Mich 108, 116; 869\nNW2d 829 (2015).\n\n       To avoid forfeiture under the plain error rule, three requirements must be met: 1)\n       error must have occurred, 2) the error was plain, i.e., clear or obvious, 3) and the\n       plain error affected substantial rights. The third requirement generally requires a\n       showing of prejudice, i.e., that the error affected the outcome of the lower court\n       proceedings. It is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden\n       of persuasion with respect to prejudice. Finally, once a defendant satisfies these\n       three requirements, an appellate court must exercise its discretion in deciding\n       whether to reverse. Reversal is warranted only when the plain, forfeited error\n       resulted in the conviction of an actually innocent defendant or when an error\n       seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\n       independent of the defendant\u2019s innocence. [People v Carines, 460 Mich 750, 763-\n       764; 597 NW2d 130 (1999) (quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted).]\n\n                                           B. ANALYSIS\n\n         MRE 701 permits a lay witness to provide testimony in the form of an opinion if the opinion\nis \u201c(a) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of\nthe witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d But \u201c \u2018a witness cannot express an\nopinion on the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of the charged offense.\u2019 \u201d People v Fomby, 300\nMich App 46, 53; 831 NW2d 887 (2013) (citation omitted). For this reason, if a witness is in no\nbetter position than the jury to identify a person in a video or still photograph, the witness\u2019s opinion\ntestimony identifying a defendant as the individual depicted is generally inadmissible as an\ninvasion of the province of the jury. Id. at 52-53. Conversely, if a witness is in a better position\nthan the jury to identify a person depicted in a video or photograph, the lay opinion testimony does\nnot invade the province of the jury. Id.; see also United States v LaPierre, 998 F2d 1460, 1465\n(CA 9, 1993). As this Court observed in Fomby, 300 Mich App at 52-53, in LaPierre the Ninth\nCircuit offered two illustrations of when a lay witness may identify a defendant in a video or\nphotograph at trial without invading the province of the jury. The court in LaPierre explained:\n\n       Our cases upholding the use of testimony of this type have been limited to two\n       types. The first type is those in which the witness has had substantial and sustained\n       contact with the person in the photograph. The second type is those in which the\n       defendant\u2019s appearance in the photograph is different from his appearance before\n       the jury and the witness is familiar with the defendant as he appears in the\n       photograph. [LaPierre, 998 F2d at 1465 (citations omitted; emphasis added).]\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -5-\n\fThe \u201ccommon thread\u201d binding these types of cases is that \u201cthere is reason to believe that the\nwitness is more likely to identify correctly the person than is the jury.\u201d Id.; see also Fomby, 300\nMich App at 52 (quoting LaPierre).\n\n        The evidence showed that Brown was substantially familiar with defendant. She testified\nthat she had known defendant for approximately 20 years from their neighborhood, and he knew\nmembers of her family. She had been in the same places as defendant numerous times and\ndefendant hung out with her cousins and had been to the house of Brown\u2019s family member.\nSpecifically, Brown saw defendant at a family member\u2019s house during a social gathering and at\nthat time she was within \u201carm\u2019s reach\u201d of him. Furthermore, she last saw defendant in 2018, the\nsame year that the offense occurred. Thus, Brown was in a superior position to identify defendant\nin the surveillance video because of her substantial contact with him over a period of many years.\nConsequently, Brown\u2019s testimony did not invade the province of the jury, and her lay opinion\ntestimony, which was rationally based on her perception of the video and helpful to the jury\u2019s\ndetermination of a material fact at issue (identity), was admissible under MRE 701. See Fomby,\n300 Mich App at 52-53; LaPierre, 998 F2d 1465. Thus, defendant cannot establish error, plain or\notherwise.\n\n                               V. IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE\n\n        Defendant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress Brown\u2019s\nidentification testimony. Again, we disagree.\n\n                                  A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        \u201cThe trial court\u2019s decision to admit identification evidence will not be reversed unless it is\nclearly erroneous.\u201d People v Harris, 261 Mich App 44, 51; 680 NW2d 17 (2004). \u201cClear error\nexists if the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\nmade.\u201d Id.\n\n                                          B. ANALYSIS\n\n        Defendant argues that Brown\u2019s identification testimony was inadmissible because it was\ntainted by an unduly suggestive identification procedure in which the police used a single\nphotographic identification procedure. Although identification procedures that are \u201cunnecessarily\nsuggestive and conducive to irreparable misidentification\u201d deny a defendant due process, People\nv Williams, 244 Mich App 533, 542; 624 NW2d 575 (2001), the record fails to establish that any\nimpermissible or unduly suggestive identification procedure occurred here. An improper\nsuggestion may arise when a witness is shown only one person because the witness will be tempted\nto presume that the photograph is of the person suspected of committing the crime. People v Gray,\n457 Mich 107, 111; 577 NW2d 92 (1998). But, as the trial court observed, this case did not involve\na standard photographic identification where a witness to a crime was shown a photograph to\ndetermine if she could identify the suspect. Rather, Brown had no knowledge that a crime had\nbeen committed when she identified defendant. Brown had a prior relationship with defendant\nand the photograph was used only to help confirm the identity of the person in the photograph, i.e.,\nto determine whether the person in the photo was the same person with whom Brown already was\nfamiliar. This procedure did not create a substantial likelihood of misidentification. See People v\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fWoolfolk, 304 Mich App 450, 457-458; 848 NW2d 169 (2014) (\u201cThe witness testified that he\nknew, and grew up with, the shooter. Under these circumstances, the use of a single photograph\ndid not create a substantial likelihood of misidentification and, therefore, did not violate\ndefendant\u2019s right to due process.\u201d).\n\n        Brown had mentioned defendant by nickname to the police in an unrelated matter. The\npolice later showed Brown a five-second portion of the liquor store\u2019s interior surveillance video,\nwithout providing her any context for the video. Furthermore, the police did not mention\ndefendant\u2019s name before Brown watched the video, and Brown immediately identified defendant\nwith no police prompting. The detective then showed her a photograph to confirm that the person\nin the photograph was the person Brown had identified. Finally, as discussed earlier, Brown had\nknown defendant for more than 20 years and was substantially familiar with him. Under these\ncircumstances, the use of a single photograph was not unduly suggestive and did not create a\nsubstantial likelihood of misidentification.\n\n        Defendant also argues that there was no independent basis for Brown\u2019s in-court\nidentification. \u201cThe need to establish an independent basis for an in-court identification arises\n[only] where the pretrial identification is tainted by improper procedure or is unduly suggestive.\u201d\nPeople v Barclay, 208 Mich App 670, 675; 528 NW2d 842 (1995). As previously discussed, there\nwas no pretrial identification procedure that was unduly suggestive. Thus, whether there was an\nindependent basis for Brown\u2019s challenged testimony is irrelevant. See id.\n\n                       VI. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE \u2013 CCW\n\n       Lastly, defendant argues that the prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence to support\nhis conviction of CCW. We disagree.\n\n                                  A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         A valid criminal conviction requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of\nevery crime. People v Jaffray, 445 Mich 287, 296; 519 NW2d 108 (1994). A challenge to the\nsufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction presents a question of law subject to\nreview de novo. People v Herndon, 246 Mich App 371, 415; 633 NW2d 376 (2001). When\nreviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case, a reviewing court must view the\nevidence of record in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether a rational\ntrier of fact could find that each element of the crime was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.\nA reviewing court \u201cmust consider not whether there was any evidence to support the conviction\nbut whether there was sufficient evidence to justify a rational trier of fact in finding guilt beyond\na reasonable doubt.\u201d People v Wolfe, 440 Mich 508, 513-514; 489 NW2d 748, amended 441 Mich\n1201 (1992) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Our \u201cstandard of review is deferential: a\nreviewing court is required to draw all reasonable inferences and make credibility choices in\nsupport of the jury verdict.\u201d People v Oros, 502 Mich 229, 239; 917 NW2d 559 (2018) (citation\nomitted). \u201cConflicting evidence and disputed facts are to be resolved by the trier of fact. Minimal\ncircumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences can sufficiently prove the defendant\u2019s state of\nmind, knowledge, or intent.\u201d People v Miller, 326 Mich App 719, 735; 929 NW2d 821 (2019)\n(citations omitted). Similarly, \u201c[c]ircumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences that arise from\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fsuch evidence can constitute satisfactory proof of the elements of the crime.\u201d People v Kanaan,\n278 Mich App 594, 619; 751 NW2d 57 (2008).\n\n                                          B. ANALYSIS\n\n       The elements of CCW require proof that the defendant (1) knowingly carried a weapon\nand (2) that the weapon was concealed on or about his person. See MCL 750.227; People v\nHernandez-Garcia, 477 Mich 1039, 1040; 728 NW2d 406 (2007); M Crim JI 11.1. A firearm is\nconcealed if there is \u201csome kind of withdrawal from observation so as to hide or secrete an object.\u201d\nPeople v Kincade, 61 Mich App 498, 504; 233 NW2d 54 (1975).4\n\n        Defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his CCW conviction because\nthere was no eyewitness testimony that he had a gun on his person before entering the liquor store,\n\u201cno visible bulges\u201d on his body in the surveillance video, and someone could have passed him the\ngun when he was outside before the shooting. But defendant\u2019s arguments would require us to view\nthe evidence in the light more favorable to him, not in the light most favorable to the prosecution\nas we are required to do. Herndon, 246 Mich App at 415. Furthermore, defendant\u2019s challenges,\nincluding the inferences which could permissibly be drawn from the evidence, are related to the\nweight and credibility of the evidence, which were issues for the jury to resolve. See Kanaan, 278\nMich App at 619 (\u201cThis Court will not interfere with the trier of fact\u2019s role of determining the\nweight of the evidence or the credibility of witnesses.\u201d); People v Scotts, 80 Mich App 1, 9; 263\nNW2d 272 (1977) (\u201c[T]he credibility of witnesses is a matter of weight, not sufficiency.\nDeterminations of credibility are made by the jury which heard the testimony and observed the\nwitnesses, and this Court will not substitute its judgment on this issue.\u201d).\n\n        The jury observed the surveillance video footage, heard the testimony, and was free to\naccept or reject the theory of either party in light of the evidence presented at trial. As discussed,\nwe must construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, Herndon, 246 Mich\nApp at 415. Additionally, only minimal circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences that\ncan be made from that evidence are required to establish the sufficiency of the evidence. See\nMiller, 326 Mich App at 735. Contrary to what defendant suggests, it was not necessary for an\neyewitness to have testified that defendant possessed a gun on his person before entering the store\nor that there was a visible bulge in his clothing. The evidence established that defendant was\nclearly visible in the liquor store immediately before the shooting and he did not appear to have a\nvisible gun on his person at that time. Then, shortly thereafter, defendant had a gun and shot it at\nthe victims. Taken together, these facts establish sufficient circumstantial evidence and the basis\nfor reasonable inferences for a rational jury to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, that\ndefendant was concealing a gun when he was in the liquor store. Thus, the evidence was sufficient\nto support defendant\u2019s conviction of CCW, and we will not disturb the jury\u2019s verdict which reached\nthat permissible conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  \u201cAlthough cases decided before November 1, 1990, are not binding precedent, MCR 7.215(J)(1),\nthey nevertheless can be considered persuasive authority.\u201d In re Stillwell Trust, 299 Mich App\n289, 299 n 1; 829 NW2d 353 (2012) (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\f                                      VII. CONCLUSION\n\n        For the reasons stated, we find that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find\ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and that his other claims regarding errors in his trial\nare without merit. We therefore affirm defendant\u2019s convictions.\n\n                                                            /s/ Karen M.
