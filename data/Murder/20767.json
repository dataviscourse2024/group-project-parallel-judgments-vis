The trial court sentenced appellant on\nJune 10, 2011, to confinement for forty years in the Institutional Division of the Texas\nDepartment of Criminal Justice.\n\n       In two issues, appellant claims his sentence was grossly disproportionate to the\noffense underlying the conviction, resulting in cruel and unusual punishment in violation\nof the United States and Texas constitutions. 1            To preserve for appellate review a\ncomplaint that a sentence is grossly disproportionate, constituting cruel and unusual\n\n       1\n        Appellant concedes that his sentence was within the applicable statutory range. See Tex. Penal\nCode Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 12.32 and 19.02(b)(1) (West 2011).\n\fpunishment, a defendant must present to the trial court a timely request, objection, or\nmotion stating the specific grounds for the ruling desired. See Tex.R.App. P. 33.1(a);\nRhoades v. State, 934 S.W.2d 113, 120 (Tex.Crim.App.1996) (defendant waived any error\nbecause he presented his argument for first time on appeal); Jagaroo v. State, 180 S.W.3d\n793, 802 (Tex. App. -- Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. ref'd) (defendant did not raise\ncomplaints that his sentences violated his state and federal rights against cruel and unusual\npunishment in the trial court, and thus failed to preserve them for appellate review).\n\n       Appellant cites Meadoux v. State, 325 S.W.3d 189, 193 n. 5 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2010), as a case in which the court \u2015reviewed the constitutionality of severe sentences for\njuveniles despite such claims being raised for the first time on appeal.\u2016 In Meadoux the\ncourt noted that the State had failed to argue error was not preserved in the court of appeals,\nthe court of appeals did not address it in affirming the conviction, and the court did not\ngrant review to consider it. Here, the State argues in its brief that error was not preserved.\nMeadoux does not support a departure from well-established precedent that claims of cruel\nand unusual punishment must be preserved in the trial court. See Arriaga v. State, 335\nS.W.3d 331, 334-35 (Tex. App. \u2013 Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, pet. ref\u2019d).\n\n       The claim presented on appeal was not raised when appellant was sentenced or in a\npost-verdict motion filed with the trial court. Accordingly, nothing is preserved for our\nreview. See Castaneda v. State, 135 S.W.3d 719, 723 (Tex. App. -- Dallas 2003, no pet.).\nWe overrule appellant\u2019s issues and affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n                                                   PER CURIAM\n\n\n\nPanel consists of Justices Brown, Boyce, and McCally.\nDo Not Publish \u2014 TEX. R. APP. P. 47.2(b).\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f",
