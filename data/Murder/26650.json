Agron, under Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6 (Section 170.6). The underlying\n\ncase is a murder prosecution which the People dismissed and refiled the same day along\n\nwith the peremptory challenge.\n\n       Respondent, the Superior Court of San Bernardino County, refused to honor the\n\nperemptory challenge, deeming it untimely. Relying on Birts v. Superior Court (2018)\n\n22 Cal.App.5th 53 (Birts), the court concluded the People were engaged in prosecutorial\n\n\u201cgamesmanship\u201d and attempting to \u201cforum shop[],\u201d and held the second complaint was a\n\ncontinuation of the prior case, not a new case, making the peremptory challenge\n\nuntimely.\n\n       The People argue the case falls under Paredes v. Superior Court (1999) 77\n\nCal. App. 4th 24 (Paredes), which recognizes that when a criminal case is dismissed and\n\nrefiled it is a new case for purposes of Section 170.6. They argue Birts does not apply\n\nbecause they weren\u2019t attempting to avoid a ruling of the trial court. We agree and\n\ntherefore will direct the trial court to honor the peremptory challenge.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                                                I\n\n                                           FACTS\n\n       A. The Incident\n\n       According to the People\u2019s trial brief, this case arises from a violent outburst by\n\nreal party in interest, William Olivo.1\n\n       The People say Olivo attended a Super Bowl party on February 4, 2018 with B.K.\n\nand her boyfriend D.C., among others, at a residence in Twentynine Palms. All three\n\nstayed overnight. Early the following morning, D.C. left for work. B.K. woke later,\n\nfound herself alone with Olivo, and started cleaning the apartment. Apparently she upset\n\nOlivo when she threw away a nearly empty bag of candy. She apologized and removed\n\nthe candy from the trash, but Olivo remained aggravated. He said, \u201c[You\u2019re] not my\n\ngirlfriend. I don\u2019t have to put up with [your] shit. I will kill you.\u201d B.K. was frightened\n\nand fled to a bathroom, where she locked herself in. As she left, Olivo said, \u201cDon\u2019t even\n\nthink about calling the cops, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n\n       B.K. perceived Olivo to be a threat and called D.C. to help her get out of the\n\napartment. D.C. returned to the apartment with his roommate, J.T. When they arrived,\n\nthey found Olivo on the couch in the living room. They ignored him and located B.K.\n\nD.C. then went to speak to Olivo, while J.T. and B.K. were in the adjoining kitchen.\n\nD.C. said, \u201cWhat was going on here?\u201d Olivo became defensive and yelled loudly that\n\nthey needed to leave. Olivo stood up from the couch and moved close to D.C., yelling at\n\n       1 We issued an order to show cause and granted Olivo permission to file a formal\nreturn within 25 days. He elected not to do so.\n                                                3\n\fhim. Though D.C. attempted to defuse the situation, Olivo charged, grabbed D.C. at the\n\nwaist and pushed him against a wall.\n\n       B.K. and J.T. moved away when Olivo attacked D.C. They then heard D.C.\n\nscream, \u201cI\u2019ve been stabbed!\u201d J.T. ran to the living room and found D.C. on his back with\n\nOlivo on top of him. He pulled Olivo off, whereupon Olivo turned on him brandishing a\n\nknife in a threatening manner. J.T. identified the knife as the murder weapon at the\n\npreliminary hearing. J.T. eventually got Olivo to leave and returned to help his friend,\n\nwho lay in a pool of blood.\n\n       When San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived at the scene, they found\n\nOlivo pacing outside the apartment. He had blood on his clothing and held the bloody\n\nknife, which he refused to relinquish. After a lengthy standoff, the deputies took Olivo\n\ninto custody. D.C. died of multiple sharp-force injuries.\n\n       B. Lower Court Proceedings\n\n       On February 7, 2018, the San Bernardino District Attorney\u2019s Office charged Olivo\n\nwith the murder of D.C. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a), unlabeled statutory citations refer to\n\nthis code), and the personal use of a deadly and dangerous weapon (\u00a7 12022, subd.\n\n(b)(1)), issuing criminal threats against B.K. (\u00a7 422), dissuading a witness (B.K.) from\n\nreporting a crime against her (\u00a7 136.1, subd. (b)(1)), and assault with a deadly weapon\n\nagainst J.T. (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)). Judge Rodney A. Cortez arraigned Olivo in case\n\nNumber FMB 18000079 on February 7, 2018.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f      After some delay related to doubt about Olivo\u2019s mental health (see \u00a7 1368, subd.\n\n(c)), Judge Agron held Olivo to answer for the murder, criminal threats, and assault with\n\na deadly weapon counts, but not the witness dissuasion count. Nevertheless, the People\n\nfiled an information charging Olivo with all four counts. Olivo sought to dismiss all the\n\ncounts under section 995. On November 7, 2018, Judge Cortez denied Olivo\u2019s motion to\n\ndismiss as to the murder, criminal threats, and assault with a deadly weapon counts, but\n\ngranted it as to the witness dissuasion count. The People then filed a first amended\n\ninformation, containing only the three surviving charges, and Judge Agron arraigned\n\nOlivo on November 16, 2018.\n\n      On November 30, 2018, the parties announced they were ready for trial. The\n\nPeople filed their trial brief on December 3, 2018. However, Olivo subsequently asked\n\nfor several continuances, which the trial court granted. Meanwhile, Olivo sought to\n\nexclude his statements he had made to police on the ground they had been obtained\n\nimproperly.\n\n      That motion was still pending when the People moved to dismiss the case on\n\nMarch 5, 2019. They said they weren\u2019t prepared to go forward with trial at that time, and\n\nannounced they would refile. They filed a new complaint the same day (case No.\n\nFMB19000094), charging Olivo with the same four felonies originally filed in the first\n\ncase and a new misdemeanor count based on Olivo\u2019s alleged battery of Z.J. (\u00a7\u00a7 242,\n\n243). They also filed a peremptory challenge against Judge Agron in the new case.\n\nOlivo filed his own peremptory challenge against Judge Cortez.\n\n\n                                            5\n\f       Judge Cortez arraigned Olivo on the new complaint, then turned to the peremptory\n\nchallenges. He denied the People\u2019s peremptory challenge on the ground it was untimely.\n\nHe accused the district attorney\u2019s office of gamesmanship. The court noted Judge Agron\n\nhad been assigned the case \u201csince its inception,\u201d and had issued rulings unfavorable to\n\nthe People. Judge Cortez concluded \u201cthis is purely\u2014what the Birts case is talking about\n\nis prosecutorial gamesmanship in order to gain an upper hand and forum shop.\u201d Judge\n\nCortez didn\u2019t rule on the peremptory challenge filed by defendant and assigned the matter\n\nfor all purposes to Judge Agron.\n\n                                             II\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n       The People argue the trial court erred in concluding their Section 170.6\n\nperemptory challenge was untimely.\n\n       \u201cThe determination of the question of the disqualification of a judge is not an\n\nappealable order and may be reviewed only by a writ of mandate from the appropriate\n\ncourt of appeal sought only by the parties to the proceeding.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 170.3,\n\nsubd. (d); Zilog, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 86 Cal. App. 4th 1309, 1314-1315.) Where\n\nthe underlying material facts are not in dispute, we review the trial court\u2019s order denying\n\na peremptory challenge de novo. (Swift v. Superior Court (2009) 172 Cal. App. 4th 878,\n\n882; Ziesmer v. Superior Court (2003) 107 Cal. App. 4th 360, 363 (Ziesmer) [\u201cIn deciding\n\na section 170.6 motion, the trial court has no discretion\u201d so it is \u201cappropriate to review a\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fdecision granting or denying a peremptory challenge under section 170.6 as [a question]\n\nof law\u201d under a \u201cde novo standard\u201d].)\n\n       \u201cSection 170.6 permits a party to obtain the disqualification of a judge for\n\nprejudice, upon a sworn statement, without being required to establish [prejudice] as a\n\nfact to the satisfaction of a judicial body.\u201d (Barrett v. Superior Court (1999) 77\n\nCal. App. 4th 1, 4.) \u201cWhere a disqualification motion is timely filed and in proper form,\n\nthe trial court is bound to accept it without further inquiry.\u201d (Ibid.) Disqualification is\n\nrequired \u201ceven if the court suspects that the party has abused its right to utilize section\n\n170.6.\u201d (La Seigneurie U.S. Holdings, Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 29 Cal. App. 4th\n\n1500, 1505.)\n\n       \u201cAs a general rule, a challenge of a judge is permitted under section 170.6 any\n\ntime before the commencement of a trial or hearing.\u201d (People v. Superior Court (Lavi)\n\n(1993) 4 Cal. 4th 1164, 1171.) There are three exceptions to the general rule, including\n\nthe \u201call-purpose assignment\u201d rule under which a party must bring a motion for\n\nperemptory challenge within 10 days after notice a case has been assigned to a judge for\n\nall purposes. (Id. at p. 1172.)\n\n       The question in this case is whether the People initiated a new case by dismissing\n\ncase Number FMB 18000079 and filing case Number FMB19000094. If they did, then\n\nthe peremptory challenge was timely under both the general rule and under the all-\n\npurpose assignment rule. The People filed their motion requesting disqualification the\n\nsame day they filed the second case. Thus, they made their request before the\n\n\n                                              7\n\fcommencement of trial and before the new case had been assigned to any judge for all\n\npurposes. Since the trial court has no discretion whether to grant a timely motion, the\n\ntrial court should have granted the motion as a matter of law.\n\n       On the other hand, if the new case was really a continuation of the prior case, the\n\nperemptory challenge was not timely under the all-purpose assignment rule. The first\n\ncase was assigned to Judge Agron for all purposes on October 16, 2018. The People\n\nbrought their peremptory challenge the same day they filed the second case, March 5,\n\n2019. Thus, if there was only a single case, the peremptory challenge occurred after the\n\nall-purposes assignment, and was for that reason untimely.\n\n       How do we decide whether there was one case or two? We look to the statutes\n\nand case law, which make it clear the dismissal terminated the first case and the new\n\nfiling started a second.\n\n       As the Second District, Division One explained, it is important to strictly enforce\n\nthe statutes concerning the termination of criminal cases. \u201cPenal Code section 1382,\n\nsubdivision (a)(2), gives the defendant in a felony case the right to be brought to trial\n\nwithin 60 days of his arraignment in superior court . . . Unless salvaged by circumstances\n\nsupporting the application of an exception, the rule is that a prosecution twice terminated\n\npursuant to Penal Code section 1382 is barred and cannot be refiled.\u201d (Paredes, supra,\n\n77 Cal.App.4th at p. 35.) \u201cTo prevent the mischief that would otherwise result, a\n\n\u2018termination\u2019 pursuant to Penal Code section 1382 must be treated as a termination, not\n\nas a nit to be picked only when it serves the convenience of the prosecutor or the\n\n\n                                              8\n\fcourt . . . [Holding otherwise] would, in effect, . . . create[] yet another judicial exception\n\nto the rules adopted by the Legislature when it enacted and subsequently amended\n\nsections 1382 and 1387. That is not our role.\u201d (Ibid.)\n\n       We agree with the Second District that rather than conjure exceptions, we must\n\nfollow the plain meaning of the statutes governing the termination of prosecutions.\n\n\u201cPenal Code section 1382 commands that, absent good cause to do otherwise, the court\n\n\u2018shall order the action to be dismissed\u2019 when it is not brought to trial within the required\n\ntime. Penal Code section 1384, by its mandate to discharge the defendant from custody if\n\nthe judge directs dismissal of the action, tells us this dismissal is real. Penal Code section\n\n1387 provides that an \u2018order terminating an action\u2019 pursuant to these statutes is a bar to\n\nany other prosecution under the circumstances described. Penal Code section 1387.2 tells\n\nus that, \u2018[u]pon the express consent of both the people and the defendant, in lieu of\n\nissuing an order terminating an action the court may proceed on the existing accusatory\n\npleading,\u2019 in which event a new time period commences. In our view, a finding that the\n\nrefiled case was but a continuation of the terminated case would be tantamount to a\n\nsomewhat oxymoronic \u2018compelled express consent\u2019 under Penal Code section 1387.2.\n\n. . . [T]here would have been no need . . . to enact Penal Code section 1387.2 if a refiled\n\ncase could be treated as a continuation of a dismissed case.\u201d (Paredes, supra, 77\n\nCal.App.4th at pp. 35-36.)\n\n       Like many courts before us, we conclude the reasoning of Paredes is persuasive\n\nand see no need to depart from it. (E.g., Ziesmer, supra, 107 Cal. App. 4th 360; People v.\n\n\n                                               9\n\fMason (2006) 140 Cal. App. 4th 1190, 1198.) When the trial court dismissed case\n\nNumber FMB18000079, that terminated the case for all purposes. When the People filed\n\na complaint in case Number FMB19000094, that began a second case. It follows that the\n\nPeople\u2019s simultaneously filed peremptory challenge was timely, and the trial court was\n\nrequired to grant it.\n\n          The trial court reached the contrary conclusion by following the recent decision of\n\nBirts, supra, 22 Cal.App.5th 53. There, the First District, Division Three applied the\n\n\u201ccontinuation rule\u201d it found in civil disqualification cases to identify an exception to the\n\ntermination rule. (See NutraGenetics, LLC v. Superior Court (2009) 179 Cal. App. 4th\n\n243 [unpaid wages and fraud lawsuit]; Pickett v. Superior Court (2012) 203 Cal. App. 4th\n\n887 [class action under the Private Attorney Generals Act].) The Court of Appeal\n\nconcluded \u201cParedes and Ziesmer do not control in situations where, as here, the second\n\ncase is virtually identical to the dismissed case and the sole rationale articulated for the\n\ndismissal and refiling is to evade the impact of rulings made in the first case.\u201d (Birts, at\n\np. 59.)\n\n          We need not decide whether the \u201ccontinuation rule\u201d ever applies in criminal cases,\n\nwhere dismissal has significant consequences affecting the rights of the accused. It\n\ndoesn\u2019t apply in this case. In Birts, \u201cthe record discloses the District Attorney\u2019s clear and\n\nsingular intent to evade the effect of Judge Buchwald\u2019s evidentiary rulings by dismissing\n\nthe prior action.\u201d (Birts, supra, 22 Cal.App.5th at p. 60.) The prosecutor \u201cstated rather\n\nopenly\u2014that the refiled case involves the same charges as before, and that the decision to\n\n\n                                               10\n\fdismiss the first case was motivated solely by Judge Buchwald\u2019s pretrial rulings.\u201d (Id. at\n\np. 59.) Here, the People moved to dismiss on the stated ground that they couldn\u2019t bring\n\nthe case to trial by the deadline. Thus, we conclude, whatever the merits of applying the\n\ncontinuation rule in the criminal setting, the rule would not apply under the facts of this\n\ncase. Accordingly, the peremptory challenge was timely and the trial court should have\n\ngranted it.\n\n                                              III\n\n                                       DISPOSITION\n\n       Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the respondent superior court to\n\n(1) vacate its order denying the People\u2019s peremptory challenge under Section 170.6 and\n\n(2) issue a new order granting the peremptory challenge.
