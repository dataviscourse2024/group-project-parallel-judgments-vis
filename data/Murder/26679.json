In this direct appeal, Jones claims eight\n\nbases for relief, although several involve overlapping issues. We reject Jones\u2019s\n\nclaims and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n\n      (2)    Several of Jones\u2019s arguments are identical or nearly identical to those\n\nadvanced by his codefendant, DePaul Wilson, in a separate appeal. Although this\n\nCourt\u2019s disposition of Wilson\u2019s appeal has no direct preclusive effect upon Jones\u2019s\n\nclaims, we find no error with our earlier affirmance of Wilson\u2019s convictions and\n\nadopt similar reasoning to reject Jones\u2019s claims that are based on substantially the\n\nsame facts and legal arguments. In particular and for the reasons stated in Wilson v.\n\fState,1 we reject Jones\u2019s arguments that (i) the prosecutor engaged in misconduct\n\nwhen he argued that the jury could infer that the alleged murder victim fired shots\n\nfrom a prone position, and (ii) the trial court abused its discretion when it overruled\n\nJones\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s statements in closing argument that the jury\n\nwas to \u201cdecide what occurred.\u201d2\n\n       (3)    We likewise reject the remainder of Jones\u2019s arguments.\n\n       (4)    First, the trial court did not commit plain error by not severing the trial\n\nof Jones and Wilson sua sponte. On the record before us, it appears to us that there\n\nis at least a plausible basis for concluding that Jones\u2019s trial counsel chose not to\n\nmove to sever for strategic reasons. It did not violate Jones\u2019s right to a fair trial for\n\nthe trial court to decline to interfere sua sponte with such a plausible strategy.\n\n       (5)    Second, Jones\u2019s due process rights were not violated when the State\n\npresented a recording of Jones\u2019s interview by a detective that included two\n\ncomments by the detective to which Jones now objects. These comments include\n\none where the detective said, \u201cI hope you come clean here soon,\u201d and another where\n\nthe detective said, \u201cyou know this game and you know it well.\u201d Jones argues that\n\nthese comments improperly impugned Jones\u2019s credibility and character. We\n\n\n1\n  Wilson v. State, 2019 WL 2157517, at *1 (Del. May 16, 2019).\n2\n  The State argues that Jones failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s statements at trial and that,\ntherefore, we should review for plain error. Although our previous ruling against Wilson on this\nsame issue suggests that Jones\u2019s argument should fail as an a fortiori matter if we are reviewing\nfor plain error, it seems to us that Wilson\u2019s trial counsel spoke for both defendants on this\nobjection, B437\u201339, and thus that Jones adequately preserved the issue for appeal.\n\n                                                   2\n\fdisagree. These comments were included only after Jones had an opportunity to and\n\ndid in fact redact objectionable portions of the interview. In other words, Jones did\n\nnot object at trial to the jury hearing these comments. Moreover, these comments\n\nwere fleeting in the context of a long interview. 3 And finally, in response to the\n\ndetective\u2019s comment that he wanted Jones to \u201ccome clean,\u201d Jones did indeed change\n\nhis account to the detective.\n\n       (6)    Third, it was not improper for the prosecutor to refer to the defendants\u2019\n\naccounts as \u201cstories.\u201d As the State correctly points out, the term \u201cstory\u201d has several\n\nmeanings, and we are satisfied that when considered in context, the prosecutor\u2019s use\n\nof \u201cstories\u201d meant something like \u201caccounts\u201d and not \u201clies.\u201d\n\n       (7)    Fourth, it was not plain error for the Superior Court to refer on occasion\n\nto Jones and Wilson as a collective unit in its jury instructions. Neither Jones nor\n\nWilson opposed those aspects of the instructions during trial, and in any case, the\n\ntrial court separately instructed the jury that they should separately consider each\n\ncount as to each individual defendant.\n\n       (8)    Last, it was not plain error for the Superior Court to permit a recording\n\nof Jones\u2019s police interview to go to the jury room. Jones did not make a\n\ncontemporaneous objection, and Jones\u2019s argument on appeal is unavailing. Jones\n\n\n3\n  This characterization is supported by the fact that Jones\u2019s experienced trial counsel did not\nrequest a redaction of these comments during the pretrial review of the video transcript with the\nprosecution and the trial court.\n\n                                                   3\n\fargues that, as a piece of out-of-court testimony, the recording should not have been\n\nallowed into the jury room. Jones cites United States v. Binder 4 in support, but\n\nBinder dealt with the videotaped testimony of a non-defendant witness,\n\ndistinguishing it from Jones\u2019s case. Furthermore, as we held in Flonnery v. State,5\n\nJones\u2019s proposition \u201cdoes not apply to . . . incriminating statements a defendant\n\nmakes directly.\u201d6\n\n       NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the judgment of the Superior\n\nCourt is AFFIRMED.\n\n                                       BY THE COURT:\n\n\n                                       /s/ Gary F.
