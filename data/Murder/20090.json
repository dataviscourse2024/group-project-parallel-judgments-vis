(1)  The jury\r\nalso  assessed punishment at life imprisonment, the only punishment allowed because\r\nappellant was a juvenile certified to be tried as an adult. (2)  In three points of error,\r\nappellant argues that the trial court erred (1) in denying appellant's Batson challenge\r\nfor excluding two African-American venire members; (2) in admitting hearsay\r\nevidence in violation of the Sixth Amendment and Rule 802 of the Texas Rules of\r\nEvidence and (3) in admitting prejudicial photographic evidence in violation of Rule\r\n403 of the Texas Rules of Evidence. \r\n\r\n\tWe affirm.Background\r\n\r\n\tAppellant, Jarrett Delaine Driver, entered Dina's Donuts, the business of the\r\ncomplainant Bunrith In, on August 13, 2005 at approximately 4:30 a.m.  Appellant,\r\na frequent customer of Dina's Donuts, ordered five breakfast tacos from the\r\ncomplainant's wife, Mon Meach.  Meach asked appellant if he would like to have his\r\ntacos heated.  After appellant agreed to have the tacos heated, he pointed a gun to\r\nMeach's forehead, cocked the gun, and attempted to fire the gun at Meach.  The\r\ncomplainant moved from another work area in the shop and went to the register area\r\nwhere appellant was threatening Meach.  The complainant pulled Meach away and\r\nasked appellant what he wanted.  Appellant demanded money, and the complainant\r\nopened the cash register and gave appellant twenty dollars.  After appellant confirmed\r\nthat twenty dollars was the extent of the complainant's holdings, appellant demanded\r\nthe tacos.  After the complainant handed appellant the tacos, appellant slapped the\r\ntacos from the complainant's hands, brandished a knife, and chased the complainant\r\nand Meach around the store.  The complainant then confronted appellant and they\r\nbegan to fight.  The complainant fell to the ground, and appellant ran out of the shop. \r\nMeach locked the door and called 911, but the complainant died at the scene.\r\n\r\n\tBaytown Police Detective Charles Widner, Jr. interviewed Meach on three\r\nseparate occasions prior to trial.  Meach, a person of Cambodian descent with limited\r\nEnglish proficiency, required an interpreter for each interview.  Meach's relatives\r\ntranslated for Meach in the first interview with Widner; a Cambodian interpreter\r\nemployed by the Houston Police Department translated in the second interview, and\r\nNimol In, the daughter of the complainant and Meach, translated for Meach in the\r\nthird interview.  Widner brought a photo array that included appellant's photo to the\r\nthird interview, which was held in Meach's home on August 17, 2005.  Meach, with\r\nNimol In serving as translator, identified appellant as the complainant's assailant at\r\nthat interview.  When Meach identified appellant, she tapped the photo, and Widner\r\nthen circled it.  Police arrested appellant at his residence on August 17, 2005, at\r\napproximately 8:40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\tMeach testified at appellant's trial, where she was subject to cross-examination. \r\nShe again identified appellant as the assailant, this time in response to questions\r\ntranslated by an interpreter supplied by the trial court.  \r\n\r\nBatson Challenge\r\n\r\n\tIn his first point of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in denying\r\nappellant's Batson challenge to the State's use of peremptory strikes against venire\r\nmembers Winfield and Ellis.  See Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 89, 106 S. Ct.\r\n1712, 1719 (1986). \r\n\r\n\tStandard of Review\r\n\r\n\tWe review the trial court's decision in response to a Batson challenge with\r\ngreat deference and will not overturn the trial court's ruling unless the decision is\r\nclearly erroneous.  Mathis v. State, 67 S.W.3d 918, 924 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002)\r\n(citing Chamberlain v. State, 998 S.W.2d 230, 236 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999)).  We\r\nreview the decision under a highly deferential standard because the trial court is in\r\nthe best position to determine whether the State's facially race-neutral explanation for\r\na peremptory strike is genuinely race-neutral.  Gibson v. State, 144 S.W.3d 530, 534\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2004) (citing Jasper v. State, 61 S.W.3d 413, 421-22 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. 2001)).\r\n\r\n\tAnalysis\r\n\r\n\tThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the State\r\nfrom using peremptory strikes for the purpose of excluding venire members on the\r\nbasis of race.  U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Batson, 476 U.S. at 89, 106 S. Ct. at 1719. \r\nThe defendant bears the burden to make a prima facie showing that the State used its\r\nperemptory strikes to exclude venire members on the basis of race.  Herron v. State,\r\n86 S.W.3d 621, 630 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002).  After the defendant makes the requisite\r\nprima facie showing, the State has the burden to produce a race-neutral explanation\r\nfor its use of peremptory strikes.  Id.  After the State produces a race-neutral\r\nexplanation, the defendant may rebut the explanation as mere pretext.  Id.  The trial\r\ncourt must then decide whether the defendant has proved purposeful discrimination. \r\n\r\n\tHere, appellant argues that the State struck venire member Winfield because\r\nhe is African-American.  The State argues that it struck Winfield because of his\r\nanswers to questions regarding whether the education level of a witness would affect\r\nhis evaluation of the witness's credibility.  \r\n\r\n\tDuring the voir dire examination, the following exchange took place between\r\nthe State and venire member Winfield:\r\n\r\n\t[State]:\tMr. Winfield, let me come back to you as Juror No. 1.  Do\r\nyou think perhaps a person's education level might affect\r\ntheir ability to understand questions, for instance?  You\r\nthink that's something that [sic] might or might not make\r\na difference?\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t[Winfield]:\tIt could.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t[State]:\tCould?  Okay.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t[Winfield]:\tDepends on how you phrase it to them.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t[State]:\tExactly.  Sometimes when I'm in trial and I get really tired,\r\nquestions make a lot of sense up here.  But when they come\r\nout of my mouth, they don't make much sense.  Or maybe\r\nI learned a new word from my 14-year old last night and I\r\nused that word and it's a word just out of the blue.  What\r\n[sic] you look at those kinds of questions as far as\r\nanalyzing a person's credibility about their [sic] ability to\r\nunderstand the questions?  Is that something you would\r\ntake into account?\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t[Winfield]:\tNo.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tAfter the voir dire examination was completed, appellant made his Batson\r\nchallenge to the State's decision to strike Winfield.  The State gave the following\r\nexplanation for its decision to strike Winfield before the trial court:\r\n\r\n\t[The State]:\tThe victim's wife in this case, the victim, grew up in\r\nCambodia. She has very little education.  And I'm\r\nconcerned about Mr. Winfield's answers relative to the\r\neducation level being something that he wouldn't be\r\nconcerned with as far as judging a person's credibility. \r\nI've had problems with their understanding stuff even\r\nthrough a translator.  That's why Mr. Winfield was struck. \r\nThere was somebody else that didn't have those kinds of\r\nproblems and I didn't strike that individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe trial court accepted the State's race-neutral explanation and denied\r\nappellant's Batson challenge.  Here, the State merely recited the particular\r\ncircumstances and limitations regarding the complainant's wife.  The trial court may\r\nhave reasonably accepted the State's expressed concern about venire member\r\nWinfield's potential bias against an indispensable witness for the State.  We conclude\r\nthat the trial court's decision to deny appellant's Batson challenge was not clearly\r\nerroneous. \r\n\r\n\tAppellant also made a Batson challenge to the State's decision to strike venire\r\nmember Ellis, arguing that she was struck because she is African-American.  The\r\nState argues that it struck Ellis because she is a Children's Protective Services\r\n(\"CPS\") worker and expressed the view that rehabilitation is more important than\r\npunishment when fashioning a response to perpetrators of violent crime.  \r\n\r\n\tDuring the voir dire examination, the following exchange took place between\r\nthe State and venire member Ellis:\r\n\r\n\t[State]:\tAs far as punishment, we're back in your kingdom.  You're\r\nthe one that is making the law.  And the question for you,\r\nin a violent crime, a capital murder kind of crime, you're\r\nthe one making the law and you get to tell a jury, well, in\r\nmy kingdom, the crime of capital murder, punishment is\r\nmore important or rehabilitation is more important.  So,\r\nyou're going to decide in a violent crime like capital\r\nmurder, murder, aggravated robbery, something like that,\r\npunishment is more important or rehabilitation is more\r\nimportant.  Okay. So that question to you is going to be\r\npunishment or rehabilitation.  I'm going to ask everybody. \r\nOkay.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t[Ellis]: \tRehab.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the voir dire examination was completed, appellant made his Batson challenge\r\nto the State's decision to strike Ellis.  The State gave the following explanation for\r\nits decision to strike Ellis before the trial court:\r\n\r\n\t[ State]:\tShe's a CPS person.  So, that's why she was struck.  Also\r\nshe is a rehabilitation person and I only--that was\r\nrehabilitation--that was struck by the State.  There are a\r\ncouple, four or five, that are kind of wavering about your\r\ninstructions.  If I could correct the record, Juror No. 33\r\nappeared to be a black female. I did not strike her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\t[Appellant]\tI'm having a hard time accepting that the State is not going\r\nto put people on the jury because they work for Child\r\nProtective Services.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t[State]:\tI've got protective--they are wonderful but they are soft on\r\npeople that are on trial for crimes.  I've just dealt with too\r\nmany of them.  Same with juvenile probation officers.  I\r\nthink they're great on their job, but I wouldn't want them\r\non a jury.\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t. . . .\r\n\r\n\tThe trial court accepted the State's race-neutral explanation and denied\r\nappellant's Batson challenge.  Here, the trial court may have reasonably accepted the\r\nState's expressed concern that, because appellant was a juvenile at the time of the\r\noffense, venire member Ellis might have shown a predisposition against convicting\r\nappellant due to her occupation and her stated views.  Therefore, we conclude that the\r\ntrial court's decision to deny appellant's Batson challenge was not clearly erroneous. \r\n\r\n\tWe overrule appellant's first point of error.Hearsay and the Confrontation Clause\r\n\r\n\tIn his second point of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in\r\nallowing the jury to consider inadmissible hearsay testimony from Detective Widner\r\nin violation of appellant's Sixth Amendment confrontation rights. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tStandard of Review\r\n\r\n\tWe review the trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence under an\r\nabuse of discretion standard.  Torres v. State, 71 S.W.3d 758, 760 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n2002) (citing Burden v. State, 55 S.W.3d 608, 615 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001)).  This\r\nCourt will not reverse the trial court's ruling unless that ruling falls outside the \"zone\r\nof reasonable disagreement.\"  Id.  We do not conduct a de novo review of the trial's\r\ncourt decision.  Coffin v. State, 885 S.W.2d 140, 149 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994).  Our\r\nrole is confined to merely determining whether the record supports the trial court's\r\nruling.  Id. \t\r\n\r\n\tAnalysis\r\n\r\n\tThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to confront\r\n\"the witnesses against him.\"  U.S. Const. amend. VI.  The Sixth Amendment\r\nprotection extends to out-of-court statements used as evidence against the accused.\r\nCrawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 51, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 1364 (2004).  Out-of-court statements deemed as \"testimonial\" in effect and nature are impermissible as\r\nevidence against the accused. (3)  Id.  Out-of-court statements taken by police officers\r\nin the course of interrogations are generally deemed \"testimonial\" under Sixth\r\nAmendment Confrontation Clause standards. (4)  Id.; see also Davis v. Washington,\r\n547 U.S. 813, 822, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 2273-74 (2006) (defining statements as\r\ntestimonial when \"the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such\r\nongoing emergency and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish\r\nor prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecutions\").  \r\n\r\n\tHere, appellant argues that Detective Widner's testimony during both the\r\npretrial identification hearing and the subsequent trial on the merits was based on\r\nsuspect out-of-court Cambodian language interpretation performed by the\r\ncomplainant's daughter and was therefore inadmissible hearsay. \r\n\r\n\tHearsay\r\n\r\n\tDetective Widner interviewed Meach on three occasions to get an\r\nidentification of the complainant's assailant.  He interviewed her at the crime scene\r\non August 13, 2005, at the Houston Police Department on August 16, 2005, and at\r\nMeach's home on August 17, 2005.  At each interview, Widner showed Meach photo\r\narrays of potential suspects.  At each interview, Meach required a translator\r\nacquainted with the Cambodian language.  Meach's relatives translated at the first\r\ninterview and a Cambodian translator employed by the Houston Police Department\r\ntranslated at the second interview.\r\n\r\n\tPrior to the third interview, on August 17, 2005, Widner called Meach's\r\nresidence to confirm the meeting with the complainant and Nimol In.  Nimol In acted\r\nas interpreter for Meach during the interview, which was held in Meach's residence. \r\nWidner testified that, during the interview, he asked Nimol In the questions in\r\nEnglish.  Nimol In then translated the questions into Cambodian.  Meach responded\r\nin Cambodian, and Nimol In translated the responses into English.  Widner admitted\r\nthat he did not speak Cambodian and did not know whether Nimol In translated the\r\nquestions to Meach in the manner Widner asked them.  During this interview,\r\nWidner showed Meach and Nimol In a photo array of six potential suspects and\r\nNimol In told Widner that Meach had identified appellant as the assailant.  Based on\r\nNimol In's translation of Meach's responses and Meach's tapping appellant's photo,\r\nWidner circled the photo of appellant.  Meach then initialed appellant's photo to\r\ncertify the identification.\tAppellant argues that Meach's out-of-court identification of appellant was\r\nhearsay.  The Texas Rules of Evidence generally prohibit out-of-court statements\r\noffered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, or \"hearsay.\"  See Tex. R. Evid.\r\n801, 802.  However, a statement is not deemed hearsay if the statement involves\r\nidentification of a person perceived by the declarant and the declarant later testifies\r\nat a trial or hearing and becomes available for cross-examination concerning the\r\nstatement.  See Tex. R. Evid. 801(e)(1)(C).  Here, Meach testified at trial.  Thus,\r\nMeach's out-of-court identification of appellant was not hearsay in itself.  See Tex.\r\nR. Evid. 801(e)(1)(C) (deeming out-of-court identification of person perceived by\r\ndeclarant who later testifies at trial not to be hearsay).\r\n\r\n\tTranslated Statements\r\n\r\n\tAppellant contends, however, that because of Widner's uncertainty regarding\r\nNimol In's translations and Nimol In's filial proximity to the complainant, Widner's\r\ntestimony was based on Nimol In's statements regarding the identification, rather\r\nthan Meach's, and Widner's testimony is, for that reason, hearsay.  Translated\r\nstatements are admissible as long as the statements qualify under a hearsay rule\r\nexception and the interpreter has no motive to mislead, distort, or make an inaccurate\r\ntranslation.  Cassidy v. State, 149 S.W.3d 712, 715 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).  \r\n\r\n\tThis Court has outlined a four-factor test to determine whether an interpreter\r\nfor a party associated with litigation or prosecution is either a mere \"language\r\nconduit\" for the party or, as appellant alleges, a declarant of an out-of-court\r\nstatement within the meaning of the hearsay rule in the Texas Rules of Evidence.\r\nGomez v. State, 49 S.W.3d 456, 459 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet.\r\nref'd) (citing United States v. Nazemian, 948 F.2d 522, 527 (9th Cir. 1991)).  First,\r\nwe determine which party supplied the interpreter.  Id.  Second, we determine\r\nwhether the interpreter had any motive to mislead or distort.  Id.  Third, we assess\r\nthe interpreter's qualifications and language skills.  Id.  Finally, we determine\r\nwhether actions taken subsequent to the conversation were consistent with the\r\nstatements as translated.  Id. \r\n\r\n\tFirst, the interpreter, Nimol In, was not supplied by any party.  Rather she was\r\navailable to translate because she was at Meach's residence at the time of the third\r\ninterview, just as Meach's relatives had translated at the crime scene.  Although, the\r\nsecond interview on August 16, 2005  was taken at the Houston Police Department\r\nwith a Cambodian translator employed by the Houston Police Department.  The\r\npolice thus had access to competent Cambodian translators who could serve a\r\n\"language conduit\" function.  However, no evidence in the record suggests that the\r\npolice believed a police department translator was necessary for an interview at\r\nMeach's residence. \r\n\r\n\tSecond, we have not found any record evidence to show that Nimol In had a\r\nmotive to mislead or distort either Widner's questions or her mother's replies in the\r\nthird police interview.  Rather, Widner's circling appellant's photograph and\r\nMeach's tapping on the photograph and initialing of the photograph in response to\r\nthe translated questions are evidence that Nimol In accurately translated Widner's\r\nquestions to her mother asking her whether she could identify the person who\r\nstabbed the complainant at the donut shop.\r\n\r\n\tThird, there is no evidence that Nimol In's qualifications and language skills\r\nin communicating in both English and Cambodian were insufficient for her to\r\ntranslate accurately for Meach.  Nimol In grew up in this country and presumably\r\nfluent in both English and the Cambodian dialect she learned from Meach herself. \r\nShe demonstrated her language abilities during the first interview between Meach\r\nand Widner on August 13, 2005, as well as in the third interview.  \r\n\r\n\tFourth, in response to the statements translated by Nimol In,, Meach identified\r\nappellant by tapping his photo in the array Widner had brought to the third interview,\r\nindicating that she understood Widner's identification request.  Appellant was later\r\ndetained and tried.  Meach testified at the trial, where she was subject to cross-examination.  She repeated her identification of appellant, again through an\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\r\n\tBalancing all the Gomez factors, we hold that Nimol In served as a mere\r\nlanguage conduit for Meach.  We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion\r\nwhen it admitted Widner's testimony for use at the pretrial identification hearing and\r\nat the trial on the merits. (5)  \r\n\r\n\tHarmless Error\t\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if the trial court had erred in admitting Widner's testimony, however, the error\r\n\r\nwould have been harmless.  See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(a). (6)  \r\n\r\n\tWhen a witness's ability to make an in-court identification has an origin\r\nindependent of an alleged improper pre-trial identification procedure, such testimony\r\nis admissible at trial.  Waller v. State, 648 S.W.2d 308, 312 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983). \r\n\r\nHere, the State produced significant identification evidence independent of Widner's\r\ntestimony.  The complainant's wife, Meach, identified appellant at the pretrial\r\nidentification hearing  and at the trial on the merits through a court-appointed\r\ninterpreter.  The State presented Darrell Wiltz who testified that he saw appellant\r\ncoming through a hole in a fence adjacent to the crime scene on the night the\r\ncomplainant was killed.  Appellant was panting and sweating heavily when Wiltz\r\nwalked toward appellant to talk with him.  Appellant told Wiltz that appellant needed\r\nto discard the blue shirt that he was wearing.  Wiltz testified that when he asked\r\nappellant why he needed to discard the shirt, appellant responded by asking Wiltz\r\nif he \"knew the donut man,\" an apparent reference to the complainant.  When Wiltz\r\ntold appellant that he did know the \"donut man,\" appellant told Wiltz that appellant\r\nhad \"done him in.\"  The State also produced Jeffrey Lyons, a classmate of\r\nappellant's at Channelview High School in Channelview, Texas.  Lyons testified that\r\nhe asked appellant about the stabbing at the complainant's donut shop and that\r\nappellant told Lyons he had stabbed complainant sixteen times.  \r\n\r\n\tGiven the volume of identification evidence with origins independent from the\r\npre-trial identification procedure, Widner's testimony regarding Meach's out-of-court identification of appellant from the photo array was merely cumulative and had\r\nno substantial effect on the identification of appellant as the complainant's assailant. \r\nWaller, 648 S.W.2d at312.  It was not harmful error.  See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(a). \r\n\r\n\tWe overrule appellant's second point of error.\r\n\r\nTexas Evidence Rule 403\r\n\r\n\tIn his third point of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in\r\nadmitting prejudicial photographic evidence in violation of Rule 403 of the Texas\r\nRules of Evidence.\r\n\r\n\tStandard of Review\r\n\r\n\tWe review a trial court's decision to admit evidence under Rule 403 under a\r\nclear abuse of discretion standard.  Rachal v. State, 917 S.W.2d 799, 808 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. 1996) (citing Montgomery v. State, 810 S.W.2d 372, 392 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n1990)).  A trial judge has broad discretion in admitting or excluding evidence. \r\nMozon v. State, 991 S.W.2d 841, 846 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).  Under Rule 403, trial\r\ncourts should favor admission in close cases.  Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 389. \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tAnalysis\r\n\r\n\tTexas Evidence Rule 403 allows a trial court to exclude relevant evidence \"if\r\nits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\" \r\nSee Tex. R. Evid. 403.  In determining whether the danger of unfair prejudice\r\nsubstantially outweighs the probative value of photographs, several factors may be\r\nconsidered, such as the number of photographs, the detail and size of the\r\nphotographs, whether the photographs are in black and white or in color, whether the\r\nphotographs  are close-ups, the availability of other means of proof, and the unique\r\ncircumstances of each case.  Sonnier v. State, 913 S.W.2d 511, 518 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n1995).  A presumption that the evidence has probative value affects the balancing\r\nanalysis.  Goldberg v. State, 95 S.W.3d 345, 366 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st Dist.]\r\n2002, pet. ref'd).  Any decision regarding the admissibility of photographs is made\r\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial judge.  Sonnier, 913 S.W.2d at 518 (citing\r\nJones v. State, 843 S.W.2d 487, 500 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992)); Williams v. State, 958\r\nS.W.2d 186, 195 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997.\r\n\r\n\tThe trial court may admit photographs that depict what was included in the\r\ntestimony of various witnesses as long as the photographs have not been manipulated\r\nand are not used to inflame or mislead the jury.  See Sonnier, 913 S.W.2d at 519\r\n(holding that four photographs showing victims' bodies lying in bloodied water were\r\nincluded in witnesses' testimonial depictions and, therefore, could be admitted).\r\nCrime scene photographs are just as relevant as verbal testimony by aiding the jury\r\nin determining the manner and means of the death of the victim, the force used, the\r\nlength of time the victim had been dead, and sometimes even the identity of the\r\nperpetrator.  Williams, 958 S.W.2d at 195.  Crime scene photos are helpful to the jury\r\nby providing a visual context for witnesses' testimony in describing the crime scene\r\nand may be admitted.  See Frank v. State, 183 S.W.3d 63, 78 (Tex. App.--Fort\r\nWorth 2005, pet. ref'd).  When photographs depict nothing more than the reality of\r\nthe crime the defendant has committed, the reality of the offense serves as\r\n\"powerful\" visual evidence which is more probative than prejudicial.  Chamberlain,\r\n998 S.W.2d 230, 236-37 (holding that closeup of victim's face with exposed brain\r\nmatter was more probative than prejudicial).  A trial court does not abuse its\r\ndiscretion merely because it admits into evidence photographs that are gruesome. \r\nSee Sonnier, 913 S.W.2d at 519.  \r\n\r\n\tAppellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting nine photographs that\r\nare merely cumulative and gratuitous images of gore that are substantially more\r\nprejudicial than probative.  Each photo admitted by the trial court depicts the wounds\r\ninflicted on the complainant's body alongside forensic equipment used to measure\r\nand locate those wounds.  The photos show various body parts of the complainant's\r\nbody, each part highlighted to show the depth and length of the particular wound. \r\nThe photos are graphic, intense and fully depict the gravity of the offense suffered\r\nby the complainant.  But, the photos are clinical rather than gratuitous.  Because each\r\nphoto measures a different body part, there is no cumulative effect when viewing the\r\nphotos as a complete series.  The photos merely depict the result of appellant's\r\nactions.  We conclude that the trial court's decision to admit these photos was within\r\nits sound discretion. \r\n\r\n\tWe overrule appellant's third point of error.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\tWe affirm the trial court's judgment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t           Evelyn V.

The definition of \"testimonial\" out-of-court statements in Crawford is notably\r\nimprecise by the Supreme Court's own admission.  Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S.\r\n36, 51, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 1364 (2004).  Generally a \"testimonial\" out-of-court\r\nstatement is defined as an ex parte statement made under circumstances that would\r\nlead the declarant or any objective witness to reasonably anticipate that the statement\r\nwould be used in the prosecution of the accused.  Id.\r\n4. The Court uses the term \"interrogation\" in a \"colloquial rather than any technical legal\r\nsense.\"  Crawford, 541 U.S. at 53, n.4, 124 S. Ct. at 1365 n.4. \r\n5. Appellant also argues that the trial court erred in allowing the use of uncertified\r\nCambodian translators when a certified translator was available. Appellant argues that\r\nsuch uncertified translators create a hearsay circumstance in violation of the Sixth\r\nAmendment.  Here, appellant's complaint is not preserved because appellant did not\r\nobject to the use of the court-appointed Cambodian translators.  See Tex. R. App. P.\r\n33.1.\r\n6. Rule 44.2(a) states, \"If the appellate record in a criminal case reveals constitutional\r\nerror that is subject to harmless error review, the court of appeals must reverse a\r\njudgment of conviction or punishment unless the court determines beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the conviction or punishment.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n",
