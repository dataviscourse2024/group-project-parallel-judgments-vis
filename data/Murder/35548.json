A jury convicted Peter Whyte of\nsecond-degree intentional homicide for killing his girlfriend.\nIn this appeal from the denial of his habeas corpus petition\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, Whyte argues his constitutional rights\nwere violated when, at trial, he was required to wear a stun\nbelt in front of the jury. He also presses related ineffective as-\nsistance of counsel allegations. Because Whyte\u2019s claims are\n\f2                                                            No. 21-1268\n\nprocedurally defaulted under adequate and independent\nstate grounds, federal review is foreclosed, and we affirm the\ndistrict court.\n                                     I\n                                    A\n    In August 2006, Whyte and his girlfriend, Suzanne\nWeiland, returned to their cabin in St. Croix County, Wiscon-\nsin after a night of drinking. Whyte declined Weiland\u2019s sexual\nadvances and the couple began to quarrel. Enraged, Weiland\nlunged at Whyte with a knife, stabbing him in the chest.\nWhyte fell to the \ufb02oor but was able to pull himself back up.\nThen Weiland attacked again, stabbing Whyte in his stomach.\nWhyte knocked Weiland back and pulled out the knife.\nArmed with a second knife, Weiland again charged at Whyte.\nThis time, Whyte grabbed Weiland by the hand and stabbed\nher twice in the back with the knife he had removed from his\nstomach. The couple fell to the \ufb02oor while attacking each\nother. Whyte continued to stab Weiland until she stopped\nstruggling. Whyte passed out, and when he woke up,\nWeiland was dead beside him.\n    Weiland received nineteen total stab wounds, including\nthree to her neck severe enough to have caused her death\nwithin minutes. Whyte was stabbed eight to ten times. The\nphysician who performed Weiland\u2019s autopsy testi\ufb01ed that she\ndied with a 0.31 blood alcohol concentration. 1 Weiland, \ufb01ve\nfeet, seven inches in height and weighing 150 pounds, was\n\n    1That is, .31 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. In compari-\nson, Wisconsin\u2019s legal limit for driving a motor vehicle is a blood alcohol\nconcentration of .08. The record is unclear as to Whyte\u2019s blood alcohol con-\ncentration at the time.\n\fNo. 21-1268                                                    3\n\nnotably smaller than Whyte, who measured six feet, four\ninches and weighed 283 pounds.\n   Whyte was charged with \ufb01rst-degree intentional homi-\ncide. At trial, Whyte did not dispute that he killed Weiland,\nbut raised self-defense\u2014that he reasonably believed he was\nusing the force necessary to prevent imminent death or great\nbodily harm to himself.\n    During trial Whyte was required to wear a stun belt, \u201cused\nto restrain prisoners, often in courtrooms where a prisoner\nwho acts up can frighten and even injure jurors, the judge, the\nlawyers, and spectators.\u201d Stephenson v. Neal, 865 F.3d 956, 958\n(7th Cir. 2017). When used in court, \u201can o\ufb03cer is authorized\nto send an electric shock to a box on the stun belt that contains\nelectrical wires, should the prisoner become violent or other-\nwise disrupt the proceeding; the shock disables the prisoner\nfrom acting up.\u201d Id. The judge preapproved a request from\nthe sheri\ufb00\u2019s o\ufb03ce for Whyte to wear the stun belt at trial. The\nsheri\ufb00\u2019s o\ufb03ce requested the device \u201cout of an abundance of\ncaution,\u201d and while the judge admitted that Whyte had \u201cbeen\n\ufb01ne,\u201d he nevertheless ordered Whyte to wear the belt because\nWhyte was \u201ca large man\u201d who \u201cmay be an emotional person.\u201d\n    Although the judge and the parties\u2019 counsel believed\nWhyte would wear the stun belt under his clothes so the jury\nwould not see it, Whyte ultimately had to wear the belt over\nhis dress shirt. Throughout the trial, Whyte\u2019s counsel tried to\nconceal the belt by standing in front of the jury whenever\nWhyte entered the courtroom. The parties dispute whether\nthe jury ever saw the stun belt or understood the nature of the\ndevice, and the record is silent on both points. But they do not\ndisagree that the belt interfered with Whyte\u2019s ability to ex-\nplain the events surrounding Weiland\u2019s death. When Whyte\n\f4                                                   No. 21-1268\n\ntook the stand to testify, he declined to reenact the altercation\nwith Weiland for fear the jury would see the device and draw\nnegative inferences. Whyte also claims the belt had a chilling\ne\ufb00ect on his testimony, rendering his account of the incident\n\u201cstilted\u201d and \u201cemotionless,\u201d a point the State underscored in\nits closing argument. Despite these limitations, Whyte\u2019s trial\ncounsel did not object to the stun belt\u2019s use.\n    The jury was instructed on the elements of both \ufb01rst- and\nsecond-degree intentional homicide. For the latter charge, the\njury was informed that Whyte would be guilty \u201cif [he] caused\nthe death of Suzanne Weiland with the intent to kill, and ac-\ntually believed the force used was necessary to prevent immi-\nnent death or great bodily harm to himself, but his belief was\nunreasonable.\u201d The jury found Whyte guilty of second-degree\nintentional homicide, and he was sentenced to forty years of\nincarceration followed by twenty years of extended supervi-\nsion.\n    Whyte appealed his conviction and his counsel raised a\nsingle issue\u2014that the admission into evidence of Weiland\u2019s\nstatements about her relationship with Whyte violated the\nSixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. The Wisconsin\nCourt of Appeals disagreed, holding that \u201cthe error, if any, in\nadmitting the challenged testimony was harmless\u201d and that\n\u201c[n]one of the challenged statements bear on the jury\u2019s deter-\nmination whether the amount of force used was reasonable.\u201d\nWhyte\u2019s petition to the Wisconsin Supreme Court to review\nthat decision was denied.\n                               B\n   Following his losses on direct appeal, Whyte, representing\nhimself, petitioned the district court for relief under 28 U.S.C.\n\fNo. 21-1268                                                                   5\n\n\u00a7 2254. Because Whyte had not exhausted his available state\nremedies, the court held his petition in abeyance and stayed\nthe proceedings.\n    Postconviction Proceedings. Whyte turned back to the state\ntrial court and, still acting pro se, moved for postconviction\nrelief under WIS. STAT. \u00a7 974.06 as well as to modify his sen-\ntence. In his motions, Whyte raised several new claims he had\nnot pursued on direct appeal or in a \u00a7 974.02 motion 2, includ-\ning a due process claim premised on the stun belt, ine\ufb00ective\nassistance of trial counsel for failing to object to the stun belt,\nand ine\ufb00ective assistance of postconviction counsel for ne-\nglecting to raise those claims. 3 The state trial court denied\n\n\n    2 \u201cIn Wisconsin\u2019s postconviction process, an offender\u2019s initial step in\nchallenging a sentence is a postconviction motion filed under WIS. STAT.\n\u00a7 974.02, which allows the trial court the first opportunity to consider cer-\ntain challenges.\u201d Minnick v. Winkleski, 15 F.4th 460, 465 n.3 (7th Cir. 2021).\n    3  Whyte\u2019s counsel after trial is variously referred to as \u201cpostconviction\ncounsel,\u201d \u201cappellate counsel,\u201d or a combination of both. But there is a dif-\nference between these two functions. Under Wisconsin law, a claim for\nineffective assistance of postconviction counsel alleges deficient represen-\ntation in the state trial court, and such claims are to be raised in that court.\nState ex rel. Warren v. Meisner, 944 N.W.2d 588, 593, 595 (Wis. 2020). In con-\ntrast, a claim for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel concerns that\nattorney\u2019s performance in the state appellate court, and those claims\nshould be brought in a habeas petition in that court. Id. at 592, 595.\n     Here, Whyte\u2019s pro se \u00a7 974.06 motion alleged that \u201cpost-conviction\ncounsel unreasonably failed \u2026 to identify and raise the substantive and\ntrial ineffectiveness claims identified in this motion.\u201d Because the Wiscon-\nsin Supreme Court has treated similar pleadings as claims for ineffective\nassistance of postconviction counsel, and because the Wisconsin Court of\nAppeals addressed Whyte\u2019s claim without requiring him to first raise it in\na state habeas proceeding, we refer to Whyte\u2019s argument as a claim for\nineffective assistance of postconviction counsel. Id. at 596\u201397 (construing\n\f6                                                             No. 21-1268\n\nWhyte\u2019s motions without a hearing, \ufb01nding that his claims ei-\nther lacked merit or were procedurally barred by State v. Es-\ncalona-Naranjo, 517 N.W.2d 157 (Wis. 1994), because Whyte\ndid \u201cnot rais[e] the majority of his issues in his direct appeal.\u201d\n    Whyte appealed the state trial court\u2019s denial of his post-\nconviction motions. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals af-\n\ufb01rmed, concluding that WIS. STAT. \u00a7 974.06(4) and Escalona-\nNaranjo\u2014which require litigants to initially raise claims for\npostconviction relief in a \u00a7 974.02 motion or on direct ap-\npeal\u2014precluded Whyte\u2019s motions. Whyte argued he fell\nwithin an exception to this rule, which allows defendants to\nraise new constitutional challenges if they can show \u201csu\ufb03-\ncient reason\u201d for not asserting the issue earlier. His ine\ufb00ective\nassistance of trial counsel and stun belt claims fell within this\nexception, Whyte reasoned, because his postconviction coun-\nsel was ine\ufb00ective by not raising these issues, thus constitut-\ning a \u201csu\ufb03cient reason\u201d for his tardiness.\n    But the state appellate court decided that Whyte\u2019s claim\nfor ine\ufb00ective assistance of postconviction counsel was itself\nprocedurally defaulted because Whyte\u2019s pleadings on that is-\nsue were inadequate. Under State v. Allen, a defendant\u2019s mo-\ntion must \u201craise facts su\ufb03cient to entitle the movant to relief\u201d\nrather than \u201cconclusory allegations.\u201d 682 N.W.2d 433, 437\n(Wis. 2004). In his postconviction motion, Whyte stated that,\n\u201c[a]t a hearing, the defendant will establish that post-convic-\ntion counsel\u2019s de\ufb01cient performance prejudiced him.\u201d\n\n\npetitioner\u2019s claim \u201cthat his counsel after conviction \u2018was ineffective for not\nraising a claim for the ineffective assistance of trial counsel\u2019\u201d as a \u201cclaim\nthat postconviction counsel was ineffective\u201d).\n\fNo. 21-1268                                                    7\n\nBecause Whyte\u2019s pleading contained \u201conly conclusory and le-\ngally insu\ufb03cient allegations that postconviction counsel was\nine\ufb00ective,\u201d the court determined that Whyte\u2019s postconvic-\ntion counsel claim was barred by Allen\u2019s pleading standards.\nAnd since that claim failed, Whyte was left without a \u201csu\ufb03-\ncient reason\u201d to evade Escalona-Naranjo\u2019s procedural bar on\nhis claims for the stun belt and ine\ufb00ective assistance of trial\ncounsel.\n    In addition to its procedural holding, the state appellate\ncourt addressed the merits of Whyte\u2019s claims. Whyte argued\nhis trial counsel was ine\ufb00ective for, among other things,\n\u201cfail[ing] to object to the visibility of the stun belt,\u201d but the\ncourt disagreed, concluding that Whyte failed to show preju-\ndice under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).\n\u201c[T]here was overwhelming evidence of Whyte\u2019s guilt,\u201d the\ncourt reasoned, \u201cincluding the size disparity between Whyte\nand the victim; the victim\u2019s intoxication; and the sheer num-\nber of stab wounds the victim su\ufb00ered, many of which could\nhave been independently fatal.\u201d The court continued: \u201cIn\nlight of the overwhelming evidence of Whyte\u2019s guilt, trial\ncounsel\u2019s alleged de\ufb01ciencies\u2014either individually or collec-\ntively\u2014do not undermine our con\ufb01dence in the outcome at\ntrial.\u201d Because Whyte\u2019s challenge to the e\ufb00ectiveness of trial\ncounsel lacked merit, the court further concluded that\n\u201cWhyte\u2019s derivative challenge to the e\ufb00ectiveness of his post-\nconviction counsel likewise fails.\u201d Whyte appealed the state\nappeals court\u2019s decision, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court\ndenied his petition for review.\n    Habeas Proceedings. Back in federal court, Whyte amended\nhis \u00a7 2254 petition and the district court lifted the stay on the\n\f8                                                             No. 21-1268\n\nproceedings. 4 Whyte raised three issues\u2014the visibility of the\nstun belt and its e\ufb00ect on the trial proceedings, his trial coun-\nsel\u2019s failure to object to the device, and his postconviction\ncounsel\u2019s failure to raise those claims.\n    The district court rejected each of Whyte\u2019s claims and de-\nnied his habeas petition. Citing Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62,\n67\u201368 (1991), the court highlighted that \u201c[h]abeas relief is\navailable only for state court decisions that are contrary to fed-\neral law,\u201d and that federal courts \u201cmay not review whether a\nstate court properly applied its own state laws.\u201d Applying\nthis rule, the district court held that Whyte was not entitled to\nfederal habeas relief for his stun belt claim because the state\ncourt dismissed it under WIS. STAT. \u00a7 974.06(4) and Escalona-\nNaranjo, which constitute adequate and independent state\nprocedural grounds foreclosing federal review. Whyte\u2019s\nclaim of ine\ufb00ective assistance of trial counsel fared no better.\nThe state appellate court resolved that issue under the same\nstate procedural rules, although the district court chose to af-\n\ufb01rm the state appellate court\u2019s decision under a traditional\nStrickland analysis, concluding that Whyte had not shown\nprejudice stemming from his trial counsel\u2019s performance. On\nWhyte\u2019s claim that his postconviction counsel was constitu-\ntionally de\ufb01cient, the district court reasoned that this issue\nwas also barred from federal review because the state court\n\n    4 Following the failed postconviction motion, and before he amended\nhis federal habeas petition, Whyte filed a pro se petition for a writ of ha-\nbeas corpus in state court. Whyte\u2019s state habeas petition did not raise the\nstun belt or related challenges to his trial and postconviction counsel\u2019s per-\nformances, focusing instead on unrelated ineffective assistance of postcon-\nviction counsel issues that are not before us. The Wisconsin Court of Ap-\npeals denied Whyte\u2019s petition, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court again\ndenied review.\n\fNo. 21-1268                                                      9\n\nhad ruled that this claim was insu\ufb03ciently pleaded under Al-\nlen\u2014another adequate and independent state procedural\nrule.\n     Whyte now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2254\npetition. He challenges the constitutionality of the stun belt\u2019s\nuse and raises related claims of ine\ufb00ective assistance of coun-\nsel.\n                                II\n    We begin with procedural default. \u201c[A] federal court may\nnot review federal claims that were procedurally defaulted in\nstate court\u2014that is, claims that the state court denied based\non an adequate and independent state procedural rule.\u201d\nDavila v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 2058, 2064 (2017). \u201cMerits review of\na habeas claim is foreclosed if the relevant state court\u2019s dispo-\nsition of the claim rests on a state law ground that is adequate\nand independent of the merits of the federal claim.\u201d Triplett v.\nMcDermott, 996 F.3d 825, 829 (7th Cir. 2021). \u201cUnless the peti-\ntioner can establish \u2018cause\u2019 for and \u2018prejudice\u2019 from the de-\nfault, \u2018federal habeas review is at an end.\u2019\u201d Garcia, 28 F.4th 764,\n771 (7th Cir. 2022) (quoting Johnson v. Thurmer, 624 F.3d 786,\n789 (7th Cir. 2010)). \u201cWe review questions of procedural de-\nfault de novo.\u201d Id.\n    In Escalona-Naranjo, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin held\nthat a defendant forfeits the right to raise a constitutional is-\nsue in a WIS. STAT. \u00a7 974.06 postconviction motion \u201cthat could\nhave been raised on direct appeal or in a sec. 974.02 motion.\u201d\n517 N.W.2d at 164 (emphasis omitted); see Matthew M. Fern-\nholz, Collateral Damage: A Guide to Criminal Appellate, Postcon-\nviction, and Habeas Corpus Litigation in Wisconsin, 98 MARQ. L.\nREV. 1351, 1355\u201357 (2015) (discussing Escalona-Naranjo\u2019s\n\f10                                                  No. 21-1268\n\nanalysis of \u00a7 974.06). In other words, \u201ca defendant must raise\nall available claims for relief, including Strickland claims, at\nthe earliest opportunity,\u201d or else such claims are procedurally\ndefaulted. Garcia, 28 F.4th at 772 (citing Escalona-Naranjo, 517\nN.W.2d at 162). But procedural default may be excused if the\ndefendant can show a \u201csu\ufb03cient reason\u201d for not raising the\nissue earlier. Escalona-Naranjo, 517 N.W.2d at 162 (quoting\nWIS. STAT. \u00a7 974.06(4)). This court has held that Escalona-Na-\nranjo\u2019s bar constitutes an adequate and independent state pro-\ncedural ground, which forecloses federal review. Garcia, 28\nF.4th at 767; Perry v. McCaughtry, 308 F.3d 682, 690, 692 (7th\nCir. 2002).\n    With this framework in mind, we ask whether Whyte\u2019s\npresent claims were barred by the Wisconsin Court of Ap-\npeals on adequate and independent procedural grounds. If\nso, we must assess whether Whyte has shown \u201ccause\u201d for and\n\u201cprejudice\u201d from the default. Without such a showing, federal\nhabeas review is precluded.\n    On the \ufb01rst question, it is undisputed that Whyte failed to\nchallenge the stun belt or the e\ufb00ectiveness of his trial counsel,\neither on direct appeal or in a \u00a7 974.02 motion. His only argu-\nment on direct appeal alleged that admitting Weiland\u2019s state-\nments violated the Confrontation Clause, a claim Whyte\nabandoned in the district court. Not until Whyte\u2019s motion for\npostconviction relief under \u00a7 974.06(4) did he dispute the re-\nquirement that he wear a stun belt at trial and raise the related\nclaim of ine\ufb00ective assistance of counsel. For this reason, the\nWisconsin Court of Appeals ruled that \u201cthe claims raised in\nWhyte\u2019s WIS. STAT. \u00a7 974.06 motion, and repeated in his mo-\ntion for sentence modi\ufb01cation, are barred by WIS. STAT.\n\u00a7 974.06(4) and State v. Escalona-Naranjo.\u201d\n\fNo. 21-1268                                                    11\n\n    Nevertheless, Whyte attempts to show \u201ccause\u201d for and\n\u201cprejudice\u201d from this procedural default by arguing his post-\nconviction counsel was constitutionally defective for failing to\nraise the stun belt and ine\ufb00ective assistance claims. As the\nSupreme Court has held, \u201cine\ufb00ective assistance adequate to\nestablish cause for the procedural default of some other con-\nstitutional claim is itself an independent constitutional claim,\u201d\nwhich \u201crequire[s] that constitutional claim, like others, to be\n\ufb01rst raised in state court.\u201d Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446,\n451\u201352 (2000). \u201cIn other words, the claim of ine\ufb00ective assis-\ntance must be raised in state court before it can su\ufb03ce on fed-\neral habeas relief as \u2018cause\u2019 to excuse the default of another\nclaim (even if that other claim is also ine\ufb00ective assistance of\ncounsel).\u201d Dellinger v. Bowen, 301 F.3d 758, 766 (7th Cir. 2002).\n\u201cIf the second claim of ine\ufb00ective assistance of counsel is itself\ndefaulted, the petitioner will be fully defaulted.\u201d Id.; see Gar-\ncia, 28 F.4th at 775 n.3. Thus, de\ufb01cient performance by\nWhyte\u2019s postconviction counsel can serve as a basis to avoid\nprocedural default only if that claim is itself not defaulted.\n    Whyte did raise the ineffective assistance of postconvic-\ntion counsel issue in his \u00a7 974.06 motion. He argued that his\npostconviction counsel\u2019s failure to assert claims as to the stun\nbelt and the ineffectiveness of trial counsel were a \u201csufficient\nreason\u201d under Escalona-Naranjo to excuse defaulting on those\nclaims. But the state appellate court held that state procedural\nrules barred Whyte\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of post-\nconviction counsel. To understand the state court\u2019s reasoning,\nan explanation of Wisconsin\u2019s pleading standards is useful.\n    The Supreme Court of Wisconsin has ruled that \u201cine\ufb00ec-\ntiveness of postconviction counsel may be a su\ufb03cient reason\nfor failing to raise an available claim in an earlier motion or\n\f12                                                    No. 21-1268\n\non direct appeal.\u201d State v. Romero-Georgana, 849 N.W.2d 668,\n678 (Wis. 2014). But in State v. Allen, the Court emphasized\nthat \u201ca postconviction motion for relief requires more than\nconclusory allegations.\u201d 682 N.W.2d at 439. Rather, it must\nprovide \u201csu\ufb03cient material facts\u2014e.g., who, what, where,\nwhen, why, and how\u2014that, if true, would entitle [the defend-\nant] to the relief he seeks.\u201d Id. at 446. This procedural require-\nment allows reviewing courts to \u201cmeaningfully assess [the\ndefendant\u2019s] claim.\u201d Id. at 441 (quoting State v. Bentley, 548\nN.W.2d 50, 55 (Wis. 1996)). In contrast, \u201c[t]he mere assertion\nof a claim of manifest injustice, in this case the ine\ufb00ective as-\nsistance of counsel, does not entitle a defendant to the grant-\ning of relief.\u201d Id. at 439 (quoting State v. Washington, 500\nN.W.2d 331, 335 (Wis. Ct. App. 1993)). When a postconviction\nmotion lacks such material facts, the trial court may deny the\nmotion without an evidentiary hearing. Id. at 446. As a result,\n\u201cif the defendant fails to allege why and how his postconvic-\ntion counsel was constitutionally ine\ufb00ective\u2014that is, if the de-\nfendant asserts a mere conclusory allegation that his counsel\nwas ine\ufb00ective\u2014his \u2018reason\u2019 is not su\ufb03cient\u201d to avoid Esca-\nlona\u2013Naranjo\u2019s procedural default. Romero-Georgana, 849\nN.W.2d at 678; see Garcia, 28 F.4th at 773. Allen\u2019s pleading\nstandard is an adequate and independent state procedural\nrule. Triplett, 996 F.3d at 830; Lee v. Foster, 750 F.3d 687, 693\u201394\n(7th Cir. 2014); see also Garcia, 28 F.4th at 767 (stating \u201cRomero-\nGeorgana\u2019s pleading standard\u201d is an \u201cindependent and ade-\nquate state procedural ground[]\u201d).\n    The Wisconsin Court of Appeals held that Whyte\u2019s claim\nof ine\ufb00ective assistance of postconviction counsel did not con-\nstitute a \u201csu\ufb03cient reason\u201d to excuse the procedural default\nunder Escalona-Naranjo because Whyte failed to comply with\nAllen\u2019s pleading standard. For that court, \u201cWhyte \u2026 was\n\fNo. 21-1268                                                     13\n\nrequired to show both de\ufb01cient performance and prejudice\nwithin his WIS. STAT. \u00a7 974.06 motion.\u201d But in his pleadings\nbefore the state trial court on postconviction under \u00a7 974.06,\nWhyte merely declared: \u201cAt a hearing, the defendant will es-\ntablish that post-conviction counsel\u2019s de\ufb01cient performance\nprejudiced him.\u201d The state appellate court decided that\nWhyte in his pleading \u201cfail[ed] to establish prejudice,\u201d citing\nAllen for the proposition that \u201c[m]otions containing only con-\nclusory and legally insu\ufb03cient allegations that postconvic-\ntion counsel was ine\ufb00ective are insu\ufb03cient to circumvent Es-\ncalona-Naranjo\u2019s procedural bar.\u201d\n    Before us, Whyte raises several arguments to avoid proce-\ndural default under Allen. First, he contends the State waived\nany argument that his claim of ine\ufb00ective assistance of post-\nconviction counsel was procedurally defaulted when the State\nfailed to raise the issue in its answer opposing Whyte\u2019s federal\nhabeas petition. Whyte cites Lewis v. Sternes, which states, \u201ca\npetitioner\u2019s procedural default \u2026 is an a\ufb03rmative defense \u2026\nthat the State can waive.\u201d 390 F.3d 1019, 1029 (7th Cir. 2004).\nLewis continues: \u201cOne might infer that the State has implicitly\nwaived a procedural default defense when it has asserted that\ndefense as to some of the petitioner\u2019s claims but not as to the\nparticular claim in question.\u201d Id. While the State in its answer\nraised this defense as to Whyte\u2019s stun belt and ine\ufb00ective as-\nsistance of trial counsel claims, it did not raise that defense for\nthe ine\ufb00ective assistance of postconviction counsel claim.\n   As an initial matter, Whyte does not argue the district\ncourt erred in addressing procedural default under Allen.\nHad Whyte done so, he might have attempted to show preju-\ndice arising from the State belatedly raising the issue. Instead,\n\f14                                                    No. 21-1268\n\nWhyte asserts only that the State waived any defense of pro-\ncedural default under Allen.\n    Yet Whyte has not shown waiver. \u201cSome of our opinions\nuse the terms waiver and forfeiture interchangeably, but \u2026\nwe need to pay attention to the di\ufb00erence.\u201d Reed v. Columbia\nSt. Mary's Hosp., 915 F.3d 473, 478 (7th Cir. 2019). \u201cA defend-\nant\u2019s failure to plead an a\ufb03rmative defense may result in a\nwaiver of the defense if the defendant has relinquished it\nknowingly and intelligently, or forfeiture if the defendant\nmerely failed to preserve the defense by pleading it.\u201d Id.\nWhyte does not show, and the record does not reveal, that the\nState knowingly and intelligently relinquished the right to as-\nsert procedural default with respect to Whyte\u2019s claim of inef-\nfective assistance of postconviction counsel. At most, Whyte\u2019s\nargument suggests the State forfeited this defense.\n    But even forfeiture did not occur here. \u201cWe will generally\n\ufb01nd that the failure to plead an a\ufb03rmative defense in the an-\nswer works a forfeiture \u2018only if the plainti\ufb00 is harmed by the\ndefendant\u2019s delay in asserting it.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Garofalo v. Vil-\nlage of Hazel Crest, 754 F.3d 428, 436 (7th Cir. 2014)); see Curtis\nv. Timberlake, 436 F.3d 709, 711 (7th Cir. 2005) (\u201c[W]e have held\nthat a delay in asserting an a\ufb03rmative defense waives the de-\nfense only if the plainti\ufb00 was harmed as a result.\u201d). As ex-\nplained in Reed, the purpose of requiring parties to plead af-\n\ufb01rmative defenses \u201cis to avoid surprise and undue prejudice\nto the plainti\ufb00 by providing her notice and the opportunity to\ndemonstrate why the defense should not prevail.\u201d 915 F.3d at\n478 (quoting Venters v. City of Delphi, 123 F.3d 956, 967 (7th Cir.\n1997)). \u201cA defendant should not be permitted to \u2018lie behind a\nlog\u2019 and ambush a plainti\ufb00 with an unexpected defense.\u201d Id.\n(quoting Venters, 123 F.3d at 968).\n\fNo. 21-1268                                                  15\n\n    Here, there was no ambush. Since the Wisconsin Court of\nAppeals ruled on Whyte\u2019s postconviction motion, he was\naware that his claim for ineffective assistance of postconvic-\ntion counsel was subject to default under Allen\u2019s procedural\nbar. The district court also cited the State\u2019s brief opposing\nWhyte\u2019s habeas petition, finding that the State had raised pro-\ncedural default as a response to Whyte\u2019s claim of ineffective\nassistance of postconviction counsel. Whyte fails to address\nthis point before us. See Garofalo, 754 F.3d at 436\u201337 (7th Cir.\n2014) (holding that district court did not abuse its discretion\nby allowing the defendant to raise an affirmative defense in\nbriefing). Whyte was thus on notice of Allen\u2019s procedural bar\nand its effect on his claims before the district court, where he\nhad an opportunity to address the issue. Whyte has not\nshown that he is harmed by the State\u2019s failure to plead the\naffirmative defense in its answer, and his ability to raise nu-\nmerous responses to the forfeiture issue on appeal indicates\nhe is not. See Reed, 915 F.3d at 479.\n    Second, Whyte argues the state appellate court resolved\nhis ine\ufb00ective assistance of postconviction counsel claim on\nthe merits, not on an adequate and independent state proce-\ndural ground. He points to a footnote in that court\u2019s decision\nin which the court stated it would \u201caddress Whyte\u2019s claims\non their merits.\u201d After the court concluded that \u201cWhyte\u2019s\nchallenge to the e\ufb00ectiveness of his trial counsel fails\u201d under\nStrickland, it also reasoned that \u201cWhyte\u2019s derivative challenge\nto the e\ufb00ectiveness of his postconviction counsel likewise\nfails,\u201d which Whyte characterizes as a ruling on the merits.\n   Notwithstanding any footnoted comments or Strickland\nanalysis, the state appellate court disposed of Whyte\u2019s claim\nof ine\ufb00ective assistance of postconviction counsel on\n\f16                                                             No. 21-1268\n\nprocedural grounds. The \ufb01rst sentence of the court\u2019s discus-\nsion states: \u201cWe conclude that the claims raised in Whyte\u2019s\nWIS. STAT. \u00a7 974.06 motion, and repeated in his motion for sen-\ntence modi\ufb01cation, are barred by WIS. STAT. \u00a7 974.06(4) and\nState v. Escalona-Naranjo.\u201d The court then acknowledged\nWhyte\u2019s assertion that his \u201cine\ufb00ective assistance of his post-\nconviction/appellate counsel\u201d was \u201ca su\ufb03cient reason for fail-\ning to properly raise his claims on direct appeal.\u201d When the\nstate appellate court discussed the merits of this argument, it\nstated Whyte\u2019s postconviction motion \u201cwas required to show\nboth de\ufb01cient performance and prejudice,\u201d but Whyte\n\u201cfail[ed] to establish prejudice\u201d because his pleadings were\n\u201cconclusory and legally insu\ufb03cient\u201d under Allen. Even if the\ncourt also rejected Whyte\u2019s claim as meritless, our review is\nforeclosed when adequate and independent state law\ngrounds are su\ufb03cient to resolve the dispute. Harris v. Reed,\n489 U.S. 255, 264 n.10 (1989) (\u201cMoreover, a state court need\nnot fear reaching the merits of a federal claim in an alternative\nholding. By its very de\ufb01nition, the adequate and independent\nstate ground doctrine requires the federal court to honor a\nstate holding that is a su\ufb03cient basis for the state court\u2019s judg-\nment, even when the state court also relies on federal law.\u201d).\n    Whyte responds that the state appellate court\u2019s invocation\nof Allen does not demonstrate that it actually relied on the\npleading standard as a ground for its decision. He notes cor-\nrectly that the court\u2019s second citation to Allen mistakenly in-\ncludes paragraph numbers that do not exist. 5 Whyte also ar-\ngues the court\u2019s recitation of Allen\u2019s pleading requirements\ndoes not show the court applied Allen to the facts at hand.\n\n     5 The state appellate court cites \u201cAllen, 274 Wis. 2d 568, \u00b6\u00b6 84-87,\u201d but\n\nAllen contains only thirty-six paragraphs.\n\fNo. 21-1268                                                     17\n\nWhyte compares this case to Sanders v. Cotton, 398 F.3d 572\n(7th Cir. 2005), in which this court held that a state court\u2019s rec-\nitation of a procedural rule was insu\ufb03cient to show that the\ncourt relied on that rule in reaching its decision because the\ncourt \u201cimmediately proceeded to address and decide the mer-\nits\u201d without adding \u201ca conclusion such as \u2018and Sanders\u2019\nclaims are waived under that standard.\u2019\u201d Id. at 579.\n    These arguments are unconvincing. An error in number-\ning paragraphs does not expunge the Wisconsin Court of Ap-\npeals\u2019 reliance on Allen or its analysis of this procedural rule.\nSanders is also distinguishable from this case, as here the state\nappellate court concluded that, in his pleading, Whyte\n\u201cfail[ed] to establish prejudice.\u201d This was followed by an ex-\nplanation of Allen\u2019s procedural requirement that a petitioner\nplead cause and prejudice in a legally su\ufb03cient and noncon-\nclusory manner. That the conclusion of procedural default\npreceded rather than proceeded from an explanation of Allen\nis of no consequence.\n    Third, Whyte argues that even if the state appellate court\nrelied on Allen, the pleading requirement does not constitute\nan independent state ground in this case. In his words, \u201c[b]y\nholding that Mr. Whyte had failed to show prejudice within\nthe four corners of his 974.06 motion, the Wisconsin Court of\nAppeals necessarily considered the substantive standards\ngoverning the prejudice prong of Strickland.\u201d Put another\nway, because that court had to examine the substance of a\nStrickland claim to know if it was su\ufb03ciently pleaded, Whyte\nmaintains the court\u2019s Allen analysis is not independent from\nfederal law.\n    Whyte misunderstands what constitutes an independent\nstate ground. A state ground \u201cis independent of federal law if\n\f18                                                           No. 21-1268\n\nit does not depend on the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claim.\u201d Tri-\nplett, 996 F.3d at 829 (emphasis added). Whyte e\ufb00ectively\ntransforms this test, asking us to \ufb01nd that a state ground is\nindependent only if it does not depend on the substance of a\npetitioner\u2019s claim. That is not the test. Indeed, under Whyte\u2019s\ntheory, it is di\ufb03cult to imagine any scenario in which Allen\nwould constitute an independent state ground because a Wis-\nconsin court must always examine the substance of the under-\nlying claim to determine whether it is su\ufb03ciently pleaded.\nOur court has consistently held that Allen constitutes an ade-\nquate and independent state law ground, even when it is ap-\nplied to federal claims regarding ine\ufb00ective assistance of\ncounsel. See, e.g., Triplett, 996 F.3d at 830; Lee, 750 F.3d at 693\u2013\n94; see also Garcia, 28 F.4th at 767. 6\n    Whyte did not raise his stun belt and related ine\ufb00ective\nassistance of trial counsel claims on direct appeal in state\ncourt. So, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals ruled that Escalona-\nNaranjo barred those claims, as well as that Whyte failed to\nshow a \u201csu\ufb03cient reason\u201d to avoid procedural default be-\ncause his \u00a7 974.06 motion claiming ine\ufb00ective assistance of\npostconviction counsel was inadequate under Allen\u2019s plead-\ning standard.\n   Unless Whyte can show \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d for his\ndefault under Allen, our review is at an end. \u201cCause requires\na showing of \u2018some type of external impediment\u2019 that\n\n     6 Whyte cites two district court opinions to support his argument: Sin-\ngleton v. Mahoney, No. 17-CV-898-WMC, 2021 WL 848760, at *10 (W.D.\nWis. Mar. 5, 2021), and Walker v. Pollard, No. 18-C-0147, 2019 WL 136694,\nat *6 (E.D. Wis. Jan. 8, 2019). But Walker and Mahoney predate our decision\nin Triplett, where we determined that Allen is an adequate and independ-\nent state procedural rule. 996 F.3d at 830.\n\fNo. 21-1268                                                   19\n\nprevented [Whyte] from presenting his claims.\u201d Garcia, 28\nF.4th at 775 (quoting Thompkins v. P\ufb01ster, 698 F.3d 976, 987 (7th\nCir. 2012)). Whyte o\ufb00ers no external impediment that pre-\nvented him from complying with Allen. Nor can he blame\ncounsel for his default, as Whyte \ufb01led his pro se postconvic-\ntion motion, and \u201cerrors by counsel \u2026 cannot serve as cause\nto excuse [Whyte\u2019s] own default.\u201d Id. Whyte has failed to es-\ntablish cause for his procedural default, and he has not at-\ntempted to show prejudice, so we need not reach that ques-\ntion.\n    Under this reasoning, we AFFIRM the judgment of the dis-\ntrict court.\n\f",
