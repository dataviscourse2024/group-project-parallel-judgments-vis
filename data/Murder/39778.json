This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).\nWhite was convicted of second degree murder after a bench trial. He was sentenced on February 2, 1993, to 30 to 50 years in prison. The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction after remand for a hearing regarding White\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and the Michigan Supreme Court denied *699his application for leave to appeal on February 27, 1996, on the ground that it was not timely filed. On April 25, 1997, White filed a motion for relief from judgment which was finally denied on February 29, 2000.\nWhite filed an initial habeas corpus petition on April 26, 2000, although the petition had been signed and dated on March 19, 2000. In an amended petition and supporting brief, White raised three grounds for relief: (1) his conviction was obtained in violation of due process and the Brady rule; (2) appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance; and (3) newly-discovered evidence could establish his innocence. The respondent moved for summary judgment on the ground that White\u2019s petition was barred by the one-year statute of limitations established by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA).\nThe district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in an order and judgment entered on February 14, 2001. The court found that, because White did not timely file his direct appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, the 90-day time period in which he could have filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court did not serve to delay the start of the limitations period. White\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied. This court granted in part White\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability and ordered briefing on the sole issue of whether White\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is barred by the statute of limitations.\nOn appeal, White argues that his petition should not be barred by the statute of limitations because, inter alia, he timely delivered his appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court to the prison mail system. He also continues to argue the merits of his underlying grounds for relief, but those issues are not properly before the court at this time.\nThis court reviews a district court\u2019s legal conclusions in a habeas proceeding de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. Ford v. Curtis, 277 F.3d 806, 808 (6th Cir.2002). Upon careful consideration, we find that the district court did not err in its determination that White filed his \u00a7 2254 petition 18 days beyond the expiration of the one-year limitations period for such actions. Nonetheless, we further conclude that the district court erred in ruling that White was not entitled to equitable tolling.\nPursuant to AEDPA, a prisoner has one year from the date the direct review of his criminal conviction becomes final to file a habeas corpus action challenging that conviction. Valentine v. Francis, 270 F.3d 1032, 1034 (6th Cir.2001), petition for cert. filed (U.S. Apr. 8, 2002) (No. 01-9696). If the prisoner\u2019s conviction became final prior to April 24, 1996, the effective date of AEDPA, he had one year, or until April 24, 1997, to commence his habeas action. Id. A conviction generally becomes final, and the limitations period begins to run, after the expiration of the ninety-day time period for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. Bronaugh v. Ohio, 235 F.3d 280, 283 (6th Cir.2000).\nWhite argues that his conviction became final on May 14, 1996, ninety days after the Michigan Supreme Court rejected his delayed application for leave to appeal. This would give him until May 14, 1997, to file his \u00a7 2254 petition. However, because White also filed a state motion for relief from judgment on April 25, 1997, he argues that the limitations period was tolled from that date until the motion was finally denied by the Michigan Supreme Court on February 29, 2000. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); Valentine, 270 F.3d at 1034. White\u2019s federal habeas petition was signed on March 19, 2000, and, under this scenario, would have been timely.\n*700The district court found that White\u2019s conviction became final, however, on December 14, 1995, when the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of White\u2019s motion for a new trial on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. Although White attempted to file an application for leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, the application was rejected as untimely because it was received by that court on February 9, 1996, one day beyond the 56 days permitted for appeal. The respondent does not dispute White\u2019s assertion that he delivered his appeal to prison authorities on February 6, 1996; instead, the respondent points out that Michigan has not adopted a \u201cmailbox rule\u201d similar to that adopted by the federal courts pursuant to Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).\nEven if it is assumed, however, that the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of White\u2019s appeal as untimely would divest the U.S. Supreme Court of jurisdiction over a petition for a writ of certiorari, thus precluding the addition of ninety days to White\u2019s limitations period, the district court should have considered the merits of White\u2019s habeas petition under the doctrine of equitable tolling.\nThis court has joined other circuits in finding that the one-year statute of limitations established for \u00a7 2254 and \u00a7 2255 cases by AEDPA is subject to equitable tolling. See Dunlap v. United States, 250 F.3d 1001, 1004 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 649, 151 L.Ed.2d 566 (2001). The district court\u2019s decision not to apply equitable tolling to a case where the determinative facts are undisputed is reviewed de novo. Id. at 1007. For the purpose of determining whether AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations should be tolled in a given case, we have adopted the equitable tolling test already set forth in Andrews v. Orr, 851 F.2d 146 (6th Cir.1988). Pursuant to Andrews, a court should consider five factors when determining the appropriateness of equitably tolling a statute of limitations:\n(1) the petitioner\u2019s lack of notice of the filing requirement; (2) the petitioner\u2019s lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirement; (3) diligence in pursuing one\u2019s rights; (4) absence of prejudice to the respondent; and (5) the petitioner\u2019s reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the legal requirement for filing his claim.\nDunlap, 250 F.3d at 1008.\nThe district court did not address these factors, but considered the question of equitable tolling in relation to White\u2019s claim of newly-discovered evidence, which is actually an argument for a different commencement date for the limitations period. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). In the absence of undisputed facts, we address the Andrews factors instead of remanding the case to the district court to consider them in the first instance.\nThree of the factors to be considered relate to the petitioner\u2019s lack of either actual or constructive knowledge of the filing requirement. In this case, White does not claim ignorance of the fifing requirement; he claims that he reasonably thought he met that requirement. Indeed, if prison officials had delivered his appeal one day earlier, or if Michigan had adopted the federal \u201cmailbox rule,\u201d White\u2019s appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court would have been timely and there would have been no question but that his \u00a7 2254 petition would also have been timely.\nThe second factor is diligence in pursuing one\u2019s rights. While it can be argued that White should not have \u201ccut it so close\u201d in his direct appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court, this is not a case where a prisoner simply sat on his rights and did nothing.\n*701The final factor is absence of prejudice to the respondent. The respondent in this case does not argue prejudice and the time periods involved in this case do not render White\u2019s conviction so remote that the state would be obviously disadvantaged in responding to the merits of White\u2019s petition.\nFor these reasons, as well as the apparent justice in granting a state appellant the equitable benefit of the federally-accepted \u201cmailbox rule\u201d for purposes of tolling a federal statute of limitations, we conclude that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled in this case.\nAccordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand the case for proceedings on the merits.
