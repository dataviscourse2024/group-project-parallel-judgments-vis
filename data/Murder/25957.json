Rodgers, a prisoner under sentence of death who waived a\n\npenalty phase jury, appeals the circuit court\u2019s summary denial of a postconviction\n\nmotion filed pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.851 seeking\n\nsentencing relief pursuant to Hurst v. Florida, 136 S. Ct. 616 (2016), and Hurst v.\n\nState, 202 So. 3d 40 (Fla. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 2161 (2017). We have\n\njurisdiction. See art. V, \u00a7 3(b)(1), Fla. Const.1\n\n\n\n\n     1. We review the summary denial of a postconviction motion de novo.\nBarnes v. State, 124 So. 3d 904, 911 (Fla. 2013).\n\f      We have consistently held that the Hurst decisions do not apply to\n\ndefendants, like Rodgers, who waive a penalty phase jury. See, e.g., Mullens v.\n\nState, 197 So. 3d 16, 40 (Fla. 2016) (affirming the death sentence of a defendant\n\nwho waived a penalty phase jury and explaining that a defendant \u201ccannot subvert\n\nthe right to jury factfinding by waiving that right and then suggesting that a\n\nsubsequent development in the law has fundamentally undermined his sentence\u201d),\n\ncert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 672 (2017); Brant v. State, 197 So. 3d 1051, 1079 (Fla.\n\n2016) (concluding that the Mullens Court\u2019s holding in the context of a direct\n\nappeal \u201cnecessarily preclude[s]\u201d a defendant who waived a penalty phase jury from\n\nraising a Hurst claim on postconviction).\n\n      Rodgers, however, seeks to avoid this result by attacking the waiver itself,\n\narguing that an evidentiary hearing is required to determine if a recently diagnosed\n\ncondition of gender dysphoria, which Rodgers contends existed at the time of the\n\nwaiver, but went undiagnosed by prior evaluators, rendered Rodgers incompetent.\n\nWe agree with the circuit court that the time for Rodgers to contest the prior\n\ncompetency determination has passed. See Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851(d)(1). This\n\nCourt has long since affirmed Rodgers\u2019 waiver of a penalty phase jury, see\n\nRodgers v. State, 3 So. 3d 1127, 1131-33 (Fla. 2009), and Rodgers has not\n\nproffered any newly discovered evidence that would warrant revisiting the validity\n\nof this waiver. Cf. Raleigh v. State, 932 So. 2d 1054, 1060 (Fla. 2006)\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f(recognizing a \u201cnarrow exception to th[e] general procedural bar\u201d of allowing an\n\nAke v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68 (1985)-type claim of inadequate mental health\n\nassistance that should have been raised on direct appeal to instead be raised on\n\npostconviction for only those cases involving \u201cpsychiatric examinations so grossly\n\ninsufficient that they ignore clear indications of either mental retardation or organic\n\nbrain damage\u201d) (quoting State v. Sireci, 502 So. 2d 1221, 1224 (Fla. 1987)).\n\n      Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s summary denial.\n\n      It is so ordered.\n\nLABARGA, C.J., and LEWIS, QUINCE, CANADY, POLSTON, and LAWSON,\nJJ., concur.\nPARIENTE, J., concurs in result with an opinion.\n\nNOT FINAL UNTIL TIME EXPIRES TO FILE REHEARING MOTION AND,\nIF FILED, DETERMINED.\n\nPARIENTE, J., concurring in result.\n\n      The issue in this case is whether Rodgers\u2019 waivers of the right to a penalty\n\nphase jury and the right to postconviction proceedings and counsel should be\n\nrendered invalid because Rodgers was suffering from undiagnosed and untreated\n\ngender dysphoria2 when he made the waivers. See Rodgers v. State (Rodgers III),\n\n\n       2. The American Psychiatric Association defines \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d as \u201ca\nconflict between a person\u2019s physical or assigned gender and the gender with which\nhe/she/they identify.\u201d What is Gender Dysphoria?, Am. Psychiatric Ass\u2019n,\nhttps://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-\ndysphoria (last visited Nov. 8, 2017).\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fNo. SC11-1401, 104 So. 3d 1087, 2012 WL 5381782, *1-2 (Fla. Oct. 17, 2012)\n\n(unpublished); Rodgers v. State (Rodgers II), 3 So. 3d 1127, 1130 (Fla. 2009).\n\nBecause both the trial court and this Court were aware of Rodgers\u2019 long history of\n\nmental illness in determining Rodgers\u2019 competency to make the waivers and in\n\nreviewing Rodgers\u2019 waivers, respectively, I agree that Rodgers\u2019 waivers remain\n\nvalid and, therefore, he is not entitled to Hurst3 relief. See Silvia v. State, No.\n\nSC17-337 (Fla. Feb. 1, 2018); Mullens v. State, 197 So. 3d 16, 38-40 (Fla. 2016). I\n\nwrite separately to emphasize the troubling history of Rodgers\u2019 mental illness.\n\n                                Direct Appeal in 2006\n\n        Rodgers pleaded guilty as a principal to the first-degree murder at issue in\n\nthis case. Rodgers v. State (Rodgers I), 934 So. 2d 1207, 1210 (Fla. 2006).\n\nRodgers then attempted to withdraw his plea and later waived his right to a guilt\n\nphase jury trial, again entering a plea. Id. at 1214. After pleading guilty, Rodgers\n\nwas sentenced to death following the jury\u2019s 9-3 recommendation for death. Id. at\n\n1213.\n\n        On direct appeal, this Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision prohibiting\n\nRodgers from withdrawing his plea, finding that \u201cRodgers understood at the time\n\nof his plea that his attorneys disagreed on whether he should enter the plea.\u201d Id. at\n\n\n\n      3. Hurst v. State (Hurst), 202 So. 3d 40 (Fla. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct.\n2161 (2017); see Hurst v. Florida, 136 S. Ct. 616 (2016).\n\n                                          -4-\n\f1216. As to Rodgers\u2019 sentence of death, this Court reversed and remanded for a\n\nnew penalty phase after determining that the trial court erred in excluding evidence\n\nrelated to two potential mitigating circumstances regarding domination by the\n\ncodefendant. Id. at 1219-20. As to the mitigation, including Rodgers\u2019 difficult\n\nchildhood and his long history of suicide attempts, this Court explained:\n\n      Angela Mason, a social worker, reviewed a variety of records from\n      schools, institutions, hospitals, and law enforcement agencies. The\n      records contained reports that Rodgers was given his first beer at two\n      years of age and that he reported sexual abuse by his mother\n      numerous times, starting at age three. At fourteen, Rodgers reported\n      that his mother had full sexual intercourse with him on multiple\n      occasions, first getting him high on marijuana that was laced with\n      formaldehyde. Although Child Protection Services was called about\n      the abuse, Mason was unable to find any investigative report.\n      Another report stated that Rodgers\u2019 father threatened to shoot him and\n      put an unloaded gun to Rodgers\u2019 head. At school, Rodgers was\n      placed in a class for severely emotionally disturbed children. Rodgers\n      attempted suicide five times by the age of thirteen, including slitting\n      his wrists in a bathtub which left physical evidence.\n             David Foy, a professor of psychology at Pepperdine University,\n      reviewed Rodgers\u2019 medical records and testified that six out of the six\n      classic risk factors for mental illness existed in Rodgers\u2019 childhood\n      home life. Rodgers was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n      Dr. Sarah Deland, a psychiatrist, testified as an expert regarding\n      Rodgers\u2019 mental health. Dr. Deland stated that Rodgers\u2019 diagnoses\n      were post-traumatic stress disorder, disassociative disorder, substance\n      abuse in remission, and borderline personality disorder. She testified\n      in depth about these particular diagnoses and how Rodgers\u2019 life events\n      shaped his development.\n\nId. at 1213. The Court concluded: \u201cGiven the extensive mitigation which\n\nwas presented in the case, including Rodgers\u2019 significant mental health history, we\n\ncannot say that the State has shown that there is no reasonable possibility that the\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\ferror in excluding this evidence did not contribute to the sentence of death.\u201d Id. at\n\n1219-20 (emphasis added).\n\n                    Direct Appeal from Resentencing in 2009\n\n      On remand for resentencing, Rodgers waived his right to a penalty phase\n\njury. Rodgers II, 3 So. 3d at 1130. Rodgers also waived his right and did not\n\nallow his attorneys to present evidence of mitigation other than his own testimony.\n\nId. The trial court again imposed a sentence of death. Id. at 1128.\n\n      On appeal, this Court determined that Rodgers \u201cclearly showed the capacity\n\nto appreciate the proceedings and the nature of possible penalties; he showed that\n\nhe understood the adversarial nature of the legal process; he manifested appropriate\n\ncourtroom behavior; and he was able to testify in a relevant manner.\u201d Id. at 1132-\n\n33. Accordingly, this Court affirmed Rodgers\u2019 sentence of death. Id. at 1135.\n\n                                   Postconviction\n\n      After this Court affirmed his sentence of death following resentencing,\n\nRodgers waived the right to postconviction proceedings and counsel. Rodgers III,\n\n2012 WL 5381782, at *1. Following a Durocher4 hearing, the trial court \u201cfound\n\nRodgers competent and issued an order discharging counsel and dismissing the\n\nproceedings.\u201d Rodgers III, 2012 WL 5381782, at *1.\n\n\n\n\n      4. Durocher v. Singletary, 623 So. 2d 482 (Fla. 1993).\n\n                                        -6-\n\f      Rodgers\u2019 discharged counsel appealed to this Court, challenging the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s competency finding. Id. at *1-2. Reviewing the record, which contained\n\nevidence of severe mental illness, this Court denied counsel\u2019s claim, stating that\n\nRodgers had previously been found \u201ccompetent to: (1) plead guilty to the crime for\n\nwhich [Rodgers] was convicted and sentenced to death, and (2) waive [the] right to\n\na penalty phase jury during [the] second penalty phase, and this Court affirmed on\n\ndirect appeal.\u201d Id. Also, the Court noted that \u201ctwo mental health experts examined\n\nRodgers in preparation for the Durocher hearing, and both determined that\n\nRodgers was competent.\u201d Id. at 2.\n\n                                     This Case\n\n      Rodgers now asserts that, for most of his life, he has suffered from\n\nundiagnosed and untreated gender dysphoria, which undermines the trial court\u2019s\n\nand this Court\u2019s former findings of competency in determining that his waivers\n\nwere valid. However, Rodgers does not raise his condition of gender dysphoria as\n\na claim of newly discovered evidence or ineffective assistance of counsel. See per\n\ncuriam op. at 2.\n\n      From the age of 14, Rodgers spent most of his life incarcerated with mental\n\nillness. In fact, Rodgers and his codefendant, Lawrence, who Rodgers testified\n\n\u201cappealed to [his] angry side,\u201d Rodgers II, 3 So. 3d at 1130, met in a mental\n\nhospital in Chattahoochee, Florida. Rodgers I, 934 So. 2d at 1209.\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f      While in State custody, at the age of 14 and again at the age of 18, Rodgers\n\nattempted self-castration. Amici Curiae Br. of Am. Civil Liberties Union\n\nFoundation & Am. Civil Liberties Union of Fla. (ACLU Br.) at 5. Shortly before\n\nwaiving the right to postconviction proceedings and counsel, Rodgers wrote letters\n\nto defense counsel stating that Rodgers\u2019 gender identity disorder was the driving\n\nforce behind Rodgers\u2019 desire to die, stating that \u201cgender dysphoria and the trauma\n\nand excruciating pain of [Rodgers\u2019] life ha[d] caused [Rodgers] to lose [the] will to\n\nlive and to choose death over life.\u201d Id. at 8. In other words, Rodgers waived both\n\nthe right to a penalty phase jury and the right to postconviction while struggling\n\nwith the effects of his untreated gender dysphoria. Id. at 6-7.\n\n      According to the record, untreated gender dysphoria can cause severe harm\n\nand lead to suicidality and debilitating depression. ACLU Br. at 4; see Appellant\u2019s\n\nInitial Br. at 10. In fact, when Rodgers pleaded guilty, Dr. Fredderic J. Sautter,\n\nPh.D. (a psychologist), opined in his report that Rodgers\u2019 plea may have been\n\ninfluenced by his mental illness and \u201cwish to die.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Second Resp. to\n\nState\u2019s Mot. Suppl. R. & Withdrawal Req. for Protective Order at 12, Rodgers v.\n\nState, No. SC01-185 (Fla. July 12, 2004). Likewise, the ACLU suggests that\n\nRodgers may have waived the penalty phase in an effort to commit suicide by\n\nexecution to escape the pain of the untreated condition. ACLU Br. at 2.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fTherefore, Rodgers\u2019 reported suicidality, self-mutilations, and severe depression\n\nare consistent with the severe symptoms of untreated gender dysphoria.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n      While it appears that untreated gender dysphoria has been a factor in\n\nRodgers\u2019 mental health issues, this Court has already considered and affirmed\n\nRodgers\u2019 waivers of a penalty phase jury, as well as postconviction proceedings\n\nand counsel, with a record indicating severe mental illness. Thus, the recent\n\nspecific diagnosis of gender dysphoria, not raised as a newly discovered evidence\n\nclaim, does not invalidate Rodgers\u2019 waivers. Therefore, I agree with the majority\n\nthat Rodgers is not entitled to have his waivers set aside.\n\nAn Appeal from the Circuit Court in and for Santa Rosa County,\n     John F.
