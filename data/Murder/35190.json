            "opinion_text": "\nOpinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nAppellant Robert E. McGrogan was tried by a jury in Allegheny County and found guilty of second degree murder. Post-trial motions were denied and he was sentenced to serve a term of not less than ten nor more than twenty years. Appellant\u2019s sole contention in this direct appeal is that the tidal court erred in failing to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter. We affirm.\nAppellant places principal reliance on the maxim that \u201c[wjhere there is some evidence which would reduce the crime to voluntary manslaughter, defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed upon the subject.\u201d1 Although conceding that he neither admitted the slaying nor introduced evidence tending to estab*586lish self-defense2 or passion and provocation,3 appellant argues that the factual basis for voluntary manslaughter here was established inferentially by the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence.4 We need not, however, respond to appellant\u2019s argument, because we find the record clearly evinces that as part of his trial strategy appellant decided to forego the possibility of the jury returning a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.\nIt is, of course, firmly embedded within our system of criminal justice that certain decisions during trial are within the exclusive province of counsel. For instance, in the seminal case of Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 85 S. Ct. 564 (1965), the United States Supreme Court acknowledged that the decision of whether to contemporaneously object to admission of evidence was one calling for the expertise and experience of\n*587counsel, and that a failure to object at trial may constitute a \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d precluding the defendant from obtaining relief in the federal courts. Id. at 451-52, 85 S. Ct. at 569.5\nThe ABA Standards for Criminal Justice urge that \u201c[t]he lawyer should seek to maintain a cooperative relationship at all stages, while maintaining also the ultimate choice and responsibility for the strategic and tactical decisions in the case.\u201d6 The progeny of Henry, as well as decisional law predating Henry, have delineated the type of \u201cstrategic and tactical decisions\u201d which must7 be exercised by defense counsel alone.\n*588Courts have held that such tactical decisions as whether to make a summation,8 whether to request instructions,9 whether to make a motion for change of venue,10 whether to challenge hearsay statements,11 and many others12 are decisions to he made hy defense counsel.\n*589The decision of whether to request a charge on voluntary manslaughter is clearly a matter of trial strategy that calls for the \u201cultimate choice and responsibility\u201d of defense counsel. If no charge on voluntary manslaughter is requested, the effect is to limit the jury\u2019s options to either returning first or second degree murder or outright acquittal. The nature of the decision is such that \u201conly trained experts can comprehend [its] full significance.\u201d13 If, as a matter of constitutional law, trial strategy may govern the decision of whether to object to illegally obtained evidence, Henry, supra, a fortiori the state created substantive right of a charge on voluntary manslaughter is similarly a matter for trial strategy.14\n*590Turning our focus to tbe record, it clearly establishes that as a matter of trial strategy counsel sought to limit the jury\u2019s options to either finding first or second degree murder or outright acquittal. The evidence of the Commonwealth, although substantial, was somewhat conflicting as to appellant\u2019s actual conduct at the time of the slaying. Appellant\u2019s counsel could have reasonably decided that the jury might find the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence inconclusive and thus return a verdict of outright acquittal.\nA colloquy between defense counsel and the court during the course of the trial further indicates the nature of counsel\u2019s trial strategy. The court expressed a desire to know whether appellant was seeking to establish a basis for self-defense and the following colloquy ensued: \u201cThe Court: Do I understand you intend to make a defense of self-defense in this case? Is that what you are trying to lead up too? Mr. Village: No, your Honor. The Court: Then self-defense isn\u2019t what you intend to do? Mr. Village: Not as far as I can determine at this time.\u201d At the conclusion of the trial appellant neither requested a charge *591on voluntary manslaughter15 nor did he interpose an objection when the court instructed the jury it could not return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.16\nThe record amply supports the conclusion that as part of his evaluation of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence trial counsel decided to forego a defense of self-defense and charge on voluntary manslaughter. Trial counsel did not either during cross-examination or through defense witnesses attempt to establish self-defense or any basis for voluntary manslaughter. Instead his trial strategy was to seek outright acquittal on the ground that appellant did not commit or participate in the slaying. In the face of trial counsel\u2019s considered choice, made with a \u201creasonable basis\u201d, to limit the jury\u2019s options, the trial court did not err in its charge. Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 604-05, 235 A. 2d 349, 352-53 (1967); see note 14 supra. And, as the Supreme Court noted in Henry, when for some reason counsel\u2019s deliberate trial strategy \u201cbackfires,\u201d the failure of the strategy cannot form the basis for relief upon review. 379 U.S. at 451, 85 S. Ct. at 569; Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, supra at 604-05, 235 A. 2d 352-53, see note 14 supra.\nThe judgment of sentence is affirmed.\n\n Commonwealth v.

McCusker, 448 Pa. 382, 292 A. 2d 286 (1972) ; Commonwealth v. Jennings, 442 Pa. 18, 274 A. 2d 767 (1971) ; Commonwealth v. Moore, 398 Pa. 198, 157 A. 2d 65 (1959) ; Commonwealth v.

Rev. 1021 (1958).\n\n\n This Court has many times considered a defendant\u2019s alternative defenses. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Walker, 447 Pa. 146, 288 A. 2d 741 (1972) (self-defense and provocation) ; Commonwealth v. Finnie, 415 Pa. 166, 202 A. 2d 85 (1964) (accident, self-defense and intoxication) ; Commonwealth v. Williams, 309 Pa. 529, 164 Atl. 532 (1932) (self-defense and insanity).\n\n\n As Judge Lumbaed noted in United States ex rel. Cruz v. LaVallee, 448 F. 2d 671, 679 (2nd Cir. 1971) : \u201cThe Supreme Court stated in Henry v. Mississippi that \u2018the deliberate bypassing by counsel of the contemporaneous\u2014objection rule as a part of trial strategy would have (thej effect\u2019 of precluding the defendant from later asserting constitutional claims, even where the trial strategy was adopted by counsel without prior consultation with the defendant. 379 U.S. at 451-452, 85 S. Ct. at 569. A lawyer must be able to determine questions of strategy during trial; and unless there are exceptional circumstances or unless the lawyer is so incompetent as to deprive the defendant of the right to effective assistance of counsel, his decision regarding trial strategy must be binding.\u201d (Citations omitted.) (Footnote omitted.) See generally, Sandalow, Henry v. Mississippi and the Adequate State Ground: Proposals for a Revised Doctrine, 1965 Sup. Ct. Review 187 (1965).\n\n\n ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function and the Defense Function, the Prosecution Function \u00a75.2(b) (Approved Draft 1971) (Commentary).\n\n\n In Nelson v. California, 346 F. 2d 73, 81 (9th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1025, 86 S. Ct. 1942 (1966), the court held that a decision made by counsel as part of trial strategy was binding upon defendant even where the record disclosed that defendant disagreed with the decision. The court reasoned that \u201c[i]f such decisions are to be made by the defendant, he is likely to do himself more harm than good, and ... a contrary rule would seriously impair the constitutional guaranty of the right to counsel.\u201d Id.

Jefferson, 423 Pa. 541, 226 A. 2d 765 (1967).\nIt is equally well settled that certain rights of a defendant require that he participate in the decision of whether to exercise them. The ABA Standards recommend that \u201c[t]he decisions which are to be made by the accused after full consultation with counsel *589are: (i) what plea to enter; (ii) whether to waive jury trial; (iii) whether to testify in his own behalf.\u201d ABA Project Relating to the Defense Function \u00a75.2(a) (Approved Draft 1971).

Herold, 408 F. 2d 125 (2nd Cir. 1969) (Judge Waterman, dissenting) ; see also Note, 54 Cal. L.

The ABA Standards additionally suggest that \u201c[a] lawyer should take care to consult with his client to the extent feasible on all matters affecting substantial rights.\u201d Id. at \u00a75.2 (c) (commentary).\n\n\n In Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 604-605, 235 A. 2d 349, 352-53 (1967), we held: \u201cThe test [for *590ineffective assistance of counsel] is not whether other alternatives were more reasonable, employing a hindsight evaluation of the record. Although weigh the alternatives we must, the balance tips in favor of a finding of effective assistance as soon as it is determined that trial counsel\u2019s decisions had any reasonable basis.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)\nIf, however, the decision purportedly made by counsel has no \u201creasonable basis\u201d, see Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, supra, a defendant may successfully allege that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. As was noted in United States ex rel. Bruno v. Herold, 408 F. 2d 125, 139 (2nd Cir. 1969) (Judge Waterman dissenting) : \u201c[A] waiver [is] imputable to the accused only when his counsel\u2019s decision is a deliberate one made by counsel affirmatively to enhance, in counsel\u2019s judgment, the accused\u2019s chances, and that just a mere default by counsel is not imputable to an accused as a waiver of his rights.\u201d\n\n\nPa. R. Crim. P. 1119(b) states: \u201cNo portions of tbe charge nor omissions therefrom may be assigned as error, unless specific objections are made thereto before the jury retires to deliberate.\u201d\n\n\n Id.\n\n",
