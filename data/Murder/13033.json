Record No. 2568-98-2        CHIEF JUDGE JOHANNA L. FITZPATRICK\n                                         JANUARY 11, 2000\nCOMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA\n\n\n          FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE CITY OF RICHMOND\n                    James B. Wilkinson, Judge\n\n          Kenneth C. Chrisman for appellant.\n\n          John H. McLees, Jr., Assistant Attorney\n          General (Mark L. Earley, Attorney General, on\n          brief), for appellee.\n\n\n     Jermaine Alfonzo Harris (appellant) and his two\n\ncodefendants were convicted in a joint jury trial of\n\nsecond-degree murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32.     On\n\nappeal, appellant contends the trial court erred by refusing to\n\ngrant his request for a mistrial because the Assistant\n\nCommonwealth's Attorney:    (1) improperly \"maligned\" defense\n\ncounsel during the guilt/innocence phase of trial; (2) referred\n\nto the codefendants as \"animals\" during closing arguments in the\n\npenalty phase of trial; and (3) mentioned parole during closing\n\n\n\n\n     *\n       Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-413, recodifying Code\n\u00a7 17-116.010, this opinion is not designated for publication.\n\farguments in the penalty phase of trial.       For the following\n\nreasons, we reverse and remand for re-sentencing.\n\n                            I.   BACKGROUND\n\n     Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth,\n\nthe prevailing party below, granting to it all reasonable\n\ninferences fairly deducible therefrom.        See Juares v.\n\nCommonwealth, 26 Va. App. 154, 156, 493 S.E.2d 677, 678 (1997).\n\nSo viewed, the evidence established that Darlene Kittrell and\n\nShateema Smith were walking home when Isham Davis told them that\n\nVincent Hall was beating Smith's mother.       A fight ensued, and\n\nHall was thrown to the ground.     After he fell, a group of\n\npeople, including appellant and two codefendants, attacked Hall.\n\nKittrell testified that the two codefendants kicked and\n\n\"stomped\" Hall's head, while appellant kicked his legs.       Julius\n\nGibson, another witness, confirmed that appellant was one of the\n\nattackers.    Hall died as a result of the head injuries sustained\n\nin this attack.\n\n     At the conclusion of the guilt phase, the jury convicted\n\nappellant and his two codefendants of second-degree murder.        In\n\nclosing argument during the penalty phase of the trial, the\n\nAssistant Commonwealth's Attorney described the violent nature\n\nof Hall's death and stated the following:\n\n             . . . And, Vincent Hall, the manner in which\n             he died is horrendous, absolutely\n             horrendous. There is no excuse whatsoever.\n\n                                 - 2 -\n\f             There is no excuse for somebody stomping on\n             somebody's head. . . . And [Hall] died\n             going through an absolutely horrible,\n             torturous experience.\n                  I am not even going to call them\n             animals because animals don't kill their\n             own.\n\n(Emphasis added).    Appellant objected to the statement and moved\n\nfor a mistrial.    Although denying a mistrial, the trial court\n\nsustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the\n\nstatement.\n\n     In closing argument at the penalty phase, appellant's\n\nattorney suggested to the jury that a sentence of five years\n\nwould keep appellant in prison until October 7, 2003. 1     In its\n\nrebuttal argument, the Commonwealth argued that this statement\n\nwas untrue.\n\n             As I said before, the defense attorney's job\n             is to sell you a bill of goods in some\n             cases. And, they're telling you on\n             October 7, five years from now, [the\n             defendants will be released,] and that's not\n             really true. In Virginia they will be\n             eligible for parole--\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Other counsel representing Isham Davis, one of the\ncodefendants in this case, first argued this issue in his\nclosing argument in the penalty phase. Counsel stated that by\nsentencing Davis to five years imprisonment he would not \"have\nthe opportunity to take a breath as a free man\" until October 7,\n2003. Counsel also stated: \"I suggest to you that five years\nincarceration for this crime is more than adequate. It is the\nminimum of what you can impose and it's what you should impose.\"\nAppellant's counsel made the same argument.\n\n\n                                 - 3 -\n\fAppellant and other counsel objected to the Commonwealth's\n\ninjecting the issue of parole.    In the presence of the jury, the\n\ntrial court stated the following:\n\n          You are correcting what they said, but you\n          can't go into that. They were wrong. They\n          won't be serving five years. He gets a\n          certain amount of time off for good time.\n          . . . Don't go into the parole laws. Just\n          leave it like it is. That is not correct.\n          The Court will instruct them that is not\n          correct.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n\n     During the jury's sentencing deliberations, the parties\n\ndebated at length the motion for a mistrial, including the\n\nCommonwealth's reference to the defendants as \"animals,\" the\n\nmention of parole, and the trial court's statement regarding\n\nearly release for \"good time.\"    The trial court recalled the\n\njury and provided the following cautionary instruction:\n\n          All right, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,\n          any reference by the Commonwealth's Attorney\n          to the word animal you completely disregard\n          and dismiss it all together. On the\n          question of parole, you should not concern\n          yourself with that one way or the other.\n          You fix what you think is a just penalty.\n          What takes place after that is none of your\n          concern, nor of mine. You understand? So,\n          dismiss all that from your mind in your\n          deliberations. Does anyone have any\n          questions about that? All right. Thank\n          you. Y'all may retire.\n\nThe jury deliberated further and sentenced appellant to twenty\n\nyears imprisonment.\n\n\n\n\n                                 - 4 -\n\f                      II.   MOTION FOR MISTRIAL\n\n     The decision to grant a mistrial lies within the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial court.     See Kasi v. Commonwealth, 256\n\nVa. 407, 424, 508 S.E.2d 57, 67 (1998); Clagett v. Commonwealth,\n\n252 Va. 79, 88, 472 S.E.2d 263, 268 (1996).       \"Whether improper\n\nevidence is so prejudicial as to require a mistrial is a\n\nquestion of fact to be resolved by the trial court in each\n\nparticular case.\"    Beavers v. Commonwealth, 245 Va. 268, 280,\n\n427 S.E.2d 411, 420 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 859 (1993).\n\n\"Thus, a trial court's denial of a motion for a mistrial will\n\nnot be reversed on appeal unless there exists a manifest\n\nprobability as a matter of law that the improper evidence\n\nprejudiced the accused.\"    Mills v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. App.\n\n415, 420, 482 S.E.2d 860, 862 (1997).\n\n             A.   Commonwealth's Reference to \"Animals\"\n\n     \"It is well-settled that errors assigned because of a\n\nprosecutor's alleged improper comments or conduct during\n\nargument will not be considered on appeal unless an accused\n\ntimely moves for a cautionary instruction or for a mistrial.\"\n\nCheng v. Commonwealth, 240 Va. 26, 38, 393 S.E.2d 599, 605-06\n\n(1990).   \"This requirement affords the trial court the\n\nopportunity to provide cautionary instructions when appropriate\n\nto correct the alleged error.\"     Mack v. Commonwealth 20 Va. App.\n\n5, 8, 454 S.E.2d 750, 751 (1995) (citing Beavers, 245 Va. at\n\n279, 427 S.E.2d at 419).    Thus, a judgment will not be reversed\n\n                                 - 5 -\n\f\"for a statement of counsel which the court afterwards directs\n\nthe jury to disregard unless there is a manifest probability\n\nthat the . . . statement has been prejudicial to the adverse\n\nparty.\"   Kitze v. Commonwealth, 246 Va. 283, 288, 435 S.E.2d\n\n583, 585 (1993) (quoting Saunders v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 204,\n\n303, 237 S.E.2d 150, 156 (1977)).\n\n     In the instant case, the record established that the trial\n\ncourt promptly and unequivocally instructed the jury to\n\ndisregard the Commonwealth's reference to animals.    The jury is\n\npresumed to have followed the trial court's curative\n\ninstruction.    See Newton v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 433, 450,\n\n512 S.E.2d 846, 854 (1999); Mills v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. App.\n\n415, 420, 482 S.E.2d 860, 862 (1997) (\"Juries are presumed to\n\nfollow prompt, explicit, curative instructions from the trial\n\njudge.\"). 2   Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying appellant's motion for a mistrial based\n\nupon the Commonwealth's remarks about \"animals.\"\n\n\n\n\n     2\n       Rosser v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. App. 308, 482 S.E.2d 83\n(1997), cited by appellant, is factually distinguishable. In\nthat case, the prosecutor told the jury that the defendant,\nwhile sitting shackled in plain view, was \"an animal . . . in\nevery sense of the word. . . .\" Id. at 313, 482 S.E.2d at 86.\nAlthough the trial judge \"requested\" the jury to disregard the\nstatement, we held that the prosecutor was not \"chastised\" for\nmaking an inappropriate argument and that the request \"lacked\nthe direction that should be given when inappropriate argument\nis made.\" Id. at 316, 482 S.E.2d at 87.\n\n                                - 6 -\n\f                       B.    Mention of Parole\n\n     Also, in closing argument in the penalty phase, appellant's\n\ncounsel argued that appellant was the least culpable of those\n\ninvolved.   He requested the jury to sentence appellant to the\n\nfive-year minimum term of imprisonment and said if so he would\n\nbe incarcerated until October 7, 2003.      To address this\n\nstatement, the Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney referred to the\n\nparole process:   \"In Virginia they will be eligible for\n\nparole . . . .\"   While sustaining appellant's objection, the\n\ntrial court continued the colloquy in front of the jury and\n\ninjected the issue of \"good time.\"       The trial court stated:\n\n\"They won't be serving five years.       He gets a certain amount of\n\ntime off for good time.\"\n\n     Although the trial court instructed the jury to disregard\n\nthe issue of parole, at that point the jury had heard from both\n\nthe Commonwealth and the trial court that appellant would not\n\nserve the time imposed.     These remarks were highly prejudicial\n\nand there is a manifest probability that the statements\n\nimproperly influenced the jury's verdict.        See, e.g., Kitze, 246\n\nVa. at 288, 435 S.E.2d at 585 (statement to jury that the\n\ndefendant \"may go free\" if they found him not guilty by reason\n\nof insanity was improper); Walker v. Commonwealth, 25 Va. App.\n\n50, 63, 486 S.E.2d 126, 133 (1997) (\"To inform the jury that\n\ncredit for good behavior exists may invite the jury to attempt\n\nto compensate for the credit, resulting in a sentence longer\n\n                                 - 7 -\n\fthan the jury intended to impose.\").   Additionally, the trial\n\ncourt's cautionary instruction that the jury should not concern\n\nitself with what happens after conviction did not remove the\n\nprejudicial effect of the improper comments.   See Kitze, 246 Va.\n\nat 289, 435 S.E.2d at 586.\n\n     Accordingly, we reverse and remand the case for\n\nre-sentencing. 3\n\n                                         Reversed and remanded\n                                         for re-sentencing.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       Appellant's argument that the Assistant Commonwealth's\nAttorney improperly \"maligned\" defense counsel during the\nguilt/innocence phase of trial is procedurally barred.\nAppellant did not object to any of the Commonwealth's remarks\nand we will not address this issue for the first time on appeal.\nSee Rule 5A:18.\n\n                              - 8 -\n\f",
