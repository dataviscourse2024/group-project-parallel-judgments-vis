Because we write only for the benefit of the parties, we assume familiarity with the facts of this case and its procedural history. We will affirm.\nI.\nOn June 15, 2000, the body of nineteen-year-old Devon Guzman was found in her car in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. She died as a result of a four-inch cut in her throat. Immediately after Guzman\u2019s body was found, the local newspapers, The Express-Times and The Morning Call, began publishing articles about her death. On July 29, 2000, The Express-Times reported that Brandon Bloss, Hetzel\u2019s husband at the time, was a suspect in Guzman\u2019s murder. After Hetzel and Bloss were charged in August of 2000 with first degree murder in connection with Guzman\u2019s death, the articles began to focus on the criminal investigation, the legal proceedings, and the connections among Het-zel, Bloss, and Guzman. The newspapers reported that Guzman was involved in two lesbian relationships: one with Keary Ren-ner, with whom she lived, and another with Hetzel. Thus they began referring to the case as involving a \u201clesbian love triangle.\u201d The record reflects that between the day Guzman\u2019s body was discovered on June 15, 2000, and the day Hetzel and Bloss\u2019s jury was chosen on September 24, 2001, the newspapers published approximately seventy-two articles about the case.\nHetzel and Bloss were charged with first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County, Pennsylvania. Before the trial and during voir dire, Hetzel moved for a change of venue, arguing that a fair and impartial jury could not be selected in Northampton County. The trial court denied those motions. Jury selection for the trial began on September 11, 2001, but the Court declared a mistrial after the terrorist attacks of that day. Shortly thereafter, a second trial commenced. Hetzel and Bloss were tried jointly, and the jury convicted them on the first degree murder charge and acquitted them of the conspiracy to commit murder charge. They were both sentenced to life imprisonment.\nHetzel appealed her conviction and sentence to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, including among her arguments the claim that the Court of Common Pleas erred by denying her motions for a change of venue. The Superior Court addressed the change of venue claim on the merits and affirmed. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the Superior Court decision. After the Pennsylvania Superior Court denied Hetzel\u2019s petition for relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied her petition for an appeal of that decision, Hetzel filed a timely petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\nThe petition included four claims for relief, including Hetzel\u2019s claim that the state trial court\u2019s denials of her motions for a change of venue violated her due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Magistrate Judge filed a Report and Recommendation, recommending that the petition be denied without an evidentiary hearing and that the District Court decline to issue a certificate of appealability on any of her claims. The District Court adopted the Report and Recommendation in part and denied the petition without an evidentiary *282hearing but issued a certificate of appeala-bility on the change of venue claim. Het-zel filed a timely appeal.\nII.\nThe issue presented in this appeal was adjudicated on the merits by the Superior Court of Pennsylvania. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, et seq., we must affirm the denial of the writ of habe-as corpus unless the state adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); Vazquez v. Wilson, 550 F.3d 270, 276 (3d Cir.2008). Because Hetzel does not argue that the standard used by the Superior Court was \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law, we focus only on whether the decision \u201cinvolved an unreasonable application of[ ] clearly established Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cunreasonable\u201d is \u201cdifficult to define,\u201d but has held that an \u201cunreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect or erroneous application of federal law.\u201d Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 410-12, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (emphases in original). Instead, we look to whether the \u201cstate court\u2019s application of clearly established law is objectively unreasonable.\u201d Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 694, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002). In making this determination, we presume that the state court\u2019s factual findings are correct. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). An applicant may rebut that presumption by clear and convincing evidence. Id.\nIn determining whether \u00a7 2254(d) prohibits granting the writ, the Court first must determine the applicable \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d See Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63, 71, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (quoting \u00a7 2254(d)(1)). \u201cClearly established Federal law\u201d is the \u201cgoverning legal principle or principles set forth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its decision.\u201d Id. We then determine whether the state court\u2019s application of this clearly established law to the facts of this case was unreasonable.\nIII.\n\u201c[T]he right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, \u2018indifferent\u2019 jurors.\u201d Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 722, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961). \u201c[Jjurors need not, however, be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.\u201d Murphy v. Florida, 421 U.S. 794, 799-800, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 44 L.Ed.2d 589 (1975). In cases involving intense pretrial publicity, the Supreme Court has held that a change of venue is constitutionally required in certain cases because \u201cadverse pretrial publicity can create such a presumption of prejudice in a community that the jurors\u2019 claims that they can be impartial should not be believed.\u201d Patton v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025, 1031, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984); see Irvin, 366 U.S. at 722-23, 81 S.Ct. 1639. Yet, we will presume prejudice only in the rare case where the \u201cmedia or other community reaction to a crime or a defendant engenders an atmosphere so hostile and pervasive as to preclude a rational trial process.\u201d Rock v. Zimmerman, 959 F.2d 1237, 1252 (3d Cir.1992) (en banc), abrogated on other grounds by Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993); see also Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966); Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 (1965). Supreme Court prec*283edent instructs that, when evaluating whether the pretrial publicity violated the defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury, we are to consider the content, quantity, and timing of the publicity. See Murphy, 421 U.S. at 798-803, 95 S.Ct. 2031; Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 723, 724-26, 83 S.Ct. 1417, 10 L.Ed.2d 663 (1963); Irvin, 366 U.S. at 724-28, 81 S.Ct. 1639. We may also look to the record of voir dire to examine the effect of the publicity on the venire. See, e.g., Patton, 467 U.S. at 1033-35, 104 S.Ct. 2885; Irvin, 366 U.S. at 726-27, 81 S.Ct. 1639; Flamer v. Delaware, 68 F.3d 736, 754-55 (3d Cir.1995).\nIn denying Hetzel\u2019s change of venue claim, the Pennsylvania Superior Court applied the following standard:\nPre-trial publicity will be presumed to have been prejudicial if the defendant is able to prove that the publicity was sensational, inflammatory, and slanted toward conviction, rather than factual and objective; that such publicity revealed the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record, if any, or referred to confessions, admissions, or reenactments of the crime by the defendant; or that it was derived from official police and prosecutorial reports. Even if the defendant proves the existence of one or more of these circumstances, a change of venue or venire is not warranted unless he or she also shows that the pre-trial publicity was so extensive, sustained, and pervasive that the community must be deemed to have been saturated with it, and that there was insufficient time between the publicity and the trial for any prejudice to have dissipated.\nCommonwealth v. Hetzel, 822 A.2d 747, 764 (Pa.Super.Ct.2003) (quoting Commonwealth v. Karenbauer, 552 Pa. 420, 715 A.2d 1086, 1092 (1998)). This standard is consistent with clearly established federal law, and Hetzel does not argue otherwise.\nNext, we must determine \u201cwhether the state court\u2019s application of clearly established law [was] objectively unreasonable.\u201d Bell, 535 U.S. at 694, 122 S.Ct. 1843. We ask whether \u201cthe state court decision, evaluated objectively and on the merits, resulted in an outcome that cannot reasonably be justified under\u201d relevant Supreme Court precedent. Werts v. Vaughn, 228 F.3d 178, 204 (3d Cir.2000).\nAfter setting forth the standard for a motion for a change of venue under Pennsylvania law, the Superior Court evaluated Hetzel\u2019s claim as follows:\nAs a result of counsel\u2019s request for a change of venue, the trial judge reviewed the media accounts of the case and considered Hetzel\u2019s claim of prejudice. The court denied the motion because it concluded that the published reports, though voluminous, were not \u201csensational, inflammatory nor slanted toward conviction, but [were] factual and objectively reported.\u201d Nonetheless, the court indicated that it would revisit the issue if it became \u201cevident during jury voir dire that the ability ... to empanel a fair and impartial jury has been compromised by the pretrial publicity.\u201d\nThereafter, jury selection in the case was thorough and careful. The court dismissed for cause all jurors who hinted at having a fixed opinion in the case or who believed they were unable to be fair or impartial. While the majority of the jurors chosen to serve had some knowledge of the case through the media, none reported that the exposure prompted a fixed opinion and all stated that they would decide the matter consistent with the court\u2019s instructions and based on the evidence presented at trial.\nIn light of the conscientious and methodical manner in which the court presided over jury selection in this case, as well as our limited scope of review, we *284cannot find that there was an abuse of discretion in refusing to grant the change of venue. The record simply does not reveal an extensive, sustained, or pervasive effect from the media coverage in this case.\nHetzel, 822 A.2d at 764-65 (citations omitted).\nWe find no error in this analysis. A review of the newspaper articles in the record establish that they are, as the trial court found, largely \u201cfactual and objectively reported.\u201d Id. at 764 (quoting the trial court\u2019s opinion). The articles focus on Guzman\u2019s death, the police investigation, the arrest of Hetzel and Bloss, and the court proceedings before the trial. Many of the articles do refer to the \u201clesbian love triangle,\u201d but these articles do not report that Hetzel confessed to the crime or call for Hetzel\u2019s conviction. Nor was there any coverage of any past criminal acts or misdeeds by Hetzel, other than her adulterous affair. Although Hetzel claims that the newspapers published letters to the editor calling for her conviction and the death penalty, only two of the letters to the editor in the record \u2014 penned by the same woman \u2014 call for conviction and the death penalty. Additionally, in one of the letters, the writer identifies Guzman as her niece. Therefore, Hetzel has not rebutted the presumption that the trial court correctly found that the articles were primarily factual in nature and \u201cno[t] slanted toward conviction.\u201d Id. (refusing to disturb the trial court\u2019s findings).\nAlthough Hetzel compares her case to Rideau, the content of the newspaper coverage here is distinct from the publicity there. Rideau involved the dissemination of a film showing Rideau confessing to the crime with which he was charged. 373 U.S. at 724-27, 83 S.Ct. 1417. Obviously, watching the defendant confess to a crime is likely to have the effect of persuading community members that the defendant is, in fact, guilty of committing the crime. Here, the articles were much less likely to have the effect of convincing potential jurors of Hetzel\u2019s guilt than the film of a confession at issue in Rideau. The content of the coverage is also distinguishable from that in Irvin, in which the press repeatedly reported that Irvin had confessed to the crime, reported on his prior criminal convictions, and claimed he had offered to plead guilty to the crime he was charged with committing. 366 U.S. at 725-726, 81 S.Ct. 1639.\nAdditionally, there was a significant passage of time between the height of the media coverage in the summer of 2000 and the trial in September 2001. \u201cThat time soothes and erases is a perfectly natural phenomenon, familiar to all.\u201d Patton, 467 U.S. at 1034, 104 S.Ct. 2885; see Murphy, 421 U.S. at 802, 95 S.Ct. 2031. In Patton, the Supreme Court explained that, although potential jurors may remember the crime, \u201c[i]t is not unusual that one\u2019s recollection of the fact that a notorious crime was committed lingers long after the feelings of revulsion that create prejudice have passed.\u201d 467 U.S. at 1035, 104 S.Ct. 2885. Here, the intensity of the coverage diminished between the discovery of Guzman\u2019s body and the trial. On appeal, Hetzel claims that seventy-two articles appeared in the local newspapers before her trial but informs us that twenty-four of these articles were published after January 1, 2001. Thus, the jurors were at most exposed to approximately three articles a month for the nine months preceding the trial. The passage of time and the sporadic nature of the coverage in the months proceeding the trial suggest that any prejudice that may have been presumed around the time of Guzman\u2019s death and Hetzel\u2019s arrest may have dissipated by the next year.\n*285The record of voir dire also suggests that the publicity surrounding the case did not deprive Hetzel of her right to an impartial jury. During voir dire, slightly more than two-thirds of the seventy-five-person venire admitted that they had heard, seen, or read news coverage of the case. Yet, only two of these jurors stated that they had a fixed opinion about the guilt of the defendants, and both were stricken for cause. Five other jurors answered that they could not give the defendants or the Commonwealth a fair and impartial trial. The percentage of jurors who stated that they had a fixed opinion about the guilt of the defendants here (approximately 3%) is much lower than that in Murphy (26%) and Patton (77%), cases in which the Supreme Court rejected claims of prejudice. See Murphy, 421 U.S. at 803, 95 S.Ct. 2031; Patton, 467 U.S. at 1029, 104 S.Ct. 2885. Thus, the pretrial publicity did not have the effect of convincing the community of Hetzel\u2019s guilt.\nFinally, Hetzel argues that the publicity focused on the lesbian relationships \u201cin- and-of themselves created a hostile environment which precluded a rational trial process.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 28. However, Hetzel offers only speculation, and no evidence, to support the theory that knowledge of the lesbian relationship affected the impartiality of the jurors. She also recognizes that any jury, regardless of the venue, would have heard about her lesbian relationship with Guzman during the trial. Furthermore, Hetzel\u2019s attorney asked the venire whether they could remain impartial and judge Hetzel fairly even though she was bisexual. No one responded that they could not. There is simply no reason to presume prejudice on this record.\nHetzel has not established that the Superior Court\u2019s decision that the media coverage was not so \u201cextensive, sustained, or pervasive,\u201d Hetzel, 822 A.2d at 764, so as to require a change of venue for her trial was an objectively unreasonable application of federal law. Therefore, we must affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying the writ of habeas corpus.\nIV.\nFor these reasons, the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.\n",
