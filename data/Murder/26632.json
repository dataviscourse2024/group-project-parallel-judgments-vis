BACKGROUND\n\n       Defendant, Michael Young, Jayne Jackson, and Jonathan Cornell Harris lived together.\nOn July 14, 2017, the roommates got into a dispute over bills and missing hamburger meat,\nwhich led to defendant firing a .20 gauge shotgun round through a window to where Young,\nJackson, and Harris were watching television. The shot struck Young in the head, but was not\nfatal.\n\n\n1\n  Defendant was found not guilty of three counts of assault with intent to murder, two counts of\nAWIGBH, and five counts of felony-firearm corresponding to those predicate felonies.\nDefendant was also originally convicted of a fifth count of felony-firearm, but that conviction\nwas set aside because the corresponding predicate felony was a lesser-included offense of\nintentional discharge of a firearm at a dwelling causing physical injury.\n\n\n\n                                                -1-\n\f       Defendant was arrested and charged with three counts of assault with intent to murder\n(AWIM); three counts of AWIGBH; intentional discharge of a firearm at a dwelling causing\nphysical injury; intentional discharge of a firearm at a dwelling; carrying a dangerous weapon\nwith unlawful intent; felon-in-possession; and 10 corresponding felony-firearm charges.\n\n       Throughout the proceedings in the lower court, defendant objected to the prosecution\u2019s\ndecision to charge defendant with (1) both greater offenses and lesser included offenses and (2)\nseparate felony-firearm charges for the lesser included offenses. The trial court assured\ndefendant that it would instruct the jurors to ensure their understanding of the charges.\nDefendant was convicted and sentenced as described, and now appeals.\n\n                             II. RELIABILITY OF JURY VERDICT\n\n        Defendant first argues that the jury\u2019s verdict was unreliable because the trial court\u2019s\ninstructions, coupled with the volume of charges against defendant and the verdict form,\nconfused the jury. We disagree. Claims of instructional error involving a question of law are\nreviewed de novo. People v Dupree, 486 Mich. 693, 702; 788 NW2d 399 (2010).\n\n        \u201cA criminal defendant is entitled to have a properly instructed jury consider the evidence\nagainst him.\u201d People v Hawthorne, 474 Mich. 174, 184; 713 NW2d 724 (2006). A defendant\nbears the burden of establishing that the instructional error undermined the reliability of the\nverdict. See id. \u201cEven if instructions are imperfect, reversal is not required if they fairly present\nthe issues to be tried and sufficiently protect the defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d People v Chapo, 283 Mich\nApp 360, 373; 770 NW2d 68 (2009). \u201cJurors are presumed to follow their instructions, and it is\npresumed that instructions cure most errors.\u201d People v Mahone, 294 Mich. App. 208, 212; 816\nNW2d 436 (2011). \u201cJuries are not held to any rules of logic nor are they required to explain their\ndecisions.\u201d People v Putman, 309 Mich. App. 240, 251; 870 NW2d 593 (2015). Inconsistent\nverdicts within a single jury trial are permissible and do not require reversal absent a showing\nthat the jury was confused, misunderstood the instructions, or engaged in impermissible\ncompromise. See id.\n\n        The trial court here properly instructed the jury on how to consider the 20 felony charges\nagainst defendant. For the AWIM and AWIGBH charges, the trial court instructed the jury that\nit could find defendant not guilty, guilty of the greater offense of AWIM, or guilty of the\nlesser-included offense of AWIGBH\u2014but not both AWIM and AWIGBH. As to the charges for\nintentional discharge of a firearm, the trial court instructed the jury that it could find defendant\nnot guilty, guilty of the greater offense of intentional discharge of a firearm at a dwelling causing\nphysical injury, or guilty of the lesser-included offense of intentional discharge of a firearm at a\ndwelling\u2014but not both offenses. The verdict form then grouped the greater and lesser-included\noffenses together to simplify the selection process for the jury. We detect nothing improper\nabout these instructions; the trial court fairly presented the issues for the jurors, who are\npresumed to have followed the trial court\u2019s instructions. See Mahone, 294 Mich. App. at 212;\nChapo, 283 Mich. App. at 373.\n\n        Referring to his felony-firearm convictions, defendant points out that the jury erred in\n\u201creturn[ing] too many guilty verdicts.\u201d It is true that the jury found defendant guilty of\nfelony-firearm for his conviction of intentional discharge of a firearm at a dwelling, which was\n\n                                                -2-\n\fthe lesser-included offense for his conviction of intentional discharge of a firearm at a dwelling\ncausing physical injury. In other words, defendant was convicted of five counts of\nfelony-firearm when he should have only been convicted of four. Defendant argues that this\ndemonstrates the confusing nature of the jury instructions and verdict form, thereby rendering the\njury\u2019s verdict unreliable.\n\n         While defendant is correct that \u201c[i]nconsistent verdicts might be cause for reversal when\nit is evident that the jury was confused [or] did not understand the instructions,\u201d People v\nMcKinley, 168 Mich. App. 496, 510; 425 NW2d 460 (1988), the trial court\u2019s order granting\ndefendant\u2019s motion to set aside the unwarranted felony-firearm conviction corrected the jury\u2019s\nerror. And there is no other possible indication that the jury was confused about the instructions.\nIn fact, for defendant\u2019s other felony-firearm charges\u2014the ones corresponding to his three AWIM\ncharges and two additional AWIGBH charges\u2014the jury correctly found defendant not guilty\nafter acquitting him of the underlying felony. This demonstrates that the jury understood the trial\ncourt\u2019s instructions and verdict form, and that the jury carefully considered each charge\nseparately. In sum, there was nothing confusing or misleading about the jury instructions or\nverdict form that rendered the jury\u2019s verdict unreliable, and defendant\u2019s claim of error does not\nwarrant relief. 2\n\n                                   III. DOUBLE JEOPARDY\n\n       Defendant argues that some of his convictions violate his right against double jeopardy.\nWe disagree. \u201cA double jeopardy challenge presents a question of constitutional law reviewed\nde novo on appeal.\u201d People v Ackah-Essien, 311 Mich. App. 13, 30; 874 NW2d 172 (2015).\n\n       \u201cThe United States Constitution and the Michigan Constitution prohibit placing a\ndefendant twice in jeopardy for a single offense.\u201d People v Meshell, 265 Mich. App. 616, 628;\n696 NW2d 754 (2005); see also US Const, Am V; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15. The prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy provides three related protections: \u201c(1) it protects against a second\nprosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) it protects against a second prosecution for\n\n\n2\n  Defendant appears to argue that the prosecution \u201cover-charg[ed]\u201d defendant by indicting him\nfor 20 separate felonies for one criminal act. Because defendant failed to cite any authority\nsupporting his claim or otherwise rationalize the basis for his claim, we deem the issue\nabandoned. See People v Kevorkian, 248 Mich. App. 373, 389; 639 NW2d 291 (2001). But even\nbriefly considering the issue, \u201cit is generally permissible for a prosecutor to charge in a single\ninformation all offenses which do arise out of a single criminal transaction or occurrence.\u201d\nPeople v Herndon, 246 Mich. App. 371, 391; 633 NW2d 376 (2001). While charging a defendant\nwith 20 counts may be rare, each charge here was supported by the evidence, and defendant fails\nto provide any illegitimate reason for the prosecutor\u2019s charging decision. See People v\nBarksdale, 219 Mich. App. 484, 487; 556 NW2d 521 (1996) (explaining that the test for\nprosecutorial overcharging is whether the charging decision was made for reasons that were\nunconstitutional, illegal, or ultra vires). The sheer number of charges in a felony information\ndoes not establish that the prosecutor abused her power in charging a defendant.\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fthe same offense after conviction; and (3) it protects against multiple punishments for the same\noffense.\u201d People v Nutt, 469 Mich. 565, 574-575; 677 NW2d 1 (2004).\n\n        Defendant here argues that his convictions violate his protection against multiple\npunishments for the same offense. As this Court explained in People v Garland, 286 Mich. App.\n1, 4-5; 777 NW2d 732 (2009):\n\n              To determine whether a defendant has been subjected to multiple\n       punishments for the \u201csame offense,\u201d we must first look to determine whether the\n       Legislature expressed a clear intention that multiple punishments be imposed.\n       People v Smith, 478 Mich. 292, 316; 733 NW2d 351 (2007). Where the\n       Legislature clearly intends to impose such multiple punishments, there is no\n       double jeopardy violation. Id.\n\nFor example, this Court has held that when the Legislature stated that \u201c[i]mposition of a penalty\nunder this section does not bar imposition of a penalty under any other applicable law,\u201d it\nexpressed a clear intent to authorize multiple punishments, and, therefore, imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense was not a double-jeopardy violation. People v Conley, 270\nMich. App. 301, 311; 715 NW2d 377 (2006); People v Shipley, 256 Mich. App. 367, 378; 662\nNW2d 854 (2003).\n\n       Defendant argues that his convictions of AWIGBH and intentional discharge of a firearm\nat a dwelling causing physical injury are the same offense. Defendant also argues that his\nconviction for intentional discharge of a firearm at a dwelling causing physical injury is the same\noffense as his conviction for carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent.\n\n        The AWIGBH statute, MCL 750.84(3), reads: \u201cThis section does not prohibit a person\nfrom being charged with, convicted of, or punished for any other violation of law arising out of\nthe same conduct as the violation of this section.\u201d Likewise, the statute prohibiting the discharge\nof a firearm at a dwelling or occupied-structure provides: \u201cThis section does not prohibit an\nindividual from being charged with, convicted of, or punished for any other violation of law that\nis committed by that individual while violating this section.\u201d MCL 750.234b(8). In our opinion,\nthis statutory language shows the Legislature\u2019s clear intent to permit multiple punishments.\nThus, defendant\u2019s convictions for AWIGBH, intentional discharge of a firearm at a dwelling\ncausing physical injury, and carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent do not violate the\nconstitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                            /s/ David H. Sawyer\n                                                            /s/ Colleen A. O\u2019Brien\n                                                            /s/ Anica Letica\n\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\f",
