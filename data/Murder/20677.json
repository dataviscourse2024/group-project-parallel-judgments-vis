In need of money to jump-start his faltering drug business, Robert\nOstrander decided to murder one of his customers, Hansle Andrews, and he recruited his brother,\nMichael, to assist him. Robert lured Andrews into the woods with the promise of an incredible deal\nand there, with Michael\u2019s help, shot and killed him. In separate trials, juries found both brothers\nguilty of (1) conspiracy to distribute cocaine and marijuana; (2) murder with a firearm during and\nin relation to a drug trafficking crime; and (3) murder with a firearm during a violation of the Hobbs\nAct. They were each sentenced to life in prison without possibility of release. Both brothers appeal\nthe second and third convictions. In addition, Michael appeals the denial of his motion to suppress\n\n\n                                                  1\n\fNos. 04-1157/1380 United States v. Ostrander, et al.                                                      Page 2\n\n\nthe confession he gave to the FBI and the district judge\u2019s refusal to sentence him to a term of years\non the murder charge rather than the life sentence recommended by the jury or to compel the\nGovernment to make a motion for downward departure based on substantial assistance. He seeks\na remand for resentencing. We affirm the district judge on all points, writing for publication only\nwith regard to the sentencing discretion issue. All other issues raised by Appellants are addressed\nand decided in an unpublished appendix to this opinion.\n                                                        I\n        Robert Ostrander dealt drugs, primarily marijuana, using his younger brother, Michael, his\nwife, Misty, and his friend, Jon Mercer, as his primary salesmen. After a long period spent building\nhis business, Robert Ostrander lost a great deal of money sometime during the winter of 1999-2000.\nWithout operating capital, Robert Ostrander could not purchase drugs, and as a consequence his\nsalesmen had nothing to sell.\n         In early summer 2000, Robert decided to rebuild his drug business by luring a buyer with\nready cash into a supposed marijuana deal so lucrative that the buyer could not refuse and then\nrobbing and killing him. Robert identified as his victim Hansle Andrews, a man to whom he had\nregularly sold large quantities of marijuana and who was known for having ready money. Robert\nfirst proposed his plan to his friend, Jon Mercer, who refused to be part of the killing but who did\neventually plead guilty to being an accessory after the fact. When Mercer turned him down, Robert\nlooked to his brother Michael.\n        The killing went according to the plan Robert had outlined for Mercer and had explained to\nMichael at least a day or two in advance of the murder. On August 12, 2000, Michael borrowed his\ngirlfriend\u2019s car and drove out to the designated site in the middle of a secluded, wooded area. He\nwaited there for Robert to arrive with Andrews. Michael had knowingly transported a gun and two\npairs of latex gloves. At his trial, Robert testified that he personally placed the gun in the car. When\nRobert and Andrews arrived in Andrews\u2019s truck, Michael distracted Andrews with small talk while\nRobert went to Michael\u2019s car, put on a pair of gloves, and got the gun. Returning to Andrews, he\nasked whether the latter had brought the money, and 1when Andrews reached for his money, Robert\nshot him twice in the chest then once in the mouth. Michael and Robert buried the body in the\nwoods. Robert then drove Andrews\u2019s truck to Las Vegas in order to dispose of it. That evening\nMichael made arrangements with Mercer to get rid of Andrews\u2019s clothes, and he, along with his\ngirlfriend and another friend, took the gun and dropped it off a remote pier.\n        As will be discussed further in the appendix to this opinion, the plan began to unravel\nquickly, and Michael and Robert were eventually indicted in a third superseding indictment of\n(1) conspiracy to distribute cocaine and marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; (2) murder with\na firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and\n(j); and (3) murder with a firearm during a violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. On\nFebruary 21, 2003, the United States filed a notice of its intent to seek the death penalty against both\ndefendants. The two defendants were tried separately.\n         In the penalty phase of Michael\u2019s trial, the jury was given the choice of the death penalty,\nlife in prison without possibility of release, or any term of years at the discretion of the court. The\njury chose life in prison without possibility of release. Prior to sentencing, Michael asked the court\nto compel the United States to file a motion for downward departure under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) on\nthe basis of the substantial assistance Michael gave by testifying at his brother\u2019s trial. The court\ndenied the motion on the grounds that Michael did not testify in response to a plea agreement with\n\n        1\n           There was some testimony that Michael had claimed to have shot Andrews at least once. However, the bulk\nof the evidence suggests that Robert was the sole shooter.\n\fNos. 04-1157/1380 United States v. Ostrander, et al.                                             Page 3\n\n\nthe government and that it therefore had no discretion to compel a motion. The court accordingly\nsentenced Michael to life in prison without possibility of release. Michael timely appeals the judge\u2019s\nrefusal either to sentence him to a term of years on his own discretion or to compel the prosecution\nto move for a downward departure on the basis of substantial assistance.\n                                                 II\n         Michael makes two arguments that he should not have been sentenced to life in prison. First,\nhe claims that the district judge had the discretion to override the jury\u2019s sentence and instead\nsentence him to a term of years under the Sentencing Guidelines. Second, he claims that if the judge\nhad such discretion, he should have exercised it to compel the Government to make a motion for\nsubstantial assistance in light of the testimony Michael gave at his brother\u2019s trial. We find that the\ndistrict judge was correct to hold that he was required to impose the jury\u2019s recommendation of life\nimprisonment, and therefore we do not consider the denial of Michael\u2019s motion to compel.\n      We review de novo the district judge\u2019s interpretation of the relevant statutes. United States\nv. Campbell, 317 F.3d 597, 601 (6th Cir. 2003).\n      Michael was indicted and convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(j) for causing the death of Hansle\nAndrews with a firearm in the course of a drug trafficking offense. That section reads in relevant\npart:\n       A person who, in the course of a violation of subsection (c), causes the death of a\n       person through the use of a firearm, shall\u2013 (1) if the killing is a murder (as defined\n       in section 1111), be punished by death or by imprisonment for any term of years or\n       for life . . . .\nSection 1111(a) of Title 18 defines murder and section 1111(b) distinguishes between first-degree\nand second-degree murder. First-degree murder, it instructs, is punishable only \u201cby death or by\nimprisonment for life.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111(b). Second-degree murder is punishable by life or any\nterm of years in prison. Ibid.\n         Michael was sentenced under the Federal Death Penalty Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3593(e), according\nto which the jury, after considering the aggravating and the mitigating factors, \u201cby unanimous vote\n. . . shall recommend whether the defendant should be sentenced to death, to life imprisonment\nwithout possibility of release or some other lesser sentence.\u201d Id. Having been instructed on these\nthree options, the jury chose to recommend life in prison without possibility of release. Once the\njury made its recommendation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3594 guided the judge in the imposition of the sentence.\nThat statute reads in pertinent part:\n       Upon a recommendation under section 3593(e) that the defendant should be\n       sentenced to death or life imprisonment without possibility of release, the court shall\n       sentence the defendant accordingly. Otherwise, the court shall impose any lesser\n       sentence that is authorized by law.\n(Emphasis added).\n         Michael argues that the judge had the discretion to ignore the jury\u2019s sentencing\nrecommendation and instead sentence him to a term of years. He asserts that the statute of\nconviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(j), authorized the imposition of imprisonment for a term of years, so\nthat if \u00a7 3594 removed the judge\u2019s discretion to exercise that possible penalty, the \u201cterm of years\nlanguage\u201d in \u00a7 924(j) would be surplusage. As part of this argument, he contends that the reference\nto 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111 in \u00a7 924(j) serves a definitional purpose only and should not be used for penalty\n\fNos. 04-1157/1380 United States v. Ostrander, et al.                                             Page 4\n\n\npurposes. He also argues that the words \u201crecommend\u201d in \u00a7 3593(e) and \u201cshall sentence . . .\naccordingly\u201d in \u00a7 3594 should be read as precatory rather than mandatory.\n        Following the Fourth Circuit, we agree with Michael that \u00a7 924(j) \u201cincorporates only the\ndefinition of murder contained in section 1111[(a)].\u201d United States v. Young, 248 F.3d 260, 275 (4th\nCir. 2001). This interpretation prevents a first-degree murder conviction under \u00a7 924(j) from\nbecoming a de facto mandatory minimum life sentence. However, this alone does not give the\ndistrict court judge discretion to override the \u201crecommendation\u201d of the jury and sentence the\ndefendant to a term of years on his own volition. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3593(e).\n        In the case at hand, the jury had the option to permit the judge to sentence Michael to a term\nof years but chose instead to recommend that he receive life in prison without possibility of release.\nPrior to sentencing, Michael argued that the judge could override that recommendation and sentence\nhim to a term of years if the Government made a motion for downward departure on account of the\nsubstantial assistance Michael gave in testifying against his brother at the latter\u2019s trial. The district\njudge disagreed, interpreting the language of \u00a7 3594, (\u201c[u]pon a recommendation under section\n3593(e) that the defendant should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without possibility of\nrelease, the court shall sentence the defendant accordingly\u201d), to mean that once the jury\nrecommended a life sentence for Michael, he was obligated to apply that sentence, and he had no\ndiscretion to deviate. Michael, by contrast, argues that the \u201csentence accordingly\u201d language in\n\u00a7 3594 refers to the statute of conviction and not to the jury\u2019s recommendation under \u00a7 3593(e).\nSuch a reading would render the following sentence of \u00a7 3594, \u201c[o]therwise, the court shall impose\nany lesser sentence that is authorized by law,\u201d surplusage because the statute of conviction already\nincludes a provision for a possible sentence to a term of years.\n        Michael also contends that the \u201crecommend\u201d language in \u00a7\u00a7 3593(e) and 3594 is precatory\nrather than binding on the judge. The case law does not support this interpretation. See Jones v.\nUnited States, 527 U.S. 373, 380-81 (1999) (stating that the court has discretion to sentence to a\nterm of years only when the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict of death or life imprisonment);\nUnited States v. Jackson, 327 F.3d 273, 286 (4th Cir. 2003) (\u201cIf such a recommendation [for the\ndeath penalty] is made, the court must follow the recommendation and sentence the defendant to\ndeath.\u201d); In re United States, 197 F.3d 310, 311 (8th Cir. 1999) (factfinder makes ultimate choice\nof sentence). Furthermore, the judge instructed the jury that if they chose to recommend the death\npenalty or life imprisonment, he was obligated to impose that sentence. Therefore, they were not\nunder any illusions as to their responsibility. See Romano v. Oklahoma, 512 U.S. 1, 8 (1994) (\u201cthe\njury must not be misled regarding the role it plays in the sentencing decision.\u201d). Finally, even if the\njury\u2019s recommendation were merely advisory, \u00a7 3594\u2019s instruction that the judge \u201cshall sentence the\ndefendant accordingly\u201d turns it into a mandate. Michael\u2019s assertion that \u201cshall\u201d does not create a\nmandatory command simply flies in the face of standard interpretation. See, e.g., Lopez v. Davis,\n531 U.S. 230, 241 (2001) (\u201ca mandatory \u2018shall\u2019 . . . impose[s] discretionless obligations\u201d); Lexecon\nInc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U.S. 26, 35 (1998) (\u201cthe mandatory \u2018shall\u2019 . . .\nnormally creates an obligation impervious to judicial discretion.\u201d); Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460,\n471 (1983) (calling shall \u201clanguage of an unmistakably mandatory character\u201d).\n        At sentencing, the jury was appropriately instructed that it could recommend a sentence of\ndeath, life without the possibility of release, or a term of years, pursuant to \u00a7 924(j).\n                                                  III\n        For the foregoing reasons, we find that the trial judge correctly held that he had no discretion\nto sentence Michael to imprisonment for a term of years after the jury had recommended life in\nprison without possibility of release, and we AFFIRM the sentence imposed.\n\f",
