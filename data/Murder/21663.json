Force (argued),\nDeputy Public Defender, Phoenix, Attorneys for Samkeita Jahveh Jurden\n\f                             STATE V. JURDEN\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nJUSTICE BOLICK authored the opinion of the Court, in which CHIEF\nJUSTICE BALES, VICE CHIEF JUSTICE PELANDER, and JUSTICES\nBRUTINEL and TIMMER joined.\n\n\nJUSTICE BOLICK, opinion of the Court:\n\n\u00b61            We granted review to determine whether multiple\nconvictions under Arizona\u2019s resisting arrest statute, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2508, that\narise from a single, uninterrupted course of conduct constitute multiple\nconvictions for the same offense in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nWe hold that, regardless of the number of officers involved, \u00a7 13-2508 only\npermits one conviction when a defendant resists an arrest in the course of a\nsingle, continuous event.\n\n             I.     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\u00b62            In September 2012, Samkeita Jahveh Jurden walked into a\ndepartment store shirtless, shoeless, and with an unleashed dog. The\nstore\u2019s security guard contacted the police after Jurden refused to leave.\nJurden remained even after two officers arrived and also asked him to\nleave. When the officers attempted to arrest Jurden, he resisted by biting\nand kicking one officer and flailing and pulling his arms away from the\nother. The officers struggled with Jurden for nearly four minutes before\nsubduing and handcuffing him. The resistance and arrest formed one,\nuninterrupted course of conduct.\n\n\u00b63            A grand jury indicted Jurden on two counts of aggravated\nassault, one count of criminal trespass, and two counts of resisting arrest\nunder A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2508(A)(1)\u2014one for each officer resisted. A jury found\nJurden guilty on all charges except one aggravated assault count.\n\n\u00b64             The trial court sentenced Jurden to concurrent rather than\nconsecutive terms of imprisonment. In accordance with A.R.S. \u00a7 13-711(A),\nthe trial judge explained his reasoning:\n\n      [A]ll the more when I watch the video in this case, it\u2019s all one\n      incident and it starts and it just continues. . . . Perhaps, if there\n      were some lengthy delay between one event and another,\n      there might be a better justification of the idea of consecutive\n      sentences. But this all starts and ends in just one big melee,\n      really, and so the idea of consecutive sentences here doesn\u2019t\n      seem appropriate to me, under the circumstances.\n                                       2\n\f                             STATE V. JURDEN\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\u00b65            On appeal, Jurden argued that his two convictions under \u00a7 13-\n2508 for resisting arrest arose from a single offense and, therefore, his\nsecond conviction arose from the same offense and violated the Double\nJeopardy Clause. In a split decision, the court of appeals agreed and\nvacated one of the convictions. State v. Jurden, 237 Ariz. 423, 429 \u00b6 21, 352\nP.3d 455, 461 (App. 2015).\n\n\u00b66            We granted review because whether \u00a7 13-2508 authorizes\nmultiple convictions and punishments for resisting arrest in one,\nuninterrupted course of conduct that involves more than one officer\npresents a recurring issue of statewide importance. We have jurisdiction\npursuant to article 6, section 5(3) of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S.\n\u00a7 12-120.24.\n\n                             II.    DISCUSSION\n\n\u00b67            This case presents an issue of statutory interpretation, which\nwe review de novo. Lubin v. Thomas, 213 Ariz. 496, 498 \u00b6 13, 144 P.3d 510,\n512 (2006). However, it also implicates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the\nFifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because Jurden failed\nto raise the double jeopardy objection in the trial court, we review only for\nfundamental error. See State v. Miller, 234 Ariz. 31, 36 \u00b6 7, 316 P.3d 1219,\n1224 (2013); State v. Bolton, 182 Ariz. 290, 297, 896 P.2d 830, 837 (1995). A\nconviction or sentence that violates the Double Jeopardy Clause constitutes\nfundamental error. State v. McGill, 213 Ariz. 147, 153 \u00b6 21, 140 P.3d 930, 936\n(2006).\n\n\u00b68           The parties disagree whether a defendant may be convicted\nunder \u00a7 13-2508 of multiple counts of resisting arrest resulting from a single,\ncontinuous act of resistance involving multiple officers. Section 13-2508\nstates:\n\n       A. A person commits resisting arrest by intentionally\n       preventing or attempting to prevent a person reasonably\n       known to him to be a peace officer, acting under color of such\n       peace officer\u2019s official authority, from effecting an arrest by:\n\n       1. Using or threatening to use physical force against the\n          peace officer or another.\n\n       2. Using any other means creating a substantial risk of\n          causing physical injury to the peace officer or another.\n                                      3\n\f                              STATE V. JURDEN\n                             Opinion of the Court\n\n\n       3. Engaging in passive resistance.\n\n       B. Resisting arrest pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 or 2\n       of this section is a class 6 felony. Resisting arrest pursuant to\n       subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section is a class 1\n       misdemeanor.\n\n       C. For the purposes of this section, \u201cpassive resistance\u201d means\n       a nonviolent physical act or failure to act that is intended to\n       impede, hinder or delay the effecting of an arrest.\n\n\u00b69             The State argues that \u00a7 13-2508(A)(1) is victim-directed,\nmeaning a separate offense is committed for each peace officer against\nwhom physical force is directed. Jurden argues that the statute is event-\ndirected, so that the single, continuous act of resisting arrest constitutes one\noffense, regardless of how many officers were resisted. If Jurden is correct,\nthen subjecting him to conviction and punishment for two counts of\nresisting arrest violates the prohibition against double jeopardy.\n\n\u00b610             The Double Jeopardy Clause protects against multiple\npunishments for the same offense. State v. Eagle, 196 Ariz. 188, 190 \u00b6 6, 994\nP.2d 395, 397 (2000); see also Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 688 (1980).1\nThe protection against double jeopardy may be triggered in two contexts.\nFirst, if the same conduct is held to constitute a violation of two different\ncriminal statutes, \u201cthe test to be applied to determine whether there are two\noffenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact\nwhich the other does not.\u201d Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304\n(1932); accord United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 696 (1993); see also Eagle,\n196 Ariz. at 190 \u00b6 6, 994 P.2d at 397; cf. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-116 (requiring concurrent\nsentences for a single \u201cact or omission which is made punishable in\ndifferent ways by different sections of the laws\u201d).\n\n\u00b611           Second, if multiple violations of the same statute are based on\nthe same conduct, there can be only one conviction if there is a single\noffense. See, e.g., State v. Powers, 200 Ariz. 123, 125 \u00b6 5, 23 P.3d 668, 670\n\n\n1On appeal, Jurden raised article 2, section 10 of the Arizona Constitution,\nwhich also protects against double jeopardy, but did not separately argue\nthat provision. This Court has previously indicated that the provision is\ncoextensive with the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause, see Eagle,\n196 Ariz. at 190 \u00b6 5, 994 P.2d at 397, a holding that we are not called upon\nto reconsider here.\n                                       4\n\f                             STATE V. JURDEN\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\n(App. 2001), approved, 200 Ariz. 363, 26 P.3d 1134 (2001). In such cases, the\nstatutory definition of the crime determines the scope of conduct for which\na discrete charge can be brought, which the United States Supreme Court\nhas referred to as the \u201callowable unit of prosecution.\u201d United States v.\nUniversal C.I.T. Credit Corp., 344 U.S. 218, 221 (1952). Because our decisions\nhave not definitively addressed the analysis pertaining to \u201cunit of\nprosecution\u201d cases, we endeavor to do so here.\n\n\u00b612            The seminal United States Supreme Court case is Ladner v.\nUnited States, 358 U.S. 169 (1958), in which the Court reviewed a consecutive\nsentence on a second assault charge where the defendant discharged his\nweapon once but wounded two officers. Examining the federal assault\nstatute, the Court asked: \u201cDid Congress mean that the single discharge of a\nshotgun would constitute one assault, and thus only one offense, regardless\nof the number of officers affected, or did Congress define a separate offense\nfor each federal officer affected by the doing of the act?\u201d Id. at 173. The\nCourt examined the statutory language, history, and purpose, which it\nfound inconclusive. Id. at 173\u201377. The Court reasoned, \u201c[A]n interpretation\nthat there are as many assaults committed as there are officers affected\nwould produce incongruous results.\u201d Id. at 177. Under such a reading, a\ndefendant who seriously injured an officer would receive a maximum\nsentence of ten years, \u201cbut if he points a gun at five officers, putting all of\nthem in apprehension of harm, he would commit five offenses punishable\nby 50 years\u2019 imprisonment, even though he does not fire the gun and no\nofficer actually suffers injury.\u201d Id. Finally, the Court applied the \u201cpolicy of\nlenity,\u201d in which the Court \u201cwill not interpret a federal criminal statute so\nas to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an\ninterpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress\nintended.\u201d Id. at 178. These factors caused the Court to conclude that the\ndischarge of the shotgun constituted only one assault. Id.\n\n\u00b613          Other state supreme courts have applied these criteria in \u201cunit\nof prosecution\u201d cases. In Commonwealth v. Rabb, the Massachusetts\nSupreme Judicial Court instructed:\n\n       The appropriate inquiry in a case like this . . . asks what \u201cunit\n       of prosecution\u201d was intended by the Legislature as the\n       punishable act. . . . The inquiry requires us to look to the\n       language and purpose of the statutes, to see whether they\n       speak directly to the issue of the appropriate unit of\n       prosecution, and if they do not, to ascertain that unit, keeping\n       in mind that any ambiguity that arises in the process must be\n       resolved, under the rule of lenity, in the defendant\u2019s favor.\n                                      5\n\f                              STATE V. JURDEN\n                             Opinion of the Court\n\n725 N.E.2d 1036, 1041 (Mass. 2000); accord State v. Schoonover, 133 P.3d 48,\n65 (Kan. 2006) (\u201c[I]n unit of prosecution cases the Court applies a rule of\nlenity.\u201d).\n\n\u00b614            The Arizona cases cited by the State are not helpful in\ndetermining the unit of prosecution because they neither address double\njeopardy nor discuss the unit of prosecution in \u00a7 13-2508. See State v.\nMitchell, 204 Ariz. 216, 62 P.3d 616 (App. 2003) (determining the meaning\nof \u201ceffecting an arrest\u201d); State v. Sorkhabi, 202 Ariz. 450, 452 \u00b6 9, 46 P.3d 1071,\n1073 (App. 2002) (finding that resisting arrest is not a victimless crime, but\nrather a crime against a person where a \u201c[d]efendant must use or threaten\nto use physical force or any other means that creates a substantial risk of\ncausing physical injury to the peace officer\u201d); State v. Womack, 174 Ariz. 108,\n111, 847 P.2d 609, 612 (App. 1992) (finding that the statute did not apply to\na defendant who led officers on a high speed chase because the statute\nprohibits threats or assaultive behavior directed toward an arresting officer,\nwhereas the chase was meant to put as much distance as possible between\nthe defendant and the officers).\n\n\u00b615            Our objective in interpreting statutes is to give effect to the\nlegislature\u2019s intent. See Baker v. Univ. Physicians Healthcare, 231 Ariz. 379,\n383 \u00b6 8, 296 P.3d 42, 46 (2013). If the statutory language is unambiguous,\nwe apply it as written without further analysis. Id. If, however, the statute\nis subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, we consider\nsecondary principles of statutory interpretation, such as the context of the\nstatute, the language used, the subject matter, its historical background, its\neffects and consequences, and its spirit and purpose. Id.\n\n\u00b616            We find \u00a7 13-2508 is ambiguous because it may be reasonably\nread to designate either an event-directed or victim-directed unit of\nprosecution. We agree with the court of appeals that \u00a7 13-2508(A) may be\nreasonably read as defining the offense as intentionally preventing or\nattempting to prevent an arrest, with subsections (1), (2), and (3) describing\nthe various ways to resist a single arrest. Jurden, 237 Ariz. at 426 \u00b6 10, 352\nP.3d at 458. But \u00a7 13-2508(A) may also be reasonably read as defining the\noffense as intentionally preventing or attempting to prevent a peace officer\nfrom effecting an arrest, where the unit of prosecution focuses on each\nofficer resisted.\n\n\u00b617           Because the language of \u00a7 13-2508(A) is reasonably\nsusceptible to two differing interpretations, we must turn to secondary\nstatutory construction methods to ascertain the unit of prosecution.\nUtilizing those methods, we hold that \u00a7 13-2508 describes an event-directed\n                                        6\n\f                              STATE V. JURDEN\n                             Opinion of the Court\n\nunit of prosecution that prohibits multiple convictions and punishments for\nresisting arrest when, as here, the counts stem from one, uninterrupted\nevent.\n\n\u00b618           The legislative history of the statute is not particularly\nhelpful. Before 1977, Arizona\u2019s resisting arrest statute provided that a\nperson illegally arrested could resist the arrest, using whatever force\nnecessary, short of killing the arresting officer. Dugan v. State, 54 Ariz. 247,\n250, 94 P.2d 873, 874 (1939). In 1977, the Arizona Legislature enacted a new\ncriminal code that included \u00a7 13-2508, which prohibited a person from\nresisting any arrest, legal or not. 1977 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 142, \u00a7 86 (1st\nReg. Sess.). In 2012, the legislature amended the statute to include passive\nresistance as a means to resist arrest. 2012 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 265, \u00a7 1 (2d\nReg. Sess.); \u00a7 13-2508(A)(3). However, neither party nor this Court has\nfound in this history any indication that the legislature intended the statute\nto describe an event-directed or instead a victim-directed offense.\n\n\u00b619            Turning to the statute\u2019s purpose, we find that \u00a7 13-2508\naddresses multiple objectives. There is no question that \u00a7 13-2508 seeks to\nprotect peace officers. See Mitchell, 204 Ariz. at 219 \u00b6 16, 62 P.3d at 619 (\u201cThe\npurpose of the resisting arrest statute is to protect peace officers and citizens\nfrom substantial risk of physical injury.\u201d). But the statute also seeks to\nprotect the authority of the state. That goal is reflected in the statutory\nlanguage, which requires that the resistance be directed against a person\n\u201cacting under color of . . . official authority.\u201d A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2508(A). As the\ncourt of appeals found, this serves to \u201ccriminalize a person\u2019s conduct that\npresents a risk of harm in a particular context\u2014when the actor is interfering\nwith the peace officer\u2019s efforts to exercise state authority.\u201d Jurden, 237 Ariz.\nat 428 \u00b6 18, 352 P.3d at 460.\n\n\u00b620           Focusing on the event also finds support in the common law,\nwhich recognized that the crime of resisting arrest is \u201can offense against the\nState and not personally against the officers.\u201d Purnell v. State, 827 A.2d 68,\n80 (Md. 2003), cited with approval in State v. Le Noble, 216 Ariz. 180, 182\u201383\n\u00b6 12, 164 P.3d 686, 688\u201389 (App. 2007). Insofar as resisting arrest is an\noffense against the state\u2019s authority, the unit of prosecution would not\ndepend on the number of officers resisted, but rather on each arrest resisted\nin defiance of state authority.\n\n\u00b621            An event-directed unit of prosecution satisfies both purposes\nof the statute. The purpose of protecting officers is advanced with an event-\ndirected offense because whether a person resists one or several officers in\na continuous event, he may be charged with and convicted of resisting\n                                       7\n\f                              STATE V. JURDEN\n                             Opinion of the Court\n\narrest. A single charge of resisting arrest in each uninterrupted course of\nconduct satisfies the purpose of mandating submission to the state.\n\n\u00b622           The statute\u2019s context, structure, and effects also support our\nconclusion that \u00a7 13-2508 is an event-directed offense. In 2012, the\nlegislature added passive resistance to the offenses covered by the statute.\n2012 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 265, \u00a7 1; \u00a7 13-2508(A)(3). Passive resistance is\ndefined as \u201ca nonviolent physical act or failure to act that is intended to\nimpede, hinder or delay the effecting of an arrest.\u201d A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2508(C).\nThis subsection does not require action directed against an officer, but\nserves to punish anyone who impedes the arrest, which is a function of the\nstate\u2019s authority. This language describes a unit of prosecution grounded\nin the event of the arrest, not the officers.\n\n\u00b623           The legislature\u2019s addition of passive resistance also makes it\nclear that a victim-directed reading of \u00a7 13-2508 could potentially lead to\nunintended outcomes. For example, a person who simply does not open\nthe door when officers attempt to arrest him commits passive resistance\nunder \u00a7 13-2508(C). Many officers may break open the door, find the\nsuspect, and \u201ceffect\u201d the arrest under \u00a7 13-2508(A).2 Although the arrest\ncould have been made by a single officer, the arrestee would nonetheless\nbe subject to a resisting\u2013arrest charge for each officer who took part in the\narrest. Multiple convictions would not further the statute\u2019s purposes.\n\n\u00b624             Section 13-2508\u2019s placement within the overall criminal\nstatutory scheme also demonstrates a legislative intent to deter and punish\nthose who interfere with state authority rather than those who attack\nindividual officers. See Grant v. Bd. of Regents of Univs. and State Colls. of\nAriz., 133 Ariz. 527, 529, 652 P.2d 1374, 1376 (1982). Section 13-2508 is placed\nin the \u201cEscape and Related Offenses\u201d section of Arizona\u2019s criminal code.\nA.R.S. tit. 13, ch. 25. Resisting arrest is placed in the same chapter as escape,\nA.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-2502\u20132504; promoting prison contraband, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2505;\nfailure to appear, A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-2506\u20132507; resisting an order directing,\nregulating or controlling a motor vehicle, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2509; hindering\nprosecution, A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-2510\u20132512; failure to discharge duties, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-\n2513; and promoting secure care facility contraband, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2514.\nThese statutes focus on violations of state authority rather than\n\n\n2The issue of what \u201ceffecting an arrest\u201d means was explicitly analyzed in\nMitchell, 204 Ariz. at 218-19 \u00b6\u00b6 11\u201318, 62 P.3d at 618\u201319. The court\ndetermined that effecting an arrest under \u00a7 13-2508 \u201cconnotes successful,\neffective restraint or submission of the person,\u201d which is to be determined\non a case-by-case basis. Id. at 219 \u00b6 15, 62 P.3d at 619.\n                                       8\n\f                             STATE V. JURDEN\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nconcentrating on the individual state actors who may be involved in the\ncrime. Although not dispositive, the placement of \u00a7 13-2508 within a\nchapter that otherwise only deals with offenses against the state supports\nan inference of legislative intent to create an event-directed unit of\nprosecution that focuses on punishing those who interfere with state\nauthority.\n\n\u00b625            We find further support for our decision that \u00a7 13-2508\ndescribes an event-directed offense in complementary Arizona statutes.\nEach individual officer is protected under Arizona\u2019s assault statutes, A.R.S.\n\u00a7\u00a7 13-1203\u20131204, which are notably placed in a separate chapter of the code\nfrom the resisting arrest statute. These statutes separately and properly\ncriminalize victim-directed offenses when a person resists officers\nattempting to effect an arrest. Therefore, the goal of protecting individual\nofficers does not require interpreting \u00a7 13-2508 as a victim-focused offense\nbecause a criminal sanction already exists under \u00a7\u00a7 13-1203\u20131204 for\ninjuries or threat of injuries to officers. Indeed, Jurden was charged with\ntwo counts of assault and convicted of one count of aggravated assault\nunder these two statutes. Moreover, a simple assault under \u00a7 13-1203\nbecomes a more serious aggravated assault if the assailant knows or should\nknow that the victim is a peace officer engaged in executing his official\nduties. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1204(A)(8).\n\n\u00b626            In sum, we conclude that \u00a7 13-2508 yields two reasonable\ninterpretations. It can be read as either containing an event-directed or\nvictim-directed unit of prosecution. The statute serves both to punish\nresistance to state authority and to protect officers. But its primary purpose\nis the first, and allowing multiple criminal convictions could produce\nunintended and unfair results. This reading does not work any hardship\nupon law enforcement, given that one count of resisting arrest can be\ncoupled in appropriate circumstances with assault charges, as was the case\nhere. For all the reasons set forth above, we conclude the legislature did\nnot intend, and the Double Jeopardy Clause does not allow, multiple\nconvictions and punishments under \u00a7 13-2508 for a single, continuous act\nof resisting arrest.\n\n                         III.   CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b627           For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the opinion of the court\nof appeals, vacate Jurden\u2019s second conviction for resisting arrest, and affirm\nthe remaining convictions and sentences.\n\n\n\n                                      9\n\f",
