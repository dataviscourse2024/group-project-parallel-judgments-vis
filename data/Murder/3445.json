            "opinion_text": "\nMEMORANDUM *\nPetitioner appeals a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirming a decision of an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denying petitioner\u2019s application for cancellation of removal under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (\u201cNACARA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160, as amended by Pub.L. No. 105-139, 111 Stat. 2644. We have jurisdiction to review legal, nondiscretionary determinations of the BIA and any constitutional claims. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b); see Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, 277 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir. 2002); Antonio-Cruz v. INS, 147 F.3d 1129, 1130 (9th Cir.1998).\nThe BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of cancellation of removal on two separate grounds: (1) that the government had overcome petitioner\u2019s presumption of extreme hardship upon removal; and (2) as a discretionary determination, that petitioner should not receive the extraordinary remedy of cancellation of removal because he had committed a gang-related murder when he was a juvenile. Even assuming that the BIA\u2019s application of NACARA\u2019s presumption of extreme hardship were a renewable determination, we are still divested of jurisdiction to review the denial of cancellation because the BIA alternatively upheld the denial in the exercise of its discretion which we may not review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B).\nPetitioner\u2019s reliance on In re Denison, 22 I &amp; N. Dec. 1362 (BIA 2000), is misplaced. In re Denison holds that \u201cfindings of juvenile delinquency are not convictions *305for immigration purposes,\u201d id. at 1365, but it does not forbid an IJ from considering such juvenile acts at all, along -with any other relevant information, when making a discretionary determination.\nThe record also does not support petitioner\u2019s contention that the IJ was biased, in violation of petitioner\u2019s due process rights. The IJ and BIA, taking into account the fact that petitioner had committed murder as a juvenile, determined that petitioner should not receive the discretionary relief of cancellation of removal. There is no evidence of bias.\nPetitioner\u2019s argument that the BIA\u2019s consideration of In re Jean, 23 I &amp; N Dec. 373 (A.G.2002), violated his due process rights because that decision unconstitutionally limits the BIA\u2019s discretion is likewise meritless. Even assuming that the Attorney General could violate due process by limiting the BIA\u2019s discretion, In re Jean only provides guidance for the application of discretion.\nPETITION DENIED.\n\n This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n\n",
