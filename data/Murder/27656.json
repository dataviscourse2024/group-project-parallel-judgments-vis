We will affirm, but we clarify that the dismissal is without prejudice to\n\nMurrell\u2019s ability to assert certain state-law claims in state court.\n\n                                               I.\n\n      In 2008, Murrell was convicted of first-degree murder and other crimes in\n\nPennsylvania state court. Murrell later asserted numerous grounds for relief during post-\n\nconviction proceedings in both state and federal court. Among those grounds was a\n\nclaim that, during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor directed the court\n\nreporter to stop typing and then improperly argued to the jury that it should find Murrell\n\nguilty \u201cby the power of God.\u201d Murrell did not obtain relief on that claim. He did,\n\nhowever, obtain relief on three other and unrelated claims. On the basis of those claims,\n\na federal habeas court vacated Murrell\u2019s convictions but stayed its order to give the\n\nCommonwealth an opportunity to retry him. Rather than proceed to another trial, Murrell\n\npleaded guilty to third-degree murder and was later released from prison.\n\n\n\n*\n This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not\nconstitute binding precedent.\n                                              2\n\f      Shortly before his release, Murrell filed the civil action at issue here seeking relief\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1985 and 1985 on the basis of the same \u201cpower of God\u201d claim\n\nreferenced above. Murrell claimed that virtually everyone involved in his criminal trial\n\nand post-conviction proceedings conspired to ensure that the alleged \u201cpower of God\u201d\n\nstatement was not transcribed. Toward that end, he named as defendants (inter alia) the\n\njudges who presided over his trial and other proceedings, the prosecutor, the court\n\nreporter who allegedly followed the prosecutor\u2019s direction, and the lawyers who\n\nrepresented him in these proceedings. Murrell alleged that these defendants conspired to\n\ndeprive him of his constitutional rights to due process and access to the courts.\n\n      Murrell filed his complaint in forma pauperis, so a Magistrate Judge screened it\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). The Magistrate Judge then recommended dismissing\n\nMurrell\u2019s complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) on the ground that it failed to state a claim\n\non which relief may be granted. The Magistrate Judge reasoned, among other things, that\n\nthe judicial defendants, the prosecutorial defendants, and the court reporter were all\n\nentitled to absolute immunity. The Magistrate Judge further concluded that any\n\namendment of Murrell\u2019s complaint would be futile. Over Murrell\u2019s objections, the\n\nDistrict Court agreed and dismissed his complaint. Murrell appeals. 1\n\n\n\n1\n We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). See Allah v. Seiverling, 229 F.3d\n220, 223 (3d Cir. 2000). We review the denial of leave to amend a complaint for abuse\nof discretion. See Great W. Mining & Min. Co. v. Fox Rothschild LLP, 615 F.3d 159,\n163 (3d Cir. 2010).\n                                            3\n\f                                             II.\n\n       We will affirm substantially for the reasons explained by the Magistrate Judge and\n\nthe District Court. We briefly address four issues.\n\n       First, Murrell challenges the District Court\u2019s ruling that his claims against the\n\njudicial and prosecutorial defendants are barred by absolute immunity. We agree with\n\nthe District Court that the judicial defendants were immune because Murrell alleges\n\nnothing suggesting that they acted \u201cin the clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d Capogrosso\n\nv. Sup. Ct. of N.J., 588 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (quotation marks\n\nomitted). We further agree that Murrell\u2019s prosecutor was immune because the prosecutor\n\nallegedly made the statements at issue while \u201cpresenting a state\u2019s case at trial.\u201d Fogle v.\n\nSokol, 957 F.3d 148, 160 (3d Cir. 2020).\n\n       Murrell argues that immunity does not apply because the prosecutor\u2019s alleged\n\nstatements transformed his judicial proceeding into a \u201creligious event.\u201d He relies on Doe\n\nv. Phillips, 81 F.3d 1204 (2d Cir. 1996), but that case is inapposite. In that case, the court\n\nheld that a prosecutor was not entitled to immunity from allegations that he required the\n\nplaintiff, outside the context of any judicial proceeding, to swear to her innocence on a\n\nBible in church in order to obtain the dismissal of pending charges. See id. at 1210.\n\nMurrell\u2019s prosecutor, by contrast, made his alleged statements at trial. That circumstance\n\nbrings the prosecutor\u2019s alleged conduct squarely within the bounds of immunity. See\n\nFogle, 957 F.3d at 160. That circumstance also distinguishes the other authority on\n\n\n                                              4\n\fwhich Murrell relies. See, e.g., Gagan v. Norton, 35 F.3d 1473, 1474-75 (10th Cir.\n\n1994); Ryland v. Shapiro, 708 F.2d 967, 975 (5th Cir. 1983).\n\n       Second, Murrell challenges the District Court\u2019s extension of absolute judicial\n\nimmunity to the court reporter. As Murrell argues, the Supreme Court has held that court\n\nreporters are not shielded by absolute immunity for their own alleged conduct. See\n\nAntoine v. Byers & Anderson, Inc., 508 U.S. 429, 434-37 (1993). Neither the Magistrate\n\nJudge nor the District Court addressed Antoine. Nevertheless, we will affirm the\n\ndismissal of Murrell\u2019s claims against the court reporter on the ground that she was\n\nprotected, not by absolute immunity, but by qualified immunity.\n\n       Murrell alleges that the court reporter paused her transcription of the trial at the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s instruction (and thus presumably with the tacit approval of both Murrell\u2019s\n\nown counsel and the presiding judge). Murrell has not cited anything suggesting that a\n\ncourt reporter has a constitutional duty to continue transcribing a trial under these\n\ncircumstances. Assuming without deciding that such a duty might exist, however, these\n\ncircumstances entitle the court reporter to at least qualified immunity. Cf. Green v.\n\nMaraio, 722 F.2d 1013, 1019 (2d Cir. 1983) (holding that a court reporter was entitled to\n\nqualified immunity for following a judge\u2019s alleged instruction to alter a transcript).\n\n       Third, the District Court dismissed some of Murrell\u2019s claims on the ground that he\n\nhad not plausibly alleged any conspiracy among the named defendants. Murrell argued\n\nbelow that he should be allowed to amend his complaint, but he did not specify how he\n\ncould do so. Nor has he mentioned the possibility of amendment on appeal. We\n                                              5\n\fnevertheless have considered the issue of amendment, and we see nothing suggesting that\n\namendment would be anything other than futile.\n\n       Finally, in Murrell\u2019s complaint, he asked that it be \u201cforwarded to state court for a\n\ntort lawsuit\u201d against his various counsel if the District Court determined that they were\n\nnot conspirators for \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 purposes. The Magistrate Judge concluded that\n\nMurrell did not actually assert any state-law claims in his complaint. Murrell argued in\n\nhis objections below, and argues on appeal, that he asserted state-law claims against his\n\ncounsel for fraud, malpractice, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n       We agree that Murrell\u2019s pro se complaint can be construed to assert these state-law\n\nclaims. Thus, although the District Court did not mention them, we construe its order of\n\ndismissal as declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over these claims under 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1367. That means that the District Court\u2019s dismissal is without prejudice to\n\nMurrell\u2019s ability to assert these claims in state court. We express no opinion on the\n\nmerits of these claims or on whether it is otherwise proper for Murrell to raise them.\n\n                                            III.\n\n       For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. Murrell\u2019s\n\nmotions are denied. 2\n\n\n\n\n2\n One of Murrell\u2019s motions requests a certificate of appealability. A certificate of\nappealability is not required because this appeal is not from a habeas corpus proceeding\nor a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). We nevertheless\nhave considered the substance of Murrell\u2019s motion in reaching our disposition.\n                                             6\n\f",
