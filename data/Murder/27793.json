Landis\n                                No. 20200323\n\nPer Curiam.\n\n[\u00b61] Douglas Landis appeals a district court criminal judgment following a\njury verdict finding him guilty of two counts of negligent homicide. We\nsummarily affirm under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(3).\n\n[\u00b62] In the early morning hours of October 5, 2018, Landis was involved in a\nhead-on collision that resulted in the death of two individuals. Landis\u2019s time\ncard from the day prior stated that he had started work at 2:00 a.m. and ended\nwork at 2:00 p.m. Business records, including bills of lading, showed that\nLandis continued to pick up and deliver frac-sand past 2:00 p.m. These records\nshowed that Landis had been working 24 out of 28 and 1/2 hours prior to the\ncrash. Trooper Preston Langer responded to the scene of the crash and testified\nthat the further east he traveled, the conditions appeared to be deteriorating,\nwith snow beginning to accumulate on the roadway. The State presented dash\ncamera audio and video of a conversation that occurred between Trooper\nLanger and Landis, with Landis admitting that he could not see the center line\nand felt the truck drifting into the oncoming lane. Trooper Christa Kovarik\ntestified as an expert for purposes of crash reconstruction and gave her opinion\nthat the point of impact was delineated by gouge marks on the pavement\nlocated on the fog line of the eastbound lane. At the close of the State\u2019s case,\nLandis moved under Rule 29, N.D.R.Crim.P., for a judgment of acquittal. The\ndistrict court denied the motion.\n\n[\u00b63] On appeal, Landis argues the district court abused its discretion in\ndenying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. We conclude that the verdict is\nsupported by substantial evidence, and we summarily affirm under\nN.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(3).\n\n[\u00b64] Jon J. Jensen, C.J.\n     Gerald W. VandeWalle\n     Daniel J.
