PERRY II, CLERK\nvs) No. 12-1326 (Hampshire County 11-F-35)                                  SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS\n                                                                                OF WEST VIRGINIA\n\nBlane Wolford,\n\nDefendant Below, Petitioner\n\n\n                                 MEMORANDUM DECISION\n\n        Petitioner Blane Wolford, by counsel Eric Black, appeals the Circuit Court of Hampshire\nCounty\u2019s sentencing order entered on July 20, 2012. The State of West Virginia, by counsel\nScott Johnson, filed its response. On appeal, petitioner alleges that the circuit court erred in\ndenying his motion in limine and his motion for new trial, committed reversible error for failing\nto give the jury a copy of the jury instructions, and erred in permitting the jury to hear a 911 call\nmade by the victim\u2019s wife.\n\n       This Court has considered the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal. The facts and legal\narguments are adequately presented, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided\nby oral argument. Upon consideration of the standard of review, the briefs, and the record\npresented, the Court finds no substantial question of law and no prejudicial error. For these\nreasons, a memorandum decision is appropriate under Rule 21 of the Rules of Appellate\nProcedure.\n\n        In June of 2011, an arrest warrant was issued for petitioner charging him with one count\nof malicious assault after petitioner attacked the victim with a weed eater. A jury trial was held\non April 14, 2012. At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, petitioner moved for a judgment of\nacquittal, which the circuit court denied. Following the close of petitioner\u2019s case-in-chief,\npetitioner renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal, which the circuit court again denied.\nPetitioner was convicted of one count of unlawful assault. In May of 2012, petitioner filed a\nmotion for new trial alleging nineteen separate grounds for relief and a notice of intent to appeal\nalleging the same grounds for relief. Following a hearing on petitioner\u2019s motion for new trial, the\ncircuit court denied petitioner\u2019s motion. Petitioner was then sentenced to a term of incarceration\nof one to five years for unlawful assault.1\n\n         Petitioner raises four assignments of error. First, petitioner argues that the circuit court\nerred in granting the State\u2019s motion in limine to exclude prior acts of harassment perpetrated by\nthe victim against petitioner between 1995 and 2007, which petitioner contends support his claim\nof self-defense. This Court has stated that, \u201c[a] trial court's ruling on a motion in limine is\nreviewed on appeal for an abuse of discretion.\u201d Syl. Pt. 1, McKenzie v. Carroll Intern. Corp., 216\n       1\n           Petitioner was released on probation on October 23, 2012.\n\n\n\n                                                 1\n\n\fW.Va. 686, 610 S.E.2d 341 (2004). \u201cIn particular, under our traditional rule, a defendant in a\nhomicide, malicious wounding, or assault case who relies on self-defense or provocation may\nintroduce evidence concerning the violent or turbulent character of the victim, including prior\nthreats or attacks on the defendant.\u201d Syl. Pt. 2, State v. Woodson, 181 W.Va. 325, 382 S.E.2d 519\n(1989). Upon our review, the Court finds no abuse of discretion in the circuit court\u2019s decision to\ngrant the State\u2019s motion in limine to exclude prior acts of harassment between 1995 and 2007 as\ntoo remote and too prejudicial to show the victim\u2019s state of mind years ago. See State v.\nGangwer, 168 W.Va. 190, 198, 283 S.E.2d 839, 844 (1981) (excluding defendant\u2019s evidence\nbecause it was too remote.). Importantly, the circuit court allowed into evidence that, roughly\none month before the incident, the victim threatened to kill petitioner.\n\n        Second, petitioner argues that the circuit court erred in denying his motion for new trial\non the basis that the jury verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence presented at trial. In\nsupport of his argument, petitioner asserts that the circuit court was presented with substantial\nevidence to show that the victim was drinking on the night of the incident, voluntarily got off of\nhis utility vehicle to confront petitioner, and that he presented photographic evidence of his\ninjuries after he was attacked by the victim.\n\n       With respect to a trial court's denial of a motion for a new trial, this Court has explained:\n\n       \u201c\u2018[a]lthough the ruling of a trial court in granting or denying a motion for a new\n       trial is entitled to great respect and weight, the trial court's ruling will be reversed\n       on appeal when it is clear that the trial court has acted under some\n       misapprehension of the law or the evidence.\u2019 Syl. pt. 4, Sanders v. Georgia\u2013\n       Pacific Corp., 159 W.Va. 621, 225 S.E.2d 218 (1976).\u201d Syllabus point 1,\n       Andrews v. Reynolds Memorial Hospital, Inc., 201 W.Va. 624, 499 S.E.2d 846\n       (1997). Syl. pt. 1, Lively v. Rufus, 207 W.Va. 436, 533 S.E.2d 662 (2000).\n\nState v. White, 228 W.Va. 530, 536, 722 S.E.2d 566, 572 (2011). Moreover, in reviewing the\nsufficiency of the evidence of a criminal conviction on appeal, we have held as follows:\n\n       \u201c\u2018The function of an appellate court when reviewing the sufficiency of the\n       evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at\n       trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, is sufficient to convince a\n       reasonable person of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the\n       relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\n       to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\n       elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 Syl. Pt. 1, State v.\n       Guthrie, 194 W.Va. 657, 461 S.E.2d 163 (1995).\u201d Syl. Pt. 1, State v. Juntilla, 227\n       W.Va. 492, 711 S.E.2d 562 (2011).\n\nSyl. Pt. 8, State v. Stone, 229 W.Va. 271, 728 S.E.2d 155 (2012).\n\n       \u201c\u2018A criminal defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support a\n       conviction takes on a heavy burden. An appellate court must review all the\n       evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\n\f       prosecution and must credit all inferences and credibility assessments that the jury\n       might have drawn in favor of the prosecution. The evidence need not be\n       inconsistent with every conclusion save that of guilt so long as the jury can find\n       guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 Credibility determinations are for a jury and not\n       an appellate court. Finally, a jury verdict should be set aside only when the record\n       contains no evidence, regardless of how it is weighed, from which the jury could\n       find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 Syl. Pt. 3, in part, State v. Guthrie, 194\n       W.Va. 657, 461 S.E.2d 163 (1995).\u201d Syl. Pt. 2, State v. Juntilla, 227 W.Va. 492,\n       711 S.E.2d 562 (2011).\n\nSyl. Pt. 9, State v. Stone, 229 W.Va. 271, 728 S.E.2d 155 (2012). The evidence supports that the\nvictim was not intoxicated and that petitioner attacked the victim with a weed eater first on the\ndate of the incident. Therefore, this Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence to\nconvince a reasonable person of petitioner\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; thus, the circuit\ncourt correctly denied petitioner\u2019s motion for new trial.\n\n        Third, petitioner argues that the circuit court committed reversible error by failing to give\nthe jury a copy of the instructions. Petitioner argues that the circuit court promised to give the\njury a copy of the instructions and petitioner\u2019s counsel requested that they be provided a copy.\nThis Court notes the following:\n\n       \u201cAn appellant must carry the burden of showing error in the judgment of which he\n       complains. This Court will not reverse the judgment of a trial court unless error\n       affirmatively appears from the record. Error will not be presumed, all\n       presumptions being in favor of the correctness of the judgment.\u201d Syllabus point 5,\n       Morgan v. Price, 151 W.Va. 158, 150 S.E.2d 897 (1966).\n\nSyl. Pt. 2, Benson v. AJR, Inc., 226 W.Va. 165, 698 S.E.2d 638 (2010). Petitioner provides no\nsupport for his argument that the circuit court promised to give the jury a copy of the\ninstructions. In fact, after the circuit court instructed the jury, it stated that, \u201c[i]f you desire to\nreceive a copy of the Instructions given by the [c]ourt, you may ask the Bailiff or the [c]ourt to\nprovide those instructions to you in writing for your use during deliberations.\u201d Furthermore, the\ntranscript does not reflect that petitioner\u2019s counsel specifically requested that the jury be given a\ncopy of the instructions. For these reasons, the Court declines to find error in the circuit court\u2019s\nfailure to provide the jury with a copy of the instructions.\n\n        Finally, petitioner argues that the circuit court improperly allowed the State to play a tape\nof the 911 call made by the victim\u2019s wife. He argues that the tape offers no evidentiary value and\nits probative value is substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice. Further,\npetitioner argues that the circuit court failed to make a proper analysis pursuant to Rule 403 of\nthe West Virginia Rules of Evidence. While the circuit court ruled that it would allow the 911\ntape into evidence, the trial transcript is devoid of any indication that the State actually played\nthe 911 tape for the jury. Rule 10(c)(7) of the West Virginia Rules of Appellate Procedure\nrequires that arguments \u201ccontain appropriate and specific citations to the record on appeal,\nincluding citations that pinpoint when and how the issues in the assignments of error were\npresented to the lower tribunal. The Court may disregard errors that are not adequately supported\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\n\fby specific references to the record on appeal.\u201d Moreover, it is a petitioner\u2019s burden to show the\nerror in judgment of which he complains. See Syl. Pt. 2, WV Dept. of Health & Human\nResources Employees Federal Credit Union v. Tennant, 215 W.Va. 387, 599 S.E.2d 810 (2004).\nPetitioner\u2019s argument is without support from the record below and, therefore, we find no merit.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                                                                       Affirmed.\n\nISSUED: September 3, 2013\n\n\nCONCURRED IN BY:\n\nChief Justice Brent D.
