Gray also saw [Ellison],\n            [Appellant], and Brooker the next day and heard\n            them laughing about shooting Jacob[s]. Another\n\n            saw someone standing over Jacobs and shoot him in\n            the head.

Whether the evidence was so contradictory and\n                       unreliable that the verdicts must be set aside\n                       because they are based on surmise or\n                       conjecture?\n\n             II.       Whether a conviction based on unreliable,\n                       unsworn statements not given in open court\n                       violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the\n                       Constitution of the United States?\n\n             III.      Whether the [trial court] erred when it\n                       admitted evidence that Appellant was found in\n                       possession of a 9 mm. handgun when expert\n                       testimony conclusively established based on\n                       analysis of the cartridge casings that the\n                       murder weapon was a .380 caliber pistol, and\n                       definitely not a 9 mm. pistol?\n\n             IV.       Whether the [trial] court erred when it failed to\n                       grant   a    mistrial     arising  from       the\n\n                       without factual support that Appellant was a\n                       drug dealer?\n\n             V.        Whether the jury instructions on first[-]degree\n                       murder     which    blur   the   elements    of\n                       premeditation and deliberation relieved the\n                       [Commonwealth] of the burden of proving\n                       each element of the crime beyond a reasonable\n                       doubt in violation of the Due Process Clause of\n                       the Fourteenth Amendment?\n\n             VI.       Whether the [trial court] erred and denied due\n                       process when it sent prior unsworn ambiguous\n                       statements back with the jury leading the jury\n\n                       _______________________\n(Footnote Continued)\n\n2013 after successfully seeking an extension. The trial court did not file a\nRule 1925(a) opinion, as the trial judge who presided over the trial retired\nfrom the bench in the interim.\n\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fJ-A20019-14\n\n\n                    to infer that the statements were accurate and\n                    had heightened importance?\n\n             VII.   Whether the fifty[-]year sentence imposed on\n                    a juvenile was imposed without consideration\n                    of age[-]related factors including prospects for\n                    rehabilitation and without a record suitable for\n                    appellate review?\n\n                       -4.\n\n      In his first issue, Appellant argues the Commonwealth failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for first-degree murder.\n\nSpecifically, Appellant avers the Commonwealth did not provide sufficient\n\n\n\nconjecture because the evidence was in hopeless conflict, and some of the\n\ninformation in the prior statements was ambiguous\n\nId. at 17.\n\n      Our standard of review regarding challenges to the sufficiency of the\n\n                                            In reviewing the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, we consider whether the evidence presented at trial, and all\n\nreasonable inferences drawn therefrom, viewed in a light most favorable to\n\n\n\n                         Commonwealth v.

See\n\nits plain text, Rule 1925(b)                            identify each ruling or\n\nerror that the appellant intends to challenge with sufficient detail to identify\n\n\n\n\ninclude every subsidiary issue contained therein which was raised in the trial\n\n          Id. at 1925(b)(4)(v). Finally, any issues not raised in accordance\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fJ-A20019-14\n\n\nwith Rule 1925(b)(4) will be deemed waived. Id. at 1925(b)(4)(vii). Our\n\nSupreme Court has held that Rule 1925(b) is a bright-line rule.\n\n           Our jurisprudence is clear and well-settled, and\n           firmly establishes that: Rule 1925(b) sets out a\n           simple bright-line rule, which obligates an appellant\n           to file and serve a Rule 1925(b) statement, when so\n           ordered; any issues not raised in a Rule 1925(b)\n           statement will be deemed waived; the courts lack\n           the authority to countenance deviations from the\n\n           ad hoc exceptions or selective enforcement;\n           appellants and their counsel are responsible for\n                                                       le 1925\n           violations may be raised by the appellate court sua\n           sponte, and the Rule applies notwithstanding an\n\n           1925 is not clear as to what is required of an\n           appellant, on-the-record actions taken by the\n           appellant aimed at compliance may satisfy the Rule.\n           We yet again repeat the principle first stated in\n           [Commonwealth v.] Lord, [719 A.2d 306 (Pa.\n           1998)]\n           preserve    their claims   for  appellate   review,\n           [a]ppellants must comply whenever the trial court\n           orders them to file a Statement of Matters\n           Complained of on Appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925.\n           Any issues not raised in a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)\n                                              Id.] at 309.\n\nCommonwealth v. Hill, 16 A.3d 484, 494 (Pa. 2011) (footnote omitted).\n\n\n\n\nbrief, Appellant argues that nevertheless, his sufficiency argument should\n\n\n\nthat such a claim must be considered by the Superior Court whether it is\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fJ-A20019-14\n\n\nAppellant also claims that since the trial judge has retired and did not file an\n\n                                                                             Id.\n\nFinally, Appellant avers that the sufficiency arguments are embedded in\n\n                                                                       Id.\n\n       As noted above, our Supreme Court has held Rule 1925(b) is a bright-\n\n\n\nstatement are waived for the purposes of appeal.             See Hill, supra;\n\nPa.R.A.P. 1925(b)(4)(\n\n                       Commonwealth v. Laboy, 936 A.2d 1058 (Pa. 2007),\n\ndoes not mandate that this Court review all sufficiency claims, even when\n\nnot raised in the Rule 1925(b) statement.         In Laboy, our Supreme Court\n\nconsidered whether this Court correctly determined that the defendant, who\n\n                                   adequately develop his claim of insufficient\n\n\n\nId. at 1058. Laboy held that this Court should have reviewed the merits of\n\n\n\n           Id. at 1060. The instant matter is distinguishable from Laboy as\n\nAppellant did not include his sufficiency issue at all in his Rule 1925(b)\n\nstatement.7\n\n                                ad hoc\n____________________________________________\n7\n    Moreover, Laboy predates Hill by approximately four years, before our\n                                                          -line rule.\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fJ-A20019-14\n\n\nwe are powerless to grant. Hill, supra. Therefore, for all of these reasons,\n\n                                                 Hill\n\nissue on appeal waived for failure to list it in his Rule 1925(b) statement.\n\n      In his second issue, Appellant argues that his due process rights were\n\n\n\n\nerroneously admitted the prior statements of Gray, Gould, and Sampson.\n\nId. at 20-21.\n\n      At its core, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nentitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial.   United States v. Gonzalez-\n\nLopez, 548 U.S. 140, 146 (2006) (citations omitted). Our Supreme Court\n\nhas held that convictions based on prior inconsistent statements can amount\n\nto a due process violation, but only in extremely rare circumstances.          See\n\ngenerally Commonwealth v. Brown, 52 A.3d 1139, 1170-1171 (Pa.\n\n2012).    Prior inconsistent statements are admissible as substantive\n\nevidence, if any of the following apply.\n\n                  [O]nly   those   prior   inconsistent   statements\n\n\n                  evidence.

To this end, the\n                  Lively Court required as a requisite to\n                  admissibility, that the prior statement be:\n\n                        (1) given under oath at a formal legal\n                        hearing;\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fJ-A20019-14\n\n\n                        (2) reduced to a writing which was\n                        signed or adopted by the witness; or\n\n                        (3)      a   contemporaneous      verbatim\n\n\n                  Id.; see also Commonwealth v.

Prior inconsistent statements, which\n           meet the requirements for admissibility under\n           Pennsylvania law, must, therefore, be considered by\n           a reviewing court in the same manner as any other\n           type of validly admitted evidence when determining\n           if sufficient evidence exists to sustain a criminal\n           conviction.\n\nBrown, supra (footnote omitted).\n\n     Appellant does not identify or explain how any of the prior statements\n\nfails to meet Brown                  establish every element of the offense\n\n                                            See id.

See Brown, supra; Bibbs, supra.\n\n     In his third issue, Appellant avers that the trial court erred when it\n\n\n\n\ntestimony should have been inadmissible. Id. We begin by noting our well-\n\nsettled standard of review regarding evidentiary matters.\n\n            The admissibility of evidence is at the discretion of\n            the trial court and only a showing of an abuse of that\n            discretion, and resulting prejudice, constitutes\n            reversible error. An abuse of discretion is not merely\n            an error of judgment, but is rather the overriding or\n            misapplication of the law, or the exercise of\n            judgment that is manifestly unreasonable, or the\n            result of bias, prejudice, ill-will or partiality, as\n            shown by the evidence of record. Furthermore, if in\n            reaching a conclusion the trial court over-rides or\n            misapplies the law, discretion is then abused and it is\n            the duty of the appellate court to correct the error.\n\nCommonwealth v.

Therefore, Appellant has waived any argument as to a\n\n\n                                      - 15 -\n\fJ-A20019-14\n\n\nmistrial regarding those incidents.9           See Sandusky, supra.   However, as\n\n\n\nsummation, he was not required to request a mistrial to preserve the issue\n\nfor our review.      See Hogentogler, supra.           Accordingly, we confine our\n\ndiscussion to that occurrence.\n\n       We begin by stating our standard of review.\n\n              It is well-\n              denial of a motion for a mistrial is limited to\n              determining whether the trial court abused its\n              discretion. An abuse of discretion is not merely an\n              error of judgment, but if in reaching a conclusion the\n              law is overridden or misapplied, or the judgment\n              exercised is manifestly unreasonable, or the result of\n              partiality, prejudice, bias or ill-\n              abused. A trial court may grant a mistrial only\n              where the incident upon which the motion is based is\n              of such a nature that its unavoidable effect is to\n              deprive the defendant of a fair trial by preventing the\n              jury from weighing and rendering a true verdict. A\n              mistrial is not       necessary     where    cautionary\n              instructions are adequate to overcome prejudice.\n\nCommonwealth v.

Our\n           review of prosecutorial remarks and an allegation of\n           prosecutorial misconduct requires us to evaluate\n           whether a defendant received a fair trial, not a\n           perfect trial.\n\nCommonwealth v. Judy, 978 A.2d 1015, 1019 (Pa. Super. 2009).\n\n      During its closing argument, the Commonwealth made the following\n\nreference to the defendants and Sampson.\n\n           [Commonwealth]:        Why would [Sampson] point\n\n           you exactly what she saw and what she heard? Why\n           would she try and ruin any relationship with these\n           three individuals, her free drugs, by providing a\n           statement to Homicide that assists them in trying to\n           figure out who killed [the victim], by specifically\n           saying Worm told me and made a comment that he\n           shot [the victim]?\n\n                            sel]: Objection.\n\n           [Trial Court]:   Overruled.\n\nN.T., 7/13/12, at 98 (emphasis added).

This burden is\n           satisfied when the Commonwealth is able to show\n           that: (1) the error did not prejudice the defendant or\n           the prejudice was de minimis; or (2) the erroneously\n           admitted evidence was merely cumulative of other\n           untainted evidence which was substantially similar to\n           the erroneously admitted evidence; or (3) the\n           properly admitted and uncontradicted evidence of\n           guilt was so overwhelming and the prejudicial\n           [e]ffect of the error so insignificant by comparison\n           that the error could not have contributed to the\n           verdict.\n\nCommonwealth v.

Cf. Commonwealth v.

Pennsylvania, 131 S. Ct. 250 (2010). However, we do agree\nwith the Commonwealth that to the extent Appellant argues Sam\nstatement should have been redacted further, this argument is waived as\nAppellant only objected at trial on the grounds of its alleged heightened\nimportance.

Material Permitted in Possession of\n            the Jury\n\n            (A) Upon retiring, the jury may take with it such\n            exhibits as the trial judge deems proper, except as\n            provided in paragraph (C).\n\n\n\n            (C) During deliberations, the jury shall not be\n            permitted to have:\n\n                    (1) a transcript of any trial testimony;\n\n                    (2) a copy of any written or otherwise recorded\n                    confession by the defendant;\n\n                    (3) a copy of the information or indictment;\n                    and\n\n                    (4) except as provided in paragraph (B),\n                    written jury instructions.\n\n            (D) The jurors shall be permitted to have their notes\n            for use during deliberations.\n\nPa.R.Crim.P. 646.\n\n      After careful review, we conclude Appellant is not entitled to relief on\n\nthis issue. Under Pennsylvania law, the jury is generally permitted to have\n\nwitness statements with it during deliberations.       See Commonwealth v.\n\nHall, 565 A.2d 144, 148 (Pa. 1989) (concluding that the trial court did not\n\n                                      - 25 -\n\fJ-A20019-14\n\n\nabuse its discretion in permitting the jury to have previously written and\n\nrecorded witness statements with it during deliberations).          Furthermore,\n\nRule 646 does exclude the trial transcrip\n\nprior witness statements entered into evidence as exhibits.             See, e.g.,\n\nPa.R.Crim.P.   646(A);   646(C)(1).       Additionally,    we   agree    with   the\n\n\n\nheightened importance to certain statements by having them in the jury\n\nroom. See                                   -27. Rather, the record shows here\n\n\n\n                                               This Court has previously held that\n\nthis is the policy reason behind allowing the jurors to use such exhibits. See\n\nCommonwealth v. Bango, 685 A.2d 564, 566 (Pa. Super. 1996) (stating,\n\nwhere materials inform a jury and aid it in the difficult task of determining\n\nfacts, the jury should be permitted to study those materials during its\n\n                   affirmed, 742 A.2d 1070 (Pa. 1999).           Based on these\n\nconsiderations, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\npermitting the jury to have the witness statements during deliberations.\n\nSee Barnett, supra.\n\n      In his seventh issue, Appellant avers that the trial court erred in\n\nimposing an aggregate sentence of 50 years to life imprisonment.\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 26 -\n\fJ-A20019-14\n\n\nfurther avers that the trial court imposed such a sentence without\n\nconsidering any of the age related factors listed in 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1102.1(d).\n\nId. at 35-\n\nyears to life imprisonment is the equivalent of a life sentence.

Tobin, 89 A.3d 663, 666 (Pa. Super. 2014) (citation omitted). When an\n\nappellant forwards an argument pertaining to the discretionary aspects of\n\nthe sentence, this Court considers such an argument to be a petition for\n\npermission to appeal.
