WR-72,845-01\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEX PARTE JOSE ANGEL RIVERA, Applicant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE NO. 01-CR-77 IN THE 381ST DISTRICT COURT\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM STARR COUNTY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPer curiam.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\nO R D E R\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPursuant to the provisions of Article 11.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the\r\nclerk of the trial court transmitted to this Court this application for writ of habeas corpus.  Ex parte\r\nYoung, 418 S.W.2d 824, 826 (Tex. Crim. App. 1967).  Applicant was convicted of murder  and\r\nsentenced to 65  years' imprisonment.  The Fourth Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction.  Rivera\r\nv. State, No. 04-02-00576-CR, (Tex. App.- San Antonio, 2005, no pet.) (not designated for\r\npublication). \r\n\r\n\tApplicant alleges inter alia that the State coerced him into pleading guilty by threatening him\r\nthat he would be sentenced to death unless he entered a guilty plea.  Applicant alleges that he was\r\nconfused when he entered his plea and could not understand the trial judge's admonishments.\r\nApplicant alleges that counsel solely advised him to plead guilty and failed to advise him as to his\r\nother options including his right to go to trial.  Finally, Applicant alleges that counsel's pre-trial\r\ninvestigation was deficient as counsel failed to discover that Applicant was initially charged with\r\ntampering with evidence and that the evidence did not support the State's re-indictment for murder. \r\nApplicant has alleged facts that, if true, might entitle him to relief.  Strickland v. Washington, 466\r\nU.S. 608 (1984); Ex parte Lemke, 13 S.W.3d 791,795-96 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).  In these\r\ncircumstances, additional facts are needed.  \r\n\r\n\tAs we held in Ex parte Rodriguez, 334 S.W.2d 294, 294 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997), the trial\r\ncourt is the appropriate forum for findings of fact.  The trial court may use any means set out in Tex.\r\nCode Crim. Proc. art. 11.07, \u00a7 3(d) to resolve the fact issues.  In the appropriate case, the trial court\r\nmay rely on its personal recollection.  Id.  The trial court shall order trial counsel to file an affidavit\r\naddressing the following:  (1) whether the facts in the case supported a capital murder charge; (2)\r\nwhether Applicant understood the trial judge's admonishment and the consequences of his plea; (3) \r\nwhether counsel advised Applicant to plead guilty, and if so, why; and, (4) whether counsel's pre-trial investigation indicated that Applicant was initially charged with tampering with evidence and,\r\nif so, whether the evidence supported the State's re-indictment for murder.  The trial court shall also\r\ninstruct the clerk to supplement the record with a copy of the transcription of the court reporter's\r\nnotes from the plea hearing.  \r\n\r\n\tIf the trial court elects to hold a hearing, it shall determine whether Applicant is indigent. If\r\nApplicant is indigent and wishes to be represented by counsel, the trial court shall appoint an\r\nattorney to represent Applicant at the hearing.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 26.04. \r\n\r\n\t  The trial court shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law in regard to Applicant's\r\nclaim that his plea was involuntary.  Specifically, the trial court shall make findings of fact as to\r\nwhether the facts in the case supported a capital murder charge.  The trial court shall also make\r\nfindings of fact as to whether Applicant understood the trial judge's admonishment and the\r\nconsequences of his plea.  The trial court shall also make findings of fact as to whether counsel\r\nadvised Applicant to plead guilty.  The trial court shall also make findings of fact as to whether\r\ncounsel's pre-trial investigation indicated that Applicant was initially charged with tampering with\r\nevidence and, if so, whether the evidence supported the State's re-indictment for murder.  The trial\r\ncourt shall also make any other findings of fact and conclusions of law that it deems relevant and\r\nappropriate to the disposition of Applicant's claims for habeas corpus relief.\r\n\r\n\tThis application will be held in abeyance until the trial court has resolved the fact issues.  The\r\nissues shall be resolved within 90 days of this order.  If any continuances are granted, a copy of the\r\norder granting the continuance shall be sent to this Court. A supplemental transcript containing all\r\naffidavits and interrogatories or the transcription of the court reporter's notes from any hearing or\r\ndeposition, along with the trial court's supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law, shall\r\nbe returned to this Court within 120 days of the date of this order.  Any extensions of time shall be\r\nobtained from this Court. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFiled: November 18, 2009\r\n\r\nDo not publish\r\n\r\n\r\n",
