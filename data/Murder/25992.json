Vaudt,\n\nJudge.\n\n\n\n      Richard Gene Shawhan appeals from his conviction for second-degree\n\nmurder. AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n      Mark C. Smith, State Appellate Defender, and Theresa R. Wilson,\n\nAssistant Appellate Defender, for appellant.\n\n      Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, and Louis S. Sloven, Assistant\n\nAttorney General, for appellee.\n\n\n\n      Considered by Danilson, C.J., and Tabor and McDonald, JJ.\n\f                                          2\n\n\nDANILSON, Chief Judge.\n\n       Following a jury trial, Richard Gene Shawhan was convicted of second-\n\ndegree murder for the death of Jeffrey Butts, who suffered brain trauma and\n\neventual death after being hit three times in the head with a blunt instrument. On\n\nappeal, Shawhan contends the trial court abused its discretion in not allowing\n\nhim to impeach a witness with a prior incident of untruthfulness, erred in\n\ninstructing the jury, and did not apply the correct standard in ruling on his motion\n\nfor new trial. In a supplemental pro se brief, Shawhan asserts counsel was\n\nineffective in failing to object to additional instructional errors. Finding no reason\n\nto overturn the conviction, we affirm.\n\nI. Background Facts.\n\n       On December 21, 2014, Shawhan did not return to the Fort Des Moines\n\nresidential correctional facility. At that time, Butts and Kimberly Goemaat-Clark\n\n(Clark) were living together in an apartment and were allowing Brian Mabrier and\n\nNicole Martin to stay with them. While on escape status, Shawhan occasionally\n\nstayed with Butts and Clark.\n\n       On December 26, Butts, Clark, Mabrier, and Martin returned to the\n\napartment after having all been at \u201cJunebug\u2019s\u201d (the nickname of an acquaintance\n\nwho was a mechanic). Mabrier and Martin were in one vehicle. Butts and Clark\n\nwere in another, and they had picked up Shawhan, who called and asked for a\n\nride. Shawhan showered at the Butts/Clark apartment and was given clothes to\n\nwear belonging to Butts. The five ate dinner together and spent the rest of the\n\nevening \u201changing out,\u201d playing darts, and using methamphetamine. At some\n\npoint, Thomas Beall was also present but left. Butts and Clark left for a time.\n\f                                         3\n\n\nShawhan became increasingly paranoid as time passed. He took Mabrier\u2019s dog\n\noutside. He reported to Mabrier he was seeing police officers and dogs in the\n\ntrees. Shawhan saw a baseball bat in Martin\u2019s vehicle and asked Mabrier if he\n\ncould have it for protection. Mabrier gave Shawhan the bat.\n\n       At about 5:30 a.m. on December 27, Butts and Clark returned to the\n\napartment. They were on the bed, which was located in the main room of the\n\napartment.   Mabrier and Martin were in the spare room, and Shawhan was\n\npacing between the two rooms \u201cback and forth throughout the night,\u201d still carrying\n\nthe baseball bat. Clark dozed off. She was awakened by a loud noise (a \u201cping\u201d\n\nshe recognized as the sound of an aluminum bat) and saw Shawhan holding a\n\nbat aloft and standing over her and Butts. Martin heard Clark screaming, \u201cDon\u2019t\n\ndo that. Why did you do that?\u201d Shawhan yelled, \u201cYou should have killed me\n\nwhen you had the chance, motherfucker.\u201d Mabrier saw Shawhan come into the\n\nspare room holding the bat and having a \u201ccrazy look on his face.\u201d           Mabrier\n\njumped out the second-story window.\n\n       Shawhan demanded that Martin give him a ride. When Martin came out of\n\nthe spare room, she saw Butts on the bed, \u201claying there with his hands wrapped\n\nup over his face and rocking back and forth . . . . gurgling.\u201d She and Shawhan\n\nencountered Mabrier outside on the stairs to the apartment building. Mabrier\n\ntried to convince Martin not to go with Shawhan; Martin said, \u201cI\u2019m just going to\n\nget him out of here so he don\u2019t hurt nobody else.\u201d Shawhan said to Mabrier, \u201cI\n\nwasn\u2019t even going to hurt you.\u201d Clark then came out onto the balcony of the\n\napartment and yelled to Mabrier, \u201cHelp me, help me. He hit him in the head with\n\na ball bat. He hit him in the head with the ball bat.\u201d The front security door to the\n\f                                        4\n\n\nbuilding was locked, so Mabrier climbed onto the deck and returned to the\n\napartment as Martin and Shawhan drove away.\n\n      Mabrier and Clark tried to carry Butts out of the apartment to take him to\n\nthe hospital. Butts (who was much larger than Mabrier) was struggling and was\n\non the ground near the bottom of the steps when an ambulance arrived, having\n\nbeen summoned by neighbors\u2019 calls to 911.\n\n      Officer Patrick Hickey was one of the first to respond to the 911 call to the\n\nButts/Clark apartment. Clark told Officer Hickey she was sitting on the bed and\n\nButts was there on the bed with her. She stated \u201cRicky\u201d\u2014she did not know him\n\nby Shawhan\u2014was sitting at the end of the bed in a red chair. She was not\n\npaying attention to either of them when she heard what she said sounded like\n\ntwo or three pings like somebody getting hit on the head with a baseball bat.\n\nWhen she turned around, she saw Butts was bleeding a lot.\n\n      Marbier told Officer Hickey he was not in the apartment at the time of the\n\nassault. \u201cHe said that he had left prior to the assault with their dog and walked\n\nthrough the living room, which is [also] a bedroom where he saw both Clark [and]\n\nButts on the bed and Shawhan sitting in the chair.\u201d\n\n      In the meantime, Shawhan was directing Martin to drive to the apartment\n\nof a friend but he could not remember the unit, then to his sister\u2019s house but she\n\nwas not home, and then to his girlfriend\u2019s house. There, Shawhan\u2019s girlfriend got\n\nin the vehicle with Martin and Shawhan, who was lying on the floor in the back\n\nseat of the van. They went to the gas station because the van was running out of\n\ngas. Martin took money inside to pay for gas, told an attendant she was being\n\nheld against her will, and then locked herself in the bathroom and called 911.\n\f                                           5\n\n\nWhen officers arrived at the gas station and surrounded the van, Shawhan was\n\nlying on the floor and had a baseball bat next to his left hand. He surrendered\n\nwithout incident.\n\n       Butts\u2019s speech was not coherent when he arrived at the hospital.\n\nBecause of the seriousness of his injuries, he was taken to University of Iowa\n\nHospitals. He sustained a skull fracture, intracranial bleeding, and facial bone\n\nfractures.\n\n       Both Clark and Mabrier gave additional statements to police. While in the\n\ninterview room at the police station, Mabrier ripped off his shirt, which was\n\ncovered in Butts\u2019s blood, and attempted to hide it in the ceiling. Detective Danny\n\nWhite confronted Mabrier about his attempt to hide his clothes. Mabrier stated\n\nhe did not want to be a \u201csnitch.\u201d During the interview, Mabrier was \u201csobbing and\n\nyou could tell that he was highly upset about what had occurred.\u201d\n\n       Butts was taken off of life support and died on January 4, 2015. Shawhan\n\nwas charged with first-degree murder.\n\n       The State filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude any reference to an\n\nincident when Officer Hickey had not been truthful during an internal affairs\n\ninvestigation. After a hearing, the district court ruled:\n\n       [I]t\u2019s legitimate for [the defense] to ask if he has ever had any\n       issues regarding his propensity for truthfulness or however they\n       want to cast that, you know what the rule says in terms of what the\n       buzz words are, regarding the assignment of his job duties.\n                And by that I mean [the prosecutor] has indicated he\u2019s been\n       a professional in law enforcement for a lot of years. If he has\n       something in his background related to the assignment of whatever\n       he was tasked to do as an officer of some kind for Des Moines PD,\n       I think that\u2019s fair game. I do not think the internal affairs\n       investigation is fair game because in the Court\u2019s view\u2014and I\n       understand why the defense wants to get at this because, in fact, if\n\f                                          6\n\n\n       there is something related to what he was assigned to do, he was\n       assigned to do something here. So for me that\u2019s the link between\n       the two.\n\n       In a subsequent offer of proof, Officer Hickey testified that about four\n\nyears prior, a fellow officer had discharged his firearm inside a building belonging\n\nto the police department.     During the resulting internal affairs investigation,\n\nOfficer Hickey corroborated the fellow officer\u2019s statement that the other officer\n\nhad not been responsible for the firearm discharge. However, after the fellow\n\nofficer admitted he had accidentally discharged the weapon, Officer Hickey\n\nchanged his own statement. As a consequence of the rule violation, Officer\n\nHickey was suspended for seventeen days, removed from the Metro SWAT team\n\nand as the team leader of another team, and \u201csent back to day patrol.\u201d\n\n       The court made a further ruling:\n\n               I think that Officer Hickey can be asked if he ever had any\n       issues with truthfulness regarding the work that he was assigned to\n       do in however many positions he\u2019s held with the Des Moines Police\n       Department.\n               That does not include this internal investigation or delving\n       into this internal investigation that was at least three or four years\n       ago for the following reason: His ability to be truthful or not, if it\n       related to something arising from an investigation or if it arose from\n       him completing a report when he was out on the beat and was\n       dispatched somewhere and he had to take information similar to\n       what his role was here, if that was the situation, I would agree that\n       that would be fair game.\n               It may\u2014and so now let\u2019s step back for a second and talk\n       about the internal investigation. On some level it may have some\n       minimal relevance, but the court doesn\u2019t think that whatever\n       relevance it could have, however tangential that might be, I don\u2019t\n       think it\u2014it\u2019s relevant enough that it qualifies to be delved into here.\n       And I think as well that offering that information could potentially be\n       unfairly prejudicial.\n               So on that basis, I want to make sure the parties both\n       understand. And if you don\u2019t, now\u2019s the time to say so. You can\n       chat with Officer Hickey. You heard what he would be prepared to\n       say. You can ask him if he ever had any issues regarding his\n\f                                        7\n\n\n      assigned duties; in other words, when he was out there performing\n      whatever task he was assigned to perform as a cop in whatever\n      capacity he was performing that in, because my understanding is\n      that he has been an employee of the Des Moines Police\n      Department for a number of years. So you\u2019re free to ask him, and\n      whatever he says is what he says.\n\n      Clark, Mabrier, and Martin were among the witnesses who testified at trial.\n\nAnother of the witnesses, Frank Nucaro, acknowledged that he had known\n\nShawhan as a kid growing up and that they both ended up in the Polk County Jail\n\nin late December 2014. Nucaro stated Shawhan told him Shawhan had gotten\n\ninto a verbal altercation with Butts and that he showed Butts that he \u201cwasn\u2019t a\n\ntough guy\u201d by hitting Butts with a baseball bat. Nucaro also stated Shawhan\n\nasked him to make sure the witnesses \u201cdidn\u2019t make it\u201d and were \u201ctaken care of\u201d if\n\nNucaro was successful in bonding out. Nucaro was eventually transferred to the\n\nstate prison at Oakdale and contacted authorities with the information Shawhan\n\nhad shared with him. Nucaro stated he did so because he was concerned for the\n\nwelfare of Martin, who he knew was pregnant.\n\n      The State played a number of recorded phone conversations Shawhan\n\nhad while at the Polk County Jail.    In some of the calls, Shawhan refers to\n\nwanting \u201cMike J.\u201d to talk to people who had been in the apartment.\n\n      Shawhan testified that in the early morning hours of December 27, he was\n\noutside walking the dog due to his paranoia. Shawhan stated he came through\n\nthe front door of the building and had just entered the Butts/Clark apartment\n\nwhen he heard Clark screaming and saw a person go into the spare room.\n\nShawhan stated he did not see who hit Butts or what he was hit with.\n\f                                         8\n\n\n       The jury found Shawhan guilty of second-degree murder.              He now\n\nappeals.\n\nII. Scope and Standards of Review.\n\n       We generally review the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. State v. Tipton, 897 N.W.2d 653, 690 (Iowa 2017). Even if the trial\n\ncourt has abused its discretion in excluding evidence, we do not reverse for a\n\nnew trial unless the exclusion was prejudicial. State v. Greene, 592 N.W.2d 24,\n\n27 (Iowa 1999).\n\n       \u201cAlleged errors in the submission or refusal to submit jury instructions are\n\nreviewed for correction of errors at law.\u201d Tipton, 897 N.W.2d at 694. \u201c[H]owever,\n\nif the jury instruction is not required but discretionary, we review for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\u201d State v. Plain, 898 N.W.2d 801, 811 (Iowa 2017). \u201cWe review jury\n\ninstructions as a whole to determine whether the jury instructions correctly state\n\nthe law.\u201d Tipton, 897 N.W.2d at 694.\n\n       We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel de novo because\n\nsuch claims raise constitutional issues. Ledezma v. State, 626 N.W.2d 134, 141\n\n(Iowa 2001).\n\nIII. Discussion.\n\n       A. Limitations on impeachment of Officer Hickey. Shawhan notes Officer\n\nHickey was one of two responding officers in the case. Officer Hickey took the\n\ninitial statements from Clark and Mabrier, who later gave different statements at\n\ntrial. Officer Hickey acknowledged not securing the scene initially, which resulted\n\f                                            9\n\n\nin maintenance workers for the complex having started to clean blood from the\n\ncommon areas of the building before police returned to secure the area.1\n\n       Shawhan asserts the trial court abused its discretion in prohibiting\n\nShawhan from impeaching Officer Hickey with evidence regarding his prior\n\ndiscipline for untruthfulness, contending the evidence was relevant to Officer\n\nHickey\u2019s general credibility.      He argues the failure to permit impeachment\n\nharmed Shawhan\u2019s case:\n\n       [T]he court\u2019s refusal to permit the general impeachment of Hickey\n       left a false impression for the jury. At the beginning of his\n       testimony, Hickey informed the jury that he was a patrol officer who\n       had also been on the vice and narcotics and SWAT teams. He said\n       he had been the leader of the Weapons of Mass Destruction team,\n       the dive master of the dive team, and an assistant leader for the\n       entry team. This experience probably sounds fairly impressive to\n       the average juror, who might then credit Hickey with a certain\n       degree of respect and credibility. Had jurors heard that Hickey was\n       removed from those special teams based on being disciplined for\n       untruthfulness in an internal affairs investigation, they might have\n       viewed his credibility much differently.\n\n       Under Iowa Rule of Evidence 5.608(b), in its discretion, the court may\n\npermit inquiry into specific instances of conduct on cross-examination if the\n\nevidence is probative of a witness\u2019s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.\n\nState v. Knox, 536 N.W.2d 735, 740 (Iowa 1995). The trial court considers the\n\nprobative value of the evidence, State v. Smith, 522 N.W.2d 591, 593 (Iowa\n\n1994), and whether the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair\n\nprejudice, Knox, 536 N.W.2d at 740. We will disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling \u201conly\n\n\n\n1\n  Officer Hickey testified that the initial call was for an assault and \u201cwe didn\u2019t have a\nvictim because he didn\u2019t want to file a report.\u201d When the prosecutor noted that Officer\nHickey had testified Butts could not talk, the officer testified: \u201cThat is correct. When I\nasked, he didn\u2019t answer, so I can\u2019t assume that he wanted one. So I just went ahead\nand made the injured person\u2019s report.\u201d\n\f                                          10\n\nwhen its discretion has been obviously abused.\u201d State v. Frazier, 559 N.W.2d\n\n34, 38 (Iowa Ct. App. 1996). \u201cAn abuse of discretion will be found when the court\n\nexercises its discretion on grounds clearly untenable or to an extent clearly\n\nunreasonable.\u201d Id.\n\n          Here, the trial court weighed the probative value (\u201cminimal relevance\u201d) of\n\nthe evidence and concluded it was \u201cunfairly prejudicial.\u201d While another court\n\nmight come to different result, these grounds are not clearly untenable or clearly\n\nunreasonable. We thus conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n\n          Even if we would determine the trial court abused its discretion, we could\n\nnot conclude the exclusion of the evidence was prejudicial affording Shawhan a\n\nnew trial. Officer Hickey was one of several investigating officers that testified\n\nand was not an eyewitness to the crime. His testimony was not indispensable to\n\nthe State\u2019s case as other officers testified to some of the same facts. Photo\n\nevidence was also admitted relative to some of Officer Hickey\u2019s testimony. There\n\nwas no prejudice to Shawhan by the exclusion of the evidence.\n\n          B. The bad-acts jury instruction. The trial court provided the following\n\nproposed jury instruction:2\n\n                  You have received evidence and heard testimony that the\n          defendant may have committed certain illegal acts which are not\n          charged in the trial information in this case. The defendant is not\n          on trial for those acts.\n                  Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may not be used\n          by you to prove the character of a person in order to show that the\n          person acted in conformity therewith.         It may, however, be\n          admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, intent,\n          common sense, opportunity, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity\n          of person charged, or absence of mistake or accident.\n\n\n2\n    Instruction No. 18.\n\f                                              11\n\n\n          Shawhan, however, requested the model instruction for other-bad-acts\n\nevidence found in Iowa Criminal Jury Instruction 200.34:\n\n                  Evidence has been received concerning other wrongful acts\n          alleged to have been committed by the defendant. The defendant\n          is not on trial for those acts. This evidence must be shown by clear\n          proof to show [motive] [intent] [absence of mistake or accident]\n          [common scheme] [identity of person charged] and for no other\n          purpose. If you find other wrongful acts occurred then and only\n          then may such other wrongful acts be considered for the purpose of\n          establishing [motive] [intent] [absence of mistake or accident]\n          [common scheme] [identity of person charged].\n                  You may consider whether the acts were recent or remote\n          and whether the acts were similar or dissimilar to the crimes\n          charged in this case and all other relevant factors in deciding how\n          much weight and effect to give them.\n\n          Shawhan asserts the court\u2019s instruction \u201comitted any reference to the\n\nState\u2019s burden to provide clear proof of the other bad acts\u201d; \u201comitted the direction\n\nthat the jury could use the evidence of other bad acts for specific purposes only if\n\nthe jury found the other acts occurred\u201d; referred to \u201cillegal acts\u201d as opposed to\n\n\u201cwrongful acts\u201d; \u201cessentially convey[ed] to the jury that Shawhan had, in fact,\n\ncommitted other illegal acts\u201d; and that the given instruction would have confused\n\nthe jury because it improperly allowed the jury to use the evidence as substantive\n\nevidence of motive, intent, and identity.\n\n          The instruction requested by Shawhan and his claims of error are\n\npremised upon Iowa Rule of Evidence 5.404(b)3 and case law concerning the\n\n\n\n3\n    Rule 5.404(b) provides:\n          Crimes, wrongs, or other acts.\n                  (1) Prohibited use. Evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not\n          admissible to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a\n          particular occasion the person acted in in accordance with the character.\n                  (2) Permitted uses. This evidence may be admissible for another\n          purpose such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan,\n          knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\n\f                                           12\n\nrule. See, e.g., State v. Putman, 848 N.W.2d 1, 8-9 (Iowa 2014) (discussing the\n\n\u201cthree-step analysis\u201d in determining whether to admit prior-bad-acts evidence).4\n\n       The State claimed evidence of bad acts was presented solely to complete\n\nthe story and was inextricably intertwined evidence, and supported the court\u2019s\n\nproposed jury instruction.     The State argued that because the prior-bad-acts\n\nevidence was inextricably intertwined to the story, rule 5.404(b) was inapplicable.\n\n       \u201cInextricably intertwined evidence is evidence of the surrounding\n\ncircumstances of the crime in a causal, temporal, or spatial sense, incidentally\n\nrevealing additional, but uncharged, criminal activity.\u201d         State v. Nelson, 791\n\nN.W.2d 414, 420 (Iowa 2010) (citation omitted). Our supreme court discussed\n\nthe inextricably intertwined doctrine in Nelson, stating:\n\n       The inextricably intertwined doctrine bypasses rule 5.404(b)\n       because rule 5.404(b), by its express terms, is only applicable to\n       evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts, which is considered to\n       be extrinsic evidence. Edward J. Imwinkelried, The Second\n       Coming of Res Gestae: A Procedural Approach to Untangling the\n       \u201cInextricably Intertwined\u201d Theory for Admitting Evidence of an\n       Accused\u2019s Uncharged Misconduct, 59 Cath. U.L. Rev. 719, 724-25\n       (2010).\n               . . . [B]ecause rule 5.404(b) is inapplicable to inextricably\n       intertwined evidence, the court admits the technically uncharged-\n       crime evidence without limitation and irrespective of its unfair\n       prejudice or its bearing on the defendant\u2019s bad character. Instead,\n       the inextricably intertwined evidence is subject to the same general\n       admissibility requirements as other evidence that is used to provide\n       the fact finder with a complete picture of the charged crime.\n               In summary, the inextricably intertwined doctrine permits the\n       admission of other crimes, wrongs, or acts evidence based on a\n       special relationship between this evidence and the charged crime,\n       regardless of the strictures of rule 5.404(b).\n\n\n4\n  \u201cIf the evidence is [1] relevant to a legitimate and disputed factual issue, and [2] the\nclear-proof requirement is satisfied, [3] the court must determine whether the evidence\u2019s\n\u2018probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the\ndefendant.\u2019\u201d Putman, 848 N.W.2d at 9 (citation omitted).\n\f                                         13\n\nId. at 420 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). The Nelson court observed,\n\n              Although Iowa has never referred to other crimes, wrongs, or\n       acts evidence as inextricably intertwined, we have long recognized\n       the rule that, \u201c[w]hen acts are so closely related in time and place\n       and so intimately connected that they form a continuous\n       transaction, the whole transaction may be shown to complete the\n       story of what happened [even though they may incidentally show\n       the commission of another uncharged crime].\u201d\n\nId. at 422 (alteration in original) (citation omitted). The court adopted the doctrine\n\nbut concluded it should be \u201cused infrequently and as a narrow exception.\u201d Id. at\n\n423.\n\n              To ensure a court does not admit unnecessary and\n       prejudicial evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts, we reaffirm\n       the language from one of our earlier cases and hold we will only\n       allow such evidence to complete the story of what happened when\n       the other crimes, wrongs, or acts evidence is so closely related in\n       time and place and so intimately connected to the crime charged\n       that it forms a continuous transaction. [State v.] Oppelt, 329\n       N.W.2d [17,] 19 [(Iowa 1983)]. Thus, the charged and uncharged\n       crimes, wrongs, or acts must form a continuous transaction. Id.\n       Moreover, we will only allow the admission of other crimes, wrongs,\n       or acts evidence to complete the story of the charged crime when a\n       court cannot sever this evidence from the narrative of the charged\n       crime without leaving the narrative unintelligible, incomprehensible,\n       confusing, or misleading. In this way, we can be sure rule 5.404(b)\n       remains the standard for the admission of evidence of other crimes,\n       wrongs, or acts and the inextricably intertwined doctrine is\n       construed as a narrow and limited exception to rule 5.404(b).\n\nId. at 423-24 (emphasis added).\n\n       Shawhan does not dispute that evidence of his absence from Fort Des\n\nMoines, drug use at the apartment, and the manner in which Martin left the\n\napartment with Shawhan was inextricably intertwined with the story of the\n\nassault. Consequently, rule 5.404(b) is not applicable. See id. at 420, 424. This\n\nconclusion, however, does not completely resolve Shawhan\u2019s complaint because\n\f                                         14\n\n\nthe court ultimately instructed the jury as provided in its Proposed Instruction No.\n\n18.5\n\n         Shawhan also complains the court\u2019s instruction \u201cspecifically told the jury\n\nShawhan\u2019s illegal acts could be considered for any one of the listed purposes\n\n[motive, intent, identity].\u201d He asserts this is impermissible under Nelson. If the\n\nevidence presented by the State was for the sole purpose to complete the story\n\nand was inextricably intertwined evidence, then the jury should not have been\n\ninstructed that it could use the evidence for one of the listed purposes identified\n\nin the jury instruction used by the court. If the State intended to use the evidence\n\nfor one of the listed purposes, then Shawhan\u2019s instruction correctly identified the\n\nState\u2019s burden and the process the jury was to consider in its deliberations.\n\n         The problem with Shawhan\u2019s argument here is that Shawhan has not\n\nidentified any testimony or argument where the State attempted to show or argue\n\nthe inextricably-intertwined evidence of bad acts was proof of or should be used\n\nby the jury to infer any of the identified purposes in the instruction. We will not\n\ncomb the record for facts to support an argument. Hyler v. Garner, 548 N.W.2d\n\n864, 876 (Iowa 1996). Instead, Shawhan only speculates that the jury could\n\nhave used the inextricably-intertwined evidence of bad acts for one of those\n\npurposes. Because we are unable to conclude the State relied upon any bad\n\nacts to prove any of the identified purposes or, for that matter, any other purpose\n\nthan to complete the story, the second paragraph of Instruction No. 17 was more\n\nakin to being superfluous than erroneous\u2014it properly recited the language in rule\n\n\n\n5\n    See above at page ten.\n\f                                            15\n\n5.404(b). See State v. Thorndike, 860 N.W.2d 316, 322 (Iowa 2015) (finding\n\ndefendant did not suffer prejudice from superfluous alternative in instruction).\n\n       Nonetheless, we believe it is also prudent to examine this issue as a\n\nrefusal to give a requested instruction.            Certainly, Shawhan submitted a\n\nrequested instruction that was more complete in describing the law than did\n\nInstruction No. 17. Here, Shawhan has not contended there was a violation of\n\nthe constitution. In Plain, our supreme court stated,\n\n       \u201cWhen the error is not of constitutional magnitude, the test of\n       prejudice is whether it sufficiently appears that the rights of the\n       complaining party have been injuriously affected or that the party\n       has suffered a miscarriage of justice.\u201d \u201cWe [do] not reverse for\n       marginal or technical omissions . . . .\u201d\n\n898 N.W.2d at 817 (alteration in original) (citations omitted).\n\n       But even if the refusal to instruct as Shawhan requested was an error at\n\nlaw, we are unable to conclude Shawhan was prejudiced by the use of the\n\ninstruction on bad acts. As we have previously noted, Shawhan cannot point to\n\nany evidence or argument where the State relied upon the bad acts to prove\n\nanything other than to complete the story. Moreover, there was strong evidence\n\nof Shawhan\u2019s guilt.\n\n       Shawhan also argues he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s instruction\n\nbecause it used \u201cillegal acts\u201d rather than \u201cwrongful acts.\u201d He asserts, \u201c[T]he court\n\nwas essentially conveying to the jury that Shawhan had, in fact, committed other\n\nillegal acts.\u201d \u201cError in jury instructions is reversible only if the error is prejudicial.\u201d\n\nState v. Ambrose, 861 N.W.2d 550, 554 (Iowa 2015) (citation omitted). We are\n\nhard pressed to conclude the use of the term \u201cillegal acts\u201d was prejudicial where\n\f                                          16\n\n\nShawhan admitted he absconded from a correctional facility and used\n\nmethamphetamine and other controlled substances.\n\n       C. Standard used to rule upon the motion for new trial. Shawhan next\n\nasserts the trial court used the wrong standard to rule on his motion for new trial,\n\ni.e., the sufficiency of the evidence rather than the weight of the evidence. The\n\nrecord belies that claim, and we do not address it further.\n\n       D. Ineffective assistance of counsel.       In a supplemental pro se brief,\n\nShawhan asserts his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to additional\n\njury instructions\u2014those setting out the elements of assault, defining a\n\n\u201cdangerous weapon,\u201d and causation.6\n\n       There is a strong presumption that trial counsel performed competently.\n\nState v. Graves, 668 N.W.2d 860, 881 (Iowa 2003). \u201cThe benchmark for judging\n\nany claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined\n\nthe proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on\n\nas having produced a just result.\u201d Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686\n\n(1984).\n\n       Where an erroneous-instruction claim is raised on direct appeal in the\n\ncontext of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, we must decide whether it\n\ncan be determined as a matter of law that Shawhan\u2019s counsel failed in an\n\nessential duty and Shawhan was prejudiced as a result. See State v. Fountain,\n\n786 N.W.2d 260, 263 (Iowa 2010). The defendant must demonstrate both a\n\n6\n Shawhan refers to Instruction No. 27 as the \u201cwounds-inflicted\u201d instruction. Instruction\nNo. 27 provides:\n              The act of hitting a person with a baseball bat results in the death\n       of that person if those actions caused or directly contributed to that\n       person\u2019s death.\n\f                                             17\n\nbreach of duty and prejudice by a preponderance of the evidence. Ledezma,\n\n626 N.W.2d at 142. We also note, \u201cCounsel has no duty to raise an issue that\n\nhas no merit.\u201d Fountain, 786 N.W.2d at 263. Moreover, \u201c[i]f the claim lacks\n\nprejudice, it can be decided on that ground alone without deciding whether the\n\nattorney performed deficiently.\u201d Ledezma, 626 N.W.2d at 142.\n\n                 1. Assault instruction. \u201c[T]he crime of assault includes a specific\n\nintent element.\u201d Fountain, 786 N.W.2d at 265. Shawhan contends the assault\n\njury instruction given by the trial court did not require a finding of specific intent.\n\nHere, the court instructed the jury:\n\n         An assault is committed when a person does an act which is meant\n         to:\n                1. Cause pain or injury to another person; or\n                2. Result in physical contact which will be insulting or\n         offensive to another person; or\n                3. Place another person in fear of immediate physical\n         contact which will be painful, injurious, insulting or offensive to the\n         other person, when coupled with apparent ability to do the act.\n\nThe jury was also given an instruction on specific intent.7\n\n         In State v. Pendleton, this court found such \u201cmeant to\u201d language in an\n\nassault instruction \u201cused plain language to explain the intent required for assault.\u201d\n\nNo. 13-1647, 2014 WL 6977188, at *5 (Iowa Ct. App. Dec. 10, 2014); accord\n\nState v. Clark, No. 14-2035, 2016 WL 1130286, at *6 (Iowa Ct. App. Mar. 23,\n\n\n7\n    Instruction No. 20 provided:\n                  \u201cSpecific intent\u201d means not only being aware of doing an act and\n          doing it voluntarily, but in addition, doing it with a specific purpose in\n          mind.\n                  Because determining the defendant\u2019s specific intent requires you\n          to decide what he was thinking when an act was done, it is seldom\n          capable of direct proof. Therefore, you should consider the facts and\n          circumstances surrounding the act to determine the defendant\u2019s specific\n          intent. You may, but are not required to, conclude a person intends the\n          natural results of his acts.\n\f                                           18\n\n\n2016). We find these cases persuasive and conclude counsel was not required\n\nto object to the instruction given.\n\n                 2. Dangerous weapon instruction. The jury here was instructed that\n\n\u201c[m]alice aforethought may be inferred from a defendant\u2019s use of a dangerous\n\nweapon.\u201d8 The following instruction defined a dangerous weapon:9\n\n                 A \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d is any device or instrument designed\n          primarily for use in inflicting death or injury, and when used in its\n          designed manner is capable of inflicting death. It is also any sort of\n          instrument or device which is actually used in such a way as to\n          indicate the user intended to inflict death or serious injury, and\n          when so used is capable of inflicting death.\n\n          Shawhan asserts trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the\n\ninclusion of the first sentence of the instruction and to argue a baseball bat was\n\nnot a dangerous weapon thereunder. As to this assertion, we conclude Shawhan\n\ncannot establish he was prejudiced by the superfluous language of the\n\ninstruction. See Thorndike, 860 N.W.2d at 322.\n\n                 3. Causation. Finally, Shawhan argues Instruction No. 27 allowed\n\nthe jury to find him guilty if \u201ca person\u201d\u2014not necessarily Butts\u2014was hit with a\n\nbaseball bat resulting in death. This instruction supplements Instructions No. 24\n\nand No. 34, however, which contain the elements of the offenses of first-degree\n\nand second-degree murder. Each required the State to prove \u201cthe defendant\n\nassaulted Jeffrey Butts with a baseball bat.\u201d Read as a whole, the jury was\n\nadequately informed of the elements of the offenses and that it was the\n\ndefendant that must have caused Butts\u2019s death. See Plain, 898 N.W.2d at 838\n\n\n\n8\n    Instruction No. 29.\n9\n    Instruction No. 30.\n\f                                       19\n\n\n(Waterman, J., concurring specially) (\u201cIowa jury instructions are to be read as a\n\nwhole.\u201d).\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\f",
