Alvarez, Justice\n\nDelivered and Filed: September 5, 2018\n\nAFFIRMED\n\n           A jury found Appellant Rebecca Desrochers (\u201cDesrochers\u201d) guilty of aggravated assault\n\nwith a deadly weapon, and the trial court assessed punishment at confinement for five years. In a\n\nsingle issue on appeal, Desrochers argues the evidence is legally insufficient to support the jury\u2019s\n\nverdict. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n                                            Background\n\n           Diana Nava attended a party at her sister\u2019s townhouse in east San Antonio on the evening\n\nof April 22, 2016. When the party began winding down, Nava stepped out onto the front porch\n\f                                                                                       04-17-00650-CR\n\n\nwith two of her friends and her cousin. At the time, Nava saw Desrochers sitting on her front porch\n\nnext door. Desrochers and Nava had a verbal altercation, and Desrochers told Nava she was going\n\nto \u201ckick [Nava\u2019s] ass.\u201d As Nava turned around to go back inside the townhouse, she heard\n\napproximately four gun shots. Nava was struck by bullets in the upper back and neck. A lead\n\nfragment lodged in the windshield of a truck parked in front of the two porches. The party guest\n\nwho owned the truck testified the lead fragment was not present in the windshield prior to the\n\nparty.\n\n         Nava\u2019s cousin, Jasmine Cervantes, was inside the townhouse when she heard Nava and\n\nDesrochers arguing outside. Cervantes walked outside onto the porch, where Nava was standing\n\nwith two of her friends. Immediately before the shooting, Cervantes heard Nava\u2019s friend say \u201cOh,\n\nmy God, she has a gun,\u201d and then Cervantes \u201csaw a bright and loud.\u201d Cervantes saw Desrochers\n\nstand up from her wheelchair, turn toward Nava, and pull out a gun. Because it was dark, Cervantes\n\nonly saw the outline of the gun and explained she could not say what the gun looked like or if it\n\nwas a specific color. Cervantes ran from the porch and, as she did so, saw Desrochers walk back\n\ninto her townhouse.\n\n         San Antonio Police Officer Kody Patterson was in the area and heard gunshots. Officer\n\nPatterson was then dispatched to the scene, where he observed Nava\u2019s injuries and called for an\n\nambulance. Officer Patterson walked Nava down the street to the ambulance when it arrived and\n\nthen returned to the townhouses. Officer Patterson observed that Desrochers had been taken into\n\ncustody and \u201cwas just pretty belligerent, aggressive, violent, yelling.\u201d Desrochers was trying to\n\nkick the arresting officers, and \u201c[i]t took two officers to get her into the patrol car just because of\n\nher flailing.\u201d Officer Patterson indicated in his report that the weapon used to shoot Nava was a\n\nhandgun, but he did not personally recover any guns from the scene.\n\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\f                                                                                      04-17-00650-CR\n\n\n       San Antonio Police Detective Corey Pe\u00f1a was the night criminal investigations detective\n\non duty on the night Nava was shot. Detective Pe\u00f1a was dispatched to the scene to conduct the\n\ninitial investigation and to consult with and provide guidance to police officers at the scene.\n\nDetective Pe\u00f1a was on the scene when police searched Desrochers\u2019s townhouse and found a rifle\n\nbehind a large dresser in the living room. No other guns were recovered from the scene. Detective\n\nPe\u00f1a also indicated in his report that the weapon used to shoot Nava was a handgun.\n\n       Steve Saucedo is a forensic scientist in the firearm section of the Bexar County Crime Lab.\n\nSaucedo testified the rifle found in Desrochers\u2019s living room is a revolver carbine capable of firing\n\nboth .22 long rifle and .22 magnum calibers. Saucedo was unable to determine whether the gun\n\nhad been fired recently or whether the lead fragment retrieved from the windshield of a truck at\n\nthe scene was ammunition fired from a gun.\n\n       San Antonio Police Detective Mark Esquivel administered a gun shot residue (\u201cGSR\u201d) test\n\non Desrochers\u2019s hands. Michael Martinez, the forensic scientist supervisor for the Bexar County\n\nCriminal Investigation Laboratory, analyzed the results of the GSR test performed on Desrochers\n\nand did not find any gun shot residue. Martinez explained that not finding gun shot residue is not\n\nunusual even in cases where it is known that the test subject recently fired a gun.\n\n                                            Discussion\n\n       In a single issue on appeal, Desrochers argues the evidence presented at trial is legally\n\ninsufficient to support the conviction.\n\nA.     Standard of review\n\n       In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we examine all the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to the verdict and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have\n\nfound the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443\n\nU.S. 307, 319 (1979); Ramsey v. State, 473 S.W.3d 805, 808 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015). Direct and\n                                                -3-\n\f                                                                                     04-17-00650-CR\n\n\ncircumstantial evidence are equally probative, and circumstantial evidence alone may be sufficient\n\nto uphold a conviction if the cumulative force of all the incriminating circumstances supports the\n\nverdict. Ramsey, 473 S.W.3d at 809. \u201cThe trier of fact is the exclusive judge of the credibility and\n\nweight of the evidence and is permitted to draw any reasonable inference from the evidence so\n\nlong as it is supported by the record.\u201d Id. We are mindful that we may not sit as a thirteenth juror\n\nand substitute our judgment for that of the factfinder. Dewberry v. State, 4 S.W.3d 735, 740 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1999).\n\nB.     Aggravated assault with a deadly weapon\n\n       The jury convicted Desrochers of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, namely: a\n\nfirearm. A defendant commits an assault if she \u201cintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes\n\nbodily injury to another.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.01(a)(1) (West Supp. 2017). The assault is\n\naggravated if the defendant uses or exhibits a deadly weapon during the assault. Id. \u00a7 22.02(a)(2).\n\nA deadly weapon is one that \u201cin the manner of its use or intended use is capable of causing death\n\nor serious bodily injury.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1.07(a)(17)(B) (West Supp. 2018). \u201cSerious bodily injury\u201d is\n\n\u201cbodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death or that causes death, serious permanent\n\ndisfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.\u201d\n\nId. \u00a7 1.07(a)(46). \u201cBodily injury\u201d is \u201cphysical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical\n\ncondition.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1.07(a)(8).\n\nC.     Analysis\n\n       On appeal, Desrochers argues the evidence is legally insufficient to support the conviction\n\nbecause: (1) \u201cconvictions should not be based solely on eye witness identification\u201d; (2) no physical\n\nevidence linked Desrochers to firing or possessing a handgun; (3) the weapon used to shoot Nava\n\nwas not recovered; (4) there was no gunshot residue on Desrochers\u2019s hands; (5) the area where the\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\f                                                                                      04-17-00650-CR\n\n\nshooting occurred is known for frequent shootings; and (6) Desrochers\u2019s mobility issues would\n\nhave prevented her from standing to shoot and then hide a weapon.\n\n       First, because the jury is the exclusive judge of the credibility of witnesses and the weight\n\nof the evidence, the testimony of a single eyewitness can be enough to support a conviction. Smith\n\nv. State, 421 S.W.3d 161, 164 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 2013, no pet.). Here, Jasmine Cervantes\n\nwas standing near Nava when Nava was shot. Cervantes testified she saw Desrochers pull out a\n\ngun and then saw \u201ca bright and loud.\u201d Cervantes testified she saw \u201cthe outline of a gun\u201d in\n\nDesrochers\u2019s hands, although she could not describe the gun because it was dark. Cervantes did\n\nnot testify whether the gun she saw was a handgun or another type of gun.\n\n       Second, the evidence may be sufficient to support a conviction even where there is no\n\nphysical evidence linking the defendant to the crime. Johnson v. State, 176 S.W.3d 74, 77 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, pet. ref\u2019d) (holding evidence legally sufficient to support\n\nconviction for aggravated robbery where complaining witness identified defendant despite lack of\n\nphysical evidence linking defendant to offense); Garza v. State, No. 04-16-00111-CR, 2016 WL\n\n6609205, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio Nov. 9, 2016, no pet.) (mem. op.). In Garza, for instance,\n\nthis court held the evidence was legally sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction for felony\n\nmurder where several witnesses testified the defendant was the shooter, although the result of\n\ngunshot residue testing on the defendant\u2019s hands was inconclusive. 2016 WL 6609205, at *2\u20133.\n\nSimilarly, here, Cervantes testified she saw Desrochers pull out a gun immediately before Nava\n\nwas shot. Although no gunshot residue was found on Desrochers\u2019s hands, a forensic scientist with\n\nthe Bexar County Criminal Investigation Laboratory testified the absence of gunshot residue is not\n\nunusual even in cases where it is known that the test subject recently fired a gun.\n\n       Third, Desrochers argues the weapon used to shoot Nava was never recovered. However,\n\nthe State did not allege the specific type of gun that was used to shoot Nava; rather, the State\n                                                -5-\n\f                                                                                      04-17-00650-CR\n\n\ncharged Desrochers with using \u201ca firearm.\u201d Witnesses testified a revolver carbine rifle was found\n\nin Desrochers\u2019s living room immediately after the shooting, and the only witness who testified that\n\nshe saw Desrochers shoot Nava (Cervantes), testified she could not describe the gun Desrochers\n\nwas holding because it was dark. See Smith, 421 S.W.3d at 164 (holding testimony of a single\n\neyewitness can be enough to support a conviction).\n\n       Finally, there was no testimony or evidence presented during the guilt/innocence phase of\n\nthe trial regarding Desrochers\u2019s alleged mobility issues. Cervantes testified she saw Desrochers\n\nstand up from her wheel chair to shoot Nava and then walk back into her townhouse. Officer\n\nPatterson testified Desrochers kicked at the arresting officers and flailed so much that two officers\n\nwere required to place her in a patrol car.\n\n       Therefore, viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we\n\nconclude a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Desrochers used\n\na deadly weapon to intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly cause serious bodily injury to Nava.\n\nSee Ramsey, 473 S.W.3d at 808. Desrochers\u2019s sole issue on appeal is overruled.\n\n                                              Conclusion\n\n       Because we conclude the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict, we\n\naffirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n                                                  Sandee Bryan Marion, Chief Justice\n\nDO NOT PUBLISH\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f",
