No. S-16-355.\n\n               \u20021.\t Motions to Dismiss: Pleadings: Appeal and Error. An appellate court\n                    reviews a district court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss de novo,\n                    accepting all allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reason-\n                    able inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.\n               \u20022.\t Motions to Dismiss: Pleadings. To prevail against a motion to dismiss\n                    for failure to state a claim, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to state\n                    a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. In cases in which a plaintiff\n                    does not or cannot allege specific facts showing a necessary element, the\n                    factual allegations, taken as true, are nonetheless plausible if they sug-\n                    gest the existence of the element and raise a reasonable expectation that\n                    discovery will reveal evidence of the element or claim.\n               \u20023.\t Appeal and Error. An appellate court independently reviews questions\n                    of law decided by a lower court.\n               \u20024.\t Constitutional Law. The determination of constitutional requirements\n                    presents a question of law.\n               \u20025.\t Statutes. Statutory interpretation presents a question of law.\n               \u20026.\t Tort Claims Act. Whether a plaintiff\u2019s allegations present a claim that\n                    is barred by an exception to the State\u2019s waiver of tort immunity in a tort\n                    claims act presents a question of law.\n               \u20027.\t Tort Claims Act: Immunity: Waiver. Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 81-8,209\n                    (Reissue 2014) bars tort claims against the State, its agencies, and its\n                    employees unless the State has waived its immunity for the claim.\n               \u20028.\t Statutes. Statutes relating to the same subject, although enacted at dif-\n                    ferent times, are in pari materia and should be construed together.\n               \u20029.\t Tort Claims Act: Immunity: Waiver. Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 81-8,215\n                    (Reissue 2014), when read in pari materia with Neb. Rev. Stat.\n                    \u00a7 81-8,209 (Reissue 2014), operates as a limited waiver of the State\u2019s\n                    tort immunity, subject to specified exceptions that are set out in Neb.\n                    Rev.

STATE\n                             Cite as 297 Neb. 955\n\n10.\t Tort Claims Act: Public Officers and Employees: Immunity: Waiver.\n     The exceptions to the waiver of the State\u2019s tort immunity include claims\n     based on the exercise or performance of a discretionary function by a\n     state officer or employee.\n11.\t ____: ____: ____: ____. Under Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 81-8,210 (Reissue\n     2014), whether a plaintiff has sued a state officer or employee in his\n     or her individual capacity is irrelevant to whether the State Tort Claims\n     Act bars a tort claim against that officer or employee. If an officer or\n     employee was acting within the scope of his or her office or employ-\n     ment and the alleged tortious conduct falls within an exception to the\n     State\u2019s waiver of tort immunity, the State Tort Claims Act bars a tort\n     claim against the officer or employee, regardless of the capacity in\n     which he or she was purportedly sued.\n12.\t Jurisdiction: Appeal and Error. An appellate court has an independent\n     duty to decide jurisdictional issues on appeal, even if the parties have\n     not raised the issue.\n13.\t ____: ____. When a trial court lacks the power, that is, jurisdiction, to\n     adjudicate the merits of a claim, an appellate court also lacks the power\n     to adjudicate the merits of the claim.\n14.\t Actions: Jurisdiction: Immunity. A trial court lacks subject matter\n     jurisdiction over an action against the State unless the State has con-\n     sented to suit.\n15.\t Actions: Jurisdiction. Lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised\n     at any time by any party or by the court sua sponte.\n16.\t Courts: Appeal and Error. The doctrine of stare decisis requires that\n     appellate courts adhere to their previous decisions unless the reasons\n     therefor have ceased to exist, are clearly erroneous, or are manifestly\n     wrong and mischievous or unless more harm than good will result from\n     doing so.\n17.\t ____: ____. The doctrine of stare decisis is entitled to great weight,\n     but it does not require an appellate court to blindly perpetuate a prior\n     interpretation of the law if it concludes that prior interpretation was\n     clearly incorrect.\n18.\t Tort Claims Act: Immunity: Waiver: Appeal and Error. An excep-\n     tion to the State\u2019s waiver of immunity under the State Tort Claims Act\n     is an issue that the State may raise for the first time on appeal and that\n     a court may consider sua sponte.\n19.\t Tort Claims Act: Appeal and Error. An appellate court has the power\n     to determine whether a plaintiff\u2019s allegations, taken as true, show that a\n     tort claim is facially barred by an STCA exception under Neb. Rev. Stat.\n     \u00a7 81-8,219 (Reissue 2014).\n20.\t False Imprisonment: Words and Phrases. False imprisonment is\n     the unlawful restraint of a person\u2019s liberty against his or her will. Any\n\f                                      - 957 -\n              Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                      297 Nebraska R eports\n                                DAVIS v. STATE\n                               Cite as 297 Neb. 955\n\n     intentional conduct that results in the placing of a person in a position\n     where he or she cannot exercise his or her will in going where he or she\n     may lawfully go may constitute false imprisonment.\n21.\t Judgments: Appeal and Error. An appellate court may affirm a lower\n     court\u2019s ruling that reaches the correct result, albeit based on differ-\n     ent reasoning.\n22.\t Constitutional Law: Civil Rights: Immunity. States or governmen-\n     tal entities that are considered arms of the State for 11th Amendment\n     purposes are not \u201cpersons\u201d that can be sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n     (2012).\n23.\t ____: ____: ____. Whether a state entity is an arm of the State and\n     entitled to share its 11th Amendment immunity is a question of fed-\n     eral law.\n24.\t Judgments: Civil Rights: Immunity. Whether a money judgment\n     against a state entity would be enforceable against the State is the\n     critical consideration under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2012) for determining\n     whether the entity is an arm of the State and therefore immune from suit\n     by private persons.\n25.\t Actions: Immunity. A suit against a state agency is a suit against the\n     State, and both the State and state agencies can assert the State\u2019s sover-\n     eign immunity against suit.\n26.\t Constitutional Law: Judgments: Probation and Parole: Civil Rights:\n     Immunity. Because any judgment against the Board of Parole would\n     be a judgment against the State, it is cloaked with the State\u2019s 11th\n     Amendment immunity and cannot be named as a defendant in an action\n     brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2012).\n27.\t Actions: Public Officers and Employees: Civil Rights: Liability. A\n     state official sued in his or her official capacity is not a person who can\n     be sued under an action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2012), unless\n     the plaintiff seeks only prospective relief.\n28.\t Actions: Parties: Public Officers and Employees: Liability:\n     Damages. When a plaintiff seeks money damages against a state officer\n     or employee in his or her official capacity, the State is the real party in\n     interest, because the officer\u2019s liability in that capacity is liability for the\n     state entity that the officer represents.\n29.\t Actions: Public Officers and Employees: Civil Rights: Immunity:\n     Damages. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2012), the State\u2019s sovereign immu-\n     nity does not bar a claim for damages against state officials and employ-\n     ees who are sued in their personal capacities.\n30.\t Actions: Public Officers and Employees: Civil Rights: Liability. To\n     establish personal liability in an action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n     (2012), it is enough to show that the official, acting under color of state\n     law, caused the deprivation of a federal right.\n\f                                     - 958 -\n              Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                      297 Nebraska R eports\n                               DAVIS v. STATE\n                              Cite as 297 Neb. 955\n\n31.\t ____: ____: ____: ____. Acting under the color of state law does not\n     mean that a state official or employee must have been complying with\n     state law. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2012), liability exists as long as the\n     action was taken within the scope of the defendant\u2019s official authority,\n     even if the official or employee abused his or her authority.\n32.\t Actions: Public Officers and Employees: Immunity. State officials\n     sued in their personal capacities, unlike those sued in their official\n     capacities, may assert personal immunity defenses such as objectively\n     reasonable reliance on existing law.\n33.\t Constitutional Law: Due Process. The Due Process Clause of the fed-\n     eral Constitution provides both procedural and substantive protections.\n34.\t Constitutional Law: Probation and Parole. Parolees have a valuable\n     liberty interest in their continued parole even though it depends upon\n     their compliance with parole conditions. Parole is therefore protected by\n     the 14th Amendment and requires at least minimal procedural protec-\n     tions before a State can terminate it.\n35.\t Due Process. The touchstone of due process is protection of the indi-\n     vidual against arbitrary action of government, whether the fault lies in\n     a denial of fundamental procedural fairness or in the exercise of power\n     without any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate gov-\n     ernmental objective.\n36.\t Due Process: Public Officers and Employees. The due process protec-\n     tion in the substantive sense limits what the government may do in both\n     its legislative and its executive capacities. But the criteria to identify\n     what is fatally arbitrary differ depending on whether it is legislation or a\n     specific act of a governmental officer that is at issue.\n37.\t ____: ____. Only the most egregious official conduct can be said to be\n     arbitrary in the constitutional sense. The substantive component of the\n     Due Process Clause is violated by executive action only when it can\n     properly be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a con-\n     stitutional sense.\n38.\t Due Process: Negligence: Liability. Liability for negligently inflicted\n     harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due\n     process.\n39.\t Arrests. Normally, when a State holds an individual in custody, the\n     requisite level of conscience-shocking conduct is deliberate indifference,\n     subject to the caveat that the standard is sensibly employed only when\n     actual deliberation is practical.\n40.\t Constitutional Law: Arrests. A plaintiff states a cognizable constitu-\n     tional violation under the 8th or 14th Amendment when the plaintiff\n     alleges that a state defendant\u2014who had knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s\n     complaint that he or she was being unlawfully detained and the author-\n     ity to investigate that complaint\u2014was deliberately indifferent to the\n\f                                       - 959 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       297 Nebraska R eports\n                                 DAVIS v. STATE\n                                Cite as 297 Neb. 955\n\n       plaintiff\u2019s liberty interest and the defendant\u2019s failure to take action\n       resulted in the plaintiff\u2019s continued unlawful detention for more than\n       an insignificant period.\n41.\t   Public Officers and Employees: Immunity: Damages: Words and\n       Phrases. Public officials performing a quasi-judicial function have\n       absolute immunity from damages for acts they commit within the scope\n       of that function. A quasi-judicial function refers to one that is closely\n       related to the judicial process.\n42.\t   Public Officers and Employees: Immunity: Liability. In determining\n       whether to grant quasi-judicial immunity, courts examine the nature of\n       the functions with which a particular official or class of officials has\n       been lawfully entrusted to evaluate the effect that exposure to particu-\n       lar forms of liability would likely have on the appropriate exercise of\n       those functions.\n43.\t   Probation and Parole. The Board of Parole\u2019s mere reliance on evidence\n       presented to it does not change the nature of its function of exercising\n       independent discretion whether to grant, deny, or revoke parole.\n44.\t   Public Officers and Employees: Civil Rights: Immunity: Pleadings.\n       Most executive officials and employees are limited to asserting qualified\n       immunity as an affirmative defense against a personal capacity claim\n       under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2012).\n45.\t   Constitutional Law: Public Officers and Employees: Immunity:\n       Damages: Proof. Qualified immunity shields state officials from money\n       damages unless a plaintiff alleges facts that would, if proved, show (1)\n       the official violated a federally guaranteed right and (2) the constitu-\n       tional or statutory right was clearly established at the time of the chal-\n       lenged conduct.\n46.\t   Actions: Immunity. Because qualified immunity is immunity from suit,\n       a trial court should try to resolve immunity questions at the earliest pos-\n       sible stage in litigation.\n47.\t   Actions: Public Officers and Employees: Immunity: Liability.\n       Whether an official protected by qualified immunity may be held per-\n       sonally liable for an allegedly unlawful official action generally turns on\n       the objective legal reasonableness of the action, assessed in light of the\n       legal rules that were clearly established at the time it was taken.\n48.\t   Constitutional Law: Public Officers and Employees. Whether a fed-\n       eral right is clearly established presents a question of law. A court must\n       consider whether the law is clearly established as it relates to the partic-\n       ular facts of a case. The unlawfulness of a defendant\u2019s conduct must be\n       obvious or apparent in the light of preexisting law. That is, the contours\n       of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would\n       understand that his or her conduct violates that right.\n\f                                     - 960 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        297 Nebraska R eports\n                                DAVIS v. STATE\n                               Cite as 297 Neb. 955\n\n49.\t ____: ____. To show a clearly established federal right, the U.S.\n     Supreme Court does not require a case to be directly on point, but exist-\n     ing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question\n     beyond debate.\n50.\t ____: ____. A federal right can be established by a robust consensus of\n     cases of persuasive authority.\n51.\t Public Officers and Employees: Negligence: Immunity. Showing\n     that a state defendant was negligent is insufficient to defeat a quali-\n     fied immunity defense. Qualified immunity gives government officials\n     breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments and pro-\n     tects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate\n     the law.\n52.\t Actions: Civil Rights: Liability. Vicarious liability is unavailable in an\n     action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2012).\n\n  Appeal from the District Court for Lancaster County: Lori\nA. M aret, Judge.

Davis appeals from the district court\u2019s order that\ndismissed his negligence claim under the State Tort Claims\nAct (STCA)1 and his due process and Eighth Amendment\nclaims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2012). Davis alleged that\nstate officials and employees of the Nebraska Board of Parole\n(Parole Board) and the Department of Correctional Services\n(Department) were liable for mistakenly concluding that he\nwas subject to a mandatory minimum sentence for a 1995\n\n\u20021\t\n      Neb.

STATE\n                              Cite as 297 Neb. 955\n\nhabitual criminal conviction. Because of this mistake, the\nParole Board revoked his parole and reincarcerated him for\nnearly 2 months before releasing him on parole again. The dis-\ntrict court concluded that all of Davis\u2019 claims were barred by\nsovereign immunity, qualified immunity, or pleading deficien-\ncies, and dismissed his complaint against all defendants.\n   We overrule Nebraska cases holding that an exception to\nthe State\u2019s waiver of immunity for tort claims under the STCA\nis an affirmative defense that the State must plead and prove.\nBecause the exceptions are jurisdictional in nature, we hold\nthat a court can consider an STCA exception sua sponte and for\nthe first time on appeal. Here, we conclude that the exception\nfor claims of false imprisonment applies, which exception bars\nDavis\u2019 tort claim under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\nWe further conclude that the court did not err in ruling that the\ndefendants were shielded from Davis\u2019 \u00a7 1983 action by abso-\nlute or qualified immunity.\n\n                     II. BACKGROUND\n   We glean the historical facts leading up to this action from\nthe allegations in Davis\u2019 complaint.2\n\n          1. Davis\u2019 A rrest, Pleas, and Sentencing\n   On May 10, 1995, Davis was charged with 11 different\ncrimes and was alleged to be a habitual offender. In January\n1996, under a plea agreement, Davis pled no contest to count I,\nattempted murder in the second degree, and count II, use of\na deadly weapon to commit a felony. The State dismissed the\nremaining charges. In March, the court determined that Davis\nwas a habitual offender and sentenced him to a term of 20\nto 30 years\u2019 imprisonment for count I and a term of 10 to\n20 years\u2019 imprisonment for count II, with the terms to be\nserved consecutively.\n\n\u20022\t\n      See Jacob v.

Changes to H abitual Criminal Sentencing\n   Before June 1995, the habitual criminal statute3 provided\nthe following:\n      Whoever has been twice convicted of a crime, sentenced,\n      and committed to prison . . . for terms of not less than one\n      year each shall, upon conviction of a felony committed in\n      this state, be deemed to be an habitual criminal and shall\n      be punished by imprisonment . . . for a term of not less\n      than ten nor more than sixty years . . . .4\n   In June 1995, the Legislature amended \u00a7 29-2221 to pro-\nvide a mandatory minimum sentence for habitual criminal\nconvictions:\n      Whoever has been twice convicted of a crime, sentenced,\n      and committed to prison . . . for terms of not less than one\n      year each shall, upon conviction of a felony committed in\n      this state, be deemed to be an habitual criminal and shall\n      be punished by imprisonment . . . for a mandatory mini-\n      mum term of ten years and a maximum term of not more\n      than sixty years . . . .5\nOther mandatory minimums apply if a defendant has been con-\nvicted of felonies not at issue here.6 This amendment became\neffective in September 1995,7 after Davis committed his crimes\nbut before he entered his pleas and was sentenced.\n   Mandatory minimum sentences carry two consequences that\na minimum term sentence comprising the same number of\nyears does not. First, a \u201cperson convicted of a felony for which\na mandatory minimum sentence is prescribed shall not be\neligible for probation.\u201d8 Second, the offender cannot become\n\n\u20023\t\n      See Neb.

Davis\u2019 R elease and R eincarceration\n   In 2012, Davis was paroled. In 2014, the Department\nobtained warrants to arrest released prisoners for whom it had\nmiscalculated their release dates. Davis\u2019 name was not on that\nlist. But an unknown person later added his name to this list,\nand a warrant was issued for his arrest. In June, Davis was\ninformed by his parole officer that he needed to turn himself\nin because his parole eligibility date had been miscalculated.\nDavis had not violated his parole, and he was employed.\nBefore turning himself in to the Department on June 25, he\ninformed the Department and his parole officer that the man-\ndatory minimum provision did not apply to him and that his\nparole eligibility date was correct. Neither the Department nor\nthe Parole Board investigated his claim.\n   At a parole hearing on July 29, 2014, the Parole Board\nrevoked his parole despite his continued claim that he was not\nsubject to the mandatory minimum amendment. On August 22,\nDavis was released again and given a certificate of parole. Six\nmonths after filing a \u201cState Torts Claim\u201d with the State\u2019s risk\nmanagement division, Davis filed this action.\n                      4. Davis\u2019 Claims\n   Davis named 16 defendants in his complaint: the State;\nthe Department; the Attorney General\u2019s office; the Parole\nBoard; the former governor; the former Attorney General; the\nDepartment\u2019s former director, former records administrator,\nformer general counsel, and two of its former attorneys; the\nParole Board\u2019s former and current chairpersons, its former vice\n\n\u20029\t\n      See, Neb.

He sued all\nof the state officers and employees in their official and indi-\nvidual capacities.\n   For Davis\u2019 negligence claim under the STCA, he alleged\nthat all the state defendants owed him a duty not to violate\nhis civil rights and not to reincarcerate him or cause his rein-\ncarceration unless he had violated his parole. Davis alleged,\ncondensed, that the defendants breached these duties when,\ndespite his protests, they (1) failed to research the correct law\nand applied the wrong law to calculate his parole eligibility\ndate, (2) determined that he had not served enough time, (3)\nadded his name to a list of persons who should be arrested,\nand (4) reincarcerated him for 59 days when he should have\nbeen on parole.\n   Davis alleged that in 1997, the Attorney General issued\nan opinion at the request of the Department\u2019s director at that\ntime.10 The Attorney General stated that generally, the good\ntime provisions in effect when an offender committed the\noffense are the ones that apply to calculating the offender\u2019s\nsentence,11 unless a later amendment increases the amount\nof credit that an offender can receive.12 Davis alleged a lack\nof institutional oversight, implementing policies, and train-\ning; and he alleged deliberate indifference to his rights. He\nalleged that he lost his job as a valet, his engraving business,\nand the house he was renting and that his arrest had strained\nhis relationship with his girlfriend and his family. He alleged\nthat this stress led to two occasions when he attempted suicide\nwhile incarcerated.\n   For his \u00a7 1983 due process claim, Davis alleged that the\ndefendants\u2019 \u201cacts, omissions, policies and practices [were] a\nsubstantial departure from accepted professional judgment, . . .\n\n10\t\n      Att\u2019y Gen.

Hearing on Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss\n   The defendants moved to dismiss Davis\u2019 negligence claim\nand \u00a7 1983 claims under Neb. Ct. R. Pldg. \u00a7 6-1112(b)(1)\nand (6). Their motion did not set out any specific grounds\nfor a dismissal. At the hearing, the defendants argued that\nbecause Nebraska courts have held that the Parole Board\u2019s\nfunctions are quasi-judicial and inherently discretionary, Davis\u2019\nclaims against its members were not cognizable. They also\nargued that because the Parole Board had exclusive jurisdic-\ntion over Davis\u2019 parole revocation, the court should dismiss\nDavis\u2019 claims against the other defendants. Alternatively, they\nargued that Davis\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims were deficient, because he\nhad not alleged that the defendants were personally involved in\ndetermining that his parole should be revoked or in procuring\nhis reincarceration. Regarding Davis\u2019 deliberate indifference\nallegations, the State argued that he would have to allege that\nthe defendants knew he should not be reincarcerated and that\nthey did so despite that knowledge. Regarding Davis\u2019 negli-\ngence claim, the State argued that the defendants who were not\nBoard members were immune from suit under the doctrine of\nsovereign immunity, because they were performing a discre-\ntionary function.\n   Davis responded that the Department is the main state\nagency with the duty to determine parole eligibility dates and\nrelease dates from mandatory minimum sentences. He argued\nthat these duties were ministerial and not discretionary and\nthat the Parole Board was not entitled to quasi-judicial immu-\nnity. He argued that his release on parole 2 months after he\nwas reincarcerated showed that the only reason for his parole\n\f                               - 966 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                          DAVIS v. STATE\n                         Cite as 297 Neb. 955\n\nrevocation was an incorrect calculation of his parole eligibil-\nity date.\n   Davis also argued that the Department had continuing\nduties\u2014before, during, and after his parole revocation\u2014to\nreview the record, apply the law correctly, and inform the\nParole Board of its determinations. He argued that these duties\nshowed other state actors besides the Parole Board were\ninvolved in his parole revocation and reincarceration. As a\nresult, he argued that he could not yet plead with particular-\nity and that the court could not yet determine whether any of\nthe defendants were entitled to qualified immunity, because he\nhad not had an opportunity to discover what each state actor\nhad done.\n\n                        6. Court\u2019s Order\n   The court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. In its\norder, the court concluded that the Parole Board and its mem-\nbers were immune from Davis\u2019 claims, because they perform a\nquasi-judicial function that is inherently discretionary. It stated\nthat Davis\u2019 claims against the Parole Board\u2019s members arose\nsolely out of their official function and that Nebraska law did\nnot permit civil damages for decisions involving discretion.\nIt dismissed Davis\u2019 claims against the Parole Board and its\nmembers with prejudice.\n   The court dismissed Davis\u2019 claims against the defendants\nwho were not members of the Parole Board, because all\nof his claims arose from the revocation of his parole. The\ncourt determined that they were not involved in the revoca-\ntion proc\u00adess and had no authority over the decision and that\nDavis had not alleged any facts connecting them to the revo-\ncation. It concluded that despite Davis\u2019 allegations about the\nDepartment\u2019s duties, the Parole Board had exclusive jurisdic-\ntion over his parole revocation, which did not involve the\nAttorney General\u2019s office or any other defendant who was not\na Parole Board member.\n\f                              - 967 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   297 Nebraska R eports\n                         DAVIS v. STATE\n                        Cite as 297 Neb. 955\n\n   Regarding Davis\u2019 negligence claim, the court reasoned\nthat under the STCA, the State can be liable only to the\nsame extent as a private person would be under similar\ncircumstances and a private person cannot revoke parole.\nAdditionally, the court concluded that Davis\u2019 \u201cnegligence\naction triggers the discretionary function exception [to the\nState\u2019s waiver of immunity] because his claims are based\nupon State employees\u2019 executing Nebraska statutes . . . and\nperforming discretionary functions.\u201d\n   Regarding Davis\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims, the court concluded that\nhis claims against the State, state agencies, and state defend\u00ad\nants in their official capacities were barred by sovereign immu-\nnity. It additionally found that the claims were not cognizable,\nbecause Davis had failed to \u201cplead with any specificity that\nany named Defendant actually participated in any alleged\nconstitutional violation.\u201d Alternatively, the court ruled that the\ndefendants were entitled to qualified immunity from Davis\u2019\ndue process and Eighth Amendment claims. It concluded that\nthe defendants\u2019 mistaken belief that Davis\u2019 parole eligibility\ndate was correct did not deprive them of qualified immunity,\nbecause there is \u201cno \u2018clearly established constitutional right\u2019\nmaking State officials individually liable for erroneous parole\nrevocations under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d\n                III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Davis assigns, consolidated and restated, that the court erred\nas follows:\n   (1) in dismissing all of his claims with prejudice;\n   (2) in determining that the Parole Board and its members are\nimmune from his claims;\n   (3) in determining that the defendants who are not Parole\nBoard members cannot be held liable for his reincarceration;\n   (4) in failing to weigh the role that the defendants who are\nnot Parole Board members played in his reincarceration;\n   (5) in determining that the State has not waived its sovereign\nimmunity for his negligence claim;\n\f                                    - 968 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       297 Nebraska R eports\n                               DAVIS v.

STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1,2] We review a district court\u2019s order granting a motion\nto dismiss de novo, accepting all allegations in the complaint\nas true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the\nnonmoving party.13 To prevail against a motion to dismiss for\nfailure to state a claim, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to\nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.14 In cases in\nwhich a plaintiff does not or cannot allege specific facts show-\ning a necessary element, the factual allegations, taken as true,\nare nonetheless plausible if they suggest the existence of the\nelement and raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will\nreveal evidence of the element or claim.15\n   [3-6] We independently review questions of law decided by\na lower court.16 The determination of constitutional require-\nments presents a question of law.17 Statutory interpretation\npresents a question of law.18 Whether a plaintiff\u2019s allegations\npresent a claim that is barred by an exception to the State\u2019s\nwaiver of tort immunity in a tort claims act presents a question\nof law.19\n\n13\t\n      Jacob, supra note 2.\n14\t\n      First Neb.

State Officers and Employees Acting Within\n           Scope of Their Offices or Employment Can\n             Be Sued for Tortious Conduct Only in\n                    Their Official Capacities\n   Davis contends that he sued the defendants in their indi-\nvidual capacities and that some of the state employees acted\noutside of the scope of their duties. The State responds that\nDavis\u2019 negligence claim is not cognizable against the state\ndefendants in their individual capacities. We agree.\n   [7] Section 81-8,209 of the STCA bars tort claims against\nthe State, its agencies, and its employees unless the State has\nwaived its immunity for the claim:\n      The State of Nebraska shall not be liable for the torts\n      of its officers, agents, or employees, and no suit shall\n      be maintained against the state, any state agency, or any\n      employee of the state on any tort claim except to the\n      extent, and only to the extent, provided by the [STCA].\n   Section 81-8,215 is the State\u2019s general waiver of tort immu-\nnity under the STCA.20 In relevant part, it provides that the\nState \u201cshall be liable in the same manner and to the same\nextent as a private individual under like circumstances.\u201d\n   [8-10] Statutes relating to the same subject, although\nenacted at different times, are in pari materia and should\nbe construed together.21 Section 81-8,215, when read in pari\nmateria with \u00a7 81-8,209, operates as a limited waiver of the\nState\u2019s tort immunity, subject to specified exceptions that are\nset out in \u00a7 81-8,219.22 The exceptions to the waiver of the\nState\u2019s tort immunity include claims based on the exercise\n\n20\t\n      See Sherrod v.

That is because \u00a7 81-8,210(4) defines a\ntort claim to mean a claim for money damages caused by the\nwrongful or negligent conduct of an officer or employee who\nwas acting \u201cwithin the scope of his or her office or employ-\nment, under circumstances in which the state, if a private\nperson, would be liable to the claimant for such damage, loss,\ninjury, or death.\u201d And \u00a7 81-8,209 authorizes tort liability for a\nstate officer or employee only to the extent the STCA permits.\nSo, under the STCA\u2019s definition of a tort claim, plaintiffs are\nlimited to suing state officers and employees in their offi-\ncial capacities.24 We have held that only when the officer or\nemployee was not acting within the scope of his or her office\nor employment can a plaintiff pursue a tort claim against\nthe officer or employee individually.25 This means that if an\nofficer or employee was acting within the scope of his or her\noffice or employment and the alleged tortious conduct falls\nwithin an exception to the State\u2019s waiver of tort immunity,\nthe STCA bars a tort claim against the officer or employee,\nregardless of the capacity in which he or she was purport-\nedly sued.\n   Here, the state defendants could not have committed the\ntortious acts set out in Davis\u2019 complaint as private individ-\nuals. To the extent that Davis implies that the defendants\nmay have acted in bad faith, that argument is relevant to\n\n23\t\n      See \u00a7 81-8,219(1).\n24\t\n      See Kruger v.

So even if they were negligent or\n abused their authority, Davis\u2019 argument that they might have\n acted outside of the scope of their official duties is without\n\u00admerit.27 Accordingly, whether they were sued in their individual\n capacities is irrelevant to the court\u2019s dismissal of Davis\u2019 negli-\n gence claim.\n               2. State Can R aise STCA Exception\n                     for First Time on A ppeal\n    At oral arguments, the State argued that Davis\u2019 claim arose\nfrom a false imprisonment and was therefore barred by the\nintentional tort exception to the State\u2019s waiver of immunity.\nUnder \u00a7 81-8,219(4), the State\u2019s waiver of immunity does not\napply to \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of . . . false imprisonment . .\n. .\u201d But the State conceded that it did not raise this issue to the\ndistrict court.\n    In Maresh v. State,28 the State chose to raise the immunity\nissue as an affirmative defense. As a result, we held that the\nburden to prove the defense rested on the defendant.29 We\nexpanded this reasoning in Sherrod v.

We then cited four federal appellate decisions32\nand a state court decision33 to hold that the government bears\nthe burden to plead and prove the application of an exception\nto a waiver of sovereign immunity under a tort claims act.34\nBut not all of the cited federal cases supported our holding\nthat a sovereign immunity defense can be waived by failing to\nplead it, and the differences are important.\n   We primarily relied on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s holding in\nStewart v. United States35 that the Federal Tort Claims Act\n(FTCA) \u201cconferred general jurisdiction of the subject matter of\nclaims coming within its purview, and the exceptions referred\nto are available to the government as a defense only when\naptly pleaded and proven.\u201d The court \u201cthus viewed the discre-\ntionary function exception as a waivable affirmative defense\nrather than an impairment of its power to adjudicate.\u201d36\n   We also cited the Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding in Carlyle v.\nUnited States, Dept. of the Army37 that a plaintiff can invoke\njurisdiction only if the complaint is facially outside the excep-\ntions of the FTCA. The court further stated that \u201c[o]nly after\na plaintiff has successfully invoked jurisdiction by a pleading\nthat facially alleges matters not excepted by [the FTCA] does\nthe burden fall on the government to prove the applicability\n\n32\t\n      See Stewart v.

Gaubert,50 the Supreme\nCourt imposed a pleading standard that requires a plaintiff\u2019s\nfactual allegations to support a finding that the FTCA\u2019s discre-\ntionary function exception does not apply when a presumption\nof discretionary conduct exists:\n         When established governmental policy, as expressed\n      or implied by statute, regulation, or agency guidelines,\n      allows a Government agent to exercise discretion, it\n      must be presumed that the agent\u2019s acts are grounded in\n      policy when exercising that discretion.

We hold that an exception to the State\u2019s waiver\nof immunity under the STCA is an issue that the State may\nraise for the first time on appeal and that a court may consider\nsua sponte.\n\n77\t\n      E.g., J.S., supra note 74.\n78\t\n      See cases cited supra notes 28 and 31.\n79\t\n      See Cano v.

STATE\n                               Cite as 297 Neb. 955\n\n   [19] This holding does not mean that the State may liti-\ngate factual disputes relevant to the application of an STCA\nexception for the first time on appeal. But an appellate court\nhas the power to determine whether a plaintiff\u2019s allegations,\ntaken as true, show that a tort claim is facially barred by an\nSTCA exception under \u00a7 81-8,219. We turn to the allegations\nin Davis\u2019 complaint.\n   Davis alleged that he turned himself in to authorities after\nhis parole officer directed him to do so because his parole\neligibility date had been miscalculated. He alleged that he was\nreincarcerated for almost 2 months despite his protests that\nhis parole eligibility date had been correctly calculated. We\nconclude that these allegations, accepted as true, are facially\nwithin the exception to the State\u2019s waiver of immunity for tort\nclaims arising out of false imprisonment.81\n   [20] False imprisonment is the unlawful restraint of a per-\nson\u2019s liberty against his or her will.82 Any intentional conduct\nthat results in the placing of a person in a position where he\nor she cannot exercise his or her will in going where he or\nshe may lawfully go may constitute false imprisonment.83 The\nCourt of Appeals has previously held that a plaintiff\u2019s claim\nthat prison officials detained him past his correct release date\nstated a claim of false imprisonment.84 We agree and conclude\nthat the same reasoning applies here. Davis\u2019 allegations that\nthe prison officials negligently calculated his parole eligibility\ndate does not preclude the application of the false imprison-\nment exception. The heart of his claim is that he was unlaw-\nfully reincarcerated, and no further discovery could correct\nthat fundamental defect in his complaint.

Because the State has\nnot consented to suit for claims arising out of a false imprison-\nment, Davis has not alleged a tort claim that is plausible on\nits face against any named defendant. Although our reasoning\nnecessarily differs from the district court\u2019s, we may affirm a\nlower court\u2019s ruling that reaches the correct result, albeit based\non different reasoning.85 The court did not err in dismissing\nDavis\u2019 tort claim. We turn to his \u00a7 1983 claims.\n          3. Validity of Davis\u2019 \u00a7 1983 Claims Against\n                  State Officers and Employees\n   Davis concedes that the court properly dismissed his \u00a7 1983\nclaims against the State, its agencies, and its employees in\ntheir official capacities. But he contends that the court erred\nin dismissing his \u00a7 1983 claims against the defendants in their\nindividual capacities.

Structurally, the\nParole Board is more an arm of the State than a state agency.\nIt is not a political subdivision or a statutorily created agency.\nIt is a constitutionally created body of state government that is\npart of the executive branch.90 Because any judgment against\nthe Parole Board would be a judgment against the State, it is\ncloaked with the State\u2019s 11th Amendment immunity and cannot\nbe named as a defendant in an action brought under \u00a7 1983.\n\n86\t\n      See Will v.

He is seeking money damages\nfor past deprivations of constitutional rights.

But normally, when\na State holds an individual in custody, the requisite level of\nconscience-shocking conduct is deliberate indifference, sub-\n\u00ad\nject to the caveat that the standard is \u201csensibly employed only\nwhen actual deliberation is practical.\u201d118\n   It is true that courts usually apply the deliberate indiffer-\nence standard of culpability when a State has failed to provide\nfor an inmate\u2019s basic needs.119 But federal courts of appeals\nhave applied the deliberate indifference standard to substantive\ndue process claims involving wrongful detentions.120 \u201cWhen\n\u2018actual deliberation is practical,\u2019 establishing a substantive-\ndue-\u00adprocess violation requires proof of deliberate indifference\n. . . .\u201d121 Some federal courts have explicitly distinguished\nBaker, concluding that the short duration of that detention was\ncrucial to the decision and that Baker did not preclude liability\nunder \u00a7 1983 for all false imprisonment claims.122\n   But in cases involving both an unlawful pretrial detention\nand an overdetention of an inmate, federal courts have held\nthat state officials who are deliberately indifferent to an indi-\nvidual\u2019s claim that he or she is being unlawfully detained vio-\nlate the individual\u2019s substantive due process right to be free\nfrom wrongful incarceration without due process of law.123\n\n118\t\n    See County of Sacramento, supra note 107, 523 U.S. at 851.\n119\t\n    See id.\n120\t\n    See, e.g., Davis v.

Six Unknown Fed.\nNarcotics Agents126 \u201c(the \u00a7 1983 counterpart for actions against\nfederal officials),\u201d127 the Ninth Circuit held that federal prison\nofficials who were deliberately indifferent to an inmate\u2019s claim\nthat they had miscalculated his release date were not entitled\nto qualified immunity.128 The court reasoned that the officials\nhad violated a clear duty to investigate his claim under federal\nregulations and policies when he raised a substantial question\nregarding the accuracy of the agency calculation on which the\nofficials had relied in ignoring his protests.\n   In sum, whether a plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim rests on an alleged\nviolation of the 8th or 14th Amendment or a government offi-\ncial\u2019s violation of a clear regulatory duty intended to protect\nthose rights, federal courts have expressly or implicitly pre-\nmised liability on a finding that the government officials were\n\n124\t\n    See, Burke v.

So we turn to the rea-\nsons that the district court dismissed his claims.\n          (d) Court Properly Dismissed Davis\u2019 \u00a7 1983\n               Claim Against Parole Board and Its\n                   Past and Current Members\n   [41] The court implicitly concluded that the Parole Board\nand its members had absolute immunity from Davis\u2019 claims by\nruling that its members were performing a quasi-judicial func-\ntion. Public officials performing a quasi-judicial function have\nabsolute immunity from damages for acts they commit within\nthe scope of that function.130 A quasi-judicial function refers to\none that is closely related to the judicial process.131\n   [42] In determining whether to grant quasi-judicial immu-\nnity, courts examine the nature of the functions with which\n\n129\t\n    See, Burke, supra note 124; Davis, supra note 120, Moore, supra note\n    124; Alexander, supra note 128.\n130\t\n    See Frey v.

However, quasi-judicial immunity from any suit\n      or damages based upon the performance of duties within\n      a person\u2019s authority attaches not to particular offices, but\n      to particular official functions.133\n   We have previously recognized that the Parole Board exer-\ncises independent discretion in deciding whether to grant parole\nto a convicted offender.134 In addition, federal appellate courts\nhold that parole boards have absolute immunity from suit when\nthey perform quasi-judicial functions such as granting, deny-\ning, or revoking parole.135\n   But Davis contends that the Parole Board was not exercising\ndiscretion in revoking his parole, because it was not reviewing\nhis conduct while on parole. He argues that the revocation\nhearing dealt only with the calculation of his parole eligibility,\nwhich is a ministerial function to which quasi-judicial immu-\nnity does not attach. Davis argues that instead of exercising\ndiscretion, the Board blindly followed the Department\u2019s lead\n\n132\t\n    Id.\n133\t\n    Id. at 188-89, 622 N.W.2d at 624.\n134\t\n    See Pratt v.

In Pratt, we considered an earlier version\nof \u00a7 83-1,110, which set out the calculation requirements for\ndetermining an offender\u2019s parole eligibility date. We held that\nthe finding of parole eligibility is a ministerial duty that can be\nenforced through a writ of mandamus. When we decided Pratt,\na recommendation of parole from an inmate\u2019s sentencing judge\nwas a circumstance that required the Parole Board to consider\nthe inmate for parole, and such a letter had been presented to\nthe Parole Board. We stated that unlike the decision whether to\ngrant parole,\n      a finding of eligibility for parole was not discretionary.\n      Rather, it was the duty of the Board to recognize the\n      offender\u2019s parole eligibility upon a showing of certain\n      facts, regardless of the Board\u2019s own judgment or opinion\n      concerning the propriety or impropriety of such a deter-\n      mination. Therefore, the Board\u2019s duty to recognize [the\n      prisoner\u2019s] parole eligibility was ministerial. The Board\n      did not have to grant [him] parole, but it had the duty to\n      consider him for parole.137\n   [43] But this case is distinguishable from Pratt, because\nthe Parole Board was not refusing to exercise its discretion\nto grant a parole. It was exercising its discretion to revoke\na parole in reliance on information provided to it from the\nDepartment. Nebraska\u2019s statutes require the Department to\nprovide the Parole Board with its calculations,138 and the Parole\nBoard is entitled to rely on them.

Both the Eighth Circuit and the Seventh Circuit have\nheld that under both the 8th and 14th Amendments, inmates\nhave a clearly established right to be free from wrongful,\nprolonged incarceration.152 And we conclude that extending\nthis rule to wrongful recommitments based on a miscalculated\nparole eligibility date is required by the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s\nholding in Morrissey that parolees have a valuable liberty\ninterest in their continued parole.153\n   But the typical miscalculation case involves a State\u2019s wrong-\nful incarceration of an inmate beyond his or her release date.\nDavis has not pointed to a case in which a court has held\nthat a State has or can violate an offender\u2019s 14th Amendment\n\n152\t\n   See, Figgs v. Dawson, 829 F.3d 895 (7th Cir. 2016); Scott, supra note 121.\n153\t\n   See Morrissey, supra note 105.\n\f                                  - 997 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                     297 Nebraska R eports\n                             DAVIS v.

Our research\nhas uncovered only one somewhat comparable federal appel-\nlate decision dealing with a parolee\u2019s delayed release from\nparole.154 Moreover, in Morrissey, the Court held that a lapse\nof 2 months before a parolee receives a revocation hearing for\nan alleged parole violation is not unreasonable.155\n   Given this precedent and the paucity of persuasive case law\ndealing with a State\u2019s deliberate indifference to a parolee\u2019s\nclaim of a mistaken revocation, the Department\u2019s officials\nand employees did not violate a clearly established right to a\nprompt investigation of Davis\u2019 complaint.\n\n          (f) Court Properly Dismissed Davis\u2019 \u00a7 1983\n              Claim Against State Defendants With\n                  No Responsibility for Parole\n                     Eligibility Calculations\n   [53] Vicarious liability is unavailable in a \u00a7 1983 action:\n\u201c[A] plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defend\u00ad\nant, through the official\u2019s own individual actions, has violated\nthe Constitution.\u201d156 But even if Davis could show that the\nstate defendants had knowledge of his complaints and were\ndeliberately indifferent to them, he could not show that they\nshould have known they would violate a clearly established\nright by doing so. The court therefore did not err in dismissing\nhis \u00a7 1983 claims against all the defendants.\n   Because we conclude that the state defendants were entitled\nto qualified immunity against Davis\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims against the\ndefendants, we do not reach his assignment that the court erred\nin determining that he had failed to plead his \u00a7 1983 claims\nwith sufficient specificity.\n\n154\t\n    See Hankins v. Lowe, 786 F.3d 603 (7th Cir. 2015).\n155\t\n    See Morrissey, supra note 105.\n156\t\n    Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 676, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L.

Davis\u2019 Opportunity to A mend\n   Finally, Davis argues that he asked the court for leave to\namend during the hearing and that the court erred in dismiss-\ning his complaint without giving him that opportunity. Under\n\u00a7 6-1115(a), a \u201cparty may amend [its] pleading once as a mat-\nter of course before a responsive pleading is served.\u201d\n   The district court did not specify whether it was dismissing\nDavis\u2019 complaint with prejudice, but we agree that this was\nthe court\u2019s intent. Nevertheless, there is no need to separately\nconsider the appropriateness of that dismissal. Our review of\nDavis\u2019 appeal has subsumed his argument that the court erred\nin dismissing his complaint without an opportunity to amend.\nAnd that review has led us to the conclusion that an amend-\nment would not cure the defects in Davis\u2019 complaint.\n                       VI. CONCLUSION\n   Regarding Davis\u2019 negligence claim, we conclude that the\nclaim rests on allegations that the state defendants unlaw-\nfully reincarcerated him because they miscalculated his parole\neligibility date. As such, his claim is one arising out of false\nimprisonment, which is a claim barred by sovereign immunity,\nbecause it is specifically excepted from the State\u2019s waiver of\nimmunity under the STCA. Although the defendants did not\nraise this exception to the district court, we conclude that an\nSTCA exception can be raised for the first time on appeal and\nconsidered by a court sua sponte.\n   Regarding Davis\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims, the court did not err in\ndismissing his claims against the Parole Board, because its\nmembers were entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity\nfrom suit and the Parole Board itself is an arm of the State\nthat cannot be sued in a \u00a7 1983 action. The court also did not\nerr in dismissing Davis\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims against the remaining\nstate defendants, because he cannot show that they violated a\nclearly established right to a prompt investigation of Davis\u2019\ncomplaint that he was wrongly reincarcerated.\n                                                    A ffirmed.\n\f",
