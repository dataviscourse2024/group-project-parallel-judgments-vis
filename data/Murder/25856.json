His\njurisdictional claim asserted that the district court could not\ncharge him under \u00a7 751(a) because he was not in federal\ncustody at the time of the attempted escape.                His\nprosecutorial vindictiveness claim argued that the timing of\nthe indictment \u2013 filed approximately five months after the\nattempted escape and only after the defendant\u2019s declaration\nwas introduced in his cell mate\u2019s trial \u2013 created a\npresumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness.\n\n    The panel held that the defendant\u2019s unconditional guilty\nplea does not preclude this court from considering the merits\nof his appeal because both of the defendant\u2019s challenges\nqualify as jurisdictional claims.\n\n    The panel held that a federal prisoner remains in federal\n\u201ccustody\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 751(a), even when housed at a\nstate institution pursuant to writ of habeas corpus ad\nprosequendum, and that the district court therefore did not\nerr in refusing to dismiss the indictment for lack of\njurisdiction.\n\n\n    **\n       This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.

Smoot (argued), Assistant United States Attorney,\nUnited States Attorney\u2019s Office, Spokane, Washington, for\nPlaintiff-Appellee.\n\n\n                          OPINION\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge:\n\n     For the first time in this circuit, we address the impact of\na writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum on the question of\nwhether an inmate serving a federal sentence remains under\n\u201cthe custody of the Attorney General\u201d as per 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 751(a) when he is held at a state-run institution pursuant to\nthe writ. Bud Ray Brown appeals the district court's denial\nof his pre-plea motion to dismiss, filed, in part, on the ground\nthat he was not in federal custody as a matter of law at the\ntime of the attempted escape. We now hold that Brown\nremained under the custody of the Attorney General for\npurposes of \u00a7 751(a) despite his incarceration at a state-run\njail, and affirm the judgment of the district court in full.\n\f4                UNITED STATES V. BROWN\n\n                             I.\n\n    In July 2013, Brown was sentenced to a fifteen-year term\nof incarceration after pleading guilty to the possession of a\nfirearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1)&(2). Brown\nwas initially incarcerated at a federal penitentiary in\nVirginia. In July 2014, the State of Washington obtained a\nwrit of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, seeking Brown\u2019s\ntransfer so that he could face a first degree murder charge.\nBrown was thereafter moved to the Spokane County Jail. On\nAugust 20, 2015, persons outside of the jail observed a rope\nhanging from the window of Brown\u2019s cell. Someone had\nremoved the cell\u2019s window and thrown various items out of\nthe opening. Brown shared his cell with another inmate,\nJames Henrikson, who was awaiting trial on federal charges.\nNeither Brown nor Henrikson were immediately charged\nwith attempted escape for this conduct.\n\n    In December 2015, during Henrikson\u2019s trial, the\ngovernment moved to admit the August escape attempt as\nevidence of Henrikson\u2019s guilty conscience. In response,\nHenrikson\u2019s counsel introduced a handwritten declaration\nby Brown stating that Brown, not Henrikson, \u201chad been\nplotting an escape for some time,\u201d and that Brown was the\none responsible for causing damage to the cell window. In\nFebruary 2016, Brown was indicted in the Eastern District\nof Washington on the charge of attempted escape, in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a).\n\n    Brown moved to dismiss the indictment for lack of\njurisdiction or, in the alternative, for prosecutorial\nvindictiveness. Brown\u2019s jurisdictional claim asserted that he\nwas not in federal custody at the time of the attempted\nescape. Therefore, the government could not charge him\nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a).           Brown\u2019s prosecutorial\nvindictiveness claim argued that the timing of the\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. BROWN                      5\n\nindictment\u2014filed approximately five months after the\nattempted escape and only after Brown\u2019s declaration was\nintroduced in Henrikson\u2019s trial\u2014created a presumption of\nprosecutorial vindictiveness. On April 1, 2016, the district\ncourt denied the motion and, immediately thereafter, Brown\nentered a guilty plea without a written plea agreement.\nBrown was later sentenced to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment, to\nrun consecutively with his existing federal sentence. Brown\ntimely filed a Notice of Appeal, challenging the district\ncourt\u2019s adverse ruling on his pretrial motion to dismiss.\n\n                              II.\n\nA. Preclusion\n\n    As a threshold inquiry, we must first determine whether\nBrown\u2019s guilty plea precludes us from considering the merits\nof his appeal. The entry of an unconditional guilty plea\nprecludes appellate review of most challenges to pre-plea\nrulings. See United States v. Jacobo Castillo, 496 F.3d 947,\n954 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (collecting cases). Here,\nBrown\u2019s plea, entered without a written plea agreement or\nother memorialization of reservations, was unconditional.\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2) (stating that, to enter a\nconditional plea, a defendant must reserve in writing \u201cthe\nright to have an appellate court review an adverse\ndetermination of a specified pretrial motion\u201d). We \u201cstrictly\u201d\nread the requirements of Rule 11(a)(2). United States v.\nCortez, 973 F.2d 764, 766 (9th Cir. 1992).\n\n     An unconditional plea does not, however, bar\nconsideration of the merits of all claims arising from pre-\nplea rulings. We may still consider \u201cjurisdictional claims,\u201d\ni.e., those challenging a conviction independently of the\nquestion of factual guilt. See id. at 766\u201267 (\u201cA plea of guilty\nto a charge does not waive a claim that the charge is one\n\f6                    UNITED STATES V. BROWN\n\nwhich the government constitutionally may not prosecute.\u201d);\nsee also Menna v. New York, 423 U.S. 61, 62 n.2 (1975) (per\ncuriam).       Both of Brown\u2019s challenges qualify as\njurisdictional claims. The Supreme Court held in Blackledge\nv. Perry that the merits of a vindictive prosecution claim are\nreviewable even after entry of an unconditional plea because\nthe defendant is contending that \u201cthe very initiation of the\nproceedings against him\u201d constitute a denial of the due\nprocess of law. 417 U.S. 21, 30\u201331 (1974); see also United\nStates v. Garcia-Valenzuela, 232 F.3d 1003, 1005\u201306 (9th\nCir. 2000). Likewise, Brown\u2019s claim involving the legal\nstatus 1 of his custody challenges the government\u2019s power to\nbring the indictment \u201cat the time the plea was entered on the\nbasis of the existing record.\u201d United States v. Broce,\n488 U.S. 563, 575 (1989). If Brown\u2019s confinement did not\nqualify as federal custody, the government would have had\nno grounds from the outset to hail him into court pursuant to\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a). Accordingly, we consider the merits of\neach of these claims in turn. 2\n\n\n    1\n      Repeatedly characterizing the question of federal custody as a\ndispute of fact, the government argues that the claim should be treated\nas an evidentiary challenge. The government misunderstands the\nrelevant issue. None of the facts concerning Brown\u2019s custody\u2014why was\nBrown imprisoned, where was Brown incarcerated, on what basis was\nhe incarcerated at that location\u2014are in dispute. Rather the question is\npurely legal: given the undisputed facts of Brown\u2019s custody, does such\ncustody qualify as \u201ccustody of the Attorney General\u201d as per 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 751(a)?\n\n    2\n      Other claims previously classified as jurisdictional include: double\njeopardy, Menna, 423 U.S. at 62; the district court\u2019s lack of power to\nkeep a defendant in court, Garcia-Valenzuela, 232 F.3d at 1007;\nunconstitutional vagueness, United States v. Sandsness, 988 F.2d 970,\n971 (9th Cir. 1993); failure of the indictment to properly state an offense,\nUnited States v. Broncheau, 597 F.2d 1260, 1262\u201363 (9th Cir. 1979);\n\f                  UNITED STATES V. BROWN                          7\n\nB. Legal Custody Status\n\n    Brown asserts that he was improperly charged with\nattempted escape under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a) because he was\nnot in federal custody at the time of the events in question.\nSection 751(a) applies, in part, to individuals who \u201cescape[]\nor attempt[] to escape from the custody of the Attorney\nGeneral or his authorized representative.\u201d 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 751(a). Brown argues that, even though he was serving a\nsentence imposed by a federal judgment, he was incarcerated\nat the Spokane County Jail pursuant to a writ of habeas\ncorpus ad prosequendum in order to answer state criminal\ncharges.\n\n    We have not previously addressed this precise legal\nquestion: does \u201ccustody of the Attorney General\u201d for\npurposes of \u00a7 751(a) continue when a federal prisoner is held\nat a state prison pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad\nprosequendum? We have, however, previously decided that\na prisoner\u2019s prior custody status persists in the inverse\nscenario: when a state prisoner is transferred to a federal\ndetention facility pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad\nprosequendum. In Thomas v. Brewer, we held that \u201c[w]hen\nan accused is transferred pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus\nad prosequendum he is considered to be \u2018on loan\u2019 to the\nfederal authorities so that the sending state\u2019s jurisdiction\nover the accused continues uninterruptedly.\u201d 923 F.2d 1361,\n1367 (9th Cir. 1991) (quoting Crawford v. Jackson, 589 F.2d\n693, 695 (D.C. Cir. 1978)). We see no basis for\ndistinguishing between the state and federal custody analysis\nin these two scenarios.\n\n\nand unconstitutionality of the statute under which the defendant was\nindicted, Journigan v. Duffy, 552 F.2d 283, 289 (9th Cir. 1977).\n\f8                   UNITED STATES V. BROWN\n\n    Moreover, we have previously concluded in the related\ncontext of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1072 that a federal prisoner housed in\na designated state facility remains in federal custody as a\nmatter of law. See United States v. Hobson, 519 F.2d 765,\n771 (9th Cir. 1975). Section 1072 makes it unlawful to\n\u201cwillfully harbor[] or conceal[] any prisoner after his escape\nfrom the custody of the Attorney General or from a Federal\npenal or correctional institution.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1072. We\nheld in Hobson that \u201cescape from an institution designated\nby the Attorney General, pursuant to a commitment to his\ncustody, under a federal sentence, is an escape from \u2018the\ncustody of the Attorney General\u2019 in the legal sense, even\nthough the institution is run by the State.\u201d 519 F.2d at 771;\nsee also United States v. Eaglin, 571 F.2d 1069, 1073 (9th\nCir. 1977). Based on the similarity in subject matter between\n\u00a7 751(a) and \u00a7 1072, as well as the identical use of the phrase\n\u201ccustody of the Attorney General\u201d in both statutes, we\nadhere to a consistent interpretation of \u201ccustody.\u201d\n\n    Hence, the district court did not err in denying Brown\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss on the ground that Brown was in federal\ncustody as a matter of law pursuant to \u00a7 751(a). 3\n\n\n\n\n    3\n      In concluding that a federal prisoner remains in federal \u201ccustody\u201d\nfor purposes of \u00a7 751(a) even when housed at a state institution pursuant\nto writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, we join the interpretations of\nthe Fourth and Seventh Circuits. See United States v. Maday, 799 F.3d\n776, 777 (7th Cir. 2015) (transferring a federal inmate \u201cby virtue of a\nwrit of habeas corpus ad prosequendum\u201d retains enough federal interest\n\u201cto justify charging him with escaping from federal custody even though\nthe actual custodians from whom he escaped were state employees\u201d);\nUnited States v. Evans, 159 F.3d 908, 911 (4th Cir. 1998) (\u201ca writ of\nhabeas corpus ad prosequendum does not effect a transfer of custody for\npurposes of \u00a7 751(a) \u201d).\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. BROWN                      9\n\nC. Prosecutorial Vindictiveness\n\n    Brown also contends that the district court erred in\ndenying his motion to dismiss on the ground that the\nindictment was brought due to prosecutorial vindictiveness.\nTo the extent the \u201cvindictive prosecution inquiry turns upon\na district court\u2019s proper application of the law, our review is\nde novo.\u201d United States v. Kent, 649 F.3d 906, 912 (9th Cir.\n2011). To the extent a determination of vindictive\nprosecution turns upon factual findings, we review for clear\nerror. Id.\n\n    Although Brown may establish a vindictive prosecution\nclaim \u201cby producing direct evidence of the prosecutor\u2019s\npunitive motivation,\u201d such evidence is not necessary. United\nStates v. Jenkins, 504 F.3d 694, 699 (9th Cir. 2007).\nWithout direct evidence, Brown may still establish a\nprosecutorial vindictiveness claim by following a burden\nshifting framework. To do so, Brown must first create a\n\u201cpresumption of vindictiveness.\u201d        Id.    A rebuttable\npresumption of vindictiveness is created \u201cby showing that\nthe circumstances establish a \u2018reasonable likelihood of\nvindictiveness.\u2019\u201d Kent, 649 F.3d at 912\u201313 (quoting United\nStates v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 373 (1982)); see also\nUnited States v. Gallegos-Curiel, 681 F.2d 1164, 1169 (9th\nCir. 1982). If Brown does that, the burden shifts to the\ngovernment to present \u201cobjective evidence justifying the\nprosecutor\u2019s action.\u201d Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 376 n.8.\n\n    Lacking any direct evidence of punitive motive, Brown\navers that the timing of the indictment\u2014filed approximately\nfive months after the attempted escape and only after\nBrown\u2019s declaration was introduced at Henrikson\u2019s trial\u2014\nsatisfies his burden of creating a presumption of\nvindictiveness. The timing of the indictment alone,\nhowever, is insufficient. See Gallegos-Curiel, 681 F.2d at\n\f10                 UNITED STATES V. BROWN\n\n1168 (stating that \u201cthe link of vindictiveness cannot be\ninferred simply because the prosecutor\u2019s actions followed\nthe exercise of a right\u201d). 4 Particularly when a vindictiveness\nclaim pertains to pretrial charging decisions, the Supreme\nCourt urges deference to the prosecutor. See Kent, 649 F.3d\nat 913 (citing Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 381). Deference is\nappropriate for pretrial charging decisions because, \u201cin the\ncourse of preparing a case for trial, the prosecutor may\nuncover additional information that suggests a basis for\nfurther prosecution.\u201d Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 381. Brown\noffers no support for the proposition that the government had\nsufficient evidence to prosecute him for attempted escape\nprior to the submission of his written declaration in the\nHenrikson trial. Cf. Jenkins, 504 F.3d at 700. Hence, the\nmere fact that the government subsequently decided to indict\nBrown after obtaining his written declaration does not create\na presumption of vindictiveness.\n\n   Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying\nBrown\u2019s motion to dismiss on prosecutorial vindictiveness\ngrounds.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Appellant also fails to explain why the decision of Henrikson\u2019s\ndefense counsel to submit to the court Brown\u2019s previously written\ndeclaration should be treated as an \u201cexercise of a right\u201d by Brown.\n\f",
