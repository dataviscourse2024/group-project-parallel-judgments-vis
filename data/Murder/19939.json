INTRODUCTION\n\n       This advancement action involves some unusual facts but an all too common\n\nscenario: the termination of mandatory advancement to a former director and officer\n\nwhen trial is approaching and it is needed most.\n\n       Plaintiff Donald L. Blankenship is the former Chief Executive Officer and\n\nChairman of Massey Energy Company, which is now known as Alpha Appalachia\n\nHoldings, Inc. (\u201cMassey\u201d). Blankenship held those positions when there was a tragic\n\nexplosion at a Massey subsidiary\u2019s coal mine in West Virginia in April 2010, killing 29\n\nminers.   In June 2011, after Blankenship had retired from Massey, Alpha Natural\n\nResources, Inc. (\u201cAlpha\u201d) acquired Massey.         For several years after the explosion,\n\nMassey and Alpha (together, the \u201cDefendants\u201d) honored Blankenship\u2019s rights to\n\nadvancement and paid his legal expenses relating to various civil proceedings and a\n\nfederal criminal investigation that had been launched as a result of the explosion.\n\n       On November 13, 2014, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of\n\nWest Virginia obtained a four-count criminal indictment against Blankenship.\n\nBlankenship is presently scheduled to go to trial on July 13, 2015.\n\n       In the wake of the indictment, Alpha stopped paying Blankenship\u2019s legal fees.\n\nAlpha management, with approval from Alpha\u2019s board of directors, then initiated a\n\nprocess to review the company\u2019s indemnification and advancement obligations to\n\nBlankenship. Alpha focused on an unusual undertaking Blankenship had signed in April\n\n2011 (the \u201cUndertaking\u201d), which states, in relevant part, that Massey\u2019s indemnification\n\nand advancement obligations to Blankenship are \u201ccontingent upon [certain] factual\n\n\n                                             1\n\frepresentations and undertakings,\u201d including a representation that, in performing his\n\nduties as a director and officer of Massey, Blankenship \u201chad no reasonable cause to\n\nbelieve that [his] conduct was ever unlawful.\u201d In late January 2015, after a process\n\ndescribed below, Philip Cavatoni, an Alpha officer and Massey director, determined that\n\nBlankenship had breached that representation (the \u201cDetermination\u201d).      Based on the\n\nDetermination, Alpha asserts that Blankenship is no longer entitled to advancement of\n\nany of his legal expenses from Massey.\n\n      On February 5, 2015, Blankenship filed this action seeking advancement of his\n\nunpaid legal expenses under, among other sources, the terms of Massey\u2019s October 2010\n\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCharter\u201d) and an Agreement\n\nand Plan of Merger between Massey and Alpha (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d). Most of\n\nthese unpaid legal expenses were incurred in connection with the criminal proceeding to\n\nwhich Blankenship was made a party in November 2014 as a result of the indictment.\n\n      In this post-trial opinion, I conclude that the Undertaking cannot reasonably be\n\ninterpreted in the manner advocated by Defendants and that the Determination thus did\n\nnot provide a valid basis for Defendants to terminate Blankenship\u2019s advancement rights\n\nunder Massey\u2019s Charter. I also conclude that Blankenship is entitled to advancement\n\nfrom Alpha as well as Massey for the legal expenses he has incurred in connection with\n\nthe criminal proceeding under the unambiguous terms of the Merger Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fII.      BACKGROUND\n\n         These are the facts as I find them based on the documentary evidence and\n\ntestimony of record. 1\n\n         A.        The Parties\n\n         Plaintiff Donald L. Blankenship is the former Chief Executive Officer and\n\nChairman of the board of directors of Massey Energy Company.\n\n         Defendant Alpha Appalachia Holdings, Inc., formerly known as Massey Energy\n\nCompany, is a Delaware corporation engaged in the coal mining business. Massey is\n\ncurrently a wholly owned subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc.\n\n         Defendant Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation based in\n\nLinthicum Heights, Maryland, also is in the coal mining business.\n\n         B.        The Explosion at Massey\u2019s Upper Big Branch Mine\n\n         In April 2010, an explosion occurred at the Upper Big Branch (\u201cUBB\u201d) mine\n\noperated by Performance Coal Company (\u201cPerformance\u201d), a Massey subsidiary, killing\n\n29 miners. Shortly after the UBB explosion, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the\n\nSouthern District of West Virginia (the \u201cU.S. Attorney\u201d) commenced an investigation\n\ninto the underlying facts and circumstances of the explosion. 2\n\n\n\n\n1\n  By stipulation, deposition testimony is part of the trial record. Pre-Trial Stip. and Order\n(\u201cPre-Trial Stip.\u201d) \u00b6 6(4).\n2\n    Id. \u00b6 2(19).\n\n\n                                             3\n\f         C.     Blankenship Engages Zuckerman Spaeder LLP\n\n         In June 2010, William W. Taylor, III, a partner at the law firm of Zuckerman\n\nSpaeder LLP (\u201cZuckerman Spaeder\u201d), sent a letter to Blankenship (the \u201cEngagement\n\nLetter\u201d) to confirm the terms and conditions under which Zuckerman Spaeder would\n\n\u201crepresent [him] in connection with investigations resulting from the Upper Big Branch\n\nmine explosion, and related matters if requested to undertake them.\u201d 3 According to\n\nTaylor, the Engagement Letter is part of Zuckerman Spaeder\u2019s standard practice with\n\nclients, \u201cparticularly when there will be third-party defendant payment by a company or\n\nsome other third-party defendant for an individual client.\u201d 4\n\n         The Engagement Letter sets forth Massey\u2019s commitment to pay Blankenship\u2019s\n\nlegal fees on a timely basis, as follows:\n\n                Massey Energy Company agrees to pay all fees and expenses\n         incurred within thirty days of the date of any invoice. Any outstanding\n         balances that are not paid when due will accrue a service charge at the rate\n         of twelve (12) percent per annum (one percent (1%) per month) from the\n         due date until paid, in order to offset the costs of carrying any overdue\n         amount. 5\n\nThe Engagement Letter does not refer to Blankenship\u2019s indemnification rights under\n\nMassey\u2019s Charter or to the need for an undertaking to obtain advancement of his legal\n\nfees.\n\n\n\n\n3\n    JX 21 (Engagement Letter) at DBDEL0009.\n4\n    Trial Tr. (\u201cTr.\u201d) 12 (Taylor).\n5\n    JX 21 (Engagement Letter) at DBDEL0010.\n\n\n                                              4\n\f         Blankenship and Shane Harvey, then-General Counsel of Massey, both signed the\n\nEngagement Letter as \u201cSEEN and AGREED.\u201d 6               Before executing the document,\n\nBlankenship asked Harvey if it was \u201cOK\u201d to sign it. 7 Blankenship put no pressure on\n\nHarvey to decide whether the Engagement Letter was acceptable. 8\n\n         Taylor testified that the Engagement Letter reflects Massey\u2019s unconditional\n\npromise to pay Blankenship\u2019s legal fees. 9 Blankenship, by contrast, acknowledged that\n\nhe did not think that the Engagement Letter \u201cenhanced\u201d his advancement rights. 10\n\n         D.     Blankenship Retires from Massey\n\n         On December 3, 2010, Blankenship entered into a Retirement Agreement with\n\nMassey by which he would retire as CEO and Chairman effective December 31, 2010.11\n\nThe retirement was \u201cnot entirely voluntary.\u201d 12         Paragraph 12 of the Retirement\n\nAgreement, entitled \u201cIndemnity Obligations,\u201d sets forth Massey\u2019s agreement to maintain\n\nits then-existing indemnification and advancement obligations to Blankenship:\n\n         The Company [i.e., Massey] agrees to maintain and adhere to all its\n         obligations to indemnify you and advance your legal fees in accordance\n         with the terms and conditions set forth in the Company\u2019s Certificate of\n\n6\n    Id. at DBDEL0011.\n7\n    JX 20B (Email from Don L. Blankenship to Shane Harvey (June 3, 2010)).\n8\n    Tr. 67 (Blankenship).\n9\n    Id. 28, 59 (Taylor).\n10\n     Id. 77-78 (Blankenship); Blankenship Dep. 48-49.\n11\n     JX 25 (Retirement Agreement).\n12\n     Tr. 23 (Taylor).\n\n\n                                             5\n\f         Incorporation and any written indemnity agreements existing and in force\n         as of your Retirement Date, or as otherwise imposed by law, for so long as\n         those agreements or legal obligations require. 13\n\nTaylor, who represented Blankenship in connection with his retirement from Massey and\n\nnegotiated the Retirement Agreement, testified that the language in Paragraph 12 likely\n\nwas in the draft when he received it and was not controversial. He also believed the\n\nphrase \u201cwritten indemnity agreements\u201d referred to the Engagement Letter. 14 Admiral\n\nBobby R. Inman, Massey\u2019s lead independent director at the time, executed the\n\nRetirement Agreement on behalf of Massey. 15\n\n         E.     Massey Enters Into a Merger Agreement with Alpha\n\n         In approximately May 2010, after the UBB explosion, Alpha began to explore a\n\npotential acquisition of Massey. Alpha retained Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP\n\n(\u201cCleary Gottlieb\u201d) as its legal advisor in connection with that transaction.         Cleary\n\nGottlieb remained Alpha\u2019s outside counsel throughout that process and in connection\n\nwith the events that gave rise to this action.\n\n         On January 28, 2011, Massey and Alpha entered into the Merger Agreement, 16\n\nunder which Alpha would acquire Massey in a cash-and-stock transaction. Section 5.05\n\nof the Merger Agreement sets forth the respective obligations of Massey and Alpha to the\n\n\n\n13\n     JX 25 (Retirement Agreement) at \u00b6 12.\n14\n     Tr. 22-23 (Taylor).\n15\n     JX 25 (Retirement Agreement) at DBDEL0035.\n16\n     JX 26 (Merger Agreement).\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fdefined \u201cIndemnified Parties,\u201d which include Blankenship as a former director and\n\nofficer of Massey.\n\n         The merger was the subject of a preliminary injunction application in In re Massey\n\nEnergy Co. Derivative and Class Action Litigation. 17 In brief, Massey stockholders\n\nargued that the board did not obtain adequate value from Alpha for certain derivative\n\nclaims relating to the company\u2019s mine safety policies and procedures. 18 As discussed\n\nbelow, the Court considered Alpha\u2019s indemnification obligations to Blankenship under\n\nthe Merger Agreement as part of its analysis. Ultimately, for reasons not relevant to this\n\naction, then-Vice Chancellor Strine denied the preliminary injunction motion, and the\n\ncase remains pending before the Court.\n\n         On June 1, 2011, Alpha completed its acquisition of Massey, which is now a\n\nwholly owned subsidiary of Alpha.\n\n         F.    The Undertaking\n\n         On June 14, 2010, about six months before his retirement, Blankenship executed\n\nan undertaking to obtain advancement from Massey of his legal expenses incurred in\n\n\n\n\n17\n     2011 WL 2176479 (Del. Ch. May 31, 2011).\n18\n   See id. at *9 (\u201cIn broad strokes, the Derivative Claims rest on allegations that certain\ncurrent and former directors and officers of Massey breached their fiduciary duties during\nthe period from May 21, 2008 to the present by (i) \u2018chronically disregarding mining\nsafety regulations and incurring nearly $27 million in assessed violations by the [MSHA],\ncomprising a material portion of its net income in any given year; and (ii) consistently\nfailing to adequately address poor safety conditions of its mines[.]\u2019 \u201d).\n\n\n                                             7\n\fconnection with legal proceedings relating to Massey\u2019s compliance with environmental\n\nand safety regulations. 19 The June 2010 undertaking is not at issue in this action.\n\n         On March 29, 2011, after the Merger Agreement was signed but before the\n\ntransaction closed, Stephanie Ojeda, Senior Corporate Counsel of Massey, sent a new\n\nproposed undertaking (as defined above, the \u201cUndertaking\u201d) to Taylor at Zuckerman\n\nSpaeder. 20 In a cover letter, Ojeda explained that Massey remained committed to its\n\nindemnification obligations to Blankenship (and other employees of Massey) and that the\n\nenclosed Undertaking \u201cclarifies\u201d the relationship between Massey and Blankenship:\n\n                 In light of the impending merger, I write to address the legal\n         representation you are providing to employees of Massey and its affiliated\n         entities in relation to ongoing government investigations of the April 5,\n19\n     The June 2010 undertaking states, in relevant part:\n\n                By signing this letter, I agree to the following terms:\n\n                1.      The advancement of legal expenses will be made under\n         Article NINETEENTH of the Company\u2019s [i.e., Massey\u2019s] Certificate of\n         Incorporation, which provides indemnification to its directors and officers\n         to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law,\n         and the Company may cease advancing legal expenses on my behalf at any\n         time if the Company determines that I am not otherwise entitled to the\n         advancement of legal expenses under such Article[.]\n\n                2.       I will repay to the Company all legal expenses paid on my\n         behalf if it is ultimately determined that I am not entitled to be indemnified\n         by the Company for such expenses under the Certificate of Incorporation of\n         the Company, the Delaware General Corporation Law, or any other law\n         regulation.\n\nJX 22 (Undertaking from Donald Blankenship to Massey Energy Company (June 14,\n2010)).\n20\n  JX 27 (Letter from Stephanie Ojeda to Bill Taylor (Mar. 29, 2011)). Ojeda testified\nshe thought someone else drafted the cover letter, but she was not sure. Ojeda Dep. 39.\n\n\n                                                8\n\f         2010 accident at Upper Big Branch. The Company remains committed to\n         providing appropriate assistance with the legal defense of its individual\n         employees in connection with those investigations and, accordingly, will\n         continue to do so after the merger with Alpha is finalized.\n\n                 In the meantime, I ask that each represented individual sign the\n         attached undertaking, which clarifies the relationship between Massey and\n         your client(s) with respect to their legal representation in this matter and\n         payment therefor. Please review the attached undertaking with your\n         client(s) and return the signed form(s) to my attention.\n\n                 I appreciate your service on behalf of Massey\u2019s valued members.\n         Please contact me at [redacted] if you have any questions regarding this\n         letter or the attached undertaking. 21\n\nOther than this cover letter, there are no written communications in the record concerning\n\nthe meaning of the Undertaking.\n\n         The provision at the end of the first paragraph of the Undertaking states that\n\nMassey\u2019s indemnification and advancement obligations are \u201ccontingent upon\u201d three\n\nenumerated \u201cfactual representations and undertakings.\u201d I refer to that provision as the\n\n\u201cContingency Provision.\u201d The legal effect of the factual representation in the second\n\nenumerated paragraph is a critical issue in this case. I refer to that representation as the\n\n\u201cReasonable Cause Representation.\u201d         The last paragraph of the Undertaking states\n\nexplicitly that Massey shall not be obligated to advance further expenses to Blankenship\n\nin two specified circumstances. I refer to that provision as the \u201cTermination Provision.\u201d\n\nThe entire text of the Undertaking is quoted below:\n\n               I, Donald L. Blankenship, have retained counsel to represent me in\n         connection with a federal criminal grand jury investigation conducted by\n         the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of West\n\n21\n     JX 27 at 1 (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                              9\n\f         Virginia and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Federal\n         Mine Safety and Health Administration, as well as in connection with any\n         concurrent or other proceedings relating to Performance Coal Company\n         (\u201cPerformance\u201d), Massey Energy Company (\u201cMassey\u201d), Massey Coal\n         Services, Inc. (\u201cMCS\u201d), and any affiliates or certain officers, employees or\n         other persons associated with these entities. It is my understanding that\n         Massey will indemnify me and/or advance on my behalf the fees and costs\n         associated with this representation, contingent upon the following factual\n         representations and undertakings, which I hereby make and declare to be\n         true [as defined above, the \u201cContingency Provision\u201d]:\n\n                1.      In the performance of my actions as an officer, director,\n         employee, or consultant of Massey and/or any of its affiliates and\n         subsidiaries, including but not limited to MCS, I acted in good faith and in\n         a manner that I reasonably believed to be consistent with the best interests\n         of Massey and its affiliates and subsidiaries;\n\n                2.      In the performance of my actions as an officer, director,\n         employee, and consultant of Massey and/or any of its affiliates and\n         subsidiaries, including but not limited to MCS, I had no reasonable cause\n         to believe that my conduct was ever unlawful [as defined above, the\n         \u201cReasonable Cause Representation\u201d]; and\n\n                3.    If it shall ultimately be determined that I am not entitled to\n         the indemnification described above and in any applicable Agreement for\n         Indemnification, consistent with governing laws, I hereby agree to repay\n         Massey any sums that Massey has expended on my behalf for\n         indemnification or advancement.\n\n                 I further understand that, in any event, Massey, Performance, and/or\n         MCS shall not be obligated to indemnify me or advance further fees and\n         costs on my behalf if: (i) I should enter a plea of guilty, or be found guilty\n         by a court or jury, on any criminal charge related to my actions as an\n         officer, director, employee, and consultant of Massey and/or any of its\n         affiliates and subsidiaries, including but not limited to MCS, or otherwise\n         relating to the subject matter of the above-described criminal investigation;\n         or (ii) Massey, Performance, and/or MCS otherwise determines that I am\n         not entitled to indemnification under governing laws [as defined above, the\n         \u201cTermination Provision\u201d]. 22\n\n\n\n22\n     JX 28 (Undertaking) at ANR_AAR-00000442-43 (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                              10\n\fThe Undertaking refers to two entities (Performance and MCS) in addition to Massey that\n\nwere not mentioned in the June 2010 undertaking. Before his retirement, Blankenship\n\nheld various positions at Performance and MCS, both of which are West Virginia\n\ncorporations. 23\n\n          Massey drafted the Undertaking. 24 Taylor, on behalf of Blankenship, did not have\n\nany discussions with Ojeda or anyone else at Massey about the Undertaking, nor did he\n\nsuggest any changes to the document. 25 Ojeda, who did not appear at trial, testified in\n\ndeposition that she understood the Undertaking to be \u201cjust confirmation of a duty or\n\nobligation with respect to indemnifying and advancing fees. The obligation had already\n\nbeen established[.]\u201d 26 When asked what she meant by \u201cthe obligation had already been\n\nestablished,\u201d Ojeda explained, \u201cThat the company [i.e., Massey] had already agreed to\n\nindemnify and advance fees, and it [i.e., the Undertaking] was just a restatement of that,\n\nafter the announcement of the merger agreement.\u201d 27\n\n\n\n\n23\n    See, e.g., Defs.\u2019 Ans.

In 2012, likely at the\n\nrequest of someone at Massey, Zuckerman Spaeder began submitting invoices to Alpha. 36\n\nWhen this change happened is not clear.

To wit,\n\nseven of the twelve pages of the Verhiej Memo are entirely redacted except for a handful\n\nof headings, such as \u201cArguments with Respect to Advancement Obligation\u201d and\n\n\u201cAdvantages and Disadvantages for Refusing to Make Further Advances.\u201d 61 Only the\n\nfactual background section is not redacted.\n\n         The Verheij Memo contains an \u201cillustrative\u201d list of excerpted written and recorded\n\nstatements by Blankenship 62 that, in Verheij\u2019s view, \u201cappeared to be inconsistent with\n\nMr. Blankenship\u2019s representation that he had no reasonable cause to believe that his\n\nconduct was ever unlawful.\u201d 63 Verheij selected these excerpts, which are dated from\n\n2008 to 2010, based on materials Cleary Gottlieb provided to him when he joined\n\nAlpha. 64 The fact that Blankenship made these statements was important to Verheij\n\nbecause he thought a \u201creasonable person could characterize them as admissions.\u201d 65\n\n\n60\n     JX 41 (Verheij Memo).\n61\n     Id. at ANR_AAR-00001528-29, 33-37.\n62\n     Id. at ANR_AAR-00001530-31.\n63\n  Tr. 294 (Verheij).

The\n\nMLAC was made aware that Alpha had not paid any of Blankenship\u2019s legal fees since the\n\nIndictment. After a discussion, the MLAC members\n\n         indicated their support of management\u2019s determination that Mr.\n         Blankenship is not entitled to indemnification under governing laws and\n         management\u2019s proposal not to advance any further legal fees and expenses\n         on Mr. Blankenship\u2019s behalf and . . . recommended that the matter also be\n         discussed with the Board. 73\n\nAt this point, Massey management had made no final determination to stop advancing\n\nBlankenship\u2019s legal fees. 74\n\n\n\n\n70\n     Id. at ANR_AAR-00001546-49.\n71\n     Id. at ANR_AAR-00001546.\n72\n  JX 43 (Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., Telephonic Meeting of the Massey Litigation\nAdvisory Committee of the Board of Directors (Dec. 22, 2014)) at ANR_AAR-\n00001520-21.\n73\n     Id. at ANR_ARR-00001521.\n74\n     Pre-Trial Stip. \u00b6 2(37).\n\n\n                                            20\n\f         J.

Based on the minutes that were produced, the Alpha board, like the\n\nMLAC, was supportive of management\u2019s approach in evaluating the Undertaking. 75\n\nSeveral members of Alpha senior management were on the line for this meeting,\n\nincluding Verheij and Philip Cavatoni, an Executive Vice President of Alpha and its\n\nChief Strategy Officer and Treasurer.\n\n         After this meeting, Crutchfield and Verheij agreed to designate Cavatoni to make\n\na \u201cdetermination\u201d as to whether Massey should cease advancing Blankenship\u2019s legal\n\nexpenses. Cavatoni was chosen in part because he held officer positions at each of the\n\nthree companies (Massey, Performance and MCS) to which the Undertaking applied. 76\n\nAccording to Defendants, he also was chosen because he had a working knowledge of\n\nmine safety regulations by participating in various Alpha committee meetings on\n\nsustainability and he was generally familiar with the facts and circumstances surrounding\n\nthe UBB mine explosion and the \u201cunique\u201d amount of litigation it caused through his\n\n\n\n\n75\n   JX 44 (Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., Telephonic Meeting of the Board of Directors\n(Jan. 12, 2015)) at ANR_AAR-00001523; Tr. 235 (Cavatoni).\n76\n     Pre-Trial Stip. \u00b6 2(39).\n\n\n                                            21\n\finvolvement in managing Alpha\u2019s pre-merger diligence and post-merger integration of\n\nMassey. 77\n\n         Verheij informed Cavatoni of his new responsibility. 78 There is no evidence that\n\nanyone explicitly told Cavatoni to determine to stop advancing Blankenship\u2019s legal fees.\n\nCavatoni testified that he was open to the possibility of concluding that Blankenship\n\nshould continue receiving advancement. 79\n\n         Cavatoni considered the merits of this task largely over a weekend. 80 The only\n\ndocument he had in hand to review was the Cleary Memo and the attached Appendix A. 81\n\nHe reviewed the Cleary Memo and Appendix A in a \u201cholistic manner\u201d without relying on\n\n\u201cany one particular\u201d excerpt. 82 He specifically considered the legal advice provided in\n\n\n\n77\n   Tr. 201-04, 213-15 (Cavatoni); Verheij Dep. 42-46.

The answer to this question depends on the meaning of the\n\nContingency Provision in the Undertaking, which states in relevant part:\n\n                It is my understanding that Massey will indemnify me and/or\n          advance on my behalf the fees and costs associated with this representation,\n          contingent upon the following factual representations and undertakings,\n          which I hereby make and declare to be true [as defined above, the\n          \u201cContingency Provision\u201d]:\n\n                 ...\n\n                2.

Thus, he maintains that the\n\nContingency Provision does not permit Massey to \u201cstop advancing before the ultimate\n\ndisposition of the underlying Criminal Proceeding if Massey later came to believe that\n\nthe statements in numbered paragraphs 1 and 2 were not true.\u201d 117          For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, I agree with Blankenship\u2019s interpretation of the Contingency Provision.\n\n\n\n\n114\n   Tr. of Oral Arg. 67-69.

The Contingency Provision Does Not Permit Massey to Terminate\n                Blankenship\u2019s Advancement Rights\n\n         Because Blankenship\u2019s advancement rights under Massey\u2019s Charter are, by their\n\nterms, contract rights, I interpret the provisions of the Undertaking according to contract\n\ninterpretation principles. Delaware law \u201cadheres to the objective theory of contracts,\u201d 118\n\nwhich requires a court to interpret a particular contractual term to mean \u201cwhat a\n\nreasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant.\u201d 119\n\nDelaware courts interpret a contractual term that is reasonably or fairly susceptible to\n\nonly one interpretation according to the term\u2019s plain meaning. 120 That the parties dispute\n\nhow to interpret a term does not mean that their interpretations are reasonable or that the\n\nterm is ambiguous. Rather, only \u201cwhen the provisions in controversy are reasonably or\n\nfairly susceptible of different interpretations or may have two or more different\n\nmeanings\u201d are the provisions deemed ambiguous. 121 If a contractual term is ambiguous,\n\na Delaware court must consider extrinsic evidence \u201cto determine the meaning the parties\n\nintended.\u201d 122 Applying these principles here, I find that a reasonable person in the\n\nposition of the parties would not have thought that Blankenship\u2019s advancement rights\n\n\n\n118\n      Salamone v.

Those\n\ntwo provisions are structured differently and, in my opinion, were intended to serve\n\ndifferent purposes. The Termination Provision explicitly lists certain situations in which\n\nMassey \u201cshall not be obligated to . . . advance further fees\u201d to Blankenship, namely, if (1)\n\nBlankenship enters a guilty plea or is found guilty by a court or jury related to his actions\n\nas a director or officer of Massey, or (2) Massey \u201cotherwise determines\u201d that Blankenship\n\nis not entitled to indemnification. Conspicuously absent from this list is any reference to\n\nthe truthfulness of the two enumerated factual representations in the Undertaking.\n\nApplying the interpretive principle that \u201cthe expression of one thing is the exclusion of\n\nanother,\u201d 124 the plain terms and clear limitations of the Termination Provision\n\ndemonstrate that the drafter of the Undertaking did not intend for the Contingency\n\nProvision to be a legal basis on which Massey could be relieved of advancing\n\n\n123\n    See GMG Capital Invs., LLC v.

Only Blankenship\u2019s interpretation yields a different meaning\n\nfor these different provisions.\n\n         Second, applying the definition of \u201ccontingent\u201d from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 125\n\nwhich defines \u201ccontingent\u201d to mean \u201c[d]ependent on something else; conditional,\u201d 126 the\n\nContingency Provision logically was intended to relate to the commencement of\n\nMassey\u2019s advancement obligations concerning the federal criminal investigation that\n\nbegan after the UBB explosion 127\u2014a topic that was not referenced in the earlier June\n\n2010 undertaking 128\u2014and was not intended to provide a basis on which Massey could\n\nterminate those obligations. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the phrase\n\n\u201ccontingent upon\u201d in the first paragraph of the Undertaking not only applied to the two\n\nenumerated factual representations of the Undertaking, but also applied to Blankenship\u2019s\n\nagreement to repay any advanced expenses in numbered paragraph 3 if it should\n\n125\n   See Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Am.

The Undertaking expressly references that Blankenship had\nretained counsel to represent him in connection with \u201ca federal grand jury investigation\nconducted by the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of West\nVirginia and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Federal Mine Safety and\nHealth Administration.\u201d JX 28 (Undertaking) at ANR_AAR-00000442.\n128\n    In the June 2010 undertaking, Blankenship requested advancement for expenses\nincurred \u201cin connection with litigation regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with\nenvironmental and safety regulations, including but not limited to derivative actions\nalleging breaches of fiduciary duties on the part of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and\ncertain executives, federal securities, litigation and various shareholder demands.\u201d JX\n22.\n\n\n                                             35\n\fultimately be determined that he is not entitled to indemnification.        Blankenship\u2019s\n\nundertaking of such a repayment obligation plainly did not provide a basis on which\n\nMassey could later terminate its advancement obligations; it simply provided an\n\nassurance that Blankenship would repay if it ultimately should be determined that he is\n\nnot entitled to indemnification.      It would be nonsensical to construe the phrase\n\n\u201ccontingent upon\u201d differently with respect to the two factual representations in numbered\n\nparagraphs 1 and 2 to which it applies than with respect to the agreement to repay in\n\nnumbered paragraph 3 to which it also applies. 129 Thus, the use of the phrase \u201ccontingent\n\nupon\u201d logically could not have been intended to provide Massey a license to terminate its\n\nadvancement obligations in the future. Instead, \u201ccontingent upon\u201d can only reasonably\n\nbe interpreted to require that Blankenship provide certain assurances as a condition to\n\nMassey agreeing to commence advancement for the federal criminal investigation.\n\n         The foregoing interpretation of the Contingency Provision is consistent with then-\n\nVice Chancellor Strine\u2019s comments about the import of functionally equivalent language\n\nin the undertaking at issue in Thompson v.

Similar to the Undertaking here, Power\u2019s proposed undertaking included\n\nrepresentations that Thompson \u201cacted at all times as an employee . . . of [Power] in good\n\nfaith and for a purpose that [he] reasonably believed to be in the best interests of [Power]\n\nand/or any related entities,\u201d and that he \u201cha[s] no reasonable cause to believe [his]\n\nconduct was unlawful at any time.\u201d 131 Power\u2019s advancement bylaw provided, in part,\n\nthat \u201c[e]xpenses incurred by other employees and agents shall be paid upon such terms\n\nand conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.\u201d 132\n\n          In determining that Power had the legal authority under the company\u2019s bylaws to\n\ncondition advancement to Thompson (a former employee) upon \u201cappropriate\u201d terms and\n\nconditions, then-Vice Chancellor Strine interpreted \u201cappropriate\u201d in that context to mean\n\n\u201crationally related to a proper corporate interest.\u201d 133 He then observed that the good faith\n\nand reasonable cause representations in the proposed undertaking qualified as\n\n\u201cappropriate\u201d terms and conditions because he read each to be a \u201creassuring prerequisite\u201d\n\nnecessary for advancement to commence rather than as a \u201clicense\u201d for the company to\n\ncease continued advancement:\n\n          Power\u2019s demand that Thompson certify that he acted in a manner that was\n          consistent with his ultimate entitlement to indemnification was also\n          appropriate. By that means, Power simply demanded that Thompson\n          evidence his personal belief that he had acted in a manner entitling him to\n\n131\n      Id. at *2.\n132\n      Id. at *1.\n133\n      Id. at *6.\n\n\n                                              37\n\f      indemnification under the plain terms of the Indemnification Bylaw. The\n      Power board knew that the federal authorities had procured an indictment\n      charging Thompson with having engaged in conduct that cannot be\n      indemnified; it simply wanted Thompson to certify that he believes himself\n      to have acted lawfully and faithfully. That may seem useless to those of a\n      cynical bent, but I do not believe it inappropriate for the Power board to\n      desire an attestation of good faith from a former employee facing serious\n      criminal charges before extending him hundreds of thousands of dollars in\n      interest-free credit.\n\n      ...\n\n      I do not read the condition that Thompson certify that he believes his past\n      behavior as an employee of Power entitles him to ultimate indemnification\n      as giving Power a license to deny him further advancement if it concludes\n      he lied before his criminal prosecution is concluded. Rather, I read it as\n      manifesting the board\u2019s demand for an affirmative representation by\n      Thompson of his own belief in the good faith and legality of his actions\n      while an employee as a reassuring prerequisite to advancing him company\n      funds. 134\n\nSimilarly here, the Contingency Provision, construed logically, makes sense as a form of\n\nreassurance to Massey, but not as a license for Massey to deny Blankenship further\n\nadvancement if he \u201cever\u201d had reasonable cause to believe that any action he took arising\n\nfrom his actions as an officer, director or employee of Massey was unlawful. 135\n\n\n134\n    Id. at *7-8. Massey seeks to distinguish Thompson because the undertaking there\nmerely asked Thompson to \u201cconfirm[] and agree[]\u201d to the factual representations and did\nnot make advancement \u201ccontingent upon\u201d those representations. Defs.\u2019 Ans. Br. 11;\nDefs.\u2019 Ans. Br. Ex. A. In my view, the \u201cconfirm and agree\u201d language on which Massey\nrelies to distinguish the undertaking at issue in Thompson is not a readily identifiable\nbasis for the Court\u2019s discussion about the limited nature of the representations in that\ncase. In any event, the phrase \u201ccontingent upon\u201d does not have the meaning Massey\nascribes to it for the reasons stated above.\n135\n    The Undertaking applies jointly to Massey, a Delaware corporation, and to\nPerformance and MCS, both of which are West Virginia corporations. The statutory\nrequirements for advancement under West Virginia law offer a logical and plausible\nexplanation for why the factual representations appear in the Undertaking, and that\n\n                                            38\n\f       Third, Massey\u2019s interpretation of the Contingency Provision would afford it such\n\nbroad discretion to cease advancement of Blankenship\u2019s legal expenses so as to lead to\n\nabsurd results that, in my view, \u201cno reasonable person would have accepted\u201d when\n\nexecuting the Undertaking. 136 An example discussed by counsel at post-trial argument\n\ndemonstrates the point. Say that Massey found an audiotape in which Blankenship is\n\nrecorded as saying that, while driving a truck to inspect one of Massey\u2019s coal mines, he\n\nexceeded the legal speed limit. Counsel for Massey conceded at argument that, based on\n\nsuch an audiotape, and subject to a good faith and reasonableness standard, the company\n\nwould be permitted under its interpretation of the Undertaking to cease advancement for\n\nBlankenship\u2019s fees in the Criminal Proceeding, even if (1) the speeding is wholly\n\nunrelated to any of the claims for which Blankenship seeks advancement; (2) a police\n\n\n\nexplanation is consistent with construing them as reassurances and not as a basis for\nterminating advancement. Under Section 853(a)(1) of the West Virginia Business\nCorporation Act, a corporation may advance legal expenses to a director upon delivery of\n\u201ca written affirmation of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the relevant\nstandard of conduct described in section eight hundred fifty-one of this article.\u201d W. Va.\nCode \u00a7 31D-8-853(a)(1). Section 851(a) provides, in relevant part, that \u201ca corporation\nmay indemnify an individual who is a party to a proceeding because he or she is a\ndirector against liability incurred in the proceeding if: (1) . . . (B) He or she reasonably\nbelieved: (i) In the case of conduct in his or her official capacity, that his or her conduct\nwas in the best interests of the corporation; . . . and (C) In the case of any criminal\nproceeding, he or she had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was\nunlawful.\u201d W. Va. Code \u00a7 31D-8-851(a). A West Virginia corporation may indemnify\nand advance legal expenses to an officer \u201c[t]o the same extent as a director.\u201d W. Va.\nCode \u00a7 31D-8-856(a)(1). I have not considered the terms of any advancement provisions\nin the charters of Performance or MCS.\n136\n   See Osborn, 991 A.2d at 1160 (\u201cAn unreasonable interpretation produces an absurd\nresult or one that no reasonable person would have accepted when entering the\ncontract.\u201d).\n\n\n                                             39\n\fofficer who was nearby did not pull Blankenship over for speeding; or (3) Blankenship\n\nactually was not speeding, even though he thought he was. 137 This example, which flows\n\nfrom the logic of Massey\u2019s proffered interpretation, demonstrates the unreasonableness of\n\nits construction of the Undertaking.\n\n         For the reasons discussed above, I conclude that Blankenship has provided the\n\nonly reasonable interpretation of the Contingency Provision. Even if the Contingency\n\nProvision arguably was ambiguous, however, the weight of the evidence surrounding the\n\ndrafting and execution of the Undertaking, although limited, also supports Blankenship\u2019s\n\ninterpretation as does the public policy of Delaware, which supports resolving ambiguity\n\nin favor of indemnification and advancement.\n\n         Under Delaware law, extrinsic evidence that is probative of the meaning of an\n\nambiguous contractual term includes \u201cthe overt statements and acts of the parties, the\n\nbusiness context, prior dealings between the parties, and the business customs and usage\n\nin the industry.\u201d 138 As noted above, the parties never discussed the meaning of the\n\nUndertaking when it was first proposed or later executed. Thus, Blankenship\u2019s and\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony about their subjective understandings of the Undertaking is not\n\n\n\n\n137\n      Tr. of Oral Arg. 41-43, 46-47.\n138\n  Bell Atl.

Stated more directly, saying\n\nthat Massey\u2019s interpretation of the Contingency Provision \u201cclarifies\u201d Massey\u2019s\n\nadvancement obligations to Blankenship would be a gross mischaracterization given that\n\n\n\n\n139\n    See United Rentals, Inc. v.

Specifically, Blankenship contends that the Engagement Letter \u201cestablished an\n\nunambiguous contractual obligation separate and apart from any obligations assumed\n\nthrough the [Charter] or the Merger Agreement.\u201d 152 I disagree.\n\n         The key sentence of the Engagement Letter upon which Blankenship relies is the\n\nstatement that \u201cMassey Energy Company agrees to pay all fees and expenses incurred\n\nwithin thirty days of the date of any invoice.\u201d 153 In my opinion, the only reasonable\n\ninterpretation of this language, 154 included in a document whose express purpose was to\n\n\u201cset forth in writing the basis of [Zuckerman Spaeder\u2019s] fees at the beginning of a\n\nrepresentation\u201d in accordance with the District of Columbia Rules of Professional\n\nConduct, 155 is the one Massey proffers, i.e., that the Engagement Letter sets forth nothing\n\nmore than the agreed-upon invoice terms and payment schedule under which Zuckerman\n\nSpaeder would bill Massey and Massey would pay Zuckerman Spaeder. 156\n\n         Taken to its logical extreme, interpreting the Engagement Letter to be an\n\nunconditional commitment for Massey to pay Blankenship\u2019s legal fees without regard to\n\nthe reasonableness of the fees or any nexus between the legal services performed and\n\nBlankenship\u2019s conduct as a current or former director or officer of Massey would\n\n152\n      Pl.\u2019s Op.

Blankenship has Advancement Rights against Alpha for the\n                Criminal Proceeding under Section 5.05(b) of the Merger Agreement\n\n         In Count III of the Complaint, Blankenship seeks advancement from Alpha of his\n\nlegal expenses incurred in the Criminal Proceeding under Section 5.05(b) of the Merger\n\nAgreement. That section sets forth the advancement and indemnification obligations that\n\nAlpha (defined as \u201cParent\u201d) owes to the defined \u201cIndemnified Parties,\u201d which include\n\nBlankenship as a former director and officer of Massey:\n\n                Without limiting Section 5.05(a) or any rights of any Indemnified\n         Party pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the\n         Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit,\n         proceeding or investigation (a \u201cClaim\u201d), whether civil, criminal or\n         administrative in which any person who is now, or has been at any time\n\n157\n      See Osborn, 991 A.2d at 1160.\n158\n   See, e.g., Sun-Times Media Gp., Inc. v.

Although I find the Engagement Letter to be unambiguous, my interpretation\nof that document is further supported by Blankenship\u2019s deposition testimony, where he\nconceded that he did not think he obtained broader indemnification or advancement rights\nby signing the Engagement Letter than those he already had.

Section 5.05(e) of the Merger Agreement states that the \u201cprovisions of\n\nSection 5.05 are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each\n\nIndemnified Party.\u201d 161 Thus, Blankenship has standing to enforce the provision.\n\n         The parties\u2019 arguments regarding Section 5.05(b) implicate two textual issues\n\nconcerning the temporal scope of the provision. The first issue is premised on the\n\n159\n      JX 26 (Merger Agreement) at \u00a7 5.05(b) (emphasis added).\n160\n      Id. at \u00a7 8.08.\n161\n      Id. at \u00a7 5.05(e).\n\n\n                                                47\n\finteraction of Section 5.05(b) with Section 5.05(a).       That earlier section generally\n\nprovides that Blankenship\u2019s indemnification and advancement rights from Massey (not\n\nAlpha) for \u201cacts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time\u201d of the merger\u2014\n\nwhich was June 1, 2011\u2014shall survive the merger:\n\n                 All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for\n         acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to\n         advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any\n         person who is . . . , or has been at any time prior to the date of this\n         Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent . . . of the Company, any\n         of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each, an\n         \u201cIndemnified Party\u201d) as provided in the Company Certificate of\n         Incorporation, the Company Bylaws, the organizational documents of any\n         Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification agreement between such\n         Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries . . . shall\n         survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise\n         modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of\n         any such Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnified\n         Party. 162\n\nThus, under Section 5.05(a), Massey\u2019s advancement obligations to Blankenship for the\n\nU.S. Attorney\u2019s investigation and the resulting Criminal Proceeding survived the merger.\n\nRelying on language appearing at the beginning of Sections 5.05(a) and (b), respectively,\n\nAlpha argues that Section 5.05(a) was intended to cover claims based on conduct (i.e.,\n\n\u201cacts or omissions\u201d) occurring \u201cprior to the Effective Time\u201d while Section 5.05(b) was\n\nintended to cover claims based on conduct occurring \u201cfrom and after the Effective\n\nTime.\u201d 163     In effect, Alpha contends that Sections 5.05(a) and (b) are mutually\n\n\n\n\n162\n      Id. at \u00a7 5.05(a) (emphasis added).\n163\n      Defs.\u2019 Ans.

Alpha has not identified any text in the\n\nMerger Agreement stating that the Section 5.05(a) and (b) were intended to be mutually\n\nexclusive based on the timing of underlying conduct. To the contrary, Section 5.05(b)\n\ncontains explicit language demonstrating that it was intended to cover claims relating to\n\nconduct occurring before the Effective Time. Specifically, Section 5.05(b) encompasses\n\nclaims \u201carising out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that such an Indemnified Party was a\n\ndirector \u2026 or officer of [Massey] . . . prior to the Effective Time.\u201d That does not mean\n\nthat Section 5.05(b) necessarily covers all claims relating to the conduct of a Massey\n\ndirector or officer occurring before the Effective Time, just that such a claim may be\n\nencompassed by Section 5.05(b) if the other conditions of that section are met.\n\n          The second temporal issue implicated by Section 5.05(b) focuses on when a claim\n\nis asserted as opposed to when the underlying conduct occurred. Alpha acknowledges\n\nthat Section 5.05(b) of the Merger Agreement \u201cobligates [it] to advance fees to the\n\nformer Massey directors and officers for new claims, meaning claims that are threatened\n\nor instituted after the Effective Time of the merger, on June 1, 2011.\u201d 164 But, Alpha\n\nargues that the fact that Blankenship \u201cwas indicted in November 2014 did not somehow\n\ncreate a \u2018new\u2019 claim that would fall under the scope of Section 5.05(b).\u201d 165\n\n\n164\n      Id. 29.\n165\n      Id. 30.\n\n\n                                             49\n\f         In my opinion, although Alpha glosses over the actual language of Section\n\n5.05(b), it is half right. As I construe Section 5.05(b), it generally covers actions or\n\nproceedings in which an Indemnified Party is made or threatened to be made a party\n\n\u201cfrom and after the Effective Time.\u201d 166 This conclusion follows from the text of Section\n\n5.05(b) emphasized below:\n\n         . . . from and after the Effective Time, in event of any threatened or\n         actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a \u201cClaim\u201d), whether\n         civil, criminal or administrative in which any person \u2026 is or is threatened\n         to be, made a party in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the\n         Company, each of Parent [Alpha] and the Surviving Corporation [Massey]\n         shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent the Company would\n         have been permitted to do so under applicable Law . . . , each such\n         Indemnified Party in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the\n         Company . . . against any losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses\n         (including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in advance of the final\n         disposition of any Claim to each Indemnified Party . . . ) . . . . 167\n\nI disagree with Alpha\u2019s assertion, however, that the Indictment did not trigger coverage\n\nfor the Criminal Proceeding under Section 5.05(b). Blankenship was made a party to the\n\nCriminal Proceeding by virtue of the Indictment, which was issued on November 13,\n\n2014. Thus, he became a party to a criminal proceeding after the Effective Time and is\n\nthereby entitled to advancement from Alpha under the plain language of Section 5.05(b)\n\nas long as the conduct for which he was charged falls within the scope of the type of\n\nconduct covered by Section 5.05(b). For the reasons discussed above, the conduct for\n\n166\n   Section 5.05(b)(ii) contains an exception. That subpart covers claims arising out of or\npertaining to the Merger Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby\n\u201cwhether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time.\u201d JX 26\n(Merger Agreement) at \u00a7 5.05(b)(ii).\n167\n      Id. at \u00a7 5.05(b) (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                             50\n\fwhich he now has been charged criminally falls within the scope of Section 5.05(b)\n\nbecause it indisputably arises out of and pertains to the fact that he was a director and\n\nofficer of Massey before the Effective Time. 168\n\n          Alpha has offered no textual support for the notion that the Criminal Proceeding to\n\nwhich he was made a party by virtue of the Indictment should relate back to the U.S.\n\nAttorney\u2019s criminal investigation for which Massey was providing advancement to\n\nBlankenship before the Effective Time so as to remove the Criminal Proceeding from the\n\nambit of Section 5.05(b). 169 Had the drafters of the Merger Agreement intended to\n\nincorporate a relation-back limitation on Alpha\u2019s advancement and indemnification\n\nobligations, they presumably could have done so. But they did not. Instead, they drafted\n\nSection 5.05(b) so that it would cover certain proceedings in which an Indemnified\n\nPerson is made a party to a proceeding after the Effective Time arising out of or relating\n\nto his or her conduct as a Massey director or officer before the Effective Time. The\n\nCriminal Proceeding is such a proceeding.\n\n          To summarize, taking into account the two temporal issues concerning the\n\nconstruction of Section 5.05(b) discussed above, Blankenship is entitled to advancement\n\nfrom Alpha for the Criminal Proceeding under that section because (1) the Indictment\n\nwas handed down on November 13, 2014, meaning that Blankenship was made a party to\n\n168\n      Pre-Trial Stip. \u00b6 2(2).\n169\n   The merger closed in June 2011. As reflected by the Undertaking, which Blankenship\nsigned on April 12, 2011, Massey agreed to advance Blankenship \u201cin connection with a\nfederal criminal grand jury investigation\u201d before the Effective Time.         JX 28\n(Undertaking) at ANR_AAR-00000442.\n\n\n                                              51\n\fthe Criminal Proceeding after the Effective Time; and (2) Section 5.05(b)(i) plainly\n\ncovers the claims asserted in the Criminal Proceeding, which pertain to or arise out of the\n\nfact that Blankenship was a director or officer of Massey before the Effective Time.\n\n         Alpha next contends that, under the equitable doctrine of judicial estoppel,\n\nBlankenship should be precluded from contradicting the interpretation of Section 5.05 he\n\nallegedly supported in Massey Energy Co. 170 The equitable doctrine of judicial estoppel\n\nis \u201cdesigned to protect the integrity of the judicial process by \u2018prohibiting parties from\n\ndeliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment.\u2019 \u201d 171 In\n\nMotorola Inc. v. Amkor Technology, Inc., 172 the Delaware Supreme Court explained that\n\n\u201cjudicial estoppel operates only where the litigant contradicts another position that the\n\nlitigant previously took and that the Court was successfully induced to adopt in a judicial\n\nruling.\u201d 173 That doctrine has no application here, in my opinion, because neither of the\n\nelements required under Motorola are present.\n\n         Regarding the first element, Massey relies on two representations that were made\n\nin defending against the issuance of a preliminary injunction in Massey Energy Co. The\n\nfirst is a segment of a brief submitted in opposition to the stockholders plaintiffs\u2019\n\npreliminary injunction motion, which Blankenship joined. It states that:\n\n\n170\n      Defs.\u2019 Ans. Br. 29 n.23.\n171\n      In re Silver Leaf, L.L.C., 2004 WL 1517127, at *2 (Del. Ch.

With respect to new claims, they are\n      indemnified by Massey and Alpha to the same extent they were\n      indemnified by Massey pre-merger. (Id. \u00a75.05(b)). In other words, the\n      Merger Agreement provides Defendants with no greater indemnity than\n      they would have received if [Massey] continued as an independent\n      entity. 174\n\nThis quotation essentially rehashes the argument Alpha has asserted in this case. It does\n\nnot, however, contradict the interpretation of Section 5.05 Blankenship has advanced, and\n\nwhich I have adopted, here\u2014namely, that Blankenship is entitled to advancement from\n\nAlpha for the Criminal Proceeding under Section 5.05(b) because he was made a party to\n\nthat proceeding after the Effective Time for actions he took as a director and officer of\n\nMassey before the Effective Time.\n\n      The second representation comes from the following colloquy at oral argument on\n\nthe preliminary injunction motion between the Court and Alpha\u2019s counsel:\n\n                   The Court: Can \u2013 can you go over your understanding of the\n      indemnity that your clients have granted?\n\n                     [Alpha\u2019s Counsel]: Yes. And I don\u2019t think that this \u2013 well \u2013\n      yes. There are two provisions in the merger agreement that deal with\n      indemnity. One is 5.05(a), and the second is 5.05(b). 5.05(a) is the\n      provision that addresses causes of action existing prior to the signing of the\n      merger agreement. There is no dispute that these derivative claims were\n      existing prior to the merger agreement. And 5.05(a) says that the indemnity\n      for those claims and any others presigning of the merger agreement will\n      remain postmerger Massey\u2019s obligation. Obviously Massey will be a\n      subsidiary of Alpha, but it will be Massey\u2019s indemnification. That\u2019s my\n\n\n174\n  JX 31 (Certain Massey Defs.\u2019 Ans. Br. in Opp\u2019n to Pls.\u2019 Mot. for a Prelim. Inj.) at\nANR_AAR-00000793-94.\n\n\n                                           53\n\f      view. That\u2019s what we argued in our brief to Your Honor, and that\u2019s what\n      Massey argued in their brief to Your Honor at pages 42 \u2013\n\n                    The Court: So there is no indemnity from Alpha as a parent\n      company \u2013\n\n                     [Alpha\u2019s Counsel]: On these claims, no, no. And the two\n      signatories to that contract agree that that is how it reads.\n\n                    There is a separate provision, 5.05(b), which applies to claims\n      threatened or brought after the signing of the merger agreement. 175\n\nThe claims for which Alpha\u2019s counsel was denying that Alpha would have any\n\nindemnification obligations were the derivative claims that had been asserted before the\n\nEffective Time in the case before the Court. Nothing in this colloquy, which did not even\n\ninvolve statements made by Blankenship\u2019s counsel, contradicts the interpretation of\n\nSection 5.05 Blankenship has advanced here. Indeed, at the end of the colloquy quoted\n\nabove, Alpha\u2019s counsel explicitly recognized that Section 5.05(b) would apply to \u201cclaims\n\nthreatened or brought after the signing of the merger agreement.\u201d\n\n      Finally, from my reading of the Court\u2019s decision in Massey Energy Co., then-Vice\n\nChancellor Strine did not adopt an interpretation of Section 5.05(b) of the Merger\n\nAgreement that is contrary to Blankenship\u2019s position in this case. The reason Section\n\n5.05 was relevant in Massey Energy Co. was because plaintiffs had argued, based on a\n\ndraft of a merger agreement Massey\u2019s counsel had prepared, that Alpha, as a third party,\n\nwas agreeing to indemnify Massey\u2019s management and directors beyond the extent to\n\n175\n    Letter from Matthew E. Fischer at Ex. 1 (May 13, 2015). Alpha\u2019s counsel\u2019s reference\nto the \u201ctwo signatories\u201d to the Merger Agreement refers to Alpha and Massey and does\nnot refer to Blankenship, who had retired from Massey by that time and was not a\nsignatory to the Merger Agreement.\n\n\n                                           54\n\fwhich Massey itself would have been permitted to do so under Delaware law such that,\n\nfor example, they would be indemnified for breaches of the fiduciary duty of loyalty\n\ninvolving scienter. After analyzing the record, then-Vice Chancellor Strine rejected this\n\nargument as a basis for injunctive relief because Section 5.05(b) of the final Merger\n\nAgreement only required Alpha to indemnify Massey\u2019s directors and officers \u201cto the\n\nfullest extent [Massey] would have been permitted to do so under applicable Law (for the\n\navoidance of doubt, subject to the limitations on [Massey\u2019s] ability to indemnify its\n\ndirectors and officers under Section 145 of the DGCL)\u201d: 176\n\n         I have carefully considered the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that a January 2011\n         draft of the Merger Agreement, written by Cravath [Massey\u2019s counsel],\n         supports the inference that the Board sought to sell the company to avoid\n         personal liability for the Derivative Claims. . . . [T]he draft Cravath sent to\n         Alpha was one that required Alpha to indemnify the Massey defendants for\n         any claim asserted against them in their capacity as Massey directors or\n         officers \u201cto the fullest extent permitted by Law.\u201d Alpha\u2019s counsel flagged\n         this as something that would need to be changed in any definitive merger\n         agreement because the draft merger agreement\u2019s indemnification provision\n         arguably could have allowed Alpha, because it was a third-party and not\n         Massey itself, to indemnify former Massey management and directors\n         beyond the extent Massey itself would have been permitted under Delaware\n         public policy and statutory law. To wit, Crutchfield\u2019s advisors must have\n         told him that the draft arguably could have required Alpha to indemnify\n         Massey fiduciaries for breaches of the fiduciary duty of loyalty involving\n         scienter, such as claims involving willful misconduct. Massey conceded\n         this point in the negotiations, and the issue was resolved when both parties\n         agreed to an indemnification provision that would require Alpha to\n         indemnify the Massey directors and officers, \u201cfrom and after the Effective\n         Time,\u201d only \u201cto the fullest extent [Massey] would have been permitted to\n         do so under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, subject to the\n         limitations on [Massey\u2019s] ability to indemnify its directors and officers\n         under Section 145 of the DGCL).\u201d Thus, Alpha\u2019s obligation to indemnify\n         was expressly limited by the extent to which Massey itself could have\n\n176\n      Massey Energy Co., 2011 WL 2176479 at *16 (internal quotations omitted).\n\n\n                                               55\n\f      legally indemnified the Massey directors and officers had it remained\n      independent\u2014limitations that precluded Massey from indemnifying its\n      fiduciaries for derivative settlements or judgments, bad faith misconduct,\n      or other wrongdoing involving scienter. Massey, for its part, as an Alpha\n      subsidiary, would continue, too, to maintain its current obligations under its\n      certificate of incorporation existing at the time of the Merger to indemnify\n      Massey directors and officers. Massey\u2019s certificate of incorporation\n      already guaranteed its directors and officers legally maximal advancement\n      and indemnification rights. Massey\u2019s certificate also contained an\n      exculpatory provision authorized by 8 Del. C. \u00a7 102(b)(7).\n\n              As a result, the final Merger Agreement only had Alpha provide a\n      guarantee that Alpha would accord the Massey directors and officers with\n      the same protection they were afforded by Massey\u2019s certificate of\n      incorporation. This did not immunize Massey directors or officers from\n      liability to Massey or Alpha for non-exculpated breached of fiduciary duty\n      that harmed Massey. 177\n\nAs the above passage makes clear, the Court did not adopt a construction of Section\n\n5.05(b) of the Merger Agreement that contradicts the argument Blankenship has made\n\nhere, i.e., that he is entitled to advancement from Alpha for the Criminal Proceeding\n\nunder Section 5.05(b) because he was made a party to that proceeding after the Effective\n\nTime for actions he took as a director and officer of Massey before the Effective Time.\n\nAccordingly, Alpha\u2019s judicial estoppel argument is without merit.\n\n                                        *****\n\n      For the reasons discussed above, under the plain meaning of the unambiguous\n\nterms of Section 5.05(b) of the Merger Agreement, Alpha is obligated to provide\n\nadvancement to Blankenship for the expenses he has incurred in the Criminal Proceeding.\n\n\n177\n   Massey Energy Co., 2011 WL 2176479, at *16-17 (emphasis added); see also id. at\n*26 (\u201cAlpha only promised to indemnify the Massey Board and management to the\nextent Massey itself could have and did in fact do so.\u201d).\n\n\n                                           56\n\fSection 5.05(b) conditions Alpha\u2019s obligation to do so \u201cupon receipt of any undertaking\n\nin favor of Parent and the Surviving Corporation of a type contemplated by the Company\n\nCertificate of Incorporation [i.e., Massey\u2019s Charter 178].\u201d Unsurprisingly, Alpha contests\n\nwhether Blankenship has provided an appropriate undertaking. I turn to that issue next.\n\n         E.     Blankenship has provided a Valid Undertaking Entitling Him to\n                Advancement from Alpha\n\n         In the Complaint, Blankenship sought an order \u201c[d]eclaring that Defendants have\n\neach breached Mr. Blankenship\u2019s contractual rights under the Merger Agreement . . . to\n\nadvancement of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses regarding the [Criminal] Proceeding.\u201d179\n\nOn February 27, 2015, after initiating this action, Blankenship delivered to Alpha the\n\nAlpha Undertaking, which states, in its entirety:\n\n                 I, Donald Blankenship, have retained counsel to represent me in\n         connection with an investigation and indictment captioned United States v.\n         Blankenship, No. 5:14-cr-00244, filed in the United States District Court\n         for the Southern District of West Virginia, as well as in connection with\n         any concurrent or other proceedings relating to (i) Performance Coal\n         Company, Massey Energy Company (n/k/a Alpha Appalachia Holdings,\n         Inc.)

(\u201cAlpha\u201d); or (iii) employees or\n         other persons associated with these entities. Pursuant to Section 5.05(b) of\n         the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of January 28, 2011, among\n         Mountain Merger Sub, Inc., Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., and Massey\n         Energy Company, Alpha agreed to advance on my behalf the fees and costs\n         associated with the representation to the fullest extent that Massey would\n         have been permitted to do so under applicable law upon receipt of an\n\n178\n    The Merger Agreement defines \u201cCompany Certificate of Incorporation\u201d as \u201c[t]he\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of [Massey] as in effect immediately\nprior to the Effective Time,\u201d which is same document defined above as the Charter.

It does not include\n\nthe Contingency Provision, any of the Undertaking\u2019s factual representations, or the\n\nTermination Provision.\n\n         Blankenship has requested that I order Alpha to advance his expenses for the\n\nCriminal Proceeding under the Alpha Undertaking. 181 In opposition, Alpha argues that\n\nBlankenship has \u201cno contractual or other basis to unilaterally impose this new\n\nundertaking,\u201d contending that, under 8 Del. C. 145(e), it has \u201cthe right to impose terms\n\nand conditions on Mr. Blankenship\u2019s advancement\u201d because he is a former officer and\n\ndirector of Massey. 182 Blankenship counters that because Massey\u2019s Charter does not\n\nexpressly authorize Massey to impose any terms or conditions on such advancement,\n\nSection 5.05(b) of the Merger Agreement precludes Alpha from imposing any terms or\n\n\n\n\n180\n      JX 48 (Alpha Undertaking).\n181\n      Tr. of Oral Arg. 135-36; Pl.\u2019s Reply Br. 18; Pl.\u2019s Op.

Br. 8. Although Massey\u2019s Charter does not expressly condition\nadvancement to a former director or officer upon delivery of an undertaking, Blankenship\ncannot legitimately dispute that, were he not entitled to indemnification, he would be\nrequired to repay the advanced legal expenses. See Reddy v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 2002\nWL 1358761, at *5 (Del. Ch. June 18, 2002). Thus, I do not view Blankenship as\narguing that he was not required under the Merger Agreement to deliver the Alpha\nUndertaking.\n184\n      JX 24 (Charter) at Art. Fifteenth.\n\n\n                                               59\n\fadvancement. Thus, as a matter of law based on the unambiguous words of Article\n\nFifteenth, 185 the only form of undertaking \u201cof a type contemplated by\u201d the Charter is\n\nsimply an undertaking to repay\u2014without any additional terms or conditions.186\n\nAccordingly, because no provision of the Charter or the Merger Agreement expressly\n\nauthorizes Alpha to demand any terms or conditions on advancement other than an\n\nundertaking to repay, Alpha does not have the right to request anything more from\n\nBlankenship than the Alpha Undertaking, 187 which he previously delivered. 188\n\n         Then-Vice Chancellor Strine\u2019s analysis in Reddy v. Electronic Data Systems\n\nCorp. 189 further supports my conclusion here. In that case, a former employee (Reddy)\n\n\n\n\n185\n    Charters of Delaware corporations are interpreted through contract interpretation\nprinciples, and charter provisions that are reasonably susceptible to only one\ninterpretation are afforded their \u201cplain, ordinary meaning.\u201d Alta Berkeley VI C.V. v.\nOmneon, Inc., 41 A.3d 381, 385 (Del. 2012).\n186\n   See In re Cent. Banking Sys., Inc., 1993 WL 183692, at *4 (Del. Ch. May 11, 1993)\n(concluding, where the only condition imposed by a mandatory advancement bylaw was\nthe delivery of an undertaking to repay, that the corporation lacked the authority to\nrequire \u201cthat the recipient of advance indemnification furnish appropriate security or\ndemonstrate financial responsibility as a condition to receiving advances\u201d).\n187\n    See Havens v. Attar, 1997 WL 55957, at *13 (Del. Ch.

See In re PNB Hldg. Co.\nS\u2019holders Litig., 2006 WL 2403999, at *18 (Del. Ch. Aug. 18, 2006).\n189\n      2002 WL 1358761 (Del. Ch. June 18, 2002).\n\n\n                                           60\n\fasserted that the corporation (EDS) was required to advance his legal expenses incurred\n\nin two pending lawsuits. EDS\u2019s advancement bylaw provided, in relevant part, that\n\n          [e]ach person who at any time shall serve or shall have served as a Director,\n          officer, employee or agent of the Corporation . . . shall be entitled to . . . the\n          advancement of expenses incurred by such person from the Corporation as,\n          and to the fullest extent, permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL[.] 190\n\nReddy argued he was entitled to advancement under the plain language of that bylaw\n\nwithout delivering an undertaking because an undertaking was not required by 8 Del. C. \u00a7\n\n145 for advancement to a former employee.                Then-Vice Chancellor Strine agreed,\n\nconcluding that EDS was precluded under the unambiguous language of its bylaws from\n\nrequiring an undertaking or imposing any other terms and conditions on Reddy\u2019s\n\nmandatory right to advancement:\n\n          The General Assembly specifically amended that statutory subsection [i.e.,\n          Section 145(e)] to give corporations the flexibility to advance funds to\n          employees and agents without an undertaking. In lieu of this required\n          undertaking, corporations may specify by bylaw or contract the terms and\n          conditions upon which employees and agents may receive advancement,\n          which could include an undertaking and more onerous pre-requisites to\n          advancement. Having been accorded the freedom to craft its bylaws as it\n          wished, EDS cannot point to its own drafting failures as a defense to\n          Reddy\u2019s advancement claim, however. If it chose, EDS could have\n          conditioned former employees\u2019 advancement rights on an undertaking,\n          proof of an ability to repay, or even the posting of a secured bond. But it\n          did not do so. 191\n\nThe logic of Reddy applies with equal force here and supports my conclusion that, under\n\nthe Merger Agreement and the Charter, the only term or condition that Alpha can impose\n\n\n190\n      Id. at *3.\n191\n      Id. at *4.\n\n\n                                                 61\n\fon advancement to Blankenship is an undertaking to repay if it shall ultimately be\n\ndetermined that he is not entitled to indemnification. Blankenship has provided such an\n\nundertaking in the Alpha Undertaking.\n\n         F.     Blankenship\u2019s Expenses in the Criminal Proceeding are Reasonable\n\n         Massey\u2019s Charter limits indemnification, and concomitantly limits advancement,\n\nto expenses \u201creasonably incurred.\u201d 192 The Merger Agreement similarly limits Alpha\u2019s\n\nadvancement obligations to \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.\u201d 193              The\n\nreasonableness of the invoices Blankenship has submitted for payment 194 was not the\n\nsubject of any inquiry at trial, and Defendants devoted only two paragraphs of their post-\n\ntrial brief to the subject. There, they argue that the summary or redacted invoices\n\nBlankenship has submitted are insufficient to establish that the legal fees he has incurred\n\nare reasonable. Defendants thus request that I either direct Blankenship to provide less\n\nredacted time sheets or appoint a special master to report on the reasonableness of the\n\nunredacted time sheets. 195 I decline Defendants\u2019 invitation to belabor this summary\n\nadvancement proceeding for three reasons.\n\n\n\n\n192\n    See JX 24 (Charter) at Art. Fifteenth. This is consistent with the reasonableness\nstandard for expenses under 8 Del. C. \u00a7 145. See Citadel Hldg. Corp. v. Roven, 603 A.2d\n818, 823 (Del. 1992).\n193\n      JX 26 (Merger Agreement) at \u00a7 5.05(b).\n194\n      See generally JX 57.\n195\n      Defs.\u2019 Ans.

I see no persuasive reason to depart from this course of dealing.\n\n         Second, in light of Alpha\u2019s cooperation agreement with the U.S. government, the\n\npractical realities of the Criminal Proceeding strongly weigh against requiring Zuckerman\n\nSpaeder to disclose itemized invoices about the legal services performed, which may\n\nshed light on the strategy for Blankenship\u2019s legal defense. I agree with Blankenship that\n\nthere is a serious and unnecessary risk of prejudice to his defense in the Criminal\n\nProceeding should, for example, Alpha be forced to (or voluntarily) turn any itemized\n\ninvoices over to the government.\n\n         Third, employing a special master to review unredacted invoices would be an\n\nunnecessary endeavor and inconsistent with the efficient administration of justice in this\n\ncase. \u201cAdvancement is not the proper stage for a detailed analytical review of the fees\n\n[for which advancement is sought], whether in terms of the strategy followed or the\n\n\n\n\n196\n      JX 21 (Engagement Letter) at DBDEL0010.\n\n\n                                            63\n\f                                 197\nstaffing and time committed.\u201d          In Fasciana v. Electronic Data Systems Corp., 198 then-\n\nVice Chancellor Strine explained why persnickety disputes over the reasonableness of the\n\nattorneys\u2019 fees sought in advancement cases are frowned upon:\n\n          [T]he function of a \u00a7 145(k) advancement case is not to inject this court as\n          a monthly monitor of the precision and integrity of advancement requests.\n          Unless some gross problem arises, a balance of fairness and efficiency\n          concerns would seem to counsel deferring fights about details until a final\n          indemnification proceeding, by which time the details may not even matter\n          as [the person seeking advancement] may (depending on the outcome of the\n          [underlying proceeding]) be obligated to repay all of the funds. 199\n\nDefendants have not advanced any substantive argument that the aggregate fees that have\n\nnot been paid (approximately $5.8 million as of April 1, 2015) are unreasonable. Nor\n\nhave they identified, in my view, any \u201cgross problem\u201d or other legitimate reason that\n\nwould warrant injecting a special master to \u201cperform the task of playground monitor,\n\nrefereeing needless and inefficient skirmishes in the sandbox.\u201d 200 Disputes over the\n\nreasonableness of Blankenship\u2019s expenses in the Criminal Proceeding can ultimately be\n\nresolved when any determination on indemnification is made.\n\n\n\n\n197\n   Duthie v.

Blankenship is Entitled to His Reasonable Expenses Incurred in\n                 Connection with this Action.\n\n         In Count IV of the Complaint, Blankenship seeks to recover the fees he incurred\n\nlitigating this action. Massey\u2019s Charter provides that a claimant who seeks advancement\n\nand is \u201csuccessful in whole or in part . . . shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of\n\nprosecuting such claim.\u201d 201 Under the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Stifel\n\nFinancial Corp. v. Cochran and its progeny, 202 a person who successfully prosecutes a\n\nclaim under 8 Del. C. \u00a7 145 is typically entitled to recover the reasonable expenses\n\nincurred in connection therewith unless the corporation precludes such recovery upfront\n\nin the governing document or contract providing for indemnification. 203 Section 5.05(a)\n\nof the Merger Agreement provides that Massey\u2019s indemnification obligations survive the\n\nmerger, and Section 5.05(b) provides that Alpha must indemnify Blankenship \u201cto the\n\nfullest extent [Massey] would have been permitted to do so under applicable Law.\u201d 204\n\n         In this opinion, I have concluded that Blankenship is entitled to advancement from\n\nMassey, under the Charter and Section 5.05(a) of the Merger Agreement, for all of the\n\nfees and expenses for which he seeks advancement; and from Alpha, under Section\n\n201\n      JX 24 (Charter) at Art.
