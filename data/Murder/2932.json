            "opinion_text": "\nVolterra, J.\nIn July 1990, defendant Miche\u00e1l Crawford (defendant) shot and killed Kimberly Noblin (Noblin). Noblin was pregnant and her fetus also died. Later that month, a grand jury returned two murder indictments against the defendant, one for the unlawful killing of Noblin, the other for the unlawful killing of Noblin\u2019s viable fetus. In April 1991, Abrams, J., presided over the defendant\u2019s trial. The jury found the *557defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter on both indictments. Consequently, Abrams, J., imposed two sentences to be served consecutively.\nIn October 1996, the defendant filed a motion to correct his sentence pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(a), relief from unlawful restraint. The gravamen of the defendant\u2019s claim is that the imposition of two consecutive sentences violates the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. Therefore, the main issue before this court is whether the killing of Noblin\u2019s viable fetus is the \u201csame offense\u201d as the killing of Noblin and, as such, not separately punishable.\nFor the reasons discussed below, the defendant\u2019s motion is denied.\nBACKGROUND\nOn July 7, 1990, the defendant shot Noblin in the face. Noblin\u2019s body was found more than four hours later after rigormortis had set in. At the time of the shooting, Noblin was at least seven months pregnant1 with the defendant\u2019s baby. The fetus died of oxygen deprivation. At trial, a medical examiner testified that the fetus was viable, \u201cmeaning it was old enough and had mature enough systems to survive outside of the mother.\u201d Commonwealth v. Crawford, 417 Mass. 358, 359 n.l (1994).\nDISCUSSION\nThe double jeopardy clause protects against three distinct abuses: (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) multiple punishments for the same offense when sought in separate proceedings. United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 440 (1989); Mahoney v. Commonwealth, 415 Mass. 278, 283 (1993). In essence, once jeopardy attaches, the defendant may not be retried for the \u201csame offense.\u201d\nThe court is burdened with the difficult task of determining whether two crimes constitute the \u201csame offense.\u201d Generally, courts adhere to the rule that two crimes do not constitute the same offense if each crime requires proof of an additional element that the other crime does not. Commonwealth v. Cepulonis, 374 Mass. 487, 494 n.13 (1978).2 This is known as the \u201csame evidence test.\u201d Id at 494. However, the \u201csame evidence test\u201d does not apply if the defendant is charged with committing two offenses under a single criminal statute. In that situation, a court looks to the legislative intent to determine whether assigning multiple punishments under a single statute is appropriate. Commonwealth v. Donovan, 395 Mass. 20, 28 (1985). In a multiple homicide case, \u201cthe decisive question ... is whether the Legislature intended that each death constitute a separate offense.\u201d Commonwealth v. Meehan, 14 Mass.App.Ct. 1028, 1028 (1982).\nIn the case at bar, the defendant was convicted twice of involuntary manslaughter under the manslaughter statute, G.L.c. 265, \u00a713. Therefore, arguably, the legislative intent test applies. The statute, however, only prescribes a punishment for manslaughter and does not define the crime. Instead, manslaughter has been defined by the courts. See, Commonwealth v. Beaulieu, 333 Mass. 640, 643 (1956) (manslaughter is the unlawful killing of another without malice). The common law also distinguishes between involuntary and voluntary manslaughter. See, Commonwealth v. Hinckley, 1 Mass.App.Ct. 195, 200 (1973) (involuntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of another without intent but caused by an act which constitutes such a disregard of the probable harmful consequences to another as to constitute wanton or reckless conduct; voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of another with \u201ca real design and purpose to kill, but without malice\u201d). In the absence of legislative preemption, the \u201clegislative intent test\u201d offers no guidance.\nThe Supreme Judicial Court, however, has ruled on this issue. In Commonwealth v. Lawrence, 404 Mass. 378, 383-384 (1989), the Court held that criminal liability attached to the unlawful killing of a viable fetus.3 The practical effect of Lawrence is that the killing of a mother is a \u201cseparate offense\u201d from the killing of the mother\u2019s viable fetus. Accordingly, a defendant can be punished for each death without running afoul of the double jeopardy clause. To hold otherwise would lead to an illogical result and effectuate a de facto overruling of Lawrence. In a case like the one at bar, a prosecutor would have to choose between indicting a defendant for the killing of the mother or for the killing of the mother\u2019s viable fetus.\nMoreover, historically, courts have permitted punishment for each death caused by a defendant\u2019s criminal conduct. Meehan, supra at 1029 (and cases cited therein).\nAccordingly, in the case at bar, this court finds that the defendant\u2019s sentence was not illegal as he was given one sentence for killing Noblin and a separate sentence for the entirely different offense of killing Noblin\u2019s viable fetus.\nORDER\nFor the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that the defendant\u2019s motion is DENIED.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, the male fetus weighed about two and one half pounds, was fifteen inches in length, and was between twenty-eight and thirty weeks in gestational age.\u201d Commonwealth v. Crawford, 417 Mass. 358, 359 n.1 (1994).\n\n\nAlso, crimes do not constitute the \u201csame offense\u201d just because some of the same facts are necessary to prove both crimes. Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932).\n\n\nThe Lawrence decision was based on Commonwealth v. Cass, 392 Mass. 799 (1984). In Cass, the Court held that the death of a viable fetus was a homicide within the meaning of the motor vehicle homicide statute. Id. at 807.\n\n",
