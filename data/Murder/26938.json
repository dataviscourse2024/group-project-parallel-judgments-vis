Iddings, appellant.\n                                                     ___ N.W.2d ___\n\n                                          Filed January 3, 2020.   No. S-19-304.\n\n                 1. Judgments: Appeal and Error. When issues on appeal present ques-\n                    tions of law, an appellate court has an obligation to reach an independent\n                    conclusion irrespective of the decision of the court below.\n                 2. Constitutional Law: Waiver: Appeal and Error. In determining\n                    whether a defendant\u2019s waiver of a statutory or constitutional right was\n                    voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, an appellate court applies a clearly\n                    erroneous standard of review.\n                 3. Sentences: Appeal and Error. An appellate court will not disturb a sen-\n                    tence imposed within the statutory limits absent an abuse of discretion\n                    by the trial court.\n                 4. Plea Bargains: Waiver: Appeal and Error. Where no objection was\n                    made to the sentencing judge for a plea bargain violation, the defendant\n                    has waived the error and it has not been preserved for appellate review.\n                 5. Effectiveness of Counsel: Proof. To prevail on a claim of ineffective\n                    assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104\n                    S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the defendant must show that his\n                    or her counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that this deficient per\u00ad\n                    formance actually prejudiced the defendant\u2019s defense.\n                 6. Courts: Plea Bargains. Courts enforce only those terms and conditions\n                    actually agreed upon by the parties to a plea agreement.\n                 7. Plea Bargains. A party breaches a plea agreement either by (1) violat-\n                    ing an express term of the agreement or (2) acting in a manner not spe-\n                    cifically prohibited by the agreement but still incompatible with explicit\n                    promises made therein.\n                 8. Plea Bargains: Sentences. A sentencing recommendation need not be\n                    enthusiastic in order to fulfill a promise made in a plea agreement.\n                 9. Appeal and Error. It is a fundamental rule of appellate practice that an\n                    alleged error must be both specifically assigned and specifically argued\n\f                                     - 760 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                      304 Nebraska Reports\n                               STATE v.

A generalized and vague assignment of error that does not advise\n      an appellate court of the issue submitted for decision will not be\n      considered.\n11.   Presentence Reports: Waiver. The statutory right to have a presentence\n      investigation completed prior to being sentenced may be waived so long\n      as that waiver was knowingly and intelligently made.\n12.   Waiver. No formalistic litany of warnings is required to show that a\n      waiver was knowingly and intelligently made.\n13.   Presentence Reports: Waiver: Appeal and Error. The appropriate\n      standard to apply in the case of a waiver of the right to a presentence\n      investigation under Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 29-2261 (Cum. Supp. 2014) is\n      whether it is apparent from the totality of the circumstances reflected in\n      the record that the defendant, when waiving the right, was sufficiently\n      aware of his or her right to a presentence investigation and the possible\n      consequences of his or her decision to forgo that right.\n14.   Criminal Law: Waiver. A knowing and intelligent waiver may be dem-\n      onstrated by or inferred from the defendant\u2019s conduct.\n15.   Courts: Presentence Reports: Waiver. It is the better practice for a\n      sentencing court to issue a more direct advisement of the statutory right\n      to a presentence investigation, conduct an explicit inquiry into the vol-\n      untariness of a defendant\u2019s waiver of that right, and make explicit find-\n      ings with respect to a waiver.\n16.   Sentences: Appeal and Error. Absent an abuse of discretion by the trial\n      court, an appellate court will not disturb a sentence imposed within the\n      statutory limits.\n17.   Judgments: Words and Phrases. An abuse of discretion occurs when a\n      trial court\u2019s decision is based upon reasons that are untenable or unrea-\n      sonable or if its action is clearly against justice or conscience, reason,\n      and evidence.\n18.   Sentences. The appropriateness of a sentence is necessarily a subjec-\n      tive judgment and includes the sentencing judge\u2019s observation of the\n      defendant\u2019s demeanor and attitude and all the facts and circumstances\n      surrounding the defendant\u2019s life.\n19.   Plea Bargains: Judges: Sentences. A judge is in no manner bound to\n      give a defendant the sentence recommended by the prosecutor under a\n      plea agreement.\n20.   Effectiveness of Counsel: Constitutional Law: Statutes: Records:\n      Appeal and Error. Whether a claim of ineffective assistance of trial\n      counsel can be determined on direct appeal presents a question of law,\n      which turns upon the sufficiency of the record to address the claim\n\f                                  - 761 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                    304 Nebraska Reports\n                            STATE v. IDDINGS\n                            Cite as 304 Neb. 759\n\n    without an evidentiary hearing or whether the claim rests solely on the\n    interpretation of a statute or constitutional requirement.\n21. Effectiveness of Counsel: Records: Appeal and Error. When review-\n    ing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, an\n    appellate court decides only whether the undisputed facts contained\n    within the record are sufficient to conclusively determine whether\n    counsel did or did not provide effective assistance, and whether the\n    defendant was or was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s alleged deficient\n    performance.\n\n Appeal from the District Court for Hall County: John H.\nMarsh, Judge. Affirmed.\n  Jonathan M. Hendricks, of Dowding, Dowding, Dowding &\nUrbom Law Offices, for appellant.\n   Douglas J. Peterson, Attorney General, and Erin E. Tangeman\nfor appellee.\n  Heavican, C.J., Cassel, Stacy, Funke, Papik, and\nFreudenberg, JJ.\n   Freudenberg, J.\n                      NATURE OF CASE\n   This case presents an appeal from a sentence imposed after\nthe defendant pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement. The\nState and the defendant had jointly agreed to recommend\nan 18-month period of incarceration. The district court ulti-\nmately sentenced the defendant to an indeterminate term of 18\nmonths\u2019 to 5 years\u2019 incarceration, and the defendant appeals.\nThe defend\u00adant asserts that the State breached its agreement to\nrecommend a sentence of 18 months\u2019 incarceration by remark-\ning that it \u201cstruggled\u201d concerning the sentencing recommen-\ndation. Further, the defendant argues that the court erred by\nfailing to order a presentence investigation when, although\ndefense counsel below stated that the defendant was waiving\nthe presentence investigation, the court only articulated that it\nhad found such an investigation to be impractical. The defend\u00ad\nant argues that the court abused its discretion in finding a\n\f                              - 762 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  304 Nebraska Reports\n                        STATE v. IDDINGS\n                        Cite as 304 Neb. 759\n\npresentence investigation impractical. The defendant generally\nasserts that the sentence was excessive and was a result of the\ncourt\u2019s abuse of discretion in failing to consider all of the sen-\ntencing factors, such as mentality, education and experience,\nor social and cultural background, in part as a result of failing\nto conduct a presentence investigation. Finally, the defendant\nargues that defense counsel below was ineffective for failing\nto request the proper amount of jail time credit pertaining to\nalleged time spent in jail in another county under arrest war-\nrants for both the present case and the charges filed in that\nother county.\n\n                         BACKGROUND\n   In relation to a traffic stop that occurred in July 2015, the\ndefendant, Matthew P. Iddings, was originally charged under\n\u201c60-6,196.15\u201d with driving under the influence (DUI), fourth\noffense aggravated, a Class III felony. Defense counsel and\nthe State reached a plea agreement pursuant to which the State\nfiled an amended information charging Iddings with a nonag-\ngravated DUI, fourth offense, under Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 60-6,196\n(Reissue 2010), a Class IIIA felony.\n   The amended information described that on July 2, 2015,\nIddings operated a motor vehicle and had a concentration of\n.08 of 1 gram or more by weight of alcohol per 100 milliliters\nof his blood or .08 of 1 gram or more by weight of alcohol per\n210 liters of his breath. The amended complaint further alleged\nthat this was the fourth DUI offense committed by Iddings,\nwho had been previously convicted of DUI in Nebraska on or\nabout May 26, 2005, and March 15 and December 12, 2007.\n   At the plea and sentencing hearing held on March 6, 2019,\ndefense counsel and the State explained to the court that they\nhad reached a plea agreement under which the State amended\nthe information from aggravated DUI, fourth offense, to non-\naggravated DUI, fourth offense, and agreed to recommend\njointly with defense counsel that Iddings be sentenced to 18\nmonths\u2019 incarceration.\n\f                              - 763 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  304 Nebraska Reports\n                        STATE v. IDDINGS\n                        Cite as 304 Neb. 759\n\n   As the factual basis for the crime, the State recited that on\nJuly 2, 2015, the \u201cNebraska State Patrol Help Line\u201d received\nmultiple telephone calls about a potential drunk driver on\nInterstate 80. An officer was able to locate the vehicle and\nobserved both passenger-side tires drive off the shoulder of the\nroadway two different times. The officer conducted a traffic\nstop and, upon contact with the driver, Iddings, noticed a smell\nof alcoholic beverage. A blood draw was eventually conducted\non Iddings, which demonstrated .307 grams of alcohol per 100\nmilliliters of blood.\n   Defense counsel agreed with the factual basis. Defense\ncounsel also stated the defense was willing to stipulate to the\nprior DUI offenses alleged in the information and that Iddings\nhad been represented by an attorney in each of the three\nprior offenses.\n   The court found the factual basis adequate to support the\nplea. After a standard plea colloquy, the court accepted Iddings\u2019\nno contest plea. The court found that the plea was not a result\nof any promise or threat; that the plea was entered knowingly,\nvoluntarily, and intelligently; and that Iddings knowingly, vol-\nuntarily, and intelligently waived his constitutional rights.\n   Defense counsel advised the court that Iddings\u2019 preference\nwas to proceed immediately to sentencing, noting that he had\ncalculated the jail time credit. The court did so.\n   When the court asked about a presentence investigation,\ndefense counsel stated, \u201cYour honor, . . . Iddings will waive his\nright to a presentence investigation.\u201d When asked by the court\nfor its comments, the State expressed that it had no objection\nto Iddings\u2019 waiver of the presentence investigation. However,\nIddings was not personally addressed by the court regarding\nsuch waiver.\n   The State noted with regard to Iddings\u2019 criminal history that\nother than the three prior convictions listed on the information,\nIddings also had a prior DUI in 1997. Further, he had commit-\nted a more recent DUI in Sarpy County around the same time\nas the charge he had just pled to and for which in October 2018\n\f                              - 764 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  304 Nebraska Reports\n                        STATE v. IDDINGS\n                        Cite as 304 Neb. 759\n\nhe had been sentenced to 18 months\u2019 incarceration. Lastly,\nIddings had a pending DUI charge in Grant County.\n   Defense counsel did not contest this history other than\nclarifying that Iddings had just finished serving his sentence\non the Sarpy County conviction in October 2018, as opposed\nto being sentenced in October 2018. Further, defense counsel\ndescribed that Iddings had already pled guilty to the charge of\nnonaggravated DUI, fourth offense, in Grant County and was\nawaiting sentencing.\n   After being so informed of the pending charges in Grant\nCounty, the district court for Hall County confirmed that\nIddings was \u201clikely to be transported to another county when\n[Hall County authorities were] done with him.\u201d The court\nfound \u201cunder those circumstances that a presentence investi-\ngation is impractical.\u201d Defense counsel did not object to this\nconclusion. The court did not make an express finding that the\npresentence investigation had been waived.\n   Defense counsel asked the court to adopt the plea agreement\nand sentence Iddings to 18 months\u2019 incarceration with 136\ndays\u2019 credit. Defense counsel informed the court that Iddings\nhad been in jail from October 23, 2017, to the date of the hear-\ning, March 6, 2019, and that he had been in jail for 2 additional\ndays in 2015.\n   Defense counsel asked the court to consider in sentencing\nthat Iddings had not been out of jail since 2017 and had thus\nexperienced a long period of sobriety. According to defense\ncounsel, Iddings fully intended to \u201cwalk out of the Department\nof Corrections a better man than when he went in, and he does\nbelieve that he can maintain long-term sobriety.\u201d\n   When asked by the court for its thoughts on sentencing, the\nState said:\n      [W]hen negotiating this case with [defense counsel], I\n      really struggled on what to agree to. We came down to the\n      18 months because that is what he got on a similar charge\n      in another county. If he was serving any other sentence,\n      I \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I would have agreed; but since this\n\f                              - 765 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  304 Nebraska Reports\n                        STATE v. IDDINGS\n                        Cite as 304 Neb. 759\n\n      will be consecutive to anything else that he was serving\n      previously, I agreed to recommend the 18 months.\n         I will note in addition to the DUIs that I\u2019ve already\n      mentioned, he did fail to appear in this case on June 8th,\n      2016, and was not arrested until, I believe, a year later;\n      and then he was transported here, I believe, on October\n      24th of last year.\n   The record reflects that a bench warrant had been issued by\nthe district court for Hall County on June 8, 2016, for Iddings\u2019\nfailure to appear at a scheduled hearing. The appellate record\ndoes not reflect an arrest in Sarpy County in 2017. Instead, a\ndocument filed on October 24, 2018, reflects that Iddings was\narrested in Hall County on October 23, 2018, on the June 8,\n2016, warrant.\n   Having been present for the foregoing, Iddings was asked\nby the court whether he had any legal reason why the court\nshould not pronounce its sentence and whether he had anything\nelse to bring to the court\u2019s attention before the court sentenced\nhim. Iddings responded that he did not have any reason why\nthe court should not proceed to sentencing. Iddings apologized\nfor not appearing in court on June 8, 2016, explaining, \u201cIt was\na health issue, I was in the hospital.\u201d\n   The court sentenced Iddings to a term of incarceration of\n18 months to 5 years, with \u201ccredit for 136 days.\u201d Iddings\u2019\ndriver\u2019s license was revoked for 15 years. Defense counsel\nraised no objection to the sentence. In its final order, the court\nnoted that the parties had agreed to 18 months\u2019 incarceration\nand informed Iddings that it was not bound by the plea nego-\ntiations. The court reiterated its conclusion that a presentence\ninvestigation would be impractical and did not articulate any-\nthing pertaining to a waiver of the same.\n   Iddings appeals his sentence. He has obtained new counsel\nto represent him on appeal.\n                 ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Iddings assigns that (1) the district court abused its discre-\ntion by sentencing him to a term of incarceration of 18 months\n\f                                  - 766 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     304 Nebraska Reports\n                            STATE v. IDDINGS\n                            Cite as 304 Neb. 759\n\nto 5 years without due consideration of established sentencing\nfactors, (2) the State violated the plea agreement, (3) he was\nentitled to additional credit for time served, (4) trial counsel\nwas ineffective for failing to object to the State\u2019s violation of\nthe plea agreement, and (5) trial counsel was ineffective for\nfailing to request at the sentencing hearing additional credit for\ntime served.\n                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1] When issues on appeal present questions of law, an\nappellate court has an obligation to reach an independent con-\nclusion irrespective of the decision of the court below.1\n   [2] In determining whether a defendant\u2019s waiver of a statu-\ntory or constitutional right was voluntary, knowing, and intel-\nligent, an appellate court applies a clearly erroneous standard\nof review.2\n   [3] An appellate court will not disturb a sentence imposed\nwithin the statutory limits absent an abuse of discretion by the\ntrial court.3\n                          ANALYSIS\n   Iddings\u2019 fundamental complaint on appeal is that he was\nsentenced to an indeterminate period of incarceration of 18\nmonths to 5 years rather than 18 months to 18 months. He seeks\nthe option of withdrawing his plea or seeking resentencing\nbefore a different judge on the ground that the State allegedly\nbreached its plea agreement by undermining its recommenda-\ntion of an 18-month sentence of incarceration. Alternatively,\nIddings seeks resentencing under the assertions that the court\nimposed an excessive sentence and that the court\u2019s decision\nto forgo a presentence investigation was plain error. Finally,\nIddings argues that defense counsel below was ineffective for\n\n1\n    State v. Landera, 285 Neb. 243, 826 N.W.2d 570 (2013).\n2\n    State v. Qualls, 284 Neb. 929, 824 N.W.2d 362 (2012).\n3\n    State v. Montoya, ante p. 96, 933 N.W.2d 558 (2019).\n\f                                    - 767 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     304 Nebraska Reports\n                             STATE v. IDDINGS\n                             Cite as 304 Neb. 759\n\nfailing to request credit for an additional 58 days\u2019 jail time for\nwhich he was ineffectively given credit against the sentence\nimposed in Sarpy County. We find that Iddings\u2019 claim regard-\ning credit for time served cannot be determined on direct\nappeal, and we disagree with Iddings\u2019 remaining assignments\nof error. We affirm the judgment below.\n\n                        Plea Agreement\n   [4] Iddings asserts that the State breached its plea agree-\nment to recommend 18 months of incarceration by effec-\ntively undermining that sentence in its comments to the court\nat the sentencing hearing. Trial counsel did not object to\nthe State\u2019s comments. Where no objection was made to the\nsentencing judge for a plea bargain violation, the defenda\u00adnt\nhas waived the error and it has not been preserved for appel-\nlate review.4 Iddings argues, however, that trial counsel was\nineffective by failing to object to the alleged breach and\neither ask the court to allow Iddings to withdraw the plea or\ndemand specific performance of the plea agreement before a\ndifferent judge.5\n   [5] We agree with Iddings and the State that this ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel claim can be resolved on direct\nappeal, because the record is sufficient to adequately review\nthe question.6 To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance\nof counsel under Strickland v.

Landera,12 we held that the State had\nbreached a plea agreement to recommend probation when it\nstated at sentencing that it could not recommend probation\nand believed the court should impose incarceration instead,\nelaborating upon the danger that the defendant would pose to\nthe public if placed immediately on probation. The State had\nalso made a \u201cperfunctory recommendation of probation,\u201d but\nwe concluded that \u201cthe tenor of [the State\u2019s] entire argument\nundermined its purported recommendation, thereby breaching\nthe express term of the agreement.\u201d13\n   [8] Landera is distinguishable from the present case. At\nIddings\u2019 sentencing hearing, the State merely expressed\nthat it had \u201cstruggled\u201d with what to agree to. Nevertheless,\nthe State reinforced its agreed-upon sentencing recommen-\ndation by stating that after this \u201cstruggle[],\u201d it ultimately\nfound 18 months\u2019 incarceration to be reasonable given that\nthe sentence would be consecutive to Iddings\u2019 sentence on\na similar charge in another county.

As we\nstated in Landera, \u201ca sentencing recommendation need not\nbe enthusiastic in order to fulfill a promise made in a plea\nagreement.\u201d14 The State did not effectively undermine its\npromised recommendation.\n   Defense counsel below was not deficient for failing to object\nto the State\u2019s alleged breach of the plea agreement, because the\nState did not commit such a breach.\n\n              Lack of Presentence Investigation\n   [9,10] Next, Iddings argues that the district court committed\nplain error by failing to procure a presentence investigation\nbefore sentencing. The State asserts that this argument was not\nassigned as error. It is a fundamental rule of appellate practice\nthat an alleged error must be both specifically assigned and spe-\ncifically argued in the brief of the party asserting the error to\nbe considered by an appellate court.15 A generalized and vague\nassignment of error that does not advise an appellate court of\nthe issue submitted for decision will not be considered.16\n   While we agree with the State that Iddings\u2019 assignment of\nerror could have been better crafted, we will consider the fail-\nure to procure the presentence investigation as encompassed\nby Iddings\u2019 assignment of error that \u201c[t]he district court abused\nits discretion by sentencing [Iddings] to a sentence of eighteen\nmonths to five years without due consideration of established\nsentencing factors.\u201d Iddings argues that the absence of the\npresentence investigation contributed to the court\u2019s ultimate\nfailure to consider all the relevant sentencing factors, which\nconstituted the alleged abuse of discretion in reaching the inde-\nterminate 18-month-to-5-year sentence that Iddings asks this\ncourt to reverse as excessive.\n\n14\n     Id. at 257, 826 N.W.2d at 579.\n15\n     State v.

Conducting a colloquy for\na waiver of a presentence investigation ensures that the record\nwill affirmatively demonstrate that the defendant has know-\ningly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived that right. While the\nrecord in this case is adequate without such a colloquy, it may\nnot be in another case.\n   Having concluded that the court did not err in failing to\norder a presentence investigation, because Iddings expressly\nwaived that statutory right, we need not consider whether the\ncourt abused its discretion in determining that a presentence\ninvestigation was impractical because Iddings was likely to be\ntransported to another county immediately after sentencing.\n\n                      Excessive Sentence\n   [16,17] Next, we address Iddings\u2019 excessive sentence argu-\nment. Absent an abuse of discretion by the trial court, an\nappellate court will not disturb a sentence imposed within the\nstatutory limits.31 An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial\ncourt\u2019s decision is based upon reasons that are untenable or\nunreasonable or if its action is clearly against justice or con-\nscience, reason, and evidence.32\n\n29\n     State v.

Where, as\nhere, a sentence imposed within the statutory limits is alleged\non appeal to be excessive, the appellate court must determine\nwhether a sentencing court abused its discretion in considering\nand applying the relevant factors as well as any applicable legal\nprinciples in determining the sentence to be imposed.33\n   [18] In determining a sentence to be imposed, relevant fac-\ntors customarily considered and applied are the defendant\u2019s (1)\nage, (2) mentality, (3) education and experience, (4) social and\ncultural background, (5) past criminal record or record of law-\nabiding conduct, and (6) motivation for the offense, as well as\n(7) the nature of the offense and (8) the amount of violence\ninvolved in the commission of the crime.

Under such circumstances, we find no abuse\nof discretion.36\n   We also agree with the State that it is difficult to find an\nabuse of discretion in an excessive sentence analysis when the\nminimum imposed was the term the defendant agreed to in a\nplea bargain agreement. It is the minimum portion of an inde-\nterminate sentence which measures its severity.37\n   [19] We find no merit to Iddings\u2019 assertion that the district\ncourt \u201cabused its discretion by disregarding the joint plea\nrecommendation.\u201d38 Assuming without deciding that the joint\nplea recommendation was, as Iddings asserts, for an indetermi-\nnate term of incarceration of 18 months to 18 months, a judge\nis in no manner bound to give a defendant the sentence recom-\nmended by the prosecutor under a plea agreement.39 Given the\nnumber of DUI convictions and charges that were undisputed\nbelow, it was reasonable for the court to conclude that it was\nnecessary for Iddings\u2019 safety and the safety of the public to\nimpose a higher maximum term in order to ensure proper\npostrelease supervision.\n\n                  Credit for Time Served\n  Lastly, appellate counsel argues in this direct appeal that\ndefense counsel below was ineffective for failing to request\n58 additional days of jail time credit under Neb.

According to appellate counsel,\nalthough the district court for Sarpy County purported to apply\nall 336 days against the sentence there imposed, 58 days of that\njail time were not truly applied because they were in excess of\nthe 278 days he was sentenced to serve, when calculated with\nmandatory good time.\n   [20] According to appellate counsel, defense counsel below\nshould have been aware that the 58 days\u2019 jail time credit was\nthe \u201cresult of\u201d the underlying charge in this case and that it had\nnot been truly applied in the Sarpy County case. Thus, appel-\nlate counsel concludes that defense counsel was ineffective in\nfailing to request the proper amount of jail time credit\u2014when\ndefense counsel had waived the presentence investigation and\nrepresented that he was able to accurately inform the court of\nthe applicable jail time. Whether a claim of ineffective assist\u00ad\nance of trial counsel can be determined on direct appeal pre\u00ad\nsents a question of law, which turns upon the sufficiency of the\nrecord to address the claim without an evidentiary hearing or\nwhether the claim rests solely on the interpretation of a statute\nor constitutional requirement.40\n   [21] The determining factor is whether the record is suf-\nficient to adequately review the question.41 We have said the\nrecord is sufficient if it establishes either that trial counsel\u2019s\nperformance was not deficient, that the appellant will not\nbe able to establish prejudice, or that trial counsel\u2019s actions\ncould not be justified as a part of any plausible trial strategy.42\nWe have also said that when reviewing claims of ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel on direct appeal, an appellate court\ndecides only whether the undisputed facts contained within the\nrecord are sufficient to conclusively determine whether counsel\n\n40\n     State v.
