Discerning no error  in the\r\r          lower court's eschewal of the requested instruction, we affirm.\r\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\r                    Following  Philip DeStefano's arrest  and indictment on\r\r          federal narcotics charges, the government  housed him at a county\r\r          jail.    DeStefano  contacted  his  younger  brother,  defendant-\r\r          appellant  Anthony S.  DeStefano, and  solicited assistance  in a\r\r          contemplated escape.   He  told appellant to  park his  van at  a\r\r          specific  location at  a specific  time, and  await developments.\r\r          Appellant agreed.\r\r                    At approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 8, 1994, Philip\r\r          DeStefano bolted.   After another  prisoner boosted  him over  an\r\r          interior  fence, he  scaled an  exterior  fence topped  by barbed\r\r          wire, took his leave  of the jailhouse grounds, and  followed the\r                              \r          ____________________\r\r               1The statute of conviction provides in pertinent part:\r\r                    Whoever  rescues or  attempts  to  rescue  or\r                    instigates,  aids or  assists  the escape  or\r                    attempt to  escape,  of any  person  arrested\r                    upon a warrant or  other process issued under\r                    any law of the United States, or committed to\r                    the custody of the Attorney General or to any\r                    institution  or  facility  by his  direction,\r                    shall, if the  custody or  confinement is  by\r                    virtue of an arrest on a charge of felony, or\r                    conviction  of any  offense, be  [punished as\r                    provided by law].\r\r          18 U.S.C.   752(a) (1988).\r\r                                          2\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          railroad tracks for a short distance.  As he travelled along  the\r\r          tracks, he  spotted officers  conversing casually near  the jail.\r\r          Realizing  that the guards had not  yet discovered his departure,\r\r          he discarded his distinctively colored prison shirt and sauntered\r\r          across a parking  lot to appellant's van.  The  two brothers then\r\r          drove toward friendlier climes.\r\r                    The  authorities   became  aware   of  the  escape   at\r\r          approximately 11:30 p.m.   By then, the DeStefano brothers  had a\r\r          three-hour head start.  Several  days later, lawmen captured them\r\r          in  New  York.     Federal  prosecutors  charged  appellant  with\r\r          assisting an escape in  violation of 18 U.S.C.   752(a)  and with\r\r          concealing  an escaped  prisoner  in violation  of the  harboring\r\r          statute, 18 U.S.C.   1072.2\r\r                    We  omit   any  exegetic  account  of  the  intervening\r\r          proceedings  and  cut  directly  to  the  heart  of  the  appeal.\r\r          Appellant pleaded not guilty and stood trial.  At trial's end, he\r\r          requested the following jury instruction:\r\r                    When the physical control has ended by flight\r                    beyond immediate active  pursuit, the  escape\r                    is  complete.   Any  assistance  beyond  this\r                    point is not aiding and abetting.\r\r          The  district  court refused  to  give this  instruction  in haec\r                                                                       ____\r                              \r          ____________________\r\r               2The harboring statute provides:\r\r                         Whoever  willfully  harbors or  conceals\r                    any   prisoner  after  his  escape  from  the\r                    custody  of  the Attorney  General or  from a\r                    Federal  penal  or correctional  institution,\r                    shall  be  imprisoned  not  more  than  three\r                    years.\r\r          18 U.S.C.   1072 (1988).\r\r                                          3\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          verba, instead telling the jury that:\r          _____\r\r                    The crime  of aiding  or assisting  an escape\r                    cannot  occur  after   the  escapee   reaches\r                    temporary  safety.     After  that,   aid  or\r                    assistance to  a fugitive is no longer aiding\r                    or  assisting  his escape,  whatever  else it\r                    might be.\r\r          Appellant took a  timeous objection  to the charge,  see Fed.  R.\r                                                               ___\r\r          Crim. P. 30, on the  ground that the court should have  given the\r\r          \"flight  beyond immediate active  pursuit\" instruction,  and that\r\r          its failure to do so undermined the defense.\r\r                    The  jury  found   appellant  guilty  on   both  counts\r\r          (assisting  an  escape  and  harboring an  escapee).    Following\r\r          imposition  of sentence,  appellant  perfected this  appeal.   He\r\r          challenges only his conviction under 18 U.S.C.   752(a).\r\r          II.  DISCUSSION\r          II.  DISCUSSION\r\r                    This  is a rifle-shot appeal  that draws a  bead on the\r\r          district court's refusal to  embrace the \"flight beyond immediate\r\r          active pursuit\" instruction.  The standard of review is ironclad:\r\r          \"The  trial  court's refusal  to  give  a particular  instruction\r\r          constitutes reversible  error only  if the  requested instruction\r\r          was  (1)  correct  as  a  matter  of  substantive  law,  (2)  not\r\r          substantially incorporated  into the charge as  rendered, and (3)\r\r          integral to  an important point in  the case.\"  United  States v.\r                                                          ______________\r\r          McGill, 953 F.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 1992); accord  United States v.\r          ______                                   ______  _____________\r\r          Nason, 9 F.3d 155, 161 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied,  114 S.

Appellant argues that\r\r          he  wanted no  more  than to  have the  district court  use time-\r\r          honored  language here, and that the court should have yielded to\r\r          his entreaty.   He points to  three precedents that he  says cast\r\r          the  court's disavowal  of  the \"flight  beyond immediate  active\r\r          pursuit\" articulation  into disrepute.  We examine  each of these\r\r          cases.\r\r                    In Orth v.

Four weeks later, he\r\r          appeared on  the defendant's doorstep in  South Carolina, seeking\r\r          asylum.   The defendant lent a helping hand.  A jury subsequently\r\r          convicted Orth on  a charge  of assisting a  convict to  escape.3\r\r          The Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that by the time Orth became\r\r          involved,  the event  of escape  had long  since concluded.   The\r\r          court stated:  \"When the physical control [over the prisoner] has\r\r          been ended by  [his] flight beyond immediate  active pursuit, the\r\r          escape is  complete.\"  Id. at  568.

Smithers, charged with\r             ________\r\r          aiding  an   escape  under  section  752(a),   requested  a  jury\r\r          instruction  that contained the  \"flight beyond  immediate active\r\r          pursuit\" language.  The trial court denied the  request, choosing\r\r          instead  to charge according to the letter of the statute itself.\r\r          Following a guilty verdict, Smithers appealed.  The Fifth Circuit\r\r          vacated  the  conviction,   holding  that  defendant's  suggested\r\r          instruction was substantively correct  and that the trial court's\r\r          failure to  give it  impermissibly impaired Smithers'  ability to\r\r          raise his theory of defense.

In\r\r          all three  cases, unlike  here, the relevant  assistance occurred\r\r          days after the  end of any immediate  pursuit, at a location  far\r\r          removed from the  place of liberation.  See  Smithers, 27 F.3d at\r                                                  ___  ________\r\r          143-44; Vowiell, 869 F.2d at 1265-66;  Orth, 252 F. at 568.

As in Orth, the court gave no consideration either to how\r                        ____\r\r          jury instructions should be worded or to what language would best\r\r          fit a  case in which  pursuit had not  yet been mounted  when the\r\r          defendant first aided  the escapee.   Smithers, though closer  to\r                                                ________\r\r          the mark, is also inapposite.  While the opinion memorializes the\r\r          need to give a jury instruction regarding the limits to be placed\r\r          on  a  charge of  aiding  an  escape, it  does  not address  what\r\r          language is most  fitting when, as now,  there is no evidence  of\r\r          any  immediate, active  pursuit.   Nor  does  the Smithers  court\r                                                            ________\r\r          explore the pros  and cons  of using language  such as  appellant\r\r          tenders as  opposed to the \"temporary  safety\" language preferred\r\r          by the court below.\r\r                    Since these  precedents are not dispositive,  we take a\r\r          fresh look.   The linchpin of a charge under section 752(a)   and\r\r          the feature that sets it  apart from a charge of  harboring under\r\r          section 1072   is the showing  that the accused aided or assisted\r\r          an  escape rather  than merely  aiding or  assisting an  escapee.\r              ______                                               _______\r\r          This requires, of  course, that  a line be  drawn separating  the\r\r                              \r          ____________________\r\r               4The circumstances of Orth are such that,  on any reasonable\r                                     ____\r          view of the statute, the defendant's conviction for assisting  an\r          escape could not be  justified.  The fugitive  had been at  large\r          almost a month  and had  traveled through two  states before  the\r          defendant lifted a finger to help him.  See 252 F. at 567.  These\r                                                  ___\r          facts placed the defendant well outside the outer boundary of any\r          charge  of aiding and abetting  the escape regardless  of how the\r          court's opinion might be phrased.\r\r                                          8\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          escape    a  discrete event    from  what may  follow thereafter.\r\r          This  task is  perhaps more  difficult than  it appears  at first\r\r          blush, as the  term \"escape\"    which, after  all, means  nothing\r\r          more  or  less  than  \"absenting  oneself  from  custody  without\r\r          permission,\"  United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 407 (1980)  \r                        _____________    ______\r\r          encompasses  a wide  range of  scenarios.  Moreover,  the general\r\r          definition,  without the  insertion of  limiting  language, would\r\r          make breaking  out of  prison a virtually  endless continuum,  so\r\r          that any person who assisted an escapee, no matter how long after\r\r          the event or how distant from  the place of immurement, would  be\r\r          guilty  of  violating  section  752(a).   To  avoid  the  obvious\r\r          absurdity  inherent in  this  result, the  jury instruction  in a\r\r          criminal  prosecution brought  under section  752(a) must  draw a\r\r          clear, comprehensible line between the discrete event    that is,\r\r          the escape   and what may follow.\r\r                    We think that  the court's decision  here to frame  its\r\r          instruction in terms  of \"reach[ing] temporary safety\"  furnished\r\r          the necessary guidance  to the jury.5   The instruction described\r\r          an ascertainable point at  which the jury might find  that aiding\r\r          the escape ended and harboring began.  Thus, the delivered charge\r                              \r          ____________________\r\r               5Our confidence in the term is bolstered by its familiarity;\r          the  term  is  regularly  applied  in  other  analogous  criminal\r          contexts.

Thus,  the term's  common  law\r          history informs the use of it here.\r\r                                          9\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r          was well within  the realm of the trial  court's discretion.

And, moreover, the\r\r          court's  language  seems particularly  apt  when contrasted  with\r\r          appellant's alternative formulation.  Where, as here, there is no\r\r          evidence that pursuit had been mounted  at or before the time the\r\r          defendant  rendered assistance,  an instruction  that centers  on\r\r          \"flight  beyond  immediate active  pursuit\"  risks  confusing and\r\r          confounding the jury without  supplying a scintilla of additional\r\r          enlightment.\r\r                    That ends  the matter.   Clear, easily  understood jury\r\r          instructions are vitally important  in assuring that jurors grasp\r\r          subtle or  highly nuanced  legal concepts.    Partially for  this\r\r          reason, the law is  settled that a trial court  may appropriately\r\r          refuse  to give a  proffered jury instruction  that is incorrect,\r\r          misleading, or incomplete  in some material respect.
