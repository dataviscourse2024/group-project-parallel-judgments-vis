Winters, Chief\nAssistant Attorney General, Susan Sullivan Pithey, Assistant\nAttorney General, Paul M. Roadarmel, Jr., and Michael Katz,\nDeputy Attorneys General, for Plaintiff and Respondent.\n\f       In 2018, a jury convicted defendant and appellant Oscar\nMedina of four counts of attempted murder (Pen. Code,1 \u00a7\u00a7 187,\nsubd. (a), 664), and four counts of assault with a firearm (\u00a7 245,\nsubd. (a)(2)). The trial court imposed an aggregate sentence\nof 62 years to life in prison. We affirmed the convictions but\nremanded the case to the trial court with instructions to strike\none 5-year prior serious felony enhancement (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1)),\nto consider whether to strike other serious felony and firearm\nenhancements in light of new laws enacted after the sentencing\nhearing, and to stay rather than impose concurrent sentences\nfor assault with a firearm. (See People v. Medina (2019) 33\nCal.App.5th 146, 157 (Medina).)2\n       At a hearing following remand, the trial court elected not\nto strike the firearm enhancement, but did not discuss the serious\nfelony enhancements. The abstract of judgment filed after the\nhearing includes all of the previously imposed serious felony\nenhancements. The abstract of judgment also indicates that the\ntrial court stayed the sentences for assault with a firearm, but\nthe court made no statement about this during the hearing.\n       Medina contends that the trial court erred by failing to act on\nthe serious felony enhancements and by failing to state during the\nhearing that the sentences for assault with a firearm were stayed.\nHe also contends that the trial court abused its discretion by\nrefusing to strike the firearm enhancement, that his sentence\n\n      1 Unless otherwise specified, subsequent statutory references\nare to the Penal Code.\n      2 The opinion in Medina\u2019s direct appeal was certified\nfor partial publication. Elsewhere in this opinion, we cite the\nnonpublished portions of the same opinion as People v. Medina (Mar.\n19, 2019, B286117) [as modified April 16, 2019].\n\n\n\n\n                                   2\n\fviolates the state and federal constitutional protections against cruel\nand unusual punishments, and that the court abused its discretion\nby refusing to reduce his $5,000 restitution fine. We agree with\nMedina as to the failure to act on the serious felony enhancements\nand to declare on the record that the sentences for assault with a\nfirearm were stayed. In all other respects, we affirm.\n\n             FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n       In our prior opinion, we briefly summarized the facts of the\ncase: \u201cDefendants Antonio Silva and Oscar Medina, members of\nthe Headhunters gang, were driving through the turf of a rival gang\ncalled Diamond Street. They lost control of their car and crashed\ninto an apartment building. Bystanders gathered to look at the\naccident. Unable to move the disabled vehicle, Silva and Medina\nleft and returned in another car. Silva got out of the car, pointed\nhis gun, and started shooting at bystanders while Medina\nattempted to recover the crashed car. The people on the street\n(including two individuals, Juan Alcaraz and Jose Sanchez, who\nlived in the apartment building) fled in terror. None ended up\nbeing hit by the gunfire. Medina was still unable to move the car,\nand Silva and Medina then left separately. Silva left in the car in\nwhich he and Medina had returned to the accident scene. Before\nMedina left on foot, he screamed his gang\u2019s name and a derogatory\nterm for the Diamond Street gang.\u201d (Medina, supra, 33 Cal.App.5th\nat p. 149.)\n       The trial court sentenced Medina to 62 years to life in prison.\nThe sentence consisted of a base high term of nine years to life for\none count of attempted murder (\u00a7 664, subd. (a)), tripled because\nMedina had suffered two prior strike convictions (see \u00a7\u00a7 667,\nsubd. (e)(1), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)(A)(i)), plus 20 more years because\na principal personally and intentionally discharged a firearm\n\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\fin the commission of the offense (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (c), (e)),3\nplus five additional years for each of three prior serious felony\nenhancements. (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1).) The court imposed the same\nsentence, to run concurrently, on each of the three other attempted\nmurder convictions. As to the convictions on four counts of assault\nwith a firearm, the court stated that these counts would all \u201cmerge\npursuant to Penal Code [s]ection 654.\u201d The abstract of judgment\nindicated a concurrent sentence for those four counts. In addition\nto other fines, the trial court imposed a restitution fine of $5,000.\n       After the sentencing hearing but before the judgment\nagainst Medina became final, the Legislature enacted Senate\nBill No. 620 (2017\u20132018 Reg. Sess.) (Stats. 2017, ch. 682,\npp. 5104-5106) (Senate Bill No. 620) and Senate Bill No. 1393\n(2017-2018 Reg. Sess.) (Senate Bill No. 1393), which gave trial\ncourts the discretion to strike, respectively, five-year enhancements\nunder section 667, subdivision (a)(1), and firearm enhancements\nunder section 12022.53, for purposes of sentencing.\n       In addition to raising other issues, Medina contended in his\ndirect appeal that the new laws applied retroactively to his case,\nand that the trial court must hold a new hearing to decide whether\nor not to strike the firearm and previous felony enhancements from\nhis sentence. We agreed and remanded the case for this purpose.\n(People v. Medina (Mar. 19, 2019, B286117) [nonpub. portion of\n\n\n      3 Although Medina did not personally fire the weapon, the\nfirearm enhancement nevertheless applied to him because the jury\nfound that Medina committed the offense for the benefit of, at the\ndirection of, or in association with a criminal street gang, with the\nspecific intent to promote, further, or assist in criminal conduct by\ngang members. (See \u00a7\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b); 12022.53, subd. (e)(1);\nMedina, supra, 33 Cal.App.5th at pp. 150\u2013152.)\n\n\n\n\n                                  4\n\fopn.] at pp. 37\u201338.) We also agreed with Medina that the trial\ncourt erred by imposing two prior serious felony enhancements\nbased on two convictions in the same case. (Id. at pp. 38\u201339.)\nThose enhancements apply only to convictions based \u201con charges\nbrought and tried separately.\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1).) Finally, we\nagreed with Medina that the trial court erred by failing to stay the\nsentences for Medina\u2019s convictions for assault with a firearm under\nsection 654. (People v. Medina, supra, B286117, at p. 39.)\n       We remanded the case to the trial court with directions to\n\u201crecalculate Medina\u2019s sentence to strike one of the five-year prior\nserious felony enhancements, determine whether to strike the two\nremaining prior serious felony enhancements under section 667,\nsubdivision (a)(1) and/or the 20-year firearm-use enhancement\nunder section 12022.53, subdivision (c), and reduce the sentence\naccordingly if appropriate.\u201d (Medina, supra, 33 Cal.App.5th\nat p. 157.) In addition, we ordered the trial court to \u201cstay the\nsentences on counts 5 through 8 for assault with a firearm under\nsection 654,\u201d and \u201cto prepare new abstracts of judgment.\u201d (Ibid.)\n       At a hearing following remand, the court stated that the case\n\u201cwas submitted back for me to reconsider whether I wish to strike\nthe [section 12022.53 firearm enhancements] that were imposed.\n       \u201cHaving heard the evidence in this case, I\u2019m not inclined to\ndo so. So I\u2019ve exercised my discretion, and the conviction stays as\npreviously set.\u201d\n       Medina\u2019s attorney raised two objections. First, he objected\nto the imposition of the restitution fine \u201cgiven that [Medina] was\nnot provided an opportunity to be heard on his ability to pay when\nthat restitution order was imposed.\u201d In addition, Medina objected\nto the sentence \u201cunder the [Eighth] Amendment grounds [of]\ncruel and unusual punishment.\u201d The trial court overruled both\n\n\n\n\n                                  5\n\fobjections, noting that Medina played an active role in the shooting,\nand that he would be able to pay the restitution fine with wages he\nwould earn in prison.\n        Neither the trial court nor the attorneys addressed the\nserious felony enhancements or the sentences for assault with a\nfirearm. The court prepared a new abstract of judgment, which\nlisted the four counts of assault with a firearm as stayed under\nsection 654, but which did not change the number of serious felony\nenhancements, nor the aggregate length of the sentence of 62 years\nto life.\n\n                            DISCUSSION\n      A.    Remand to Fulfill Obligations From Prior\n            Appeal\n       Medina contends that we must remand the case once again\nto allow the trial court to fulfill the requirements we imposed in\nour prior opinion. The Attorney General agrees, as do we. \u201c[W]hen\nan appellate court remands a matter with directions governing\nthe proceedings on remand, \u2018 \u201cthose directions are binding on the\ntrial court and must be followed.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Ramirez (2019) 35\nCal.App.5th 55, 64.)\n       In this case, the trial court fulfilled our directions only\nin part, and we must remand the case once again so that the\ntrial court can fulfill the remainder of the requirements. In\nparticular, the court must strike one of the two prior serious\nfelony enhancements under section 667, subdivision (a)(1) that\nwere based on two counts tried together in case number BA255819.\nAs we explained in our prior opinion, the court may impose these\nenhancements \u201cfor each . . . prior conviction on charges brought and\ntried separately.\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1), italics added.) This applies to\n\n\n\n\n                                   6\n\fall four counts of attempted murder, including the three counts for\nwhich the trial court imposed concurrent sentences. In addition,\nthe trial court must decide whether to exercise its discretion under\nSenate Bill No. 620 to strike either or both of the remaining serious\nfelony enhancements for the four attempted murder counts.\n       The trial court also made no pronouncement with regard to\nthe convictions for assault with a firearm. The record of the first\nsentencing hearing indicates that the trial court intended from\nthe outset to stay the sentences under section 654, but misspoke\nin stating that the sentences would \u201cmerge.\u201d The amended\nabstract of judgment specifies that the sentences for these\ncounts are stayed, but \u201cthe abstract of judgment is not itself the\njudgment of conviction, and cannot prevail over the court\u2019s oral\npronouncement of judgment to the extent the two conflict.\u201d (People\nv. Delgado (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1059, 1070, superseded by statute on\nanother ground, as stated in People v. Frahs (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th\n784, 795.) In order to avert any future confusion about the\nsentence, we will order the trial court to state on the record that the\nfour counts of assault with a firearm are stayed under section 654.\n\n      B.    Decision Not to Strike the Firearm Enhancements\n      Medina contends that the trial court abused its discretion\nby deciding not to strike the firearm enhancement under\nsection 12022.53, subdivision (c) for purposes of sentencing. We\ndisagree.\n      As part of Senate Bill No. 1393, the Legislature enacted\nsection 12022.53, subdivision (h), which gives trial courts the\ndiscretion \u201c \u2018in the interest of justice pursuant to Section 1385 and\nat the time of sentencing, [to] strike or dismiss an enhancement\notherwise required to be imposed by this section.\u2019 \u201d As we explained\nin a prior decision on this subject, we review the trial court\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n                                   7\n\fdecision whether to strike an enhancement under section 1385\nfor abuse of discretion. (People v. Pearson (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th\n112, 116 (Pearson).) \u201c \u2018In reviewing for abuse of discretion, we are\nguided by two fundamental precepts. First, \u201c \u2018[t]he burden is on\nthe party attacking the sentence to clearly show that the sentencing\ndecision was irrational or arbitrary. [Citation.] In the absence\nof such a showing, the trial court is presumed to have acted to\nachieve legitimate sentencing objectives, and its discretionary\ndetermination to impose a particular sentence will not be set aside\non review.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.] Second, a \u201c \u2018decision will not be reversed\nmerely because reasonable people might disagree. \u201cAn appellate\ntribunal is neither authorized nor warranted in substituting its\njudgment for the judgment of the trial judge.\u201d \u2019 \u201d [Citation.] Taken\ntogether, these precepts establish that a trial court does not abuse\nits discretion unless its decision is so irrational or arbitrary that\nno reasonable person could agree with it.\u2019 \u201d (Ibid., quoting People v.\nCarmony (2004) 33 Cal.4th 367, 376\u2013377.)\n       The trial court explained its decision not to strike the\nenhancement on the basis of its own experience having \u201cheard\nthe evidence in this case.\u201d The court noted that Medina and Silva\n\u201cwere driving in what would be rival gang territory. [\u00b6] They\ncrashed up against an apartment house, left the location, and then\ncame back. And the videotape showed what appeared to be the\ngun being transferred back and forth between the two of them.\u201d\nAlthough Silva was the shooter, \u201cMedina\u2019s involvement was more\nthan passive.\u201d\n       Medina takes issue with the trial court\u2019s statement that\nthe video appeared to show a gun transferred between Medina\nand Silva five minutes before the shooting. The surveillance video\nfootage shows Medina and Silva walking away from the scene of\n\n\n\n\n                                  8\n\fthe car accident. Medina carried a dark colored object in one hand,\nheld it up as if he meant to pass it to Silva, then dropped it on\nthe ground. Silva picked it up, and the two continued walking.\nAccording to Medina, the item seen in the video was not the correct\nshape to be the gun, and thus there was no evidence that Medina\npersonally held the gun or transferred it to Silva.\n       We have reviewed the video footage, and although we cannot\nsay with certainty that the item in Medina\u2019s hand was a gun,\nwe defer to the trial court\u2019s reasonable inference that it was.\n(See People v. King (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1323.) But the\ntrial court did not justify its decision solely on the basis that\nMedina passed the gun to Silva, but rather on the conclusion that\nMedina\u2019s involvement was \u201cmore than passive.\u201d Medina disagrees\nwith that characterization, but the evidence is against him. His\nculpability depends much less on whether he passed the gun to\nSilva while he was walking away from the car crash than on his\nactions five minutes later, when the shooting took place. As the\nsurveillance video shows, Medina and Silva returned to the scene\nof the accident riding in a car with an unknown driver. Even before\nthe vehicle slowed down, Medina opened the front passenger side\ndoor and leaned out, appearing to use the door as a shield. The\ncar began to slow, and Silva opened the rear passenger door. Both\nSilva and Medina exited the car before it came to a full stop. Silva\nwalked toward the crowd gathered near the car and began shooting.\n       This evidence yields inferences in support of the jury\u2019s\nverdicts finding both defendants guilty of attempted murder and\nof the trial court\u2019s decision not to strike the firearm enhancement.\nMedina and Silva knew they were traveling in a rival gang\u2019s\nterritory and appeared to have planned for a confrontation when\nthey returned to the scene of the accident. This explains why they\n\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\fwere hiding behind the open doors of the car, ready to jump out\nat a moment\u2019s notice. Furthermore, whether or not Medina ever\nhandled the gun, the evidence is susceptible of the inference that\nhe knew that Silva was armed and was prepared to fire the weapon.\nAfter Silva shot at the bystanders, Medina showed no sign of\nsurprise, remorse, or concern about the well-being of the victims.\nFar from objecting to Silva\u2019s actions, Medina stayed at the scene\nand yelled an insult about the rival gang at the bystanders who\nhad taken cover from the shooting.\n       Medina points out accurately that, although no one was\ninjured in the shooting, his sentence\u201457 years to life, even after\nsubtracting five years for the incorrectly imposed serious felony\nenhancement\u2014is lengthier than the base term of 25 years to life for\nfirst degree murder. (See \u00a7 190, subd. (a).) But of course Medina\u2019s\nsentence is not based solely on the immediate circumstances of\nthe crime in isolation, but also reflects his long history of criminal\nbehavior, as well as his willingness to participate in a crime\ninvolving the shooting of firearms for the benefit of a criminal street\ngang and endangering the lives of many in the crowd.\n       Reasonable minds might differ on the appropriate length of\nMedina\u2019s sentence, but it is not our role to substitute our judgment\nfor that of the trial court. We cannot say that the trial court\u2019s\ndecision not to strike the enhancement is \u201c \u2018so irrational or arbitrary\nthat no reasonable person could agree with it.\u2019 \u201d (Pearson, supra,\n38 Cal.App.5th at p. 116.) Thus, we cannot reverse the trial court\u2019s\ndecision.4\n\n\n      4 We also disagree with Medina\u2019s contention that his attorney\nrendered ineffective assistance by failing to advocate more\nforcefully on his behalf. There is no reasonable probability that\n\n\n\n\n                                  10\n\f      C.          Cruel and/or Unusual Punishment\n       Medina contends that his sentence violates the federal\nEighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment,\nas well as the California constitutional ban on cruel or unusual\npunishment. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 17.) We rejected an identical\nclaim in Medina\u2019s direct appeal, and we reject it again now.\n       The Attorney General contends, and we agree, that the\nlaw of the case doctrine bars our reconsideration of this issue.\n\u201cUnder the doctrine of the law of the case, a principle or rule that\na reviewing court states in an opinion and that is necessary to\nthe reviewing court\u2019s decision must be applied throughout all\nlater proceedings in the same case, both in the trial court and on a\nlater appeal.\u201d (People v. Jurado (2006) 38 Cal.4th 72, 94 (Jurado).)\n\u201cThus, the law-of-the-case doctrine \u2018prevents the parties from\nseeking appellate reconsideration of an already decided issue in\nthe same case absent some significant change in circumstances.\u2019 \u201d\n(People v. Boyer (2006) 38 Cal.4th 412, 441.)\n       In Medina\u2019s direct appeal, we held that Medina forfeited\nthe claim that his sentence represented cruel and/or unusual\npunishment under the state and federal constitutions, and that in\nany event, his claim failed on the merits in that it was not grossly\ndisproportionate in light of the defendant\u2019s own actions, how other\ncrimes are punished in California, and how similar crimes are\npunished in other jurisdictions. (See People v. Medina, supra,\nB286117, at pp. 34\u201337.) In this appeal, Medina once again claims\nthat he did not forfeit the claim of cruel or unusual punishment,\n\n\ndifferent arguments at the hearing would have obtained a better\noutcome for Medina. (See Strickland v. Washington (1984) 466 U.S.\n668, 694.)\n\n\n\n\n                                 11\n\fand that his sentence is grossly disproportionate. He argues that\nthe law of the case doctrine does not apply because there has been\na change in circumstances. In particular, he notes that his attorney\nraised the issue of cruel or unusual punishment at the hearing after\nremand, unlike in his original appeal, when his attorney did not\nraise the issue at the original sentencing hearing. But this is beside\nthe point. The law of the case doctrine applies \u201cthroughout all later\nproceedings in the same case, both in the trial court and on a later\nappeal.\u201d (Jurado, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 94.) By the time Medina\u2019s\nattorney raised the issue after remand, the law of the case doctrine\nalready applied to the issue. Medina forfeited the issue by failing\nto raise it at the original sentencing hearing, and his subsequent\nactions do not change that fact.\n       In addition, Medina contends that the circumstances have\nchanged because that at the time of the original appeal, there\nwas a possibility that the trial court would strike the firearm\nenhancement on remand. In this appeal, by contrast, the trial\ncourt has already rejected that possibility. We are not persuaded\nthat this distinction makes a difference. In our original opinion,\nwe addressed the constitutionality of Medina\u2019s full sentence: \u201c[A]n\naggregate state prison term of 62 years to life.\u201d (People v. Medina,\nsupra, B286117, at p. 34.) We held that that sentence did not\nviolate the prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment. The\npossibility that the trial court might reduce the sentence did not\nenter into our analysis.\n       Even if the law of the case doctrine did not apply, Medina\u2019s\nclaim would fail on the merits. We explained this matter in detail in\nour prior opinion in this case (People v. Medina, supra, B286117,\nat pp. 34\u201337), and we stand by that analysis.\n\n\n\n\n                                 12\n\f      D.           Restitution Fine\n       At the hearing after remand, Medina objected to the amount\nof the $5,000 restitution fine (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)(1)) on the grounds\nthat he had not had an opportunity to be heard on his ability to\npay the fine, and that the amount of the fine constituted cruel and\nunusual punishment. Medina now contends that the trial court\nabused its discretion by overruling the objection. We are not\npersuaded.\n       The trial court must impose a restitution fine of at least\n$300 and no more than $10,000 for any defendant convicted of a\nfelony, \u201cunless it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for\nnot doing so and states those reasons on the record.\u201d (\u00a7 1202.4,\nsubd. (b).) The court may determine the amount of the fine at its\ndiscretion \u201cand commensurate with the seriousness of the offense.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)(1).) \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s inability to pay may not\nbe considered a compelling and extraordinary reason not to impose\nthe restitution fine; inability to pay may be considered only when\nincreasing the amount of the restitution fine above the minimum\nrequired by statute.\u201d (People v. Castellano (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th\n485, 489.)\n       Medina contends that the amount of the fine was\nincommensurate with the seriousness of the offense, arguing\nthat his role in the crime was relatively minor and noting\nthat no one was injured in the shooting. We disagree. First,\nsection 1202.4, subdivision (b)(2) sets out a formula that the\ncourt may use in setting the amount of the fine, consisting of\n\u201cthe minimum fine [$300] . . . multiplied by the number of years\nof imprisonment the defendant is ordered to serve, multiplied by\nthe number of felony counts of which the defendant is convicted.\u201d\n(\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)(2).) In this case, the $5,000 fine is significantly\n\n\n\n\n                                   13\n\fless than the amount specified by that formula. Second, contrary\nto Medina\u2019s claims, and as we have described above (see Discussion\npart B, ante), he played more than a minor role in the crime. We\ndo not understand how a $5,000 fine was incommensurate with his\nactive participation in a crime that endangered the lives of many\npeople.\n       Next, Medina argues that the trial court erred by failing to\ntake into account his ability to pay the fine. The trial court refused\nto reduce the amount of the fine on this ground because \u201cit would\nappear . . . that he would be able to . . . recompense through prison\nwages that he would be earning.\u201d\n       We agree with the court in People v. Kopp (2019) 38\nCal.App.5th 47, 96, review granted November 13, 2019, S257844\n(Kopp) that \u201c[i]t is the defendant who bears the burden of proving\nan inability to pay.\u201d The language of section 1202.4 does not\nrequire the court to ascertain or take into consideration the\ndefendant\u2019s ability to pay. Instead, the statute provides that\n\u201c[i]nability to pay may be considered only in increasing the amount\nof the restitution fine in excess of the minimum fine.\u201d (\u00a7 1202.4,\nsubd. (c), italics added.) As the court explained with respect to\nanother fine in People v. McMahan (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 740, 749,\nunless the statutory language clearly makes the defendant\u2019s ability\nto pay a condition precedent of imposing the fine, the defendant\nbears the burden of raising the issue and providing evidence. In\naddition to being superior as a matter of statutory interpretation,\nthis makes sense from a practical standpoint, since \u201cthe most\nknowledgeable person regarding the defendant's ability to pay [is]\nthe defendant himself.\u201d (Ibid.)\n       At the hearing after remand, Medina\u2019s attorney objected\nto the amount of the fine but presented no evidence of Medina\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n                                  14\n\fability to pay. Consequently, the trial court did not err by denying\nMedina\u2019s motion. Medina contends that this failure represented\nineffective assistance of counsel, but even now, he has failed to\nshow that the trial court\u2019s decision not to reduce the fine was wrong\non the merits. Medina notes that at current prison wages, he can\nexpect to pay only about $60 per year toward the fine. Assuming\nthat there are no future increases in prison wages and that Medina\nhas no other sources of income, it would take more than 83 years\nfor the fine to be paid off. But Medina cites no authority for the\nproposition that a fine is excessive if it is more than the amount\nthe defendant can expect to pay entirely during his sentence using\nhis prison wages alone. In People v. Due\u00f1as (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th\n1157, the court held that the imposition of certain fines and fees\nwithout taking into account the defendant\u2019s ability to pay was a\nviolation of due process because it could result in the imprisonment\nof an indigent defendant solely as a result of his inability to pay.\n(See id. at pp. 1166\u20131167.) That is not a concern in this case, where\nMedina is already in custody, and where the law provides a formula\nfor deducting payments from a prisoner\u2019s wages to pay his fines.\n(See \u00a7 2085.5.) The trial court did not abuse its discretion by failing\nto take into account the potential unpaid amount when Medina is\nreleased from prison decades from now.\n\n\n\n\n                                  15\n\f                           DISPOSITION\n        The defendant\u2019s convictions are affirmed. The matter\nis remanded to the trial court with directions to strike one\nenhancement under section 667, subdivision (a)(1) from each of\nthe four counts of attempted murder. The trial court must also\ndecide with respect to each count of attempted murder whether or\nnot to strike the two additional enhancements under section 667,\nsubdivision (a)(1), and declare on the record that the four counts of\nassault with a firearm are stayed under section 654. After it takes\nall of these actions, the trial court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s\nsentence and prepare a new abstract of judgment and forward it to\nthe Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n        NOT TO BE PUBLISHED.\n\n\n\n\n                                           ROTHSCHILD, P.
