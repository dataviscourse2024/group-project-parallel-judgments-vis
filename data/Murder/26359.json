Williams, appeals from the order of the Court of Common\n\nPleas of Lehigh County dismissing his timely first petition filed pursuant to the Post\n\nConviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546.1 We affirm.\n\n                         I. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n        On May 29, 1995, Appellant, together with four co-defendants, planned to rob\n\nRichard White, a drug dealer they believed to possess significant amounts of cash.\n\nDuring the commission of the robbery outside White\u2019s home, Appellant shot White three\n\ntimes with a MAC 10 automatic weapon.         White died from his wounds.      Appellant\n\n\n\n1 The PCRA provides that this Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from a\nfinal order granting or denying relief in cases where the death penalty has been imposed.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9546(d); Commonwealth v. Mason, 130 A.3d 601, 610 n.1 (Pa. 2015).\n\frepresented himself during his trial and sentencing proceedings, which were presided\n\nover by Judge Edward Reibman. Judge Reibman appointed standby counsel.2 A jury\n\nconvicted Appellant of first-degree murder, robbery, and conspiracy to commit robbery.3\n\nThereafter, Appellant was sentenced to death. On appeal, Appellant again proceeded\n\npro se with access to new standby counsel. A more detailed account of the factual and\n\nprocedural history of this stage of the case is provided in our 2006 opinion.             See\n\nCommonwealth v. Williams, 896 A.2d 523, 530-32 (Pa. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1213\n\n(2007) (Williams I).\n\n         On direct appeal, standby counsel, on behalf of Appellant, filed several procedural\n\napplications with this Court during the pendency of the appeal. In addition to four requests\n\nfor extension of time to file a brief, which we granted, standby counsel filed an application\n\nfor remand to the trial court to prepare a supplemental opinion; an application for remand\n\nto the trial court to supplement the certified record; a motion for funds and/or remand to\n\nretain the services of mitigation and psychological experts; a motion for remand to\n\nsupplement the certified record with affidavits of witnesses; and a motion for remand to\n\nsupplement the certified record with an affidavit of standby counsel. On April 9, 2003,\n\nstandby counsel, on behalf of Appellant, filed Appellant\u2019s brief, raising eighteen\n\nallegations of error in the pre-trial, trial and penalty phases of the trial court proceedings.\n\n         On April 29, 2003, this Court issued a series of per curiam orders which granted\n\nremand for standby counsel to file a statement of matters complained of on appeal with\n\nthe trial court and for that court to prepare a supplemental opinion; granted remand to\n\nsupplement the certified record; granted remand for the trial court to consider Appellant\u2019s\n\n2The Commonwealth was represented by then Assistant District Attorney (ADA) Maria L.\nDantos. In 2007, ADA Dantos was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Court of Common\nPleas of Lehigh County and subsequently elected to a full term.\n3   18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2502(a), 37(a)(1); and 903(a)(1) & (2), respectively.\n\n\n                                       [J-30-2018] - 2\n\frequest to supplement the certified record with witness statements regarding any grant of\n\nimmunity or bail arrangements; granted remand for the trial court to consider Appellant\u2019s\n\nrequest to supplement the certified record with standby counsel\u2019s affidavit regarding\n\ncriminal records of Commonwealth witnesses; and denied Appellant\u2019s motion for funds\n\nand/or remand to secure an expert relative to Appellant\u2019s competency.\n\n       On June 4, 2003, Appellant filed an application for relief entitled \u201cMotion to File an\n\nEmergency Amended Pro Se Appeal.\u201d Therein, Appellant asserted that standby counsel\n\nwas acting without his authorization by filing a brief that failed to contain various issues\n\nhe wished to include. On August 12, 2003, this Court tolled the briefing schedule pending\n\nfiling of the trial court\u2019s opinion. On September 17, 2003, standby counsel, by \u201cLetter in\n\nLieu of Supplemental Brief,\u201d indicated Appellant would rely on the brief filed on April 9,\n\n2003. On December 23, 2003, this Court issued a per curiam order denying Appellant\u2019s\n\nJune 4, 2003 application for relief. On June 27, 2005, Appellant filed an application for\n\nleave to file post-submission communication.         Therein, Appellant raised the same\n\nallegations as in his June 4, 2003 motion. Specifically, he alleged that \u201c[i]nstead of\n\npresenting [A]ppellant\u2019s relevant issues as promised, this \u2018stand-by counsel\u2019 unwanted in\n\nthe first place, [r]eplaced [Appellant\u2019s] original issues with his own frivolous, specious\n\nissues and forged [A]ppellant\u2019s signature to the brief . . ..\u201d Pro Se Application for Relief,\n\n357 Cap., 6/27/2005 at 3. Within his pro se June 4, 2003 and June 27, 2005 motions,\n\nAppellant set forth the nine or ten additional issues he wished this Court to address. On\n\nNovember 16, 2005, we issued a per curiam order denying Appellant\u2019s application for\n\npost-submission communication. This Court affirmed the judgment of sentence on April\n\n21, 2006. Williams I, 896 A.2d at 548.\n\n       Appellant filed a timely pro se PCRA petition on March 9, 2007. The PCRA court\n\nappointed the Federal Community Defender Office for the Eastern District of\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-30-2018] - 3\n\fPennsylvania (FCDO) to represent Appellant. Appellant again expressed his intention to\n\nproceed pro se, which the PCRA court confirmed in a colloquy on June 5, 2008, with the\n\nFCDO remaining as standby counsel.          The PCRA court granted Appellant several\n\nextensions to file an amended PCRA petition. Appellant filed an amended petition on\n\nJuly 24, 2009. Appellant filed a motion for discovery pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 902(E)(2) on December 18, 2009. The Commonwealth filed a motion\n\nto dismiss on January 7, 2010. Appellant filed an answer to the Commonwealth\u2019s motion\n\non March 10, 2010.4\n\n       In December 2010, the PCRA court granted, in part, Appellant\u2019s discovery\n\nrequests, and continued the hearing on the merits of Appellant\u2019s PCRA petition. In May\n\n2011, Appellant renewed a discovery request for the prosecution\u2019s notes of witness\n\ninterviews and preparation sessions.      The PCRA court granted the request.          The\n\nCommonwealth sought reconsideration and an opportunity to be heard on the issue. The\n\nPCRA court denied the motion for reconsideration and the Commonwealth appealed to\n\nthis Court. We held that the PCRA court abused its discretion in granting the discovery\n\nrequest absent support in the record that good cause was shown as required by\n\nPennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 902(E)(2). See Commonwealth v. Williams, 86\n\nA.3d 771 (Pa. 2014) (Williams II).5 The PCRA court, in the meantime, conducted a full\n\n4 On that date, In light of Judge Dantos\u2019 ascension to the bench, Judge Reibman recused\nhimself, sua sponte. Subsequently, this Court appointed Senior Judge John L. Braxton\nto preside over the case.\n5 Included in our mandate to the PCRA court in Williams II was an instruction to determine\n\u201cthe propriety of the role of the FCDO as standby counsel.\u201d Williams II, 86 A.3d at 791.\nThis question had been similarly raised by this Court in a number of other cases. See\nCommonwealth v. Wright, 78 A.3d 1070, 1087 (Pa. 2013) (collecting cases). The record\ndoes not show that the PCRA court made such a determination, however, as we\nacknowledged in Commonwealth v. Sepulveda, 144 A.3d 1270, 1276-77 (Pa. 2016), the\nThird Circuit has ruled that the question of the disqualification of the FCDO implicates the\nregulatory scheme Congress has enacted and is, therefore, preempted. See In re\n\n\n\n                                      [J-30-2018] - 4\n\fmultiday PCRA hearing, commencing December 14, 2010 and concluding on May 2,\n\n2012. After submission of post-hearing briefs, the PCRA court filed an order dismissing\n\nAppellant\u2019s PCRA petition.\n\n                               II. General Principles of Law\n\n       \u201cOn appeal from the denial of PCRA relief, our standard of review calls for us to\n\ndetermine whether the ruling of the PCRA court is supported by the record and free of\n\nlegal error.\u201d Commonwealth v. Washington, 927 A.2d 586, 593 (Pa. 2007) (citations\n\nomitted). \u201cThe PCRA court\u2019s credibility determinations, when supported by the record,\n\nare binding on this Court; however, we apply a de novo standard of review to the PCRA\n\ncourt\u2019s legal conclusions.\u201d Commonwealth v. Roney, 79 A.3d 595, 603 (Pa. 2013), cert.\n\ndenied, Roney v. Pennsylvania, ---U.S.---. 135 S. Ct. 56 (2014). To be eligible for relief\n\nunder the PCRA, a defendant must plead and prove that his conviction and/or sentence\n\nresulted from one of the circumstances delineated by the PCRA. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n\n9543(a)(2) (outlining the requirements to be eligible for PCRA relief). Among those\n\nrequirements are that the issue raised be neither previously litigated nor waived. Id. at\n\n9543(a)(3). \u201cAn issue is previously litigated if \u2018the highest appellate court in which the\n\npetitioner could have had review as a matter of right has ruled on the merits of the issue.\n\n. . .\u2019 [42 Pa.C.S.] \u00a7 9544(a)(2). An issue is waived \u2018if the petitioner could have raised it\n\nbut failed to do so before trial, at trial, . . ., on appeal, or in a prior state postconviction\n\nproceeding.\u2019 Id. \u00a7 9544(b).\u201d Commonwealth v. Keaton, 45 A.3d 1050, 1060 (Pa. 2012).\n\n\u201cAppellant has the burden to persuade this Court that the PCRA court erred and that such\n\nerror requires relief. [Also, i]t is well settled that this Court may affirm a valid judgment or\n\nCommonwealth\u2019s Motion to Appoint Counsel Against or Directed to Def. Ass\u2019n of Phila.,\n790 F.3d 457, 461 (3d Cir. 2015), as amended (June 16, 2015), cert. denied sub nom.\nPennsylvania v. Def. Ass\u2019n of Phila., \u2013\u2013\u2013U.S.\u2013\u2013\u2013, 136 S. Ct. 980 (2016), and cert. denied\nsub nom. Pennsylvania v. Fed. Cmty. Def. Org. of Philadelphia, \u2013\u2013\u2013U.S.\u2013\u2013\u2013, 136 S. Ct.\n994 (2016). Accordingly, we do not address the issue further here.\n\n\n                                        [J-30-2018] - 5\n\forder for any reason appearing as of record.\u201d Commonwealth v. Wholaver, 177 A.3d 136,\n\n144-45 (Pa. 2018) (citations omitted). In this case, Appellant acted pro se during his trial,\n\nsentencing and direct appeal. Accordingly, his right to assert claims of ineffectiveness of\n\ncounsel under Section 9544(a)(2) is circumscribed.           \u201c[W]e will not consider any\n\nineffectiveness claims that arise from the period of self-representation.\u201d Commonwealth\n\nv. Bryant, 855 A.2d 726, 737 (Pa. 2004).\n\n                                  III. Appellant\u2019s Issues\n\n       Appellant raises fourteen issues. The bulk of these allege trial court error or\n\nprosecutorial misconduct in the pretrial, trial and sentencing phases of his prosecution.\n\nThese issues bear a direct relationship with the issues Appellant asserted, in his June 4,\n\n2003 and June 27, 2005 pro se motions, had been improperly omitted from his direct\n\nappeal brief by standby counsel. We set forth the issues verbatim.\n\n              I.       Is Appellant entitled to a new trial because the\n              prosecutor committed multiple acts of prosecutorial\n              misconduct that, individually and cumulatively, denied him a\n              fair trial and whose conduct amounted to a fraud on the court?\n\n              II.    Was Appellant denied his constitutional rights to self -\n              representation, to be present, and to present a defense when\n              the trial court with standby counsel conducted a pre-trial\n              hearing without Appellant\u2019s knowledge or consent and\n              excluded him from participating?\n\n              III.    Were Appellant\u2019s constitutional rights violated when\n              standby counsel objected to his closing argument and told the\n              jury that Appellant was not being truthful, thereby usurping his\n              right to represent himself and undermining his ability to\n              present a defense?\n\n              IV.     Was Appellant denied his constitutional rights where\n              the trial court ordered Appellant to wear a stun belt at trial\n              without a hearing and without any threatening or inappropriate\n              behavior by Appellant?\n\n              V.      Did the trial court violate Appellant\u2019s rights to remain\n              silent and presumption of innocence when it commented that\n\n\n                                      [J-30-2018] - 6\n\f              Appellant was testifying in closing argument and failed to\n              testify during trial?\n\n              VI.     Were Appellant\u2019s due process rights violated where the\n              trial court failed to provide a jury instruction on evidence of\n              other crimes committed by Curtis French?\n\n              VII. Was Appellant denied his rights to a fair trial and an\n              impartial jury because Lehigh County jury selection\n              procedures systematically excluded minorities?\n\n              VIII. Was Appellant denied his constitutional rights to\n              present a defense, to call witnesses on his behalf, to\n              confrontation, and to due process when the trial court\n              prohibited him from presenting evidence of his innocence?\n\n              IX.    Was Appellant\u2019s death sentence arbitrarily imposed\n              where the prosecution improperly admitted victim impact\n              evidence and the jury failed to give any effect to unrebutted\n              statutory mitigating factors presented during the sentencing\n              phase?\n\n              X.      Did the trial judge err when he conducted himself in a\n              partial manner in this case?\n\n              XI.     Were Appellant\u2019s state and federal rights to self-\n              representation and due process violated where Pennsylvania\n              allow[ed] him to represent himself on appeal but then\n              undermined his right to self-representation when it accepted\n              a brief filed by standby counsel, over his objection, that did not\n              contain the issues Appellant wished to raise on appeal and\n              standby counsel was ineffective for failing to raise those\n              claims?\n\n              XII. Were Appellant\u2019s rights to a full, fair, and complete\n              PCRA hearing violated?\n\n              XIII. Did the PCRA court err by failing to rule on Appellant\u2019s\n              motion to amend his post-conviction petition docketed June\n              19, 2015?\n\n              XIV. Is Appellant entitled to relief because of the cumulative\n              effect of the errors in this case?\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 1-3.\n\n                    IV. Previous Litigation and/or Waiver of Issues\n\n\n                                       [J-30-2018] - 7\n\f       We address first whether Appellant\u2019s issues I through X raise claims for which he\n\nis eligible for relief under the PCRA. This requires consideration of Appellant\u2019s issue XI,\n\nwhich includes his argument against the PCRA court\u2019s waiver conclusions. As is evident\n\nfrom Appellant\u2019s statement of the issues quoted above, he does not expressly couch them\n\nin terms of ineffective assistance of counsel. Rather, he raises direct issues of trial court\n\nerror or prosecutorial misconduct, which he claims the PCRA court erred in dismissing.\n\nAs noted above, the PCRA court deemed many of Appellant\u2019s PCRA issues either\n\npreviously litigated or waived. PCRA Ct. Op., 1/31/17, at 3-4, 6, 7. Additionally, the\n\nCommonwealth argues all of Appellant\u2019s allegations of trial court error and prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct are ineligible for relief under the PCRA as being either waived or previously\n\nlitigated. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 11-20.\n\n       Anticipating the issue, Appellant includes a section in his brief entitled \u201cStatement\n\nRelating to Waiver and Previous Litigation,\u201d which incorporates his issue XI. Appellant\u2019s\n\nBrief at 5. In this regard, Appellant advances a blended argument that standby direct\n\nappeal counsel was ineffective and that he interfered with Appellant\u2019s right of self-\n\nrepresentation. \u201cIn addition to usurping [Appellant\u2019s] right to self-representation, [standby\n\ncounsel] was ineffective for failing to set forth the numerous meritorious issues set forth\n\nin this brief.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 96. Specifically, Appellant argues that his standby\n\ncounsel acted without his authorization when counsel filed a brief with this Court that\n\nomitted the issues for which Appellant now seeks redress through the PCRA.6 Appellant\n\n6 Appellant cites Commonwealth v. Ellis, 626 A.2d 1137 (Pa. 1993) and Commonwealth\nv. Rogers, 645 A.2d 223 (Pa 1994) in support of his contention that his right to self-\nrepresentation was violated. While these cases recognize a defendant\u2019s right to choose\nto represent him or herself, they address limitations on hybrid representation by\ndefendants who are represented by counsel on appeal.\n              A represented appellant may petition to terminate his\n              representation; he may, acting pursuant to the rules of\n              criminal procedure, proceed on his own behalf. Conversely,\n\n\n\n                                      [J-30-2018] - 8\n\fcontends the PCRA court\u2019s conclusion that Appellant acquiesced to a collaborative\n\nrelationship with standby counsel, allowing counsel to draft documents, is not borne out\n\nby the record. He asserts he communicated with standby counsel only by letter and he\n\nhad sent standby counsel various drafts of issues to be included in the brief. He asserts\n\nstandby counsel improperly asserted control over the appeal, editing the issues to be\n\npursued in the appeal, and filing the brief without first securing Appellant\u2019s approval or\n\nsignature. These circumstances, according to Appellant, demonstrate that his right to\n\nself-representation was interfered with and, as a consequence, the issues he now\n\npursues cannot be deemed waived or previously litigated.              For the various reasons\n\ndiscussed below, we disagree and conclude the PCRA court did not err in dismissing\n\nthese claims.\n\n       The PCRA court determined, \u201cbased on the testimony [Appellant] acquiesced to\n\nthe collaborative role with standby counsel and had counsel write his brief. [Appellant]\n\naccepted assistance of counsel, waiving his right to present a pro se brief on appeal, and\n\nthus, such claim is rejected.\u201d PCRA Ct. Op, 1/31/17, at 8. The Commonwealth equates\n\nAppellant\u2019s argument to an impermissible assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nby a pro se defendant. Commonwealth Brief at 17 (citing Commonwealth v. Fletcher,\n\n986, A.2d 759, 778 (Pa. 2009) (holding, in exercising one\u2019s right to self-representation, [a\n\n\n                he may elect to allow counsel to take his appeal, but, should\n                counsel not prevail, assert counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness at a later\n                time and, thus indirectly, assert the claims he would have\n                made on direct appeal. The only thing he may not do is\n                confuse and overburden the court by his own pro se filings of\n                briefs at the same time his counsel is filing briefs on his behalf.\n\nEllis, 626 A.2d at 1141. In Rogers, this Court held that a represented defendant does not\nhave the right to terminate counsel\u2019s representation after counsel has filed an appellate\nbrief, merely because the defendant wishes to file a substitute pro se brief. Rogers, 645\nA.2d at 224. It is not contested that Appellant in this case was acting pro se from the\ncommencement of his direct appeal.\n\n\n                                         [J-30-2018] - 9\n\fdefendant] relinquishes many . . . benefits . . ., including the future right to allege\n\nineffectiveness of counsel\u201d)).    The Commonwealth asserts this conclusion is not\n\ndiminished simply because standby counsel may have taken an active role. Id. at 20,\n\nn.3.\n\n       To the extent Appellant is asserting ineffective assistance of standby counsel, we\n\nnote the law is clear that he may not do so.\n\n             When a defendant elects to proceed at trial pro se, the\n             defendant\u2014and not standby counsel\u2014is in fact counsel of\n             record and is responsible for trying the case. This\n             understanding of the limited role of standby counsel is\n             essential to satisfy the United States Supreme Court\u2019s\n             directive that a defendant\u2019s choice to proceed pro se \u201cmust be\n             honored out of \u2018that respect for the individual which is the\n             lifeblood of the law\u2019\u201d even when the defendant acts to his or\n             her own detriment. [Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 834\n             (1975)]. This understanding also underlies our prior holding\n             that a defendant who chooses to represent himself cannot\n             obtain relief by raising a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel or\n             standby counsel.\nCommonwealth v. Spotz, 47 A.3d 63, 83 (Pa. 2012) (some citations omitted).\n\n       On the other hand, to the extent Appellant claims standby counsel interfered with\n\nhis right of self-representation, he is asserting an issue about the proper scope of the\n\nstandby counsel\u2019s role and the court\u2019s role in assuring it does not supplant a defendant\u2019s\n\nchoice of self-representation.     The United States Supreme Court recognized a\n\ndefendant\u2019s right to self-representation in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975).\n\nSubsequently, the Court, in McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168 (1984), reviewed the\n\neffect participation by standby counsel may have on that right. Therein, the Court noted\n\nthat Faretta did not impose an \u201cabsolute bar on standby counsel\u2019s unsolicited\n\nparticipation.\u201d McKaskle, 465 U.S. at 176. The Court described two interests served by\n\nlimitation of standby counsel\u2019s independent action. The first concerned a defendant\u2019s\n\nright to preserve control over the case he or she wishes to present. Id. at 178. The\n\n\n                                    [J-30-2018] - 10\n\fsecond concerned the perception of the jury regarding a defendant\u2019s self-representation.\n\nId. In the appeal context, therefore, only the first interest is implicated.\n\n               Faretta rights are adequately vindicated in proceedings\n               outside the presence of the jury if the pro se defendant is\n               allowed to address the court freely on his own behalf and if\n               disagreements between counsel and the pro se defendant are\n               resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor whenever the matter is one\n               that would normally be left to the discretion of counsel.\nId. at 179.7\n\n       As mentioned, the PCRA court determined that Appellant acquiesced to standby\n\ncounsel\u2019s collaborative role during his appeal. Contrary to Appellant\u2019s assertion, we\n\nconclude the record supports this finding. Petitioner concedes that he sent potential\n\nissues to counsel to review for inclusion in his Appellate brief. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 93.\n\n\n7 We recognize that the United States Supreme Court has held that the right of self-\nrepresentation stems from the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which\naddresses trial rights, and, as such, there is no Federal Constitutional right to self-\nrepresentation in connection with the statutory right to appeal.\n               [W]e conclude that neither the holding nor the reasoning in\n               Faretta requires California to recognize a constitutional right\n               to self-representation on direct appeal from a criminal\n               conviction. Our holding is, of course, narrow. It does not\n               preclude the States from recognizing such a right under their\n               own constitutions.\n\nMartinez v. California, 528 U.S. 152, 163 (2000). We have acknowledged Martinez\u2019s\nholding, but have not directly addressed whether there exists a right to self-representation\non direct appeal under the Pennsylvania Constitution. See Commonwealth v. Davido,\n868 A.2d 431, 444 (Pa. 2005) (acknowledging Martinez and holding the right to self-\nrepresentation includes the penalty phase in a capital case); Commonwealth v. Staton,\n12 A.3d 277, 282 (Pa. 2010) (acknowledging Martinez, but resolving the issue on other\ngrounds while assuming, without determining, such a right exists). In the instant case,\nneither the parties nor the PCRA court have addressed the issue of a state constitutional\nright to self-representation on appeal. However, the record of Appellant\u2019s direct appeal\nevidences his pro se status was recognized. Therefore, as in Staton, we will assume for\nargument\u2019s sake that Appellant\u2019s right to self-representation extended to his direct appeal\nin this case and resolve the issue on other grounds.\n\n\n\n                                       [J-30-2018] - 11\n\fThe record of Appellant\u2019s direct appeal with this Court demonstrates that Appellant\n\ndeferred to standby counsel to file numerous remand requests and motions for extension\n\nto file a brief. Thus, the record supports the PCRA court\u2019s conclusion that Appellant\n\napproved of standby counsel\u2019s collaborative assistance in drafting and submitting filings\n\nwith this Court during his direct appeal. The fact that Appellant objected to the failure to\n\ninclude various issues in the appellate brief subsequently submitted, does not mean that\n\nstandby counsel usurped or unduly interfered with Appellant\u2019s right of self-representation.\n\nMcKaskle, 465 U.S. at 187. Appellant\u2019s complaint is not with the fact standby counsel\n\ndrafted the appellate brief, but with the manner in which he drafted the brief. This\n\nimplicates the issue of counsel\u2019s effectiveness, which, as noted above, is not an issue\n\nAppellant can pursue in his PCRA petition. Spotz, 47 A.3d at 83. It also runs afoul of the\n\ngeneral prohibition against hybrid representation. Ellis, 626 A.2d at 1141.\n\n       Furthermore, and more significantly, Appellant raised these identical arguments\n\nwith this Court during his direct appeal. In two motions following the filing of his appellate\n\nbrief, Appellant alleged standby counsel acted without authority in excluding the subject\n\nissues from his appellate brief, thus interfering with his right of self-representation.\n\nAppellant sought leave to file a new pro se Appellate brief or amended brief, adding the\n\nomitted issues. Significantly, Appellant did not at the time disavow the eighteen issues\n\ncontained in the original brief. As recited above, this Court denied both motions and\n\naffirmed Appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence.8 Appellant appealed that decision, but the\n\n\n\n8  Justice Wecht, in his Concurring Opinion, suggests we mistakenly characterize\nSilverman\u2019s status as continuing to be that of standby counsel after this Court denied\nAppellant\u2019s motions for special relief during his direct appeal. Justice Wecht maintains\nthat our denial of those motions \u201cnecessarily presumed Williams\u2019 acquiescence to\nSilverman\u2019s full representation.\u201d Conc. Op. at 5. However, the orders denying Appellant\u2019s\napplications contain no explanation for the rulings, and furthermore, our docket for the\n\n\n\n                                      [J-30-2018] - 12\n\fUnited States Supreme Court denied certiorari. Accordingly, the argument Appellant\n\nadvances has already been adjudicated. Appellant may not resurrect the issue in the\n\nguise of a PCRA petition. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(3).9 Accordingly, we discern no error or\n\nabuse of discretion by the PCRA court in dismissing Appellant\u2019s PCRA issues as\n\npreviously litigated or waived.10\n\n                          V. Allegations of PCRA Court Error\n\n       In his issue XII, Appellant claims the Commonwealth interfered with his right to a\n\nfull and fair PCRA proceeding by intimidating and interfering with two of his witnesses.\n\nAppellant avers that the Commonwealth caused Waldemar Cortez to withdraw a previous\n\nstatement he had made against then ADA Dantos, and that Dantos conspired with Louis\n\n\n\ndirect appeal continues to reflect Appellant\u2019s representation status as pro se with\nSilverman as standby counsel. See 357 CAP (docket).\n9Appellant does not articulate an alternative basis for consideration of his allegations of\nprosecutorial misconduct based on after discovered evidence, or through discovery\nduring the PCRA proceedings.\n              [T]o prevail on an after-discovered evidence claim for relief\n              under subsection 9543(a)(2)(vi), a petitioner must prove that\n              (1) the exculpatory evidence has been discovered after trial\n              and could not have been obtained at or prior to trial through\n              reasonable diligence; (2) the evidence is not cumulative; (3) it\n              is not being used solely to impeach credibility; and (4) it would\n              likely compel a different verdict.\n\nCommonwealth v. Burton, 158 A.3d 618, 629 (Pa. 2017). Absent a developed argument\ndemonstrating compliance with that burden, we deem such issue waived.\nCommonwealth v. D'Amato, 856 A.2d 806, 814, (Pa. 2004).\n10 Appellant\u2019s issues I through X correspond, as he asserts, with the issues he tried to\nraise through his June 4, 2003 and June 27, 2005 motions. The Commonwealth points\nout, however, that as argued, Appellant\u2019s issues also overlap with issues he properly\nraised and litigated on appeal. See Commonwealth Brief at 16, PCRA Ct. Op., 1/31/17,\nat 3-4. It is the extent such issues overlap that we deem previously litigated. The issues\nrepresentative of the issues delineated by Appellant in his June 4, 2003 and June 27,\n2005 motions are waived. See Pa.C.S. \u00a79544.\n\n\n                                      [J-30-2018] - 13\n\fWashington to the effect that Washington refused to answer questions about\n\ncorrespondence he had maintained with Dantos.             Appellant\u2019s Brief at 98-100. The\n\nCommonwealth responds that Appellant is merely dissatisfied with the information\n\nprovided by his own witnesses during the PCRA hearings, which were conducted over\n\nnumerous days of testimony spanning more than sixteen months. The Commonwealth\n\nasserts Appellant\u2019s characterization of a \u201cgrand conspiracy\u201d is the result of pure\n\nspeculation unsupported by the record. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 99-100. We agree.\n\nAppellant merely references the testimony of the witnesses which demonstrates their\n\nreluctance to testify and their fear of consequences if they testified falsely. We find no\n\nbasis in the record to disturb the PCRA court\u2019s finding that Appellant\u2019s claim that his due\n\nprocess rights were violated is meritless. See PCRA Ct. Op, 1/31/17, at 8.\n\n       Relatedly, Appellant claims in his issue XIII, that the PCRA court erred in failing to\n\nrule on his June 19, 2015 motion to amend his PCRA petition to conform to evidence\n\nadduced at the PCRA hearing. Appellant identifies two items he wished to include in the\n\namendment. The first consisted of averments relative to the purported interference of the\n\nCommonwealth with his PCRA witnesses as discussed above. The second was an\n\nallegation that the trial court interfered with his right to remain silent (Appellant\u2019s issue V,\n\nsupra). Appellant notes that the PCRA court addressed the issue in its PCRA opinion,\n\nfinding the trial court\u2019s comment admonishing Appellant not to testify during his closing\n\nargument to the jury was proper and did not infringe on Appellant\u2019s right to remain silent.\n\nSee PCRA Ct. Op., 1/31/17, at 9. We discern no error. Relative to the first proposed\n\namendment, we note the averments do not constitute a PCRA claim.                   Appellant\u2019s\n\nconcerns about the Commonwealth\u2019s actions during the PCRA proceedings needed to\n\nbe raised before the PCRA court by objection, motion or argument, but do not constitute\n\nan additional PCRA claim requiring amendment of the PCRA petition. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-30-2018] - 14\n\f9543(a).   Relative to the second proposed amendment, we note the PCRA court\n\naddressed the issue, implying it accepted the amended claim. Furthermore, the claim is\n\nnot derived from evidence adduced during the PCRA hearing to which it can conform.\n\nNevertheless, for the reasons outlined above, we conclude the issue had been waived.\n\nAppellant did not raise the issue before the trial court and presents no reason for failing\n\nto do so. Accordingly, Appellant is due no relief based on the PCRA court failing to\n\nexpressly grant his motion to amend.\n\n       Finally, Appellant avers he is entitled to relief based on the cumulative effect of the\n\nerrors alleged. \u201cA bald averment of cumulative prejudice does not constitute a claim.\u201d\n\nSpotz, 47 A.3d 63 at 129 (quoting Commonwealth v. Hutchinson, 611 Pa. 280, 25 A.3d\n\n277, 319 (2011)). \u201c[N]o number of claims that have been denied because of lack of merit\n\ncan collectively warrant relief.\u201d Commonwealth v. Bardo, 105 A.3d 678, 717 (Pa. 2014).\n\nBecause Appellant has not presented a meritorious issue eligible for relief under the\n\nPCRA, it follows that no relief is due under a claim of cumulative prejudice.\n\n                                      VI. Conclusion\n\n       Based upon the foregoing, we affirm the order of the PCRA court dismissing\n\nAppellant\u2019s PCRA petition.11\n\n\nChief Justice Saylor and Justices Baer and Donohue join the opinion.\n\nJustice Wecht files a concurring opinion in which Justice Todd joins.\n\nJustice Dougherty concurs in the result.\n\n\n\n\n11 In accordance with 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(i), the Prothonotary of the Supreme Court is\ndirected to transmit the complete record of this case to the Governor.\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-30-2018] - 15\n\f",
