In appeals\n                    from postconviction proceedings, an appellate court reviews de novo a\n                    determination that the defendant failed to allege sufficient facts to dem-\n                    onstrate a violation of his or her constitutional rights or that the record\n                    and files affirmatively show that the defendant is entitled to no relief.\n               \u20022.\t Postconviction: Appeal and Error. Whether a claim raised in a post-\n                    conviction proceeding is procedurally barred is a question of law. When\n                    reviewing a question of law, an appellate court resolves the question\n                    independently of the lower court\u2019s conclusion.\n               \u20023.\tPostconviction: Constitutional Law. An evidentiary hearing on a\n                    motion for postconviction relief must be granted when the motion\n                    contains factual allegations which, if proved, constitute an infringe-\n                    ment of the movant\u2019s rights under the Nebraska or federal Constitution.\n                    However, if the motion alleges only conclusions of fact or law, or the\n                    records and files in the case affirmatively show that the movant is\n                    entitled to no relief, no evidentiary hearing is required.\n               \u20024.\t ____: ____.

His arguments are premised on the\nconstitutionality of \u00a7 28-1212.04, which at the time of his\ncrime prohibited\n          [a]ny person, within the territorial boundaries of any\n       city, incorporated village, or county containing a city of\n       the metropolitan class or primary class [from] unlawfully,\n       knowingly, and intentionally or recklessly discharg[ing] a\n       firearm, while in or in the proximity of any motor vehicle\n       that such person has just exited, at or in the general direc-\n       tion of any person, dwelling, building, structure, [or]\n       occupied motor vehicle . . . .\nViolation of \u00a7 28-1212.04 is a Class IC felony.\n   Ross\u2019 trial counsel did not move to quash the information\ncharging a violation of \u00a7 28-1212.04 and did not raise any\nargument that the statute was unconstitutional. After a jury\ntrial, Ross was convicted of violating \u00a7 28-1212.04, as well as\nother felonies. Ross appealed his convictions, asserting that the\nevidence was insufficient. He was represented on appeal by the\nsame counsel, who did not raise any issue regarding the consti-\ntutionality of \u00a7 28-1212.04.\n   After his convictions and sentences were affirmed on appeal,\nRoss moved for postconviction relief. As relevant to this\nappeal, Ross alleged that \u00a7 28-1212.04 is both facially uncon-\nstitutional and unconstitutional as applied to him, based on\ntheories of special legislation and equal protection.

III, \u00a7 18, because it criminalizes behav-\nior in certain geographic areas but not in others. He alleged\n\u00a7 28-1212.04 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S.\nand Nebraska Constitutions for essentially the same reason,\nand because the areas of enforcement resulted in the statute\u2019s\nbeing disproportionately applied against African-Americans\nand other minorities.\n   Ross also alleged he received ineffective assistance of trial\nand appellate counsel because counsel failed to \u201cinvestigate,\nallege, research, present, argue, and thereby preserve\u201d the\nconstitutional claims. Ross alleged he was prejudiced by his\ntrial counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion to quash because either\nthe district court would have granted the motion based on the\nunconstitutionality of \u00a7 28-1212.04 or the constitutional issues\nwould have been preserved for appeal and the appellate court\nwould have found \u00a7 28-1212.04 unconstitutional.\n   The district court denied postconviction relief without con-\nducting an evidentiary hearing. It found Ross\u2019 direct chal-\nlenges to the constitutionality of \u00a7 28-1212.04 were procedur-\nally barred because those challenges could have been raised at\ntrial or on direct appeal. And, relying on State v. Sanders,3 it\nfound Ross\u2019 counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise or\npreserve constitutional challenges to \u00a7 28-1212.04. In Sanders,\nwe expressly held trial counsel was not ineffective for failing\nto raise a constitutional challenge to \u00a7 28-1212.04, because\ncounsel cannot perform in a deficient manner by failing to\nraise novel legal arguments or assert changes to existing law.\nRoss filed this timely appeal.\n                 ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Ross assigns, restated and consolidated, that the district\ncourt erred in (1) denying an evidentiary hearing on his allega-\ntion that \u00a7 28-1212.04 is facially unconstitutional, in violation\n\n\u20023\t\n      State v.

We conclude the district court properly found\nthese allegations were procedurally barred, because they could\nhave been raised at trial or on direct appeal. Postconviction\nrelief is a very narrow category of relief available only to rem-\nedy prejudicial constitutional violations.8 A motion for postcon-\nviction relief cannot be used to secure review of issues which\nwere or could have been litigated on direct appeal.9 We there-\nfore affirm the denial of postconviction relief as to the direct\nconstitutional challenges.\n\n                 Counsel Was Not Ineffective\n    [6] Although a motion for postconviction relief cannot be\nused to secure review of issues which were or could have been\nlitigated on direct appeal, when a defendant was represented\nboth at trial and on direct appeal by the same lawyer, the\ndefendant\u2019s first opportunity to assert ineffective assistance of\ncounsel is in a motion for postconviction relief.10 Ross\u2019 ineffec-\ntive assistance of counsel claim is properly before us.\n    [7,8] To establish a right to postconviction relief based on\na claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant has\n\n\u20027\t\n      State v.

Washington\nframework, a court may address the two elements, deficient\nperformance and prejudice, in either order.14\n   Ross makes a novel argument in this regard based on Hall v.\nState.15 In Hall, the defendant, after being convicted of second\ndegree murder, attempted to challenge the constitutionality of\nthe Nebraska homicide statutes via declaratory judgment. We\nheld the procedure was improper because declaratory judgment\ndoes not lie where another equally serviceable remedy is avail-\nable. We stated:\n      This [constitutional] issue could have been raised by\n      conventional forms of remedy within the criminal pros-\n      ecution. In a criminal prosecution, a defendant can bring\n      a constitutional challenge to the facial validity of the stat-\n      ute under which he or she is charged by filing a motion\n      to quash or a demurrer. . . . In the event the defendant\u2019s\n      counsel fails to make such a challenge, the defendant can\n      allege ineffective assistance of counsel either on direct\n      appeal or in an action for postconviction relief.16\n   Ross argues that this language from Hall established a rule\nthat any time counsel fails to file a motion to quash challeng-\ning the constitutionality of a statute, a defendant has a valid\n\n11\t\n      Strickland v.

Hall simply recognized the proper proce-\ndure for raising a constitutional claim within a criminal pros-\necution\u2014it spoke to the procedure for alleging such claims. It\ndid not, as Ross suggests, presume the validity of such claims.\nWhenever a claim of ineffective assistance is raised, a court\nmust analyze whether the defendant has sufficiently alleged\ndeficient performance resulting in prejudice.17\n   We focus here on whether Ross has sufficiently alleged that\nhis trial and appellate counsel performed deficiently. Ross\u2019\npostconviction motion alleged his counsel was deficient for\nfailing to raise a constitutional challenge to \u00a7 28-1212.04.\n   [9] We addressed a nearly identical postconviction claim\nin State v. Sanders.18 There, we held that trial counsel did not\nperform in a deficient manner when he failed to raise a con-\nstitutional challenge to \u00a7 28-1212.04. We reasoned \u201ccounsel\u2019s\nfailure to raise novel legal theories or arguments or to make\nnovel constitutional challenges in order to bring a change in\nexisting law does not constitute deficient performance.\u201d19\n   That same rationale applies to this case. Ross was tried in\n2010, and his direct appeal was decided in 2012. At that time,\nno appellate court had been presented with a constitutional\nchallenge to \u00a7 28-1212.04. We decided Sanders 2 years later.\nGiven our holding in Sanders that counsel\u2019s failure to raise a\nnovel constitutional challenge to \u00a7 28-1212.04 did not consti-\ntute deficient performance, we fail to see how Ross\u2019 trial coun-\nsel could be found deficient for not asserting such a challenge\neven earlier.\n   [10] \u201c\u2018The Constitution guarantees criminal defendants only\na fair trial and a competent attorney.

ROSS\n                               Cite as 296 Neb. 923\n\nconstitutional claim.\u2019\u201d20 Ross\u2019 postconviction motion did not\ncontain factual allegations which would constitute deficient\nperformance under Strickland v. Washington. No evidentiary\nhearing was required.21\n                         CONCLUSION\n   For the foregoing reasons, we find Ross\u2019 direct challenges to\nthe constitutionality of \u00a7 28-1212.04 are procedurally barred.\nAnd we conclude his ineffective assistance of counsel claim\ndoes not entitle him to an evidentiary hearing, because the\nallegations cannot support a finding of deficient performance.\nWe affirm the denial of postconviction relief.\n                                                    A ffirmed.\n\n20\t\n      Id. at 342, 855 N.W.2d at 356, quoting Engle v.
