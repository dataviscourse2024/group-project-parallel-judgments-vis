Easley, Attorney\nGeneral of North Carolina, NORTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT\nOF JUSTICE, Raleigh, North Carolina, for Appellant.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nERVIN, Circuit Judge:\n\nJohn Thomas Noland filed a petition seeking a writ of habeas cor-\npus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1994). The district court granted\nNoland's petition with regard to his sentence, ordering the State of\nNorth Carolina to conduct a new sentencing hearing. It ruled that the\njury was improperly instructed at the sentencing phase of Noland's\ntrial as to its consideration of mitigating circumstances, in violation\nof McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433 (1990). The district court\nrejected all of Noland's other claims for relief. The state appeals the\nissuance of the writ as to Noland's sentence and Noland cross-appeals\non four issues rejected by the district court that involve both the guilt-\ninnocence and penalty phases of his trial. Because we believe the dis-\ntrict court wrongly decided the McKoy issue, the writ should have\nbeen denied and we therefore reverse in part and affirm in part.\n\nI.\n\nNoland and Susan Milton Noland were married for nine years prior\nto their separation on March 3, 1981. The couple had two daughters\nand resided in Charlotte, North Carolina for the last eight years of\ntheir marriage. In the weeks immediately after their separation,\nNoland visited Susan and his daughters at least once a week and\ntalked on the phone with them frequently. Noland constantly begged\nSusan to return to him. Later, he began making threats regarding their\nproperty.\n\n                     2\n\fDuring this time, Noland's parents arranged for him to receive psy-\nchiatric treatment. A staff psychiatrist at the Mecklenburg Mental\nHealth Center, Dr. Reback, evaluated Noland in April 1981 and rec-\nommended partial hospitalization at the Center. By May 1981, Dr.\nReback was of the opinion that Noland was mentally ill and danger-\nous, and needed full, in-patient hospitalization. On May 21, 1981, a\nNorth Carolina state court ordered Noland committed to a state hospi-\ntal, finding him to be \"mentally ill and dangerous to himself\" by clear\nand convincing evidence. The record does not indicate when Noland\nwas released from the hospital.\n\nIn June 1981, Susan moved with the children to California to live\nwith her older sister. She informed Noland by letter where she and the\nchildren were living. For the next several months, Noland maintained\nongoing telephone contact with them. After approximately four\nmonths, Susan and the children moved again but did not give Noland\nthe new address or phone number. She maintained periodic contact\nwith Noland through her sister's telephone.\n\nEvery time Susan and Noland talked by phone, he asked her when\nshe was coming back to Charlotte. She always replied that she did not\nknow. In November 1981, Noland began making threats against\nSusan's family. Noland told her that he would kill her father, mother,\nand sister if she did not return to Charlotte with the children before\nChristmas. He said, \"I'm going to kill Cindy[Susan's sister] first\nbecause she means more to you than anything. I'm going to kill your\ndaddy and make your momma watch.\" Noland further specified that\nhe would place a \"gun between your daddy's eyes and blow his head\noff.\" Susan and the children did not return to Charlotte.\n\nOn February 5, 1982, Noland telephoned Susan and told her that\nhe would kill her family if she did not return to Charlotte within two\nweeks. The following day, Noland called again and demanded her\ndecision immediately. When Susan answered that she did not want to\ntake the children out of school, Noland responded,\"Well, you will\ncome back; you'll have to come back, because I am going to kill your\nfamily.\"\n\nOn the evening of February 21, 1982, Cindy Milton (Susan's sis-\nter), was watching television with two friends in the living room of\n\n                    3\n\fher home in Charlotte. This house was the same one that had previ-\nously been occupied by Noland and Susan. Noland entered the house\nthrough the back door and chased Cindy into the laundry room yell-\ning, \"I told you not to get involved.\" As Cindy huddled behind the\nlaundry room door, Noland shot Cindy in the back of the head, killing\nher.\n\nDirectly across a vacant lot from Cindy's house lived her parents,\nMary and Troy Milton. Noland left Cindy's house and walked across\nthe street to her parents' home. Noland entered a bedroom and shot\nTroy Milton in the face while he slept, killing him. Noland pushed the\ndoor to a second bedroom open and told Mary Milton,\"I told you I\nwas going to kill all three of you. And, I've already killed Cindy and\nyour old man. I'm going to get you.\" Mary lunged at Noland with a\nbar stool as he shot her at pointblank range, inflicting a nonlethal\nwound. She fell to the floor and remained very still. After Noland left,\nMary phoned Cindy's house and discovered from her guests that\nCindy had been shot; Mary then called the Charlotte Police Depart-\nment.\n\nCharlotte police officers found Noland within one hour after the\nshootings. He was taken to the police department and properly\nadvised of his Miranda rights. Noland invoked his right to have an\nattorney present during any further questioning by the officers. Later\nthat night, Noland made the following unsolicited and voluntary com-\nment to a police officer: \"Man, I just killed two people, man. Why are\nyou being so nice to me?\"\n\nIn October 1982, a jury found Noland guilty of first degree murder\nin the deaths of Cindy and Troy Milton. The jury also returned sen-\ntences of death for both murders. The judgments were affirmed by the\nNorth Carolina Supreme Court. State v. Noland , 320 S.E.2d 642 (N.C.\n1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1230 (1985). Noland sought state collat-\neral relief by filing a motion for appropriate relief in Mecklenburg\nCounty Superior Court. Following an evidentiary hearing, the court\ndenied relief. Noland's petition for a writ of certiorari to the North\nCarolina Supreme Court was denied. State v. Noland, 361 S.E.2d 85\n(N.C. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 943 (1988).\n\nIn August 1988, Noland filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus\nin the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina.\n\n                    4\n\fThe district court conditionally granted the writ as to both convictions\nand sentences. Noland v. Dixon, 831 F. Supp. 490 (W.D.N.C. 1993).\nWe vacated this judgment on the ground that the district court erred\nin not allowing the state to amend its pleadings to raise Teague as an\naffirmative defense to all of Noland's claims. Noland v. Dixon, 53\nF.3d 328, 1995 WL 253149 (4th Cir. May 1, 1995) (unpublished\nopinion). We remanded the case to the district court with instructions\n\"to allow the state to amend its answer to raise Teague as an affirma-\ntive defense to all of Noland's claims, and address the claims raised\nby Noland in his petition on a clean slate.\" Id. at *3.\n\nOn remand, the district court ruled on nine issues, five of which are\nrelevant to this appeal. First, the district court ruled in favor of Noland\non his claim that the jury instructions in the sentencing phase\nimpaired the jury's ability to consider mitigating factors in violation\nof McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433 (1990). On four other\nclaims, the district court denied Noland's petition: 1) that the jury\ninstructions on insanity violated due process by relieving the State of\nits burden to prove the element of mens rea for murder beyond a rea-\nsonable doubt; 2) that the State used evidence of Noland's invocation\nof his Miranda rights to rebut his defense of insanity; 3) that Noland's\ncounsel was ineffective at both the guilt-innocence and penalty phases\nof his trial; and 4) that Noland was incompetent to stand trial. On the\nbasis of the McKoy violation, the district court issued the writ as to\nNoland's sentence, ordering the State to resentence him. The parties\ncross-appeal the district court's decisions on these five issues and we\nconsider them seriatim.\n\nII.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, we must address the State's argument\nregarding the appropriate standard of review for this case. The\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"),\n110 Stat. 1214, was signed into law on April 24, 1996 and amended\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 to change the standard by which we review the\nhabeas petition of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\nstate court. Under pre-AEDPA law, we review a state court's determi-\nnations of questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact de\nnovo. Howard v. Moore, No. 95-4017, slip op. at 8 (4th Cir. Dec. 9,\n1997) (en banc); Savino v. Murray, 82 F.3d 593, 598 (4th Cir. 1996),\n\n                     5\n\fcert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1. Under \u00a7 2254 as amended by the AEDPA,\nthe reviewing court cannot grant the writ unless the state court adjudi-\ncation \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as deter-\nmined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 110 Stat. 1214,\n1219, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) (West Supp. 1997). The parties\nbriefed the issue of whether this new standard of review should be\nretroactively applied to petitions pending in the federal courts prior to\npassage of the AEDPA.\n\nAfter the parties filed their briefs, the Supreme Court decided\nLindh v. Murphy, 117 S. Ct. 2059 (1997), holding that the amend-\nments to Chapter 153 of Title 28, of which the new standard of review\nis a part, should not be applied to cases pending at the time the\nAEDPA took effect. At oral argument in the instant case, counsel for\nthe State did not waive its argument that the new standard of review\nshould apply, distinguishing Lindh as a non-capital case. Nothing in\nLindh supports such an argument and this court has already held that\nLindh requires us to use the pre-AEDPA standard of review in a capi-\ntal case pending in federal court at the time the AEDPA was signed\ninto law. See Howard, slip op. at 2-3. We therefore review questions\nof law and mixed questions of law and fact de novo. Any factual find-\nings by the State court are presumed to be correct as long as they were\nmade after a full, fair, and adequate hearing on the merits. See 28\nU.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d) (West 1994) (pre-AEDPA).\n\nIII.\n\nIn McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433 (1990), the Supreme\nCourt struck down the North Carolina practice that required a capital\nsentencing jury to find mitigating circumstances unanimously before\nthey could be considered for the purpose of sentencing. The Court\nheld that the unanimity requirement limited the individual juror's con-\nsideration of mitigating circumstances and was therefore unconstitu-\ntional. Noland claims, and the district court held, that the sentencing\ninstructions at Noland's trial constituted McKoy error. In determining\nwhether the jury instructions violated McKoy in Noland's trial, the\nquestion is \"whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has\napplied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consider-\n\n                     6\n\fation of constitutionally relevant evidence.\" Boyde v. California, 494\nU.S. 370, 380 (1990).\n\nIn this case, the trial court did not give the explicit unanimity\ninstruction on mitigating circumstances that was struck down by the\nCourt in McKoy. The judge instructed the jury to answer four issues\nin reaching its decision at the penalty phase: 1) whether the jury unan-\nimously found, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of the aggra-\nvating circumstance; 2) whether the jury unanimously found, beyond\na reasonable doubt, that the aggravating circumstance was sufficiently\nsubstantial to call for imposition of the death penalty; 3) whether the\njury found one or more mitigating circumstances; and 4) whether the\njury unanimously found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the aggra-\nvating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. This\nportion of the instructions has been held on several occasions by this\ncourt not to violate McKoy. See Smith v. Dixon, 14 F.3d 956, 981 n.15\n(4th Cir. 1994) (en banc); Lawson v. Dixon, 3 F.3d 743, 754 (4th Cir.\n1993); Maynard v. Dixon, 943 F.2d 407, 418-20 (4th Cir. 1991).\n\nIn addition to the proper instructions, however, the trial court also\ngave a general unanimity instruction. The instruction was \"general\"\nin the sense that it was not directed to any particular issue or question\nto be decided by the jury on its verdict form. Just before releasing the\njury to begin its deliberations at the penalty phase, the trial court\ninstructed the jury: \"After you have reached a unanimous decision as\nto each issue . . . have your Foreman mark the appropriate place or\nplaces on the issues and recommendations forms.\" J.A. at 1542\n(emphasis added). Noland argues that this comment by the trial court\ncreated a reasonable likelihood that the jury believed that it must have\nfound any mitigating circumstances unanimously. We disagree.\n\nThe trial court's \"general unanimity\" comment did not occur during\nits careful explanation of the verdict form, but rather as a supplemen-\ntal instruction just before the jurors retired to deliberate. The trial\ncourt's remark could not reasonably have been understood as a sub-\nstantive instruction of law since it came after the explanation of the\nspecific and detailed instructions contained on the verdict form. Prior\nto the general unanimity instruction, the judge read and explained the\nfour issues on the verdict form while each juror followed along with\nhis or her own written copy of the form. It was entirely clear from this\n\n                     7\n\fportion of the instructions that three of the four issues on the verdict\nform required juror unanimity while one, the mitigating factor ques-\ntion, did not. The judge's final comment did not create a reasonable\nprobability that the jury would have disregarded the previous clear\nand precise instructions of the trial court. When read in its proper con-\ntext, the trial court was merely describing the procedure by which the\njury foreman was to record the verdict, and not giving a substantive\ninstruction on the unanimity requirement.\n\nNoland argues that the North Carolina Supreme Court's decision in\nState v. McNeil, 395 S.E.2d 106 (N.C. 1990), supports the finding of\na McKoy violation. In McNeil, the court ruled that general references\nto jury unanimity could constitute a McKoy violation, even when the\ncourt's explicit instructions on mitigating circumstances did not\nrequire unanimity. In McNeil, while the verdict form and accompany-\ning instructions contained no express unanimity requirement as to\nmitigating factors, the trial court made three general references that\nthe verdict required unanimity. See id. at 109 (\"[T]he trial court stated\nat least three times that the jury's answer to all the issues must be\nunanimous.\"). The distinction between McNeil and the instant case is\nobvious. While three general references to unanimity, which contra-\ndict the verdict form's silence on unanimity as to mitigating factors,\nmight create a reasonable probability that the jury would assume it\nneeded to find mitigating circumstances unanimously, one such refer-\nence in the present context does not.\n\nThe explicit substantive instructions and the verdict form made it\nclear that the jury need not have been unanimous in its determination\nof mitigating circumstances. The trial court's unanimity comment\nduring its description of how the foreman was to fill out the verdict\nform does not rise to the level of a McKoy violation, and the district\ncourt erred in so holding. Because we find that the judge's comment\nregarding unanimity does not constitute error under McKoy, we have\nno reason to consider the other questions regarding this issue, which\nwere briefed by the parties in considerable detail.\n\nIV.\n\nIn his cross-appeal, Noland argues that the district court erred in\nfour of its rulings on his habeas petition. We find no merit in\nNoland's arguments.\n\n                     8\n\fA.\n\nFirst, Noland argues that the judge's instructions at the guilt-\ninnocence phase prevented the jury from considering evidence of\nNoland's mental illness in determining whether he possessed the\nproper intent for first-degree murder. A jury in North Carolina may\nconsider evidence of mental illness, not only in its decision on the\naffirmative defense of insanity, but also on the essential element of\nmens rea. \"Under North Carolina law, the existence of mental illness\ncan negate the possibility of intent, deliberation, and premeditation.\"\nCooper v. North Carolina, 702 F.2d 481, 484 (4th Cir. 1983). During\njury instructions in the guilt-innocence phase of Noland's trial, the\njudge informed the jurors that they must find all the essential ele-\nments of murder before considering Noland's proffered affirmative\ndefense of insanity.\n\n           You will consider [evidence of insanity] only if you find\n          that the State has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, each\n          of the offenses, each of the elements of the offenses of mur-\n          der or second-degree murder.\n\n           That is to say, you will consider this evidence only after\n          you have considered and deliberated and reached a verdict\n          of guilty in one of the charges . . . .\n\n           After or if you have reach[ed] that verdict, then you will\n          consider evidence with regard to the mental state of the\n          defendant.\n\nJ.A. at 326.\n\nNoland's argument that this instruction constitutes error relies on\nour decision in Cooper v. North Carolina, 702 F.2d 481, 484 (4th Cir.\n1983). In Cooper, a habeas petitioner argued that the judge's failure\n\"specifically to instruct the jury that it should consider mental illness\nevidence in connection with the state's proof of specific intent, pre-\nmeditation, and deliberation, . . . put the burden on him of demon-\nstrating, through the insanity defense, the absence of intent.\" Id. at\n484. Cooper rejected the argument that failure to include the prof-\n\n                     9\n\ffered instruction misled the jury into thinking that it could consider\nmental illness evidence with respect to a defense of insanity \"only in\nthat regard,\" and not with respect to intent, premeditation, and delib-\neration. Id. at 485.\n\nNoland argues that, unlike Cooper, this is a case in which the jury\nwas explicitly told that it could not consider evidence of mental illness\nwhen it was determining his ability to form the requisite intent for\nfirst-degree murder. Although Noland attempts to distinguish Cooper\non this basis, his argument cannot meaningfully be distinguished from\nCooper's claim. Noland, like Cooper, relies on the risk that a jury\nmight not consider relevant evidence based on the judge's instruction\nthat it must decide all the elements of murder before it can consider\nwhether the defendant was legally insane.\n\nThis interpretation of these instructions was specifically rejected by\nthe North Carolina Supreme Court in State v. Mize, 337 S.E.2d 562\n(N.C. 1985). Mize rejected an argument that these same instructions\nprohibited a jury from considering evidence of insanity as it related\nto their deliberations on premeditation, deliberation and malice.\nThe court in Mize reasoned that the instructions at issue \"merely\nreflect[ed] the order of the issues which would be submitted to the\njury\" and did not direct the jury to disregard evidence of insanity as\nit related to the elements of premeditation, deliberation, and malice.\nId. at 567 (emphasis added). Mize relied on previous decisions which\nheld that a defendant is not entitled to an affirmative instruction that\nthe jury must consider evidence of his mental condition when deter-\nmining whether the defendant acted with premeditation, deliberation\nand malice. Id. The court also reasoned that the trial court's clear\ninstructions that the intent elements must be found beyond a reason-\nable doubt eviscerated any danger that the jury might not consider\nevidence of insanity when determining these elements. Id.\n\nThe district court held that Noland's claim of improper instructions\nat the guilt-innocence phase was barred by the principles set forth in\nTeague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989), and we agree. Teague holds\nthat \"habeas corpus cannot be used as a vehicle to create new consti-\ntutional rules of criminal procedure.\" Teague , 489 U.S. at 316. A case\nannounces a new rule if the outcome \"was not dictated by precedent\nexisting at the time the defendant's conviction became final.\" Id. at\n\n                    10\n\f301 (emphasis in original); O'Dell v. Netherland , 95 F.3d 1214, 1223-\n24 (4th Cir. 1996) (en banc) (new rule test is \"whether it would have\nbeen objectively unreasonable, under the law existing at that time, for\na judge to reach a contrary result to that subsequently reached\").\n\nRead together, Cooper and Mize demonstrate not only that\nNoland's claim is not dictated by existing precedent, but that existing\nprecedent is squarely on point against Noland's argument. Contrary\nto Noland's assertions, Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790 (1952), and\nPatterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197 (1977), do not dictate the resolu-\ntion of this issue. Those cases decided that states did not violate the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by requiring crimi-\nnal defendants to prove affirmative defenses. They did not address the\nquestion at issue in this case: whether the judge's instructions created\na risk that the jury would not consider all relevant evidence in its\ndetermination of the essential elements of a crime.\n\nWere we to hold that the instructions at issue deprived Noland of\nhis right to due process, we would create a new rule, which is forbid-\nden by Teague. Neither of the two exceptions to Teague, see Teague,\n489 U.S. at 307-10, applies to Noland's claim: this rule would not\nplace certain conduct beyond the power of the law-making authority\nto proscribe, nor would it constitute a watershed rule of criminal pro-\ncedure. For these reasons, we find that this claim by Noland is barred\nby Teague.\n\nB.\n\nSecond, Noland claims that the prosecution used his post-arrest\ninvocation of Miranda rights to rebut his affirmative defense of insan-\nity, in violation of Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976), and\nWainwright v. Greenfield, 474 U.S. 284 (1986). The district court\nheld that the prosecutor's actions during direct examination of two\nwitnesses and closing argument constituted Greenfield error, but held\nthat this error was harmless. See J.A. at 1350-51. We find no\nGreenfield error in the first place.\n\nThe State twice elicited testimony from police officers that Noland\nunderstood his Miranda rights and exercised them. But these com-\nments were in the context of the officers' narratives regarding\n\n                    11\n\fNoland's apprehension and arrest. Defense counsel did not object at\ntrial, and the prosecutor's questions did not in any way draw attention\nto Noland's silence or invocation of his right to an attorney. Although\nno Fourth Circuit case has directly addressed the issue, other circuits\nhave held that mere mention of a defendant's exercise of Miranda\nrights is not per se prohibited; rather, a Greenfield violation depends\non \"the particular use to which the post-arrest silence is being put.\"\nLindgren v. Lane, 925 F.2d 198, 202 (7th Cir. 1991); see also Jones\nv. Stotts, 59 F.3d 143, 146 (10th Cir. 1995) (holding that \"it is the\nprosecutor's exploitation of a defendant's exercise of his right to\nsilence which is prohibited\"); United States v. Stubbs, 944 F.2d 828,\n835 (11th Cir. 1991) (finding no Greenfield violation \"when the gov-\nernment does not specifically and expressly attempt to use . . . the\nimproper comment to impeach the defendant\"). Greenfield \"does not\nimpose a prima facie bar against any mention whatsoever of a defen-\ndant's right to request counsel, but instead guards against the exploi-\ntation of that constitutional right by the prosecutor.\" Lindgren, 925\nF.2d at 202.\n\nContrary to Noland's assertion, the prosecutor did not use his clos-\ning argument to suggest that Noland's invocation of Miranda rights\nrebutted evidence of insanity. The prosecutor mentioned Miranda to\nremind jurors of the timing of the event, but argued that Noland's vol-\nuntary statement (\"Why are you being so nice to me when I just killed\ntwo people?\") rebutted his claim that he was unable to appreciate the\nwrongfulness of his actions. Reading the prosecutor's argument in its\nproper context clearly shows that his argument related to Noland's\nvoluntary statement, and not to his mention of Miranda. See J.A. at\n1415-16. Indeed, it would have made little sense for the prosecutor to\nhave argued that Noland's invocation of his right to a lawyer rebutted\nevidence of insanity when much more inculpatory and direct evidence\n-- Noland's curiosity that he was not being mistreated by the police\nafter having killed two people -- was available. Because trial testi-\nmony only made passing reference to Miranda, and the prosecutor did\nnot specifically exploit Noland's exercise of his Miranda rights, we\nfind no Greenfield error.\n\nC.\n\nThird, Noland claims that his trial counsel rendered ineffective\nassistance at both the guilt-innocence and penalty phases of trial in\n\n                    12\n\fviolation of the Sixth Amendment. We agree with the district court\nthat this claim has no merit.\n\nIn Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), the Supreme\nCourt established a two-prong test for determining whether assistance\nof counsel was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction or\nsentence. First, the defendant must establish that counsel's perfor-\nmance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of rea-\nsonableness under prevailing professional norms. Id. at 687-88.\nSecond, he must establish that the deficient performance prejudiced\nthe defense to the extent that he was deprived of a fair trial. Id. at 687.\n\nInitially, Noland contends that he was not afforded a fair and ade-\nquate hearing in state post-conviction because the state court refused\nto allow an attorney to testify as an expert as to what constitutes the\nobjective standard of reasonable competence for a lawyer trying a\ndeath penalty case. We agree with the district court that when an\nexpert witness is not in a better position than the fact finder to render\nan opinion on a matter, it is not error to exclude that witness' testi-\nmony. See J.A. at 1353-54. Under North Carolina law, the trial court\nis the finder of fact in a motion for appropriate relief. See N.C. Gen.\nStat. \u00a7 15A-1413 (1997). Noland's expert was in no better position\nthan the trial court judge, who had tried a number of capital cases,\nJ.A. at 390, to explain the general standard of practice and to assess\nthe adequacy of Noland's trial counsel. Noland was therefore not\nprejudiced in his state court hearing, and is not entitled to remand for\nfurther factual development by the district court.\n\n1. Guilt-Innocence Phase\n\nIn the district court, Noland argued that four errors by trial counsel\nfell below Strickland's objective standard of reasonable performance.\nJ.A. at 1360-62. These issues can be reduced essentially to two con-\ntentions: 1) trial counsel failed to prepare an adequate insanity\ndefense, and 2) trial counsel failed to challenge Noland's capacity to\nstand trial.\n\nAs to counsel's preparation for an insanity defense, the most seri-\nous allegation by Noland is that the defense presented no expert wit-\nness to testify that he was insane at the time of the murders. The\n\n                     13\n\fprosecution relied on this lack of evidence in its closing argument to\nthe jury. See J.A. at 1406. Noland claims that failure to present an\nexpert to testify that he was legally insane fell below reasonable stan-\ndards of professional competence.\n\nThe decision not to find such an expert, however, was a deliberate\ntrial strategy by defense counsel. The record indicates that defense\ncounsel had recently been \"burned\" in other trials by relying on expert\nwitnesses who were derided by prosecutors as the\"swami from New\nYork\" and the \"shrink from California.\" J.A. at 270. Noland's lawyers\npetitioned the trial court to appoint a psychiatrist to determine both\nhis competency to stand trial and his mental state at the time of the\ncrimes. See J.A. at 268-69. Dr. Billy Royal, a psychiatrist on staff at\na state mental hospital, evaluated Noland but was unable to form an\nopinion as to his sanity at the time of the crimes. Defense counsel\npresented the testimony of Dr. Royal at trial, who described Noland's\nhistory of mental illness and his mental state at the time the crimes\noccurred. Defense counsel relied on this testimony and argued to the\njury that it was their responsibility, not that of an expert, to determine\nwhether Noland was legally insane. Strickland counsels that trial law-\nyers must have wide latitude in making tactical decisions. Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 689. Defense counsels' request for a psychiatrist and use\nof Dr. Royal at trial suggest that their efforts were within the range\nof reasonable professional conduct.\n\nSecond, Noland argues that his counsel was ineffective for not ask-\ning the court to reevaluate his competency during the trial. Noland\npoints out that defense counsel at trial did not\"feel comfortable\" pre-\ndicting Noland's behavior. See Appellee's Br. (filed July 21, 1997) at\n41. Noland argues that this disquietude would have compelled a rea-\nsonable lawyer to interrupt the proceedings and challenge Noland's\ncompetency to stand trial. However, we find this evidence insufficient\nto overcome the \"strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls\nwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\"\nStrickland, 668 U.S. at 689. In sum, Noland's counsel rendered effec-\ntive assistance at the guilt-innocence phase of the trial.\n\n2. Penalty Phase\n\nIn the district court, Noland presented 11 instances of what he\nalleged were errors by his trial counsel at the penalty phase that sat-\n\n                     14\n\fisfy Strickland's test for ineffective assistance. J.A. at 1354-55.\nAlthough Noland does not specifically enumerate his contentions on\nappeal, they can be grouped into three colorable issues: 1) that\ndefense counsel presented no mitigating evidence and was unprepared\nat the sentencing phase; 2) that defense counsel did not consult with\nNoland in their decision not to present evidence at the sentencing\nphase; and 3) that defense counsel opened the door for the prosecu-\ntion to argue that his crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.\n\nAlthough several witnesses were prepared to testify on Noland's\nbehalf at the sentencing phase, his trial counsel decided not to present\ntheir testimony to the jury. Noland's counsel presented no evidence\nat the sentencing phase; the sentencing phase consisted solely in the\narguments of counsel. The failure to present mitigating evidence,\nhowever, is not per se violative of Strickland's performance prong.\nSee Turner v. Williams, 35 F.3d 872, 900-03 (4th Cir. 1994),\noverruled on other grounds, O'Dell v. Netherland, 95 F.3d 1214 (4th\nCir. 1996).\n\nThis decision not to present mitigating evidence did not violate\nNoland's right to effective counsel. First, Noland presented much of\nhis mitigating evidence during the guilt-innocence phase: Noland's\nmother and sister both testified as to his love for his children and pre-\nvious good relationship with the victims, and Dr. Royal testified as\nto Noland's mental disorders. Had these witnesses testified again,\ntheir testimony would have been cumulative. Second, while Noland\npoints out that several witnesses were prepared to testify at the pen-\nalty phase, he does not indicate how their testimony would have been\ndifferent from the evidence already presented at the guilt-innocence\nphase. Trial counsel cannot be faulted for deciding not to present wit-\nnesses whose testimony would only reiterate what had already been\npresented during the guilt phase of the trial. We agree with the district\ncourt that trial counsel's decision not to present mitigating evidence\nwas sound trial strategy and therefore within the objective standard of\nreasonable performance required by Strickland .\n\nSecond, Noland argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to\ndiscuss with him the decision not to present mitigating evidence.\nCounsel has a duty to keep her client informed of important develop-\nments in the trial and \"to consult with the defendant on important\n\n                     15\n\fissues.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Noland's counsel performed that\nduty in this case. It appears from the record that counsel informed\nNoland of their decision not to present mitigating evidence at the pen-\nalty phase. J.A. at 278. Noland was also aware of his right to testify\nat the penalty phase, but when informed by counsel that they did not\nintend to present evidence, Noland did not disagree or ask any ques-\ntions. J.A. at 278. Trial counsel's actions in this respect did not violate\nNoland's right to effective counsel under Strickland.\n\nFinally, Noland argues that his counsel erred by submitting the\nabsence of the \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\" (HAC) aggra-\nvating factor as a mitigating factor, opening the door for the prosecu-\ntion to argue that Noland's crime was especially heinous, atrocious,\nor cruel. Prior to sentencing, defense counsel had successfully argued\nto the judge that the crimes were not sufficiently heinous, atrocious,\nor cruel for the jury to consider the HAC aggravating factor. But in\nits list of explicit mitigating factors to be submitted to the jury,\ndefense counsel inexplicably included a statement that Noland's\ncrime was not especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, thereby opening\nthe door for the prosecution to argue this issue.\n\nWhen it is possible to resolve a Strickland claim on the prejudice\nprong, we may do so without deciding whether counsel's conduct was\noutside the range of reasonable competence. See Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 697. In this case, whether or not counsel's decision was outside the\nrange of reasonable competence, there is no reasonable probability\nthat but for this alleged error the result would have been different.\nWhatever prejudice could have occurred as a result of counsel's deci-\nsion apparently did not; the prosecutor did not emphasize the espe-\ncially heinous, atrocious, or cruel nature of this crime at closing\nargument. Also, the absence of the HAC aggravating factor was only\none of 17 mitigating factors submitted to the jury. There is simply no\nreasonable probability that had it not been submitted, the jury would\nhave rendered a different verdict.\n\nD.\n\nFinally, Noland argues that although a pre-trial examination found\nhim competent to stand trial, see J.A. at 269, he became incompetent\nduring the course of trial and his conviction and sentence therefore\n\n                     16\n\fviolated his right to due process of law. The district court found that\nNoland was provided a full and fair hearing on this issue in his state\npost-conviction attack, and that the state court's finding was pre-\nsumed to be correct under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254(d) (West 1994) (pre-\nAEDPA).\n\nAt the post-conviction hearing, the state court judge heard testi-\nmony from Noland and his trial counsel that Noland was incompetent\nto stand trial. The state court also considered Noland's relevant men-\ntal health records and medical evaluations. From this information, the\nstate court judge made a written factual finding that Noland \"failed\nto establish that at the time of his trial he was . . . unable to under-\nstand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to compre-\nhend his own situation with reference to them, or to assist in his own\ndefense.\" J.A. at 261. The state court's consideration of this matter\nadequately developed the material facts and provided Noland a full\nand fair hearing, and is therefore presumed to be correct under\n\u00a7 2254(d), notwithstanding Noland's argument that the state court did\nnot consider the affidavit of a psychiatrist who evaluated Noland after\nthe post-conviction hearing. See Appellee's Br. (filed July 21, 1997)\nat 49.\n\nV.\n\nFor the reasons articulated above, the district court erred when it\ngranted Noland's petition and ordered the State to resentence him.\nThe writ should have been denied as to all of Noland's claims. The\ndistrict court's order granting the writ is vacated and the matter is\nremanded to the district court for the entry of an order denying the\nwrit in its entirety.\n\nREVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART\n\n                     17\n\f\f",
