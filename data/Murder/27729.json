Lane contends the evidence was insufficient to show that he intended to inflict great\n\nbodily harm on another person. Lane also argues that his sentence exceeded the statutory\n\nmaximum, and he challenges the imposition of interest on nonrestitution legal financial\n\nobligations.\n\n       We affirm Lane\u2019s conviction for attempted first degree assault because the evidence was\n\nsufficient to support his conviction. Lane\u2019s sentence exceeded the statutory maximum and we\n\nremand for resentencing. We also accept the State\u2019s concession that the provision imposing interest\n\non nonrestitution obligations was improper, and we direct the trial court not to impose interest on\n\nnonrestitution obligations upon resentencing.\n\n       Lane raises additional arguments for reversal in a statement of additional grounds for\n\nreview (SAG). None of Lane\u2019s SAG arguments merits reversal.\n\fNo. 53685-4-II\n\n\n                                            FACTS\n\nA.     The Arrest\n\n       On the morning of February 28, 2019, Sergeant Garique Clifford and Deputy Jennifer Vejar\n\nof the Skamania County Sheriff\u2019s Office went to Lane\u2019s home to arrest him on active arrest\n\nwarrants, but Lane did not answer the door. That afternoon, Lane\u2019s lawyer notified law\n\nenforcement that Lane called him, saying he was suicidal, had a gun, and police were surrounding\n\nhis house.\n\n       Clifford, who knew Lane, briefly spoke to Lane on the phone, but the call dropped because\n\nthe connection was poor. Clifford then contacted two other officers, Undersheriff Pat Bond and\n\nChief Deputy David Waymire. Bond and Waymire met Clifford at a parking lot near Lane\u2019s house.\n\nDeputy Will Helton joined later.\n\n       Waymire had known Lane for over 30 years because they grew up in the same community,\n\nand Clifford thought their rapport might help Waymire convince Lane to come out of his house.\n\nWaymire and Lane texted and talked on the phone. Waymire tried to convince Lane to peacefully\n\nallow the officers to arrest him, but Lane made \u201csuicidal statements . . . about having a weapon\n\nand using the weapon on himself\u201d and refused to come out. Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP)\n\n(May 13, 2019) at 268.\n\n       Lane then stopped communicating with the officers. Clifford, Waymire, Bond, and Helton\n\nreturned to Lane\u2019s house, knocked on the front door, and shouted for Lane to come out. One of the\n\nofficers shouted to Lane that he would kick the door in if Lane did not come out. Lane did not\n\ncome to the door and after about five minutes, the officers decided to kick in the back door of\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\fNo. 53685-4-II\n\n\nLane\u2019s house. They intended to reestablish communication but not enter the house. Clifford was\n\nwearing a body camera, which recorded the officers.\n\n        Clifford, Waymire, and Helton walked around to the back door of the house while Bond\n\nstayed at the front. The officers could hear a dog barking inside and were concerned it might attack.\n\nWaymire kicked the door until it gave way. Clifford stood behind Waymire with his rifle drawn to\n\ncover Waymire and pepper spray ready if the dog became a problem. Clifford had a view of the\n\ndoor. Waymire stepped to the side immediately after the door opened, and Clifford stepped almost\n\ndirectly in front of the door. Lane stood inside the hallway about 20 feet away. Lane was holding\n\na long-barreled dark-colored gun. The lights were off inside the house, but it was the middle of the\n\nday, so ambient outdoor light illuminated the open doorway.\n\n        As soon as Clifford stepped in front of the door, Lane shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s only one way this\n\nends, motherf*****s.\u201d VRP (May 13, 2019) at 239 Clifford then said, \u201c[O]h, s**t, he\u2019s got a gun.\u201d\n\nVRP (May 13, 2019) at 240. Waymire and Helton hopped over the backyard fence into a\n\nneighboring yard while Clifford began slowly backing away from the door. At the same time, Lane\n\nshouted, \u201cF**k you, Dave\u201d (referring to Waymire) and \u201cDon\u2019t make me do something f**king\n\nstupid.\u201d Id.\n\n        As he retreated, Clifford described Lane\u2019s gun, saying into his radio, \u201cIt\u2019s a long gun,\n\nblack.\u201d VRP (May 13, 2019) at 241. The officers then called the Special Weapons and Tactical\n\nTeam (SWAT).\n\n        While waiting for SWAT to arrive, Waymire texted with and talked to Lane on the phone\n\nand tried to persuade Lane to surrender. Lane wrote, \u201cI promise [I\u2019]m no threat to anyone,\u201d\n\nfollowed by, \u201cMe, myself and [I] maybe.\u201d Ex. 2 at 5. Waymire responded, \u201cI know.\u201d Id. Lane later\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fNo. 53685-4-II\n\n\nwrote, \u201cPlease don[\u2019]t have [SWAT] do anything, [I] don\u2019t want suicide by cop. Not at all,\u201d and\n\n\u201cI know if they make entry and [I\u2019m] still holding this shottie, [that is] exactly what will happen[.]\n\nYou know this.\u201d Ex. 2 at 9.\n\n       Lane also told Waymire over the phone that he planned to kill himself with his shotgun\n\nand had 12 gauge slugs for ammunition. During the call, Lane slammed the gun down, causing it\n\nto fire into the ceiling. Waymire heard the gun go off through the phone. Lane then explained to\n\nWaymire that it was an accidental discharge because the gun had a \u201chair trigger.\u201d VRP (May 13,\n\n2019) at 279.\n\n       Lane decided not to shoot himself, so he disassembled the shotgun and placed one portion\n\non the back of the couch and other portions in an attic crawlspace above the garage accessible by\n\na ladder. Lane then came out of the house unarmed and surrendered to law enforcement.\n\n       The officers obtained a search warrant for the house. The officers found the pieces of the\n\ngun. The State presented evidence that if the barrel was attached to the stock and trigger, it would\n\ncreate a functional firearm that could be lethal from a 20-foot range.\n\n       Lane was charged with three counts of attempted first degree assault with firearm\n\nenhancements for each count and unlawful possession of a firearm.\n\nB.     Trial\n\n       The officers testified consistent with the facts above. Clifford also testified that he was\n\nafraid during the incident and believed Lane was going to shoot him.\n\n       The trial court admitted the text messages between Waymire and Lane, and Waymire read\n\nthem into the record. Photographs of the house and items inside it, as well as the firearm\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fNo. 53685-4-II\n\n\ncomponents and ammunition, were admitted at trial and several officers testified about this\n\nevidence. Footage from Clifford\u2019s body camera was admitted and played for the jury.\n\n        Lane\u2019s testimony about the events differed to some degree from the testimony of the\n\nofficers. Lane said that when the officers came to his house he was suicidal but never intended to\n\nhurt anyone else. Lane denied that he had been holding a weapon when the officers kicked in the\n\ndoor and said he was on the floor restraining his dog. Lane acknowledged making the comments\n\nrecorded on Clifford\u2019s body camera, but he explained he was merely frustrated that the officers\n\nhad broken his door because he was trying to sell the house. Lane also said that being confronted\n\nby the officers made him feel a greater urgency to kill himself but his comments were not intended\n\nas threats to the officers.\n\n        Lane also testified that the shotgun was not assembled when the officers kicked in the door,\n\nhe only began assembling it afterward, and he was not sure it would be a viable weapon. But on\n\ncross-examination, Lane agreed that the shotgun he had assembled could \u201cblow a hole\u201d through\n\nsomeone and he intended to use that gun to end his own life. VRP (May 13, 2019) at 393.\n\n        The jury was instructed that to convict Lane of attempted first degree assault, the State had\n\nto prove that Lane intended \u201cto inflict great bodily harm\u201d and took \u201ca substantial step\u201d toward\n\n\u201cassault[ing] another with a firearm.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 216-17. The jury instructions defined\n\n\u201cintent\u201d as \u201cacting with the objective or purpose to accomplish a result that constitutes a crime\u201d\n\nand defined \u201cgreat bodily harm\u201d as \u201cbodily injury that creates a probability of death . . . significant\n\nserious permanent disfigurement, or . . . significant permanent loss or impairment of the function\n\nof any bodily part or organ.\u201d CP at 220, 223. The jury instructions stated that an act constituting\n\nassault could be either an attempted battery or \u201can act done with the intent to create . . .\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fNo. 53685-4-II\n\n\napprehension and fear of bodily injury.\u201d CP at 219. In closing, the State argued that the officers,\n\nincluding Clifford, were afraid and thought Lane would shoot them.\n\nC.      Verdict and Sentence\n\n        The jury found Lane guilty of attempted first degree assault against Clifford (count I),\n\nsecond degree unlawful possession of a firearm (count IV), and the lesser included offense of\n\nsecond degree assault against Clifford (count V). The jury found by special verdict that Lane was\n\narmed with a firearm at the time of the offenses. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the\n\ncharges of attempted first degree assault and second degree assault of Waymire and Helton (counts\n\nII, III, VI, and VII). The trial court declared a mistrial with regard to counts II, III, VI, and VII.\n\n        Lane was sentenced for counts I and IV. His base sentence for attempted first degree assault\n\nwas 84 months. Lane was convicted of attempted first degree assault using a firearm, so the 36-\n\nmonth firearm sentencing enhancement under RCW 9.94A.533(3)(b) brought his sentence to the\n\nstatutory maximum of 120 months. The trial court imposed a 12-month concurrent sentence for\n\nLane\u2019s unlawful possession of a firearm conviction. Lane was also sentenced to 36 months of\n\ncommunity custody.\n\n        Lane\u2019s judgment and sentence contained a boilerplate notation stating that the \u201ccombined\n\nterm of confinement and community custody for any particular offense cannot exceed the statutory\n\nmaximum.\u201d CP at 283. The trial court explained that it was sentencing Lane to 36 months\n\ncommunity custody, but Lane would only serve community custody time if he earned early release\n\ncredits, such that his total sentence would not exceed the 120-month statutory maximum.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fNo. 53685-4-II\n\n\n       The trial court also imposed the $500 crime victim assessment and $100 DNA collection\n\nfee. The judgment and sentence stated that all legal financial obligations would bear interest at the\n\nrate applicable to civil judgments.\n\n       Lane appeals his convictions, sentence, and the imposition of interest on nonrestitution\n\nlegal financial obligations. Lane also filed a SAG.\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n             I. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE FOR ATTEMPTED FIRST DEGREE ASSAULT\n\n       Lane argues the evidence was insufficient to convict him of attempted first degree assault\n\nbecause there was no evidence that he intended to inflict bodily injury on another person or create\n\nan apprehension of harm in anyone. We disagree.\n\nA.     Attempted First Degree Assault\n\n       Under RCW 9A.36.011(1)(a), a person may be convicted of first degree assault if the State\n\nproves that the person acted \u201cwith intent to inflict great bodily harm\u201d and, as applicable here,\n\n\u201c[a]ssault[ed] another with a firearm.\u201d The statute does not define \u201cassault,\u201d so common law\n\ndefinitions apply. State v. Stevens, 158 Wn.2d 304, 310-11, 143 P.3d 817 (2006). There are three\n\ncommon law definitions of \u201cassault\u201d under Washington law: \u201c(1) [A]n attempt, with unlawful\n\nforce, to inflict bodily injury upon another; (2) an unlawful touching with criminal intent; and (3)\n\nputting another in apprehension of harm whether or not the actor intends to inflict or is incapable\n\nof inflicting that harm.\u201d Id. at 311. These definitions are \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d and \u201cdo not\n\nconstitute additional alternative means of committing . . . assault.\u201d State v. Elmi, 166 Wn.2d 209,\n\n215-16, 207 P.3d 439 (2009). The jury here was instructed on the first and third definitions of\n\n\u201cassault.\u201d\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fNo. 53685-4-II\n\n\n       \u201cThe mens rea for first degree assault is the specific intent to inflict great bodily harm.\u201d Id.\n\nat 215. \u201cSpecific intent\u201d means \u201cintent to produce a specific result, as opposed to intent to do the\n\nphysical act that produces the result.\u201d Id.; see also RCW 9A.08.010(1)(a). \u201cGreat bodily harm\u201d is\n\n\u201cbodily injury which creates a probability of death, or which causes significant serious permanent\n\ndisfigurement, or which causes a significant permanent loss or impairment of the function of any\n\nbodily part or organ.\u201d RCW 9A.04.110(4)(c). \u201cWhen \u2018[s]pecific intent\u2019 is an element of the crime,\n\nit \u2018cannot be presumed\u2019\u201d but \u201cit \u2018can be inferred as a logical probability from all the facts and\n\ncircumstances.\u2019\u201d State v. Johnson, 188 Wn.2d 742, 762-63, 399 P.3d 507 (2017) (alteration in\n\noriginal) (quoting State v. Wilson, 125 Wn.2d 212, 217, 883 P.2d 320 (1994)).\n\n       Under RCW 9A.28.020(1), a person can be convicted of an attempt crime where the State\n\nproves that the defendant acted \u201cwith intent to commit a specific crime\u201d and did \u201cany act which is\n\na substantial step toward the commission of that crime.\u201d See also State v. Nelson, 191 Wn.2d 61,\n\n71, 419 P.3d 410 (2018). An act that constitutes a substantial step is one that strongly corroborates\n\nthe actor\u2019s criminal purpose. State v. Johnson, 173 Wn.2d 895, 899, 270 P.3d 591 (2012). \u201cAny\n\nslight act done in furtherance of a crime constitutes an attempt if it clearly shows the design of the\n\nindividual to commit the crime.\u201d State v. Price, 103 Wn. App. 845, 852, 14 P.3d 841 (2000).\n\nB.     Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       To determine the sufficiency of the evidence, we assess whether, viewing the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. State v. Yishmael, 195 Wn.2d 155, 177, 456 P.3d 1172 (2020). We draw all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the State and assume the truth of the State\u2019s evidence. State v.\n\nScanlan, 193 Wn.2d 753, 770, 445 P.3d 960 (2019), cert. denied, Scanlan v. Washington, 140 S.\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fNo. 53685-4-II\n\n\nCt. 834, 204 L. Ed. 2d 483 (2020). We cannot review the trier of fact\u2019s credibility determinations.\n\nState v. Camarillo, 115 Wn.2d 60, 71, 794 P.2d 850 (1990). \u201cDirect and circumstantial evidence\n\nare equally reliable.\u201d State v. Dillon, 12 Wn. App. 2d 133, 140, 456 P.3d 1199, review denied, 195\n\nWn.2d 1022 (2020).\n\n       Lane limits his sufficiency of the evidence challenge to the mental state element of\n\nattempted first degree assault. Lane contends that the evidence showed he was suicidal but never\n\nintended to harm others. Lane asserts, \u201cThe State failed to prove that [his] act of holding a gun . .\n\n. was done with the intent to cause great bodily harm.\u201d Br. of Appellant at 15.\n\n       Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, a reasonable jury could have\n\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt that Lane intended to cause great bodily harm to Clifford. Lane\n\nwas not merely holding a gun, but aiming a loaded gun at the officers while shouting threats at\n\nthem. Lane ignored orders to come outside, and the officers kicked in the door to his house in an\n\neffort to arrest him, which supported a reasonable inference that Lane would be hostile to the\n\nofficers. Given that context, the act of pointing a loaded gun at Clifford from 20 feet away, shouting\n\nthat there was only one way the encounter would end, and warning the officers against making\n\nhim do something \u201cstupid\u201d was enough for a reasonable jury to conclude that Lane exhibited an\n\nintent to shoot Clifford with a gun capable of seriously injuring or killing him. See VRP (May 13,\n\n2019) at 240. A jury could thus reasonably have concluded that Lane intended to cause great bodily\n\nharm as required by RCW 9A.36.011(1)(a).\n\n       We reject Lane\u2019s contention that feeling suicidal meant he could not also have intended to\n\nhurt anyone else. Lane was charged with attempted first degree assault because he pointed the gun\n\nat Clifford, not at himself. To the extent Lane relies on text messages he sent to Waymire saying\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fNo. 53685-4-II\n\n\nthat he was only a threat to himself, Lane sent those messages after the encounter with Clifford.\n\nMoreover, the jury was entitled to infer Lane\u2019s intent based on the behavior he exhibited,\n\nregardless of what he said was going through his mind during the encounter. Johnson, 188 Wn.2d\n\nat 762-63.\n\n       We affirm Lane\u2019s attempted first degree assault conviction.\n\n                                        II. SENTENCING\n\nA.     Statutory Maximum\n\n       Lane argues that his sentence exceeded the 120-month statutory maximum for his offenses.\n\nWe agree.\n\n        \u201cA sentence may not exceed the statutory maximum term set by the legislature.\u201d State v.\n\nHagler, 150 Wn. App. 196, 203, 208 P.3d 32 (2009); RCW 9.94A.505(5). A community custody\n\nterm \u201cshall be reduced . . . whenever an offender\u2019s standard range term of confinement in\n\ncombination with the term of community custody exceeds the statutory maximum.\u201d RCW\n\n9.94A.701(9). A note on the judgment and sentence indicating that the total sentence, including\n\ncommunity custody, may not exceed the statutory maximum does not comply with RCW\n\n9.94A.701(9). State v. Boyd, 174 Wn.2d 470, 472-73, 275 P.3d 321 (2012). When this issue is\n\nraised on appeal, the appropriate remedy is to remand for the trial court to amend the sentence\n\nconsistent with RCW 9.94A.701(9). Id. at 473.\n\n       Here, the statutory maximum was 120 months. RCW 9A.36.011(2), .28.020(3)(b),\n\n.20.021(1)(b). Lane was sentenced to 84 months for his attempted first degree assault conviction\n\nand the 36-month firearm enhancement, bringing his confinement term to the 120-month statutory\n\nmaximum. Lane was then sentenced to an additional 36 months community custody. Lane\u2019s\n\n\n                                                10\n\fNo. 53685-4-II\n\n\njudgment and sentence thus does not comply with RCW 9.94A.701(9). Boyd, 174 Wn.2d at 472-\n\n73. We remand for the trial court to resentence Lane on count I consistent with RCW 9.94A.701(9).\n\nB.     Interest on Nonrestitution Legal Financial Obligations\n\n       The State concedes that the judgment and sentence improperly imposed interest on\n\nnonrestitution obligations. Br. of Resp\u2019t at 13. We accept the State\u2019s concession and direct the trial\n\ncourt to address this error on resentencing.\n\n                     III. STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL GROUNDS FOR REVIEW\n\n       Lane appears to argue that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of attempted first\n\ndegree assault because the body camera footage shows that Clifford could not have seen Lane\n\nholding a gun because the door was only open a few inches, the house was dark, and the windows\n\nwere closed. Lane further argues that he was not holding a gun but restraining his dog.\n\n       We reject this argument. Clifford testified that he saw Lane standing in the hallway of the\n\nhouse holding a gun. Clifford said he could see into the house even though the lights were off\n\nbecause it was daylight outside and the ambient light illuminated the hallway through the open\n\ndoor. Clifford\u2019s testimony was evidence. Lane testified to his version of events, including that it\n\nwas completely dark in his house and he was restraining his dog. The jury weighed this conflicting\n\ntestimony, and we do not review credibility determinations on appeal. Camarillo, 115 Wn.2d at\n\n71.\n\n       Lane also argues that the body camera audio recording does not capture him saying,\n\n\u201c\u2018Don\u2019t make me do something f****** stupid.\u2019\u201d SAG at 1. But Lane can be heard making this\n\ncomment in the body camera footage.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fNo. 53685-4-II\n\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       We affirm Lane\u2019s conviction for attempted first degree assault because the evidence was\n\nsufficient to convict him of this offense. We remand for resentencing in accord with RCW\n\n9.94A.701(9) and direct the trial court not to impose interest on nonrestitution obligations upon\n\nresentencing.\n\n       A majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the\n\nWashington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record in accordance with RCW\n\n2.06.040, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n                                                    Glasgow, J.\n We concur:\n\n\n\n Lee, C.J.\n\n\n\n\n Worswick, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f",
