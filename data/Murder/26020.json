The circuit court of Cook County refused defendant\u2019s request, and he was\n     subsequently found guilty on three counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault.\n\f\u00b62       On appeal, the appellate court, with one justice dissenting, reversed defendant\u2019s\n     convictions and remanded for a new trial, holding that the trial court \u201cabused its\n     discretion when it refused to ask venire members questions about potential bias\n     against persons who participate in prostitution.\u201d 2017 IL App (1st) 142548, \u00b6 1.\n\n\u00b63      For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the appellate court.\n\n\n\u00b64                                       Background\n\n\u00b65       Defendant was indicted on 15 charges of aggravated criminal sexual assault and\n     3 charges of criminal sexual assault. In the indictment, it was alleged that, on the\n     morning of March 5, 2006, defendant knowingly, and by the use of force or threat\n     of force, committed acts of oral, vaginal, and anal sexual penetration upon Y.C.\n\n\u00b66       Prior to defendant\u2019s trial, the State filed a motion to admit other crimes\n     evidence to show that defendant committed similar sexual assaults against J.H.,\n     C.C., and S.A. Following a hearing, the trial court granted the State\u2019s request with\n     respect to C.C. and S.A., allowing admittance of other crimes evidence to show\n     intent, lack of consent, and propensity. The court denied the State\u2019s request with\n     respect to J.H. but ruled that the State could impeach defendant with his conviction\n     for predatory criminal sexual assault against J.H. if he chose to testify.\n\n\u00b67       After the trial court ruled to allow the admission of other crimes evidence,\n     defense counsel advised the court that defendant intended to testify that Y.C., C.C.,\n     and S.A. all consented to having sex with defendant in exchange for the payment of\n     cash and drugs but that, after they provided the agreed services, defendant took\n     back the payments he made. Counsel stated that the jurors \u201care going to hear\n     evidence that [defendant] did engage in soliciting and using prostitutes.\u201d\n     Accordingly, defense counsel asked the court to inquire of the venire whether\n     \u201c[t]he fact that you will hear evidence about\u2014and just put it mildly\u2014to not try to\n     indoctrinate them at all\u2014you will hear evidence about prostitution. Would that fact\n     alone prevent you from being fair to either side?\u201d The court refused the request,\n     finding that the question was improper because it would be \u201casking them to\n     comment on particular types of evidence that they may hear.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                             -2\u00ad\n\f\u00b68          The matter proceeded to trial on 6 of the 18 counts of aggravated criminal\n       sexual assault committed against Y.C. At trial, Y.C. testified that around 6 a.m. on\n       March 5, 2006, as she was walking on Sawyer Street in Chicago to go to a bakery,\n       she saw a car parked across the street with a man inside. The man, whom she did\n       not recognize but later identified as defendant, called to her. Y.C. crossed the street\n       on her way to the bakery, bringing her closer to the car. Defendant then called out to\n       her again, saying \u201c[Y]o, your cousin Jose, he was looking for you.\u201d Because Y.C.\n       had a cousin Jose who lived a few blocks away, she went over to the car and asked\n       what Jose wanted. Defendant, said, \u201cHe needs you.\u201d Y.C. then got into defendant\u2019s\n       car.\n\n\u00b69         Once Y.C. was in defendant\u2019s car, he began driving in the opposite direction.\n       Y.C. asked where they were going and defendant said, \u201c[Y]ou know what this is.\u201d\n       Y.C. testified she did not know what he meant but thought perhaps she was going to\n       be robbed. Defendant then proceeded to an alley where there were no other cars or\n       people. At this point, Y.C. testified, she became very frightened. She told defendant\n       that she was pregnant and begged defendant not to do anything to harm her or her\n       unborn child. Defendant, however, cursed at her and told her to shut up.\n\n\u00b6 10       Y.C. testified that she tried to open the car door, but it was locked. Defendant\n       became angry and began to strike her repeatedly in the face. Also, he opened the\n       glove compartment, showed her a pistol, and threatened to kill her. Defendant then\n       forced Y.C. to perform oral sex on him, after which he sexually penetrated her\n       vaginally and anally. When defendant was finished, he ordered Y.C. out of the car.\n       As Y.C. tried to \u201cfix\u201d herself because her pants and underwear fell off her feet,\n       defendant threw her shoe and underwear out of the car. Also, defendant began\n       pushing Y.C. out of the car and told her that if she did not leave his car\n       immediately, he would kill her.\n\n\u00b6 11       After defendant drove away, Y.C. ran into the street and tried to wave down\n       cars. At this point, Deputy Fernando Rodriguez of the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s\n       Office happened along, saw Y.C., and stopped to help her. He took Y.C. to the\n       police station and then to the hospital where a sexual assault kit was collected.\n       Subsequent analysis of the kit showed the presence of semen in the vaginal and anal\n       swabs. Forensic testing matched defendant\u2019s DNA to the vaginal sample but not to\n       the anal sample.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -3\u00ad\n\f\u00b6 12       Y.C. testified that she moved to South Carolina in 2007 and, in 2009, she went\n       to a South Carolina police department to view a photo array. From this photo array,\n       she was able to identify defendant as her assailant. In addition, in May 2009, she\n       came to Chicago to view a physical lineup. Again, she identified defendant as her\n       attacker.\n\n\u00b6 13       Deputy Rodriguez testified, confirming that, on March 5, 2006, as he was\n       driving northbound on Kedzie Avenue near Moffat Street, he saw Y.C. in the\n       middle of the street, frantically waving her arms and trying to persuade passing cars\n       to stop. Deputy Rodriguez described Y.C. as very distressed. He said she had blood\n       on her mouth, was crying hysterically, was shaking, and was unable to speak at\n       times. He took Y.C. to the police station and then to the hospital.\n\n\u00b6 14       The State then presented evidence that defendant had committed similar acts of\n       sexual assault against C.C. C.C. testified that on the evening of September 1, 2002,\n       she had gone to the Red Dog Club on North Avenue in Chicago with her sister.\n       C.C. said she decided to leave the club to get some fresh air and sit in her sister\u2019s\n       car. As she walked toward the car, a man 1 drove up and asked if she needed a ride.\n       Initially, she said no. However, when she could not find her sister\u2019s car and because\n       it was very cold outside, when defendant drove up again, she got into his car. C.C.\n       testified that she did not recognize the man and that, after she entered the car, he put\n       a bandana on his face, which kept her from getting a good look at him.\n\n\u00b6 15       When the man put the bandana on, C.C. asked him what he was doing. The man\n       punched her in the mouth, displayed a knife, and told her to shut up. Because C.C.\n       began screaming, the man punched her again. C.C. tried to get out of the car, but the\n       door was locked. Defendant then told her to take her clothes off and that \u201cit was\n       going to happen whether [she] liked it or not.\u201d C.C. testified that she started crying\n       but defendant ignored her cries, jumped on top of her, and sexually assaulted her,\n       penetrating her vaginally. When he was done, he told her to put her clothes on as he\n       drove back to the club. At the club, he told C.C to get out of the car. But before she\n       did, he tore her jewelry off.\n\n\n           1\n            C.C. was never able to identify defendant as her assailant, but DNA linked defendant to the\n       attack.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    -4\u00ad\n\f\u00b6 16       C.C. testified that when she got back to the club she contacted the police, who\n       were already at the club because they provided security at closing time. C.C. was\n       taken to the hospital, where a sexual assault kit was collected. Evidence was\n       presented to show that defendant\u2019s DNA matched the swab taken at the hospital.\n       The State then rested its case.\n\n\u00b6 17       Defendant testified in his own defense. He admitted that he had sex with Y.C.\n       and C.C. and also admitted he had a prior conviction for predatory criminal sexual\n       assault. However, defendant claimed that, on March 5, 2006, he had gone to the\n       area near Armitage Road and Kedzie Avenue because it was an area known for\n       prostitution. He said he saw Y.C., pulled up next to her, and asked her for a date, \u201cif\n       she was working.\u201d According to defendant, Y.C. said \u201cYes\u201d and immediately got\n       into his car. Defendant said he offered Y.C. money and marijuana in exchange for\n       oral and vaginal sex and she agreed. He then parked in an alley, where they engaged\n       in consensual oral and vaginal intercourse.\n\n\u00b6 18       Defendant further testified that, because he was not able \u201cto finish,\u201d he decided\n       to grab the money and marijuana back. He said this enraged Y.C., who began\n       swinging at him and yelling at him, demanding the money back. Defendant said he\n       then opened the door, grabbed Y.C.\u2019s pants and underwear, threw them out of the\n       car, and told Y.C. to get out. Defendant admitted threatening Y.C. that she \u201cbetter\n       not be here when I get back.\u201d Defendant denied punching Y.C. and denied having a\n       gun. On cross-examination, defendant admitted that he penetrated Y.C.\u2019s anus\n       \u201caccidentally.\u201d Defendant claimed he immediately stopped and apologized.\n\n\u00b6 19       With regard to C.C., defendant testified that he picked her up on September 1,\n       2002, around North Avenue and Wood Street, another area known for prostitution.\n       Defendant said he saw C.C. on the street and honked at her and she came over to his\n       car. He then negotiated with her, offering her $60 and some cocaine in exchange for\n       oral and vaginal sex. When she agreed, she got into his car, and he drove to a\n       parking lot, where they engaged in sex. He testified further that, after having sex, he\n       \u201cdid the same stupid act. I took\u2014I went and took my money back from her.\u201d\n       Defendant claimed that when he took the money back, C.C. slapped him and pulled\n       his hair. He then reached over and pushed her out of the car and drove away.\n       Defendant denied forcing C.C. to have sex, punching her, having worn a bandana,\n       having a knife, or taking C.C.\u2019s jewelry. Defendant admitted he had been convicted\n\n\n\n\n                                                -5\u00ad\n\f       of predatory criminal sexual assault but denied sexually assaulting either Y.C. or\n       C.C. Defendant then rested.\n\n\u00b6 20       The jury found defendant guilty on three counts of aggravated criminal sexual\n       assault. In a motion for a new trial, defendant again raised the issue of the court\u2019s\n       refusal to question the venire about prostitution. The trial court denied the motion\n       for a new trial. Defendant was sentenced to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment on each of the\n       three counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault, with each sentence to run\n       consecutive to each other and consecutive to defendant\u2019s sentence in the predatory\n       criminal sexual assault case.\n\n\u00b6 21       The appellate court, with one justice dissenting, reversed defendant\u2019s\n       convictions and remanded for a new trial. 2017 IL App (1st) 142548. The court\n       held that the circuit court abused its discretion when it refused to question the\n       venire members about any potential bias they might have in connection with\n       prostitution.\n\n\u00b6 22      We granted the State\u2019s petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315(a) (eff.\n       Mar. 15, 2016). We also allowed The John Marshall Law School\u2019s Pro Bono\n       Program & Clinic to file an amicus curiae brief in support of the State. Ill. S. Ct. R.\n       345 (eff. Sep. 20, 2010).\n\n\n\u00b6 23                                         Analysis\n\n\u00b6 24        A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury.\n       Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 727 (1992); People v. Strain, 194 Ill. 2d 467, 475\n       (2000). To secure this right, inquiry is permitted during voir dire \u201c \u2018to ascertain\n       whether the juror has any bias, opinion, or prejudice that would affect or control the\n       fair determination by him of the issues to be tried.\u2019 \u201d People v. Lobb, 17 Ill. 2d 287,\n       300 (1959) (quoting Connors v. United States, 158 U.S. 408, 413 (1895)). \u201cThe\n       purpose of voir dire is to ascertain sufficient information about prospective jurors\u2019\n       beliefs and opinions so as to allow removal of those members of the venire whose\n       minds are so closed by bias and prejudice that they cannot apply the law as\n       instructed in accordance with their oath.\u201d People v. Cloutier, 156 Ill. 2d 483,\n       495-96 (1993). Jurors \u201cmust harbor no bias or prejudice which would prevent them\n\n\n\n\n                                                -6\u00ad\n\f       from returning a verdict according to the law and evidence.\u201d Strain, 194 Ill. 2d at\n       476.\n\n\u00b6 25        The manner, extent, and scope of voir dire examination rests within the\n       discretion of the trial court. Id.; People v. Terrell, 185 Ill. 2d 467, 484 (1998);\n       People v. Rinehart, 2012 IL 111719, \u00b6 16. However, \u201cthe trial court must exercise\n       its discretion in a manner consistent with the purpose of voir dire.\u201d Strain, 194 Ill.\n       2d at 476. \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs when the conduct of the trial court\n       thwarts the purpose of voir dire examination\u2014namely, the selection of a jury free\n       from bias or prejudice.\u201d Rinehart, 2012 IL 111719, \u00b6 16. \u201cTo be constitutionally\n       compelled, it is not enough that a voir dire question be helpful[;] rather, the trial\n       court\u2019s failure to ask the question must render the defendant\u2019s proceedings\n       fundamentally unfair.\u201d Terrell, 185 Ill. 2d at 485.\n\n\u00b6 26       The appellate court below observed that various courts have noted that certain\n       sexual behaviors, including prostitution, can evoke \u201cstrong responses.\u201d 2017 IL\n       App (1st) 142548, \u00b6 31. The appellate court further observed that a number of\n       jurisdictions use public shaming against patrons of prostitutes as a means to reduce\n       prostitution because \u201clegislatures and the customers of women who exchange sex\n       for money know that many persons feel strong disgust and antipathy toward the\n       patrons of prostitutes.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. Based on these observations, the appellate\n       court concluded that \u201cjurors may hold similar biases against customers of women\n       who exchange sex for money.\u201d Id. \u00b6 32. From this, the appellate court reasoned\n       that, because the jury in this case was going to hear evidence that defendant\n       patronized prostitutes, his proffered question should have been put to the jurors so\n       he could ascertain whether they were free from bias. Relying largely on this court\u2019s\n       decision in Strain, the appellate court then concluded that, because the question\n       was not asked, defendant\u2019s voir dire proceeding was fundamentally unfair and his\n       convictions had to be reversed. We disagree.\n\n\u00b6 27       The relevant question in this case is not whether patrons of prostitutes can be\n       made to feel ashamed if their behavior is publicized or whether prostitution evokes\n       \u201cstrong responses\u201d in the minds of the public. Rather, the question is whether\n       prospective jurors harbor such bias against those people who patronize prostitutes\n       that the jurors will not believe the testimony of such a person or be able to give that\n       person a fair hearing. It is the jurors\u2019 ability to fairly consider the evidence before\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7\u00ad\n\f       them that is the critical issue. See, e.g., Cloutier, 156 Ill. 2d at 495-96 (the purpose\n       of voir dire is to ascertain and remove those jurors whose \u201cminds are so closed by\n       bias and prejudice that they cannot apply the law as instructed in accordance with\n       their oath\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 28        This point was made clear in Strain. In Strain, the defendant was charged with\n       first degree murder. The State\u2019s theory of the case, which was advanced before\n       trial, was that the murder victim was an innocent bystander who was killed during\n       an attempted retaliation for a previous gang shooting. Strain, 194 Ill. 2d at 469-73.\n       Because gang testimony was certain to be prevalent throughout the trial, the\n       defendant asked the trial court to question the potential jurors during voir dire as to\n       whether they would find the defendant less believable if they learned he was a\n       member of a gang. Id. at 471-72. The trial court refused to ask the defendant\u2019s\n       questions, and after a trial that was \u201cpermeated\u201d with gang information (id. at 473),\n       the defendant was convicted. On appeal, the appellate court reversed the\n       defendant\u2019s conviction because the trial court had refused the proffered questions\n       and, as result, the defendant was denied a fundamentally fair voir dire proceeding.\n\n\u00b6 29       In affirming the judgment of the appellate court, this court in Strain made clear\n       that gang-related testimony was pervasive throughout the trial, being offered not\n       only by detectives and police officers assigned to gang units but also by gang\n       members themselves. Id. at 477-78. The court also emphasized that the outcome of\n       the trial turned on the credibility of the defendant, various police officers, and\n       members of gangs. Id. at 473. Finally, and of particular relevance here, the court in\n       Strain pointed to a substantial body of Illinois law that holds that street gangs are\n       regarded with considerable disfavor by other segments of our society and that,\n       unless there is sufficient proof that membership or activity in a gang relates to the\n       crime charged, evidence that a defendant is a gang member is generally excluded\n       because of its prejudicial effect. Id. at 477. We then explained that \u201c[t]he same\n       concerns regarding the prejudicial effect of gang evidence dictate our holding that,\n       when testimony regarding gang membership and gang-related activity is to be an\n       integral part of the defendant\u2019s trial, the defendant must be afforded an opportunity\n       to question the prospective jurors, either directly or through questions submitted to\n       the trial court, concerning gang bias.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8\u00ad\n\f\u00b6 30       The voir dire questions in Strain were not required because gang members feel\n       ashamed of being in a gang, or simply because gang membership provokes strong\n       feelings in the public. Instead, the questions were required because the public views\n       the testimony of gang members with skepticism and may, therefore, fail to consider\n       the testimony of a gang member without prejudice. And, importantly, this fact was\n       established by a substantial body of case law.\n\n\u00b6 31       There is no similar body of law here. None of the articles or decisions cited by\n       the appellate court below discuss how members of the general public treat the\n       testimony of those who patronize prostitutes. And none of the authorities establish\n       that the public harbors bias against the patrons of prostitutes to the extent that such\n       a person\u2019s testimony cannot be considered fairly. See 2017 IL App (1st) 142548,\n       \u00b6\u00b6 59-63 (Mason, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n\u00b6 32       Our decision in Strain is distinguishable from the present case in another\n       important respect. In Strain, there was no dispute that the majority of the witnesses\n       who testified were gang members. The defendant himself, although he denied\n       being a gang member at the time of the offense, admitted to being a gang member\n       for many years. People v. Strain, 306 Ill. App. 3d 328, 332 (1999). In other words,\n       in Strain, the gang affiliation of the witnesses was a matter that was both\n       inescapably a part of the trial and a matter that was not in dispute by either party.\n       See also, e.g., People v. Peeples, 155 Ill. 2d 422, 459-60 (1993) (noting that\n       voir dire questions regarding attitudes on race are required only where it is clear\n       that racial issues are \u201c \u2018inextricably bound up with the conduct of the trial\u2019 \u201d\n       (quoting Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U.S. 589, 597 (1976))).\n\n\u00b6 33       In this case, in contrast, it was disputed whether Y.C. and C.C. were, in fact,\n       prostitutes. Thus, defendant\u2019s proffered question did not involve a matter that was\n       indisputably true and inextricably a part of trial. Rather, the question amounted to a\n       preliminary argument regarding a disputed question of fact. This type of\n       questioning during voir dire is generally not permitted. See, e.g., Rinehart, 2012 IL\n       111719, \u00b6 17 (specific questions tailored to the facts of the case and intended to\n       serve as \u201c \u2018preliminary final argument\u2019 \u201d are generally impermissible (quoting\n       People v. Mapp, 283 Ill. App. 3d 979, 989-90 (1996))); People v. Bowel, 111 Ill. 2d\n       58, 64-65 (1986) (questions designed to educate the jurors on the defendant\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n                                                -9\u00ad\n\f       theory of defense and ensure the selected jurors are receptive to that defense are\n       generally prohibited).\n\n\u00b6 34       Further, defendant\u2019s proffered question must be considered in the context of the\n       charges made against him. Defendant was charged with, inter alia, intentionally\n       committing acts of sexual penetration upon the victim\u2019s vagina, anus, and mouth\n       while armed with a firearm. The members of the venire were informed of these\n       charges and were asked by the trial court during voir dire whether there was\n       anything about the nature of the charges that would prevent them giving both sides\n       a fair and impartial trial. Some members of the venire were excused when they\n       informed the court that, because of personal experiences with sexual assault, they\n       could not fairly consider the evidence and remain impartial. The remaining\n       members of the jury were accepted by both sides and deemed capable of\n       considering the evidence fairly and without prejudice. Thereafter, at trial, the jury\n       heard extensive, explicit testimony regarding the sexual conduct committed by\n       defendant, much of which was given by defendant himself. Even if it were true that\n       Y.C. and C.C. were prostitutes, it is difficult to conceive how a juror who could\n       fairly judge the explicit sexual conduct would be rendered incapable of fairly\n       judging defendant based on the fact he patronized prostitutes.\n\n\u00b6 35       The trial court in the case at bar conducted a thorough voir dire, asking all\n       members of the venire, among other things, whether they could follow the law and\n       obey the instructions given by the court and whether they would use sympathy,\n       bias, or prejudice in reaching a decision. Further, there is no body of law that holds\n       that the testimony of patrons of prostitutes is treated with skepticism by the public.\n       In addition, allowing defendant\u2019s proffered question would have permitted\n       defendant to preargue a disputed issue of fact. Given these circumstances, we\n       cannot say that refusing defendant\u2019s proffered question regarding prostitution\n       rendered the voir dire proceeding fundamentally unfair. Accordingly, we hold that\n       the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s question.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 10 \u00ad\n\f\u00b6 36                                   Conclusion\n\n\u00b6 37   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the appellate court is reversed.\n\n\n\u00b6 38   Appellate court judgment reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 11 \u00ad\n\f",
