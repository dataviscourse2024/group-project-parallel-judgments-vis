THOMPSON,\nJUDGES.\n\nTHOMPSON, L., JUDGE: David Scott Tate appeals from an order of the Menifee\n\nCircuit Court which denied his motion for pretrial jail-time credit. We believe\n\nfurther proceedings are necessary; therefore, we reverse and remand.\n\f                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n                On February 23, 2017, Appellant was indicted on one count of\n\noperating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other intoxicants1\n\nand murder.2 The charges arose after he caused an accident while driving\n\nintoxicated. On March 9, 2017, Appellant was arraigned and released on bond.\n\nOne of the conditions of the bond was that Appellant was placed on house arrest.\n\nHe could only leave his house to attend doctor appointments, appointments with\n\nhis lawyer, or court dates. One of the reasons Appellant was placed on house\n\narrest was due to significant injuries he sustained in the car accident and the\n\nconcern that local jails might have trouble accommodating such injuries.\n\n                On January 14, 2019, Appellant entered a guilty plea. Pursuant to a\n\nplea agreement, Appellant pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter.3 The\n\ndriving under the influence charge was dismissed. As part of the plea agreement,\n\nAppellant agreed to give up any pretrial jail-time credit he received while on house\n\narrest. In total, Appellant spent 735 days on house arrest. Appellant was then\n\nsentenced, pursuant to the agreement, to ten years in prison.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 189A.010.\n2\n    KRS 507.020.\n3\n    KRS 507.040.\n\n                                                -2-\n\f                 Beginning in late 2020, Appellant began seeking pretrial custody\n\ncredits from the Kentucky Department of Corrections and the Kentucky Justice and\n\nPublic Safety Cabinet. He argued that the time he spent on pretrial house arrest\n\nentitled him to jail-time credit. These credit requests were denied.\n\n                 On June 2, 2021, Appellant, through counsel, filed a motion with the\n\nMenifee Circuit Court seeking pretrial custody credits. The Commonwealth\n\nopposed the motion arguing that Appellant was not under a home incarceration\n\nprogram as contemplated by the relevant statutes because he was not wearing a\n\nGPS monitor.4 The Commonwealth also argued that Appellant was not entitled to\n\njail-time credit because he waived said credits as part of his plea agreement. The\n\ntrial court denied the motion, but did not give a reason for doing so. This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n                 KRS 431.517(1) states that \u201chome incarceration may be ordered as a\n\nform of pretrial release, subject to the conditions imposed by the provisions of\n\nKRS 532.200 to 532.250.\u201d Also, KRS 532.120 states in relevant part:\n\n                 (3) Time spent in custody prior to the commencement of\n                 a sentence as a result of the charge that culminated in the\n                 sentence shall be credited by the Department of\n                 Corrections toward service of the maximum term of\n                 imprisonment in cases involving a felony sentence and\n                 by the sentencing court in all other cases. If the sentence\n\n4\n    These statutes will be discussed further below.\n\n                                                  -3-\n\f            is to an indeterminate term of imprisonment, the time\n            spent in custody prior to the commencement of the\n            sentence shall be considered for all purposes as time\n            served in prison.\n\n            ....\n\n            (7) As used in subsections (3) and (4) of this section,\n            time spent in custody shall include time spent in pretrial\n            home incarceration pursuant to KRS 431.517, subject to\n            the conditions imposed by KRS 532.245.\n\nIn addition, the current version of KRS 532.245 states:\n\n            (1) Time spent in pretrial home incarceration pursuant to\n            KRS 431.517 shall be credited against the maximum\n            term of imprisonment assessed to the defendant upon\n            conviction. Notwithstanding KRS 532.200, a defendant\n            who spent time in pretrial home incarceration pursuant to\n            KRS 431.517 shall not be required to have participated in\n            a global positioning monitoring system program [GPS] to\n            receive credit. Time credited under this section shall be\n            calculated in accordance with KRS 532.120.\n\n            (2) Violation of the terms of pretrial home incarceration\n            shall be deemed an interruption of the defendant\u2019s home\n            incarceration. The interruption shall begin at the time of\n            the violation and shall continue until a court revokes\n            home incarceration or otherwise acts on the violation.\n            Time spent in pretrial home incarceration prior to the\n            violation shall be credited against the maximum term of\n            imprisonment assessed to the defendant upon conviction\n            for the original charge.\n\n            (3) This section shall apply to defendants sentenced on or\n            after July 12, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fAt the time Appellant filed the motion seeking jail-time credit, KRS 532.245(1)\n\ndid not have the language regarding the GPS monitoring device. The current\n\nversion of KRS 532.245(1) came into effect during the pendency of this appeal.\n\n             Appellant\u2019s argument on appeal is that he was in pretrial home\n\nincarceration pursuant to the above statutes and he is entitled to custody credit.\n\nThe Commonwealth disagrees and argues that Appellant was not on home\n\nincarceration because he was not fitted with a GPS monitoring device. The\n\nCommonwealth also argues that Appellant failed to exhaust his administrative\n\nremedies.\n\n             As to the Commonwealth\u2019s administrative remedies argument, a\n\ndefendant must first pursue administrative remedies with the Department of\n\nCorrections before a motion can be filed with the circuit court seeking pretrial jail-\n\ntime credit. Sanders v. Commonwealth, 600 S.W.3d 266, 268 (Ky. App. 2020).\n\nThe record is clear that Appellant fulfilled his administrative duties before seeking\n\nredress with the courts. He contacted the relevant administrative departments\n\nseeking his credits.\n\n             The main issue on appeal is whether Appellant was on home\n\nincarceration pursuant to the above statutes. As previously mentioned, the\n\nCommonwealth argued at the trial level that Appellant was not on home\n\nincarceration because KRS 532.200(2) states that home incarceration requires the\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fuse of a monitoring device, such as a GPS. Appellant was not required to wear a\n\nGPS device while on house arrest. We believe it is most likely that the trial court\n\ndenied Appellant\u2019s motion for jail-time credits based on the lack of GPS monitor\n\nas that was the most straightforward issue and was determinative of the motion.\n\nThe trial court was correct in its ruling at the time. The problem arises that while\n\nthe appeal was pending, KRS 532.245 was amended and the use of a GPS monitor\n\nis no longer required in order for a defendant to receive jail-time credit while on\n\nhome incarceration prior to trial. We must determine if the current version of KRS\n\n532.245 applies to Appellant.\n\n             As the proper interpretation of a statute is purely a legal issue, our\n\nreview is de novo. Commonwealth v. Long, 118 S.W.3d 178, 181 (Ky. App. 2003)\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n                    The right to jail-time credit is derived purely from\n             statute. As such, it is governed by and interpreted\n             according to legislative intent. As with any case\n             involving statutory interpretation, our duty is to ascertain\n             and give effect to the intent of the General Assembly.\n             The Legislature is presumed to be aware of the existing\n             law at the time of enactment of a later statute and,\n             therefore, intent can be readily ascertained from both\n             maintenance and alteration of a statute.\n\nSanders, 600 S.W.3d at 270 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n             The current version of KRS 532.245(3) states that it applies to\n\n\u201cdefendants sentenced on or after July 12, 2012.\u201d This language did not change\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\ffrom the previous version of the statute. The question then becomes does the new\n\nlanguage, where a defendant is no longer required to have GPS monitoring, apply\n\nto defendants sentenced after July 12, 2012, or does it only apply to defendants\n\nsentenced after the effective date of the current version, July 14, 2022? The\n\nlegislature chose not to change KRS 532.245(3) when enacting the new version of\n\nthe statute, the new GPS monitoring provision applies to all defendants sentenced\n\nafter July 12, 2012. That means Appellant was not required to have a GPS monitor\n\nfor him to receive jail-time credit for home incarceration.\n\n             However, because the relevant statute has changed and the trial court\n\ndid not need to fully examine all the requirements for home incarceration at the\n\ntime it ruled on Appellant\u2019s motion, we must remand this case to the trial court.\n\nThe court must determine if Appellant\u2019s house arrest met the conditions of home\n\nincarceration.\n\n             The conditions of home incarceration shall include the\n             following:\n\n                   (1) The home incarceree shall be confined to his\n                       home at all times except when:\n\n                          (a) Working at approved employment or\n                              traveling directly to and from such\n                              employment;\n\n                          (b) Seeking employment;\n\n                          (c) Undergoing available medical,\n                              psychiatric, or mental health treatment or\n\n                                         -7-\n\f          approved counseling and after care\n          programs;\n\n      (d) Attending an approved educational\n          institution or program;\n\n      (e) Attending a regularly scheduled religious\n          service at a place of worship; and\n\n      (f) Participating in an approved community\n          work service program;\n\n(2) Violation of subsection (1) of this section may\nsubject the home incarceree to prosecution under\nKRS 520.030 (escape);\n\n(3) The home incarceree shall conform to a\nschedule prepared by a designated officer of the\nsupervising authority specifically setting forth the\ntimes when he may be absent from the home and\nthe locations where he may be during those times;\n\n(4) The home incarceree shall not commit another\noffense during the period of time for which he is\nsubject to the conditions of home incarceration;\n\n(5) The home incarceree shall not change the place\nof home incarceration or the schedule without\nprior approval of the supervising authority;\n\n(6) The home incarceree shall maintain a telephone\nor other approved monitoring device in the home\nor on his person at all times;\n\n(7) Any other reasonable conditions set by the\ncourt or the supervising authority including:\n\n      (a) Restitution under KRS 533.030;\n\n\n\n\n                     -8-\n\f                           (b) Supervision fees under KRS 439.315;\n                               and\n\n                           (c) Any of the conditions imposed on\n                               persons on probation or conditional\n                               discharge under KRS 533.030(2);\n\n                    (8) A written and notarized consent agreement\n                    shall be filed with the court by every adult who\n                    will share the offender\u2019s home during the term of\n                    home incarceration; and\n\n                    (9) Any supervision fee or other monetary\n                    condition, except restitution, shall be paid by the\n                    defendant directly to the person or organization\n                    specified by the court in a written order, except\n                    that any such fees or monetary conditions owed to\n                    the Department of Corrections shall be paid\n                    through the circuit clerk.\n\nKRS 532.220.\n\n             Finally, we must address the fact that Appellant\u2019s plea agreement\n\nstated that he was waiving any pretrial jail-time credits he was entitled to.\n\nAppellant claims waiving these credits would amount to an illegal sentence\n\nbecause the credits are mandatory. We agree. \u201c[T]he general rule that a judgment\n\nrendered by a court in a criminal case must conform strictly to the statute, and that\n\nany variation from its provisions, either in the character or the extent of\n\npunishment inflicted, renders the judgment absolutely void.\u201d Weems v. United\n\nStates, 217 U.S. 349, 381-82, 30 S.Ct. 544, 555, 54 L. Ed. 793 (1910). Our\n\nKentucky Supreme Court has also held that criminal punishments that go against\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fstatutes or are in excess of the lawful range of punishment are not permitted.\n\nMcClanahan v. Commonwealth, 308 S.W.3d 694, 698 (Ky. 2010).\n\n             Here, Appellant pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter. This\n\nis a Class C felony. KRS 507.040(2). Class C felonies cannot exceed ten years in\n\nprison. KRS 532.060(2)(c). Appellant was sentenced to ten years in prison, but he\n\nwas on house arrest for over two years. If Appellant was on home incarceration as\n\nhe claims, then he would have a twelve-year sentence. This is not permitted. In\n\naddition, KRS 532.120(3) and KRS 532.245(1) state that a defendant \u201cshall\u201d\n\nreceive jail-time credit for time spent on home incarceration. \u201cShall\u201d is\n\nmandatory. KRS 446.010(39). The requirement in Appellant\u2019s plea agreement\n\nthat he must waive his pretrial jail-time credits is void. The rest of the plea\n\nagreement is valid and this Opinion should not be read to in any way vacate or\n\nreverse Appellant\u2019s sentence.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n             Based on the foregoing, we reverse and remand. On remand, the trial\n\ncourt shall determine if Appellant was on home incarceration pursuant to the\n\nrelevant statutes. The court should also keep in mind that Appellant could not\n\nlawfully waive his ability to receive jail-time credit for home incarceration.\n\n\n\n             ALL CONCUR.\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fBRIEFS FOR APPELLANT:        BRIEFS FOR APPELLEE:\n\nDavid Scott Tate, pro se     Daniel Cameron\nPineville, Kentucky          Attorney General of Kentucky\n\n                             Matthew R.
