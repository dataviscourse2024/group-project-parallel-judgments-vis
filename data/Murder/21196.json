He appeals here, contending that (1) the jury should have been\n\ninstructed that a State\u2019s witness was an accomplice as a matter of law, (2) the State\n\ndid not present sufficient evidence to corroborate the accomplice\u2019s testimony, and\n\f(3) the written consent appellant\u2019s father gave allowing police to search the\n\nresidence and the vehicle appellant was driving the night of the murder was\n\ninvoluntary and invalid. We affirm.\n\n                                 BACKGROUND\n\n      On April 3, 2011, the body of seventeen-year-old Bridgett Frisbie was\n\ndiscovered by a group of children in the woods behind a housing development in\n\nKaty, Texas. Neighbors reported hearing a gunshot early that morning (around\n\n2:45 am), and reported to police that there had recently been a drive-by shooting in\n\nthe area. The medical examiner testified that Bridgett had been shot in the back of\n\nthe head at close range.\n\n      Early in the investigation, Investigator James Cassidy learned that Alan\n\nPerez had come forward with information about the case. On the evening of April\n\n5, 2011, Perez told his mother that he gone with appellant to help scare, or \u201crough\n\nup\u201d Bridgett, but that appellant had shot her without warning. Perez\u2019s family hired\n\nan attorney who negotiated an immunity agreement for Perez in exchange for his\n\nstatement and testimony.\n\n      According to the testimony of several witnesses, including Perez, appellant\n\nwas upset with Bridgett because she would not keep quiet about a drive-by\n\nshooting she participated in with appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fA.    Perez\u2019s testimony\n\n      Perez and appellant met in high school. They joined the National Guard\n\ntogether, but when appellant returned from basic training, he started attending a\n\ndifferent school.    According to Perez, Bridgett was one of the new friends\n\nappellant made at his new school.\n\n      Perez testified that Bridgett had been bragging about participating in a drive-\n\nby shooting with a friend, and that appellant had later told Perez that he was the\n\nshooter. Specifically, appellant told Perez that Bridgett \u201cdrove and he shot at her\n\nex-boyfriend\u2019s house with his Yugo semiautomatic rifle.\u201d\n\n      Perez testified that, on the evening of April 2, 2011, appellant asked him for\n\na favor. Appellant explained that he wanted to \u201crough up\u201d Bridgett for telling\n\nfriends about the drive-by, and he wanted Perez there as backup.          Appellant\n\ninstructed Perez to \u201cget his gear\u201d and bring a weapon. Perez brought a .380 pistol\n\nand wore his green military uniform, mask, and gloves. Appellant wore his 9mm\n\nBeretta pistol in a shoulder holster under his jacket.\n\n      According to Perez, they went to appellant\u2019s house after midnight.\n\nAppellant then called Bridgett and asked her to ride with him to pick up her\n\nboyfriend, Zach Richards, from the bus station. Bridgett declined, saying that she\n\nwas busy. Appellant decided to go to Bridgett\u2019s house, and told Perez to hide\n\nunder a blanket in the back of his Suburban. If appellant was successful in luring\n\n\n                                           3\n\fBridgett into the vehicle, appellant instructed Perez to get out and follow appellant\n\nand Bridgett at a distance when they reached their destination.\n\n      Bridgett was leaving on her four-wheeler to go meet friends when they got\n\nto her house, so they left. They set out again to find her a little later and found her\n\npushing her four-wheeler because it had run out of gas. Appellant asked her to\n\nhelp him \u201cdig up a cache of some random thing.\u201d She initially said \u201cno,\u201d but\n\neventually he talked her into going with him. She put her four-wheeler in the\n\ngarage and climbed into the passenger seat of appellant\u2019s Suburban.\n\n      Perez was still hiding in the back of the vehicle under blankets. Appellant\n\ndrove to the same neighborhood where he and Bridgett had done the drive-by\n\nshooting. Appellant and Bridgett got out of the vehicle, and Perez waited a minute\n\nand then got out and followed them. Perez saw appellant carrying a shovel and\n\nkind of leading Bridgett with a flashlight. Appellant pointed out a spot and asked\n\nBridgett to start digging. As she bent over to dig, Perez saw appellant reach into\n\nhis jacket, pull out his gun, put it to the back of Bridgett\u2019s neck, and fire.\n\n      Perez testified that he was shocked because he \u201cthought [appellant] might\n\nthreaten her, might poke her with the gun, but he had just shot her.\u201d Appellant ran\n\ntowards Perez, and Perez \u201ccursed at him for a bit.\u201d Appellant told Perez to shut up\n\nand run towards the car. Appellant returned to Bridgett\u2019s body to retrieve his\n\nshovel, flashlight, and Bridgett\u2019s cell phone. They drove to a \u201cwater tunnel\u201d near\n\n\n                                            4\n\fPerez\u2019s house where Perez, and then appellant, tried to destroy Bridgett\u2019s phone by\n\nbanging it with the shovel. Appellant hid the phone in the water tunnel, and they\n\nreturned to appellant\u2019s house. They took everything out of the Suburban and left it\n\nin appellant\u2019s room.\n\n       Appellant and Perez then went about 4:00 a.m. to pick up Richards at the\n\nbus station. Appellant offered to let Richards stay the night at his house, so they\n\nwent back to appellant\u2019s house and all went to sleep. They did not say anything to\n\nRichards about the murder, but appellant told Perez that they should be each\n\nother\u2019s alibi, and that Perez should tell the police that he \u201chad stayed at\n\n[appellant\u2019s] house, hung out, watched movies and then went to pick up\u201d Richards.\n\n       A couple of days later, appellant\u2019s mom picked up both Perez and appellant\n\nand took them back to appellant\u2019s house. Appellant\u2019s mom had heard about\n\nBridgett\u2019s murder and asked them numerous questions.          When they got the\n\nopportunity to be alone, appellant told Perez that he was going to get rid of his\n\nBeretta and to stick to their alibi story.\n\n       Perez went home that night and told his parents what had happened. Perez\n\nturned over his gun and the clothes he wore the night of the murder to police. He\n\nalso led police to Bridgett\u2019s destroyed phone.\n\n       Perez identified a picture of appellant\u2019s Beretta at trial. When a September\n\n2010 YouTube video of appellant shooting at a gun range entitled \u201cMe and My\n\n\n                                             5\n\fBeretta 9 millimeter\u201d was played for the jury, Perez testified that he had filmed the\n\nvideo for appellant on appellant\u2019s cell phone. Perez testified that the gun in the\n\nvideo was the same one that appellant used to shoot Bridgett.\n\nB.    Additional State\u2019s Evidence\n\n      1.     Zach Richards\u2019s testimony\n\n      Bridgett\u2019s boyfriend, Richards, testified that in March of 2011 appellant\n\nstated that he was \u201cgoing to deal with something,\u201d grabbed his AK-47, and left\n\nwith Bridgett in Bridgett\u2019s car. Appellant told Richards later that he had shot at\n\nBridgett\u2019s ex-boyfriend\u2019s house from Bridgett\u2019s car while Bridgett drove past.\n\nAppellant told Richards that he participated in the drive by \u201cto do a favor for\u201d\n\nBridgett and just because \u201che could do it.\u201d Richards testified that Bridgett kept\n\nbragging about the shooting and that appellant angrily confronted her and told her\n\nto stop telling people.\n\n      On April 3, 2011, appellant had agreed to bring Bridgett to the Houston bus\n\nstation to pick up Richards about 1:00 a.m. When appellant did not show up,\n\nRichards got a ride to a Denny\u2019s and finally reached appellant by phone about 2:30\n\nor 3:00 a.m. Appellant told him that he was at home, but would come pick him up.\n\nAppellant finally arrived several hours late and Perez was with him.          When\n\nRichards asked about Bridgett, appellant told him that he tried to get in contact\n\nwith her and went by her house, but that he could not find her.\n\n\n                                         6\n\f      After getting some sleep at appellant\u2019s house, Richards walked to Bridgett\u2019s\n\nhouse. Her dad answered the door said that Bridgett had been out all night and that\n\nhe did not know where she was. Richards tried to locate her through friends over\n\nthe next couple of days until he heard the news that her body had been found.\n\n      Richards testified that he had been to the woods where Bridgett was shot\n\nwith both appellant and Bridgett, so appellant was familiar with the area.\n\nAppellant had also taken Richards to the water tunnels where Bridgett\u2019s phone was\n\nfound so they could shoot appellant\u2019s AK-47. Finally, Richards testified that it\n\nwas common for appellant to have a gun with him.\n\n      2.     Robert Frisbie\n\n      Robert Frisbie, Bridgett\u2019s father, testified that he last saw his daughter on\n\nApril 2, 2011. On that day, he bought her a new rave outfit\u2014blue-green faux-fur\n\nleggings, skirt and top. Appellant came by their house after they returned home\n\nfrom shopping, and Frisbie saw him having a tense conversation with Bridgett at\n\nthe back door. Bridgett did not leave with appellant at that time.\n\n      Sometime after appellant left, another of Bridgett\u2019s friends, Kendall Suto,\n\ncame over for dinner and stayed for the evening. Frisbie drove Bridgett and\n\nKendall to a rave party, but it was closed and they eventually returned home a little\n\nafter 10:00 p.m. Kendall\u2019s ride was not supposed to pick him up until midnight, so\n\nBridgett and Kendall settled in to watch a movie. Bridgett was still wearing her\n\n\n                                          7\n\fnew rave outfit when Frisbie went to bed and set his alarm for midnight. He called\n\ndownstairs when he woke up, but Bridgett said that Kendall\u2019s ride had not arrived\n\nyet. Frisbie told Bridgett to wake him when Kendall left so that he could lock up\n\nthe house. When Frisbie awoke again about 3:00 am, he found the back door and\n\nthe garage door open. He locked up so that Bridgett could not sneak back in\n\nwithout his knowledge. Then he realized that his cell phone was missing. He had\n\ntaken away Bridgett\u2019s phone recently, so he assumed that she took his when she\n\nwent out.\n\n      Frisbie called his cell phone repeatedly and looked online to track the\n\nphone\u2019s GPS location. After he was unable to reach her or ascertain the location of\n\nthe phone, he gave up and decided to wait for her to return. He was unable to\n\nlocate her the following day, despite calling several of her friends. Later the\n\nevening of April 3, he read online about a body being found nearby, and he called\n\npolice and discovered it was Bridgett.\n\n      3.     Physical Evidence\n\n      Appellant was arrested, and Samuel Olivieri, appellant\u2019s father, gave\n\nconsent for the police to search their house and appellant\u2019s Suburban. Neither the\n\nAK-47 nor the Baretta were found. But the police did recover an owner\u2019s manual\n\nfor a Beretta .9 millimeter.\n\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f      In appellant\u2019s Suburban, police recovered a blanket, a shovel, and rifle and\n\nshotgun shell casings, as well as trace evidence samples\u2014including fibers\u2014from\n\nthe passenger\u2019s seat and floor board. Ballistics testing revealed that the shell\n\ncasing from the Suburban matched the shell casing recovered from the drive-by\n\nshooting at Larsen\u2019s house.      Fibers lifted from the passenger seat of the car\n\nmatched Bridgett\u2019s new rave faux fur outfit that she was wearing when her father\n\nlast saw her on the night of April 2.\n\n      4.     Officer J. Cassidy\u2019s Investigation\n\n      Officer Cassidy testified that Bridgett was still wearing the new faux fur\n\noutfit when her body was discovered, and that there was a .9 millimeter casing\n\nfound near her body. He interviewed appellant early on in his investigation, before\n\nappellant was considered a suspect. The tape of that interview was played for the\n\njury. In that statement, appellant said that he went by Bridgett\u2019s house about 5:00\n\np.m. on April 2. He said that he and Perez came back later that night to pick her up\n\non the way to the bus station to get Richards, but that she was not waiting outside\n\nso he left without ever seeing her. Appellant also denied having any knowledge\n\nabout handguns.\n\nC.    Defendant\u2019s Evidence\n\n      Appellant\u2019s father, Samuel Olivieri testified that he had previously owned a\n\n9 mm Beretta, but that he sold it in 2003. He testified that, when he went to bed\n\n\n                                         9\n\fabout 10:00 or 10:30 on April 2, appellant and Perez were there playing a video\n\ngame. When he woke up the next morning, Richards was there too, asleep on an\n\nair mattress.\n\n      Appellant\u2019s mother, Angelica Olivieri, testified that Perez was over at their\n\nhouse the evening of April 2 playing video games with appellant. Around 10:30,\n\nPerez asked her if he could spend the night and she told him he could sleep on the\n\ncouch. She testified that appellant then went to bed in his room about 11:30 p.m.,\n\nand that his door squeaked so loudly that she would always hear if he opened or\n\nclosed his bedroom door. At about 12:45 a.m., she got up to get a drink of water\n\nand noticed that Perez was gone from the couch. She got up again at 2:10 a.m. and\n\nlooked in on her mom, her daughter, and appellant. She testified that appellant was\n\nasleep at that time. A little after 3:00 a.m., she heard appellant get up and he came\n\nand told her that he was going to pick up Richards. Perez was with him at that\n\npoint. When she got up again, she found appellant, Perez, and Richards all asleep.\n\nD.    The Jury Charge and Verdict\n\n      Appellant requested that the jury be instructed that Perez was an accomplice\n\nas a matter of law, and that a conviction could not be had on his uncorroborated\n\ntestimony. Instead, the court left it to the jury to resolve whether Perez was an\n\naccomplice, charging the jury as follows:\n\n           [A] conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an\n      accomplice unless the accomplice\u2019s testimony is corroborated by\n\n                                         10\n\f      other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the offense\n      charged, and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the\n      commission of the offense, but it must tend to connect the defendant\n      with its commission.\n\n             Therefore, if you believe from the evidence beyond a\n      reasonable doubt that an offense was committed and you further\n      believe from the evidence that the witness, Alan Perez, was an\n      accomplice, or you have a reasonable doubt whether he was or not, as\n      that term is defined in the foregoing instructions, then you cannot\n      convict the defendant upon the testimony of Alan Perez unless you\n      further believe that there is other evidence in the case, outside of the\n      testimony of Alan Perez tending to connect the defendant with the\n      offense charged in the indictment, and then from all the evidence you\n      must believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.\n      The jury found the defendant guilty of murder, and assessed punishment at\n\nsixty years\u2019 confinement.\n\n                             ISSUES ON APPEAL\n\n      Appellant brings three issues on appeal:\n\n      (1)   \u201cThe trial court committed reversible error in denying defense\n            counsel\u2019s request to instruct the jury that Alan Perez was an\n            accomplice witness as a matter of law.\u201d\n      (2)   \u201cInsufficient evidence was presented to corroborate the\n            testimony of Alan Perez, an accomplice witness.\u201d\n\n      (3)   \u201cThe consent to search provided to law enforcement by Samuel\n            Olivieri was not given voluntarily and was therefore invalid.\u201d\n\n\n\n                         ACCOMPLICE TESTIMONY\n\n      In his first and second issues, appellant argues that Perez was an accomplice\n\nas a matter of law, and that there was not sufficient evidence to corroborate his\n\n                                        11\n\faccomplice-witness testimony. The State responds that it was proper for the trial\n\ncourt to submit the fact issue of whether Perez was an accomplice to the jury and\n\nthat, in any event, there was ample independent corroborating evidence that would\n\nrender harmless the failure to so instruct.\n\n   A. Applicable Law and Standard of Review\n\n      An accomplice is a person who participates in an offense, before, during, or\n\nafter the commission of a crime and acts with the required culpable mental state.\n\nParedes v. State, 129 S.W.3d 530, 536 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004); Herron v. State, 86\n\nS.W.3d 621, 631 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). To participate in an offense, the witness\n\nmust affirmatively act to promote the commission of the offense. Paredes, 129\n\nS.W.3d at 536.\n\n      A witness is not an accomplice simply because he knew of the offense and\n\ndid not disclose it. Blake v. State, 971 S.W.2d 451, 454 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998);\n\nKunkle v. State, 771 S.W.2d 435, 439 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986). Evidence showing\n\nthat a witness was present during the commission of the crime and participated in\n\nconcealing the crime is not necessarily sufficient to raise the issue of accomplice-\n\nwitness status. Smith v. State, 721 S.W.2d 844, 851 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986)\n\n(\u201cSince there was no evidence adduced at trial to show anything other than\n\nThompson\u2019s presence at the scene of the offense and his aid in carrying the body to\n\nappellant\u2019s truck, we hold that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the\n\n\n                                          12\n\fjury that he was an accomplice witness.\u201d); see also Gomez v. State, 737 S.W.2d\n\n315, 322 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987) (\u201cIf a State\u2019s witness has no complicity in the\n\noffense for which an accused is on trial, his or her testimony is not that of an\n\naccomplice witness whatever may have been his complicity with the accused in the\n\ncommission of other offenses.\u201d (citations omitted)).\n\n      If the evidence creates a fact issue or is conflicting regarding whether a\n\nwitness was an accomplice, the witness may be an accomplice as a matter of fact\n\nand the issue should be submitted to the jury. See Blake, 971 S.W.2d at 455; see\n\nalso Meeks v. State, 135 S.W.3d 104, 110 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2004, pet.\n\nref\u2019d). The trial court is under no duty to instruct the jury unless there exists no\n\ndoubt or the evidence clearly shows that a witness is an accomplice as a matter of\n\nlaw. Paredes, 129 S.W.3d at 536. If the evidence presented by the parties is\n\nconflicting and it is not clear whether the witness is an accomplice, then the trial\n\ncourt must leave to the jury the question of whether the inculpatory witness is an\n\naccomplice witness as a matter of fact under instructions defining the term\n\n\u201caccomplice.\u201d Id.\n\n      If, however, the evidence clearly shows that a witness is an accomplice, then\n\nthe witness is an accomplice as a matter of law, and the trial court has the duty to\n\ninstruct the jury of this fact and of the necessity of corroborative evidence. See\n\nDeBlanc v. State, 799 S.W.2d 701, 708 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990). A prosecution\n\n\n                                        13\n\fwitness who is indicted for the same offense for which the defendant is charged or\n\na lesser included offense arising out of the same criminal episode is an accomplice\n\nas a matter of law. Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 631; cf. Paredes, 129 S.W.3d at 536\n\n(accomplice as a matter of law is one who is susceptible to prosecution for offense\n\nfor which defendant is charged or lesser-included offense).           If a prosecution\n\nwitness is an accomplice as a matter of law, the trial court errs if it fails to instruct\n\nthe jury accordingly. Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 631. The critical question for the court\n\nof appeals is not whether the alleged accomplice has been charged, but whether\n\nthere is sufficient evidence in the record to support a charge. Blake, 971 S.W.2d at\n\n455.\n\n       When error regarding the trial court\u2019s failure to submit an accomplice\n\nwitness instruction is properly preserved, reversal is required if \u201csome harm\u201d is\n\nshown. Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 632. Nonaccomplice testimony can render harmless\n\na failure to submit an accomplice witness instruction by fulfilling the purpose an\n\naccomplice witness instruction is designed to serve. Id. A harmless error analysis\n\nfor the omission of an accomplice witness instruction should be flexible, taking\n\ninto account the existence and strength of any nonaccomplice evidence. Id. An\n\nappellate court examines the strength of nonaccomplice witness testimony by: (1)\n\nits reliability or believability; and (2) the strength of its tendency to connect the\n\ndefendant to the crime. Id. The reliability inquiry may be satisfied if: (1) there is\n\n\n                                           14\n\fnonaccomplice witness evidence; and (2) there is no rational or articulable basis\n\nfor disregarding the nonaccomplice evidence or finding that it fails to connect the\n\ndefendant to the offense. Id. at 633.\n\nE.    Analysis\n\n      We need not reach whether it was error to refuse appellant\u2019s requested\n\ninstruction that Perez was an accomplice as a matter of law because we conclude\n\nthat the nonaccomplice evidence is sufficient to render any error harmless.\n\nApplying the approach mandated by the Court of Criminal Appeals, we must\n\nevaluate the existence and strength of the nonaccomplice witness testimony. There\n\nis no bright-line rule, and nonaccomplice evidence is not viewed piecemeal.\n\nInstead, we look at the combined force of the nonaccomplice evidence, including\n\nmotive, opportunity, demeanor and actions before and after the offense. Smith v.\n\nState, 332 S.W.3d 425, 442 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). \u201c[A]s the corroborating\n\nevidence gains in strength to the point that it becomes implausible that a jury\n\nwould fail to find that it tends to connect the accused to the commission of the\n\ncharged offense, then a reviewing court may safely conclude that the only resultant\n\nharm is purely theoretical and that there is no occasion to reverse the conviction,\n\neven in the face of an objection, since the jury would almost certainly have found\n\nthat the accomplice witness\u2019s testimony was corroborated had it been properly\n\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\finstructed that it must do so in order to convict.\u201d Casanova v. State, 383 S.W.3d\n\n530, 539\u201340 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012).\n\n      Here, a review of the nonaccomplice evidence demonstrates that any error in\n\nrefusing to instruct the jury that Perez was an accomplice was harmless. See id.\n\nEvidence of motive or opportunity is insufficient alone to corroborate accomplice\n\ntestimony, but may be considered in connection with other evidence tending to\n\nconnect the accused with the crime. Reed v. State, 744 S.W.2d 112, 127 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1988). Here, the jury heard Richards\u2019s testimony about appellant\u2019s\n\nmotive, i.e., appellant\u2019s desire to keep Bridgett quiet about the drive-by shooting.\n\nAs for opportunity, Richards testified to having been, with appellant, both to the\n\nspot in the woods where Bridgett was shot and to the water tunnel where Bridgett\u2019s\n\nphone was found to shoot appellant\u2019s AK-47.           The jury heard evidence that\n\nBridgett and appellant were friends, and that appellant had an excuse to get\n\nBridgett into his vehicle in the early morning hours of April 3. Finally, Richards\n\ntestified that appellant was several hours late in picking him up on the morning of\n\nApril 3. The fact that neither the .9 mm or AK-47 were found at appellant\u2019s house,\n\ntaken in conjunction with Richard\u2019s testimony that appellant often carried his AK-\n\n47, supports the inference that appellant recently got rid of his guns.\n\n      Most importantly, Bridgett\u2019s father, Frisbie, confirmed that the outfit\n\nBridgett was wearing when she was killed had been purchased on April 2. He\n\n\n                                          16\n\ftestified that she was wearing that outfit and at home until midnight on that day\n\nwatching a movie with a friend. Analysis of fibers from appellant\u2019s Suburban\n\nmatched Bridgett\u2019s new outfit, leading to the logical inference that she was in\n\nappellant\u2019s vehicle after midnight that night (despite appellant\u2019s denial that he had\n\nseen her that evening). Neighbors near where she was murdered heard a single\n\ngunshot about 2:45 a.m. Richards testified that appellant was supposed to pick him\n\nup at 1:00 a.m. on the morning of April 3, but that appellant and Perez were several\n\nhours late picking him up. Bridgett\u2019s murder occurred during that delay.\n\n      Not only does the combined force of this nonaccomplice testimony strongly\n\nimplicate appellant and corroborate Perez\u2019s testimony by linking appellant to the\n\ncrime, there is no rational and articulable basis for disregarding any of this\n\nnonaccomplice evidence. Herron, 86 S.W.3d at 632. Because we conclude there\n\nis sufficient evidence corroborating Perez\u2019s testimony, any error in the trial court\u2019s\n\nsubmitting the issue of whether Perez was an accomplice as a fact question instead\n\nof as a matter of law was harmless.\n\n      We overrule appellant\u2019s first and second points of errors.\n\n                            CONSENT TO SEARCH\n\n      In conjunction with the warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest, police obtained a\n\nsearch warrant for appellant\u2019s family\u2019s residence. When police arrived to execute\n\nthe warrants, they received written consent from appellant\u2019s father, Samuel\n\n\n                                         17\n\fOlivieri, to search both the house and the family\u2019s Suburban.1 The consent form,\n\nentitled \u201cVoluntary Consent for Search and Seizure,\u201d states that the constitutional\n\nright to refuse consent had been explained, and that the consent was given freely\n\nand voluntarily. The form was signed and dated by Samuel and contained witness\n\nsignatures of Deputy J. Cassidy and Deputy Fisher.\n\n        Before trial, appellant moved to suppress evidence from the search of the\n\nSuburban, arguing that the consent was not voluntary. Deputy Cassidy testified\n\nthat he provided Olivieri the form, gave him an opportunity to wake up and get his\n\nbearings, allowed him to read the form in its entirety, and asked him if he\n\nunderstood the form. Olivieri, on the other hand, testified that officers told him\n\nthat he needed to sign the form because they had a search warrant for the house.\n\nHe stated that he did not read the form at the time, and no one told him that he did\n\nnot have to sign it.\n\n      The trial court found the consent to be voluntary and denied appellant\u2019s\n\nmotion to suppress the evidence from the Suburban.\n\n      A.     Applicable law and Standard of Review\n\n      We review a ruling on a motion to suppress for an abuse of discretion.\n\nShepherd v. State, 273 S.W.3d 681, 684 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). We give almost\n\ntotal deference to a trial court\u2019s determination of historical facts, especially if those\n\n1\n      The title to the Suburban is in Samuel\u2019s name, but appellant was allowed to drive\n      it at times.\n                                           18\n\fdeterminations turn on witness credibility or demeanor, and review de novo the\n\ntrial court\u2019s application of the law to facts not based on an evaluation of credibility\n\nand demeanor. Neal v. State, 256 S.W.3d 264, 281 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). At a\n\nsuppression hearing, the trial court is the sole and exclusive trier of fact and judge\n\nof the witnesses\u2019 credibility. Maxwell v. State, 73 S.W.3d 278, 281 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2002). Because issues of consent are necessarily fact intensive, a trial court\u2019s\n\nfinding of voluntariness must be accepted on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous.\n\nMeekins v. State, 340 S.W.3d 454, 460 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).\n\n      A voluntary consensual search is an exception to the probable cause and\n\nwarrant requirements of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution\n\nand article I, section 9 of the Texas Constitution. Guevara v. State, 97 S.W.3d\n\n579, 582 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003); Reasor v. State, 12 S.W.3d 813, 817 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2000). \u201cThe validity of a consensual search is a question of fact, and the\n\nState bears the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that consent was\n\nobtained voluntarily.\u201d Gutierrez v. State, 221 S.W.3d 680, 686 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2007). \u201c[C]ourts review the totality of the circumstances of a particular police-\n\ncitizen interaction from the point of view of the objectively reasonable person,\n\nwithout regard for the subjective thoughts or intents of either the officer or the\n\ncitizen.\u201d Meekins, 340 S.W.3d at 459 (citing Maryland v. Macon, 472 U.S. 463,\n\n470\u201371, 105 S. Ct. 2778, 2783 (1985)). \u201cThe ultimate question is whether the\n\n\n                                          19\n\fperson\u2019s \u2018will ha[s] been overborne and his capacity for self-determination\n\ncritically impaired,\u2019 such that his consent to search must have been involuntary.\u201d\n\nId. (quoting United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 424, 96 S. Ct. 820, 828\n\n(1976)).\n\n       In this analysis of voluntariness courts may consider numerous factors,\n\nincluding: physical mistreatment, use of violence, threats, threats of violence,\n\npromises or inducements, deception or trickery, and the physical and mental\n\ncondition and capacity of the defendant within the totality of the circumstances.\n\nId. at 460 (citing United States v. Pena, 143 F.3d 1363, 1367 (10th Cir. 1998)). We\n\nmay also consider appellant\u2019s age, education, and intelligence, the length of\n\ndetention, any constitutional advice given to the defendant, and the repetitiveness\n\nof the questioning. See Reasor, 12 S.W.3d at 818. Other relevant factors are\n\nwhether appellant was in custody, or had been arrested at gunpoint; and whether\n\nappellant was warned that he had the option to refuse to consent. Flores v. State,\n\n172 S.W.3d 742, 749 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.). In\n\nexamining the totality of the circumstances surrounding the consent to search, the\n\ntrial court should consider the circumstances before the search, reaction of the\n\naccused to pressure, and any other factor deemed relevant. Reasor, 12 S.W.3d at\n\n818.\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\f   B. Analysis\n\n      Appellant argues the following facts, taken in their totality, demonstrate that\n\nSamuel Olivieri\u2019s consent was involuntary: (1) \u201cSamuel was held at gunpoint and\n\npushed down with a shield in the midst of numerous officers,\u201d (2) \u201cSamuel was not\n\nverbally advised that he had a right to refuse consent,\u201d (3) \u201ca reasonable person\u2019s\n\nmental faculties would be affected by the time and manner of the warrant\u2019s\n\nexecution.\u201d\n\n      At the motion to suppress hearing, Olivieri testified that officers arrived at\n\nhis house around 2:30 a.m. When he came out of his bedroom, an officer with a\n\nshield pushed him and told him not to move. Either the same officer or a different\n\none pointed a gun at Olivieri and pushed him against a wall. Police then grabbed\n\nappellant, threw him on the ground, put handcuffs on him and led him away.\n\nSeveral officers then started moving around the house. Olivieri was then\n\napproached by two officers in civilian clothes to discuss searching the home and\n\nSuburban. According to Olivieri, the officers simply told him that he needed to\n\nsign the consent form. At the suppression hearing, he testified that he did not\n\nrecall being told anything specific about the form, but his understanding was that\n\nhe needed to sign the form because the police had obtained a search warrant. He\n\nclaims he did not read the form\u2014he just signed it.\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f      Officer Cassidy\u2019s testimony differed from Olivieri\u2019s. Cassidy testified to\n\nfirst meeting with Olivieri after appellant was arrested. Cassidy stated that he first\n\nallowed Olivieri to read both the consent form (dealing with the residence and the\n\nSuburban) and the search warrant (applicable to the residence) before asking for\n\nhis consent. Olivieri did not give any indication that he did not understand what he\n\nwas signing.     While Cassidy acknowledged during his testimony that the\n\ninteraction was early in the morning and that Olivieri had been woken by police, he\n\ntestified that Olivieri was given an opportunity to wake up, and that he was\n\nallowed to read the consent form in its entirety. Cassidy asked him if understood\n\nthe form, and Olivieri did not give any indication that he did not understand it.\n\nCassidy agreed with Olivieri\u2019s testimony that Cassidy never verbally informed\n\nOlivieri that he had the right to not sign the form, but he disputed Olivieri\u2019s\n\ncontention that officers told Olivieri that he was required to give consent because\n\nof the warrant police already had to search the house.\n\n      We must view the totality of these circumstances in a light most favorable to\n\nthe trial court\u2019s finding of voluntary consent.      Meekins, 340 S.W.3d at 460.\n\nWritten consent to search, such as that provided by Olivieri here, indicates that\n\nconsent is definite and unequivocal, because a person will generally \u201cconsider a\n\ndecision with more care and deliberation if [he or she] signs something rather than\n\nmaking an off-handed verbal consent.\u201d Lackey v. State, 638 S.W.2d 439, 452 (Tex.\n\n\n                                         22\n\fCrim. App. 1982).     Much of appellant\u2019s argument for looking past Olivieri\u2019s\n\nwritten consent to deem his consent involuntary is not supported by the actual\n\ntestimony from the suppression hearing or viewed in the appropriate light.\n\nAppellant insists that consent must have been \u201cgiven involuntarily in the face of an\n\noverwhelming display of authority as he was violently awakened at 2:00 a.m. and\n\nimmediately confronted with unfamiliar paperwork in an extreme and unexpected\n\ncircumstance.\u201d According to the evidence at the suppression hearing, police did\n\nunexpectedly barge into Olivieri\u2019s house between 2:00 and 2:30 a.m., and he was\n\nrestrained until appellant was arrested. Olivieri testified, though, that he was not\n\napproached by Cassidy and Fisher until after appellant was arrested and taken\n\naway. This is consistent with Cassidy\u2019s testimony that the voluntary consent form\n\nwas \u201cnot immediately jostled and shoved . . . in front of him.\u201d Rather, Olivieri\n\n\u201cwas given a chance to wake up,\u201d and then Cassidy \u201cexplained the circumstance of\n\nthe search warrant to him before providing him the form. He was allowed to read\n\nit in its entirety,\u201d and Cassidy inquired about his understanding of the form.\n\n      While a show of force can be indicative of coercion and render consent\n\ninvoluntary, the show of force here\u2014which preceded the consent and involved\n\nefforts to take appellant (rather than Olivieri) into custody\u2014does not rise to the\n\nlevel of the force found coercive in Lowery, the case cited by appellant. See\n\nLowery v. State, 499 S.W.2d 160, 167 (Tex. Crim. App. 1973) (verbal consent by\n\n\n                                          23\n\f17-year-old non-occupant held involuntary; approximately twenty officers entered\n\napartment to arrest occupant, several officers had guns drawn; there was no\n\nevidence about the circumstance of consent, how consent was requested or\n\nobtained, or about any conversation that led to the 17-year-old telling the officer\n\nthat she had \u201cno objection\u201d).\n\n      Appellant contends that Olivieri\u2019s \u201clack of knowledge of any right to refuse\n\nto sign the form\u201d weighs in in favor \u201cof a lack of voluntary consent.\u201d The\n\nevidence, however, was conflicting on this point. While Olivieri testified that he\n\nwas not aware that he could refuse consent, he does not claim he was rushed to\n\nsign the consent form, the consent form itself informed him that he could refuse,\n\nand Cassidy testified that he asked if Olivieri understood the form. On this record,\n\nthe trial court could have resolved this conflicting testimony in favor of a finding\n\nof voluntariness. Gutierrez, 221 S.W.3d at 687 (conflicting evidence should be\n\nresolved in favor of trial court\u2019s ruling). Appellant has not demonstrated an abuse\n\nof discretion in the trial court\u2019s denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized\n\nin the search of the Suburban.\n\n      We overrule appellant\u2019s third point of error.\n\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\f                                CONCLUSION\n\n      We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                Sherry Radack\n                                                Chief Justice\n\nPanel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Massengale and Huddle.\n\nDo not publish.
