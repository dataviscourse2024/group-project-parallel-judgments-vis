MITCHELL\nBEA, Circuit Judge, with whom KLEINFELD, GRABER,\nTALLMAN, and CALLAHAN, Circuit Judges, join, dissent-\ning from denial of rehearing en banc:\n\n  I write to make clear our court has, by its decision in this\ncase, made a substantial departure from settled principles of\nreview of jury determinations of fact in criminal cases.\n\n   In this case, our court decides the opinions of three Board-\ncertified physicians called by the prosecution that Smith\u2019s\nshaking of baby Etzel caused his death must be substituted\nwith the contrary opinions of non-Board-certified physicians\ncalled by the defense. Why? Because the defense\u2019s doctors\ntestified that a finding was absent on autopsy, and that finding\nwas crucial and undermined the prosecution experts\u2019 testi-\nmony. The three physicians called by the prosecution dis-\nagreed with the defense doctors, and explained why such a\nfinding was not crucial. Our court simply accepts the defense\ntheory and rejects the prosecution\u2019s evidence. The jury was\nperfectly able to do just that. But when our court does it, it\nsteps over the line dividing the province of the jury from that\nof the court.\n\n   This decision would be bad enough were we reviewing a\ndistrict court\u2019s judgment. But here, it is doubly bad for we are\nreviewing a state court decision under the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d)1 which severely\nrestricts the scope of our review, and mandates that \u201cwe apply\nthe standards of Jackson with an additional layer of defer-\nence.\u201d Juan H. v. Allen, 408 F.3d 1262, 1274 (9th Cir. 2005),\ncert. den., 126 S. Ct. 1142 (2006).\n  1\n   Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2241 et seq.\n\f                       SMITH v. MITCHELL                    7817\n                                I\n\n   In 1997, Shirley Ree Smith was convicted by a California\njury of the unlawful killing of her seven-week-old grandson,\nEtzel Glass (\u201cEtzel\u201d). On the night of Etzel\u2019s death, Smith\nwas staying with her daughter Tomeka, the infant\u2019s mother,\nalong with her two other young grandchildren and two of\nTomeka\u2019s sister\u2019s children. Around midnight, Tomeka fed,\nchanged, and washed baby Etzel before placing him to sleep\non the living room sofa. Baby Etzel shared this sofa with his\n18-month-old brother, Yondale, and four-year-old sister,\nYolanda. Smith was also in the living room, sleeping on the\nfloor. When Tomeka put Etzel to sleep at 11:30 p.m., he\nappeared healthy.\n\n   In her two interviews, Smith recounted different versions of\nthe events that followed. First, Smith told a social worker,\nLinda Reusser, that she awoke after 3 a.m. when Etzel\u2019s\nbrother Yondale had a nightmare. After comforting Yondale,\nSmith went over to check Etzel. Etzel didn\u2019t respond to her\ntouch; she picked Etzel up and his head \u201cflopped back.\u201d She\nthen gave Etzel \u201ca little shake, a jostle to awaken him,\u201d to\nwhich Etzel did not respond. Reusser described the shaking to\nthe jury as \u201ca quick jostle,\u201d a \u201csmooth motion.\u201d\n\n   At this point, Smith stopped speaking. When Reusser\nprompted Smith to continue, she said \u201csomething like \u2018Oh,\nmy God. Did I do it? Did I do it? Oh, my God.\u2019 \u201d Smith\u2019s\ndaughter Tomeka turned to Smith and said: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for\nyou, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d Smith didn\u2019t say any-\nthing.\n\n   Smith told a slightly different story to the police who inter-\nviewed her as part of the criminal investigation. Smith stated\nthat Yondale awoke from his nightmare sometime before 3\na.m.; Smith rose and checked Etzel; Etzel was fine. Then, past\n3 a.m., Etzel\u2019s sister Yolanda rolled off the couch and fell\nonto Smith. On waking, Smith noticed that Etzel\u2019s diaper\n\f7818                      SMITH v. MITCHELL\nneeded changing. After going to the bathroom to take her\nmedicine, Smith picked up Etzel and saw he had \u201cspit up\u201d\naround his mouth, and his head was \u201cflopped back.\u201d Smith\nsaid something to Etzel and he didn\u2019t respond; he was not\nbreathing or moving. At first, Smith told the police she\n\u201cshook\u201d Etzel, but then corrected herself, and said she \u201ctwist-\ned\u201d him back and forth to get a response. When asked about\nher statement to Reusser, Smith denied saying that she had\n\u201cshaken\u201d Etzel.\n\n   Smith then carried Etzel, who was not responsive, into\nTomeka\u2019s room. Smith and Tomeka called 9-1-1. After\nunsuccessful attempts at cardio-pulmonary resuscitation\n(\u201cCPR\u201d) by the family and the paramedics, Etzel was taken\nto the hospital. Soon after his arrival, he was declared dead.\nThe physician attending at the hospital suspected Etzel had\ndied of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (\u201cS.I.D.S.\u201d), which, as\none defense expert put it, is \u201ca medical[ly] sophisticated way\nof saying the child died and we really don\u2019t have any idea\nwhat it died from.\u201d The only injury the paramedics noticed\nwas fresh blood in one of Etzel\u2019s nostrils. In such cases, the\ndoctor lists \u201csuspected S.I.D.S.\u201d as the cause of death, pend-\ning an autopsy.\n\n   But here, the autopsy revealed signs of recent trauma to\nEtzel\u2019s brain. When the autopsy surgeon lifted Etzel\u2019s brain\nout of the skull, she saw fresh blood on top of the brain\n(\u201csubdural\u201d2 blood). The subdural blood measured one or two\ntablespoons. The surgeon also saw a fresh blood clot between\nthe hemispheres of Etzel\u2019s brain, and recent hemorrhaging\naround the optic nerves. Further, she found a small quantity\nof fresh \u201csubarachnoid\u201d blood. Finally, the surgeon and her\nsupervisor noticed a small bruise at the left lower-back part of\nEtzel\u2019s head, and a recent abrasion at the same site.\n  2\n   As an expert testified below, the brain is protected by three sheaths or\nmembranes: the dura, the arachnoid, and the pia. Blood found between the\ndura and the arachnoid is referred to as \u201csubdural.\u201d Blood between the\narachnoid and the pia is referred to as \u201csubarachnoid.\u201d\n\f                           SMITH v. MITCHELL                           7819\n   Dr. Carpenter, the autopsy supervisor, opined Etzel had\ndied by being violently shaken (\u201cshaken baby syndrome\u201d).3\nAccording to Carpenter, death from violent shaking can occur\nin three ways: (1) massive swelling of the brain; (2) massive\nbleeding sufficient to crush the brain stem; or (3) a sudden\nshaking \u201cso violent that it destroys the vital centers in the\nbrain and is a quick death.\u201d Here, Carpenter opined that death\noccurred through the last process, as Etzel\u2019s head had under-\ngone whiplash from chin to chest. The death occurred too\nquickly for visible trauma to develop on the brain stem itself.\n\n   Dr. Carpenter explained the basis of his opinion as the\nrecent trauma to Etzel\u2019s brain and the absence of other causes.\nThe subdural blood, the subarachnoid blood, and the blood\naround the optic nerves showed \u201cviolent trauma to the head\nsufficient to cause the death of the infant.\u201d The bruise and\nabrasion had, in Carpenter\u2019s opinion, \u201cvery probably\u201d\noccurred during the shaking episode, as the head collided with\na hard, rough surface.4\n\n   The alternate causes of death that Carpenter considered\ndidn\u2019t make sense to him. First, Carpenter ruled out S.I.D.S.\nbecause \u201c[a case] is never called a S.I.D.S. if there is any sus-\npicion of trauma to the infant.\u201d Second, Carpenter ruled out\nthat a fall from the sofa onto a carpeted floor could have\ncaused Etzel\u2019s injuries or death. Third, Carpenter considered\nthe evidence of an old injury to Etzel\u2019s brain, such as birth\n  3\n     Dr. Carpenter was Board-certified in forensic, anatomic, and clinical\npathology. Tr. 534-36. \u201cBoard-certified\u201d means the physician has first\npracticed a certain number of years in the field of specialty which the\nBoard regulates. To gain certification as a specialist by the Board, the phy-\nsician must then take certain written tests. Last, upon successful comple-\ntion of those tests, the physician must sit successfully for oral examination\nby a group of Board-certified specialists. Only then can the physician\nbecome \u201cBoard-certified.\u201d\n   4\n     While Dr. Carpenter could not rule out that Etzel\u2019s head received a\nblow from a weapon, the bruise and abrasion were too small to indicate\na blow that could have caused all of the trauma in Etzel\u2019s brain.\n\f7820                   SMITH v. MITCHELL\ntrauma, as the cause of death. While he could not exclude the\nold injury as contributing to Etzel\u2019s death, the old injury was\n\u201cnot sufficient to cause death in that the infant had apparently\nsufficiently recovered from this injury and was appearing to\nlook normal to others.\u201d\n\n   Under Jackson, Dr. Carpenter\u2019s opinion alone suffices to\nsupport the jury\u2019s finding on causation. But then the prosecu-\ntion called two other Board-certified doctors, who testified\nthat violent shaking was the cause of death. Notably, the pros-\necution\u2019s witness on rebuttal, Dr. Chadwick, had published\narticles on how to distinguish between falls and abusive inju-\nries in children. Based in part on his own research, Chadwick\nopined that a fall from the sofa was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d to\ncause death. Chadwick also explained that the old trauma was\nnot the cause of death because old injuries do not cause sud-\nden death without a specific pathology that was absent in this\ncase. In short, Chadwick saw \u201cno other natural or unnatural\ncause except the injury that would explain [Etzel\u2019s] death,\u201d\nand, therefore, opined that Etzel died from shaken baby syn-\ndrome.\n\n   The defense\u2019s two expert witnesses, by contrast, opined\nthat the necessary physical evidence of shaken baby syndrome\nwas lacking. Dr. William Goldie opined the cause of death\nwas S.I.D.S. Dr. Richard Siegler opined that the death was\ntraumatic, but that it was impossible to isolate the cause of\ndeath between the recent and the old trauma. Significantly,\nboth Goldie and Sielger would only diagnose Etzel\u2019s death as\nshaken baby syndrome on a finding of visible injury to the\nshorn region of the brain stem. Even if death were instanta-\nneous, Goldie opined that hemorrhages in the neck or brain\nstem would be present. Thus, the experts for the prosecution\nand the defense disagreed on a fundamental point: to be valid,\ndoes a doctor\u2019s opinion that a baby died from violent shaking\nrequire evidence, visible on autopsy, of brain stem shearing?\n\n  The jury resolved this conflict among the experts\u2019 opinions\nagainst Smith. The California Court of Appeal, after review-\n\f                       SMITH v. MITCHELL                     7821\ning the medical evidence, affirmed the conviction because\n\u201c[i]t was for the jury to resolve the conflicts\u201d in that evidence.\nThe California Supreme Court denied review. On federal\nhabeas review, the Magistrate Judge recommended denying\nSmith\u2019s petition for the same reason as the California Court\nof Appeal. Notwithstanding the tragedy of Smith\u2019s case, it\nwas the jury\u2019s province to choose between the conflicting\nexpert opinions. The district court accepted the recommenda-\ntion and denied Smith\u2019s habeas petition.\n\n                                II\n\n   Our court, however, granted habeas relief on the ground of\ninsufficient evidence of causation. See Smith v. Mitchell, 437\nF.3d 884 (9th Cir. 2006). Claims of insufficient evidence are\njudged according to a familiar standard: we ask whether,\n\u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nprosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\nJackson, 443 U.S. at 319. AEDPA requires the federal courts\nto review Jackson claims with additional deference, and only\ngrant habeas relief where the state court\u2019s adjudication of a\nJackson claim is objectively unreasonable. See Smith, 437\nF.3d at 889 (citing Juan H., 408 F.3d at 1274-75 & nn.12-13).\n\n   To grant habeas relief, the opinion set aside the qualified\nopinions of the prosecution\u2019s experts by misconstruing the\nbasis for their opinions. \u201c[T]heir testimony was that death was\ncaused by the shearing or tearing of the brain stem and\u201d\u2014\naccording to the opinion\u2014\u201cthey reached this conclusion\nbecause there was no evidence in the brain itself of the cause\nof death.\u201d Smith, 437 F.3d at 890.\n\n  Not so; the opinion is inaccurate.\n\n   The physicians called by the prosecution reached their con-\nclusion despite the lack of visible shearing, not because of it,\nand explained why. Indeed, what provided the basis for the\n\f7822                   SMITH v. MITCHELL\ndoctors\u2019 opinions was the evidence of recent trauma to Etzel\u2019s\nbrain: (1) the subdural hemorrhaging; (2) the subarachnoid\nhemorrhaging; (3) the hemorrhaging around the optic nerves;\n(4) the blood clot between the hemispheres of Etzel\u2019s brain;\nand (5) the bruise and abrasion at the lower back of Etzel\u2019s\nhead. The prosecution\u2019s experts considered and rejected other\ncauses of Etzel\u2019s death, such as a fall from the sofa, or the\naggravation of Etzel\u2019s older injury. Since none of these alter-\nnate theories explained Etzel\u2019s death, the prosecution\u2019s doc-\ntors opined that Etzel died from violent shaking, as evidenced\nby the trauma.\n\n   Not once did the prosecution\u2019s doctors voice the supposed\nbasis the opinion attributes to them. Rather their opinions\nwere based on the evidence of the child\u2019s injuries, notwith-\nstanding that they did not see the brain stem shearing on\nautopsy.\n\n   In effect, the opinion adopts the defense experts\u2019 view of\nwhat physical evidence is necessary to support a valid diagno-\nsis of shaken baby syndrome. Specifically, the opinion relies\non Dr. Siegler\u2019s aspersion of the prosecution\u2019s theory as \u201ctotal\nfantasy,\u201d when there is \u201cno way to confirm it or deny it\u201d with\ndirect physical evidence. The opinion similarly concludes\n\u201cthere simply was no evidence to permit an expert conclusion\none way or the other,\u201d absent the physical evidence Siegler\ndemanded. See Smith, 437 F.3d at 890.\n\n   But the prosecution\u2019s experts explained why they would\nnot expect to see physical evidence of tearing in Etzel\u2019s brain\nstem: Etzel\u2019s death happened so quickly that the effects of the\ntrauma did not have time to develop. That is, there was no\nswelling in the torn brain stem tissue because the child\u2019s\ninstant death closed down its circulation.\n\n   The opinion buttresses its conclusion by pointing to the\nabsence of various factors that are \u201ctypically,\u201d \u201cusually,\u201d or\n\u201cfrequently\u201d present in cases of shaken baby death. See Smith,\n\f                           SMITH v. MITCHELL                           7823\n437 F.3d at 887. For instance, the opinion points to the\nabsence of retinal bleeding, which is present in 80-85% of\nshaken baby cases, and almost never present otherwise. Yet\nDr. Carpenter testified that the absence of retinal bleeding did\nnot change his opinion on the cause of death. Even the\ndefense doctor, Dr. Siegler, did not think retinal hemorrhages\nwere necessary to diagnose shaken baby syndrome. Thus, the\nabsence of these \u201cusual\u201d symptoms simply constitutes cir-\ncumstantial evidence favorable to the defense, not a failure of\nproof as to an essential element of the prosecution\u2019s case.\n\n   Although Smith did not challenge the admissibility of the\nprosecution\u2019s experts\u2019 testimony, the opinion\u2019s analysis effec-\ntively makes the qualification of experts an issue on appeal.5\nUp to now, the ceaselessly litigated question of whether\nexpert testimony is \u201cjunk science\u201d has been channeled\n  5\n    The overlap between the sufficiency of the evidence and qualification\nof experts is illustrated by the opinion\u2019s reliance on United States v. Bois-\nsoneault, 926 F.2d 230, 234 (2d Cir. 1991). There, the Second Circuit\nreversed a conviction for possession of cocaine with the intent to distrib-\nute. The defendant was found carrying 5.31 grams of cocaine; $1,460 in\nten and twenty dollar bills; and many slips of paper bearing names,\naddresses, and telephone numbers. Id. at 231. The question was whether\nthis evidence permitted the inference of intent to distribute the 5.31 grams.\nOver defense objection, the government called an expert who opined that\nthe evidence was consistent with \u201cclassic street level distribution of small\nquantities of cocaine.\u201d Id. at 232. On appeal, the defendant challenged\nboth the admission of this testimony and the sufficiency of the evidence.\nId. at 231. The Second Circuit reversed for insufficient evidence. Without\ndeciding the evidentiary issue, the court held that conclusory opinions that\n\u201cambiguous conduct constitutes criminal activity\u201d do not count toward\nestablishing the sufficiency of the evidence. Id. at 234.\n   Boissoneault is directly contrary to California Evidence Code \u00a7 805,\nwhich allows opinion testimony as to ultimate facts. Moreover, the subject\nof the opinion in Boissoneault was whether ambiguous conduct is crimi-\nnal, an area where expert opinion is of little help to the trier of fact. See\nUnited States v. Young, 745 F.2d 733, 765-66 (2d Cir. 1984) (Newman,\nJ., concurring). By contrast, whether autopsy results establish the cause of\ndeath is a question on which expert opinion is indispensable to the jury.\n\f7824                     SMITH v. MITCHELL\nthrough the Daubert6 and Kelly/Frye7 tests governing the\nqualification and admissibility of expert testimony. Under our\ncourt\u2019s approach, a federal court of appeals may, effectively,\nset aside an expert opinion where it conflicts with the views\nof the other side\u2019s experts.\n\n   Here, the prosecution\u2019s experts based their opinions on the\nevidence of recent trauma to Etzel\u2019s brain, and explained how\na rapid death would result in brain-stem tearing that could not\nbe seen. When the defense\u2019s experts disputed the validity of\nthis hypothesis, it was for the jury to resolve the conflicting\nopinions. Accordingly, the California Court of Appeal cor-\nrectly applied Jackson in affirming Smith\u2019s conviction.\n\n   Because our court\u2019s rejection of qualified expert opinions\ndistorts Jackson analysis and contravenes AEDPA\u2019s required\ndeference, I respectfully dissent from the denial of rehearing\nen banc.\n\n\n\n\n  6\n    Daubert v.
