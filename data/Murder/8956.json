No. S-13-542.\n\n\u20021.\t Motions to Suppress: Confessions: Constitutional Law: Miranda Rights:\n     Appeal and Error. In reviewing a motion to suppress a confession based on the\n     claimed involuntariness of the statement, including claims that it was procured\n     in violation of the safeguards established by the U.S. Supreme Court in Miranda\n     v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), an appel-\n     late court applies a two-part standard of review. With regard to historical facts,\n     the appellate court reviews the trial court\u2019s findings for clear error. Whether\n     those facts suffice to meet the constitutional standards, however, is a question\n     of law, which the appellate court reviews independently of the trial court\u2019s\n     determination.\n\u20022.\t Criminal Law: Convictions: Evidence: Appeal and Error. When reviewing a\n     criminal conviction for sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction, the\n     relevant question for an appellate court is whether, after viewing the evidence in\n     the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have\n     found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. In review-\n     ing a criminal conviction, an appellate court does not resolve conflicts in the\n     evidence, pass on the credibility of witnesses, or reweigh the evidence.\n\u20023.\t Constitutional Law: Miranda Rights: Self-Incrimination. Miranda v. Arizona,\n     384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), prohibits the use of state-\n     ments derived during custodial interrogation unless the prosecution demonstrates\n     the use of procedural safeguards that are effective to secure the privilege against\n     self-incrimination.\n\u20024.\t Miranda Rights: Self-Incrimination. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.\n     Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), requires law enforcement to give a particular\n     set of warnings to a person in custody before interrogation: that he has the right\n     to remain silent, that any statement he makes may be used as evidence against\n     him, and that he has the right to an attorney, either retained or appointed.\n\u20025.\t Miranda Rights: Police Officers and Sheriffs: Words and Phrases. For pur-\n     poses of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694\n     (1966), interrogation refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words\n     or actions on the part of the police that the police should know are reasonably\n     likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\n\u20026.\t Constitutional Law: Miranda Rights: Arrests: Words and Phrases. A person\n     is in custody for purposes of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602,\n     16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), when there is a formal arrest or a restraint on one\u2019s\n     freedom of movement to the degree associated with such an arrest.\n\u20027.\t Miranda Rights. Miranda protections apply only when a person is both in cus-\n     tody and subject to interrogation.\n\u20028.\t Miranda Rights: Police Officers and Sheriffs. An individual is in custody for\n     purposes of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694\n     (1966), when handcuffed and placed in the back seat of a police cruiser.\n\f                         Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t                               STATE v.

Statements that are spontaneously volunteered by the accused are\n     not the result of interrogation and are admissible.\n10.\t Miranda Rights: Police Officers and Sheriffs: Words and Phrases. The defi-\n     nition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police\n     officers that they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incrimi-\n     nating response.\n11.\t Constitutional Law: Self-Incrimination. The Fifth Amendment privilege\n     against self-incrimination is fundamental to the United States\u2019 system of constitu-\n     tional rule.\n12.\t Confessions. Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the\n     compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from the\n     defendant can truly be the product of his or her free choice.\n13.\t Trial: Evidence: Appeal and Error. The improper admission of evidence is a\n     trial error and subject to harmless error review.\n14.\t Verdicts: Juries: Appeal and Error. Harmless error review looks to the basis\n     on which the trier of fact actually rested its verdict; the inquiry is not whether\n     in a trial that occurred without the error a guilty verdict would surely have been\n     rendered, but, rather, whether the actual guilty verdict rendered in the questioned\n     trial was surely unattributable to the error.\n15.\t Trial: Evidence: Appeal and Error. Erroneous admission of evidence is harm-\n     less error and does not require reversal if the evidence is cumulative and other\n     relevant evidence, properly admitted, supports the finding by the trier of fact.\n\n  Appeal from the District Court for Douglas County: Gary B.\nRandall, Judge. Affirmed.\n  Thomas C. Riley, Douglas County Public Defender, and\nKelly M. Steenbock for appellant.\n  Jon Bruning, Attorney General, and George R. Love for\nappellee.\n  Wright, Connolly, Stephan, McCormack, Miller-Lerman,\nand Cassel, JJ.\n    Wright, J.\n                    I. NATURE OF CASE\n   Michael L. Juranek unsuccessfully moved to suppress his\nstatements made to police during the investigation of the stab-\nbing of Jimmy McBride. At his trial for first degree murder\nand use of a deadly weapon to commit a felony, the district\ncourt admitted evidence of the statements over Juranek\u2019s objec-\ntions. Juranek now challenges the district court\u2019s decision not\nto suppress the statements and also raises sufficiency of the\n\f    Nebraska Advance Sheets\n848\t287 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\nevidence as to his convictions for first degree murder and use\nof a deadly weapon to commit a felony. We find no error in the\nadmission of two of Juranek\u2019s statements and harmless error in\nthe admission of the third. Ultimately, we conclude that there\nwas sufficient evidence to find Juranek guilty, and we affirm\nhis convictions and sentences.\n\n                     II. SCOPE OF REVIEW\n   [1] In reviewing a motion to suppress a confession based on\nthe claimed involuntariness of the statement, including claims\nthat it was procured in violation of the safeguards established\nby the U.S. Supreme Court in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.\n436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), an appellate\ncourt applies a two-part standard of review. With regard to his-\ntorical facts, we review the trial court\u2019s findings for clear error.\nWhether those facts suffice to meet the constitutional stan-\ndards, however, is a question of law, which we review indepen-\ndently of the trial court\u2019s determination. State v. Bormann, 279\nNeb. 320, 777 N.W.2d 829 (2010).\n   [2] When reviewing a criminal conviction for sufficiency of\nthe evidence to sustain the conviction, the relevant question\nfor an appellate court is whether, after viewing the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational\ntrier of fact could have found the essential elements of the\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt. In reviewing a criminal\nconviction, an appellate court does not resolve conflicts in\nthe evidence, pass on the credibility of witnesses, or reweigh\nthe evidence. State v. McGuire, 286 Neb. 494, 837 N.W.2d\n767 (2013).\n\n                          III. FACTS\n   On September 14, 2011, Officer Brandon Braun of the\nOmaha Police Department responded to a 911 emergency dis-\npatch service call concerning a \u201ccutting\u201d or stabbing. Upon\narriving at the scene, Braun located \u201ca male subject that [had]\nblood on his shirt.\u201d The subject, whom Braun recognized as\nMcBride, mentioned the name \u201cMike\u201d and pointed to a male\nabout 100 feet away who was wearing a dark shirt and carry-\ning a dark-colored bag. Because Braun was the only officer\n\f                  Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t                      STATE v. JURANEK\t849\n\t                      Cite as 287 Neb. 846\n\nat the scene at that time, he relayed the description to other\nofficers who could attempt to detain the suspect. McBride later\ndied from his wound.\n   En route to the scene of the stabbing, Officer Aaron Andersen\nof the Omaha Police Department saw an individual matching\nthe description relayed by Braun. The individual was later\nidentified as Juranek. Andersen, whose police cruiser window\nwas rolled down, pulled up to Juranek and yelled, \u201c\u2018Hey.\u2019\u201d\nAndersen did not pull in front of Juranek or order him to stop.\nJuranek turned around, and Andersen observed that Juranek\nwas \u201cbleeding from [one of] his eye[s].\u201d Without exiting the\ncruiser, Andersen asked Juranek what had happened to his eye.\nJuranek responded, \u201cHe threatened me so I stuck him.\u201d At that\npoint, Andersen exited the cruiser, handcuffed Juranek, and\nplaced him in the cruiser.\n   While Andersen drove Juranek to the scene of the stabbing,\nAndersen heard Juranek \u201cmaking several statements to him-\nself.\u201d Specifically, Andersen heard Juranek say that \u201che stuck\nhim once,\u201d \u201che wanted to stick him again,\u201d and \u201che wanted to\nkill him.\u201d Andersen had not asked any questions of Juranek or\nengaged him in conversation.\n   After informing the officers at the scene of the stabbing\nthat he had detained Juranek, Andersen drove Juranek to the\npolice station and took him to an interview room. Shortly\nthereafter, a detective with the Omaha Police Department\nbegan to interview Juranek. The video recording from the\ninterview shows that the detective started the interview by\nattempting to shake Juranek\u2019s hand, which Juranek declined\nbecause his hands were \u201cdirty.\u201d The following dialog then\ntook place:\n         Detective: Okay, sir. I\u2019m, uh, was speaking with the\n      officer that brought you down here and he shared some\n      information, so\u2014\n         Juranek: I told it to him 14 times.\n         Detective: Ok. Do you want to tell it to me?\n         Juranek: The asshole\u2019s name was Jimmy McBride. He\n      threatened to kill me. I took a knife, and I stuck him. I\n      would have stuck him again, but he ran away. And after\n      that I don\u2019t know what happened. He hand\u2014, I was a\n\f    Nebraska Advance Sheets\n850\t287 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\n      block away and he handcuffed me and wanted to know\n      where the knife was. I don\u2019t even, after I stabbed that\n      piece of shit, I don\u2019t remember anything. I\u2019m guilty.\n         Detective: [after about 10 seconds of silence] Um. I\n      want to read you these six statements here with yes or no\n      questions, okay?\nThe detective then read Juranek the Miranda warnings. After\nJuranek waived his Miranda rights, the detective thoroughly\ninterviewed Juranek about McBride and the stabbing.\n   Juranek was charged by complaint with first degree murder\nand use of a deadly weapon to commit a felony. The county\ncourt determined there was probable cause for the complaint\nand bound Juranek over to the district court. In district court,\nJuranek was charged by information with the same crimes. He\nentered pleas of not guilty to both counts.\n   Before trial, Juranek moved to suppress \u201cany and all state-\nments\u201d that he made to the police officers. He argued that the\nstatements were obtained contrary to the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 14th\nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution and article I, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and\n12, of the Nebraska Constitution, because the statements were\n(1) the fruit of an unlawful detention and arrest; (2) neither\nfreely and voluntarily given nor knowingly, understandingly,\nand intelligently made; (3) made before he was informed of his\nrights; (4) made without a knowing, understanding, and intel-\nligent waiver of his rights; (5) the result of questions that \u201cthe\npolice should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an\nincriminatory response\u201d; and (6) made after he \u201cunequivocally\ninvoked his right to cut off questioning.\u201d\n   The district court overruled Juranek\u2019s motion to suppress.\nThe court made no specific findings in relation to Juranek\u2019s\nstatements before he was detained and while he was in the\npolice cruiser. The court briefly explained that the detective\u2019s\nquestion at the start of Juranek\u2019s interview was \u201cnot intended\nto elicit a confession but rather to determine whether [Juranek]\nwas in fact willing to talk,\u201d citing to Oregon v. Elstad, 470\nU.S. 298, 105 S. Ct. 1285, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1985).\n   At a bench trial, the State adduced evidence of the state-\nments challenged in Juranek\u2019s motion to suppress. The court\noverruled Juranek\u2019s objections and received the evidence. In\n\f                  Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t                      STATE v. JURANEK\t851\n\t                      Cite as 287 Neb. 846\n\ntestifying to Juranek\u2019s statements during the interrogation,\nthe detective stated that he did not read the Miranda warn-\nings prior to asking whether Juranek would tell him what had\nhappened, because the question was not intended to elicit a\nsubstantive response. When asked why he conducted the inter-\nview in the manner that he did, the detective explained, \u201cI was\nconcerned that [Juranek] wasn\u2019t wanting to speak with me at\nall. Therefore, I asked the question. My intent was to see if I\nwas going to be wasting my time trying to talk to him if he\ndid not want to speak with me at all.\u201d The detective said that\nhe did not read Juranek the Miranda warnings at the outset\nof the interview because the detective was trying to \u201cbuild\na rapport.\u201d\n   The entire video recording of Juranek\u2019s interrogation was\nreceived into evidence over his objection. The video record-\ning showed that after waiving his Miranda rights, Juranek\nconfessed multiple times to seeking out McBride with the\nexplicit purpose of killing him and to stabbing McBride\nunder the left rib cage. He also stated that he would stab\nMcBride again.\n   The State adduced testimony from two individuals who wit-\nnessed the stabbing. One witness testified that on September\n14, 2011, she saw a fight between two older males, one of\nwhom she identified as Juranek. According to this witness,\nJuranek \u201c[s]hoved [the other man] in the chest,\u201d followed\nthe other man as he tried to get away, and then \u201cpushed\u201d the\nother man a second time. She said that the two men were\npunching each other and then \u201c[a]ll of [a] sudden,\u201d the other\nman \u201cstarted screaming and lifted up his shirt\u201d to reveal\nblood on his left side. The witness\u2019 boyfriend also witnessed\nthe incident. However, the boyfriend described what he saw\nas one man \u201cchasing the other guy\u201d and \u201cswinging . . . at\nhim.\u201d The boyfriend said that the one man \u201cwas punching\nsomewhere right here in the ribs. And then after a little bit,\nafter he did that, he walked away, and the guy dropped, fell\non the floor.\u201d The boyfriend could not identify either man\nas Juranek.\n   The district court found Juranek guilty of both first degree\nmurder and use of a deadly weapon to commit a felony. The\n\f    Nebraska Advance Sheets\n852\t287 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\ncourt sentenced Juranek to life imprisonment and 5 to 10\nyears\u2019 imprisonment, respectively.\n   Juranek timely appeals. We have a statutory obligation\nto hear all appeals in cases where the defendant is sen-\ntenced to life imprisonment. See Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 24-1106(1)\n(Reissue 2008).\n                IV. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Juranek assigns that the district court erred in overruling his\nmotion to suppress and in entering judgment based on evidence\ninsufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n                          V. ANALYSIS\n                   1. Suppression of Evidence\n                         (a) Background\n   [3,4] Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602,\n16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), prohibits the use of statements\nderived during custodial interrogation unless the prosecution\ndemonstrates the use of procedural safeguards that are effec-\ntive to secure the privilege against self-incrimination. State v.\nRodriguez, 272 Neb. 930, 726 N.W.2d 157 (2007). Miranda\nrequires \u201claw enforcement to give a particular set of warnings\nto a person in custody before interrogation: that he has the right\nto remain silent, that any statement he makes may be used as\nevidence against him, and that he has the right to an attorney,\neither retained or appointed.\u201d State v. Nave, 284 Neb. 477, 492,\n821 N.W.2d 723, 735 (2012), cert. denied ___ U.S. ___, 133 S.\nCt. 1595, 185 L. Ed. 2d 591 (2013).\n   [5] For purposes of Miranda, interrogation \u201crefers not only\nto express questioning, \u2018but also to any words or actions on\nthe part of the police . . . that the police should know are\nreasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the\nsuspect.\u2019\u201d State v. Bauldwin, 283 Neb. 678, 700, 811 N.W.2d\n267, 286 (2012) (ellipsis in original) (quoting State v. Rogers,\n277 Neb. 37, 760 N.W.2d 35 (2009)). But \u201c\u2018[s]tatements made\nin a conversation initiated by the accused or spontaneously\nvolunteered by the accused are not the result of interrogation\n\f                  Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t                      STATE v. JURANEK\t853\n\t                      Cite as 287 Neb. 846\n\nand are admissible.\u2019\u201d State v. Bormann, 279 Neb. 320, 327,\n777 N.W.2d 829, 836 (2010) (alteration in original) (quoting\nRodriguez, supra).\n\n              (b) Whether Admission of Juranek\u2019s\n                  Statements Violated Miranda\n                 (i) Statement Before Detention\n   [6] Juranek\u2019s statement in response to the officer\u2019s question\nabout Juranek\u2019s eye was not made while he was in custody. A\nperson is in custody for purposes of Miranda when there is a\nformal arrest or a restraint on one\u2019s freedom of movement to\nthe degree associated with such an arrest. State v. Landis, 281\nNeb. 139, 794 N.W.2d 151 (2011). The individual must be\n\u201cdeprived of [his or her] freedom of action in any significant\nway.\u201d Rodriguez, 272 Neb. at 943, 726 N.W.2d at 171.\n   When Juranek said, \u201cHe threatened me so I stuck him,\u201d he\nhad not been arrested or detained. Indeed, the evidence shows\nthat Juranek\u2019s freedom of movement was not at all limited\nby Andersen\u2019s presence. When Andersen\u2019s cruiser approached\nJuranek, Andersen did not pull the police cruiser in front of\nJuranek so as to block his way. Andersen did not exit the\ncruiser or make any attempt to get in close proximity to\nJuranek. Andersen did not order Juranek to stop. Neither did\nAndersen make any statements that suggested Juranek was a\nsuspect in a crime or in any way being detained by the police.\nRather, Andersen got Juranek\u2019s attention by yelling \u201c\u2018Hey\u2019\u201d\nfrom inside the cruiser. Juranek was not required to stay and\nanswer Andersen\u2019s questions. Because Juranek\u2019s freedom of\nmovement was in no way restricted at the time he made the\nstatement, we conclude that the statement was not made while\nJuranek was in custody.\n   [7] Miranda protections apply only when a person is both\nin custody and subject to interrogation. Bauldwin, supra.\nTherefore, because Juranek\u2019s statement in response to the\nquestion about his eye was not made while he was in custody,\nMiranda was not implicated. The district court did not err in\nadmitting this statement into evidence.\n\f    Nebraska Advance Sheets\n854\t287 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\n                    (ii) Statements in Cruiser\n   [8] This court has previously held that an individual is in\ncustody for purposes of Miranda when \u201chandcuffed and placed\nin the back seat of a police cruiser.\u201d See Bormann, 279 Neb.\nat 326, 777 N.W.2d at 836. Thus, Juranek\u2019s statements in the\npolice cruiser were made while he was in custody.\n   [9] But Juranek\u2019s statements in the police cruiser were not\nthe result of interrogation. Juranek had neither been asked\nquestions nor engaged in conversation by Andersen. And there\nwas no evidence that Andersen took any action that would\nhave produced a verbal response from Juranek. Indeed, Juranek\nappeared to be talking \u201cto himself\u201d as opposed to Andersen.\nBased on these facts, we conclude that Juranek spontane-\nously volunteered the statements in the cruiser that he \u201cstuck\nhim once,\u201d \u201cwanted to stick him again,\u201d and \u201cwanted to kill\nhim.\u201d Statements that are \u201c\u2018spontaneously volunteered by the\naccused are not the result of interrogation and are admissible.\u2019\u201d\nState v. Bormann, 279 Neb. 320, 327, 777 N.W.2d 829, 836\n(2010) (quoting State v. Rodriguez, 272 Neb. 930, 726 N.W.2d\n157 (2007)). Juranek\u2019s statements in the cruiser were not the\nresult of interrogation.\n   Because Juranek\u2019s statements in the cruiser were not the\nresult of interrogation, they were admissible despite the fact\nthat he had not been given the Miranda warnings. The district\ncourt did not err in admitting the statements into evidence.\n             (iii) Statement in Response to Question\n                  \u201cDo you want to tell it to me?\u201d\n                       a. Immediate Response\n   The difficult issue is whether Juranek\u2019s response to the\ndetective\u2019s question, \u201cDo you want to tell it to me?\u201d was\nadmissible in the absence of prior Miranda warnings. For the\nfollowing reasons, we find that the district court erred in admit-\nting the statement.\n   At the time of this statement, Juranek was in custody.\nJuranek had been handcuffed, driven to the police station\nin a cruiser, and placed in an interview room for interroga-\ntion. Accordingly, the admissibility of Juranek\u2019s statement will\ndepend on whether it was the result of interrogation.\n\f                  Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t                       STATE v. JURANEK\t855\n\t                       Cite as 287 Neb. 846\n\n   [10] For purposes of Miranda, interrogation can be \u201cexpress\nquestioning\u201d or \u201c\u2018any words or actions on the part of the\npolice . . . that the police should know are reasonably likely\nto elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u2019\u201d State\nv. Bauldwin, 283 Neb. 678, 700, 811 N.W.2d 267, 286 (2012)\n(ellipsis in original) (quoting State v. Rogers, 277 Neb. 37, 760\nN.W.2d 35 (2009)). In determining whether there is interroga-\ntion, the question is: \u201c\u2018Would a reasonable and disinterested\nperson conclude that police conduct, directed to a suspect\nor defendant in custody, would likely elicit an incriminating\nresponse from that suspect or defendant?\u2019\u201d Bormann, 279 Neb.\nat 327, 777 N.W.2d at 836 (quoting State v. Gibson, 228 Neb.\n455, 422 N.W.2d 570 (1988)).\n      \u201cA practice that the police should know is reasonably\n      likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect\n      thus amounts to interrogation. But, since the police surely\n      cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results\n      of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation\n      can extend only to words or actions on the part of police\n      officers that they should have known were reasonably\n      likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d\nId. at 327, 777 N.W.2d at 836 (emphasis in original) (quoting\nRhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed.\n2d 297 (1980)).\n   We apply an objective standard in determining whether\na defendant\u2019s response was the result of interrogation. See\nBormann, supra. For this reason, whether a defendant was\nbeing interrogated does not depend on the officer\u2019s intent in\nasking the question that elicited an incriminating response.\nIn the instant case, the detective\u2019s testimony that his inten-\ntions were to find out if Juranek was willing to talk in gen-\neral and to \u201cbuild a rapport\u201d with Juranek is not material to\nour consideration. The issue is whether the detective should\nhave known that his question to Juranek was likely to elicit\nan incriminating response. We conclude the detective should\nhave known his question was likely to elicit an incriminat-\ning response.\n   Within the context of Juranek\u2019s and the detective\u2019s prior\nstatements in the interview, the question \u201cDo you want to tell\n\f    Nebraska Advance Sheets\n856\t287 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\nit to me?\u201d was an explicit invitation for Juranek to tell the\ndetective what had happened that day. The detective asked\nthe question in response to Juranek\u2019s statement that he had\nalready told \u201cit\u201d to Andersen \u201c14 times.\u201d A reasonable person\nwould have understood the detective\u2019s use of the word \u201cit\u201d\nto be a reference to the same \u201cit\u201d that Juranek said he had\ntold Andersen. Juranek had previously confessed to Andersen.\nPrior to the interview, the detective learned of these confes-\nsions from Andersen. And Juranek knew that the detective was\naware of the confessions, because Juranek said that he had told\n\u201cit\u201d to Andersen 14 times in direct response to the detective\u2019s\nmention of \u201csome information\u201d that Andersen had shared prior\nto the interview. Thus, \u201cit\u201d was clearly a reference to the con-\nfessions that Juranek made to Andersen. Because of the man-\nner in which the detective\u2019s question built upon previous uses\nof the word \u201cit\u201d in the interview, a reasonable person would\nhave understood the question to be an invitation for Juranek to\ntell the detective what Juranek had previously told Andersen.\nTherefore, the detective\u2019s question was an attempt to elicit a\nstatement from Juranek regarding his prior confessions to the\nstabbing of McBride.\n   Moreover, the detective knew about Juranek\u2019s propensity to\ntalk without being interrogated and should have expected that\nif asked about the incident, Juranek would confess again. The\ndetective knew that before Juranek was in custody and again\nwhile Juranek was being transported to the police station, he\nhad confessed to the stabbing. A reasonable and disinterested\nperson with such knowledge would have had little doubt that\nonce confronted by the police, Juranek was likely to make an\nincriminating statement again. Because Juranek had previously\ngiven incriminating statements on two separate occasions and\nbecause Juranek was aware that the detective knew of those\nstatements, the detective should have known that reference to\nthose statements might prompt Juranek to repeat what he had\npreviously confessed to Andersen.\n   Once the detective mentioned that he knew of Juranek\u2019s\nprior statements to Andersen, the interrogation had begun\nand Juranek should have been given the procedural safe-\nguards required by Miranda. These warnings are \u201can absolute\n\f                  Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t                       STATE v. JURANEK\t857\n\t                       Cite as 287 Neb. 846\n\nprerequisite to interrogation,\u201d see Miranda v. Arizona, 384\nU.S. 436, 471, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), and\n\u201cfundamental with respect to the Fifth Amendment privilege,\u201d\nMiranda, 384 U.S. at 476.\n   The detective testified that \u201c[n]othing was stopping [him]\u201d\nfrom giving the Miranda warnings before asking any questions\nof Juranek. Indeed, less than 1 minute later, when Juranek was\nadvised of the Miranda rights, the detective used a series of\nscripted questions that concluded by asking, \u201cKnowing your\nrights in this matter, are you willing to speak with me?\u201d The\ndetective admitted that this final question was another way of\nasking whether Juranek was willing to speak with the detective\nand would have accomplished the same objectives while also\nadvising Juranek of the Miranda rights.\n   [11] Before Juranek said anything in the interview, it would\nhave required no effort for the detective to advise Juranek that\nhe had the right to remain silent, that any statement he made\ncould be used as evidence against him, and that he had the\nright to an attorney, either retained or appointed. See, Miranda,\nsupra; State v. Nave, 284 Neb. 477, 821 N.W.2d 723 (2012),\ncert. denied ___ U.S. ___, 133 S. Ct. 1595, 185 L. Ed. 2d\n591 (2013). As the U.S. Supreme Court has noted, the Fifth\nAmendment privilege against self-incrimination is \u201cfundamen-\ntal to our system of constitutional rule.\u201d See Miranda, 384\nU.S. at 468. Yet, \u201cthe expedient of giving an adequate warn-\ning as to the availability of the privilege [is] so simple.\u201d Id.\nJuranek should have been given the Miranda warnings before\nhe was interrogated.\n   As this case illustrates, questions intended to build a rap-\nport with a defendant can easily cross the line into inter-\nrogation. The obvious goal of building a rapport is to entice\na defendant to talk, at first perhaps about general matters,\nbut ultimately about the crime being investigated. See, State\nv. Hughes, 272 S.W.3d 246, 255 (Mo. App. 2008) (offi-\ncer builds rapport \u201cto facilitate . . . further interrogation\u201d);\nRichard A.

Rev. 1000, 1018 (2001)\n(\u201crapport-building small talk\u201d used by interrogators to mini-\nmize significance of Miranda and thereby elicit waiver). As\n\f    Nebraska Advance Sheets\n858\t287 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\nan interview moves toward the subject of the investigation,\nit becomes more likely that an officer\u2019s questions will elicit\nan incriminating response. Because an officer cannot be held\naccountable for unforeseeable results of his or her questions,\nwe focus on whether, when asking any particular question, an\nofficer should have known that the question was likely to elicit\nan incriminating response. See State v. Bormann, 279 Neb.\n320, 777 N.W.2d 829 (2010). In the instant case, the particular\ncircumstances surrounding Juranek\u2019s custody and the specific\ncontext of the detective\u2019s question were such that the detective\nshould have known that his question would elicit an incrimi-\nnating response.\n   [12] Juranek\u2019s statement in response to the question \u201cDo you\nwant to tell it to me?\u201d was the result of a custodial interroga-\ntion conducted without Miranda warnings. Unless adequate\nprotective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion\ninherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from\nthe defendant can truly be the product of his or her free choice.\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed.\n2d 694 (1966). The district court erred in admitting Juranek\u2019s\nresponse to the question.\n\n                    b. Statements Following\n                      Miranda Advisement\n   After Juranek was given the Miranda warnings, he waived\nhis rights and agreed to talk to the detective. During the remain-\nder of the interview, Juranek made numerous other incriminat-\ning statements that repeated his unwarned confession. Juranek\nargues that because he confessed before receiving the Miranda\nwarnings, his subsequent waiver was not voluntary, and that\nhis post-Miranda confessions should also be excluded. We do\nnot agree.\n   Juranek\u2019s argument is based on Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S.\n600, 604, 124 S. Ct. 2601, 159 L. Ed. 2d 643 (2004), in which\nthe U.S. Supreme Court addressed the two-step interrogation\ntechnique of (1) giving Miranda warnings only after inter-\nrogation has produced a confession and then (2) questioning\nthe suspect so as to \u201ccover the same ground a second time,\u201d\nbut this time with Miranda warnings. A plurality of the Court\n\f                   Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t                        STATE v. JURANEK\t859\n\t                        Cite as 287 Neb. 846\n\nconcluded that \u201cwhen Miranda warnings are inserted in the\nmidst of coordinated and continuing interrogation, they are\nlikely to mislead and \u2018depriv[e] a defendant of knowledge\nessential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and\nthe consequences of abandoning them.\u2019\u201d See Seibert, 542 U.S.\nat 613-14 (alteration in original) (quoting Moran v. Burbine,\n475 U.S. 412, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1986)). The\nplurality explained that when a suspect is advised of his or\nher Miranda rights in the middle of an interrogation, the issue\nbecomes whether the warnings effectively advised that he or\nshe \u201ccould choose to stop talking even if he [or she] had talked\nearlier.\u201d See Seibert, 542 U.S. at 612.\n   Before Seibert, the U.S. Supreme Court had rejected this\napproach. In Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 309, 105 S. Ct.\n1285, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1985), the Court addressed the identi-\ncal question and concluded that\n      [i]t is an unwarranted extension of Miranda to hold that\n      a simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccom-\n      panied by any actual coercion or other circumstances\n      calculated to undermine the suspect\u2019s ability to exercise\n      his free will, so taints the investigatory process that a\n      subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective\n      for some indeterminate period.\n   In Seibert, 542 U.S. at 615, the U.S. Supreme Court dis-\ntinguished Elstad based on facts in Seibert that indicated the\nMiranda warnings, given after interrogation produced a confes-\nsion, were not \u201ceffective enough to accomplish their object.\u201d\nThe Court mentioned the following facts as possible indicators\nthat the Miranda warnings were ineffective:\n      the completeness and detail of the questions and answers\n      in the first round of interrogation, the overlapping content\n      of the two statements, the timing and setting of the first\n      and the second, the continuity of police personnel, and the\n      degree to which the interrogator\u2019s questions treated the\n      second round as continuous with the first.\nSee Seibert, 542 U.S. at 615. Of particular significance to\nthe Court\u2019s conclusion that Seibert\u2019s pre-Miranda confession\nmade the later Miranda warnings ineffective was the fact the\nquestioning before the Miranda warnings was \u201csystematic,\n\f    Nebraska Advance Sheets\n860\t287 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\nexhaustive, and managed with psychological skill\u201d to such an\nextent that after the unwarned interrogation, \u201cthere was little,\nif anything, of incriminating potential left unsaid.\u201d See Seibert,\n542 U.S. at 616.\n   Since Seibert, the U.S. Supreme Court has concluded that\nthe two-step interrogation technique condemned in Seibert is\nnot necessarily present in every scenario involving the pairing\nof unwarned and warned interrogations. In Bobby v. Dixon, ___\nU.S. ___, 132 S. Ct. 26, 181 L. Ed. 2d 328 (2011), the Court\ndeclined to hold a defendant\u2019s waiver of his Miranda rights\nineffective for the reason that the circumstances surrounding\nthe interrogation distinguished it from the two-step interroga-\ntion technique condemned in Seibert.\n   In the case at bar, the facts are readily distinguishable from\nMissouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600, 124 S. Ct. 2601, 159 L. Ed.\n2d 643 (2004). The circumstances of the pre- and post-Miranda\ninterrogations of Juranek did not rise to the level of making the\nMiranda warnings ineffective. Considering that the detective\nasked one question before Juranek made his confession and\nthat Juranek was given the Miranda warnings approximately\n2 minutes into the interrogation, we cannot say that the pre-\nMiranda interrogation left little to be said. In Seibert, the ques-\ntions before the Miranda warning were systematic, exhaustive,\nand managed with psychological skill. Here, the pre-Miranda\ninterrogation of Juranek lasted less than 2 minutes. It did\nnot touch upon key points in the investigation, such as how\nJuranek knew McBride, how the stabbing occurred, or where\nthe weapon Juranek used could be found. The facts are suf-\nficiently distinguishable from those in Seibert.\n   Juranek\u2019s pre-Miranda confession did not render ineffective\nthe Miranda warnings that he was given less than a minute\nlater. In light of Juranek\u2019s waiver of his Miranda rights, the\nstatements he made after he was given the Miranda warnings\nwere admissible.\n                      c. Harmless Error\n  The district court erred in admitting evidence of Juranek\u2019s\nconfession during the pre-Miranda interrogation. However, we\n\f                   Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t                        STATE v. JURANEK\t861\n\t                        Cite as 287 Neb. 846\n\nconclude that this evidence was cumulative to other admis-\nsible evidence and that its admission was harmless error.\n   [13-15] \u201c[T]he improper admission of evidence is a \u2018trial\u2019\nerror and subject to harmless error review.\u201d State v. Sorensen,\n283 Neb. 932, 938, 814 N.W.2d 371, 377 (2012). Harmless\nerror review looks to the basis on which the trier of fact actu-\nally rested its verdict; the inquiry is not whether in a trial that\noccurred without the error a guilty verdict would surely have\nbeen rendered, but, rather, whether the actual guilty verdict\nrendered in the questioned trial was surely unattributable to\nthe error. State v. Pangborn, 286 Neb. 363, 836 N.W.2d 790\n(2013). Erroneous admission of evidence is harmless error and\ndoes not require reversal if the evidence is cumulative and\nother relevant evidence, properly admitted, supports the find-\ning by the trier of fact. State v. Robinson, 271 Neb. 698, 715\nN.W.2d 531 (2006).\n   In the pre-Miranda interrogation, Juranek said that (1)\nMcBride threatened to kill Juranek, (2) Juranek stabbed\nMcBride, and (3) Juranek would have stabbed McBride again\nbut for the fact that McBride ran away. These three facts were\nproved by other admissible evidence. When Andersen first\napproached Juranek in the police cruiser, Juranek stated, \u201cHe\nthreatened me so I stuck him.\u201d In the police cruiser, Juranek\nstated that he stabbed McBride once and \u201cwanted to stick him\nagain.\u201d And in the post-Miranda portion of the interrogation,\nJuranek said at least two times that McBride threatened to\nkill Juranek and that Juranek stabbed McBride. These state-\nments were evidence that McBride threatened Juranek, that\nJuranek stabbed McBride, and that Juranek wanted to stab\nMcBride again.\n   Other relevant evidence supported the district court\u2019s find-\ning of guilt. One witness testified that she saw Juranek stab\nthe other man, who was later identified as McBride, in the\nfight and chase McBride when he tried to get away. Also, the\nofficer that arrived first at the scene of the stabbing testified\nthat McBride identified his assailant as \u201cMike\u201d and pointed\nto a man later identified as Juranek. In addition, after waiv-\ning his Miranda rights, Juranek confessed to seeking out\n\f    Nebraska Advance Sheets\n862\t287 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\nMcBride with the explicit purpose of killing him and to stab-\nbing McBride under the left rib cage.\n   The evidence that was properly admitted supported the\ndistrict court\u2019s determination that Juranek was guilty of the\ncrimes charged. Furthermore, the erroneously admitted state-\nment by Juranek was cumulative of other evidence. As such,\nthe admission of Juranek\u2019s confession obtained during the pre-\nMiranda interrogation was harmless error.\n\n                   2. Sufficiency of Evidence\n   Juranek assigns that there was insufficient evidence to con-\nvict him. He specifically argues that there was insufficient\nevidence to prove that his actions were premeditated and\ndeliberate, because his actions \u201cmore appropriately fit into the\ndefinition of \u2018sudden quarrel manslaughter.\u2019\u201d Brief for appel-\nlant at 12.\n   When reviewing a criminal conviction for sufficiency of the\nevidence to sustain the conviction, the relevant question for\nan appellate court is whether, after viewing the evidence in\nthe light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier\nof fact could have found the essential elements of the crime\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. In reviewing a criminal conviction,\nan appellate court does not resolve conflicts in the evidence,\npass on the credibility of witnesses, or reweigh the evidence.\nState v. McGuire, 286 Neb. 494, 837 N.W.2d 767 (2013).\n   Under Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-303 (Reissue 2008), an element\nof first degree murder is that the act of killing was done \u201cpur-\nposely and with deliberate and premeditated malice.\u201d Juranek\nclaims that the evidence was insufficient to prove deliberate\nand premeditated malice. He does not argue that the evi-\ndence was insufficient as to any of the other elements of first\ndegree murder.\n   The State adduced evidence that on September 14, 2011,\nJuranek learned for the first time that McBride had threatened\nto kill him. The State also presented evidence that in response\nto this knowledge, Juranek sought McBride out with the pur-\npose of killing him. At least five times during the post-Miranda\ninterrogation, Juranek explained that he was deliberately seek-\ning out McBride with the intent to kill him. At one point,\n\f                        Nebraska Advance Sheets\n\t                             STATE v. JURANEK\t863\n\t                             Cite as 287 Neb. 846\n\nJuranek said that on the day of the stabbing, he walked around\nuntil he found McBride. At another point, Juranek said, \u201cIf I\nhad had a gun, I would have emptied the clip.\u201d This evidence\nwas sufficient basis for a reasonable trier of fact to find beyond\na reasonable doubt that Juranek killed McBride purposely and\nwith deliberate and premeditated malice.\n   The State adduced sufficient evidence for a rational trier of\nfact to find that Juranek killed McBride purposely and with\ndeliberate and premeditated malice. There was sufficient evi-\ndence to support Juranek\u2019s conviction for first degree murder.\nThere was sufficient evidence to support a conviction for use\nof a deadly weapon to commit a felony.\n\n                       VI. CONCLUSION\n   For the reasons set forth, we affirm Juranek\u2019s convictions\nand sentences.\n                                                       Affirmed.\n   Heavican, C.J., participating on briefs.\n   Heavican, C.J., concurring.\n   I concur in the decision of the court, which affirmed Juranek\u2019s\nconvictions and sentences. But I write separately because I dis-\nagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Juranek\u2019s statement to\nthe detective following the detective\u2019s question \u201cDo you want\nto tell it to me?\u201d should have been suppressed.\n   As is noted by the majority, in determining whether there is\nan interrogation for Miranda purposes, the question to ask is\nwhether \u201c\u2018a reasonable and disinterested person [would] con-\nclude that police conduct, directed to the suspect or defendant\nin custody, would likely elicit an incriminating response from\nthat suspect or defendant.\u2019\u201d1\n   In this case, as was discussed in more detail by the major-\nity, Juranek made certain statements while in the police cruiser\non his way to the police station from the scene of his arrest.\nThose statements were incriminating. Upon arriving at the\npolice station, a detective met Juranek and attempted to shake\nhis hand. Juranek refused, indicating that his (i.e., Juranek\u2019s)\nhands were \u201cdirty.\u201d The detective then told Juranek that he\n\n\u20021\t\n      State v. Bormann, 279 Neb. 320, 327, 777 N.W.2d. 829, 836 (2010).\n\f    Nebraska Advance Sheets\n864\t287 NEBRASKA REPORTS\n\n\n\nknew that Juranek had \u201cshared\u201d some information with the\ntransporting officer. Juranek responded that he \u201ctold it to him\n14 times.\u201d The detective responded, \u201cOk. Do you want to tell\nit to me?\u201d\n    The detective testified that he was attempting to build a\nrapport with Juranek and did not intend to elicit an incriminat-\ning response from Juranek by asking this question. I reject the\nmajority\u2019s conclusion that the detective \u201cshould have expected\u201d\nthat Juranek would confess again. In my view, the detective\u2019s\nactions were not inconsistent with rapport building. The detec-\ntive attempted to shake Juranek\u2019s hand. He inquired of Juranek\nwhether Juranek wanted to tell him what he told the other\nofficer\u2014at its root, a question requiring only a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d\nanswer.2 While I agree that ultimately the detective wanted to\ntalk about the incriminating statements Juranek had made to\nAndersen and later in the cruiser, I do not agree that a \u201crea-\nsonable and disinterested person\u201d would find that the detec-\ntive was, in this moment, attempting to elicit an incriminating\nresponse from Juranek.\n    For this reason, I would conclude that Juranek\u2019s statement\nneed not be suppressed.\n\n\u20022\t\n      See, e.g., State v.
