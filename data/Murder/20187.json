See Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 19.02(b)(2) (West\n\n1994). The district court adjudged him guilty and assessed punishment at imprisonment for life, as\n\ncalled for in a plea bargain agreement.1\n\n                The clerk\u2019s record contains a written waiver of appeal signed by appellant, his\n\nattorneys, and the trial judge. This document, which reflects a knowing and voluntary waiver of the\n\nright to appeal, was signed on the day sentence was imposed in open court. A defendant who\n\nknowingly and intelligently waives his right to appeal may not thereafter appeal without the consent\n\nof the trial court. Ex parte Dickey, 543 S.W.2d 99 (Tex. Crim. App. 1976); see also Hurd v. State,\n\n548 S.W.2d 388 (Tex. Crim. App. 1977); Reed v. State, 516 S.W.2d 680 (Tex. Crim. App. 1974).\n\nThe record reflects that appellant sought and was denied permission to appeal. Appellant\u2019s general\n\n\n   1\n       As its part of the bargain, the State abandoned a capital murder count.\n\fnotice of appeal also fails to confer jurisdiction on this Court. See Cooper v. State, No. 1100-99, slip\n\nop. at 6-8 (Tex. Crim. App. April 4, 2001); Whitt v. State, No. 03-00-00194-CR (Tex. App.\u2014Austin\n\nApril 19, 2001, no pet. h.); Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(b)(3).\n\n                The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\nBefore Chief Justice Aboussie, Justices Yeakel and Patterson\n\nDismissed for Want of Jurisdiction\n\nFiled: May 31, 2001\n\nDo Not Publish\n\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\f",
