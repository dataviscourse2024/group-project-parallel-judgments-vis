Facts and Procedural History\n\n              In December 2016, Leannais shot and killed his friend, Anthony\n\nStanford, Jr., while playing with his 9 mm Glock handgun during a dinner party in\n\nhis home. As a result of the incident, Leannais was charged in a four-count\n\nindictment with involuntary manslaughter, using weapons while intoxicated,\n\nreckless homicide, and assault. All the counts included a forfeiture specification,\n\nseeking forfeiture of the 9 mm Glock handgun.\n\n              At trial, the state introduced a video recording of the dinner party that\n\nLeannais broadcasted on Facebook Live on the night of the shooting. (Tr. 1054.)\n\nThe first part of the video shows Stanford visiting Leannais in his West Tech Loft\n\napartment while Leannais prepares steaks for his guests. Leannais indicates on the\n\nvideo that he is drinking Tito\u2019s vodka, and Stanford is seen making himself a vodka\n\fdrink. Shortly thereafter, Stanford leaves the apartment and indicates he will return\n\nsoon.\n\n               Meanwhile, Leannais takes the Facebook audience on a tour of his\n\napartment, pointing out certain items of interest such as artwork and a particular\n\nhouseplant. He also shows the audience his Glock 9 mm pistol and notes a skull\n\ndecal on the rear of the slide, which he calls \u201cthe punisher.\u201d After the tour, two other\n\nguests arrive: John Frenden and his girlfriend, Ashley Karmie. Leannais introduces\n\nthem to the Facebook audience and continues cooking steaks for his guests.\n\n               Moments later, Frenden is seen in the video playing with a decorative\n\nsword that was hanging on the wall. He disappears from view and reappears with\n\nLeannais\u2019s gun. Leannais warns Frenden that the gun is loaded and takes it from\n\nhim. Leannais removes the magazine, racks it twice, and pulls the trigger to make\n\nsure the gun is not loaded. He then hands it back to Frenden, who puts it in his\n\nmouth and says, \u201cLast thing you hear is \u2018I didn\u2019t know it was loaded.\u2019\u201d (Facebook\n\nvideo 1:05:49.) Leannais shows the live round at the top of the magazine to the\n\nFacebook audience and says: \u201cThat would have made a bloody mess.\u201d (Facebook\n\nvideo 1:06:16.) He then appears to place the magazine in his pocket, and Frenden\n\nreplies: \u201cYou don\u2019t know about the secret clip.\u201d (Facebook video 1:06:40.)\n\n               Stanford soon returns to the apartment.         For the remaining 13\n\nminutes of video, Leannais cooks two more steaks while Karmie puts makeup on in\n\nfront of a mirror next to the dining table. Meanwhile, Frenden walks around the\n\fapartment. He refers to a \u201csecret case\u201d and appears to be carrying something toward\n\nthe kitchen counter but returns it to some other location. Frenden picks up the iPad\n\nthat has been broadcasting the scene on Facebook Live and turns it off at\n\napproximately 8:45 p.m. (Facebook video 1:19:00.)\n\n              The four friends sat down for dinner off camera. Karmie testified at\n\ntrial that she does not know how the handgun made its way to the dining table.\n\nHowever, at some point, Leannais was \u201cjoking around\u201d with the gun and pointed it\n\nat her. Karmie testified that even though she believed the gun was unloaded, she\n\nducked and told Leannais not to point it at her. (Tr. 591.) Karmie saw Leannais turn\n\ntoward the other guests and heard a shot. (Tr. 591-592.) Karmie looked up at\n\nLeannais and noticed that his face had \u201cturned white.\u201d Both Leannais and Stanford\n\nexchanged looks of \u201cutter disbelief.\u201d (Tr. 592.)\n\n              Stanford ran out of the apartment followed by Leannais. (Tr. 595.)\n\nLeannais returned moments later, asked Frenden and Karmie to leave, and called\n\n911. Officer James Zak of the Cleveland Police Department responded to the scene\n\njust as EMS were loading Stanford into an ambulance. Leannais met Officer Zak\n\noutside the apartment building and led him and two other officers to his apartment\n\nto explain what happened. Officer Zak\u2019s body camera captured the interview on\n\nfilm, and the body camera video was introduced as evidence at trial. (Tr. 1054.)\n\n              Leannais, who had a concealed-carry (\u201cCCW\u201d) permit, admitted to\n\nOfficer Zak that he fired the shot that ultimately caused Stanford\u2019s death. He\n\fexplained: \u201cWe all had dinner, we had a couple of drinks, and we were all joking\n\naround, it was on the counter and we were all joking around with it, I shouldn\u2019t have\n\nit out.\u201d (Body camera video 2:37-2:47.) When asked how the shooting occurred,\n\nLeannais explained: \u201cWe were all sitting around, there was no magazine in the\n\nchamber, and I pointed it just joking around. As I was bringing it back down, I\n\npulled the trigger as I was bringing it back down and got him.\u201d (Body camera video\n\n5:40-6:02; tr. 435.)\n\n               Leannais told Officer Zak that prior to the shooting, he removed the\n\nmagazine from the chamber and did not know there was a live round in the gun.\n\n(Body camera 10:30-10:58.) Officer Zak referenced Leannais\u2019s CCW permit and\n\nreminded Leannais that the CCW class teaches permit holders to always treat guns\n\nas if they are loaded. (Tr. 438.) When asked how much he had to drink prior to the\n\nshooting, Leannais replied that he \u201chad three drinks,\u201d and later admitted that he was\n\n\u201cbuzzed a little bit.\u201d   (Body camera video 6:10-6:16; 20.00; tr. 439.)          While\n\nexamining the scene, Officer Zak observed that the firearm did not have a magazine\n\ninside the handle, but he found a magazine on the kitchen counter along with one\n\nloose live round. (Tr. 430.) Leannais informed Officer Zak that he had a total of\n\nthree magazines.\n\n               Kristen Koeth, a firearms examiner with the Cuyahoga County\n\nRegional Forensic Science Laboratory in the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner\u2019s\n\nOffice, testified that there are two ways to load a live round into Leannais\u2019s gun. (Tr.\n\f833.) First, if there is a magazine in the gun, the user could load one round into the\n\nchamber by pulling back the slide. Second, the user could load the gun without a\n\nmagazine by pulling back the slide, dropping a round into the empty chamber, and\n\nallowing the slide to move forward. (Tr. 833.) Koeth explained that unlike other\n\ngun models, Leannais\u2019s Glock handgun could be fired without a magazine inside.\n\nKoeth also found that the gun did not have a \u201chair trigger,\u201d meaning that the user\n\nwould have to apply some pressure on the trigger in order to fire the gun. (Tr. 840.)\n\nKoeth compared the hollow point bullet recovered from Stanford\u2019s body with bullets\n\ntest-fired from Leannais\u2019s gun in the laboratory and concluded that the bullet in\n\nStanford\u2019s body was fired from Leannais\u2019s gun. (Tr. 848.)\n\n               Koeth reviewed the portion of the Facebook Live video where\n\nLeannais took the gun from Frenden and rendered it safe. She testified that\n\nremoving the magazine, racking the slide, and pulling the trigger would have cleared\n\nall live rounds in the gun. (Tr. 854.) She explained, however, that \u201cyou always have\n\nto check and make sure that there\u2019s not one in the chamber.\u201d Koeth further\n\ncommented that gun-safety classes, such as those required for CCW permits,\n\ninstruct gun owners to treat every firearm as if it is loaded and that the user should\n\nnever point the gun at anything he or she does not intend to shoot. (Tr. 851.) Koeth\n\nalso testified that the \u201cnumber one rule\u201d of gun safety is to always assume there is a\n\nbullet in the battery ready to be fired. (Tr. 855.)\n\f              Detective Gregory Cook, a homicide detective with the Cleveland\n\nPolice Department, interviewed Leannais as part of the homicide investigation. The\n\ninterview was recorded, and the video of the interview was entered into evidence.\n\n(Tr. 1054.) During the interview, Leannais told Detective Cook that Frenden spoke\n\nto him about using the gun as a prop for a movie. (Tr. 1000.) At trial, Detective\n\nCook compared the portion of the Facebook Live video showing Leannais racking\n\nthe slide back to clear the weapon with another part of the video in which Leannais\n\nis heard talking to Frenden about playing a prank on someone using blanks.\n\n(Facebook video 1:13:50.)\n\n              The audience cannot see Leannais and Frenden in this portion of the\n\nvideo, but their actions are heard. Cook testified that clicking sounds heard during\n\nthe conversation about using blanks were the same sounds the audience previously\n\nheard when Leannais racked the slide back after taking the gun from Frenden. (Tr.\n\n1004.) He explained that it \u201c[s]ounded like he racked the action back, and it\n\nsounded like it stayed back because when they \u2014 at the end, it sounded like he\n\nallowed the slide to slam forward.\u201d (Tr. 1004.) Cook testified that this could have\n\nbeen the time when a live round was put into the chamber of the gun without using\n\nthe magazine because the sounds were consistent with that activity. (Tr. 1004-\n\n1005.) Leannais admitted in his statement to Detective Cook that he failed to check\n\nthe chamber of the gun before pulling the trigger. (Tr. 1006.) Detective Cook\n\ntestified that Leannais should have checked the chamber of the gun when he it\n\fpicked up an hour after handling it in a way in which someone could have dropped\n\na round into the slide without using the magazine. (Tr. 1047.)\n\n               The jury found Leannais guilty of involuntary manslaughter, reckless\n\nhomicide, and assault, but not guilty of using weapons while intoxicated. The state\n\nconceded that all Leannais\u2019s convictions merged for sentencing purposes and\n\nelected to have Leannais sentenced on the reckless homicide charge. The trial court\n\nsentenced Leannais to two years on the reckless homicide charge to be served\n\nconsecutive to the three years on the firearm specification, for an aggregate five-year\n\nprison term. Leannais now appeals his convictions.\n\n                              II. Law and Analysis\n\n                                   A. Recklessly\n\n               In the first assignment of error, Leannais argues the state failed to\n\npresent sufficient evidence to prove that he acted recklessly.         In the second\n\nassignment of error, Leannais argues his convictions are against the manifest weight\n\nof the evidence because the state failed to present credible evidence that he acted\n\nrecklessly. We discuss these assigned errors together because they are closely\n\nrelated.\n\n               The test for sufficiency requires a determination of whether the\n\nprosecution met its burden of production at trial. State v. Bowden, 8th Dist.\n\nCuyahoga No. 92266, 2009-Ohio-3598, \u00b6 12. The relevant inquiry is whether, after\n\nviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier\n\fof fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991),\n\nparagraph two of the syllabus.\n\n               In contrast to sufficiency, \u201cweight of the evidence involves the\n\ninclination of the greater amount of credible evidence.\u201d State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). While \u201csufficiency of the evidence is a test\n\nof adequacy as to whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support a verdict as a\n\nmatter of law, * * * weight of the evidence addresses the evidence\u2019s effect of inducing\n\nbelief.\u201d State v. Wilson, 113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, \u00b6\n\n25, citing Thompkins at 386-387. \u201cIn other words, a reviewing court asks whose\n\nevidence is more persuasive \u2014 the state\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s?\u201d Id. The reviewing\n\ncourt must consider all the evidence in the record, the reasonable inferences, and\n\nthe credibility of the witnesses to determine \u201c\u2018whether in resolving conflicts in the\n\nevidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of\n\njustice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u2019\u201d Thompkins\n\nat 387, quoting State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\n\n               As previously stated, Leannais was found guilty of involuntary\n\nmanslaughter, reckless homicide, and assault that merged into reckless homicide.\n\nIt is undisputed that all three charges required the state to establish that Leannais\n\facted recklessly.1 Leannais argues there is no evidence that he acted recklessly\n\nbecause he did not know the gun was loaded when he pulled the trigger. He\n\ncontends that in order to demonstrate recklessness, the state had to prove that\n\nLeannais knew or had reason to believe the gun was loaded and that he intentionally\n\npulled the trigger. However, had Leannais intentionally pulled the trigger knowing\n\nthe gun was loaded, he would have been charged with murder and felonious assault\n\nrather than reckless homicide. One commits murder by purposely causing the death\n\nof another. See R.C. 2903.02(A). And a person acts purposely when it is the person\u2019s\n\nspecific intention to cause a certain result. R.C. 2901.22(A). Felonious assault\n\noccurs when a person knowingly causes serious physical harm to another. R.C.\n\n2903.11(A)(1). \u201cA person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is\n\naware that the person\u2019s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably\n\nbe of a certain nature.\u201d R.C. 2901.22(B). Therefore, had Leannais known the gun\n\nwas loaded when he pulled the trigger, he could have been charged with murder and\n\nfelonious assault instead of reckless homicide.\n\n\n\n\n1 Leannais was charged with misdemeanor assault in Count 3 of the indictment, which\nalleges that he \u201cdid recklessly cause serious physical harm to Anthony Stanford.\u201d\nLeannais was charged with involuntary manslaughter in Count 1, which alleges that\nhe \u201cdid cause the death of Anthony Stanford and such death was the proximate result\nof Steven Leannais committing or attempting to commit the misdemeanor * * * of\nassault.\u201d And to commit reckless homicide, as alleged in Count 3, the state had to\nprove that Leannais \u201cdid recklessly cause the death of Anthony Stanford.\u201d\n\f              It is undisputed that Leannais did not knowingly or purposely harm\n\nStanford or cause his death. In contrast to a purposeful or knowing mental state,\n\nR.C. 2901.22(C) defines the culpable mental state of \u201crecklessness\u201d as follows:\n\n      A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the\n      consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable\n      risk that the person\u2019s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is\n      likely to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to\n      circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the consequences,\n      the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such\n      circumstances are likely to exist.\n\nR.C. 2901.01(A)(8) defines \u201c[s]ubstantial risk\u201d as \u201ca strong possibility, as\n\ncontrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur\n\nor that certain circumstances may exist.\u201d\n\n              Leannais argues there was no evidence that he created a substantial\n\nrisk of harm that resulted in Stanford\u2019s death. He cites State v. Peck, 172 Ohio\n\nApp.3d 25, 2007-Ohio-2730, 872 N.E.2d 1263 (10th Dist.), to support his argument.\n\nPeck was a tow-truck driver, who was called to pull a tractor trailer out of a median.\n\nWhen he arrived on the scene, he informed the driver that his tow truck was too\n\nsmall to carry the load and that a heavy tow truck was on its way. In setting up the\n\nheavy tow, Peck used a \u201csnatch block\u201d (a large pulley with an attached hook) that\n\nwas not sufficiently rated to pull the weight of the tractor-trailer. As a result, the\n\nsnatch block broke and catapulted into a passing car. The driver of a passing car was\n\nkilled as a result of the incident, and Peck was charged with, and convicted of,\n\nreckless homicide. Id. at \u00b6 5.\n\f               In reversing Peck\u2019s reckless homicide conviction, the Tenth District\n\nCourt of Appeals found that the evidence failed to prove that Peck knew the risk\n\nassociated with his conduct because Peck was unaware that his equipment was not\n\nsufficient to pull a tractor-trailer. The court held that \u201c[a] mere failure to perceive\n\nor avoid a risk, because of a lack of due care, does not constitute reckless conduct.\u201d\n\nId. at \u00b6 12. Rather, to be convicted of recklessness, \u201cone must recognize the risk of\n\nthe conduct and proceed with a perverse disregard for that risk.\u201d Id. The court\n\nfurther explained:\n\n       In contrast to the actor who proceeds with knowledge of a risk, the\n       failure of a person to perceive or avoid a risk that his conduct may\n       cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature is negligence. R.C.\n       2901.22(D). Recklessness requires more than ordinary negligent\n       conduct.     The difference between the terms \u201crecklessly\u201d and\n       \u201cnegligently\u201d is normally one of a kind, rather than of a degree. \u201cEach\n       actor creates a risk of harm. The reckless actor is aware of the risk\n       and disregards it; the negligent actor is not aware of the risk but\n       should have been aware of it.\u201d Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, 15th Ed.,\n       Section 27, at 170 (emphasis sic); see, also, State v. Wall (S.D. 1992),\n       481 N.W.2d 259, 262.\n\nId. at \u00b6 13.\n\n               Applying Peck to the facts of this case, Leannais argues he was not\n\naware that pulling the trigger of his 9 mm Glock handgun posed a risk of harm\n\nbecause he believed it was unloaded. However, Leannais and Frenden played with\n\nthe gun after Leannais removed the magazine and rendered the gun safe. In the\n\nFacebook Live video, Frenden and Leannais talk about using the gun to play a prank\n\non someone using blanks. Although the audience cannot see Frenden and Leannais\n\nin the film, the gun is heard being racked in a way that it could be loaded from the\n\ftop of the slide rather than with a magazine through the handle. (Tr. 1006.)\n\nDetective Cook testified that a live bullet could have been loaded in the gun at this\n\npoint in the video because the sounds were consistent with that activity. (Tr. 1004-\n\n1005.)\n\n                When Officer Zak entered the apartment after the shooting, he found\n\nthe gun, a magazine containing hollow point bullets, and one loose round on the\n\nkitchen counter.2 (Tr. 430.) Although Leannais previously had the magazine in his\n\npossession when he removed it from the gun, he either reloaded a bullet or left the\n\ngun and magazine accessible to his guests, who could have loaded it. Indeed,\n\nLeannais told Detective Cook in the recorded interview: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m thinking\n\nthat if [Frenden] cocked it and there was one in the chamber the whole time and I\n\ndidn\u2019t check it * * *.\u201d (Leannais video statement 14:26-14:42.) Leannais also\n\nadmitted to Detective Cook: \u201c\u2018The only thing mistaken is that I didn\u2019t check the\n\nchamber of the gun[.]\u2019\u201d (Tr. 1006.) Therefore, the evidence shows Leannais was\n\naware of a strong possibility that the gun could have been reloaded after he had\n\nrendered it safe earlier that night. We, therefore, find Peck distinguishable from the\n\nfacts of this case.\n\n                The facts of this case are more like the facts presented in State v.\n\nGough, 5th Dist. Licking No. 08-CA-55, 2009-Ohio-322. In Gough, the Fifth\n\nDistrict found there was sufficient evidence to sustain a reckless homicide\n\n\n2 Police confiscated two other magazines from Leannais\u2019s bedroom that contained\nbullets made by other manufacturers. (Tr. 982-983.)\n\fconviction where the defendant, who had been drinking at a party, shot the victim\n\nin the head while playing with the victim\u2019s gun. As in the instant case, the gun was\n\ninitially loaded, and subsequently unloaded. After it was unloaded, the bullets were\n\nplaced on an end table. Id. at \u00b6 4. One of the guests asked to see a bullet, and the\n\ngun owner handed him a bullet. After the guest examined it, he returned it to the\n\ngun owner, who loaded it into the gun. Minutes later, Gough picked up the gun,\n\naimed it at the gun owner\u2019s head, and pulled the trigger.          The gun owner\n\nsubsequently died of a gunshot wound to the head, and Gough was convicted of\n\nreckless homicide. Id. at \u00b6 6, 11.\n\n               On appeal, Gough argued there was insufficient evidence that he\n\nacted recklessly because there was no evidence that he knew the gun was loaded.\n\nThe Fifth District rejected that argument and found that Gough knew the risks\n\ncreated by his conduct because the gun owner generally kept the gun loaded, and\n\nthe gun had been loaded earlier that night. Id. at \u00b6 23. Leannais\u2019s gun was also\n\nloaded earlier in the night. Although it was subsequently unloaded, Leannais and\n\nFrenden racked the slide in a manner in which a bullet could have been reloaded\n\nwithout the magazine. Because Leannais played with the gun after he unloaded it,\n\nhe was aware of the possibility that it could have been reloaded. Indeed, his\n\nadmissions that he should have checked the chamber evidences the fact that he was\n\naware of the risks involved in pulling the trigger. Therefore, there was competent,\n\ncredible evidence that Leannais acted recklessly when he caused Stanford\u2019s death.\n\n               The first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\f                     B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n               In the third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error, Leannais argues\n\nhis trial counsel was ineffective because they (1) failed to request a jury instruction\n\non \u201caccident,\u201d (2) failed to cross-examine a state witness about an agreement not to\n\nprosecute, and (3) failed to object to the state\u2019s representation of the law on\n\nrecklessness and negligence. We discuss these assigned errors together because\n\nthey involve the same standard for assessing an ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nclaim.\n\n               To establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, the appellant\n\nmust show that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient\n\nperformance prejudiced his defense. State v. Drummond, 111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-\n\nOhio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 205, citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n\n104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Prejudice is established when the defendant\n\ndemonstrates \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors,\n\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a\n\nprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Strickland at 694.\n\n\n\n                             1. Accident Instruction\n\n               Leannais argues Stanford\u2019s death was the result of a tragic accident\n\nand that his trial counsel was ineffective because they failed to request a jury\n\ninstruction on accident. However, \u201caccident\u201d is not an affirmative defense. Rather,\n\nit is \u201ca factual defense that denies that the accused acted with the degree of\n\fculpability or mens rea required for the offense, when that involves purposeful\n\nconduct.\u201d In re F.D., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102135, 2015-Ohio-2405, \u00b6 32, citing\n\nState v. Taylor, 5th Dist. Richland No. 2005-CA-0112, 2006-Ohio-4064, \u00b6 35.\n\n               As previously stated, Leannais was not charged with any offenses\n\ninvolving purposeful or intentional conduct. He was charged with offenses that\n\nrequired the state to prove that he acted recklessly. In accordance with the statutory\n\ndefinition of \u201crecklessness,\u201d the court instructed the jury that\n\n      [a] person acts recklessly when with heedless indifference to the\n      consequences the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable\n      risk that the person\u2019s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is\n      likely to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to\n      circumstances when with heedless indifference to the consequences\n      the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such\n      circumstances are likely to exist. Risk means a significant possibility\n      as contrasted with a remote possibility that a certain result may occur\n      or that certain circumstances may exist.\n\n      * * *\n\n      If you find that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt\n      any one of the essential elements of the offense of reckless homicide\n      as charged in Count 3 of the indictment, your verdict must be not\n      guilty according to your findings.\n\n(Tr. 1092-1093.) This definition would have allowed the jury to understand that\n\nrecklessness requires conduct beyond that of mere accident. Therefore, had the\n\njury concluded that Leannais\u2019s conduct was an accident, it would have acquitted\n\nhim of any charges that required proof of recklessness. See, e.g., State v. Tiber, 7th\n\nDist. Belmont No. 88-B-28, 1990 Ohio App. LEXIS 1865 (May 17, 1990) (Jurors\n\nprovided definition of recklessness could \u201ceasily reason that defense to that charge\n\fwould be proof by the defendant of accident\u201d since \u201c[t]he phrases perversely\n\ndisregards a heedless indifference speak of a requirement going well beyond an\n\naccident.\u201d).   Therefore, inclusion of an accident instruction would not have\n\nchanged the outcome of the trial, and counsel\u2019s failure to request an accident\n\ninstruction does not meet the test for ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n                2. Failure to Cross-Examine State\u2019s Witness\n\n               Leannais further argues his trial counsel was ineffective because they\n\nfailed to cross-examine Frenden regarding the state\u2019s promise not to prosecute him\n\nfor allegedly tampering with evidence and tampering with records. However, had\n\ncounsel questioned Frenden about a promise not to prosecute him, it would have\n\nopened the door to the state asking Frenden to review the statements he made to\n\npolice prior to receiving any promises in order to prove that his testimony was\n\nconsistent with his earlier statements. Reviewing Frenden\u2019s prior statements would\n\nhave bolstered his trial testimony rather than discrediting it.\n\n               Trial counsel made a tactical decision to avoid the risk of having\n\nFrenden\u2019s testimony bolstered and relied instead on other methods of\n\nimpeachment.     For example, Frenden admitted on cross-examination he was\n\ndishonest and lost his license to practice law as a result of his \u201cdishonest and selfish\n\nmotives.\u201d (Tr. 569.) Frenden also admitted that after Leannais was in custody, he\n\nlied to jail personnel and signed in as Leannais\u2019s lawyer even though he was\n\ndisbarred. (Tr. 541.) Moreover, counsel got Frenden to admit that he urged\n\nLeannais to delete the Facebook Live video and that such an act could be viewed as\n\fa tampering with evidence. Under these circumstances, we cannot say Leannais\u2019s\n\ntrial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or that their failure to ask Frenden about\n\nthe state\u2019s promise not to prosecute him changed the outcome of the trial.\n\n                          3. State\u2019s Representations of\n                          Recklessness and Negligence\n\n               Finally, Leannais argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to\n\nobject to certain statements made by the prosecutor during his closing arguments\n\nthat conflated the concepts of recklessness and negligence. He contends the state\n\nadvised the jury that there were only two choices in this case; either Leannais was a\n\n\u201creasonably careful person,\u201d i.e., not negligent, or Leannais \u201cacted recklessly.\u201d\n\n(Appellant\u2019s brief at 38.) He further argues the state erroneously argued that the\n\nperson who \u201clocked away\u201d the gun is the \u201creasonably careful person\u201d who can claim\n\nnegligence, and the person who was \u201cpouring drinks\u201d for his guests takes a\n\n\u201csubstantial and unjustifiable risk.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief, citing tr. 1154-1155.)\n\n               However, these statements need to be read in context. Defense\n\ncounsel requested and received an instruction on the lesser included offense of\n\nnegligent homicide. Accordingly, the court instructed the jury on negligence, as\n\nfollows:\n\n      A person acts negligently when because of a substantial lapse from\n      due care the person failed to perceive or to avoid a risk that the\n      person\u2019s conduct may cause a certain result or be of a certain nature.\n      A person is negligent with respect to circumstances when because of\n      the substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive or to\n      avoid a risk that such circumstance may exist. Due care is the amount\n      of care which a reasonably careful person would use under the same\n      or similar circumstances.\n\f      The lapse or failure to use due care must be substantial. Substantial\n      is another word for material, which means being of real importance\n      or great consequence. Risk means a significant possibility as\n      contrasted with a remote possibility that a certain result may occur.\n\n(Tr. 1097.)\n\n              In light of these instructions, Leannais\u2019s trial counsel argued that\n\nLeannais was negligent rather than reckless because Leannais had a momentary\n\nlapse of due care when he handled the gun without checking to see if it was loaded.\n\n(Tr. 1145-1146.) In response, the state provided its own perspective on the difference\n\nbetween negligence and recklessness:\n\n      Couple ideas that are important when you consider negligent and\n      reckless. Negligent, one of the things you have to consider is due care.\n      And one of the elements of due care revolves around the reasonably\n      careful person. Contrast that with one of the ideas of recklessness we\n      have, which is the substantial and unjustifiable risk.\n\n(Tr. 1152.) We find nothing confusing or misleading about this argument. And in\n\nmaking the argument that Leannais acted recklessly, the state merely emphasized\n\nthe substantial risk involved in playing with a gun while drinking. In contrast to\n\ndefense counsel\u2019s characterization of Leannais\u2019s conduct, the prosecutor argued\n\nthat Leannais\u2019s reckless conduct began when he first introduced the gun in the\n\nFacebook Live video while he was drinking. (Tr. 1153.) The prosecutor explains:\n\n      That\u2019s when the recklessness begins. It begins there because he\u2019s\n      drinking. He\u2019s got people coming over who are going to drink. And\n      he\u2019s got a loaded gun just sitting around in his apartment \u2014 waiting\n      for something to happen.\n\n      * * *\n\f      How on earth can anyone say Mr. Leannais is the reasonably careful\n      person when he\u2019s drinking alcohol and he\u2019s got John Frenden coming\n      over with [the gun] out in the open?\n\n(Tr. 1153-1154.)   Although the state contrasted this behavior with that of a\n\n\u201creasonably careful person\u201d who makes sure his gun is \u201clocked away safely,\u201d such\n\nan argument does not preclude the jury from finding that Leannais was neither\n\nreckless nor \u201creasonably careful,\u201d but negligent. The state\u2019s description of a\n\n\u201creasonably careful person,\u201d was accurate and would not have prevented the jury\n\nfrom finding Leannais negligent if the facts supported such a finding. Indeed, the\n\njury received a verdict form for negligent homicide in the event it found that\n\nLeannais acted negligently rather than recklessly or carefully. Therefore, defense\n\ncounsel was not ineffective for failing to object to this argument because the\n\nargument was not erroneous and the outcome of the trial would not have been\n\ndifferent if the argument had been stricken.\n\n              Therefore, the third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error are\n\noverruled.\n\n              Judgment affirmed.\n\n      It is ordered that appellee recover from appellant costs herein taxed.\n\n      The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n      It is ordered that a special mandate issue of this court directing the common\n\npleas court to carry this judgment into execution. The defendant\u2019s conviction having\n\nbeen affirmed, any bail pending is terminated. Case remanded to the trial court for\n\nexecution of sentence.\n\f      A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27\n\nof the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n\n\nEILEEN T. GALLAGHER, PRESIDING JUDGE\n\nKATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, J., CONCURS;\nEILEEN A. GALLAGHER, J., DISSENTS WITH SEPARATE OPINION\n\n\nEILEEN A. GALLAGHER, J., DISSENTING:\n\n              I respectfully dissent. I find merit to Leannais\u2019 first assignment of\n\nerror. I would vacate Leannais\u2019 conviction for reckless homicide and the findings of\n\nguilt on the merged offenses of involuntary manslaughter and reckless assault\n\nbecause I do not believe that the evidence presented at trial, even when construed\n\nin the light most favorable to the state, was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that Leannais acted recklessly.\n\n              Leannais was convicted of reckless homicide in violation of R.C.\n\n2903.041(A) and also found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in violation of R.C.\n\n2903.04(B) and reckless assault in violation of R.C. 2903.13(B). Each of these\n\noffenses required the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Leannais acted\n\nrecklessly. See R.C. 2903.041(A) (\u201cNo person shall recklessly cause the death of\n\nanother or the unlawful termination of another\u2019s pregnancy.\u201d); R.C. 2903.13(B)\n\f(\u201cNo person shall recklessly cause serious physical harm to another or to another\u2019s\n\nunborn.\u201d).3 Recklessness is defined in R.C. 2901.22(C) as follows:\n\n       A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the\n       consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable\n       risk that the person\u2019s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is\n       likely to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to\n       circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the consequences,\n       the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such\n       circumstances are likely to exist.4\nSee also 1974 Committee Comment to H.B.

Because the underlying offense for\nthe involuntary manslaughter count was the reckless assault charge, recklessness was also\nrequired to prove involuntary manslaughter.\n\n      4   R.C. 2901.22(C) was amended effective March 23, 2015. It previously stated:\n\n      A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the\n      consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that his conduct is likely\n      to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature. A person is\n      reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to\n      the consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that such\n      circumstances are likely to exist.\n\n\n       This court has indicated that the definition of recklessness in the current version\nof R.C. 2901.22(C) and the former version of R.C. 2901.22(C) are \u201csubstantively [the]\nsame.\u201d See State v.

Thus, to support guilty verdicts for reckless homicide, involuntary\n\nmanslaughter and reckless assault, the state needed to prove beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that Leannais, with heedless indifference to the consequences, disregarded a\n\n\u201cstrong possibility\u201d that his conduct would \u201clikely\u201d cause, i.e., that there was good\n\nreason to expect his conduct would cause, death or serious physical harm.\n\n                 The video recording of the Facebook Live broadcast shows Leannais\n\ntaking the gun from Frenden, removing the magazine, racking it twice and pulling\n\nthe trigger to make sure the gun is not loaded before handing it back to Frenden.\n\nLeannais then appears to put the magazine in his pocket. One of the state\u2019s experts,\n\nKristen Koeth, testified that Leannais\u2019 actions would have cleared all live rounds in\n\nthe gun and would have \u201crendered the gun safe.\u201d Detective Cook agreed that the\n\nweapon was rendered safe at that point and \u201cwouldn\u2019t fire\u201d without having \u201canother\n\nbullet loaded into it.\u201d Leannais had a concealed carry permit and some familiarity\n\nwith guns. Other magazines for the gun were kept in Leannais\u2019 bedroom.\n\n\n\n\n      5   \u201cUnjustified risk\u201d is not defined in R.C. 2901.01.\n\f               When Leannais handled the gun approximately an hour later,\n\nshooting and killing Stanford, there was no magazine in the gun. Because Leannais\n\nhad properly unloaded the gun earlier that evening, the only way Leannais\u2019 conduct\n\ncould be \u201clikely to cause\u201d serious physical harm or death or that Leannais could be\n\nsaid to have \u201cdisregard[ed]\u201d a \u201cstrong possibility\u201d that his conduct was \u201clikely to\n\ncause\u201d serious physical harm or death is if Leannais knew that the gun had been\n\nreloaded or knew that there was a likelihood that the gun had been reloaded at the\n\ntime he handled the gun. Koeth testified that there are two ways to load a bullet into\n\nthe gun at issue: (1) a loaded magazine could be inserted into the bottom of the gun\n\nand the slide could be pulled back and then allowed to go forward or (2) a person\n\ncould unlock the slide, pull the slide back, drop a round into the chamber, and allow\n\nthe slide to go forward.\n\n               Officer Zak testified that when he entered Leannais\u2019 apartment after\n\nthe incident, he observed the gun with no magazine inside the grip, a magazine and\n\none loose live round on the kitchen counter. There was no direct evidence at trial\n\nestablishing who reloaded the gun, when the gun was reloaded or that Leannais\n\nknew that the gun had been reloaded when he was \u201cjoking around with it\u201d an hour\n\nlater. Although circumstantial evidence can have the same probative value as direct\n\nevidence, I do not believe there was sufficient circumstantial evidence here to allow\n\nthe jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Leannais knew that there was a\n\n\u201cstrong possibility\u201d or likelihood that the gun had been reloaded when Leannais\n\nhandled it an hour later.\n\f               In determining that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s\n\nfinding that Leannais acted recklessly, the majority points to evidence that Leannais\n\nand Frenden \u201cplayed with the gun after Leannais removed the magazine and\n\nrendered the gun safe\u201d and that they joked about \u201cusing the gun to play a prank on\n\nsomeone using blanks.\u201d They also point to (1) Detective Cook\u2019s testimony that,\n\nalthough Leannais and Frenden could not be seen on the Facebook Live video during\n\ntheir conversation about \u201cusing blanks,\u201d \u201cclicking sounds\u201d could be heard on the\n\nvideo during that conversation that sounded like the racking of the slide \u2014 i.e., \u201clike\n\nhe racked the action back, and it sounded like it stayed back because * * * at the end,\n\nit sounded like he allowed the slide to slam forward\u201d \u2014 and (2) Detective Cook\u2019s\n\nsupposition that this could have been when the gun was reloaded, i.e., that these\n\nsounds could have been \u201cconsistent with perhaps loading [the gun] * * * either from\n\nthe top or allowing the slide to go forwards.\u201d The majority concludes that this\n\nevidence combined with Leannais\u2019 statement to police after the incident in which\n\nLeannais acknowledges that he made a \u201cmistake\u201d in failing to \u201ccheck the chamber of\n\nthat gun\u201d before handling it, shows that Leannais was \u201caware of the possibility that\n\n[the gun] could have been reloaded\u201d and of \u201cthe risks involved in pulling the trigger\u201d\n\nand constituted sufficient \u201ccompetent, credible evidence that Leannais acted\n\nrecklessly\u201d when he caused Stanford\u2019s death. I disagree.\n\n               Proof of recklessness requires more than evidence of negligence.\n\nAlthough there is evidence that Frenden and Leannais continued to \u201cjok[e] around\u201d\n\nwith the gun after Leannais had unloaded it, based upon the record before us, I\n\fbelieve too much is unknown about what happened to the gun after Leannais\n\nunloaded it (and how and when it was reloaded) for a reasonable jury to do anything\n\nmore than speculate as to whether Leannais was aware that there was a \u201cstrong\n\npossibility\u201d that the gun had been reloaded and that, with heedless indifference to\n\nthe consequences, he disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his\n\nconduct would likely cause death or serious physical harm.\n\n               \u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt cannot be based on conjecture,\n\nspeculation or an assessment of the likelihood of various possibilities.\u201d State v.\n\nHicks, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102206, 2015-Ohio-4978, \u00b6 57; see also State v.\n\nBrown, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98540, 2013-Ohio-1982, \u00b6 31 (\u201cIt is well established\n\nthat \u2018[c]riminal convictions cannot rest upon mere speculation; the state must\n\nestablish the guilt of the accused by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d), quoting\n\nState v. Haynes, 25 Ohio St.2d 264, 270, 267 N.E.2d 787 (1971); State v. Miller, 11th\n\nDist. Lake No. 2002-L-162, 2004-Ohio-6342, \u00b6 50 (\u201cspeculative evidence does not\n\nsupport a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). \u201cProof beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt is not a mere probability or even a strong probability.\u201d Hicks at \u00b6 57. It\n\nrequires a fact finder to be \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d of the truth of a fact, i.e., \u201cproof of\n\nsuch a character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in\n\nthe most important of [his or her] own affairs.\u201d R.C. 2901.05(E); State v. Givens, 2d\n\nDist. Clark No. 2005-CA-42, 2005-Ohio-6670, \u00b6 11 (\u201cProof beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt is a very high degree of proof such that the jurors must be \u2018firmly convinced\u2019\n\fof the proof of the charge.\u201d). I do not believe such proof of recklessness was present\n\nhere.\n\n               There is no dispute in this case that Leannais violated the \u201cnumber\n\none rule\u201d of gun safety \u2014 i.e., to always assume that there is a bullet in the gun ready\n\nto be fired \u2014 and exercised extremely poor judgment in \u201cjoking around\u201d with the\n\ngun, with tragic consequences. However, I believe the evidence in this case supports\n\na finding of criminal negligence \u2014 not recklessness \u2014 beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSee R.C. 2901.22(D) (\u201cA person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse\n\nfrom due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person\u2019s conduct\n\nmay cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is negligent with\n\nrespect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse from due care, the\n\nperson fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may exist.\u201d).\n\n               I believe this case is distinguishable from State v. Gough, 5th Dist.\n\nLicking No. 08-CA-55, 2009-Ohio-322, upon which the majority relies, and a\n\nnumber of other cases in which courts have upheld convictions for reckless homicide\n\nbased on an unintentional discharge of a firearm. In Gough, the defendant knew\n\nthe gun owner \u201cusually\u201d kept his gun loaded and that the gun was actually loaded\n\nsometime that evening. Id. at \u00b6 3, 21, 23. At one point, a guest removed the bullets\n\nfrom the gun, placing the gun on the kitchen table and the bullets on an end table.\n\nHowever, later on that evening, the gun owner and another guest examined the gun\n\nin the living room. Id. at \u00b6 4-5. The defendant was in the living room, sitting next\n\nto the gun owner on a futon, while the gun owner and the guest looked at the gun.\n\fId. at \u00b6 5, 22. When the guest asked to see a bullet, the gun owner retrieved one and\n\ngave it to the guest. Id. After he finished observing it, the guest gave the bullet back\n\nto the gun owner. Id. at \u00b6 5, 22. The gun owner put the bullet back into the gun,\n\nthen placed the gun on the coffee table in front of the futon. Id. Minutes later, the\n\ndefendant picked up the gun, pointed the gun at the gun owner\u2019s head, cocked the\n\ngun and pulled the trigger, killing the gun owner. Id. at \u00b6 6, 8, 22. The defendant\n\nwas convicted of reckless homicide and appealed. Id. at \u00b6 10-11. On appeal, the Fifth\n\nDistrict affirmed his conviction, concluding that the evidence was sufficient to show\n\nthat the defendant \u201cknew the risks created by his conduct\u201d and that \u201c[h]is act of\n\nholding the gun to the head of [the gun owner] demonstrated a perverse disregard\n\nof a known risk that [the gun owner] would be shot and killed.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23. This is\n\nnot that case.\n\n                 This is not a case in which the defendant knew the gun was loaded,\n\nhad reason to believe the gun was loaded or had no reason to believe whether or not\n\nthe gun was loaded at the time the offense occurred. Compare, e.g., State v. Erby,\n\n2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27799, 2018-Ohio-3695, \u00b6 20-24 (evidence was sufficient\n\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of reckless homicide\n\nwhere defendant, who had limited familiarity with the weapon, waved what he knew\n\nto be a loaded gun within two feet of where the victim was lying on the bed, with his\n\nfinger on the trigger, while he was in a \u2018\u201chyped up\u2019 state\u201d); State v. English, 10th\n\nDist. Franklin No. 13AP-88, 2014-Ohio-89, \u00b6 6-9, 11-13, 15 (defendant who did not\n\nhave any experience with firearms perversely disregarded a known risk by \u201cmessing\n\fwith\u201d the hammer of a shotgun when he did know whether gun was loaded); see also\n\nState v. Swanson, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 10AP-502, 2011-Ohio-776, \u00b6 12-16\n\n(conviction for reckless homicide was not against the manifest weight of the\n\nevidence where defendant who was unfamiliar with guns, picked up a gun in anger,\n\npointed it in the direction of her husband\u2019s head, and pulled the trigger without\n\nknowing whether the gun was loaded). In this case, because he had unloaded the\n\ngun himself earlier that evening, Leannais had reason to believe the gun was\n\nunloaded at the time he pulled the trigger.\n\n               In my view, this is not a case of a defendant who was aware of a\n\nsubstantial and unjustified risk and, with heedless indifference, disregarded it; this\n\nis a case of a defendant who, due to a substantial lapse in judgment, failed to perceive\n\na significant risk \u2014 i.e., that a gun he had reason to believe was unloaded might\n\nactually be loaded \u2014 and take the appropriate steps to avoid that risk. In other\n\nwords, a case of criminal negligence not recklessness. See State v. Johnson, 8th Dist.\n\nCuyahoga No. 105841, 2018-Ohio-1519, \u00b6 11 (\u201cWhile the reckless person and the\n\nnegligent person both create a risk of harm, their conduct is nonetheless\n\ndistinguishable: \u201c\u2018[t]he reckless actor is aware of the risk and disregards it; the\n\nnegligent actor is not aware of the risk but should have been aware of it.\u2019\u201d\u201d), quoting\n\nState v. Peck, 172 Ohio App.3d 25, 2007-Ohio-2730, 872 N.E.2d 1263, \u00b6 13 (10th\n\nDist.), quoting Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, Section 27, 170 (15th Ed.1994).\n\n               Because I believe the state failed to present sufficient evidence to\n\nprove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Leannais acted recklessly, I would reverse\n\fhis conviction for reckless homicide and the guilty verdicts on the involuntary\n\nmanslaughter and reckless assault counts.\n\f",
