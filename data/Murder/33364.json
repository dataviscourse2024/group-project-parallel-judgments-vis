Moreover, upon our independent review pursuant to CPL 470.15 (5), we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see People v Romero, 7 NY3d 633 [2006]).\nThe sentence imposed was not excessive (see People v Suitte, 90 AD2d 80 [1982]). Angiolillo, J.E, Austin, Sgroi and Miller, JJ., concur.\n",
