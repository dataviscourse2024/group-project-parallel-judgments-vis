I O N\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn\r\nApril 2000, Tomas Urias was arrested and charged with\r\npossession of marijuana.\u00a0 While detained\r\non these charges, he was questioned by an officer of the Ector County Sheriff=s office.\u00a0 During one of the investigative interviews,\r\nAppellant was asked about a homicide in which he had been a primary suspect\r\nsince 1996 and he ultimately confessed to the crime.\u00a0 He was charged with the murder of Adrian Arenivas and pled not guilty. \u00a0His motion to suppress the confession was\r\ndenied by the trial court.\u00a0 A jury found\r\nhim guilty and assessed a punishment of 48 years, to be served in the\r\nInstitutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\u00a0 On appeal, Appellant\u00a0 contends his confession was\r\ninvoluntary.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\nfollowing facts are essentially uncontroverted.\u00a0 Appellant worked for Raul Gardea,\r\na known drug dealer.[1]\u00a0 He lost a load or two and ended up owing Gardea some $60,000.\u00a0\r\nAfraid for his own life and that of his family, Appellant shot Adrian Arevinas and stole his Jeep.\u00a0 He gave Gardea the\r\nJeep in partial payment of the money owed.\u00a0\r\nThe victim=s body\r\nwas found in Ector County, Texas in September 1996; his Jeep was found near Ojinaga, Mexico.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nAppellant\r\nand Billy Campbell were linked to the homicide and stolen vehicle.\u00a0 Campbell was located shortly thereafter.\u00a0 However, Appellant\u00a0 could not be found at the time and it\r\nwas determined that he had fled to Mexico.\u00a0\r\nHis whereabouts were unknown until he was arrested on marijuana charges\r\nand placed in the Ector County Detention Center in late April 2000.\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\nwas indicted for possession of marijuana (more than five pounds, but less than\r\nfifty pounds).\u00a0 Jason Leach was appointed\r\nas his counsel.\u00a0 Appellant told the\r\nnarcotics officers that he wanted to talk about some unrelated matters that\r\ncould possibly be beneficial to the amount of time he served.\u00a0 Leach and Appellant both called the Texas\r\nDepartment of Public Safety, Narcotic Services, and spoke with Sergeant\r\nInvestigator Mario Tinajero about setting up an\r\ninterview for that purpose.[2]\u00a0 Leach told Tinajero\r\nthat he wanted to be present during any questioning of his client.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile\r\nat the jail on May 10, 2000, Sergeant Tinajero ran into\r\nCarl Rogers, a homicide investigator with the Ector County Sheriff=s Department, and told him he planned\r\nto talk with Appellant regarding the drug investigation.\u00a0\u00a0 Rogers recognized the name and indicated he\r\nwished to question Appellant about a homicide investigation.\u00a0 The next day, Tinajero\r\nand Rogers visited Appellant at the jail.\u00a0\r\nLeach was not notified and did not attend.\u00a0 Rogers was told at some point that Appellant\r\nwas represented by Leach, but he made no effort to contact him.\u00a0 Tinajero testified\r\nthat he called Leach afterward and apologized for forgetting to notify him of\r\nthe meeting.[3]\r\n\r\nTinajero and Rogers brought a tape recorder to the\r\ninterview.\u00a0 Appellant gave Tinajero information about a counterfeit money operation in\r\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico and other drug related information.\u00a0 He hoped that the information he provided on\r\nthe drugs, guns, or counterfeit money operations would help him receive a more\r\nfavorable plea offer.\u00a0 Tinajero questioned him for about thirty minutes but did\r\nnot record the conversation.\u00a0 Rogers then\r\nconducted the remainder of the interview.\u00a0\r\nHe told Appellant that he was investigating a homicide that had occurred\r\naround August 1996.\u00a0 Rogers showed him a\r\npicture of the victim and proceeded to question Appellant for about twenty-five\r\nminutes.\u00a0 Rogers then started recording\r\nthe interview, stated the names of the persons present, and read Appellant his\r\nMiranda[4]\r\nwarnings.\u00a0 Appellant stated that he

Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 226, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed. 2d 854 (1973).\u00a0 The\r\ndue process test considers Athe\r\ntotality of all the surrounding circumstances--both the characteristics of the\r\naccused and the details of the interrogation.@\u00a0 Id.\r\n\r\nWith\r\nthe advent of Miranda, however, the focus shifted to the Fifth Amendment\r\nand its application to custodial interrogation.\u00a0\r\nA[C]oercion inherent in custodial interrogation blurs the line\r\nbetween voluntary and involuntary statements, and thus heightens the risk that\r\nan individual will not be &gt;accorded\r\nhis privilege under the Fifth Amendment . . . not to be compelled to\r\nincriminate himself.=@ Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 435, 120\r\nS.Ct. at 2331, citing Miranda, 384 U.S. at\r\n439, 86 S.Ct. at 1602.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo\r\nyears after Miranda was decided, Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. ' 3501, which in effect, designated voluntariness as the touchstone of admissibility, omitted a\r\nwarning requirement, and instructed the trial courts to consider a nonexclusive\r\nlist of factors relevant to the circumstances of a confession.\u00a0 Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 436, 120 S.Ct. at 2332.\u00a0\r\nConcluding that the legislative intent was to overrule Miranda,\r\nthe Dickerson court considered whether the Miranda decision\r\nannounced a constitutional rule or simply regulated evidence in the absence of\r\ncongressional direction. Dickerson, 530 U.S. at 436-37, 120 S.Ct. 2332-33.\u00a0 The\r\ncourt itself acknowledged its prior decisions in which it referred to the Miranda\r\nwarnings as prophylactic and not themselves rights\r\nprotected by the Constitution.\u00a0 Dickerson,\r\n530 U.S. at 437-38, 120 S.Ct. at 2333.\u00a0 Two of these decisions were of significance\r\nto an opinion by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.\u00a0 See Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U.S. 433,\r\n94 S.Ct. 2357, 41 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1974); Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct.\r\n1285, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1985).\u00a0 Both of\r\nthese cases involved the failure to give the Miranda warnings rather\r\nthan the failure to scrupulously honor the warnings given.\u00a0 Nevertheless, in Baker v. State, 956\r\nS.W.2d 19 (Tex.Crim.App. 1997), the court determined\r\nthat A[t]he\r\nfailure to scrupulously honor a suspect=s\r\ninvocation of his right to remain silent by continuing questioning is not\r\nnecessarily coercive.@\u00a0 Id. at 23.\u00a0 This holding was premised on the concept that\r\nstatements taken in violation of Miranda are not obtained in violation\r\nof law.\u00a0 Baker, 956\r\nS.W.2d at 24.\u00a0 The United States\r\nSupreme Court retreated from that tenet in Dickerson and abandoned the\r\ntotality of the circumstances test.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of\r\nthe Miranda rule is that statements which may be by no means\r\ninvoluntary, made by a defendant who is aware of his &gt;rights,= may nonetheless be excluded and a\r\nguilty defendant go free as a result.\u00a0\r\nBut experience suggests that the totality-of-the-circumstances test\r\nwhich ' 3501\r\nseeks to revive is more difficult than Miranda for law enforcement\r\nofficers to conform to, and for courts to apply in a consistent manner.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn sum, we conclude\r\nthat Miranda announced a constitutional rule that Congress may not\r\nsupersede legislatively.\u00a0 Following the\r\nrule of stare decisis, we decline to overrule Miranda\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n530 U.S. at 444, 120 S.Ct. at 2336.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\nCourt of Criminal Appeals has now embraced Dickerson.\u00a0 In McCarthy v. State, 65 S.W.3d 47 (Tex.Crim.App. 2001), the court returned to the Abright and firm constitutional rule@ that applies to all suspects and law\r\nenforcement officers.\u00a0 Id.\r\nat 52, citing Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L. Ed. 2d 378 (1981).\u00a0 While McCarthy involved the Fifth\r\nAmendment right to counsel, we believe it should apply equally to the Fifth\r\nAmendment right against self-incrimination.\u00a0\r\nOur sister courts have agreed.\u00a0 See Hill v. State, 78 S.W.3d 374 (Tex.App.--Tyler\r\n2001, pet. denied); Mayes v. State, 8 S.W.3d 354 (Tex.App.--Amarillo\r\n1999, no pet.).\r\n\r\nIn\r\nHill, a juvenile was certified to stand trial as an adult for the\r\noffense of capital murder.\u00a0 The\r\nmagistrate who administered the Miranda warnings decided to inquire\r\nwhether Hill understood\u00a0\r\nthe definition of Awaive.@\u00a0\r\nThe opinion details the exchange:\r\n\r\nAccording to his\r\ntestimony at the suppression hearing, the magistrate decided to inquire whether\r\nAppellant understood what the term &gt;waive= meant.\u00a0\r\nAppellant answered, &gt;No,\r\nsir= and the magistrate proceeded with an\r\nexplanation of the term &gt;waive.=\u00a0\r\nDuring this explanation, Appellant, while shaking his head in the\r\nnegative, said &gt;No,= again indicating a desire not to waive\r\nhis rights.\u00a0 When he was finished, the\r\nmagistrate asked Appellant if he now understood what the term &gt;waive=\r\nmeant and Appellant answered, &gt;Yes, sir.=\u00a0 The magistrate then asked Appellant if he\r\nwished to &gt;waive\r\nor give up= his\r\nright to remain silent.\u00a0 Appellant again\r\nanswered, &gt;No,\r\nsir.=\u00a0 The magistrate then asked affirmatively if\r\nAppellant wished to remain silent and was told, &gt;Yes, sir.=\u00a0 This response was followed by Appellant being\r\nasked if he wished to &gt;waive\r\nor give up= his\r\nright to have an attorney present to advise him.\u00a0 Again, Appellant responded, &gt;No, sir.=\u00a0 By this time, Appellant had unequivocally\r\ninvoked his rights six times.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe magistrate then\r\nstated, &gt;Very\r\nwell.\u00a0 That concludes the statutory\r\nwarnings.=\u00a0 At this point, the interview should have\r\nended. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHill, 78 S.W.3d at 385-86.\u00a0\r\nThe court noted that the magistrate then asked the proverbial one\r\nquestion too many, inquiring whether the juvenile wanted to give a\r\nstatement.\u00a0 Finding this to be an\r\nimproper inquiry,\u00a0 the\r\ncourt concluded:\r\n\r\nAfter the magistrate\r\nhad stated that the warnings were concluded, he continued to interview\r\nAppellant regarding the giving of a statement.\u00a0\r\nIn this regard, the magistrate=s\r\naction constituted a re-institution of the interview with Appellant.\u00a0 Appellant did not initiate the contact to reopen\r\nthe discussion, the magistrate did.\u00a0 The\r\ninterview should have stopped at the first indication by Appellant that he\r\nwished to invoke his rights.\u00a0\r\nAccordingly, his right to remain silent was not scrupulously honored,\r\nrendering his subsequent confession inadmissible.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nId. at\r\n387.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly,\r\nin Mayes, as one officer was admonishing the defendant of her rights,\r\nshe interrupted and said, AI=m going to stop talking.@\u00a0\r\nMayes, 8 S.W.3d at 356.\u00a0 Despite this pronouncement, the officer\r\ncontinued with his comments and questions.\u00a0\r\nAbout four minutes later, Mayes again declared, AI=m going to shut up.\u00a0 I=m\r\nnot going to say another goddamned thing.@\u00a0 The detectives neither paused nor ended the\r\nproceeding.\u00a0 Rather, they continued as if\r\nuninterrupted, and finally persuaded Mayes to tell the story which they had\r\nbeen waiting to hear.\u00a0 Id.\r\n\r\nHere,\r\nthe officers stopped the recording once Appellant declared that he wanted to\r\nstop, but they admittedly did not terminate the interview.\u00a0 While the officers parsed words as to whether\r\nAppellant was Ainterrogated@ at that point, the form the statements\r\ntook is irrelevant.\u00a0 Mayes, 8\r\nS.W.3d at 360 (holding that regardless of whether the officers uttered\r\ndeclaratory rather than interrogatory statements, the officers were pressing\r\nthe defendant for information about the crime and their actions constituted\r\ninterrogation).\u00a0 We conclude that the\r\ntrial court erred in admitting Appellant=s\r\nstatement.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nHARM ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving\r\nfound error, we must necessarily proceed to a harm analysis.\u00a0 Where, as here, the appellate record in a\r\ncriminal case reveals constitutional error, we must reverse a judgment of\r\nconviction unless we determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not\r\ncontribute to the conviction.\u00a0 Tex.R.App.P. 44.2(a); McCarthy, 65 S.W.3d at 52.\u00a0 This\r\ndecision is not determined solely on the basis of whether there was sufficient\r\nevidence, independent of the defendant=s\r\ninadmissible statement, for a reasonable jury to reach the same\r\nconclusion.\u00a0 Id. at\r\n55, citing Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U.S. 249,\r\n108 S.Ct. 1792, 100 L. Ed. 2d 284 (1988).\u00a0 Instead, we must review whether the admission\r\nof the statement contributed to the verdict of guilt, regardless of whether\r\nthere is independent evidence which is otherwise sufficient to sustain the\r\nverdict.\u00a0 Id.\r\n\r\nNor\r\nare we to focus on the propriety of the outcome of the trial.\u00a0 Westbrook v. State,\r\n29 S.W.3d 103, 119 (Tex.Crim.App. 2000).\u00a0 We should calculate, as nearly as possible,\r\nthe probable impact of the error on the jury in light of the other\r\nevidence.\u00a0 Id.\r\nat 119.\u00a0 A defendant=s statement, especially a statement\r\nimplicating him in the commission of the charged offense, is unlike any other\r\nevidence that can be admitted against the defendant.\u00a0 Arizona v. Fulminante,\r\n499 U.S. 279, 296, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113\r\nL. Ed. 2d 302 (1991):\r\n\r\n[A] defendant=s\r\nown confession is probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be\r\nadmitted against him. . . .\u00a0 [T]he\r\nadmissions of a defendant come from the actor himself, the most knowledgeable and\r\nunimpeachable source of information about his past conduct.\u00a0 Certainly, confessions have profound impact\r\non the jury, so much so that we may justifiably doubt its ability to put them\r\nout of mind even if told to do so. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSee id. at 296, 111 S.Ct. at 1257.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile\r\nwe recognize that at the time Appellant was interrogated, the Dickerson\r\nand McCarthy opinions had not issued, we must nevertheless conclude that\r\nthe source and nature of the error here was a blatant violation of Appellant=s Fourth Amendment rights by law\r\nenforcement officers.\u00a0 Declaring the\r\nerror harmless would not encourage law enforcement to follow the bright line\r\nconstitutional mandates in the future.\u00a0\r\nFurthermore, the State certainly emphasized and relied upon the\r\nconfession throughout the trial.\u00a0 Indeed,\r\nit offered no other evidence linking Appellant to the crime.\u00a0 Consequently,\u00a0 it is highly probable that the jury\r\nrelied on the confession when reaching the verdict.\u00a0 AIf\r\nthe jury believes that a defendant has admitted the crime, it doubtless will be\r\ntempted to rest its decision on that evidence alone, without careful\r\nconsideration of the other evidence in the case.\u00a0 Apart, perhaps, from a videotape of the crime,\r\none would have difficulty finding evidence more damaging to a criminal\r\ndefendant=s plea of\r\ninnocence.@\u00a0 Fulminante,\r\n499 U.S. at 313, 111 S.Ct. at 1266 (Kennedy, J.,\r\nconcurring).\u00a0 Regardless of whether there\r\nwas, apart from Appellant=s\r\nstatement, sufficient evidence to support the conviction, we find it impossible\r\nto say there is no reasonable likelihood that the State=s\r\nuse of Appellant=s\r\nstatement materially affected the jury=s\r\ndeliberations. \u00a0\u00a0See McCarthy, 65 S.W.3d at 56; Westbrook, 29 S.W.3d at 119.\u00a0 Accordingly, we sustain Appellant=s sole point of error.\u00a0 We reverse the judgment of the trial court\r\nand remand this cause to that court for a new trial.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nJanuary 16, 2003\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ANN\r\nCRAWFORD McCLURE, Justice\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBefore Panel No. 5\r\n\r\nMcClure, Chew, JJ.,\r\nand Preslar, C.J.
