D-1-DC-07-904026, HONORABLE BRENDA KENNEDY, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                            MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n               A jury found appellant Michael Anthony Castello guilty of murder. See Tex. Penal\n\nCode Ann. \u00a7 19.02 (West 2003). The jury assessed punishment at sixty years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\n               Appellant\u2019s court-appointed attorney filed a brief concluding that the appeal is\n\nfrivolous and without merit. The brief meets the requirements of Anders v. California, 386 U.S.\n\n738 (1967), by presenting a professional evaluation of the record demonstrating why there are no\n\narguable grounds to be advanced. See also Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75 (1988); High v. State,\n\n573 S.W.2d 807 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978); Currie v. State, 516 S.W.2d 684 (Tex. Crim. App. 1974);\n\nJackson v. State, 485 S.W.2d 553 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972); Gainous v. State, 436 S.W.2d 137\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1969). Appellant received a copy of counsel\u2019s brief and was advised of his right\n\nto examine the appellate record and to file a pro se brief. No pro se brief has been filed.\n\f              We have reviewed the record and counsel\u2019s brief and agree that the appeal is frivolous\n\nand without merit. We find nothing in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\n\n              The judgment of conviction is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             __________________________________________\n\n                                             G. Alan Waldrop, Justice\n\nBefore Chief Justice Law, Justices Pemberton and Waldrop\n\nAffirmed\n\nFiled: February 21, 2008\n\nDo Not Publish\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f",
