After according the issues full consideration, the Court is satisfied that appropriate\ndisposition of the appeal does not warrant a published opinion. See Fed. R. App. P. 36; D.C. Cir.\nR. 36(d). For the reasons stated below, it is hereby\n\n        ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the grant of the motion for summary judgment and\ndenial of the cross-motion for summary judgment be AFFIRMED.\n\n       In this Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case, the Assassination Archives and Research\nCenter (the Center) appeals an order of the district court granting the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s\n(CIA) motion for summary judgment and denying the Center\u2019s cross-motion for summary\njudgment. At issue is whether, in response to FOIA requests by the Center, the CIA permissibly\nwithheld pursuant to FOIA Exemption 5, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5), portions of intra-agency\n\n*\n  The late Senior Circuit Judge Williams was a member of the panel and participated in the disposition of\nthe matter on October 11, 2019, before his death on August 7, 2020. Judges Pillard and Rao have acted as\na quorum with respect to the amended judgment. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(d).\n\n                                                   1\n\fcommunications relating to the FOIA process itself.\n\n        On August 25, 2012, the Center submitted to the CIA a request for all records \u201cpertaining\nto the CIA\u2019s study in 1963 of plots to assassinate Adolph Hitler\u201d or \u201cto communications by Allen\nDulles regarding plots to assassinate Adolph Hitler\u201d during Dulles\u2019s service in the CIA and a\nrelated office. After the CIA returned a determination that it had no responsive records, the Center\nsubmitted a supplementary request. In addition to somewhat expanding the scope of the previous\nrequest, the Center\u2019s second letter requested \u201c[a]ll index entries or other records reflecting the\nsearch for records responsive to this request in its original or amended form, including all search\n[terms] used with each of the components searched.\u201d\n\n        As set forth in declarations from CIA Information Review Officer Antoinette Shiner, who\nwas involved in responding to the Center\u2019s amended FOIA request, CIA staff searched for\nresponsive records in the files of eight different CIA sub-offices that the agency identified as \u201cthe\nlocations reasonably expected to contain\u201d the requested materials. Shiner Decl. (Jan. 19, 2018) at\n2. Those offices were: \u201cthe Directorate of Analysis . . . ; Directorate of Operations . . . , including\nits operational files; the Office of the Director, the Director\u2019s Action Center, the Office of the\nGeneral Counsel, the Office of Congressional Affairs, the Center for the Study of Intelligence\n(which is part of the CIA\u2019s Talent Center) and the CIA\u2019s history staff office.\u201d Id. at 2-3. Within\neach office, CIA staff searched \u201call relevant office databases, Agency share drives, and archival\nrecords.\u201d Id. at 3. In carrying out each search, CIA staff used a wide variety of terms, including\nbut not limited to \u201cHitler Assassination,\u201d \u201cHitler Plot,\u201d \u201c1963 assassination study,\u201d and \u201cDulles\ncommunication Hitler.\u201d Id. at 4-5; Shiner Decl. (Oct. 13, 2017) at 3. Each of those terms was\nsearched both as a complete phrase and as separate terms. For example, a search for \u201cHitler\nAssassination\u201d would have returned all documents containing that exact phrase as well as all\ndocuments containing both \u201cHitler\u201d and \u201cassassination\u201d somewhere in its body. Shiner Decl. (Jan.\n19, 2018) at 5. Staff then reviewed each document uncovered by the searches and determined\nwhether it was responsive to the Center\u2019s particular request. Id.\n\n         In addition to directing those searches, Shiner also consulted with the CIA\u2019s Chief\nHistorian, who is \u201cvery knowledgeable about the Agency\u2019s holdings with respect to\u201d the subject\nmatter at issue here. Id. at 3. The Chief Historian \u201cpersonally conducted searches of history staff\nfiles for any reference to studies of anti-Hitler plots dating from the 1963 time frame,\u201d but did not\nuncover any additional responsive documents. Id. at 3-4. The Chief Historian advised that, \u201cdue\nto the age of the subject matter and narrow scope of [the] request focusing on anti-Hitler plots,\nthere would not be many responsive documents and anything related to assassination studies would\nlikely be found at the National Archives.\u201d Id. at 4. Based on our review of the redacted records,\nthe declarations, and the CIA\u2019s Vaughn index, we granted summary affirmance to the CIA as to\nthe adequacy of the CIA\u2019s search and the propriety of its application of FOIA Exemptions 1, 3,\nand 6, some of which were not contested. Assassination Archives & Research Ctr. v. CIA, No.\n18-5280, 2019 WL 691517 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2019).\n\n       The only remaining issue is the permissibility of the Exemption 5 redactions to five records\nthe CIA produced, which appear to be CIA internal forms used in processing the Center\u2019s FOIA\n\n                                                  2\n\frequests and produced pursuant to the Center\u2019s request for records of the FOIA search process\nitself. The Center challenges the CIA\u2019s use of the deliberative privilege on the grounds that the\ninformation at issue is purely factual, reporting what the CIA found in its searches. Oral Arg. Rec.\nat 10:39-11:01; Appellant Br. 21-23. The CIA, in turn, argues that the withheld materials would\nreveal the decision-making process behind its final response to the Center\u2019s FOIA request.\nAppellee Br. 7-17.\n\n        We now hold that the CIA has permissibly invoked Exemption 5. Under FOIA Exemption\n5, agencies need not turn over \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would\nnot be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency,\u201d 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 552(b)(5)\u2014e.g., records protected by the Executive\u2019s deliberative process privilege. See EPA v.\nMink, 410 U.S. 73, 85-90 (1973). The privilege covers information that is both \u201cpredecisional\u201d\nand \u201cdeliberative.\u201d Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Dep\u2019t of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 866 (D.C. Cir.\n1980). Documents are predecisional if they were \u201cgenerated before the adoption of an agency\npolicy,\u201d and deliberative if they \u201creflect[] the give-and-take of the consultative process.\u201d Id.\n\n        Here, the CIA invokes Exemption 5 to shield portions of the five internal FOIA task forms\nmentioned above. Specifically, the CIA has redacted from each form the substance of the intra-\nagency communication \u201c[a]uthored by [the] Agency component employee tasked with the search\u201d\nfor the benefit of the agency official directing the CIA\u2019s internal records search. J.A. 217-219,\n296-305.\n\n        The withheld communications indisputably precede the CIA\u2019s decision to release records\nto the Center. In addition, the redacted content \u201creflects the give-and-take\u201d of a \u201cconsultative\nprocess\u201d through which the agency sought to identify records within its possession potentially\nresponsive to the Center\u2019s requests. Id. 189-90, 354, 357. We have previously held the privilege\napplicable to \u201cfactual material . . . assembled through an exercise of judgment in extracting\npertinent material from a vast number of documents for the benefit of an official called upon to\ntake discretionary action,\u201d Mapother v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 3 F.3d 1533, 1539 (D.C. Cir. 1993), and\nwe have described a \u201crecommendation to a supervisor on a matter pending before the supervisor\u201d\nas \u201ca classic example of a deliberative document,\u201d Abtew v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., 808\nF.3d 895, 899 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Taken together, the entries in the agency\u2019s Vaughn index, the\ndeclarations, the forms themselves, and the context in which they are used make it sufficiently\napparent that the redacted text describes the efforts of staff \u201cin extracting pertinent material\u201d and\nany issues they encountered along the way. In context, it is evident that the redacted matter\namounted to predecisional communications from staff made for the purpose of informing the\nagency\u2019s ultimate decision as to what the law required of the Agency in response to the Center\u2019s\nFOIA request. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a).\n\n        It suffices that the redactions on the FOIA forms reflect some predecisional agency give-\nand-take; the Center does not challenge the CIA\u2019s segregation efforts. See Appellant Br.; Appellee\nMot. Summ. Affirmance 4 n.3. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment\nto the CIA and denial of summary judgment to the Center on the issue of the CIA\u2019s withholdings\nunder Exemption 5.\n\n                                                 3\n\f        Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published.
