Reyes was convicted, after pleading guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, to a five-count superseding indictment charging him with conspiracy to commit murder for hire, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958, the substantive offense of murder for hire, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1958 and 2, conspiracy to distribute heroin and cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, using and carrying firearms during and in relation to drug trafficking crimes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 2, and perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621. The Guidelines recommend a sentence of life imprisonment for these counts of conviction; however, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 based on Reyes\u2019s substantial assistance. The district court sentenced Reyes principally to an aggregate term of 144 months\u2019 imprisonment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.\nReyes argues that the district court failed to provide a written statement of reasons for imposing a non-Guidelines sentence and therefore ran afoul of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). Not so. The judgment indicated that the below-Guidelines sentence was imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, \u201cbased on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance.\u201d That statement \u2014 itself adequate under \u00a7 3553(c)(2) \u2014 supplemented the extensive explanation for the 144-month sentence given by the district court at Reyes\u2019s sentencing hearing.\nReyes also argues that the 144-month sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of his considerable cooperation with the government. This is nothing more than a challenge to the extent of the district court\u2019s downward departure under \u00a7 5K1.1, which we lack jurisdiction to review. See United States v. Hargrett, 156 F.3d 447, 450 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201cSection 3742(a) does not generally confer jurisdiction on courts of appeals to review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure or the extent of any downward departure that is granted.\u201d).\nFor the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.\n",
