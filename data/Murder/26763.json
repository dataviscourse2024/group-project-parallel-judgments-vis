After careful review, we\n\naffirm.\n\n        We glean the following factual and procedural history from this Court\u2019s\n\nJune 26, 2018 unpublished memorandum and the certified record. On May 7,\n\n2015, the Appellant entered an open guilty plea to one count of Criminal\n\nAttempt-Criminal       Homicide.     The       trial       court   ordered    a   Pre-Sentence\n\nInvestigation (\u201cPSI\u201d). Appellant submitted a pre-sentence memorandum,\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1   18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 901(a).\n____________________________________\n* Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-S38027-19\n\n\n\nwhich included letters from family members, friends, and co-workers attesting\n\nto Appellant\u2019s good character.\n\n       On August 20, 2015, the court held a sentencing hearing, at which\n\nAppellant exercised his right to allocution. In addition, the Victim testified on\n\nAppellant\u2019s behalf, and Appellant\u2019s counsel argued for a mitigated range\n\nsentence. The sentencing court denied Appellant\u2019s request to have one family\n\nmember speak on behalf of his extensive family, but the court indicated it had\n\nconsidered letters submitted from Appellant\u2019s family members.2 Appellant\u2019s\n\ncounsel did not object.\n\n       After reviewing Appellant\u2019s sentencing report, PSI, numerous letters\n\nfrom family members, friends, and co-workers, and testimony, the sentencing\n\ncourt declined to impose a mitigated range sentence, and sentenced Appellant\n\nto a standard range sentence of 96 to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\n       Appellant filed a Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence, which the trial\n\ncourt denied. Appellant did not file a direct appeal.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2The court explained that based on past negative experiences, it had a policy\nof precluding family members from speaking on behalf of defendants at\nsentencing hearings. N.T. Sentencing, 8/20/15, at 12.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S38027-19\n\n\n\n        Upon the reinstatement of his appellate rights nunc pro tunc after a\n\nPCRA3 proceeding,4 this timely appeal followed. Both Appellant and the PCRA\n\ncourt complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.\n\n        Appellant raises the following two issues on appeal:\n\n        1. Did the trial [c]ourt commit reversible error where its policy of\n           refusing to hear from defense witnesses [wa]s in clear violation\n           of the Sentencing Code?\n\n        2. Did the trial [c]ourt arrive at a manifestly unreasonable\n           sentence for [Appellant] considering the discretionary aspects\n           of sentencing?\n\nAppellant\u2019s Br. at 7.\n\n        In his first issue, Appellant asserts that his sentence was unreasonable\n\nbecause the sentencing court\u2019s policy of prohibiting defendants\u2019 family\n\nmembers from testifying at the sentencing hearing denied him the opportunity\n\nto present mitigating evidence relevant to sentencing in violation of his right\n\nto allocution. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8, 13, 19, 23-26 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9752 and\n\nPa.R.Crim.P. 704(C)(1)). In his second issue, Appellant asserts that he should\n\nhave been sentenced in the mitigated range based on his level of cooperation,\n\nthe Victim\u2019s testimony at sentencing, his remorse, and his rehabilitation. Id.\n\nat 28-29. Both of Appellant\u2019s issues challenge the discretionary aspects of\n\nsentencing.\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3   Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546.\n\n4 Commonwealth v. Brundage, No. 3549 EDA 2017, unpublished\nmemorandum at 11 (Pa. Super. filed June 26, 2018).\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S38027-19\n\n\n\n      Challenges   to   the   discretionary   aspects of sentencing      are   not\n\nautomatically reviewable as a matter of right. Commonwealth v. Hunter,\n\n768 A.2d 1136, 1144 (Pa. Super. 2001). Prior to reaching the merits of a\n\ndiscretionary sentencing issue, we must determine: (1) whether appellant has\n\nfiled a timely notice of appeal; (2) whether the issue was properly preserved\n\nat sentencing or in a motion to reconsider and modify sentence; (3) whether\n\nappellant\u2019s brief sufficiently addresses the challenge in a statement included\n\npursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f); and (4) whether there is a substantial question\n\nthat the sentence appealed from is not appropriate under the Sentencing\n\nCode. Commonwealth v. Evans, 901 A.2d 528, 533 (Pa. Super. 2006).\n\n      With respect to the second factor, a defendant must object and request\n\na remedy at sentencing, or raise the challenge in a post-sentence motion.\n\nCommonwealth v. McAfee, 849 A.2d 270, 275 (Pa. Super. 2004). The\n\nPennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure specifically caution defendants that,\n\nwhen filing Post-Sentence Motions, \u201c[a]ll requests for relief from the trial court\n\nshall be stated with specificity and particularity[.]\u201d Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(B)(1)(a).\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Tejada, 107 A.3d 788, 798-99 (Pa. Super. 2015)\n\n(noting that the trial court must be given the opportunity to reconsider its\n\nsentence either at sentencing or in a post-sentence motion). See, e.g.,\n\nCommonwealth v. Mann, 820 A.2d 788, 793-94 (Pa. Super. 2003) (holding\n\nthat defendant waived discretionary aspects of sentencing claim regarding\n\nsentencing court\u2019s failure to state the reasons for his sentence on the record\n\nwhere defendant filed a post-sentence motion, but only argued that his\n\n                                      -4-\n\fJ-S38027-19\n\n\n\nsentence was unduly severe and the trial court abused its discretion under the\n\nsentencing code).\n\n       Appellant did not preserve this first issue at sentencing. During the\n\nhearing, Appellant\u2019s counsel inquired about whether one of his family\n\nmembers could speak on behalf of Appellant\u2019s extended family, stating, \u201cI just\n\ndidn\u2019t know if the [c]ourt would entertain that at this time.\u201d N.T. Sentencing\n\nat 5. The court answered, \u201cNo. No[,]\u201d to which Appellant\u2019s counsel responded,\n\n\u201cFair enough, Your Honor.\u201d Id. After the court explained the reasons for its\n\npolicy of not allowing family members to testify on a defendant\u2019s behalf,\n\nAppellant did not object. Id. at 12-15.\n\n       Appellant also did not preserve the issue in a post-sentence motion. In\n\nhis Post-Sentence Motion, he argued only that a low-end standard range\n\nsentence or a mitigated range sentence was warranted in this matter based\n\non his acceptance of responsibility, remorse, rehabilitative efforts, past record,\n\nage, family ties, work history, and community reputation. Motion for\n\nReconsideration of Sentence, filed 8/25/15. He did not challenge the court\u2019s\n\nrefusal to allow a family representative to testify at sentencing or the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s policy of prohibiting Appellant\u2019s family members from testifying at the\n\nsentencing hearing. Because Appellant failed to preserve the issue at\n\nsentencing or a post-sentence motion, his first issue is waived.5\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n5 Appellant also asserts that his right to allocution was denied because his\nfamily representative was not allowed to testify. This is not a legally\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fJ-S38027-19\n\n\n\n       However, Appellant properly preserved his second issue\u2014that the\n\nsentencing court should have sentenced him in the mitigated range rather\n\nthan the standard range\u2014by preserving the issue in a Post-Sentence Motion\n\nand including a statement pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f) in his brief. See\n\nAppellant\u2019s Br. at 14-15. Thus, we proceed to address whether this sentencing\n\nchallenge raises a substantial question for our review.\n\n       Whether a substantial question has been raised regarding discretionary\n\nsentencing is determined on a case-by-case basis. Commonwealth v.\n\nMoury, 992 A.2d 162, 170 (Pa. Super. 2010). \u201cA substantial question exists\n\nonly when the appellant advances a colorable argument that the sentencing\n\njudge\u2019s actions were either: (1) inconsistent with a specific provision of the\n\nSentencing Code; or (2) contrary to the fundamental norms which underlie\n\nthe sentencing process.\u201d Id. (citation and quotation omitted).\n\n       Here, the trial court imposed a standard range sentence, but Appellant\n\navers that the trial court should have imposed a mitigated-range sentence\n\nbased on his cooperation, the Victim\u2019s testimony, his remorse, and his\n\nsubsequent rehabilitation. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 28-29.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\nsustainable assertion. A defendant\u2019s right to allocution is personal to the\ndefendant. See Commonwealth v. Thomas, 553 A.2d 918, 919 (Pa. 1989)\n(discussing the history of the right of a defendant \u201cto personally address the\ncourt prior to sentencing\u201d). See also Commonwealth v. Hague, 840 A.2d\n1018, 1019 (Pa. Super. 2003) (holding that the right to allocution requires the\ncourt to inform a defendant that he has the right, and afford a defendant the\nright, to address the court prior to sentencing). The right to allocution does\nnot include a right to have family members speak on a defendant\u2019s behalf.\nHere, Appellant did exercise his right to allocution. N.T. Sentencing at 10-11.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fJ-S38027-19\n\n\n\n       Claims that the sentencing court did not adequately consider mitigating\n\nfactors generally do not raise a substantial question. Commonwealth v.\n\nDisalvo, 70 A.3d 900, 903 (Pa. Super. 2013). A specific claim that the court\n\nrefused to weigh mitigating factors as an appellant wished, absent more, does\n\nnot raise a substantial question. Moury, 992 A.2d at 175; Commonwealth\n\nv. Zirkle, 107 A.3d 127, 133 (Pa. Super. 2014) (\u201c[W]e have held that a claim\n\nthat a court did not weigh the factors as an appellant wishes does not raise a\n\nsubstantial question\u201d).\n\n       Appellant\u2019s claim amounts to no more than a bald allegation that the\n\ncourt abused its discretion in failing to consider mitigating factors as he\n\nwished. Pursuant to the above case law, Appellant has failed to raise a\n\nsubstantial question.6 His challenge to the discretionary aspects of his\n\nsentence, thus, fails.\n\n       Judgment of Sentence affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n6 Even if his argument had raised a substantial question, we would conclude\nthat there is no merit to Appellant\u2019s challenge. The trial court considered the\nAppellant\u2019s sentencing report, PSI, acceptance of responsibility, prior\nconvictions, gravity of the offense, rehabilitation, numerous letters from\nfamily members, the Victim\u2019s testimony, Appellant\u2019s allocution, and the\nsentencing guidelines. N.T. Sentencing at 11-15. Additionally, the court\nsentenced Appellant within the standard range of the sentencing\nguidelines. Id. at 15. \u201c[W]here a sentence is within the standard range of the\nguidelines, Pennsylvania law views the sentence as appropriate under the\nSentencing Code.\u201d Moury, 992 A.2d at 171.\n\n                                           -7-\n\fJ-S38027-19\n\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
