See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546. We affirm.\n\n       In September 2015, Miller pled guilty to third-degree murder and\n\ncarrying a firearm on a public street in Philadelphia.1 He was sentenced to 12\n\n\u00bd to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment on November 20, 2015. Miller did not file a direct\n\nappeal.\n\n       Miller previously filed a timely, pro se PCRA petition in 2016, his first.\n\nMiller claimed ineffectiveness of counsel surrounding his guilty plea and that\n\nhis sentence was excessive. Counsel was appointed, and subsequently filed a\n\nFinley2 no-merit letter and a motion to withdraw as counsel. In his no-merit\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2502(c) and 6108, respectively.\n\n\n2 Commonwealth v. Finley, 550 A.2d 213 (Pa.Super. 1988) (en banc).\n\fJ-S26043-23\n\n\n\nletter, PCRA counsel stated that he was unable to review the notes of\n\ntestimony from Miller\u2019s guilty plea hearing because he was informed by the\n\ncourt reporter that those notes were inadvertently destroyed. No-Merit Letter,\n\nfiled 11/13/17, at 1. PCRA counsel nonetheless concluded that Miller\u2019s claims\n\nwere without merit. Id.\n\n      The PCRA court issued a notice of its intent to dismiss the petition\n\npursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 907. Miller filed a pro se response to the court\u2019s Rule\n\n907 notice, in which he claimed, inter alia, his trial counsel was ineffective for\n\ncausing him to enter an unknowing plea and PCRA counsel was ineffective for\n\nfailing to allege trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Pro Se Response to Rule 907\n\nNotice, filed 12/28/17, at 1, 3. Miller also requested that PCRA counsel\n\n\u201cexplain why his claims have no merit especially since the [court] lost the\n\nrecord of [his] notes of testimony[.]\u201d Id. at 4.\n\n      The court dismissed the petition and granted PCRA counsel\u2019s request to\n\nwithdraw in January 2018. In an opinion, the court confirmed that the notes\n\nof testimony from Miller\u2019s plea hearing were inadvertently destroyed by the\n\ncourt reporter, but Miller \u201cpresent[ed] no evidence or argument indicating that\n\nany supplemental oral colloquy conducted at the time of the plea contradicted\n\nthe averments memorialized in his written colloquy.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, filed\n\n1/11/18, at 4-5, 5 n.3. As a result, the court concluded that Miller entered a\n\nknowing, intelligent, and voluntary guilty plea. Id. at 4-5. The court also found\n\nMiller\u2019s remaining claims to be without merit. Miller appealed, and this Court\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fJ-S26043-23\n\n\n\ndismissed his appeal for failure to file a brief. Commonwealth v. Miller, 510\n\nEDA 2018 (Pa.Super. filed January 4, 2019) (per curium order).\n\n      Miller filed the instant PCRA petition, pro se, on July 21, 2022. The PCRA\n\ncourt issued a Rule 907 notice, on August 3, 2022. Miller filed a pro se\n\nresponse to the court\u2019s Rule 907 notice. On September 1, 2022, the court\n\ndismissed the petition. This appeal followed.\n\n      Preliminary, we observe that Miller\u2019s brief is in violation of Rule of\n\nAppellate Procedure 2111(a) because it lacks a statement of jurisdiction, a\n\nstatement of the scope of review and standard of review, a statement of the\n\nquestions involved, a statement of the case, and a summary of the argument.\n\nSee Pa.R.A.P. 2111(a)(1), (3), (4), (5), and (6). An issue not presented in\n\nthe statement of questions involved is generally deemed waived. Krebs v.\n\nUnited Ref. Co. of Pa., 893 A.2d 776, 797 (Pa.Super. 2006). However, we\n\nbelieve we can discern the questions Miller presents from the argument\n\nsection of his brief. His failure to comply with the Rules of Appellate Procedure\n\ndoes not impede our review, and we decline to find waiver. See Werner v.\n\nWerner, 149 A.3d 338, 341 (Pa.Super. 2016).\n\n      Miller argues that the destruction of the transcripts of his plea hearing\n\ndenied him his right to appeal, and he is entitled to a new trial. See Miller\u2019s\n\nBr. at 2 (unpaginated). We do not reach the merits of that argument because\n\nhis PCRA petition was untimely.\n\n      On appeal from the denial or grant of relief under the PCRA, our review\n\nis limited to determining \u201cwhether the PCRA court\u2019s ruling is supported by the\n\n                                      -3-\n\fJ-S26043-23\n\n\n\nrecord and free of legal error.\u201d Commonwealth v. Presley, 193 A.3d 436,\n\n442 (Pa.Super. 2018) (citation omitted).\n\n      Any petition for PCRA relief, including second and subsequent petitions,\n\nmust be filed within one year of the date on which the judgment of sentence\n\nbecomes final, unless the petitioner pleads and proves an exception to the\n\none-year bar. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9545(b)(1). For purposes of the PCRA, \u201ca\n\njudgment becomes final at the conclusion of direct review, including\n\ndiscretionary review in the Supreme Court of the United States and the\n\nSupreme Court of Pennsylvania, or at the expiration of time for seeking the\n\nreview.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 9545(b)(3).\n\n      Courts may consider a PCRA petition filed more than one year after a\n\njudgment of sentence has become final only if the petitioner pleads and proves\n\none of the following three statutory exceptions:\n\n      (i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of\n      interference by government officials with the presentation of the\n      claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth\n      or the Constitution or laws of the United States;\n\n      (ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to\n      the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise\n      of due diligence; or\n\n      (iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was recognized\n      by the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme Court\n      of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in this section and\n      has been held by that court to apply retroactively.\n\nId. at \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fJ-S26043-23\n\n\n\n      Any petition attempting to invoke an exception \u201cshall be filed within one\n\nyear of the date the claim could have been presented.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 9545(b)(2).\n\nThe PCRA\u2019s time restrictions are jurisdictional, and \u201c[i]f a PCRA petition is\n\nuntimely, neither this Court nor the trial court has jurisdiction over the\n\npetition. Without jurisdiction, we simply do not have the legal authority to\n\naddress the substantive claims.\u201d Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 994 A.2d\n\n1091, 1093 (Pa. 2010) (citation omitted).\n\n      Miller\u2019s instant PCRA petition was filed more than six years after his\n\njudgment of sentence became final. Therefore, the petition is facially untimely,\n\nand Miller was required to plead and prove at least one of the time-bar\n\nexceptions.\n\n      Miller attempts to invoke the governmental interference exception to\n\nthe PCRA time-bar. Miller\u2019s Br. at 2 (unpaginated). His sole claim is that the\n\ndestruction of the notes of testimony of his guilty plea hearing by the Court\n\nReporter Administration constitutes a governmental interference. Miller\u2019s\n\nReply Br. at 2. In his view, the unavailability of the notes of testimony has\n\ndenied him a fair opportunity to challenge his guilty plea. Id. at 5. He\n\nconcludes that \u201cmeaningful appellate review is impossible absent a full\n\ntranscript.\u201d Miller\u2019s Br. at 3 (unpaginated).\n\n      To establish the governmental interference exception, a petitioner must\n\nplead and prove that the government interfered with the petitioner\u2019s ability to\n\npresent a claim. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i). The petitioner must show\n\nthat he would have filed his claim sooner, if not for the interference of a\n\n                                      -5-\n\fJ-S26043-23\n\n\n\ngovernment actor. Commonwealth v. Staton, 184 A.3d 949, 955 (Pa.\n\n2018).\n\n      Here, Miller failed to file his instant PCRA petition within one year of\n\nlearning of the destruction of the notes of testimony. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\n\n9545(b)(2). He was first made aware of the destruction of the transcript in\n\nPCRA counsel\u2019s no-merit letter dated November 13, 2017. Miller himself\n\nacknowledged the destruction of the transcript in his pro se response to the\n\ncourt\u2019s Rule 907 notice to dismiss his first PCRA petition that he filed on\n\nDecember 28, 2017. The PCRA court\u2019s January 11, 2018 opinion, which\n\ndismissed Miller\u2019s first PCRA petition, also discussed the destruction of the\n\ntranscript. Miller did not file the instant petition until July 21, 2022, more than\n\nfour years after first learning of the destruction of the transcript. Since Miller\n\ndid not file his petition within one year of the date the claim could have been\n\npresented, it is time-barred. Accordingly, the PCRA court was without\n\njurisdiction to entertain his claim and properly dismissed his petition as\n\nuntimely.\n\n      Order affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nDate: 11/20/2023\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f",
