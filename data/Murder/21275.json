See TEX .\n\nPENAL CODE ANN . \u00a7 19.02 (b)(1), (2) (Vernon 2003). By one issue, Duran argues that the\n\nevidence was legally and factually insufficient to prove he had the requisite mens rea. We\n\naffirm.\n\f                                               I. BACKGROUND\n\n       In the late afternoon of April 4, 2008, fifteen-year-old Duran called 911 from his\n\nmother's apartment and told the dispatcher that his fourteen-year-old girlfriend, Tiffany\n\nGonzalez, had been shot. Officers with the Corpus Christi Police Department (CCPD)\n\nrushed to the scene and found Duran pacing outside the apartment. Duran appeared\n\nagitated and upset. The officers went inside the apartment and discovered Gonzalez\n\nslumped over on the floor by Duran's bed with a gunshot wound to her head. The\n\nparamedics arrived on the scene and took Gonzalez to the hospital because she still\n\nexhibited vital signs. Gonzalez was pronounced dead that night. A medical examiner later\n\ndetermined the cause of death to be a gunshot wound to the head.\n\n       Duran was interviewed by CCPD but when he began to relate information that the\n\ninvestigators felt was incriminating, Duran was transported to the courthouse to be read\n\nhis rights by a magistrate, as is required in juvenile interrogations. See TEX . FAM . CODE\n\nANN . \u00a7 51.095(a) (Vernon 2008). After being read his rights, Duran gave a written\n\nstatement to the police.\n\n       Duran was initially charged as a juvenile with aggravated assault and then\n\nmanslaughter, but the State sought to transfer Duran's case out of juvenile court and certify\n\nhim to stand trial as an adult. The juvenile court agreed that Duran should be tried as an\n\nadult and waived its jurisdiction over his case.1 See id. \u00a7 54.02(a) (Vernon Supp. 2009).\n\nThereafter, Duran was charged as an adult in a two-paragraph, one-count indictment for\n\nfirst-degree murder. The indictment read as follows:\n\n\n\n       1\n           Duran does not challenge his certification to stand trial as an adult.\n\n                                                        2\n\f             [T]hat [Duran] . . . did then and there intentionally and knowingly\n       cause the death of an individual, Tiffany Gonzalez, by shooting Tiffany\n       Gonzalez with a firearm . . .\n\n               . . . that [Duran] did then and there with the intent to cause serious\n       bodily injury to an individual, Tiffany Gonzalez, do the act of shooting her\n       with a firearm; that this act was clearly dangerous to human life; and that this\n       act caused the death of Tiffany Gonzalez . . . .\n\nSee TEX . PENAL CODE ANN . \u00a7 19.02(b)(1), (2). Duran pleaded not guilty, and the jury trial\n\nof his case commenced on December 16, 2008.\n\n                                 A. The State's Evidence\n\n       The State's first witness was Luis Gonzalez, Tiffany's father. Luis testified that, on\n\nthe morning of the shooting, he dropped Tiffany off at her friend's house before school.\n\nHe stated that Tiffany was very happy that morning. Luis testified that he had given Tiffany\n\n$200 to go shopping that afternoon after school. He stated that Tiffany never told him she\n\nhad a boyfriend.\n\n       Next, the State presented the testimony of Sgt. Roberto Rodriguez, the CCPD\n\nofficer who was the first on the scene in response to Duran's 911 call. Sgt. Rodriguez\n\ntestified that when he arrived at the apartment, he found Duran waiting outside. Sgt.\n\nRodriguez stated that Duran told him Gonzalez had shot herself; Duran also told Sgt.\n\nRodriguez that he was in the shower when he heard the shot and that he thought Gonzalez\n\nwas playing with the gun. Sgt. Rodriguez testified that he went into the apartment and\n\nfound Gonzalez in Duran's bedroom, slumped over by the side of the bed, and that the gun\n\nwas three to four feet from her. Sgt. Rodriguez stated that the blood from Gonzalez's\n\nwound was congealing, which was an indication that it had been there for a while. Finally,\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fSgt. Rodriguez testified that he found half-eaten containers of food, school books, and\n\npapers in the bedroom.\n\n       The State then called Lydia Curiel, a communications manager for CCPD who\n\nhandled the 911 call Duran made after the shooting. Curiel testified that, in the call, Duran\n\nstated that Gonzalez was playing with the gun. Curiel stated that Duran seemed upset and\n\nsaid several times \"please hurry up,\" \"please come quick,\" and \"I don't know what to do.\"\n\n       Next, the State called Jason Smith, a CCPD officer who investigated the case.\n\nOfficer Smith testified that he interviewed Duran on the day of the shooting. Duran told\n\nOfficer Smith that he was \"freaking out\" and could not \"think straight.\" Officer Smith\n\ntestified that Duran seemed panicked and scared. Officer Smith testified that Duran\n\ndescribed the events of that day to him. Duran told Officer Smith that he and Gonzalez\n\nhad an argument that day, had consensual sex, had lain on Duran's bed to watch a movie,\n\nand that Gonzalez was playing with the gun. Duran also told Officer Smith that Gonzalez\n\nhad given him the gun two weeks earlier; however, Officer Smith testified that Duran had\n\nearlier told a different officer that Gonzalez gave him the gun on the day of the shooting.\n\nOfficer Smith stated that when Duran began making incriminating statements, he took\n\nDuran to the magistrate to be read his rights. Officer Smith further testified that he found\n\na pregnancy test at the scene. Finally, Officer Smith testified that no money was recovered\n\nfrom Gonzalez's person.\n\n       Deanie King, the municipal court judge who read Duran his rights, testified next.\n\nJudge King read the text of Duran's written statement to the jury, which included, in\n\nrelevant part, the following:\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f                My name is Everett Duran. . . . On 4/4/08 I was at the apartment with\n       my girlfriend Tiffany Gonzalez. We were lying on my bed, my gun was lying\n       next to me. Tiffany wanted to see my gun, Tiffany tried to grab my gun. I\n       asked her why. She didn't answer me. She just said, \"Let me see it.\" I\n       didn't let her. I grabbed it before she could. She had grabbed hold of the\n       barrel and I was trying to get it from her, and I was telling her, \"What are you\n       doing? It's going to go off.\" When I tried to take the gun from her, she was\n       fighting for it. We were kind of rolling around on the bed and the gun went\n       off. The gun went off as I was trying to stand up. I was still on the bed when\n       the gun went off. It only went off one time. There should be five more\n       rounds in it. She was lying on the bed after the gun went off. I looked at her\n       head and saw blood gushing out. I picked her up and looked at her head\n       and put her down on the floor. I had the gun in my hand and I put it on the\n       floor next to her, then I grabbed her. I don't remember if I put the gun in her\n       hand or not. I was freaking out and my mind was spinning. I had blood on\n       my hands and my shirt. I took off my shirt and put it into the closet. . . . I\n       called my mom and told her that Tiffany shot herself and was dead. After I\n       called my mom, I called 911 and told them to come, that my girlfriend was\n       dead. I washed my hands in the bathroom upstairs and changed my shirt.\n       Tiffany gave me the gun about two weeks ago. I do not know where she got\n       it, but she gave it to me and told me to keep it. I kept the gun on the side of\n       my bed. . . . I have shot the gun before on the first day she gave it to me. .\n       . . I did not mean for this to happen. I was trying to prevent it from\n       happening when I was trying to get the gun from her. Then I tried to clean\n       the gun with a shirt.\n\n       After Judge King, the State called Carolyn Martinez and Kelly Martinez, both of\n\nwhom performed forensics investigations on the night of the shooting. Carolyn testified\n\nthat the gun found at the scene was a single-action revolver. Kelly described the crime\n\nscene and testified that she found condom wrappers on the bed and blood on the bedding\n\nand edge of the bed. Kelly also testified that she found blood smeared on the wall of the\n\nbedroom and a bullet on the floor. Kelly stated that no gunshot residue tests were\n\nperformed on Gonzalez's hands because she was in the hospital intensive care unit at the\n\ntime of Kelly's investigation on the night of the shooting.\n\n       Victoria Alvarado was the next witness called by the State. Alvarado testified that\n\nshe was one of Gonzalez's friends. In her testimony, Alvarado described two incidents\n\n                                              5\n\finvolving Duran and the gun that occurred in the months prior to the shooting. Alvarado\n\ntestified that, one time, she was at Duran's apartment with Gonzalez. Alvarado stated that\n\nGonzalez was sitting on the bed beside Duran when Duran got on top of Gonzalez, pointed\n\nthe gun at her, and asked Gonzalez if she was scared. In the second incident described\n\nby Alvarado, she and Gonzalez were at Duran's sister's house, and Duran showed them\n\nthe gun again. Alvarado testified that both incidents occurred more than two weeks before\n\nthe shooting.\n\n       Next, the State presented the testimony of Ray Fernandez, M.D., the medical\n\nexaminer for Nueces County who performed the autopsy on Gonzalez's body. Dr.\n\nFernandez testified that the fracture pattern at the base of Gonzalez's skull, the periorbital\n\nbleeding within Gonzalez's skull, and the gunshot residue particles in the tissue around the\n\nwound indicated that the muzzle of the gun was flush against Gonzalez's right temple when\n\nit was fired. Based on the foregoing, Dr. Fernandez concluded that the wound on\n\nGonzalez's right temple was a contact wound. Dr. Fernandez also testified that the\n\nentrance wound on Gonzalez's temple was higher than the exit wound on the back of her\n\nhead, which indicated that the bullet was on a downward path. Dr. Fernandez noted that\n\nthere were no powder burns on Gonzalez's hands but that she had bruising on her upper\n\nright arm and left wrist that were consistent with blunt force trauma. On cross-examination,\n\nDr. Fernandez stated that there was no muzzle imprint on Gonzalez's forehead; that the\n\nbruises on Gonzalez's arm and wrist could have been caused by any blunt trauma,\n\nincluding bumping into something; and that, even if a person was holding onto a gun when\n\nit fired, it is possible that there would be no powder burns on that person's hands.\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f      Finally, the State called CCPD Detective Robert Lee McFarland, who investigated\n\nthe text messaging records of Duran and Gonzalez. Detective McFarland testified that\n\nthere was no information in either Gonzalez or Duran's text messages indicating that\n\nGonzalez and Duran had been arguing or that Gonzalez was having suicidal thoughts.\n\n                              B. The Defense's Evidence\n\n      The defense presented the testimony of several witnesses rebutting the State's\n\nevidence and regarding the nature of Duran's relationship with Gonzalez. Hallie Rodriguez,\n\nDuran's sister, testified that Alvarado came to their mother's apartment on several\n\noccasions because she wanted a relationship with Duran. Hayley Ochoa, a friend of Duran\n\nand Gonzalez, stated that Alvarado is known to be a liar; Ochoa also testified that Duran\n\nand Gonzalez were a happy couple. Ruben DeLeon, Duran's grandfather, testified that he\n\nhad been at the apartment on the day of the shooting to drop off a couch that he and\n\nDuran's grandmother were giving to the family. Ruben stated that he had met Gonzalez\n\non several occasions and that Duran and Gonzalez seemed to be in love.\n\n      Next, the defense called Rachel DeLeon, Duran's mother. Rachel testified that she\n\npicked up Gonzalez on the day of the shooting and brought her to the apartment. Rachel\n\nstated that she helped Gonzalez take a pregnancy test, that the results were negative, and\n\nthat Gonzalez and Duran were relieved by the results. Rachel then testified that she left\n\nGonzalez and Duran at the apartment to go shopping with Hallie. While they were\n\nshopping, Rachel received a call from Duran that Gonzalez had shot herself. Rachel\n\ntestified that she then rushed back to the apartment and found law enforcement and\n\nemergency medical personnel there when she arrived. Rachel confirmed that Alvarado\n\nhad been to the apartment before on other occasions.\n\n                                            7\n\f        Finally, the defense presented the testimony of Reymundo Rodriguez, a deputy in\n\nthe Nueces County Constable's office. Deputy Rodriguez stated that he was the firearms\n\ninstructor for the constable's office and an adjunct law enforcement and firearms instructor\n\nat Del Mar College in Corpus Christi. Deputy Rodriguez testified that the gun that shot\n\nGonzalez was an unsafe and unreliable weapon. Deputy Rodriguez stated that the gun\n\nwas a remake of an western-style Colt single-action revolver and that it had a high\n\nprobability of accidental discharge. Deputy Rodriguez explained that the firing pin in the\n\ngun is located directly over the ammunition round with the hammer resting on top of the\n\nfiring pin. Deputy Rodriguez testified that the gun can fire\n\n        if you touch the hammer without fully cocking the weapon . . . . All you need\n        to do is just very slightly just pull this back slightly, let it go. It's a rim fire. If\n        it hits the rim of that case the weapon will go off. Kind of like similar back in\n        the old western movies, fanning, you barely touch it, you can make the gun\n        go off real first [sic] fast. You know, the cowboys. So you don't even have\n        to completely cock the hammer back to the fourth position to press the\n        trigger for this weapon to go off. This weapon can go off at the slightest.[2]\n\nDeputy Rodriguez also testified that he had experience in criminal investigations and that,\n\nif there was no ring around an entrance wound, it was not a contact wound.\n\n        After the close of evidence, the trial court presented the charge to the jury. The\n\nmurder charge, tracking the indictment, authorized the jury to find Duran guilty of murder\n\nif it found beyond a reasonable doubt that Duran either: (1) intentionally or knowingly\n\ncaused Gonzalez's death by shooting her with a firearm; or (2) with the intent to cause\n\nserious bodily injury, shot Gonzalez, which was an act clearly dangerous to human life that\n\n\n        2\n           In response to Deputy Rodriguez, the State re-called Carolyn Martinez, who testified that she had\nfirearm s training, as well. She testified she had found indications on the gun's \"cartridges\" that they had been\nhit by the firing pin without firing, which indicated that the gun had m isfired on several occasions. Martinez\ntestified that the gun was unreliable but that she would treat it with respect regardless.\n\n                                                       8\n\fcaused Gonzalez's death.3 After considering the evidence, the jury returned a general\n\nverdict convicting Duran of murder; the jury sentenced him to seventy-five years'\n\nincarceration and assessed a $7,500 fine. This appeal followed.\n\n                         II. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND APPLICABLE LAW\n\n        In conducting a legal sufficiency review, an appellate court must view all the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and determine not \"'whether it believes\n\nthat the evidence at trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,'\" but rather, whether\n\na rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. Laster v. State, 275 S.W.3d 512, 517 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (quoting\n\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318-19 (1979)); Escamilla v. State, 143 S.W.3d 814,\n\n817 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). The trier of fact is the sole judge of the facts, the credibility\n\nof the witnesses, and the weight given to testimony. See TEX . CODE CRIM . PROC . ANN . art.\n\n38.04 (Vernon 1979); Beckham v. State, 29 S.W.3d 148, 151 (Tex. App.\u2013Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2000, pet. ref'd). We do not reevaluate the weight and credibility of the evidence,\n\nand we do not substitute our own judgment for the trier of fact. King v. State, 29 S.W.3d\n\n556, 562 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (en banc); Beckham, 29 S.W.3d at 151. Instead, we\n\nresolve any inconsistencies in the evidence in favor of the judgment and consider whether\n\nthe jury reached a rational decision. Curry v. State, 30 S.W.3d 394, 406 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2000); Beckham, 29 S.W.3d at 151.\n\n        In a factual sufficiency review, we view all of the evidence in a neutral light to\n\ndetermine whether a jury was rationally justified in finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n        3\n         The jury charge also included alternative instructions for m anslaughter and crim inally negligent\nhom icide.\n\n                                                    9\n\fWatson v. State, 204 S.W.3d 404, 414-15 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). Evidence may be\n\nfactually insufficient if: (1) it is so weak as to be clearly wrong and manifestly unjust, or (2)\n\nthe jury's verdict is against the great weight and preponderance of the available evidence.\n\nId. Unless the record clearly reveals that a different result is appropriate, we must defer\n\nto the fact finder's determination concerning the weight to be given to contradictory\n\ntestimony. Lancon v. State, 253 S.W.3d 699, 705 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). And unless we\n\ncan say with some objective basis in the record that the great weight and preponderance\n\nof the evidence contradicts the jury's verdict, we will not reverse the judgment as factually\n\ninsufficient. Watson, 204 S.W.3d at 417.\n\n       Both legal and factual sufficiency are measured by the elements of the offense as\n\ndefined by a hypothetically correct jury charge. Malik v. State, 953 S.W.2d 234, 240 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1997); Adi v. State, 94 S.W.3d 124, 131 (Tex. App.\u2013Corpus Christi 2002, pet.\n\nref'd). Such a charge is one that accurately sets out the law, is authorized by the\n\nindictment, does not unnecessarily restrict the State's theories of liability, and adequately\n\ndescribes the particular offense for which the defendant was tried. Gollihar v. State, 46\n\nS.W.3d 243, 253 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001); Malik, 953 S.W.2d at 240. When, as here, a\n\ngeneral verdict is returned by the jury and evidence is sufficient under any of the paragraph\n\nallegations submitted, the verdict will be upheld. Davila v. State, 952 S.W.2d 872, 875\n\n(Tex. App.\u2013Corpus Christi 1997, pet. ref'd).\n\n       Under a hypothetically correct jury charge in this case, a person commits the\n\noffense of murder if he \"intentionally or knowingly causes the death of an individual\" or\n\n\"intends to cause serious bodily injury and commits an act clearly dangerous to human life\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\fthat causes the death of an individual.\" TEX . PENAL CODE ANN . \u00a7 19.02(b)(1), (2). A person\n\nacts intentionally when it is his conscious objective or desire to engage in the conduct or\n\ncause the result. Id. \u00a7 6.03(a) (Vernon 2003). A person acts knowingly when he is aware\n\nof the nature of his conduct or of the circumstances surrounding his conduct and when he\n\nis reasonably certain his conduct will cause the result. Id. \u00a7 6.03(b).\n\n       Every fact need not point directly and independently to the accused's guilt.\n\nVanderbilt v. State, 629 S.W.2d 709, 716 (Tex. Crim. App. 1981). \"Proof of a mental state,\n\nsuch as intent, must almost always be proved by circumstantial evidence.\" Smith v. State,\n\n56 S.W.3d 739, 745 (Tex. App.\u2013Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. ref'd). As such, \"the State\n\nmay prove . . . criminal culpability by either direct or circumstantial evidence, coupled with\n\nall reasonable inferences from that evidence,\" and a conclusion of guilt can rest on the\n\ncombined and cumulative force of all the incriminating circumstances. Gardner v. State,\n\nNo. AP-75,582, 2009 WL 3365652, at *4 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 21, 2009); see Vanderbilt,\n\n629 S.W.2d at 716.\n\n       Intent to cause a victim's death, in particular, may be inferred from the surrounding\n\ncircumstances, including the acts, words, and conduct of the accused and the extent of the\n\ninjuries. Patrick v. State, 906 S.W.2d 481, 487 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (en banc); see also\n\nHernandez v. State, 190 S.W.3d 856, 866 (Tex. App.\u2013Corpus Christi 2006, no pet.)\n\n(holding that intent to commit an offense may be inferred from the surrounding\n\ncircumstances). The jury, which holds the exclusive power to determine the issue of intent,\n\nmay infer intent to kill from the use of a deadly weapon. Smith, 56 S.W.3d at 745 (citing\n\nMercado v.

Moreover, consciousness of guilt may be one of the strongest indicators of guilt, and\n\nfalse statements made by the defendant to cover up the crime and other subterfuge are\n\nproof of this consciousness.

App.\u2013El Paso\n\n1989, pet. ref'd).\n\n                                      III. DISCUSSION\n\n       By one issue, Duran complains that the evidence was legally and factually\n\ninsufficient to prove he had the requisite mens rea to be convicted of murder. Specifically,\n\nDuran argues that \"the evidence adduced at trial\" was insufficient to prove \"him guilty of\n\nthe intentional crime of murder.\" We note at the outset that Duran's brief fails to address\n\nall of the several mental states upon which the jury could have convicted him\u2014i.e,\n\nintentionally or knowingly causing Gonzalez's death; or intending to cause serious bodily\n\ninjury and committing an act clearly dangerous to Gonzalez's life that causes her death.\n\nSee TEX . PENAL CODE ANN . \u00a7 19.03(b)(1), (2). However, in the interest of justice and at\n\nour sole discretion, we will nevertheless examine the evidence presented at trial and\n\ndetermine whether it sufficed to support the jury's finding that Duran had the requisite mens\n\nrea.\n\n       The following is evidence from which a rational jury could have inferred Duran's\n\nguilt: (1) Gonzalez's father gave her $200 on the morning of her death, but no money was\n\nrecovered from her person after she was killed; (2) Duran seemed upset when he called\n\n911 and appeared nervous and agitated when Sgt. Rodriguez encountered him outside the\n\napartment; (3) Duran told inconsistent stories about when and where he got the gun, telling\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fone police officer that Gonzalez gave him the gun two weeks before the shooting and\n\nanother officer that she gave him the gun the day of the shooting; (4) Duran told\n\ninconsistent stories about the incident, including that Gonzalez shot herself, that he was\n\nin the shower when he heard the shot and that he thought Gonzalez was playing with the\n\ngun, and, from Duran's written statement, that Gonzalez and he were wrestling over the\n\ngun and it accidentally fired; (4) after the shooting, Duran washed his hands in the\n\nbathroom, changed his shirt, and wiped down the gun; (5) the blood from Gonzalez's head\n\nwound was congealed by the time law enforcement and paramedics reached the scene,\n\nindicating that some time had passed between the shooting and Duran's call to 911; (6)\n\nDuran had, on two prior occasions, pulled the gun on Gonzalez and asked her if she was\n\nscared and both incidents occurred more than two weeks before the shooting; (7) the\n\nevidence gathered by Dr. Fernandez during Gonzalez's autopsy indicated that the gun was\n\nflush against Gonzalez's temple when it was fired and that the bullet was on a downward\n\npath; and (8) Dr. Fernandez noted that he found no powder burns on Gonzalez's hands but\n\nfound bruises on Gonzalez's arm and wrist consistent with blunt force trauma. See, e.g.,\n\nRamirez v. State, 229 S.W.3d 725, 729 (Tex. App.\u2013San Antonio 2007, no pet.) (op. on\n\nreh'g) (upholding a murder conviction where the defendant claimed the shooting was an\n\naccident but failed to call the police or hospital, had blood on his shirt that was dried and\n\ncrusted by the time he brought the victim to the hospital, and told inconsistent stories about\n\nthe incident); Leal v. State, 800 S.W.2d 346, 348-49 (Tex. App.\u2013Corpus Christi 1990, pet.\n\nref'd) (affirming a murder conviction as supported by sufficient evidence, even though the\n\ndefendant claimed he was playing with the gun and accidentally shot the victim, where the\n\ncircumstances showed that the victim's money was missing after the shooting, that the\n\n                                             13\n\fdefendant did not promptly seek medical attention for the victim, and that the defendant's\n\nclaims of being scared or panicked were arguably false).\n\n       Duran points us to several pieces of contrary evidence. First, he argues that there\n\nwas no evidence of motive because the testimony at trial established that he and Gonzalez\n\nwere a happy couple and that they were just eating and studying together in his bedroom\n\nthat afternoon. Duran contends that there was no evidence of an argument or any other\n\nstrife between him and Gonzalez. Motive is not an element of murder, however, and the\n\nState need not prove one to obtain a conviction. See Lerma v. State, 632 S.W.2d 893, 895\n\n(Tex. App.\u2013Corpus Christi 1982, pet. ref'd). The State's failure, if any, to prove motive is\n\ninconsequential when considered in context of the wealth of other evidence pointing to\n\nDuran's guilt. See Vanderbilt, 629 S.W.2d at 716.\n\n       Duran also argues that his varying accounts of the events surrounding the shooting\n\nwere not entirely contradictory and do not suffice to prove his guilt. Furthermore, Duran\n\ncontends that his guilt is not shown by the evidence that, after the shooting, he wiped the\n\ngun off, washed the blood off his hands, and took off his bloody shirt. Duran argues that\n\nthe foregoing was merely conduct \"consistent with [his] mental state, age, and situation.\"\n\nWe disagree and conclude that the jury was entitled to consider both the inconsistent\n\nstories Duran told investigators and Duran's suspicious conduct following the shooting as\n\ncircumstantial evidence of Duran's intent to kill Gonzalez. See Patrick, 906 S.W.3d at 487;\n\nRoss, 154 S.W.3d at 812 (holding that a false statement made by the defendant may be\n\none of the strongest indicators of guilt); Huffman, 775 S.W.2d at 660 (noting that\n\n\"[e]vidence of subterfuge . . . serves not only to negate attempted exculpatory hypotheses,\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fbut also by its inherent connection to motive and sense of guilt, may provide affirmative\n\nevidence of culpability\").\n\n       Finally, Duran argues that the physical evidence related to the gun and gunshot\n\nwound was not indicative of an intentional killing and that, generally, the evidence is more\n\nconsistent with an accidental killing as opposed to an intentional one. Duran relies heavily\n\non the testimony of Deputy Rodriguez, who stated at trial the gun used in the shooting was\n\nprone to accidental discharge. However, we fail to see how the reliability of the gun\n\nnegates the ample evidence of Duran's guilt. In other words, it does not necessarily follow\n\nthat the shooting was accidental merely because the gun used in commission of this\n\noffense has a high probability of accidentally firing.\n\n       In fact, the jury was entitled to infer intent to kill from the use of a deadly weapon\n\nalone. See Smith, 56 S.W.3d at 745. Moreover, the jury could have inferred that Duran\n\nintentionally caused Gonzalez bodily injury and committed a clearly dangerous act that led\n\nto Gonzalez's death from the following: the bruises on Gonzalez's arm and wrist coupled\n\nwith the testimonial evidence that Duran had pointed the gun at Gonzalez on prior\n\noccasions and physical evidence that the gun was resting against Gonzalez's right temple\n\nwhen it was fired. See Patrick, 906 S.W.2d at 487. So, although Duran's evidence\n\nregarding the unreliability of the gun is some circumstantial evidence that the shooting may\n\nhave been an accident, there was, as previously discussed, ample evidence that Duran\n\neither intentionally or knowingly caused Gonzalez's death or intentionally caused bodily\n\ninjury to Gonzalez and committed an act clearly dangerous to human life that caused her\n\ndeath. See Gardner, 2009 WL 3365652, at *4; Vanderbilt, 629 S.W.2d at 716.\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       The jury here was free to accept or reject the testimony of any witness and evidently\n\nchose to believe the State's witnesses. We remain mindful of such findings and our\n\nattendant responsibility to defer to the jury's determination regarding the credibility of\n\nwitnesses and weight to be given to the evidence. See Lancon, 253 S.W.3d at 705; King,\n\n29 S.W.3d at 562. In sum, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,\n\nwe conclude that a rational trier of fact could have determined that Duran was guilty of\n\nmurder under either paragraph of the murder charge given to the jury in this case. See\n\nTEX . PENAL CODE ANN . \u00a7\u00a7 6.03(a), (b), 19.02(b)(1), (2); Laster, 275 S.W.3d at 517; Davila,\n\n952 S.W.2d at 875. Moreover, after considering all of the evidence in a neutral light, we\n\ncannot conclude that the evidence of Duran's mental state was so weak as to be clearly\n\nwrong and manifestly unjust or that the jury's verdict was against the great weight and\n\npreponderance of the evidence. See Watson, 204 S.W.3d at 414-15. Having concluded\n\nthe evidence was legally and factually sufficient, Duran's sole issue is overruled.\n\n                                     IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       The judgment of conviction is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                        NELDA V.
