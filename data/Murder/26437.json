Smallwood appeals from the order dismissing his first\n\npetition filed under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-\n\n9546.      Appellant argues that the PCRA court erred in dismissing his\n\nineffectiveness claims against trial counsel and appellate counsel without a\n\nhearing. We affirm.\n\n        On March 28, 2012, Appellant was charged with first-degree murder and\n\npossession of an instrument of crime in connection with the killing of Shawn\n\nAndrews (the Victim). The matter proceeded to a jury trial, where the details\n\nof the killing were established through Appellant\u2019s statement to police:\n\n           We started out on Thursday at 2:00 in the morning getting\n           high. We had some girls over there. He put the girls out\n           and then he said he wanted to make another phone call to\n           have some more drugs dropped off. I told him I was tired\n____________________________________________\n\n\n*   Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-S67027-18\n\n\n         and only had $4 left to my name and I had a lot on my mind.\n         After that, the argument continued and he wanted to\n         continue to get high and I didn\u2019t want to.\n\n         I got up and went to the bedroom and laid down. He walked\n         around the kitchen and started slamming pots around. After\n         that, I jumped up and we started to argue. He told me that\n         I had to roll. I told him I wasn\u2019t going any place, that I just\n         gave him $250, and I gave him $100 on Monday.\n\n         Then the argument started, then everything went boom. I\n         might have pushed him out of the way because I was going\n         back to the bedroom and then he pushed me. He picked up\n         scissors and I picked up a knife. We started fighting. I\n         stabbed him in the side of the jaw. I just wanted him to\n         stop hollering. I knew if the neighbors came down and saw\n         all the blood that it was a wrap.\n\n         He lost the scissors. And the knife that I had bent up, I lost\n         the knife. I reached over and grabbed the iron. He was\n         laying on his back. I got on top of him and I hit him with\n         the iron until it broke. After that, he was just laying there\n         breathing and bleeding out. After that, I didn\u2019t want to see\n         him, so I ran and got a quilt and covered him up. I knew\n         from watching TV that rigor mortis was going to settle in\n         and I\u2019m not that strong so I went ahead and dragged him\n         into the closet.\n\n         I knew that once rigor mortis set in I couldn\u2019t move him and\n         then I passed out on the bed. When I got up it was Friday.\n         I collected my things, turned the thermostat up, took some\n         of the bloody clothes and put them in a blue bag, then I\n         went to 69th Street and dumped them there.\n\nN.T., 7/24/2013, at 149-148.\n\n      The Commonwealth presented expert testimony from Marlon Osbourne,\n\nM.D., assistant medical examiner for the Philadelphia Medical Examiner\u2019s\n\nOffice, who testified regarding the Victim\u2019s injuries. Id. at 113. Dr. Osbourne\n\nstated that the fatal stab wound was located on the left side of the Victim\u2019s\n\nneck. Id. at 127. The Victim also sustained several non-fatal stab wounds,\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fJ-S67027-18\n\n\n\nwhich were located on the right side of his neck, his chin, his left cheek, his\n\nupper back, and his lower back. Id. at 126-27. In addition, Dr. Osbourne\n\nindicated that the Victim had several lacerations consistent with blunt force\n\ntrauma. Id. at 123. The Victim also had multiple abrasions on his hands\n\nwhich Dr. Osbourne described as \u201cdefensive wounds.\u201d Id. at 128.\n\n      Detective Francis Kane testified that he conducted Appellant\u2019s interview\n\nat the Homicide Division. Id. at 135. He stated that most of what Appellant\n\nsaid in his statement was corroborated at the scene. Id. at 167. However,\n\nthe police were unable to recover the pair of scissors that the Victim allegedly\n\npicked up during the altercation. Id. Detective Kane also testified regarding\n\nphotographs he took of Appellant\u2019s hand injuries on the day he gave his police\n\nstatement. Id. at 164. Detective Kane stated that Appellant did not have\n\nany injuries on his right hand, but had several lacerations on his left hand.\n\nId. at 165.    Detective Kane opined that the left-hand lacerations were\n\noffensive wounds, likely because \u201c[h]e had the knife in his hand, and as he\n\nwas stabbing someone, it slipped.\u201d Id. at 165-66.\n\n      Appellant requested a jury instruction for voluntary manslaughter \u2013 heat\n\nof passion. Id. at 97. The Commonwealth argued that the instruction was\n\nunwarranted because nothing in the statement or the record demonstrated\n\nthat there was \u201csudden and intense passion.\u201d Id. at 101. The trial court\n\ndenied Appellant\u2019s request and instructed the jury on the elements of first-\n\ndegree and third-degree murder.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fJ-S67027-18\n\n\n\n      Thereafter, Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and\n\nsentenced to a mandatory term of life in prison without the possibility of\n\nparole. Appellant filed a direct appeal, and this Court affirmed Appellant\u2019s\n\njudgment of sentence on April 7, 2015. See Commonwealth v. Smallwood,\n\n2231 EDA 2013 (filed April 7, 2015) (unpublished mem.).\n\n      Appellant\u2019s timely pro se PCRA petition, his first, was docketed by the\n\nPCRA court on April 15, 2017. The PCRA court appointed counsel who filed an\n\namended petition on June 3, 2017. On March 19, 2018, the PCRA court issued\n\na Pa.R.Crim.P. 907 notice of intent to dismiss Appellant\u2019s petition without a\n\nhearing. See Rule 907 Not., 3/19/18. The PCRA court dismissed Appellant\u2019s\n\npetition on April 19, 2018. That same day, Appellant filed a timely notice of\n\nappeal.   Both Appellant and the PCRA court subsequently complied with\n\nPa.R.A.P. 1925.\n\n      Appellant raises the following questions on appeal:\n\n      1. Did the PCRA court err in dismissing Appellant\u2019s PCRA [p]etition\n         without a hearing because direct appeal counsel was ineffective\n         for failing to raise the denial of Appellant\u2019s request for a\n         [v]oluntary [m]anslaughter jury instruction on direct appeal?\n\n      2. Did the PCRA court err in dismissing Appellant\u2019s PCRA [p]etition\n         without a hearing because trial counsel was ineffective for\n         failing to file a post-sentence [m]otion as to the weight of the\n         evidence for the [f]irst-[d]egree [m]urder conviction?\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 4.\n\n      Our standard of review from the dismissal of a PCRA petition \u201cis limited\n\nto examining whether the PCRA court\u2019s determination is supported by the\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fJ-S67027-18\n\n\n\nevidence of record and whether it is free of legal error.\u201d Commonwealth v.\n\nOusley, 21 A.3d 1238, 1242 (Pa. Super. 2011) (citation omitted).\n\n      To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant\n\n\u201cmust show, by a preponderance of the evidence, ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel which, in the circumstances of the particular case, so undermined the\n\ntruth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence\n\ncould have taken place.\u201d Commonwealth v. Turetsky, 925 A.2d 876, 880\n\n(Pa. Super. 2007) (citation omitted).\n\n      The burden is on the defendant to prove all three of the following\n\nprongs: \u201c(1) the underlying claim is of arguable merit; (2) that counsel had\n\nno reasonable strategic basis for his or her action or inaction; and (3) but for\n\nthe errors and omissions of counsel, there is a reasonable probability that the\n\noutcome of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d              Id. (citation\n\nomitted); see also Commonwealth v. Daniels, 963 A.2d 409, 419 (Pa.\n\n2009) (\u201cA failure to satisfy any prong of the ineffectiveness test requires\n\nrejection of the claim of ineffectiveness.\u201d (citation omitted)). \u201cCounsel cannot\n\nbe   deemed    ineffective   for   failing   to   pursue   a   meritless   claim.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Loner, 836 A.2d 125, 132 (Pa. Super. 2003) (en banc).\n\n      Moreover, a PCRA petitioner is not automatically entitled to an\n\nevidentiary hearing on his petition. See Commonwealth v. Smith, 121 A.3d\n\n1049, 1052 (Pa. Super. 2015).       \u201c[T]he PCRA court can decline to hold a\n\nhearing if there is no genuine issue concerning any material fact and the\n\npetitioner is not entitled to postconviction collateral relief, and no purpose\n\n                                      -5-\n\fJ-S67027-18\n\n\n\nwould be served by any further proceedings.\u201d Id. On appeal, we \u201cexamine\n\neach of the issues raised in the PCRA petition in light of the record in order to\n\ndetermine whether the PCRA court erred in concluding that there were no\n\ngenuine issues of material fact and in denying relief without an evidentiary\n\nhearing.\u201d Id. (citation omitted).\n\n      In his first issue, Appellant argues that direct appeal counsel was\n\nineffective for failing to challenge the trial court\u2019s denial of his request for a\n\nvoluntary manslaughter jury instruction.      Appellant\u2019s Brief at 8.   Appellant\n\nasserts that \u201calthough [he] killed [the Victim] with a knife and iron, [the\n\nVictim] was in possession of scissors and, therefore, Appellant acted under a\n\nsudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by [the\n\nVictim].\u201d   Id.   He claims that the evidence established that Appellant and\n\nVictim \u201cgot into a serious and escalating domestic argument when drugs had\n\nbeen used and there was a dispute over money.\u201d Id. at 12. He also argues\n\nthat \u201cthere was screaming and an escalation of physical violence . . . [Victim]\n\npicked up scissors first and then Appellant initially grabbed a knife and stabbed\n\n[Victim].\u201d Id. He contends that, \u201c[u]nder these circumstances, it was a jury\n\nquestion as to whether Appellant was acting under a sudden and intense\n\npassion resulting from serious provocation.\u201d Id. Appellant concludes that,\n\nbased on his version of the facts, he was entitled to a voluntary manslaughter\n\ninstruction and direct appeal counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the\n\nissue on appeal. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fJ-S67027-18\n\n\n\n      When reviewing a challenge to jury instructions, this Court will \u201creverse\n\na [trial] court\u2019s decision only when it abused its discretion or committed an\n\nerror of law.\u201d Commonwealth v. Baker, 24 A.3d 1006, 1022 (Pa. Super.\n\n2011) (citation omitted). When a trial court refuses to deliver a specific jury\n\ninstruction, \u201cit is the function of this Court to determine whether the record\n\nsupports the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d    Commonwealth v. Buterbaugh, 91\n\nA.3d 1247, 1257 (Pa. Super. 2014) (en banc) (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he\n\nrelevant inquiry for this Court . . . is whether such charge was warranted by\n\nthe evidence in the case.\u201d Commonwealth v. Baker, 963 A.2d 495, 506\n\n(Pa. Super. 2008) (citation omitted).\n\n      Trial courts are not to instruct a jury on legal principles that are not\n\napplicable to the facts presented at trial because such instructions are likely\n\nto confuse jurors and place obstacles in the path of a just verdict.      See\n\nCommonwealth v. Taylor, 876 A.2d 916, 925 (Pa. 2005).             Therefore, a\n\ndefendant must establish that the trial evidence would have reasonably\n\nsupported a verdict based on the desired charge, and may not claim\n\nentitlement to an instruction that is not supported by the evidence presented\n\nat trial. Id. at 925-26.\n\n      Additionally, \u201c[u]nder Pennsylvania law, a homicide defendant is entitled\n\nto a charge on involuntary or voluntary manslaughter only if the evidence\n\nadduced at trial would reasonably support a verdict on such a charge.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Soltis, 687 A.2d 1139, 1141 (Pa. Super. 1996) (citations\n\nomitted). \u201cIn other words, a trial court can give a manslaughter instruction\n\n                                        -7-\n\fJ-S67027-18\n\n\n\nonly when there is evidence tending to show that the defendant is not guilty\n\nof the crime of murder but is guilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter.\u201d Id.\n\n(citation omitted).    \u201cIn determining whether the evidence would support a\n\nmanslaughter charge, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto the defendant.\u201d Id. (citation omitted).\n\n      Our Supreme Court has stated that to determine \u201cwhether there was\n\nsufficient provocation to create uncontrollable passion in a reasonable person,\n\nwe determine whether the killer actually acted in the heat of passion, whether\n\nthe provocation lead directly to the slaying of the person responsible for the\n\nprovocation, and whether the killer had sufficient cooling off time.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth          v.   Martin,   5   A.3d   177,   186   (Pa.   2010)   (citing\n\nCommonwealth v. McCusker, 292 A.2d 286, 290 (Pa. 1972)).                    \u201cIf any\n\nelement is missing, the provocation defense fails.\u201d Martin, 5 A.3d at 186\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n      Our Supreme Court has also stated that\n\n      [r]elevant to the heat of passion claim, we note that a defendant\n      charged with murder may establish that he is guilty, not of\n      murder, but rather of voluntary manslaughter, by proving that, at\n      the time of the killing, he was acting under a sudden and intense\n      passion resulting from serious provocation by the victim.\n      Emotions encompassed by the term passion include anger, rage,\n      sudden resentment or terror which renders the mind incapable of\n      reason.\n\n      Whether the provocation by the victim was sufficient to support a\n      heat of passion defense is determined by an objective test:\n      whether a reasonable man who was confronted with the provoking\n      events would become impassioned to the extent that his mind was\n      incapable of cool reflection. Significantly, we have clarified that\n      both passion and provocation must be established, and that if\n\n                                         -8-\n\fJ-S67027-18\n\n\n      there be provocation without passion, or passion without a\n      sufficient cause of provocation, or there be time to cool, and\n      reason has resumed its sway, the killing will be murder.\n\nCommonwealth v. Busanet, 54 A.3d 35, 55 (Pa. 2012) (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      In dismissing Appellant\u2019s petition, the PCRA court concluded that the\n\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion, as the evidence did not reasonably\n\nestablish the elements required for a voluntary manslaughter defense. See\n\nPCRA Ct. Op., 5/30/18, at 9. We agree.\n\n      Instantly, Appellant\u2019s statement to police established that Appellant and\n\nthe Victim were in an argument when the Victim picked up a pair of scissors.\n\nN.T., 7/24/13, at 148. At that point, Appellant picked up a knife, Appellant\n\nand the Victim fought, and Appellant stabbed the Victim in the side of the jaw.\n\nId. at 149. Appellant stated that, at that moment, \u201cI just wanted him to stop\n\nhollering. I knew if the neighbors came down and saw all the blood that it\n\nwas a wrap.\u201d Id. Thereafter, Appellant stabbed the Victim multiple times\n\nuntil the knife bent. Id. At that point, Appellant grabbed a clothing iron,\n\nwhich he used to bludgeon the Victim until it broke. Id. As the Victim laid on\n\nthe floor \u201cbreathing and bleeding out,\u201d Appellant covered him with a quilt and\n\ndragged him to the closet. Id.\n\n      Given these facts, we agree with the PCRA court\u2019s conclusion that the\n\nevidence at trial did not reasonably support a voluntary manslaughter charge.\n\nSee Soltis, 687 A.2d at 1141. Even when viewed in the context of the alleged\n\nargument, the Victim\u2019s act of picking up scissors would not cause a reasonable\n\n                                     -9-\n\fJ-S67027-18\n\n\n\nperson to become impassioned to the point where he is incapable of cool\n\nreflection and compelled to commit murder. Moreover, the evidence did not\n\nestablish that Appellant was under a sudden and intense passion that rendered\n\nhim incapable of reason.          See Busanet, 54 A.3d at 55.      As indicated\n\npreviously, Appellant\u2019s own statement reflected his reasoned thought process\n\nat the time of the killing.       Therefore, the PCRA court correctly found that\n\nAppellant\u2019s underlying claim was meritless1 and that direct appeal counsel was\n\nnot ineffective for failing to raise the issue on appeal. See Loner, 836 A.2d\n\nat 132; see also Daniels 963 A.2d at 419.\n\n       In his second issue, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective\n\nfor failing to file a post-sentence motion preserving his weight of the evidence\n\nclaim. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 13. Appellant contends that the \u201cweight of the\n\nevidence does not support a conviction for first-degree [m]urder because the\n\nact was not premeditated or proven not to be impulsive.\u201d             Id. at 16.\n\nSpecifically, he argues that the evidence demonstrates that \u201cAppellant and\n\n[the Victim] had been doing drugs, there was an escalating verbal and physical\n\naltercation, and [the Victim] picked up scissors during the altercation.\n\nAppellant then immediately picked up a knife and started stabbing [the\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1 To the extent that Appellant argues that the jury was entitled to determine\nwhether or not the facts supported a voluntary manslaughter conviction, we\ndisagree. As noted above, this Court has held that where evidence does not\nsupport a finding of manslaughter, the court is not required to submit the\nissue to the jury. See Commonwealth v. Carr, 580 A.2d 1362, 1365 (Pa.\nSuper. 1990).\n\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\fJ-S67027-18\n\n\n\nVictim].\u201d Id. at 16. Appellant contends that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s\n\nfailure to challenge the weight of the evidence \u201cbecause his conviction is\n\nextremely questionable given the domestic history, mutual antagonism, drug\n\nconsumption, apparent impulsiveness, and so forth.\u201d Id. at 17.\n\n      \u201cOne of the least assailable reasons for granting or denying a new trial\n\nis the lower court\u2019s conviction that the verdict was or was not against the\n\nweight of the evidence and that a new trial should be granted in the interest\n\nof justice.\u201d Commonwealth v. Clay, 64 A.3d 1049, 1055 (Pa. 2013) (citation\n\nomitted). \u201cA true weight of the evidence challenge concedes that sufficient\n\nevidence exists to sustain the verdict but questions which evidence is to be\n\nbelieved.\u201d   Commonwealth v. Charlton, 902 A.2d 554, 561 (Pa. Super.\n\n2006) (citation omitted). Weight of the evidence claims \u201c[are] addressed to\n\nthe discretion of the trial court.\u201d Commonwealth v. Galvin, 985 A.2d 783,\n\n793 (Pa. 2009) (citation omitted).\n\n      Our Supreme Court has explained that\n\n      [t]he weight of the evidence is exclusively for the finder of fact\n      who is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence and to\n      determine the credibility of the witnesses. An appellate court\n      cannot substitute its judgment for that of the finder of fact. Thus,\n      we may only reverse the . . . verdict if it is so contrary to the\n      evidence as to shock one\u2019s sense of justice.\n\nCommonwealth v. Small, 741 A.2d 666, 672 (Pa. 1999) (citation omitted).\n\n      Moreover, \u201cwhere the trial court has ruled on the weight claim below,\n\nan appellate court\u2019s role is not to consider the underlying question of whether\n\nthe verdict is against the weight of the evidence.\u201d       Commonwealth v.\n\n                                     - 11 -\n\fJ-S67027-18\n\n\n\nChampney, 832 A.2d 403, 408 (Pa. 2003).                 Instead, \u201cappellate review is\n\nlimited to whether the trial court palpably abused its discretion in ruling on\n\nthe weight claim.\u201d Id.\n\n        Appellant correctly asserts that counsel failed to preserve his weight\n\nclaim for appellate review.2 However, as noted by the PCRA court, the trial\n\ncourt addressed the merits of the issue in its 1925(a) opinion and concluded\n\nthat the verdict did not \u201cshock the conscience.\u201d See Trial Ct. Op., 12/20/13,\n\nat 9.\n\n        Based on our review of the record, we agree with the PCRA court that\n\nAppellant\u2019s underlying weight of the evidence claim was meritless. The jury,\n\nas fact finder, was free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence presented\n\nat trial.   Small, 741 A.2d at 672.            The jury concluded that the portion of\n\nAppellant\u2019s statement relating to drug use and his argument with the Victim\n\nwere outweighed by the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence that Appellant acted with\n\nintent when he killed the Victim.          The trial court appropriately considered\n\nAppellant\u2019s weight of the evidence challenge, and we find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in the trial court\u2019s assessment. See Champney, 832 A.2d at 408.\n\nAccordingly, because Appellant\u2019s underlying claim lacked merit, counsel was\n\nnot ineffective for failing to preserve it. See Loner, 836 A.2d at 132; see\n\nalso Daniels, 963 A.2d at 419.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2 On direct appeal, this Court concluded that Appellant waived his challenge\nto the weight of the evidence due to counsel\u2019s failure to preserve the issue in\na post-sentence motion. See Smallwood, 2231 EDA 2013.\n\n                                          - 12 -\n\fJ-S67027-18\n\n\n\n     Finally, given our disposition of Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claims, we\n\nconclude that the PCRA court did not err in declining to hold an evidentiary\n\nhearing. See Smith, 121 A.3d at 1052.\n\n     Order affirmed.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D. Seletyn, Esq.\nProthonotary\n\n\n\nDate: 1/17/19\n\n\n\n\n                                   - 13 -\n\f",
