Lucey, State Appellate Defender, and Shellie L. Knipfer, Assistant\n\nAppellate Defender, for appellant.\n\n      Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, and Darrel Mullins, Assistant Attorney\n\nGeneral, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n      Heard by Bower, C.J., and Doyle and Schumacher, JJ.\n\f                                          2\n\n\nBOWER, Chief Judge.\n\n       Vance Archilee Good appeals from his conviction for first-degree murder,\n\ncontending there is insufficient evidence of robbery, malice aforethought, or\n\npremeditation to support the conviction. He also asserts the court abused its\n\ndiscretion in allowing a photograph of one of his tattoos to be viewed by the jury.\n\nFinally, he maintains the court erred in allowing \u201cbackdoor hearsay.\u201d Because\n\nthere is substantial evidence to support the conviction, the trial court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in admitting the photograph, and we are not persuaded that the so-\n\ncalled backdoor hearsay \u201cundermined Good\u2019s sole defense of self-defense\u201d and\n\ndenied him a fair trial, we affirm.\n\nI. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n       The afternoon of March 21, 2018, Lee Johnson arrived by taxi at a homeless\n\nshelter \u201cflashing a lot of money\u201d and talking loudly. He had been drinking. Gary\n\nComstock who worked the front desk described Johnson as a \u201clittle belligerent.\u201d\n\nJohnson and another resident, James McCauley, left for a time to go to a store\n\nand were told they had to return by 8:00 p.m.\n\n       At about 11:30 p.m., shelter resident Richard \u201cChief\u201d Thompson needed to\n\nuse the restroom. McCauley\u2014also known as \u201cStretch\u201d\u2014would not let him enter\n\nthe men\u2019s restroom. Thompson insisted. Thompson passed by Good at the\n\nrestroom entrance to see Johnson standing by the smaller of two urinals, Cody\n\nVarnes standing at the sinks, and Brandon Hollis standing in the back. McCauley\n\nleaned against the first bathroom stall. Thompson described the situation as\n\n\u201c[d]ead silence,\u201d \u201ctension,\u201d \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t good. It was real ominous.\u201d Johnson looked\n\n\u201cstressed.\u201d Good was standing with his chest \u201cpuffed out\u201d and showed \u201canger.\u201d\n\f                                          3\n\n\nThompson saw no weapons, and no one spoke. Thompson left the restroom and\n\nwent to his bunk. Thompson said that Varnes later ran into the dining room,\n\n\u201cfreaking out.\u201d McCauley and Good were \u201crunning around.\u201d Good was wiping off\n\nblood, and had blood on his arm.\n\n       At 11:31 p.m., motion-sensor shelter surveillance video shows Good and\n\nHollis carrying Johnson\u2019s body outside the shelter, leaving a blood trail from the\n\nmen\u2019s bathroom. Hollis is wearing a black vest and Good is wearing a long-\n\nsleeved gray shirt. The two return to the shelter. At 11:35 p.m., a shirtless Good\n\ngoes to the front desk where he told Comstock that Johnson thought he was \u201cgoing\n\nto get jumped,\u201d pulled out a razor knife and a scuffle ensued, and Good had \u201cgot\n\nthe knife away from him and killed him.\u201d Good mentioned a drug deal and stated\n\nit had been self-defense. Hollis, McCauley, and Varnes were standing nearby\n\nwhen Good was talking with Comstock. Good told Comstock he had dragged\n\nJohnson outside. Good asked Comstock to help clean up the blood. Comstock\n\ncalled 911 and reported there had been a killing and relayed Good\u2019s claim of self-\n\ndefense.\n\n       Surveillance video shows Hollis throwing something away in a trash can\n\nnear the door at 11:38 p.m. At 11:39 p.m., Good exits the building and returns a\n\nfew minutes later.\n\n       Responding officers found Good in the foyer on the north side of the\n\nbuilding. Officer Benson and Officer Michael Brown placed Good in handcuffs.\n\nGood told Officer Brown he had defended himself after Johnson pulled a knife on\n\nhim and he took the knife and killed Johnson. Good told Officer Brown \u201che didn\u2019t\n\nmean to kill the guy and that his military training had just kicked in.\u201d Good told him\n\f                                         4\n\n\n\u201cthat if someone\u2019s trying to hurt you, can you protect yourself.\u201d Officer Benson\n\nplaced Good into a police vehicle and read Good his rights. Without prompting or\n\nquestioning, Good kept repeating \u201che didn\u2019t mean to kill him\u201d and \u201chis military\n\ntraining had kicked in.\u201d Neither officer observed any wounds on Good.\n\n      Johnson\u2019s body was located lying face down in the parking lot. Johnson\u2019s\n\nface and neck were slashed deeply, and he had additional stab wounds. Police\n\nfound an empty wallet underneath his body.\n\n      Officers found a utility knife razor blade in the pool of blood in front of the\n\nwater fountain at the entrance to the restroom. They located a utility knife handle\n\n(no blade) on Good\u2019s bunk. It could accommodate the blade found in the blood.\n\nThe handle itself had no blood or fingerprints when it was later tested. Also found\n\nwere a white undershirt and a grey shirt with what appeared to be blood on them.\n\n      Officers also located a black canister of red pepper spray in a corner outside\n\nthe building. Officers found clothing in the trash can where Hollis had thrown\n\nsomething away.\n\n      Good was taken to an interview room at the police station and again read\n\nhis rights. He spoke disjointedly about not knowing what had happened, talked\n\nabout his own health, talked about how Johnson had cut himself while being\n\nrobbed, and made other rambling comments. Good told the interviewers they\n\ndragged Johnson outside because they were scared and then they went to talk\n\nwith Comstock. A bit later, Good said:\n\n      I don\u2019t hunt, I don\u2019t fish, I didn\u2019t even know the fellow. I know, I can\n      (inaudible) they do drugs, smoke weed or drink, people got that look.\n      I don\u2019t know what his problem, I don\u2019t even know the fellow. Wow.\n      The Lord would of done the same thing if doing that to him, going\n      crazy and cutting himself, man, wow, the Lord would of saved my\n\f                                          5\n\n\n       life, probably done the same thing, was so quick. Wow. Sorry\n       mother, was an accident, I don\u2019t know what went on. He was\n       swinging the blade around, trying to cut me and stuff. I knocked it\n       out of his hand, the dude was cutting on himself, man, I don\u2019t even\n       know who he is, I ain\u2019t no killer, mamma, (inaudible) just a petty old\n       kid that likes to take things from Walmart, get arrested and do my\n       time, I don\u2019t even drive cars any more. I walk everywhere I go. Live\n       at shelter, I don\u2019t leave the shelter much. (inaudible) young man,\n       forgive his soul Lord. This blood stinks. Wow. My hand got blood\n       on it, it stinks.\n\n       Hollis was later transported to the police station. Officer Brown noticed\n\nHollis had blood on his vest, which was seized.\n\n       An autopsy revealed Johnson had sustained twelve \u201csharp force injuries,\u201d a\n\ncombination of incised and stab wounds.1          Four were deep incised wounds\n\nsevering Johnson\u2019s windpipe, jugular veins, and carotid artery. There were incised\n\nwounds to his right upper eyelid, nose, and right cheek. There was a stab wound\n\nto the back of his neck. Two stab wounds to the chest, several inches deep,\n\npenetrated the lungs, heart, and pulmonary artery. There was one stab wound to\n\nthe abdomen and one to the left thigh. The medical examiner did not think the stab\n\ninjuries were consistent with a utility knife. They were consistent with a fish fillet\n\nknife. The wounds to the heart, and some of the wounds to the neck, were fatal.\n\nAccording to the autopsy report, Johnson\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.18.\n\n       Good was charged with first-degree murder. He filed a notice of self-\n\ndefense.\n\n\n\n\n1 The medical examiner testified an incised wound is \u201ca cut; and the definition of\nthat is if a knife\u2014or to cut across the skin, and the length of the wound is greater\nthan the depth of the wound.\u201d A stab wound \u201cis if the tip of the knife went into the\nbody so the depth of the wound is greater than the width of wound.\u201d\n\f                                         6\n\n\n       At trial, a waitress who had served Johnson in the afternoon, testified that\n\nJohnson came to her place of business and ordered a fish dinner and a beer. As\n\nshe spoke with him, she thought he might have been intoxicated so she served\n\nhim only one beer with his meal. She stated his meal was less than twenty dollars\n\nand he tried to give her a $100 tip, which she refused. She called a cab for him\n\nand gave them the address of the homeless shelter.\n\n       Comstock testified about his interactions with Johnson and the events of\n\nthat evening. Like Comstock, Roger Bearfield testified Johnson was \u201cflashing a lot\n\nof money\u201d when he arrived at the shelter. He stated Good was there when\n\nJohnson was showing his money.\n\n       Varnes testified as part of a plea agreement.2 In exchange for truthful\n\ntestimony against Good, Varnes would face a charge of first-degree robbery, which\n\ncarries a 17.5-year mandatory minimum prison term. If he then testified truthfully\n\nagainst McCauley, the charge would be further reduced to second-degree robbery,\n\nwhich carries a seven-year mandatory minimum. Varnes testified he had twice\n\ndenied involvement in the attack on Johnson to police. But the third time he spoke\n\nto police, he chose to tell the truth.\n\n       Varnes testified Good approached him, claiming Johnson owed his family\n\nmoney. Good claimed Johnson had methamphetamine and money and \u201cwe were\n\ngoing to take it from him.\u201d Varnes agreed to help for a \u201clittle bit of the meth.\u201d The\n\nplan was for Varnes to get Johnson to the restroom \u201cand tell him that a buy was\n\nready to be made.\u201d Then, Varnes would go get McCauley, who was to \u201cplay[] the\n\n\n2 On cross-examination, Varnes acknowledged that in deposition he stated he was\ntestifying against Good to avoid a murder trial.\n\f                                         7\n\n\npart of the person dealing.\u201d Varnes was to rush in and spray Johnson with a\n\ncanister of pepper spray provided to him by Good. Good would follow. Varnes\n\ntestified he did not know Hollis was involved until after he entered the restroom\n\nand sprayed Johnson in the eyes with pepper spray.\n\n       Varnes testified Johnson tried to escape when Varnes sprayed him. Hollis\n\ntried to keep Johnson in the restroom. Good pushed Varnes out of the way. As\n\nJohnson struggled past, Varnes saw where Good had slashed Johnson\u2019s throat.\n\nHollis attempted to push Johnson back into the restroom as Varnes pulled him\n\nback by the shirt. \u201cAnd at that time, [Good] comes up to the side of [Johnson] and\n\njust starts stabbing him.\u201d Varnes stated Good was using a \u201cfish fillet knife\u201d\u2014\n\n\u201c[o]range handle, long skinny blade, sharp.\u201d Varnes testified he heard Good\n\nrepeatedly say, \u201cYou\u2019re going to die, n*****. You\u2019re going to die.\u201d Then Hollis lost\n\nhis footing, and Johnson \u201csmashes into part of the wall and then drops to the floor\n\nright outside some drinking fountains.\u201d Varnes stated Hollis held Johnson down\n\nuntil he \u201cbled out.\u201d\n\n       Varnes testified he and McCauley kept others from coming into the area.\n\nGood later handed them Johnson\u2019s wallet and \u201cwe went through it,\u201d finding \u201cmoney,\n\nhis identification cards, a few credit cards.\u201d Varnes stated Good took the money.\n\n\u201cAnd then somewhere along the lines we ended up with a bag of meth. I can\u2019t\n\nremember if it came out of the wallet or if it came from [Good].\u201d At that point,\n\nVarnes said Good and Hollis carried Johnson\u2019s body out and \u201cme and [McCauley]\n\nare trying to get rid of all the evidence of us doing the crime as best as we could,\u201d\n\nsuch as the knife, the identification, the pepper spray. Varnes testified McCauley\n\n\u201ctried to chuck [the pepper spray] onto the roof,\u201d \u201c[a]nd it hit the very edge of the\n\f                                          8\n\n\nroof and came right back, but we didn\u2019t go and grab it.\u201d When asked what\n\nhappened to the knife, Varnes testified Good gave it to him and he first threw it into\n\nthe restroom trash can. When Good and Hollis returned, Varnes asked what to do\n\nabout the blood on the floor. Good said he would get a mop from the desk\n\nattendant. Varnes followed behind and said nothing when Good said he had \u201ckilled\n\na guy\u201d in self-defense. Varnes remembers having the knife again, wiping his prints\n\nfrom it, giving it to McCauley, who \u201ctook it into the dining area, and he handed it to\n\nsomebody else.\u201d Varnes then tried to appear as though he had nothing to do with\n\nthe event. Varnes testified he left the shelter ten to twenty minutes after the police\n\narrived, leaving a note with his \u201cname and number and explaining why [he] had\n\nleft\u201d before leaving the city.\n\n       The defense cross-examined Varnes vigorously, highlighting the number of\n\nstatements Varnes had given to police and several inconsistences in his\n\nstatements.\n\n       Officers Brown and Benson testified.        Detective Amber Kennedy also\n\ntestified she had interviewed Hollis at the scene on March 21, believing he was a\n\nwitness to a homicide. After interviewing Hollis at the station, Detective Kennedy\n\nviewed the shelter\u2019s surveillance footage, which led to her re-interviewing Hollis.\n\nThe following exchange then occurred:\n\n              Q. Don\u2019t tell me, but I presume he gave you some more\n       information? A. Yes, he did.\n              Q. As a result of the information that he gave you, were there\n       any\u2014\n              [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I would object to the\u2014\n       on this line of questioning to\u2014It\u2019s getting in what is implied hearsay.\n              ....\n              Q. Based on the information you then received from Mr. Hollis,\n       did you make any charging decisions with regard to Mr. Hollis?\n\f                                           9\n\n\n                [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I would just object again\n         as implying that something was said in those comments that led her\n         to do an act. So I would say that\u2019s implied hearsay there, Your\n         Honor.\n                [PROSECUTOR]: May I respond, Your Honor?\n                THE COURT: You may.\n                [PROSECUTOR]: If it is hearsay, then it\u2019s effect on the hearer\n         not for the truth of any matter asserted as to why she\u2019s taking the\n         action she\u2019s about to take.\n                THE COURT: The objection\u2019s overruled. The witness may\n         answer.\n                A. Yes. I did charge Mr. Hollis.\n                Q. What did you charge him with? A. He was charged with\n         accessory of\u2014accessory to a felony.\n\n         Additional law enforcement officers testified, as did the medical examiner.\n\n         The defense objected to the admission of a picture of Good taken at the\n\npolice station in which he is shirtless. The trial court made the following record\n\nlater:\n\n         The court had asked to see Exhibit 30A that\u2014[defense counsel]\n         objected to the admission of that photograph. The picture depicted\n         the defendant, Mr. Good, standing as viewed while in custody during\n         the investigation. Mr. Good did not have a shirt on, and certain\n         tattoos on his chest were visible. The court called the side bar to\n         confirm the reasons for the defendant\u2019s objection. [Defense counsel]\n         pointed out to the court a tattoo in the form of a swastika that was on\n         the defendant\u2019s chest and argued that the tattoo is unfairly\n         prejudicial. [Counsel] for the State argued the purpose of the exhibit\n         was to show that Mr. Good had no injuries.\n                 The court overruled the objection, and Exhibit 30A was\n         received along with the other photographs taken at the time of the\n         defendant, Vance Good.\n                 ....\n                 THE COURT: The court overruled the objection to Exhibit\n         30A, [which] was received along with the other pictures taken at the\n         time of the defendant, Vance Good. The swastika tattoo was rather\n         small; and when published during the trial on a screen across the\n         room from a jury, it would not have been noticeable. By holding the\n         side bar, no attention was drawn to the tattoo. And even if the jury\n         is to review the exhibit during deliberation, the court rules that the\n         exhibit is not unduly prejudicial.\n\f                                        10\n\n\n      Ryan Petrucelli of the Iowa Department of Public Safety Criminalistics\n\nLaboratory testified concerning DNA findings from various items submitted by law\n\nenforcement. He testified Holllis\u2019s black vest indicated the presence of blood,\n\nwhich was a mixture of Hollis and Johnson. The razor blade found in the pool of\n\nblood had Johnson\u2019s DNA. The razor holder seized from Good\u2019s bed did not\n\nindicate blood on the blade insert area and Good was the major contributor of DNA\n\nin that area. Two areas sampled on a pair of gray pants found inside the trash can\n\nhad a mixture of DNA profiles, but the major contributor was Johnson. Petrucelli\n\ntestified about the testing of a green shirt taken from Good\u2019s bunk:\n\n      Screening test indicated the presence of blood on four areas on the\n      green T-shirt. Two areas were sampled for DNA. The DNA profile\n      developed from the sample of the middle left area near the waist\n      indicated a mixture of two individuals. The profile of the major\n      contributor matched the known DNA profile of Lee Johnson.\n\nGood\u2019s tennis shoes also indicated the presence of blood and the DNA profile of\n\nthat blood matched Johnson\u2019s profile. The test of a swab of blood from Good\u2019s\n\narm indicated the blood was Johnson\u2019s.\n\n      The defense moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing the State had failed\n\nto present evidence of a robbery, malice aforethought, or premeditation. The\n\nmotion was overruled.\n\n      Richard Rapp testified for the defense that he was a resident at the shelter\n\nthe night of March 21. He stated he heard a thud and then saw Good, who looked\n\n\u201cshooken up,\u201d \u201cworried,\u201d and \u201cscared.\u201d Rapp testified,\n\n      [Good] told me that the black guy had a knife and had shoved him,\n      shoved him against the wall. Vance said that he grabbed the knife\n      out of his hand and shoved the black guy back. And as he shoved\n      him back, he accidentally got him in the neck. And he was really\n\f                                          11\n\n\n         shooken up that, you know\u2014He said that he was going to jail for, you\n         know\u2014\n                Q. Let me stop you there, Mr. Rapp. So after you talked to\n         Vance Good, did he run off to talk to Gary? A. He ran off. I didn\u2019t\n         know if he was going to talk to Gary or not . . . .\n\nThe defense then played the entire surveillance video for the jury and rested.3\n\n         The jury found Good guilty of first-degree murder.\n\n         On appeal, Good contends there is insufficient evidence of robbery (related\n\nto the felony-murder alternative), malice aforethought, or premeditation to support\n\nthe first-degree murder conviction.       He also asserts the court erred in two\n\nevidentiary rulings.\n\nII. Scope and Standard of Review.\n\n         We review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence for correction of\n\nerrors of law. State v. Howse, 875 N.W.2d 684, 688 (Iowa 2016). Evidentiary\n\nrulings are normally reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Powers v. State, 911\n\nN.W.2d 774, 780 (Iowa 2018).\n\nIII. Discussion.\n\n         A. Sufficiency of the evidence. We will not displace a jury verdict if\n\nsubstantial evidence supports it. See State v. Buenaventura, 660 N.W.2d 38, 48\n\n(Iowa 2003).       \u201cEvidence is substantial when \u2018a rational trier of fact could\n\nconceivably find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 If evidence only\n\nraises \u2018suspicion, speculation, or conjecture,\u2019 it is not substantial evidence.\u201d\n\nHowse, 875 N.W.2d at 688 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n3   Hollis had been subpoenaed to testify for the defense but failed to appear.\n\f                                          12\n\n\n       As noted, Good contends that\u2014excluding Varnes\u2019s testimony\u2014there is\n\ninsufficient evidence of robbery, malice aforethought, or premeditation to support\n\nhis conviction for first-degree murder. Good acknowledges Varnes\u2019s testimony\n\nprovides substantial evidence to support each challenged element. Consequently,\n\nGood asserts Varnes\u2019s testimony was totally lacking in credibility and the jury was\n\nrequired to believe Good killed Johnson in self-defense. We disagree.\n\n       First, we note it is not for this court \u201cto resolve conflicts in the evidence, to\n\npass upon the credibility of witnesses, to determine the plausibility of explanations,\n\nor to weigh the evidence; such matters are for the jury.\u201d State v. Musser, 721\n\nN.W.2d 758, 761 (Iowa 2006) (citation omitted); see also State v. Laffey, 600\n\nN.W.2d 57, 60 (Iowa 1999) (stating \u201ccredibility was for the jury to decide\u201d). Varnes\n\nwas vigorously cross-examined concerning his various statements to the police in\n\nwhich he initial denied any involvement.\n\n       More than one witness testified Johnson had made no small show of having\n\na large sum of cash. Thompson testified he walked into the restroom and saw\n\nGood, Johnson, Hollis, and McCauley standing silently and tensely.               Good\n\nappeared \u201cpuffed out\u201d and angry.        This described situation could support an\n\ninference that Good and the others were intending to take Johnson\u2019s money.\n\nJohnson\u2019s empty wallet was found under his body, which had been dragged\n\noutside by Good and Hollis.\n\n       Varnes testified Good intended to take Johnson\u2019s money and drugs. He\n\ntestified Good had a long-bladed fish fillet knife with him. He testified there was a\n\nconcerted effort to keep Johnson from escaping while Good repeatedly stabbed\n\f                                          13\n\n\nhim in the neck and side. This testimony is sufficient to establish an intent to rob\n\nJohnson, malice aforethought, and premeditation.\n\n       Iowa cases have often recognized that \u201cthe use of a deadly weapon\n\nsupports an inference of malice, and when accompanied by an opportunity to\n\ndeliberate, also supports an inference of deliberation and premeditation.\u201d State v.\n\nReeves, 636 N.W.2d 22, 25 (Iowa 2001); accord State v. Frazer, 267 N.W.2d 34,\n\n39 (Iowa 1978) (\u201cThe use of a deadly weapon accompanied by an opportunity to\n\ndeliberate, even for a short time, is evidence of malice, deliberation, and\n\npremeditation.\u201d)). To premeditate means \u201cto think or ponder upon the matter\n\nbefore acting.\u201d Buenaventura, 660 N.W.2d at 48. \u201c[P]remeditation need not exist\n\nfor any particular length of time.\u201d Id.; see also State v. Wilkens, 346 N.W.2d 16,\n\n20 (Iowa 1984) (\u201cDeliberation and premeditation may be shown by circumstantial\n\nevidence in one of three ways: (1) evidence of planning activity of the defendant\n\nwhich was directed toward the killing; (2) evidence of motive which might be\n\ninferred from prior relationships between defendant and the victim; and (3)\n\nevidence regarding the nature of the killing.\u201d (citation omitted)).\n\n       In addition, Varnes\u2019s statements concerning seeing Good with a fish fillet\n\nknife comport with the medical examiner\u2019s findings of deep stab wounds, which\n\nwere not consistent with a utility-type blade. The number and types of injuries\n\ncontradict Good\u2019s claim that he got the utility knife away from Johnson and\n\naccidently stabbed him in the neck. The nature of the killing\u2014the multiple stab\n\nwounds into the heart and lungs and the slicing wounds across Johnson\u2019s neck\u2014\n\nprovides substantial evidence establishing Good\u2019s opportunity to premeditate and\n\ndeliberate before stabbing Johnson repeatedly. Consequently, there is substantial\n\f                                        14\n\n\nevidence to support Good\u2019s conviction under either a felony-murder or\n\npremeditated-murder alternative.\n\n       B. Photograph.     Good argues that the admission of the photograph\n\nshowing his swastika tattoo was unfairly prejudicial.4 He contends two officers\n\ntestified they did not observe injuries on Good, so the photograph was cumulative\n\nevidence and unnecessary.\n\n       The district court allowed the one photograph as relevant to show Good did\n\nnot have injuries and noted, \u201cThe swastika tattoo was rather small; and when\n\npublished during the trial on a screen across the room from a jury, it would not\n\nhave been noticeable.\u201d The court\u2019s reasoning was not \u201cclearly untenable\u201d or\n\n\u201cclearly unreasonable.\u201d   State v. Walker, 935 N.W.2d 874, 877 (Iowa 2019)\n\n(\u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court exercises its discretion \u2018on\n\ngrounds or for reasons clearly untenable or to an extent clearly unreasonable.\u2019\u201d\n\n(citation omitted)).\n\n       Good asserted he acted in self-defense when Johnson was swinging a\n\nrazor around. The photograph is the only full image of Good after the altercation.\n\nThe State was entitled to show that Good did not sustain any injuries, which seems\n\nunlikely under his version of the altercation. We, like the district court, observe\n\nthat the swastika tattoo is small and barely noticeable\u2014 especially given the\n\nnumerous tattoos Good has on his body, most of which are much larger and\n\nattention grabbing. We find no abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n4Although we acknowledge a swastika has a negative connotation, we do not\naccept Good\u2019s characterization that the tattoo is evidence of prior bad acts.\n\f                                          15\n\n\n       C. \u201cBackdoor Hearsay.\u201d Finally, Good asserts the court allowed backdoor\n\nhearsay. A \u201cbackdoor hearsay\u201d problem occurs when a \u201cquestion and answer\n\n[does] not produce hearsay \u2018in the classic or textbook sense,\u2019 [but] the questioning\n\n[is] nevertheless designed to circumvent the hearsay rule and present the jury with\n\ninformation from unsworn, out-of-court sources.\u201d State v. Huser, 894 N.W.2d 472,\n\n497 (Iowa 2017) (citation omitted). Although \u201cthe form of [a] question [does] not\n\nliterally require the jury to infer the subject matter,\u201d \u201cthe use of the \u2018don\u2019t tell me\n\nwhat [the other person] said\u2019 questioning directly after [the witness] testified about\n\nthe [communication] was designed to encourage the jury to make the connection.\u201d\n\nId.   \u201cThe State \u2018is not permitted by means of the insinuation or innuendo of\n\nincompetent and improper questions to plant in the minds of the jurors a prejudicial\n\nbelief in the existence of evidence which is otherwise not admissible and thereby\n\nprevent the defendant from having a fair trial.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting State v. Carey, 165\n\nN.W.2d 27, 32 (Iowa 1969)).\n\n       Good maintains that the question leading to Detective Kennedy\u2019s testimony\n\nthat Hollis was charged with accessory to a felony \u201cconveys to the jury that Hollis\u2019s\n\nstatements incriminated him and Good as to being co-conspirators in the death of\n\nJohnson.\u201d Even if we assume the question was improper, we conclude Good\n\nsuffered no prejudice.\n\n       There was testimony Johnson was \u201cflashing a lot of money.\u201d Thompson\n\nhad already testified Hollis was in the restroom with Johnson and others in a tense\n\nsituation. Varnes testified that he, Good, and McCauley were planning to rob\n\nJohnson. Varnes also testified Hollis pushed an escaping Johnson back into the\n\nrestroom and Good stabbed Johnson a number of times. Detective Kennedy\u2019s\n\f                                        16\n\n\ntestimony was that Hollis was first thought to be a witness only, but after viewing\n\nthe surveillance video\u2014which showed Hollis carrying Johnson\u2019s body out of the\n\nshelter\u2014Hollis was questioned again and charged with accessory to a felony.\n\nWhat felony? Murder? Robbery? Obstructing justice? The jury was not told, and\n\nwe are not persuaded that the so-called backdoor hearsay \u201cundermined Good\u2019s\n\nsole defense of self-defense\u201d and denied him a fair trial. We therefore affirm.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\f",
