In two issues, Prichard asserts his sentence cannot\n\nstand because a deadly weapon finding is appropriate only when the weapon was used or\n\nexhibited against individuals. We modify the trial court\u2019s judgment and affirm as modified.\n\n                                                          I. BACKGROUND\n\n           The facts are undisputed. Prichard\u2019s pet pit bull Candy died after Prichard repeatedly hit\n\nher on the head with a shovel until she appeared unconscious and then drowned her in the family\n   1\n       The Hon. Michael J. O'Neill, Justice, Court of Appeals, Fifth District of Texas at Dallas, Retired, sitting by assignment.\n\fswimming pool \u201cto put [her] out of [her] misery.\u201d Prichard was charged with intentionally and\n\nknowingly torturing Candy or causing her death \u201cin a cruel manner.\u201d See TEX. PENAL CODE\n\nANN. 42.092(b)(1) (West 2011). He also was charged with using the shovel and pool water,\n\n\u201csingly or in combination,\u201d as deadly weapons. See id. 1.07(17) (West Supp. 2015).\n\n                                              II. DEADLY WEAPON FINDING\n\n           Prichard asserts a deadly weapon finding is appropriate only when the weapon was used\n\nor exhibited against individuals. Accordingly, he complains the trial court erred in submitting a\n\ndeadly weapon special issue to the jury and the evidence is insufficient to support the deadly\n\nweapon finding.2 Although he couches the latter complaint as a sufficiency challenge, his\n\ncomplaint turns on statutory construction. See Patterson v. State, 769 S.W.2d 938, 940 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1989).\n\n                                                             A. Applicable Law\n\n           A trial court must give the jury a written charge that sets forth the law applicable to the\n\ncase based on the facts adduced at trial. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 36.14 (West 2007);\n\nsee also Gray v. State, 152 S.W.3d 125, 127-28 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). A charge which fails to\n\napply the law to the facts presented at trial is erroneous. Gray, 152 S.W.3d. at 128.\n\n           As applicable to the facts presented in this case, a deadly weapon is \u201canything that in the\n\nmanner of its use or intended use is capable of causing death or serious bodily injury.\u201d See TEX.\n\nPENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 1.07(17)(B). \u201cUse,\u201d as construed by the court of criminal appeals, means\n\nthe employment of the weapon to achieve its purpose or to facilitate the associated offense. See\n\nPatterson, 769 S.W.2d at 941.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n        The State asserts, in part, that Prichard failed to preserve error because he did not file a motion to quash the indictment or otherwise object\nto the indictment\u2019s deadly weapon allegation. However, Prichard\u2019s complaints attack the legality of his six-and-a-half year sentence, an issue that\ndoes not need to be preserved in the trial court. See Mizell v. State, 119 S.W.3d 804, 806 n.6 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).\n\n\n\n                                                                        \u20132\u2013\n\f       Under Texas Penal Code section 42.092(c), the offense of cruelty to nonlivestock animals\n\ncommitted by torturing an animal or by killing or causing serious bodily injury to the animal \u201cin\n\na cruel manner\u201d is a state jail felony unless the defendant has twice been previously convicted of\n\nanimal cruelty, in which case the offense is a third degree felony. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7\n\n42.092(c). State jail felonies are punishable, in accordance with section 12.35 of the penal code,\n\nby confinement in a state jail for any term between 180 days and two years. See id. \u00a7 12.35(a)\n\n(West Supp. 2015). However, upon a deadly weapon finding, as in this case, punishment is\n\nincreased in accordance with section 12.35(c) to that of a third degree felony.         See id. \u00a7\n\n12.35(c)(1). Third degree felonies are punishable by imprisonment in the Texas Department of\n\nCriminal Justice for a term between two years and ten years. See id. \u00a7 12.34(a) (West 2011). In\n\naddition to confinement and imprisonment, state jail felonies and third degree felonies may also\n\nbe punished by a fine not to exceed $10,000. See id. \u00a7 12.34(b), 12.35(b)\n\n                                     B. Standard of Review\n\n       When a sufficiency of the evidence issue turns on statutory construction, an appellate\n\ncourt reviews the issue de novo. See Liverman v. State, 470 S.W.3d 831, 836 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2015). An appellate court reviews jury charge error based on whether error was preserved. See\n\nKirsch v. State, 357 S.W.3d 645, 649 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012). \u201cObjected-to-error\u201d is reviewed\n\nfor \u201csome harm,\u201d while \u201cunobjected-to-error\u201d is reviewed for \u201cegregious harm.\u201d Jennings v.\n\nState, 302 S.W.3d 306, 311 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n\n                                 C. Application of Law to Facts\n\n       Prichard argues a deadly weapon finding is appropriate only when the weapon was used\n\nor exhibited against individuals. However, he does not contest that he used the shovel and pool\n\nwater to cause Candy\u2019s death. Instead, he relies on (1) \u201cseveral court cases that . . . have used\n\nlanguage indicating that the term [deadly weapon] refers to people;\u201d and (2) that portion of penal\n\n                                               \u20133\u2013\n\fcode section 42.092(c) making the offense of cruelty to nonlivestock animals a third degree\n\nfelony where the defendant has prior animal cruelty convictions.\n\n       Respecting section 42.092(c), Prichard asserts that if the deadly weapon provision under\n\npenal code section 12.35 is applicable to animals, a cruelty to nonlivestock animal offense\n\n\u201cwould always be subject to an affirmative finding of a deadly weapon.\u201d He asserts that would\n\n\u201celevate this state jail felony to a third degree felony\u201d and render superfluous that portion of\n\nsection 42.092 that \u201cenhances\u201d the offense to a third degree felony based on prior animal cruelty\n\nconvictions. Prichard\u2019s assertion assumes all cruelty to nonlivestock animal cases implicate the\n\ndeadly weapon provision under section 12.35. However, the offense can be committed by an\n\nomission. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 42.092(b)(3) (unreasonable failure to provide necessary\n\nfood, water, care, or shelter), (4) (unreasonable abandonment). Moreover, section 12.35 and\n\nsection 42.092(c) serve different purposes. Section 42.092(c) defines the offense and classifies it\n\nas a state jail felony or, if the defendant has two prior animal cruelty convictions, a third degree\n\nfelony. See id. \u00a7 42.092(c); Chambless v. State, 411 S.W.3d 498, 501 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).\n\nSection 12.35, on the other hand, defines the offense\u2019s punishment range. See TEX. PENAL CODE\n\nANN. \u00a7 12.35; Chambless, 411 S.W.3d at 501. Although section 12.35 allows for the punishment\n\nof a state jail felony to be increased to that of a third degree felony, it does not change the\n\nclassification or level of the offense to a third degree felony.   See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7\n\n12.35; Chambless, 411 S.W.3d at 502. Because the deadly weapon provision at issue here\n\nincreases punishment, it has no effect on section 42.092(c) which increases the level of the\n\noffense. We reject Prichard\u2019s argument to the contrary.\n\n       We also reject Prichard\u2019s argument that \u201cseveral court cases\u201d suggest \u201cthe term [deadly\n\nweapon] refers to people.\u201d Prichard cites specifically to Cates v. State, 102 S.W.3d 735 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2003) and Brister v. State, 449 S.W.3d 490 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014). Cates is an\n\n                                                \u20134\u2013\n\fappeal from a conviction for failing to stop and render aid. Cates, 102 S.W.3d at 736. Brister is\n\nan appeal from a conviction for driving while intoxicated. Brister, 449 S.W.3d at 491.    In both\n\ncases, the appellants were found at trial to have used their vehicles as deadly weapons during the\n\ncommission of the offenses. Brister, 449 S.W.3d at 491; Cates, 102 S.W.3d at 737. In both\n\ncases, the court of criminal appeals found that the vehicles were not used as deadly weapons\n\nbecause no evidence was presented showing \u201canyone\u201d or \u201cothers\u201d were actually endangered by\n\nthe vehicles. Brister, 449 S.W.3d at 495; Cates, 102 S.W.2d at 738. Prichard asserts the Brister\n\nand Cates courts\u2019 use of the term \u201canyone\u201d and \u201cothers\u201d indicates a deadly weapon finding can\n\nonly apply to offenses involving individuals. Prichard\u2019s reliance on these cases, however, is\n\nmisplaced as neither construed \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d to apply to individuals to the exclusion of\n\nanimals. The question in those cases was not whether the offense was an offense against\n\npersons. Rather, the question was whether the weapons, the appellants\u2019 vehicles, were used to\n\nfacilitate the commission of the offense for which the appellants were charged.          Although\n\nPrichard contends a weapon is not a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d under the penal code unless it is used or\n\nexhibited against individuals, the court of criminal appeals has not limited the term as he\n\nproposes. The pertinent inquiry with respect to whether a deadly weapon was used, the issue\n\nhere, is whether the weapon achieved or facilitated the intended result. See Patterson, 769\n\nS.W.2d at 941.\n\n       As stated, Prichard does not dispute his use of the shovel and pool water caused Candy\u2019s\n\ndeath as he intended. On the record before us, we conclude the trial court properly submitted a\n\ndeadly weapon special issue to the jury and the evidence was sufficient to support the deadly\n\nweapon finding.     See id. at 942 (affirming judgment for conviction for possession of\n\nmethamphetamine with deadly weapon finding where rational trier of fact could have determined\n\ngun and several rounds of ammunition found near appellant and methamphetamine were used in\n\n                                               \u20135\u2013\n\fcommission of offense by protecting and facilitating appellant\u2019s \u201ccare, custody, and management\n\nof the contraband\u201d); see also Martin v. State, No. 05-14-00215-CR, 2015 WL 4476242, *5 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Dallas 2015, no pet.) (noting \u201c[n]othing in the plain language of section 1.07 [defining\n\n\u201cdeadly weapon\u201d] limits the definition of a deadly weapon to offenses against human beings\u201d\n\nand rejecting appellant\u2019s argument that dog can never be used as deadly weapon against another\n\ndog in dogfighting case) (not designated for publication); McMillian v. State, No. 05-04-01321-\n\nCR, 2005 WL 2901720, *3 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2005, no pet.) (trial court properly entered\n\ndeadly weapon finding where evidence showed appellant used dog to cause serious injury or\n\ndeath to another dog) (not designated for publication). We decide Prichard\u2019s two issues against\n\nhim.\n\n                            III. MODIFICATION OF JUDGMENT\n\n       Prichard\u2019s judgment recites he was convicted of \u201ccruelty to animals enhanced . . . a third\n\ndegree felony.\u201d With respect to the sections \u201cPlea to 1st Enhancement Paragraph\u201d and \u201cFindings\n\non 1st Enhancement Paragraph,\u201d the judgment states \u201cN/A\u201d for each. Because Prichard entered\n\na plea of not guilty to the indictment, we modify the judgment to reflect a plea to the first\n\nenhancement paragraph of \u201cNot True.\u201d See Wood v. State, No. PD-0061-15, 2016 WL 1359169,\n\n*4 (Tex. Crim. App. Apr. 6, 2016); Bigley v. State, 865 S.W.2d 26, 27-28 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1993); Asberry v. State, 813 S.W.2d 526, 529-30 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 1991, pet. ref\u2019d). Further,\n\nbecause the deadly weapon allegation in the indictment and the deadly weapon finding by the\n\njury served to increase punishment and not the level of the offense, we modify the judgment to\n\nreflect Prichard was convicted of \u201ccruelty to nonlivestock animals . . . a state jail felony\u201d and to\n\nreflect a finding on the first enhancement paragraph of \u201cTrue.\u201d See TEX.
