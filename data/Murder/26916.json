HEADEN, J.:\n\n                   Defendant-appellant Quantrail Johnson (\u201cJohnson\u201d) appeals his\n\nconviction following a bench trial. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\fProcedural and Substantive History\n\n              This case stems from a shooting that occurred on April 15, 2018. That\n\nday, Jason Gain (\u201cGain\u201d) and his girlfriend Monalisa McCoy (\u201cMcCoy\u201d) went to\n\nMcCoy\u2019s father\u2019s house on Nevada Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio, to do laundry. Gain\n\nhad been staying at this house before he moved in with McCoy, and Johnson was\n\nstaying at this house on the date of the incident. Johnson and Gain were friends,\n\nand McCoy met them both through her father.\n\n              McCoy testified that she started her laundry and then went outside\n\nand sat in her car. Johnson came outside and asked her if she could take him to get\n\nsome of his belongings. She told him to ask Gain if it was all right for her to do so.\n\nJohnson went back inside the house and, shortly thereafter, returned to McCoy\u2019s car\n\nand got in on the passenger side. McCoy began to drive away and called Gain.\n\nHearing that Gain was upset, McCoy turned around and went back to her father\u2019s\n\nhouse. McCoy and Johnson went back inside the house, and Johnson began arguing\n\nwith Gain. Gain went outside to his truck, and Johnson followed him outside to\n\ncontinue the argument. Several minutes later, Johnson came back inside. At this\n\npoint, McCoy had called her father to come home because Gain and Johnson\u2019s\n\nargument was escalating and she was nervous about what might happen. McCoy\n\ntestified that she witnessed Johnson retrieve a shotgun from inside the house, load\n\nthe gun, and go back outside. McCoy went to the bathroom, called her father again,\n\nand then heard a gunshot and proceeded to call 911. McCoy then went outside,\n\fwhere she observed Johnson standing over Gain, who had been shot and was tying\n\na pair of pants around his leg to stop the bleeding.\n\n               Gain testified that he had gone out to his truck to drink a Mike\u2019s Hard\n\nLemonade and Johnson approached him and pointed a shotgun in his face. Gain\n\ntestified that he tried to grab the gun and then was shot in his leg. Gain testified that\n\nJohnson helped him tie up his leg and that McCoy drove Gain to the hospital. At the\n\nhospital, police interviewed Gain and McCoy. Both stated in their initial interviews\n\nthat they did not know the identity of the person who shot Gain. At trial, Gain\n\ntestified that he had been reluctant to tell police that his friend had shot him. McCoy\n\ntestified that Gain told her not to identify Johnson to the police. Both identified\n\nJohnson as the shooter at trial.\n\n               Johnson was arrested on May 15, 2018. On May 22, 2018, the\n\nCuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted Johnson on one count of felonious assault in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), one count of felonious assault in violation of\n\nR.C. 2903.11(A)(1), one count of discharge of a firearm on or near prohibited\n\npremises in violation of R.C. 2923.162(A)(3), and one count of having weapons while\n\nunder disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(2). The first three counts carried\n\none- and three-year firearm specifications. Johnson was appointed counsel, and\n\npretrial hearings were held on May 31, 2018; June 11, 2018; July 2, 2018;\n\nJuly 19, 2018; July 26, 2018; and August 2, 2018. At each of these hearings, defense\n\ncounsel requested a continuance for discovery and ongoing negotiations, and the\n\ntrial court granted each continuance.\n\f               On August 8, 2018, Johnson filed a pro se \u201cnotice to deny consent to\n\nany continuances \u2018at the request of the defendant\u2019\u201d and a motion to dismiss. On\n\nAugust 29, 2018, the trial court overruled Johnson\u2019s pro se motion to dismiss. On\n\nSeptember 27, 2018, Johnson waived his right to a jury trial and the case proceeded\n\nto a bench trial. On September 28, 2018, the court found Johnson guilty of both\n\ncounts of felonious assault with one- and three-year firearm specifications, and one\n\ncount of having weapons while under disability. The court found Johnson not guilty\n\nof discharge of a firearm on or near prohibited premises.\n\n               On October 29, 2018, the court held a sentencing hearing. Both\n\ncounts of felonious assault were merged for sentencing, and the court imposed a\n\nsentence of three years for felonious assault, to be served consecutively to three years\n\nfor the firearm specifications and concurrently to one year for having weapons while\n\nunder disability, for an aggregate prison term of six years.\n\n               Johnson now appeals, presenting six assignments of error for our\n\nreview.\n\nLaw and Analysis\n\nI. Manifest Weight\n\n               In his first assignment of error, Johnson argues that his convictions\n\nwere against the manifest weight of the evidence. Specifically, Johnson challenges\n\nthe credibility of both eyewitnesses and emphasizes that only one witness, the\n\nvictim, actually saw the shooter.\n\f               Unlike a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence, a manifest-weight\n\nchallenge attacks the quality of the evidence and questions whether the state met its\n\nburden of persuasion at trial. State v. Hill, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99819, 2014-\n\nOhio-387, \u00b6 25, citing State v. Bowden, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 92266, 2009-Ohio-\n\n3598, \u00b6 13. When reviewing a manifest weight challenge, a court reviews the entire\n\nrecord, weighing all evidence and reasonable inferences and considering the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses, to determine whether the trier of fact clearly lost its way\n\nand created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be\n\nreversed. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d, 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997).\n\n               In asserting that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the\n\nevidence, Johnson argues that the police investigation in the case was lacking and\n\nthat the eyewitness testimony was not credible. With respect to the investigation,\n\nany allegations of inadequate police work have no bearing on whether Johnson\u2019s\n\nconviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. A manifest weight\n\nchallenge looks at the quality of the evidence that the state presented at trial. A\n\nconsideration of evidence that was not presented against Johnson at trial, regardless\n\nof why it was not presented, is irrelevant to our review of this assignment of error.\n\n               With respect to the testimony from McCoy and Gain, Johnson\n\nemphasizes minor inconsistences in their testimony. While we acknowledge the\n\ninconsistencies in their testimony, a thorough review of the record reveals that as to\n\nthe critical questions in this case, the witnesses provided consistent and generally\n\ncredible testimony. McCoy testified that she saw Johnson load a gun and go outside,\n\fand shortly thereafter she heard a gunshot. Gain testified that Johnson shot him.\n\nAdditionally, no evidence was presented at trial to suggest that anyone other than\n\nJohnson shot Gain. We do not find that any of the alleged inconsistencies in the\n\nwitness testimony significantly undermined the witnesses\u2019 credibility so as to have\n\ncreated a manifest miscarriage of justice. In light of the foregoing, we do not find\n\nthat Johnson\u2019s convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nJohnson\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\nII. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n              In Johnson\u2019s second assignment of error, he argues that certain\n\nstatements the prosecutor made during her opening statement constituted\n\nmisconduct and violated Johnson\u2019s right to a fair trial. Johnson argues that the\n\nprosecutor mischaracterized McCoy\u2019s testimony by stating that McCoy witnessed\n\nthe shooting. He also argues that the prosecutor mischaracterized the nature of\n\nGain\u2019s injuries by referring to the gunshot as causing a fatal wound. In her opening\n\nstatement, the prosecutor summarized the incident and investigation as follows:\n\n      [T]he Court will hear from Jason Gain as well as other witnesses to this\n      matter that [on] or about April 15th, 2018, he was shot in his leg by the\n      defendant, Quantrail Johnson. It was witnessed by his girlfriend,\n      Monalisa McCoy. And he bled out.\n\n      Bled out. And he was driven to the hospital by his girlfriend, Monalisa\n      McCoy. He had to undergo very severe surgery. Currently, had to have\n      plates installed in his leg for this.\n\n      And that victim, Jason Gain, did meet with the officers. He\u2019s been\n      cooperative through this whole process. Even provided detectives\n      photographs of the defendant and named him as the person who\n      administered that fatal wound.\n\fJohnson argues that these mischaracterizations were intentional and inflammatory.\n\nWith respect to the description of the injury, Johnson argues that the only\n\ninterpretation of the prosecutor\u2019s words is that death was caused by the injury\n\ninflicted.\n\n               In order to find prosecutorial misconduct, this court must determine\n\nthat the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper and that they prejudiced Johnson\u2019s\n\nsubstantial rights. State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14-15, 470 N.E.2d 883 (1984).\n\nDuring opening and closing statements, prosecutors are entitled to some latitude as\n\nto what the evidence will show or has shown and what inferences can be drawn.\n\nState v. Richey, 64 Ohio St.3d 353, 362, 595 N.E.2d 915 (1992). Further, the focus\n\nof our analysis is on the \u201cfairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d\n\nSmith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982).\n\n               Johnson is correct that McCoy did not witness the shooting itself.\n\nJohnson is also correct that the shooter in this case did not inflict a fatal wound on\n\nGain. We disagree that any reference to either by the prosecutor constitutes\n\nprosecutorial misconduct. Johnson characterizes the conduct in this case as \u201ca\n\ndesire to couch the matter as a murder with direct eyewitnesses.\u201d This argument is\n\nundermined by the context of both the opening statement and the trial as a whole.\n\nThe prosecutor made it clear that Gain did not die as a result of the gunshot by\n\ndescribing his injuries in detail. Further, of course, Gain\u2019s presence and testimony\n\nat trial would certainly have been sufficient to negate any attempt by the prosecutor\n\fto make his injuries seem worse than they were. In addition, it is clear from McCoy\u2019s\n\ntestimony that she did not witness the shooting itself.\n\n               Even if we were to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were\n\nimproper, Johnson has not shown how the statements had any impact on the trier\n\nof fact \u2014 in this case, the judge \u2014 let alone a prejudicial impact. Whether Gain was\n\nthe victim of a gunshot wound and the severity of his injuries were not issues to be\n\ndetermined by the trier of fact in this case. The primary issue in this case was the\n\nidentity of the shooter, and the state presented ample evidence that Johnson shot\n\nGain. Therefore, the prosecutor did not commit misconduct that denied Johnson\n\ndue process. Johnson\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\nIII. Access to the Proceedings\n\n               In Johnson\u2019s third assignment of error, he argues that he was denied\n\ndue process when the court denied him access to pretrial proceedings and granted\n\ncontinuances despite his notice to the court that he would not consent to any\n\ncontinuance.\n\n               While a defendant \u201c\u2018has a fundamental right to be present at all\n\ncritical stages of his criminal trial[,]\u2019\u201d this right is not absolute. State v. White, 82\n\nOhio St.3d 16, 26, 693 N.E.2d 772 (1998), quoting State v. Hill, 73 Ohio St.3d 433,\n\n444, 653 N.E.2d 271 (1995), and citing State v. Meade, 80 Ohio St.3d 419, 421, 687\n\nN.E.2d 278 (1997). Even if a defendant has the right to be present at a given stage,\n\nhis absence only constitutes prejudicial error where \u201ca fair and just hearing * * * [is]\n\nthwarted by his absence.\u201d Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 107-108, 54 S.Ct.\n\f330, 78 L.Ed. 674 (1934). Here, Johnson has not articulated any way in which his\n\ndue process rights were particularly impacted by his absence from pretrial hearings.\n\n              Johnson argues that because he made clear his desire to be present\n\nfor all proceedings, the trial court\u2019s failure to provide him access to pretrial\n\nproceedings is error. Johnson\u2019s desire to be present for pretrial proceedings does\n\nnot alone amount to prejudicial error. Therefore, Johnson\u2019s third assignment of\n\nerror is overruled. To the extent that Johnson also argues that his stated desire that\n\nthe trial court not grant any further continuances has somehow violated his due\n\nprocess right to be present at pretrial proceedings, we do not see his stated desire\n\nrelating to continuances alone leads to the trial court\u2019s orders violating his\n\nconstitutional or statutory rights. We will address this issue more thoroughly in the\n\nfollowing assignment of error.\n\nIV. Speedy Trial\n\n              In Johnson\u2019s fourth assignment of error, he argues that he was denied\n\nhis constitutional right to a speedy trial. Relatedly, Johnson argues that he was\n\ndenied his right to a preliminary hearing pursuant to Crim.R. 5.\n\n              Crim.R. 5(A)(4) provides:\n\n      When a defendant first appears before a judge or magistrate, the judge\n      or magistrate shall permit the accused or the accused\u2019s counsel to read\n      the complaint or a copy thereof, and shall inform the defendant:\n\n      (4) Of the right to a preliminary hearing in a felony case, when the\n      defendant\u2019s initial appearance is not pursuant to indictment.\n\fCrim.R. 5(B)(1) goes on to provide that a preliminary hearing shall be scheduled no\n\nlater than 10 days following the arrest, but that \u201c[t]he preliminary hearing shall not\n\nbe held, however, if the defendant is indicted.\u201d Here, Johnson was arrested on\n\nMay 15, 2018, and indicted on May 22, 2018. His indictment, which occurred before\n\nthe 10-day time period for holding a preliminary hearing had elapsed, negated\n\nJohnson\u2019s right to a preliminary hearing.\n\n              The Sixth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution, and Article 1, Section\n\n10 of the Ohio Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to a speedy\n\ntrial. Ohio has codified this right in R.C. 2945.71. R.C. 2945.71(C) provides that a\n\nperson facing felony charges must be brought to trial within 270 days after their\n\narrest. Where, as here, the defendant is jailed in lieu of bail awaiting trial on a\n\npending charge, each day shall be counted as three days pursuant to R.C. 2945.71(E).\n\nR.C. 2945.72 sets forth circumstances under which the statutory time period may be\n\ntolled, including a continuance at the defendant\u2019s request.\n\n              Time began to run on May 15, 2018, when Johnson was arrested.\n\nJohnson was granted continuances on May 31, 2018, June 11, 2018, July 2, 2018,\n\nJuly 19, 2018, July 26, 2018, and August 2, 2018, all of which tolled his speedy trial\n\ntime pursuant to R.C. 2945.72(E). On August 8, 2018, Johnson filed a motion to\n\ndismiss, which again tolled his speedy trial time. The court denied this motion on\n\nAugust 29, 2018, and trial began on September 27, 2018. Considering these tolling\n\nevents, 53 days elapsed between Johnson\u2019s arrest and trial.         Pursuant to the\n\nstatutory triple-counting provision, 159 days of the 270-day limit had elapsed.\n\fTherefore, Johnson was brought to trial within the statutory time period and his\n\nright to a speedy trial was not violated.\n\n               Johnson also argues that the multiple continuances allowed by the\n\ncourt \u201cat the request of the defendant\u201d were improper because Johnson expressly\n\ndeclined to consent to any continuances and attempted to assert his right to a speedy\n\ntrial through a pro se notice and motion. We disagree. \u201c\u2018A defendant\u2019s right to be\n\nbrought to trial within the time limits expressed in R.C. 2945.71 may be waived by\n\nhis counsel for reasons of trial preparation and the defendant is bound by the waiver\n\neven though the waiver is executed without his consent.\u2019\u201d State v. Shepherd, 8th\n\nDist. Cuyahoga No. 97962, 2012-Ohio-5415, \u00b6 21, quoting State v. McBreen, 54 Ohio\n\nSt.2d 315, 376 N.E.2d 593 (1978), syllabus. Further, Johnson\u2019s notice to the trial\n\ncourt that he denied consent to any continuances was filed after numerous pretrials\n\nin which his counsel had requested and received continuances for the reasonable\n\npurpose of conducting discovery and engaging in negotiations with the state of Ohio.\n\nFinally, as we laid out above, even with numerous continuances operating to toll\n\nJohnson\u2019s speedy trial time, he was brought to trial within the statutory period. For\n\nthese reasons, Johnson\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nV. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n               In his fifth assignment of error, Johnson argues that he received\n\nineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to object to statements\n\nmade during the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement and failed to move for dismissal on\n\nspeedy trial grounds.\n\f               To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must\n\ndemonstrate that (1) counsel\u2019s performance at trial was seriously flawed and\n\ndeficient and fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) there is a\n\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the\n\ntrial would have been different. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct.\n\n2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\n\nundermine confidence in the outcome. Id. at 687-688.\n\n               We have determined that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during opening\n\nstatements did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct, in part because the\n\nstatements did not prejudice Johnson. It is entirely possible that counsel had a\n\nlegitimate strategic reason for not objecting during opening statements. Even\n\nassuming arguendo that the failure to object was deficient, Johnson is unable to\n\nshow how he was prejudiced by this. Johnson has failed to show a reasonable\n\nprobability of a different outcome had his counsel objected.\n\n               Similarly, we have concluded that Johnson\u2019s right to a speedy trial\n\nwas not violated. Therefore, his argument that his counsel was ineffective for failing\n\nto move for dismissal on this ground necessarily fails. For these reasons, Johnson\u2019s\n\nfifth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nVI. Cumulative Error\n\n               In Johnson\u2019s sixth and final assignment of error, he argues that the\n\ncumulative impact of the errors in his trial amounted to a denial of due process. We\n\ndisagree.   Because none of the alleged errors prejudiced Johnson, we cannot\n\fconclude that he was prejudiced by their cumulative effect.         Johnson\u2019s sixth\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n               Judgment affirmed.\n\n      It is ordered that appellee recover from appellant costs herein taxed.\n\n      The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n      It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the\n\ncommon pleas court to carry this judgment into execution.          The defendant\u2019s\n\nconvictions having been affirmed, any bail pending is terminated. Case remanded\n\nto the trial court for execution of sentence.\n\n      A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27\n\nof the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n\n\nRAYMOND C.
