Appellant actively participated with her boyfriend in the\n\nprotracted beating death of her three-year-old son. They also beat her six\u2013\n\nyear\u2013old son, who survived. The court imposed an aggregate sentence of not\n\nless than forty-two nor more than ninety-four years of incarceration.\n\nAppellant challenges her sentence as excessive. We affirm.\n\n     The facts of this case are not in substantial dispute. Appellant\u2019s criminal\n\ncharges and open plea of guilty arose out of her joining in the beating death,\n\nover the course of three days, of her three-year-old son, and the non-fatal\n____________________________________\n* Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-S57029-18\n\n\nassault of her six-year-old son. The six-year-old son was present during the\n\nbeatings of his three-year-old brother. The children were suspended upside\n\ndown by their feet during the beatings. The murder victim was also taped to\n\nhis chair so he would not fall out from the beatings.\n\n       The acknowledged principal perpetrator was Appellant\u2019s new live-in\n\nboyfriend (of twenty-three or so days), Gary Fellenbaum.               Fellenbaum\u2019s\n\n\u201cestranged\u201d wife, Amber, was also involved, in some sort of an ersatz menage\n\na trois.1\n\n       Although Appellant claims only Gary Fellenbaum, (not she), punched the\n\ndeceased child with a closed fist, she does not deny the rest of her involvement\n\nin the beatings, e.g., that she hit the children with a wooden spoon and a\n\nfrying pan, and apparently a curtain rod. They also used a homemade whip\n\non the children. (See Facts in Support of Plea, 2/28/18). Instead of doing\n\nanything to stop Fellenbaum, Appellant actively assisted him.\n\n       Notably,    after   the    beatings     rendered   the   three-year-old   child\n\nunconscious on the second and third days, they put him in a shower to revive\n\nhim, apparently so he could be beaten again. On the third day, he did not\n\nrespond. When he finally succumbed to his numerous injuries, it appears that\n\nAmber Fellenbaum belatedly called the police.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1The Fellenbaums also had an eleven-month-old daughter. She was not the\nobject of any beatings addressed in this appeal.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S57029-18\n\n\n        There is no dispute that Appellant cooperated with the police when she\n\nwas arrested. She gave them a confession. She also claims that she did not\n\nfile any pre-trial motions or engage in any other procedures that would have\n\nheld up prosecution.2        Appellant attributes Mr. Fellenbaum\u2019s plea to first-\n\ndegree murder to her own guilty plea and stated willingness to testify against\n\nhim at a trial. (See Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 11). Mr. Fellenbaum was sentenced\n\nto life without parole.\n\n        As a result of her plea, the Commonwealth withdrew its notice to seek\n\nthe death penalty for Appellant. (See Trial Court Opinion, 3/01/18, at 1). As\n\nagreed, the Commonwealth made no recommendation at sentencing. (See\n\nid. at 2 n.4).     At sentencing, the court had the benefit of a presentence\n\ninvestigation report (PSI).3 Appellant presented herself as remorseful. She\n\nhad no prior criminal record, and therefore a prior record score of zero. She\n\ndescribed herself as the victim of a manipulative Fellenbaum. She recounted\n\nthat Fellenbaum restricted her to an hour of sleep a night and forced her to\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2This claim is rather dubious and demonstrably inaccurate. Even though both\nAppellant and the prosecutor assert the same claim at different times, the\nproposition is belied by the record, which confirms numerous motions filed by\nAppellant\u2019s counsel on November 1, 2016. At the plea hearing, the trial court\nnoted that Appellant\u2019s guilty plea was \u201can effective withdrawal\u201d of the pending\nmotions. (N.T. (Plea), 4/12/17, at 23). It is more accurate to note, as\nAppellant\u2019s counsel does on appeal, that the motions were not \u201clitigated.\u201d\n(Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 11). Nevertheless, to imply that no motions were filed\nbecause they were not litigated is both inaccurate and misleading.\n\n3   The PSI is not included in the record before us.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S57029-18\n\n\nrun the household on a budget of five dollars a week. She related her own\n\nmedical history of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), depression, and an\n\nattempted teenage suicide.\n\n       The sentencing court noted that with Appellant\u2019s recitation emphasizing\n\nher own loss, \u201cYou almost spoke as if someone took the child away from you.\u201d\n\n(N.T. Sentencing, 12/11/17, at 29).              The court imposed an aggregate\n\nsentence of not less than forty-two years, nor more than ninety-four years of\n\nincarceration in a state correctional institution, followed by five years of\n\nprobation. (See Trial Ct. Op., at 2). The court denied Appellant\u2019s motion for\n\nreconsideration of sentence. This timely appeal followed.4\n\n       Appellant presents two overlapping questions for our review:\n\n             1. Whether the trial court\u2019s sentence was excessive, given\n       the Sentencing Guideline ranges and the Appellant\u2019s cooperation\n       with the prosecution, and the significantly more brutal assaults\n       perpetrated on the decedent by the closed fist punches to the head\n       and abdomen of the victim, administered exclusively by co-\n       defendant Gary Fellenbaum?\n\n             2. Did the sentencing court abuse its discretion by\n       completely disregarding, and failing to adequately consider,\n       Appellant\u2019s cooperation, instead being horrified by the crimes,\n       themselves, to the exclusion of all else, including the character\n       and attitudes of the Appellant, as well as her needs?\n\n(Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 7).\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n4Appellant filed a court-ordered statement of errors, on February 1, 2018.\nThe trial court filed an opinion on March 1, 2018. See Pa.R.A.P. 1925.\n\n                                           -4-\n\fJ-S57029-18\n\n\n      Because both of Appellant\u2019s claims challenge the discretionary aspects\n\nof her sentence, we address them together.\n\n      It is well-settled that a challenge to the discretionary aspects of a\n\nsentence is a petition for permission to appeal, as the right to pursue such a\n\nclaim is not absolute. See Commonwealth v. Treadway, 104 A.3d 597,\n\n599 (Pa. Super. 2014). Before this Court may review the merits of a challenge\n\nto the discretionary aspects of a sentence, we must engage in the following\n\ninquiry:\n\n            [W]e conduct a four part analysis to determine: (1) whether\n      appellant has filed a timely notice of appeal, see Pa.R.A.P. 902\n      and 903; (2) whether the issue was properly preserved at\n      sentencing or in a motion to reconsider and modify sentence, see\n      Pa.R.Crim.P. 720; (3) whether appellant\u2019s brief has a fatal defect,\n      Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f); and (4) whether there is a substantial question\n      that the sentence appealed from is not appropriate under the\n      Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9781(b).\n\nCommonwealth v. Moury, 992 A.2d 162, 170 (Pa. Super. 2010) (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n      We note that here Appellant has met the first three parts of the four-\n\nprong test. She filed a timely appeal. Appellant preserved the sentencing\n\nissue in a post-sentence motion. (See Appellant\u2019s Post-Sentence Motion for\n\nReconsideration of Sentence, 12/21/17).         In addition, she included a\n\nstatement pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f) in her brief. (See Appellant\u2019s Brief,\n\nat 11-12). Thus, we next assess whether Appellant has raised a substantial\n\nquestion with respect to the issue she presents.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJ-S57029-18\n\n\n         Whether a particular issue constitutes a substantial question about the\n\nappropriateness of a sentence is a question to be evaluated on a case-by-case\n\nbasis.     See Commonwealth v. Kenner, 784 A.2d 808, 811 (Pa. Super.\n\n2001), appeal denied, 796 A.2d 979 (Pa. 2002).\n\n         As to what constitutes a substantial question, this Court does not accept\n\nbald assertions of sentencing errors. See Commonwealth v. Malovich, 903\n\nA.2d 1247, 1252 (Pa. Super. 2006). An appellant must articulate the reasons\n\nthe sentencing court\u2019s actions violated the Sentencing Code.           See id.   \u201cA\n\nsubstantial question will be found where the defendant advances a colorable\n\nargument that the sentence imposed is either inconsistent with a specific\n\nprovision of the Sentencing Code or is contrary to the fundamental norms\n\nunderlying the sentencing process.\u201d Commonwealth v. Ventura, 975 A.2d\n\n1128, 1133 (Pa. Super. 2009), appeal denied, 987 A.2d 161 (Pa. 2009)\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n               Our inquiry must focus on the reasons for which the appeal\n         is sought, in contrast to the facts underlying the appeal, which are\n         necessary only to decide the appeal on the merits.\u201d [S]ee [ ]\n         Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f).\n\n                                         *     *   *\n\n               [An Appellant\u2019s] claim that the trial court focused exclusively\n         on the seriousness of the crime while ignoring other, mitigating\n         circumstances, such as [ ] mental health history and difficult\n         childhood, raises a substantial question.\n\nCommonwealth v. Knox, 165 A.3d 925, 929\u201330 (Pa. Super. 2017), appeal\n\ndenied, 173 A.3d 257 (Pa. 2017) (case citations omitted).\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fJ-S57029-18\n\n\n      Here, Appellant claims that there was a substantial question whether\n\nher sentence was appropriate under the sentencing statute. (See Appellant\u2019s\n\nBrief, at 11). She notes that the sentence was at the top of the standard\n\nrange of the Sentencing Guidelines. (See id.).\n\n      While the Rule 2119(f) statement is not a model of clarity or\n\nconciseness, it is apparent that Appellant claims her sentence was excessive\n\nin light of mitigating circumstances, including her cooperation with the\n\nCommonwealth, and her remorse.          She also invokes her own difficult\n\nchildhood, history of depression, PTSD, attempted suicide, and other personal\n\ntroubles. See Knox, supra at 929\u201330.\n\n      Accordingly, we will give Appellant the benefit of the doubt, grant her\n\npetition for allowance of appeal, and address the merits of her claim.\n\nNevertheless, on independent review, we conclude that Appellant\u2019s claim\n\nmerits no relief.\n\n      Our standard of review is well-settled.\n\n             Sentencing is a matter vested in the sound discretion of the\n      sentencing judge, and a sentence will not be disturbed on appeal\n      absent a manifest abuse of discretion. In this context, an abuse\n      of discretion is not shown merely by an error in judgment. Rather,\n      the appellant must establish, by reference to the record, that the\n      sentencing court ignored or misapplied the law, exercised its\n      judgment for reasons of partiality, prejudice, bias or ill will, or\n      arrived at a manifestly unreasonable decision.\n\nCommonwealth v. Mann, 957 A.2d 746, 749 (Pa. Super. 2008) (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fJ-S57029-18\n\n\n        A sentencing judge has broad discretion in determining a reasonable\n\npenalty, and appellate courts afford the sentencing court great deference, as\n\nit is the sentencing court that is in the best position to \u201cview the defendant\u2019s\n\ncharacter, displays of remorse, defiance, or indifference, and the\n\noverall effect and nature of the crime.\u201d Commonwealth v. Walls, 926\n\nA.2d 957, 961 (Pa. 2007) (emphasis added) (citation omitted).\n\n        When imposing sentence, the sentencing court must consider \u201cthe\n\nprotection of the public, the gravity of the offense as it relates to the impact\n\non the life of the victim and on the community, and the rehabilitative needs\n\nof the defendant.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9721(b). This Court has stated, \u201ca court is\n\nrequired to consider the particular circumstances of the offense and the\n\ncharacter of the defendant.\u201d Commonwealth v. Griffin, 804 A.2d 1, 10 (Pa.\n\nSuper. 2002), appeal denied, 868 A.2d 1198 (Pa. 2005), cert. denied, 545\n\nU.S. 1148 (2005) (citation omitted). In particular, the sentencing court should\n\nrefer   to   the   defendant\u2019s   prior   criminal   record,   her   age,   personal\n\ncharacteristics, and her potential for rehabilitation. See id.\n\n        \u201cWhere pre-sentence reports exist, we shall . . . presume that the\n\nsentencing judge was aware of relevant information regarding the defendant\u2019s\n\ncharacter and weighed those considerations along with mitigating statutory\n\nfactors. A pre-sentence report constitutes the record and speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Antidormi, 84 A.3d 736, 761 (Pa. Super. 2014), appeal\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fJ-S57029-18\n\n\ndenied, 95 A.3d 275 (Pa.2014) (quoting Commonwealth v. Devers, 546\n\nA.2d 12, 18 (Pa. 1988)).\n\n      In this case, Appellant posits that the sentencing court did not give\n\nadequate consideration to her cooperation with the Commonwealth\u2019s\n\nprosecutions, or her other mitigation evidence. She notes that by pleading\n\nguilty she spared her surviving son the ordeal of testifying at a trial. However,\n\nwe presume that a sentencing court properly considered mitigation evidence\n\nwhen it is informed, as the court was here, by a PSI. See Antidormi, supra\n\nat 761.\n\n      Moreover, Appellant fails to develop an argument supported by\n\npertinent authority which substantiates her repeated claims that the\n\nsentencing court failed to credit, or give more than \u201clip service,\u201d to her\n\ncooperation and other mitigation evidence. (Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 13).\n\n      Over-arching the sentencing court\u2019s presumed reliance on the PSI, we\n\nnote that the sentencing court explained its reasoning as follows:\n\n            So the record is clear, I\u2019ve gone outside the guidelines on\n      some of the sentences. I\u2019ve done so because I can\u2019t imagine a\n      factual scenario that\u2019s more horrific than this. I can\u2019t imagine an\n      abdication of parental responsibility and the conspiracy with\n      another human being to do this to your children.\n\n            It tugged at the fabric of our entire society.\n\n(N. T. Sentencing, 12/11/17, at 34).\n\n      We agree. We discern no proper basis on which to disturb the discretion\n\nof the sentencing court.\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fJ-S57029-18\n\n\n     Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
