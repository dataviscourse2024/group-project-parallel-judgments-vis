            "opinion_text": "\nEDITH BROWN CLEMENT, Circuit Judge:\nThis appeal contemplates the application of a sentence enhancement to a defendant\u2019s sentence for being unlawfully present in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 (2000). The Pre-Sentenc-ing Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended that a sixteen-level enhancement be added to a base offense level of eight because Enrique Vargas-Duran (\u201cVargas-Duran\u201d) previously had been convicted of intoxication assault under Texas law. Vargas-Duran objected to the enhancement, arguing it was improper because intoxication assault was not a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2 of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d). The district court agreed with the PSR\u2019s recommendation and enhanced Vargas-Duran\u2019s sentence. On appeal, a majority of a panel of this Court affirmed the district court, holding that intoxication assault required the use of force, and, as such, met the U.S.S.G. definition of a crime of violence.\nThis Court now examines and clarifies the law with respect to sentencing enhancements which require \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, Application Note l(B)(ii)(I) (2001). We hold that the \u201cuse\u201d of force requires that a defendant intentionally avail himself of that force. *600We further hold that the intentional use of force must be an element of the predicate offense if the predicate offense is to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence. Because the intentional use of force is not an element of the crime of Texas intoxication assault, we VACATE Vargas-Duran\u2019s sentence and REMAND his case for resen-tencing in accordance with this opinion.\nI. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\nIn 1996, Vargas-Duran, a citizen of Mexico, was convicted of intoxication assault in Texas state court. Under the Texas statute, a person was guilty of intoxication assault when that person, \u201cby accident or mistake, while operating an aircraft, watercraft or motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated, by reason of that intoxication causes serious bodily injury to another.\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 49.07 (1994).1 Following his conviction and sentence, Vargas-Duran was deported from Hidalgo, Texas to Mexico.\nOn June 24, 2001, Vargas-Duran was again found in Texas. He pleaded guilty to being unlawfully present in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2).2 A PSR was prepared using the 2001 version of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The base level of Vargas-Duran\u2019s offense was eight; the PSR recommended a sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) provides for a sixteen-level enhancement if \u201cthe defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after ... a conviction for a felony that is a ... crime of violence.\u201d The Application Notes define \u201ccrime of violence\u201d either as one of a list of enumerated offenses or as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. Application Note l(B)(ii)(I). The PSR recommended that Vargas-Duran\u2019s 1996 conviction for intoxication assault be considered a crime of violence for purposes of enhancing his sentence.\nThe district court agreed with the PSR. In adopting the PSR\u2019s recommendation, the district court sentenced Vargas-Duran to a sixty-four month term of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release. Vargas-Duran timely appealed.\n*601On January 16, 2003, a majority of a panel of this Court affirmed the enhancement of Vargas-Duran\u2019s sentence. United States v. Vargas-Duran, 319 F.3d 194, 199 (5th Cir.2003), vacated and reh\u2019g granted by 336 F.3d 418 (5th Cir.2003). As a preliminary matter, the panel majority observed that because intoxication assault is not one of the enumerated offenses under \u00a7 2L1.2, Vargas-Duran\u2019s sentence could only be enhanced if the crime of intoxication assault had \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d 319 F.3d at 196 (citations omitted). Next, the majority reiterated the rule that this Court \u201cneed not discuss the facts underlying Vargas-Duran\u2019s prior conviction, since we \u2018look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense\u2019 to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for sentencing enhancement purposes.\u201d Id. (citations omitted).\nBecause intoxication assault requires that an intoxicated offender \u201ccause[ ] serious bodily injury to another,\u201d the majority concluded that the crime has as an element the use of force. 319 F.3d at 196. Observing that neither Vargas-Duran nor any Texas decision gave an example of an instance in which a defendant was convicted of intoxication assault without using physical force against a person, the majority concluded that causing serious bodily injury \u201cqualifie[d]\u201d as using force. Id. at 196-97.\nVargas-Duran\u2019s primary contention was that \u201cuse of force\u201d implied the intentional use of force. Relying on this Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d 921 (5th Cir.2001), in which we held that the sentence of a defendant with a prior conviction for driving while intoxicated (\u201cDWI\u201d) could not be enhanced as a crime of violence, Vargas-Duran argued that the approach endorsed by Chapa-Garza similarly should apply to intoxication assault. 319 F.3d at 197.\nThe majority disagreed with Vargas-Duran\u2019s proposed use of Chapar-Garza on three grounds. First, the majority distinguished Chapa-Garza by observing that Chapa-Garza did not purport to interpret \u00a7 2L1.2.3 319 F.3d at 197. As a second point of distinction, the majority pointed out that the crime of felony DWI, which is committed when a defendant with two pri- or convictions begins operating a vehicle while intoxicated, could be committed without the use of force. Id. at 198. As a third point of distinction the majority emphasized that the felony DWI statute at issue in Chapa-Garza was not analyzed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a), the language of which is similar to \u00a7 2L1.2, Application Note l(B)(ii)(I). Id. The majority characterized \u00a7 16(b), under which Chapa-Garza ivas decided, as a \u201ccatch-all\u201d provision, and opined that \u201cChapcu-Garza\u2019s analysis of \u00a7 16(b) would have been entirely unnecessary had the crime of Texas felony DWI contained as an element the \u2018use of force,\u2019 as does the Texas crime of intoxication assault at issue in this case.\u201d Id. The *602majority therefore concluded that \u201c[i]n light of the plain language of the revised guideline and its commentary,\u201d no state of mind requirement should be implied in \u00a7 2L1.2. Id. at 199.\nThe dissent from the panel majority\u2019s ruling in Vargas-Duran argued that \u201cuse\u201d, by its very definition, requires intent. 319 F.3d at 201 (Clement, J., dissenting). Because intoxication assault encompasses an act that takes place \u201cby accident or mistake\u201d, the dissent reasoned that intoxication assault does not necessarily require the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force. Id. at 204.\nVargas-Duran timely filed a petition for rehearing en banc on January 30, 2003. By court order, rehearing en banc was granted on June 26, 2003, and the panel opinion was vacated. United States v. Vargas-Duran, 336 F.3d 418 (5th Cir.2003).\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\nBecause the grant of en banc rehearing vacates the earlier panel decision, we review de novo a district court\u2019s legal conclusions or interpretations of the meaning of a guideline. United States v. Griffin, 324 F.3d 330, 365 (5th Cir.2003). We therefore review a challenge to the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2L1.2 de novo. United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, 323 F.3d 317, 318 (5th Cir.2003).\nIII. DISCUSSION\nA. \u201cUse of Force\u201d\nThe first issue before the Court is whether \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, Application Note l(B)(ii)(I), means that the predicate offense requires that a defendant intentionally avail himself of that force. We hold that it does.\nIt is an elementary rule of statutory construction that \u201cthe words of a statute will be given their plain meaning absent ambiguity.\u201d Texas Food Indus. Ass\u2019n v. United States Dept. of Agric., 81 F.3d 578, 582 (5th Cir.1996). Similarly, a statute should be construed such that no word is left without operative effect. Texaco Inc. v. Duke, 274 F.3d 911, 920 (5th Cir.2001). We are bound to follow each Sentencing Guideline; commentary is also authoritative if not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the guidelines. United States v. Urias-Escobar, 281 F.3d 165, 167 (5th Cir.2002). Guidelines, and thus their commentary, are subject to the ordinary rules of statutory construction. United States v. Carbajal, 290 F.3d 277, 283 (5th Cir.2002).\nBecause \u201cuse\u201d is not defined by the Sentencing Guidelines, we first look to its plain meaning. Beginning with the definition as commonly understood within the legal community, \u201cuse\u201d means \u201c[t]he application or employment of something.\u201d BlaCK\u2019s Law DICTIONARY 1540 (7th ed.1999). In more broad-based English application, \u201cuse\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he act of employing a thing for any ... purpose; the fact, state, or condition of being so employed; utilization or employment for or with some aim or purpose, application or conversion to some ... end.\u201d 19 The OxfoRD English Dictionary 350 (2d ed. 1989) (emphasis added).4 Similarly, another dictionary ob*603serves that \u201cSERVICE, ADVANTAGE, PROFIT, ACCOUNT, AVAIL, and USE have in common a sense of a useful or valuable end, result, or purpose. USE stresses the practicality of the end, result, or purpose for which something is employed.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 2523 (1993) (emphasis added).5 The overwhelming majority of authority on the plain meaning of \u201cuse\u201d contemplates the application of something to achieve a purpose. Supplementing the word \u201cforce\u201d in place of the indeterminate object \u201csomething\u201d in the aforementioned dictionary definition bears out this meaning: \u201cuse of force\u201d means \u201cthe act of employing force for any ... purpose,\u201d or \u201cto avail oneself of force.\u201d Because we conclude that the meaning of \u201cuse of force\u201d is free of ambiguity, we therefore hold that the plain meaning of the word \u201cuse\u201d requires intent.\nOur adoption of the plain meaning of \u201cuse\u201d is further supported by the rule of statutory interpretation that requires us, when possible, to give each word in a statute operative effect. This rule of construction dictates that the word \u201cuse\u201d must have an operative effect when left standing alone, or when modified by either \u201cattempted\u201d or \u201cthreatened.\u201d Both an attempt and a threat require intent. See BlaCK\u2019s Law Dictionary 123, 1489 (7th ed. 1999) (defining \u201cattempt\u201d and \u201cthreat\u201d). Were we to interpret \u201cuse of force\u201d inconsistently with its plain meaning' \u2014 -that is, as capable of being performed without intent \u2014 we would effectively nullify the state of mind required by \u201cattempted use\u201d and \u201cthreatened use.\u201d For how could one intentionally attempt to unintentionally use force, or intentionally threaten to unintentionally use force? The force, so to speak, of this rhetorical question only bolsters our belief that \u201cuse\u201d requires intent.\nOur adoption of the plain meaning of the word \u201cuse\u201d is supported by our caselaw as well.6 In United States v. Chapa-Garza, *604243 F.3d 921 (5th Cir.2001), we held that the crime of felony DWI under Texas law was not a crime of violence, because \u201c[i\\n-tentional force against another\u2019s person or property is virtually never employed to commit this offense.\u201d Id. at 927. At issue in Chapa-Garza was whether felony DWI fit within the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) definition of crime of violence as an offense \u201cthat is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d Id. at 924 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). We first declined to read \u00a7 16(b) in the same way in which we read U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). Id. at 926. Although we hinged that decision on \u00a7 16(b)\u2019s emphasis on the use of force during the commission of the offense, an equally valid basis for distinction is the fact that \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) does not mention either \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cforce.\u201d Id. at 925. We went on to avow that \u201c[t]he criterion that the defendant use physical force against the person or property of another is most reasonably read to refer to intentional conduct, not an accidental, unintended event.\u201d Id. at 926. Relying in part on the Third Circuit\u2019s elucidation of \u201cuse of force\u201d in United States v. Parson, 955 F.2d 858 (3rd Cir.1992), we concluded that the dictionary definitions of \u201cuse\u201d indicate that the word \u201crefers to volitional, purposeful, not accidental, employment of whatever is being \u2018used\u2019.\u201d 243 F.3d at 926.\nNothing in our opinion in Chapa-Garza encouraged a reading restricting our plain-meaning analysis of the word \u201cuse\u201d to the context of only \u00a7 16(b). Section 16(b)\u2019s dictate that \u201cphysical force ... may be used\u201d does not differ substantially from \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s \u201cuse of force\u201d requirement. The distinction we made between the application of force against the body of another does not necessarily mean that the use of that force was intentional.\nIndeed, an example given in Chapa-Garza is not unlike the crime of intoxication assault. In the example posited, we believed that force was not intentionally used. We observed that\n[w]hile the victim of a drunk driver may sustain physical injury from physical force being applied to his body as a result of collision with the drunk driver\u2019s errant automobile, it is clear that such force has not been intentionally \u201cused\u201d against the other person by the drunk driver at all, much less in order to perpetrate any crime, including the crime of felony DWI.\n243 F.3d at 927. The distinction we made then between force applied against the body of another and force intentionally used against the body of another is one we uphold here.\nOur ruling today is also consistent with the result we reached in United States v. Gracia-Cantu, 302 F.3d 308 (5th Cir.2002). Gracia-Cantu\u2019s sentence was enhanced for a prior Texas felony conviction for injury to a child,7 which the PSR claimed constituted a crime of violence. 302 F.3d at 311. *605On appeal, it was persuasively argued by Gracia-Cantu and eventually conceded by the Government that \u00a7 16(a) was inapplicable to Gracia-Cantu\u2019s predicate offense because \u201cthe statutory definition of the offense does not explicitly require the application of force as an element.\u201d Id. at 312. Although we did not further address \u00a7 16(a) because of this concession, we now observe that this interpretation of \u00a7 16(a) is consistent with our view that \u201cuse of force\u201d requires intent.8\nB. \u201cAn Element\u201d\nBecause the panel held that the use of force was an element of the offense of intoxication assault, we turn now to address whether the intentional use of force is an element of the crime of intoxication assault. We hold that it is not.\nAs we have earlier noted, \u00a7 2L1.2 allows enhancement when the statute has \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, Application Note l(B)(ii)(I) (2001) (emphasis added). Thus, Vargas-Duran\u2019s sentence enhancement depends not only upon the meaning of the word \u201cuse\u201d, but also upon whether the predicate offense has the use of force as an element of the crime.9 In our current legal terminology, an element is \u201c[a] constituent part of a claim that must be proved for the claim to succeed.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 538 (7th ed. 1999). Thus, in order for \u00a7 2L1.2 to apply, the intentional use of force must be \u201ca constituent part of a claim that must be proved for the claim to succeed.\u201d See United States v. Williams, 343 F.3d 423, 432 (5th Cir.2003) (observing that \u201c[t]raditionally, an \u2018offense\u2019 was defined by its \u2018elements,\u2019 i.e., facts necessary to support a conviction for the offense\u201d). If any set of facts would support a conviction without proof of that component, then the component most decidedly is not an element \u2014 implicit or explicit \u2014 of the crime. More specifically, in the case of Vargas-Duran, intentional use of force would have to be an element of the crime of intoxication assault \u2014 that is to say that no conviction would be upheld absent proof that the defendant intentionally used force against the person of another. But a requirement that a defendant intentionally use force is simply not an element that needs to be proved under Texas law.\nThe Texas crime of intoxication assault requires that a prosecutor prove that the defendant (1) by accident or mistake, (2) while operating a motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated, (3) by reason of that intoxication causes serious bodily injury to another. Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 49.07 (1994). Texas courts have held that the very words \u201cby accident or mistake\u201d plainly dispense with any mens rea requirement. Stidman v. State, 981 S.W.2d 227, 230 (Tex.App.1998). Therefore, all that need be proved for a conviction is an intoxicated driver\u2019s operation of a motor vehicle in a public place that results in a serious bodily injury to another. No mens rea need be established for prosecution.10\n*606Further, the fact that the statute requires that serious bodily injury result from the operation of a motor vehicle by an intoxicated person does not mean that the statute requires that the defendant have used the force that caused the injury. All that the statute requires is that a bodily injury occur and that the injury was causally linked to the conduct of the defendant. No facts beyond these need be established in order for a conviction to lie.\nLooking only at the fact of Vargas-Duran\u2019s conviction and the statutory definition of intoxication assault, it is clear that the intentional use of force against the person of another is not a necessary component of the offense. The prosecution of Vargas-Duran for the predicate offense in no way rested on proof of any mens rea, much less intent. There is also a difference between a defendant\u2019s causation of an injury and the defendant\u2019s use of force. Consequently, Vargas-Duran\u2019s use of force was simply not a fact necessary to support his conviction for intoxication assault. Because the use of force is not an element of the' offense of intoxication assault, Vargas-Duran\u2019s sentence was improperly enhanced.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the enhanced sentence applied by the district court is VACATED, and we REMAND this ease for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.\n\n. The 1999 amendment to this statute is of no moment to this appeal.\n\n\n. Section 1326, title 8, states in pertinent part:\n(a) In general\nSubject to subsection (b) of this section, any alien who\u2014\n(1) has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed or has departed the United States while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is outstanding, and thereafter\n(2) enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States, unless (A) prior to his reembarkation at a place outside the United States or his application for admission from foreign contiguous territory, the Attorney General has expressly consented to such alien\u2019s reapplying for admission; or (B) with respect to an alien previously denied admission and removed, unless such alien shall establish that he was not required to obtain such advance consent under this chapter or any prior Act,\nshall be fined under title 18, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both, (b) Criminal penalties for reentry of certain removed aliens\nNotwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of any alien described in such subsection\u2014\n(2) whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, such alien shall be fined under such title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both[.]\n\n\n. Chapa-Garza was decided under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), a predecessor of \u00a7 2L1.2 (the guideline at issue in the present appeal). Chapa-Garza\u2019s sentence was enhanced by the district court because it determined that DWI was an aggravated felony. An aggravated felony was, in turn, defined as, among other things, a crime of violence. Section 16(b) of Title 18 provided that a crime of violence was \u201cany other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d Cf. \u00a7 2L1.2 (2000) (defining a crime of violence as \"an offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d).\n\n\n. Lest this Court be accused of selectively defining \"use\u201d to comport with the result reached in this case, we hasten to add that other dictionaries have similarly defined the term. According to The American Heritage Dictionary, \"use\u201d means \"[t]o put into service or apply for a purpose; employ.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1894 (4th ed. 2000). The verb form of \"use\u201d as stated in the Encarta World English *603Dictionary is defined as meaning \u201cto employ something for some purpose or to put something into action or service,\u201d while the noun form is defined as \"the act of using something for a particular purpose.\u201d Encarta World English Dictionary 1956 (1999). One Webster's dictionary gives the primary definition of \"use\u201d as \"the act or practice of employing something,\u201d and a secondary definition as \"to put into action or service: avail oneself of: employ.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 1279 (6th ed. 1979). Finally, \"use\u201d has been defined as \"the act or practice of using something: employment,\u201d or \u201cto put into action or service.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 2523 (1993).\n\n\n. We recognize that a member of this Court in dissenting from our denial of en banc rehearing in United States v. Chapa-Garza, 262 F.3d 479, 482 (5th Cir.2001), used an earlier Webster's dictionary synonym explication of \"use\u201d to buttress his claim that \"without question, force may be used accidentally.\u201d The dissent observed that \"Webster\u2019s list of synonyms specifies 'USE is general and indicates any putting to service of a thing, usu. for an intended or fit purpose\u2019. Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged (Merriam-Webster 1986). This suggests, of course, that a purpose is not always intended.\u201d Id. at 482, n. 2. As the more recent edition of Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged omits the \u201cusually\u201d ad- \u2019 verbial restriction on purpose, we believe the clear weight of authority suggests that \"use of force\u201d requires that one intentionally avail himself of that force.\n\n\n. There is a Circuit split on the issue of whether \"use of force\u201d in the context of Sentencing Guidelines requires intent. See United States v. Lucio-Lucio, 347 F.3d 1202, 1205-06 (10th Cir.2003) (ruling that the \u201cuse of force\u201d contemplated by \u00a7 16(b) \"carries a connotation of at least some degree of intent\u201d); Bazan-Reyes v. INS, 256 F.3d 600, 609, 611 (7th Cir.2001) (holding that \"use of force\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 16(a) and \u00a7 16(b) requires intentional use). But see *604United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 335 F.3d 793, 799 (8th Cir.2003) (holding that \u201cthe definition of crime of violence contained in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1) does not contain a volitional element\u201d); United States v. Bonilla-Montenegro, 331 F.3d 1047, 1051 (9th Cir.2003) (finding that designation of an offense as a crime of violence does not require the intentional use of force; recklessness will suffice).\n\n\n. Injury to a child is committed when a person \"intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence, by act or intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly by omission, causes to a child, elderly individual, or disabled individual: (1) serious bodily injury; (2) serious mental deficiency, impairment, or injury; or (3) bodily injury.\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.04(a) (2002).\n\n\n. This interpretation also comports with our assessment, infra, that not only must force be used intentionally, but such use must also be \u201can element\u201d of the predicate offense.\n\n\n. The panel explicitly ruled that \"[b]ecause the Texas crime of intoxication assault has as an element the use of force against the person of another, we conclude that the district court did not err in imposing the 16-level enhancement.\u201d United States v. Vargas-Duran, 319 F.3d 194, 199 (5th Cir.2003) (emphasis added).\n\n\n.Our ruling on the \"element\u201d requirement of this Sentencing Guideline is consistent with that of the Second Circuit in Chrzanoski v. Ashcroft, 327 F.3d 188 (2d Cir.2003). In Chrzanoski, the Government argued that, while the state statute in question did not expressly identify \"the use, attempted use, or threatened use\u201d of physical force as an ele*606ment, it was implicit in the statute\u2019s requirement that physical injury be caused. Id. at 193. The Second Circuit rejected the Government's argument and concluded that there was a difference between the use of force and the causation of injury. Id. at 194. We agree.\n\n",

Pen.Code Ann. \u00a7 49.07) is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because:\nA. That predicate offense is not specifically named in the Guideline definition; and\nB. That predicate offense does not have as an element \u201cthe use or attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d as Judge Clement so clearly articulates in Part IIIB of her majority opinion.\nI reach this conclusion because neither the word \u201cuse\u201d nor the word \u201cforce\u201d nor the word \u201cattempted\u201d nor the word \u201cthreatened\u201d appears anywhere in the text of the statute defining this predicate offense; nor should these terms be read into that statute by inference.\nHowever, I agree with Judge Garza\u2019s dissent that we should not make this decision by relying upon our prior holding in Chapar-Garza because:\nA. That opinion was issued prior to the issuance of the new U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 in 2001; and\nB. This new definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d does not have any cross-reference to either 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), nor to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a) or (b), nor to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, as did the version of \u00a7 2L1.2 which was applicable at the time Chapctr-Garza was decided.\nI find myself in a straddle position, agreeing with the result of Judge Clement\u2019s opinion, but disagreeing with Part IIIA of her opinion in which she relies on Chapa-Garza to interpret the language of *607Application Note l(B)(ii)(I) as requiring an \u201cintentional use of force.\u201d Likewise, I disagree with Judge Garza\u2019s interpretation of Tex. Pen.Code Ann. \u00a7 49.07 as containing as an element thereof the \u201cuse or threatened use or attempted use of physical force against the person of another\u201d so as to come within the language of Note l(B)(ii)(I), but I agree with much of his dissent, which reviews the history and purpose of the complete change made by the Sentencing Commission in 2001 in the text of \u00a7 2L1.2 and the importance of construing the definitions of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d as set forth therein as new separate free standing definitions.\nGiven that the district courts of the Fifth Circuit handle more illegal alien cases than other district courts (and our Circuit sees more appeals of these cases than any other Circuit) and given that most of these illegal alien cases involve defendants with prior criminal convictions, I think it would be appropriate, time-saving, and cost-effective to set forth for the benefit of the bench and bar some ground rules and procedures for applying the new \u00a7 2L1.2. Towards that end I make the following suggestions:\n\nGround Rules for Interpretation\n\n1. The definitions in Application Note 1(B) of \u00a7 2L1.2 are expressly limited to subsection (b)(1) of that Guideline.\n2. The definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in Application Note l(B)(ii) was inserted by the Sentencing Commission in 2001 and differs significantly from other definitions of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in the criminal code and in the Guidelines. Therefore, any interpretation of this definition in Vargas-Duran should not be derived from other statutes or guidelines where other definitions of that term are used; and any interpretation here in Vargas-Duran is applicable only to cases applying the \u00a7 2L1.2 Guideline. Similarly, definitions of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d prior to the 2001 amendments to \u00a7 2L1.2 are no longer applicable to sentencing after November 1, 2001, under that Guideline.\n3. The new definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d in Application Note 2 of \u00a7 2L1.2 is expressly limited to subsection (b)(1)(C) of that Guideline; and therefore any interpretation of that term here in Vargas-Duran should not be derived from other statutes or guidelines which define that term differently; and any interpretations here in Vargas-Duran are applicable only to cases applying \u00a7 2L1.2. Likewise, pri- or definitions of the term \u201caggravated felony\u201d under prior versions of \u00a7 2L1.2 are no longer controlling.\n4. In adopting the new definitions of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d in the 2001 Guidelines, the Sentencing Commission clearly intended to change the type of predicate offenses which would qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Therefore, we should strictly construe the language used in the 2001 version of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d particularly as defined by (B)(ii)(I).\n5. In comparing the language used in the new definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d it should be noted that:\nA. Not all of the specifically named offenses in subpart (II) meet the definitional test in subpart (I), which should lead to the conclusion that the specifically named crimes take precedence over the definition; and\nB. The definition in subpart (I) is identical to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a) except that it omits the words \u201cor proper*608ty\u201d after the word \u201cperson;\u201d which leads to the conclusion that a crime against property which is not specifically named in subpart (II) cannot be a crime of violence under sub-part (I).\nC. The list of specifically named offenses in subpart (II) is the same as the list of offenses which are crimes of violence under the definition in Application Note \u00a7 4B1.2, but none of the definitions in \u00a7 2L1.2 include any of the other definitions of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d which appear in \u00a7 4B1.2, which focus on \u201cconduct that by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d This difference clearly indicates that in determining what constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d un- \u2022 der subpart (I) of \u00a7 2L1.2, we should not consider 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) which focuses on conduct that \u201cby its nature involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used against another\u201d or \u00a7 4B1.2 which focuses on \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d\nIn view of the foregoing, I propose that we craft a clear and methodical approach for determining sentencing enhancements under the current \u00a7 2L1.2 for the benefit of the bench and bar. In so doing, it is important to reemphasize that in rendering this proposal for construing the provisions of \u00a7 2L1.2, I am not suggesting that we attempt to arrive at a one-size-fits-all definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d that purports to apply to other guideline provisions which utilize the crime of violence terminology. Rather, this is a provision-specific proposal that hopefully adds a little clarity to a much muddled area of the law.\nIn determining the appropriate sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2, the Guidelines direct courts to \u201capply the greatest\u201d of the enhancement levels, beginning with the 16-level and ending with the 4-level enhancement. Therefore, whenever the issue for enhancement involving a potential \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2 is raised, I would determine the appropriate enhancement level as follows:\nStep 1: I would determine whether the predicate offense is one of the specifically named offenses found in Application Note l(B)(ii)(II), which includes \u201cmurder, manslaughter, kidnaping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses (including sexual abuse of a minor), robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling.\u201d If the predicate offense at issue is one of these listed offenses, a 16-level enhancement is appropriate and no further analysis is required.\nStep 2: If the predicate offense is not a specifically named, per se \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d I would then refer to the general definition found in Application Note l(B)(ii)(I), which defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d In determining whether the predicate offense falls under this guideline definition, I would look only to the text of the statutory provision at issue to identify whether the requisite element is present. If the statutory definition does not contain such an element, i.e., the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, then analysis under the 16-level enhancement is complete, making appropriate an analysis of the predicate offense under the 8-level \u201cag*609gravated felony\u201d definition.1\nStep 3: To determine whether the predicate offense constitutes an \u201caggravated offense\u201d warranting an 8-level enhancement, the court should look to the definition provided by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43), which retains and restores the analysis of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a) and (b). Under \u00a7 16(a) and (b), a predicate offense is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d if it either \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\u201d or is a felony that \u201cby its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d\nStep J\u00a1.: If the predicate offense is a felony conviction that does not meet the definitional standard for \u201caggravated felony\u201d as provided by \u00a7 1101(a)(43), the offense automatically receives a 4-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D).\nStep 5: Finally, if the predicate offense is not a felony but rather an aggregate of three or more misdemeanors deemed to be crimes of violence or drug trafficking offenses, the defendant is subject to a 4-level enhancement.\nApplying Step 1 of this proposed methodology to the facts in Vargas-Duran, it is clear that intoxication assault is not one of the specifically named offenses found in Application Note l(B)(ii)(II). Therefore, the focus of analysis is on Step 2 to determine whether the statute at issue \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d One is guilty of intoxication assault in Texas if he \u201cby accident or mistake ... while operating a motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated, by reason of that intoxication causes serious bodily injury to another.\u201d Tex. Pen.Code Ann. \u00a7 49.07(b). Nowhere in the text of that statute does there exist an element contemplating the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force nor can such an element be read into the statute. The guidelines simply command us to extend our analysis no further than the statutory elements. Therefore, intoxication assault cannot be a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and a 16-level enhancement is improper.\nI would next move on to Step 3 and analyze intoxication assault under the lens of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d Application Note 2 refers us to \u00a7 16(a) and (b) where we must decide whether intoxication assault fits within either statutory definition. Section 16(a) is a near identical recitation of the general definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d found in Application Note l(B)(ii)(I). The only meaningful difference is the inclusion of one\u2019s property in the former. Therefore, as I have already determined that intoxication assault does not involve using, attempting to use, or threatening to use physical force against the person of another, we can similarly conclude that intoxication assault does not contemplate the use of such force against the property of another. Accordingly, I focus on \u00a7 16(b).\nSection 16(b) applies if the predicate offense is a felony that \u201cby its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d It seems clear to me that this broader definition, which in-*610eludes such terms as \u201csubstantial risk\u201d and \u201cmay be used,\u201d is sufficient to capture the nature of the conduct in the intoxication assault statute. There is certainly a substantial risk that someone may suffer serious bodily injury as a result of an intoxicated driver\u2019s operation of a motor vehicle, whether or not physical force is used in committing the offense. Therefore, because intoxication assault falls under the definition of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as contemplated by the Sentencing Guidelines, Yargas-Duran\u2019s sentence is subject to an 8-level enhancement.\nBottom line, I would vacate the 16-level enhancement imposed by the district court and remand the case back with specific instructions to apply the 8-level enhancement in accordance with the methodology set forth herein.\nEMILIO M. GARZA, Circuit Judge, joined by RHESA HAWKINS BARKSDALE, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\nThe court\u2019s opinion holds that \u201cuse\u201d within the context of U.S. SENTENCING Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2 (2001) means \u201cintentional use.\u201d1 This holding is inconsistent with the plain language of the sentencing guidelines, and it leads to unsound results for other guidelines where the Sentencing Commission actually includes mens rea elements modifying the term \u201cuse.\u201d Further, this holding ignores the Sentencing Commission\u2019s recent revision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, and is inconsistent with the rationale of United States v. Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d 921 (5th Cir.2001). Absent this Court\u2019s addition of the mens rea element of intent to the verb \u201cuse,\u201d it is clear that the Texas intoxication assault statute is a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\nThe 2001 version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, under which Vargas-Duran was sentenced, provides a 16-level sentence enhancement to a base offense level of 8 \u201c[i]f the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after\u2014 (A) a conviction for a felony that is ... (ii) a crime of violence.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Application Note 1 of the guideline defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n.l(B)(ii)(I) (2001).2\n*611Despite the plain language of the \u00a7 2L1.2 crime of violence definition, the court\u2019s opinion inserts the word \u201cintentional\u201d before the word \u201cuse.\u201d There is no mens rea language with respect to the \u201cuse of force\u201d element in the \u00a7 2L1.2 definition. Cf. United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 335 F.3d 793, 798 (8th Cir.2003) (\u201c[T]he text of the [\u00a7 2L1.2] definition mentions only the actus reas [sic] and is silent as to the mens rea \u2014 or intent element.\u201d). Although there is a presumption that criminal statutes include an element of mental culpability, and strict liability crimes are disfavored, see, e.g., Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 606, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994), the \u201cuse of force\u201d requirement in \u00a7 2L1.2 is part of a strict liability 16-level sentencing enhancement and not part of a strict liability criminal statute. See United States v. Singleton, 946 F.2d 23, 26 (5th Cir.1991) (\u201cSingleton was not convicted of a strict liability crime but instead was subject to a strict liability sentencing enhancement\u201d) (emphasis in original). Even though criminal intent is a required part of the crime constituting the defendant\u2019s underlying conviction, criminal intent is not necessarily a consideration for the district court in the sentencing phase. Id. at 26-27. Thus, whether the district court must consider the mens rea of the defendant\u2019s underlying conviction depends upon the language of the sentencing guidelines.\n\u201cThe guidelines drafters have been explicit when they wished to import a mens rea requirement.\u201d Singleton, 946 F.2d at 25. The crime of violence definition under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 contains no mens rea language. In contrast, the other section within subpart 2L1 of the sentencing guidelines does include mens rea language. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) (\u201cIf the offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person ....\u201d) (emphasis added).3 Previously, this Court has refused to read a mens rea requirement into a sentencing guideline absent explicit direction to do so. See United States v. Fry, 51 F.3d 543, 546 (5th Cir.1995) (holding that, where \u201cthe language of section 2K2.1(a)(3) makes no reference to the defendant\u2019s mental state, ... [t]he section is plain on its face and should not ... be read to imply a scienter requirement.\u201d); Singleton, 946 F.2d at 25 (\u201cBecause statutory sections are to be construed as coherent wholes, the precision of the drafters in *612including mens rea in neighboring sections indicates that the reason that [\u00a7 2K2.1] does not use the word \u2018knowingly\u2019 is that the drafters did not wish such a requirement to apply.\u201d); cf. United States v. Myers, 104 F.3d 76, 81 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201cAs a straightforward matter of textual interpretation, we will not presume that a statutory crime requires specific intent in the absence of language to that effect.\u201d). The fact that the guideline drafters specifically used mens rea language in \u00a7 2L1.1 and not in \u00a7 2L1.2 indicates they did not intend the term \u201cintentional\u201d to be included before \u201cuse\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2.\nFurthermore, interpreting \u201cuse\u201d to mean \u201cintentional use\u201d in every sentencing guideline, in accordance with the court\u2019s opinion, leads to curious results. For example, applying the reasoning of the court\u2019s opinion to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.3(b)(3) and inserting the mens rea element \u201cintentional\u201d before the verb \u201cuse\u201d would change \u00a7 2K1.3(b)(3) to: \u201cIf the defendant [intentionally] used or possessed ... any explosive material with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be [intentionally] used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.... \u201d Thus, the court\u2019s opinion makes the mens rea language purposely included by the Sentencing Commission in this guideline superfluous,4 and departs from clear precedent governing statutory construction. See United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538-39, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955) (\u201cIt is our duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u201d) (internal citations omitted); United States v. Marek, 198 F.3d 532, 536 (5th Cir.1999) (\u201cA statute should be interpreted so as to give each provision significance.\u201d) (citing United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 36, 112 S.Ct. 1011, 117 L.Ed.2d 181 (1992)); see also 2A SUTHERLAND STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION \u00a7 46.06 (6th ed. 2000) (\u201cA statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part would be inoperative or superfluous.\u201d).\nTo justify its holding that \u201cuse\u201d means \u201cintentional use,\u201d the court\u2019s opinion cites to various dictionary definitions. However, by exclusively relying on dictionary definitions, the court\u2019s opinion ignores the Sentencing Commission\u2019s understanding of the term \u201cuse\u201d as demonstrated by other guidelines, and disregards clear Supreme Court precedent requiring that the meaning of a statutory provision must be determined within the context of the whole act and not in isolation. See U.S. Nat\u2019l Bank of Oregon v. Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., Inc., 508 U.S. 439, 455, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 124 *613L.Ed.2d 402 (1993) (\u201cOver and over we have stressed that \u2018in expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting United States v. Heirs of Boisdore, 49 U.S. (8 How.) 113, 122, 12 L.Ed. 1009 (1849)). I do not dispute that dictionaries are useful tools that assist this court in determining the plain meaning of ambiguous terms. However, before deciding that a term is ambiguous and turning to outside sources we must consider whether other provisions within a particular statute lend clarity to that term. See, e.g., King v. St. Vincent\u2019s Hosp., 502 U.S. 215, 221, 112 S.Ct. 570, 116 L.Ed.2d 578 (1991) (\u201c[T]he meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context.\u201d) (internal citations omitted); K Mart Corp. v. Cartier Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 291, 108 S.Ct. 1811, 100 L.Ed.2d 313 (1988) (\u201cIn ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute, the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue, as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.\u201d).\nThe meaning of a term should be determined by considering its context within the whole statute in which the term appears. This is a more appropriate indication of what the drafters of that statute understood a particular term to mean than is an outside dictionary definition. This is especially true in the case of the Sentencing Guidelines because the Commission has extensive expertise in this area, promulgates the guidelines in an effort to implement a cohesive policy, and constantly revises the guidelines in an effort to maintain internal consistency. As the preceding discussion indicates, there is no ambiguity surrounding the term \u201cuse\u201d when the Sentencing Guidelines are considered as a whole. It is clear that the Sentencing Commission does not understand the verb \u201cuse\u201d to inherently include any mens rea element. Thus, this Court should not impose a mens rea element upon that verb when the Sentencing Commission has declined to explicitly do so.\nIn addition to misapplying fundamental principles of statutory construction, the reliance by the court\u2019s opinion upon Chapa-Garza is misguided. First, Chapa-Garza held that \u201cuse\u201d means \u201cintentional use\u201d within the context of the 2000 version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of a crime of violence, not under the revised 2001 version of this guideline. Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d at 923. Unlike the 2001 version of \u00a7 2L1.2, the 2000 version did not contain its own guideline-specific definition of a crime of violence. Instead, the 2000 definition was found, through a series of cross-references, in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. The only portion of the definition considered in Cha-par-Garza was 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). See Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d at 924. Section 16(b) provides that in addition to the offenses described in \u00a7 16(a), this crime of violence definition also includes offenses where there was a \u201csubstantial risk that physical force ... may be used.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). Based upon this language, Chapa-Garza held that a crime of violence occurred when there is \u201ca substantial likelihood that the perpetrator will intentionally employ physical force.\u201d Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d at 926. The \u00a7 16(b) \u201csubstantial risk that physical force ... may be used\u201d language is different from the \u201cuse ... of physical force\u201d language found in the 2001 \u00a7 2L1.2 crime of violence definition. Furthermore, the purposes served by these two clauses, as demonstrated by the statutory structure of their respective definitions, are not comparable.5 Thus, our past *614interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) in Cha-par-Garza should not control our interpretation of the \u201cuse of force\u201d language from the first part of the 2001 crime of violence definition in this case.\nSecond, under the rationale of Chapa-Garza, the nature of the 2001 revision of \u00a7 2L1.2 counsels against relying upon previous interpretations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 in this case. Cf. Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d at 926. In Chapar-Garza, we refused to interpret the crime of violence definition in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) consistently with previous interpretations of the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) crime of violence definition. Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d at 926. We held that comparison was inappropriate because the Sentencing Commission had previously changed the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4131.2(a) crime of violence definition from a cross reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 to a self-contained definition. Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d at 926. Yet, the court\u2019s opinion in this case ignores the Sentencing Commission\u2019s choice to replace a cross reference to \u00a7 16 with a self-contained crime of violence definition in \u00a7 2L1.2. It found no significant difference between the two guidelines, thus going against the rationale expressed in Chapa-Garza..6\nThird, reliance upon Chapa-Garza for the proposition that \u201cuse\u201d means \u201cintentional use\u201d disregards the impact of the revised structure of \u00a7 2L1.2. In the Sentencing Commission\u2019s effort to create a more graduated sentence enhancement system under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the Commission included four separate enhancement levels in the 2001 version of the guideline rather than the two separate enhancement levels contained in the 2000 version. See U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 632; see also United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, 312 F.3d 697, 709-11 (5th Cir.2002) (discussing the 2001 amendments to \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s *615definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and the impact of having multiple definitions of the same term within the same guideline). The aggravated felony definition of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43), and its cross reference to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 crime of violence definition, included in. the 2000 version of \u00a7 2L1.2 were retained, but the Commission reduced the sentencing enhancement for an aggravated felony from 16 levels to 8 levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), cmt. n.2 (2001). As previously discussed, this crime of violence definition was the one Chapa-Garza interpreted. The Commission then added new definitions for those crimes serious enough to merit a 16-level enhancement, including the crime of violence definition at issue in this case. It is clear that the Commission intended these definitions to have different meanings because it drafted a new crime of violence definition, retained the prior aggravated felony definition, and assigned different sentence enhancements to each definition. Thus, the court\u2019s opinion counteracts the Commission\u2019s efforts by relying on the Chapa-Garza definition of use, which interprets a statutory definition that the revised structure of the guidelines indicates does not have the same meaning as the crime of violence definition in this case.\nWithout a mens rea element inappropriately added to the term \u201cuse\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, it becomes clear that Vargas-Duran\u2019s underlying conviction for felony intoxication assault is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the 16-level enhancement in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Intoxication assault punishes a defendant if \u201cby accident or mistake ... while operating a motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated, by reason of that intoxication causes serious bodily injury to another.\u201d Tex. Penal Code ANN. \u00a7 49.07(a)(1) (Vernon 1994). \u201cSerious bodily injury\u201d is defined as \u201cinjury that creates a substantial risk of death or that causes serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 49.07(b) (Vernon 1994).\nIntoxication assault involves the use of force. As the Eighth Circuit recently recognized in an automobile homicide case, \u201cuse of force\u201d involves two components\u2014 use and force. Gonzalez-Lopez, 335 F.3d at 798-99. An automobile by its very nature embodies force. Id. (citing Omar v. I.N.S., 298 F.3d 710, 717 (8th Cir.2002) (\u201c[A] vehicle can exert considerable physical force because of its structure, weight and capacity for motion and velocity.\u201d)). Furthermore, the drunk driver is clearly using and employing the force embodied in the motor vehicle by operating it. Gonzalez-Lopez, 335 F.3d at 799. Finally, the state intoxication assault statute ties the drunk driver\u2019s use together with the force of the automobile through its requirement that the \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d result from the driver\u2019s intoxication \u201cwhile operating the motor vehicle.\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 49.07 (Vernon 1994). Cf. Gonzalez-Lopez, 335 F.3d at 799 (holding that a statute\u2019s requirement that a driver cause the death of another \u201cties the use of physical force [of the automobile] with the requirement that the force be used against another person\u201d).\nThe actions punished by the intoxication assault statute involve instances where the defendant drove his car while drunk and hit a pedestrian, another vehicle, or a stationary object causing serious bodily harm to another. In the hands of a drunk, a motor vehicle is as likely to inflict physical force as a firearm.7 There are no Texas *616state law cases where intoxication assault was prosecuted and actual force was not used to cause the injury.8 Even Vargas-Duran admitted in his briefs to this Court that he could not find any Texas intoxication assault case that did not involve one of these scenarios. The most attenuated intoxication assault fact pattern actually prosecuted was the situation where a drunk driver ran his car into a parked vehicle, and the parked vehicle then struck a small child causing serious injuries. See Gonzalez v. Texas, No. 14-9900853-CR, 2000 WL 1721159, at *1 (Tex.App.Houston [14th Dist.] Oct. 12, 2000, no pet.) (not designated for publication). Clearly, even in this situation the defendant used force to cause physical harm. The Texas intoxication assault statute punishes an intoxicated driver for causing serious bodily injury to another by reason of their operation of a motor vehicle, thus the statute fulfills the \u201cuse of force\u201d requirement and is a crime of violence for purposes of the 16-level enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.\nIn summary, this Court\u2019s decision abrogates the Sentencing Commission\u2019s authority, properly delegated by Congress, to establish the mens rea required for each sentencing guideline. The Sentencing Commission could have included the mens rea element of intent in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, but the language of that guideline indicates that it did not choose to do so. Moreover, the court\u2019s decision contradicts the rationale of our prior cases interpreting the Sentencing Guidelines. Accordingly, I respectfully DISSENT.\n\n. I recognize that there exists an intermediate 12-level enhancement for felony drug trafficking offenses that carry a sentence exceeding 13 months; however, for the purposes of our inquiiy in Vargas-Duran, I have not included this relatively straightforward enhancement in my discussion.\n\n\n. There is confusion among the circuit courts regarding the mens rea requirements for \"use of force.\u201d Compare United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 335 F.3d 793, 798-99 (8th Cir.2003) (holding that \"crime of violence\u201d under the 2001 version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 contains no volitional element); Park v. I.N.S., 252 F.3d 1018, 1021-23 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(a) and (b) does not require specific intent); Tapia Garcia v. I.N.S., 237 F.3d 1216, 1222-23 (10th Cir.2001) (similar holding); United States v. Santana-Garcia, 211 F.3d 1271, No. 98-2235, 2000 WL 491510, at *2-3 (6th Cir. Apr. 18, 2000) (unpublished) (similar holding); Le v. U.S. Attorney Gen., 196 F.3d 1352, 1354 (11th Cir.1999) (similar holding); with Bazan-Reyes v. INS, 256 F.3d 600, 608-12 (7th Cir.2001) (relying on definition of \"use\u201d as an intentional act to hold that state crimes of DWI and homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle were not \"crimes of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b)); Dalton v. Ashcroft, 257 F.3d 200, 206-08 (2d Cir.2001) (holding that \u201cuse\u201d is an intentional act); United States v. Parson, 955 F.2d 858, 866 (3d Cir.1992) (similar holding).\n\n\n. The complete text of the 2001 version of \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s crime of violence definition for purposes of subsection (b)(1) is:\n\"Crime of violence\u201d\u2014\n(I) means an offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; and (II) includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex of-*611lenses (including sexual abuse of a minor), robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling.\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n.l(B)(ii) (2001).\n\n\n. See also U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(3) (\"If the defendant knew, believed, or had reason to believe that a passport or visa was to be used to facilitate the commission of a felony offense ... \u201d) (emphasis added); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.3(b)(2) (\"If the offense involved any explosive material that the defendant knew or had reason to believe was stolen ...\") (emphasis added); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.3(b)(3) (\"If the defendant used or possessed ... any explosive material with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense ...\") (emphasis added); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.3(c)(1) (\"If defendant ... possessed or transferred any explosive material with knowledge or intent that it would be used or possessed in connection with another offense ...\u201d) (emphasis added); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.4(a)(l) (\"[I]f the offense (A) created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to any person ..., and that risk was created knowingly ...\u201d) (emphasis added); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.4(c)(1) (\"If ... the offense was intended to cause death or serious bodily injury ...\u201d) (emphasis added); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.5(b)(1) (\"If the offense was committed willfully and without regard for the safety of human life, or with reckless disregard for the safety of human life ...\") (emphasis added); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.5(a)(3) (\"If ... he acted with mere negligence ...\u201d) (emphasis added).\n\n\n. The court's opinion claims \u201cwe would effectively nullify the state of mind required by 'attempted use' and 'threatened use' \u201d in the \u00a7 2L1.2 crime of violence definition by not reading a mens rea requirement into the meaning of the term use because \"attempt and threat require intent.\u201d An \"attempted use\u201d or \"threatened use\u201d of force is a discrete action and by definition is not the \"use\u201d of force. As the definitions cited in the court's opinion indicate, \"intent\u201d is specifically included in the terms \"attempt\u201d and \"threat.\u201d See Black's Law Dictionary 127 (6th ed. 1990) (defining attempt as \"[a]n intent to commit a crime couple with an act taken toward committing the offense\u201d) (emphasis added); Black's Law Dictionary 1480 (6th ed. 1990)(de-fining threat as \"a communicated intent to inflict physical or other harm on any person or property\u201d) (emphasis added). Intent, however, is not specifically included in the verb \"use\u201d itself. The absence of a mens rea associated with the \"use of force\u201d does not mean force cannot be used intentionally, rather it means that force can be used negligently, recklessly, or intentionally. See, e.g., Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 49.07(a)(1) (Vernon 1994) (defining Texas intoxication assault as the situation where a defendant \"by accident or mistake ... while operating a motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated, by reason of that intoxication causes serious bodily injury to another.\u201d)\n\n\n. Section 16 and \u00a7 2L1.2 are two of the eight versions of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d definition in the United States Code and in the United States Sentencing Guidelines. See United *614States v. Charles, 301 F.3d 309, 316 (5th Cir.2002) (en banc) (DeMoss J. concurring). These crime of violence definitions usually have a similar two part structure. Like \u00a7 16 and \u00a7 2L1.2, the first part usually contains some version of the \"use, attempted use, or threatened use of [] force\" language with slight modifications. The second part differs among the definitions, modifying the first part in varying ways. Some of \"these definitions cure closed-ended and self-contained; and others of these definitions have catch-all clauses which invite speculation.\u201d Id. Guideline 2L1.2 is an example of the category of definitions where the second part is closed-ended while \u00a7 16(b) is an example of a second part containing a catch-all clause inviting speculation. Accordingly, the purpose of the \"use of force\" language in the first part of the \u00a7 2L1.2 definition is different from the language in the second part of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. Relying upon Chapa-Garza in this case ignores the purpose served by the separate components of a crime of violence definition. Although the confusion caused by these various definitions is regrettable, \"blame for this state of disarray falls squarely on the shoulders of Congress ... and on the Sentencing Commission,\u201d and \"[i]t is not the task of the Judicial Branch to say which of these varying definitions the Congress intended to be controlling; nor is it the task of the Judicial Branch to make specific what Congress has failed to specify.\u201d Charles, 301 F.3d at 316.\n\n\n. Based upon the rationale of Chapa-Gana, it is even more appropriate to distinguish the 2001 \u00a7 2L1.2 crime of violence definition from the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 crime of violence definition because there are more significant differences between these definitions than between those considered in Chapa-Garza itself. Specifically, the language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a), which Chapa-Garza distinguished, is closer to that of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 than 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 is to the language of the crime of violence definition in the 2001 version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n.l(B)(ii)(II). But see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2) (including within the definition, in addition to the listed crimes, other crimes which \"present[] a serious risk of physical injury\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) (including within the definition additional crimes involving a \"substantial risk that physical force ... may be used,\u201d and not listing any specific offenses).\n\n\n. \"Alcohol-involved crashes resulted in 16,-792 fatalities, 513,000 nonfatal injuries, and $50.9 billion in economic costs in 2000, accounting for 22 percent of all crash costs.\u201d *616Lawrence J.

Vargas-Duran\u2019s conviction is the quintessential Texas intoxication assault case. Vargas-Duran was driving while intoxicated, struck a pedestrian who was attempting to cross the street, and fled the scene. Thus Vargas-Duran caused the precise harm the Texas intoxication assault statute seeks to avoid. By striking a pedestrian with a motor vehicle Vargas-Duran certainly used force to cause a serious bodily injury.\n\n",

GARZA and CLEMENT, Circuit Judges, and HUDSPETH*, District Judge.\n\nEMILIO M. GARZA, Circuit Judge:\n\n       Enrique Vargas-Duran appeals the district court\u2019s determination that his Texas conviction for\n\nintoxication assault was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the 16-level sentencing enhancement\n\nunder \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the 2001 version of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Vargas-\n\n\n\n\n       *\n           District Judge of the Western District of Texas, sitting by designation.\n\fDuran contends that, in light of our decision in United States v. Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d 921 (5th Cir.\n\n2001), his prior conviction for intoxication assault is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7\n\n2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) because it does not have as an element the intentional use of force against a\n\nperson.1 We disagree.\n\n       Vargas-Duran, a citizen of Mexico, was discovered in the United States after being arrested\n\nfor driving while intoxicated. He had previously been deported following Texas felony convictions\n\nfor burglary of a vehicle and intoxication assault. Vargas-Duran pled guilty to being unlawfully\n\npresent in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). At sentencing, he objected\n\nto the categorization of his 1996 intoxication assault conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for the\n\npurpo ses of the 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the 2001 version of the\n\nSentencing Guidelines. The district court overruled the objectio n and sentenced him to sixty-four\n\nmonths of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.\n\n       We follow both the Sentencing Guidelines and their accompanying policy statements. See\n\nUnited States v. Urias-Escobar, 281 F.3d 165, 167 (5th Cir. 2002) (citing Mistretta v. United States,\n\n488 U.S. 361, 391 (1989), and Williams v. United States, 503 U.S. 193, 199-201 (1992)). In\n\n\n       1\n           Vargas-Duran also contends, solely for the purpose of preserving the issue for further\nappeal, that the \u201caggravated felony\u201d provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is unconstitutional in the\nwake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000). He concedes\nthat this argument is foreclosed by Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998), which\nApprendi expressly declined to overrule. See Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 489-90 (\u201cEven though it is\narguable that Almendarez-Torres was incorrect ly decided, and that a logical application of our\nreasoning today should apply if the recidivist issue were contested, Apprendi does not contest the\ndecision\u2019s validity and we need not revisit it for purposes of our decision today . . . .\u201d) (footnote\nomitted).

See id. (citing Stinson v. United States, 508\n\nU.S. 36, 42-45 (1993)). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the\n\nSentencing Guidelines de novo. United States v. Charles, 301 F.3d 309, 312-13 (5th Cir. 2002) (en\n\nbanc).\n\n         Under the 2001 version of \u00a7 2L1.2, a prior offense qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for\n\npurposes of the 16-level sentencing enhancement if it is either \u201can offense under federal, state, or local\n\nlaw that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\n\nperson of another\u201d or an offense enumerated in Application Note 1(B)(ii)(II). U.S. SENTENCING\n\nGUIDELINES MANUAL (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d), \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n.1(B)(ii); see United States v. Rayo-Valdez, 302\n\nF.3d 314, 316 (5th Cir. 2002) (\u201cThe language of \u00a7 2L1.2 says that \u2018crime of violence\u2019 means that\n\nwhich is in subparagraph I, and includes that which is in subparagraph II.\u201d).2 Because intoxication\n\nassault is not one of the offenses enumerated in Application Note 1(B)(ii)(II), it is a \u201ccrime of\n\nviolence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) only if it \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or\n\nthreatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d Rayo-Valdez, 302 F.3d at 316. We\n\nneed not discuss the facts underlying Vargas-Duran\u2019s prior conviction, since we \u201clook only to the fact\n\nof conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense\u201d to determine whether a prior conviction\n\nqualifies as a predicate offense for sentencing enhancement purposes. Taylor v. United States, 495\n\nU.S. 575, 602 (1990). \u201cCongress did not intend sentencing hearings to become retrials of the\n\nunderlying conduct involved in the defendant\u2019s prior federal or state convictions.\u201d United States v.\n\n\n         2\n          These offenses are \u201cmurder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex\noffenses (including sexual abuse of a minor), robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of\ncredit, and burglary of a dwelling.\u201d U.S.S.G., \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n.1(B)(ii).\n\n                                                   -3-\n\fVelazquez-Overa, 100 F.3d 418, 421 (5th Cir. 1996).\n\n       Because the Texas offense of intoxication assault requires proof that an intoxicated offender\n\n\u201ccause[] serious bodily injury to another,\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 49.07 (Vernon 1994),3 we\n\nconclude that it has as an element the use of force against the person of another. Clearly, the\n\nrequirement that the offender \u201ccause[] serious bodily injury\u201d encompasses a requirement that the\n\noffender use force to cause that injury. Vargas-Duran has not demonstrated that an offender could\n\nbe convicted under \u00a7 49.07 for causing \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d without actually using physical force\n\nagainst a person. We have not found any Texas decision in which an offender caused serious bodily\n\ninjury without using force. In Gonzalez v. Texas, 2000 WL 1721159 (Tex. App.))Houston [1st\n\nDist.] Oct. 12, 2000, no pet.), the only decision cited by Vargas-Duran in support of his argument,\n\nthe Texas Court of Appeals affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction for intoxication assault where he\n\ndrove his vehicle into a parked car, which in turn struck a child standing nearby. Id. at *1. Contrary\n\nto Vargas-Duran\u2019s contention, the defendant in Gonzalez clearly used force, albeit indirectly, against\n\nthe person of another. Because causing \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d qualifies as using force, we conclude\n\nthat intoxication assault as defined by the 1994 version of \u00a7 49.07 is a crime of violence for purposes\n\nof the 16-level enhancement under Application Note 1(B)(ii)(I) to the 2001 version of \u00a7 2L1.2.4\n\n\n       3\n          Under the version of \u00a7 49.07 of the Texas Penal Code in effect at the time of Vargas-\nDuran\u2019s conviction, a defendant is guilty of a third degree felony if he or she \u201cby accident or mistake,\nwhile operating an aircraft, watercraft, or motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated, by reason\nof that intoxication cause[d] serious bodily injury to another.\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 49.07\n(Vernon 1994). Fo llowing Vargas-Duran\u2019s conviction, \u00a7 49.07 was amended to include serious\nbodily injuries caused by operating or assembling an amusement ride while intoxicated. TEX. PENAL\nCODE ANN. \u00a7 49.07 (Vernon Supp. 2003). This revision does not apply to the instant matter, nor\ndoes it affect our analysis.\n       4\n        The dissent posits that this conclusion is in conflict with our decision in United States v.\nGracia-Cantu, 302 F.3d 308 (5th Cir. 2002). We perceive no conflict, however, because Gracia-\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f        Vargas-Duran contends that, because his prior conviction does not have as an element the\n\nintentional use of physical force, it is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii).\n\nIn support of his position, Vargas-Duran relies on our decision in United States v. Chapa-Garza, 243\n\nF.3d 921 (5th Cir. 2001), in which we applied a categorical approach and held that a Texas felony\n\nconviction for driving while intoxicated (DWI) was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b)\n\nbecause the offense did not involve \u201crecklessness as regards the substantial likelihood that the\n\noffender will intentionally employ force against the person or property of another in order to\n\neffectuate the commission of the offense.\u201d 243 F.3d at 927.\n\n        Perhaps the obvious should be stated first: Chapa-Garza did not apply the current version of\n\n\u00a7 2L1.2. Section 2L1.2 was substantially revised after we decided Chapa-Garza, and the definition\n\nof \u201ccrime of violence\u201d at issue in Chapa-Garza is not the same as the definition at issue here. See\n\nUnited States v. Caicedo-Cuero, 312 F.3d 697, 709-11 (5th Cir. 2002) (discussing the 2001\n\n\n\nCantu, which was decided under the prior version of \u00a7 2L1.2, stated only that:\n                Gracia-Cantu persuasively argues that his prior offense does not\n                constitute a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a) because section\n                22.04(a) of the Texas Penal Code, the statute criminalizing injury to\n                a child, does not require that the perpetrator actually use, attempt to\n                use, or threaten to use physical force against a child. Rather, section\n                22.04(a) is results-oriented in that the culpable mental state must\n                relate to the result of a defendant's conduct rather than to the conduct\n                itself. The government concedes that, because the statutory definition\n                of the offense does not explicitly require the application of force as an\n                element, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a) does not apply to Gracia-Cantu\u2019s offense\n                of injury to a child. Accordingly, we need not consider the issue\n                further.\n302 F.3d at 311-12 (citation omitted). Importantly, in this case the Government does not concede\nthat \u00a7 49.07 does not require the application of force as an element of the offense. Thus, the 16-level\nenhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2, according to the Government, applies to the Texas offense of\nintoxication assault.\n\n                                                  -5-\n\famendments to \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d). Section 16(b), from which Chapa-Garza\n\ngleaned a state of mind requirement, 243 F.3d at 925-27, no longer applies for purposes of the 16-\n\nlevel enhancement.5\n\n       Second, unlike intoxication assault, Texas felony DWI does not have as an element the use\n\nof force. \u201cThe crime of Texas felony DWI is committed when the defendant, after two prior DWI\n\nconvictions, begins operating a vehicle while intoxicated.\u201d Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d at 927. Third,\n\nChapa-Garza did not analyze the Texas felony DWI statute under \u00a7 16(a), the language of which is\n\nsimilar to Application Note 1(B)(ii)(I). Compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a) (covering any \u201coffense that has\n\nas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or\n\nproperty of another\u201d) with U.S.S.G., \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n.1(B)(ii) (covering any \u201coffense under federal,\n\nstate, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\n\nagainst the person of another\u201d). The analysis in Chapa-Garza was instead based on the catch-all\n\nlanguage o f \u00a7 16(b), which applies to \u201cany other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature,\n\ninvolves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used\n\nin the course of committing the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). In fact, Chapa-Garza noted that \u201c18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) is the only justification for the 16-level enhancement advanced by the government.\u201d\n\n\n\n       5\n          The pre-2001 version of \u00a7 2L1.2, which increased the base offense level by 16 for all prior\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d convictions, was replaced with a sliding scale of enhancements based on the\nseriousness of the prior conviction. See U.S.S.G., Supplement to Appendix C, Amendment 632, at\n222-25 (2001). The Sentencing Commission stated that this amendment responded to concerns that\n\u201cthe breadth of the definition of \u2018aggravated felony\u2019\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2 \u201csometimes results in\ndisproportionate penalties.\u201d Id. at 224. Significantly, the 2001 amendment to \u00a7 2L1.2 narrowed the\ndefinition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the 16-level enhancement by replacing the definition\nin \u00a7 16 with that in Application Note 1(B)(ii). However, the amended application notes for \u00a7 2L1.2\nretain \u00a7 16\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the 8-level \u201caggravat ed felony\u201d\nenhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C).\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f243 F.3d at 924 (emphasis added). Chapa-Garza\u2019s analysis of \u00a7 16(b) would have been entirely\n\nunnecessary had the crime of Texas felony DWI contained as an element the \u201cuse of force,\u201d as does\n\nthe Texas crime of intoxication assault at issue in this case.\n\n       We do not agree that Chapa-Garza\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 16(b)\u2019s language applies in this\n\ncontext. As discussed above, unlike Texas felony DWI, intoxication assault has as an element the use\n\nof force, and therefore, unlike Chapa-Garza, we are not confined to analyzing whether this offense\n\nis a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the catch-all language of \u00a7 16(b). We question whether Chapa-Garza\n\nwould have read a state of mind requirement into the revised definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under\n\nApplication Note 1(B)(ii) to the 2001 version of \u00a7 2L1.2.6\n\n\n       6\n          Other circuits have read a state of mind requirement into \u00a7 4B1.2, which defines \u201ccrime of\nviolence\u201d as including offenses that have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\nphysical force against the person of another.\u201d See United States v. Rutherford, 54 F.3d 370, 372-74\n(7th Cir. 1995); United States v. Parson, 955 F.2d 858, 866 (3d Cir. 1992). Vargas-Duran urges us\nto apply this interpretation to the language of Application Note 1(B)(ii)(I). However, we have never\nread a state of mind requirement into \u00a7 4B1.2. We therefore decline to impose a state of mind\nrequirement in this context. Moreover, although Parson noted in unreasoned dicta that \u00a7 16(a)\n\u201crequires specific intent to use force,\u201d 955 F.2d at 866, this does not persuade us that we must read\na state of mind requirement into Application Note 1(B)(ii)(I). Courts have reached varying\ndeterminations regarding the necessity of a state of mind requirement under \u00a7 16. Compare United\nStates v. Trinidad-Acquino, 259 F.3d 1140, 1146 (9th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[T]he \u2018crime of violence\u2019\ndefinitions do not require an intentional use of force, but they do require a volitional act.\u201d), Dalton\nv. Ashcroft, 257 F.3d 200, 206-08 (2d Cir. 2001) (\u201cAlthough an accident may properly be said to\ninvolve force, one cannot be said to use force in an accident as one might use force to pry open a\nheavy, jammed door.\u201d (emphasis in original)), and Bazan-Reyes v. I.N.S., 256 F.3d 600, 609-11 (7th\nCir. 2001) (\u201c[O]ur finding that the word \u2018use\u2019 requires volitional conduct pro hibits a finding that\ndrunk driving is a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(a).\u201d) with Omar v. I.N.S., 298 F.3d 710, 720 (8th Cir.\n2002) (\u201cWe reject Omar\u2019s claim that \u00a7 16(b) requires an element of intent for a crime of violence and\nhis attempt to read more into the words \u2018may be used\u2019 than they can fairly support.\u201d), Tapia-Garcia\nv. I.N.S., 237 F.3d 1216, 1222-23 (10th Cir. 2001) (finding the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019\ndecision that \u201cthe statutory definition of crime of violence in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) does not require\nintentional conduct\u201d reasonable), and Le v. U.S. Attorney General, 196 F.3d 1352, 1354 (11th Cir.\n1999) (holding that prior conviction for causing serious bodily injury while driving under the influence\nwas a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 16(a) \u201cbecause one element of the offense includes the actual use\nof physical force\u201d).\n\n                                                  -7-\n\f       In light of the plain language of the revised guideline and its commentary, we decline to\n\nextend Chapa-Garza\u2019s state of mind requirement. Nothing in the amended version of \u00a7 2L1.2 or its\n\ncommentary indicates that the use of force must be intentional for a prior offense to qualify as a\n\n\u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the 16-level enhancement. We must assume that the Sentencing\n\nCommission was aware of our holding in Chapa-Garza when it amended \u00a7 2L1.2 and would have\n\nexplicitly incorporated a state of mind requirement had it intended to do so. It did not.7 Absent\n\nexplicit direction, we will not read a state of mind requirement into the guideline. See United States\n\nv. Fry, 51 F.3d 543, 546 (5th Cir. 1995) (holding that, where \u201cthe language of section 2K2.1(a)(3)\n\nmakes no reference to the defendant\u2019s mental state,\u201d \u201c[t]he section is plain on its face and should not\n\n. . . be read to imply a scienter requirement.\u201d); cf. United States v. Myers, 104 F.3d 76, 81 (5th Cir.\n\n1997) (\u201cAs a straightforward matter of textual interpretation, we will not presume that a statutory\n\ncrime requires specific intent in the absence of language to that effect.\u201d).8\n\n\n       7\n          We also note that the Sentencing Commission did not include a catch-all provision similar\nto \u00a7 16(b) in the revised definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for the 16-level enhancement. Although\nthe dissent reasons that the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in Application Note 1(B)(ii)(I) is a\nstronger candidate for imposing a state of mind requirement than that in \u00a7 16(b), only the broad\ncatch-all language of \u00a7 16(b) requires narrowing. The dissent\u2019s reliance on dicta in a footnote in Park\nv. I.N.S., 252 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 2001), is misplaced as Park rejected Chapa-Garza\u2019s holding. Id.\nat 1024 n.7 (concluding that \u201c\u00a7 16(b) . . . does not require that force be used intentionally.\u201d).\n       8\n        Although the dissent posits that the words \u201cuse of physical force\u201d should have the same\nmeaning under all of the definitions of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d incorporated by \u00a7 2L1.2, the panel in\nCaicedo-Cuero correctly noted:\n\n               Although rendering the guideline less clear than is desirable, \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s\n               implication of two distinct definitions of drug trafficking crimes is\n               neither repugnant to principles of statutory construction nor\n               inconsistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s prior practice.\n               Looking to a parallel situation within \u00a7 2L1.2, relating to the dual\n               definitions of \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d we note that the Sentencing\n               Commission\u2019s practice of incorporating multiple definitions of the\n\n                                                  -8-\n\f       Because the Texas crime of intoxication assault has as an element the use of force against the\n\nperson of another, we conclude that the district court did not err in imposing the 16-level\n\nenhancement. We therefore AFFIRM the sentence imposed by the district court.9\n\n\n\nENDRECORD\n\n\n\n\n               same term is, it turns out, not new.\n\n312 F.3d at 708-09.\n       9\n          Vargas-Duran also contends that his intoxication assault and burglary convictions are not\n\u201caggravated felonies\u201d for purposes of the 8-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). Because the\ndistrict court correctly determined that the 16-level enhancement applied to the intoxication assault\nconviction, it never reached these arguments. Thus, we need not address this contention on appeal.\n\n                                                -9-\n\fEDITH BROWN CLEMENT, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n\n\n   Two reasonable propositions underlie the majority\u2019s decision: first, that one can use force against\n\nanother without intending to use that force; and second, that a criminal statute\u2019s requirement that the\n\ndefendant cause serious bodily harm also encompasses the requirement that the defendant use force\n\nto bring about the harm. Both premises are contrary to settled precedent. I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                     I. Conflict with Chapa-Garza\n\n   The majority concludes that it is possible for a crime to \u201cha[ve] as an element the use, attempted\n\nuse, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\u201d U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES\n\nMANUAL \u00a7 2L1.2 application note 1(B)(ii)(I) (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d), even where the crime does not require\n\nthe defendant to have intentionally used force. That conclusion collides with this Court\u2019s decision\n\nin United States v. Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d 921 (5th Cir. 2001), which held that a Texas felony DWI\n\nconviction was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of a neighboring Sentencing Guidelines\n\nsubsection, also involving the interpretation of using physical force against another. We stated:\n\n   The criterion that the defendant use physical force against the person or property of another\n   is most reasonably read to refer to intentional conduct, not an accidental, unintended event.\n   THE AMERICAN HERITAGE COLLEGE DICTIONARY (3rd ed. 1997) defines the verb \u201cuse\u201d as:\n\n       \u201c1. To put into service or apply for a purpose; employ. 2. To avail oneself of;\n       practice: use caution. 3. To conduct oneself toward; treat or handle: used his\n       colleagues well. 4. To seek or achieve an end by means of; exploit: felt he was being\n       used. 5. To take or consume; partake of: She rarely used alcohol\u201d\n   The four relevant definitions indicate that \u201cuse\u201d refers to volitional, purposeful, not\n   accidental, employment of whatever is being \u201cused\u201d.\n\nId. at 926 (emphasis in original).

In fact, \u00a7 2L1.2 is almost identical to \u00a7 16(b)\u2019s\n\nneighbor, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a).11\n\n   Although \u00a7 16(b) is different (it only covers felonies, for instance), the dispositive language in\n\nChapa-Garza was substantially identical to the language at issue here. The Chapa-Garza panel\n\nfocused only on the phrase \u201cphysical force against the person or property of another may be used\u201d;\n\nhere, we are focused only on the phrase \u201cuse of physical force against the person of another.\u201d I see\n\nno difference between the two, except that the former pertains to property, as well as persons.\n\n\n       10\n          The issue in Chapa-Garza was whether the prior offense was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for\npurposes of a 16-level enhancement under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2. 243 F.3d at 923. The definition of\n\u201caggravated felony\u201d ultimately pointed to, among other things, the statutory definition of \u201ccrime of\nviolence\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. Id. In 2001, the \u201caggravated felony\u201d enhancement was reduced to eight\nlevels, instead of 16, but the same definition applies. See U.S.S.G. app. C, comment to amend. 632\n(2001).\n       11\n         Section 16(a) defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as an \u201coffense that has as an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d\n(Emphasis added). The \u201cor property\u201d language is the only difference between the definitions.\nCf. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2.L1.2 application note 1(B)(ii)(I).\n\n                                                 -11-\n\f    Considering the substantially identical phrasing, it is surprising that the majority \u201cquestion[s]\n\nwhether Chapa-Garza would have read a state of mind requirement into the revised definition of\n\n\u2018crime of violence\u2019\u201d in \u00a7 2L1.2. Maj. Op. at ___. The Chapa-Garza panel, referencing a dictionary,\n\ndetermined the ordinary meaning of the use of physical force against another without looking to any\n\nof the neighboring language that might distinguish the context of \u00a7 2L1.2. It is specious to suppose\n\nthat had the Chapa-Garza panel been faced with the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d definition in \u00a7 2L1.2, the\n\nCourt would have referenced a different dictionary (perhaps Judge Barksdale\u2019s) to define \u201cuse.\u201d Even\n\nmore telling, the Chapa-Garza panel quotes with approval an excerpt from a Third Circuit case\n\nstating that \u201c[u]se of physical force is an intentional act\u201d for purposes of the nearly identical \u00a7 16(a).\n\n243 F.3d at 926 (quoting United States v. Parson, 955 F.2d 858, 866 (3d Cir. 1993)).\n\n    Even if it were possible to distinguish \u00a7 2L1.2 and \u00a7 16(b) with respect to the meaning of use of\n\nforce against another, \u00a7 2L1.2 is a much stronger candidate for the intentionality requirement,\n\nimplying that, a fortiori, Chapa-Garza should control. First, \u00a7 2L1.2 examines the defendant\u2019s state\n\nof mind directly, whereas \u00a7 16(b), in the passive voice (\u201cmay be used in the course of committing the\n\noffense\u201d) focuses on the nature of the felony. See Park v. INS, 252 F.3d 1018, 1024 n.7 (9th Cir.\n\n2001) (explaining the possible difference between \u00a7 16(a) and \u00a7 16(b) with respect to intent). Second,\n\nunlike \u00a7 16(b), \u00a7 2L1.2 covers threatened and attempted uses of force. Since attempts and threats can\n\nonly be intentional, see BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 123, 1489 (7th ed. 1999), their grouping\n\nalongside the actual use of force suggests that \u00a7 2L1.2 was meant to address intentional acts only.\n\nSee United States v. Rutherford, 54 F.3d 370, 373 (7th Cir. 1995) (making the same point with\n\nrespect to Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2). Third, the enhancement referencing \u00a7 16(b)\u2019s \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is\n\nonly eight levels, whereas the \u00a7 2L1.2 \u201ccrime of violence\u201d definition is 16 levels. Compare U.S.SG.\n\n\n                                                  -12-\n\f\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). Thus, if only one of either \u00a7 2L1.2 or \u00a7 16(b)\n\nought to require intent, it is the former, not the latter. Today\u2019s decision brings about precisely the\n\nopposite result.\n\n   Turning an ordinary statutory construction principle on its head, the majority relies on the fact\n\nthat the Sentencing Commission recently revised \u00a7 2L1.2\u2014but without explicitly incorporating the\n\nChapa-Garza gloss\u2014to suggest the Sentencing Commission intended to repudiate Chapa-Garza.\n\nIt was the prevailing view of the courts of appeals at the time of the 2001 amendments that the use\n\nof physical force against another was limited to intentional use, for purposes of determining whether\n\na crime was a crime of violence. See Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d at 926; Rutherford, 54 F.3d at 372-73\n\n(holding drunk driving assault not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1(a)(1)); Parson, 955\n\nF.2d at 866 (noting that use of force is an intentional act for \u00a7 16(a) purposes). In Rutherford, for\n\nexample, t he Seventh Circuit interpreted Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2, which is substantially identical to \u00a7\n\n2L1.2, as requiring the intentional use of force:\n\n   Force is exerted in many instances where it is not employed for any particular purpose. For\n   example, earthquakes and avalanches involve the exertion of a tremendous amount of force.\n   Such disasters, however, are freaks of nature; we can identify no intelligence or purpose\n   behind them. Referring to a randomly occurring avalanche as a \u201cuse\u201d of force would torture\n   the English language. Likewise, a drunk driving accident is not the result of plan, direction,\n   or purpose but of recklessness at worst and misfortune at best. A drunk driver who injures\n   a pedestrian would not describe the incident by saying he \u201cused\u201d his car to hurt someone. In\n   ordinary English, the word \u201cuse\u201d implies intentional availment.\n\n54 F.3d at 372-73 (footnote omitted). Against the backdrop of Chapa-Garza, Rutherford, and\n\nParson, and with zero cases to the contrary, it is unthinkable that the Sentencing Commission would\n\nhave expected that the phrase \u201cuse of physical force against the person of another\u201d to be interpreted\n\nas the majority has interpreted the phrase. This common sense observation is analogous to the familiar\n\n\n\n                                                -13-\n\fstatutory interpretation principle that \u201c\u2018Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or\n\njudicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without\n\nchange.\u2019\u201d Meryll Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. J.J. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 382 n.66 (1982)\n\n(quoting Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 414 n.8 (1975)); see also Cannon v. Univ.\n\nof Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 696-97 (1979) (holding a private right of action under Title IX because,\n\nwhen enacted, the courts had already construed the critical language to have created one).\n\n    A recent case, United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, 312 F.3d 697, 706-11 (5th Cir. 2002), illustrates\n\nthis principle, coincidentally, in the context of Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2. Caicedo-Cuero argued that, with\n\nthe 2001 amendments, the guideline definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d was intended to\n\nsupersede the broader statutory definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d even though one subdivision\n\nof \u00a7 2L1.2 explicitly referenced the statute, instead of the guideline definition. Id. at 708. Caicedo-\n\nCuero emphasized the peculiarity that, in imposing the enhancement he received, \u201ca court would have\n\nto find that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction both is and is not a drug trafficking offense.\u201d Id.\n\n(emphasis in original).12 In rejecting the argument, the Court pointed out that the same peculiarity\n\nexists with respect to the multiple definitions of \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d citing (coincidentally) Chapa-\n\nGarza. Id. at 707-11. The Court emphasized that the Sentencing Commission apparently approved\n\nof the peculiarity: \u201cWe presume that the sentencing Commission had knowledge of this practice when\n\nit drafted the 2001 amendments.\u201d Id. at 710.\n\n    Moreover, the notes accompanying the 2001 amendments to \u00a7 2L1.2 explicitly state that the\n\n\n        12\n          Caicedo-Cuero received an eight-level sentencing enhancement for having been convicted\nof an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2; in particular, he had committed a \u201cdrug\ntrafficking offense\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Id. at 706. Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 contains a\nseparate 12-point enhancement for having been convicted of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d as defined\nmore narrowly in the guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 (2001).\n\n                                                  -14-\n\famendments are intended to render moot an unrelated circuit split, see U.S.S.G. app. C, comment\n\nto amend. 632 (2001), furt her suggesting that the Sentencing Commission was aware of judicial\n\ninterpretations but chose not to change them. Since Chapa-Garza, courts have adopted its\n\ninterpretation of use of physical force with respect to \u00a7 16(a), a statute which, again, is virtually\n\nidentical to the \u00a7 2L1.2 definition. See United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, 259 F.3d 1140, 1145 (9th\n\nCir. 2001) (\u201c[T]he presence of the volitional \u2018use . . . against\u2019 requirement in both prongs of 18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 16 means that a defendant cannot commit a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 if he negligently\u2014rather\n\nthan intentionally or recklessly\u2014hits someone or something with a physical object.\u201d); Bazan-Reyes\n\nv. INS, 256 F.3d 600, 609 (7th Cir. 2001) (\u201cAlthough a conviction for homicide by intoxicated use\n\nof a vehicle requires that the offender actually hit someone, it does not require that he intentionally\n\nused force to achieve that result. . .[t]herefore, application of \u00a7 16(a) to [defendant\u2019s] conviction is\n\nforeclosed. . . .); cf. Dalton v. Ashcroft, 257 F.3d 200, 206 (2d Cir. 2001) (requiring intent under \u00a7\n\n16(b)).\n\n   The practical result of today\u2019s decision is that the government need not show the intentional use\n\nof force for a prior offense to qualify for the 16-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement, but the\n\ngovernment would be required to show the intentional use of force when an eight-level enhancement\n\nis sought under the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d definition in \u00a7 16(b).13 In other words, a higher showing of\n\nintentionality is now required to receive the lesser enhancement. Not only is that a confusing and\n\n\n\n          13\n         The eight-level increase for having committed an \u201caggravated felony\u201d eventually points to\nthe \u201ccrime of violence\u201d definition in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. See U.S.S.C. \u00a7 2L1.2 appl ication note 2\n(defining \u201caggravated felony\u201d by reference to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)); see also 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1101(a)(43)(F) (defining \u201caggravated felony\u201d as, among other things, a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 16). When Chapa-Garza was decided, the \u201caggravated felony\u201d increase was 16 levels,\ninstead of eight. See U.S.S.G. app. C, comment to amend. 632 (2001).\n\n                                                 -15-\n\fbackwards result, the signal it sends to the bench and bar is that the same statutory words used in the\n\nsame context cannot be expected to be interpreted alike if the words appear in different sections.\n\n   Finally, today\u2019s holding will multiply the irrationality of having several definitions of \u201ccrime of\n\nviolence\u201d scattered throughout the U.S. Code and Sentencing Guidelines. See United States v.\n\nCharles, 301 F.3d 309, 315-16 (5th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (DeMoss, J., specially concurring). By my\n\ncount, there are no less than sixteen instances where the use of physical force against another\n\nphrasing is used in various definitions in different contexts. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 (\u201ccrime of violence\u201d);\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(c)(2) (\u201ccriminal street gang\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(1)(33)(A) (\u201cmisdemeanor crime of\n\ndomestic violence\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(d)(8)(B)(ii) (to whom it is prohibited to sell firearms); 18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) (who is prohibited from shipping, transporting, or possessing firearms); 18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3) (\u201ccrime of violence\u201d in firearms offense penalties); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\n\n(\u201cviolent felony\u201d in firearms offense penalties); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3156 (a)(4) (\u201ccrime of violence\u201d in\n\nrelease and detention procedures); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 373 (\u201csolicitation to commit a crime of violence\u201d);\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559 (\u201cserious violent felony\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5032 (when a juvenile may be subject to\n\ncriminal prosecution); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 540A(c)(1) (\u201cfelony crime of violence\u201d for travelers); 21st Century\n\nDepartment of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 107-273, \u00a7 2953, 116 Stat.\n\n1758, 1795-95 (2002) (\u201cviolent offender\u201d in law enforcement appropriations); FED. R. CRIM P. 32\n\n(\u201ccrime of violence or sexual abuse\u201d in sentencing procedures); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.1(b) (specific offense\n\ncharact eristics of sex crimes); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 application note 1(B)(ii) (\u201ccrime of violence\u201d for\n\nspecific offense charact eristics of unlawfully remaining or entering the United States); U.S.S.G. \u00a7\n\n4B1.2(a) (\u201ccrime of violence\u201d in career offender provision). Today\u2019s decision sends mixed signals to\n\nthe bench and bar as to the proper interpretation of those provisions. At the very least, the phrasing\n\n\n                                                 -16-\n\fuse of physical force against another should be interpreted the same under the various definitions\n\nof \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the Sentencing Guidelines. Today\u2019s decision calls into question even\n\nthat most basic coherence.\n\n                                     II. Conflict with Gracia-Cantu\n\n   In United States v. Gracia-Cantu, this Court held that the Texas crime of causing injury to a child\n\nwas not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)\u2014 again, which is virtually identical to the \u00a7\n\n2L1.2 definition\u2014because the \u201cresults-oriented\u201d crime does not have as an element the use of force\n\nagainst a person. 302 F.3d 308, 311-12 (5th Cir. 2002). We stated:\n\n   Gracia-Cantu persuasively argues that his prior offense does not constitute a crime of violence\n   under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a) because section 22.04(a) of the Texas Penal Code, the statute\n   criminalizing injury to a child, does not require that the perpetrator actually use, attempt to\n   use, or threaten to use physical force against a child. Rather, section 22.04(a) is\n   results-oriented in that the culpable mental state must relate to the result of a defendant\u2019s\n   conduct rather than to the conduct itself.\n\nId. Vargas-Duran was convicted of intoxication assault, which, just like the injury to a child statute,\n\nis \u201cresults-oriented.\u201d Compare TEXAS PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 49.07 (Vernon 1994) (intoxication\n\nassault) with TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.04(a) (Vernon 2002) (injury to a child). That is, neither\n\nstatute mentions using force; both penalize causing injury. Id.\n\n   One possible distinction between the statutes is that it is easy to imagine cases where a child is\n\ninjured without force (neglect, for instance), but it is a bit more difficult to imagine cases where a\n\ndrunk driver causes serious bodily injury without force. Surely most intoxication assault prosecutions\n\ninvolve a collision, and hence, some force. Nevertheless, the statute does not require that the\n\ndefendant use force. For instance, if a drunk driver swerves off the road, causing a pedestrian to dive\n\ninto a ditch and become seriously injured, the Texas statute is doubtlessly violated, even though there\n\n\n\n                                                 -17-\n\fhas been no actual application of force to anyone. Consider also the case where a drunk driver\u2019s near\n\nmiss causes a heart attack. In this respect, today\u2019s decision cannot be squared with Gracia-Cantu.\n\n                                            III. Conclusion\n\n   Although I might find the majority\u2019s arguments persuasive were we writing on a clean slate or\n\ndeciding the case en banc, precedent compels me to vote otherwise. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -18-\n\f",
