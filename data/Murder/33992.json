            "opinion_text": "\nJudgment unanimously affirmed. Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him of intentional and felony murder and three counts of robbery in the first degree. Defendant was sentenced to concurrent indeterminate terms of imprisonment, the longest of which is 25 years to life. Defendant contends that County Court\u2019s instruction erroneously permitted the jury to convict him of intentional murder without finding that defendant himself intended to kill. There is no merit to that contention. The test is whether, from the court\u2019s charge as a whole, the jury would have understood the correct principles of law to be applied to the case (see, People v Ladd, 89 NY2d 893, 895-896; People v Canty, 60 NY2d 830, 831-832). Here, the court repeatedly instructed the jury that, in order to be guilty of intentional murder, defendant must have intended to kill.\nThe court properly denied defendant\u2019s request to charge with respect to felony murder. The court properly charged that, in the context of this case, a person is guilty of felony murder when he commits the crime of first degree robbery and, \"in the course of and in the furtherance of such crime or of immediate flight therefrom, he, or another participant causes the death of a person other than one of the participants\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [3]). The People\u2019s proof established that the killing occurred \"in the course of and in furtherance of\u2019 the robbery, and defendant\u2019s statement neither countered that proof nor established the affirmative defense to felony murder (see, Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [3] [c]). Under those circumstances, felony murder is a strict liability offense, and the killer\u2019s subjective intent or motive is not relevant. Because defendant\u2019s request to charge distorted the \"course and furtherance\u201d element and was not supported by a reasonable view of the evidence, the court properly denied it.\nDefendant\u2019s sentence is neither unduly harsh nor severe. (Appeal from Judgment of Monroe County Court, Maloy, J.\u2014 Murder, 2nd Degree.) Present\u2014Denman, P. J., Green, Balio, Boehm and Fallon, JJ.\n",
