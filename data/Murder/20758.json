Tex.\nPenal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 12.31(a), 19.03(a)(2) (West 2011). Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n      At approximately 5:00 a.m. on April 27, 2008, Houston Police officers, including\nDavid Rodriguez, responded to a call reporting a shooting near the intersection of\nWestview and Gessner in the Spring Branch area of Houston. The responding officers\neventually located the person who had reported the shooting: Joseph Oliver. Oliver then\ndirected the police to an apartment complex on Westview. After arriving at the apartment\n\fcomplex, the officers found the complainant, Horace Luna, slumped over the hood of a car.\n(3RR23-32) Additional police arrived at the scene including Ruth Nunez, the crime scene\ninvestigator, and homicide detectives Dan Arnold and John McGalin. The investigators\ndiscovered a small-caliber gunshot wound to the complainant\u2019s back. They also located\nan unfired .380 caliber bullet and a piece of PVC pipe that was splattered with blood.\n\n       Oliver told the police that shortly before the shooting occurred, he was walking on\nthe sidewalk of Westview behind two \u201cMexican dudes.\u201d                         According to Oliver, he\neventually passed the two men and was continuing to walk near the Westview Gardens\nApartments when he saw a large black sport utility vehicle (\u201cSUV\u201d) that resembled an\nExpedition, Tahoe, or Suburban, pull up in front of the two Mexican men. Oliver saw the\nfront passenger side door open and a single Mexican man get out of the vehicle wearing a\nblack and white bandana covering his mouth and nose. According to Oliver, this man was\nbetween five feet, six inches and five feet, eight inches tall, he weighed about 160 pounds,\nand his head was shaved. Oliver saw the man turn toward the two walking men, point like\nhe was aiming at them, and demand that they give him their money.1 One of the men\nraised his hands into the air and said he did not have any money. At that point, Oliver\nbegan running away and he then heard two gunshots. Oliver hid for about ten minutes.\nWhen he came out of hiding, Oliver saw the complainant awkwardly slumped over on the\ntrunk of a car, dead. Oliver testified he did not see what happened to the second man. 2\nOliver went to a nearby convenience store to call the police and he flagged down an officer\nand directed him to the scene.\n\n       The investigating officers eventually determined that the complainant\u2019s murder was\nrelated to seven other armed robberies that occurred in southwest Houston in the two-hour\nperiod before the complainant\u2019s murder.                   Testimony and evidence admitted during\n\n\n\n       1\n           Oliver testified that he never actually saw any type of gun.\n       2\n           The police were never able to fully identify or locate the second man.\n                                                      2\n\fappellant\u2019s trial demonstrated that the seven robberies3 involved a black Tahoe or SUV\nand were committed in a manner similar to the complainant\u2019s murder.4\n\n        The seven robberies began when Christian Leal and members of his family were\nleaving Ruchi\u2019s Restaurant located at 7500 Westheimer. According to Leal, he, his wife,\nand his sister-in-law left the restaurant around 3:00 a.m. and got into his vehicle, a black,\n2002 Chevrolet Tahoe. Leal testified that after he started the Tahoe, someone pulled his\ndoor open and he then saw a silver gun pointed at him. Leal testified the robber was\nwearing a black bandana and he was either black or Hispanic. The robber demanded that\nthey get out of the Tahoe and for Leal to give him his wallet. At that point, the robber\npulled Leal out of the vehicle and ordered him to lie on the ground. According to Leal, the\nrobber then got into the Tahoe and drove away.\n\n        The second robbery occurred at about 3:30 in the morning at a pool hall located at\n7637 Dashwood. In this robbery, a man named Martinez was robbed of his wallet.\n\n        The third robbery occurred at a Valero gas station located at 7702 Bellaire.\nMohamad Machlab testified that he went to the Valero station between three and four in the\nmorning of April 27, 2008.          Machlab pulled his vehicle into a parking space. A Ford\nExplorer pulled up beside Machlab and a female got out of the Explorer to ask him for\ndirections. At that point, a black Escalade or Tahoe containing three individuals pulled up\nbehind Machlab\u2019s vehicle. A single Hispanic male got out of the passenger door on the\ndriver\u2019s side of the black SUV and proceeded to rob Machlab and the female at gunpoint.\nAccording to Machlab, the robber had a hood up on his head, but there was nothing\ncovering his face. Machlab testified the robber was between five feet nine inches and five\nfeet ten inches tall and he used a shiny pistol. After robbing the two of them, Machlab\ntestified that the robber backed up, got back into the black SUV with the other two\n        3\n          One of the seven related crimes was actually an attempted robbery; however, for ease of reference\nwe refer to all of the related crimes as robberies.\n        4\n          Appellant lodged no objections to any of the testimony and other evidence detailing the seven\nother robberies.\n                                                    3\n\findividuals and they drove off. Machlab noticed that when the robber was backing up and\ngetting into the black SUV, he dropped a wallet. After the black SUV drove off, Machlab\npicked up the wallet and he turned it over to the police. The wallet belonged to Martinez,\nthe man robbed at the pool hall.               Machlab eventually picked appellant out of a\nphotospread and identified him as the man that robbed him at gunpoint.5\n\n       The fourth robbery occurred at a Whataburger restaurant located at 3800 Southwest\nFreeway at approximately 4:15 a.m. At the Whataburger, Matt Nelson, Brian Alves, and\nthree female acquaintances were preparing to drive home in two separate cars. As Nelson\nwas clearing space in his back seat, a black Tahoe pulled up behind their vehicles, blocking\nthem from moving. After the Tahoe stopped, a single person got out from the driver\u2019s side\nand approached Alves and the three females. Alves, who was six feet eight inches tall,\ntestified the robber was \u201ca little fellow,\u201d he was wearing a hoodie, and he had a bandana\ncovering most of his face. The \u201clittle fellow\u201d was carrying a silverish semi-automatic\npistol and he ordered all of them to lie on the ground and give him their money. While the\nrobbery was in progress, Alves saw a second man get out of the black Tahoe holding a gun\nthat looked similar to a sawed-off shotgun that the police later found in appellant\u2019s\napartment. Alves also observed a third person inside the Tahoe. Alves got the Tahoe\u2019s\nlicense plate number and it matched the license plate number of Leal\u2019s stolen Tahoe.\n\n       The fifth robbery occurred in the parking lot of the Mezzanine Lounge about fifteen\nminutes after the Whataburger robbery. The Mezzanine Lounge is located a few minutes\u2019\ndrive away from the Whataburger near the intersection of Greenbriar and the Southwest\nFreeway. Emily Bynum had just gotten off work from her job as a bartender at the\nMezzanine Lounge and she and a co-worker were walking toward their cars when the\nco-worker said in a panicked voice for Bynum to get in her car. Bynum ran to her car, got\nin, and locked the doors using her key remote. Almost immediately someone wearing a\nblack bandana across the top of his nose and a dark sweater was at her window holding a\n\n       5\n           The female in the Explorer drove away before police arrived at the scene.\n                                                     4\n\fshiny gun to her face and angrily demanding that she open her door and get out. Bynum\nrefused and instead tried to start her vehicle, but the engine had been killed when she\nlocked the doors and set the alarm. The would-be robber became more and more angry\nand he banged his hands on the door and window of her vehicle, which set off the alarm.\nAfter a short while, he walked away and got back into his vehicle, a black SUV.\n\n       Scott Lanquist testified during appellant\u2019s trial. Lanquist was waiting inside his\nown vehicle for his girlfriend to get off from work at the Mezzanine Lounge in the early\nmorning hours of April 27, 2008. Lanquist saw two females exit the club and walk toward\ntheir vehicles when he saw a black Tahoe quickly drive into the parking lot and stop in\nfront of the girls\u2019 vehicles. Lanquist saw the driver get out of the Tahoe and approach one\nof the blocked cars and start what he thought was an argument. Lanquist saw the man\nbang on the female\u2019s car, setting off the alarm. He then saw the driver get back in the\nTahoe and it quickly drove away. Lanquist saw two other people inside the Tahoe, one in\nthe front passenger seat and the second sitting in the middle of the back seat leaning\nforward in between the two front seats.\n\n       The day after the attempted robbery, Officer James McIntosh processed Bynum\u2019s\ncar for fingerprints. McIntosh recovered two partial fingerprints from the driver\u2019s side\nwindow.    Fingerprint expert John Lazzaretto testified that one of the fingerprints\nrecovered by McIntosh matched appellant\u2019s left middle finger. Bynum later identified\nappellant in a police photospread and again during trial as the person who attempted to rob\nher in the Mezzanine Lounge parking lot.\n\n       The sixth robbery occurred in the parking lot of the Walmart located at 10750\nWestview just before five in the morning on April 27, 2008. Stephen Pak was driving out\nof the parking lot when a black SUV drove up and stopped in front of his car, blocking him\nfrom driving forward. Pak testified that a single Hispanic man wearing a black hood got\nout of the passenger side of the SUV and approached him carrying a pistol. The man\ndemanded Pak give him his money. Pak described the pistol as silver with a darker color.\n                                            5\n\fAccording to Pak, the man did not have anything covering his face. After Pak gave him\nhis wallet, the man went back to the SUV and it drove away. Pak was able to get the\nSUV\u2019s license plate number and it matched the license plate of Leal\u2019s stolen Tahoe.\n\n       During the police investigation, Pak was unable to positively identify anyone as the\nman who robbed him when shown a police photospread. Pak told the investigators that\nthe person in one of the photos had features similar to the person who robbed him. The\nphoto pointed out by Pak was a photo of Giovanni Alecio. During appellant\u2019s trial, Pak\ndenied that he told the police the person he picked out in the photospread was the person\nwho robbed him. In addition, during appellant\u2019s trial, Pak testified that State\u2019s Exhibit 22,\na photograph of appellant, resembled the person who robbed him. Appellant recalled Pak\nto testify during his case-in-chief. During this testimony, Pak testified that he would be\nable to identify the person who robbed him if he saw him again and he then positively\nidentified appellant as that person.\n\n       The seventh robbery took place a few minutes later in the drive-through lane of the\nMcDonald\u2019s restaurant located at the intersection of Wilcrest and Interstate 10. Margaret\nMallia was in the drive-through lane buying a cup of coffee when a black Tahoe crashed\ninto her car. At that point, a single Hispanic male wearing a black sweatshirt without a\nhood came up to her car window and demanded her money at gunpoint. Mallia testified\nthe gun was silver. Mallia also testified the man was not wearing a bandana on his face.\nAfter getting her purse, the man returned to the Tahoe and it drove off. Mallia got the\nlicense plate number of the Tahoe and turned it over to the police.\n\n       In July of 2008, Officer Stewart Hood was on patrol when he located Leal\u2019s stolen\nTahoe illegally parked and blocking a lane of traffic. Hood found the Tahoe parked\nhalfway out of an apartment complex gate in the 2700 block of Dunvale, near Westheimer.\nAccording to Hood, there was no one inside the Tahoe. The Tahoe was towed to the\nHouston Police Department\u2019s vehicle examination building, where Officer D.C.\nLambright, a crime scene investigator, processed it for evidence. Lambright found a\n                                             6\n\fcredit card belonging to Matt Nelson inside the Tahoe.             Lambright also located\nfingerprints on both the interior and exterior of the Tahoe.         Lambright sent these\nfingerprints to be analyzed. Fingerprint analysts determined that some of the fingerprints\nmatched those of Giovanni Alecio.\n\n       Police investigators subsequently located and interviewed Alecio. According to\ndetective Arnold, as the investigation progressed, the police became satisfied that Alecio\nwas not one of the participants in the seven robberies or the complainant\u2019s murder. In\naddition, Alecio told the police that he knew two individuals, Jose Luis Cardenas and\nappellant, who were involved in the crime spree. Fingerprint analysis revealed that some\nof the fingerprints found on Leal\u2019s Tahoe matched Cardenas\u2019s fingerprints.\n\n       On July 24, 2008, the police went to appellant\u2019s apartment and asked to speak with\nhim. The police also asked if appellant would consent to a search of his apartment.\nAppellant consented to the search. During the resulting search, the police discovered a\nNew Ithaca sawed-off, double-barrel 12-gauge shotgun. The police took appellant into\ncustody at that time.\n\n       On July 25, 2008, investigators Arnold and McGalin interviewed appellant. At the\ntime of the interviews, appellant was a suspect in the murder but he had not yet been\ncharged. The questioning resulted in two videotaped interviews. In both interviews, the\npolice read appellant his rights. Appellant waived his rights and agreed to speak with the\npolice. The two videotapes, as well as a transcript of both, were admitted into evidence\nwithout objection by appellant.\n\n       In the first interview, appellant told the investigating officers that his friend Luis\nCardenas picked him up in a black Tahoe. Appellant also told the officers that there was\nanother Hispanic male in the Tahoe, a friend of Cardenas\u2019s that he did not recognize.\nAccording to appellant, Cardenas was sitting in the front passenger seat, the stranger was\ndriving, and he rode in the back seat on the passenger side occasionally moving into the\nmiddle. According to appellant, after picking him up, they drove toward the Beltway with\n                                             7\n\fthe driver explaining that they were going to \u201cjump out on some guys\u201d to come up with\nsome quick cash. Appellant admitted he knew they were going to commit robberies.\nAppellant admitted the driver had a chrome-colored handgun. In addition, appellant\nadmitted he was present in the Tahoe during three criminal episodes that occurred that\nmorning: the first occurring on the feeder road of the Beltway; the second at the Walmart\nparking lot close to the Beltway; and the third, the attempted robbery and murder of the\ncomplainant. Appellant told the police it was the driver who committed each of the\ncrimes, including the shooting of the complainant. Appellant admitted he was wearing a\ndark blue hoodie that evening, but denied that he wore a bandana or gloves. Appellant did\nadmit to the officers that he knew what he was getting involved in, he knew the Tahoe did\nnot belong to Cardenas or the driver, and that he had put himself in the situation.\nAppellant told the police that once the complainant was shot, he told Cardenas and the\ndriver to drop him off at a friend\u2019s nearby apartment. Appellant denied he was present at\nthe other robberies that the police believed were connected to the complainant\u2019s murder.\nThe first interview ended at 10:30 a.m., approximately a half hour after it started.\n\n       About an hour after the first interview ended, appellant told the investigators he\nwanted to speak with them again.        During the ensuing second interview, appellant\nadmitted that he was present at the Walmart, McDonald\u2019s, and Whataburger robberies.\nAppellant also told the police he got out of the Tahoe during the Whataburger robbery\nwhile the driver threw stuff into the Tahoe. Appellant told the police he did not recall any\nother robberies that night, denied he ever possessed a weapon that night, and told the police\nthere was only a single gun used during all of the crimes.\n\n       Appellant also admitted during the second interview to being present when the\ncomplainant was murdered.        Appellant then described the murder for the police\ninvestigators. Appellant claimed they turned off of Interstate 10, drove north on Gessner\nand turned west at an intersection. While driving down that street between two apartment\ncomplexes, the driver turned off the Tahoe\u2019s lights, pulled up in front of two men walking\n\n                                             8\n\falong the street, put the Tahoe in park, and the driver got out of the Tahoe. The driver then\nwent around the Tahoe and approached one of the men. According to appellant, the man\nwalked away, the driver approached him again, and that was when he heard a gunshot.\nAfter the murder, appellant told the police he was not dropped off at a friend\u2019s apartment;\ninstead they drove back to his apartment complex where they parked the Tahoe.\nAccording to appellant, he and Cardenas went into his apartment but appellant refused to\nallow the driver into his apartment. Appellant then went to sleep. After waking up the\nnext day, appellant told Cardenas to take the Tahoe and get rid of it because he did not want\nanything to do with it.\n\n         At the close of the evidence, the case was submitted to the jury by the trial court.\nThe court\u2019s charge authorized the jury to convict appellant of capital murder if it found\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that he was responsible for the complainant\u2019s death either\nindividually, as a party, or as a co-conspirator with Cardenas and/or another person or\npersons. The jury found appellant guilty of capital murder. The trial court then imposed\nthe automatic punishment of confinement for life without the possibility of parole. This\nappeal followed.\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\n         Appellant raises two issues on appeal. In his first issue, appellant contends the trial\ncourt erred when it admitted into evidence \u201c[t]estimony and exhibits of extraneous crimes,\nconduct, wrongs, bad acts, specifically seven other aggravated robberies that occurred\nbefore the murder in question.\u201d In his second issue, appellant contends the evidence is\ninsufficient to support his conviction for capital murder. We address his second issue\nfirst.\n\nI.       Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n         Appellant contends the evidence is insufficient for four reasons. First, appellant\nasserts the evidence is insufficient because the only eyewitness who testified during his\n\n                                                9\n\ftrial was unable to identify him as the person who shot and killed the complainant.\nSecond, appellant argues the evidence is insufficient because Alecio and Cardenas did not\ntestify and provide direct evidence implicating him in the murder of the complainant.\nThird, appellant asserts there is no evidence that he acted as a party, a co-conspirator, or\nwas the driver/gunman during the crime spree that ended with the complainant\u2019s murder.\nFinally, appellant argues there is no physical evidence connecting him to the murder scene\nor the stolen black Tahoe. Appellant contends that, at most, the evidence established that\nhe was a \u201cmere backseat passenger in the vehicle in question and that he did not have any\nknowledge that the driver of the vehicle was going to shoot the murder victim, nor ever\nanticipated same.\u201d\n\n       A.     The Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n       In a sufficiency review, we view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nverdict and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319\n(1979); Brooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d 893, 895 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (plurality opinion);\nPomier v. State, 326 S.W.3d 373, 378 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.).\nOur review includes both direct and circumstantial evidence, as well as any reasonable\ninferences that may be drawn from the evidence. Clayton v. State, 235 S.W.3d 772, 778\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Direct and circumstantial evidence are treated equally. Id. The\njury, as the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses, is free to believe or disbelieve all\nor part of a witness\u2019s testimony. Jones v. State, 984 S.W.2d 254, 257 (Tex. Crim. App.\n1998). The jury may reasonably infer facts from the evidence presented, credit the\nwitnesses it chooses to, disbelieve any or all of the evidence or testimony proffered, and\nweigh the evidence as it sees fit. Sharp v. State, 707 S.W.2d 611, 614 (Tex. Crim. App.\n1986). Reconciliation of conflicts in the evidence is within the jury\u2019s discretion, and such\nconflicts alone will not call for reversal if there is enough credible evidence to support a\nconviction. Losada v. State, 721 S.W.2d 305, 309 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986). An appellate\n\n                                               10\n\fcourt may not re-evaluate the weight and credibility of the evidence produced at trial and in\nso doing substitute its judgment for that of the fact finder. King v. State, 29 S.W.3d 556,\n562 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). Inconsistencies in the evidence are resolved in favor of the\nverdict. Curry v. State, 30 S.W.3d 394, 406 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\n\n       A jury may infer knowledge or intent from the acts, conduct, and remarks of the\naccused, and from the surrounding circumstances. Hernandez v. State, 819 S.W.2d 806,\n810 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991). Direct evidence of the elements of the offense is not\nrequired.    Hooper v. State, 214 S.W.3d 9, 14 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).            Juries are\npermitted to make multiple reasonable inferences from the evidence presented at trial, and\ncircumstantial evidence is as probative as direct evidence in establishing the guilt of an\nactor. Id. at 14\u201316. Circumstantial evidence alone can be sufficient to establish guilt.\nId. at 15.\n\n       A person commits the offense of capital murder if he intentionally commits murder\nin the course of committing or attempting to commit robbery. Tex. Penal Code Ann. '\n19.03(a)(2). A person commits murder if he intentionally or knowingly causes the death\nof an individual. Tex. Penal Code Ann. ' 19.02(b)(1) (West 2011). A person commits a\nrobbery if, in the course of committing theft, and with the intent to obtain or maintain\ncontrol of the property, he intentionally or knowingly threatens or places another in fear of\nimminent bodily injury or death. Tex. Penal Code Ann. ' 29.02(a)(2) (West 2011).\n\n       Under the law of parties, a \u201cperson is criminally responsible as a party to an offense\nif the offense is committed by his own conduct, by the conduct of another for which he is\ncriminally responsible, or by both.\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 7.01(a) (West 2011). A\nperson is \u201ccriminally responsible\u201d for an offense committed by the conduct of another if,\nacting with intent to promote or assist the commission of the offense, he solicits,\nencourages, directs, aids, or attempts to aid the other person to commit the offense. Id. at\n\u00a7 7.02(a)(2).\n\n                                             11\n\f       A person is also \u201ccriminally responsible\u201d for an offense committed by the conduct\nof another when \u201cin the attempt to carry out a conspiracy to commit one felony, another\nfelony is committed by one of the conspirators \u2026 if the offense was committed in\nfurtherance of the unlawful purpose and was one that should have been anticipated as a\nresult of carrying out the conspiracy.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 7.02(b). A defendant in a capital murder\ncase may be convicted solely on a conspiracy theory of culpability contained in the jury\ncharge. Love v. State, 199 S.W.3d 447, 452 (Tex. App.CHouston [1st Dist.] 2006, pet.\nref=d) (citing Fuller v. State, 827 S.W.2d 919, 932B33 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992)).\nTherefore, the State is not required to present evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s intent to\nkill as long as the evidence establishes that a felony was committed as a result of a\nconspiracy and the murder should have been anticipated in carrying out the conspiracy to\ncommit the underlying felony. Ruiz v. State, 579 S.W.2d 206, 209 (Tex. Crim. App.\n[Panel Op.] 1979).\n\n       A reviewing court may look to events before, during, and after the commission of\nthe offense to determine whether an individual is a party to the commission of the offense.\nBeardsley v. State, 738 S.W.2d 681, 684 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987).              Circumstantial\nevidence may be sufficient to show that one is a party to an offense. Id. Mere presence\nalone will not make one a party to an offense; nevertheless it is a circumstance tending to\nprove that a person is a party to the offense and when taken with other facts may be\nsufficient to show that he was a participant. Wygal v. State, 555 S.W.2d 465, 469 n.3\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1977).\n\n       B.     Analysis\n\n       We turn first to appellant\u2019s contentions that the evidence is insufficient because the\none eyewitness who testified during his trial was unable to identify him as the shooter and\nbecause Alecio and Cardenas did not provide direct evidence connecting him to the\ncomplainant\u2019s murder. Because direct evidence of the elements of the charged offense is\nnot required, appellant\u2019s initial contentions are without merit. Hooper, 214 S.W.3d at 14.\n                                             12\n\f       Appellant also asserts the evidence is insufficient because there was no physical\nevidence connecting him to the crime scene or the black Tahoe. Because appellant\u2019s own\nstatements place him inside the black Tahoe and at the crime scene when the complainant\nwas shot, we reject his contention that the lack of physical evidence renders the evidence\ninsufficient.\n\n       Finally, appellant argues that the evidence is insufficient to support his capital\nmurder conviction because, in his view, the only thing the evidence established was that he\nwas a \u201cmere backseat passenger in the vehicle in question and that he did not have any\nknowledge that the driver of the vehicle was going to shoot the murder victim, nor ever\nanticipated same.\u201d We disagree.\n\n       The jury was instructed that it could find appellant guilty of capital murder in any of\nthree different ways: (1) as a principal; (2) as a party under section 7.02(a)(2) of the Texas\nPenal Code; and (3) as a co-conspirator under section 7.02(b) of the Texas Penal Code.\nThe jury returned a general verdict; therefore, if the evidence is sufficient to support a\nguilty finding under any of the allegations submitted, we must uphold the jury\u2019s guilty\nverdict. Sorto v. State, 173 S.W.3d 469, 472 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005).\n\n       The evidence against appellant includes his two videotaped statements. In those\nstatements appellant admitted he was picked up in a black Tahoe by two men he knew did\nnot own the vehicle. Appellant also admitted during his statements that he knew they\nwere going to commit robberies that night and that one of his companions was armed with\na chrome-colored handgun. In addition, appellant admitted that he was present during\nseveral of the seven criminal incidents leading up to the shooting of the complainant.\nWhile denying any direct involvement in any of the robberies or the attempted robbery of\nBynum, appellant admitted he got out of the Tahoe during the Whataburger robbery while\none of his companions threw \u201cstuff\u201d into the back of the Tahoe.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f       The evidence also included the testimony of three eyewitnesses who identified\nappellant as the primary gunman in three out of the seven robberies. 6 In addition,\nappellant\u2019s fingerprints were found on Bynum\u2019s car. A sawed-off shotgun was found in\nappellant\u2019s apartment and was admitted into evidence during appellant\u2019s trial. Brian\nAlves testified it resembled the firearm brandished by the second robber to get out of the\nTahoe during the Whataburger robbery.\n\n       Viewing the evidence summarized above in the light most favorable to the verdict,\nwe conclude the evidence is sufficient to establish appellant\u2019s guilt as either a party under\nsection 7.02(a)(2) of the Texas Penal Code or as a co-conspirator under section 7.02(b) of\nthe Texas Penal Code. We overrule appellant\u2019s second issue on appeal.\n\nII.    Admission of Evidence\n\n       In his first issue, appellant complains the trial court erred when it admitted into\nevidence during appellant\u2019s trial, testimony and exhibits related to the seven robberies the\npolice believed were connected to the complainant\u2019s murder. The State asserts appellant\nfailed to preserve this issue for appellate review because he failed to lodge\ncontemporaneous objections. We agree.\n\n       If a party does not want an extraneous offense admitted at trial, he must object when\nthe evidence is presented in order to preserve his complaint for appellate review.\nMcMillan v. State, 940 S.W.2d 767, 769 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 1997, pet.\nref\u2019d) (citing Ethington v. State, 819 S.W.2d 854, 858 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991)). The\nobjection must be timely, proper, and specific. Moff v. State, 131 S.W.3d 485, 489 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2004). In addition, the party must object every time the objectionable\nevidence is offered. Martinez v. State, 98 S.W.3d 189, 193 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).\nBecause appellant failed to object to the admission of any of the evidence related to the\nseven robberies, we hold he has not preserved this issue for appellate review. Harris v.\n\n       6\n        The three robberies were the Walmart robbery, the attempted robbery of Bynum in the Mezzanine\nLounge parking lot, and the Valero robbery.\n                                                 14\n\fState, 204 S.W.3d 19, 27 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. ref\u2019d) (citing Tex. R.\nApp. P. 33.1(a)).\n\n       Even if appellant had preserved this issue for appellate review, the result would be\nthe same as evidence of the seven robberies was admissible to connect appellant to the\ncomplainant\u2019s murder. While evidence of extraneous offenses is normally not admissible\nat the guilt phase of a trial to prove that a defendant committed the charged offense in\nconformity with a bad character, extraneous offense evidence may be admissible when it\nhas relevance apart from character conformity. Tex. R. Evid. 404(b); Devoe v. State, 354\nS.W.3d 457, 469 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).            Extraneous offense evidence may be\nadmissible to show proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, knowledge or\nidentity. Devoe, 354 S.W.3d at 469. Whether extraneous offense evidence has relevance\napart from character conformity is a question for the trial court. Id. Thus, a trial court\u2019s\nruling on the admissibility of extraneous offenses is reviewed under an abuse of discretion\nstandard.   Id.     As long as the trial court\u2019s ruling is within the zone of reasonable\ndisagreement, there is no abuse of discretion and the trial court\u2019s ruling will be upheld on\nappeal. Id. A trial court\u2019s Rule 404(b) ruling is generally within this zone if there is\nevidence supporting a determination that an extraneous transaction is relevant to a\nmaterial, non-propensity issue. Id.\n\n       Here, the identity of the perpetrator of the complainant\u2019s murder was a contested\nissue. Appellant\u2019s defensive theory was that he was merely a backseat passenger in the\nTahoe when the complainant was murdered. The State\u2019s case against appellant was based\non circumstantial evidence. As a result, the State needed the evidence of the extraneous\noffenses to connect appellant to the complainant\u2019s murder. We hold the trial court did not\nabuse its discretion when it determined that evidence of the seven robbery crime spree was\nadmissible. See id. at 470 (holding, in a capital murder case, evidence of other crimes\ncommitted during a crime spree was admissible to establish the identity of the perpetrator).\n\n       We overrule appellant\u2019s first issue on appeal.\n                                             15\n\f                                                CONCLUSION\n\n      Having overruled appellant\u2019s issues on appeal, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                /s/      Leslie Brock Yates\n                                                         Senior Justice\n\n\nPanel consists of Justice Seymore, Boyce, and Senior Justice Yates.7\nDo Not Publish \u2014 TEX.
