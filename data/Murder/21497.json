She appeals, raising the following restated issue for\n\n      our review: whether the trial court abused its discretion when it refused to\n\n      instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of reckless homicide.\n\n\n[2]   We affirm.\n\n\n                                      Facts and Procedural History\n[3]   In January 2013, Sanders was living with Gregory Cole (\u201cCole\u201d), their son, and\n\n      Sanders\u2019s son from another relationship in a residence on Tennessee Street in\n\n      Gary, Indiana. Cole\u2019s friend, Charles Hampton (\u201cHampton\u201d), was also living\n\n      in the residence. At approximately 5:00 p.m. on January 8, 2013, Cole and\n\n      Sanders began drinking and continued to drink throughout the night. Hampton\n\n      came home around 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. and saw that Sanders and Cole had been\n\n      drinking. Hampton had also been drinking and continued to do so in his\n\n      bedroom after returning to the residence. Sanders\u2019s sister, Sharese Burks\n\n      (\u201cBurks\u201d), also arrived at the residence sometime after Hampton and mostly\n\n      stayed in the bedroom with the children.\n\n\n[4]   Although Hampton stayed in his bedroom most of the night with the door\n\n      closed, he did observe several arguments between Sanders and Cole. When he\n\n      first witnessed the two arguing, it was not a physical argument, but the second\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          See Ind. Code \u00a7 35-42-1-1(1).\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 45A04-1506-CR-648 | February 8, 2016   Page 2 of 13\n\f      time he observed them fighting, Sanders was pushing Cole, who appeared\n\n      drunk and was having trouble standing. The third time Hampton opened his\n\n      bedroom door and saw Sanders and Cole arguing, \u201c[Sanders] was pushing\n\n      [Cole] around, getting basically the best of him this time.\u201d Tr. at 83. Hampton\n\n      attempted to intervene, but Cole told him to stay out of it, so Hampton returned\n\n      to his bedroom, had another drink, and went to sleep.\n\n\n[5]   Burks also witnessed Sanders and Cole arguing that night. Burks stayed in the\n\n      bedroom most of the night, but came out periodically. One of the times Burks\n\n      came out, she saw Cole with a knife in his hand. Later when Burks opened the\n\n      bedroom door to check on Sanders and Cole, she saw blood and Cole\u2019s body on\n\n      the floor. Burks called Melinda Harvey (\u201cHarvey\u201d), a family friend, a couple of\n\n      times between 12:30 and 2:00 a.m. on January 9 to tell Harvey that Sanders and\n\n      Cole were fighting and that Burks needed to check on Sanders.\n\n\n[6]   According to Sanders, she and Cole had several arguments that night. At a\n\n      certain point, Cole began to yell at her while they were in the kitchen, but she\n\n      could not recall what the argument was about. She saw Cole grab something\n\n      that she thought was a knife and heard him say something about \u201cthose mother\n\n      f*cking kids,\u201d which scared her. Id. at 501. Cole began walking into the living\n\n      room area, and Sanders tried to stop him from getting to the children. She cut\n\n      off his path and told him to give her the knife. Cole refused and told Sanders to\n\n      get out of his way. Sanders did not remember anything after that.\n\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 45A04-1506-CR-648 | February 8, 2016   Page 3 of 13\n\f[7]   Burks again called Harvey at 4:00 a.m. and told her that they needed help.\n\n      Burks said, \u201c[Y]ou got to help, it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s bad. Come help us. Come get us.\u201d\n\n      Id. at 209. Sanders left the home with Burks and the children, and they arrived\n\n      at Harvey\u2019s home around 4:30 a.m. Harvey noticed that Sanders\u2019s face was red\n\n      and that Sanders had cuts on her hands. Harvey also observed that Sanders\n\n      appeared to be in shock. Burks called her and Sanders\u2019s older brother, who told\n\n      Burks to contact the police. However, the brother ended up contacting the\n\n      police.\n\n\n[8]   Gary Police Department Officer Justin Hedrick (\u201cOfficer Hedrick\u201d) responded\n\n      to a welfare check at Cole\u2019s address and found Cole lying on his stomach in a\n\n      pool of blood. The responding officers checked Cole for a pulse and found\n\n      none. Officer Hedrick continued to clear the rest of the residence and\n\n      discovered Hampton asleep in his room. Hampton identified Cole to Officer\n\n      Hedrick. Two knives were collected from Cole\u2019s residence: a black-handled\n\n      folding knife recovered next to Cole\u2019s body and another folding knife with a\n\n      brown handle that was located in a drawer under some paperwork. The black-\n\n      handled knife tested positive for blood, but the other knife did not. It was later\n\n      determined that Cole suffered five stab wounds to his upper body, three of\n\n      which were flesh wounds to the skin and muscle, one which lacerated his liver\n\n      and caused internal hemorrhaging, and one which penetrated the heart from\n\n      front to back and caused substantial blood loss. The wound to the heart was\n\n      most likely the wound that killed Cole.\n\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 45A04-1506-CR-648 | February 8, 2016   Page 4 of 13\n\f[9]    Gary Police Department Officer Nicholas Ferrell was dispatched to Harvey\u2019s\n\n       address to transport Sanders to the police department as the suspect in Cole\u2019s\n\n       death. Sanders\u2019s hands were bandaged by paramedics, and she was taken to the\n\n       Gary Police Department, where she met with Detective Michael Barnes\n\n       (\u201cDetective Barnes\u201d). Detective Barnes advised Sanders of her Miranda rights,\n\n       and she signed a waiver of rights form. Detective Barnes then conducted a\n\n       video-taped interview with Sanders, in which she admitted to stabbing Cole.\n\n\n[10]   Sometime after Cole\u2019s death, his aunt, Sandra Cole (\u201cSandra\u201d), went to Cole\u2019s\n\n       home to clean and found journals, consisting of a small journal and a\n\n       composition notebook, kept by Sanders. Sandra gave the journals to the police.\n\n       A handwriting expert determined that Sanders wrote the passages contained in\n\n       the small journal and that it was highly probable that Sanders wrote the\n\n       passages contained in the composition notebook. In a passage from the small\n\n       journal dated January 8, 2013, which was the day before she killed Cole,\n\n       Sanders wrote:\n\n               Man, I can\u2019t wait to get the hell out of here because [Cole] really\n               lost his mind. I honestly wanted him dead on Sunday. This\n               n***a was on other sh*t. This b*itch saying all types of sh*t and\n               got mad when I said some sh*t, like he the only one who could\n               say something. If [Hampton] wasn\u2019t here I probably would have\n               stab[b]ed that n***a, but I don\u2019t know if he pissed me off bad\n               enough. If he kept talking or tried to put his hands on me then it\n               would have been over for him and since I don\u2019t believe in God I\n               would not feel too bad about it. I would have been scared I\n               would get caught and sad for his family but as time pass[ed] I\n               would get over it.\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 45A04-1506-CR-648 | February 8, 2016   Page 5 of 13\n\f       State\u2019s Ex. 124; Tr. at 426-27.\n\n\n[11]   The State originally charged Sanders with Class A felony voluntary\n\n       manslaughter and Class B felony voluntary manslaughter, but later amended\n\n       the charges to include murder. Prior to the trial, the State dismissed the\n\n       voluntary manslaughter charges. Sanders raised a defense of insanity, and the\n\n       trial court appointed Dr. Douglas Caruana (\u201cDr. Caruana\u201d), a psychologist,\n\n       and Dr. Bhawani Prasad (\u201cDr. Prasad\u201d), a psychiatrist, to evaluate Sanders.\n\n       Both doctors testified at trial. Dr. Caruana determined that Sanders did not\n\n       meet the criteria for insanity as defined by the statute. Tr. at 720. Dr. Prasad\n\n       concluded that Sanders was sane at the time she killed Cole. Id. at 759.\n\n\n[12]   At trial, Sanders testified that Cole had a knife and made threatening statements\n\n       about the children and that she believed she had to stop him. Id. at 501-02.\n\n       Sanders testified that she did not remember stabbing Cole or giving a statement\n\n       to Detective Barnes. Id. at 503-05. In her testimony at trial, Sanders stated that\n\n       she had been the victim of sexual and physical abuse beginning in the second\n\n       grade. She related that she developed what she referred to as \u201cbest friend,\u201d who\n\n       she first met at around age eight. Id. at 496. When Sanders was young, \u201cbest\n\n       friend\u201d was comforting and supportive, but as she grew older, he would \u201csay\n\n       bad things\u201d and call her names. Id. at 497, 499. Sanders testified that \u201cbest\n\n       friend\u201d was in the kitchen the night she killed Cole and told Sanders that she\n\n       \u201chad to stop [Cole] before he hurt [her] kids.\u201d Id. at 502.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 45A04-1506-CR-648 | February 8, 2016   Page 6 of 13\n\f[13]   On cross-examination, Sanders admitted that she had told Detective Barnes\n\n       during her interview that she liked knives and that she had picked up the black\n\n       knife and put it in her pocket the night she killed Cole. Id. at 523-24. Sanders\n\n       told Detective Barnes that Cole had a brown-handled knife. Id. at 524. On\n\n       cross, Sanders acknowledged that she had told the 911 operator that Cole had\n\n       attacked her with a knife and she had to stab him because her life was in\n\n       danger. Id. at 529-30. Sanders also agreed that she told Detective Barnes that\n\n       \u201c[Cole] was making her mad, [and she] had a knife so [she] stabbed him.\u201d Id.\n\n       at 530.\n\n\n[14]   During the trial, Sanders presented expert testimony from Dr. Karla Fisher\n\n       (\u201cDr. Fisher\u201d), a psychologist and lawyer, who had interviewed Sanders. Dr.\n\n       Fisher testified about battered woman syndrome and concluded that Sanders\n\n       was a battered woman, that the abuse was significant, and that she suffered\n\n       from post-traumatic stress disorder. Id. at 612-13. Dr. Fisher concluded that\n\n       \u201c[Sanders] struggled with [Cole] over the knife because she thought he was\n\n       gonna [sic] kill her children and in that struggle or after that struggle she killed\n\n       him because she thought he was still serious about killing them.\u201d Id. at 615.\n\n       Dr. Fisher found out about \u201cbest friend\u201d from interviewing Sanders and\n\n       referred her to Dr. Lisa Rone (\u201cDr. Rone\u201d), a clinical psychologist. Dr. Rone\n\n       diagnosed Sanders with dissociative identity disorder, not otherwise specified.\n\n       Dr. Rone stated that \u201cbest friend\u201d was \u201creal in the sense that his persona is a\n\n       part of . . . Sanders and she experiences this persona as a separate and unique\n\n       identity, separate from her.\u201d Id. at 681. Dr. Rone concluded that Sanders\u2019s act\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 45A04-1506-CR-648 | February 8, 2016   Page 7 of 13\n\f       of killing Cole \u201cwas not a willful act, this was an automatic act and an act in\n\n       which she did not appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct.\u201d Id. at 688.\n\n\n[15]   At the close of evidence, defense counsel requested that the trial court instruct\n\n       the jury on voluntary manslaughter and reckless homicide. At that time, the\n\n       trial court stated that it would give an instruction on the lesser included offense\n\n       of voluntary manslaughter, but not on reckless homicide. Defense counsel\n\n       subsequently requested the trial court to give the jury the pattern jury\n\n       instruction for reckless homicide. The trial court questioned what facts\n\n       supported the giving of such an instruction, stating, \u201cYour client testified she\n\n       didn\u2019t have any memory of the event. How do you get a Reckless from that?\u201d\n\n       Id. at 812. Defense counsel responded, in pertinent part:\n\n\n               You understand with the mental state being the thing in question,\n               we don\u2019t know. Maybe they could maybe reduce it from stab\n               wound patterns, from the pathology diagram. They might be\n               able to do it between how they are going to reconstruct the\n               testimony of . . . Hampton and . . . Burks, the two other people\n               who witnessed a position of the argument that night.\n\n\n               There\u2019s a myriad of ways I think that this could be achieved. I\n               just believe that it would be appropriate. I believe it would be a\n               simple one to add in. And I think it would be a fundamental\n               fairness to [Sanders].\n\n\n       Id. at 813. The State again opposed giving the instruction on reckless homicide,\n\n       and the trial court ultimately refused to give the jury an instruction on reckless\n\n       homicide, finding that there was no serious evidentiary dispute as to the facts of\n\n       the case. The trial court continued, \u201cThe victim had one stab wound directly to\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 45A04-1506-CR-648 | February 8, 2016   Page 8 of 13\n\f       the heart, penetrated all the way through. . . . I don\u2019t find this to be a reckless\n\n       fact pattern such that a lesser included offense is warranted.\u201d Id. at 817. At the\n\n       conclusion of the jury trial, the jury found Sanders guilty but mentally ill as to\n\n       the murder. The trial court sentenced Sanders to forty-seven years and ordered\n\n       the Department of Correction to evaluate her mental capacity. Sanders now\n\n       appeals.\n\n\n                                      Discussion and Decision\n[16]   Sanders argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it refused to\n\n       instruct the jury as to reckless homicide. The trial court has broad discretion in\n\n       instructing the jury, and we generally review its instructional determinations\n\n       only for an abuse of discretion. Jackson v. State, 33 N.E.3d 1067, 1071 (Ind. Ct.\n\n       App. 2015), trans. denied.\n\n\n[17]   Our Supreme Court in Wright v. State, 658 N.E.2d 563 (Ind. 1995), set out a\n\n       three-part test that trial courts should perform when requested by a party to\n\n       instruct on a lesser included offense to the crime charged. Webb v. State, 963\n\n       N.E.2d 1103, 1106 (Ind. 2012). First, the trial court must compare the statute\n\n       defining the crime charged with the statute defining the alleged lesser included\n\n       offense to determine if the alleged lesser included offense is inherently included\n\n       in the crime charged. Id. Second, if it is determined that an alleged lesser\n\n       included offense is not inherently included in the crime charged under step one,\n\n       then the trial court must determine if the alleged lesser included offense is\n\n       factually included in the crime charged. Id. If the alleged lesser included\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 45A04-1506-CR-648 | February 8, 2016   Page 9 of 13\n\f       offense is neither inherently nor factually included in the crime charged, the\n\n       trial court should not give an instruction on the alleged lesser included offense.\n\n       Id. Third, if it has determined that an alleged lesser included offense is either\n\n       inherently or factually included in the crime charged, the trial court must then\n\n       look at the evidence presented in the case by both parties to determine \u201cif there\n\n       is a serious evidentiary dispute about the element or elements distinguishing the\n\n       greater from the lesser offense and if, in view of this dispute, a jury could\n\n       conclude that the lesser offense was committed but not the greater.\u201d Id. If such\n\n       an evidentiary dispute exists, it is reversible error for a trial court not to give an\n\n       instruction, when requested, on the inherently or factually included lesser\n\n       offense. Id.\n\n\n[18]   Sanders argues that the trial court abused its discretion and committed\n\n       reversible error when it refused to give the jury an instruction on reckless\n\n       homicide. She contends that reckless homicide is an inherently included lesser\n\n       offense of murder and that a serious evidentiary dispute existed concerning\n\n       Sanders\u2019s state of mind at the time of the crime, which created an issue for the\n\n       jury as to which offense she may have committed. Sanders asserts that there\n\n       was a serious evidentiary dispute as to what may have happened during the\n\n       struggle between her and Cole because she claims that she acted in fear that\n\n       Cole was going to hurt her or her children. She urges that the jury should have\n\n       been able to consider whether her stabbing of Cole was reckless rather than\n\n       knowing and intentional, and the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on\n\n       reckless homicide was reversible error.\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 45A04-1506-CR-648 | February 8, 2016   Page 10 of 13\n\f[19]   The only element distinguishing murder and reckless homicide is the\n\n       defendant\u2019s state of mind: reckless homicide occurs when the defendant\n\n       \u201crecklessly\u201d kills another human being, and murder occurs when the killing is\n\n       done \u201cknowingly\u201d or \u201cintentionally.\u201d Compare Ind. Code \u00a7 35-42-1-5, with I.C.\n\n       \u00a7 35-42-1-1(1). \u201cA person engages in conduct \u2018recklessly\u2019 if he engages in the\n\n       conduct in plain, conscious, and unjustifiable disregard of harm that might\n\n       result and the disregard involves a substantial deviation from acceptable\n\n       standards of conduct.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 35-41-2-2(c). Conversely, \u201c[a] person engages in\n\n       conduct \u2018knowingly\u2019 if, when he engages in the conduct, he is aware of a high\n\n       probability that he or she is doing so.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 35-41-2-2(b). \u201cA person engages\n\n       in conduct \u2018intentionally\u2019 if, when he engages in the conduct, it is his conscious\n\n       objective to do so.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 35-41-2-2(a). Reckless homicide is, thus, an\n\n       inherently included lesser offense of murder. Webb, 963 N.E.2d at 1106.\n\n\n[20]   Therefore, the determinative issue in this case is whether there was a serious\n\n       evidentiary dispute concerning Sanders\u2019s state of mind that would justify giving\n\n       the requested reckless homicide instruction. In determining whether a serious\n\n       evidentiary dispute exists the trial court \u201cmust look at the evidence presented in\n\n       the case by both parties.\u201d Id. at 1107 (emphasis in original). Here, the evidence\n\n       showed that Sanders admitted during her interview with Detective Barnes to\n\n       stabbing Cole. Cole was stabbed multiple times, including one wound to the\n\n       heart. This wound penetrated Cole\u2019s heart from front to back, resulting in\n\n       massive blood loss to Cole. There was also a stab wound that penetrated Cole\u2019s\n\n       liver and caused internal hemorrhaging. The infliction of multiple stab wounds,\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 45A04-1506-CR-648 | February 8, 2016   Page 11 of 13\n\f       including one that penetrated Cole\u2019s heart and another that lacerated his liver,\n\n       is inconsistent with any theory other than that, when Sanders acted, she was\n\n       aware of a high probability that her conduct might kill Cole. Sanders\u2019s own\n\n       expert, Dr. Fisher, opined that, \u201c[Sanders] struggled with [Cole] over the knife\n\n       because she thought he was gonna [sic] kill her children and in that struggle or\n\n       after that struggle she killed him because she thought he was still serious about\n\n       killing them.\u201d Tr. at 615. This testimony supported Sanders\u2019s argument that\n\n       she killed Cole in self-defense because she thought he was going to harm the\n\n       children, but did not show a dispute regarding the level of Sanders\u2019s state of\n\n       mind required for the commission of the offense.\n\n\n[21]   Additionally, on cross-examination, Sanders admitted that she had told\n\n       Detective Barnes that she liked knives, and on the night of Cole\u2019s death, she\n\n       had picked up the black knife from the kitchen counter and put it in her pocket.\n\n       Id. at 523-24. Sanders also admitted on cross-examination that she told\n\n       Detective Barnes that, on the night of the stabbing, Cole was making her mad,\n\n       and she had a knife, so she stabbed him. Id. at 530. The evidence also showed\n\n       that, on January 8, 2013, less than a day before she killed Cole, Sanders wrote\n\n       in her journal that she \u201cwanted him dead\u201d and that she \u201cwould have stabbed\u201d\n\n       him if Hampton had not been there. State\u2019s Ex. 124; Tr. at 426.\n\n\n[22]   Sanders testified that she did not remember stabbing Cole. Tr. at 503-04. She\n\n       stated that he grabbed a knife and said something about the \u201cmother f*cking\n\n       kids\u201d that she understood to mean that he intended to harm the children so she\n\n       cut off his path and told him to give her the knife, which he refused to do.

Sanders testified that the next thing she remembered was Burks telling\n\n       her to get the children and then leaving the residence. Id. at 504. She did not\n\n       offer any evidence that she acted in plain, conscious, and unjustifiable disregard\n\n       of harm that might result when she stabbed Cole and killed him.\n\n\n[23]   The trial court heard the arguments presented by both the State and Sanders\n\n       regarding giving the reckless homicide instruction and concluded that there was\n\n       no serious evidentiary dispute as to the facts of the case, stating, \u201cThe victim\n\n       had one stab wound directly to the heart, penetrated all the way through. . . . I\n\n       don\u2019t find this to be a reckless fact pattern such that a lesser included offense is\n\n       warranted.\u201d Id. at 817. The trial court reviewed the evidence presented by both\n\n       parties and determined that a reckless homicide instruction should not be given.\n\n       We agree. The evidence did not demonstrate a serious evidentiary dispute that\n\n       would support Sanders\u2019s request for a reckless homicide instruction. The trial\n\n       court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Sander\u2019s request.\n\n\n[24]   Affirmed.\n\n\n[25]   Mathias, J., and Brown, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 45A04-1506-CR-648 | February 8, 2016   Page 13 of 13\n\f",
