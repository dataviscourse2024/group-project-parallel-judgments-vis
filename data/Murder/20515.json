WR-40,719-05\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEX PARTE MICHAEL NAWEE BLAIR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON APPLICATION FOR POST-CONVICTION WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM CAUSE NO. W366-81344-93(HC4) IN THE 366TH DISTRICT COURT\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLIN COUNTY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPer Curiam. \r\n\r\n\r\nO R D E R\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThis is a subsequent application for writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to the\r\nprovisions of Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 11.071 \u00a7 5.\r\n\r\n\tIn September 1994, a jury found applicant guilty of the offense of capital murder.  The\r\njury answered the special issues submitted pursuant to Texas Code of Criminal Procedure\r\nArticle 37.071, and the trial court, accordingly, set applicant's punishment at death.  This\r\nCourt affirmed applicant's conviction and sentence on direct appeal.  Blair v. State, No.\r\n72,009 (Tex. Crim. App. Sept. 25, 1996) (not designated for publication).  Applicant filed\r\nhis initial post-conviction application for writ of habeas corpus in the convicting court on\r\nJanuary 20, 1998.  This Court denied applicant relief.  Ex parte Blair, No. WR-40,719-01\r\n(Tex Crim. App. Apr. 7, 1999)(not designated for publication).  The Court dismissed\r\napplicant's first subsequent application on September 13, 2000, and remanded his second\r\nsubsequent application to the trial court on May 30, 2001, to consider five of the issues\r\nraised.  Ex parte Blair, Nos. WR-40,719-02 and -03 (Tex. Crim. App. Sept. 13, 2000 and\r\nMay 30, 2001)(neither designated for publication).  The second subsequent application is still\r\npending in the trial court. \r\n\r\n\tApplicant presents one allegation in the instant application.  Specifically, he asserts\r\nthat newly discovered evidence shows him to be actually innocent of the crime of which he\r\nhas been convicted.  We have reviewed the application and find that the allegation satisfies\r\nthe requirements of Article 11.071 \u00a7 5.  Accordingly, we remand the application to the trial\r\ncourt to consider applicant's claim.  Because the second subsequent application is still\r\npending in the trial court, and because the claim raised here is a companion claim to those\r\nraised in that application, we order the trial court to resolve the issues and return both cases\r\nto this Court within 120 days of the date of this order. \r\n\r\n\tIT IS SO ORDERED THIS THE 13TH DAY OF DECEMBER, 2006.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Publish \r\n\r\n\r\n",
