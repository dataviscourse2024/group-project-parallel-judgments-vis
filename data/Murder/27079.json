We find no error.\n\n                                   I. Background\n\n      Four men from Jacksonville, North Carolina drove to Garland, North Carolina\n\non the morning of 5 March 2015 intending to purchase marijuana. Michael Harbin\n\ndrove his mother\u2019s black Toyota Camry vehicle, with Carlos James and Derrick\n\f                                  STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nCopeland as passengers. A fourth man followed Harbin, driving a Ford Explorer\n\nvehicle. Copeland had set up the drug purchase from Jafa McKoy in Garland.\n\n       The men arrived in Garland between 10:00 and 10:30 a.m. The driver of the\n\nExplorer parked at a nearby apartment complex and stayed with that vehicle.\n\nHarbin, James, and Copeland drove down a side road to a house located at 90 Sugar\n\nHill Lane, in an area of Garland with a reputation for drug trafficking. They observed\n\ntwo men. Copeland recognized McKoy standing in front of the porch, while another\n\nman was observed sitting on the porch. McKoy introduced the other man as \u201cP.\u201d\n\nNeither Copeland nor Harbin knew or had met \u201cP.\u201d\n\n       McKoy told the three men the marijuana was not present, so they went to buy\n\ncigarettes at a nearby gas station. They left the gas station at 11:13 a.m. and\n\nreturned to Sugar Hill Lane, after a quick stop at the Explorer. They again saw\n\nMcKoy and \u201cP,\u201d but also saw a compact car and a third man, not previously present.\n\n       McKoy told Copeland the marijuana was inside the compact car. Copeland\n\ngestured to Harbin to accompany him and both men started walking towards the\n\ncompact car. As they walked, Harbin turned and saw the unknown third man behind\n\nhim.\n\n       James was left inside Harbin\u2019s mother\u2019s Camry with its keys. \u201cP\u201d jumped off\n\nthe porch holding a revolver and moved towards the Camry. McKoy held a gun,\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                                  STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nturned towards Copeland and Harbin, and shot at them. Copeland and Harbin\n\nescaped by running into the woods, without knowing what had happened to James.\n\n      Copeland and Harbin returned to the Explorer, still parked with its driver at\n\nthe nearby apartment complex, and the three men rode back to Sugar Hill Lane\n\nlooking for James. They could not find him and returned to the gas station at 11:49\n\na.m. After trying to contact James by phone and failing to reach him, Harbin called\n\nthe police at 12:24 p.m.\n\n      Freddie Stokes, a resident of the house at 90 Sugar Hill Lane, returned home\n\naround 12:30 p.m. He saw a body in his driveway and a parked black vehicle beside\n\nthe body. Stokes called the police around 12:33 p.m. The police found James laying\n\non his back. He had been shot once in the back of the head and was dead. The police\n\nfound no money in James\u2019 pockets or in his wallet.\n\n      Police showed Harbin two photographic line-ups of eight photos at the police\n\nstation that afternoon. Harbin identified McKoy in the first set of photos. Harbin\n\nwas unable to identify a suspect from the second set of photos.\n\n      Copeland\u2019s probation officer showed him a photographic line-up of eight photos\n\nfour days after James\u2019 murder on 9 March 2015.            He identified Defendant\u2019s\n\nphotograph as a suspect for the man introduced by McKoy as \u201cP\u201d with 85 to 90 percent\n\nconfidence. He also identified another man\u2019s photograph as a suspect with 60 percent\n\nconfidence.\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f                                  STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                 Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation Agent William Brady (\u201cAgent\n\nBrady\u201d) interviewed Defendant nearly two weeks after James\u2019 death on 18 March\n\n2015 at the request of the Sampson County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Defendant was provided\n\nhis Miranda rights and initially told Agent Brady he was not present at Sugar Hill\n\nLane in Garland on 5 March 2015.        Approximately seventeen minutes into the\n\ninterview, Defendant admitted he was present at that address on that morning.\n\nDefendant told Agent Brady he had arrived at 90 Sugar Hill Lane, which he called\n\n\u201cthe dope hole,\u201d early in the morning, but asserted he had left by 8:30 or 9:00 a.m.\n\nthat morning.\n\n      Defendant denied seeing a black car while there but did see a gray car among\n\nseveral cars with people coming to and going from the area. He denied any knowledge\n\nof the men from Jacksonville or of the drug deal Copeland had arranged with McKoy.\n\n      Defendant also repeatedly denied killing anyone or being present when\n\nsomeone was killed. At some point during the interview, Defendant admitted to\n\nAgent Brady: \u201cMaybe they saw me on the porch.\u201d Defendant told Agent Brady he\n\ndrove north to his cousin\u2019s house in Newton Grove after he had left Sugar Hill Lane.\n\n      Defendant was indicted for first-degree murder, possession of a firearm by a\n\nfelon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, robbery with a\n\ndeadly weapon, two counts of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, and attaining\n\nhabitual felon status.\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f                                  STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                 Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      At trial, the State presented testimony from Jane Peterson, who had been\n\ndating Defendant at or about the time of James\u2019 death.           Peterson described\n\nDefendant\u2019s appearance at the time: he \u201chad a beard, cut close\u201d and had a tattoo on\n\nhis arm and one on his face.\n\n      During Peterson\u2019s voir dire testimony, while the jury was not present, the trial\n\ncourt heard arguments about a photograph of Defendant which the State sought to\n\nhave admitted for illustrative purposes. The State argued for its admission into\n\nevidence:\n\n             Your Honor, I have just asked Ms. Peterson how Mr.\n             Parker appeared back in March of 2015 as opposed to how\n             he appears today or any other time, and she\u2019s described\n             him as having a beard, tattoos. Your Honor, other\n             witnesses have described the man on the porch having a\n             beard. A witness testified that he -- the man on the porch\n             had a tattoo on his chest. Your Honor, and, as I have said,\n             it would illustrate her testimony.\n\n      The State could not specify who took the photograph or when it was taken but\n\ngave the court assurances that Peterson had verified it was a fair and accurate\n\nrepresentation of how Defendant had appeared in March 2015. Defendant objected\n\non several grounds, including the lack of a proper foundation and that the photograph\n\nwas more prejudicial than probative under N.C. R. Evid. 403.\n\n      The trial court conducted a voir dire of Peterson\u2019s testimony and ruled the\n\nphotograph would be admissible for illustrative purposes only. The State moved to\n\nadmit the evidence upon the jury\u2019s return. Defendant objected and the trial court\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f                                  STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\noverruled Defendant\u2019s standing objection and admitted the photograph for\n\nillustrative purposes only. The State asked Peterson to show the photograph to the\n\njury and confirm it was consistent with Defendant\u2019s appearance in March 2015.\n\n      The State obtained a probable cause search warrant for Defendant\u2019s cell phone\n\nrecords on 18 March 2015. The State tendered and the trial court accepted a Federal\n\nBureau of Investigation special agent, Michael Sutton (\u201cFBI Agent Sutton\u201d), as an\n\nexpert witness on historical cell site analysis and cellular technology. FBI Agent\n\nSutton testified Defendant\u2019s phone was being used in an area of Garland which\n\nincludes Sugar Hill Lane from approximately 8:09 to 9:57 a.m. on 5 March 2015.\n\nFrom 9:57 to approximately 11:38 a.m., Defendant\u2019s phone was not in use and no\n\nlocation could be identified.\n\n      Defendant\u2019s phone was once again located by the same cell tower in Garland\n\nat 11:38 a.m., but was then north/northwest of its previous location, towards Clinton.\n\nBy 11:49 a.m., Defendant\u2019s phone was located in Clinton, not Newton Grove. FBI\n\nAgent Sutton testified he did not analyze Defendant\u2019s cell site records past 11:49 a.m.\n\n      Defendant moved to dismiss all charges for insufficiency of the evidence at the\n\nclose of the State\u2019s presentation of its case. The trial court found the State had\n\npresented insufficient evidence tending to show Defendant possessed the specific\n\nintent to kill under a theory of acting in concert and dismissed the counts of assault\n\nwith a deadly weapon with intent to kill. The trial court denied Defendant\u2019s motion\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f                                     STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nto dismiss the remaining charges. Defendant did not testify or present any evidence\n\nat trial.\n\n         The jury found Defendant guilty of possession of a firearm by a felon. The jury\n\nfound Defendant not guilty of the remaining charges. Defendant stipulated and pled\n\nguilty to attaining habitual felon status. The trial court determined Defendant was\n\na Prior Record Level V offender and sentenced Defendant as a habitual felon to an\n\nactive term of 105 to 138 months in prison. Defendant gave notice of appeal in open\n\ncourt.\n\n                                     II. Jurisdiction\n\n         This Court possesses jurisdiction over Defendant\u2019s appeal from judgment as a\n\nmatter of right pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 7A-27(b)(1) and 15A-1444(a) (2019).\n\n                                        III. Issues\n\n         Defendant argues the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the\n\ncharge of possession of a firearm by a felon for insufficient evidence. Defendant also\n\nargues the State misrepresented evidence before the trial court and made false and\n\nmisleading statements to the jury during closing arguments, which deprived him of\n\na fair trial.\n\n                                  IV. Motion to Dismiss\n\n                                  A. Standard of Review\n\n                The standard for ruling on a motion to dismiss is whether\n                there is substantial evidence (1) of each essential element\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\f                                  STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n             of the offense charged and (2) that defendant is the\n             perpetrator of the offense. Substantial evidence is relevant\n             evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as\n             adequate to support a conclusion. In ruling on a motion to\n             dismiss, the trial court must consider all of the evidence in\n             the light most favorable to the State, and the State is\n             entitled to all reasonable inferences which may be drawn\n             from the evidence.\n\nState v. Weakley, 176 N.C. App. 642, 651, 627 S.E.2d 315, 321 (2006) (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n                                     B. Analysis\n\n      Defendant argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss all\n\ncharges for insufficient evidence. The State\u2019s eyewitnesses did not provide a positive\n\nidentification of Defendant at trial. Defendant asserts the other evidence connecting\n\nhim to James\u2019 death was circumstantial and insufficient. Viewing the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the State, we disagree.\n\n      Defendant argues the State offered insufficient direct evidence, and the State\u2019s\n\ncircumstantial evidence raised only conjecture that Defendant was the same man\n\nMcKoy had identified as \u201cP.\u201d         This argument discounts the materiality of\n\ncircumstantial evidence on a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss and our\n\nstandard of review on appeal.\n\n             The test for sufficiency of the evidence is the same whether\n             the evidence is direct or circumstantial, or both.\n             Circumstantial evidence may withstand a motion to\n             dismiss and support a conviction even when the evidence\n             does not rule out every hypothesis of innocence. If a\n             reasonable inference of defendant\u2019s guilt may be drawn\n\n                                         -8-\n\f                                  STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n             from the circumstances, then it is for the jury to decide\n             whether the facts, taken singly or in combination, satisfy it\n             beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is actually\n             guilty.\n\nState v. McDaniel, 372 N.C. 594, 603-04, 831 S.E.2d 283, 290 (2019) (emphasis\n\nsupplied) (citations, alterations, and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Presuming, arguendo, but without deciding the State offered no direct evidence\n\nthat Defendant was the man identified by McKoy as \u201cP,\u201d the State\u2019s case survives a\n\nmotion to dismiss with sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a reasonable\n\ninference of Defendant\u2019s guilt. See id.\n\n      To support the trial court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the\n\nremaining charges, Defendant voluntarily admitted he was present at 90 Sugar Hill\n\nLane on the morning of James\u2019 death, and that he might have been seen by Copeland,\n\nHarbin, and James on the porch with McKoy. Defendant\u2019s cell phone was located in\n\nGarland near the scene close to the approximate time of the incident.\n\n      Copeland identified Defendant from a photo array as the armed suspect on the\n\nporch and present at the scene with \u201c85 to 90 percent\u201d confidence. Copeland testified\n\n\u201cP\u201d had a \u201cbeard, brown skin, [and a] tattoo on the upper cheek,\u201d and estimated he\n\nwas about 6\u20192\u201d tall and weighed about 240 pounds. Harbin testified \u201cP\u201d was wearing\n\na hat, had a beard, and \u201cwas like a burley dude, like a kind of bigger dude.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f                                  STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      The State also presented testimony from Jane Peterson, Defendant\u2019s girlfriend\n\nat the time of the incident. She described Defendant\u2019s appearance at the time: he\n\n\u201chad a beard, cut close\u201d and had one tattoo \u201con his arms and one on his face.\u201d\n\n      Although this evidence may not rule out every hypothesis of Defendant\u2019s\n\ninnocence, that is not the State\u2019s burden on Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Id. at\n\n604, 831 S.E.2d at 290. The evidence is sufficient to support a reasonable inference\n\nof Defendant\u2019s guilt, when viewed in the light most favorable to the State. See id.\n\nThe trial court correctly ruled the State presented sufficient evidence to submit the\n\nremaining charges to the jury. Defendant\u2019s argument is overruled.\n\n                            V. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n      Defendant argues he is entitled to a new trial because prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct denied him a fair trial.        Defendant argues the State made false\n\nstatements about testimonial evidence on four occasions during the trial: once while\n\narguing for the admission of the photograph of Defendant for illustrative purposes,\n\nand three times during closing argument.\n\n      Arguing for the admission of the photograph, the prosecution stated, \u201ca witness\n\ntestified that he -- the man on the porch had a tattoo on his chest.\u201d Although\n\nDefendant\u2019s girlfriend, Peterson, had just testified to this fact about Defendant, no\n\nwitness had testified to this description of \u201cP.\u201d The prosecution mentioned witness\u2019\n\ntestimony that \u201cP\u201d had a chest tattoo three more times during closing arguments.\n\n\n\n                                         - 10 -\n\f                                    STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nThe prosecution twice attributed this alleged testimony to Copeland, who never\n\ntestified that \u201cP\u201d had a chest tattoo.\n\n                        A. Constitutional Right to a Fair Trial\n\n      Our Supreme Court has stated the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution\n\nof the United States guarantees that \u201c[e]very person charged with a crime has an\n\nabsolute right to a fair trial. . . . It is the duty of both the court and the prosecuting\n\nattorney to see that this right is sustained.\u201d State v. Williams, 362 N.C. 628, 638, 669\n\nS.E.2d 290, 298 (2008) (citation omitted). \u201cThe district attorney owes honesty and\n\nfervor to the State and fairness to the defendant in the performance of his duties as\n\na prosecutor.\u201d State v. Britt, 288 N.C. 699, 710, 220 S.E.2d 283, 290 (1975).\n\n      However, \u201ca constitutional question which is not raised and passed upon in the\n\ntrial court will not ordinarily be considered on appeal.\u201d State v. Hunter, 305 N.C. 106,\n\n112, 286 S.E.2d 535, 539 (1982); see also N.C. R. App. P. 10(a). Defendant did not\n\nraise a constitutional objection to any of the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements that a\n\nwitness testified \u201cthe man on the porch had a tattoo on his chest.\u201d\n\n      Defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the admissibility of the photograph on multiple\n\ngrounds during arguments outside the presence of the jury but made no\n\nconstitutional arguments.      Defendant argued the State had not laid a proper\n\nfoundation for the photograph, and the danger of prejudice to Defendant by its\n\nadmission substantially outweighed its probative value under N.C. R. Evid. 403.\n\n\n\n                                          - 11 -\n\f                                   STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nDefendant\u2019s counsel did not object on any grounds, constitutional or otherwise, to the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s statement to the court outside the presence of the jury that a \u201cwitness\n\ntestified that . . . the man on the porch had a tattoo on his chest.\u201d\n\n      Defendant failed to object to any statements made during the State\u2019s closing\n\narguments. Defendant\u2019s constitutional argument was not \u201craised and passed upon\n\nin the trial court\u201d and so we do not consider this asserted basis on appeal. Id. Because\n\nDefendant\u2019s arguments also raise the distinct issue of improper closing arguments,\n\nwe proceed to review that issue separately.\n\n                                 B. Closing Argument\n\n                                 1. Standard of Review\n\n             The standard of review for assessing alleged improper\n             closing arguments that fail to provoke timely objection\n             from opposing counsel is whether the remarks were so\n             grossly improper that the trial court committed reversible\n             error by failing to intervene ex mero motu. In other words,\n             the reviewing court must determine whether the argument\n             in question strayed far enough from the parameters of\n             propriety that the trial court, in order to protect the rights\n             of the parties and the sanctity of the proceedings, should\n             have intervened on its own accord and: (1) precluded other\n             similar remarks from the offending attorney; and/or (2)\n             instructed the jury to disregard the improper comments\n             already made.\n\nState v. Jones, 355 N.C. 117, 133, 558 S.E.2d 97, 107 (2002) (citation omitted).\n\nProsecutors\u2019 arguments must be devoid of appeals to passion or prejudice. Id. at 135,\n\n558 S.E.2d at 108.\n\n\n\n                                          - 12 -\n\f                                    STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      Our Supreme Court also cautioned that an appellate court should \u201cnot review\n\nthe exercise of this discretion unless there be such gross impropriety in the argument\n\nas would be likely to influence the verdict of the jury.\u201d State v. Covington, 290 N.C.\n\n313, 328, 226 S.E.2d 629, 640 (1976). \u201c[F]or an inappropriate prosecutorial comment\n\nto justify a new trial, it must be sufficiently grave that it is prejudicial error.\u201d State\n\nv. Soyars, 332 N.C. 47, 60, 418 S.E.2d 480, 487-88 (1992) (citation and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n                                       2. Analysis\n\n             In North Carolina it is well settled that counsel is allowed\n             wide latitude in the argument to the jury. Even so, counsel\n             may not, by argument or cross-examination, place before\n             the jury incompetent and prejudicial matters by injecting\n             his own knowledge, beliefs, and personal opinions not\n             supported by the evidence. A prosecutor must present the\n             State\u2019s case vigorously while at the same time guarding\n             against statements which might prejudice the defendant\u2019s\n             right to a fair trial.\n\nState v. Hill, 311 N.C. 465, 472-73, 319 S.E.2d 163, 168 (1984) (citations and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n      Later that year after the opinion in Hill was filed, our Supreme Court in State\n\nv. Huffstetler further expounded: \u201cArguments of counsel are largely in the control and\n\ndiscretion of the trial court. The appellate courts ordinarily will not review the\n\nexercise of that discretion unless the impropriety of counsel\u2019s remarks is extreme and\n\nis clearly calculated to prejudice the jury.\u201d State v. Huffstetler, 312 N.C. 92, 111, 322\n\nS.E.2d 110, 122 (1984).\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\f                                  STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      \u201cThe prosecuting attorney should use every honorable means to secure a\n\nconviction, but it is his duty to exercise proper restraint so as to avoid misconduct,\n\nunfair methods or overzealous partisanship which would result in taking unfair\n\nadvantage of the accused.\u201d State v. Holmes, 296 N.C. 47, 50, 249 S.E.2d 380, 382\n\n(1978).\n\n      If Defendant or his counsel believes the State\u2019s argument is improper, they are\n\nobliged to speak and object to preserve the error for appellate review. Our Supreme\n\nCourt cautioned:\n\n             When [a] defendant does not object to comments made by\n             the prosecutor during closing arguments, only an extreme\n             impropriety on the part of the prosecutor will compel this\n             Court to hold that the trial judge abused his discretion in\n             not recognizing and correcting ex mero motu an argument\n             that defense counsel apparently did not believe was\n             prejudicial when originally spoken.\n\nState v. Richardson, 342 N.C. 772, 786, 467 S.E.2d 685, 693 (1996).\n\n      Here, the State argued to the jury on three occasions during closing arguments\n\nthat eyewitness testimony described \u201cP\u201d as having a chest tattoo, when the only\n\ntestimony at trial about a chest tattoo had been in reference to Defendant. Defendant\n\nargues the State\u2019s case was \u201cexceedingly thin\u201d and was based solely on Copeland\u2019s\n\nand Harbin\u2019s identifications of Defendant as \u201cP.\u201d As such, Defendant asserts these\n\nthree misstatements rise to the level of prejudicial error to award a new trial.\n\n      Defendant correctly quotes the State\u2019s closing argument as stating the \u201cbottom\n\nline in this case\u201d was: \u201cWho is the man on the porch?\u201d Defendant has not carried the\n\n                                         - 14 -\n\f                                  STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nburden of showing the repeated, mistaken invocation of supposed eyewitness\n\ntestimony that \u201cP\u201d had a chest tattoo was so grossly improper \u201cas would be likely to\n\ninfluence the verdict of the jury.\u201d Covington, 290 N.C. at 328, 226 S.E.2d at 640. The\n\nchest tattoo was not the sole characteristic the State relied on to identify Defendant\n\nas \u201cP.\u201d The eyewitness testimony describing \u201cP\u201d was also consistent with Defendant\u2019s\n\nheight, frame, skin color, beard, and other tattoos. The State\u2019s misstatements may\n\nhave given the jury greater confidence in identifying Defendant as \u201cP,\u201d but Defendant\n\nhas failed to show that the jury would have reached a different verdict without the\n\nthree misstatements.\n\n      As noted, the prosecution\u2019s comments erroneously summarized the evidence\n\nand were improper. However, Defendant has also failed to show the remarks were\n\nso grossly or extremely improper for us to conclude the trial judge \u201cabused his\n\ndiscretion in not recognizing and correcting ex mero motu an argument that defense\n\ncounsel apparently did not believe was prejudicial when originally spoken.\u201d\n\nRichardson, 342 N.C. at 786, 467 S.E.2d at 693.          Defendant\u2019s arguments are\n\noverruled.\n\n                                   VI. Conclusion\n\n      When viewed in the light most favorable to the State, including the reasonable\n\ninferences thereon, the State presented sufficient evidence for all the remaining\n\ncharges including possession of a firearm by a felon to be submitted to the jury. The\n\n\n\n                                         - 15 -\n\f                                  STATE V. PARKER\n\n                                 Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\ntrial court properly denied Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges submitted to\n\nthe jury.\n\n      Defendant failed to raise a constitutional question or object at trial with\n\nrespect to the prosecution\u2019s misstatements about eyewitness testimony. Without\n\nobjection from Defendant, the State\u2019s closing argument was not prejudicial error to\n\naward a new trial. Defendant has also failed to show any error in the trial court\u2019s\n\ndiscretionary and asserted failure to intervene ex mero motu.\n\n      Defendant received a fair trial, free from prejudicial errors he preserved and\n\nargued. We find no prejudicial error in the jury\u2019s verdict or in the judgment entered\n\nthereon. It is so ordered.\n\n      NO ERROR.\n\n      Judges DILLON and MURPHY concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 16 -\n\f",
