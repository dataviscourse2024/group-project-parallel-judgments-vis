WR-94,650-01\n\n\n              EX PARTE EDIBERTO ANTONIO DELEON, Applicant\n\n\n            ON APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\n            CAUSE NO. 83201-CR IN THE 149TH DISTRICT COURT\n                           BRAZORIA COUNTY\n\n\n       SLAUGHTER, J., filed a concurring opinion.\n\n                               CONCURRING OPINION\n\n       I join in the Court\u2019s decision to grant Applicant postconviction habeas relief in the\n\nform of an out-of-time petition for discretionary review. I write separately to emphasize\n\nthe importance of appellate counsel\u2019s duty to provide timely and accurate information to\n\nclients regarding their right to file a pro se PDR following the resolution of their direct\n\nappeals. It appears that appellate counsel here failed to inform Applicant of the court of\n\nappeals\u2019 ruling on his direct appeal, thereby depriving him of his ability to pursue review\n\nin this Court. This situation happens far too frequently and is a troubling sign that some\n\f                                                                                   DeLeon - 2\n\n\nappellate attorneys are failing to properly communicate with their clients (particularly those\n\nwho are incarcerated) regarding their right to seek discretionary review.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       Following Applicant\u2019s conviction for murder in 2019, appellate counsel was\n\nappointed to represent him for his direct appeal. The court of appeals affirmed Applicant\u2019s\n\nconviction on August 24, 2021. DeLeon v. State, No. 01-19-00695-CR, 2021 WL 3728881\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] Aug. 24, 2021, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for\n\npublication). But, Applicant alleges that appellate counsel never informed him of the court\n\nof appeals\u2019 decision, thereby foreclosing Applicant\u2019s ability to timely pursue a pro se PDR\n\nwith this Court. In fact, Applicant alleges that it was not until September 4, 2022, that he\n\nlearned that his direct appeal was denied. And that information was provided to him by a\n\nfamily member who checked on the status of his appeal through the court\u2019s website.\n\n       In response to Applicant\u2019s allegations, appellate counsel filed an affidavit stating\n\nthat it was his customary procedure to send a copy of the appellate court\u2019s decision to the\n\ndefendant upon notification that an opinion had been issued, along with \u201ccomments\n\nconcerning the decision and what the defendant may do in accordance with the decision.\u201d\n\nDespite this customary procedure, appellate counsel concedes that after reviewing all of\n\nhis notes, he is \u201cunable to find any evidence that [he] sent to [Applicant] notice that his\n\ncase had been affirmed and notice that he could appear pro se.\u201d Appellate counsel further\n\nrecognizes that Applicant should be entitled to \u201ctake advantage of all appellate rights.\u201d\n\nII.    Appellate Counsel\u2019s Duties Under the Appellate Rules\n\f                                                                                    DeLeon - 3\n\n\n       Criminal defendants have a constitutional right to the effective assistance of\n\ncounsel. U.S. CONST. AMEND. VI; Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686 (1984).\n\nThis right to effective assistance extends to the first direct appeal. Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S.\n\n387, 395\u201396 (1985); Ward v. State, 740 S.W.2d 794, 799 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987).\n\nAlthough a criminal defendant has no right to the assistance of counsel for purposes of\n\nactually pursuing discretionary review, his appellate counsel still has the duty to advise\n\nhim regarding his right to file a pro se PDR. In re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d 403, 411 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2008) (detailing appellate counsel\u2019s duties to clients upon denial of relief on\n\nappeal). This obligation is codified in the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure:\n\n       In criminal cases, the attorney representing the defendant on appeal shall,\n       within five days after the opinion is handed down, send his client a copy\n       of the opinion and judgment, along with notification of the defendant\u2019s\n       right to file a pro se petition for discretionary review under Rule 68. This\n       notification shall be sent certified mail, return receipt requested, to the\n       defendant at his last known address. The attorney shall also send the court of\n       appeals a letter certifying his compliance with this rule and attaching a copy\n       of the return receipt within the time for filing a motion for rehearing. The\n       court of appeals shall file this letter in its record of the appeal.\nTEX. R. APP. P. 48.4 (emphasis added).\n\n       Here, appellate counsel clearly failed to comply with the requirements of the\n\nappellate rules when he neglected to send Applicant a copy of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion,\n\nalong with notification of Applicant\u2019s right to file a pro se PDR. Unfortunately, counsel\u2019s\n\nfailure to properly advise Applicant has deprived Applicant of his opportunity to pursue an\n\nentire proceeding. Ex parte Owens, 206 S.W.3d 670, 675 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006).\n\nIII.   Appellate Counsel\u2019s Duties Under the Rules of Professional Conduct\n\f                                                                                     DeLeon - 4\n\n\n       More generally, I also note here that the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional\n\nConduct require lawyers to keep clients reasonably informed of any case developments\n\nand to effectively communicate with their clients in a manner that permits the clients to\n\nmake informed decisions related to their cases. Tex. Disciplinary Rules Prof\u2019l Conduct R.\n\n1.03(a)\u2013(b). Further, \u201cin representing a client, a lawyer shall not[] neglect a legal matter\n\nentrusted to the lawyer.\u201d Id. R. 1.01(b)(1).\n\n       Ultimately, appellate counsel\u2019s failure to adequately communicate with clients\n\nabout the status of their direct appeals is unfair to clients and falls short of the standard for\n\nprofessionalism set forth in the disciplinary rules. Not only this, but it results in\n\nunnecessary burdens on the courts and causes judicial inefficiency that wastes taxpayer\n\ndollars. I certainly understand and acknowledge that we are all human beings who make\n\nmistakes. But, based on the sheer volume of writ applications this Court sees annually in\n\nwhich this or similar problems arise, I feel that it is my ethical obligation to bring attention\n\nto this issue so that attorneys may be reminded of the effect of failing to properly\n\ncommunicate with their clients. See Tex. Code Jud. Conduct, Canon 3(D)(2) (\u201cA judge\n\nwho receives information clearly establishing that a lawyer has committed a violation of\n\nthe Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct should take appropriate action.\u201d). It\n\nis my hope that, by bringing attention to this issue, appellate attorneys will be motivated to\n\ntake steps to ensure that such situations do not occur in the future.\n\n       With these comments, I join the Court\u2019s opinion.\n\nFiled: April 26, 2023\n\nPublish\n\f",
