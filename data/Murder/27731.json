Hon. Lynn G. Norton, District Judge.\n\n       Judgment of the district court summarily dismissing successive petition for post-\n       conviction relief, affirmed.\n\n       Robroy Wall, Jr., Boise, pro se appellant.\n\n       Hon. Lawrence G. Wasden, Attorney General; Mark W. Olson, Deputy Attorney\n       General, Boise, for respondent.\n                 ________________________________________________\n\nGRATTON, Judge\n       Robroy Wall, Jr. appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment summarily dismissing Wall\u2019s\nsuccessive petition for post-conviction relief. Wall argues that the district court committed\nreversible error by dismissing his petition. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n                                                 I.\n                         FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       After a trial by jury, Wall was found guilty of first degree murder and a firearm sentencing\nenhancement. The district court imposed a unified term of life imprisonment with twenty-five\nyears determinate. Wall appealed and this Court affirmed his judgment of conviction and sentence\nin State v. Wall, Jr., 149 Idaho 548, 237 P.3d 17 (Ct. App. 2010).\n       In 2011, Wall filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The district court granted Wall\u2019s\nmotion for appointment of counsel and, after providing notice, summarily dismissed Wall\u2019s\n\n\n                                                 1\n\fpetition. In June 2016, Wall appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his post-conviction petition.\nThe Idaho Supreme Court dismissed Wall\u2019s appeal as untimely and entered a remittitur. In\nNovember 2016, Wall filed an Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) motion for relief from the\njudgment dismissing his post-conviction petition. The district court denied Wall\u2019s motion as\nuntimely and failing on the merits. Wall appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b)\nmotion and this Court affirmed the denial in Wall v. State, Docket No. 45166, (Ct. App. June 12,\n2018) (unpublished).\n       In July 2019, Wall filed a successive petition for post-conviction relief. Among other\nthings, Wall alleged ineffective assistance of trial and post-conviction counsel. In addition, Wall\nrequested appointment of counsel. After providing notice and denying Wall\u2019s request for counsel,\nthe district court summarily dismissed Wall\u2019s successive petition. Wall timely appeals.\n                                                 II.\n                                            ANALYSIS\n       Wall argues that the district court erred by summarily dismissing his successive petition\nfor post-conviction relief. Specifically, Wall contends that the district court erred because his\npetition \u201cclearly shows neglect by counsel at every stage of [his] case, plus shows a meritorious\ndefense.\u201d In response, the State argues that the district court correctly dismissed Wall\u2019s ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims because the claims were precluded by Idaho Code \u00a7 19-4908 and\nMurphy v. State, 156 Idaho 389, 395, 327 P.3d 365, 371 (2014). In addition, the State contends\nthat this Court can also affirm the lower court on the unchallenged basis that Wall\u2019s claim of\nineffective assistance of counsel was not based on newly discovered evidence and was untimely.1\nWe agree with the State.\n       If an initial post-conviction action was timely filed, an inmate may file a subsequent\npetition outside of the one-year limitation period if the court finds a ground for relief asserted\nwhich for sufficient reason was not asserted or was inadequately raised in the original,\n\n\n1\n        In his reply brief, Wall asserts a multitude of claims (which Wall labels under the following\nheaders: evidentiary issues, prosecutorial misconduct, denial of due process, denial of the right to\na fair trial, equal treatment under the law, actual and factual innocence, eighth amendment\nviolations, presumptions of innocence violations, errors in the record, cumulative error, and new\nevidence) that were not raised in his opening brief. Issues not raised in the opening brief are\nwaived for purposes of appeal. Idaho Appellate Rule 35(a)(6); State v. Hawkins, 159 Idaho 507,\n517, 363 P.3d 348, 358 (2009).\n\n                                                  2\n\fsupplemental, or amended petition. I.C. \u00a7 19-4908; Charboneau v. State, 144 Idaho 900, 904, 174\nP.3d 870, 874 (2007). There is no constitutionally protected right to the effective assistance of\ncounsel in post-conviction relief proceedings and such an allegation, in and of itself, is not among\nthe permissible grounds for post-conviction relief. See Follinus v. State, 127 Idaho 897, 902, 908\nP.2d 590, 595 (Ct. App. 1995); Wolfe v. State, 113 Idaho 337, 339, 743 P.2d 990, 992 (Ct. App.\n1987). Indeed, ineffective assistance of prior post-conviction counsel is no longer a sufficient\nreason for filing a successive petition for post-conviction relief. Murphy, 156 Idaho at 395, 327\nP.3d at 371. Analysis of sufficient reason permitting the filing of a successive petition includes an\nanalysis of whether the claims being made were asserted within a reasonable period of time.\nCharboneau, 144 Idaho at 905, 174 P.3d at 875. In determining what a reasonable time is for\nfiling a successive petition, we will consider it on a case-by-case basis. Id.\n       Here, the district court concluded that Wall\u2019s allegation that his post-conviction counsel\nwas ineffective was not a proper basis for a successive petition for post-conviction relief. In\naddition, the district court concluded that Wall\u2019s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective could\nhave been brought earlier, was not based on newly discovered evidence, and was untimely.\n       We conclude that the district court did not err by summarily dismissing Wall\u2019s successive\npetition for post-conviction relief. First, as the district court concluded, Wall\u2019s claim that his\npost-conviction counsel was ineffective is not a sufficient reason for filing a successive petition.\nMurphy, 156 Idaho at 395, 327 P.3d at 371 (2014). Therefore, Wall\u2019s claim, in that regard, fails.\nSecond, although Wall makes a conclusory statement that he has presented a \u201csufficient reason\u201d\nto file a successive petition, Wall does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that his\nineffective assistance of counsel claims failed to present new evidence and were untimely.2 In\nfact, in his answer to the district court\u2019s notice of intent to dismiss, Wall concedes as much stating\n\u201cCan your honor please excuse the untimel[i]ness of the successive post-conviction and even the\nfact that the evidence within is not newly discovered and base your honor[\u2019]s decis[]ion on the\nevidence within the successive post-conviction.\u201d Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s\nsummary dismissal of Wall\u2019s successive petition for post-conviction relief on this unchallenged\n\n\n\n\n2\n        Wall fails to show that any of his trial claims could not have been raised in his initial\npetition. Idaho Code \u00a7 19-4908.\n                                                  3\n\fbasis. See State v. Goodwin, 131 Idaho 364, 366, 956 P.2d 1311, 1313 (Ct. App. 1998) (upholding\nthe denial of a motion to suppress based on trial court\u2019s ruling that was unchallenged on appeal).3\n                                                III.\n                                         CONCLUSION\n       The district court did not err by summarily dismissing Wall\u2019s successive petition for\npost-conviction relief. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment summarily dismissing\nWall\u2019s successive petition for post-conviction relief.\n       Judge BRAILSFORD and Judge Pro Tem MELANSON CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n3\n        In addition, in his appellate brief, Wall makes a conclusory statement that he has shown a\n\u201cmeritorious defense\u201d to the underlying crime. However, Wall makes no further argument related\nto such a claim. To the extent that Wall is attempting to make a claim of actual innocence, Wall\nhas failed to appropriately support his claim with adequate argument or authority in his opening\nbrief. See State v. Zichko, 129 Idaho 259, 263, 923 P.2d 966, 970 (1996) (concluding that a party\nwaives an issue on appeal if either authority or argument is lacking). Moreover, Wall claimed\nactual innocence below and the district court concluded that Wall\u2019s claim failed because it was not\nsupported by new evidence. As discussed above, Wall concedes that his claims are not supported\nby new evidence. Thus, even if Wall supported a claim of actual innocence with argument or\nauthority, Wall\u2019s claim would fail.\n                                                 4\n\f",
