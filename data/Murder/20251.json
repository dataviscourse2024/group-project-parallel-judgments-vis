Wilson was sentenced to life in prison. He contends that the district court erred in\n\n(1) denying his request for mistrial based on a juror\u2019s alleged involvement in the murder\n\ninvestigation; and (2) overruling his objection to certain testimony as irrelevant and inflammatory.\n\nWe affirm the judgment of conviction.\n\n               As Wilson does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, we provide only a brief\n\nsummary of the facts. Wilson was involved in a dating relationship with Jasmin Alexander. Before\n\ndating Wilson, Alexander had been involved in a dating relationship with Roy Lee Taplin. Even\n\nafter the relationship between Alexander and Taplin had ended and while Alexander was dating\n\nWilson, Taplin continued to visit Alexander. These visits were sometimes sexual in nature and\n\nresulted in several altercations between Taplin and Wilson. On March 16, 2007, Taplin came to\n\fAlexander\u2019s house while Wilson was there. When Taplin entered the house, Wilson fatally shot\n\nTaplin in the face and neck with a shotgun.\n\n               Wilson was indicted for murder. A jury convicted Wilson as charged and assessed\n\na punishment of life in prison. Wilson appeals.\n\n               In his first point of error, Wilson contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nrequest for a mistrial following the discovery that one of the jurors had allegedly been involved in\n\nthe investigation of the case and was, according to Wilson, a potential witness in the case.\n\nAccording to the State, the district court properly denied Wilson\u2019s mistrial request because the juror\n\nhad no personal knowledge of the case and was, therefore, not a potential witness in the case.\n\n               Wilson complains of Juror No. 20 based on information revealed after voir dire.\n\nDuring voir dire, Juror No. 20 raised her hand to indicate that she had \u201cheard\u201d something about\n\nthe case. When questioned further, she stated that she worked as a secretary for the Temple Police\n\nDepartment. She indicated that she had heard about the murder but worked in a different department\n\nand, therefore, \u201cdidn\u2019t hear any of the specifics on the case.\u201d She further indicated that she thought\n\nshe could be fair, that \u201cwith my job, I feel like I could be even more [fair] because I do know\n\nyou have to listen to all of the evidence and you have to have all of the facts to have an opinion.\u201d\n\nJuror No. 20 was selected to be on the jury without objection. In the evening after voir dire and\n\nbefore trial on the merits commenced the next day, Joe Adcock, who was an employee of the Temple\n\nPolice Department and assisting in the investigation of the murder, informed the prosecutor that he\n\nhad measured the foot of Juror No. 20 to compare the measurement to a photo of a footprint he had\n\ntaken at the crime scene. According to the prosecutor:\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f       He [Adcock] went down and got her and said, \u201cHey, I need to use your foot. Can I\n       measure it for a murder case?\u201d She said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He measured it and sent her on her\n       way, and that was the extent of his involvement.\n\n\nIn light of this information, defense counsel objected to having Juror No. 20 sit on the panel on the\n\nbasis that \u201cshe\u2019s part of the investigation and would have some bias.\u201d\n\n               Article 35 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure governs jury selection. A juror\n\ncan be challenged for cause if he or she is a witness in the case. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.\n\nart. 35.16(a)(6) (West 2006). According to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the test for\n\ndetermining whether a person is a witness in a case is not whether the person is actually called to\n\nthe witness stand but whether the person \u201csaw the commission of the offense or was so closely\n\nconnected to the events of the offense or subsequent investigation as to be a \u2018witness\u2019 to the crime\n\nand its incidents\u201d or if he or she \u201chas personal knowledge of facts of the case.\u201d Wyle v. State,\n\n777 S.W.2d 709, 712 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989).\n\n               There is nothing in the record demonstrating that Juror No. 20 had personal\n\nknowledge of the facts of the case. As she stated in voir dire, she knew that a murder had happened\n\non March 16, but knew none of the details. An investigator\u2019s measuring her foot for some\n\nundisclosed purpose, without more, revealed nothing about the details of the case or its investigation.\n\nThere is no evidence in this record that Juror No. 20 learned anything about this case based on the\n\ncontact with the investigator. Without personal knowledge of the case, Juror No. 20 was not a\n\npotential witness in the case. Accordingly, we overrule Wilson\u2019s first point of error.\n\n               In his second and third points of error, Wilson argues that the district court erred in\n\noverruling his objection to the admission of certain testimony. Wilson first complains about the\n\n                                                  3\n\ftestimony of Laquisha Waudby, who testified that she had gone to visit Taplin at his house the day\n\nbefore the murder and heard \u201c[a] lot of loud arguing amongst men.\u201d She testified that she recognized\n\nTaplin\u2019s voice and that a threat was made by another male\u2014\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\u201d\u2014but that she\n\ndid not recognize the voice of the person making the threat.1 According to Wilson:\n\n\n        [Waudby\u2019s testimony] was not relevant because she [Waudby] was unable to identify\n        the Appellant as being involved in that incident. . . . The testimony of Laquisha\n        Waudby was not relevant to the previous relationship existing between the accused\n        and the deceased nor the condition of the mind of the accused at the time of the\n        offense.\n\n\nAt trial, when Waudby testified as to what she had heard, defense counsel made the following\n\ninterjection:\n\n\n        Your Honor, if it please - Your Honor, if it please the Court, we need to have her, if\n        we can, identify who it was that allegedly made these utterances, please.\n\n\nThe trial court responded: \u201cI\u2019ll overrule.\u201d\n\n                Wilson also complains about the admission of Waudby\u2019s testimony regarding her\n\nfeelings when she learned that Taplin had been killed:\n\n\n        Q.      When you heard that, what did you think?\n\n        A.      I was in shock. I couldn\u2019t believe it. But it kind of came over me that -\n\n\n\n\n        1\n         Other witnesses also testified to observing the argument between Wilson and Taplin.\nAccording to the testimony of those witnesses, Wilson made threatening statements to Taplin.\n\n                                                  4\n\f       Defense counsel:        Your Honor, we feel this is objectionable for her to\n                               characterize any feelings that she had concerning the\n                               shooting, please, and we object.\n\n       Court:                  All right. I\u2019ll overrule, let her answer the question.\n\n\nWilson argues that defense counsel\u2019s objection to this testimony should have been sustained because\n\nthe testimony was inflammatory.\n\n                In order to preserve an issue for appellate review, a timely and specific objection is\n\nrequired. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1)(A); Tex. R. Evid. 103(a)(1); Gillenwaters v. State, 205 S.W.3d\n\n534, 537 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). Objections must be specific, first, to inform the trial judge of the\n\nreason for the objection and afford him an opportunity to rule on it and, second, to afford opposing\n\ncounsel the opportunity to respond to the complaint by removing the objection or supplying other\n\ntestimony. Saldano v. State, 70 S.W.3d 873, 887 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (citing Zillender v. State,\n\n557 S.W.2d 515, 517 (Tex. Crim. App. 1977)). A party\u2019s objection is adequately specific if the\n\nobjection informs the trial judge what the party wants and why he is entitled to it. Lankston v. State,\n\n827 S.W.2d 907, 909 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992). In Lankston, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\n\nexplained:\n\n\n       As regards specificity, all a party has to do to avoid the forfeiture of a complaint on\n       appeal is to let the trial judge know what he wants, why he thinks himself entitled to\n       it, and to do so clearly enough for the judge to understand him at a time when the\n       trial court is in a proper position to do something about it. Of course, when it seems\n       from context that a party failed effectively to communicate his desire, then reviewing\n       courts should not hesitate to hold that appellate complaints arising from the event\n       have been lost. But otherwise, they should reach the merits of those complaints\n       without requiring that the parties read some special script to make their wishes\n       known.\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fId. In both instances relevant here, defense counsel failed to state any grounds for his objection. In\n\nthe first instance, in fact, although the district court apparently interpreted counsel\u2019s statement as an\n\nobjection by overruling it, it is not clear that, in telling the court \u201cwe need to have her, if we can,\n\nidentify who it was that allegedly made these utterances, please,\u201d that counsel was objecting at all,\n\nmuch less that counsel was objecting as to relevance. In the second instance, defense counsel made\n\nit clear that he was objecting to the witness\u2019s statement, but did not make clear why the statement\n\nwas objectionable under the rules of evidence, and the record gives no indication that either the\n\ndistrict court or opposing counsel understood that the grounds for the objection was that counsel\n\nbelieved the testimony to be inflammatory. Cf., e.g., Gillenwaters, 205 S.W.3d at 538 (motion for\n\nnew trial was sufficient to convey movant\u2019s \u201cunconstitutionally vague as applied\u201d challenge even\n\nthough the word \u201cvague\u201d appeared nowhere in the motion because movant\u2019s consistent complaint\n\nthroughout trial was that statute was too vague to be enforceable; motion was insufficient to convey\n\n\u201cunconstitutionally overbroad as applied\u201d challenge where the word \u201coverbroad\u201d appeared nowhere\n\nin the motion, and movant had not challenged the statute on those grounds during trial); Lankston,\n\n827 S.W.2d at 909, 910-11 (hearsay objection sufficiently specific where \u201cit is clear from context\n\nthat both judge and prosecutor understood\u201d the basis for the objection).\n\n                   In the absence of sufficiently specific objections, the prosecutor had no opportunity\n\nto respond by removing the objectionable testimony or supplying other testimony. See Saldano,\n\n70 S.W.3d at 887 (citing Zillender, 557 S.W.2d at 517). Wilson failed to preserve any potential\n\nerror with respect to the testimony at issue. Accordingly, we overrule Wilson\u2019s second and third\n\npoints of error.\n\n\n\n                                                     6\n\f              Wilson\u2019s points of error are overruled, and the judgment of conviction is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            __________________________________________\n\n                                            G.
