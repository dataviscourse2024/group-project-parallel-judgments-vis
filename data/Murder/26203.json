INTRODUCTION\n   A court sentenced Sydney L. Thieszen to life imprison-\nment for a murder he committed at age 14. Pursuant to Miller\nv. Alabama,1 Thieszen obtained postconviction relief. The\ncourt resentenced Thieszen to 70 years\u2019 to life imprisonment.\nBecause we find no abuse of discretion by the court, we affirm\nThieszen\u2019s sentence.\n                      II. BACKGROUND\n                  1. Crime and Direct A ppeal\n   The facts and circumstances pertaining to Thieszen\u2019s crimes\nare set out in greater detail in our decision resolving his\ndirect appeal.2 In 1987, 14-year-old Thieszen shot and killed\n\n\u20021\t\n      Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460, 132 S. Ct. 2455, 183 L. Ed. 2d 407\n      (2012).\n\u20022\t\n      See State v. Thieszen, 232 Neb. 952, 442 N.W.2d 887 (1989).\n\f                                 - 114 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        300 Nebraska R eports\n                           STATE v. THIESZEN\n                           Cite as 300 Neb. 112\n\nhis 12-year-old sister, Sacha L. Thieszen. The State charged\nThieszen with first degree murder and use of a firearm in the\ncommission of a felony. Pursuant to a plea bargain, Thieszen\npled guilty to second degree murder and the use of a firearm\ncharge. In 1988, the district court imposed a sentence of life\nimprisonment for second degree murder and a consecutive\nsentence of 80 to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment for the fire-\narm conviction.\n   On appeal, Thieszen claimed that the district court abused\nits discretion in refusing to transfer his case to juvenile court\nand in imposing an excessive sentence on the firearm charge.\nWe disagreed. We recognized that there was evidence Thieszen\ncould possibly be successfully rehabilitated during the approx-\nimately 4 years that the juvenile court maintained jurisdiction\nover him, but that the record also supported the court\u2019s find-\nings that the crime was violent and that Thieszen may require\ntreatment beyond the age of majority.3 We noted that the\nsentence for the firearm conviction was within the statutory\nlimits, and we could not say that the court abused its discretion\nin imposing it.4\n\n                     2. First Postconviction\n                           and R etrial\n   In 1994, Thieszen filed a motion for postconviction relief,\nalleging that the operative information was defective because\nit failed to allege he acted with malice. The district court sus-\ntained the motion and vacated Thieszen\u2019s convictions.\n   The State then filed a second amended information which\ncharged Thieszen with first degree murder and use of a firearm\nto commit a felony. A jury convicted Thieszen of the charges.\nThe court again imposed sentences of life imprisonment for\nthe murder conviction and a consecutive term of 80 to 240\nmonths\u2019 imprisonment for the use of a firearm conviction.\n\n\u20023\t\n      See id.\n\u20024\t\n      See id.\n\f                                     - 115 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        300 Nebraska R eports\n                              STATE v.

Second Postconviction\n                     (a) Initial Proceedings\n   In 2013, Thieszen filed a motion for postconviction relief\npursuant to the decision in Miller.5 The district court vacated\nThieszen\u2019s life sentence, and the State appealed. We affirmed\nthe judgment and remanded the cause for resentencing.6\n                      (b) Mitigation Hearing\n   In March 2017, the district court received extensive evi-\ndence during a mitigation hearing.\n   Thieszen was born into an abusive environment. His natu-\nral mother was an alcoholic. On one occasion while she\nwas intoxicated, she tried to burn Thieszen\u2019s eyes out with\na lighter. She stomped on him at one time. When Thieszen\nwas 2 or 3 years old, she threw him in a swimming pool. She\ntried to run his hand through a meat grinder. Thieszen\u2019s natu-\nral mother also smashed his toys as punishment and locked\nhim in closets. When Thieszen was approximately age 4, he\nwas removed from his natural mother\u2019s custody due to abuse\nand neglect.\n   After multiple foster care placements, Thieszen was placed\nwith Edwin and Joyce Thieszen. Edwin and Joyce adopted\nThieszen when he was 9 years old. At that time, Edwin and\nJoyce had three biological children and two other adopted\nchildren. Initially, Thieszen wanted to keep his distance from\nthe family. But after approximately 1 year, he became very\nlovable and outgoing.\n   Although Edwin and Joyce offered a stable and structured\nenvironment, it may not have been a nurturing one. A doctor\nwho evaluated Thieszen in connection with the adoption proc\u00ad\ness expressed some reservation that the family\u2019s strong reli-\ngious beliefs may be too restrictive for a child with Thieszen\u2019s\nbackground. Edwin and Joyce believed in corporal punishment\n\n\u20025\t\n      Miller v. Alabama, supra note 1.\n\u20026\t\n      See State v. Thieszen, 295 Neb. 293, 887 N.W.2d 871 (2016).\n\f                             - 116 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                  300 Nebraska R eports\n                       STATE v. THIESZEN\n                       Cite as 300 Neb. 112\n\nfor rule violations. Edwin testified that he spanked the chil-\ndren when no other punishment worked and that he used his\nhand, a belt, a hose, or \u201cwhatever was handy.\u201d\n   When Thieszen was 12 years old, there was \u201ca sudden\ndrastic change in his behavior.\u201d His report cards reflected\nmuch lower grades, he ceased performing his chores properly,\nand he began shooting holes in the family\u2019s buildings and\nmachinery. In January 1986, Thieszen began seeing Sandra\nKroeker, a counselor, due to concerns about his poor grades\nand dishonesty. Kroeker felt that there was a great correla-\ntion between Thieszen\u2019s adolescent behavior and the abusive\nrelationship Thieszen had with his natural mother. Kroeker\ndiagnosed Thieszen with a conduct disorder. She testified that\nThieszen was immature in his ability to formulate and maintain\nrelationships, to express himself, to engage in effective deci-\nsionmaking, and to control impulses.\n   In December 1986, the family learned that Thieszen had\nbeen sexually molesting one of the family\u2019s foster children.\nAfter that point, Thieszen did not feel loved or wanted by his\nfamily. And he felt ostracized at school because the children\nthere knew of his sexual assault on his foster sister.\n   There was also evidence of voyeuristic behavior. One of\nThieszen\u2019s sisters testified that she noticed him watching her\nas she sunbathed. He pried open the doorjamb on the bath-\nroom and would consistently be outside the bathroom door\nwhile she was showering or changing. At one point, Thieszen\nentered her bedroom during the middle of the night and lifted\nher bed covers.\n   By the time Thieszen was 13 or 14 years old, he did not\nhave a good relationship with Joyce. He did not feel comfort-\nable discussing issues with her. One of Thieszen\u2019s classmates\ntestified that Thieszen often spoke about killing Joyce.\n   On the day of the murder, Thieszen wanted to run away\nfrom home because he knew he was going to be punished\nfor a wrongdoing. When Sacha tried to stop Thieszen, he hit\nher with a wooden rod, which caused bleeding. Sacha ran up\n\f                              - 117 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   300 Nebraska R eports\n                        STATE v. THIESZEN\n                        Cite as 300 Neb. 112\n\nthe stairs to the bathroom, and as she was leaning over the\nsink, Thieszen shot her in the back of the head. He put her\nbody in the bathtub and shot her twice more. Thieszen then\ntook the family\u2019s van and left. He was apprehended in Kansas\ndays later.\n   The court received the testimony of two psychiatrists that\nhad been offered in connection with Thieszen\u2019s request to\ntransfer his criminal case to juvenile court. One psychiatrist\nopined that Thieszen was competent to stand trial and that he\nwas sane at the time of the offense. He found significance in\nthe type of abuse that Thieszen had experienced as a very small\nchild and the number of foster homes that he had been in prior\nto adoption. He testified that Thieszen had a conduct disor-\nder, meaning that he displayed behavior that was not socially\nacceptable. The other psychiatrist, who interviewed Thieszen\nin December 1987, testified that Thieszen was not psychotic\nand was of average to slightly above-\u00adaverage intelligence.\n   Dr. Kayla Pope, a board-certified child and adolescent psy-\nchiatrist, testified at the mitigation hearing. She testified that\nneuroscience research demonstrated that adolescent brains\nwere different from adult brains. Adolescent brains were in\n\u201cdevelopmental transition\u201d and were \u201ccharacterized by nov-\nelty seeking, risk taking, poor judgment and increased sub-\nmission to peer pressure.\u201d Pope explained that the prefrontal\ncortex, which was the last part of the brain to develop, was\nthe part of the brain that overrides impulsive behavior and\nallows the weighing of the risks and benefits of the decisions\none makes. Pope testified that there are significant differ-\nences between the brains of a 14-year-old and a 17-year-old.\nAccording to Pope, adolescents \u201care thinking in the moment\u201d\nand lack the ability to see the long-term consequences of\ntheir actions.\n   Pope testified that high levels of stress can impact brain\ndevelopment. Early trauma would impair a child\u2019s develop-\nmental process. According to Pope, abuse by Thieszen\u2019s natu-\nral mother would interfere with the formation of a secure\n\f                             - 118 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   300 Nebraska R eports\n                       STATE v.

She testified that Thieszen was very immature,\nimpulsive, and unable to calm himself at the time of the mur-\nder. Pope believed Thieszen was behaving in an impulsive\nway at the time of the murder and that he did not appreci-\nate the consequences of what he was doing. She reported\nthat Thieszen \u201cstruggled to modify his behavior in light of\nthe consequences he faced.\u201d She noted that Edwin stated\nThieszen would repeatedly misbehave and would say that he\ndid not know why he did the things he did. As to Thieszen\u2019s\nintellectual capacity, Pope testified that he had a very high\nIQ. But she explained that intelligence is the ability to know\nthings and to figure things out; it is not a marker for develop-\nment or maturity.\n   Pope performed a comprehensive mental health evaluation.\nWith regard to Thieszen\u2019s prenatal history, Pope had concern\nthat his natural mother may have used drugs and alcohol\nwhile pregnant, which would impact Thieszen\u2019s brain devel-\nopment and behavior. She testified that Thieszen had no sig-\nnificant medical history and no substance abuse history prior\nto the murder.\n   Pope testified that Thieszen had many infractions during\nhis first few years in prison, but that there was a \u201cprecipi-\ntous drop\u201d in those infractions as he aged. She saw no evi-\ndence that Thieszen engaged in aggression or violent sexual\n\f                              - 119 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   300 Nebraska R eports\n                        STATE v. THIESZEN\n                        Cite as 300 Neb. 112\n\nbehavior while incarcerated. Pope testified that Thieszen did\nnot meet criteria for any mental health issue. She did not\nbelieve Thieszen had an antisocial personality disorder, stat-\ning that there was no evidence of any antisocial behavior in\nthe past 30 years. Pope testified that Thieszen had earned\nhis diploma through the GED program, had taken additional\ncoursework, and had been helping other inmates with their aca-\ndemic pursuits. Although there was evidence that Thieszen had\nengaged in substance abuse while in prison, his last infraction\nfor it was in 2000. Pope testified that Thieszen had over 200\nmisconduct reports, but that many were for minor violations,\nsuch as tattooing activities or having items not permitted in his\ncell. Records showed that as of January 18, 2017, Thieszen had\nonly four misconduct reports in the previous 5 years. Of those\nreports, the most serious offense was possessing or receiving\nunauthorized articles, for which Thieszen received 7 days of\nroom restriction.\n   Pope testified that Thieszen had formed several significant\nrelationships that he had kept for several years. This demon-\nstrated his ability to form a support network and to cultivate\nrelationships that would help sustain him in the community.\nAnd Pope testified that it was remarkable Thieszen had such\nability, because he had difficulty forming attachments early\nin development, and that his ability to form such relationships\nnow is an indication of his emotional maturity. Pope testified\nthat Thieszen expressed remorse for the crime.\n   Dr. Kirk Newring performed a psychological evaluation\nof Thieszen. On a diagnostic tool to assess violence risk and\npsychopathy, Thieszen scored a 12, which was higher than the\ncommunity average of 6, but lower than the typical inmate\nscore of 22. Newring testified that individuals with scores\nbelow 20 typically are not considered psychopathic. Newring\nadministered a personality inventory, which did not reveal any\nmajor mental health problems. A tool to measure intelligence\nshowed that Thieszen had an average to above-average IQ.\nBased on a violence risk assessment, Newring placed Thieszen\n\f                              - 120 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   300 Nebraska R eports\n                        STATE v. THIESZEN\n                        Cite as 300 Neb. 112\n\nat a low risk for future acts of violence. A violence risk assess-\nment tool showed that Thieszen \u201chad some protective factors\npresent, which is predictive of a favorable response to com-\nmunity transition.\u201d Those factors were intelligence, empathy,\ncoping skills, and self-control.\n   Newring\u2019s diagnostic impressions were adjustment disor-\nder with anxiety and antisocial personality disorder. Newring\nexplained that Thieszen met the criteria for a diagnosis of anti-\nsocial personality disorder but cautioned that Thieszen had not\nshown any of that criteria in the last decade.\n   Newring did not administer any sex offender assessment\ntools because Thieszen, from the age of 18, had no sex-\nrelated misconduct reports or charges. According to Newring,\nThieszen reported engaging in physical intimacies with female\nstaff members over the course of his incarceration. Newring\ntestified that those relationships would be potentially unhealthy\nif they were still occurring, but that Thieszen described them\nas \u201chistorical.\u201d\n   In 2014, Newring administered a self-report measure to\nassess the likelihood of substance abuse dependence. Based on\nthe testing, Newring had concerns that Thieszen would meet\ncriteria for cannabis use disorder.\n   Newring testified that Thieszen expressed remorse, regret,\nand sorrow for his crime. According to Newring, Thieszen\n\u201cwas likely in a very emotionally aroused situation and not\nable to do rational, cognitive thinking that we would expect to\nsee in a cold logic situation.\u201d Newring explained that an emo-\ntionally aroused 14-year-old is different from a coldly logical\n14-year-old and that a 14-year-old is much different from an\n18-year-old. Newring asked Thieszen what, if anything, would\nhe change, and Thieszen answered that he would have told the\njudge he did not want to be adopted by Edwin and Joyce.\n   A corrections officer at the prison who sees Thieszen on\nnearly a daily basis testified that Thieszen was \u201c[p]robably\u201d a\ngood inmate. According to the officer, Thieszen did not cause\ntrouble and was respectful to corrections officers and other\n\f                                     - 121 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        300 Nebraska R eports\n                               STATE v.

The officer further testified that Thieszen \u201cjust always\ndoes everything he\u2019s supposed to do\u201d and that \u201c[i]f you tell him\nto do something, he does it.\u201d According to the officer, Thieszen\nknits, crochets, exercises, and paints. He testified that Thieszen\nhas many visitors. Five individuals wrote letters in strong sup-\nport of Thieszen. A few of those individuals attached pictures\nof Thieszen\u2019s artwork and craftwork.\n                        (c) Resentencing\n   At the time of resentencing, Thieszen was 44 years old and\nhad been incarcerated since 1987. Before imposing a sentence,\nthe court addressed the factors set forth in Neb. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7 28-105.02(2) (Reissue 2016). The court sentenced Thieszen\nto 70 years\u2019 to life imprisonment for first degree murder, to be\nserved consecutively to the sentence he was currently serving\nof 80 to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment for the firearm conviction.\n   Thieszen filed a timely appeal.\n               III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Thieszen assigns, reordered, that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in (1) failing to strike certain letters from the pre-\nsentence report, (2) allowing improper victim impact testimony\nat the sentencing hearing, (3) imposing an excessive sentence,\n(4) imposing a de facto sentence of life imprisonment without\nparole in the absence of a finding of irreparable corruption, and\n(5) imposing a disproportionate sentence upon him.\n                  IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1,2] An appellate court will not disturb a sentence imposed\nwithin the statutory limits absent an abuse of discretion by the\ntrial court.7 A judicial abuse of discretion exists when the rea\u00ad\nsons or rulings of a trial judge are clearly untenable, unfairly\ndepriving a litigant of a substantial right and denying just\nresults in matters submitted for disposition.8\n\n\u20027\t\n      State v.

Letters in Presentence R eport\n   During the resentencing hearing, Thieszen\u2019s counsel asked\nthat a number of letters in the presentence report be stricken.\nHe did not believe it was appropriate for the court to receive\nletters from anonymous sources, and the court responded that\nit would not consider anonymous letters. Thieszen\u2019s counsel\nalso requested that the court not consider specific informa-\ntion in letters that was baseless or inflammatory. The court\nstated that it would give such a letter \u201cthe weight and cred-\nibility that it\u2019s due and disregard any portions not supported\nby the record.\u201d\n   On appeal, Thieszen argues that the court abused its dis-\ncretion by overruling his objections to letters which were\nsubmitted by anonymous sources, which contained baseless\ninformation, or which were intended to intimidate the judge\nand encourage the imposition of an inappropriate sentence. We\ndisagree for two main reasons.\n   First, to some extent, the court granted the relief Thieszen\nrequested. The court stated that it would not consider unsigned\nletters. The presentence report shows that the court struck a\nnumber of letters. With regard to letters to which Thieszen\nobjected but which the court did not strike, the court stated that\nit would give each letter the weight and credibility it was due\nand that it would disregard portions that were not supported by\nthe record.\n   [3] Second, a sentencing court has broad discretion as to the\nsource and type of evidence and information which may be\nused in determining the kind and extent of the punishment to\nbe imposed, and evidence may be presented as to any matter\nthat the court deems relevant to the sentence.9 We cannot say\nthat the court abused its broad discretion in declining to strike\nall of the letters to which Thieszen objected.\n\n\u20029\t\n      State v.

THIESZEN\n                              Cite as 300 Neb. 112\n\n                   2. Victim Impact Testimony\n   The State informed the court that one of Thieszen\u2019s sis-\nters wished to read a letter to the court under Neb. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7 81-1848 (Cum. Supp. 2016). Thieszen\u2019s counsel objected on\nthe basis that the sister is not a \u201cvictim\u201d under the statute. But\nthe court stated that it would \u201cgive her an opportunity to read\nher letter as an immediate family member.\u201d\n   A statute sets forth rights for victims of crimes.10 Such a\nvictim has the right to submit a written impact statement at sen-\ntencing or to read his or her impact statement at sentencing.11\nBut the statute gives such rights to \u201cvictims\u201d as defined by\nNeb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 29-119 (Reissue 2016). Under \u00a7 29-119(2)(b),\na victim in the case of a homicide is \u201cthe nearest surviving\nrelative under the law as provided by section 30-2303 but does\nnot include the alleged perpetrator of the homicide.\u201d\n   Thieszen contends that the court abused its discretion\nin allowing improper victim impact testimony. Because\nThieszen\u2019s parents are alive, Thieszen contends that they, but\nnot his sister, had the right to read their impact statements\nat sentencing.\n   We rejected a similar challenge in State v. Galindo.12 In that\ncase, the defendant objected to victim impact statements on\nthe ground that not all of the family representatives qualified\nas a \u201cnearest surviving relative\u201d under \u00a7 29-119. The sentenc-\ning court overruled the objection, and we found no error. We\nstated: \u201cThe definition of \u2018victim\u2019 upon which [the defend\u00ad\nant] relies merely provides for a baseline right, under the\n[Nebraska Crime Victim\u2019s Reparations Act], to give a victim\nimpact statement. The [act] does not seek to limit the sentenc-\ning court\u2019s traditional discretion to consider evidence from\na variety of sources.\u201d13 Because we continue to believe this\n\n10\t\n      See \u00a7 81-1848.\n11\t\n      See \u00a7 81-1848(1)(d)(vii).\n12\t\n      State v.

THIESZEN\n                              Cite as 300 Neb. 112\n\nreasoning is sound, we decline Thieszen\u2019s invitation to over-\nrule that aspect of Galindo.\n   The court did not abuse its discretion in allowing an oral\nstatement from Thieszen\u2019s sister. The State advised the court\nthat the victims as defined in \u00a7 29-119\u2014i.e., Edwin and\nJoyce\u2014\u201care elderly, they live out of state and for various rea-\nsons don\u2019t want to participate in the process.\u201d It was not unten-\nable for the court to allow the victims\u2019 daughter to be heard\ninstead. This assignment of error lacks merit.\n                  3. Excessiveness of Sentence\n   Thieszen\u2019s primary complaint on appeal is that his sentence\nis excessive for various reasons. The court imposed a sen-\ntence of 70 years\u2019 to life imprisonment. The sentence is within\nthe statutory limits of 40 years\u2019 to life imprisonment.14 But\nThieszen contends that the court abused its discretion in impos-\ning the sentence.\n   Thieszen begins by comparing his sentence to that imposed\nin State v. Jackson.15 In that case, the victim died of multiple\ngunshot wounds. The State filed identical informations against\nthe defendant and two others, charging each with first degree\nmurder and use of a deadly weapon during the commission of\na felony. At the time of the murder, the defendant was nearly\n18 years old. A jury found the defendant guilty of murder but\nnot guilty of the weapon charge, and the court imposed a sen-\ntence of life imprisonment. Because the defendant was under\n18 years old at the time of the murder, he was later resen-\ntenced to 60 to 80 years\u2019 imprisonment. Thieszen points out\nthat he was younger than the defendant in Jackson, but that the\ndefend\u00adant in Jackson received a lesser sentence.\n   [4] The lesser sentence imposed in Jackson does not per-\nsuade us that Thieszen\u2019s sentence constitutes an abuse of discre-\ntion. Significantly, there were questions about the defendant\u2019s\n\n14\t\n      See \u00a7 28-105.02(1).\n15\t\n      State v. Jackson, 297 Neb. 22, 899 N.W.2d 215 (2017).\n\f                                     - 125 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        300 Nebraska R eports\n                               STATE v. THIESZEN\n                               Cite as 300 Neb. 112\n\nlevel of participation in Jackson. Here, there is no dispute that\nThieszen murdered Sacha. But more importantly, we do not\n\u201c\u2018color match\u2019\u201d sentences.16 It would be virtually impossible\nto find two murder cases which are the same in all respects.17\nThe appropriateness of a sentence is necessarily a subjective\njudgment and includes the sentencing judge\u2019s observation of\nthe defendant\u2019s demeanor and attitude and all the facts and cir-\ncumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s life.18 The fact that a\ndifferent offender with a different background received a lesser\nsentence for a crime committed under different circumstances\ndoes not mean that Thieszen\u2019s sentence was excessive.\n   [5-7] Where a sentence imposed within the statutory limits\nis alleged on appeal to be excessive, the appellate court must\ndetermine whether the sentencing court abused its discretion\nin considering and applying the relevant factors as well as any\napplicable legal principles in determining the sentence to be\nimposed.19 In determining a sentence to be imposed, relevant\nfactors customarily considered and applied are the defendant\u2019s\n(1) age, (2) mentality, (3) education and experience, (4) social\nand cultural background, (5) past criminal record or record\nof law-abiding conduct, and (6) moti\u00ad   vation for the offense,\nas well as (7) the nature of the offense and (8) the amount of\nviolence involved in the commission of the crime.20 Because\nThieszen was under the age of 18 when he committed a\nClass IA felony, \u00a7 28-105.02 dictates that the sentencing judge\nmust also consider mitigating factors, such as the defendant\u2019s\n(1) age at the time of the offense, (2) impetuos\u00adity, (3) family\nand community environment, and (4) ability to appreciate risks\nand consequences of the conduct, as well as (5) the outcome\n\n16\t\n      See State v.

It recognized that Thieszen was 14 years old at the time\nof the offense and that at the time of resentencing, he was\ndivorced and had employment through \u201cprison industries.\u201d In\nconsidering factors under \u00a7 28-105.02(2), the court acknowl-\nedged that evaluations showed Thieszen was impetuous and\nimmature at the time of the offense. However, the court noted\nthat Thieszen purchased shells prior to the crime and that\nbecause his gun had been taken away from him, there \u201cwas no\nvalid reason for [him] to purchase or possess shells except to\ncarry out previous threats to [his] family.\u201d The court observed\nthat Thieszen\u2019s natural mother was abusive and that he was\nraised in an abusive environment until age 4. The court stated\nthat Edwin and Joyce raised Thieszen in a structured environ-\nment, that they disciplined Thieszen to correct his behavior, but\nthat Thieszen did not modify his behavior after being caught\ndoing something wrong. The court noted that Thieszen had\nabove-average intellectual capacity. It recognized that Thieszen\nhad never been hospitalized for any mental health reason and\nthat Newring indicated Thieszen was well adjusted. We can-\nnot say that the court abused its discretion in its assessment of\nthe factors.\n   We are cognizant of factors militating against Thieszen\u2019s\nculpability for the crime. According to Pope, Thieszen\u2019s trau-\nmatic early childhood likely influenced his emotional and\ncognitive development. There was evidence that Thieszen was\nstruggling mentally and emotionally prior to the murder and\nthat the only treatment provided was occasional therapy ses-\nsions. According to Pope, \u201cthese factors would have interfered\nwith [Thieszen\u2019s] ability to make rational decisions, appro-\npriately consider risks and consequences, and to regulate his\n\n21\t\n      See id.\n\f                                      - 127 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        300 Nebraska R eports\n                               STATE v. THIESZEN\n                               Cite as 300 Neb. 112\n\nbehavior and impulses above and beyond the limitations that\nare associated with adolescence.\u201d Pope observed that over\ntime, Thieszen had taken on the roles of teacher and advi-\nsor to other inmates and to the social network he had formed\noutside of prison. These factors support the imposition of a\nminimum sentence that is less than life imprisonment. The\ncourt, by setting the minimum sentence at 70 years, imposed\nsuch a sentence.\n   Thieszen also claims that his sentence amounted to a de\nfacto life sentence and that such a sentence was disproportion-\nate to the offense. According to Thieszen, his sentence of 70\nyears\u2019 to life imprisonment means he will not be parole eligible\nuntil age 53 and, if paroled, he will be on parole for the rest of\nhis life. But the sentence provides Thieszen with a \u201cmeaningful\nand realistic opportunity to obtain release.\u201d22 We have rejected\nsimilar claims that a lengthy term-of-years sentence was a de\nfacto sentence of life imprisonment,23 and we see no reason to\nrevisit that conclusion here.\n                       VI. CONCLUSION\n   We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discre-\ntion in overruling Thieszen\u2019s objections to letters in the pre-\nsentence report, in allowing Thieszen\u2019s sister to read her vic-\ntim impact statement at the sentencing hearing, or in imposing\nthe sentence. We therefore affirm Thieszen\u2019s murder sentence\nof 70 years\u2019 to life imprisonment.\n                                                    A ffirmed.\n\n22\t\n      State v.
