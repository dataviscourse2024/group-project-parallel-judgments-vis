Martinez, Justice\n                  Patricia O. Alvarez, Justice\n                  Irene Rios, Justice\n\nDelivered and Filed: March 13, 2019\n\nPETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION\n\n           On October 16, 2013, this court issued an opinion affirming relator\u2019s conviction of\n\nmanslaughter, and our mandate issued on February 5, 2014. On December 10, 2018, relator filed\n\na pro se \u201cBrief/Outline\u201d of his case in which he asserted an issue he believed his appellate counsel\n\nshould have raised in the original appeal. On December 18, 2018, this court notified relator that\n\nbecause our mandate had issued we no longer had jurisdiction to consider his claim. We informed\n\nrelator that a copy of his claim had been forwarded to the trial court.\n\n           On February 22, 2019, relator filed his pro se petition for writ of mandamus. In his petition,\n\nrelator asserts the trial court has not ruled on his \u201cBrief/Outline.\u201d However, relator also contends\n\n\n\n\n1\n This proceeding arises out of Cause No. 2010CR10629, styled The State of Texas v. Stephen Wayne Richardson,\npending in the 399th Judicial District Court, Bexar County, Texas, the Honorable Juanita A. Vasquez-Gardner\npresiding.\n\f                                                                                         04-19-00095-CR\n\n\nhe is entitled to the relief he seeks in his \u201cBrief/Outline.\u201d In his prayer for relief, relator asks this\n\ncourt to exonerate him and release him from custody.\n\n        We do not have jurisdiction to exonerate relator. The substance of the relief sought by\n\nrelator in his petition is habeas corpus relief following a final felony conviction. Texas Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure article 11.07 provides the exclusive means to challenge a final felony\n\nconviction. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 11.07 \u00a7 5; Board of Pardons & Paroles ex rel. Keene v.\n\nCourt of Appeals for Eighth Dist., 910 S.W.2d 481, 483 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (orig. proceeding)\n\n(per curiam). Jurisdiction to grant post-conviction habeas corpus relief on a final felony conviction\n\nrests exclusively with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 11.07\n\n\u00a7 3(a); Keene, 910 S.W.2d at 483. Because the relief sought in relator\u2019s petition relates to post-\n\nconviction relief from an otherwise final felony conviction, we are without jurisdiction to consider\n\nhis petition for writ of mandamus. Therefore, we dismiss relator\u2019s petition for writ of mandamus\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction.\n\n                                                    PER CURIAM\n\nDo not publish\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -2-\n\f",
