Kelley, Judge; L.T. Case No. 50-\n2016-CF-001434-AXXX-MB.\n\n  Carey Haughwout, Public Defender, and Benjamin Eisenberg, Assistant\nPublic Defender, West Palm Beach, for appellant.\n\n   Ashley Moody, Attorney General, Tallahassee, and Rachael Kaiman,\nAssistant Attorney General, West Palm Beach, for appellee.\n\nCONNER, J.\n\n   Lex Lugard Eugene (\u201cAppellant\u201d) appeals his judgments and sentences\nentered after a jury found him guilty of vehicular homicide; fleeing or\nattempting to elude an officer causing serious bodily injury or death;\noperating a motor vehicle carelessly or negligently causing death or serious\ninjury without having a driver\u2019s license; and resisting an officer without\nviolence. The state cross-appeals the trial court\u2019s order dismissing the\ncount charging fleeing or attempting to elude an officer causing serious\nbodily injury or death, based on the single homicide rule.\n\n    Appellant argues that the trial court erred in prohibiting evidence of the\narresting police agency\u2019s policy against high-speed vehicle pursuits and\nevidence of an internal investigation of the officer involved in the high-\nspeed chase leading to Appellant\u2019s arrest. We affirm the trial court\u2019s\nrulings on those evidentiary issues without discussion. We also affirm the\ntrial court\u2019s dismissal of the count charging Appellant with fleeing or\nattempting to elude an officer causing serious bodily injury or death and\nexplain our reasoning.\n\f                                Background\n\n   While waiting to turn onto the same road Appellant was travelling, a\npolice officer in uniform driving a marked police vehicle noticed that\nAppellant was speeding. The officer ran the license plate and saw that the\ntag was expired, but was unable to effectuate a traffic stop at the time.\nHowever, ten minutes later, he saw Appellant\u2019s vehicle in a convenience\nstore parking lot. As the officer pulled into the parking lot, Appellant\u2019s\nvehicle \u201ctook off.\u201d Appellant increased his speed as he was pursued,\ncausing the officer to drive sixty miles an hour in order to catch up to him.\n\n   When the officer activated his overhead lights, Appellant\u2019s vehicle again\naccelerated and then crossed over double lines into oncoming traffic to\npass another vehicle. At that point, the officer activated his sirens. After\nAppellant\u2019s vehicle successfully passed the other vehicle, Appellant\nattempted to make an abrupt right-hand turn down a side street and lost\ncontrol of his vehicle. Appellant\u2019s vehicle left the roadway, crossed a\ncurbed sidewalk, smashed through a chain-link fence, and came to a stop\nin a dirt field. Appellant then exited the vehicle and attempted to climb\nover another chain-link fence, but when he was unable to do so, he began\nrunning through the field. The pursuing officer was unable to make the\nabrupt turn to chase Appellant\u2019s vehicle, but backup officers arrived and\nwere able to apprehend Appellant.\n\n   In the course of driving off the roadway and into the field, Appellant ran\nover and killed a five-year-old child.\n\n   A jury found Appellant guilty of vehicular homicide; fleeing or\nattempting to elude an officer causing serious bodily injury or death;\noperating a motor vehicle carelessly or negligently causing death or serious\ninjury without having a driver\u2019s license; and resisting an officer without\nviolence. At sentencing, the trial court dismissed the fleeing or attempting\nto elude an officer causing serious bodily injury or death count, based on\nthe single homicide rule. The state stipulated to dismissal of the count\ncharging operating a motor vehicle carelessly or negligently causing death\nor serious injury without having a driver\u2019s license, also pursuant to the\nsingle homicide rule. After Appellant was sentenced to prison, he gave\nnotice of appeal.\n\n                            Appellate Analysis\n\n   At sentencing, the trial court first addressed as a \u201cdouble jeopardy\u201d\nissue raised by Appellant whether dual convictions for vehicular homicide\n\n                                     2\n\fand fleeing or attempting to elude an officer causing serious bodily injury\nor death violated the single homicide rule. Appellant relied on McCullough\nv. State, 230 So. 3d 586 (Fla. 2d DCA 2017), where the Second District\nfound that the defendant\u2019s convictions for vehicular homicide and fleeing\nor attempting to elude an officer causing serious bodily injury or death\nviolated the single homicide rule. Id. at 593. The state relied on McKinney\nv. State, 51 So. 3d 645 (Fla. 1st DCA 2011), and argued that fleeing or\nattempting to elude an officer causing serious bodily injury or death is a\nnon-homicide offense, and therefore, it could not be a crime that violated\nthe single homicide rule. The trial court commented that guidance from\nthis Court was needed, but relied on McCullough in dismissing the count,\nsince it was the more recent case. The trial court\u2019s verbal dismissal of the\nfleeing or attempting to elude count was followed by a written order citing\nto McCullough.\n\n  \u201cA double jeopardy claim based upon undisputed facts presents a pure\nquestion of law, which we review de novo.\u201d McCullough, 230 So. 3d at 590.\n\n    In McCullough, the defendant stole a car which precipitated a high-\nspeed police chase, during which she struck and killed a bicyclist. Id. at\n589. On appeal, she challenged the trial court\u2019s ability to sentence her on\nvehicular homicide and fleeing or attempting to elude an officer causing\nserious bodily injury or death, contending that sentencing her on both\ncounts violated her double jeopardy protections and the single homicide\nrule, since there was only one death. Id. The Second District described\nthe \u201csingle homicide rule\u201d as \u201ca judicially created extension of the\nconstitutional and statutory double jeopardy bar.\u201d Id. After an extensive\nexamination of the case law surrounding the development of the rule and\ndouble jeopardy analysis in Florida, the Second District held that the\ndefendant\u2019s conviction for fleeing or attempting to elude an officer causing\nserious bodily injury or death in addition to vehicular homicide violated\nthe single homicide rule, resulting in double jeopardy. Id. at 593. The\nSecond District remanded the case for the trial court to vacate the lesser\nfelony offense of vehicular homicide, leaving the fleeing or attempting to\nelude conviction undisturbed. Id. at 595-96. In so holding, the Second\nDistrict relied principally on our supreme court\u2019s opinions in State v.\nCooper, 634 So. 2d 1074, 1074-75 (Fla. 1994), and Houser v. State, 474\nSo. 2d 1193, 1197 (Fla. 1985). Houser and Cooper are considered the\nprimary case law sources for the single homicide rule.\n\n    In McCullough, the Second District also certified conflict with McKinney,\nthe case the state relied upon at Appellant\u2019s sentencing. In McKinney, the\ndefendant argued that his convictions for third-degree murder (using the\nfleeing offense as the underlying felony to support third-degree murder)\n\n                                     3\n\fand fleeing or attempting to elude an officer causing serious bodily injury\nor death violated the single homicide rule. 51 So. 3d at 646. The First\nDistrict disagreed, finding that because fleeing or attempting to elude an\nofficer causing serious bodily injury or death could be satisfied by causing\neither death or serious bodily injury, the fleeing offense was \u201cnot a\nhomicide offense.\u201d Id. at 648. Because the fleeing offense did not\nnecessarily require death, the First District concluded the single homicide\nrule did not apply to the defendant\u2019s case. Id. The court reasoned that\nbecause the fleeing offense could be committed in situations where the\nfleeing causes serious bodily injury, that inclusion \u201cdistinguishe[d] fleeing\nor eluding from DWI manslaughter, which the supreme court held in\nHouser to be a homicide offense rather than an enhancement to the\npenalty for DWI because death was an element of the offense.\u201d Id.\n\n    Significantly, the McCullough decision noted that the case law on the\nissue in the First District was seemingly conflicting. 230 So. 3d at 595.\nIn 2016, after McKinney was issued, the First District decided Crusaw v.\nState, 195 So. 3d 422 (Fla. 1st DCA 2016), in which it held that dual\nconvictions for vehicular homicide and careless driving with a suspended\nlicense resulting in death or serious bodily injury violated double jeopardy,\nciting the supreme court Cooper decision as controlling. Id. at 422-23.\nAlthough the Crusaw decision did not mention the single homicide rule,\nits reliance on Cooper makes clear that the rule was applied. Notably,\nCrusaw made no mention of McKinney.\n\n   Further demonstrating the intradistrict conflict is the First District\u2019s\ndecision in Daniel v. State, 271 So. 3d 1214 (Fla. 1st DCA 2019). In Daniel,\nthe First District itself noted the conflict between McKinney and Crusaw,\nand determined that Crusaw was the controlling law in the district,\nbecause it was the later decision in time. Id. at 1215 n.3. Important to\nthis appeal, the defendant in Daniel was sentenced on vehicular homicide\nand fleeing or attempting to elude an officer causing serious bodily injury\nor death, where there was only one death. Id. at 1214. The First District\nvacated the fleeing or eluding an officer causing serious bodily injury or\ndeath conviction and remanded the case for entry of a judgment on the\nlesser included offense of fleeing or attempting to elude and resentencing.\nId. at 1215-16. The First District cited Cooper, Houser, Crusaw, and\nMcCullough as authority for its decision. Id. at 1215. Thus, it appears\nMcKinney is no longer good law in the First District.\n\n    Although we have never directly addressed the issue of whether dual\nconvictions for vehicular homicide and fleeing or attempting to elude an\nofficer causing serious bodily injury or death violates the single homicide\nrule when there is only one death, we have applied the single homicide\n\n                                     4\n\frule in cases where a defendant was charged with second degree murder\nand driving while license suspended causing death, and where a defendant\nwas charged with vehicular homicide and driving while license suspended\ninvolving death. See Thomas v. State, 837 So. 2d 443, 447 (Fla. 4th DCA\n2002); Pierce v. State, 718 So. 2d 806, 810 (Fla. 4th DCA 1997). We\nperceive no reason to treat cases charging vehicular homicide and driving\nwith suspended license resulting in death offenses together differently\nfrom cases charging vehicular homicide and fleeing or attempting to elude\nan officer causing serious bodily injury or death offenses together.\n\n   We note that the issue of whether dual convictions for vehicular\nhomicide and fleeing or attempting to elude an officer causing serious\nbodily injury or death violate the single homicide rule is currently before\nour supreme court on a certified question of great public importance. See\nState v. Maisonet-Maldonado, No. SC19-1947, 2019 WL 6693244 (Fla. Dec.\n9, 2019). Until the supreme court clarifies the law, we align ourselves with\nthe First, Second, and Fifth Districts and hold that dual convictions for\nvehicular homicide and fleeing or attempting to elude an officer causing\nserious bodily injury or death violate the single homicide rule when\ncommitted in the same criminal episode causing one death.\n\n   Affirmed.\n\nFORST, J., and GILLESPIE, KENNETH, Associate Judge, concur.\n\n                           *         *         *\n\n   Not final until disposition of timely filed motion for rehearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                     5\n\f",
