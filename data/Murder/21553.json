We conclude that NRS 433A.310(5)'s plain\n                 language requires a district court to transmit an admission order at the\n                 time it is entered. Thus, although the petitioner in the underlying\n                 proceedings was unconditionally released 12 days after the district court's\n                 involuntary admission order, the district court was required under NRS\n                 433A.310(5) to transmit the order to the Central Repository. And because\n                 the district court reasonably determined that clear and convincing\n\nSUPREME COURT\n        OF\n     NEVADA\n                                                        2\n(0) 1947A    e\n\f                evidence justified petitioner's involuntary admission, we deny petitioner's\n                request for extraordinary writ relief\n                                                  FACTS\n                            The Sparks Police Department responded to a call from\n                petitioner Phong Vu's family in which the family requested assistance\n                with Vu. According to the police report, Vu had threatened to murder his\n                family, he was found with box cutters in his pocket, and he was muttering\n                about murder while the police were present. The responding officers\n                applied for the temporary emergency admission of Vu to a mental health\n                facility, which was approved by a physician. Three days later, a\n                psychiatrist filed a petition for court-ordered continued involuntary\n                admission of Vu to a mental health facility. Based on her examination of\n                Vu, the psychiatrist concluded that he had a mental illness and, as a\n                result of that mental illness, there was an imminent risk that Vu was\n                likely to harm himself or others if Vu were not involuntary admitted to a\n                mental health facility.\n                            Vu was appointed a public defender, and a hearing on the\n                petition was held before the district court. At the hearing, the Washoe\n                County District Attorney's Office, representing the State, called as\n                witnesses a court-appointed psychiatrist and a court-appointed\n                psychologist, both of whom had interviewed Vu. The District Attorney\n                elicited testimony from the psychiatrist that Vu's family had called the\n                police due to their concerns that Vu posed a threat to their safety. The\n                psychiatrist also testified regarding an incident in which Vu, after having\n                been admitted to a facility on an emergency basis, had approached a\n                doctor in a manner that the doctor perceived as threatening, thereby\n                prompting the doctor to seek intervention from other employees. The\n                psychiatrist further testified that Vu was refusing to take an antipsychotic\nSUPREME COURT\n     OF\n   NEVADA\n                                                        3\n(l) 1947A \u2022\n\f                 medication that had been prescribed to him. Summing up her opinion, the\n                 psychiatrist explained that although Vu had not committed any act in\n                 furtherance of a threat during the incidents with his family and the\n                 doctor,\n                             I believe that the perceptions that people have\n                             that he is threatening to them, as well as his\n                             inability to communicate in an organized fashion,\n                             put him at risk for his own safety and well-being\n                             that if somebody feels threatened by him, they\n                             may respond in a way that affects his well-being\n                             [because] they may feel as though they need to\n                             defend themselves against the threat, and they\n                             may not have a mental health tech or the Sparks\n                             Police Department [to intervene].\n                 The District Attorney elicited similar testimony from the court-appointed\n                 psychologist, who summed up his opinion by stating, \"I can't predict that\n                 anybody would assault [Vu], but I feel there's certainly a risk of that.\"\n                             At the end of the hearing, the district court made the following\n                 findings:\n                             [I] can glean that there exists a reasonable\n                             probability that a serious bodily injury will occur if\n                             he's discharged soon because of the fact that that's\n                             how people have reacted to him in recent days.\n                             There's nothing to suggest that his behavior has\n                             been modified. . . . I find that within the last 30\n                             days he's. . . had auditory hallucinations\n                             and ... some of those are paranoid. He's carried\n                             weapons. It may reasonably be inferred from\n                             these acts that without the care, supervision and\n                             continued assistance of others, that he will be\n                             unable to satisfy his personal needs for self-\n                             protection and safety. . . unless admitted to a\n                             mental health facility and adequate treatment is\n                             provided.\n\n\nSUPREME COURT\n        OF\n     NEVADA\n                                                       4\n(01 1947A    e\n\f                Over defense counsel's objection, the district court directed the clerk of the\n                court to forward a record of the involuntary admission order to the Central\n                Repository for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background\n                Check System (NICS).\"\n                            Twelve days after thefl district court's admission order was\n                entered, Vu was unconditionally released from the mental health facility\n                based on the determination of a team of evaluators that Vu no longer\n                presented a clear and present danger of harm to himself or others.         See\n                NRS 433A.390(2). Thereafter, Vu filed this petition for a writ of\n                mandamus, asking that this court direct the district court to recall from\n                the Central Repository the previously transmitted record of Vu's\n                involuntary admission. As a basis for the requested relief, Vu contends\n                that (1) NRS 433A.310(5) did not authorize transmission of the\n                involuntary admission order unless and until that order became final\n                under NRS 433A.310(1); and (2) regardless, the district court's underlying\n                determination that Vu should have been involuntarily admitted was not\n                supported by sufficient evidence.\n                                               DISCUSSION\n                            \"A writ of mandamus is available to compel the performance of\n                an act that the law requires as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or\n\n                       'Records transmitted to the Central Repository are \"included in each\n                appropriate database of [NICS].\" NRS 179A.163(1).

See In re Candidacy of\n                  Hansen, 118 Nev. 570, 572, 52 P.3d 938, 940 (2002) (\"It is axiomatic that\n                  when words of a statute are plain and unambiguous, they will be given\n                  their plain meaning.\"). Subsection 5 plainly states that \"Ulf the court\n                  issues an order. . . , the court shall. . . cause. . . a record of such order to\n                  be transmitted to the Central Repository.\" NRS 433A.310(5) (emphases\n                  added). Nothing in this language contemplates that a district court must\n                  wait 30 days to see whether its order becomes final under subsection 1(b)\n                  before a record of the order can be transmitted to the Central Repository,\n                  and we decline to read a requirement into subsection 5 that the\n                  Legislature itself has not imposed. 2 See Barrett v. Eighth Judicial Dist.\n\n\n\n                        2Our construction of subsection 5 is reinforced by the fact that the\n                  Legislature enacted subsection 5 long after it enacted the final sentence of\n                  subsection 1(b), see 2009 Nev.

The fact that Vu was unconditionally released after 12 days did\n                not imply that the district court's involuntary admission findings were\n                erroneous when that order was entered; Vu's release simply demonstrated\n                that he was \"no longer considered to present a clear and present danger of\n                harm to himself. . . or others.\" NRS 433A.390(2)(a) (emphasis added).\n                More importantly, we are unwilling to consider a construction of\n                subsection 5 that might undermine the Legislature's attempt to comply\n                with federal law, as subsection 5 was enacted in response to congressional\n                legislation that incentivized states to cooperate in making NICS operate\n                more efficiently and comprehensively.

As explained, NRS\n                 433A.310(1)(b) permits a district court to order the involuntary admission\n                 of a person to a mental health facility if \"there is clear and convincing\n                 evidence that the person with respect to whom the hearing was held has a\n                 mental illness and, because of that illness, is likely to harm himself or\n                 herself or others if allowed his or her liberty.\" Because an involuntary\n                 admission order constitutes a deprivation of the admitted person's\n                 constitutionally protected liberty interest, NRS 433A.310(1)(b)'s \"clear and\n                 convincing\" evidentiary standard is meant to ensure that the district court\n                 does not wrongfully deprive a person of that liberty interest.             See\n                 Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425-26 (1979). When a district court's\n                 factual determinations must be supported by clear and convincing\n                 evidence, \"we review the record and decision with a degree of deference,\n                 seeking only to determine whether the evidence adduced at the hearing\n                 was sufficient to have convinced the deciding body that [the issue to be\n                 determined] had been shown by clear and convincing evidence.\" Gilman v.\n                 Nev.

In other words, despite the heightened evidentiary standard\n                of proof that the district court in this case was required to employ, our\n                review is limited to whether the district court reasonably could have\n                determined that clear and convincing evidence showed that Vu was likely\n                to harm himself.

They also agree that NRS\n                433A.310(1)(b)'s \"likely to harm himself or herself or others\" standard\n                must be established by showing that Vu fell within one of four definitions\n                set forth in NRS 433A.115(2) and (3). 3 They further agree that the\n\n\n                      3 The interplay between NRS 433A.310(1)(b) and NRS 433A.115 is\n                not immediately apparent, particularly in light of NRS 433A.310(1)(b)'s\n                \"likely to harm\" standard and NRS 433A.115's \"clear and present danger\"\n                standard, discussed below. Nonetheless, it appears to have been the\n                Legislature's intention that a person must fall within one of the four\n                definitions set forth in NRS 433A.115(2) and (3) before that person may be\n                involuntarily admitted by court order under NRS 433A.310(1)(b).

Vu and the District Attorney disagree, however, as to\n                whether sufficient evidence supported the district court's conclusion that\n                Vu fell within this definition.\n                            Having considered the record generated at the involuntary\n                admission hearing, we agree with the District Attorney that the opinions\n                elicited from the court-appointed psychiatrist and psychologist reasonably\n                supported the district court's conclusion that Vu fell within MRS\n                433A.115(2)(a)'s definition. In particular, the uncontroverted evidence\n                demonstrated that in the 30 days preceding the hearing, Vu's family called\n                the police based on their concerns that he posed a physical threat to them.\n                Testimony was likewise elicited that Vu confronted a resident doctor at\n                the mental health facility in a manner that the resident doctor perceived\n\n\n                ...continued\n                interpretation of criteria that determine the potential dangerousness of a\n                mentally ill person for the purpose of involuntary admission\").\n\nSUPREME COURT\n        OF\n     NEVADA\n                                                      11\n(0) 1947A\n\f                as physically threatening. Both the psychiatrist and the psychologist\n                opined that, if Vu were to act in such a manner toward a person\n                unfamiliar with his mental illness, there would be a risk that the person\n                would act violently in self-defense. From this evidence, the district court\n                could \"reasonably [have] inferred that, without the care, supervision or\n                continued assistance of others, [Vu would] be unable to satisfy his . . . need\n                for. . self-protection or safety.\" NRS 433A.115(2)(a).\n                            From this same evidence, combined with the testimony that\n                Vu had refused to take his prescribed antipsychotic medication while\n                admitted on an emergency basis prior to the district court hearing, the\n                district court also could have reasonably concluded that \"there exist[ed] a\n                reasonable probability that [Vas . serious bodily injury. . . w[ould]\n                occur within the next following 30 days unless he . . [was] admitted to a\n                mental health facility.\" Id. While Vu argues that no evidence showed that\n                he had actually committed acts in furtherance of his threats or that\n                someone had actually assaulted him in self-defense or that such an assault\n                would actually rise to the level of inflicting serious bodily injury, this\n                argument stretches NRS 433A.115(2)(a)'s use of the phrases \"reasonably\n                be inferred\" and \"reasonable probability\" too far.

As a consequence, due process protections\n                apply. Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425 (1979). Chief among those\n                protections is a heightened burden of proof, meaning the State must prove\n                its case for involuntary commitment by \"greater than the preponderance-\n                of-the-evidence standard applicable to other categories of civil cases.\" Id.\n                at 432-33. The heightened standard of proof protects against an erroneous\n                deprivation of liberty. It recognizes the fundamental truth that, \"[alt one\n                time or another every person exhibits some abnormal behavior which\n                might be perceived by some as symptomatic of a mental or emotional\n                disorder, but which is in fact within a range of conduct that is generally\n                acceptable.\"     Id. at 426-27. \"Obviously, .. . a few isolated instances of\n                unusual conduct\" are not a basis\n                               for compelled treatment and surely none for\n                               confinement. . . . Loss of liberty calls for a showing\n                               that the individual suffers from something more\n                               serious than is demonstrated by idiosyncratic\n                               behavior. Increasing the burden of proof is one\n                               way to impress the factfinder with the importance\n                               of the decision and thereby perhaps to reduce the\n                               chances that inappropriate commitments will be\n                               ordered.\n                Id. at 427.\n                               The State called two witnesses at Vu's involuntary\n                commitment hearing, both doctors who had examined Vu and his mental\n                health records. These doctors concluded that Vu did not pose a threat of\n                harm to third parties, so his commitment could not be justified on that\n\n\nSUPREME COURT\n        OF\n     NEVADA\n\n\n(0) 1947A\n\f                statutory basis.    See NRS 433A.310(1)(b) (providing for involuntary\n                commitment if there is \"clear and convincing evidence that the\n                person. .. is likely to harm. . . others if allowed his or her liberty\"). The\n                State therefore proceeded on the theory that Vu presented a sufficient risk\n                of harm to himself, such that his commitment was justified on that\n                alternative statutory basis. See id. (providing for involuntary commitment\n                if there is \"clear and convincing evidence that the person. . . is likely to\n                harm himself or herself. . . if allowed his or her liberty\"). This alternative\n                theory required the State to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that\n                Vu could not meet his basic safety and self-protection needs without the\n                care, supervision, or continued assistance of others, and that there existed\n                a reasonable probability that Vu would face death, serious bodily injury, or\n                physical debilitation    in the following 30 days unless he was\n                institutionalized. NRS 433A.115(2)(A); see NRS 433A.310(1)(b).\n                            The uncontradicted evidence showed that Vu had a bank\n                account with money in it, an apartment in which to stay, and the ability to\n                feed and clothe himself. There was also no suggestion of suicidal ideation.\n                From this it would seem to follow that Vu did not need to be committed to\n                avoid death, serious bodily injury, or physical debilitation, but the State\n                maintained otherwise. According to the State, Vu needed to be committed\n                because, given his behavior and failure to take his medications, Vu might\n                act threateningly toward third parties, provoking them to attack and\n                injure him. Setting aside the tenuous nature of an opinion that members\n                of the general public would likely assault Vu if he acted threateningly\n                rather than seeking alternative help for themselves or Vu, In re Doe, 78\n                P.3d 341, 367 (Haw.

One instance was the reason for his\n                emergency hold, when his family felt threatened by his behavior, and the\n                other was during Vu's emergency intake where Vu\u2014who stands 5' 5\" tall\n                and weighs under 100 pounds\u2014reportedly \"broadened his shoulders\"\n                when facing a resident doctor. So there was actually no evidence that Vu\n                would act threateningly to people other than his family, who had already\n                shown the ability to call the police if his threatening behavior escalated, or\n                toward those at the facility holding him against his will. Also of note,\n                neither Vu's family nor the resident doctor testified at the hearing, and\n                the doctors who did testify indicated that Vu isolated himself from others,\n                not that he acted aggressively toward them.\n                            But more significantly, though the doctors generally opined\n                that a stranger might harm Vu if Vu were released, the only testimony\n                directed toward the seriousness of the harm Vu might face was Dr. Lewis's\n                answer of \"Yes\" to the following question posed by the district attorney:\n                            You indicated that Mr. [Vu] meets criteria for\n                            basic needs, self-protection and safety.
