Toro during an exchange of\n\ngunfire. Wilbert argued self-defense at his trial for Toro\u2019s murder. After a Camp County jury\n\nrejected his self-defense theory, Wilbert was convicted of murder, sentenced to ninety-nine years\u2019\n\nimprisonment, and ordered to pay a $10,000.00 fine. On appeal, Wilbert argues that the trial court\n\nerred (1) in allowing a forensic pathologist to testify about an autopsy she did not conduct, (2) in\n\nsustaining the State\u2019s hearsay objection to a Texas Ranger\u2019s testimony about a conversation with\n\na witness, (3) in allowing extraneous offenses to be admitted, and (4) in failing to instruct the jury\n\non the defense of property.\n\n       We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the forensic\n\npathologist\u2019s testimony and that Wilbert failed to preserve his remaining points of error for our\n\nreview. We also find that the trial court\u2019s judgment must be modified to show that Wilbert owes\n\nno attorney fees for his court-appointed counsel. As modified, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\nI.     The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Overruling Wilbert\u2019s Confrontation\n       Clause Objection\n\n       In his first point of error, Wilbert argues that the trial court erred in overruling his objection\n\nto testimony from Danielle Armstrong, a forensic pathologist who specialized in \u201cpost-mortem\n\nexaminations to establish a cause of death.\u201d \u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude\n\nevidence for an abuse of discretion.\u201d Flowers v. State, 438 S.W.3d 96, 103 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nTexarkana 2014, pet. ref\u2019d) (citing Martinez v. State, 327 S.W.3d 727, 736 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2010)). \u201cAbuse of discretion occurs only if the decision is \u2018so clearly wrong as to lie outside the\n\nzone within which reasonable people might disagree.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Taylor v. State, 268 S.W.3d\n\n                                                   2\n\f571, 579 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (citing Montgomery v. State, 810 S.W.2d 372, 391 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1990) (op. on reh\u2019g)). \u201cWe may not substitute our own decision for that of the trial court.\u201d\n\nId. (citing Moses v. State, 105 S.W.3d 622, 627 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003)). \u201cWe will uphold an\n\nevidentiary ruling if it was correct on any theory of law applicable to the case.\u201d Id. (citing\n\nDe La Paz v. State, 279 S.W.3d 336, 344 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009)).\n\n        At trial, Armstrong clarified that Toro\u2019s autopsy was performed by Dr. Robert Lyons, who\n\nbecame ill and left the practice. Although the State did not offer the autopsy report into evidence,\n\nthe autopsy photographs were admitted without objection. Armstrong testified that, based on her\n\nreview of the autopsy report and photographs, Toro\u2019s cause of death was \u201ca gunshot wound of the\n\nhead\u201d and manner of death was homicide. Armstrong explained to the jury that the photographs\n\nshowed evidence of an intermediate-range gunshot wound.\n\n        The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause provides that a defendant in a criminal\n\nprosecution \u201cshall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S.\n\nCONST. amend. VI. This right applies not only to in-court testimony, but also to out-of-court\n\nstatements that are testimonial in nature. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 50\u201351 (2004).\n\nWilbert argues that Armstrong\u2019s testimony violated the Confrontation Clause because it was based,\n\nin part, on an autopsy that she did not perform and a report she did not prepare. 1 We have\n\npreviously rejected the substance of Wilbert\u2019s argument.\n\n\n\n1\n The State argued that Wilbert failed to preserve his Confrontation Clause argument. We disagree. The record shows\nthat the following discussion occurred before Armstrong\u2019s testimony:\n\n                [BY THE STATE]: Just in case [defense counsel] hasn\u2019t noticed yet, the medical examiner\n        who is going to be testifying is not the one who performed the autopsy, so if you have any kind of\n                                                        3\n\f         \u201cAutopsy reports are testimonial where an objective medical examiner would reasonably\n\nbelieve that his report would be used in a later prosecution.\u201d Williams v. State, 513 S.W.3d 619,\n\n637 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2016, pet. ref\u2019d) (citing Lee v. State, 418 S.W.3d 892, 896 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet. ref\u2019d); Wood v. State, 299 S.W.3d 200, 209\u201310 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Austin 2009, pet. ref\u2019d)). Here, the autopsy report was never admitted, and \u201cphotographs\n\nare nontestimonial in nature for the purposes of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d Moore v. State, 553\n\n\n\n\n         argument or anything. I wanted to point that out in case you wanted to make some kind of argument\n         or something.\n\n                  [BY THE DEFENSE]: Well, I would argue that if you\u2019re going to put up a report, I want\n         the party that did it.\n\n                  [BY THE STATE]: Well, I\u2019m not offering the report. The case law is pretty clear that\n         somebody else can make their own opinion based on, you know, the autopsy report, pictures,\n         medical records, whatever, and they can have their own opinion. If I go so far as to offer the report\n         by somebody else, the report is obviously testimonial.\n\n                  THE COURT: He\u2019s got a right to cross[-] examine the author of the report.\n\n                 [BY THE STATE]: But the other medical examiner can testify as to her own opinions\n         based on whatever she reviews.\n\n                   [BY THE DEFENSE]: She didn\u2019t do it, and there\u2019s a difference. . . . Your Honor, I have\n         an objection to any testimony that\u2019s about to be given simply because that information that\u2019s in there\n         is not the medical examiner that actually processed the body.\n\n                  THE COURT: Overrule the objection, and the exhibit is received.\n\nAccording to the State, \u201cWilbert\u2019s objection could be interpreted in any number of ways. It could be a hearsay\nobjection. It could be an objection that the testifying medical examiner did not have personal knowledge of the\nautopsy.\u201d For this reason, the State argues that a Confrontation Clause objection is not preserved. However, if it is\napparent from the record that the trial court understood the objection and its grounds, error is preserved. See Dixon v.\nState, 928 S.W.2d 564, 564\u201365 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (per curiam); Kelly v. State, 529 S.W.3d 504, 513 n.6 (Tex.\nApp.\u2014Texarkana 2017, no pet.); Taylor v. State, 93 S.W.3d 487, 504 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2002, pet. ref\u2019d).\nBecause the trial court stated, \u201cHe\u2019s got a right to cross[-]examine the author of the report,\u201d we find that it understood\ncounsel was lodging a Confrontation Clause objection to Armstrong\u2019s testimony.\n           That said, Wilbert\u2019s appellate brief raises issues in this multifarious point of error which were not preserved\nat trial, including that Armstrong\u2019s testimony violated the best-evidence rule and a challenge to her qualifications as\nan expert. We overrule these unpreserved issues. See TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1.\n                                                            4\n\fS.W.3d 119, 123 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2018, pet. ref\u2019d) (citing Herrera v. State, 367 S.W.3d\n\n762, 773 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.); Wood, 299 S.W.3d at 214\u201315); see\n\nWilliams v. State, 513 S.W.3d 619, 637 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2016, pet. ref\u2019d). In such cases,\n\nwe have concluded that an expert\u2019s \u201cindependent conclusion based on her review of the autopsy\n\nreport, photographs, and [histological] slides . . . d[oes] not violate the Confrontation Clause\n\nmerely because it was based, to some degree, on inadmissible evidence.\u201d Moore, 553 S.W.3d at\n\n123 (citing Paredes v. State, 462 S.W.3d 510, 517\u201318 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015); TEX. R. EVID. 703\n\n(\u201cproviding that an expert may base an opinion on facts or data that is not admissible in evidence,\n\nprovided that they are of a type on which experts in the field can reasonably rely\u201d); Martinez v.\n\nState, 22 S.W.3d 504, 508 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000)).\n\n        Given our precedent in Moore, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin overruling Wilbert\u2019s Confrontation Clause objection. For that reason, we overrule Wilbert\u2019s\n\nfirst point of error.\n\nII.     Wilbert\u2019s Complaint that the Trial Court Erred in Sustaining the State\u2019s Hearsay\n        Objection Is Unpreserved\n\n        In his second point on appeal, Wilbert argues that the trial court erred in excluding a report\n\nauthored by Chris Baggett, a Texas Ranger, and in disallowing his testimony about statements\n\nmade by a witness during an interview. We find this issue unpreserved because the report was not\n\noffered into evidence and Wilbert failed to make an offer of proof of Baggett\u2019s testimony.\n\n        Baggett testified that he interviewed a witness who reported he had already been\n\ninterviewed by another officer. The State lodged a hearsay objection to this testimony, which the\n\ntrial court overruled. Baggett continued to testify about his conversation with the witness. When\n                                                  5\n\fBaggett could not recall a few details of the conversation, Wilbert\u2019s counsel requested that Baggett\n\nbe allowed to review a recording of his interview outside the jury\u2019s presence to refresh his\n\nrecollection. After the jury was excused, the State reiterated its objection that Baggett\u2019s testimony\n\n\u201cabout what somebody else said out of court\u201d was hearsay.\n\n         The entire recorded interview with the witness was played for Baggett to refresh his\n\nrecollection, and he was also allowed to review his report. The recording and report were not\n\noffered into evidence. 2        After Baggett\u2019s memory was refreshed, the trial court heard the\n\n\u201cadmissibility question regarding a hearsay objection made by [the State] as to questions that\n\n[Wilbert] propounded to the Ranger.\u201d The State argued, \u201c[T]here\u2019s a difference between the chief\n\ninvestigating officer relying on hearsay in his investigation and explaining why he has certain\n\nconclusions and just basically soliciting a one-sided deposition that also includes relevancy issues.\n\nThat\u2019s my hearsay objection.\u201d Wilbert did not respond to the argument on the record. The trial\n\ncourt sustained the State\u2019s objection and allowed Wilbert to make an offer of proof that would\n\nhave demonstrated which statements Wilbert sought to elicit from Baggett. Wilbert did not make\n\nan offer of proof.\n\n         We conclude that Wilbert has failed to preserve his second point of error.\n\n         Under Texas Rule of Evidence 103,\n\n         A party may claim error in a ruling to admit or exclude evidence only if the error\n         affects a substantial right of the party and:\n\n                  ....\n\n\n2\nThe record demonstrated that the recording was offered as a court exhibit simply for the purpose of refreshing\nBaggett\u2019s recollection. On appeal, Wilbert does not argue that the recording was offered or should have been admitted.\n                                                          6\n\f                         (2) if the ruling excludes evidence, a party informs the court\n                 of its substance by an offer of proof, unless the substance was\n                 apparent from the context.\n\nTEX. R. EVID. 103(a)(2). An offer of proof is necessary \u201cto enable an appellate court to determine\n\nwhether the exclusion was erroneous and harmful\u201d and \u201cto permit the trial judge to reconsider his\n\nruling in light of the actual evidence.\u201d Mays v. State, 285 S.W.3d 884, 890 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009)\n\n(quoting Steven Goode et. al., 1 Texas Practice Series\u2014Guide to the Texas Rules of Evidence:\n\nCivil and Criminal \u00a7 103.3 (2d ed. 1993)); Fahrni v. State, 473 S.W.3d 486, 500\u201301 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nTexarkana 2015, pet. ref\u2019d). \u201cThe complaining party may make his offer of proof through\n\nquestions and answers, or by counsel making a concise statement of the evidence.\u201d Fahrini, 473\n\nS.W.3d at 500 (citing Mays, 285 S.W.3d at 889).\n\n       Because Wilbert did not offer Baggett\u2019s report into evidence, it is not contained in the\n\nappellate record. The trial court allowed Wilbert the opportunity, but he made no offer of proof\n\nabout the contents of the report or the testimony he sought to elicit from Baggett. On appeal, his\n\nbrief does not specify the contents of any particular statement that was excluded but should have\n\nbeen admitted.\n\n       Also, although he failed to do so at trial, Wilbert argues that the statement against interest\n\nexception to the hearsay rule should have been utilized by the trial court to admit Baggett\u2019s\n\nunidentified testimony about his conversation with the witness. As the Texas Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals stated in Golliday v. State,\n\n       While no \u201chyper-technical or formalistic use of words or phrases\u201d is required in\n       order to preserve error, the proffering party must \u201clet the trial judge know what he\n       wants, why he thinks he is entitled to it, and to do so clearly enough for the judge\n\n                                                   7\n\f         to understand him at a time when the judge is in the proper position to do something\n         about it.\u201d\n\nGolliday v. State, 560 S.W.3d 664, 670 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018) (quoting Clark v. State, 365\n\nS.W.3d 333, 339 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012)). \u201c[I]n order to preserve an argument that the exclusion\n\nof defensive evidence violates [particular grounds], a defendant must state the grounds for the\n\nruling that he seeks with sufficient specificity to make the court aware of\u201d them. Id. at 670\u201371.\n\n         We overrule Wilbert\u2019s second point of error because it was unpreserved.\n\nIII.     Wilbert\u2019s Complaint About Admission of Extraneous-Offense Evidence Is\n         Unpreserved\n\n         In his third point of error, Wilbert argues that the trial court erred in admitting extraneous-\n\noffense evidence. To preserve a complaint for our review, a party must first present to the trial\n\ncourt a timely request, objection, or motion stating the specific grounds for the desired ruling if\n\nnot apparent from the context. TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a)(1). The trial court also must have ruled on\n\nthe request, objection, or motion, either expressly or implicitly, or the complaining party must have\n\nobjected to the trial court\u2019s refusal to rule. TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a)(2). Our record shows that\n\nWilbert failed to preserve his third point of error for our review.\n\n         Before trial, Wilbert filed an objection to the admissibility of extraneous offenses and\n\nrequested a pretrial evidentiary hearing. There is no record of a pretrial evidentiary hearing, and\n\nnothing shows that the trial court ruled on the written objection. 3 Instead, Wilbert secured only a\n\n\n\n3\n  In his brief, Wilbert writes, \u201cThe record of that [pretrial] hearing, and of the trial court\u2019s ruling, are not contained in\nthe record.\u201d The State responds that, while \u201c[Wilbert] . . . had a motion for a ruling on the admission of extraneous\nconduct,\u201d he \u201cnever brought [it] . . . to the attention of the Trial Court or sought a ruling.\u201d It is the \u201cappellant\u2019s burden\nto bring forward a record on appeal sufficient to show that the trial court erred.\u201d Amador v. State, 221 S.W.3d 666,\n675 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\n                                                             8\n\fruling on a motion in limine with respect to extraneous offenses. \u201cA motion in limine is only \u2018a\n\npreliminary matter and normally preserves nothing for appellate review.\u2019\u201d Davlin v. State, 531\n\nS.W.3d 765, 768 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2016, no pet.) (quoting Fuller v. State, 253 S.W.3d 220,\n\n232 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008)). \u201cFor error to be preserved with regard to the subject matter of the\n\nmotion in limine it is absolutely necessary that an objection be made at the time when the subject\n\nis raised during trial.\u201d Gonzales v. State, 685 S.W.2d 47, 50 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985).\n\n        Wilbert admits, and the record shows, that, when the extraneous offenses were offered into\n\nevidence, Wilbert affirmatively stated he had \u201c[n]o objection\u201d to the State\u2019s use of the extraneous\n\noffenses. As a result, we find that Wilbert failed to preserve his third point of error. It is thus\n\noverruled. 4\n\nIV.     Wilbert Did Not Preserve Any Complaint About the Omission of a Jury Instruction\n        on Defense of Property\n\n        In his last point of error, Wilbert argues that the trial court erred in omitting an instruction\n\non the defense of property. Because Wilbert did not request this defensive instruction, he failed\n\nto preserve this point for our review.\n\n        A trial court has a duty to instruct the jury sua sponte on any law applicable to the case.\n\nZamora v. State, 411 S.W.3d 504, 513 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013); Posey v. State, 966 S.W.2d 57, 62\n\n\n\n4\n Wilbert also complains of the lack of an instruction on the extraneous-offense evidence. This complaint lacks merit\nsince the trial court\u2019s jury charge contained the following extraneous-offense instruction:\n\n        The State has introduced evidence of extraneous crimes or bad acts other than the one charged in the\n        indictment in this case. This evidence was admitted only for the purpose of assisting you, if it does, for the\n        purpose of showing the defendant\u2019s motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or\n        absence of mistake or accident, if any. You cannot consider the testimony unless you find and believe beyond\n        a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed these acts, if any, were committed [sic].\n                                                         9\n\f(Tex. Crim. App. 1998). Even so, in Posey v. State, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that\n\na trial judge is not \u201crequired to sua sponte instruct the jury on a . . . \u2018defensive issue\u2019 because a\n\n\u2018defensive issue\u2019 is not \u2018applicable to the case\u2019 unless the defendant timely requests the issue or\n\nobjects to the omission of the issue in the jury charge.\u201d Posey, 966 S.W.2d at 62. \u201cThe purpose\n\nof the Posey rule is to prevent a party from \u2018sandbagging\u2019 the trial judge by failing to apprise him,\n\nand the opposing party, of what defensive jury instructions the party wants and why he is entitled\n\nto them.\u201d Mays v. State, 318 S.W.3d 368, 383 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). As a result, \u201c[a]bsent a\n\ntimely and proper request or objection, the defendant cannot claim error on appeal based on the\n\ntrial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury as to a defensive issue.\u201d Flores v. State, 573 S.W.3d 864,\n\n867 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2019, pet. ref\u2019d) (citing Zamora, 411 S.W.3d at 513; Mays,\n\n318 S.W.3d at 382\u201383); see Williams v. State, 273 S.W.3d 200, 223 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (\u201c[A]\n\nparty can forfeit the right to complain about the omission of a defensive issue because the defensive\n\nissue must be requested before the trial court has a duty to place it in the charge, and so no \u2018error\u2019\n\noccurs absent a request.\u201d).\n\n       Our review of the appellate record shows that, while Wilbert requested instructions on self-\n\ndefense, he did not request jury instructions on defense of property. Because he did not preserve\n\nhis jury charge issues, we overrule Wilbert\u2019s last point of error.\n\nV.     We Modify the Judgment by Deleting the Reference to Attorney Fees\n\n       Though we resolved Wilbert\u2019s points of error against him, our review of the record shows\n\nthat the trial court\u2019s judgment must be modified. \u201cThis Court has the power to correct and modify\n\nthe judgment of the trial court for accuracy when the necessary data and information are part of\n\n                                                 10\n\fthe record.\u201d Anthony v. State, 531 S.W.3d 739, 743 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2016, no pet.) (citing\n\nTEX. R. APP. P. 43.2(b); Bigley v. State, 865 S.W.2d 26, 27 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993); Asberry v.\n\nState, 813 S.W.2d 526, 529 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 1991, pet. ref\u2019d)). \u201cThe authority of an appellate\n\ncourt to reform incorrect judgments is not dependent upon the request of any party, nor does it turn\n\non the question of whether a party has or has not objected in the trial court.\u201d Id. (quoting Asberry,\n\n813 S.W.2d at 529\u201330).\n\n       In the space where the trial court would typically memorialize an assessment of attorney\n\nfees, the judgment contains the phrase \u201cto be determined.\u201d The record indicates that the trial court\n\nfound Wilbert indigent at trial. \u201cA defendant who is determined by the court to be indigent is\n\npresumed to remain indigent for the remainder of the proceedings in the case unless a material\n\nchange in the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances occurs.\u201d TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art.\n\n26.04(p) (Supp.); see Cates v. State, 402 S.W.3d 250, 251 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). Also, the trial\n\ncourt expressly found Wilbert indigent on appeal.\n\n       \u201cAn assessment of attorney fees against an indigent defendant, to be determined in the\n\nfuture, is improper.\u201d Priego v. State, 457 S.W.3d 565, 571 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2015, pet.\n\nref\u2019d). Article 26.05(g) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure \u201crequires a present determination\n\nof financial resources and does not allow speculation about possible future resources.\u201d Id. (quoting\n\nCates, 402 S.W.3d at 252). As a result, we modify the trial court\u2019s judgment by deleting the phrase\n\n\u201cto be determined\u201d and substituting an assessment of $0.00 for attorney fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fVI.    Conclusion\n\n       We modify the trial court\u2019s judgment by deleting the phrase \u201cto be determined\u201d and\n\nsubstituting an assessment of $0.00 for attorney fees. As modified, we affirm the trial court\u2019s\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                           Scott E.
