Newman (Doc. #22), to whom this case was referred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b), and noting that no objections have been filed thereto and that the time for filing such objections under Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b)(2) has expired, the Court adopts the aforesaid Report and Recommendation in its entirety.\nGiven that Petitioner has not .made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right and, further, that the Court\u2019s decision herein would not be debatable among reasonable jurists, and because any appeal from this Court\u2019s decision would be objectively frivolous, Petitioner is denied a certificate of appealability on all claims and leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal.\n' The captioned case is hereby ordered terminated upon the docket records of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division, at Dayton.\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION1\nMICHAEL J. NEWMAN, United States Magistrate Judge.\nThis case is now before the Court upon Petitioner Robert Hancher\u2019s request for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C: \u00a7 2254 (doc. 2); Respondent\u2019s Return of Writ (doc. 9); Petitioner\u2019s Traverse (doc. 13);2 Respondent\u2019s Surreply, filed with leave of Court (doc. 17); and Petitioner\u2019s response to Respondent\u2019s Surreply, also filed with leave of Court (doc. 18).\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Factual Background\nThe Montgomery County Ohio Court of Appeals summarized the facts underlying Petitioner\u2019s convictions as follows:3\nLate in the evening of February 1, 2008, Robert Hancher; his half-brother, Antonio Gomez; his girlfriend, Grace Agullana; his friend, Robert (Tyler) Kleekamp; Agullana\u2019s cousin, Megan Hayes; Timothy (T.J.) Bradley; and two female friends of Agullana (Stacy Kinsel *646and a woman identified only as \u201cMichelle\u201d) gathered at Meercat\u2019s Bar, located at 1227 Wilmington Pike in Dayton, Ohio. Hancher called his friend, Paul Credlebaugh, to join them; Credlebaugh came with two other individuals, who left at about 11:30 p.m. Hayes invited Paul Day to come to Meercat\u2019s. Day came and later called his friend, Stephen Sipos, who met Day at Meercat\u2019s.\nWhile in Meercat\u2019s, the group gathered at tables and at the bar. Hayes and Kinsel went \u25a0 behind the bar and served free mixed drinks to their friends. At one point, Sipos \u201cmade a pass\u201d at Agullana. Agullana informed Hancher, who told Sipos that Agullana was his girlfriend. Sipos \u201cbrushed it off,\u201d and no confrontation occurred in the bar.\nShortly before 2:00 a.m., the establishment\u2019s owner announced that the bar would be closing. Hancher, Gomez, and Agullana left Meercat\u2019s by the establishment\u2019s back door. Sipos came out of the back door soon thereafter and began \u201cexchanging words\u201d with Hancher in the parking lot located behind Meercat\u2019s and several other businesses. Sipos and Hancher grabbed each other. Kleekamp exited the bar from the back door and approached the two men. When Credlebaugh left the bar, Kleekamp was standing behind and within reaching distance of Sipos. Credlebaugh saw that Hancher was \u201cpretty heated\u201d over something and asked him what was going on. Hancher responded that Sipos had said something about his (Hancher\u2019s) girlfriend. Credlebaugh told Hancher to \u201clet it slide,\u201d but Hancher said that he would not let it slide.\nKleekamp \u201csucker punched\u201d Sipos from behind, hitting him in the face. Sipos fell to the ground on his stomach. Hancher and Kleekamp began kicking Sipos repeatedly in the face and on his head. Credlebaugh stated that Hancher \u201cwas kicking [Sipos] hard, but nothing like the way [Kleekamp] was.\u201d Gomez punched Sipos in the head once and encouraged the assault. Credlebaugh stated that he approached and tried to pull Hancher and Kleekamp away from Sipos. Hancher eventually stopped kicking Sipos. Credlebaugh grabbed Kleekamp by his sweatshirt and pulled him off of Sipos. Credlebaugh yelled at the group to go to the car. Throughout the assault, Sipos did not try to defend himself and appeared to be unconscious.\nAs Credlebaugh went to check on Sipos\u2019 condition, Kleekamp returned and stomped down on the back of Sipos\u2019 head with his foot. Kleekamp then went to his car and sped away to Gomez\u2019s nearby apartment with Hancher, Gomez, Agullana, and Kinsel. At that time, Sipos was still breathing, but unconscious. Credlebaugh observed that Sipos\u2019 face and head were covered in blood. Credlebaugh left the parking lot and walked to Gomez\u2019s apartment.\nSoon thereafter, Hayes and Day left Meercat\u2019s by the back door and saw someone on the ground in the parking lot. They approached and observed Sipos lying face down with blood around his face. Sipos was breathing \u201creally weird,\u201d as if he were gurgling blood. They tried unsuccessfully to turn him over. Day called 911 and waited nearby for emergency assistance to arrive. Hayes went back inside Meereat\u2019s and told Michelle and Bradley about Sipos; the three left through Meercat\u2019s front entrance and walked to Gomez\u2019s apartment.\nBrian Rinderle, the bouncer for nearby Taggart\u2019s Pub, had observed Kleekamp, Hancher and others yelling to a woman to get into Kleekamp\u2019s car and, after she got in, saw the car leave the *647Meercat\u2019s parking lot and speed away down Wilmington Pike. Rinderle and a security guard for Taggart\u2019s went to the back of Meercat\u2019s and discovered Sipos. The security guard contacted the police and learned that the police had already been notified of the assault. Rinderle and the security guard also waited for the police to arrive.\nDayton Police Officers John Howard and Dave Kluwan responded to the calls. Howard observed Day standing in the parking lot by the Pony Keg (another business that shared the parking lot with Meercat\u2019s); Day was waving his arms to get the officers\u2019 attention. Day advised Howard that his friend had been beaten, and he pointed the officers 'to Sipos\u2019s location. Medics arrived a few minutes later and transported Sipos to Miami Valley Hospital. Sipos died at the hospital.\nAt Gomez\u2019s apartment, Hancher and Kleekamp bragged about how they had beaten Sipos. According to Credlebaugh, Hancher said, \u201cI showed him\u201d and \u201cI beat the hell out of the guy.\u201d When Hayes, Michelle, and Bradley arrived at Gomez\u2019s apartment, they informed the group that Sipos had died. Credlebaugh told Hancher that he was \u201cdone with [him]\u201d and left the apartment. Hancher and Kleekamp began to discuss fleeing to Florida.\nHancher, Kleekamp, Agullana, Hayes, and Bradley left Gomez\u2019s apartment and drove in Kleekamp\u2019s car to Hancher\u2019s father\u2019s house near downtown Dayton. Hancher went inside to ask his father for money so that he could go to Florida. Hancher was unable to obtain money from his father, and he returned to the car. Kleekamp decided to drive to his uncle\u2019s house so that he could ask for money to go to Florida. Along the way, they took Hayes to her mother\u2019s home. Hayes tried to convince Agullana to come with her, too, but Agullana remained in the car. When Hayes got out of the vehicle, Hancher told her \u201cnot to tell anybody.\u201d\nKleekamp and Hancher continued to talk about running to Florida as they drove to Kleekamp\u2019s uncle\u2019s home. After Kleekamp talked with his uncle, the uncle called the police.\nWhen the police arrived at Kleekamp\u2019s uncle\u2019s residence, Kleekamp, Hancher, Agullana, and Bradley went to the police station and provided statements. Kleekamp orally consented to the search of his vehicle and signed a form reflecting that consent. The police took photos of Kleekamp and Hancher and obtained Kleekamp\u2019s shoes and Hancher\u2019s \u25a0 boots and jeans; the police later obtained the jeans and polo shirt that Gomez had been wearing. Sipos\u2019s blood was found on Kleekamp\u2019s shoes, Hancher\u2019s boots, Hancher\u2019s jeans, and Gomez\u2019s shirt.\nState v. Hancher, No. 23515, 2010 Ohio App. LEXIS 2047, at *2-7, 2010 WL 2225413, at *1-3 (Ohio Ct.App. June 4, 2010) (doc. 9-1 at PagelD 109-13).\nB. Procedural Background\nIn June 2009, Petitioner was convicted by jury verdict of felony murder in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2903.02(B)\u2014 with a predicate offense of felonious assault \u2019 under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2903.11(A)(2) \u2014 in the Montgomery County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas. Doc. 9-1 at PagelD 106, 138. Petitioner was sentenced to fifteen years-to-life imprisonment. Id. Before trial, Petitioner, with the assistance of counsel, filed a motion to suppress evidence, which the trial court denied following an evidentiary hearing. Id. at PagelD 146-47, 161-75.\n*648With the assistance of counsel, Petitioner timely appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Second District Ohio Court of Appeals. Id. at PagelD 176-206. Petitioner asserted the following assignments of error:\n1. The trial court erred in denying [my] motion to suppress;\n2. The trial court erred in upholding the jury\u2019s conviction for murder because the conviction was against the weight and sufficiency of the evidence;\n3. The trial court erred in failing to give a charge for the lesser included offenses of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter; and\n4. The trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial for prosecutorial misconduct.\nId. at PagelD 178-79 (capitalization altered; brackets added). On June 4, 2010, the Ohio Court of Appeals overruled all four assignments of error, and affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. Id. at PagelD 108-35.\nPetitioner, again with the assistance of counsel, appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court of Ohio, raising one assignment of error: \u201c[My] constitutional right against self-incrimination was violated when [I] was not Mirandized prior to [my] custodial interrogation.\u201d Id. at PagelD 399 (capitalization altered; brackets and italics added). On October 13, 2010, the Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed his appeal as not involving any substantial constitutional question. Id. at PagelD 446.\nOn September 6, 2011, Petitioner filed the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Docs. 1, 2. He pleads two grounds for relief:\nGROUND ONE: Petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights were violated when he was not Mirandized prior to his custodial interrogation, in violation of his 5th, 6th and 14th Amendment rights;\nSupporting Facts: Petitioner was interrogated without being given his Miranda warnings and statements that were elicited during this interrogation were used at Petitioner\u2019s trial. Physical evidence was also collected and subsequently used at trial in spite of the defense\u2019s attempts to have these statements and evidence suppressed. GROUND TWO: Petitioner\u2019s conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence to sustain his conviction.\nSupporting Facts: The State of Ohio did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim\u2019s murder was a proximate result of Defendant\u2019s commission of] or attempt to commit felonious assault, in violation of Ohio Revised Code 2903.02(B).\nDoc. 2 at PagelD 38, 40 (capitalization and punctuation altered; italics added).\nII. ANALYSIS\nA. AEDPA Standard\nUnder the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), when the state court decides a federal constitutional claim on the merits, the federal habeas court must defer to the state court decision unless: (1) the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d; or (2) the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceedings.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law \u201cif the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [the Supreme Court\u2019s] cases\u201d or \u201cif the state *649court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of [the Supreme] Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from [that] precedent.\u201d Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it \u201ccorrectly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d Id. at 407-08, 120 S.Ct. 1495. \u201cA state court\u2019s determination that a claim lacks merit precludes habeas relief so long as \u2018fairminded jurists could disagree\u2019 on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (citation omitted).\nIn reviewing a habeas petitioner\u2019s claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), the Court is \u201climited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.\u201d Cullen v. Pinholster, \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1398, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011). Further, a state court\u2019s factual findings are presumed correct unless the petitioner rebuts them by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). This statutory presumption of correctness also extends to factual findings made by a state appellate court\u2019s review of the trial record. Girts, supra note 3, 501 F.3d at 749.\nUnder principles of comity, the state courts should have the first opportunity to hear habeas claims and provide any necessary relief. O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 844-45, 119 S.Ct. 1728, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999). Accordingly, a federal habeas petitioner must exhaust his or her state court remedies \u2014 by fairly presenting his or her constitutional claims to the state\u2019s highest court \u2014 before raising them in federal court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b); O\u2019Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 844-45, 119 S.Ct. 1728. If (1) the state court rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim based on his or her failure to comply with a state procedural rule, or (2) the petitioner failed to exhaust his or her state court remedies and no avenue of relief remains open, or it would otherwise be futile to pursue the state remedies, the petitioner has waived that claim for habeas review under the procedural default doctrine. See Williams v. Anderson, 460 F.3d 789, 806 (6th Cir.2006).\nB. Ground One\nIn Ground One, Petitioner argues that his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, established in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), was violated. He claims the police elicited incriminating statements from him, and seized his clothing, without first reading him his Miranda rights. The Montgomery County, Ohio Court of Appeals disagreed with Petitioner, concluding that under the circumstances, Petitioner was not in custody:4\nThe need for Miranda warnings is triggered by custodial interrogation. Berkemer v. McCarty (1984), 468 U.S. 420, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317. The State may not use any statements made during a custodial interrogation unless it \u201cdemonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, supra, 384 U.S. at 444 [86 S.Ct. 1602]. A determination whether a custodial interrogation has occurred requires the use of an objective standard of \u201chow a reasonable man in the suspect\u2019s position would have under*650stood his situation.\u201d Berkemer v. McCarty, supra, 468 U.S. at 442 [104 S.Ct. 3138]. \u201c[I]n order for a court to conclude that a suspect is in custody, it must be evident that, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable man in the suspect\u2019s position would feel a restraint on his freedom of movement fairly characterized as that degree associated with a formal arrest to such extent that he would not feel free to leave.\u201d Id.\nWith this standard in mind, we turn to the following evidence, which we adduced from the testimony of Detective Beane, Detective Hall, and Sergeant White given at the hearing on the motion to suppress. Hancher did not testify-\nDayton Police Officers were dispatched to a call regarding an assault on Wilmington Avenue. Dayton Police Homicide Supervisor, Sergeant Gary White, was also dispatched to Meercat\u2019s Bar. By the time he arrived at the scene, the victim of the assault, Sipos, had already been removed from the scene by EMTs. White assigned Detective Hall to the parking lot scene and Detective Beane was assigned to interview witnesses at the scene.\nBeane interviewed two witnesses, and Hall conducted an investigation of the scene. In the meantime, Dayton Police Dispatch informed White that he should respond to an apartment on Coach Drive in Kettering, Ohio, to contact possible witnesses to the incident. White instructed uniformed officers to respond to that location. White also went to the Kettering address, as did Beane following her witness interviews. Hall returned to the Dayton Police Department Safety Building.\nUltimately, it was determined that Kleekamp\u2019s uncle, Jim Kleekamp, had called the Kettering Police, who in turn notified the Dayton Police Department that there were possible witnesses to the assault at the Kettering apartment.\nUpon arriving at the Kettering residence, White and Beane noticed five or six marked police cruisers present in the parking lot without their overhead lights on. There were also several uniformed police officers in the apartment. Also present in the apartment were Kleekamp, his uncle, Hancher, Agullana and Bradley. At that point, White did not know whether the persons in the apartment were suspects or witnesses. Therefore, Tyler Kleekamp, Hancher, Agullana and Bradley were asked to go downtown for interviews. None of the four said that they did not want to go downtown; according to the testimony, it was agreed that they would all proceed downtown for further interviews.\nThe four individuals were then placed in four different cruisers and transported downtown. Of the four, only Kleekamp was placed in handcuffs. According to his escorting officer, the use of handcuffs was merely precautionary and was based solely on his decision to use the cuffs for \u201cofficer safety.\u201d\nThe four individuals were escorted into the Safety Building and placed in separate interview rooms. The doors to the rooms were left open, without a guard, but were in direct line of sight of the officers. Detectives Hall and Beane then conducted interviews of the four. They spoke to Hancher at about 6:30 a.m. Detective Hall asked Hancher about some redness and swelling around Hancher\u2019s left eye, about which Hancher appeared unaware. Hall then escorted Hancher to a bathroom, where he was able to observe his face in a mirror. Hall also observed what appeared to be drops of blood on Hancher\u2019s shoes and *651pants and asked Hancher if he would turn those items over to the police. Hancher stated that he would agree to turn over the items \u201cas long as [he had] a pair of pants to wear\u201d home. Hall found a pair of pants and gave those to Hancher. The interview with Hancher took about twenty minutes. After their interviews, the four were permitted to leave and were provided transportation home.\nAlthough we regard this as a close issue, upon this record, we conclude that Hancher was not subjected to a custodial interrogation. The contact with the police was not triggered by a police investigation, but by Jim Kleekamp\u2019s call to the police. The four individuals did not attempt to leave the apartment before the arrival of the police, and then they agreed to go to downtown Dayton for interviews. There is no evidence that Hancher was handcuffed, or that he saw Kleekamp in handcuffs. While at the police station, Hancher was placed in an interview room, and the door to the room remained open. Hancher, though \u201csomewhat defiant,\u201d cooperated with the police, and there is no evidence to indicate that his statements, and the surrender of his clothing, were other than voluntary.\nBased upon the totality of the circumstances, the trial court determined that Hancher was not subjected to custodial interrogation necessitating the use of Miranda warnings. We agree, and conclude that the trial court did not err by overruling Hancher\u2019s motion to suppress.\nDoc. 9-1 at PagelD 115-18.\nAs the Ohio Court of Appeals correctly invoked Miranda and Berkemer in reviewing Petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment self-incrimination claim, the Court\u2019s task on habeas review is determine whether the state court\u2019s decision involved an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). In doing so, the Court must accept the facts set forth by the Ohio Court of Appeals, as Petitioner has failed to rebut those facts by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); Girts, 501 F.3d at 749.\n\u201cThe procedural safeguards outlined in Miranda apply only to suspects subject to \u2018custodial interrogation.\u2019 \u201d Hoffner v. Bradshaw, 622 F.3d 487, 511 (6th Cir.2010). The Sixth Circuit has explained the \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d requirement as follows:\nThe Miranda Court defined custodial interrogation as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602. A suspect is \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of receiving Miranda protection if there has been a \u201cformal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement.\u201d Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977). \u201c[T]he initial determination of custody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.\u201d Stansbury v. California, 511 U.S. 318, 323, 114 S.Ct. 1526, 128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994) (per curiam). Miranda warnings are not required \u201csimply because the questioning takes place in the station house, or because the questioned person is one whom the police suspect.\u201d California v. Beheler, 463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S.Ct. 3517, 77 L.Ed.2d 1275 (1983) (per curiam) (quoting Mathiason, 429 U.S. at 495, 97 S.Ct. 711). \u201c[T]he only relevant inquiry is how a reasonable *652man in the suspect\u2019s position would have understood his situation.\u201d Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 442, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984).\nMason v. Mitchell, 320 F.3d 604, 631 (6th Cir.2003).\nIn Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004), the Supreme Court similarly analyzed a state court\u2019s application of the Miranda custody test under AEDPA\u2019s unreasonable application prong. The Court found the Miranda custody test is a \u201cgeneral\u201d rule\u2014rather than a specific one\u2014and noted that, \u201c[a]pplying a general standard to a specific case can demand a substantial element of judgment.\u201d Yarborough, 541 U.S. at 664-66, 124 S.Ct. 2140. While recognizing that \u201ccertain facts weighted] against a finding that [the defendant] was in custody\u201d and \u201c[o]ther facts point[ed] in the opposite direction,\u201d the Court concluded that the state court\u2019s application of the Miranda custody test was not objectively unreasonable. Id. at 664-65, 124 S.Ct. 2140. Accord Joseph v. Coyle, 469 F.3d 441, 466-68 (6th Cir.2006) (finding the state appellate court\u2019s decision was not objectively unreasonable despite the \u201cdiffering indications\u201d of whether the defendant was in custody for Miranda purposes).\nIn Petitioner\u2019s case, there are likewise \u201cdiffering indications\u201d of whether he was in custody. See Yarborough, 541 U.S. at 665, 124 S.Ct. 2140. Indeed, the Ohio Court of Appeals acknowledged in its opinion that it was a \u201cclose issue.\u201d Doc. 9-1 at PagelD 117. However, under AEDPA, this Court cannot grant habeas relief \u201cby conducting [its] own independent inquiry into whether the state court was correct as a de novo matter.\u201d Yarborough, 541 U.S. at 665, 124 S.Ct. 2140. Rather, habeas relief is available \u201conly if the state court\u2019s decision is objectively unreasonable.\u201d Id. Here, the Ohio Court of Appeals reasonably determined that Petitioner was not subject to a custodial interrogation in light of the facts\u2014i.e., his uncle called the police; Petitioner agreed to be transported to the police station for the interview, and cooperated with the police; he was not handcuffed; and the interview door remained open. See doc. 9-1 at PagelD 117-18. Accordingly, Ground One should be DISMISSED.\nC. Ground Two\nIn Ground Two, Petitioner argues that his conviction is supported by insufficient evidence to satisfy the Due Process Clause. Respondent argues that Ground Two is procedurally defaulted because Petitioner failed to exhaust this claim in the state courts. The Court agrees with Respondent. Petitioner raised this issue on direct appeal to the Ohio Court of Appeals. See doc. 9-1 at PagelD 177-206. However, he did not include this argument in his appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio. See id. at PagelD 398-45. Failure to present an issue to the state supreme court on discretionary review constitutes procedural default. O'Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 845-48, 119 S.Ct. 1728; Williams, 460 F.3d at 806-07 (finding a habeas claim is procedurally defaulted because, although the petitioner had raised the issue before the Ohio Court of Appeals, he failed to raise the issue before the Supreme Court of Ohio in his direct appeal).\nAccordingly, to overcome the procedural default, Petitioner must \u201cdemonstrate[ ] cause for the default and prejudice resulting therefrom, or that failing to review the claim would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d Williams, 460 F.3d at 805-06. To meet the \u201ccause\u201d prong, a habeas petitioner must \u201cshow that some objective factor external to the defense\u201d caused his failure to comply with *653the state\u2019s procedural rule, Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986), and, if the petitioner fails to do so, the Court need not consider the prejudice prong. Smith v. Murray, 477 U.S. 527, 533-34, 106 S.Ct. 2661, 91 L.Ed.2d 434 (1986).\nAs cause for his procedural default, Petitioner asserts the attorneys representing him on appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio were ineffective for failing to raise his insufficient evidence claim. See doc. 13 at PagelD 456-57. However, such alleged attorney error does not constitute cause to excuse his procedural default because he was not constitutionally entitled to counsel on discretionary appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 755-57, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991); Arnold v. Warden, 832 F.Supp.2d 853, 859 (S.D.Ohio 2011).5\nAlternatively, and assuming, arguendo, that Ground Two was properly preserved for habeas review, this claim fails on the merits. In order for a conviction to be constitutionally sound, every element of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). The test for analyzing sufficiency-of-the-evidence claims, established in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Davis v. Lafler, 658 F.3d 525, 531 (6th Cir.2011) (en banc) (emphasis in original). The Court should not \u201csubstitute its opinion as to the weight of the evidence or the' credibility of witnesses.\u201d Benge v. Johnson, 312 F.Supp.2d 978, 1000 (S.D.Ohio 2004).\nNot only is the Jackson standard itself demanding, but a habeas court must apply an additional level of deference in considering such claims under AEDPA. Davis, 658 F.3d at 531. A habeas court\u2019s task is to determine whether it was \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d for the state court, applying the Jackson standard, to conclude there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction. Saxton v. Sheets, 547 F.3d 597, 602 (6th Cir.2008).\nThe Ohio Court of Appeals reviewed this claim, and reasonably determined that it had no merit:\nIn this assignment of error, Hancher contends that his conviction for murder was based on insufficient evidence and was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\nSufficiency and manifest weight challenges are separate and legally distinct issues. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 1997-Ohio-52, 678 N.E.2d 541. \u201cWhile the test for sufficiency requires a determination of whether the State has met its burden of production at trial, a manifest weight challenge questions whether the State has met its burden of persuasion.\u201d Id. at 390 [678 N.E.2d 541].\nA sufficiency of the evidence argument challenges whether the State has *654presented adequate evidence on each element of the offense to allow the case to go to the jury or to sustain the verdict as a matter of law. Id. at 386 [678 N.E.2d 541]. \u201cAn appellate court\u2019s,function when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d State v. Jenks (1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.\nIn contrast, when reviewing a judgment under a manifest weight standard of review \u201c \u2018[t]he court reviewing the \u2022.entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the [factfinder] clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019 \u201d Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387 [678 N.E.2d 541], quoting State v. Martin (1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 Ohio B.[O.B.R] 215, 485 N.E.2d 717.\nThe indictment in this case charged that Hancher \u201cdid cause the death of another, to wit: STEPHEN SIPOS, as a proximate result of the offender\u2019s committing or attempting to commit an offense of violence, to wit: FELONIOUS ASSAULT, . in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), a felony of the SECOND DEGREE * * R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) provides that \u201c[n]o person shall knowingly * * * cause serious physical harm to another.\u201d \u201cA person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature.\u201d R.C. 2901.22(B).\nFirst, Hancher argues that the State failed to present sufficient evidence that his \u201cintent\u201d was to cause serious harm to Sipos. Although Hancher does not dispute that Sipos\u2019s death was caused by blunt force injuries to the head and neck, he asserts that \u201cit does not follow that just because Hancher punched or even kicked Sipos and Sipos later died, that Hancher\u2019s blows were made with an intent to cause serious physical harm as that term is defined in the Revised Code.\u201d Hancher argues that his lack of intent to cause serious physical harm is demonstrated by the coroner\u2019s testimony that Sipos\u2019s external injuries consisted of a split lip, a broken nose, and cuts above one eyebrow and his left ear, and by Sipos\u2019s lack of a broken skull, noticeable brain injury, broken bones (other than the nose), and damage to vital organs.\nContrary to Hancher\u2019s assertions, the State was not required to prove that he kicked and punched Sipos with the \u201cintent\u201d to cause serious physical harm. Rather, the State had the burden of proving that Hancher was aware that his conduct would probably cause serious physical harm to Sipos. R.C. 2901.22(B). On this record, we have no difficulty finding that the State presented sufficient evidence that Hancher knowingly caused serious physical harm to Sipos, which proximately resulted in Sipos\u2019s death. Credlebaugh, who stated that he had known Hancher his whole life and had been a very close friend of *655Hancher in February 2008, testified that he observed Hancher\u2019s assault of Sipos. According to Credlebaugh, after Hancher stated that he was \u201cnot going to let [Sipos\u2019s comments] slide,\u201d Kleekamp and Hancher simultaneously swung with their fists at Sipos\u2019s head. Although Credlebaugh described Hancher\u2019s punch as a \u201cjab,\u201d the combination of Hancher\u2019s blow with Kleekamp\u2019s punch caused Sipos to fall to the ground. Credlebaugh then observed Hancher repeatedly \u201ckicking [Sipos] hard\u201d with his boots; all of the blows were to Sipos\u2019s head. Credlebaugh pulled Hancher away from Sipos. Credlebaugh further testified that Hancher had bragged-about \u201cbeatfing] the hell out of\u2019 Sipos, upon returning to Gomez\u2019s apartment after the altercation.\nHancher\u2019s girlfriend, Agullana,- did not see Hancher punch Sipos. However, she testified that, after Sipos was lying on the ground, Hancher was \u201cbringing his foot back and kicking\u201d Sipos. Agullana stated that the multiple kicks were \u201chard\u201d and directed to Sipos\u2019s head. Both Credlebaugh and Agullana stated that Sipos did not react or do anything physically while he was on the ground being kicked.\nDr. Kent Harshbarger, forensic pathologist and deputy coroner for Montgomery County, conducted Sipos\u2019s autopsy. Dr. Harshbarger indicated that Sipos had suffered \u201cmultiple significant blows,\u201d and' he identified at least ten separate impacts to Sipos\u2019s scalp. He stated that nearly all of Sipos\u2019s scalp had hemorrhage or blood loss due to blunt force injury. He opined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Sipos had died from blunt force injuries of the head and neck.\nThe State\u2019s evidence, if believed, was sufficient to demonstrate that Hancher knowingly caused serious physical harm to Sipos and that Sipos died as a result of the Felonious Assault. Upon review of the evidence in the record, we cannot say that the jury \u201clost its way\u201d when it found Hancher guilty of Murder, as charged in the indictment.\nHancher further claims that there was no evidence that he aided or abetted his co-defendants in committing Felonious Assault. R.C. 2923.03(A)(2), the complicity statute, provides: \u201cNo person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense, shall do any of the following: * * * (2) Aid or abet another in committing the offense.\u201d A -person who is complicit in an offense may be charged and punished as if he were the principal offender, and a charge of complicity may be stated under R.C. 2923.03 or in terms of the principal offense. R.C. 2923.03(F). \u201cTo support a conviction for complicity by aiding and abetting pursuant to R.C. 2923.03(A)(2), the evidence must show that the def\u00e9ndant supported, assisted, encouraged, cooperated with, advised, or incited the principal in the commission of the crime, and' that the defendant shared the criminal intent of the principal. Such intent may be inferred from the . circumstances surrounding the crime.\u201d State v. Johnson, 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 245, 2001-Ohio-1336, 754 N.E.2d 796; State v. Wilson, Montgomery App. No. 22581, 2009-Ohio-525, P27 [2009 WL 282079],\nThe State provided ample evidence that Hancher acted in concert with Kleekamp in committing a Felonious Assault. As stated above, Credlebaugh testified that Hancher and Kleekamp punched Sipos simultaneously after Sipos approached Hancher and Agullana using obscene' language and hand gestures. .The two men then, together, repeatedly kicked Sipos in the head while Sipos lay unmoving on the ground; *656Kleekamp stomped Sipos\u2019s head in a \u201cruthless\u201d manner. The coroner\u2019s evidence established that the multiple blows to the head and neck, caused Sipos\u2019s death. In short, even if Kleekamp struck more serious blows,, the State presented sufficient evidence that Hancher aided and abetted Kleekamp in committing Felonious Assault, which resulted in Sipos\u2019s death.\nDoc. 9-1 at PagelD 118-22.\nThe Ohio Court of Appeals reasonably determined that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of felonious assault and felony murder were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781. The coroner opined that the victim, died from blunt force injuries. Doc. 21-2 at PagelD 603-04. The State presented two eyewitnesses who testified that Petitioner and his co-defendant hit the victim, and repeatedly kicked the victim in the head while he was on the ground. Doc. 21-2 at PagelD 672-76, 772. In addition, a witness testified that Petitioner bragged about beating the victim. Doc. 21-3 at PagelD 700-01.\nIn sum, Ground Two should be dismissed because it is procedurally defaulted; and, even if it were not, it fails on the merits.\nIII. RECOMMENDATION\nBased on the foregoing analysis, it is RECOMMENDED that Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition for a, writ of habeas, corpus be DISMISSED with prejudice, and this case be TERMINATED upon the Court\u2019s docket.\nReasonable jurists would not disagree with the recommended disposition on all grounds for relief. See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Further, an appeal of an Order adopting this Report and Recommendation would not be taken in objective good faith. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Coppedge v. United States, 369 U.S. 438, 445-46, 82 S.Ct. 917, 8 L.Ed.2d 21 (1962). Therefore, if Petitioner seeks to appeal an Order adopting this Report and Recommendation, the Court RECOMMENDS that Petitioner be DENIED a certificate of appealability as well as in forma pauperis status on appeal.\nFiled June 3, 2013.\n\nNOTICE REGARDING OBJECTIONS\n\nPursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b), any party may serve and file specific, written objections to the proposed findings and recommendations within FOURTEEN days after being served with this Report and Recommendation. Pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 6(d), this period is extended to SEVENTEEN days because this Report is being served by one of the methods of service listed in Fed.R.Civ.P. 5(b)(2)(B)(C), (D) and may be extended further by the Court on timely motion for an extension. Such objections shall specify the portions of the Report objected to and shall be accompanied by a memorandum of law in support of the objections. If the Report and Recommendation is based in whole or in part upon matters occurring of record at an oral hearing, the objecting party shall promptly arrange for the transcription of the record, or such portions of it as all parties may agree upon or the Magistrate Judge deems sufficient, unless the assigned District Judge otherwise directs. A party may respond to another party\u2019s objections within FOURTEEN days after being served with a copy thereof. Failure to make objections in accordance with this procedure may forfeit rights on appeal. See United States v. Walters, 638 F.2d 947 *657(6th Cir.1981); Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985).\n\n. Attached hereto is a NOTICE to the parties regarding objections to this Report and Recommendation.\n\n\n. After the time for filing a Traverse had passed, Petitioner requested an extension of time and, in the interest of justice, the Court granted his request. Docs. 10, 12. Additionally, the Court Ordered Respondent to file the state court trial transcripts, as they were not initially filed with the Return of Writ. Docs. 19, 21.\n\n\n.These factual findings are presumed to be correct because Petitioner has not rebutted that presumption by clear and convincing evidence. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); Girts v. Yanai, 501 F.3d 743, 749 (6th Cir.2007). This statutory presumption of correctness extends to factual findings made by state appellate courts on the basis of their review of trial court records. Id.\n\n\n. This Court looks to the Ohio Court of Appeals' decision, as it was \"the last state court to issue a reasoned opinion on the issue.\u201d Payne v. Bell, 418 F.3d 644, 660-61 (6th Cir.2005).\n\n\n. The United States Supreme Court's recent decision in Martinez v. Ryan, - U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1309, 182 L.Ed.2d 272 (2012), does not change this result, contrary to Petitioner's arguments. See doc. 13 at PagelD 457. In Martinez, the Court explicitly stated: \"The rule of Coleman governs in all but the limited circumstances recognized here. The holding in this case does not concern attorney errors in other kinds of proceedings, including ... petitions for discretionary review in a State's appellate courts.\u201d Martinez, 132 S.Ct. at 1320 (internal citations omitted). See Hodges v. Colson, 711 F.3d 589, 602-03 (6th Cir.2013); Moore v. Mitchell, 708 F.3d 760, 784-85 (6th Cir.2013).\n\n",
