Wilbur Hernandez-Ortega, a.k.a. Wilber Hernandez-Ortega, petitions for\n\nreview of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that affirmed an immigration\n\njudge\u2019s (IJ) denial of his application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture (CAT).\n\n       Hernandez-Ortega is a native and citizen of El Salvador. He unlawfully entered the\n\nUnited States in September 2011, and he was removed the same month. Hernandez-Ortega\n\nunlawfully reentered the United States in December 2011, and he was ordered to appear before\n\nan immigration judge after an asylum officer determined that he had established a reasonable\n\nfear of persecution if removed to El Salvador.\n\fNo. 17-3409\nHernandez-Ortega v. Sessions\n\n       Hernandez-Ortega filed an application for withholding of removal and relief under the\n\nCAT, alleging that, if he were removed to El Salvador, gang members would persecute and\n\ntorture him because of his Christian religion and his attempts to convince gang members to join\n\nhis church. The IJ denied the application, concluding that Hernandez-Ortega\u2019s testimony was\n\nnot credible and that he failed to establish entitlement to relief. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s\n\ndecision.\n\n       On appeal, Hernandez-Ortega raises the following arguments:          (1) the IJ\u2019s adverse\n\ncredibility determination was improper; (2) the BIA erred by failing to address one of his\n\narguments; (3) the BIA erred by concluding that his corroborative evidence was insufficient to\n\nestablish his entitlement to relief; and (4) he was denied due process when the IJ allowed the\n\ngovernment to cross-examine him about his prior sworn statement without giving him adequate\n\ntime to review the statement with his counsel.\n\n       The BIA issued an independent decision, so we review the BIA\u2019s determination,\n\nincluding any parts of the IJ\u2019s reasoning referenced by the BIA. Khozhaynova v. Holder,\n\n641 F.3d 187, 191 (6th Cir. 2011). We review legal conclusions de novo and factual findings\n\nand credibility determinations for substantial evidence. Id. Under the substantial-evidence\n\nstandard, administrative findings of fact \u201care conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would\n\nbe compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d Id.\n\n       Hernandez-Ortega first argues that the adverse credibility determination was improper\n\nbecause the IJ demonstrated antagonism toward him or engaged in impermissible speculation\n\nand conjecture in three instances. First, after Hernandez-Ortega testified that gang members\n\nthreatened to kill him in 2008 (which implied that they would follow through on their threats if\n\nhe returned), the IJ pointed out through questioning that the gang members did not kill him in\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fNo. 17-3409\nHernandez-Ortega v. Sessions\n\n2010 when they allegedly attacked him with a knife and a rock. Second, after Hernandez-\n\nOrtega\u2019s counsel asked him about being stabbed with a knife during the 2010 incident, the IJ\n\npointed out that Hernandez-Ortega had testified that he was cut on the arm with a knife, not\n\nstabbed. And third, the IJ noted in his decision that Hernandez-Ortega could not explain why the\n\ngang members did not kill him during the 2010 incident if it was their intention to do so.\n\nHernandez-Ortega further argues that the adverse credibility determination was improper\n\nbecause the IJ interjected his personal beliefs by stating that Hernandez-Ortega\u2019s assertion that\n\nhis scars were from the 2010 incident would be accepted as true only if the IJ concluded that\n\nHernandez-Ortega was a credible witness.\n\n       Hernandez-Ortega\u2019s arguments provide no basis for disturbing the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination. Nothing about the IJ\u2019s questions or statements suggests that he was improperly\n\nantagonistic toward Hernandez-Ortega or that he based any decision on speculation or\n\nconjecture. And the IJ did not impermissibly interject his personal opinion by noting that\n\nHernandez-Ortega\u2019s overall credibility would determine whether the IJ accepted as true the\n\nfactual assertions in Hernandez-Ortega\u2019s testimony.\n\n       Hernandez-Ortega next argues that the BIA erred by failing to address his argument that\n\nthe IJ improperly placed on him the burden to explain why the gang members did not kill him\n\nduring the 2010 incident. This argument does not warrant relief because the BIA did not rely on\n\nthe IJ\u2019s observation that Hernandez-Ortega could not explain why the gang members did not kill\n\nhim.\n\n       Hernandez-Ortega next argues that the BIA erred by concluding that his corroborative\n\nevidence was insufficient to establish that he was entitled to withholding of removal and relief\n\nunder the CAT. Hernandez-Ortega specifically relies on photographs of his scars, letters from\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\fNo. 17-3409\nHernandez-Ortega v. Sessions\n\nhis parents and fellow church members addressing his religion and church activities, and letters\n\nand other evidence concerning the murder of alleged gang members in El Salvador whom\n\nHernandez-Ortega had invited to join his church. Hernandez-Ortega also relies on country\n\nreports and other evidence of conditions in El Salvador.\n\n       To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must show that it is more likely than\n\nnot that he would be persecuted in the country of removal due to his \u201crace, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); Pablo-\n\nSanchez v. Holder, 600 F.3d 592, 594 (6th Cir. 2010). An applicant who establishes past\n\npersecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Pablo-Sanchez, 600\n\nF.3d at 594. To qualify for relief under the CAT, the applicant must establish that it is more\n\nlikely than not that he would be tortured in the country of removal \u201cby or at the instigation of or\n\nwith the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official\n\ncapacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1); Haider v. Holder, 595 F.3d 276, 289 (6th Cir. 2010).\n\n       Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Hernandez-Ortega\u2019s\n\ncorroborative evidence was insufficient to establish his entitlement to relief. The photographs of\n\nHernandez-Ortega\u2019s scars and the letters concerning his religion and church activities did not\n\ncompel a conclusion that he had been persecuted because of his religion or that it was more\n\nlikely than not that he would be persecuted or tortured if removed to El Salvador. Notably, none\n\nof the letters suggest that the 2010 attack was connected to Hernandez-Ortega\u2019s work with the\n\nchurch. In addition, the BIA reasonably discounted the letters concerning the murder of gang\n\nmembers in El Salvador because two of the letters were strikingly similar despite allegedly being\n\nwritten by different people at different times, and because the letters did not state that the victims\n\nwere killed due to their religious activities or their relationship with Hernandez-Ortega. Finally,\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fNo. 17-3409\nHernandez-Ortega v. Sessions\n\nalthough the evidence of country conditions showed that there are problems with gangs in El\n\nSalvador, it was insufficient to compel the conclusion that it was more likely than not that\n\nHernandez-Ortega\u2019s removal would result in him being persecuted on account of a protected\n\nground or tortured \u201cby or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public\n\nofficial.\u201d See Zaldana Menijar v. Lynch, 812 F.3d 491, 501-02 (6th Cir. 2015).\n\n       Hernandez-Ortega lastly argues that his due process rights were violated when the IJ\n\nallowed the government to cross-examine him about a sworn statement that he made to a border\n\npatrol agent in 2011 without giving him an adequate opportunity to review the statement with his\n\ncounsel. Hernandez-Ortega further contends that the error undermines the adverse credibility\n\ndetermination because the determination was based in part on his testimony about the sworn\n\nstatement.\n\n       \u201cWe review de novo alleged due process violations in removal hearings.\u201d Bi Qing Zheng\n\nv. Lynch, 819 F.3d 287, 296 (6th Cir. 2016). When reviewing such claims, we must determine\n\nwhether there was a defect in the proceedings that caused prejudice to the petitioner. Id. To\n\nestablish prejudice, a petitioner must show that the defect led to a substantially different outcome\n\nfrom that which would have otherwise occurred. Id. at 297. Hernandez-Ortega has not shown\n\nthat the questioning about the sworn statement undermined the adverse credibility determination\n\nor otherwise substantially affected the outcome of his removal proceedings because the IJ and\n\nBIA gave valid reasons for the adverse credibility determination and for denying Hernandez-\n\nOrtega relief: reasons that were unrelated to his testimony concerning the sworn statement.\n\n       Accordingly, we DENY the petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\f",
