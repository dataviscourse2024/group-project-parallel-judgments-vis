The Commonwealth appeals from an order of a\n\nSuperior Court judge dismissing so much of an indictment as\n\ncharged the defendant, Brendan W. Ray, with causing serious\n\nbodily injury while operating a motor vehicle recklessly or\n\f                                                                     2\n\n\nnegligently and while under the influence of an intoxicating\n\nsubstance, G.

Concluding that\n\nthe Commonwealth failed to show that the over ten-month delay\n\nwas necessary to determine the nature of the violation, and that\n\nneither an earlier citation for negligent operation, G. L.\n\nc. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) (a), nor the nature of the accident provided the\n\ndefendant with sufficient notice that he would be charged with\n\nthis crime, we affirm.\n\n    1.      Background.   \"We adopt the Superior Court judge's\n\nfactual findings, which we do not disturb absent clear error,\n\nand supplement them with uncontroverted details from the\n\nrecord.\"    Commonwealth v. O'Leary, 480 Mass. 67, 67-68 (2018),\n\nciting Commonwealth v. Burnham, 90 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 484 n.1\n\n(2016).     At approximately 10 P.M. on January 23, 2015, an\n\naccident involving two cars occurred in the area of Bedford\n\nStreet in Whitman.     When police arrived at the scene, a blue\n\nVolvo with extensive damage was stopped at an angle on the side\n\nof the road.    The driver of the Volvo was removed from the car\n\nand transferred to a hospital by helicopter for treatment of\n\nlife-threatening injuries.     A red Jeep (allegedly operated by\n\nthe defendant) was overturned, lying on its passenger side in\n\nthe road.    The Jeep had severe damage to its front end, and its\n\nhardtop roof and rear passenger-side tire were detached.         A\n\f                                                                     3\n\n\npolice detective observed an expired inspection sticker on the\n\nJeep.   Meanwhile, the defendant was seated on railroad ties\n\nalong the edge of a driveway approximately ten to twenty feet\n\nfrom the Volvo.   The defendant told police that he had no\n\nrecollection of the accident.   The defendant was profusely\n\nbleeding from his mouth, nose, and face, and was transported to\n\nthe hospital by ambulance.\n\n     Police were unable to determine the cause of the accident\n\nright away and did not charge the defendant with a crime or\n\nissue a citation on the night of the accident.    At approximately\n\n2:13 A.M. that night, a detective went to South Shore Hospital\n\nto interview the defendant.   The defendant told the detective\n\nthat he had no memory of the accident.    He recalled that he was\n\nat a friend's house in Bridgewater before the accident but could\n\nnot remember the name of the friend.     The detective noticed \"a\n\nslight odor of alcohol coming from [the defendant]\" but did not\n\nform the opinion that he was intoxicated at that time.     The\n\ndefendant told the detective that he drank a couple of beers at\n\nhis friend's house earlier that night.\n\n     On January 30, 2015, seven days after the accident, the\n\ndetective prepared a report stating that the accident was still\n\nbeing investigated.   The detective also reported that the\n\ndefendant's vehicle, traveling northbound, crossed the center\n\nline into the southbound lane and collided with the blue Volvo.\n\f                                                                    4\n\n\n     On January 31, 2015, the defendant attempted to retrieve\n\nhis Jeep at the Whitman police station.    The detective told the\n\ndefendant that the accident was still being investigated and the\n\nJeep could not yet be released.   The detective again asked the\n\ndefendant if he remembered the accident.   This time, the\n\ndefendant recalled that the rear tire detached from the Jeep and\n\nhe lost control of the vehicle and crashed.   The detective told\n\nthe defendant that the driver of the Volvo was severely injured\n\nand remained in the hospital in a medically-induced coma.      He\n\nalso told the defendant that criminal charges could be issued as\n\na result of the accident.\n\n     In mid-March 2015, the State trooper responsible for the\n\naccident reconstruction investigation reported that \"the\n\naccident was not caused by mechanical failure\" and that the tire\n\ncame off the Jeep as a result of the accident, not prior to the\n\naccident.   On March 20, 2015, the detective issued the defendant\n\na motor vehicle citation listing charges of negligent operation\n\nof a motor vehicle, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (2) (a); a marked lanes\n\nviolation, G. L. c. 89, \u00a7 4A; and failure to have the motor\n\nvehicle inspected, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 20.   A complaint issued from\n\nthe District Court, and the defendant was arraigned on the\n\ncharges on July 15, 2015.\n\n     On December 4, 2015, the detective testified before a grand\n\njury.   The defendant's medical records were provided to the\n\f                                                                    5\n\n\ngrand jury and indicated that the defendant had a blood alcohol\n\nlevel of .17 at the time of his hospitalization and had also\n\ntested positive for marijuana.   The grand jury returned an\n\nindictment on December 7, 2015, charging the defendant with\n\ncausing serious bodily injury while operating a motor vehicle\n\nrecklessly or negligently and while under the influence of\n\nintoxicating liquor or drugs, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24L (1).   No\n\ncitation was ever issued for this charge.   The District Court\n\ncharges were dismissed in favor of the indictment.\n\n     The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for\n\nfailure to provide him with a motor vehicle citation as required\n\nby G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2.   After an evidentiary hearing in which the\n\nsole witness was the detective, the judge allowed in part the\n\ndefendant's motion to dismiss.   Concluding that the negligent\n\noperation charge listed on the initial citation was properly\n\ncited in compliance with G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2, and that it was a\n\nlesser-included offense of the indicted charge, the judge\n\npermitted the Commonwealth to proceed on the lesser charge.      See\n\nCommonwealth v. Flanagan, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 462-463 (2010)\n\n(all elements of negligent operation within greater crime under\n\nG. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24L [1]).1\n\n\n     1 The partial dismissal is properly before us pursuant to\nG. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, and Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (1), as\namended, 476 Mass. 1501 (2017). See Commonwealth v. Jensen, 459\nMass. 21, 23 (2011). As the defendant has no right of\n\f                                                                    6\n\n\n    2.   Statutory framework.   Under G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2, \"[a]\n\nfailure to give a copy of the citation to the violator at the\n\ntime and place of the [automobile law] violation shall\n\nconstitute a defense in any court proceeding for such violation,\n\nexcept [1] where the violator could not have been stopped or\n\n[2] where additional time was reasonably necessary to determine\n\nthe nature of the violation or the identity of the violator, or\n\n[3] where the court finds that a circumstance, not inconsistent\n\nwith the purpose of this section to create a uniform, simplified\n\nand non-criminal method for disposing of automobile law\n\nviolations, justifies the failure.\"   Where an exception applies,\n\nthe statute commands that \"the violation shall be recorded upon\n\na citation as soon as possible after such violation.\"     G. L.\n\nc. 90C, \u00a7 2.   It is undisputed that the defendant never received\n\na citation for the charge of causing serious bodily injury by\n\ndriving recklessly or negligently and while under the influence\n\nof intoxicating liquor or drugs, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24L (1).     The\n\nCommonwealth, therefore, had the burden to establish that one of\n\nthe three statutory exceptions applied.   See O'Leary, 480 Mass.\n\nat 70; Burnham, 90 Mass. App. Ct. at 485 (\"Where . . . the\n\ncitation was not delivered at the accident scene, the\n\n\n\ninterlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss, the\npropriety of allowing the negligent operation charge to remain\nis not before us. See Doe v. Commonwealth, 435 Mass. 1001,\n1001-1002 (2001).\n\f                                                                   7\n\n\nCommonwealth bears the burden to establish the applicability of\n\nan exception\").   \"The statute by its terms requires no showing\n\nof prejudice and . . . our courts have concluded that the\n\ndefendant need not show any actual prejudice from the delay.\"\n\nCommonwealth v. Werra, 95 Mass. App. Ct. 610, 616 (2019).2\n\n     The Commonwealth does not argue that the first exception\n\njustifies the failure to present the defendant with a citation.\n\nIndeed, the defendant was stopped at the time of the incident.\n\nAccordingly, we turn to the second and third exceptions.\n\n     3.   The second exception.   \"The second exception to the\n\nrequirements of G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2, excuses delayed delivery of a\n\ncitation where 'additional time was reasonably necessary to\n\ndetermine the nature of the violation.'\"    Burnham, 90 Mass. App.\n\nCt. at 486, quoting Commonwealth v. Pappas, 384 Mass. 428, 431\n\n(1981).   Although the citation, issued on March 20, 2015,\n\nrequired additional time for the police to complete their\n\ninvestigation, the same cannot be said for the indictment,\n\nissued over ten months after the accident, that charged the\n\ndefendant with causing serious bodily injury by driving\n\nrecklessly or negligently and while under the influence of\n\n\n     2 Although this case involves the failure to issue a\ncitation at all, rather than the delay in issuance of a\ncitation, we assume without deciding that the issuance of an\nindictment followed by service upon a defendant is the\nfunctional equivalent of a citation. See Commonwealth v.\nKenney, 55 Mass. App. Ct. 514, 519 (2002).\n\f                                                                    8\n\n\nintoxicating liquor or drugs, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24L (1).      See\n\nBurnham, supra at 487 (\"The ongoing nature of an investigation\n\nmay be a significant factor in discerning the reasonableness of\n\nany delay in issuing a citation\").\n\n    To be sure, it appears that the Commonwealth could not have\n\ncharged the defendant with causing serious bodily injury by\n\ndriving recklessly or negligently and while under the influence\n\nof intoxicating liquor or drugs until it had secured the\n\ndefendant's medical records.      Nonetheless, the Commonwealth\n\nprovided no evidence that these medical records were unavailable\n\nto the government until December 2015, other than the\n\ndetective's belief that he lacked probable cause for a search\n\nwarrant.   The Commonwealth simply failed to provide any evidence\n\nof how and when it obtained the medical records, much less\n\nevidence justifying the delay between the District Court\n\narraignment and the Superior Court grand jury presentation.       The\n\nabsence of such information provides no confidence that the\n\nadditional time was reasonably necessary.      Accordingly, the\n\nmotion judge properly found that the Commonwealth failed to show\n\na reasonable justification for any delay in issuing a citation\n\nbeyond March 2015 under the second exception.\n\n    4.     The third exception.   \"The third exception to the\n\nrequirements of G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2, is a 'safety valve,' which\n\nexcuses delayed delivery of a citation where 'the court finds\n\f                                                                    9\n\n\nthat a circumstance, not inconsistent with the purpose of this\n\nsection to create a uniform, simplified and non-criminal method\n\nfor disposing of automobile law violations, justifies the\n\nfailure.'\"   Burnham, 90 Mass. App. Ct. at 488, quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Riley, 41 Mass. App. Ct. 234, 236 (1996).     We\n\ndetermine the applicability of this exception with reference to\n\nthe dual purposes of G. L. c. 90C, \u00a7 2:   \"to prevent\n\n'manipulation or misuse of the citation process because of any\n\nunnecessary or unreasonable delay,'\" O'Leary, 480 Mass. at 71,\n\nquoting Commonwealth v. Cameron, 416 Mass. 314, 316 n.2 (1993),\n\nand \"to afford prompt and definite notice of the nature of the\n\nalleged violation to the putative violator.\"   O'Leary, supra,\n\nquoting Pappas, 384 Mass. at 431.\n\n    We recognize that, in the face of a serious accident, the\n\nfailure to comply strictly with the requirements of G. L.\n\nc. 90C, \u00a7 2, may not be fatal to the Commonwealth's case.     See\n\nBurnham, 90 Mass. App. Ct. at 488-489.    In such cases, implicit\n\nor explicit notice is \"sufficient because the circumstances\n\ninvolved serious injuries to third parties, an arrest of the\n\ndefendant, more serious charges requiring obvious investigation\n\nsuch as motor vehicle homicide or leaving the scene after\n\ncausing personal injury, verbal notice from law enforcement that\n\na citation would be forthcoming, actions or statements by a\n\ndefendant evincing awareness of criminal conduct, or a\n\f                                                                      10\n\n\ncombination of these factors.\"   Id. at 489.    See Commonwealth v.\n\nMoulton, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 682, 685 (2002) (seriousness of\n\naccident combined with officer's warning to defendant that\n\ncitation would be issued was sufficient to provide defendant\n\nwith implicit notice of violation); Commonwealth v. Kenney, 55\n\nMass. App. Ct. 514, 519-520 (2002) (seriousness of hit and run\n\naccident put defendant on notice of criminal charges despite no\n\ncitation being issued); Commonwealth v. Barbuto, 22 Mass. App\n\nCt. 941, 943 (1986) (seriousness of hit and run accident, among\n\nother things, justified delay in issuing citation).     Indeed,\n\n\"there is no bright-line rule to ascertain whether a particular\n\ndelay in issuing a citation is justified.      Rather, '[e]ach case\n\nmuch be decided on its own peculiar facts.'\"     Burnham, supra at\n\n485, quoting Commonwealth v. Provost, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 479, 484\n\n(1981).\n\n    Under the circumstances of this case, the defendant had\n\nneither explicit nor implicit notice of the violation at issue.\n\nOur analysis is guided by our decision in Burnham.     There,\n\nfollowing a single-car accident, the police promptly issued the\n\ndefendant a citation for operating after the suspension of his\n\ndriver's license and a marked lanes violation.     Burnham, 90\n\nMass. App. Ct. at 484.   More than four months after the first\n\ncitation was issued, following the defendant's arrest for an\n\nunrelated incident, the prosecutor reopened the initial\n\f                                                                   11\n\n\ninvestigation and, based on the defendant's medical records from\n\nthe night of the accident, instructed the investigating officer\n\nto issue the defendant another citation for operating under the\n\ninfluence of intoxicating liquor.   Id. at 484-485.   We concluded\n\nthat the circumstances of the case did not justify delayed\n\ndelivery of a citation under the third exception because the\n\ndefendant was not on notice that more serious criminal charges\n\nwere forthcoming.   Id. at 490.\n\n    The same is true here.    The defendant no doubt had notice\n\nof the possibility of criminal charges arising from the\n\naccident.   Indeed, the detective personally told the defendant\n\nin January 2015 that he could be criminally charged for the\n\naccident.   Nothing, however, provided the defendant with notice\n\nthat he should have expected to be charged with more serious\n\nviolations than those charged in the March 2015 citation:\n\nnegligent operation, a marked lanes violation, and failure to\n\nhave the motor vehicle inspected.   The issuance of a citation\n\nfor an infraction or a minor criminal charge does not by itself\n\nprovide implicit notice of a more serious charge.     See Werra, 95\n\nMass. App. Ct. at 616, quoting Burnham, 90 Mass. App. Ct. at 490\n\n(dismissal warranted where \"the defendant did not have prompt\n\nand definite notice of the offense for which he was charged\").\n\nIndeed, the citation issued to the defendant, followed by months\n\nof inaction, was more likely to lead the defendant to believe\n\f                                                                   12\n\n\nthat no more criminal charges were forthcoming.     Moreover,\n\nunlike many cases in which we have applied the third exception,\n\nthe defendant received no oral notice that the new charge was\n\nforthcoming.    See, e.g., Moulton, 56 Mass. App. Ct. at 683.\n\n    Despite the serious injuries resulting from the accident,\n\nthis is not a case in which those injuries \"put the defendant on\n\nnotice of the potential charges against him and created an\n\nineradicable record of the event.\"   Kenney, 55 Mass. App. Ct. at\n\n520, quoting Commonwealth v. Carapellucci, 429 Mass. 579, 581\n\n(1999).   The accident at issue here, \"although not a mere\n\nfleeting traffic incident, was not so serious standing alone to\n\nconfer implicit notice on the defendant pursuant to the third\n\nexception.\"    Burnham, 90 Mass. App. Ct. at 490.   Cases where\n\nnotice was sufficient have generally involved the analysis of\n\nmany factors, including but not limited to the seriousness of\n\nthe injuries.   For example, in Kenney, we concluded that it was\n\n\"inconceivable that the defendant would be unaware of the\n\nseriousness of [the] situation,\" and, therefore, dismissal of\n\nthe defendant's indictments was not warranted.      Kenney, supra at\n\n519, quoting Pappas, 384 Mass. at 431-432.    There, the defendant\n\nstruck a pedestrian with her car and immediately fled the scene\n\nof the crime.   Kenney, supra at 515.\n\n    Here, there is no indication that the defendant had any\n\nreason to believe a second charge would be issued more than ten\n\f                                                                  13\n\n\nmonths after the accident and more than eight months after the\n\ninitial citation was issued.   To the contrary, the defendant\n\nreported that he did not remember the accident.   The defendant\n\ndid not flee the scene or express any fear of further\n\nprosecution.   Moreover, it appears that the investigating\n\ndetective himself thought that the cited charges would be the\n\nextent of the defendant's criminal exposure.   We cannot conclude\n\nthat the defendant would be able to predict the issuance of a\n\nnew charge, months later, where there is no evidence that the\n\nexperienced law enforcement professional predicted this outcome.\n\nNeither the citation nor the seriousness of the accident\n\nprovided the defendant with implicit notice that a more serious\n\ncharge would be forthcoming.   Accordingly, the motion judge\n\nproperly allowed in part the motion to dismiss.   The order dated\n\nOctober 31, 2016, is affirmed.\n\n                                    So ordered.\n\f",
