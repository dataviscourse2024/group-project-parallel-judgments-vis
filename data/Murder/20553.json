Alcala, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\nO R D E R\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPursuant to the provisions of Article 11.07 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the\r\nclerk of the trial court transmitted to this Court this application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Ex parte\r\nYoung, 418 S.W.2d 824, 826 (Tex. Crim. App. 1967).  Applicant was convicted of murder and\r\nsentenced to seventy-five years' imprisonment.  The Fourteenth Court of Appeals affirmed his\r\nconviction.  Walker v. State, No. 14-01-01197-CR (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2003, pet.\r\nref'd).\r\n\r\n\tIn a single ground in an amended application, Applicant contends that trial counsel failed to\r\nobject to the admission of extraneous offense evidence at punishment.  He contends that the State\r\nfailed to provide pretrial notice or else provided inadequate pretrial notice of its intent to introduce\r\nextraneous offense evidence.  The trial court adopted Applicant's proposed findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law and recommended that we grant Applicant a new punishment hearing.  Based on\r\nour own independent review of the record, we find that the State's notice was sufficient and that the\r\ntrial court would not have erred in overruling counsel's objection.  Relief is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nFiled: April 17, 2013\r\n\r\nDo not publish\r\n\r\n\r\n",
