RAMSAY, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n               This is an appeal from a judgment of conviction for intoxication manslaughter and\n\naggravated assault. Sentence was imposed on May 2, 2001. The deadline for filing a motion for new\n\ntrial was therefore June 1, 2001. Tex. R. App. P. 21.4(a). The motion for new trial was filed June\n\n4, 2001. Because the motion for new trial was not timely, the notice of appeal filed July 26, 2001,\n\nalso was not timely. Tex. R. App. P. 26.2(a). Under the circumstances, we lack jurisdiction to\n\ndispose of the purported appeal in any manner other than by dismissing it for want of jurisdiction.\n\nSlaton v. State, 981 S.W.2d 208 (Tex. Crim. App.1998); Olivo v. State, 918 S.W.2d 519, 522-23\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1996).\n\f              The appeal is dismissed.\n\n\n\nBefore Chief Justice Aboussie, Justices B. A. Smith and Puryear\n\nDismissed for Want of Jurisdiction\n\nFiled: September 13, 2001\n\nDo Not Publish\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f",
