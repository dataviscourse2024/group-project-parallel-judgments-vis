See W. Va. R. App. P. 21.\n\n        In 2017, the State indicted petitioner in the Circuit Court of Nicholas County on a single\ncount of first-degree murder. On August 14, 2019, during the second day of trial, the parties\nreached a plea agreement, pursuant to which petitioner pled no contest to second-degree murder.\nPetitioner also waived the preparation of a presentence investigation report. Accordingly, on that\nsame date, the circuit court found that \u201cthere is no reason not to proceed to sentencing.\u201d The circuit\ncourt sentenced petitioner to a determinate term of forty years of incarceration and remanded him\ninto custody \u201cfor the execution of the sentence.\u201d 2 The circuit court later memorialized petitioner\u2019s\nsentence in a sentencing order entered on September 16, 2019, giving him 982 days of credit for\ntime served.\n\n\n       1\n        Petitioner is self-represented. The State of West Virginia appears by counsel Attorney\nGeneral Patrick Morrisey and Assistant Attorney General Lara K. Bissett.\n       2\n        West Virginia Code \u00a7 61-2-3 provides, in pertinent part, that second-degree murder \u201cshall\nbe punished by a definite term of imprisonment in the penitentiary which is not less than ten nor\nmore than forty years.\u201d\n\n                                                  1\n\f        On January 8, 2020, petitioner filed a motion seeking to reduce his sentence, pursuant to\nRule 35(b) of the West Virginia Rules of Criminal Procedure, 3 arguing that the circumstances of\nhis case warranted a reduction of his forty-year sentence. The circuit court, by order entered on\nJune 29, 2021, denied petitioner\u2019s motion finding that \u201cthe sentence is appropriate due to the\nseriousness of the crime committed by [petitioner].\u201d 4 It is from this order petitioner appeals.\n\n       This Court has previously held as follows:\n\n                \u201cIn reviewing the findings of fact and conclusions of law of a circuit court\n       concerning an order on a motion made under Rule 35 of the West Virginia Rules\n       of Criminal Procedure, we apply a three-pronged standard of review. We review\n       the decision on the Rule 35 motion under an abuse of discretion standard; the\n       underlying facts are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard; and questions of\n       law and interpretations of statutes and rules are subject to a de novo review.\u201d Syl.\n       Pt. 1, State v. Head, 198 W. Va. 298, 480 S.E.2d 507 (1996).\n\nSyl. Pt. 1, State v. Marcum, 238 W. Va. 26, 792 S.E.2d 37 (2016).\n\n       On appeal, we need not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute as to whether the circuit court erred in\ndenying petitioner\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion on its merits. \u201cThis Court may, on appeal, affirm the\njudgment of the lower court when it appears that such judgment is correct on any legal ground\ndisclosed by the record, regardless of the ground, reason or theory assigned by the lower court as\nthe basis for its judgment.\u201d Syl. Pt. 4, White v. Haines, 215 W. Va. 698, 601 S.E.2d 18 (2004)\n(quoting Syl. Pt. 3, Barnett v. Wolfolk, 149 W. Va. 246, 140 S.E.2d 466 (1965)).\n\n       We recently held:\n\n              \u201cA circuit court does not have jurisdiction to rule upon the merits of a\n       motion for reduction of a sentence under Rule 35(b) of the West Virginia Rules of\n       Criminal Procedure when the motion is filed outside the 120-day filing period set\n       out under that rule.\u201d Syllabus point 2, State ex rel. State v. Sims, 239 W. Va. 764,\n       806 S.E.2d 420 (2017).\n\n       3\n        While petitioner titled his motion as seeking reconsideration of his sentence, Rule 35(b)\nof the West Virginia Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in pertinent part:\n\n       Reduction of Sentence. \u2014 A motion to reduce a sentence may be made, or the court\n       may reduce a sentence without motion within 120 days after the sentence is\n       imposed or probation is revoked . . . . The court shall determine the motion within\n       a reasonable time. Changing a sentence from a sentence of incarceration to a grant\n       of probation shall constitute a permissible reduction of sentence under this\n       subdivision.\n       4\n        In addition to denying petitioner\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence, the circuit court also\ndenied two other motions filed by petitioner. Petitioner does not challenge these denials on appeal.\n                                                 2\n\f               A sentence is \u201cimposed\u201d for purposes of Rule 35(b) of the West Virginia\n       Rules of Criminal Procedure when the sentence is verbally pronounced at the\n       sentencing hearing. Accordingly, a motion to reduce a sentence under Rule 35(b)\n       is timely when it is filed within 120 days after the sentence is pronounced at a\n       sentencing hearing.\n\nSyl. Pts. 3 and 4, State v. Keefer, No. 21-0490, ___ W. Va. ___, 880 S.E.2d 106 (Nov. 4, 2022). 5\n\n        The circuit court pronounced petitioner\u2019s sentence at the August 14, 2019, sentencing\nhearing. Petitioner filed his motion for reduction of sentence on January 8, 2020, which was 147\ndays after the pronouncement of his sentence. 6 Therefore, as petitioner failed to file his motion\nwithin the 120-day time frame set forth in Rule 35(b), the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to\nentertain the motion.\n\n         Even if the motion were timely filed, based upon our review of the record, we find that the\ncircuit court did not abuse its discretion in not holding a hearing on petitioner\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion.\nSee State v. King, 205 W. Va. 422, 425, 518 S.E.2d 663, 666 (1999). We further find that the circuit\ncourt\u2019s finding, that petitioner\u2019s forty-year sentence was appropriate due to the seriousness of his\ncrime, was sufficient to support the denial of the Rule 35(b) motion as it is clear from the record\nthat petitioner fails to cite any event that occurred after sentencing that would warrant a reduction\nin his sentence. 7 Marcum, 238 W. Va. at 32, 792 S.E.2d at 43; see State v. Redman, 213 W. Va.\n175, 180, 578 S.E.2d 369, 374 (2003) (rejecting that the argument that there were insufficient\nfindings to permit meaningful appellate review of the denial of a Rule 35(b) motion).\nAccordingly, we conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s\n\n       5\n        As we noted in State v. Keefer, No. 21-0490, ___ W. Va. ___, 880 S.E.2d 106 (Nov. 4,\n2022), \u201c[g]enerally, an order is effective when a court announces it.\u201d Slip Op., at 8 (quoting Syl.\nPt. 1, Moats v. Preston Cnty. Comm\u2019n, 206 W. Va. 8, 521 S.E.2d 180 (1999)). Moreover, \u201c[a]n\noral order has the same force, effect, and validity in the law as a written order. In other words, the\nactual physical possession of a written order is not required to effectuate said order.\u201d Id., at 9\n(quoting Syl. Pt. 2, Moats, 206 W. Va. at 10, 521 S.E.2d at 182).\n       6\n        \u201cOnce the triggering event is established, Rule 45(a) of the West Virginia Rules of\nCriminal Procedure governs computation of the time frame.\u201d State v. Keefer, No. 21-0490, ___ W.\nVa. ___, ___ n.2, 880 S.E.2d 106, ___ n.2 (Nov. 4, 2022).\n       7\n           In Syllabus Point 5 of Head, we held:\n\n               When considering [Rule] 35(b) motions, circuit courts generally should\n       consider only those events that occur within the 120-day filing period; however, as\n       long as the circuit court does not usurp the role of the parole board, it may consider\n       matters beyond the filing period when such consideration serves the ends of justice.\n\n198 W. Va. at 299, 480 S.E.2d at 508.\n\n                                                   3\n\fRule 35(b) motion for reduction of sentence.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n\n                                                                                    Affirmed.\n\nISSUED: February 14, 2023\n\n\nCONCURRED IN BY:\n\nChief Justice Elizabeth D. Walker\nJustice Tim Armstead\nJustice John A. Hutchison\nJustice C. Haley Bunn\n\nDISSENTING:\n\nJustice William R. Wooton\n\nWooton, Justice, dissenting:\n\n       I respectfully dissent, as I believe that State v. Keefer, __ W. Va. __, 880 S.E.2d 106\n(2022), the precedent upon which the majority relies, was wrongly decided insofar as it\nannounced a new rule of law \u2013 one which disadvantaged a criminal defendant by reducing\nthe time within which a motion can be filed pursuant to Rule 35(b) of the West Virginia\nRules of Criminal Procedure \u2013 and applied it retroactively to the defendant/petitioner in\nthat case. 1 As I noted in my concurring and dissenting opinion,\n\n               it was both unnecessary and imprudent to issue a new point of\n               law to dispose of this matter without the benefit of oral\n               argument. Because Rule 35 is a court rule, clarifications or\n               changes of the rules which threaten to have widespread effect\n               are best undertaken through rule amendment after an\n               appropriate period of public comment. At a minimum, the\n               majority\u2019s new point of law should have expressly been made\n               to operate prospectively only, lest countless defendants be\n\n       1\n        I concurred in the Court\u2019s judgment in Keefer because under the particular facts\nand circumstances of that case, the petitioner had actual notice that the 120-day time\nlimitation for filing his Rule 35(b) motion would begin to run on January 12, 2021. Keefer,\n__ W. Va. at __, 880 S.E.2d at 113 (Wooton, J., concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part).\n\n                                                   4\n\f              unfairly disadvantaged.\n\nKeefer, __ W. Va. at __, 880 S.E.2d at 113 (Wooton, J., concurring, in part, and dissenting,\nin part) (emphasis added).\n\n        Our precedents counsel that a new principle of law cannot be applied retroactively\nif such application \u201cwould retard its operation . . . [and] would produce inequitable results.\u201d\nSyl. Pt. 5, in part, State v. Blake, 197 W. Va. 700, 478 S.E.2d 550 (1996). In the instant\ncase, it cannot be gainsaid that retroactive application of Keefer, a decision which was\nissued some five months after the circuit court denied relief in the instant case, is\ninequitable. At the time petitioner filed his Rule 35(b) motion, when the pendency of the\nKeefer opinion was not on anyone\u2019s radar as it had never been set for oral argument,\npetitioner had every reason to believe that his motion, filed within 120 days of entry of the\ncircuit court\u2019s sentencing order, was timely.\n\n        In retroactively applying a non-constitutional rule of criminal procedure which\ndisadvantages a criminal defendant, 2 this Court has placed itself outside well-established\njurisprudence in both state and federal courts. \u201c[C]ourts that use case-specific\n[retroactivity] analysis almost never find a newly declared state rule of criminal procedure\nto be sufficiently important to the fact-finding process as to merit retroactive application to\ncriminal cases on direct review.\u201d Andrew I. Haddad, Cruel Timing: Retroactive\nApplication of State Criminal Procedural Rules to Direct Appeals, 116 Colum. L. Rev.\n1259, 1261 (2016) (emphasis added). Further, both in Keefer and in the instant case, the\nmajority appears wholly indifferent to the serious ex post facto concerns raised by its\nretroactive application of a new rule \u201c\u2018which in relation to the offense or its consequences,\nalters the situation of a party to his disadvantage.\u2019\u201d State v. R.H., 166 W. Va. 280, 289, 273\nS.E.2d 578, 584 (1980) (citation omitted), overruled on other grounds by State ex rel. Cook\nv. Helms, 170 W. Va. 200, 292 S.E.2d 610 (1981). Finally, the result in this case is\nparticularly unfair in that the circuit court decided petitioner\u2019s Rule 35 motion on the\nmerits. Nonetheless, the majority resolved the case on the basis of a brand-new procedural\nrule that the parties never had the opportunity to argue, since the rule didn\u2019t yet exist at the\ntime this appeal was perfected.\n\n       In my view, the Court\u2019s decision today is, at best, manifestly unfair to the petitioner,\nand at worst, violative of article III, section 4 of the West Virginia Constitution. For these\nreasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n       There can be no serious argument that shortening the time limit within which a\n       2\n\ncriminal defendant can seek any form of post-trial relief is not a disadvantage.\n                                               5\n\f",
