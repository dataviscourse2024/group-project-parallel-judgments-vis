Colbath, Judge; L.T. Case No. 2016CF009732.\n\n   Carey Haughwout, Public Defender, and Christine C. Geraghty,\nAssistant Public Defender, West Palm Beach, for appellant.\n\n   Ashley Moody, Attorney General, Tallahassee, and Marc B. Hernandez,\nAssistant Attorney General, West Palm Beach, for appellee.\n\nGERBER, J.\n\n   The defendant appeals from his convictions and sentences for second\ndegree murder with a weapon (as a lesser included offense of first degree\nmurder with a weapon) and robbery with a weapon as charged. The\ndefendant raises five arguments: (1) the state did not present sufficient\nevidence to support his second degree murder with a weapon conviction;\n(2) the state shifted the burden of proof on the independent act\ninstruction\u2019s elements to the defendant, and the trial court\u2019s curative\ninstruction was insufficient; (3) the trial court fundamentally erred during\nsentencing by considering first degree felony murder elements after the\njury did not find him guilty of that crime; (4) the trial court erred by\nsentencing him above the statutory maximum for robbery with a weapon;\nand (5) the trial court\u2019s judgment contains scrivener\u2019s errors for both\nconvictions.\n\n   We affirm on the first three arguments, reverse and remand for\nsentence correction on the fourth argument. and remand to correct the\nscrivener\u2019s errors on the fifth argument. We address each argument in\nturn.\n\f   On the first argument, we conclude, without further discussion, that\nsufficient evidence supported the defendant\u2019s second degree murder with\na weapon conviction.\n\n    On the second argument, a brief portion of the state\u2019s rebuttal\nargument was stated in the passive voice \u2013 \u201cSo this is not an independent\nact, it doesn\u2019t apply in this case. And again, look at all those acts, it\nrequires all three elements to be proven and they just weren\u2019t.\u201d (emphasis\nadded). We agree this statement could have been misinterpreted as\nshifting the burden of proof on the independent act instruction\u2019s elements\nto the defendant. However, we conclude the trial court\u2019s immediate\ncurative instruction, reminding the jury that the defendant did not have\nto prove anything, sufficiently cured any misinterpretation. See Boggess\nv. State, 269 So. 3d 616, 621 (Fla. 4th DCA 2019) (\u201c[A]n immediate curative\ninstruction on the burden of proof may be sufficient to clarify an issue at\nbar and remove any confusion.\u201d); Asencio v. State, 244 So. 3d 294, 299\n(Fla. 4th DCA 2018) (\u201c[A]bsent a finding to the contrary, juries are\npresumed to follow the instructions given them.\u201d) (citation omitted). The\ndefendant did not object to the curative instruction\u2019s sufficiency, and\ntherefore did not preserve his argument on appeal that the trial court could\nhave improved the curative instruction by expressly informing the jury\nthat the state had the burden to disprove the independent act instruction\u2019s\nelements.\n\n   On the third argument, we conclude, without further discussion, that\nthe trial court\u2019s statements during sentencing did not indicate the trial\ncourt had considered first degree felony murder elements when sentencing\nthe defendant for second degree murder with a weapon.\n\n   On the fourth argument, the defendant\u2019s Florida Rule of Criminal\nProcedure 3.800(b)(2) motion to correct sentencing error argued the\nstatutory maximum for robbery with a weapon is thirty years in prison,\nbut the trial court had incorrectly sentenced the defendant to thirty-two\nyears in prison on that conviction. The trial court did not rule on the\ndefendant\u2019s motion to correct sentencing error, so the motion was deemed\ndenied. The state now concedes the trial court erred by sentencing the\ndefendant above the statutory maximum for that conviction.\n\n   We agree with the state\u2019s concession of error. \u201cA sentence can exceed\nthe statutory maximum, but only if the lowest permissible sentence under\nthe sentencing code exceeds the statutory maximum.\u201d Flewellen v. State,\n98 So. 3d 210, 211 (Fla. 4th DCA 2012) (citation omitted). Here, the\ndefendant\u2019s lowest permissible sentence was 23.95 years, which did not\n\n                                     2\n\fexceed the thirty-year statutory maximum for robbery with a firearm. See\n\u00a7\u00a7 812.13(2)(b), 775.082(3)(b), Fla. Stat. (2016). Thus, we reverse the\nsentence on that conviction (count II) and, as the defendant has requested,\nremand for the trial court to impose a thirty-year sentence on that\nconviction, to run concurrently with the thirty-two year sentence on the\nsecond degree murder with a weapon conviction (count I). The defendant\nneed not be present for this ministerial correction.\n\n    On the fifth argument, the defendant\u2019s rule 3.800(b)(2) motion also\nargued the trial court\u2019s judgment misidentified the statute citation for\nsecond degree murder with a weapon, and misidentified robbery with a\nweapon as a punishable by life (\u201cPBL\u201d) felony when it is a first degree\nfelony. Again, the trial court did not rule on the defendant\u2019s motion to\ncorrect sentencing error, so the motion was deemed denied. The state now\nconcedes those scrivener\u2019s errors in the judgment require correction.\n\n    We agree with the concession of error. On count I, the defendant was\nconvicted of second degree murder with a weapon under section 782.04(2),\nFlorida Statutes (2016), not section 782.04(1)(a)1. and 2. as indicated in\nthe judgment (and corresponding to first degree premeditated murder and\nfelony murder). On count II, the defendant was convicted of robbery with\na weapon under section 812.13(2)(b), Florida Statutes (2016), as a first\ndegree felony punishable by a thirty-year maximum sentence, not as a first\ndegree felony \u201cPBL.\u201d We remand for the trial court to correct the\nscrivener\u2019s errors in the judgment accordingly.\n\n   Based on the foregoing, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions for\nsecond degree murder with a weapon and robbery with a weapon, affirm\nthe defendant\u2019s sentence for murder with a weapon, reverse and remand\nfor correction of the defendant\u2019s sentence for robbery with a firearm, and\nremand for correction of the scrivener\u2019s errors in the judgment.\n\n   Affirmed in part, reversed in part, remanded for sentence corrections.\n\nGROSS and FORST, JJ., concur.\n\n                           *         *        *\n\n   Not final until disposition of timely filed motion for rehearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                     3\n\f",
