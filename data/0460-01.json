        "text": "Justice Kagan\ndelivered the opinion of the Court.\nThe two 14-year-old offenders in these cases were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In neither case did the sentencing authority have any discretion to impose a different punishment. State law mandated that each juvenile die in prison even if a judge or jury would have thought that his youth and its attendant characteristics, along with the nature of his crime, made a lesser sentence (for example, life with the possibility of parole) more appropriate. Such a scheme prevents those meting out punishment from considering a juvenile\u2019s \u201clessened culpability\u201d and greater \u201ccapacity for change,\u201d Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. 48, 68, 74 (2010), and runs afoul of our cases\u2019 requirement of individualized sentencing for defendants facing the most serious penalties. We therefore hold that mandatory life without parole for those under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d\nI\nA\nIn November 1999, petitioner Kuntrell Jackson, then 14 years old, and two other boys decided to rob a video store. En route to the store, Jackson learned that one of the boys, Derrick Shields, was carrying a sawed-off shotgun in his coat sleeve. Jackson decided to stay outside when the two other boys entered the store. Inside, Shields pointed the gun at the store clerk, Laurie Troup, and demanded that she \u201cgive up the money.\u201d Jackson v. State, 359 Ark. 87, 89, 194 S. W. 3d 757, 759 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Troup refused. A few moments later, Jackson went into the store to find Shields continuing to demand money. At trial, the parties disputed whether Jackson warned Troup that \u201c[w]e ain\u2019t playin\u2019,\u201d or instead told his friends, \u201cI thought you all was playin\u2019.\u201d Id., at 91, 194 S. W. 3d, at 760 (internal quotation marks omitted). When Troup threatened to call the police, Shields shot and killed her. The three boys fled emptyhanded. See id., at 89-92, 194 S. W. 3d, at 758-760.\nArkansas law gives prosecutors discretion to charge 14-year-olds as adults when they are alleged to have committed certain serious offenses. See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 9-27-318(e) (1998). The prosecutor here exercised that authority by charging Jackson with capital felony murder and aggravated robbery. Jackson moved to transfer the case to juvenile court, but after considering the alleged facts of the crime, a psychiatrist's examination, and Jackson\u2019s juvenile arrest history (shoplifting and several incidents of car theft), the trial court denied the motion, and an appellate court affirmed. See Jackson v. State, No. 02-535, 2003 WL 193412, *1 (Ark. App., Jan. 29, 2003); \u00a7\u00a7 9-27-318(d), (e). A jury later convicted Jackson of both crimes. Noting that \u201cin view of [the] verdict, there's only one possible punishment,\u201d the judge sentenced Jackson to life without parole. App. in No. 10-9647, p. 55 (hereinafter Jackson App.); see Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-4-104(b) (1997) (\u201cA defendant convicted of capital murder or treason shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without parole\u201d). Jackson did not challenge the sentence on appeal, and the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the convictions. See 359 Ark. 87, 194 S. W. 3d 757.\nFollowing Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), in which this Court invalidated the death penalty for all juvenile offenders under the age of 18, Jackson filed a state petition for habeas corpus. He argued, based on Roper\u2019s reasoning, that a mandatory sentence of life without parole for a 14-year-old also violates the Eighth Amendment. The circuit court rejected that argument and granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss. See Jackson App. 72-76. While that ruling was on appeal, this Court held in Graham v. Florida that life without parole violates the Eighth Amendment when imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders. After the parties filed briefs addressing that decision, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of Jackson\u2019s petition. See Jackson v. Norris, 2011 Ark. 49, 378 S. W. 3d 103. The majority found that Roper and Graham were \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to their contexts: \u201cdeath-penalty eases involving a juvenile and life-imprisonment-without-parole cases for non-homicide offenses involving a juvenile.\u201d 2011 Ark., at 5, 378 S. W. 3d, at 106. Two justices dissented. They noted that Jackson was not the shooter and that \u201cany evidence of intent to kill was severely lacking.\u201d Id., at 10, 378 S. W. 3d, at 109 (Danielson, J., dissenting). And they argued that Jackson\u2019s mandatory sentence ran afoul of Graham1 s admonition that \u201c \u2018[a]n offender\u2019s age is relevant to the Eighth Amendment, and criminal procedure laws that fail to take defendants\u2019 youthfulness into account at all would be flawed.\u2019\u201d 2011 Ark., at 10-11, 378 S. W. 3d, at 109 (quoting Graham, 560 U. S., at 76).\nB\nLike Jackson, petitioner Evan Miller was 14 years old at the time of his crime. Miller had by then been in and out of foster care because his mother suffered from alcoholism and drug addiction and his stepfather abused him. Miller, too, regularly used drugs and alcohol; and he had attempted suicide four times, the first when he was six years old. See E. J. M. v. State, 928 So. 2d 1077, 1081 (Ala. Crim. App. 2004) (Cobb, J., concurring in result); App. in No. 10-9646, pp. 26-28 (hereinafter Miller App.).\nOne night in 2003, Miller was at home with a friend, Colby Smith, when a neighbor, Cole Cannon, came to make a drug deal with Miller\u2019s mother. See 6 Record in No. 10-9646, p. 1004. The two boys followed Cannon back to his trailer, where all three smoked marijuana and played drinking games. When Cannon passed out, Miller stole his wallet, splitting about $300 with Smith. Miller then tried to put the wallet back in Cannon\u2019s pocket, but Cannon awoke and grabbed Miller by the throat. Smith hit Cannon with a nearby baseball bat, and once released, Miller grabbed the bat and repeatedly struck Cannon with it. Miller placed a sheet over Cannon\u2019s head, told him \u201c T am God, I\u2019ve come to take your life,\u2019\u201d and delivered one more blow. 63 So. 3d 676, 689 (Ala. Crim. App. 2010). The boys then retreated to Miller\u2019s trailer, but soon decided to return to Cannon\u2019s to cover up evidence of their crime. Once there, they lit two fires. Cannon eventually died from his injuries and smoke inhalation. See id., at 683-685, 689.\nAlabama law required that Miller initially be charged as a juvenile, but allowed the District Attorney to seek removal of the case to adult court. See Ala. Code \u00a7 12-15-34 (1977). The D. A. did so, and the juvenile court agreed to the transfer after a hearing. Citing the nature of the crime, Miller\u2019s \u201cmental maturity,\u201d and his prior juvenile offenses (truancy and \u201ccriminal mischief\u201d), the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. E. J. M. v. State, No. CR-03-0915, pp. 5-7 (Aug. 27, 2004) (unpublished memorandum). The State accordingly charged Miller as an adult with murder in the course of arson. That crime (like capital murder in Arkansas) carries a mandatory minimum punishment of life without parole. See Ala. Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(9), 13A-6-2(c) (1982).\nRelying in significant part on testimony from Smith, who had pleaded to a lesser offense, a jury found Miller guilty. He was therefore sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, ruling that life without parole was \u201cnot overly harsh when compared to the crime\u201d and that the mandatory nature of the sentencing scheme was permissible under the Eighth Amendment. 63 So. 3d, at 690; see id., at 686-691. The Alabama Supreme Court denied review.\nWe granted certiorari in both cases, see 565 U. S. 1013 (2011), and now reverse.\nII\nThe Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment \u201cguarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to excessive sanctions.\u201d Roper, 543 U. S., at 560. That right, we have explained, \u201cflows from the basic \u2018precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned\u2019\u201d to both the offender and the offense. Ibid. (quoting Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 367 (1910)). As we noted the last time we considered life-without-parole sentences imposed on juveniles, \u201c[t]he concept of proportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment.\u201d Graham, 560 U. S., at 59. And we view that concept less through a historical prism than according to \u201c \u2018the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u2019\u201d Est elle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).\nThe eases before us implicate two strands of precedent reflecting our concern with proportionate punishment. The first has adopted categorical bans on sentencing practices based on mismatches between the culpability of a class of offenders and the severity of a penalty. See Graham, 560 U. S., at 60-61 (listing cases). So, for example, we have held that imposing the death penalty for nonhomicide crimes against individuals, or imposing it on mentally retarded defendants, violates the Eighth Amendment. See Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407 (2008); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002). Several of the cases in this group have specially focused on juvenile offenders, because of their lesser culpability. Thus, Roper held that the Eighth Amendment bars capital punishment for children, and Graham concluded that the Amendment also prohibits a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for a child who committed a nonhomicide offense. Graham further likened life without parole for juveniles to the death penalty itself, thereby evoking a second line of our precedents. In those cases, we have prohibited mandatory imposition of capital punishment, requiring that sentencing authorities consider the characteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before sentencing him to death. See Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280 (1976) (plurality opinion); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978). Here, the confluence of these two lines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles violate the Eighth Amendment.\nTo start with the first set of cases: Roper and Graham establish that children are constitutionally different from adults for purposes of sentencing. Because juveniles have diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform, we explained, \u201cthey are less deserving of the most severe punishments.\u201d Graham, 560 U. S., at 68. Those cases relied on three significant gaps between juveniles and adults. First, children have a \u201c'lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,\u2019 \u201d leading to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking. Roper, 543 U. S., at 569. Second, children \u201care more vulnerable ... to negative influences and outside pressures,\u201d including from their family and peers; they have limited \u201ccontro[l] over their own environment\u201d and lack the ability to extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing settings. Ibid. And third, a child\u2019s character is not as \u201cwell formed\u201d as an adult\u2019s; his traits are \u201cless fixed\u201d and his actions less likely to be \u201cevidence of irretrievable] deprav[ity].\u201d Id., at 570.\nOur decisions rested not only on common sense\u2014on what \u201cany parent knows\u201d\u2014but on science and social science as well. Id., at 569. In Roper, we cited studies showing that \u201c'[o]nly a relatively small proportion of adolescents\u2019\u201d who engage in illegal activity \u201c\u2018develop entrenched patterns of problem behavior.\u2019\u201d Id., at 570 (quoting Steinberg & Scott, Less Guilty by Reason of Adolescence: Developmental Immaturity, Diminished Responsibility, and the Juvenile Death Penalty, 58 Am. Psychologist 1009, 1014 (2003)). And in Graham, we noted that \u201cdevelopments in psychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds\u201d\u2014for example, in \u201cparts of the brain involved in behavior control.\u201d 560 U. S., at 68. We reasoned that those findings\u2014of transient rashness, proclivity for risk, and inability to assess consequences\u2014both lessened a child\u2019s \u201cmoral culpability\u201d and enhanced the prospect that, as the years go by and neurological development occurs, his \u201c\u2018deficiencies will be reformed.\u2019\u201d Ibid, (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 570).\nRoper and Graham emphasized that the distinctive attributes of youth diminish the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they commit terrible crimes. Because \u201c \u2018[t]he heart of the retribution rationale\u2019 \u201d relates to an offender\u2019s blameworthiness, \u201c\u2018the case for retribution is not as strong with a minor as with an adult.\u2019 \u201d Graham, 560 U. S., at 71 (quoting Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137, 149 (1987); Roper, 543 U. S., at 571). Nor can deterrence do the work in this context, because \u201c \u2018the same characteristics that render juveniles less culpable than adults\u2019\u201d\u2014their immaturity, recklessness, and impetuosity\u2014make them less likely to consider potential punishment. Graham, 560 U. S., at 72 (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 571). Similarly, incapacitation could not support the life-without-parole sentence in Graham: Deciding that a \u201cjuvenile offender forever will be a danger to society\u201d would require \u201cmak[ing] a judgment that [he] is incorrigible\u201d\u2014but \u201c \u2018incorrigibility is inconsistent with youth.\u2019 \u201d 560 U. S., at 72-73 (quoting Workman v. Commonwealth, 429 S. W. 2d 374, 378 (Ky. App. 1968)). And for the same reason, rehabilitation could not justify that sentence. Life without parole \u201cforswears altogether the rehabilitative ideal.\u201d Graham, 560 U. S., at 74. It reflects \u201can irrevocable judgment about [an offender\u2019s] value and place in society,\u201d at odds with a child\u2019s capacity for change. Ibid.\nGraham concluded from this analysis that life-without-parole sentences, like capital punishment, may violate the Eighth Amendment when imposed on children. To be sure, Graham\u2019s flat ban on life without parole applied only to non-homicide crimes, and the Court took care to distinguish those offenses from murder, based on both moral culpability and consequential harm. See id., at 69. But none of what it said about children\u2014about their distinctive (and transitory) mental traits and environmental vulnerabilities\u2014is crime-specific. Those features are evident in the same way, and to the same degree, when (as in both cases here) a botched robbery turns into a killing. So Graham\u2019s reasoning implicates any life-without-parole sentence imposed on a juvenile, even as its categorical bar relates only to nonhomicide offenses.\nMost fundamentally, Graham insists that youth matters in determining the appropriateness of a lifetime of incarceration without the possibility of parole. In the circumstances there, juvenile status precluded a life-without-parole sentence, even though an adult could receive it for a similar crime. And in other contexts as well, the characteristics of youth, and the way they weaken rationales for punishment, can render a life-without-parole sentence disproportionate. Cf. id., at 71-74 (generally doubting the penological justifications for imposing life without parole on juveniles). \u201cAn offender\u2019s age,\u201d we made clear in Graham, \u201cis relevant to the Eighth Amendment,\u201d and so \u201ccriminal procedure laws that fail to take defendants\u2019 youthfulness into account at all would be flawed.\u201d Id., at 76. The Chief Justice, concurring in the judgment, made a similar point. Although rejecting a categorical bar on life-without-parole sentences for juveniles, he acknowledged \u201cRoper\u2019s conclusion that juveniles are typically less culpable than adults,\u201d and accordingly wrote that \u201can offender\u2019s juvenile status can play a central role\u201d in considering a sentence\u2019s proportionality. Id., at 90; see id., at 96 (Graham\u2019s \u201cyouth is one factor, among others, that should be considered in deciding whether his punishment was unconstitutionally excessive\u201d).\nBut the mandatory penalty schemes at issue here prevent the sentencer from taking account of these central considerations. By removing youth from the balance\u2014by subjecting a juvenile to the same life-without-parole sentence applicable to an adult\u2014these laws prohibit a sentencing authority from assessing whether the law\u2019s harshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender. That contravenes Graham\u2019s (and also Roper\u2019s) foundational principle: that imposition of a State\u2019s most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were not children.\nAnd Graham makes plain these mandatory schemes\u2019 defects in another way: by likening life-without-parole sentences imposed on juveniles to the death penalty itself. Life-without-parole terms, the Court wrote, \u201cshare some characteristics with death sentences that are shared by no other sentences.\u201d 560 U. S., at 69. Imprisoning an offender until he dies alters the remainder of his life \u201cby a forfeiture that is irrevocable.\u201d Ibid. (citing Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 300-301 (1983)). And this lengthiest possible incarceration is an \u201cespecially harsh punishment for a juvenile,\u201d because he will almost inevitably serve \u201cmore years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an adult offender.\u201d Graham, 560 U. S., at 70. The penalty when imposed on a teenager, as compared with an older person, is therefore \u201cthe same ... in name only.\u201d Ibid. All of that suggested a distinctive set of legal rules: In part because we viewed this ultimate penalty for juveniles as akin to the death penalty, we treated it similarly to that most severe punishment. We imposed a categorical ban on the sentence\u2019s use, in a way unprecedented for a term of imprisonment. See id., at 60; id., at 102 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\u201cFor the first time in its history, the Court declares an entire class of offenders immune from a noncapital sentence using the categorical approach it previously reserved for death penalty cases alone\u201d). And the bar we adopted mirrored a proscription first established in the death penalty context\u2014 that the punishment cannot be imposed for any nonhomicide crimes against individuals. See Kennedy, 554 U. S. 407; Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977).\nThat correspondence\u2014Graham\u2019s \u201c[t]reat[ment] [of] juvenile life sentences as analogous to capital punishment,\u201d 560 U. S., at 89 (Roberts, C. J., concurring in judgment)\u2014makes relevant here a second line of our precedents, demanding individualized sentencing when imposing the death penalty. In Woodson, 428 U. S. 280, we held that a statute mandating a death sentence for first-degree murder violated the Eighth Amendment. We thought the mandatory scheme flawed because it gave no significance to \u201cthe character and record of the individual offender or the circumstances\u201d of the offense, and \u201cexcluded] from consideration ... the possibility of compassionate or mitigating factors.\u201d Id., at 304. Subsequent decisions have elaborated on the requirement that capital defendants have an opportunity to advance, and the judge or jury a chance to assess, any mitigating factors, so that the death penalty is reserved only for the most culpable defendants committing the most serious offenses. See, e. g., Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66, 74-76 (1987); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110-112 (1982); Lockett, 438 U. S., at 597-609 (plurality opinion).\nOf special pertinence here, we insisted in these rulings that a sentencer have the ability to consider the \u201cmitigating qualities of youth.\u201d Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 367 (1993). Everything we said in Roper and Graham about that stage of life also appears in these decisions. As we observed, \u201cyouth is more than a chronological fact.\u201d Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115. It is a time of immaturity, irresponsibility, \u201cimpetuousnessf,] and recklessness.\u201d Johnson, 509 U. S., at 368. It is a moment and \u201ccondition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage.\u201d Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115. And its \u201csignature qualities\u201d are all \u201ctransient.\u201d Johnson, 509 U. S., at 368. Eddings is especially on point. There, a 16-year-old shot a police officer point-blank and killed him. We invalidated his death sentence because the judge did not consider evidence of his neglectful and violent family background (including his mother's drug abuse and his father\u2019s physical abuse) and his emotional disturbance. We found that evidence \u201cparticularly relevant\u201d\u2014more so than it would have been in the case of an adult offender. 455 U. S., at 115. We held: \u201c[J]ust as the chronological age of a minor is itself a relevant mitigating factor of great weight, so must the background and mental and emotional development of a youthful defendant be duly considered\u201d in assessing his culpability. Id., at 116.\nIn light of Graham\u2019s reasoning, these decisions too show the flaws of imposing mandatory life-without-parole sentences on juvenile homicide offenders. Such mandatory penalties, by their nature, preclude a sentencer from taking account of an offender\u2019s age and the wealth of characteristics and circumstances attendant to it. Under these schemes, every juvenile will receive the same sentence as every other\u2014the 17-year-old and the 14-year-old, the shooter and the accomplice, the child from a stable household and the child from a chaotic and abusive one. And still worse, each juvenile (including these two 14-year-olds) will receive the same sentence as the vast majority of adults committing similar homicide offenses\u2014but really, as Graham noted, a greater sentence than those adults will serve. In meting out the death penalty, the elision of all these differences would be strictly forbidden. And once again, Graham indicates that a similar rule should apply when a juvenile confronts a sentence of life (and death) in prison.\nSo Graham and Roper and our individualized sentencing cases alike teach that in imposing a State\u2019s harshest penalties, a senteneer misses too much if he treats every child as an adult. To recap: Mandatory life without parole for a juvenile precludes consideration of his chronological age and its hallmark features\u2014among them, immaturity, impetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and consequences. It prevents taking into account the family and home environment that surrounds him\u2014and from which he cannot usually extricate himself\u2014no matter how brutal or dysfunctional. It neglects the circumstances of the homicide offense, including the extent of his participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him. Indeed, it ignores that he might have been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not for incompetencies associated with youth\u2014for example, his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors (including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist his own attorneys. See, e. g., Graham, 560 U. S., at 78 (\u201c[T]he features that distinguish juveniles from adults also put them at a significant disadvantage in criminal proceedings\u201d); J. D. B. v. North Carolina, 564 U. S. 261, 269 (2011) (discussing children\u2019s responses to interrogation). And finally, this mandatory punishment disregards the possibility of rehabilitation even when the circumstances most suggest it.\nBoth cases before us illustrate the problem. Take Jackson\u2019s first. As noted earlier, Jackson did not fire the bullet that killed Laurie Troup; nor did the State argue that he intended her death. Jackson\u2019s conviction was instead based on an aiding-and-abetting theory; and the appellate court affirmed the verdict only because the jury could have believed that when Jackson entered the store, he warned Troup that \u201c[w]e ain\u2019t playin\u2019,\u201d rather than told his friends that \u201cI thought you all was playin\u2019.\u201d See 359 Ark., at 90-92, 194 S. W. 3d, at 759-760; supra, at 465. To be sure, Jackson learned on the way to the video store that his friend Shields was carrying a gun, but his age could well have affected his calculation of the risk that posed, as well as his willingness to walk away at that point. All these circumstances go to Jackson\u2019s culpability for the offense. See Graham, 560 U. S., at 69 (\u201c[W]hen compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile offender who did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral culpability\u201d). And so too does Jackson\u2019s family background and immersion in violence: Both his mother and his grandmother had previously shot other individuals. See Record in No. 10-9647, pp. 80-82. At the least, a sentencer should look at such facts before depriving a 14-year-old of any prospect of release from prison.\nThat is true also in Miller\u2019s case. No one can doubt that he and Smith committed a vicious murder. But they did it when high on drugs and alcohol consumed with the adult victim. And if ever a pathological background might have contributed to a 14-year-old\u2019s commission of a crime, it is here. Miller\u2019s stepfather physically abused him; his alcoholic and drug-addicted mother neglected him; he had been in and out of foster care as a result; and he had tried to kill himself four times, the first when he should have been in kindergarten. See 928 So. 2d, at 1081 (Cobb, J., concurring in result); Miller App. 26-28; supra, at 467-468. Nonetheless, Miller\u2019s past criminal history was limited\u2014two instances of truancy and one of \u201csecond-degree criminal mischief.\u201d No. CR-03-0915, at 6 (unpublished memorandum). That Miller deserved severe punishment for killing Cole Cannon is beyond question. But once again, a sentencer needed to examine all these circumstances before concluding that life without any possibility of parole was the appropriate penalty.\nWe therefore hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile offenders. Cf. Graham, 560 U. S., at 75 (\u201cA State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom,\u201d but must provide \u201csome meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation\u201d). By making youth (and all that accompanies it) irrelevant to imposition of that harshest prison sentence, such a scheme poses too great a risk of disproportionate punishment. Because that holding is sufficient to decide these cases, we do not consider Jackson\u2019s and Miller\u2019s alternative argument that the Eighth Amendment requires a categorical bar on life without parole for juveniles, or at least for those 14 and younger. But given all we have said in Roper, Graham, and this decision about children\u2019s diminished culpability and heightened capacity for change, we think appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible penalty will be uncommon. That is especially so because of the great difficulty we noted in Roper and Graham of distinguishing at this early age between \u201cthe juvenile offender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.\u201d Roper, 543 U. S., at 573; Graham, 560 U. S., at 68. Although we do not foreclose a sentencer\u2019s ability to make that judgment in homicide cases, we require it to take into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.\nIll\nAlabama and Arkansas offer two kinds of arguments against requiring individualized consideration before sentencing a juvenile to life imprisonment without possibility of parole. The States (along with the dissents) first contend that the rule we adopt conflicts with aspects of our Eighth Amendment caselaw. And they next assert that the rule is unnecessary because individualized circumstances come into play in deciding whether to try a juvenile offender as an adult. We think the States are wrong on both counts.\nA\nThe States (along with Justice Thomas) first claim that Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957 (1991), precludes our holding. The defendant in Harmelin was sentenced to a mandatory life-without-parole term for possessing more than 650 grams of cocaine. The Court upheld that penalty, reasoning that \u201ca sentence which is not otherwise cruel and unusual\u201d does not \u201cbeeom[e] so simply because it is \u2018mandatory.\u2019\u201d Id., at 995. We recognized that a different rule, requiring individualized sentencing, applied in the death penalty context. But we refused to extend that command to noncapital cases \u201cbecause of the qualitative difference between death and all other penalties.\u201d Ibid.; see id., at 1006 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). According to Alabama, invalidating the mandatory imposition of life-without-parole terms on juveniles \u201cwould effectively overrule Harmelin.\u201d Brief for Respondent in No. 10-9646, p. 59 (hereinafter Alabama Brief); see Arkansas Brief 39.\nWe think that argument myopic. Harmelin had nothing to do with children and did not purport to apply its holding to the sentencing of juvenile offenders. We have by now held on multiple occasions that a sentencing rule permissible for adults may not be so for children. Capital punishment, our decisions hold, generally comports with the Eighth Amendment\u2014except it cannot be imposed on children. See Roper, 543 U. S. 551; Thompson, 487 U. S. 815. So too, life without parole is permissible for nonhomieide offenses\u2014 except, once again, for children. See Graham, 560 U. S., at 75. Nor are these sentencing decisions an oddity in the law. To the contrary, \u201c \u2018[o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recognition\u2019 that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults.\u201d J. D. B., 564 U. S., at 274 (quoting Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115-116, citing examples from criminal, property, contract, and tort law). So if (as Harmelin recognized) \u201cdeath is different,\u201d children are different too. Indeed, it is the odd legal rule that does not have some form of exception for children. In that context, it is no surprise that the law relating to society\u2019s harshest punishments recognizes such a distinction. Cf. Graham, 560 U. S., at 91 (Roberts, C. J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cGraham\u2019s age places him in a significantly different category from the de-fendan[t] in . . . Harmelin\u201d). Our ruling thus neither overrules nor undermines nor conflicts with Harmelin.\nAlabama and Arkansas (along with The Chief Justice and Justice Alito) next contend that because many States impose mandatory life-without-parole sentences on juveniles, we may not hold the practice unconstitutional. In considering categorical bars to the death penalty and life without parole, we ask as part of the analysis whether \u201c'objective indicia of society's standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice/\u201d show a \u201cnational consensus\u201d against a sentence for a particular class of offenders. Graham, 560 U. S., at 61 (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 563). By our count, 29 jurisdictions (28 States and the Federal Government) make a life-without-parole term mandatory for some juveniles convicted of murder in adult court. The States argue that this number precludes our holding.\nWe do not agree; indeed, we think the States\u2019 argument on this score weaker than the one we rejected in Graham. For starters, the cases here are different from the typical one in which we have tallied legislative enactments. Our decision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime\u2014as, for example, we did in Roper or Graham. Instead, it mandates only that a sentencer follow a certain process\u2014considering an offender\u2019s youth and attendant characteristics\u2014before imposing a particular penalty. And in so requiring, our decision flows straightforwardly from our precedents: specifically, the principle of Roper, Graham, and our individualized sentencing cases that youth matters for purposes of meting out the law\u2019s most serious punishments. When both of those circumstances have obtained in the past, we have not scrutinized or relied in the same way on legislative enactments. See, e. g., Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66 (relying on Woodson\u2019s logic to prohibit the mandatory death penalty for murderers already serving life without parole); Lockett, 438 U. S., at 602-608 (plurality opinion) (applying Woodson to require that judges and juries consider all mitigating evidence); Eddings, 455 U. S., at 110-117 (similar). We see no difference here.\nIn any event, the \u201cobjective indicia\u201d that the States offer do not distinguish these eases from others holding that a sentencing practice violates the Eighth Amendment. In Graham, we prohibited life-without-parole terms for juveniles committing nonhomicide offenses even though 39 jurisdictions permitted that sentence. See 560 U. S., at 62. That is 10 more than impose life without parole on juveniles on a mandatory basis. And in Atkins, Roper, and Thomp son, we similarly banned the death penalty in circumstances in which \u201cless than half\u201d of the \u201cStates that permit[ted] capital punishment (for whom the issue exist[ed])\u201d had previously chosen to do so. Atkins, 536 U. S., at 342 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted); see id., at 313-315 (majority opinion); Roper, 543 U. S., at 564-565; Thompson, 487 U. S., at 826-827 (plurality opinion). So we are breaking no new ground in these cases.\nGraham and Thompson provide special guidance, because they considered the same kind of statutes we do and explained why simply counting them would present a distorted view. Most jurisdictions authorized the death penalty or life without parole for juveniles only through the combination of two independent statutory provisions. One allowed the transfer of certain juvenile offenders to adult court, while another (often in a far-removed part of the code) set out the penalties for any and all individuals tried there. We reasoned that in those circumstances, it was impossible to say whether a legislature had endorsed a given penalty for children (or would do so if presented with the choice). In Thompson, we found that the statutes \u201ct[old] us that the States consider 15-year-olds to be old enough to be tried in criminal court for serious crimes (or too old to be dealt with effectively in juvenile court), but t[old] us nothing about the judgment these States have made regarding the appropriate punishment for such youthful offenders.\u201d 487 U. S., at 826, n. 24 (plurality opinion) (emphasis deleted); see also id., at 850 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment); Roper, 543 U. S., at 596, n. (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). And Graham echoed that reasoning: Although the confluence of state laws \u201cma[de] life without parole possible for some juvenile nonhomicide offenders,\u201d it did not \u201cjustify a judgment\u201d that many States actually \u201cintended to subject such offenders\u201d to those sentences. 560 U. S., at 67.\nAll that is just as true here. Almost all jurisdictions allow some juveniles to be tried in adult court for some kinds of homicide. See Dept, of Justice, H. Snyder & M. Sick-mund, Juvenile Offenders and Victims: 2006 National Report 110-114 (hereinafter 2006 National Report). But most States do not have separate penalty provisions for those juvenile offenders. Of the 29 jurisdictions mandating life without parole for children, more than half do so by virtue of generally applicable penalty provisions, imposing the sentence without regard to age. And indeed, some of those States set no minimum age for who may be transferred to adult court in the first instance, thus applying life-without-parole mandates to children of any age\u2014be it 17 or 14 or 10 or 6. As in Graham, we think that \u201cunderscores that the statutory eligibility of a juvenile offender for life without parole does not indicate that the penalty has been endorsed through deliberate, express, and full legislative consideration.\u201d 560 U. S., at 67. That Alabama and Arkansas can count to 29 by including these possibly (or probably) inadvertent legislative outcomes does not preclude our determination that mandatory life without parole for juveniles violates the Eighth Amendment.\nB\nNor does the presence of discretion in some jurisdictions\u2019 transfer statutes aid the States here. Alabama and Arkansas initially ignore that many States use mandatory transfer systems: A juvenile of a certain age who has committed a specified offense will be tried in adult court, regardless of any individualized circumstances. Of the 29 relevant jurisdictions, about half place at least some juvenile homicide offenders in adult court automatically, with no apparent opportunity to seek transfer to juvenile court. Moreover, several States at times lodge this decision exclusively in the hands of prosecutors, again with no statutory mechanism for judicial reevaluation. And those \u201cprosecutorial discretion laws are usually silent regarding standards, protocols, or appropriate considerations for decisionmaking.\u201d Dept, of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, P. Griffin, S. Addie, B. Adams, & K. Firestine, Trying Juveniles as Adults: An Analysis of State Transfer Laws and Reporting 5 (2011).\nEven when States give transfer-stage discretion to judges, it has limited utility. First, the decisionmaker typically will have only partial information at this early, pretrial stage about either the child or the circumstances of his offense. Miller\u2019s case provides an example. As noted earlier, see n. 3, supra, the juvenile court denied Miller\u2019s request for his own mental-health expert at the transfer hearing, and the appeals court affirmed on the ground that Miller was not then entitled to the protections and services he would receive at trial. See No. CR-03-0915, at 3-4 (unpublished memorandum). But by then, of course, the expert\u2019s testimony could not change the sentence; whatever she said in mitigation, the mandatory life-without-parole prison term would kick in. The key moment for the exercise of discretion is the transfer\u2014and as Miller\u2019s case shows, the judge often does not know then what she will learn, about the offender or the offense, over the course of the proceedings.\nSecond and still more important, the question at transfer hearings may differ dramatically from the issue at a post-trial sentencing. Because many juvenile systems require that the offender be released at a particular age or after a certain number of years, transfer decisions often present a choice between extremes: light punishment as a child or standard sentencing as an adult (here, life without parole). In many States, for example, a child convicted in juvenile court must be released from custody by the age of 21. See, e. g., Ala. Code \u00a7 12-15-117(a) (Cum. Supp. 2011); see generally 2006 National Report 103 (noting limitations on the length of juvenile court sanctions). Discretionary sentencing in adult court would provide different options: There, a judge or jury could choose, rather than a life-without-parole sentence, a lifetime prison term with the possibility of parole or a lengthy term of years. It is easy to imagine a .judge deciding that a minor deserves a (much) harsher sentence than he would receive in juvenile court, while still not thinking life-without-parole appropriate. For that reason, the discretion available to a judge at the transfer stage cannot substitute for discretion at post-trial sentencing in adult court\u2014and so cannot satisfy the Eighth Amendment.\nb-i <1\nGraham, Roper, and our individualized sentencing decisions make clear that a judge or jury must have the opportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before imposing the harshest possible penalty for juveniles. By requiring that all children convicted of homicide receive lifetime incarceration without possibility of parole, regardless of their age and age-related characteristics and the nature of their crimes, the mandatory-sentencing schemes before us violate this principle of proportionality, and so the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. We accordingly reverse the judgments of the Arkansas Supreme Court and Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and remand the cases for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nJackson was ineligible for the death penalty under Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815 (1988) (plurality opinion), which held that capital punishment of offenders under the age of 16 violates the Eighth Amendment.\nFor the first time in this Court, Arkansas contends that Jackson\u2019s sentence was not mandatory. On its view, state law then in effect allowed the trial judge to suspend the life-without-parole sentence and commit Jackson to the Department of Human Services for a \u201ctraining-school program,\u201d at the end of which he could be placed on probation. Brief for Respondent in No. 10-9647, pp. 36-37 (hereinafter Arkansas Brief) (citing Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 12-28-403(b)(2) (1999)). But Arkansas never raised that objection in the state courts, and they treated Jackson\u2019s sentence as mandatory. We abide by that interpretation of state law. See, e. g., Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 690-691 (1975).\nThe Court of Criminal Appeals also affirmed the juvenile court\u2019s denial of Miller\u2019s request for funds to hire his own mental expert for the transfer hearing. The court pointed out that under governing Alabama Supreme Court precedent, \u201cthe procedural requirements of a trial do not ordinarily apply\u201d to those hearings. E. J. M. v. State, 928 So. 2d 1077 (2004) (Cobb, J., concurring in result) (internal quotation marks omitted). In a separate opinion, Judge Cobb agreed on the reigning precedent, but urged the State Supreme Court to revisit the question in light of transfer hearings\u2019 importance. See id., at 1081 (\u201c[A]lthough later mental evaluation as an adult affords some semblance of procedural due process, it is, in effect, too little, too late\u201d).\nThe three dissenting opinions here each take issue with some or all of those precedents. See post, at 497-498 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.); post, at 502-507 (opinion of Thomas, J.); post, at 510-513 (opinion of Alito, J.). That is not surprising: Their authors (and joiner) each dissented from some or all of those precedents. See, e. g., Kennedy, 554 U. S., at 447 (Alito, J., joined by Roberts, C. J., and Scalia and Thomas, JJ., dissenting); Roper, 543 U. S., at 607 (Scalia, J., joined by, inter alios, Thomas, J., dissenting); Atkins, 536 U. S., at 337 (Scalia, J., joined by, inter alios, Thomas, J., dissenting); Thompson, 487 U. S., at 859 (Scalia, J., dissenting); Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 487 (1993) (Thomas, J., concurring) (contending that Woodson was wrongly decided). In particular, each disagreed with the majority\u2019s reasoning in Graham, which is the foundation stone of our analysis. See Graham, 560 U. S., at 86 (Roberts, C. J., concurring in judgment); id., at 97 (Thomas, J., joined by Scalia and Alito, JJ., dissenting); id., at 124 (Alito, J., dissenting). While the dissents seek to reliti-gate old Eighth Amendment battles, repeating many arguments this Court has previously (and often) rejected, we apply the logic of Roper, Graham, and our individualized sentencing decisions to these two cases.\nThe evidence presented to us in these cases indicates that the science and social science supporting Roper\u2019s and Graham\u2019s conclusions have become even stronger. See, e. g., Brief for American Psychological Association et al. as Amici Curiae 8 (\u201c[A]n ever-growing body of research in developmental psychology and neuroscience continues to confirm and strengthen the Court\u2019s conclusions\u201d); id., at 4 (\u201cIt is increasingly clear that adolescent brains are not yet fully mature in regions and systems related to higher-order executive functions such as impulse control, planning ahead, and risk avoidance\u201d); Brief for J. Lawrence Aber et al. as Amici Curiae 12-28 (discussing post-ffratora studies); id., at 26-27 (\u201cNumerous studies post-Graham indicate that exposure to deviant peers leads to increased deviant behavior and is a consistent predictor of adolescent delinquency\u201d (footnote omitted)).\nIn discussing Graham, the dissents essentially ignore all of this reasoning. See post, at 495-498 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.); post, at 512-513 (opinion of Auto, J.). Indeed, The Chief Justice ignores the points made in his own concurring opinion. The only part of Graham that the dissents see fit to note is the distinction it drew between homicide and nonhomicide offenses. See post, at 499-500 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.); post, at 512-513 (opinion of Ajlito, J.). But contrary to the dissents\u2019 charge, our decision today retains that distinction: Graham established one rule (a flat ban) for nonhomicide offenses, while we set out a different one (individualized sentencing) for homicide offenses.\nAlthough adults are subject as well to the death penalty in many jurisdictions, very few offenders actually receive that sentence. See, e.g., Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, S. Rosenmerkel, M. Durose, & D. Farole, Felony Sentences in State Courts, 2006\u2014Statistical Tables, p. 28 (Table 4.4) (rev. Nov. 22,2010). So in practice, the sentencing schemes at issue here result in juvenile homicide offenders receiving the same nominal punishment as almost all adults, even though the two classes differ significantly in moral culpability and capacity for change.\nGiven our holding, and the dissents\u2019 competing position, we see a certain irony in their repeated references to 17-year-olds who have committed the \u201cmost heinous\u201d offenses, and their comparison of those defendants to the 14-year-olds here. See post, at 494 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.) (noting the \u201c17-year-old [who] is convicted of deliberately murdering an innocent victim\u201d); post, at 495 (\u201cthe most heinous murders\u201d); post, at 499 (\u201cthe worst types of murder\u201d); post, at 513 (opinion of Alito, J.) (warning the reader not to be \u201cconfused by the particulars\u201d of these two cases); post, at 510 (discussing the \u201c17l4-year-old who sets off a bomb in a crowded mall\u201d). Our holding requires factfinders to attend to exactly such circumstances\u2014 to take into account the differences among defendants and crimes. By contrast, the sentencing schemes that the dissents find permissible altogether preclude considering these factors.\nThe States note that 26 States and the Federal Government make life without parole the mandatory (or mandatory minimum) punishment for some form of murder, and would apply the relevant provision to 14-year-olds (with many applying it to even younger defendants). See Alabama Brief 17-18. In addition, life without parole is mandatory for older juveniles in Louisiana (age 15 and up) and Texas (age 17). See La. Child. Code Ann., Arts. 857(A), (B) (West Supp. 2012); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 14:30(C), 14:30.1(B) (West Supp. 2012); Tex. Fam. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a751.02(2)(A), 54.02(a)(2)(A) (West Supp. 2011); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.31(a) (West 2011). In many of these jurisdictions, life without parole is the mandatory punishment only for aggravated forms of murder. That distinction makes no difference to our analysis. We have consistently held that limiting a mandatory death penalty law to particular kinds of murder cannot cure the law\u2019s \u201cconstitutional vice\u201d of disregarding the \u201ccircumstances of the particular offense and the character and propensities of the offender.\u201d Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U. S. 325, 333 (1976) (plurality opinion); see Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66 (1987). The same analysis applies here, for the same reasons.\nIn assessing indicia of societal standards, Graham discussed \u201c[a]ctual sentencing practices\u201d in addition to legislative enactments, noting how infrequently sentencers imposed the statutorily available penalty. 560 U. S., at 62. Here, we consider the constitutionality of mandatory-sentencing schemes\u2014which by definition remove a judge\u2019s or jury\u2019s discretion\u2014so no comparable gap between legislation and practice can exist. Rather than showing whether sentencers consider life without parole for juvenile homicide offenders appropriate, the number of juveniles serving this sentence, see post, at 493-494, 495-496 (Roberts, C. J., dissenting), merely reflects the number who have committed homicide in mandatory-sentencing jurisdictions. For the same reason, The Chief Justice\u2019s comparison of ratios in these cases and Graham carries little weight. He contrasts the number of mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juvenile murderers, relative to the number of juveniles arrested for murder, with \u201cthe corresponding number\u201d of sentences in Graham (i. <?., the number of life-without-parole sentences for juveniles who committed serious nonhomicide crimes, as compared to arrests for those crimes). Post, at 496. But because the mandatory nature of the sentences here necessarily makes them more common, The Chief Justice\u2019s figures do not \u201ccorre-spon[d]\u201d at all. The higher ratio is mostly a function of removing the sentencer\u2019s discretion.\nWhere mandatory sentencing does not itself account for the number of juveniles serving life-without-parole terms, the evidence we have of practice supports our holding. Fifteen jurisdictions make life without parole discretionary for juveniles. See Alabama Brief 25 (listing 12 States); Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 190.5(b) (West 2008); Ind. Code \u00a7 35-50-2-3(b) (2011); N. M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a731-18-13(B), 31-18-14, 31-18-15.2 (2010). According to available data, only about 15% of all juvenile life-without-parole sentences come from those 15 jurisdictions, while 85% come from the 29 mandatory ones. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 10-9646, p. 19; Human Rights Watch, State Distribution of Youth Offenders Serving Juvenile Life Without Parole (JLWOP) (Oct. 2,2009), online at http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/ 10/02/state-distribution-juvenile-offenders-serving-juvenile-life-without-parole (as visited June 21, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). That figure indicates that when given the choice, sentencers impose life without parole on children relatively rarely. And contrary to The Chief Justice\u2019s argument, see post, at 497, n. 2, we have held that when judges and juries do not often choose to impose a sentence, it at least should not be mandatory. See Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 295-296 (1976) (plurality opinion) (relying on the infrequency with which juries imposed the death penalty when given discretion to hold that its mandatory imposition violates the Eighth Amendment).\nIn response, The Chief Justice complains: \u201cTo say that a sentence may be considered unusual because so many legislatures approve it stands precedent on its head.\u201d Post, at 497. To be.clear: That description in no way resembles our opinion. We hold that the sentence violates the Eighth Amendment because, as we have exhaustively shown, it conflicts with the fundamental principles of Roper, Graham,, and our individualized sentencing cases. We then show why the number of States imposing this punishment does not preclude our holding, and note how its mandatory nature (in however many States adopt it) makes use of actual sentencing numbers unilluminating.\nThe Chief Justice attempts to distinguish Graham, on this point, arguing that there \u201cthe extreme rarity with which the sentence in question was imposed could suggest that legislatures did not really intend the inevitable result of the laws they passed.\u201d Post, at 497-498. But neither Graham nor Thompson suggested such reasoning, presumably because the timeframe makes it difficult to comprehend. Those eases considered what legislators intended when they enacted, at different moments, separate juvenile-transfer and life-without-parole provisions\u2014by definition, before they knew or could know how many juvenile life-without-parole sentences would result.\nSee Ala.

I add that, if the State continues to seek a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for Kuntrell Jackson, there will have to be a determination whether Jackson \u201ckill[ed] or intended] to kill\u201d the robbery victim. Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. 48, 69 (2010). In my view, without such a finding, the Eighth Amendment as interpreted in Graham forbids sentencing Jackson to such a sentence, regardless of whether its application is mandatory or discretionary under state law.\nIn Graham we said that \u201cwhen compared to an adult murderer, a juvenile offender who did not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral culpability.\u201d Ibid, (emphasis added). For one thing, \u201ccompared to adults, juveniles have a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility; they are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure; and their characters are not as well formed.\u201d Id., at 68 (internal quotation marks omitted). See also ibid. (\u201c[Psychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds,\u201d making their actions \u201cless likely to be evidence of \u2018irretrievably depraved character\u2019 than are the actions of adults\u201d (quoting Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 570 (2005))); ante, at 471-472. For another thing, Graham recognized that lack of intent normally diminishes the \u201cmoral culpability\u201d that attaches to the crime in question, making those that do not intend to kill \u201ccategorically less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment than are murderers.\u201d 560 U. S., at 69 (citing Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407, 434-435 (2008); Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982); Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137 (1987)). And we concluded that, because of this \u201ctwice diminished moral culpability,\u201d the Eighth Amendment forbids the imposition upon juveniles of a sentence of life without parole for nonhomicide cases. Graham, supra, at 69, 82.\nGiven Graham\u2019s reasoning, the kinds of homicide that can subject a juvenile offender to life without parole must exclude instances where the juvenile himself neither kills nor intends to kill the victim. Quite simply, if the juvenile either kills or intends to kill the victim, he lacks \u201ctwice diminished\u201d responsibility. But where the juvenile neither kills nor intends to kill, both features emphasized in Graham as extenuating apply. \u2022 The Chief Justice\u2019s dissent itself here would permit life without parole for \u201cjuveniles who commit the worst types of murder,\u201d post, at 499, but that phrase does not readily fit the culpability of one who did not himself kill or intend to kill.\nI recognize that in the context of felony-murder cases, the question of intent is a complicated one. The felony-murder doctrine traditionally attributes death caused in the course of a felony to all participants who intended to commit the felony, regardless of whether they killed or intended to kill. See 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7\u00a7 14.5(a) and (e) (2d ed. 2003). This rule has been based on the idea of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d; the defendant\u2019s intent to commit the felony satisfies the intent to kill required for murder. See S. Kadish, S. Schulhofer, & C. Steiker, Criminal Law and Its Processes 439 (8th ed. 2007); 2 C. Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 147 (15th ed. 1994).\nBut in my opinion, this type of \u201ctransferred intent\u201d is not sufficient to satisfy the intent to murder that could subject a juvenile to a sentence of life without parole. As an initial matter, this Court has made clear that this artificially constructed kind of intent does not count as intent for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. We do not rely on transferred intent in determining if an adult may receive the death penalty. Thus, the Constitution forbids imposing capital punishment upon an aider and abettor in a robbery, where that individual did not intend to kill and simply was \u201cin the car by the side of the road . . . , waiting to help the robbers escape.\u201d Enmund, supra, at 788. Cf. Tison, supra, at 157-158 (capital punishment permissible for aider and abettor where kidnaping led to death because he was \u201cactively involved\u201d in every aspect of the kidnaping and his behavior showed \u201ca reckless disregard for human life\u201d). Given Graham, this holding applies to juvenile sentences of life without parole a fortiori. See ante, at 475-476. Indeed, even juveniles who meet the Tison standard of \u201creckless disregard\u201d may not be eligible for life without parole. Rather, Graham dictates a clear rule: The only juveniles who may constitutionally be sentenced to life without parole are those convicted of homicide offenses who \u201ckill or intend to kill.\u201d 560 U. S., at 69.\nMoreover, regardless of our law with respect to adults, there is no basis for imposing a sentence of life without parole upon a juvenile who did not himself kill or intend to kill. At base, the theory of transferring a defendant\u2019s intent is premised on the idea that one engaged in a dangerous felony should understand the risk that the victim of the felony could be killed, even by a confederate. See 2 LaFave, supra, \u00a7 14.5(c). Yet the ability to consider the full consequences of a course of action and to adjust one\u2019s conduct accordingly is precisely what we know juveniles lack capacity to do effectively. Ante, at 471-472. Justice Frankfurter cautioned, \u201cLegal theories and their phrasing in other cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning if uncritically transferred to a determination of a State\u2019s duty toward children.\u201d May v. Anderson, 345 U. S. 528, 536 (1953) (concurring opinion). To apply the doctrine of transferred intent here, where the juvenile did not kill, to sentence a juvenile to life without parole would involve such \u201cfallacious reasoning.\u201d Ibid.\nThis is, as far as I can tell, precisely the situation present in Kuntrell Jackson\u2019s case. Jackson simply went along with older boys to rob a video store. On the way, he became aware that a confederate had a gun. He initially stayed outside the store, and went in briefly, saying something like \u201cWe ain\u2019t playin\u2019 \u201d or \u201c T thought you all was playin,\u2019 \u201d before an older confederate shot and killed the store clerk. Jackson v. State, 359 Ark. 87, 91, 194 S. W. 3d 757, 760 (2004). Crucially, the jury found him guilty of first-degree murder under a statute that permitted them to convict if Jackson \u201cattempted to commit or committed an aggravated robbery, and, in the course of that offense, he, or an accomplice, caused [the clerk\u2019s] death under circumstance manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d Ibid. See Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 5\u201410\u2014101(a)(1) (1997); ante, at 478. Thus, to be found guilty, Jackson did not need to kill the clerk (it is conceded he did not), nor did he need to have intent to kill or even \u201cextreme indifference.\u201d As long as one of the teenage accomplices in the robbery acted with extreme indifference to the value of human life, Jackson could be convicted of capital murder. Ibid.\nThe upshot is that Jackson, who did not kill the clerk, might not have intended to do so either. See Jackson v. Norris, 2011 Ark. 49, at 10, 378 S. W. 3d 103, 109 (Danielson, J., dissenting) (\u201c[A]ny evidence of [Jackson\u2019s] intent to kill was severely lacking\u201d). In that case, the Eighth Amendment simply forbids imposition of a life term without the possibility of parole. If, on remand, however, there is a finding that Jackson did intend to cause the clerk\u2019s death, the question remains open whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of life without parole upon a juvenile in those circumstances as well.

        "text": "Chief Justice Roberts,\nwith whom Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito join, dissenting.\nDetermining the appropriate sentence for a teenager convicted of murder presents grave and challenging questions of morality and social policy. Our role, however, is to apply the law, not to answer such questions. The pertinent law here is the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d Today, the Court invokes that Amendment to ban a punishment that the Court does not itself characterize as unusual, and that could not plausibly be described as such. I therefore dissent.\nThe parties agree that nearly 2,500 prisoners are presently serving life sentences without the possibility of parole for murders they committed before the age of 18. Brief for Petitioner in No. 10-9647, p. 62, n. 80 (Jackson Brief); Brief for Respondent in No. 10-9646, p. 30 (Alabama Brief). The Court accepts that over 2,000 of those prisoners received that sentence because it was mandated by a legislature. Ante, at 483, n. 10. And it recognizes that the Federal Government and most States impose such mandatory sentences. Ante, at 482. Put simply, if a 17-year-old is convicted of deliberately murdering an innocent victim, it is not \u201cunusual\u201d for the murderer to receive a mandatory sentence of life without parole. That reality should preclude finding that mandatory life imprisonment for juvenile killers violates the Eighth Amendment.\nOur precedent supports this conclusion. When determining whether a punishment is cruel and unusual, this Court typically begins with \u201c\u2018objective indicia of society\u2019s standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice.\u2019\u201d Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. 48, 61 (2010); see also, e. g., Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407, 422 (2008); Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 564 (2005). We look to these \u201cobjective indicia\u201d to ensure that we are not simply following our own subjective values or beliefs. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 173 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). Such tangible evidence of societal standards enables us to determine whether there is a \u201cconsensus against\u201d a given sentencing practice. Graham, supra, at 61. If there is, the punishment may be regarded as \u201cunusual.\u201d But when, as here, most States formally require and frequently impose the punishment in question, there is no objective basis for that conclusion.\nOur Eighth Amendment cases have also said that we should take guidance from \u201cevolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u201d Ante, at 469 (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976); internal quotation marks omitted). Mercy toward the guilty can be a form of decency, and a maturing society may abandon harsh punishments that it comes to view as unnecessary or unjust. But decency is not the same as leniency. A decent society protects the innocent from violence. A mature society may determine that this requires removing those guilty of the most heinous murders from its midst, both as protection for its other members and as a concrete expression of its standards of decency. As judges we have no basis for deciding that progress toward greater decency can move only in the direction of easing sanctions on the guilty.\nIn this case, there is little doubt about the direction of society\u2019s evolution: For most of the 20th century, American sentencing practices emphasized rehabilitation of the offender and the availability of parole. But by the 1980\u2019s, outcry against repeat offenders, broad disaffection with the rehabilitative model, and other factors led many legislatures to reduce or eliminate the possibility of parole, imposing longer sentences in order to punish criminals and prevent them from committing more crimes. See, e. g., Alschuler, The Changing Purposes of Criminal Punishment, 70 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1, 1-13 (2003); see generally Crime and Public Policy (J. Wilson & J. Petersilia eds. 2011). Statutes establishing life without parole sentences in particular became more common in the past quarter century. See Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 78, and n. 10 (2008) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). And the parties agree that most States have changed their laws relatively recently to expose teenage murderers to mandatory life without parole. Jackson Brief 54-55; Alabama Brief 4-5.\nThe Court attempts to avoid the import of the fact that so many jurisdictions have embraced the sentencing practice at issue by comparing these cases to the Court\u2019s prior Eighth Amendment cases. The Court notes that Graham found a punishment authorized in 39 jurisdictions unconstitutional, whereas the punishment it bans today is mandated in 10 fewer. Ante, at 483. But Graham went to considerable lengths to show that although theoretically allowed in many States, the sentence at issue in that case was \u201cexceedingly rare\u201d in practice. 560 U. S., at 67. The Court explained that only 123 prisoners in the entire Nation were serving life without parole for nonhomieide crimes committed as juveniles, with more than half in a single State. It contrasted that with statistics showing nearly 400,000 juveniles were arrested for serious nonhomieide offenses in a single year. Based on the sentence\u2019s rarity despite the many opportunities to impose it, Graham concluded that there was a national consensus against life without parole for juvenile nonhomieide crimes. Id., at 64-67.\nHere the number of mandatory life without parole sentences for juvenile murderers, relative to the number of juveniles arrested for murder, is over 5,000 times higher than the corresponding number in Graham. There is thus nothing in these eases like the evidence of national consensus in Graham.\nThe Court disregards these numbers, claiming that the prevalence of the sentence in question results from the number of statutes requiring its imposition. Ante, at 484, n. 10. True enough. The sentence at issue is statutorily mandated life without parole. Such a sentence can only result from statutes requiring its imposition. In Graham the Court relied on the low number of actual sentences to explain why the high number of statutes allowing such sentences was not dispositive. Here, the Court excuses the high number of actual sentences by citing the high number of statutes imposing it. To say that a sentence may be considered unusual because so many legislatures approve it stands precedent on its head.\nThe Court also advances another reason for discounting the laws enacted by Congress and most state legislatures. Some of the jurisdictions that impose mandatory life without parole on juvenile murderers do so as a result of two statutes: one providing that juveniles charged with serious crimes may be tried as adults, and another generally mandating that those convicted of murder be imprisoned for life. According to the Court, our cases suggest that where the sentence results from the interaction of two such statutes, the legislature can be considered to have imposed the resulting sentences \u201cinadvertent[ly].\u201d Ante, at 485-487. The Court relies on Graham and Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 826, n. 24 (1988) (plurality opinion), for the proposition that these laws are therefore not valid evidence of society\u2019s views on the punishment at issue.\nIt is a fair question whether this Court should ever assume a legislature is so ignorant of its own laws that it does not understand that two of them interact with each other, especially on an issue of such importance as the one before us. But in Graham and Thompson it was at least plausible as a practical matter. In Graham, the extreme rarity with which the sentence in question was imposed could suggest that legislatures did not really intend the inevitable result of the laws they passed. See 560 U. S., at 66-67. In Thompson, the sentencing practice was even rarer\u2014only 20 defendants had received it in the last century. 487 U. S., at 832 (plurality opinion). Perhaps under those facts it could be argued that the legislature was not fully aware that a teenager could receive the particular sentence in question. But here the widespread and recent imposition of the sentence makes it implausible to characterize this sentencing practice as a collateral consequence of legislative ignorance.\nNor do we display our usual respect for elected officials by asserting that legislators have accidentally required 2,000 teenagers to spend the rest of their lives in jail. This is particularly true given that our well-publicized decision in Graham alerted legislatures to the possibility that teenagers were subject to life with parole only because of legislative inadvertence. I am aware of no effort in the wake of Graham to correct any supposed legislative oversight. Indeed, in amending its laws in response to Graham one legislature made especially clear that it does intend juveniles who commit first-degree murder to receive mandatory life without parole. See Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7 902.1 (West Cum. Supp. 2012).\nIn the end, the Court does not actually conclude that mandatory life sentences for juvenile murderers are unusual. It instead claims that precedent \u201cleads to\u201d today\u2019s decision, primarily relying on Graham and Roper. Ante, at 470. Petitioners argue that the reasoning of those cases \u201ccompels\u201d finding in their favor. Jackson Brief 34. The Court is apparently unwilling to go so far, asserting only that precedent points in that direction. But today\u2019s decision invalidates the laws of dozens of legislatures and Congress. This Court is not easily led to such a result. See, e. g., United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629, 635 (1883) (courts must presume an Act of Congress is constitutional \u201cunless the lack of constitutional authority ... is clearly demonstrated\u201d). Because the Court does not rely on the Eighth Amendment\u2019s text or objective evidence of society\u2019s standards, its analysis of precedent alone must bear the \u201cheavy burden [that] rests on those who would attack the judgment of the representatives of the people.\u201d Gregg, 428 U. S., at 175. If the Court is unwilling to say that precedent compels today\u2019s decision, perhaps it should reconsider that decision.\nIn any event, the Court\u2019s holding does not follow from Roper and Graham. Those cases undoubtedly stand for the proposition that teenagers are less mature, less responsible, and less fixed in their ways than adults\u2014not that a Supreme Court case was needed to establish that. What they do not stand for, and do not even suggest, is that legislators\u2014who also know that teenagers are different from adults\u2014may not require life without parole for juveniles who commit the worst types of murder.\nThat Graham does not imply today\u2019s result could not be clearer. In barring life without parole for juvenile nonhomi-cide offenders, Graham stated that \u201c[t]here is a line \u2018between homicide and other serious violent offenses against the individual.\u2019\u201d 560 U. S., at 69 (quoting Kennedy, 554 U. S., at 438). The whole point of drawing a line between one issue and another is to say that they are different and should be treated differently. In other words, the two are in different categories. Which Graham also said: \u201cdefendants who do not kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are categorically less deserving of the most serious forms of punishment than are murderers.\u201d 560 U. S., at 69 (emphasis added). Of course, to be especially clear that what is said about one issue does not apply to another, one could say that the two issues cannot be compared. Graham said that too: \u201cSerious nonhomicide crimes ... cannot be compared to murder.\u201d Ibid, (internal quotation marks omitted). A case that expressly puts an issue in a different category from its own subject, draws a line between the two, and states that the two should not be compared, cannot fairly be said to control that issue.\nRoper provides even less support for the Court\u2019s holding. In that case, the Court held that the death penalty could not be imposed for offenses committed by juveniles, no matter how serious their crimes. In doing so, Roper also set itself in a different category than these cases, by expressly invoking \u201cspecial\u201d Eighth Amendment analysis for death penalty cases. 543 U. S., at 568-569. But more importantly, Roper reasoned that the death penalty was not needed to deter juvenile murderers in part because \u201clife imprisonment without the possibility of parole\u201d was available. Id., at 572. In a classic bait and switch, the Court now tells state legislatures that\u2014Roper\u2019s promise notwithstanding\u2014they do not have power to guarantee that once someone commits a heinous murder, he will never do so again. It would be enough if today\u2019s decision proved Justice Scalia\u2019s prescience in writing that Roper\u2019s \u201creassurance .. . gives little comfort.\u201d Id., at 623 (dissenting opinion). To claim that Roper actually \u201cleads to\u201d revoking its own reassurance surely goes too far.\nToday\u2019s decision does not offer Roper and Graham\u2019s false promises of restraint. Indeed, the Court\u2019s opinion suggests that it is merely a way station on the path to further judicial displacement of the legislative role in prescribing appropriate punishment for crime. The Court\u2019s analysis focuses on the mandatory nature of the sentences in these cases. See ante, at 474-480. But then\u2014although doing so is entirely unnecessary to the rule it announces\u2014the Court states that even when a life without parole sentence is not mandatory, \u201cwe think appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible penalty will be uncommon.\u201d Ante, at 479. Today\u2019s holding may be limited to mandatory sentences, but the Court has already announced that discretionary life without parole for juveniles should be \u201cuncommon\u201d\u2014or, to use a common synonym, \u201cunusual.\u201d\nIndeed, the Court\u2019s gratuitous prediction appears to be nothing other than an invitation to overturn life without parole sentences imposed by j dries and trial judges. If that invitation is widely accepted and such sentences for juvenile offenders do in fact become \u201cuncommon,\u201d the Court will have bootstrapped its way to declaring that the Eighth Amendment absolutely prohibits them.\nThis process has no discernible end point\u2014or at least none consistent with our Nation\u2019s legal traditions. Roper and Graham attempted to limit their reasoning to the circumstances they addressed\u2014Roper to the death penalty, and Graham to nonhomicide crimes. Having cast aside those limits, the Court cannot now offer a credible substitute, and does not even try. After all, the Court tells us, \u201cnone of what [Graham] said about children ... is crime-specific.\u201d Ante, at 473. The principle behind today\u2019s decision seems to be only that because juveniles are different from adults, they must be sentenced differently. See ante, at 476-480. There is no clear reason that principle would not bar all mandatory sentences for juveniles, or any juvenile sentence as harsh as what a similarly situated adult would receive. Unless confined, the only stopping point for the Court\u2019s analysis would be never permitting juvenile offenders to be tried as adults. Learning that an Amendment that bars only \u201cunusual\u201d punishments requires the abolition of this uniformly established practice would be startling indeed.\nIt is a great tragedy when a juvenile commits murder\u2014 most of all for the innocent victims. But also for the murderer, whose life has gone so wrong so early. And for society as well, which has lost one or more of its members to deliberate violence, and must harshly punish another. In recent years, our society has moved toward requiring that the murderer, his age notwithstanding, be imprisoned for the remainder of his life. Members of this Court may disagree with that choice. Perhaps science and policy suggest society should show greater mercy to young killers, giving them a greater chance to reform themselves at the risk that they will kill again. See ante, at 471-474. But that is not our decision to make. Neither the text of the Constitution nor our precedent prohibits legislatures from requiring that juvenile murderers be sentenced to life without parole. I respectfully dissent.\nGraham stated that 123 prisoners were serving life without parole for nonhomieide offenses committed as juveniles, while in 2007 alone 380,480 juveniles were arrested for serious nonhomieide crimes. 560 U. S., at 64-65. I use 2,000 as the number of prisoners serving mandatory life without parole sentences for murders committed as juveniles, because all seem to accept that the number is at least that high. And the same source Graham used reports that 1,170 juveniles were arrested for murder and non-negligent homicide in 2009. Dept, of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, C. Puzzanchera & B. Adams, Juvenile Arrests 2009, p. 465 (Dec. 2011).\nThe Court\u2019s reference to discretionary sentencing practices is a distraction. See ante, at 483-484, n. 10. The premise of the Court\u2019s decision is that mandatory sentences are categorically different from discretionary ones. So under the Court\u2019s own logic, whether discretionary sentences are common or uncommon has nothing to do with whether mandatory sentences are unusual. In any event, if analysis of discretionary sentences were relevant, it would not provide objective support for today\u2019s decision. The Court states that \u201cabout 15% of all juvenile life-without-parole sentences\u201d\u2014meaning nearly 400 sentences\u2014were imposed at the discretion of a judge or jury. Ante, at 484, n. 10. Thus the number of discretionary life without parole sentences for juvenile murderers, relative to the number of juveniles arrested for murder, is about 1,000 times higher than the corresponding number in Graham.\nThe Court claims that I \u201ctake issue with some or all of these precedents\u201d and \u201cseek to relitigate\u201d them. Ante, at 470-471, n. 4. Not so: Applying this Court\u2019s cases exactly as they stand, I do not believe they support the Court\u2019s decision in these cases.",

        "text": "Justice Thomas,\nwith whom Justice Scalia joins, dissenting.\nToday, the Court holds that \u201cmandatory life without parole for those under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on \u2018cruel and unusual punishments.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 465. To reach that result, the Court relies on two lines of precedent. The first involves the categorical prohibition of certain punishments for specified classes of offenders. The second requires individualized sentencing in the capital punishment context. Neither line is consistent with the original understanding of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. The Court compounds its errors by combining these lines of precedent and extending them to reach a result that is even less legitimate than the foundation on which it is built. Because the Court upsets the legislatively enacted sentencing regimes of 29 jurisdictions without constitutional warrant, I respectfully dissent.\nI\nThe Court first relies on its cases \u201cadopt[ing] categorical bans on sentencing practices based on mismatches between the culpability of a class of offenders and the severity of a penalty.\u201d Ante, at 470. Of these categorical proportionality cases, the Court places particular emphasis on Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), and Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. 48 (2010). In Roper, the Court held that the Constitution prohibits the execution of an offender who was under 18 at the time of his offense. 543 U. S., at 578. The Roper Court looked to, among other things, its own sense of parental intuition and \u201cscientific and sociological studies\u201d to conclude that offenders under the age of 18 \u201ccannot with reliability be classified among the worst offenders.\u201d Id., at 569. In Graham, the Court relied on similar considerations to conclude that the Constitution prohibits a life-without-parole sentence for a nonhomicide offender who was under the age of 18 at the time of his offense. 560 U. S., at 74.\nThe Court now concludes that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for duly convicted juvenile murderers \u201ccon-traven[e] Graham\u2019s (and also Roper\u2019s) foundational principle: that imposition of a State\u2019s most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were not children.\u201d Ante, at 474. But neither Roper nor Graham held that specific procedural rules are required for sentencing juvenile homicide offenders. And, the logic of those cases should not be extended to create such a requirement.\nThe Eighth Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that: \u201cExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d As I have previously explained, \u201cthe Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was originally understood as prohibiting torturous methods of punishment\u2014specifically methods akin to those that had been considered cruel and unusual at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted.\u201d Graham, supra, at 99 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Clause does not contain a \u201cproportionality principle.\u201d Ewing v. California, 538 U. S. 11, 32 (2003) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); see generally Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 975-985 (1991) (opinion of Scalia, J.). In short, it does not authorize courts to invalidate any punishment they deem disproportionate to the severity of the crime or to a particular class of offenders. Instead, the Clause \u201cleaves the unavoidably moral question of who \u2018deserves\u2019 a particular nonprohibited method of punishment to the judgment of the legislatures that authorize the penalty.\u201d Graham, supra, at 101 (Thomas, J., dissenting).\nThe legislatures of Arkansas and Alabama, like those of 27 other jurisdictions, ante, at 482, have determined that all offenders convicted of specified homicide offenses, whether juveniles or not, deserve a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Nothing in our Constitution authorizes this Court to supplant that choice.\n1\u20141 )\u2014l\nTo invalidate mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles, the Court also relies on its cases \u201cprohibit[ing] mandatory imposition of capital punishment.\u201d Ante, at 470. The Court reasons that, because Graham compared juvenile life-without-parole sentences to the death penalty, the \u201cdistinctive set of legal rules\u201d that this Court has imposed in the capital punishment context, including the requirement of individualized sentencing, is \u201crelevant\u201d here. Ante, at 475. But even accepting an analogy between capital and juvenile life-without-parole sentences, this Court\u2019s cases prohibiting mandatory capital sentencing schemes have no basis in the original understanding of the Eighth Amendment, and, thus, cannot justify a prohibition of sentencing schemes that mandate life-without-parole sentences for juveniles.\nA\nIn a line of cases following Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972) (per curiam), this Court prohibited the mandatory imposition of the death penalty. See Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280 (1976) (plurality opinion); Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U. S. 325 (1976) (same); Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66 (1987). Furman first announced the principle that States may not permit sentencers to exercise unguided discretion in imposing the death penalty. See generally 408 U. S. 238. In response to Furman, many States passed new laws that made the death penalty mandatory following conviction of specified crimes, thereby eliminating the offending discretion. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 180-181 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). The Court invalidated those statutes in Woodson, Roberts, and Sumner. The Court reasoned that mandatory capital sentencing schemes were problematic, because they failed \u201cto allow the particularized consideration\u201d of \u201crelevant facets of the character and record of the individual offender or the circumstances of the particular offense.\u201d Woodson, supra, at 303-304 (plurality opinion).\nIn my view, Woodson and its progeny were wrongly decided. As discussed above, the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, as originally understood, prohibits \u201ctorturous methods of punishment.\u201d See Graham, 560 U. S., at 99 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is not concerned with whether a particular lawful method of punishment\u2014whether capital or noncapital\u2014is imposed pursuant to a mandatory or discretionary sentencing regime. See Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 371 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe prohibition of the Eighth Amendment relates to the character of the punishment, and not to the process by which it is imposed\u201d). In fact, \u201c[i]n the early days of the Republic,\u201d each crime generally had a defined punishment \u201cprescribed with specificity by the legislature.\u201d United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 45 (1978). Capital sentences, to which the Court analogizes, were treated no differently. \u201c [Mandatory death sentences abounded in our first Penal Code\u201d and were \u201ccommon in the several States\u2014 both at the time of the founding and throughout the 19th century.\u201d Harmelin, supra, at 994-995; see also Woodson, supra, at 289 (plurality opinion) (\u201cAt the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791, the States uniformly followed the common-law practice of making death the exclusive and mandatory sentence for certain specified offenses\u201d). Accordingly, the idea that the mandatory imposition of an otherwise-constitutional sentence renders that sentence cruel and unusual finds \u201cno support in the text and history of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d Harmelin, supra, at 994.\nMoreover, mandatory death penalty schemes were \u201ca perfectly reasonable legislative response to the concerns expressed in Furman\u201d regarding unguided sentencing discretion, in that they \u201celiminat[ed] explicit jury discretion and treat[ed] all defendants equally.\u201d Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 487 (1993) (Thomas, J., concurring). And, as Justice White explained more than 30 years ago, \u201ca State is not constitutionally forbidden to provide that the commission of certain crimes conclusively establishes that a criminal's character is such that he deserves death.\u201d Roberts, supra, at 358 (dissenting opinion). Thus, there is no basis for concluding that a mandatory capital sentencing scheme is unconstitutional. Because the Court\u2019s cases requiring individualized sentencing in the capital context are wrongly decided, they cannot serve as a valid foundation for the novel rule regarding mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles that the Court announces today.\nB\nIn any event, this Court has already declined to extend its individualized-sentencing rule beyond the death penalty context. In Harmelin, the defendant was convicted of possessing a large quantity of drugs. 501 U. S., at 961 (opinion of Scalia, J.). In accordance with Michigan law, he was sentenced to a mandatory term of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Ibid. Citing the same line of death penalty precedents on which the Court relies today, the defendant argued that his sentence, due to its mandatory nature, violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. Id., at 994-995 (opinion of the Court).\nThe Court rejected that argument, explaining that \u201c[tjhere can be no serious contention ... that a sentence which is not otherwise cruel and unusual becomes so simply because it is \u2018mandatory.\u2019\u201d Id., at 995. In so doing, the Court refused to analogize to its death penalty cases. The Court noted that those cases had \u201crepeatedly suggested that there is no comparable [individualized-sentencing] requirement outside the capital context, because of the qualitative difference between death and all other penalties.\u201d Ibid. The Court observed that, \u201ceven where the difference\u201d between a sentence of life without parole and other sentences of imprisonment \u201cis the greatest,\u201d such a sentence \u201ccannot be compared with death.\u201d Id., at 996. Therefore, the Court concluded that the line of cases requiring individualized sentencing had been drawn at capital cases, and that there was \u201cno basis for extending it further.\u201d Ibid.\nHarmelin\u2019s reasoning logically extends to these cases. Obviously, the younger the defendant, \u201cthe great[er]\u201d the difference between a sentence of life without parole and other terms of imprisonment. Ibid. But under Harmelin\u2019s, rationale, the defendant\u2019s age is immaterial to the Eighth Amendment analysis. Thus, the result in today\u2019s cases should be the same as that in Harmelin. Petitioners, like the defendant in Harmelin, were not sentenced to death. Accordingly, this Court\u2019s cases \u201ccreating and clarifying the individualized capital sentencing doctrine\u201d do not apply. Id., at 995 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nothing about our Constitution, or about the qualitative difference between any term of imprisonment and death, has changed since Harmelin was decided 21 years ago. What has changed (or, better yet, \u201cevolved\u201d) is this Court\u2019s ever-expanding line of categorical proportionality eases. The Court now uses Roper and Graham to jettison Harmelin\u2019s clear distinction between capital and noncapital cases and to apply the former to noncapital juvenile offenders. The Court\u2019s decision to do so is even less supportable than the precedents used to reach it.\nV-H HH f-H\nAs The Chief Justice notes, ante, at 500 (dissenting opinion), the Court lays the groundwork for future incursions on the States\u2019 authority to sentence criminals. In its categorical proportionality cases, the Court has considered \u201c \u2018objective indicia of society\u2019s standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice\u2019 to determine whether there is a national consensus against the sentencing practice at issue.\u201d Graham, 560 U. S., at 61 (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 563). In Graham, for example, the Court looked to \u201c[a]ctual sentencing practices\u201d to conclude that there was a national consensus against life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhomicide offenders. 560 U. S., at 62-65; see also Roper, supra, at 564-565; Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 316 (2002).\nToday, the Court makes clear that, even though its decision leaves intact the discretionary imposition of life-without-parole sentences for juvenile homicide offenders, it \u201cthink[s] appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to [life without parole] will be uncommon.\u201d Ante, at 479. That statement may well cause trial judges to shy away from imposing life-without-parole sentences and embolden appellate judges to set them aside when they are imposed. And, when a future petitioner seeks a categorical ban on sentences of life without parole for juvenile homicide offenders, this Court will most assuredly look to the \u201cactual sentencing practices\u201d triggered by these cases. The Court has, thus, gone from \u201cmerely\u201d divining the societal consensus of today to shaping the societal consensus of tomorrow.\n* \u215c *\nToday\u2019s decision invalidates a constitutionally permissible sentencing system based on nothing more than the Court\u2019s belief that \u201cits own sense of morality . . . pre-empts that of the people and their representatives.\u201d Graham, supra, at 124 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Because nothing in the Constitution grants the Court the authority it exercises today, I respectfully dissent.\nI join The Chief Justice\u2019s opinion because it accurately explains that, even accepting the Court\u2019s precedents, the Court\u2019s holding in today\u2019s cases is unsupportable.\nNeither the Court nor petitioners argue that petitioners' sentences would have been among \u201cthe \u2018modes or acts of punishment that had been considered cruel and unusual at the time that the Bill of Rights was adopted.\u2019 \u201d Graham, 560 U. S., at 106, n. 3 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 405 (1986)). Nor could they. Petitioners were 14 years old at the time they committed their crimes. When the Bill of Rights was ratified, 14-year-olds were subject to trial and punishment as adult offenders. See Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 609, n. 1 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Further, mandatory death sentences were common at that time. See Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 994-995 (1991). It is therefore implausible that a 14-year-old\u2019s mandatory prison sentence\u2014of any length, with or without parole\u2014would have been viewed as cruel and unusual.\nThe Court later extended Woodson, requiring that capital defendants be permitted to present, and sentencers in capital eases be permitted to consider, any relevant mitigating evidence, including the age of the defendant. See, e. g., Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 597-608 (1978) (plurality opinion); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110-112 (1982); Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4-5 (1986); Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 361-368 (1993). Whatever the validity of the requirement that sentencers be permitted to consider all mitigating evidence when deciding whether to impose a nonmandatory capital sentence, the Court certainly was wrong to prohibit mandatory capital sentences. See Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 488-500 (1993) (Thomas, J., concurring).\nIn support of its decision not to apply Harmelin to juvenile offenders, the Court also observes that \u201c \u2018[o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recognition that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature adults.\u2019\u201d Ante, at 481 (quoting J. D. B. v. North Carolina, 564 U. S. 261, 274 (2011); some internal quotation marks omitted). That is no doubt true as a general matter, but it does not justify usurping authority that rightfully belongs to the people by imposing a constitutional rule where none exists.",

        "text": "Justice Alito,\nwith whom Justice Scalia joins, dissenting.\nThe Court now holds that Congress and the legislatures of the 50 States are prohibited by the Constitution from identifying any category of murderers under the age of 18 who must be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Even a 17%-year-oId who sets off a bomb in a crowded mall or guns down a dozen students and teachers is a \u201cchild\u201d and must be given a chance to persuade a judge to permit his release into society. Nothing in the Constitution supports this arrogation of legislative authority.\nThe Court long ago abandoned the original meaning of the Eighth Amendment, holding instead that the prohibition of \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d embodies the \u201cevolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u201d Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion); see also Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. 48, 58 (2010); Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407, 419 (2008); Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.

S. 337, 346 (1981); Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976). Both the provenance and philosophical basis for this standard were problematic from the start. (Is it true that our society is inexorably evolving in the direction of greater and greater decency? Who says so, and how did this particular philosophy of history find its way into our fundamental law? And in any event, aren\u2019t elected representatives more likely than unaccountable judges to reflect changing societal standards?) But at least at the start, the Court insisted that these \u201cevolving standards\u201d represented something other than the personal views of five Justices. See Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 275 (1980) (explaining that \u201cthe Court\u2019s Eighth Amendment judgments should neither be nor appear to be merely the subjective views of individual Justices\u201d). Instead, the Court looked for objective indicia of our society\u2019s moral standards and the trajectory of our moral \u201cevolution.\u201d See id., at 274-275 (emphasizing that \u201c \u2018judgment should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent\u2019\u201d (quoting Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584, 592 (1977) (plurality opinion))).\nIn this search for objective indicia, the Court toyed with the use of public opinion polls, see Atkins, supra, at 316, n. 21, and occasionally relied on foreign law, see Roper v. Simmons, supra, at 575; Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, 796, n. 22 (1982); Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 830-831 (1988); Coker, 433 U. S., at 596, n. 10 (plurality opinion).\nIn the main, however, the staple of this inquiry was the tallying of the positions taken by state legislatures. Thus, in Coker, which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of the death penalty for the rape of an adult woman, the Court noted that only one State permitted that practice. Id., at 595-596. In Enmund, where the Court held that the Eighth Amendment forbids capital punishment for ordinary felony murder, both federal law and the law of 28 of the 36 States that authorized the death penalty at the time rejected that punishment. 458 U. S., at 789.\nWhile the tally in these early cases may be characterized as evidence of a national consensus, the evidence became weaker and weaker in later cases. In Atkins, which held that low-IQ defendants may not be sentenced to death, the Court found an anti-death-penalty consensus even though more than half of the States that allowed capital punishment permitted the practice. See 536 U. S., at 342 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (observing that less than half of the 38 States that permit capital punishment have enacted legislation barring execution of the mentally retarded). The Court attempted to get around this problem by noting that there was a pronounced trend against this punishment. See id., at 313-315 (listing 18 States that had amended their laws since 1986 to prohibit the execution of mentally retarded persons).\nThe importance of trend evidence, however, was not long lived. In Roper, which outlawed capital punishment for defendants between the ages of 16 and 18, the lineup of the States was the same as in Atkins, but the trend in favor of abolition\u2014five States during the past 15 years\u2014was less impressive. Roper, 543 U. S., at 564-565. Nevertheless, the Court held that the absence of a strong trend in support of abolition did not matter. See id., at 566 (\u201cAny difference between this case and Atkins with respect to the pace of abolition is thus counterbalanced by the consistent direction of the change\u201d).\nIn Kennedy v. Louisiana, the Court went further. Holding that the Eighth Amendment prohibits capital punishment for the brutal rape of a 12-year-old girl, the Court disregarded a nascent legislative trend in favor of permitting capital punishment for this narrowly defined and heinous crime. See 554 U. S., at 433 (explaining that, although \u201cthe total number of States to have made child rape a capital offense ... is six,\u201d \u201c[t)his is not an indication of a trend or change in direction comparable to the one supported by data in Roper\u201d). The Court felt no need to see whether this trend developed further\u2014perhaps because true moral evolution can lead in only one direction. And despite the argument that the rape of a young child may involve greater depravity than some murders, the Court proclaimed that homicide is categorically different from all (or maybe almost all) other offenses. See id., at 438 (stating that nonhomi-cide crimes, including child rape, \u201cmay be devastating in their harm . . . but in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public, they cannot be compared to murder in their severity and irrevocability\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). As the Court had previously put it, \u201cdeath is different.\u201d Ford, supra, at 411 (plurality opinion).\nTwo years after Kennedy, in Graham v. Florida, any pretense of heeding a legislative consensus was discarded. In Graham, federal law and the law of 37 States and the District of Columbia permitted a minor to be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for nonhomicide crimes, but despite this unmistakable evidence of a national consensus, the Court held that the practice violates the Eighth Amendment. See 560 U. S., at 97 (Thomas, J., dissenting). The Court, however, drew a distinction between minors who murder and minors who commit other heinous offenses, so at least in that sense the principle that death is different lived on.\nToday, that principle is entirely put to rest, for here we are concerned with the imposition of a term of imprisonment on offenders who kill. The two (carefully selected) cases before us concern very young defendants, and despite the brutality and evident depravity exhibited by at least one of the petitioners, it is hard not to feel sympathy for a 14-year-old sentenced to life without the possibility of release. But no one should be confused by the particulars of the two cases before us. The category of murderers that the Court delicately calls \u201cchildren\u201d (murderers under the age of 18) consists overwhelmingly of young men who are fast approaching the legal age of adulthood. Evan Miller and Kuntrell Jackson are anomalies; much more typical are murderers like Christopher Simmons, who committed a brutal thrill-killing just seven months shy of his 18th birthday. Roper, supra, at 556.\nSeventeen-year-olds commit a significant number of murders every year, and some of these crimes are incredibly brutal. Many of these murderers are at least as mature as the average 18-year-old. See Thompson, supra, at 854 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that maturity may \u201cvary widely among different individuals of the same age\u201d). Congress and the legislatures of 43 States have concluded that at least some of these murderers should be sentenced to prison without parole, and 28 States and the Federal Government have decided that for some of these offenders life without parole should be mandatory. See ante, at 482-483, and nn. 9-10. The majority of this Court now overrules these legislative judgments.\nIt is true that, at least for now, the Court apparently permits a trial judge to make an individualized decision that a particular minor convicted of murder should be sentenced to life without parole, but do not expect this possibility to last very long. The majority goes out of its way to express the view that the imposition of a sentence of life without parole on a \u201cchild\u201d (i. e., a murderer under the age of 18) should be uncommon. Having held in Graham that a trial judge with discretionary sentencing authority may not impose a sentence of life without parole on a minor who has committed a nonhomicide offense, the Justices in the majority may soon extend that holding to minors who commit murder. We will see.\nWhat today\u2019s decision shows is that our Eighth Amendment cases are no longer tied to any objective indicia of society\u2019s standards. Our Eighth Amendment case law is now entirely inward looking. After entirely disregarding objective indicia of our society\u2019s standards in Graham, the Court now extrapolates from Graham. Future cases may extrapolate from today\u2019s holding, and this process may continue until the majority brings sentencing'practices into line with whatever the majority views as truly evolved standards of decency.\nThe Eighth Amendment imposes certain limits on the sentences that may be imposed in criminal cases, but for the most part it leaves questions of sentencing policy to be determined by Congress and the state legislatures\u2014and with good reason. Determining the length of imprisonment that is appropriate for a particular offense and a particular offender inevitably involves a balancing of interests. If imprisonment does nothing else, it removes the criminal from the general population and prevents him from committing additional crimes in the outside world. When a legislature prescribes that a category of killers must be sentenced to life imprisonment, the legislature, which presumably reflects the views of the electorate, is taking the position that the risk that these offenders will kill again outweighs any countervailing consideration, including reduced culpability due to immaturity or the possibility of rehabilitation. When the majority of this Court countermands that democratic decision, what the majority is saying is that members of society must be exposed to the risk that these convicted murderers, if released from custody, will murder again.\nUnless our cases change course, we will continue to march toward some vision of evolutionary culmination that the Court has not yet disclosed. The Constitution does not authorize us to take the country on this journey.\nBetween 2002 and 2010, 17-year-olds committed an average combined total of 424 murders and nonnegligent homicides per year. See Dept, of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, \u00a74, Arrests, Age of persons arrested (Table 4.7).\nAs the Court noted in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 366 (1989), Congress passed the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 to eliminate discretionary sentencing and parole because it concluded that these practices had led to gross abuses. The Senate Report for the 1984 bill rejected what it called the \u201coutmoded rehabilitation model\u201d for federal criminal sentencing. S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 38 (1983). According to the Report, \u201calmost everyone involved in the criminal justice system now doubts that rehabilitation can be induced reliably in a prison setting, and it is now quite certain that no one can really detect whether or when a prisoner is rehabilitated.\u201d Ibid. The Report also \u201cobserved that the indeterminate-sentencing system had two \u2018unjustifi[ed]\u2019 and \u2018shameful\u2019 consequences. The first was the great variation among sentences imposed by the different judges upon similarly situated offenders. The second was uncertainty as to the time the offender would spend in prison. Each was a serious impediment to an evenhanded and effective operation of the criminal justice system.\u201d Mistretta, supra, at 366 (quoting S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 38, 65 (citation omitted)).",
