            "opinion_text": "\nOPINION and JUDGMENT\nDALTON, District Judge.\nThis case comes before the court upon a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed in forma pauperis by Alphonsus McNeil under the provisions of 28 U.S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241, 2254. Petitioner is now being detained pursuant to a judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of Alexandria (formerly Corporation Court) of March 18, 1971, wherein he was convicted of attempted robbery and sentenced to a term of ten years in the Virginia State Penitentiary (two years of that term were suspended upon good behavi- or).\nAs McNeil\u2019s initial petition to this count did not present any factual allegations cognizable in a habeas corpus proceeding and was more in the nature of a treatise on constitutional law than a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, this court appointed petitioner competent counsel to ascertain the basis of his petition. After consulting with petitioner, his appointed counsel has ascertained that his contentions are the following: he was accorded ineffective court-appointed counsel in the state court; he was not allowed to retain counsel of his own choosing at his preliminary hearing; he was not allowed to waive his preliminary hearing; the warrants against him were insufficient; he was denied the right to a speedy trial; the length of his sentence represents cruel and unusual punishment; and as a matter of due process, he should not have been convicted in light of his history of alcoholism and other problems.\n*707Only the last mentioned of petitioner\u2019s contentions in the above list will be considered by this court, as none of the others have yet been presented in any form to the Supreme Court of Virginia. Such exhaustion of available state remedies is required pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Petitioner has not filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the Supreme Court of Virginia, but- his trial counsel did file a petition for a writ of error with that court on July 19, 1971, (it was denied on November 17, 1971) presenting the following arguments:\n1. That the trial court\u2019s findings arbitrarily ignored uncontradicted and stipulated medical evidence that the petitioner was an alcoholic.\n2. That petitioner\u2019s drunkenness during the course of his attempted robbery was the product of his alcoholism.\n3. \u25a0 That alcoholism is a defense to a crime requiring specific intent, and that petitioner was not capable of forming or entertaining the requisite specific intent necessary to sustain a conviction for attempted robbery.\nThe court will consider petitioner\u2019s contention that his alcoholism is a defense to the crime of attempted robbery to the extent that that argument was presented to the Supreme Court of Virginia. It is understood that petitioner does not deny that he attempted the robbery, but rather contends that his actions are excusable because he was acting under the influence of alcohol.\nUpon the motion of his trial counsel, petitioner was committed to Southwestern State Hospital, Marion, Virginia, on February 25, 1970, for observation of his alcoholic and mental status and for an evaluation of his competency to stand trial. By a report dated April 28, 1970, the superintendent and clinical director of that hospital notified the trial court of the results of the observation: there was no indication of any psychosis, though in the opinion of the clinical director petitioner had probably suffered delirium tremens at times in the past. The official diagnoses were of \u201calcoholism, alcohol addiction\u201d and \u201csocial maladjustments without manifest psychiatric disorder, dissocial behavior.\u201d He was deemed mentally competent to stand trial and to testify in his own defense. It was this report, which was stipulated into evidence at petitioner\u2019s trial, which his counsel used as the basis for making a commendable, but fruitless, effort to convince the trial judge that petitioner lacked the requisite specific intent to be convicted of attempted robbery. Unfortunately for petitioner, however, Virginia adheres to the minority rule that:\nVoluntary drunkenness, where it has not produced permanent insanity, is never an excuse for crime; except, where a party is charged with murder, if it appears that the accused was too drunk to be capable of deliberating and premeditating, then he can be convicted only of murder in the second degree. Gills v. Commonwealth, 141 Va. 445, 450, 126 S.E. 51, 53 (1925).\nThis passage from Gills was most recently cited with approval by the Supreme Court of Virginia in Chittum v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 12, 174 S.E.2d 779 (1970), in which the defendant was convicted of attempted rape, even though he was allegedly intoxicated. See the case of Brenan v. Commonwealth, 183 Va. 846, 33 S.E.2d 639 (1945), involving a prosecution for robbery, in which the Supreme Court upheld the trial court\u2019s rejection for lack of substantiating evidence an instruction to the effect that if the defendant was too drunk to entertain a specific intent to rob he could not be found guilty. The court stated that \u201c[ejven if there had been evidence of drunkenness, under the decisions of this court, it would have been no excuse for the crime.\u201d\nThis court must likewise conclude after reviewing the trial transcript that there is ample evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that petitioner\u2019s alcoholism had not led him to such a mental state \u2014 i.e., permanent insanity\u2014 *708as would be a defense to a crime requiring specific intent under Virginia law. Petitioner testified that he had imbibed about two pints of wine and seven thyroxine pills (a depressant which he had been prescribed to take in a quantity of one pill every four hours) within a few hours of the time when he attempted the robbery. On the basis of his testimony, petitioner\u2019s past conduct, a history of a head injury some years previously, and the official diagnosis of \u201calcohol addiction,\u201d petitioner\u2019s trial counsel argued that petitioner was \u201cinvoluntarily drunk\u201d and therefore could not be held accountable for his actions. The trial judge, however, found as a matter of fact that petitioner\u2019s drunkenness was voluntary \u2014 he had imbibed the wine while playing pinochle with friends, and was able to testify very lucidly, albeit selectively, as the trial judge commented, about most of the events that transpired before and during the attempted robbery. Considering these circumstances, petitioner\u2019s condition clearly fell short of the \u201cpermanent insanity\u201d test under Virginia law, as the trial judge so found.\nEven though the Virginia standard for such a defense is seemingly harsh, it is not at variance with pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court. In Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514, 88 S.Ct. 2145, 20 L.Ed.2d 1254 (1968), reh. denied, 393 U.S. 898, 89 S.Ct. 65, 21 L.Ed.2d 185 (1968), the majority of the Court refused to accept the defense of chronic alcoholism to a charge of public drunkenness. The court declined to formulate such a defense in constitutional terms, preferring to leave it to the experience and experimentation of the states. Justice Marshall, writing for the majority, stated:\nThe doctrines of actus reus, mens rea, insanity, mistake, justification, and duress have historically provided the tools for a constantly shifting adjustment of the tension between the evolving aims of the criminal law and changing religious, moral, philosophical, and medical views of the nature of man. This process of adjustment has always been thought to be the province of the States.\nNothing could be less fruitful than for this Court to be impelled into defining some sort of insanity test in constitutional terms. 392 U.S. at 536.\nAnd, as Justice Black, in his concurrence in Powell v. Texas, states at 392 U.S. 540:\nAlmost all of the traditional purposes of the criminal law can be significantly served by punishing the person who in fact committed the proscribed act, without regard to whether his action was \u201ccompelled\u201d by some elusive \u201cirresponsible\u201d aspect of his personality.\nFor the above reasons, it is adjudged and ordered that the petition for a writ of habeas corpus be, and the same is hereby denied and ordered dismissed.\n",
