Thornburg in Buncombe County Superior Court.\n\nHeard in the Court of Appeals 21 May 2014.\n\n\n    Attorney General Roy Cooper, by Assistant Attorney General\n    LaShawn S. Piquant, for the State.\n\n    M. Alexander Charns for defendant-appellant.\n\n\n    BRYANT, Judge.\n\n\n    Where a physician testified to common characteristics she\n\nhad observed in sexually abused children, the trial court did\n\nnot err in allowing her testimony, and where the trial court\n\ndenied the State\u2019s motion to hold defense counsel in criminal\n\ncontempt, defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel.\n\n    On 12 September 2011, a Buncombe County Grand Jury indicted\n\ndefendant on thirteen counts of indecent liberties with a child,\n\f                                      -2-\ntwo counts of rape of a child by an adult, and eleven counts of\n\nstatutory rape.        Each indictment alleged that the victim was\n\nKimberly1, a girl age twelve or thirteen years old depending on\n\nthe date of the offense.        A jury trial commenced during the 7\n\nJanuary 2013 Criminal Session of Buncombe County Superior Court,\n\nthe Honorable Alan Z. Thornburg, Judge presiding.\n\n    The evidence presented tended to show that Kimberly was\n\nborn in 1997 and that she had two younger brothers.                 From the\n\ntime she was six months old, Kimberly lived with her paternal\n\ngrandmother.      In   2009,   when    she   was   twelve   years   of   age,\n\nKimberly left her grandmother\u2019s residence and went to live with\n\nher mother and two brothers.          Kimberly\u2019s mother was living with\n\ndefendant Joshua Neal King, whom she later married.            Living with\n\nher mother provided Kimberly with more freedom: \u201cI got to go out\n\nwith my friends a lot more. They got to come over a lot more. I\n\nused to drink and do drugs.\u201d           Kimberly testified that she and\n\nher mother used drugs together.\n\n    On the evening of 16 March 2010, Kimberly\u2019s mother was at\n\nwork; Kimberly was at home with defendant and her two brothers.\n\n         A.    . . . I went to bed earlier that night\n               and woke up and [defendant] was on top\n               of me, and I had all my clothes off and\n\n1\n  Pursuant to Rule 3.1(b) of our Rules of Appellate Procedure, we\nuse a pseudonym to protect the identity of the juvenile.\n\f                                   -3-\n                I was in their bed.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Q.    Do you remember what he had on?\n\n          A.    A shirt.\n\n          . . .\n\n          Q.    And what happened?\n\n          A.    He did what I said he did.\n\n          Q.    Okay. Is that when you said that he put\n                his penis in your vagina?\n\n          A.    Yes.\n\n          Q.    What did you do?\n\n          A.    I yelled for my brother.\n\nKimberly testified that defendant had her perform sexual acts on\n\nmany occasions from March through August 2010.\n\n    Detective     David     Shroat,       working       in   the     Criminal\n\nInvestigations Unit of the Buncombe County Sheriff\u2019s Department,\n\nbecame involved with the case on 30 August 2010 after receiving\n\na report from the Department of Social Services.                   Detective\n\nShroat testified that per the report, \u201c[Kimberly\u2019s] mother was\n\nworking nights and [Kimberly] went to bed.          And at some point in\n\ntime, she woke up and [defendant] was on top of her, and she\n\nscreamed.\u201d      Detective   Shroat       spoke   with    defendant    on   21\n\nSeptember 2010.   After having his statement transcribed and read\n\f                                                 -4-\nback    to   him,       defendant          verbally     acknowledged           his       words      and\n\nsigned his name to the statement.                       The statement was admitted at\n\ntrial.\n\n       Per his statement, defendant \u201cdrunk probably a twelve pack\u201d\n\none night; he told the children to go to sleep; and he went to\n\nbed.     At some point, defendant thought his wife had gotten into\n\nthe bed.      \u201cI discovered it was [Kimberly] . . . I told her to go\n\nback to her room. . . . I did rub on her under the blanket with\n\nmy penis. I don\u2019t know if I penetrated her or not.\u201d                                      Defendant\n\ndid    not   admit       to     any    other      instance            of   sexual       contact       or\n\nactivity with Kimberly.\n\n       Pediatrician            Dr.     Sarah     Monahan-Estes,              working          at     the\n\nMission      Children\u2019s         Hospital,        examined         Kimberly      on       29    August\n\n2012.        Dr.    Monahan-Estes            testified           to    the   results          of     her\n\nexamination        and    in        part    to   common          characteristics          she        had\n\nobserved in sexually abused children.\n\n       Following         the    close       of    the       evidence,        the     jury          found\n\ndefendant not guilty on twenty-five charges and found defendant\n\nguilty on one count of indecent liberties with a child occurring\n\non 16 March 2010.              The jury also found as an aggravating factor\n\nthat    \u201cDefendant        took        advantage        of    a    position         of    trust        or\n\nconfidence     .    .     .    to     commit     the    offense.\u201d            The     trial         court\n\f                                             -5-\nentered     judgment       in    accordance          with      the   jury          verdict    and\n\nsentenced    defendant          to   an     active      term    of   16       to    20   months.\n\nDefendant appeals.\n\n                           ________________________________\n\n      On    appeal,    defendant           raises       the    following           issues:    (I)\n\nwhether     the    trial    court         erred    by    allowing         a    physician       to\n\ntestify;     and     (II)       whether       defendant         received            ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.\n\n                                                   I\n\n      Defendant       first      argues      that       the    trial      court       erred    in\n\nallowing     Dr.    Monahan-Estes,            the       pediatrician           who       examined\n\nKimberly following her report of sexual assaults, to testify as\n\nto Kimberly\u2019s veracity.               Specifically, defendant contends that\n\nDr. Monahan-Estes\u2019 written report, which was published to the\n\njury, explained why Kimberly did not initially tell the whole\n\ntruth and that Dr. Monahan-Estes\u2019 testimony presumed Kimberly\n\nwas telling the truth and presumed a history of sexual abuse.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n      Defendant cites the opinion of this Court in State v. Ryan\n\nfor   the     proposition            that     \u201c[o]ur          appellate        courts         have\n\nconsistently held that the testimony of an expert to the effect\n\nthat a prosecuting witness is believable, credible, or telling\n\f                                            -6-\nthe truth is inadmissible evidence.\u201d                      ___ N.C. App. ___, ___,\n\n734 S.E.2d 598, 604 (2012) (citation and quotations omitted),\n\nrev. dismissed, 366 N.C. 433, 736 S.E.2d 188, and writ denied,\n\nrev. denied, 366 N.C. 433, 736 S.E.2d 189 (2013).\n\n    Initially, we note that Dr. Monahan-Estes was not formally\n\nqualified as an expert.               To address this discrepancy, we find\n\nguidance      in   the    opinion      of   our    Supreme       Court     in     State    v.\n\nAguallo,    322    N.C.     818,      370   S.E.2d    676      (1988),      wherein       the\n\ndefendant      challenged       the     admission         of     testimony        from    two\n\nwitnesses     addressing        the   typical      characteristics          of     sexually\n\nabused children.          One witness, a Department of Social Services\u2019\n\ncase worker, having been employed as such for fourteen years,\n\nhad investigated between twenty-five and thirty cases of child\n\nsexual abuse.            The victim confided in the witness about the\n\nabuse   the    defendant        had    inflicted.          The    second     witness,       a\n\nSheriff\u2019s Department juvenile investigator, had been employed as\n\nsuch for seven years and had investigated over one hundred cases\n\nof child sexual abuse.             Id. at 820\u201421, 370 S.E.2d at 677.                      The\n\ndefendant      argued      on   appeal      that    the    evidence        was     improper\n\nbecause \u201cthe witnesses were not qualified as experts and                                   []\n\ntheir   testimony        fail[ed]     as    lay    opinion       because     it    was    not\n\nrationally based on the perceptions of the witness.\u201d                                Id. at\n\f                                         -7-\n820, 370 S.E.2d at 677.            Our Supreme Court reasoned that \u201c[i]t\n\n[was] evident that the nature of their jobs and the experience\n\nwhich [the witnesses] possessed made them better qualified than\n\nthe jury to form an opinion as to the characteristics of abused\n\nchildren.\u201d      Id. at     821, 370 S.E.2d at 677.                The Court went on\n\nto hold that \u201cthe finding that [each] witness [was] an expert is\n\nimplicit   in    the     trial    court's      ruling    admitting       the   opinion\n\ntestimony.\u201d Id.; see also N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 702(a)\n\n(2013) (\u201cIf scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge\n\nwill assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\n\ndetermine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by\n\nknowledge,      skill,     experience,         training,    or      education,     may\n\ntestify thereto in the form of an opinion . . . .\u201d).\n\n    Dr.    Monahan-Estes\u2019         testimony      began     with    her   educational\n\nbackground,     including        where   she    completed     her     undergraduate\n\nstudies, her medical school education, where she completed her\n\npediatric residency, and where she completed an additional two-\n\nyear fellowship in child abuse pediatrics \u2013 during which she saw\n\nonly sexually abused, physically abused, or neglected children.\n\nDr. Monahan-Estes testified that she currently worked in a child\n\nabuse clinic seeing children who are suspected of having any\n\nhistory of sexual abuse, physical abuse or neglect.                       During the\n\f                                      -8-\ncourse of the investigation into allegations of sexual abuse,\n\nDr. Monahan-Estes interviewed Kimberly.\n\n       At trial, Dr. Monahan-Estes testified that when a child is\n\nsuspected of suffering from abuse, \u201cyou want to assure that they\n\ndon't have any injuries or issues that are resulting because of\n\nthat    abuse   that    need     medical    attention     or   mental    health\n\nattention.\u201d     Dr. Monahan-Estes testified to the typical process\n\nshe goes through in performing a child medical evaluation, with\n\nspecific regard to an evaluation done where sexual abuse is\n\nsuspected.      She    also     testified    to   the   limitations     of   the\n\nexamination     and    common    behaviors    she   has    observed     in   her\n\nexperience.\n\n           [W]e very rarely see kids who [sic] the\n           abuse or trauma has occurred and then they\n           immediately tell someone so we can examine\n           them. . . .    In the cases that I typically\n           see   in  clinic,   these  disclosures  have\n           occurred days, weeks, months, years after\n           the sexual abuse has occurred . . . .\n\n           . . .\n\n           [W]e see all kinds of        behavioral and\n           emotional\n           dysfunction or disorders in children who\n           have a history of sexual abuse. These kids\n           typically have an increased frequency of\n           being depressed or having mental health\n           issues, substance abuse. They tend to act\n           out, aggressive behavioral issues in school.\n           They have increased risk of school failure.\n           These children typically get in trouble with\n\f                                             -9-\n              the law, delinquency, they'll be arrested,\n              they sexually act out. There's a whole host\n              of issues that are increased in children who\n              have a history of sexual abuse.\n\n       We   hold        that    the   trial     court\u2019s     qualification      of    Dr.\n\nMonahan-Estes as an expert in pediatric medicine as well as the\n\nevaluation and treatment of child sexual abuse is implicit in\n\nthe trial court\u2019s admission of her testimony regarding common\n\nbehaviors in children who have suffered from sexual abuse.\n\n       In challenging the admission of Dr. Monahan-Estes\u2019 written\n\nreport into evidence, defendant contends that Dr. Monahan-Estes\n\n\u201cexplained        why    [Kimberly]       didn\u2019t     initially   tell    the    entire\n\ntruth.\u201d       We first note that defendant did not object to the\n\nadmission of the report at trial.                    Thus, the admission of this\n\nevidence would be subject to plain error review only, and upon\n\nthe request of defendant.              Defendant has failed to request plain\n\nerror review of this issue.                  Further, defendant has failed to\n\nmake Dr. Monahan-Estes\u2019 report a part of the record on appeal.\n\nTherefore, we are precluded from considering the contents of the\n\nreport,     and    we    must     consider    defendant\u2019s     argument    abandoned.\n\nSee N.C. R. App. P. 9(a) (\u201cIn appeals from the trial division of\n\nthe General Court of Justice, review is solely upon the record\n\non appeal . . . .\u201d); Neal v. Craig Brown, Inc., 86 N.C. App.\n\n157,   161,    356       S.E.2d    912,   915      (1987)   (\u201cThis   Court     may   not\n\f                               -10-\nconsider documents which have not properly been made a part of\n\nthe record on appeal.\u201d (citing Elliott v. Goss, 254 N.C. 508,\n\n119 S.E.2d 192 (1961))).\n\n    Defendant    challenges   Dr.     Monahan-Estes\u2019   testimony   as\n\npresuming that Kimberly was telling the truth.         Specifically,\n\ndefendant challenges the following:\n\n         Q.   . . . In your training and experience,\n         are there reasons that you have personally\n         observed that children may not always tell\n         all of the allegations to start?\n\n         . . .\n\n         THE WITNESS: Yes. It's very common that a\n         child either does not initially disclose or\n         only partially discloses.\n\n         One of the biggest issues is frequently the\n         alleged   perpetrator is a parent or a\n         parental figure or someone that they love\n         and trust, so they don't want to get them in\n         trouble. They're ashamed, they're afraid,\n         they've been threatened or bribed to try not\n         to disclose.\n\n         If another family member who is not the\n         alleged perpetrator, but say another parent\n         or another parental figure doesn't believe\n         the child, then they'll frequently encourage\n         them not to tell, or children sometimes \u2013\n         there will be negative consequences to their\n         disclosure. So they tell a little bit about\n         what happens and then all kinds of things\n         come into play.

Kennedy, 320 N.C. 20, 357 S.E.2d 359 (1987),\n\nstated\n\n             that expert testimony on the symptoms and\n             characteristics of sexually abused children\n             is   admissible   to  assist  the   jury in\n             understanding   the  behavior   patterns of\n             sexually abused children. Furthermore, [the\n             Court] allowed evidence that a particular\n             child\u2019s symptoms were consistent with those\n             of sexual or physical abuse victims, but\n             only to aid the jury in assessing the\n             complainant's credibility.\n\nState v. Hall, 330 N.C. 808, 817, 412 S.E.2d 883, 887 (1992)\n\n(citation omitted); compare State v.

Therefore, as there was no\n\nerror    by   the    trial    court    in     allowing   the   testimony     of   Dr.\n\nMonahan-Estes, defendant\u2019s argument is overruled.\n\n                                               II\n\n    Next, defendant argues he was denied effective assistance\n\nof counsel.         Specifically, the trial court\u2019s denial of defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s     request     for    an     evening     recess     following     defense\n\ncounsel having to defend himself against a criminal contempt\n\ncharge    prejudiced         defense     counsel\u2019s       ability    to     represent\n\ndefendant.

This requires showing that\n                counsel's error were so serious as to\n                deprive the defendant of a fair trial,\n                a trial whose result is reliable.\n\nState v. Braswell, 312 N.C. 553, 562, 324 S.E.2d 241, 248 (1985)\n\n(quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 80 L. Ed.\n\n2d 674, 694 (1984)); see also, e.g., Choudhry, 365 N.C. at 219,\n\n717 S.E.2d at 352 (\u201c[W]hen the claim of ineffective assistance\n\nis based upon an actual, as opposed to a potential, conflict of\n\ninterest . . . a defendant may not be required to demonstrate\n\nprejudice    under   Strickland    to    obtain   relief.\u201d   (citations\n\nomitted)).\n\n    Defendant\u2019s argument is predicated on the assertion that\n\ndefense counsel was burdened by a conflict of interest; however,\n\nthe record does not reveal such a conflict.\n\n    On 9 January 2010, in the morning of the third day of\n\ntrial, the prosecutor filed a motion requesting that defense\n\ncounsel be held in criminal contempt as well as a corresponding\n\f                                           -14-\nmotion for a mistrial following defendant\u2019s cross-examination of\n\nthe   victim     the     day   before.       In     its    motion,        the    prosecutor\n\ncontended that following an in camera hearing to address the\n\nadmissibility of evidence in light of Rule 412, \u201cRape or sex\n\noffense cases; relevance of victim's past behavior,\u201d and the\n\ntrial    court\u2019s    exclusion     of     the      evidence       proffered,       defendant\n\nproceeded to question Kimberly about her prior sexual encounters\n\nin violation of the court\u2019s order.                       A hearing on the State\u2019s\n\nmotion was held that morning.               A review of the trial transcript\n\nreveals    a    brief     hearing.       The      State        presented    its    motion;\n\ndefense counsel introduced an attorney who would represent him;\n\ndefense    counsel\u2019s       attorney      notified         the     court    that    he    was\n\nunfamiliar with any of the underlying facts                           \u2013    including the\n\nallegations in the State\u2019s motion, and asked that if the trial\n\ncourt was \u201cseriously considering\u201d the motion that the hearing be\n\npostponed.         The    State   consented         to     a    postponement       of    the\n\nhearing;    at    which    point,     the      trial      court    declared       that   the\n\nState\u2019s motion was one for direct contempt and that the court\n\nhad reviewed the transcript of defense counsel\u2019s examination.\n\nThe     trial    court    ruled     that     defense        counsel       \u201cdid    not    act\n\nwillfully or with gross negligence, and the acts were not done\n\ndeliberately and purposefully in violation of the law without\n\f                                          -15-\nregard or justification or excuse, and [this court] fails to\n\nfind him in contempt of court.\u201d                    The trial court subsequently\n\ndenied    the     State\u2019s    motion    for     a    mistrial.      Following       this\n\ndenial,    defense       counsel   asked     for    an   adjournment:       \u201cI'm   very\n\noffended by this and it's sort of knocked me off my game, if you\n\nwill. And I don't want to be sitting here thinking about my\n\nissues    about     this    when    I'm    supposed      to   be   giving    my    best\n\ninterest     to     my     client.\u201d        Defense       counsel     requested       an\n\nadjournment until the next morning \u201cto kind of calm down and get\n\nover this[.]\u201d        At 11:38 a.m., the trial court called a recess\n\nuntil 2:00 p.m.\n\n      We see no conflict of interest between trial counsel and\n\ndefendant.        Furthermore, defendant neither points to an error\n\ncommitted as a result of trial counsel\u2019s participation in the\n\ncriminal contempt hearing nor asserts what burden would have\n\nbeen alleviated by an overnight recess.                  Even though counsel was\n\nthe subject of a contempt hearing during his representation of\n\ndefendant, counsel was found to be not in contempt of court.\n\nThere is nothing in the record to support defendant\u2019s assertion\n\nof a conflict of interest.            On the contrary, defendant was found\n\nnot guilty on twenty-five of twenty-six charges considered by\n\nthe   jury.         Defense        counsel\u2019s       zealous      representation       of\n\f                                -16-\ndefendant, clearly revealed in the record, can in no way be\n\ndeemed ineffective based on a conflict of interest or any other\n\ntheory.    Defendant has failed to show that defense counsel\u2019s\n\nperformance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\n\nSee   Braswell,   312   N.C.   at   561\u201462,   324   S.E.2d   at   248.\n\nAccordingly, we overrule defendant\u2019s argument.\n\n      No error.\n\n      Judges CALABRIA and GEER concur.\n\f",
