In addition, we reverse the court of appeal\u2019s\n                  determination that William Serigne is entitled to a new trial\n                  based on a Brady violation, which issue was never passed on by\n                  the trial court, and we reinstate his convictions and sentences.\n                  However, we also remand to the district court for further\n                  proceedings to determine if Lionel and William are entitled to\n                  new trials based on undisclosed Brady material in the grand jury\n                  testimony.

BERNARD\n\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n      In 2009, 39-year-old D.A. accused her cousins William and Lionel Sergine\n\nof sexually abusing her when she was a child. Other family members, B.M. and\n\nM.S., also came forward to accuse William Serigne of sexually abusing them.\n\nBecause of these accusations, Lionel was indicted for the aggravated rape of D.A.\n\ncommitted before 1981. William was separately indicted for the aggravated rape of\n\nD.A. based on an allegation of \u201coral sexual intercourse\u201d committed in or after\n\n1981, sexual battery of B.M., and aggravated incest of his daughter, M.S.\n\n      After the trial court denied the state\u2019s motion to try the defendants together,\n\nthe state convened a second grand jury and obtained a new indictment. Lionel was\n\nindicted for the aggravated rape of D.A., committed between the years of 1976 and\n\n1983, in which William was alleged to have jointly participated. William was\n\nindicted for two counts of the aggravated rape of D.A., committed between the\n\nyears of 1981 and 1983, in which Lionel was alleged to have jointly participated in\n\none count. William was also indicted for the sexual battery of B.M. and aggravated\n\nincest of M.S. The co-defendants\u2019 motions to sever their trials were denied and the\n\nmatter proceeded to a bench trial.\n\n      After the victim testified, the co-defendants re-urged their motions to sever,\n\fand moved for a mistrial, on the basis that the victim\u2019s testimony did not support\n\nthe allegation that the co-defendants jointly participated in raping her. The co-\n\ndefendants also asked the trial court to perform an in camera review of the victim\u2019s\n\ngrand jury testimony. The trial court denied the motions and declined to review the\n\ngrand jury testimony.\n\n       The trial court found Lionel guilty as charged of aggravated rape and\n\nWilliam guilty of forcible rape, not guilty of a second count of aggravated rape,\n\nand guilty of sexual battery and aggravated incest. The court sentenced Lionel to\n\nlife imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension\n\nof sentence, and sentenced William to a total of 40 years imprisonment at hard\n\nlabor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.\n\n       The court of appeal panel vacated the convictions and sentences. State v.\n\nSerigne, 14-0379 (La. App. 4 Cir. 5/2/16), 193 So. 3d 297. The court of appeal first\n\nnoted that Lionel was indicted for an aggravated rape alleged to have occurred\n\nbetween 1976 and 1983, which span included a time when La.R.S. 14:42 provided\n\na penalty of death for aggravated rape.1 Citing, inter alia, State v. Holmes, 263 La.\n\n685, 269 So. 2d 207 (1972), the court found as an error patent that, because\n\nLionel\u2019s offense was classified as capital during at least part of the time alleged in\n\nthe indictment, the procedural safeguards for capital trials applied and therefore a\n\nunanimous 12-person jury was necessary. Because Lionel was found guilty in a\n\nbench trial rather than by a unanimous 12-person jury, the court of appeal vacated\n\nhis conviction and sentence. Because the court of appeal vacated Lionel\u2019s\n\n\n       1\n           In Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U.S. 325, 96 S. Ct. 3001, 49 L. Ed. 2d 974 (1976), the U.S.\nSupreme Court found that Louisiana\u2019s mandatory death penalty for first degree murder violated\nthe Eighth Amendment. In Selman v. Louisiana, 428 U.S. 906, 96 S. Ct. 3214, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1212\n(1976), the U.S. Supreme Court found that a mandatory sentence of death for aggravated rape\nviolated the Eighth Amendment for the reasons expressed in Roberts. In response to Selman, the\nlegislature amended La.R.S. 14:42 to provide a penalty of life imprisonment without parole\neligibility for aggravated rape. 1977 La. Acts 343 (eff. September 8, 1977).\n                                               2\n\fconviction and sentence in errors patent review, it did not consider his four\n\nassignments of error.\n\n       Regarding William, the court of appeal first found the evidence sufficient to\n\nsupport the convictions before then finding that his trial was misjoined to Lionel\u2019s.\n\nThe court noted that no evidence was presented at trial in support of the allegation\n\nthat Lionel and William jointly participated in a rape, which allegation was the\n\njustification for trying them together. After hearing oral argument, the court of\n\nappeal obtained the grand jury transcript and found there was also no evidence\n\npresented to the grand jury that would support the state\u2019s allegation of joint\n\nparticipation in a rape. 2 The court of appeal then found that the state withheld the\n\ngrand jury transcript from the codefendants in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373\n\nU.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), and Giglio v. United States, 405\n\nU.S. 150, 153\u201354, 92 S. Ct. 763, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1972), because it contained\n\nevidence William did not rape D.A. and William and Lionel did not jointly rape\n\nD.A. 3 Therefore, the court of appeal ordered that William receive a new trial and\n\npretermitted consideration of all remaining assignments of error.\n\n       The court of appeal erred in applying State v. Holmes to find that Lionel was\n\nindicted for an offense classified as capital and therefore unable to waive a jury\n\ntrial. In Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1972),\n\nthe Supreme Court held in a single-paragraph per curiam that the manner in which\n\nthe death penalty was imposed and carried out in Georgia and Texas constituted\n\ncruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Five justices\n\nconcurred individually and at length in the judgment, disagreeing in many aspects\n\n\n       2\n         The grand jury testimony is not included in the appellate record submitted to this court\nto review.\n       3\n        There was no Brady claim assigned as error and the court of appeal reached this issue\nsua sponte after it obtained the grand jury transcript.\n                                               3\n\f(such as their understanding of the history and meaning of the Cruel and Unusual\n\nPunishments Clause), but four justices appeared to agree in one regard: statutory\n\nschemes that give unbridled discretion to the jury to determine if the death penalty\n\nwill be applied are so arbitrary as to violate the Eighth Amendment. See Furman,\n\n408 U.S. at 253, 92 S.Ct. at 2734 (Douglas, J., concurring) (\u201c[W]e deal with a\n\nsystem of law and of justice that leaves to the uncontrolled discretion of judges or\n\njuries the determination whether defendants committing these crimes should die or\n\nbe imprisoned. Under these laws no standards govern the selection of the penalty.\n\nPeople live or die, dependent on the whim of one man or of 12.\u201d); id., 408 U.S. at\n\n294\u201395, 92 S. Ct. at 2754\u201355 (Brennan, J., concurring) (\u201c[J]uries . . . make the\n\ndecision whether to impose a death sentence wholly unguided by standards\n\ngoverning that decision\u201d); id., 408 U.S. at 310, 92 S. Ct. at 2763 (Stewart, J.,\n\nconcurring) (\u201cI simply conclude that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments\n\ncannot tolerate the infliction of a sentence of death under legal systems that permit\n\nthis unique penalty to be so wantonly and so freakishly imposed.\u201d); id., 408 U.S. at\n\n314, 92 S. Ct. at 2764\u201365 (White, J., concurring) (\u201c[The] recurring practice of\n\ndelegating sentencing authority to the jury and the fact that a jury, in its own\n\ndiscretion and without violating its trust or any statutory policy, may refuse to\n\nimpose the death penalty no matter what the circumstances of the crime [violates\n\nthe Eighth Amendment]\u201d).\n\n      In cases that followed Furman, this court grappled with the implications of a\n\nconstitutionally unenforceable death penalty that had not yet been repealed or\n\nreplaced by the legislature. For example, in State v. Flood, 263 La. 700, 269 So. 2d\n\n212 (1972), the court found that murder remained classified as a capital offense for\n\npurpose of determining whether an accused is entitled to bail. The court stated:\n\n      [W]e conclude that Furman v. Georgia does not destroy the system of\n\n                                         4\n\f      classification of crimes in Louisiana. Murder is still a crime, and,\n      when our legislature last acted with respect to it, murder was, as it has\n      ever been, a capital crime. The crime remains unchanged; only the\n      penalty has been changed. True, the penalty is what made murder a\n      capital offense, and it is not actually a capital offense in Louisiana\n      today. But the Nature of the offense has not changed\u2014only the\n      punishment.\n\n      Because the system of classifying certain serious offenses as capital,\n      and then providing the procedural structure for the administration of\n      criminal justice based on that classification is so fundamental in the\n      organization of our criminal statutes, we find it preferable to make no\n      change in the interpretation of the constitutional provisions\n      concerning bail. Those offenses classified as capital before Furman v.\n      Georgia are still classified as capital offenses, and those charged with\n      an offense punishable by death before Furman v. Georgia are not\n      entitled to bail where the proof is evident or the presumption great.\n\nFlood, 263 La. at 705\u201306, 269 So.2d at 214.\n\n      Likewise, in State v. Holmes (decided on the same day as Flood), the court\n\nfound that murder remains classified as a capital case, although it could not be\n\npunished as such under Furman, and therefore must be tried before a unanimous,\n\nsequestered 12-person jury. Dicta suggests Flood and Holmes were decided against\n\nthe backdrop of a belief that the Eighth Amendment problem identified in Furman\n\ncould be readily remedied by a legislative switch to a mandatory death penalty.4\n\nThat belief did not prove correct. In response to Furman, Louisiana, along with 21\n\nother states, eliminated the jury\u2019s role in sentencing in a capital prosecution\n\nentirely by making the imposition of the death penalty mandatory. See John W.\n\nPoulos, The Supreme Court, Capital Punishment and the Substantive Criminal\n\n\n      4\n          See, e.g. Holmes, 263 La. at 691, 269 So.2d at 209 (emphasis added):\n\n      However, it was not the legislature, but the United States Supreme Court that has\n      held the Imposition and Execution of the death sentence, as now applicable in our\n      State, to be violative of the United States Constitution. No presumption arises that\n      any other provision of Louisiana law has been affected by the United States\n      Supreme Court, except those having to do with the Imposition and Execution of\n      death sentence. Nor, indeed, has the United States Supreme Court eliminated the\n      possibility that the Louisiana legislature might enact statutes which could\n      constitutionally impose the death sentence, when the sentence is mandatory and\n      cannot be applied in a discriminatory manner.\n\n                                                5\n\fLaw: The Rise and Fall of Mandatory Capital Punishment, 28 Ariz. L. Rev. 143,\n\n201\u201302 (1986). As noted above (see n.1), Louisiana\u2019s mandatory death penalty for\n\nfirst degree murder was then declared unconstitutional in Roberts v. Louisiana.\n\n       Thus, Flood and Holmes arose in a particularly unusual and volatile era of\n\ndeveloping death penalty jurisprudence and associated legislative responses.\n\nSubsequently, however, in State v. Schrader, 518 So. 2d 1024 (La. 1988), this court\n\nrejected prior jurisprudence under which a defendant, who could not have been\n\nsentenced to death due to the constitutional infirmities of the statutes in place at the\n\ntime of the homicide, would have nonetheless been entitled to the protections\n\nafforded the accused in a capital case (including a sequestered jury) because the\n\nhomicide prosecution retained for procedural purposes its capital classification.\n\nThe court held:\n\n       We now hold, despite its long lineage, the jurisprudential presumption\n       of prejudice for \u201ccapital cases\u201d does not apply to a \u201ccapital case\u201d\n       where the defendant never faced the prospect of the death penalty and\n       where counsel failed to press the point in the trial court, or object to\n       the lack of sequestration. In the absence of actual prejudice, this right\n       to sequestration is waived.\n\nSchrader, 518 So. 2d at 1037. Although the co-defendants argue Schrader should\n\nbe narrowly construed as applying only to jury sequestration (and not any other\n\nprocedural protections afforded a capital defendant), nothing in that opinion, which\n\nacknowledged Flood and Holmes, suggests the analysis should be so confined.\n\nInstead, we find Schrader more broadly rejected the prior \u201ccapital classification\u201d\n\njurisprudence, and that it applies equally to Lionel Serigne here.5 Lionel, who\n\n\n       5\n           In addition, even accepting for the sake of argument the viability of the capital\nclassification jurisprudence after Schrader, the parties and the court below neglect to address\nState v. Louviere, 00-2085 (La. 9/4/02), 833 So. 2d 885, in which this Court held:\n\n       [N]othing in Art. I, \u00a7 17 requires the jury to decide all phases of the trial . . . we\n       find the relevant limitation embodied in Art. I, \u00a7 17 is that of all the components\n       of a trial, from indictment to sentence, only the issue of the ultimate penalty of\n       death is strictly required to be put before the jury.\n\n                                                 6\n\fnever faced the prospect of the death penalty, validly waived his right to a jury trial\n\nand never challenged that waiver until the court of appeal raised this issue as an\n\nerror patent. Therefore, we reinstate his conviction and sentence. However, for the\n\nreasons below, we remand to the district court rather than the court of appeal. After\n\nfurther district court proceedings, as described below, Lionel may seek review in\n\nthe court of appeal of his pretermitted assignments of error.\n\n          As noted above, the court of appeal obtained a transcript of the grand jury\n\nproceedings after hearing oral argument and determined the transcript contained\n\nBrady material, although a Brady claim had not been presented to the trial court\n\nfirst and ruled upon below. William claimed on appeal the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to sever and erred in denying his request for a new trial based\n\non prejudicial joinder. By intertwining the joinder and Brady issues so closely, the\n\ncourt of appeal relied on evidence the trial court did not consider, i.e. the grand\n\njury transcript, in determining whether the trial court erred in declining to sever the\n\ntrials.\n\n          Code of Criminal Procedure art. 494 provides:\n\n          Two or more defendants may be charged in the same indictment or\n          information if they are alleged to have participated in the same act or\n          transaction or in the same series of acts or transactions constituting an\n          offense or offenses. Such defendants may be charged in one or more\n          counts together or separately and all of the defendants need not be\n          charged in each count.\n\nThe trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining whether to grant a\n\nmotion to sever, and its determination should be upheld in the absence of an abuse\n\nof that discretion. State v. Brooks, 88-1420 (La. 1/30/89), 541 So. 2d 801, 804\u201305.\n\nIn the present case, the state alleged in its second indictment that William and\n\n\n\n\nLouviere, 00-2085, p. 8, 883 So. 2d at 893.\n\n                                             7\n\fLionel jointly participated in the aggravated rape of D.A.6 Based on this allegation,\n\nand with no contrary information before it, the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying the various motions to sever before trial.\n\n       At trial, however, the testimony did not support the allegation of joint\n\nparticipation, and the co-defendants sought a new trial on that basis. To obtain a\n\nnew trial for misjoinder, it is necessary for a defendant to show prejudice. See\n\nLa.C.Cr.P. art. 851(2), (4); cf. La.C.Cr.P. art. 495.1. The court of appeal discussed\n\nthe prejudice William suffered only in the context of the analysis of the possible\n\nBrady violation. See Serigne, 14-0379, pp. 31\u201332, 193 So. 3d at 319. Review is\n\nfurther hampered by the absence of the grand jury transcript from the appellate\n\nrecord. Under the unusual circumstances presented here, faced with a record\n\ninadequate to evaluate this issue, and mindful of the constitutional prohibition\n\nagainst appellate factfinding in a criminal matter, La. Const. Art. 5, \u00a7 5(C), we\n\nremand to the district court to determine whether the grand jury testimony contains\n\nundisclosed Brady material warranting new trials for Lionel and William in\n\naccordance with Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S. Ct. 763, 766, 31\n\nL. Ed. 2d 104 (1972) and United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S. Ct.\n\n3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985). Thereafter, Lionel and William can seek review in\n\nthe court of appeal with regard to any unfavorable ruling by the district court.\n\nWilliam can also seek review of his claim of prejudicial misjoinder as well as any\n\npretermitted assignments of error.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the court of appeal\u2019s determination in\n\nerrors patent review that Lionel Serigne\u2019s conviction and sentence must be set\n\n\n       6\n          Unlike present law, see R.S. 14:42(A)(5), the statute defining the offense during the\npertinent period did not include multiple, joint perpetrators among the aggravating factors that\nelevated the grade of the offense. That aggravating factor was first added by 1984 La. Acts. 579.\nTherefore, the allegation of joint participation in the indictment, while not necessary as an\nelement of the offense, was likely included to obtain a joint trial of the co-defendants.\n                                               8\n\faside because he was unable to validly waive a jury trial. We reinstate Lionel\u2019s\n\nconviction and sentence. In addition, we reverse the court of appeal\u2019s\n\ndetermination that William Serigne is entitled to a new trial based on a Brady\n\nviolation, which issue was never passed on by the trial court, and we reinstate his\n\nconvictions and sentences. However, we also remand to the district court for\n\nfurther proceedings to determine if Lionel and William are entitled to new trials\n\nbased on undisclosed Brady material in the grand jury testimony. Thereafter,\n\nLionel and William may appeal any unfavorable determination by the district court\n\non remand as well as seek appellate review of any previously pretermitted\n\nassignments of error. In addition, we preserve William\u2019s claim of prejudicial\n\nmisjoinder for appellate review after further proceedings in the district court.\n\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f",
