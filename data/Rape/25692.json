We affirm the judgments of the magistrate court.\n\n\n                                               I.\n                                    Factual Background.\n       Jane Doe (\u201cMother\u201d) and John Doe (\u201cFather\u201d) were married for twenty-five years and\nhad eleven children between three years of age and twenty-two years of age. At the time of this\nproceeding, seven of the children were under the age of eighteen. Mother and Father lived in an\n\fAmish community in Washington until 2004. While they were in that community, they were\nshunned by other members because Father had confessed to inappropriately touching two of his\ndaughters.\n       In March 2015, the family moved to Spirit Lake, Idaho, to become members of another\nreligious community. The oldest daughter, who was then fourteen years of age, disclosed to that\ncommunity that Father had sexually molested her when she was a child, starting when she was\nfour or five years of age and ending when she was fourteen; that when she was six, seven, or\neight years of age, she told Mother, but Mother did nothing to protect her; and that when she was\ntwelve years of age, the molestation became less frequent as Father began sexually molesting a\nyounger sister who was six years of age. Members of that community encouraged Father to\nconfess to law enforcement, and he and Mother went to the county sheriff\u2019s office and confessed\nto sexually molesting two of his daughters while they lived in Washington. Because the offenses\ndid not occur in Idaho, he was not arrested. Members of the community met with Father and\nMother and developed with them a plan to protect the other children from Father sexually\nmolesting them. Father and Mother violated the provisions in the plan, and a member of the\ncommunity contacted the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (\u201cDepartment\u201d).\n       A Department case manager met with Father and Mother, who entered into a safety plan\nto protect the minor children. Father called the case manager and stated that they planned to\nmove back to the state of Washington. The case manager responded that the Department could\nnot supervise the safety plan if they were in another state. Mother then called the case manager\nand stated that they were moving to Washington with the children. The Department then\nobtained an order authorizing it to remove the minor children from the house.\n       On August 15, 2015, the county prosecutor filed a petition under the Idaho Child\nProtective Act. At some point, Father was charged in the state of Washington with three counts\nof felony child molestation in the first degree that were committed sometime between 1999 and\n2001 against the oldest daughter. On June 7, 2016, he pled guilty to all three charges, and on\nJuly 19, 2016, he was sentenced to ten years in prison and lifetime supervision.\n       On October 17, 2016, the Department filed a petition to terminate Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s\nparental rights in their minor children. After a two-day evidentiary hearing, the magistrate court\nfound that the Department had proved by clear and convincing evidence that there were grounds\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\ffor terminating the parental rights of Father and Mother in their minor children. It entered\njudgments terminating the parental rights of both parents, and they timely appealed.\n           \u201cThe trial court must find that grounds for terminating parental rights have been proved\nby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Health & Welfare v. Doe, 149 Idaho 207, 210, 233\nP.3d 138, 141 (2010).            \u201cOn appeal, the appellate court does not reweigh the evidence to\ndetermine if it was clear and convincing.\u201d Id. \u201cIn an action to terminate parental rights where a\ntrial court has noted explicitly and applied a clear and convincing standard, an appellate court\nwill not disturb the trial court\u2019s findings unless they are not supported by substantial and\ncompetent evidence.\u201d State v. Doe, 144 Idaho 534, 535, 164 P.3d 814, 815 (2007). \u201cSubstantial\nand competent evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept to support a\nconclusion.\u201d Anderson v. Harper\u2019s, Inc., 143 Idaho 193, 195, 141 P.3d 1062, 1064 (2006). \u201cIt is\nthe province of the trial court to determine the credibility of witnesses, the weight to be given\ntheir testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from the evidence.\u201d KMST, LLC v. Cnty. of Ada,\n138 Idaho 577, 581, 67 P.3d 56, 60 (2003).\n\n\n                                                         II.\n              Did the Magistrate Court Err in Terminating Father\u2019s Parental Rights?\n           Idaho Code section 16-2005(1) provides that a court may grant an order terminating\nparental rights if it finds that such termination is in the child\u2019s best interests and that one of the\nstatutory conditions for termination exists. The magistrate court found by clear and convincing\nevidence that three of the statutory conditions existed for terminating Father\u2019s parental rights in\nthe seven minor children. They were:\n                   (a) Father had neglected the children pursuant to Idaho Code sections 16-\n           2005(1)(b) and 16-2002(3)(a), 1\n                   (b) Father had neglected the children as defined by Idaho Code sections 16-\n           2005(1)(b) and 16-2002(3)(b), 2 and\n\n\n1\n  Idaho Code section 16-2005(1)(b) states as a condition for termination of a parent\u2019s parental rights that the parent\nhas neglected the child. Idaho Code section 16-2002(3)(a) defines \u201cneglected\u201d as conduct that is defined in Idaho\nCode section 16-1602(31). That definition includes a child who \u201cis without proper parental care and control, or\nsubsistence, medical or other care or control necessary for his well-being because of the conduct or omission of his\nparents, guardian or other custodian or their neglect or refusal to provide them.\u201d\n2\n    Idaho Code section 16-2002(3)(b) defines \u201cneglected\u201d as follows:\n\n                                                          3\n\f                  (c) Father had abused the oldest of the minor children as defined by Idaho Code\n         sections 16-2002(4) and 16-1602(1)(b), 3 and, with respect to the remaining six minor\n         children, he was incarcerated and was likely to remain incarcerated for a substantial\n         period of time during their minority (Idaho Code section 16-2005(1)(e). 4\n         With respect to the six youngest children, the magistrate court found that Father \u201chas\nbeen incarcerated and is likely to remain incarcerated for a substantial period of time during the\nminority of each of these children.\u201d Father does not challenge that finding on appeal.\n         With respect to the oldest of the minor children, the magistrate court found that Father\nhad sexually abused her. Father argues that he was not criminally charged with abusing that\ndaughter, she did not testify, and the evidence supporting that finding was hearsay. There is no\nrequirement that a parent be charged or convicted criminally in order to find in a termination\nproceeding that the parent has sexually abused his or her child. The hearsay testimony regarding\nFather\u2019s abuse of this daughter was admitted without objection. \u201cThe general rule is that where\nhearsay evidence is admitted without objection, it may properly be considered in determining the\nfacts; the important question being the weight to be given such evidence.\u201d Gem-Valley Ranches,\nInc. v. Small, 90 Idaho 354, 371, 411 P.2d 943, 953 (1966). The majority view is that hearsay\nevidence admitted without objection \u201cis as strong as any other legally competent evidence.\u201d 29A\nAm.Jur.2d Evidence \u00a7 1367 (2008). It was the province of the magistrate court to determine the\nweight to be given the testimony and the inferences to be drawn from it. In re Doe (2014-22),\n157 Idaho 955, 342 P.3d 667, 670 (2015). Thus, the court\u2019s finding that Father sexually abused\nthis daughter is supported by substantial and competent evidence.\n\n\n\n         (b) The parent(s) has failed to comply with the court\u2019s orders or the case plan in a child protective\n         act case and:\n                  (i) The department has had temporary or legal custody of the child for fifteen (15) of the\n                  most recent twenty-two (22) months; and\n                  (ii) Reunification has not been accomplished by the last day of the fifteenth month in\n                  which the child has been in the temporary or legal custody of the department.\n3\n  Idaho Code section 16-2005(1)(b) states as a condition for termination of a parent\u2019s parental rights that the parent\nhas abused the child. Idaho Code section 16-2002 states that \u201cabused\u201d means conduct that is defined in Idaho Code\nsection 16-1602. That definition includes \u201c[s]exual conduct, including . . . molestation.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 16-1602(1)(b).\n4\n  Idaho Code section 16-2005(1)(e) states as a condition for termination of a parent\u2019s parental rights that \u201c[t]he\nparent has been incarcerated and is likely to remain incarcerated for a substantial period of time during the child\u2019s\nminority.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                                          4\n\f       The magistrate court found the existence of a condition supporting the termination of\nFather\u2019s parental rights in the six youngest children and a ground supporting the termination of\nFather\u2019s parental rights in the oldest of the seven children. We therefore do not need to address\nthe other two conditions found by the court to exist.        The statutory conditions supporting\ntermination of parental rights listed in subsections (a) through (e) of Idaho Code section 16\u2013\n2005(1) are independent. In re Doe, 152 Idaho 910, 914, 277 P.3d 357, 361 (2012). If we\nuphold the magistrate court\u2019s finding as to one condition with respect to a child or children, we\nneed not address any other statutory condition found by the court to exist. Id.\n       In order to terminate a parent-child relationship, the magistrate court must also find that\ntermination is in the best interests of the child. I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(1). The court found, by clear and\nconvincing evidence, that it was in the best interests of the children that Father\u2019s parental rights\nin the seven minor children be terminated. The court found that he was a serial child molester;\nthat there was credible evidence that he had sexually abused most of his children; that the abuse\nhad been happening for at least sixteen years; that he had repeatedly confessed, repented, and\nthen continued molesting his children; and that no child was safe around him.\n       On appeal, Father does not dispute these findings. Rather, he argues that other factors\nshould outweigh them. He argues that the children \u201chave grown up in a happy, loving home\u201d;\nthat \u201cMother and Father have successfully raised several children into adulthood, and by all\naccounts have raised the children involved in this case to be well-mannered, respectful, happy,\nand healthy children\u201d; and that Father \u201cstill loves his children as well and will provide for them\nin any way he can while incarcerated.\u201d Father has not shown that the court erred in finding that\nit was in the best interests of the children to terminate Father\u2019s parental rights. Therefore, we\naffirm the judgment terminating Father\u2019s parental rights in the seven minor children.\n\n\n                                                III.\n          Did the Magistrate Court Err in Terminating Mother\u2019s Parental Rights?\n       The magistrate court found by clear and convincing evidence that two of the statutory\nconditions existed for terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights.        They were:     (a) Mother had\nneglected the children pursuant to Idaho Code sections 16-2005(1)(b) and 16-2002(3)(a), and (b)\nMother had neglected the children as defined by Idaho Code sections 16-2005(1)(b) and 16-\n2002(3)(b).\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f       With respect to neglect as defined in Idaho Code section 16-2002(3)(a), a child is\nneglected if the child \u201cis without proper parental care and control, or subsistence, medical or\nother care or control necessary for his well-being because of the conduct or omission of his\nparents, guardian or other custodian or their neglect or refusal to provide them.\u201d I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 16-\n2002(3)(a), 16-1602(31). The magistrate court found by clear and convincing evidence that\nMother had neglected by failing to provide care or control necessary for the well-being of the\nchildren, in that \u201cshe knew or had reason to know that the children were not safe around their\nfather, and took no steps to protect the children\u2019s safety.\u201d The court found, based solely upon the\ntestimony of Father and Mother:\n               Sometime around 2004 or before, [Father] confessed to other bishops and\n       his wife that he had molested two of his daughters; sometime around 2005\n       [Father] confessed to [Mother] that he had molested two of his daughters;\n       sometime around 2006, [Mother] suspected [Father] was molesting [the oldest\n       daughter] in the bedroom and [the daughter] confirmed it; sometime around 2008\n       [Mother] knew [Father] was being investigated by Washington child protective\n       services for child molestation; and sometime around 2012 [Father] exposed\n       himself to two of his daughters and [Mother] knew about it about a week\n       afterwards. This much was established based solely on the testimony of [Father]\n       and [Mother]. Based on this information alone, [Mother] knew or had reason to\n       know that the children were not safe with their father. Although [Mother] likely\n       did not know the full extent of [Father\u2019s] molestation of the children, and\n       although there was no evidence of sexual molestation of three of the children, she\n       knew enough that she should have known that none of the children were safe if\n       left alone with him.\n\n       Mother contends on appeal, \u201cThe evidence was hardly clear as to when the incidences of\nmolestation took place, much less when she became aware of it, or to what extent it had\noccurred.\u201d That assertion is contrary to Mother\u2019s testimony. She testified that Father first\nmolested their oldest daughter when the daughter was six years old and that she found out about\nit because Father told her. The magistrate court found that Father informed Mother of the\nmolestation when the daughter was six years old, and she was twenty-two years old at the time of\nthe evidentiary hearing. When asked what she did when Father told her, Mother answered, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t really know.\u201d She also testified that she did not call the police because \u201cI didn\u2019t realize\nthat I would be supposed to.\u201d When asked when was the last time that Father sexually abused a\nchild other than the oldest daughter, Mother answered, \u201cWell, it\u2019s been so far back I can\u2019t\nremember, you know, all the time, just how it all went.\u201d She then stated that she remembered a\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\ftime that Father had sexually abused the oldest daughter when she was twelve years of age.\nMother testified that she heard Father go into the oldest daughter\u2019s bedroom during the night and\nshe listened to what was happening. The next morning, she asked the daughter whether Father\nwas in her bedroom, and the daughter responded that he was. Mother asked what he had done,\nand the daughter described the sexual abuse. Mother was then asked whether she confronted\nFather, and she had and that he had admitted it. When asked whether she had called the police,\nshe again stated that she had not because \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s what you do.\u201d When asked how\nmany times Father had abused the daughter between when she was six and twelve years of age,\nMother stated, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d The oldest daughter testified that during that six-year period, the\nsexual abuse \u201cwas regular like every day, then maybe every week. Maybe a few weeks passed\nby and then again very regular.\u201d The oldest daughter also testified that when she was twelve\nyears of age, Father basically stopped sexually molesting her and began molesting a younger\nsister who was six years of age.\n       When the oldest daughter was twelve years of age, Washington authorities wanted to\ninterview her regarding whether Father was sexually abusing her. Before they met with the\ndaughter, Mother admitted telling her, \u201cBe careful what you say.\u201d The daughter testified that\nMother told her to lie, which she did, and the investigation ended at that time.\n       Mother asserts on appeal: \u201cPerhaps two or even four girls had had some degree of\nmolestation; versions differ dramatically. None of the three boys were allegedly violated; and\nthere was no sufficient showing that any of the other five girls underage and at home had been\neither.\u201d Mother testified that to her knowledge, three of the minor daughters had been sexually\nmolested by Father. In addition, the evidence showed that all three of the adult daughters\nreported that they had been sexually abused by Father. The oldest daughter testified that one of\nher brothers told her he also had been sexually molested by Father, and the magistrate court\nfound that that brother had disclosed incidents of sexual abuse to the case manager.\n       Mother was asked when was the last time that she was aware of Father abusing one of\ntheir children, and Mother answered that it was four or five years earlier. She testified that to her\nknowledge, he had sexually abused four of their daughters. When asked whether any of her\nchildren told her that Father had sexually abused them, she answered, \u201cYes,\u201d but could not\nremember what she said to them and did not call the police. The magistrate court\u2019s finding that\n\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fMother had neglected the children by failing to provide care or control necessary for their well-\nbeing is supported by substantial and competent evidence.\n       In order to terminate a parent-child relationship, the magistrate court must also find that\ntermination is in the best interests of the child. I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(1). The court found, by clear and\nconvincing evidence, that it was in the best interests of the children that Mother\u2019s parental rights\nin the seven minor children be terminated. The court found that termination of Mother\u2019s parental\nrights was in the best interests of the children because Mother was not able to provide the care\nand control necessary for the children\u2019s well-being and there was no reasonable expectation that\nshe would be able to do so within a reasonable period of time. Mother does not challenge that\nfactual finding on appeal. Therefore, it is unnecessary to set forth the court\u2019s basis for this\nfinding.\n       Mother simply asserts that there was insufficient evidence to prove that termination of\nMother\u2019s parental rights was in the children\u2019s best interests because \u201cnone of [the minor\nchildren] were proved to have been molested by Father and thus \u2018neglected\u2019 by Mother. None of\nthe minor children are even discussed individually by the Court. Nor is there any discussion why\nthe boys\u2019 interests are \u2018served\u2019 when they weren\u2019t even endangered to begin with.\u201d There is no\nrequirement that all of the children suffer harm in this circumstance. \u201c[O]nce the State is aware\nof circumstances indicating a child faces potential harm, it should not have to wait to intervene\nuntil that child suffers actual harm or illness, but rather should act to prevent it.\u201d Idaho Dep\u2019t of\nHealth & Welfare v. Doe, 150 Idaho 36, 43, 244 P.3d 180, 187 (2010) (footnote omitted).\nSubstantial and competent evidence supports the magistrate court\u2019s finding that termination of\nMother\u2019s parental rights was in the best interests of the children.\n\n\n                                                 IV.\n                                            Conclusion.\n       We affirm the judgment terminating Father\u2019s parental rights in the seven minor children,\nand we affirm the judgment terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights in the seven minor children.\n\n\n       Chief Justice BURDICK, and Justices JONES, HORTON and BRODY CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f",
