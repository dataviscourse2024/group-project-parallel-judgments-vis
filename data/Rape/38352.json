    "summary": "Appeal from Multnomah: M. G. Munly, Judge. Elias Chaims was indicted for assault with intent to commit a rape upon a female child under fourteen years of age. Nellie Bower, the prosecutrix, testified that defendant took improper liberties with her. Other witnesses testified to the place where defendant was seen with her; and defendant denied the charge as sworn to by prosecutrix, and offered testimony as to his good reputation. The only exception relied upon for reversal on appeal was to the following instruction by the trial court to the jury: \u201cIf you find that the alleged assault was made as charged, then has the intent been sufficiently proven. The intent must be established from the evidence, but it may be inferred from the facts and circumstances in evidence in this case. If the evidence establish the facts which usually accompany and precede the crime of rape when fully consummated, then, if such facts and circumstances have not been explained, and the assault is made out, it is fair to presume that the assault was accompanied with the intent.\u201d The defendant was convicted and appeals.",
