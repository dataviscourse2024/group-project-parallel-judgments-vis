The petitioner contends that the trial court\n\nerred in dismissing his petition on the following grounds:\n\n       (1) The indictment in his case was constitutionally defective\n           because it did not allege a specific mens rea.\n       (2) The petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial\n           for counsel\u2019s failure to depose a dying defense witness and\n           failure to move for sanctions in response to \u201ccoached\u201d\n           testimony.\n\n\nAfter a careful review of the record, we AFFIRM the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                   Procedural History\n\n       On July 9, 1992, the petitioner was convicted of the aggravated rape of\n\nhis two-year-old son and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. On January 9,\n\n1995, the conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. See State v.\n\nGary Rollins, Sr., No. 03C01-9308-CR-00250 (Tenn. Crim. App. filed January 9,\n\n1995, at Knoxville). Subsequently, the petitioner filed a petition seeking post-\n\nconviction relief which the trial court denied, after an evidentiary hearing, on July\n\n8, 1998. From this denial, the petitioner now appeals.\n\n\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n                                  Defective Indictment\n\n       The petitioner has relied exclusively upon the holding of a panel of this\n\nCourt in State v. Roger Dale Hill, No. 01C01-9508-CC-00267 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\nfiled June 25, 1996, at Nashville), rev\u2019d., 954 S.W.2d 725 (Tenn. 1997), to assert\n\nthat his indictment was insufficient and defective. As acknowledged by\n\npetitioner, after the filing of the instant petition but before the trial court\u2019s ruling,\n\nthe Tennessee Supreme Court reversed the Hill decision in State v. Hill, 954\n\n                                            -2-\n\fS.W.2d 725 (Tenn. 1997). While that decision involved indictments after the\n\nSentencing Reform Act of 1989, its analysis extends to indictments under the\n\n1979 Act as well. See Dykes v. Compton, 978 S.W.2d 528 (Tenn. 1998). The\n\nindictment in the instant case and that in Dykes are substantially similar.\n\nTherefore, we conclude the indictment is not defective.\n\n\n\n                         Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n       Next, the petitioner contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for\n\nfailing to depose a dying defense witness and failing to move for \u201csome type of\n\nsanction\u201d in response to the coached testimony of a trial witness. This Court\n\nreviews a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the standards of\n\nBaxter v. Rose, 523 S.W.2d 930 (Tenn. 1975), and Strickland v. Washington,\n\n466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). The petitioner has the\n\nburden to prove that (1) the attorney\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the\n\ndeficient performance resulted in prejudice to the defendant so as to deprive him\n\nof a fair trial. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687; Goad v. State, 938 S.W.2d 363,\n\n369 (Tenn. 1996); Overton v. State, 874 S.W.2d 6, 11 (Tenn. 1994); Butler v.\n\nState, 789 S.W.2d 898, 899 (Tenn. 1990).\n\n\n\n       Further, the petitioner\u2019s burden of proof in all post-conviction cases filed\n\nafter May 10, 1995, is by clear and convincing evidence, see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\n\n40-30-210(f), and reviewing courts must indulge a strong presumption that\n\ncounsel\u2019s conduct falls within the range of reasonableness and must evaluate\n\nthe performance from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time of the alleged error, see\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 695. The petitioner must show that there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that but for counsel\u2019s error, the result of the proceeding would have\n\nbeen different.\n\n       Finally, the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact on post-conviction hearings are\n\nconclusive on appeal unless the evidence preponderates otherwise. See Butler,\n\n                                         -3-\n\f789 S.W.2d 898, 899; Adkins v. State, 911 S.W.2d 334, 341 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1995). The trial court\u2019s findings of fact are afforded the weight of a jury verdict,\n\nand this Court is bound by the trial court\u2019s findings unless the evidence in the\n\nrecord preponderates against those findings. See Henley v. State, 960 S.W.2d\n\n572, 578 (Tenn. 1997); Alley v. State, 958 S.W.2d 138, 147 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1997); Dixon v. State, 934 S.W.2d 69, 72 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1996). This Court\n\nmay not reweigh or reevaluate the evidence, nor substitute its inferences for\n\nthose drawn by the trial judge. See Henley, 960 S.W.2d at 578-79; Massey v.\n\nState, 929 S.W.2d 399, 403 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1996); Black v. State, 794 S.W.2d\n\n752, 755 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1990). Questions concerning the credibility of\n\nwitnesses and the weight and value to be given to their testimony are resolved\n\nby the trial court, not this Court. See Henley, 960 S.W.2d at 579; Black, 794\n\nS.W.2d at 755. The burden of establishing that the evidence preponderates\n\notherwise is on the petitioner. See Henley, 960 S.W.2d at 579; Black, 794\n\nS.W.2d at 755.\n\n\n\n       Petitioner first asserts that trial counsel was ineffective in his failure to\n\ndepose a potential defense witness before that witness died, admittedly,\n\nunexpectedly. Regarding this failure, the trial court at the evidentiary hearing\n\nheard and accredited testimony from petitioner\u2019s trial counsel and made the\n\nfollowing finding:\n\n       Now it boils down to clairvoyance. Was it ineffective for Mr. Talman\n       to anticipate the imminent death of Mr. Knuckles when the\n       petitioner/defendant did not, even though much closer to him?\n       Now consider further the fact that even if deposed what would be\n       the efficacy of that testimony, if admitted, when shown that all he\n       could testify to would be that if present all the time the defendant\n       feels is of important, he saw or heard nothing. This may place this\n       in proper [perspective]. The issue is without merit. . . .\n\n\n\n       Petitioner has failed to demonstrate any error in the trial court\u2019s reasoning\n\nor conclusion. The petitioner acknowledged that the witness died unexpectedly\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fand yet would argue that this Court hold trial counsel ineffective for failing to\n\nforesee the death. Further, the efficacy of the witness\u2019 testimony is dubious: (1)\n\nthe witness\u2019 testimony would not have been that the offenses did not occur, but\n\nrather, in a context of an alibi defense, that he simply did not see them occur,\n\nand (2) some similiar testimony was already introduced through alternate\n\nwitnesses. Accordingly, we conclude that the petitioner has failed to\n\ndemonstrate that his trial counsel was ineffective and that prejudice resulted.\n\n\n\n       Second, petitioner argues that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to\n\nmake a motion for sanctions in response to allegedly \u201ccoached\u201d testimony at trial.\n\nTrial counsel vigorously cross-examined the \u201ccoached\u201d witness at trial in front of\n\nthe jury as well as raising the issue on direct appeal. Failure to make a motion\n\nfor sanctions simply does not constitute ineffectiveness when trial counsel\n\npursued the reasonable strategy of exposing the witness before the jury by\n\ncross-examination. Further, it is entirely unclear what prejudice the petitioner\n\neven alleges. Therefore, we conclude that trial counsel was not ineffective.\n\n\n\n       Accordingly, we conclude, on both ineffectiveness claims, that the\n\nevidence does not preponderate against the trial court\u2019s findings.\n\n\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n       The judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                           ______________________________\n                                           JOHN EVERETT WILLIAMS, Judge\n\nCONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f_______________________________\nJOSEPH M.
