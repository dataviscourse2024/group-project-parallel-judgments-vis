In any event, this contention is without merit (see People v Grogan, 28 AD3d 579 [2006]).\nThe defendant\u2019s contention regarding New York\u2019s DNA indexing statute is unpreserved for appellate review, and is without merit in any event (see Nicholas v Goord, 430 F3d 652, 669, 671 [2005]).\nThe defendant\u2019s contention regarding double jeopardy is without merit (see Serfass v United States, 420 US 377, 388-389 [1975]; People v Cato, 306 AD2d 914 [2003]).\nSince the defendant\u2019s claim regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, as raised in his supplemental pro se brief, involves matter dehors the record, it may not be reviewed on direct appeal. Miller, J.E, Angiolillo, Garni and Dickerson, JJ., concur.\n",
