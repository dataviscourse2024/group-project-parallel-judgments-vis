Mecham contends the conditions are not crime-related, are\n\nunconstitutionally vague and overbroad, infringe his rights to intimate association,\n\nfreedom of speech, and free exercise of his religion. We affirm in part, and reverse and\n\nremand in part to strike two conditions.\n\n\n\n      Mecham entered a negotiated guilty plea to the offense of second degree child\n\nmolestation and fourth degree assault with a sexual motivation. Mecham admitted to\n\nsexually touching minors in a church and at a bus stop. Mecham agreed to an\n\nexceptional sentence of 20 months and 304 days. At sentencing, Mecham contested\n\nonly the community custody conditions requested by the State.\n\fNo. 79008-1 -1/2\n\n\n       The incident involving the second degree child molestation conviction occurred\n\non August 27, 2017. J.L. and her seven-year-old daughter, Y.L., went to a church\n\nservice with their family. After the church service, the family stayed at church for a\n\nlunch event. While the lunch was being set up, J.L. and Y.L went downstairs to a\n\nplayroom. Another four-year-old child and a male, later identified as Mecham, were in\n\nthe playroom. J.L. and Y.L. returned upstairs for lunch.\n\n       During lunch, J.L. sat at a table with her children, her mother, Mecham\u2019s parents\n\nand Mecham\u2019s older brother. After Y.L. finished eating, she asked her mother if she\n\ncould return to the playroom, J.L. agreed, and Y.L returned to the playroom alone. A\n\nfew minutes later, Y.L. returned to J.L. at the lunch table and whispered that someone\n\nhad picked her up from behind.\n\n       Later that evening, J.L asked Y.L who picked her up at church and Y.L. said she\n\nthought it was a son of the parents who were sitting with them at lunch. Y.L. described\n\nthe man as wearing a red t-shirt; J.L. recalled that Mecham had been wearing a red t\n\nshirt and they sat with his parents at lunch. Y.L. described the incident, explaining that\n\nMecham had grabbed her from behind and reached down the front of her shorts,\n\ntouching her private spot, \u201ctapping it two times.\u201d Y.L. was very upset when describing\n\nthe incident to her mother.\n\n       The incident involving the fourth degree assault with sexual motivation occurred\n\non May 19, 2016. Mecham walked up to a 16-year-old girl, H.J., at a bus stop, reached\n\nover her shoulder and grabbed her breast underneath her shirt and bra. H.J. screamed\n\nand ran home and told her friend Candi. Candi and H.J. drove to the bus stop and\n\nlocated Mecham walking north. Candi and H.J. followed Mecham in Candi\u2019s car and\n\n                                          -2-\n\fNo. 79008-1-113\n\n\ncalled 911. When Deputy Mark Stich arrived, Candi explained that Mecham had\n\ngrabbed H.J.\u2019s breast and pointed him out to Deputy Stich. Deputy Stich detained\n\nMecham.\n\n       On October 26, 2017, Detective Saarinen interviewed Mecham about molesting\n\nY.L. Mecham admitted to playing with Y.L. and another female child in the playroom.\n\nMecham denied touching Y.L. anywhere other than her arms and shoulders. During the\n\ninterview, Mecham admitted to the incident on May 19, 2016, that he tried to grab the\n\nbreast of a stranger at a bus stop. Mecham said that the woman screamed and ran\n\naway, and that they were the only ones at the bus stop and it was \u2018just too easy.\u201d\n\n       At sentencing, the trial court imposed several conditions that Mecham contests\n\non appeal.\n\n\n\n       We review community custody conditions for abuse of discretion and will reverse\n\ncommunity custody conditions that are manifestly unreasonable. State v. Valencia, 169\n\nWash. 2d 782, 791-92, 239 P.3d 1059 (2010). If imposition of the community custody\n\ncondition violates the constitution it is manifestly unreasonable. Valencia, 169 Wash. 2d at\n\n79 1-92. We review the trial court\u2019s finding that the community custody prohibition is\n\ncrime-related for substantial supporting evidence. State v. Zimmer, 146 Wash. App. 405,\n\n413, 190 P.3d 121 (2008). We do not presume that a community custody condition is\n\nconstitutional. Valencia, 169 Wash. 2d at 793.\n\n      \u201cWashington sentencing courts are required to impose certain community\n\ncustody conditions in specified circumstances and may impose others.\u201d State v. BahI,\n\n164 Wash. 2d 739, 744, 193 P.3d 678 (2008). The Sentencing Reform Act (SRA), ch.\n\n                                         -3-\n\f No. 79008-1-114\n\n\n9.94A RCW, sets forth the mandatory, waivable, and discretionary community\n\nconditions that courts impose during sentencing. The SRA permits the court to order an\n\noffender to: refrain from direct or indirect contact with the victim of the crime or a\n\nspecified class of individuals, participate in crime-related treatment or counseling\n\nservices, participate in rehabilitative programs or otherwise perform affirmative conduct\n\nreasonably related to the circumstances of the offense, the offender\u2019s risk of\n\nreoffending, or the safety of the community, and comply with any crime-related\n\nprohibitions. RCW 9.94A.703(3)(b), (c), (d), (f). Crime-related prohibitions are\n\ndiscretionary conditions that are directly related to the circumstances of the crime but\n\nneed not be causally related to the crime. RCW 9.94A.030(10); Zimmer, 146 Wash. App.\n\nat 413.\n\n          A defendant\u2019s constitutional rights during community placement are subject to the\n\ninfringements authorized by the SRA. BahI, 164 Wash. 2d at 765. \u201cMore careful review of\n\nsentencing conditions is required where those conditions interfere with a fundamental\n\nconstitutional right.\u201d State v. Warren, 165 Wash. 2d 17, 32, 195 P.3d 940 (2008).\n\nConditions interfering with a fundamental constitutional right \u201cmust be reasonably\n\nnecessary to accomplish the essential needs of the State and public order\u201d and \u201cmust\n\nbe sensitively imposed.\u201d Warren, 165 Wash. 2d at 32.\n\n       Community custody conditions may be unconstitutionally vague or overbroad\n\nwhen they are not crime related. The Fourteenth Amendment and article I, section 3 of\n\nthe Washington Constitution require that citizens have fair warning of proscribed\n\nconduct. U.S. Const. Amend. XIV; Wash. Const. art. I, \u00a73. A statute is\n\nunconstitutionally vague if it does not define the criminal offense with sufficient\n\n                                           -4-\n\fNo. 79008-1 -1/5\n\n\ndefiniteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is proscribed, or does\n\nnot provide ascertainable standards of guilt to protect against arbitrary enforcement.\n\nBahI, 164 Wash. 2d at 752-53.\n\n       \u201cOverbreadth analysis is intended to ensure that the legislative enactments do\n\nnot prohibit constitutionally protected conduct, such as free speech.\u201d City of Seattle v.\n\nhian, 71 Wash. App. 145, 149, 856 P.2d 1116 (1993). When evaluating overbreadth\n\nchallenges to community custody conditions, the court considers if the challenged\n\nstatute reaches constitutionally protected speech or conduct, and whether it proscribes\n\na substantial amount of that speech or conduct. State v. Knowles, 91 Wash. App. 367,\n\n372, 957 P.2d 797 (1998).\n\n       Mecham raises several challenges to each of the following community custody\n\nconditions:\n\n       (5) Do not possess or consume controlled substances unless you have a\n       legally issued prescription.\n\n      (16) Stay out of: parks used for youth activities, schools k-12 grades,\n      daycare facilities, playgrounds, wading pools, swimming pools being used\n      for youth activities, play areas (indoor or outdoor), sports fields being used\n      for youth activities, arcades, church services, restaurants marketed to and\n      designed to cater to children, and any specific location identified in\n      advance by DOC or CCO. May attend church services and restaurants if\n      accompanied and supervised by an adult aware of the offenses and\n      approved by the CCO.\n\n      (17) Do not date women who have minor children, as directed by the\n      supervising Community Corrections Officer. Disclose sex offender status\n      prior to any sexual contact. Sexual contact in a relationship is prohibited\n      until the treatment provider/Community Corrections Officer approves of\n      such. Do not form relationships with families who have minor children\n      except as approved by Sex. Dev. Provider.\nWe address each challenge in the order of these conditions.\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f No. 79008-1-1/6\n\n\n                                                A.\n\n        Mecham contends that condition 5 is both unconstitutionally vague and\n\noverbroad. We disagree.\n\n        Condition 5 states \u201cDo not possess or consume controlled substances unless\n\nyou have a legally issued prescription.\u201d First, Mecham contends that condition 5 does\n\nnot provide him with sufficient notice because the court did not check the box in the\n\njudgment and sentence prohibiting the defendant from possessing or consuming\n\nmarijuana without a valid prescription. This argument fails because the prohibition is\n\nincluded in Appendix 4.2 and the judgment and sentence provides that \u201c[tjhe defendant\n\nshall comply with Additional Conditions of Community Custody as set forth in Appendix\n\n4.2.\u201d\n\n        Next, Mecham contends that the trial court\u2019s failure to define a \u201ccontrolled\n\nsubstance\u201d is unconstitutionally vague because its use and possession in Washington is\n\ndecriminalized and therefore, a person of ordinary intelligence would not be on notice\n\nthat its use is prohibited.\n\n        This court recently addressed the issue of whether a community custody\n\ncondition that prohibits the association with known users and sellers of \u2018illegal drugs\u201d\n\nwas unconstitutionally vague because it was unclear whether \u201cillegal drugs\u201d included\n\nmarijuana. In Pers. Restraint of Brettell, 6 Wash. App. 2d 161, 170-71, 430 P.3d 677\n\n(2018). We held that the marijuana usage remains a federal offense under the\n\nControlled Substances Act (CSA) and therefore, although recreational marijuana use\n\nand possession has been decriminalized in Washington, it does not excuse a person\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f No. 79008-1-117\n\n\n from knowing that marijuana is still \u201cillegal\u201d federally. 21 U.S.C.      \u00a7~ 812, 844; ROW\n 69.50.360. under the CSA, a controlled substance is defined as\n\n        a drug or other substance, or immediate precursor, included in schedule I,\n        II, Ill, IV, or V of part B of this subchapter. The term does not include\n        distilled spirits, wine, malt beverages, or tobacco, as those terms are\n        defined or used in subtitle E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n21 U.S.C   \u00a7 802(7). Marijuana is a controlled substance under the CSA and Mecham\nmust obey all laws, including federal law. 21         u.s.c. \u00a7 821.   Therefore, the restriction\n\nthat Mecham not possess or use controlled substances without a prescription is not\n\nunconstitutionally vague and clearly includes marijuana.\n\n       Mecham also contends that this condition is overbroad because marijuana use is\n\nnot prohibited by law in Washington. 5ince marijuana is a controlled substance under\n\nthe CSA, its use is prohibited by federal law and therefore the condition is not\n\nunconstitutionally overbroad.\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       Mecham contends that condition 16 infringes his right to freely exercise religion.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n       Condition 16 prohibits Mecham from attending church services unless he is\n\naccompanied and supervised by an adult aware of his offenses and approved by the\n\nCCO. Mecham contends that the condition is subject to strict scrutiny and the 5tate has\n\nnot used the least restrictive means for protecting children at church services.\n\n       Religious free exercise is protected under the First Amendment and the Free\n\nExercise Clause of the Washington Constitution.          u.s.   Const. Amend. I; Wash. Const.\n\nart. I, \u00a711. \u201cReligious free exercise embraces two concepts: the freedom to believe and\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fNo. 79008-1-118\n\n\nthe freedom to act.\u201d State v. Balzer, 91 Wash. App. 44, 52, 954 P.2d 931 (1998) (citing\n\nCantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303, 60 S. Ct. 900, 903, 84 L. Ed. 1213 (1940)).\n\n\u201cThe first is absolute while the second, by the nature of our democracy cannot be.\u201d\n\nBalzer, 91 Wash. App. at 52. Community custody conditions that burden the free exercise\n\nof religion must satisfy strict scrutiny. Balzer, 91 Wash. App. at 53.\n\n       Strict scrutiny requires the defendant to prove that the government restriction has\n\na coercive effect on the practice of religion. Balzer, 91 Wash. App. at 53. First, the\n\ndefendant must demonstrate that his religious convictions are sincerely held and central\n\nto the practice of his religion. Balzer, 91 Wash. App. at 54. The State concedes that\n\nMecham\u2019s family was very involved in church. Next, the defendant must demonstrate\n\nthat the restriction unduly burdens free exercise, which is shown if its \u201ccoercive effect.\n\n\u2022 operates against a party in the practice of his [or her] religion.\u201d Balzer, 91 Wash. App. at\n\n54.\n\n       Mecham has not shown that he will be unduly burdened by this restriction.\n\nMecham\u2019s crime involved abusing an unsupervised child at church. The day of the\n\noffense, Mecham was attending church with his mother, father, and older brother.\n\nMecham has failed to show that these members of his family, who presumably know his\n\noffense, will be unable to supervise his attendance at church. Thus, from the record,\n\nMecham will be able to continue attending church services in the same manner as\n\nbefore his conviction.\n\n       Further, even if the restriction unduly burdened Mecham\u2019s free exercise, the\n\nrestriction satisfies strict scrutiny. Once the defendant \u2018establishes a burden upon\n\nreligious free exercise, the court determines if the burden is offset by a compelling state\n\n                                          -8-\n\f No. 79008-1-119\n\n\n interest served by the least restrictive means to achieve that interest.\u201d Balzer, 91 Wn.\n\nApp. at 56. \u201c\u2018Compelling interests\u2019 are those government objectives based upon the\n\nnecessities of national or community life such as threats to public health, peace, and\n\nwelfare.\u201d Balzer, 91 Wash. App. at 56. \u201cIf the government demonstrates that it has a\n\ncompelling interest in enforcing the enactment for the peace and safety of the state, that\n\ninterest will justify infringement upon [the defendant\u2019s] religious free exercise.\u201d Balzer,\n\n91 Wash. App. at 56.\n\n        The State has a compelling interest to protect families who attend church\n\nservices from Mecham. Mecham committed the offense in a church. He abused a\n\nseven-year-old in the church playroom while the congregation enjoyed lunch upstairs.\n\nMecham was not deterred from abusing Y.L. even though he had seen J.L. accompany\n\nY.L. to the playroom. Merely prohibiting Mecham\u2019s contact with children is insufficient to\n\naccomplish the State\u2019s interest because Mecham needs supervision to prevent this type\n\nof contact.\n\n        The trial court did not abuse its discretion by prohibiting Mecham from attending\n\nchurch services without the supervision of an adult aware of his offense because the\n\nrestriction is not unduly burdensome, serves a compelling state interest, and is narrowly\n\ntailored.\n\n                                             C.\n\n        Next, Mecham contends that condition 16\u2019s prohibition on visiting \u201crestaurants\n\nmarketed to and designed to cater to children\u201d is unconstitutionally vague. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f No. 79008-1-1/10\n\n\n        Mecham contends that this case is like Irwin because there, the court held that\n\n\u201careas where minor children are known to congregate\u201d was vague because it did not\n\nprovide sufficient definiteness. State v. Irwin, 191 Wash. App. 644, 649, 364 P.3d 830\n\n(2015). In Irwin, the court concluded that the condition \u201cdo not frequent areas where\n\nminor children and known to congregate, as defined by the supervising CCC\u201d was\n\nvague because it did not provide sufficient notice to understand the conduct proscribed.\n\nIrwin, 191 Wash. App. at 654. The court noted that \u201cit may be true that, once the CCC\n\nsets locations where \u2018children are known to congregate\u2019 for Irwin, Irwin will have\n\nsufficient notice of what conduct is proscribed,\u201d but that would leave the condition\n\nvulnerable to arbitrary enforcement. Irwin, 191 Wash. App. at 655.\n\n       Here, the trial court sought to provide Mecham with sufficient definiteness that\n\nlacked in Irwin. The list of prohibited places is extensive. At the sentencing hearing, the\n\ntrial court changed the prohibition from restaurants to \u201crestaurants marketed to and\n\ndesigned to cater to children.\u201d The vagueness doctrine does not require impossible\n\nprecision for community custody conditions. State v. Wallmuller, 194 Wash. 2d 234, 244-\n\n45, 449 P.3d 619 (2019).\n\n       Mecham expresses concerns that it is unclear whether \u201cfamily friendly\u201d\n\nrestaurants, restaurants with a small play area, or that have a children\u2019s menu are\n\nincluded. Designed means \u201cdone, performed, or made with purpose and intent often\n\ndespite an appearance of being accidental, spontaneous or natural.\u201d    WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD\n\nNEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY    612 (2002). Design means \u201cdeliberate purposive\n\nplanning.\u201d   WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY     611 (2002). In context, the\n\nterm designed limits the scope of restaurants to those that have been made specifically\n\n                                         -10-\n\fNo. 79008-1-I/li\n\n\nfor children, and not merely a family friendly restaurant. The restaurants that Mecham\n\nmust avoid are those with play areas, games, or entertainment for children.\n\n                                              D.\n\n       Mecham challenges condition 17 based on his right to intimate association under\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment and the Washington Constitution. U.S. Const.         \u00a7 XIV;\nConst. art. I   \u00a7 3; City of Bremerton v. Widell, 146 Wash. 2d 561, 575, 51 P.3d 733 (2002).\nIntimate human relationships are those \u201cthat attend the creation and sustenance of a\n\nfamily\u201d and include, marriage, childbirth, the raising and educating of one\u2019s children, and\n\ncohabitation with one\u2019s relatives. Widell, 146 Wash. 2d at 576. The United States\n\nSupreme Court \u201chas endorsed a continuum approach, delineating where the \u2018objective\n\ncharacteristics locate [the relationship] on a spectrum from the most intimate to the most\n\nattenuated of personal attachments.\u201d Widell, 146 Wash. 2d at 576-77 (citing Roberts v.\n\nU.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 620, 104 S. Ct. 3244, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1984)).\n\n       Determining the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to government action\n       alleged to infringe the right of marriage requires a two-step analysis: first,\n       a court must ask whether the policy or action is a direct or substantial\n       interference with the right of marriage; second, if the policy or action is a\n       direct and substantial interference with the right of marriage, apply strict\n       scrutiny, otherwise apply rational basis scrutiny. In this context, strict\n       scrutiny means that the state action burdening marriage cannot be upheld\n       \u201cunless it is supported by sufficiently important state interests and is\n       closely tailored to effectuate only those interests.\u201d\nWidell, 146 Wash. 2d at 579.\n\n                                              1.\n\n       Mecham contends that condition 17\u2019s prohibition, \u201cdo not date women who have\n\nminor children, as directed by the supervising Community Corrections Officer\u201d is not\n\n\n\n                                           \u201411\u2014\n\fNo. 79008-1-1/12\n\n\ncrime-related, is unconstitutionally vague, and infringes his right to intimate\n\nrelationships. We disagree.\n\n       Crime-related restrictions must be directly related to the crime. Here, the crime\n\ninvolved minor children. Prohibiting Mecham from dating women who have minor\n\nchildren protects a class of victims. The SRA allows the court to order an offender to\n\n\u201crefrain from direct or indirect contact with the victim of the crime or a specified class of\n\nindividuals.\u201d RCW 9.94.703(3)(b). We apply rational basis scrutiny because Mecham\n\nhas not explained how this condition is \u201ca direct or substantial interference with the right\n\nof marriage.\u201d The State\u2019s goal here is protecting women and their minor children and\n\nthe condition satisfies that goal.\n\n       Mecham contends that \u201cas directed by the supervising Community Custody\n\nOfficer\u201d renders the condition unconstitutionally vague. The condition does not fail for\n\nvagueness under BahI. In BahI, the court concluded that the restriction on accessing\n\npornographic materials was unconstitutionally vague because pornography is a\n\nsubjective term and that allowing the CCO to direct what falls within the condition made\n\nthe vagueness problem more apparent. 164 Wash. 2d at 758. In Bahl, allowing\n\nenforcement by the CCO of a subjective term could lead to arbitrary enforcement. 164\n\nWash. 2d at 758. We do not hold the same concern here. The prohibition is clear and not\n\nsubjective. Mecham is prohibited from dating women with minor children without COO\n\napproval.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\f No. 79008-1-1/13\n\n\n                                             2.\n\n       Mecham contends that condition 17\u2019s requirement to \u201cdisclose sex offender\n\nstatus prior to any sexual contact\u201d is an unconstitutional compulsion of speech and is\n\nnot crime-related. We agree.\n\n       The right to freedom of speech necessarily includes the freedom to refrain from\n\nspeech. U.S. Const. Amend. I, XIV; Const. art. I   \u00a7 5; Wooley v.        Maynard, 430 U.S. 705,\n\n714, 97 S. Ct. 1428, 51 L. Ed. 2d 752 (1977). \u201cThe protection from compelled speech\n\nextends to statements of fact as well as of opinion.\u201d State v. K.H.-H., 185 Wash. 2d 745,\n\n749, 374 P.3d 1141(2016). \u201cThe compelled speech doctrine generally dictates that the\n\nState cannot force individuals to deliver messages that they do not wish to make.\u201d K.H.\n\nH., 185 Wash. 2d at 749. Under BahI, a community custody condition that limits a\n\nfundamental right is permissible, provided it is imposed sensitively. 164 Wash. 2d at 757.\n\nFirst Amendment rights may be restricted if reasonably necessary to accomplish the\n\nessential needs of the state and public order. BahI, 164 Wash. 2d at 757.\n\n       The State contends that K.H.-H. is applicable because the court upheld a court-\n\nordered apology letter as a permissible compulsion of speech. K.H.-H. was a 17-year-\n\nold male, adjudicated guilty of fourth degree sexual assault with sexual motivation of\n\nC.R., a female acquaintance from his high school. The trial court ordered K.H.-H. to\n\n\u201caddress to C.R. \u2018a sincere Written letter of apology.   .   .   mean[ing] an admission that he\n\ndid what he was accused of what he\u2019s [sic] doing and [is] sorry he put her in that\n\nposition.\u201d K.H.-H., 185 Wash. 2d at 747. On appeal, K.H.-H. contended that the condition\n\nwas an unconstitutional compulsion of speech. K.H.-H., 185 Wash. 2d at 748. The court\n\nconcluded that, while the letter was a compulsion of speech, it was reasonably\n\n                                          -13-\n\f No. 79008-1-1/14\n\n\n necessary to accomplish the goals of juvenile rehabilitation in the Juvenile Justice Act of\n\n 1977 (JJA), chapter 13.40 RCW. K.H.-H., 185 Wash. 2d at 747.\n\n       The purpose of the SRA is to\n\n       [Mjake the criminal justice system accountable to the public by developing\n       a system for the sentencing of felony offenders which structures, but does\n       not eliminate, discretionary decisions affecting sentences, and to:\n       (1) Ensure that the punishment for a criminal offense is proportionate to\n       the seriousness of the offense and the offender\u2019s criminal history;\n       (2) Promote respect for the law by providing punishment which is just;\n\n       (3) Be commensurate with the punishment imposed on others committing\n       similar offenses;\n       (4) Protect the public;\n       (5) Offer the offender an opportunity to improve himself or herself;\n       (6) Make frugal use of the state\u2019s and local governments\u2019 resources; and\n       (7) Reduce the risk of reoffending by offenders in the community.\n\nROW 9.94A.010.\n\n       Unlike the JJA, the goals of the SRA do not include rehabilitation. The State\n\nresponds that\n\n       [r]equiring Mecham to disclose his sex offender status prior to any sexual\n       contact is narrowly tailored and reasonably necessary to protect the\n       public. Mecham\u2019s crimes against children demonstrated his utter inability\n       to control his sexual urges. He explained that he assaulted H.J. at the\n       bus[J stop because they were alone there at the time and it was \u201cjust too\n       easy.\u201d[] Because Mecham declined to participate in his [presentence\n       investigation interview], the report noted there was no information for the\n       sentencing judge pertaining to the nature, severity and degree of\n       Mecham\u2019s sexual deviancy.\nThe State asserts that its goal is to protect the public. The condition, however, is not\n\nsensitively imposed because there is nothing in the record supporting a risk to\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\f No. 79008-1 -1/15\n\n\nconsenting adults. The condition is not crime-related because Mecham\u2019s crimes were\n\nagainst minors and is an unconstitutional compulsion of speech.\n\n                                                     3.\n\n       Mecham contends that condition 17\u2019s restriction on \u201csexual contact in a\n\nrelationship   .   .   .   until the treatment provider/Community Corrections Officer approves of\n\nsuch\u201d is an unconstitutional infringement on his right to intimate association and is not\n\ncrime-related. We agree that it is not crime-related.\n\n       Crime-related restrictions must be directly related to the crime. Prohibiting\n\nsexual contact in a relationship until approved by the treatment provider or CCO is not\n\ncrime-related because Mecham\u2019s victims were not in a relationship with him. Mecham\n\ndeclined to be interviewed for the presentence investigation report and the report stated\n\nthat \u201c[t]here is no available information pertaining to the possible nature, degree and\n\nseverity of sexual deviancy experienced by Joel Mecham. A sexual deviancy evaluation\n\nmay offer insight into any offense patterns and triggers, as well as an analysis of the\n\npossibility or likelihood of future re-offense.\u201d From this record, we cannot conclude that\n\na prohibition on \u201csexual contact in a relationship\u201d is crime-related.\n\n                                                     4.\n\n       Mecham contends that condition 17\u2019s prohibition \u201cdo not form relationships with\n\nfamilies who have minor children except as approved by Sex. Dev. Provider\u201d is an\n\nunconstitutional infringement on his right to intimate association and is not crime\n\nrelated. We disagree.\n\n      The right to form relationships with other families is not protected as a right to\n\nintimate association. Widell, 146 Wash. 2d at 575. Under Widell, the court recognized that\n\n                                                  -15-\n\fNo. 79008-1-1/16\n\n\n\u201can engaged couple who is not cohabitating is not entitled to constitutional protection.\u201d\n\n146 Wash. 2d at 577. Here, the State must satisfy rational basis scrutiny to restrict\n\nMecham from forming relationships with families who have minor children. This\n\nrestriction protects minors and is crime-related because, in both incidents, Mecham\u2019s\n\nvictim was a minor. Mecham\u2019s family and Y.L.\u2019s family sat together at the church\n\nluncheon. Prohibiting Mecham from forming new relationships with families who have\n\nminor children is directly related to the nature of Mecham\u2019s crime because Mecham took\n\nadvantage of these established relationships when he abused Y.L.\n\n       We affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part to the trial court to strike the\n\nprohibitions against \u201csexual contact in a relationship is prohibited until the treatment\n\nprovider/Community Corrections Officer approves of such\u201d and \u201cdisclose sex offender\n\nstatus prior to any sexual contact.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                                           111.1\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n               /                                                            ~11\n                    1\u2019                                 /\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f",
