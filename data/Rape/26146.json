McTaggart, Esquire, Department of\nJustice, Wilmington, Delaware, Attorney for Appellee, State of Delaware.\n\n\n\n\nSTRINE, Chief Justice, for the Majority:\n\f                                   I.       Introduction\n\n       This is a difficult and unusual appeal, in the sense that the appellant\u2019s primary\n\nargument, when read closely, is not so much addressed to error on the part of the\n\ntrial judge as to the prior rulings of this Court that put the trial court in the impossible\n\nposition of framing jury instructions that required the jury to make findings of fact,\n\nwhen the only open issues were not ones of fact, but of law.\n\n       The awful facts of the case are, as one small blessing, unusual, too. The\n\nundisputed facts at the center of this case are that Jane D.W. Doe, the deceased\n\nplaintiff whose estate is the appellant, was validly arrested by a Delaware State\n\nPolice Officer for shoplifting, and \u201cwas subject to an outstanding capias.\u201d1 Doe\n\nalleged that, rather than properly processing her arrest, the Officer instead told her\n\nthat if she performed oral sex on him, he would take her home and she could just\n\nturn herself in on the capias the next day.2 If she refused, he would \u201ctake her to\n\ncourt, where bail would be set, and . . . she would have to spend the weekend in\n\njail.\u201d3 The Officer originally denied that the oral sex occurred, but after DNA\n\nevidence of the oral sex was found on Doe\u2019s jacket, he claimed that he \u201cdidn\u2019t tell\n\nher [he] was going to do anything for her . . . . She just started coming on to\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Doe v. State, 76 A.3d 774, 775 (Del. 2013).\n2\n  Id.\n3\n  Id.\n                                                1\n\f[him] . . . [and he] made the mistake of engaging in[] it.\u201d4 But the fact that the\n\nOfficer received oral sex from Doe while she was under arrest is not disputed.5 And\n\nthe State charged the Officer with crimes, including: i) \u201cintentionally compel[ling]\n\nor induc[ing] [Doe] to engage in sexual penetration/intercourse;\u201d and ii) \u201csolicit[ing]\n\na personal benefit from [Doe] for having violated his duty\u201d to bring her in on her\n\ncapias.6 Although the State seems to have eventually come to a somewhat different\n\nposition in this civil case, as we shall discuss, to charge the Officer under either of\n\nthese theories, the State would have needed to be confident that the Officer abused\n\nhis authority over Doe to obtain sex from her in exchange for releasing her on her\n\nown recognizance.7\n\n\n4\n  App. to Opening Br. at 100\u201201 (Interview of [the Officer]) (Q. \u201c[H]er allegation is that she\nperformed oral sex on you in your police car in the front seat . . . .

Gershman, A Moral Standard for the Prosecutor\u2019s Exercise of the\n                                                  2\n\f       What is clearly disputed in this appeal is whether the jury verdict finding that\n\nthe State of Delaware is not responsible in tort as the officer\u2019s employer for this\n\nmisconduct should be affirmed. We agree with Doe that the jury verdict should be\n\nvacated, and we order that judgment be entered in Doe\u2019s favor on the issue of\n\nliability. But we do not do so because either the trial judge erred or the jury somehow\n\ndid something wrong.\n\n       We do so because the jury was improperly asked to decide whether the\n\nemployer of a police officer who received oral sex from an arrestee for his own\n\npersonal gratification, and with no purpose to serve his employer, was acting within\n\nthe scope of his employment. This question was submitted to the jury because this\n\nCourt found in its initial decision (\u201cDoe I\u201d) that the jury should decide the issue.8 In\n\na second decision (\u201cDoe II\u201d), we adhered to the law of the case and did not revisit\n\nthat earlier ruling.9 In this decision, we admit that we erred in leaving this issue of\n\n\n\n\nCharging Decision, 20 FORDHAM URB. L.J. 513, 522 (1993) (\u201c[B]efore making the ultimate\ndecision to charge, the prosecutor should then assure herself that she is morally certain that the\ndefendant is both factually and legally guilty . . . . Finally, the prosecutor who acknowledges moral\nuncertainty about a defendant\u2019s guilt but decides nonetheless to bring charges, violates the\nprosecutor\u2019s special obligation to seek justice, and tacitly invites the system to miscarry.\u201d).\n8\n  Doe v. State, 76 A.3d 774, 777 (Del. 2013) (\u201cThe third factor\u2014whether [the Officer] was\nactivated in part to serve his employer\u2014has been construed broadly as a matter for the jury to\ndecide.\u201d).\n9\n  Sherman v. State, 133 A.3d 971, 979 (Del. 2016) (\u201cIn our 2013 opinion, this Court held that the\nquestion of whether an employee acted in the scope of employment \u2018is ordinarily one for decision\nby the jury.\u2019 The Superior Court correctly determined that our 2013 holding is the law of the case\nand, accordingly, properly denied Doe\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d).\n                                                 3\n\flaw to the jury, and leaving the Superior Court in the impossible position of crafting\n\nsensible jury instructions to implement a mandate that was not well-thought-out.\n\n         The question of whether the State is liable as an employer for the Officer\u2019s\n\nsexual misconduct turns on these related questions of law, not fact:\n\n         Is \u00a7 228 of the Restatement (Second) of Agency\u2019s requirement that the\n         employee\u2019s actions be motivated in part to serve the employer satisfied\n         if the Officer\u2019s misconduct took place when he had made a valid arrest\n         and was in the course of processing that arrest?\n\n         Or is that provision only satisfied if the specific tortious conduct that\n         occurred during that period was itself motivated in part to serve the\n         Officer\u2019s employer?\n\nIn Doe I, we all but held that the correct answer was the former, not the latter, but\n\ninstead of holding that as a matter of law, we confusingly stated that the question of\n\nwhether the Officer\u2019s conduct was in the scope of his employment should be left to\n\nthe jury. And we directed the Superior Court to \u00a7 228 of the Restatement (Second)\n\nof Agency as the appropriate test for the jury to apply in doing so. But \u00a7 228 includes\n\na Motivation Prong that requires the tortious conduct to be \u201cactuated, at least in part,\n\nby a purpose to serve the master.\u201d10 So our ruling had the effect of directing the\n\nSuperior Court to ask the jury whether the sexual misconduct was motivated in part\n\nby the Officer\u2019s desire to serve his employer, when that question could only be\n\nanswered in the negative because Doe never argued that it was. For that reason, Doe\n\n\n\n10\n     Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 228(1)(c) (1958).\n                                                4\n\fargued in her first appeal to this Court that \u00a7 219 of the Restatement,11 which is a\n\ncomplement to \u00a7 228, applied to relieve her of the obligation to show that the\n\nOfficer\u2019s wrongful conduct was motivated by a desire to serve his employer. But\n\nwe failed to address that part of Doe\u2019s argument.\n\n       In reaching our decision in this appeal, we admit that we depart from the law\n\nof the case. We do not do so lightly, but the doctrine of law of the case must give\n\nway when adhering to it would produce an injustice.12 It is plain to us that our earlier\n\nfailure to give more precise consideration to the specific questions of law presented\n\nby this case left the Superior Court and the parties without the ability to get a ruling\n\non their dispute that took into account the precise arguments they were making. As\n\nimportant, we believe it is critical that in this sensitive area, we clarify the legal\n\nprovisions that will apply if another case of this kind is filed.\n\n       Courts in other jurisdictions, like this Court in Doe I, have been tempted by\n\nthe equities in the context of cases like this to stretch or even ignore the terms of\n\n\u00a7 228 to justify finding respondeat superior liability. In this case, for example, Doe I\n\nimplied that the wrongful act itself need not be motivated in part by a desire to serve\n\nthe employer, even though that is what \u00a7 228 and its commentary plainly require.\n\n\n\n\n11\n  Id. \u00a7 219.\n12\n  Hoskins v. State, 102 A.3d 724, 729 (Del. 2014) (stating that the law of the case doctrine is not\nan \u201cabsolute bar to reconsideration of a prior decision\u201d and should give way when the decision\nestablishing it is \u201cclearly wrong\u201d or \u201cproduces an injustice\u201d).\n                                                5\n\fBut to provide clarity for other cases going forward, we refine our prior ruling in\n\nDoe I and hew to a reading of \u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation Prong that requires that the\n\nwrongful act must itself be motivated in part by a desire to serve the employer. We\n\nalso clarify that \u00a7 228\u2019s Foreseeability Prong, requiring that, \u201cif force is used, the\n\nuse of force is not unexpectable,\u201d requires that the general risk of the wrongdoing,\n\nnot the specific risk of the employee engaging in that conduct, be foreseeable.13\n\n       In this decision, we find that \u00a7 228, which has been adopted as Delaware\n\nlaw,14 should operate within the context of its Restatement counterpart, \u00a7 219, as the\n\nRestatement intends. Section 219 \u201cenumerates the situations in which a master may\n\nbe liable for torts of servants acting solely for their own purposes and hence not in\n\nthe scope of employment.\u201d15 When \u00a7 219\u2019s exceptions apply, an employer can be\n\nheld responsible under respondeat superior even if \u00a7 228 is not satisfied. Two\n\nsubsections of \u00a7 219 have potential applicability to cases like this: \u00a7 219(2)(d),\n\nwhich provides an exception to the scope of employment requirement in cases where\n\nthe employee \u201cwas aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency\n\n\n\n\n13\n   Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 228(1)(d) (1958).\n14\n   See Wilson v. Joma, Inc., 537 A.2d 187 (Del. 1988); Coates v. Murphy, 270 A.2d 527 (Del.\n1970); Draper, 181 A.2d 565; Hecksher v. Fairwinds Baptist Church, Inc., 115 A.3d 1187, 1200\n(Del. 2015) (\u201cIn determining whether tortious conduct is within the scope of employment,\nDelaware courts will consider the factors outlined in the Restatement (Second) of Agency . . . .\u201d)\n(citing Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 228 (1958)).\n15\n   Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219 cmt. e (1958).\n                                                6\n\frelation,\u201d and \u00a7 219(2)(c), which does the same for cases in which the employee\u2019s\n\n\u201cconduct violated a non-delegable duty of the master.\u201d16\n\n       Here we hold that, as a matter of law, if a police officer makes a valid arrest\n\nand then uses that leverage to obtain sex from his arrestee, his misconduct need not\n\nfall within the scope of his employment under \u00a7 228 to trigger his employer\u2019s\n\nliability.17 In so finding, we take into account the unique, coercive authority\n\nentrusted in our police under Delaware law, and the reality that when an arrestee is\n\nunder an officer\u2019s authority, she cannot resist that authority without committing a\n\ncrime. Because the Officer\u2019s position aided him in obtaining sexual favors\u2014\n\nsatisfying \u00a7 219(2)(d)\u2014and the State owed a non-delegable duty to safeguard the\n\narrestee from harm while she was under arrest\u2014satisfying \u00a7 219(2)(c)\u2014Doe does\n\nnot have to satisfy \u00a7 228 for the State to be liable for the Officer\u2019s sexual misconduct.\n\n       We then address a question that arguably should not even be in the case. The\n\nState charged the Officer with two crimes that depended on the Officer having asked\n\nDoe for sex in exchange for her release\u2014the antithesis of voluntary consent. Despite\n\nthat, at trial, the State insisted that the judge leave the jury to decide whether Doe\n\nconsented to the Officer\u2019s desire for sex.18 In this decision, we hold that an arrestee\n\n\n16\n   Id. \u00a7 219(2)(c); id. \u00a7 219(2)(d).\n17\n   Id. \u00a7 228(1); id. \u00a7 219 (\u201cA master is not subject to liability for the torts of his servants acting\noutside the scope of their employment, unless . . . .\u201d) (emphasis added); see also Doe v. Forrest,\n853 A.2d 48, 56 (Vt. 2004) (describing \u00a7 219(2)(d) as \u201can exception to our scope-of-employment\nrule\u201d).\n18\n   Prayer Conf. Tr. (Jan. 19, 2017), at 34:1\u201310.\n                                                  7\n\fin Delaware is incapable of voluntary consent to sex with her arresting officer as a\n\nmatter of law because she is prohibited from seeking to escape her arresting officer,\n\neven by peaceable means, at risk of criminal penalty. Thus, we hold that it was error\n\nto indulge the State\u2019s desire to defend itself on the ground that Doe freely chose to\n\nperform oral sex on her arresting officer.\n\n       We understand that this decision involves a question of how to allocate the\n\nrisk of misconduct like this: to the employer or the victim. But this is a unique\n\ncontext in which victims face criminal liability even for peaceably resisting arrest,19\n\nvictims have a rational reason to fear that they will not be believed if they refuse an\n\nofficer\u2019s wrongful threat and report it to the judiciary or police authorities, and the\n\nemploying agency is best positioned to put in place policies to diminish the risk of\n\ncases like this occurring. As such, where the provisions of \u00a7 219 provide for\n\nrespondeat superior liability, we believe it is sensible to embrace \u00a7 219 and hold the\n\nState responsible for its officers\u2019 commissions of wrongful torts like this while in\n\nthe course of making and processing valid arrests.\n\n\n\n\n19\n   11 Del. C. \u00a7 1257(b) (\u201cA person is guilty of resisting arrest when the person intentionally\nprevents or attempts to prevent a peace officer from effecting an arrest or detention of the person\nor another person or intentionally flees from a peace officer who is effecting an arrest or detention\nof the person.\u201d).\n                                                 8\n\f          For these reasons, we vacate the jury verdict in this case and remand for entry\n\nof a judgment in Doe\u2019s favor on the issue of liability, with a jury trial to follow on\n\nthe issue of damages.\n\n                         II.        Facts and Procedural History\n\n          As we summarized the facts of the case in Doe I:\n\n          On March 19, 2009, a security employee at the JC Penney store in the\n          Christiana Mall stopped Jane D.W. Doe for shoplifting. Doe had been\n          arrested before, and she was subject to an outstanding capias. After\n          about 45 minutes, [a] Delaware State Police Officer . . . arrived at the\n          store and took Doe into custody. He placed her in the rear of his police\n          car and drove to several locations in the mall parking lot. Doe alleges\n          that, at the third location, [the Officer] stopped, got out of the police\n          car, opened the rear door, and placed Doe\u2019s hands on his genitals.\n\n          According to Doe, [the Officer] then drove to a remote area where he\n          told her that he would let her go home if she did something in return.\n          [The Officer] allegedly told Doe that, unless she acceded to his\n          demands, he would take her to court, where bail would be set, and that\n          she would have to spend the weekend in jail. The prospect of jail\n          allegedly coerced Doe to perform oral sex on [the Officer] in the front\n          seat of the police car. Afterwards, [the Officer] drove Doe home and\n          told her to turn herself in on the capias. Doe reported the incident to\n          Delaware State Police Sergeant Maher, who investigated and\n          eventually arrested [the Officer] on charges of sexual misconduct,\n          bribery and official misconduct. [The Officer] killed himself shortly\n          after his arrest.20\n\n\n\n\n20\n     Doe v.

Both Doe and the\n\nOfficer are dead, and the fact record of what happened between them on\n\nMarch 19, 2009 consists of the statements they made before their deaths, plus the\n\nphysical evidence that makes certain that Doe was telling the truth when she said\n\nthat the oral sex occurred. Given the painful nature of this case and the fact that the\n\nalleged wrongdoer has already suffered the ultimate penalty of self-inflicted death,\n\nwe feel it is more empathetic to refer to both the plaintiff and defendant by\n\npseudonyms reflecting their roles in the case. Therefore, we refer to the defendant\n\npolice officer who arrested Doe as the \u201cOfficer.\u201d\n\n       The issues on appeal flow out of the confusion the trial court and the parties\n\nexperienced because of the lack of clarity in Doe I and Doe II regarding the\n\nMotivation and Foreseeability Prongs of \u00a7 228, the applicability of \u00a7 219\u2019s\n\nexceptions, and the question of whether an arrestee may ever consent to sex with her\n\narresting officer.

The Superior Court\u2019s First Opinion\n\n       In her complaint, Doe\u2019s theory of the case was simple. She alleged that the\n\nOfficer arrested her for shoplifting.23 He then told her that, if she performed oral sex\n\non him, he would release her on her own recognizance and allow her to turn herself\n\nin on her outstanding capias the next day. If she refused, he would take her to court\n\n\u201cwhere she would likely be remanded for failure to make bail and she would spend\n\nthe weekend in jail.\u201d24 Doe did not allege that the Officer\u2019s desire for oral sex was\n\nmotivated in any part by his duties to the State Police or the State itself. To the\n\ncontrary, Doe\u2019s complaint alleged that the Officer\u2019s acts \u201cwere done in bad faith,\n\nwith no belief that the public interest would be served thereby,\u201d and constituted\n\nassault, \u201cintentionally and without [her] consent, [] caus[ing] [her] to be in fear of\n\nan immediate harmful or offensive contact,\u201d and battery, \u201cintentionally and without\n\n[her] consent, [] mak[ing] contact in a harmful or offensive way.\u201d25\n\n       In its first motion for summary judgment, the State argued that the facts Doe\n\npled\u2014that the Officer sought sexual favors from her in exchange for releasing her\n\n\n\n22\n   Doe v.

It argued that the\n\nOfficer was not employed to receive oral sex, and that there was no way in which\n\nthe Officer\u2019s receipt of oral sex from Doe was motivated by a desire to serve the\n\ninterests of his employer, the State.28 Thus, the State argued that, as a matter of law,\n\nDoe could not satisfy the requirements of the \u00a7 228 test because the sexual\n\nmisconduct was not \u201cmotivated in part at least to serve the master\u201d\u2014thus failing the\n\nMotivation Prong\u2014and the \u201cforce used in committing the rape was unexpected by\n\nthe master\u201d\u2014thus failing the Foreseeability Prong.29\n\n      In response, Doe argued that because the Officer\u2019s wrongful conduct occurred\n\nin the course of a valid arrest and the Officer used his official authority to coerce her\n\n\n26\n   Defendant State of Delaware\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment at 2, Doe v.

Doe cited mixed-\n\nmotive cases under the Motivation Prong of \u00a7 228: cases presenting a fact question\n\nabout whether the wrongful act (e.g., the use of excessive force by a police officer\n\nor a security guard) was motivated in part by a desire to do one\u2019s job (e.g., to secure\n\nan arrest or to keep a trespasser out). But, Doe never made a case-specific argument\n\nthat the Officer\u2019s demand that she provide him with oral sex in exchange for a release\n\non her own recognizance was motivated by anything other than a desire for his own\n\ngratification.\n\n         Doe made an important argument about why that did not matter. She pointed\n\nto another section of the Restatement that is designed to provide exceptions to \u00a7 228,\n\n\u00a7 219. Section 219 says:\n\n         (1)     A master is subject to liability for the torts of his servants\n                 committed while acting in the scope of employment.\n         (2)     A master is not subject to liability for the torts of his servants\n                 acting outside the scope of their employment, unless:\n                 (a)   the master intended the conduct or the consequences, or\n                 (b)   the master was negligent or reckless, or\n                 (c)   the conduct violated a non-delegable duty of the master,\n                       or\n                 (d)   the servant purported to act or to speak on behalf of the\n                       principal and there was reliance upon apparent\n                       authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort\n                       by the existence of the agency relation.30\n\n\n\n30\n     Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219 (1958).\n                                              13\n\fIn particular, citing \u00a7 219(2)(d), Doe argued that \u201cif an employee uses a position or\n\npower afforded by the employment relationship to commit a tort the employer is\n\nvicariously liable,\u201d and that the Officer in this case \u201ccommitted the acts charged by\n\nabusing his power as a State Officer to arrest and hold [Doe] in custody.\u201d31\n\n       Section 219 is important because if the exceptions it articulates apply, it\n\nexempts a plaintiff from having to prove under \u00a7 228 that the tort occurred within\n\nthe scope of employment. In resolving the motion in favor of the State, the Superior\n\nCourt held as a matter of law that Doe\u2019s claim failed to establish the State\u2019s liability\n\nunder \u00a7 228. The Superior Court held that two grounds were fatal to Doe\u2019s claim:\n\ni) the lack of any material dispute of fact, indeed lack of any argument by Doe, that\n\nthe Officer\u2019s misconduct was motivated in any way by an intent to serve the State\n\nand thus \u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation Prong was not satisfied;32 and ii) the Superior Court\u2019s\n\nview that the Officer\u2019s conduct was so outrageous and unusual that it was, as a matter\n\nof law, unforeseeable, and thus \u00a7 228\u2019s Foreseeability Prong was also not satisfied.33\n\nAnd, citing the lack of Delaware precedent applying \u00a7 219 of the Restatement, the\n\n\n31\n   Plaintiff\u2019s Response to Defendant State of Delaware\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment at 1, Doe\nv.

This Court\u2019s First Opinion\n\n       After the Superior Court dismissed her case on summary judgment, Doe took\n\nan appeal centered on the same arguments that were presented in the summary\n\njudgment proceeding below. In her appeal, Doe argued that the first three prongs of\n\n\u00a7 228 were satisfied as a matter of law because they pertain to the \u201cgeneral duties\n\nundertaken by the assailant at the time,\u201d and the Officer\u2019s misconduct \u201ctook place in\n\nexercising the State sanctioned power of arrest, at an authorized time and place, and\n\nwas (until the misconduct) intended to serve the State.\u201d 35\n\n       As to \u00a7 228\u2019s Foreseeability Prong, Doe argued that \u201c[r]are outrageous\n\nbehavior can still be within the scope of employment so long as not unexpectable\n\nand occurring in the context of otherwise authorized acts.\u201d36 To support her\n\nargument that the Officer\u2019s misconduct was not unexpectable, Doe cited allegations\n\nof \u201cState Troopers commit[ing] unauthorized and wrongful acts during the execution\n\nof their duties, including one rape, and multiple assaults,\u201d as well as one instance in\n\nwhich a \u201cLewes police officer pled guilty to on duty unlawful sexual intercourse\n\n\n\n\n34\n   Id.\n35\n   Doe\u2019s Opening Br. at 12\u201313, Doe v.

She cited the Vermont Supreme Court\u2019s\n\napplication of \u00a7 219(2)(d) in finding that the \u201cposition and powers of a police officer\n\nwho intimidated [a] [p]laintiff into [a] sexual act could support [a] finding of\n\nvicarious liability.\u201d40\n\n       Our opinion in the appeal was terse. We found that, as a matter of law, Doe\n\nhad satisfied \u00a7 228\u2019s first two prongs:\n\n       [The Officer] was in uniform, on-duty, carrying out a police duty by\n       transporting [Doe] to court. The sexual assault took place in the police\n       car, during the time that [the Officer] was supposed to be carrying out\n       police duties. These facts would satisfy the first two factors under the\n       Restatement\u2014[the Officer] was doing the kind of work he was\n       employed to perform, and he was acting within authorized time and\n       space limits.41\n\n37\n   Id. at 14.\n38\n   Id. at 18 (quoting Mary M. v.

But we did not hold that Doe had\n\nestablished those remaining elements as a matter of law. Instead, we held that she\n\nwas entitled to have a jury decide whether those prongs were satisfied.\n\n         It was this aspect of Doe I that sowed the seeds of future confusion. In\n\nparticular, our ruling as to the requirement under \u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation Prong that the\n\nOfficer\u2019s sexual misconduct must be motivated in part by a desire to serve his\n\nemployer is what has vexed the Superior Court ever since.\n\n         Despite the reality that Doe never contended that the Officer sought oral sex\n\nfor any reason other than self-gratification\u2014i.e., Doe never argued that the Officer\n\nhad any partial motivation to obtain oral sex to aid the Delaware State Police or the\n\npeople of Delaware\u2014this Court held that Doe was entitled to have a jury decide the\n\nquestion of whether the Officer had such a motivation. Our reasoning\u2014which\n\nreferenced Draper v. Olivere,42 a case in which a heavy equipment operator\u2019s assault\n\non a motorist intruding into a construction area was found to fall within the scope of\n\nhis employment\u2014was this in full:\n\n         The third factor\u2014whether [the Officer] was activated in part to serve\n         his employer\u2014has been construed broadly as a matter for the jury to\n         decide. If the act of cutting someone\u2019s throat can be considered a\n\n42\n     Draper v. Olivere Paving & Const. Co., 181 A.2d 565 (Del. 1962).\n                                               17\n\f        service to the employer paving company on the theory that the\n        employee was controlling traffic, then a sexual assault can be\n        considered a service to the police on the theory that part of what [the\n        Officer] was doing was transporting a prisoner.43\n\n        The problem with this reasoning, as we will highlight further, is that we did\n\nnot ground our reference to Draper in a mixed-motive analogy that could fit the facts\n\nof this case. However odd it might seem that stabbing someone might be motivated\n\nin part by a desire to serve one\u2019s employer, that is not so far-fetched if the person\n\nwho did the stabbing was a heavy equipment operator charged with keeping an area\n\nfree from trespassers and the person stabbed was a motorist trespassing into an area\n\nthe operator was expected to guard.44 Draper is a mixed-motive case where the\n\nwrongful act itself could be fairly argued to have been \u201cmotivated in part\u201d by a desire\n\nto stop the trespass and serve the employer.\n\n        Draper is the kind of a case for which the Motivation Prong of \u00a7 228 exists.\n\nThe Motivation Prong\u2019s key role is to deal with cases in which it is possible that an\n\nemployee has taken a wrongful action that advances his employer\u2019s goals but that\n\nemployee also has a personal motivation to take that action.45 Cases involving force\n\nare still beans for \u00a7 228\u2019s grinder because there are jobs, including those of police\n\n\n\n43\n   Doe v.

Doe did not allege\n\nthat the Officer was partially motivated to gratify himself by a desire to serve the\n\nState.\n\n         Our decision in Doe I was, of course, correct to say that if there is evidence in\n\nlight of which rational minds could disagree about whether the employee\u2019s\n\nmisconduct was motivated in part by a desire to serve his employer, then the question\n\nof whether the Motivation Prong of \u00a7 228 is satisfied is one for the jury to resolve.\n\nBut, to the extent that we implied that \u00a7 228\u2019s scope-of-employment test should\n\nalways go to a jury, even if there is no issue of fact for the jury to determine, that\n\n\n\n\n46\n   Id. \u00a7 245 cmt. c (\u201cTo create liability for a battery by a servant upon a third person, the\nemployment must be one which is likely to bring the servant into conflict with others. . . .

The record does not establish the [Officer\u2019s] conduct\n       was unforeseeable.49\n\nIn so deciding, we did not give any guidance about whether foreseeability was to be\n\ndetermined in a general way, requiring that Doe show that there was a recognized\n\nhistory of police officers abusing their authority over arrestees to obtain sexual\n\nfavors, or in the specific way, requiring her to show that the State had some basis to\n\nforesee that the Officer whose conduct is the focus of this case would misuse his\n\nauthority for his own sexual gratification.

The\n\nsovereign immunity defense provides that \u201cneither the State nor a State agency can\n\nbe sued without its consent.\u201d50 But it is waived \u201cas to any risk or loss covered by\n\nthe state insurance program.\u201d51 The State moved for summary judgment, arguing\n\nthat Doe\u2019s claims were \u201cexcluded [from] coverage under the terms of the\n\nDepartment of Public Safety Division of State Police self-insurance plan and\n\ntherefore not subject to a waiver of sovereign immunity.\u201d52 The Officer\u2019s estate also\n\nbrought a motion to dismiss, arguing that Doe\u2019s complaint against the estate was\n\ntime-barred.53\n\n\n\n\n50\n   Pauley v.

Doe argued that Doe I found not only that the first two prongs of\n\n\u00a7 228 could be and were satisfied as a matter of law, but so too was the Motivation\n\nProng:\n\n       In addressing the issue of whether [the Officer] \u201cwas activated in part\n       to serve his employer\u201d the Supreme Court observed that \u201ca sexual\n       assault can be considered a service to the police on a theory that part of\n       what [the Officer] was doing was transporting a prisoner.\u201d That is this\n       case.54\n\nDoe also argued that the Foreseeability Prong was satisfied as a matter of law, citing\n\nformer Delaware State Police Superintendent Thomas MacLeish\u2019s testimony that\n\n\u201cthere is a risk in police work that a small minority of police officers will engage in\n\nsexual assault or similar misconduct involving detainees in their custody,\u201d and the\n\nfact that the State Police \u201ctrain[ed] against and h[ad] procedures to protect against\n\nsuch misconduct.\u201d55 Doe again pointed to allegations of \u201cindividual State Troopers\n\ncommit[ing] unauthorized and wrongful acts during execution of their duties,\n\nincluding one rape, and multiple assaults.\u201d56 Whether because Doe I ignored her\n\nargument as to the applicability of \u00a7 219 and therefore left the Superior Court\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n54\n   Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment or Partial Adjudication Pursuant to Superior\nCourt Civil Rule 56(a) 3, Doe v.

The Superior Court granted the State\u2019s\n\nmotion for summary judgment, finding that the State\u2019s insurance policy did not\n\nprovide coverage for Doe\u2019s claims and that the defense of sovereign immunity was\n\ntherefore not waived.57 The Superior Court also granted the Officer\u2019s estate\u2019s\n\nmotion to dismiss Doe\u2019s claims against the estate because they were time-barred.58\n\nThe Superior Court denied Doe\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the issue of\n\nliability, noting that \u201c[b]ased on the Supreme Court\u2019s findings on appeal [in Doe I],\n\nboth [\u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation and Foreseeability Prongs] remain matters for the jury to\n\ndecide.\u201d59\n\n                         D.         This Court\u2019s Second Opinion\n\n       Doe then took her second appeal, contesting the rulings below, and in Doe II,\n\nthis Court again got to consider the case. On appeal, the major emphasis of the\n\nparties was on the State\u2019s assertion of sovereign immunity and the Officer\u2019s estate\u2019s\n\nassertion that Doe\u2019s claims against it were time-barred. But, in fairness, Doe sought\n\nto have us re-examine our decision in Doe I that \u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation and\n\nForeseeability prongs presented questions for the jury, again arguing that the\n\n\n57\n   Doe v.

Instead, Doe argued about\n\n\u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation and Foreseeability Prongs. That was understandable, of course,\n\nbecause Doe I ignored Doe\u2019s \u00a7 219 argument, asserted that \u00a7 228 was the\n\nappropriate test for determining liability in this case, and stated that it only mattered\n\n\u201cwhether the service itself in which the tortious act was done was within the ordinary\n\ncourse of such business.\u201d61\n\n       In pressing her arguments in Doe II, Doe relied on the part of Doe I that\n\nimplied that she had no obligation to show that the Officer was motivated by his\n\nofficial duties in seeking oral sex. Doe\u2019s brief argued that it was undisputed that the\n\noral sex occurred during a time period when the Officer was processing Doe\u2019s arrest\n\nand transporting her to court,62 and that, as a matter of law, the Motivation Prong\n\nwas satisfied under Doe I\u2019s statement that \u201ca sexual assault can be considered a\n\nservice to the police on the theory that part of what [the Officer] was doing was\n\ntransporting a prisoner.\u201d63\n\n\n60\n   Doe\u2019s Opening Br. at 36, Sherman v.

To\n\nthis point, Doe argued to us that:\n\n       [Section 228\u2019s Motivation Prong] \u201chas been broadly construed as a\n       matter for the jury to decide.\u201d But that does not mean that this issue\n       must go to jury if the facts are truly uncontested. . . . We believe that\n       this Court\u2019s language in its opinion (\u201c[a] sexual assault can be\n       considered a service to the police on the theory that part of what [the\n       Officer] was doing was transporting a prisoner\u201d) should be read\n       \u201c[would satisfy] the requirement of a service to the\n       police.\u201d . . . Transporting a prisoner either is or isn\u2019t a service to the\n       police. It\u2019s what the police do following an arrest. . . .\n\n       If it is undisputed that [the Officer] acted as alleged in the course of\n       arresting and transporting [Doe], but this issue (of service to the master)\n       is submitted to the jury, how could any reasonable jury find against\n       [Doe] in light of this [r]ecord and this Court\u2019s [o]pinion? Just how\n       would a trial [j]udge instruct the jury in this case?64\n\n       Doe also argued that the applicability of \u00a7 228\u2019s Foreseeability Prong was an\n\nissue for this Court to resolve as a matter of law, because there was not a dispute of\n\nfact between the parties.65 Rather, Doe asserted that the parties only disagreed about\n\nwhether the Foreseeability Prong was satisfied.\n\n       Doe contended the Officer\u2019s sexual misconduct was foreseeable in the sense\n\nthat it was foreseeable that a police officer might misuse his authority over an\n\narrestee to procure sexual favors and that the only issue to be resolved was a legal\n\n\n64\n  Doe\u2019s Opening Br. at 31\u201233, Sherman v.

By contrast, if \u00a7 228 required specific foreseeability focused on the\n\nOfficer, as the State suggested, Doe admitted she had no evidence that he posed a\n\nspecific risk, and if, as she did not believe was the case, foreseeability of that specific\n\nkind was required, then the State was entitled to a ruling in its favor.67 Doe asked\n\nus to resolve the underlying legal question based on the undisputed facts.\n\n       In our decision in Doe II, we focused almost entirely on the sovereign\n\nimmunity and timeliness issues. We found for Doe on the sovereign immunity issue,\n\nclearing that obstacle to her recovery against the State, and we upheld the Superior\n\nCourt\u2019s ruling that Doe\u2019s claim against the Officer\u2019s estate was time-barred.68\n\n\n\n\n66\n   Id.\n67\n   Id. at 34 (\u201cDoubtless, the State will argue that Colonel M[a]cLeish had no reason to believe that\n[the Officer] would abuse a detainee. But this is not a negligence but a respondeat claim and the\nforeseeability issue focuses not on [the Officer\u2019s] behavior but on that of police officers (and not\njust Delaware State Troopers) as a whole.\u201d); State\u2019s Answering Br. at 32, Sherman v. State, 133\nA.3d 971 (Del. 2016) (\u201cThe State also has identified former supervisors of [the Officer] who\ntestified that they had no knowledge of any discipline problems involving any allegations of sexual\nmisconduct or sexual harassment by [the Officer].\u201d).\n68\n   Sherman v. State, 133 A.3d 971, 979 (Del. 2016) (\u201cDoe did not file a suit against [the Officer\u2019s\nestate] until August 18, 2010, nearly fifteen months after [his] death. However, [the Officer\u2019s\nestate] did not file its motion to dismiss until July 2014. Thus, Doe contends that \u00a7 2102 does not\napply because [the Officer\u2019s estate] waived its protections by waiting so long to file its motion.\nThe Superior Court disagreed with Doe, and held that [as a non-claim statute] \u00a7 2102\u2019s protections\ncannot be waived. . . . [W]e hold that \u00a7 2102 is a non-claim statute. Accordingly, the Superior\nCourt correctly granted [the Officer\u2019s estate\u2019s] motion to dismiss under \u00a7 2102 despite [the\nestate\u2019s] delay in bringing that motion.\u201d).\n                                                26\n\f      We said nothing about the merits of Doe\u2019s extensive argument that she was\n\nentitled to summary judgment on \u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation and Foreseeability Prongs.\n\nInstead, we relied on the law of the case doctrine and indicated that Doe I said that\n\nthe question of whether \u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation and Foreseeability Prongs were satisfied\n\nwas for the jury to decide. We did not focus at all on whether there was any triable\n\nissue of fact as to whether the Officer\u2019s misconduct was motivated in part by a desire\n\nto serve his employer. And we did not discuss the issue of whether general\n\nforeseeability was enough to satisfy \u00a7 228\u2019s Foreseeability Prong, or whether\n\nspecific foreseeability was required.\n\n                   E.         Jury Trial and Motion for New Trial\n\n      After our decision, the Superior Court held a trial and was required to turn our\n\ndecisions into sensible instructions for the jury. The reason why the parties and the\n\nSuperior Court struggled in fashioning jury instructions on the issue is simple: the\n\nparties\u2019 difference of opinion did not involve issues of fact for the jury to resolve.\n\nDoe did not allege that the Officer was motivated by his official responsibilities to\n\nthe State to seek oral sex from her. And, for its part, the State did not argue that the\n\noral sex occurred outside the period when the Officer had Doe in his custody and\n\nunder valid arrest. In other words, there was no fact question about \u00a7 228\u2019s\n\nMotivation Prong for the jury to resolve.\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f      But because our prior decisions gave no guidance, the Superior Court\u2019s\n\ninstruction was just a rote reiteration of the \u00a7 228 test for scope of employment, and\n\ndid not frame a case-specific fact question for the jury to resolve. The Superior\n\nCourt\u2019s jury instruction was:\n\n      [I]f you find that [the Officer] committed the wrongful act, then you\n      must next determine whether [the Officer] was acting in the ordinary\n      course of employment during the time frame within which the wrongful\n      act was committed. The relevant test is not whether the wrongful\n      conduct was authorized by the State, but whether the service itself was\n      within the scope of employment and, thus, within the ordinary course\n      of the State\u2019s business.\n      [The Officer] was acting within the scope of his employment if, and\n      only if, you find all of the following by a preponderance of the\n      evidence:\n         1. The conduct was of a type that [the Officer] was hired to perform;\n         2. The conduct occurred substantially within the authorized time\n            and space limits of his work;\n         3. The conduct was motivated, at least in part, by an intent to serve\n            his employer, on this factor, even if [the Officer] was motivated\n            in part by a personal desire to commit the wrongful act, his\n            conduct may still be attributed to the State where his conduct was\n            also motivated by a desire to serve the defendant.\n      AND\n         4. If force was used, the use of force was not unexpectable; i.e. the\n            force was reasonably foreseeable.\n      However, [the Officer\u2019s] conduct was not within the scope of his\n      employment if his conduct was:\n        I.   Different in kind from what was authorized by his employer;\n       II.   Far beyond the authorized time or space limits of his\n             employment;\n\n                                         28\n\f       III.   Too little motivated by an intent to serve his employer;\n       OR\n       IV.    Involved force that was not reasonably foreseeable.69\n\n\nWhat the jury was supposed to decide was left ambiguous, because the Superior\n\nCourt received no definitive guidance from this Court about whether the Motivation\n\nProng could only be satisfied if the oral sex itself was motivated in part by the\n\nOfficer\u2019s desire to serve the State.\n\n       At the prayer conference, Doe requested that the Motivation Prong of the\n\n\u00a7 228 instruction specify that it was the Officer\u2019s general conduct of arresting and\n\ntransporting Doe, and not the oral sex, that needed to be motivated by a desire to\n\nserve the State. Doe argued that \u201cof course [the oral sex] was not authorized, of\n\ncourse it is not a benefit to the State. If that is the test, we might [a]s well just leave.\n\nThat is not the test, because an intentional tort\u2014this intentional tort will never be of\n\nservice to the State.\u201d70\n\n       The Superior Court rejected Doe\u2019s request to edit the instruction, despite\n\nacknowledging that it is \u201ccommon sense to say that the sexual act itself was\n\nobviously not within the scope of his employment.\u201d71 Citing Doe I, the Superior\n\nCourt reasoned that its hands were tied as to what instruction it could give:\n\n\n69\n   App. to Opening Br. at 472\u201373 (Jury Instructions).\n70\n   Prayer Conf.

That is what I am going to do.72\n       The Superior Court also denied Doe\u2019s request to instruct the jury that the\n\nForeseeability Prong is satisfied by showing \u201ca general problem, anywhere in the\n\ncountry, anywhere within police work, and not limited to the Delaware State\n\nPolice.\u201d73 Doe proposed the following instruction:\n\n       In this case, Colonel MacLeish, the former head of the Delaware State\n       Police in 2009, testified. If you find that Colonel MacLeish was aware\n       of a general problem within law enforcement that some police officers\n       had sexually assaulted people in their custody then it was not\n       completely unforeseeable to the State that such wrongful conduct could\n       occur.\n       The general problem of sexual abuse by arresting police officers does\n       not have to have involved the State Police or any police in Delaware\u2014\n       it is enough if on a nationwide basis there was a general problem. Also,\n       the problem did not have to involve a majority of police officers, it is\n       enough if it were a very small number of officers.74\n\n\nDespite recognizing that the \u201cparticular injury suffered does not have to be\n\nforeseeable,\u201d and that the question is not whether it was \u201cforeseeable that he,\n\nmeaning [the] Officer [], would do this, but only that this risk existed,\u201d75 the Superior\n\nCourt rejected Doe\u2019s proposed instruction and instructed the jury on that issue in this\n\nmore generic way:\n\n\n72\n   Id. at 52:17\u201322.\n73\n   Id. at 11:4\u20136.\n74\n   Sherman v.

It is not necessary that the particular injury suffered was itself\n       reasonable, but only that the risk of injury existed.76\n\n       The Superior Court also rejected Doe\u2019s efforts to establish that consent was\n\nnot a defense in this case. For example, Doe brought a motion to exclude evidence\n\nof consent from the trial. But the Superior Court rejected that motion, reasoning that\n\nthe criminal charges filed against the Officer did not specify that the sexual contact\n\nwas \u201cunwanted,\u201d and, unlike in the correctional facility context, there was no statute\n\ncriminalizing officer-arrestee sexual interaction and implying that such sex was by\n\nlaw nonconsensual.77\n\n       At the prayer conference, Doe again argued that consent could not be a\n\ndefense to allegations of assault or battery when a woman is in custody.78 The State\n\nargued that whether consent was a defense as a matter of law had already been\n\ndiscussed in the context of Doe\u2019s failed motion,79 that it would not \u201cspecifically\n\nargue consent\u201d in its closing, and that consent remained a \u201cfact question for the\n\n\n\n\n76\n   App. to Opening Br. at 474 (Jury Instructions).\n77\n   Pretrial Conf.

In particular, Doe contended that\n\nthe Superior Court gave the jury no guidance as to how \u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation Prong\n\nwas to be applied or as to whether general foreseeability was enough to satisfy\n\n\u00a7 228\u2019s Foreseeability Prong, and improperly allowed the jury to determine that Doe\n\nvoluntarily consented to the oral sex.89\n\n       In pressing these points, Doe reiterated her view that: i) so long as the oral sex\n\noccurred during the period when the Officer was processing Doe\u2019s arrest, Doe I\n\ncompelled a finding in her favor on \u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation Prong; ii) \u00a7 228\u2019s\n\nForeseeability Prong required only general foreseeability of which there was\n\nunrebutted evidence; and iii) an arrestee may not consent to sex with an arresting\n\nofficer under Delaware law, and thus consent could not be a valid defense.90 The\n\nState took the opposite position on all these points, and stressed that we had said in\n\nboth Doe I and Doe II that the first two issues were ones for a jury to decide, that\n\n\u201cany question of fact on the issue of consent was presented to the jury\u201d by Doe not\n\nthe State, and that Doe had received her day in court and the jury\u2019s finding against\n\nher should be respected.91 The argument that Doe made consent an issue, not the\n\nState, came with some ill grace. Doe had argued that consent, by definition, could\n\nnot be voluntary when given by an arrestee to her arresting officer.

Rather than hazard further confusion, we concluded\n\nthat it would be wise to receive further input on two issues. The first was whether\n\nthe trial court\u2019s inability to craft appropriately tailored jury instructions signaled a\n\nproblem with our earlier rulings that might counsel departure from the law of the\n\ncase. The other was whether the struggles the court and the parties were having with\n\napplying \u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation and Foreseeability Prongs related in part to using that\n\nsection of the Restatement in a context where another related provision of the\n\nRestatement, \u00a7 219, had arguably more sensible application.\n\n\n92\n   One of our respected colleagues in dissent suggests that the State did not \u201cby express terms\ncharge that the sex occurred without [Doe\u2019s] consent.\u201d Dissent at 9 (Vaughn, J., dissenting). He\nis correct that the \u201cexpress terms\u201d of the State\u2019s charges (which included Sexual Exploitation) do\nnot literally state that the coerced sex occurred without the victim\u2019s consent. But, as we will\ndiscuss later, sex \u201cwithout consent,\u201d as defined by the section of our criminal law defining sex\ncrimes, includes sex to which \u201cthe defendant compelled the victim to submit by any act of coercion\nas defined in \u00a7 791,\u201d and \u00a7 791 defines the crime of coercion to include the scenario in which a\npublic servant uses or abuses their position \u201cby performing some act within or related to the\ndefendant\u2019s official duties, or by failing or refusing to perform an official duty in such manner as\nto affect some person adversely.\u201d 11 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 761, 791. The State charged the Officer with\ncommitting Sexual Extortion by intentionally compelling or inducing Doe to engage in oral sex by\ninstilling a fear in her that \u201cif the sexual act [wa]s not performed,\u201d the Officer would have \u201ctake[n]\nthe victim before the Court to appear on a capias.\u201d App. to Opening Br. at 134 (Complaint and\nWarrant for [the Officer]). Thus, in substance, the State charged the Officer with having threatened\nto \u201cperform an official duty in such manner as to affect some person adversely\u201d and thereby\ncoercing oral sex from Doe. For this reason, under the State\u2019s Sexual Exploitation charge and \u00a7\n761, the oral sex at issue here was by definition non-consensual. 11 Del. C. \u00a7\u00a7 761, 791.\n                                                 35\n\f       We did not do so lightly. But, when we pressed Doe\u2019s lawyer as to why he\n\ndid not, for example, move for summary judgment again on the Motivation and\n\nForeseeability Prongs on remand from Doe II, he argued that he already sought\n\nclarity in Doe II and had been rebuffed.93 Upon our review of the record, we also\n\nrealized that he had fairly argued \u00a7 219(2)(d) in Doe I,94 and that we had ignored\n\nthat argument.\n\n       We also took into account that, by failing to identify whether it was the\n\nwrongful conduct itself that had to be motivated in part by the Officer\u2019s desire to\n\nserve his employer to satisfy \u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation Prong, we left the Superior Court\n\nto hand to the jury a question of common law legal policy, not a case-specific\n\nquestion of fact. Not only that, by suggesting that the oral sex need not be motivated\n\nby a desire to serve the employer if it occurred during the course of \u201ctransporting a\n\nprisoner,\u201d95 we also risked confusing the proper inquiry under \u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation\n\nProng in all kinds of cases, by importing into it ambiguities generated by Doe I\u2019s\n\nlegitimate concern over the serious nature of the police misconduct Doe alleged.\n\n\n\n\n93\n    Oral Argument at 1:39\u20132:25, Sherman v.

Analysis\n\n       We now wrestle with the issues on appeal in this order. First, we grapple with\n\nthe question of whether we should adhere to the law of the case and conclude that it\n\nis in the interests of justice to examine this case with a fresh eye. Second, we address\n\nthe specific issues that our prior opinions hedged. Initially, whether the employee\u2019s\n\nwrongful conduct itself must be motivated in part by a desire to serve the employer\n\nto satisfy the Motivation Prong of \u00a7 228. From there, we clarify whether general or\n\nspecific foreseeability is required to satisfy \u00a7 228\u2019s Foreseeability Prong. Then, we\n\nconsider the relevance of \u00a7 219 and whether two of its subsections apply and relieve\n\nDoe of the obligation to show that the Officer\u2019s sexual misconduct fell within the\n\nscope of his employment under \u00a7 228. Finally, we address the State\u2019s defense to\n\nliability that rests on the proposition that an arrestee may consent to sex with her\n\narresting officer.\n\n                            A.     The Law of the Case Doctrine\n\n       We depart from the law of the case and decide important issues raised by this\n\nappeal with fresh eyes because the interests of justice require us to do so.98\n\n       We respect that the State argues that because \u201cboth parties tried this case\n\naccording to the legal rule set down by the Court in Doe I and reaffirmed in Doe II,\u201d\n\n\n98\n   Gannett Co. v. Kanaga, 750 A.2d 1174, 1181 (Del. 2000) (holding that the law of the case\ndoctrine \u201cis not an absolute bar to reconsideration of a prior decision . . . . [that] produces an\ninjustice\u201d).\n                                               38\n\f\u201cit would not be unjust to the parties to allow this verdict to stand.\u201d99                       We\n\nacknowledge that this case has many years on it now, and we understand the State\u2019s\n\nlegitimate concern about a late change in direction. But to the extent that Doe I\n\nestablished \u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation and Foreseeability Prongs as issues for the jury, that\n\n\u201claw of the case\u201d was only binding for so long as there were outstanding issues of\n\nfact related to those prongs. Although Doe I was correct that \u201cthe question of\n\nwhether a tortfeasor is acting within the scope of his employment is fact-specific,\n\nand, ordinarily, is for the jury to decide,\u201d100 the question of whether tortious conduct\n\nfalls within the scope of employment is \u201cdecided by the court if the answer is clearly\n\nindicated.\u201d101\n\n       The undisputed facts of this case turned the Motivation and Foreseeability\n\nProngs into questions of law. Either it was the Officer\u2019s sexual misconduct or his\n\narrest and transport of Doe that needed to be motivated in part by a desire to serve\n\nhis employer. If the former, judgment should have been entered for the State on the\n\nissue of liability because Doe did not allege that the oral sex was so motivated. If\n\n\n\n\n99\n   State\u2019s Supp. Br. at 5.\n100\n    Doe v. State, 76 A.3d 774, 776 (Del. 2013).\n101\n    Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 228 cmt. d (1958); see generally Hyman Reiver & Co. v.\nRose, 147 A.2d 500, 503 (Del. 1958) (\u201c[W]here the facts are such that reasonable minds can draw\nbut one conclusion, it is the duty of the Court to decide the question and not to require the jury to\ndeliberate upon evidence from which they can draw but one possible conclusion.\u201d) (citations\nomitted).\n                                                39\n\fthe latter, judgment on the Motivation Prong should have been entered in Doe\u2019s\n\nfavor because the Officer was processing a valid arrest.\n\n      Likewise, the unresolved issue about foreseeability was one of law, not fact.\n\nIf it was sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 228\u2019s Foreseeability Prong that it be foreseeable as a\n\ngeneral matter that a police officer might misuse his authority to obtain sex from an\n\narrestee, then judgment on the Foreseeability Prong was due to Doe because there\n\nwas unrebutted evidence of general foreseeability of that kind. If, by contrast, Doe\n\ncould only satisfy the Foreseeability Prong by showing that it was specifically\n\nforeseeable that the Officer posed a risk of sexual misconduct, then judgment on the\n\nForeseeability Prong was owed to the State, as Doe produced no evidence that there\n\nwere any warning signs that the Officer posed a specific risk of this kind.\n\n      The effects of this Court\u2019s error in remanding the Motivation and\n\nForeseeability Prong issues under \u00a7 228 instead of answering them as a matter of\n\nlaw, and doing so without giving any guidance on how to tailor the required jury\n\ninstructions, were compounded by the Superior Court\u2019s hesitation to edit the pattern\n\n\u00a7 228 instruction. The question presented to the jury failed to clarify whether the\n\nMotivation Prong applied to the Officer\u2019s wrongful conduct or the general course of\n\nconduct within which that wrongful act occurred. Likewise, the jury instruction did\n\nnot clarify whether the Foreseeability Prong required officer-specific or general\n\nforeseeability. Without these clarifications, the Superior Court\u2019s instruction could\n\n                                          40\n\fnot \u201creasonably inform\u201d the jury about the questions they were being asked to\n\nanswer.102\n\n       Because we said in both Doe I and Doe II that these questions were ones for\n\nthe jury, and gave no guidance as to how to resolve the legal issues underlying them,\n\nwe do not fault the Superior Court for its reluctance to come down on one side of\n\neach of the issues, or its decision to give the jury instructions that simply parroted\n\nthe terms of \u00a7 228.103 But we did sense on the part of the Superior Court a broader\n\ndisinclination to shape jury instructions involving standard provisions of law like\n\n\u00a7 228 into more case-specific instructions that focus the jury on what its role is in\n\nanswering the relevant fact questions necessary to render a fair verdict in the case\n\nbefore it. And if that broader disinclination was the only basis for its reticence, we\n\nwould be more willing to be critical, because jury instructions should be tailored to\n\nthe specific dispute, a task that often requires the judge to isolate the fact questions\n\nthat are relevant under the law to the actual case before the jury. 104 But here, the\n\n\n102\n    Storey v. Camper, 401 A.2d 458, 465 (Del. 1979).\n103\n    We note that the Superior Court erred in including \u00a7 228\u2019s first two prongs in its scope of\nemployment instruction, despite the fact that Doe I already held that those prongs were satisfied\nas a matter of law. Doe v. State, 76 A.3d 774, 777 (Del. 2013) (\u201c[The Officer] was in uniform,\non-duty, carrying out a police duty by transporting [Doe] to court. The sexual assault took place\nin the police car, during the time that [the Officer] was supposed to be carrying out police duties.\nThese facts would satisfy the first two factors under the Restatement\u2014[the Officer] was doing the\nkind of work he was employed to perform, and he was acting within authorized time and space\nlimits.\u201d).\n104\n    See Zimmerman v. State, 565 A.2d 887, 890 (Del. 1989) (\u201cThe primary purpose of jury\ninstructions is to define with substantial particularity the factual issues, and clearly to instruct the\njury as to the principles of law which they are to apply in deciding the factual issues involved in\nthe case before them.\u201d); Herring v. State, 805 A.2d 872, 876 (Del. 2002) (\u201cTrial judges may\n                                                  41\n\fSuperior Court\u2019s reticence was understandable, given that this Court failed on two\n\noccasions to provide any insight to help the trial court determine what was required\n\nto satisfy, as a matter of law, the Motivation and Foreseeability Prongs of \u00a7 228, and\n\nindicated that the jury was supposed to decide whether the State was liable based on\n\nhearing the evidence and being given the rote terms of \u00a7 228 in the form of a\n\nquestion.\n\n       Moreover, because of the ambiguity of Doe I, there is a possibility that failure\n\nto clarify in this appeal what the Motivation Prong means could have a negative\n\neffect on other cases involving \u00a7 228. By ignoring Doe\u2019s arguments regarding \u00a7 219\n\nin Doe I, we left in place precedent rejecting a provision of the Restatement that is\n\nintended to provide exceptions to \u00a7 228, and to address difficult cases of this kind,\n\nand risked establishing an imbalanced approach to respondeat superior that could\n\ndistort \u00a7 228\u2019s application in order to address inequities its rote application would\n\nhave, if one proceeds under the assumption that \u00a7 228 should not give way when\n\n\u00a7 219 suggests it should.\n\n       Lastly, although cases like this are rare, that does not mean they are not\n\nimportant.

Doe I\u2019s analogy to Draper did little to answer this doctrinal\n\nquestion because Doe never alleged that the Officer\u2019s sexual misconduct was even\n\npartially motivated by his desire to serve his employer.\n\n       As we have discussed, Draper is a mixed-motive case. The defendant in\n\nDraper was charged with controlling the flow of traffic for his employer and stabbed\n\na motorist intruding into the restricted area.107 In Doe I we stated that:\n\n       [i]f the act of cutting someone\u2019s throat can be considered a service to\n       the employer paving company on the theory that the employee was\n       controlling traffic, then a sexual assault can be considered a service to\n       the police on the theory that part of what [the Officer] was doing was\n       transporting a prisoner.108\n\nBut that statement did more to obscure than to illuminate the key issue. The fact that\n\nthe Officer received oral sex during the same timeframe when he was processing\n\n\n\n\nacted to override that interpretation. But it is the duty of the courts to ensure that the common law\nis as fair and efficient as humanly possible, taking into account evolving societal conditions and\nthe problems created by past rulings. See generally OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES, THE COMMON\nLAW (1881). We should not adhere to all past common law precedent until such time as the\nGeneral Assembly enacts a statute overriding a judicial precedent addressing a subject traditionally\ngoverned by judicially-determined common law, especially given the General Assembly\u2019s\nreluctance to intrude in areas of law it has chosen to leave to the common law to address.\n107\n    Draper, 181 A.2d 567.\n108\n    Doe v. State, 76 A.3d 774, 777 (Del. 2013) (citations omitted).\n                                                44\n\fDoe\u2019s arrest does nothing to address whether \u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation Prong applies to\n\nthe specific wrongful act (i.e., the receipt of oral sex) or the overall course of conduct\n\nwithin which the wrongful conduct occurred.\n\n       Upon close examination of the Restatement, it is apparent to us that \u00a7 228\u2019s\n\nMotivation Prong focuses on the wrongful conduct itself. Cases like Draper exist\n\nbecause the Restatement recognizes that there are situations where the wrongful\n\nconduct can have more than one motive, especially where the employee is charged\n\nwith duties like security or law enforcement where some degree of force is often\n\nrequired to serve the employer faithfully.109 To satisfy \u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation Prong,\n\nthe allegedly tortious conduct must be \u201cactuated, at least in part, by a purpose to\n\nserve the master.\u201d110 The examples and discussion in the commentary to \u00a7 228 make\n\n\n\n\n109\n    Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 245 cmt. a (1958) (\u201c[T]he liability of the principal depends\nfundamentally upon the likelihood of a battery or other tort in view of the kind of result to be\naccomplished, the customs of the enterprise and the nature of the persons normally employed for\ndoing the work. . . .

If Doe was required to satisfy the\n\nMotivation Prong of \u00a7 228, she could not, and judgment was owed to the State on\n\nthat ground. That reality underscores why Doe originally argued that \u00a7 219 relieved\n\nher of the need to satisfy \u00a7 228, and why we examine \u00a7 219\u2019s relevance in this\n\ndecision.\n\n                       C.

From Doe I on, the parties have assumed that \u00a7 228\u2019s Foreseeability Prong,\n\nwhich requires that, \u201cif force is used, the use of force is not unexpectable,\u201d applies\n\nto this case, likely because Doe\u2019s original complaint sued the State for the torts of\n\nassault and battery.114 In Doe I, we held that foreseeability was a jury issue, while\n\nciting to cases for the proposition that \u201csexual assaults by police officers and others\n\nin positions of authority are foreseeable risks.\u201d115\n\n       As has been discussed, the parties disagree on what \u00a7 228\u2019s Foreseeability\n\nProng requires in the context of police sexual misconduct.

That does not\n       mean, however, that in some circumstances, as in the present case, this\n       type of sexual misconduct by an officer is not reasonably foreseeable\n       for vicarious liability purposes.117\n\nThe reality is that there is no question of fact in this case that the Foreseeability\n\nProng was satisfied. In defending against the State\u2019s initial motion for summary\n\njudgment and in later seeking summary judgment on the issue herself, Doe put in\n\nthe summary judgment record evidence that \u201cindividual State Troopers commit[ted]\n\n\n116\n    Other jurisdictions have found police sexual misconduct foreseeable by an assessment of the\ngeneral nature of the profession.

Indeed, \u00a7 219\u2019s existence\n\nunderscores why this Court has struggled with this case. However ambiguous Doe\n\nI was in articulating a mandate for the Superior Court to follow, Doe I\u2019s equitable\n\nfoundation is consistent with our recognition of \u00a7 219. Although Doe I was terse, it\n\nis obvious that the Court was rightly concerned about allowing the State to escape\n\nliability when one of its police officers, in the course of making and processing a\n\nvalid arrest, misused his legal authority over an arrestee to coerce her into\n\nperforming sexual acts on him in order to escape spending time in jail.\n\n       Other courts have found that two of \u00a7 219\u2019s exceptions operate to address this\n\nconcern: \u00a7 219(2)(d), which provides for respondeat superior liability outside the\n\nscope of employment when the tortfeasor was \u201caided in accomplishing the tort by\n\n\n\n126\n    Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219 cmt. e (1958).\n127\n    Id. \u00a7 228 cmt. a (\u201cIn addition, a master may be liable if a servant speaks or acts, purporting to\ndo so on behalf of his principal, and there is reliance upon his apparent authority or he is aided in\naccomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.

An employee\u2019s act is not within the scope of employment when it occurs\n       within an independent course of conduct not intended by the employee to serve any\n       purpose of the employer.\n\nState\u2019s Supp. Br. at 16; Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 7.07 (2006). But we decline to apply the\nRestatement (Third) here because our State has embraced the Restatement (Second) of Agency,\nand \u00a7 228 in particular, for decades now, and the \u00a7 228 test works well to fairly determine when\nrespondeat superior liability is appropriate. Hecksher v. Fairwinds Baptist Church, Inc., 115 A.3d\n1187, 1200 (Del. 2015); Wilson v. Joma, Inc., 537 A.2d 187 (Del. 1988); Coates v. Murphy, 270\nA.2d 527 (Del. 1970). We are therefore reluctant to abandon it. We also note that the Restatement\n(Third)\u2019s Reporter\u2019s Notes indicate that jurisdictions \u201care not in accord on the appropriate standard\nfor vicarious liability when an employee commits an intentional tort involving sexual misconduct\nin connection with the employee\u2019s work,\u201d and that some \u201ccases [continue to] analyze employee\nsexual misconduct using a standard based on [the Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219(2)(d)].\u201d\nRestatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 7.05 Reporter\u2019s Note e (2006). Not only that, but we also note\nthat the Restatement (Third) appears to otherwise recognize the continuing vitality of \u00a7 219(2)(c)\nand (d) and that the theories underlying them are embedded in the broader treatment of apparent\n                                                53\n\f                                   i.       Section 219(2)(d)\n\n       Here, it is plain to us that the Officer was \u201caided in accomplishing the tort by\n\nthe existence of the agency relation.\u201d131 According to Doe\u2019s testimony, the Officer\n\ntold her that if she performed oral sex on him, he would release her. But if she failed\n\nto comply, the Officer would make her spend the weekend in jail.132 From the\n\nstandpoint of an ordinary person, this threat would have real force. But the force of\n\nthat threat is not dependent on a belief that the Officer had the actual authority to\n\ndemand sex for favorable treatment, as the State suggested it must be, to trigger\n\nliability under respondeat superior.133\n\n\n\nauthority under the Restatement (Third). Id. \u00a7 7.08 (\u201cSection 219(2)(d) concludes with a further\ngeneral basis for an employer\u2019s vicarious liability, which is whether an employee \u2018was aided in\naccomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.\u2019 This Restatement does not include\n\u2018aided in accomplishing\u2019 as a distinct basis for an employer\u2019s (or principal\u2019s) vicarious liability.\nThe purposes likely intended to be met by the \u2018aided in accomplishing\u2019 basis are satisfied by a\nmore fully elaborated treatment of apparent authority and by the duty of reasonable care that a\nprincipal owes to third parties with whom it interacts through employees and other agents.

And if she attempted to tell the magistrate\n\nwhat he did, she might fear that she would be disbelieved by a magistrate who may\n\nhave dealt with the Officer in other cases, and perhaps get even worse treatment for\n\nappearing to have falsely accused a member of law enforcement of wrongdoing.\n\nFear of that kind would be reasonable, as someone in Doe\u2019s position would assume\n\nthe Officer would lie to the court. The record here illustrates how rational a fear of\n\nthat kind would be, because the Officer denied that the oral sex occurred when first\n\nconfronted with Doe\u2019s complaint,136 and only admitted it when he was later\n\n\n\n\npolice officer had to take her to Court on her outstanding capias.

Because he\nwas the manager of the inn, Bonney knew exactly where to find Costos. The jury could find that\nBonney had responsibilities to be at the inn or to have others there late at night. In short, because\nhe was the defendants\u2019 agent, Bonney knew that Costos was staying at the Bernard House, he was\nable to find Costos\u2019 room late at night, he had the key to the room and used the key to unlock the\ndoor, slip into bed beside her as she slept, and rape her.\u201d).\n                                                  56\n\fsexual assault on the plaintiff by the existence of the employment relationship with\n\nthe law enforcement agency.\u201d139\n\n       The policy basis for doing so was well stated by the United States Court of\n\nAppeals for the Seventh Circuit in Norris v.

Here, for\n\nexample, there is no question that the Officer was aided in accomplishing the sexual\n\nmisconduct by his position of authority, because \u201cthe wrongful acts flowed from the\n\nvery exercise of this authority.\u201d141 Had he not been \u201cin uniform, in a marked patrol\n\nvehicle\u201d and effectuating an arrest, Doe \u201cwould not have stopped at his direction and\n\nthe events that followed would not have occurred.\u201d142\n\n\n139\n    Doe v.

However important plumbers, electricians, accountants, and myriad\n\nother providers of services are to their customers, none of them wield the potent\n\ncoercive power entrusted to our police under our laws.143 None of these employees\n\nhave the presumptive legal authority to deprive a person of her liberty and subject\n\nher to a period of incarceration. By contrast, that is the authority our police officers\n\npossess, which is enforced by criminal laws punishing arrestees for resisting any\n\nexercise of their authority.\n\n       Arrestees are by definition required to surrender their control and autonomy\n\nto the State upon their arrest. The Delaware Criminal Code \u201cgives no right to resist\n\nan arrest by a police officer, whether or not the arrest was lawful and whether or not\n\nthe accused knew the arrester was a police officer.\u201d144 In fact, it is a class G felony\n\nto resist arrest with force or violence, and a class A misdemeanor to peacefully resist\n\narrest.145\n\n\n\n\n143\n    See Doe v. City of Chi., 360 F.3d 667, 671 (7th Cir. 2004) (\u201cThe situation of a police officer,\nhowever, is significantly different from that of a meter reader.

Instead, the focus in terms\n\nof the level of care is on the employee and if the employee has committed a tort, say\n\ninvolving negligence, then the question is whether the employer should also be liable\n\nbecause the employee\u2019s conduct occurred on the job.157 For example, if a UPS driver\n\n\n\n\n156\n    State\u2019s Supp. Br. at 10 (arguing that applying \u00a7 219\u2019s exceptions to the scope of employment\nrequirement in cases like this one \u201cwould impose some form of strict liability against local or state\npolice departments\u201d).\n157\n    Compare Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 213 (describing factors for assessing whether an\nemployer\u2019s conduct was negligent or reckless and should result in direct liability) with id. \u00a7 228 (1)\n(describing factors for assessing whether an employee\u2019s conduct should result in vicarious liability\nfor the employer).\n                                                 62\n\fdelivering a Christmas gift is at fault in a fender-bender, UPS is liable under\n\nrespondeat superior, without any inquiry into its fault.\n\n       We also disagree with the State that by adopting \u00a7 219, we are somehow\n\nchoosing to forsake \u00a7 228 for another framework. The authors of the Restatement\n\nenvisioned that \u00a7 228 and \u00a7 219 would operate in tandem.158 As this case and other\n\ndecisions illustrate, ignoring \u00a7 219 and putting all the weight on \u00a7 228 can give rise\n\nto the temptation to misinterpret \u00a7 228 to deal with cases when allowing the\n\nemployer to escape respondeat superior liability would otherwise be inequitable.159\n\n\n158\n    Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 228 cmt. a (1958) (\u201cIn addition, a master may be liable if a\nservant speaks or acts, purporting to do so on behalf of his principal, and there is reliance upon his\napparent authority or he is aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.\nSee Comment e on \u00a7 219 for illustrations.\u201d); id. \u00a7 219 cmt. e (Section 219 \u201cenumerates the\nsituations in which a master may be liable for torts of servants acting solely for their own purposes\nand hence not in the scope of employment\u201d).\n159\n    The concern we have with using \u00a7 228 in isolation from \u00a7 219 is illustrated by certain cases in\nwhich courts find police departments liable in sexual assault cases, but do so by reading \u00a7 228 or\nan equivalent scope-of-employment test elastically, particularly their Motivation Prongs, rather\nthan by use of an exception to that test. E.g., Doe v. Clavijo, 72 F. Supp. 3d 910, 915 (N.D.

Consent Not a Defense\n\n       We reach the last contested issue on appeal. As we have noted, when the\n\nOfficer was originally confronted with Doe\u2019s complaint, he denied that there was\n\nany sexual contact between them. It was only when he was confronted with the\n\nexistence of DNA evidence that he changed his story, which then became that Doe\n\nsomehow became amorous with him during the course of the arrest and that he\n\nsuccumbed to her desire for him. That the State disbelieved the Officer is, Doe\n\nargues, demonstrated by the fact that it charged him with Sexual Extortion.160 That\n\ncrime has elements that are inconsistent with the Officer\u2019s version of events: the\n\nOfficer must have intentionally compelled Doe to give him oral sex by \u201cinstilling in\n\n[her] a fear that if the sexual act [was] not performed\u201d he would take her to court and\n\n\nProng where there was no evidence that the sex was motivated by a desire to serve the police\nofficer\u2019s employer, but still finding there was a \u201cgenuine dispute as to\u201d whether the officer\u2019s sexual\nassault of an arrestee fell within the scope of his employment because the officer accomplished the\nassault \u201cbecause of his position as [a] police officer and the attendant power such a position\ncarries\u201d); see also Fearing v. Bucher, 977 P.2d 1163, 1166\u201367 (Or. 1999) (purporting to apply\n\u00a7 228\u2019s Motivation Prong, but still finding that \u201ca jury could infer that the sexual assaults were the\nculmination of a progressive series of actions that began with and continued to involve Bucher\u2019s\nperformance of the ordinary and authorized duties of a priest. . . . [T]he jury also could infer that,\nin cultivating a relationship with plaintiff and his family, Bucher, at least initially, was motivated\nby a desire to fulfill his priestly duties and that, over time, his motives became mixed\u201d). To our\nmind, it is preferable not to succumb to the natural equitable tug of cases like these in order to read\n\u00a7 228 as giving rise to respondeat superior liability, but thereby giving an interpretation to \u00a7 228\nthat is at odds with its plain meaning and the official commentary, and also makes it difficult to\napply in other contexts.\n160\n    App. to Opening Br. at 134 (Complaint and Warrant for [the Officer]).\n                                                 64\n\fshe would spend the weekend in jail.161 The other crime that the State charged the\n\nOfficer with, Receiving a Bribe, is also inconsistent with the State\u2019s contention that\n\nthe oral sex was freely given. Under that charge, the State sought to hold the Officer\n\ncriminally liable for \u201csolicit[ing] a personal benefit from another person for having\n\nviolated his duty\u201d to bring Doe in on her capias.162\n\n       By the time of trial, the Officer was dead and the State\u2019s only evidence in\n\nsupport of its consent defense was the Officer\u2019s second statement. Because Doe was\n\nalso deceased, she was not available to testify in person at trial either. On this record,\n\nand in the face of its inconsistent criminal charges against the officer, the State\n\ninsisted on preserving the defense that Doe could have voluntarily consented to the\n\noral sex, and that if she did, the State was not liable.163 And the Superior Court\n\nrejected Doe\u2019s argument that an arrestee could not consent to sex with her arresting\n\nofficer and instead instructed the jury on assault and battery in such a way that\n\nwhether the sex was consensual was an issue for \u201cthe jury to figure out.\u201d164\n\n       We do not agree with the State that, under Delaware law, an arrestee can give\n\nvoluntary consent to sex with her arresting officer when she is under arrest.

Because of this power imbalance, the\n\nModel Penal Code states that sexual conduct with another person when \u201cthe other\n\nperson is in custody of law or detained in a hospital or other institution and the actor\n\nhas supervisory or disciplinary authority over him\u201d constitutes sexual assault.165\n\n       Although Delaware has not adopted that provision of the Model Penal Code,\n\nour Criminal Code does define a sexual act \u201cwithout consent\u201d as occurring when\n\n\u201c[t]he defendant compelled the victim to submit by any act of coercion,\u201d166 defined\n\nto include threatening to \u201c[u]se or abuse the defendant\u2019s position as a public servant\n\nby performing some act within or related to the defendant\u2019s official duties, or by\n\nfailing or refusing to perform an official duty in such manner as to affect some person\n\nadversely\u201d if someone does not comply with a demand.167\n\n       The policy rationale for barring consent as a defense to allegations of sexual\n\nmisconduct against a police officer is similar to that for criminalizing sex between\n\nan inmate and a corrections officer:\n\n       The reason why the federal government and almost every state has laws\n       banning even ostensibly voluntary sexual contact between inmates and\n\n165\n    Model Penal Code \u00a7 213.4.\n166\n    11 Del.

In their arguments about consent, the parties cite two United States District\nCourt for the District of Delaware cases that look to 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1259 in their discussions of\nwhether consent should be a defense to an inmate\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim against a corrections\nofficer for sexual assault. The cases have opposing outcomes: Carrigan found that consent cannot\nbe a defense, and Phillips found that it can be. Carrigan v. Davis, 70 F. Supp. 2d 448 (D. Del.\n1999); Phillips v. Bird, 2003 WL 22953175 (D. Del. Dec. 1, 2003). We agree with Carrigan that:\n\n       it is of no import, whether as a factual matter, the Plaintiff invited [the officer] into\n       her room or initiated the sexual encounter. Even if the Plaintiff did these things\n       [which the plaintiff contends she did not do], it does not alter [the officer\u2019s] special\n       responsibilities toward the Plaintiff based on his control and supervision over her.\n\nCarrigan v. Davis, 70 F. Supp. 2d 448, 461 (D. Del. 1999). Phillips distinguished itself from\nCarrigan on the grounds that the plaintiff in Phillips conceded that she \u201cvoluntarily and willingly\u201d\nhad sex with the corrections officer, and the court found \u201cabsolutely no evidence in the record\u201d\nthat the \u201cplaintiff engaged in sexual acts with defendant [] against her will, or that a coercive quid\npro quo scheme was in place.\u201d Phillips, 2003 WL 22953175, at *6. But because of the coercive\nrelationship between an inmate and a prison guard, whereby the inmate may fear saying that the\nsex was not consensual for fear of repercussion, we are not persuaded that the inmate\u2019s admission\nthat the sex was consensual should be taken at face value. And, as a policy matter, even an inmate\u2019s\nconsent should not waive the corrections officer\u2019s professional responsibility to the inmate to\nrefrain from engaging in sexual acts with her.\n170\n    New York recently passed such a statute, clarifying that arrestees are incapable of consenting\nto sex while under arrest.

The Officer of course had\n\nto say that or otherwise confess to the crimes of accepting a bribe and official\n\nmisconduct at the very least.\n\n          But even if one accepts the Officer\u2019s story as creating some dispute of fact\n\nabout what happened, his own story illustrates why voluntary consent is not possible\n\nin the context of Doe\u2019s arrest. Although the Officer claimed that Doe said nothing\n\nabout favorable treatment until after the sex was over, he also said that she said \u201c[i]f\n\nthere is anything you can do with my charges, I would appreciate it\u201d after he let her\n\ngo.179 In other words, even the State\u2019s tenuous embrace of the Officer\u2019s second\n\nstory\u2014which came after he was caught in a lie\u2014shows the inherently coercive and\n\ntransactional, not voluntary, nature of any sex between an arrestee and her arresting\n\nofficer.\n\n          For these reasons, we hold that an arrestee cannot provide voluntary consent\n\nto sex with her arresting officer.\n\n\n\n\n178\n      App. to Opening Br. at 134 (Complaint and Warrant for [the Officer]).\n179\n      Id. at 117 (Interview of [the Officer]).\n                                                 71\n\f                                    F.        Risk Allocation\n\n          Before closing, we address the State\u2019s core argument that the risk of\n\nmisconduct in cases like these should be borne by plaintiffs like Doe, and not\n\nimposed on employing police agencies. We understand that other jurisdictions have\n\ntaken that approach and left victims to recover only against wrongdoing officers\n\nthemselves, most of whom are unlikely to have the personal wealth necessary to\n\nsatisfy a judgment of any sizeable kind.\n\n          Consistent with the policy judgment of \u00a7 219, the unique context of cases of\n\nthis kind makes it sensible in our view for respondeat superior liability to exist.\n\nVictims are poorly positioned to protect themselves from wrongful sexual\n\nmisconduct by arresting officers because, by law, they are not supposed to use even\n\npeaceable means to resist arrest, and the gantlet required to successfully bring and\n\nprove a case like this is daunting at best.\n\n          By contrast, police agencies are well positioned through careful hiring,\n\ntraining, and other practices to address the risk of sexual misconduct by their\n\nofficers. The State Police already engages in some of these activities, including\n\ntraining officers on the proper way to interact with the public, 180 and efforts to\n\nmonitor the time officers spend with arrestees to ensure that it is not suspiciously\n\n\n\n\n180\n      App. to Opening Br. at 384 (Colonel MacLeish Testimony Tr.).\n                                               72\n\flong.181 With developments such as body cameras and other technologies providing\n\nboth video and audio monitoring of police contact with the public, police agencies\n\nshould, we hope, be even better positioned to deter and prevent sexual wrongdoing\n\nby police officers.182 Absent the potential for respondeat superior liability, however,\n\nthe incentives for police agencies to take these steps will be diminished and the risk\n\nof misconduct placed on a class of victims poorly positioned to protect themselves.\n\n                                  IV.         Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons we have discussed, we vacate the jury verdict in this case.\n\nBecause there are no remaining disputes of fact relevant to liability, Doe is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law on that issue against the State Police. On remand, the\n\nSuperior Court shall enter judgment in Doe\u2019s favor on the issue of liability. If the\n\nparties are unable to resolve the sole remaining issue in this case, that of damages,\n\nafter good faith discussions, the Superior Court shall hold a trial on that issue.\n\n\n\n\n181\n    Id.

See, e.g., Former Police Officer Pleads\nGuilty to Attempted Sexual Assault (Apr. 21, 2018), CBS DENVER, http://denver.cbslocal.com/\n2018/04/21/former-pueblo-officer-sexual-assault/ (\u201c[Officer] Candelaria was arrested in\nNovember 2016 after a woman reported that he assaulted her after she called for help in a domestic\nviolence case. . . . Authorities say the officer\u2019s body camera showed him having a sexual\nconversation with the woman, and then the body camera was turned off. The officer later admitted\nhe had contact with the woman.\u201d).\n                                                73\n\fVALIHURA, Justice, dissenting; joined in part\uf02a by VAUGHN, Justice:\n\n          For the reasons explained herein, I decline to join my learned colleagues in\n\nthe Majority.\n\n          As the Majority acknowledges, its decision is an about-face from precedent\u2014\n\nnot just under Delaware Law, but also from our two prior decisions in this litigation,\n\nwhich began nearly eight years ago.\n\n          On August 18, 2010, Doe filed this civil suit against a Delaware State Police\n\nofficer (\u201cOfficer\u201d) and the State. She alleged that the Officer committed the torts of\n\nassault, battery, and rape while she was in his custody following her arrest, and that\n\nthe State must be held liable for damages \u201cpursuant to the principles of agency and/or\n\nthe doctrine of respondeat superior.\u201d On May 7, 2012, the Superior Court granted\n\nthe State\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In doing so, the trial court found, as a\n\nmatter of law, that the Officer was acting outside the scope of his employment when\n\nhe committed such acts and, thus, the State could not be held liable under respondeat\n\nsuperior. The Majority agrees that that should have been the right result applying\n\nthe law as it existed then.\n\n          But, on appeal, this Court reversed the Superior Court\u2019s grant of summary\n\njudgment to the State. In our opinion in Doe v. State (Doe I),1 this Court\u2014with a\n\n\n\n\uf02a   Justice Vaughn joins in part, as reflected in footnote 39 of his dissenting opinion.\n1\n    76 A.3d 774 (Del. 2013) (en banc).\n\fdifferent composition of jurists\u2014held that the question of whether the Officer was\n\nacting within the scope of his employment was fact-specific under the long-accepted\n\ntest for respondeat superior liability, borrowed from Section 228 of the Restatement\n\n(Second) of Agency (the \u201cRestatement\u201d),2 and, as such, was a question for the jury\n\nto decide. Accordingly, on September 12, 2013, we reversed and remanded the\n\nmatter to the Superior Court for further proceedings.\n\n         On July 29, 2014, the Superior Court again granted summary judgment for\n\nthe State. This time it did so finding that the State was shielded from liability under\n\nthe doctrine of sovereign immunity. The trial court denied Doe\u2019s motion for\n\nsummary judgment because, under the law of the case, as this Court held in Doe I,\n\nthe jury had to decide certain factors relevant to determining whether the tortfeasor\n\nacted within the scope of employment so as to satisfy the requirements for\n\nrespondeat superior liability. Later, on April 8, 2015, the Superior Court also\n\ngranted the Officer\u2019s estate\u2019s motion to dismiss because 12 Del. C. \u00a7 2102(a)\n\nrequires that all claims against an estate be asserted within eight months following\n\nthe death of the decedent, and Doe had first brought suit fifteen months after the\n\nOfficer passed away. Doe appealed those rulings.\n\n\n\n\n2\n    Restatement (Second) of Agency (1958) [hereinafter Restatement].\n                                                2\n\f         Then, in Sherman v. State (Doe II),3 this Court, sitting en banc, reversed on\n\nsovereign immunity: the State waived that defense because its insurance policy\n\ncovered the Officer\u2019s acts. But we affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s ruling denying\n\nDoe\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We stated that \u201c[t]he Superior Court [had]\n\ncorrectly determined that our 2013 holding is the law of the case,\u201d and we reaffirmed\n\nDoe I\u2019s holding that the scope of employment issue presented questions for the jury.4\n\n         We also affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the Officer\u2019s estate as a\n\ndefendant. Thus, a finding of liability against the State was the only means for the\n\nestate of Doe, who had since passed away, to recover damages.\n\n         On remand, following a three-day civil trial, the jury found that the State was\n\nnot liable for the allegedly tortious conduct of the Officer. On May 8, 2017, the\n\nSuperior Court denied Doe\u2019s motions for a new trial and to set aside the verdict.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n         Doe\u2019s arguments on appeal focus on the alleged defects in the jury instructions\n\n(which all parties agree are correct as a matter of law), the permissibility of certain\n\ndefenses, and the propriety of the State\u2019s closing argument at trial. Yet the Majority\n\ngoes far beyond Doe\u2019s precise arguments. Absent the request of any party, the\n\nMajority reverses our holding in Doe I that the third factor of the test for respondeat\n\n\n\n3\n    133 A.3d 971 (Del. 2016) (en banc).\n4\n    Id. at 979.\n                                            3\n\fsuperior liability\u2014whether the Officer was motivated at least in part by a desire to\n\nserve his employer in committing the tortious acts\u2014\u201chas been construed broadly as\n\na matter for the jury to decide.\u201d5 The Majority also sua sponte reverses our decision\n\nin Doe II to let that decision stand as law of the case.\n\n         And the Majority travels even beyond reversing two of our prior decisions in\n\nthis same litigation, which, standing alone, the Majority acknowledges would have\n\nrequired finding for the State. For policy reasons, it refuses to apply the recognized\n\ntest in Delaware for adjudicating claims of respondeat superior and instead adopts a\n\nnew test, from Restatement Section 219(2)(d)\u2014never before applied in Delaware,\n\nand rarely adopted in other states. The end result is that the Majority rules for Doe\n\nas a matter of law.\n\n         The Majority points to a narrow exception to the law of the case doctrine and\n\nasserts that adhering to our prior rulings would produce an \u201cinjustice.\u201d But the\n\nalleged injustice is based on an incorrect premise, as explained below, and there is\n\nno precedent for applying that exception under circumstances presented here. Even\n\nmore, the Majority sua sponte imposes a novel, non-delegable duty on the State to\n\nguard against seemingly all intentional torts committed by law enforcement officers\n\nagainst arrestees. In doing all of this, the Majority has usurped the role of our\n\nGeneral Assembly in determining major policy decisions concerning the\n\n\n5\n    76 A.3d at 777.\n                                           4\n\fapportionment of tort liability. We have declined to engage in such \u201cacts of creation\u201d\n\nnot only in the torts arena, but also recently in other contexts,6 and we should do so\n\nhere. I address each point in turn.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       First, there is no basis to ignore the law of the case doctrine and reverse course\n\non Doe I and Doe II. \u201cThe law of the case doctrine, like the stare decisis doctrine,\n\nis founded on the principle of stability and respect for court processes and\n\nprecedent.\u201d7 We have noted that the doctrine is designed to bring \u201csome closure to\n\nmatters already decided in a given case by the highest court of a particular\n\njurisdiction, particularly when (with a different composition of jurists) that same\n\ncourt is considering matters in a later phase of the same litigation.\u201d8 Like stare\n\ndecisis, the law of the case doctrine is justified because \u201c[[e]xcessive] disturbance\n\nof prior rulings would be taken as evidence that justifiable reexamination of principle\n\nhad given way to drives for particular results in the short term.\u201d 9                       In SIGA\n\n\n6\n  See, e.g., DFC Glob.

In addition to Doe II\u2019s reaffirmation of Doe I\u2019s holding that the Motivation Prong is a jury\nquestion, we reinforced that same precedent in Hecksher v. Fairwinds Baptist Church, Inc., when\nwe relied on Doe I for the proposition that \u201c[t]he question of whether a tortfeasor is acting within\nthe scope of his employment is fact-specific, and, ordinarily, is one for the jury to decide.\u201d 115\nA.3d 1187, 1200 (Del. 2015) (quoting Doe I, 76 A.3d at 776); see also id. at 1203 n.62 (citing with\napproval our holding in Doe I that \u201cthe question of whether a police officer\u2019s rape committed while\nhe was arresting the victim was committed solely for personal reasons could not be resolved on a\nmotion for summary judgment.\u201d (citing Doe I, 76 A.3d 774)). Doe even acknowledges that, in\nthe out-of-state precedent she relies upon\u2014Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles, 814 P.2d 1341 (Cal.\n1991), and Doe v. Forrest, 853 A.2d 48 (Vt. 2004)\u2014the California Supreme Court and the\nVermont Supreme Court, respectively, held that the respondeat superior issue before them\npresented a question of fact. See, e.g., Mary M., 814 P.2d at 1347 (\u201c[T]he question of whether [the\nofficer] acted within his scope of employment was properly left for the jury to decide.\u201d).\n                                                 7\n\f       Here, the only changed circumstance is the composition of this Court. And\n\nthat alone is not enough to trigger the exception. The public should not have to\n\nworry that our case law will vacillate with every change in the makeup of the Court.\n\n       In relying on the \u201cunjust result\u201d exception, the Majority breathes new life into\n\narguments that Doe chose not to re-assert in this appeal. It rests the claimed\n\n\u201cinjustice\u201d on the false premise that \u201cour earlier failure to give more precise\n\nconsideration to the specific questions of law presented by this case left the Superior\n\nCourt and the parties without the ability to get a ruling on their dispute that took into\n\naccount the precise arguments they were making.\u201d20 There is no precedent that\n\nrequires this Court to address all arguments asserted by the parties. Setting such\n\nprecedent can potentially destabilize our law.21 Similarly, I am not aware of any\n\ninstance where the \u201cunjust result\u201d exception has been triggered on account of jury\n\ninstructions that, even if not ideally stated, all parties agree constitute accurate\n\nstatements of the law.22 Further, the \u201cunjust result\u201d exception is even more difficult\n\n\n\n\n20\n   Majority Op. at 5.\n21\n   Further, it can create inefficiencies by not allowing the Court to narrow holdings where\nappropriate and possible, and it would force the Court to rule on issues only tangentially presented\nto the Court by parties and without the benefit of a full presentation.\n22\n   The instruction given on course and scope of employment was consistent with Delaware law\nand supplemented the pattern jury instructions. See Corbitt v. Tatagari, 804 A.2d 1057, 1062 (Del.\n2002) (\u201c[J]ury instructions must give a correct statement of the substance of the law and must be\n\u2018reasonably informative and not misleading.\u2019\u201d (quoting Cabrera v. State, 747 A.2d 543, 544 (Del.\n2000))). It was also nearly identical to the language this Court used in Doe I when discussing\nSection 228.\n                                                 8\n\fto justify when its application involves, as here, overturning a jury verdict. This\n\nshould not be done lightly.23\n\n                                                II.\n\n       No doubt, the Majority\u2019s desire to clarify the requirements of the Motivation\n\nand Foreseeability prongs is based upon a sincere desire to be helpful to future\n\nlitigants. But if it were to limit its revisiting of the law of the case to the law as it\n\nexisted when the litigation was taking place, then summary judgment should have\n\nbeen granted in favor of the State\u2014not Doe. The Majority does not dispute this.24\n\n       This approach is consistent with the weight of authority. The highest courts\n\nof numerous states25 and many federal courts26 have found that such wrongful\n\n\n23\n   See Shapira v. Christiana Care Health Servs., Inc., 99 A.3d 217, 224 (Del. 2014) (\u201c\u2018Under\nDelaware law, enormous deference is given to jury verdicts,\u2019 and they should not be disturbed\nunless \u2018the evidence preponderates so heavily against the jury verdict that a reasonable jury could\nnot have reached the result.\u2019\u201d (quoting Young v.

Further, for the sound policy reasons\nundergirding the law of the case doctrine, this \u201cunjust result\u201d exception traditionally is, and must\nbe, construed narrowly. I was able to locate only a few instances where the \u201cunjust result\u201d\nexception has been applied: where prior rulings were \u201ctoo speculative,\u201d in Wilmington Med. Ctr.\nv. Coleman, 298 A.2d 320, 322 (Del. 1972); and where the State was insisting upon applying the\nlaw of the case despite having conceded that the law stated by the Court had been incorrect, in\nCobb v. State, 676 A.2d 901, 1996 WL 145793, at *1 (Del. 1996) (Table).

And all of those cases applying the Agency Relation Prong resist\n\ngoing as far as the Majority does here: they avoid imposing what amounts to strict\n\nliability on local and state law enforcement agencies for sexual assaults committed\n\nby their officers.31\n\n       As the Majority explains, Section 219(2) outlines certain situations where\n\nvicarious liability may be imposed on employers when an employee acts outside of\n\n\n\n28\n   Doe v. Forrest, 853 A.2d 48, 57 (Vt. 2004). But even there, the Vermont Supreme Court held\nas a matter of law that, under the Section 228 test, the officer could not have been motivated at\nleast in part by a desire to serve his employer. Id. at 55 (\u201cAlthough Forrest\u2019s misconduct occurred\nwhile ostensibly on duty, we cannot conclude that coercing plaintiff to perform fellatio was\nconduct that was actuated, even in part, by a purpose to serve the county sheriff.

It then adopted Section 219(2)(d) for the first time. Id.\n29\n   Also, the court in Mary M., though not applying Section 219(2)(d), imposed liability for policy\nreasons. See 814 P.2d at 1349 (\u201c[E]ach of the three policy reasons supports the imposition of\nvicarious liability on the employer of a police officer who, while on duty, commits a sexual assault\nby misusing his official authority.\u201d).\n30\n   See, e.g., Hardwicke v. Am. Boychoir Sch., 902 A.2d 900, 920 (N.J. 2006) (\u201cThe [Child Sexual\nAbuse Act] imposes responsibility on those in the best position to know of the [child] abuse and\nstop it; application of section 219 of the Restatement to plaintiff\u2019s common-law claims advances\nthose goals.\u201d).\n31\n   See Doe v. Sipper, 821 F. Supp. 2d 384, 392-93 (D.D.C. 2011) (denying company\u2019s motion to\ndismiss in order to allow the case to proceed to discovery on whether the company\u2019s Chief\nOperating Officer relied on his agency relation with another employee when raping her in his hotel\nroom on a business trip).\n                                                11\n\fthe scope of employment. As set forth in subsection (d), vicarious liability may be\n\nimposed for such torts outside the scope of employment if the servant \u201cpurported to\n\nact or speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance upon apparent\n\nauthority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of agency\n\nrelation.\u201d The Majority relies on the second clause, the Agency Relation Prong, to\n\nimpose liability on the State as a matter of law.\n\n          Courts have tread cautiously when asked to apply this Agency Relation Prong,\n\nand for good reason: applying it strictly according to the plain meaning of its terms\n\nwould expose an employer to virtually unbounded liability. In fact, if not properly\n\ncircumscribed, its application runs the risk of \u201cswallowing agency law\u2019s general\n\nscope of employment rule\u201d in Section 228, in making the exception greater than the\n\nrule.32     As the United States Supreme Court has observed, \u201cmost workplace\n\n\n32\n   Daniel M. Combs, Case Note, Costos v. Coconut Island Corp.: Creating a Vicarious Liability\nCatchall Under the Aided-by-Agency-Relation Theory, 73 U. Colo. L. Rev. 1099, 1105 (2002).\nThe comments to the Restatement and the transcripts of the drafting committee meetings suggest\nthat the drafters were concerned about the potential for broad application of the Agency Relation\nProng and attempted to limit its reach, even though the drafting committee never addressed these\nconcerns through adjustments in the actual black letter text of the Restatement. Comment e\nprovides a non-exhaustive list of two examples of situations that fit within the Agency Relation\nProng, and they both involve deceit. The two examples in Comment e are also clear illustrations\nof situations that other provisions within the Restatement state already provide a basis for\nrespondeat superior liability. Comment e\u2019s first example of a situation engendering liability under\nthe Agency Relation Prong states that a master may be liable where his agent, a telegraph operator,\n\u201csends false messages purporting to come from third persons.\u201d Restatement, supra note 2, \u00a7 219\ncmt. e (citing \u00a7 261). Indeed, another provision in the Restatement, Section, 261 provides a basis\nfor liability in such circumstances: \u201c[a] principal who puts a servant or other agent in a position\nwhich enables the agent, while apparently acting within his authority, to commit a fraud upon third\npersons is subject to liability to such third persons for the fraud.\u201d Id. \u00a7 261. The second example\nis where \u201c[t]he manager of a store operated by him for an undisclosed principal is enabled to cheat\n                                               12\n\ftortfeasors are aided in accomplishing their tortious objective by the existence of the\n\nagency relation.\u201d33\n\n       When the United States Supreme Court addressed the applicability of Section\n\n219(2)(d) (and its Agency Relation Prong) in a pair of decisions in 1998, in\n\nBurlington Industries Inc. v.

Again, Section 222 provides a basis for\nliability in such circumstances as it states that \u201c[a]n undisclosed principal is subject to liability to\nthird persons for conduct within the scope of employment of servants and of subservants employed\nfor him by a servant or other agent empowered to employ them.\u201d Id. \u00a7 222.

In other words, the infraction could be described as\n\n\u201cmisuse of delegated authority.\u201d42 In contrast, here, the State did not give the Officer\n\nany such decision-making authority.

Forrest,45 the Vermont Supreme Court acknowledged that its decision\n\nwas guided by its own policy judgments for why the state should be held responsible\n\nfor the acts of an officer outside the scope of his employment. The court deemed it\n\nproper to impose liability on the state because the state grants police officers\n\n\u201cextraordinary power\u201d and, as such, when an officer is the wrongdoer, his or her\n\nvictim is \u201cstripped of the official protection that society provides\u201d and rendered\n\n\u201cparticularly vulnerable and defenseless.\u201d46 And the court believed that it was\n\n\n\n44\n   See Forrest, 853 A.2d at 57. In the pre-Ellerth and Faragher era, the California Supreme Court\nheld in Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles that respondeat superior liability may be imposed on the\nstate when \u201ca police officer on duty misuses his official authority by raping a woman whom he\nhas detained.\u201d 814 P.2d at 1352. But, unlike the near strict liability imposed by the Majority\u2019s\nopinion here, that court also held that the question of whether the officer misused official authority\nin committing the rape is \u201ca question of fact for the jury\u201d and noted that, \u201c[i]n this case, plaintiff\npresented evidence that would support the conclusion that the rape arose from misuse of official\nauthority.\u201d Id. That court did not rely on Section 219(2)(d). In the years since, at least three\njustices of the California Supreme Court have noted that they believe Mary M. was \u201cwrongly\ndecided\u201d and would overrule its imposition of vicarious liability on the state. See Farmers Ins.\nGrp. v. Cty. of Santa Clara, 906 P.2d 440, 459 (Cal. 1995) (Baxter, J., concurring) (\u201c[W]hile I\nagree with Justice George that Mary M. was wrongly decided and should be overruled, I do not\nbelieve this case presents the proper vehicle because the facts here are amply distinguishable.\u201d);\nid.

No doubt, our courts will be faced with requests to apply Section\n\n219(2)(d) to a host of other situations.49\n\n       Further, the Majority, in focusing on its own assessment of how risks and costs\n\nought to be allocated from a public policy standpoint, gives short shrift to Delaware\u2019s\n\nlong-standing history of limiting rights of recovery against the State.50 Our General\n\nAssembly has reflected this limitation of rights of recovery in the State Tort Claims\n\nAct.51 Similarly, the County and Municipal Tort Claims Act provides that, \u201c[e]xcept\n\nas otherwise expressly provided by statute, all governmental entities and their\n\n\n\n47\n   Id. at 62-63.\n48\n   Id. at 68.\n49\n   After Forrest, the Vermont Supreme Court entertained entreaties to extend its applicability to a\nrange of other scenarios. For example, in Doe v. Newbury Bible Church, 933 A.2d 196 (Vt. 2007),\nanswering a certified question from the Second Circuit, the Vermont Supreme Court determined\nthat, under Vermont law, Section 219(2)(d) does not apply to \u201csituation[s] involving tortious acts\nby a pastor.\u201d Id. at 198.\n50\n   See Majority Op. at 72-73.\n51\n   10 Del.

Among them are questions pertaining to\n\nhow the risks and costs of such deviant conduct should be allocated. But, instead of\n\nallowing citizens (i.e., taxpayers) and their representatives in the General Assembly\n\nto weigh in after debate\u2014and instead of respecting the General Assembly\u2019s\n\npolicymaking function\u2014the Majority\u2019s holding effects a change in the law based\n\nentirely on its view of what the \u201cproper\u201d public policy should be and who should\n\nbear the risks (and costs) of wrongful conduct by a law enforcement officer.53 And\n\nthe Majority does so without any evidentiary showing that the public will benefit by\n\n\n\n\n52\n   10 Del.

As the dissenting justice in Doe v. Forrest\nrightfully questioned, \u201cwhy is it fair or reasonable to burden the public with liability for a sexual\nassault perpetrated by a rogue employee solely for his own twisted personal gratification?\u201d 853\nA.2d at 74 (Skoglund, J., dissenting). The question of why the State (public) should bear the cost\nis a legitimate inquiry, particularly where there is no suggestion that the law enforcement agency\nwas negligent in hiring, training, or supervising the officer. Here, all agree that the Officer\u2019s\nconduct was based upon his own selfish desire for sexual gratification at the expense of his\ndetained suspect\u2014rather than on advancing any interest of the State.\n55\n   Majority Op. at 73.\n56\n   See Delaware Solid Waste Auth. v.

Indiana\u2019s history of extending non-delegable duties began\n\nwith the Indiana Supreme Court\u2019s opinion Stropes v. Heritage House Children\u2019s\n\nCenter of Shelbyville, Inc.,73 which held that a residential children\u2019s center held a\n\nnon-delegable duty to its mentally disabled resident,74 though it remanded the case\n\nfor determination of whether the center\u2019s protection \u201cfell short of the extraordinary\n\nstandard of care which is imposed by the common carrier exception and which it\n\nassumed when it accepted [plaintiff] as a resident.\u201d75 In Robins v.

Here is why: the consequences could prove devastating for our\n\nmost vulnerable citizens, as aptly observed by our sister courts who have declined\n\nto go this route. Facilities that care for our most vulnerable citizens might react in\n\nways unanticipated by the Majority. For example, fearing the risk of liability and\n\nsaddled with greater insurance costs, they might avoid taking on the most severely\n\ndisabled\u2014or may not be able to afford to do so.\n\n       In Davis v. Devereux Foundation,78 the New Jersey Supreme Court held that\n\na charitable organization serving the developmentally disabled did not owe a non-\n\ndelegable duty to a resident burned by boiling water that a counselor had poured on\n\nhim. That court was motivated by similar concerns. It commented that, \u201c[t]he\n\nimposition of liability upon these organizations for unforeseeable intentional acts of\n\nemployees such as [the defendant employee] could jeopardize their continued\n\nexistence, deter the founding of new providers that could deliver quality services,\n\nand increase the cost incurred by residents, families and the State in maintaining\n\nresidents in institutional care.\u201d79 The employee was criminally charged, convicted,\n\nand incarcerated for her assault on the resident.80\n\n\n\n\n78\n   37 A.3d 469 (N.J. 2012).\n79\n   Id. at 487.\n80\n   Id. at 474. See also id. at 485 (\u201c[A]s this case illustrates, the criminal justice system has a role\nin deterring and punishing conduct such as [the employee\u2019s].\u201d).\n                                                 24\n\f       Similarly, in Niece v. Elmview Group Home,81 the Supreme Court of\n\nWashington declined to hold a group home liable under this non-delegable-duty\n\ntheory after an employee sexually assaulted a resident. That court echoed the same\n\nconcerns, noting that \u201c[t]he financial burden created by such strict liability might\n\nactually reduce the residential care industry\u2019s ability to provide quality care.\u201d82\n\nWashington\u2019s high court asked questions such as, \u201cWould insurance against such\n\nliability be affordable or even available? Would the operators of group homes\n\nsimply pass the cost of such liability on to the families of residents or to the State\n\ntreasury?    Or would commercial providers of residential care shy away from\n\naccepting responsibility for the most vulnerable disabled persons, those most in need\n\nof residential care?\u201d83 But the court conceded its inability to answer them and\n\nsubmitted \u201c[i]t is particularly important to recognize the limits on our ability as an\n\nappellate court to decide complex questions of public policy where, as here, a\n\ndecision to impose a new tort liability requires a consideration of factual matters\n\nextrinsic to the case before the court.\u201d84 That court also noted that \u201c[t]he legislature\n\nis uniquely able to hold hearings, gather crucial information, and learn the full extent\n\nof competing societal interests.\u201d85\n\n\n\n81\n   929 P.2d 420 (Wash. 1997).\n82\n   Id. at 431.\n83\n   Id.\n84\n   Id.\n85\n   Id.

The Majority\u2019s decision now\n\nholds the State liable for the intentional sexual misconduct committed by a member\n\nof law enforcement acting entirely outside the normal scope of his work duties. It\n\ndoes so after reversing our own precedent in this very case and applying two sections\n\nof the Restatement never before embraced in this State. It also is unclear whether\n\nthe holding applies only to law enforcement agencies, or whether every public (and\n\nprivate) employer will now be faced with lawsuits seeking to extend this ruling even\n\nbeyond the law enforcement arena. Schools, daycares, nursing homes, and facilities\n\nfor our State\u2019s most vulnerable citizens, and an untold number of other employers\n\n(including government agencies) might be held liable in money damages for the\n\nintentional torts committed by rogue employees with a purpose wholly divorced\n\nfrom the interest of the employee\u2019s employer.86\n\n\n\n\n86\n   Although we have recognized that, in certain instances, even the intentional unauthorized torts\nof an employee can be viewed as advancing the employer\u2019s interests, see Draper v. Olivere Paving\n& Const. Co., 181 A.2d 565, 569-72 (Del. 1962), this Court has never held that an employer may\nbe vicariously liable for a sexual assault committed by an employee.\n                                               26\n\f       Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

As set forth herein, my path and reasoning in reaching that endpoint differ from his to some\nextent. But I agree with his view that this Court should decline to apply Section 219(2)(d) as well\nas Section 219(2)(c) in this case.\n                                                27\n\fVAUGHN, Justice, dissenting; joined in part\uf02a by VALIHURA, Justice:\n\n       I cannot join the majority opinion because I do not agree with the majority\u2019s\n\ndecisions on the foreseeability element of \u00a7 228 of the Restatement (Second) of\n\nAgency (\u201cthe Restatement\u201d), the issue of consent, or the applicability of \u00a7 219 of the\n\nRestatement. I would affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. Since I would\n\naffirm the judgment of the Superior Court, I will begin by discussing the five\n\narguments that Doe makes in her opening brief, in order.\n\n       The first argument Doe makes is that the trial court committed error in its\n\nscope of employment instruction. The instruction is set forth in full in the majority\u2019s\n\nopinion. Specifically, Doe argues \u201c[t]he Instruction was erroneous because it failed\n\nto make clear that what had to be within the course and scope was [the police\n\nofficer\u2019s] general activity and not specific wrongful activity occurring within that\n\ngeneral activity.\u201d1 This argument relates to the element of \u00a7 228 requiring that the\n\nwrongdoer\u2019s conduct be \u201cactuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the\n\nmaster[.]\u201d2 Doe argues that this element of \u00a7 228 is satisfied, or could be found by\n\na jury to be satisfied, because the officer was processing an arrest in the general\n\ncourse of his police duties when the tortious conduct occurred. She argues that the\n\njury instruction should have more clearly informed the jury that it could find that the\n\n\n\uf02a Justice Valihura joins in part, as reflected in footnote 87 of her dissenting opinion.\n1\n  Doe\u2019s Opening Br. 15.\n2\n  Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 228(1)(c) (1958).\n\fofficer was acting within the scope of employment if he was carrying out police\n\nduties when the wrongful conduct occurred and need not find that the wrongful\n\nconduct itself was motivated by a desire to serve the employer.\n\n         The majority discusses this \u201cmotivation prong\u201d of \u00a7 228 in detail and I need\n\nnot do so here. I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that it makes sense, in the\n\ninterest of justice, to depart from the law of the case on this issue in order to clarify\n\nthe meaning of \u00a7 228\u2019s motivation prong. I also agree that the prong \u201crequires that\n\nthe wrongful act must itself be motivated in part by a desire to serve the employer.\u201d3\n\nAnd I agree with the majority that the officer\u2019s conduct was not motivated in any\n\nsense by a desire to serve the state police. It follows that Doe\u2019s first argument, in\n\nretrospect, must fail because she was not entitled to an instruction that the motivation\n\nelement was satisfied if the officer was acting within the scope of general police\n\nactivity at the time the wrongful activity occurred.\n\n         Doe next argues that the trial court erred by refusing to give a foreseeability\n\ninstruction which she offered at trial and which the parties refer to as the \u201cMacLeish\n\nInstruction.\u201d The MacLeish instruction was entitled \u201cKNOWLEDGE OF COL.\n\nMACLEISH\u201d and read as follows:\n\n         In this case, Colonel MacLeish, the former head of the Delaware State\n         Police in 2009, testified. If you find that Colonel MacLeish was aware\n         of a general problem within law enforcement that some police officers\n         had sexually assaulted people in their custody then it was not\n\n3\n    See supra p. 5\u20136.\n                                            2\n\f       completely unforeseeable to the State that such wrongful conduct could\n       occur.\n\n       The general problem of sexual abuse by arresting police officers does\n       not have to have involved the State Police or any police in Delaware-it\n       is enough if on a nationwide basis there was a general problem. Also,\n       the problem did not have to involve a majority of police officers, it is\n       enough if it were a very small number of officers.4\n\n       The trial court rejected the MacLeish Instruction and gave the following a\n\npattern instruction on foreseeability:\n\n       A foreseeable act is one that an ordinary person, under the\n       circumstances, would recognize or anticipate as creating a risk of\n       injury. It is not necessary that the particular injury suffered was itself\n       foreseeable, but only that the risk of injury existed.5\n\n       The request for the MacLeish Instruction was based upon the testimony at trial\n\nof former Delaware State Police Colonel Thomas F. MacLeish, which included the\n\nfollowing:\n\n       Q. And would you agree with me that it is known in your business, at\n       least as it existed when you retired back in 2009, is known, or was\n       known in your business that a small, very small, but small percentage\n       of police officers occasionally engage in sexual misconduct during the\n       course of an arrest?\n       A. Yes. It is an extremely small percentage. Yes, it is.\n       Q. It hurts to have to admit that, doesn\u2019t it?\n       A. It is true in any occupation out there and law enforcement, you are\n       given the power and the authority and responsibility to take care of\n       others. And you do not ever cross that line. . . . To ask me if there is\n       anyone out there that has, yes, there has been a very, very small\n       minority.6\n\n4\n  App. to Opening Br. at A0349.\n5\n  Id. at A0474.\n6\n  Id. at A0378\u201379.\n                                           3\n\f       It is well known that a party does not have a right to have a particular\n\ninstruction in particular language as long as the instruction given is a correct\n\nstatement of law.7\n\n       It is unusual to have an instruction which is tailored to a particular witness\u2019\n\ntestimony, as is the MacLeish Instruction. It refers to a \u201cgeneral problem\u201d within\n\nlaw enforcement that some police officers commit sexual assaults, but Col.\n\nMacLeish\u2019s testimony did not speak of a \u201cgeneral problem.\u201d It states that if the jury\n\nfound that there was such a general problem, \u201cthen it was not completely\n\nunforeseeable to the State that such wrongful conduct could occur.\u201d8 The issue\n\nhowever, is foreseeability, or expectability, not whether conduct was \u201cnot\n\ncompletely unforeseeable.\u201d The instruction seems to be one asking the trial court to\n\ncomment upon Col. MacLeish\u2019s testimony, and it seems designed to steer the jury\n\nin the direction of finding foreseeability. It is not a balanced instruction which\n\nsimply informs the jury of the law. I see no error in the trial court\u2019s refusing to give\n\nthe MacLeish Instruction and instead giving the pattern instruction. The standard\n\ninstruction gave both sides full latitude to make their arguments on foreseeability.\n\n         I turn now to the majority opinion on the foreseeability element of \u00a7 228.9\n\nThe majority states that \u201c[t]he reality is that there is no question of fact in this case\n\n\n7\n  Chavin v. Cope, 243 A.2d 694, 698 (Del. 1968).\n8\n  App. to Opening Br. at A0349.\n9\n  Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 228(1)(d) (1958).\n                                             4\n\fthat the Foreseeability Prong was satisfied.\u201d10 Relying in part upon alleged wrongful\n\nacts by state troopers that are included in a motion for partial summary judgment\n\nfiled in the Superior Court but which apparently were not introduced at trial, and in\n\npart upon news and secondary sources which don\u2019t seem to have much in particular\n\nto do with Delaware and are not in evidence, the majority finds that foreseeability is\n\nestablished as a matter of law in any case where a police officer sexually assaults a\n\ndetainee in the officer\u2019s custody. I disagree with this conclusion for two reasons.\n\n          The first is that I think the doctrine of law of the case should bar\n\nreconsideration of this issue. In Doe II we recognized that Col. MacLeish had\n\ntestified by deposition that there is a risk that some police officers will engage in\n\nsexual assault, but we held that the foreseeability factor was a question for the jury.11\n\nWhile I have agreed with the majority that the law of the case doctrine should give\n\nway on the motivation prong, I do not think that the interests of justice call for\n\nreconsideration of our ruling in Doe II on the foreseeability element of \u00a7 228.\n\n          Second, I think that a question of fact exists with regard to foreseeability and\n\nthat the issue was properly submitted to the jury. The trial court put it this way in\n\nan order denying Doe\u2019s motion for a new trial:\n\n          Finally, Plaintiff argues there was overwhelming evidence on the issue\n          of foreseeability to warrant a new trial. This Court disagrees. The only\n          evidence presented regarding the foreseeability of sexual assault of\n\n10\n     See supra p. 47.\n11\n     Sherman v. State, 133 A.3d 971, 979 (Del. 2016).\n                                                 5\n\f       arrestees by on-duty officers came from Colonel MacLeish\u2019s testimony\n       that, as of 2009 when he retired from the Delaware State Police, an\n       \u201cextremely small percentage\u201d of officers engaged in sexual\n       misconduct during an arrest. However, two of [the officer\u2019s]\n       supervisors testified that they were unaware of any allegations of sexual\n       misconduct against him prior to the incident in question, and therefore,\n       the jury was free to consider all of the testimony from the various law\n       enforcement representatives on the issue of foreseeability.12\n\n       I agree with the trial court. Doe was not required to show that there was prior\n\nevidence of sexual misconduct on the part of the officer. The evidence that an\n\nextremely small percentage of officers engaged in sexual misconduct was enough to\n\nget her to the jury. But I think that all of the evidence referred to by the trial court,\n\nboth the general evidence solicited from Col. MacLeish and the specific evidence\n\nsolicited from the officer\u2019s supervisors, was admissible for the jury\u2019s consideration.\n\nAnd I think it was within the province of the jury to decide whether the evidence\n\nsubmitted was sufficient to rise to the level of establishing foreseeability.13\n\n        The third argument Doe makes in her opening brief is that unforseeability\n\nwas an affirmative defense that had to be proven by the State. At trial, Doe tendered\n\na proposed jury instruction entitled \u201cCOMPLETE UNFORESEEABILITY AS AN\n\nAFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE,\u201d which the trial court refused to give.14\n\n\n\n12\n   Sherman v. State, 2017 WL 19900268, at *3 (Del. Super. May 8, 2017) (emphasis added).\n13\n   Marston v. Minneapolis Clinic of Psychiatry and Neurology, LTD., 329 N.W.2d 306, 311 (Minn.\n1982) (rejecting a plaintiff\u2019s claim that foreseeability was established as a matter of law where\nthere was testimony that \"sexual relations between a psychologist and a patient is a well-known\nhazard\" thus holding that foreseeability was a question of fact.).\n14\n   App. to Opening Br. at A0345.\n                                               6\n\f       In support of her third argument, Doe relies upon the cases of Doe I15 and\n\nDraper v. Olivere.16 The facts of Draper are mentioned in the majority opinion and\n\nneed not be repeated here. These cases involved motions for summary judgment\n\nfiled by defendants. They discuss the burden on a moving party in that context.\n\nThey have no bearing on the burden of proof at trial. The normal burden of proof\n\nwas on Doe, as plaintiff, to prove each element of her claim by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence, including the element of foreseeability under \u00a7 228(1)(d).17 There was\n\nno error on the part of the trial court in refusing to give the instruction tendered by\n\nDoe.\n\n       Doe next argues that the State made an improper statement in closing\n\nargument. The portion of the argument complained of is as follows:\n\n       [Defense counsel]: One of the elements as the Judge will instruct you\n       is whether or not this was unexpected or foreseeable. We submit to you\n       it was not foreseeable. You heard the testimony from Mr. MacLeish\n       about the number of arrests that the State Police make in a course of a\n       year, I think 100,000. The State Police have been around for a\n       longtime, 1920s. Have you heard any other incidents like this being\n       admitted through the course of this trial? None. None. Is this\n       foreseeable that this going to happen this one time?18\n\n\n\n\n15\n   76 A.3d 774 (Del. 2013).\n16\n   181 A.2d 565 (Del. 1962).\n17\n   Reybold Group, Inc. v. Chemprobe Technologies, Inc., 721 A.2d 1267, 1269\u201370 (Del. 1998)\n(citation omitted).\n18\n   App. to Opening Br. at A0463.\n                                            7\n\f           Plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected, the basis for his objection being that \u201c[t]his is\n\nfinessing the record. There was no testimony from Col. MacLeish about whether\n\nthere had been any other sexual events, [the] record is barren on that.\u201d19 The court\n\noverruled the objection and argument resumed.\n\n           Plaintiff\u2019s counsel argues that this portion of the State\u2019s argument went\n\noutside the record because Col. MacLeish did not testify as to the number of sexual\n\nmisconduct complaints against state troopers over the force\u2019s history. However, it\n\nappears that counsel\u2019s argument was a correct summary and assessment of the\n\nevidence. Apparently, no specific instance of prior police sexual misconduct was\n\nintroduced at trial. A party is entitled to argue that the opponent has failed to support\n\nan element of her claim. I see no error in the trial court\u2019s overruling the objection.\n\n           Doe\u2019s fifth and final argument in her opening brief involves the issue of\n\nconsent. In the trial court, and on appeal, Doe argues that she should not have been\n\nrequired to prove that she did not consent to the sexual contact as part of her assault\n\nand battery claim. The trial court rejected her arguments, and instructed the jury that\n\nan element of her assault and battery claim was lack of consent on her part.\n\n           Doe contends that under principles of judicial admission and judicial estoppel,\n\nthe State should not have been permitted to argue that she consented to the sex act\n\nwith the officer. This argument is based on the fact that the State charged the officer\n\n\n19\n     Id.\n                                              8\n\fwith sexual extortion, soliciting a sexual bribe, and official misconduct as a result of\n\nthe incident.\n\n          Judicial admissions are never conclusive and raise an estoppel only in the case\n\nin which they are made.20 As to judicial estoppel, the charges of soliciting a sexual\n\nbribe and official misconduct do not implicate assault or a lack of consent on the\n\npart of the victim. Sexual extortion alleges in the alternative that a person compelled\n\nor induced another to engage in a sexual act. It does not by express terms charge\n\nthat the sex occurred without the consent of the victim. The State did not charge\n\nrape or any other sexual offense in which an element is that the sexual contact\n\noccurred without the consent of the victim. Nor does the probable cause affidavit\n\nsupporting the offenses allege that the sexual contact occurred without Doe\u2019s\n\nconsent. \u201cJudicial estoppel is an extreme remedy, to be used only \u2018when [a party\u2019s]\n\ninconsistent positions are \u2018tantamount to a knowing misrepresentation to or even\n\nfraud on the court.\u2019\u2019\u201c21 I do not think that standard is established here and I see no\n\nerror on the part of the trial court in rejecting Doe\u2019s arguments on judicial admission\n\nand judicial estoppel.\n\n          Doe\u2019s more significant argument is that she could not consent to the sexual\n\ncontact as a matter of law because she was in custody. She relies upon a Federal\n\n\n\n20\n     Rudnick v. Schoenberg, 122 A. 902, 903 (Del. 1923).\n21\n     Chao v. Roy\u2019s Const., Inc., 517 F.3d 180, 186 n. 5 (3d Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).\n                                                   9\n\fDistrict Court opinion, Carrigan v. Davis,22 and 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1259. The statute\n\nmakes it a crime for people working at a detention facility to have sexual intercourse\n\nor sexual penetration with an inmate.23 Carrigan involved such a case and was\n\ninfluenced by the statute.         Neither the statute nor Carrigan have any direct\n\napplication to this case. There is no comparable statute governing police detentions\n\noutside of a prison facility.         I think Carrigan and the statute were properly\n\ndistinguished by the trial court.\n\n       In this case, whether Doe consented to sex was properly determined by the\n\ntrial court to be a question of fact. After initially denying the sexual contact\n\noccurred, the officer admitted it occurred but said that it was consensual. Despite\n\nthe obvious credibility problem with his second story, the officer\u2019s statement was\n\nsufficient to create a question of fact for the jury.\n\n       I do not join in the majority\u2019s determination that sexual contact between an\n\nofficer and a person in his custody is always without consent of the detainee as a\n\nmatter of law, because I think it crosses the line between the proper role of the court\n\nand the jury.24\n\n\n\n\n22\n   70 F. Supp. 2d 448 (D. Del. 1999).\n23\n   11 Del. C. \u00a7 1259.\n24\n   The majority\u2019s research shows that some states have passed statutes prohibiting sexual contact\nbetween a police officer and a detainee in his custody. That research apparently does not reveal\nany judicial decision in which a court has held that a detainee in police custody cannot consent as\na matter of law.\n                                                10\n\f       When Article IV, \u00a7 19 of the Delaware Constitution was being considered at\n\nthe 1897 Constitutional Convention, delegate William C. Spruance (later Judge\n\nSpruance) stated that the object of the section is \u201cthat Judges shall confine\n\nthemselves to their business, which is to adjudge the law and leave juries to\n\ndetermine the facts.\u201d25 As judges we have heard over and over again that the\n\n\u201c[m]embers of the jury. . . . are the sole and exclusive judges of the facts of the\n\ncase.\u201d26 I doubt the jury decided this case on the issue of consent. I think it far more\n\nlikely that it decided it upon the issue of scope of employment. But I think the State\n\nis entitled to have the issue decided by a jury, not the court.\n\n       Finally, I address \u00a7 219 of the Restatement, beginning with \u00a7 219(2)(c).27 The\n\nnon-delegable duty exception to the general rule that employers are liable only for\n\nacts of employees committed within the scope of employment has generally been\n\napplied to common carriers and innkeepers.28 One of the justifications for imposing\n\na non-delegable duty upon common carriers and innkeepers is contractual.29 The\n\n\n\n25\n   Storey v. Camper, 401 A.2d 458, 463 n.4 (Del. 1979) (quoting II Debates and Proceedings of\nthe Constitutional Convention of the State of Delaware, p. 1730). Art IV, \u00a7 19 provides that\n\u201c[j]udges shall not charge juries with respect to matters of fact, but may state the questions of fact\nin issue and declare the law.\u201d\n26\n   Guthridge v. Pen-Mod, Inc., 239 A.2d 709, 711 (Del. Super. 1967).\n27\n   Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219 (1958).\n28\n   See supra p. 59\u201360 n. 151.\n29\n   \"[T]he master may be under such a duty to the plaintiff that responsibility for the servant\u2019s acts\nmay not be delegated to him. This is true in particular in those cases where the master, by contract\nor otherwise, has entered into some relation requiring him to be responsible for the protection of\nthe plaintiff.\" Rabon v. Guardsmark, Inc., 571 F.2d 1277, 1280 n.4 (4th Cir. 1978) (quoting W.\nProsser, Law of Torts s 70, p. 465 (1971).\n                                                 11\n\fcontract between the carrier and passenger, or innkeeper and guest, includes an\n\nimplied assurance that the passenger or guest will transported or cared for safely,\n\nincluding the assurance that the passenger or guest will not be subjected to\n\nintentional torts of the carrier\u2019s or innkeeper\u2019s employees.30 No such contractual\n\nrelationship exists between the State and a detainee.\n\n       While courts in Indiana have expanded the non-delegable duty exception,\n\ncourts in other jurisdictions have refused to do so. In Davis v. Devereux, the\n\nSupreme Court of New Jersey declined to impose a non-delegable duty upon a\n\nresidential facility where an employee had committed an intentional tort against a\n\nresident who had severe autism and developmental disabilities.31 While Davis\n\ninvolved a residential facility, not a police department, the resident there was as\n\ndependent upon the facility for his care, safety, and protection as is a detainee in\n\npolice custody. Davis discusses other cases which have declined to expand the non-\n\ndelegable duty exception. It notes that in Niece v. Elmview Group Home, the\n\nSupreme Court of Washington declined to impose a non-delegable duty in a case\n\ninvolving a group home for developmentally disabled persons.32 In Regions Bank\n\n& Trust v. Stone County Skilled Nursing Facility, Inc., which involved a sexual\n\nassault by a nursing assistant upon a semi-comatose, quadriplegic patient, the\n\n\n30\n   Lainer v.

I\n\nagree with Davis and the cases it discusses that \u201cestablished tort law appropriately\n\nbalance[s] the parties\u2019 interests.\u201d34\n\n         I would also decline to adopt the last clause of \u00a7 219(2)(d) as part of the\n\ncommon law of this state. In Zsigo v. Hurley Medical Center, the Supreme Court of\n\nMichigan rejected a contention that it should recognize \u00a7 219(2)(d).35 In doing so,\n\nit noted the potential breadth of \u00a7 219(2)(d). \u201cBecause the exception is not tied to\n\nthe scope of employment but, rather, to the existence of the employment relation\n\nitself, the exception strays too far from the rule of respondeat superior employer\n\nnonliability.\u201d36 The court also rejected the dissent\u2019s assertion that the court had \u201cthe\n\noption of applying the exception in the same tailored manner as demonstrated by the\n\nVermont Supreme Court in Doe v. Forrest.\u201d37 The court recognized the \u201cdanger of\n\nadopting an exception that essentially has no parameters and can be applied too\n\nbroadly.\u201d38 I agree with the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Michigan.\n\n        For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.39\n\n\n\n33\n   49 S.W.3d 107 (2001).\n34\n   Davis, 37 A.3d at 488.\n35\n   716 N.W.2d 220, 226 (Mich. 2006).\n36\n   Id.\n37\n   Id. at 227.\n38\n   Id. at 229.\n39\n   I join in parts II, III, IV and V of Justice Valihura\u2019s dissent.\n                                                   13\n\f",
