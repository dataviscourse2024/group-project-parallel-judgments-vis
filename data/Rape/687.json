The Affidavit\n\nof Probable Cause alleged that he was convicted in November 1994 for a July\n\n1994 Indecent Assault and was convicted in October 1996 for a June 1994\n\nInvoluntary Deviate Sexual Intercourse (IDSI). When he was released from\n\nprison in December 2017, he was required to register as a lifetime sexual\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1  On October 24, 1995, the first sex offender registration law known as\nMegan\u2019s Law, was enacted, and in 1999, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania\ndeemed substantial portions of it to be unconstitutional.                  See\nCommonwealth v. Williams, 733 A.2d 593 (Pa. 1999). Megan\u2019s Law II was\neffective on July 10, 2000. After making amendments to Megan\u2019s Law, SORNA\nI became effective on December 20, 2012, and applied to convicted sex\noffenders already required to register and where prior sex offender\nregistration requirements had expired. In Commonwealth v. Muniz, 164\nA.3d 1189, 1193 (Pa. 2017), the Court found SORNA I was an unconstitutional\nviolation of offenders\u2019 ex post facto rights. On February 21, 2018, the General\nAssembly passed Act 10 of SORNA to address Muniz. Act 10 split SORNA into\ntwo parts: revised Subchapter H, which applied to crimes committed on or\nafter December 20, 2012; and Subchapter I, which applied to those crimes\ncommitted before December 20, 2012. On June 12, 2018, the General\nAssembly passed Act 29, re-enacting and amending SORNA (SORNA II) and\nit was immediately effective.\n\n2Sexual Offender Notification and Registration Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9799.51-\n9799.75.\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\noffender due to his multiple convictions of sexually violent offenses under\n\nSubchapter I of Sorna II. (See Police Criminal Complaint Affidavit of Probable\n\nCause, 8/10/18).\n\n        On October 25, 2018, the Commonwealth filed an information formally\n\ncharging Krout with Failure to Verify Address/Be Photographed and Failure to\n\nRegister3 to which he pled guilty on November 17, 2020. Before the plea was\n\naccepted, he completed a written colloquy in which he verified, in pertinent\n\npart, that he committed the crime and was not coerced into entering a guilty\n\nplea. (See Guilty Plea Colloquy, 11/17/20, at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 26, 36). At the guilty\n\nplea hearing, he confirmed that he failed \u201cto verify [his] address and/or be\n\nphotographed      by    authorities,\u201d    as    required.   (Guilty   Plea/Sentencing,\n\n11/17/20, at 6). When asked if he knew he was supposed to verify his address\n\nwith authorities, he responded in the affirmative and admitted that \u201cRockview,\n\nwhen they released me, they told me to go to the courthouse and register, do\n\nwhatever, and I goofed up. \u2026 I got no problem with admitting that.\u201d (Id. at\n\n6-7). Krout was sentenced to not less than 40 nor more than 80 months\u2019\n\nincarceration. He did not file post-sentence motions or an appeal.\n\n        On March 23, 2021, Krout filed a PCRA petition pro se.             Appointed\n\ncounsel filed an amended petition on May 20, 2021. The amended petition\n\ncontended ineffectiveness of counsel in failing to raise the SORNA II\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3   18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4915.2(a)(2), (3).\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\nchallenges by allowing Krout to plead guilty because he had no duty to register\n\nbecause, at the time he committed the crimes, there was no registration\n\nrequirement, as well as failing to challenge the constitutionality of Subsection\n\nI of Act 29 of SORNA II, which created an irrebuttable presumption of future\n\ndangerousness.\n\n       The PCRA court filed notice of its intent to dismiss the petition without\n\na hearing on October 13, 2021. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 907(1). The petition was\n\nformally denied on November 5, 2021, and Krout timely appealed. He filed a\n\nconcise statement of errors complained of on appeal pursuant to the court\u2019s\n\norder in which he raised the same three issues he claimed in his PCRA petition.\n\nSee Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b).\n\n       On appeal, Krout again argues that the trial court erred in dismissing\n\nhis petition because, although he admitted that he failed to comply with the\n\nregistration provision of Subchapter I: (1) he had no duty to register under\n\nany version of Megan\u2019s Law or Subchapter I of SORNA II where his crimes\n\nwere committed in 1994 and he was incarcerated until 2017; and (2)\n\nSubchapter I violates his fundamental constitutional right to reputation by\n\ncreating an irrebuttable presumption of future dangerousness.4 (See Krout\u2019s\n\nBrief, at 4, 9).\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n4  In the argument section of his brief, Krout makes two one-sentence\nallegations that trial counsel \u201cwas ineffective for failing to challenge Krout\u2019s\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\n                                               II.\n\n                                               A.\n\n       As a preliminary matter, the Commonwealth notes that Krout has\n\nwaived his issues on several bases, including by failing to raise them at the\n\nearliest possible opportunity pursuant to Section 9544(b) of the PCRA and in\n\nfailing to move to withdraw the guilty plea to Failure to Register or file a direct\n\nappeal. (See Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 8-9); Commonwealth v. McGriff,\n\n638 A.2d 1032, 1036 (Pa. Super. 1994) (\u201cOrdinarily, failure to petition to\n\nwithdraw plea, combined with failure to pursue direct appeal will bar\n\nconsideration of an attack on one\u2019s plea in collateral proceedings.\u201d); 42\n\nPa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b) (\u201c[A]n issue is waived if the petitioner could have raised it\n\nbut failed to do so before trial, at trial, during unitary review, on appeal or in\n\na prior state postconviction proceeding.\u201d).          However, legality of sentence\n\nclaims cannot be waived. See Commonwealth v. McIntyre, 232 A.3d 609\n\n(Pa. 2020).\n\n       Krout entered a guilty plea at which he admitted to Failing to Register\n\nand did not claim that he had no duty to do so under Subchapter I. He did\n\nnot file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea or file a direct appeal. However,\n\nwe interpret his claim as a challenge to the legality of his sentence. In other\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\nregistration requirements at the time he was charged with Failure to Register.\u201d\n(Krout\u2019s Brief, at 16, 18).\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\nwords, he could not be found guilty and sentenced for Failing to Register\n\npursuant to Subchapter I where he did not violate it and it is unconstitutional.\n\nHence, we will review the merits of his claims.\n\n                                               B.\n\n       Krout first contends that the PCRA court erred in dismissing his petition\n\nbecause he was not required to register on or after April 22, 1996, but before\n\nDecember 20, 2012, when he was incarcerated during that period as required\n\nby SORNA II, and the obligation to register does not commence until after\n\nrelease from prison.5, 6\n\n       Megan\u2019s Law became effective on April 21, 1996, and required lifetime\n\nregistration for individuals convicted of IDSI. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.55(b).\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n5  We note briefly that any argument that Krout is not required to register\nbecause he committed IDSI before Megan\u2019s Law was enacted fails. As\nobserved by the PCRA court, in Commonwealth v. Lacombe, 234 A.3d 602\n(Pa. 2020), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that Subchapter I of SORNA\nII is not punitive and, therefore, does not violate the ex post facto clause when\napplied retroactively. (See Rule 907 Notice, at 1). In T.S. v. Pennsylvania\nState Police, 241 A.3d 1091 (Pa. 2020), it extended Lacombe to reverse a\nfinding that Subchapter I does not apply where the defendant\u2019s sex crimes\noccurred in 1980 before the enactment of any registration scheme. As a\nresult, any claim that SORNA II does not apply because Krout committed the\nsubject IDSI prior to the enactment of a registration statute fails.\n\n6 Krout\u2019s issues raise questions of law. \u201c[O]ur standard of review from the\ndenial of a PCRA petition is limited to examining whether the PCRA court\u2019s\ndetermination is supported by the evidence of record and whether it is free of\nlegal error. \u2026 [W]e apply a de novo standard of review to the PCRA court\u2019s\nlegal conclusions.\u201d Commonwealth v. King, 259 A.3d 511, 520 (Pa. Super.\n2021).\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\nMegan\u2019s Law II replaced Megan\u2019s Law I and became effective on July 10, 2000.\n\nAs explained more fully in footnote 1, after several iterations of Megan\u2019s Law\n\nand SORNA, the General Assembly enacted SORNA II on December 20, 2012.\n\nSubchapter I of Act 29 provides that it applies to persons:\n\n             (1) convicted of a sexually violent offense committed on or\n       after April 22, 1996, but before December 20, 2012, whose period\n       of registration with the Pennsylvania State Police, as described in\n       section 9799.55 (relating to registration), has not expired; or\n\n             (2) required to register with the Pennsylvania State Police\n       under a former sexual offender registration law of this\n       Commonwealth on or after April 22, 1996, but before December\n       20, 2012, whose period of registration has not expired.\n\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.52.\n\n       Krout argues he did not become a person \u201crequired to register\u201d under\n\nSubsection (2) until he was released from prison, which was after December\n\n20, 2012.7 (See Krout\u2019s Brief, at 10-16). The Commonwealth responds that\n\n\u201cwhether [Krout] was a person required to register within the statutory\n\nframework is separate and apart from his period of registration and when it\n\nbegan.\u201d (Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 13).\n\n       In support of his position, Krout urges us to adopt the reasoning in the\n\nunpublished Commonwealth Court case, Smolsky v. Blacker, 2019 WL\n\n2400283, (Pa. Cmwlth. filed May 20, 2019) (unreported opinion), to support\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n7 We agree with Krout\u2019s claim that he does not fit in Subsection (1) because\nhis offense occurred in 1994 and we confine our review to that argument.\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\nhis position.8 In Smolsky, the petitioner argued that he was not required to\n\nregister under SORNA II because it was an ex post facto law under Muniz.\n\nSmolsky, supra at *2. The Commonwealth responded that Muniz did not\n\ndeclare SORNA II unconstitutional, and that the conviction and release dates\n\nare immaterial to the issue of whether Act 29 is constitutional. See id.\n\n       Smolsky committed the subject crimes in 1987, was convicted in 1989\n\nand sentenced in 1991.          He was released on parole in April 2017.      The\n\nCommonwealth Court found that Subchapter I by its plain terms does not\n\napply to Smolsky, reasoning:\n\n             First, he was not convicted of a sexually violent offense\n       committed \u201con or after December 20, 2012,\u201d nor was he\n       \u201cconvicted of a sexually violent offense committed on or after April\n       22, 1996, but before December 20, 2012.\u201d             42 Pa. C.S.\n       \u00a7\u00a7 9799.11(c), 9799.52(1). Rather, it is undisputed that Mr.\n       Smolsky was convicted in 1989 for offenses he committed in 1987.\n\n             Second, Mr. Smolsky was not \u201crequired to register with the\n       Pennsylvania State Police under a former sexual offender\n       registration law of this Commonwealth on or after April 22, 1996,\n____________________________________________\n\n\n8  Both the Superior Court and the Commonwealth Court have implemented\ninternal operating procedures that allow reliance on unreported decisions filed\nafter a certain date for their persuasive value. See Superior Court I.O.P.\n65.37(B) (Superior Court may rely on unpublished memorandum decisions\nfiled after May 2, 2019 for their persuasive value); Commonwealth Court\nI.O.P. 69.414(a) (Parties may cite to unreported Commonwealth Court panel\ndecisions filed after January 15, 2008 for their persuasive value). This Court\nis not bound by the decisions of the Commonwealth Court, but \u201csuch decisions\nprovide persuasive authority, and we may turn to our colleagues on the\nCommonwealth Court for guidance when appropriate.\u201d Commonwealth v.\nHunt, 220 A.3d 582, 590 (Pa. Super. 2019) (citation omitted). Instantly, it\nis appropriate for us to turn to our Commonwealth Court colleagues for\nguidance because Krout\u2019s claim is an issue of first impression in this Court.\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\n       but before December 20, 2012.\u201d 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 9799.52(2). A\n       convicted sex offender\u2019s registration obligation does not begin\n       until he or she is released from incarceration. See 42 Pa. C.S.\n       \u00a7 9799.15(b)(1)(i)(A) and (B) (stating that a sex offender\u2019s period\n       of registration \u201cshall commence upon . . . release from\n       incarceration in a State or county correctional facility\u201d or upon\n       \u201cparole or a sentence of probation\u201d). It is undisputed that Mr.\n       Smolsky was released on parole in April 2017. Thus, even if Mr.\n       Smolsky had been required to register under a prior version of\n       SORNA, he would not have been required to register between April\n       22, 1996 and December 20, 2012 because he was still\n       incarcerated during that period, as Mr. Blocker plainly\n       acknowledges.\n\nSmolsky, supra at *4-6.\n\n       However, Smolsky does not even have any persuasive authority\n\nbecause the en banc published opinion, C.M. v. Pennsylvania State Police,\n\n269 A.3d 1280 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2022), decided after our Supreme Court issued\n\nits decisions in Lacombe and T.S., rejected Smolsky and the same\n\narguments presented here.9\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n9 In C.M., the Commonwealth Court found its unreported panel decision in\nSmolsky to be \u201cunavailing.\u201d C.M., supra at 1285. It stated that Smolsky\nwas not precedential and distinguishable because the PSP did not raise the\narguments it did in C.M. and, therefore, the Court had not considered them\nin rendering its decision. The Court added that it had \u201cexpressly directed\nsupplemental briefing on the applicability of the registration requirement in\nthat case, but neither party provided any analysis in its supplemental brief\nthat was helpful to the Court\u201d and it was not its responsibility to argue on\nbehalf of a party. C.M., supra at 1285 (citing Smolsky, supra at *4 n.4\n(stating that \u201c[a]lthough they filed their supplemental briefs in a timely\nfashion, [the parties] failed to adequately address the question posed by this\nCourt or to provide any meaningful legal analysis to assist this Court in\ndeciding whether the provisions of [SORNA II] apply to Mr. Smolsky\u201d). We\nare not persuaded by Krout\u2019s argument that we should ignore this explanation\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\n       In C.M., the petitioner committed his relevant sexual crimes in 1987,\n\nwas sentenced prior to the Megan\u2019s Law enactment and was released from\n\nprison in 2020. C.M. argued that Subchapter I did not apply to him because\n\n\u201che was first \u2018required to register\u2019 under Megan\u2019s Law II \u2018upon release\u2019 from\n\nprison in 2020,\u201d but \u201cSubchapter I \u2026 applies only to offenders who were\n\n\u2018required to register ... on or after April 22, 1996, but before December 20,\n\n2012.\u2019\u201d C.M., supra at 1283. The Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) responded\n\nthat the obligation to register arose when Megan\u2019s Law II became effective\n\nin 2000 while C.M. was incarcerated and did not exclude incarcerated\n\nindividuals from the registration requirement.      Hence, only the duty to\n\nregister arose upon release from prison because, until that time, the person\u2019s\n\naddress was known. See id.\n\n       Rather than adopt the plain language approach used in Smolsky, in\n\nC.M., the Commonwealth Court distinguished when a defendant becomes\n\nobligated for lifetime registration from the procedure of how and when the\n\nperformance of the obligation would begin.         It found that, although a\n\ndefendant would not be required to perform the registration obligation until\n\nrelease from prison, he was obligated upon conviction of a listed offense.\n\nSee C.M., supra at 1284-85.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\nand we discern no reason to reach an opposite conclusion than the\nCommonwealth Court did on how to treat its own precedent.\n\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\n      The Court explained its reasoning, providing the pertinent legislative\n\nhistory, as follows:\n\n            Section 9795.1 of Megan\u2019s Law II was titled \u201cRegistration.\u201d\n      Section 9795.1(b)(2) of Megan\u2019s Law II imposed a lifetime\n      registration requirement on individuals convicted of listed\n      offenses, including rape, one of the crimes of which C.M. was\n      convicted. Formerly 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(2). \u2026 [N]othing in\n      that provision excepted already-incarcerated individuals from its\n      application. [See id.]\n\n            The point in time at which registration would begin,\n      however, was contained in a separate section of Megan\u2019s Law II,\n      Section 9795.2, titled \u201cRegistration Procedures and Applicability.\u201d\n      Formerly 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2. Section 9795.2(a)(1) provided:\n      \u201cOffenders and sexually violent predators shall be required to\n      register all current residences or intended residences with the\n      [PSP] upon release from incarceration, upon parole from a state\n      or county correctional institution, or upon the commencement of\n      a sentence of intermediate punishment or probation.\u201d Formerly\n      42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.2(a)(1) (2000).\n\n            Reading Section 9795.1 and 9795. together, it is apparent\n      that the obligation to register arose under Section 9795.1 upon\n      the enactment of Megan\u2019s Law II with regard to individuals\n      incarcerated for sex offenses on that date. Therefore, C.M., who\n      was incarcerated on the effective date of Megan\u2019s Law II, became\n      obligated for lifetime registration on that date.\n\n            By contrast, Section 9795.2, which expressly related only to\n      registration procedures, merely provided the timing and\n      mechanism of when and how performance of the registration\n      obligation would begin.      Thus, only C.M.\u2019s duty to begin\n      performing that obligation, not the obligation itself, arose upon his\n      subsequent release. The date of his release was irrelevant to his\n      registration obligation.\n\n             As discussed above, Subchapter I of SORNA II applies to\n      individuals who were \u201crequired to register with the [PSP] under a\n      former sexual offender registration law ... on or after April 22,\n      1996, but before December 20, 2012, whose period of registration\n      has not expired.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.52(2). C.M. incurred a\n      lifetime registration requirement upon the effective date of\n\n                                     - 11 -\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\n       Megan\u2019s Law II in 2000, i.e., after April 22, 1996, but before\n       December 20, 2012. As a lifetime requirement, it has not expired.\n       Accordingly, C.M. must register with the PSP for his lifetime.\n\nC.M., supra at 1284-85 (record citations omitted; emphases in original). We\n\nfind the reasoning of C.M., relying on the history of Megan\u2019s Law II and SORNA\n\nII, to be persuasive.\n\n       Here, Krout was convicted of IDSI, an enumerated offense, on\n\nNovember 18, 1996, seven months after Megan\u2019s Law I was enacted. After it\n\nwas found unconstitutional, Megan\u2019s Law I was replaced by Megan\u2019s Law II in\n\n2000, which immediately imposed a lifetime registration requirement on Krout\n\neffective immediately.       Hence, although his duty to begin performing his\n\nobligation arose upon his release, the obligation itself arose in 2000, i.e.,\n\nafter April 22, 1996, and before December 20, 2012, for purposes of\n\nSubsection I of Act 29.10\n\n       Moreover, we agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that to find\n\notherwise would produce absurd results. (See Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 13-\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n10 A petition for allowance of appeal on this issue filed on February 28, 2022,\nin the Pennsylvania Supreme Court from the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision\nin C.M. v. Pennsylvania State Police, 269 A.3d 1280 (Pa. Cmwlth 2022),\nat docket number 25 MAP 2022. Krout invites us to hold our disposition in\nabeyance pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. However, we decline to do\nso as it is this Court\u2019s duty to apply the law as it exists at the time of rendering\nour decision. See Commonwealth v. Rightley, 617 A.2d 1289, 1291 (Pa.\nSuper. 1992).\n\n\n                                          - 12 -\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\n14); Lewis, supra at 790 (\u201cThe legislature does not intend a result that is\n\nabsurd and unreasonable.\u201d). As observed by C.M.:\n\n      [T]he result of [Krout and] C.M.\u2019s construction of Subchapter I\n      would have absurd results.         For example, if two persons\n      committed sex offenses on the same day and were incarcerated\n      at the same time, and one of them, who committed a less serious\n      offense, was released before December 20, 2012, but the other,\n      who committed the more serious crime, was not released until\n      after December 20, 2012, [the petitioners\u2019] reading of the statute\n      would mean that the offender committing the less serious crime\n      would have to register and the offender committing the more\n      serious crime\u2014and thus posing the more serious risk of harm to\n      the public\u2014would not. Such a result would directly contravene\n      the legislative policy underlying both Megan\u2019s Law II and SORNA\n      II to protect \u201cthe safety and general welfare\u201d of Pennsylvania\n      citizens.     Formerly 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9791(b); 42 Pa.C.S.\n      \u00a7 9799.11(b)(1).\n\nC.M., supra at 1285-86 (record citations omitted). We agree with the above\n\nwell-reasoned explanation.\n\n      For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Krout is not entitled\n\nto relief on his first issue.\n\n                                       C.\n\n      Krout next claims that he cannot be required to register because SORNA\n\nII creates an irrebuttable presumption of future dangerousness in violation of\n\nhis fundamental constitutional right to reputation under the Due Process\n\nClause   of   the   Pennsylvania   Constitution   by   creating   an   irrebuttable\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 13 -\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\npresumption that he is at a high risk to commit another sexual offense.11 (See\n\nKrout\u2019s Brief, at 16). He maintains registration encroaches on the protected\n\nreputation interest by \u201cexpos[ing] registrants to ostracism,\u201d the \u201chigh risk\u201d\n\ndesignation is not universally true for all sex offenders and a reasonable\n\nalternative means exists for determining the risk of individual offenders. (Id.\n\nat 17-18).12 In support of that conclusion, he cites in his brief to a study\n\npurportedly supporting his position.\n\n       In challenging the constitutionality of a statute, a party \u201cmust meet the\n\nhigh burden of demonstrating that the statute clearly, palpably, and plainly\n\nviolates the Constitution.\u201d        In re J.B., 107 A.3d 1 (Pa. 2014) (citation\n\nomitted). \u201c[I]rrebuttable presumptions are violative of due process where the\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n11 Article I, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pennsylvania\u2019s due\nprocess clause, provides, \u201cAll men are born equally free and independent, and\nhave certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of\nenjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing and\nprotecting property and reputation, and of pursuing their own happiness.\u201d\n(emphasis added).\n\n12 Subchapter I also establishes a website to be operated in conjunction with\nthe statewide registry.     The website publishes information about each\nregistered offender including name and known aliases; year of birth;\nresidence; the location of any schools attended by the offender; employment\nlocation; a photograph updated yearly; a physical description of the offender;\nthe license plate number and a description of any vehicle owned or registered\nto the offender; a status report regarding whether the offender is compliant\nwith SORNA; an indication of whether the offender\u2019s victim was a minor; a\ndescription of the offense committed by the offender; the dates of the offense\nand conviction; and the location of the offender\u2019s temporary shelter and\nwhether the offender receives mail, if the offender is homeless. 42 Pa. C.S.\n\u00a7 9799.63(c).\n\n\n                                          - 14 -\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\npresumption is deemed not universally true and a reasonable alternative\n\nmeans of ascertaining that presumed fact are available.\u201d In re J.B., 107 A.3d\n\n1, 15 (Pa. 2014) (citation omitted).\n\n      Here, the PCRA court relied on our recent decision in Commonwealth\n\nv. Spears, 253 A.3d 280 (Pa. Super. 2021) (unreported memorandum), to\n\nsupport its conclusion that Krout\u2019s irrebuttable presumption claim lacks merit.\n\n(See Rule 907 Notice, at 2) (pagination provided). In Spears, we rejected a\n\nclaim that SORNA II violated any constitutional right to reputation because\n\nSubchapter I does not signal the dangerousness of any particular offender and\n\nmerely provides that adult sex offenders, as a group, have a high risk of\n\nrecidivism making a hearing on an offender\u2019s individual dangerousness\n\nirrelevant to the universal truth of the group as a whole. We do not follow\n\nSpears reasoning for several reasons.\n\n      First, Spears is in conflict with our Supreme Court\u2019s holding in\n\nCommonwealth v. Torsilieri, 232 A.3d 567 (Pa. 2020), where our Supreme\n\nCourt explicitly recognized the claim that the registration requirements of\n\nSORNA II could be unconstitutional because, among other things, it violated\n\nan offender\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to reputation.        Determining\n\ninstead that the factual record was not sufficiently developed in the trial court,\n\nour Supreme Court remanded \u201cto allow the parties to address whether a\n\nconsensus has developed to call into question the relevant legislative policy\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 15 -\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\ndecisions impacting offenders\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d     Torsilieri, supra at\n\n587.\n\n       Second, in Commonwealth v. Muhammad, 241 A.3d 1149, 1155 (Pa.\n\nSuper. 2020), in a precedential binding opinion, we held that a petitioner could\n\nraise both a facially and \u201cas applied\u201d challenge to SORNA II on the basis that\n\nthe registration requirements were violative of an offender\u2019s constitutional\n\nrights.13 In that case, in holding that the offender made out her \u201cas applied\u201d\n\nchallenge, we held that:\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n13   Muhammad observed:\n\n              There are two types of constitutional challenges, facial and\n       as-applied. Commonwealth v. Brown, 26 A.3d 485, 493 (Pa.\n       Super. 2011). A facial attack tests a law\u2019s constitutionality based\n       on its text alone without considering the facts or circumstances of\n       a particular case. Id. The court does not look beyond the\n       statute\u2019s explicit requirements or speculate about hypothetical or\n       imaginary cases. Germantown Cab Company v. Philadelphia\n       Parking Authority, 651 Pa. 604, 206 A.3d 1030, 1041 (2019).\n       An as-applied attack on a statute is more limited. It does not\n       contend that a law is unconstitutional as written, but that its\n       application to a particular person under particular circumstances\n       deprives that person of a constitutional right. Brown, 26 A.3d at\n       493. \u201c[W]hile as-applied challenges require application of the\n       ordinance to be ripe, facial challenges are different, and ripe upon\n       mere     enactment      of   the    ordinance.\u201d        Philadelphia\n       Entertainment & Development Partners v. City of\n       Philadelphia, 594 Pa. 468, 937 A.2d 385, 392 n. 7 (2007). It is\n       permissible to raise both facial and as-applied challenges to a\n       statute. Id. (addressing both facial and as-applied challenges to\n       tax ordinance).\n\nMuhammad, supra at 1155.\n\n\n                                          - 16 -\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\n      \u201c[R]eputation is an interest that is recognized and protected by\n      our highest state law: our Constitution.\u201d R. v. Department of\n      Public Welfare, 636 A.2d 142, 149 (Pa. 1994) (citing Pa. Const.,\n      Art. I, \u00a7 1). It is beyond serious dispute that registration as a sex\n      offender creates a presumption\u2014indeed, a stigma\u2014that Appellant\n      is a dangerous adult who is likely to commit further sexual\n      offenses. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9799.11(a)(4). This mark of disgrace\n      profoundly affects her ability to obtain employment, education,\n      and housing, which in turn impedes her ability to function as a\n      productive member of society. Furthermore, SORNA fails to\n      provide Appellant a meaningful opportunity to rebut the\n      presumption that she is a danger to re-offend.              She was\n      automatically designated a Tier I sexual offender based on her\n      convictions for interference and conspiracy, and she will not have\n      any opportunity to challenge this designation or claim that she has\n      been rehabilitated throughout the fifteen-year registration period.\n      These factors convince us that SORNA, as applied to this case,\n      creates an irrebuttable presumption that encroaches upon\n      Appellant\u2019s constitutional interest in her reputation.\n\nMuhammad, supra at 1158.\n\n      Because we are bound by the Muhammad holding that SORNA II may\n\nviolate an offender\u2019s right to reputation, the PCRA court erred in holding that\n\nKrout cannot maintain a claim that its registration unconstitutionally violates\n\nhis right to his reputation as applied.\n\n      Because the PCRA court dismissed Krout\u2019s PCRA petition without a\n\nhearing pursuant to Pa.Crim.R. 907(1), Krout was precluded from presenting\n\nany scientific evidence that SORNA registration requirements violated his due\n\nprocess rights. In Torsilieri, where the defendant submitted expert affidavits\n\nciting scientific studies indicating that sexual offenders had low recidivism\n\nrates, our Supreme Court determined that \u201ca hearing on the merits of the\n\nevidence\u201d was necessary instead of \u201cmere citations\u201d to studies. Because no\n\n\n                                     - 17 -\n\fJ-S21036-22\n\n\nevidence was allowed in the PCRA proceeding hearing, in accordance with\n\nTorsilieri, we vacate the order denying Krout\u2019s PCRA petition and remand for\n\na hearing at which the parties can present evidence regarding the\n\nconstitutionality of SORNA\u2019s registration requirements. See Torsilieri, supra\n\nat 596; see also Commonwealth v. Asher, 244 A.3d 27, 32 (Pa. Super.\n\n2021) (concluding that remand was necessary based on Torsilieri because\n\nthe defendant raised an irrebuttable presumption claim before the trial court,\n\nbut the court declined to hold a hearing).14\n\n       Order vacated. Case remanded. Jurisdiction relinquished.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D. Seletyn, Esq.\nProthonotary\n\n\n\nDate: 9/8/2022\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n14 Finally, we note that although Krout has failed to raise it as an independent\nissue, he alleges that trial counsel was ineffective for \u201cfailing to challenge his\nregistration requirements at the time he was charged with Failure to Register\u201d\non the bases raised in his brief. (Krout\u2019s Brief, at 16, 18). However, he\nprovides no discussion or pertinent citation for these bald one-sentence\nclaims, severely hampering our ability to conduct meaningful appellate review.\nSee Pa.R.A.P. 2119(a) (an appellant\u2019s argument shall contain \u201csuch discussion\nand citation of authorities as are deemed pertinent.\u201d). Hence, we find these\nissues waived. See Interest of D.C., 263 A.3d 326, 336 (Pa. Super. 2021)\n(finding waiver where appellant failed to provide citation to authority and\nrecord).\n\n                                          - 18 -\n\f",
