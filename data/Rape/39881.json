BROWNING, District Judge.\nTHIS MATTER comes before the Court on the CCA Defendants\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, filed September 20, 2014 (Doc. 63)(\u201cMotion\u201d). The Court held a hearing on September 5, 2014. The primary issue is whether Defendant Corrections Corporation of America (\u201cCCA\u201d) can be held vicariously liable for a sexual battery that one of its correctional officers, Defendant Dale Greffet, committed against one of its inmates, Plaintiff Crystal Pe\u00f1a. Under the aided-in-agency theory that the Supreme Court of New Mexico articulated in Ocana v. American Furniture Co., 2004-NMSC-018, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58 (Maes, C.J.)(unanimous)(\u201cOca/jm\u201d), CCA is vicariously liable for Greffet\u2019s intentional torts if Greffet\u2019s agency relationship with CCA provided him with extraordinary power over Pe\u00f1a and that power aided him in committing those torts. Whether Gref-fet\u2019s CCA-imparted power over Pe\u00f1a aided him in sexually battering her is a question of fact, and, as Pe\u00f1a\u2019s allegations make it plausible that it did, this question is one for the jury.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe Court takes its facts from the Amended Complaint for Civil Rights Violations and Common Law Torts, filed February 28, 2013 (Doc. 30)(\u201cComplaint\u201d), as it must in ruling on a rule 12(c) motion, see Ramirez v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 192 F.R.D. 303, 304 (D.N.M.2000) (citing Irish Lesbian &amp; Gay Org. v. Giuliani, 143 F.3d 638, 644 (2d Cir.1998)). In July, 2009, Pe\u00f1a was a post-conviction prisoner at the New Mexico Women\u2019s Correctional Facility (\u201cNMWCF\u201d). See Complaint \u00b6 3, at 1-2. At all times material to Pe\u00f1a\u2019s allegations, CCA operated and maintained the NMWCF pursuant to a contract with the State of New Mexico, and was bound to comply with certain New Mexico Corrections Department (\u201cNMCD\u201d) policies. Complaint \u00b6 4, at 2. CCA employed Defendant Arlene Hickson as the NMWCF\u2019s warden, and, as such, she was the facility\u2019s head supervisor. See Complaint \u00b6 5, at 2. During the time period throughout which the underlying conduct took place, CCA employed Greffet and Defendant Carlos Vallejos as corrections officers at the NMWCF. See Complaint \u00b6 6, at 2.\nThe boyfriend of Pe\u00f1a\u2019s mother raped Pe\u00f1a when she was a young child on two separate occasions. See Complaint \u00b6 7, at 2. Before the events in the Complaint, Pe\u00f1a had been diagnosed with debilitating mental illnesses. See Complaint \u00b6 8, at 2. In the spring of 2009, while Pe\u00f1a was isolated in the NMWCF\u2019s segregation unit, *1106Greffet befriended her and initiated, cultivated, and encouraged an intimate relationship with her contrary to CCA\u2019s and NMCD\u2019s policies and procedures. See Complaint \u00b6 9, at 2. The claims alleged in the Complaint arise from five distinct incidences: (i) Greffet\u2019s alleged sexual abuse at the NMWCF in July/August, 2009; (ii) Greffet\u2019s alleged sexual abuse in Alamogordo, New Mexico, around Labor Day weekend, 2009; (iii) Greffet\u2019s alleged sexual abuse in Albuquerque, New Mexico, around August, 2010; (iv) Vallejos\u2019 alleged assault and battery in a hallway at the NMWCF in June, 2011; and (v) Pe\u00f1a\u2019s being placed and kept in segregation following her sexual abuse report in 2011.\n1. The July/AugUst, 2009, Alleged Sexual Abuse at the NMWCF.\nBeginning in July of 2009, Greffet began to make advances and sexual comments to Pe\u00f1a about her physical appearance, which', for a period of time, Pe\u00f1a resisted. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 1011, at 2. In July and August of 2009, Greffet began to sexually fondle2 Pe\u00f1a. See Complaint \u00b6 12, at 3. During the same time frame, Greffet made numerous false statements to Pe\u00f1a, including expressing his intent to enter into a committed relationship with her and his desire that they raise children together after her release from custody. See Complaint \u00b6 13, at 3. Pe\u00f1a, relying on these statements, came to believe that Greffet was committed to a monogamous relationship with her in which the two of them would raise children. See Complaint \u00b6 14, at 3. Pe\u00f1a was particularly susceptible to these advances, because of her history of sexual victimization, her diagnosed mental illnesses, and her aspiration to live a life of love and normalcy. See Complaint \u00b6 15, at 3. At some point during late July or early August of 2009, Greffet called Pe\u00f1a into the commanding officer\u2019s office in front of the master control area of the NMWCF, and, sitting at the desk, revealed his erect penis to Pe\u00f1a, and told her to look and see the effect that she had on him. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, at 3. With Pe\u00f1a under the desk, Greffet orally sodomized her. See Complaint \u00b6 18, at 3.\n2. The Labor Day Weekend, 2009, Alleged Sexual Abuse in Alamogordo.\nOn or about late August of 2009, Pe\u00f1a paroled to Ruidoso, New Mexico, from the NMWCF. See Complaint \u00b6 19, at 4. After Pe\u00f1a paroled, Greffet obtained Pe\u00f1a\u2019s telephone number from Pe\u00f1a\u2019s aunt, who was incarcerated at the NMWCF. See Complaint \u00b6 20, at 3. Greffet contacted te\u00f1a and pressured her to meet him. See Complaint \u00b6 20, at 3. On Labor Day weekend of 2009, just before Pe\u00f1a entered into an inpatient treatment program in Alamogordo as a condition of her probation, Greffet rented a motel room for the two of them. See Complaint \u00b6 21, at 4. During their stay in the motel room, Greffet raped3 Pe\u00f1a on four occasions. See Complaint \u00b6 22, at 4. *1107In the motel room, Pe\u00f1a resisted Greffet\u2019s efforts to orally and anally sodomize her, but relented when Greffet persisted. See Complaint \u00b6 23, at 4.\nOn or about October of 2009, Pe\u00f1a\u2019s parole was revoked, and she returned to the NMWCF, where Greffet continued to work. See Complaint \u00b6 24, at 4. After returning from parole, Greffet continued to falsely state his commitment to Pe\u00f1a and his intent to raise children with her, to 'make sexual advances toward her, and to sexually fondle her. See Complaint \u00b6 25, at 4. On or around April of 2010, Greffet left his position at the NMWCF. Before he left, however, Greffet again expressed his plans to live with Pe\u00f1a and to raise children with her. See Complaint \u00b6 26, at 4.\n3. The August, 2010, Alleged Sexual Abuse in Albuquerque.\nOn or about August of 2010, the NMWCF again released Pe\u00f1a on probation. A condition of. her probation was that she enroll in an in-patient treatment program for her mental health. See Complaint \u00b6 27, at 4. Pe\u00f1a reported to and tried to qualify for the Maya\u2019s Place treatment program in Albuquerque. See Complaint \u00b6 28, at 4. During this time frame, Greffet raped Pe\u00f1a on three occasions, again notwithstanding her resistance to anal sodomy. See Complaint \u00b629, at 4.-Greffet conceived a child with Pe\u00f1a during this time frame. See Complaint \u00b6 29, at 4. Eventually, Maya\u2019s Place rejected Pe\u00f1a because, as she suffered from mental illness rather than drug dependence, she did not fit the program\u2019s criteria for admittance. See Complaint \u00b6 30, at 5.\nBecause she was unable to enter a treatment program and thereby satisfy her condition of probation, Pe\u00f1a turned herself into law enforcement in September of 2010. See Complaint \u00b6 31, at 5. As she was surrendering to authorities, Pe\u00f1a fainted, was taken to the emergency room, and learned for the first time that she was pregnant. See Complaint \u00b6 33, at 5. Gref-fet promised to bond her out from Do\u00f1a Ana County Detention Center in Las-Cruces, New Mexico, where she would be held, but never did so. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 32,' 36, at 5. The next day, from jail, Pe\u00f1a told Greffet that she was pregnant. See Complaint \u00b6 34, at 5. Greffet thought that aborting the baby was the best option, and, accordingly, Pe\u00f1a and the Do\u00f1a Ana County Detention Center made arrangements for the abortion. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, at 5. Pe\u00f1a could not go through with the abortion, however, and returned to jail with the baby still in \u00fatero. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, at 5. Eventually, Pe\u00f1a realized that Greffet was not going to bond her and that she was going to have to deliver the child in jail. See Complaint \u00b6 36, at 5. She discussed with Greffet how to care for the child during the child\u2019s first months of life, when she would still be incarcerated. See Complaint \u00b6 36, at 5. Greffet said he would not care for the baby and that adoption was the best option. See Complaint \u00b6 37, at 5. Before giving birth, and in large part because of her inability to find someone to care for the baby while she remained in prison, Pe\u00f1a felt compelled to relinquish her parental rights. See Complaint \u00b6 38, at 6. She gave birth to her son on May 2, 2011, while incarcerated at the NMWCF. See Complaint \u00b6 39, at 6.\n4. Vallejos\u2019 Alleged Assault and Battery.\nOn or around early June of 2011, Pe\u00f1a was suffering from postpartum depression, *1108in addition to her other mental illnesses, and was grieving her estrangement from her son in the NMWCF\u2019s hallway. See Complaint \u00b6 40, at 6. Vallejos verbally engaged Pe\u00f1a in the hallway, asking her what was wrong. See Complaint \u00b6 41, at 6. Pe\u00f1a was despondent and traumatized, and did not have the will or the desire to explain to Vallejos her predicament or her feelings; she continued to walk toward her unit, where she intended to contact mental health for immediate mental health treatment. See Complaint \u00b6 42, at 6. When Pe\u00f1a failed to respond to Vallejos\u2019 questioning, he pursued her down the hallway, grabbed her from behind and slammed her against the wall of the hallway, causing bruising to her arms and triggering severe symptoms of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder. See Complaint \u00b6 43-44, at 6. Because of Vallejos\u2019 battery of Pe\u00f1a and his mistreatment of other inmates at the facility, CCA removed him from his position at the NMWCF. See Complaint \u00b6 42, at 6.\n5. The Alleged Retaliation Against Pe\u00f1a.\nCCA and Hickson placed Pe\u00f1a in isolated/segregated confinement in response to the incident with Vallejos. See Complaint \u00b6 47, at 7. While Pe\u00f1a was in segregation at the NMWCF, CCA and Hickson learned that she was accusing Greffet of raping her; they pressured her to provide them with a statement about the incident. See Complaint \u00b6 48, at 7. When Pe\u00f1a refused to provide them with a statement about Greffet, and when it became clear that she was also accusing Vallejos of assault and battery, CCA and Hickson kept her in varying levels of segregated confinement for a period of approximately eight months, in violation of CCA\u2019s and NMCD\u2019s policies. See Complaint \u00b6 49, at 7. Her placement in segregated confinement severely aggravated her fragile mental condition, prevented her from contacting the outside world, including her mother and her son\u2019s adoptive parents, and caused her to lose good time and to remain incarcerated for a longer period of time, resulting in severe mental and emotional distress. See Complaint \u00b6 50, at 7.\n\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nPe\u00f1a brings this action against Greffet and Vallejos in their individual capacities, against Hickson in her individual and official capacity, and against CCA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, for their alleged violation of her civil rights arising under the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to Constitution of the United States of America. See Complaint at 1. In Count I, Pe\u00f1a alleges that Greffet sexually fondled her while she was incarcerated in the NMWCF, and orally sodomized her in the NMWCF, in violation of her Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, \u201cincluding the right to be secure in her bodily integrity and free from sexual advances, sexual fondling, sexual intercourse, anal sodomy, and oral sodomy by prison personnel.\u201d Complaint \u00b6 52, at 7-8. Pe\u00f1a alleges that Gref-fet\u2019s sexual fondling, sodomy, and rapes proximately caused her damages and injuries, and she requests the Court grant \u201ccompensatory and punitive damages against Defendant Greffet, together with all costs and attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Complaint \u00b6 57, at 8.\nIn Count II, Pe\u00f1a alleges that Vallejos\u2019 conduct in \u201cgrabbing Plaintiff and slamming her against a wall\u201d violated her Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and to be free from \u201cunreasonable, unnecessary, and excessive force.... \u201d Complaint \u00b6 60, at 9. Pe\u00f1a asserts that Vallejos\u2019 use of \u201cunreasonable, unnecessary, and excessive force against Plaintiff was intentional, malicious, sadistic, willful, wanton, obdurate, and in *1109gross and reckless disregard for Plaintiffs constitutional rights.\u201d Complaint \u00b6 61, at 9. She requests the same relief in Count II that she does in Count I. See Complaint \u00b6 64, at 9.\nIn Count III, Pe\u00f1a alleges that CCA and Hickson violated her Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to be free from exposure to \u201cunreasonable risks of harm or from exercising deliberate indifference toward her safety, security, and constitutional rights,\u201d because CCA and Hickson \u201cengaged in a custom of suppressing, denying or disregarding incidents of prison rape.... \u201d Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 66-67, at 10. The incidents of rape are alleged to include: (i) placing inmates who reported sexual or other staff misconduct in segregation, or otherwise retaliating against them; (ii) violating internal and NMCD policies by failing to report allegations of prison rape to outside law enforcement; (iii) failing to conduct adequate internal investigations of rape allegations; and (iv) offering financial incentives for non-reporting. See Complaint \u00b6 67, at 10. She requests the same relief in Count III that she does in Counts I and II. See Complaint \u00b6 69, at 10.\nIn Count IV, Pe\u00f1a alleges that CCA and Hickson violated her First Amendment right to be free from retaliation for reporting sexual or physical assaults by prison officers, her Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, her Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process, and CCA and NMCD policies, when they placed and kept Pe\u00f1a in \u201csegregated confinement following her reporting of Defendant Gref-fet\u2019s rapes and Carlos Vallejos\u2019 assault.\u201d Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 71-72, at 11. She requests the same relief in Count IV that she does in the other Counts. See Complaint \u00b6 75, at 11.\nIn Count V, Pe\u00f1a alleges that Greffet is liable for the intentional torts of battery and rape for his rapes of Pe\u00f1a in Alamogordo and in Albuquerque when she \u201clacked the capacity to consent thereto[, and i]n any case, ... did not consent to the sex.\u201d Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 77,. at 12. Pe\u00f1a alleges that CCA is legally liable under New Mexico law for Greffet\u2019s tortious conduct under the doctrine of respondeat superior, as Pe\u00f1a \u201cwas directly informed and/or had reason to believe that Defendant Greffet was an agent and employee of\u2019 CCA. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 80-81, at 12. She seeks the same relief in Count V as in the other Counts. See Complaint \u00b6 81, at 12.\nIn Count VI, Pe\u00f1a alleges that Vallejos, in \u201cviolently grabbing [her] and slamming her against the wall,\u201d committed an intentional offensive touching to Pe\u00f1a\u2019s person, and Vallejos is thus liable for the intentional tort of battery. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 83, at 13. Pe\u00f1a alleges that CCA is also liable for this intentional tort of Vallejos under the respondeat superior theory, as he was acting as CCA\u2019s agent and employee at all material times. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 87-88, at 13. She seeks the same relief in Count VI as in the other claims. See Complaint \u00b6 88, at 13.\nThe Court has already dismissed several other claims that Pe\u00f1a initially alleged. In its Memorandum Opinion and Order, filed January 28, 2013 (Doc. 22)(\u201cMOO\u201d), the Court dismissed \u00a7 1983 claims arising from sexual encounters between her and Greffet that occurred outside of the NMWCF. See MOO at 2. The Court also dismissed vicarious liability claims against CCA for Greffet\u2019s conduct outside of the NMWCF. See MOO at 2-3.\nOn July 19, 2013, attorneys for both sides filed a motion asking the Court to stay proceedings to allow the parties to litigate \u201cwhether, in the event that Plaintiff prevails on her intentional tort claim against former CCA-employee Greffet, Defendant CCA could be held vicariously lia*1110ble, or otherwise financially responsible for a judgment against him.\u201d See Unopposed Joint Motion to Stay Proceedings at 1, filed July 19, 2013 (Doc. 56). The Court granted that motion. See Order, filed July 25, 2013 (Doc. 57). Within the month, Pe\u00f1a filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the Issue of Vicarious Liability, filed August 16, 2013 (Doc. 60)(\u201cMSJ\u201d). In the MSJ, Pe\u00f1a asserts that CCA \u201cbestowed [Greffet] with the authority to control [Pe\u00f1a\u2019s] movement[,] to meet with inmates in a private and discrete offiee[,] and to make disciplinary determinations.\u201d MSJ at 6. These powers \u201cenabled Defendant Greffet to order Ms. Pe\u00f1a to the secluded Commander\u2019s office, thereby aiding him in accomplishing\u201d the alleged sexual misconduct, and Greffet\u2019s \u201cauthority as a Lieutenant to impose or dispose of disciplinary actions was a contributing factor to M. Pe\u00f1a\u2019s submission\u201d to the alleged sexual misconduct. MSJ at 6. Pe\u00f1a argues that this allegation establishes CCA\u2019s vicarious liability for Greffet\u2019s alleged tor-tious actions in the NMWCF under the aided-in-agency theory of liability, which the Supreme Court of New Mexico adopted in Ocana. See MSJ at 4. Pe\u00f1a withdrew the MSJ two months after she filed it, at the reply stage of the briefing. See Reply to Defendants\u2019 Response to Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed October 16, 2013 (Doc. 70)(\u201cPlaintiff hereby withdraws [the MSJ].\u201d).\nOn September 20, 2013, CCA, Hickson, and Vallejos (collectively, the \u201cCCA Defen-' dants\u201d) filed the Motion now before the Court, asking the court to enter judgment against Pe\u00f1a on the vicarious-liability issue. See Motion at 3-4, 5-6. They contend that Pe\u00f1a falls short of the facial plausibility standard expressed in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), by failing to expressly allege aided-in-agency liability or to allege facts that would support such a claim. See Defendants MFJ at 3-4, 5-6. The CCA Defendants argue that, because Pe\u00f1a \u201cmerely alleges that Greffet ... \u2018called\u2019 her \u2018into the Commander\u2019s office[]\u2019 and \u2018orally sodomized her,\u2019 \u201d she fails to establish Greffet either \u201cpurported to act or speak on behalf of [CCA,] and there was reliance upon apparent authority, or [that Greffet] was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency.\u201d Motion at 6.\nThe CCA Defendants contend that Pe\u00f1a\u2019s pleaded facts demonstrate that Greffet was not aided by his role as an agent of CCA in committing the alleged sexual misconduct at the NMWCF. See Motion at 6. The CCA Defendants note that Pe\u00f1a alleges that Greffet \u201ccontinued to sexually assault her even after she was released from NMWC[F] and after he was no longer employed by CCA,\u201d which they say indicates that \u201cthe conduct did not occur as a result of the agency relationship.\u201d Motion at 7. For support, the CCA Defendants cite EEOC v. Genesco, Inc., No. CIV 09-0652 WJ/RHS, 2011 WL 2490634 (D.N.M. Apr. 12, 2011) (Johnson, J.), which found no aided-in-agency liability where \u201charassment occurred before, during, and after the period in which [the defendant] was [the plaintiffs] supervisor.\u201d Motion at 7 (quoting 2011 WL 2490634, at *3) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the CCA Defendants contend that the Court \u201calready rejected an aided-in-agency theory of liability based on\u201d an alleged sexual assault in Alamogordo after the NMWCF released Pe\u00f1a, \u201cbecause \u2018Pe\u00f1a\u2019s factual allegations plead that Gref-fet\u2019s sexual assault was contrary to CCA\u2019s and NMCD\u2019s policies.\u2019 \u201d Motion at 67 (citation omitted). In light of Pe\u00f1a\u2019s pleaded facts, the CCA Defendants contend that \u201cit is not plausible to suggest that Greffet was acting pursuant to his agency authority.\u201d Motion at 6-7. Additionally, the CCA Defendants warn that \u201cto construe Pe\u00f1a\u2019s *1111Amended Complaint as alleging an aided-in-agency theory would turn the theory \u2018into strict liability for employers whenever a supervisor commits a tort upon an employee while the employee is on duty.\u2019 \u201d Motion at 7 (citation omitted). Last, the CCA Defendants note that, while the Restatement (Second) of Agency \u2014 which the Supreme Court of New Mexico consulted in Ocana \u2014 recognizes the aided-in-agency theory of vicarious liability, the Restatement (Third) of Agency, published since Ocana, abandons the doctrine altogether.\nA little less than a month after the CCA Defendants filed the Motion, Pe\u00f1a filed her Response in Opposition to Defendants\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, filed October 16, 2013 (Doc. 69)(\u201cRe-sponse\u201d). Pe\u00f1a contends that the Court \u201calready determined that the original complaint plausibly alleged an aided-in-agency theory\u201d based on the alleged sexual misconduct in the NMWCF, Response at 3, when, in its MOO, the Court wrote:\nWhile Pe\u00f1a was an inmate at NMWCF and Greffet was a corrections officer there, as Judge Boasberg concluded in Doe v. Sipper, Greffet could have plausibly used his authority as an officer as an instrumentality to force Pe\u00f1a to come to the corrections office in the guise of furthering CCA\u2019s or NMWCF\u2019s business, and allegedly sexual assaulting her there.\nResponse at 3 (quoting MOO at 110). Additionally, Pe\u00f1a argues that she plausibly alleged a claim for aided-in-agency liability for the alleged NMWCF sexual misconduct. She contends that, because Greffet \u201ccultivated a relationship\u201d with Pe\u00f1a while she was an inmate and \u201ccalled Plaintiff into the Commander\u2019s office [and] revealed his erect penis and proceeded to orally sodomize her\u201d at a time when Pe\u00f1a \u201cperceived Defendant Greffet to be an agent and employee of CCA, ... it is plainly plausible\u201d that Greffet was \u201caided\u201d in committing the alleged sexual misconduct \u201cby virtue of his access to Plaintiff ..., his authority over Plaintiff ..., and his ability ... to summon Plaintiff to a \u2018Commander\u2019s Office\u2019 in order to perpetrate sexual abuse.\u201d Response at 4. In other words, Pe\u00f1a argues that \u201cit is plausible that the \u2018instrumentality\u2019 of Defendant Greffet\u2019s authority as a CCA corrections officer aided and enabled him to access Plaintiff, and to \u2018summon\u2019 her to the Commander\u2019s Office.\u201d Response at 4.\nPe\u00f1a also argues that the CCA Defendants are misguided when they characterize the aided-in-agency theory as being unavailable when the agent\u2019s conduct violates the principal\u2019s standard policies and procedures. She contends: \u201cThis argument conflates the concept of being aided by an agency relationship with the principal with the concept of being compliant with the policies of the principal\u201d and that, \u201c[c]ontrary to Defendants\u2019 strained position, one can accomplish the former while violating the latter.\u201d Response at 4-5 (emphases in original). Pe\u00f1a notes \u201c[t]here is no case law supporting the.notion that the violation of a principal\u2019s policies or procedures precludes application of the aided-in-agency doctrine.\u201d Response at 5. Furthermore, Pe\u00f1a contends that the CCA Defendants improperly rely on the MOO to support this claim; she argues that, rather than holding that violating policies and regulation precludes the aided-in-agency theory, the Court was rejecting Pe\u00f1a\u2019s \u201cimplied authority\u201d theory of vicarious liability. Response at 5. Finally, Pe\u00f1a refutes the CCA Defendants\u2019 argument that, if two of the three alleged incidents of sexual misconduct occurred outside of the NMWCF, then Greffet could not have been aided-in-agency by CCA. She calls that argument \u201cfacially absurd\u201d and contends that \u201c[t]he fact that Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Greffet abused her on multiple occasions cannot, as a matter *1112of logic, disprove that his agency aided him in abusing her the first time.\u201d Response at 5.\nThe CCA Defendants replied roughly a month later. See CCA Defendants\u2019 Reply in Support of Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, filed November 15, 2013 (Doc. 71)(\u201cReply\u201d). The Reply notes that, because Pe\u00f1a withdrew her MSJ, the Court should resolve the vicarious-liability question by way of the Motion. See Reply at 1. They devote the first portion of their brief to arguing that the Court did not earlier rule on whether the Complaint sufficiently pleaded the aided-in-agency theory. See Reply at 2-5. As the Court will analyze the aided-in-agency theory anew here, the Court will not summarize that argument. Next, they renew their argument that the Complaint\u2019s allegations do not establish an aided-in-agency theory, going into the details of how Pe\u00f1a pled her Complaint. See Reply at 5-6. They also attack the aided-in-agency theory generally, arguing that it \u201cwould impose per se vicarious liability on an employer for an employee\u2019s tort, particularly in a custodial setting, regardless of whether it occurred in the course and scope of the employee\u2019s employment.\u201d Reply at 6.\n\nLAW REGARDING JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS UNDER RULE 12(e)\n\n\u201cAfter the pleadings are closed\u2014 but early enough not to delay trial \u2014 a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). A rule 12(c) motion is designed to provide a means of disposing of cases when the material facts are not in dispute between the parties. See Kruzits v. Okuma Mach. Tool, Inc., 40 F.3d 52, 54 (3d Cir.1994) (\u201cUnder Rule 12(c), we will not grant judgment on the pleadings unless the movant clearly establishes that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (citation omitted)(internal quotation marks omitted)). A \u201c[jjudgment on the pleadings should not be granted \u2018unless the moving party has clearly established that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d Park Univ. Enters., Inc. v. Am. Cas. Co. of Reading, PA, 442 F.3d 1239, 1244 (10th Cir.2006) (citing United States v. Any &amp; All Radio Station Transmission Equip., 207 F.3d 458, 462 (8th Cir.2000)). Claims dismissed pursuant to a motion under rule 12(c) are dismissed with prejudice. See In re Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. LLC, 624 F.3d 201, 209 (5th Cir.2010).\n\u201cAny party may move for judgment on the pleadings if no material facts are in dispute and the dispute can be resolved on both the pleadings and any facts of which the Court can take judicial notice.\u201d Ramirez v. WaL-Mart Stores, Inc., 192 F.R.D. at 304 (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c)). A motion pursuant to rule 12(c) is generally treated in the same manner as a motion to dismiss under rule 12(b)(6). See Ramirez v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 192 F.R.D. at 304 (citing Irish Lesbian &amp; Gay Org. v. Giuliani, 143 F.3d 638, 644 (2d Cir.1998)). A motion for a judgment on the pleadings will be granted if the pleadings demonstrate that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Ramirez v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 192 F.R.D. at 304.\nA court considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings should \u201caccept all facts pleaded by the non-moving party as true and grant all reasonable inferences from the pleadings in favor of the same.\u201d Park Univ. Enters. Inc. v. Am. Cas. Co. of Reading, PA, 442 F.3d at 1244. The court must view the facts presented in the pleadings and draw the inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Ramirez v. Wal-Mart Stores, *1113Inc., 192 F.R.D. at 304. All of the non-moving parties\u2019 allegations are deemed to be true, and all of the movants\u2019 contrary assertions are taken to be false. See Nat\u2019l Metro. Bank v. United States, 323 U.S. 454, 456-57, 65 S.Ct. 354, 89 L.Ed. 383 (1945); Ramirez v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 222 F.3d 1238, 1240 (10th Cir.2000); Freeman v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 949 F.2d 360, 361 (10th Cir.1991).\nThe same standards that govern a motion to dismiss under rule 12(b)(6) also govern a motion for judgment on the pleadings under rule 12(c). See Atl. Richfield Co. v. Farm Credit Bank, 226 F.3d 1138, 1160 (10th Cir.2000). Under rule 12(b)(6), a court may dismiss a complaint for \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). \u201cThe nature of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the sufficiency of the allegations within the four corners of the complaint after taking those allegations as true.\u201d Mobley v. McCormick, 40 F.3d 337, 340 (10th Cir.1994). The sufficiency of a complaint is a question of law, and when considering and addressing a rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must accept as true all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint, view those allegations in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. See Moore v. Guthrie, 438 F.3d 1036, 1039 (10th Cir.2006); Hous. Auth. of Kaw Tribe v. City of Ponca City, 952 F.2d 1183, 1187 (10th Cir.1991).\nA complaint challenged by a rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not require detailed factual allegations, but a plaintiffs obligation to set forth the grounds of his or her entitlement to relief \u201crequires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he Supreme Court recently ... prescribed a new inquiry for us to use in reviewing a dismissal: whether the complaint contains \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d Ridge at Red Hawk, LLC v. Schneider, 493 F.3d 1174, 1177 (10th Cir.2007) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 558, 562, 127 S.Ct. 1955). \u201cThe [Supreme] Court explained that a plaintiff must \u2018nudge his claims across the line from conceivable to plausible\u2019 in order to survive a motion to dismiss.\u201d Ridge at Red Hawk, LLC v. Schneider, 493 F.3d at 1177 (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955) (alterations omitted). \u201cThus, the mere metaphysical possibility that some plaintiff could prove some set of facts in support of the pleaded claims is insufficient; the complaint must give the court reason to believe that this plaintiff has a reasonable likelihood of mustering factual support for these claims.\u201d Ridge at Red Hawk, LLC v. Schneider, 493 F.3d at 1177. The Tenth Circuit has stated:\n\u201c[PJlausibility\u201d in this context must refer to the scope of the allegations in a complaint: if they are so general that they encompass a wide swath of conduct, much of it innocent, then the plaintiffs \u201chave not nudged their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d The allegations must be enough that, if assumed to be true, the plaintiff plausibly (not just speculatively) has a claim for relief.\nThis requirement of plausibility serves not only to weed out claims that do not (in the absence of additional allegations) have a reasonable prospect of success, but also to inform the defendants of the actual grounds of the claim against *1114them. \u201cWithout some factual allegation in the complaint, it is hard to see how a claimant could satisfy the requirement of providing not only \u2018fair notice\u2019 of the nature of the claim, but also \u2018grounds\u2019 on which the claim rests.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. at 1965 n. 3. See Airborne Beepers &amp; Video, Inc. v. AT &amp; T Mobility LLC, 499 F.3d 663, 667 (7th Cir.2007) (\u201c[A]t some point the factual detail in a complaint may be so sketchy that the complaint does not provide the type of notice of the claim to which the defendant is entitled under Rule 8.\u201d). The Twombly Court was particularly critical of complaints that \u201cmentioned no specific time, place, or person involved in the alleged conspiracies.\u201d 127 S.Ct. at 1971 n. 10. Given such a complaint, \u201ca defendant seeking to respond to plaintiffs\u2019 conclusory allegations ... would have little idea where to begin.\u201d Id.\nRobbins v. Oklahoma, 519 F.3d 1242, 1247-48 (10th Cir.2008) (footnote omitted) (citations omitted).\nIn determining the sufficiency of a complaint, all well-pleaded factual allegations are to be taken as true. See Timpanogos Tribe v. Conway, 286 F.3d 1195, 1204 (10th Cir.2002). \u201cNevertheless, conclusory allegations without supporting factual aver-ments are insufficient to state a claim upon which relief can be based.\u201d Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991). \u201cMoreover, in analyzing the sufficiency of the plaintiffs complaint, the court need accept as true only the plaintiffs well-pleaded factual contentions, not his conclu-sory allegations.\u201d Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d at 1110. Only well-pleaded facts, as distinguished from conclusory allegations, are admitted when considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See Smith v. Plati, 258 F.3d 1167, 1174 (10th Cir.2001).\nA court must convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment if \u201cmatters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court,\u201d and \u201call parties ... [are] given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d). Facts subject t\u00f3 judicial notice may be considered without converting a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. See Grynberg v. Koch Gateway Pipeline Co., 390 F.3d 1276, 1279, n. 1 (10th Cir.2004) (citing 27A Federal Procedure, Lawyers\u2019 Ed. \u00a7 62:520 (2003)). Furthermore, when considering a motion to dismiss, \u201cthe court is permitted to take judicial notice of its own files and records, as well as facts which are a matter of public record.\u201d Van Woudenberg v. Gibson, 211 F.3d 560, 568 (10th Cir.2000), abrogated on other grounds by McGregor v. Gibson, 248 F.3d 946, 955 (10th Cir.2001). A court may consider documents to which the complaint refers if the documents are central to the plaintiffs claim and the parties do not dispute the documents\u2019 authenticity. See Jacobsen v. Deseret Book Co., 287 F.3d 936, 941-42 (10th Cir.2002). If, however, a document is not incorporated by reference or attached to the complaint, but the complaint refers to the document and the document is central to the plaintiffs claim, the defendant may submit an \u201cindisputably authentic copy to the court to be considered on a motion to dismiss.\u201d GFF Corp. v. Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc., 130 F.3d 1381, 1384 (10th Cir.1997). See 5A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 1327 (3d ed. 2004)(\u201c[W]hen the plaintiff fails to introduce a pertinent document as part of her pleading ... the defendant may introduce the document as an exhibit to a motion attacking the sufficiency of the pleading.\u201d).\n\nLAW REGARDING VICARIOUS LIABILITY\n\n\u201cUnder basic respondeat superi- or principles, an employer is liable for an *1115employee\u2019s torts committed within the scope of his or her employment.\u201d Lymon v. Aramark Corp., 728 F.Supp.2d 1222, 1271 (D.N.M.2010) (Browning, J.)(quoting Ocana, 2004-NMSC-018, \u00b6 29, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58). \u201c[A]n employer is not generally liable for an employee\u2019s intentional torts because an employee who intentionally injures another individually is generally considered to be acting outside the scope of his or her employment.\u201d Ocana, 2004-NMSC-018, \u00b6 29, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58 (citing Martin-Martinez v. 6001, Inc., 1998-NMCA-179, \u00b6 13, 126 N.M. 319, 968 P.2d 1182 (\u201cIn most instances, the intentional conduct of an employee injuring another employee is not the intentional conduct of the employer.\u201d)). \u201cGenerally, whether an employee is acting in the course and scope of employment is a question of fact.\u201d Rivera v. N.M. Highway &amp; Transp. Dept., 115 N.M. 562, 564, 855 P.2d 136, 138 (Ct.App.1993) (citing Narney v. Daniels, 115 N.M. 41, 48, 846 P.2d 347, 354 (Ct.App.1992)). \u201cHowever, when no reasonable trier of fact could conclude that an employee is acting in the course and scope of employment,\u201d the conduct was not in the scope of employment as a matter of law. Rivera v. N.M. Highway and Transp. Dept., 115 N.M. at 564, 855 P.2d at 138 (citing Narney v. Daniels, 115 N.M. at 49-50, 846 P.2d at 355-56). New Mexico uses a four-part test to determine whether an employee\u2019s acts were performed within the scope of employment:\nAn employee\u2019s action, although unauthorized, is considered to be in the scope of employment if the action (1) is the kind the employee is employed to perform; (2) occurs during a period reasonably connected to the authorized employment period; (3) occurs in an area reasonably close to the authorized area; and (4) is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer.\nLessard v. Coronado Paint &amp; Decorating Ctr., Inc., 2007-NMCA-122, \u00b6 12, 142 N.M. 583, 168 P.3d 155 (citing Narney v. Daniels, 115 N.M. at 49, 846 P.2d at 355; Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 7.07(2) (2006)). The New Mexico Civil Uniform Jury Instruction on the scope of employment provides:\nAn act of an employee is within the scope of his or her employment if:\n1. It was something fairly and naturally incidental to the employer\u2019s business assigned to the employee, and\n2. It was done while the employee was engaged in the employer\u2019s business with the view of furthering the employer\u2019s interest and did not arise entirely from some external, independent and personal motive on the part of the employee.\nCiv. U.J.I. 13-407 N.M.R.A. See Childers v. S. Pac. Co., 20 N.M. 366, 372-73, 149 P. 307, 308 (1915) (same). The Supreme Court of New Mexico has also held that employers may sometimes be held liable fop torts an employee commits outside his or her scope of duty \u2014 including intentional torts \u2014 under an aided-in-agency theory of vicarious liability, which requires that the agent \u201cwas aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.\u201d Ocana, 2004-NMSC-018, \u00b6 30, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2)(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThe Court will deny the Motion and allow Pe\u00f1a\u2019s aided-in-agency theory of vicarious liability to proceed to trial. At trial, the Court will design a special verdict form, and, if the jury finds that Greffet committed battery against Pe\u00f1a, that Gref-fet\u2019s agency relationship with CCA imparted him with extraordinary power over her, and that this extraordinary power aided him in committing battery, then CCA will *1116be on the hook for all damages attributable to that tort.\nUnder Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938) (\u201cErie\u201d), when dealing with state-law torts like Pe\u00f1a\u2019s battery claim, the Court must apply vicarious liability principles as the Supreme Court of New Mexico would define them. Resolving the Motion largely boils down to formulating an Erie prediction about whether and how the Supreme Court of New Mexico would cabin the seemingly limitless vicarious liability that the aided-in-agency theory, read literally as the Restatement and Ocana announce it, would create. To formulate its Erie prediction, the Court will first outline the aided-in-agency theory\u2019s relatively sparse history, from its apparent birth in the Restatement (Second) of Agency in 1958, to the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019 incorporation of it into Title VII, through Ocana and other state-court precedent applying the theory, and finally to its demise in the Restatement (Third) of Agency. The Court will then predict how the Supreme Court of New Mexico would define the aided-in-agency theory\u2019s contours today, guided primarily, of course, by its words in Ocana, but also by policy factors that the Court concludes would influence the Supreme Court to narrow the doctrine from its broad articulation in Oca-na. Last, the Court will apply the aided-in-agency theory to this case\u2019s facts, concluding that Pe\u00f1a has plausibly alleged the theory, and that the vicarious liability issue must thus go to the jury.\nI. THE HISTORY OF AIDED-IN-AGENCY.\nTo shed light on the aided-in-agency theory\u2019s proper construction, the Court will first summarize its history. The Restatement (Second) of Agency created the theory, which was then adopted \u2014 in various ways \u2014 by a number of courts, including the Supreme Courts of the United States and New Mexico. The Restatement (Third) of Agency later disclaimed the theory entirely \u2014 albeit quietly \u2014 leaving its status as a creature of New Mexico common law somewhat uncertain.\nA. THE RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY CREATES THE THEORY.\nAlthough the Restatements, as their name suggests, are not really supposed to create new legal theories,4 the aided-in-*1117agency theory has its apparent genesis in the Restatement (Second) of Agency,5 in a section titled \u201cWhen Master is Liable for Torts of His Servants.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219. See Alan J. Oxford, II, When Agents Attack: Judicial Misinterpretation of Vicarious Liability Under \u201cAided in Accomplishing the Tort by the Existence of the Agency Relation\u201d and Restatement Srd\u2019s Failure to Properly \u201cRestate\u201d the Ill-Fated Section 219(2)(d) Provision, 37 Okla. City. U.L.Rev. 157, 170 (2012)(\u201cRestatement 2nd produced the Aided in Accomplishing language where such language did not previously exist in the common law.\u201d (footnotes omitted)). Section 219 outlines vicarious tort liability in the employer-employee context, generally; the concept of aided-in-agency is found in \u00a7 219(2)(d)\u2019s second independent clause:\n(1) A master is subject to liability for the torts of his servants committed while acting in the scope of their employment.\n(2) A master is not subject to liability for the torts of his servants acting outside the scope of their employment, unless:\n(a) the master intended the conduct ' or the consequences, or\n(b) the master was negligent or reckless, or\n(c) the conduct violated a non-delega-ble duty of the master, or\n(d)the servant purported to act or to speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance upon apparent authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.\nRestatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219 (emphasis added). Section 219\u2019s commentary contains a single paragraph devoted to \u00a7 219(2)(d); the first two sentences refer to apparent authority \u2014 i.e., \u00a7 219(2)(d)\u2019s first independent clause \u2014 and the remainder of the commentary refers to the aided-in-agency theory:\nClause (d) includes primarily situations in which the principal\u2019s liability is based upon conduct which is within the apparent authority of a servant, as where one purports to speak for his employer in defaming another or interfering with another\u2019s business. Apparent authority may also be the basis of an action of deceit, and even physical harm. In other situations [ \u2014 the following refers to the aided-in-agency theory \u2014 ] the servant may be able to cause harm because of his position as agent, as where a telegraph operator sends false messages purporting to come from third persons. Again, the manager of a store operated by him for an undisclosed principal is enabled to cheat the customers because of his position. The enumeration of such situations is not exhaustive, and is intended only to indicate the area within which a master may be subjected to *1118liability for acts of his servants not in scope of employment.\nRestatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219 cmt. on subsection (2) (citations omitted). It is interesting that the commentary calls apparent authority the \u201cprimary\u201d source of liability in \u00a7 219(2)(d), as the aided-in-agency theory, read to the full extent of its literal terms, would seem to create the possibility of vicarious liability in a wider array of situations. For one thing, it would seem that most torts committed with apparent authority would also be committed with the aid of the agency relationship, unless the apparent authority was incidental to the commission of tort.6\nAs an initial matter, the Court will point out the obvious defect in the aided-in-agency theory: it comes close to creating strict vicarious liability for employers, and, despite purporting to be an exception, it nearly swallows the general rule that re-spondeat superior does not attach to intentional torts. If \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2 were read literally, a creative plaintiffs lawyer could make a colorable argument for vicarious liability in almost every intentional tort case in which the tortfeasor happens to be gainfully employed. If a barista poisoned a patron\u2019s coffee, the patron could sue the coffee shop under the theory that the bar-ista was only able to commit the tort because he or she worked for the coffee shop. If a utility worker used his uniform and credentials to get invited into a woman\u2019s home, and then proceeded to sexually assault the woman, the utility worker\u2019s agency relationship with the utility company could be said to have aided him in his sexual assault. If a drive-by shooting was committed using a company car or a police department \u2014 or security company-issued gun, then the plaintiff could name the issuing employer. Most open-endedly of all, a plaintiff might even be able to name a tortfeasor\u2019s employer in a drive-by shooting, even if the employer issued neither the gun nor the car, if the tortfeasor bought the gun or the car using his or her salary \u2014 -which, after all, he or she obtained by virtue of the employment (i.e., agency) relationship.\nExamining transcripts of the committee meetings from the Restatement\u2019s drafting sessions is illuminating, but also ultimately fails to reveal any solid limiting principle that the drafters omitted from \u2014 or saw implicit in \u2014 the clause\u2019s text. One of the hypotheticals that the Court listed \u2014 -that of a utility worker using his badge to gain entry into a home and then raping the housewife \u2014 was discussed extensively at the drafting sessions. The Court gets the impression from reading the transcript that the drafters\u2019 consensus was that the aided-in-agency theory should not give rise to vicarious liability under that hypothetical\u2019s facts, ie., that the hypothetical was *1119introduced as a way of pointing out \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2\u2019s problematic expanse, as an example of facts that would fall within the clause\u2019s literal language, but which all agreed should not give rise to vicarious liability. See Discussion of Restatement of the Law, Second, Agency (Tentative Draft No. 4), 33 A.L.I. Proe. 314, 372-83 (1956)(\u201cA.L.I. Discussion\u201d). For example, the committee\u2019s presiding officer made the following statement:\nSection 219(2)(d) [should] be substituted by a narrower statement of actual cases, instead of saying that the servant is able to accomplish the tort whether it is rape or murder, if that is worse, or stealing silver, which I suppose is not so bad, but which look like transactions which a master would not normally be held liable for. Say \u201ccrimes.\u201d\nA.L.I. Discussion at 382 (emphasis added). This statement went unchallenged at the meeting, but was, for reasons unclear to the Court, never incorporated into the final Restatement \u2014 either in the above-the-line text or in the commentary.\nB.COURTS, INCLUDING THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, ADOPT THE THEORY IN VARIOUS FORMS AND CONTEXTS.\nIt seems obvious that the Restatement did not intend to open up virtually limitless vicarious liability by way of a short, unexplained, and uncited clause pinned \u2014 almost as an afterthought \u2014 to the end of a section devoted primarily to much theoretically narrower - grounds of vicarious liability. Courts struggled mightily with \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2,7 some applying it more-or-less as written, see, e.g., Costos v. Coconut Island Corp., 137 F.3d 46 (1st Cir.1998), others declining to adopt it altogether, see, e.g., Doe v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 106 F.3d 1223, 1226 (5th Cir.1997); Dee v. Marriott Int\u2019l, Inc., No. CIV.A. 99-2459, 1999 WL 975125, at *3-4 (E.D.Pa. Oct. 6, 1999); Zsigo v. Hurley Med. Ctr., 475 Mich. 215, 716 N.W.2d 220, 227 (2006); C.B. ex rel. L.B. v. Evangelical Lutheran Church in Am., 726 N.W.2d 127, 135 (Minn.Ct.App.2007) (limiting vicarious liability to torts committed within the scope of employment, but not explicitly mentioning the Restatement or disclaiming the aided-in-agency theory), and still others refraining from taking a position on either side of the aided-in-agency fence, see, e.g., Hart v. Paint Valley Local Sch. Dist., No. C2-01-004, 2002 WL 31951264, at *14 (S.D.Ohio Nov. 15, 2002); Davis v. Fulton Cnty., Ark., 884 F.Supp. 1245, 1263 (E.D.Ark.1995); Mahar v. StoneWood Transp., 823 A.2d 540, 545 (Me.2003); Bowman v. State, 10 A.D.3d 315, 781 N.Y.S.2d 103, 105 (2004); S.J.A.J. v. First Things First, Ltd., 239 Wis.2d 233, 619 N.W.2d 307, 2000 WL 1254149 *8 n. 15 (Wis.Ct.App.2000). Some courts modified the theory, narrowing it by grafting on various extra-textual limiting principles.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, for example, added an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d requirement to the aided-in-agency theory, relying on the telegraph-operator example in \u00a7 219\u2019s commentary to hold that \u201c[t]he tort must be one accomplished by an instrumentality, or through conduct[,] associated with the agency status.\u201d Barnes v. Costle, 561 F.2d 983, 996 (D.C.Cir.1977). The D.C. Circuit found no instrumentality in its case, but Costos v. Coconut Island Corp. provides a good example of a case that satisfies the requirement. In that case, the United States Court of Appeals *1120for the First Circuit held a hotel vicariously liable after one of its employees obtained an acquaintance\u2019s room key, entered her room, and raped her, concluding that the room key was an instrumentality of the agency.8 See 137 F.3d at 50. See also Zsigo v. Hurley Med. Ctr., 716 N.W.2d at 225.\nThe Supreme Court of the United States gave the aided-in-agency theory its most important application in twin companion cases that it issued on June 26, 1998, holding that the aided-in-agency theory \u2014 -narrowed significantly by limiting principles that the Supreme Court, by its own admission, made up on the spot9 \u2014 applies to Title VII workplace-harassment claims. See Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998) (Kennedy, J.); Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (Souter, J.). The opinions hinge heavily on Title VII-specific policy considerations, getting deep into the weeds of the administrative scheme and Congress\u2019 desire to encourage companies to adopt anti-harassment policies, but both opinions contain the same summarizing paragraph:\nAn employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any *1121preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. While proof that an employer had promulgated an antihar-assment policy with complaint procedure is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any case when litigating the first element of the 'defense. And while proof that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of reasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing any unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy the employer\u2019s burden under the second element of the defense. No affirmative defense is available, however, when the supervisor\u2019s harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment.\nBurlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 764-65, 118 S.Ct. 2257; Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. at 807-08, 118 S.Ct. 2275. In a nutshell, these decisions limit the aided-in-agency theory\u2019s applicability in two important ways: (i) the theory applies only to supervisors\u2019 acts against subordinates, and not to coworkers-on-coworker torts, see Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 760, 118 S.Ct. 2257 (\u201cWere [the theory interpreted more broadly], an employer would be subject to vicarious liability not only for all supervisor harassment, but also for all coworker harassment, a result enforced by neither the EEOC nor any court of appeals to have considered the issue.\u201d); (ii) vicarious liability is unrebuttable when the supervisor commits a \u201ctangible employment action\u201d \u2014 a firing, a passing-over for promotion, or an undesirable reassignment \u2014 but is subject to an affirmative defense when the supervisor simply makes the employee uncomfortable, because, where a tangible employment action exists, \u201cthere is assurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the agency relation,\u201d ie., a tangible employment action by a supervisor constitutes an \u201cofficial act\u201d by the employer, Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 761, 762, 118 S.Ct. 2257 (\u201cTangible employment actions are the means by which the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates. A tangible employment decision requires an official act of the enterprise, a company act.\u201d).\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s cases are as much about modifying general agency principles for use in the Title VII context as they are about doing a descriptive, retrospective analysis of the common law of agency. They did not necessarily alter what aided-in-agency means, but, rather, set forth the manner in which the aided-in-agency theory should apply in the Title VII context. See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. at 802 &amp; n. 3, 118 S.Ct. 2275 (calling \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2 a \u201c \u2018starting point[,]\u2019 because [the Supreme Court\u2019s] obligation here is not to make a pronouncement of agency law in general or to transplant \u00a7 219(2)(d) into Title VTI[; r]ather, it is to adapt agency concepts to the practical objectives of Title VII\u201d). For instance, district judges in the D.C. Circuit continue to apply an instrumentality limitation on the aided-in-agency theory, despite the fact that neither Supreme Court case used the term. See Doe v. Sipper, 821 F.Supp.2d 384, 391-93 (D.D.C.2011).\nC. THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW MEXICO ADOPTS THE THEORY.\nIt is at this point, roughly six years after the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019 twin cases, that the Supreme Court of New Mexico issued Ocana. Ocana was the first, and last, case from any New *1122Mexico court10 to mention the aided-in-agency theory \u2014 or \u00a7 219(2), more generally. Like the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019 cases, Ocana involved an employment-discrimination case, this time under the New Mexico Human Rights Act, N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-1-1 to -15 (\u201cNMHRA\u201d), New Mexico\u2019s state-law analogue to the federal Title VII. See Ocana, 2004-NMSC-018, \u00b6 6, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that her supervisor had harassed her continually and severely at the workplace, following her around the store, including into the restroom, touching himself in front of her, and, on one occasion, rubbing his erection against her. See Ocana, 2004-NMSC-018, \u00b6 25, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58. She sued both her supervisor and her employer under the NMHRA, and for state-law assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. See Ocana, 2004-NMSC-018, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 29, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58. On the NMHRA claim, the Supreme Court of New Mexico adopted the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019 Title VII framework from Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth and Faragher v. City of Boca Raton wholesale. See 2004-NMSC-018, \u00b6 26, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58. For the state-law claims, however, the Supreme Court of New Mexico went through the following analysis:\nUnder basic respondeat superior principles, an employer is liable for an employee\u2019s torts committed within the scope of his or her employment. Thus, under these principles, an employer is not generally liable for an employee\u2019s intentional torts because an employee who intentionally injures another individual is generally considered to be acting outside the scope of his or her employment. Intentional torts arising from sexual harassment are generally considered to be outside the scope of employment. Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 757, 118 S.Ct. 2257 (\u201cThe general rule is that sexual harassment by a supervisor is not conduct within the scope of employment.\u201d). Cf. Coates v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 1999\u2014 NMSC-013, \u00b6 25, 127 N.M. 47, 976 P.2d 999, 1004 (\u201cInjuries caused by sexual harassment do not arise out of employment.\u201d). Conceding that Kaminski\u2019s alleged torts were committed outside the scope of his employment, Ocana asserts that American may be vicariously liable under the aided-in-agency theory because there was evidence showing that the torts were facilitated by his supervisory status.\nUnder the aided-in-agency theory, an employer may be held liable for the intentional torts of an employee acting outside the scope of his or her employment if the employee \u201cwas aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219(2)(d) (1958). As the parties acknowledge, no New Mexico court has yet adopted the aided-in-agency theory in addressing respondeat superior issues. Ocana asserts that we should adopt this theory because our courts have relied upon other sections of the Restatement in determining the scope of an employer\u2019s liability. She also asserts that it would be consistent with New Mexico\u2019s public policy favoring compensation to a victim injured by another\u2019s tortious actions. American, on the other hand, asserts that this theory should not be adopted because our courts have already developed a comprehensive and extensive \u201cbody of law which defines scope of employment.\u201d *1123Consequently, American argues that these cases more aptly apply to the case at hand because they address \u201cscope of employment\u201d in the context of sexual harassment and assault. As a result of the parties\u2019 arguments, we discuss whether we should adopt the aided-in-agency theory in the context of sexual harassment.\nWe do not believe that it would be a radical departure for this Court to adopt the aided-in-agency theory of vicarious liability. New Mexico courts have routinely relied upon the Restatement (Second) of Agency in discussing issues of respondeat superior. Additionally, adopting the aided-in-agency theory would further the policies that underlie tort law. See Trujillo v. City of Albuquerque, 1990-NMSC-083, \u00b6 10, 110 N.M. 621, 798 P.2d 571, 574 (\u201cOur fault system of recovery, while by no means indispensable to our society in an abstract sense, today serves the important social functions of redistributing the economic burden of loss from the injured individuals on whom it originally fell, deterring conduct that society regards as unreasonable or immoral, and providing a vehicle by which injured victims may obtain some degree of compensation and satisfaction for wrongs committed against them and by which society may give voice and form to its condemnation of the wrongdoer.\u201d (footnote omitted)), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 1998-NMSC-031, 125 N.M. 721, 965 P.2d 305.\nConsequently, the question that we must decide is whether Ocana presented sufficient evidence showing that Kamin-ski was aided by his status as her supervisor in committing his alleged torts. We conclude that she did not. In order to prevail under the aided-in-agency theory, Ocana had to present sufficient evidence showing that Kaminski\u2019s supervisory authority aided him in the commission of his torts. Employees with such authority have been empowered by the employer to make decisions affecting subordinate employees. It is this authority, bestowed by the employer, that gives the supervising employee the ability to injure the subordinate employee. In this sense, the supervising employee is \u201caided-in-agency.\u201d See Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219(2)(d) cmt. e (explaining that the basis for the aided-in-agency theory is that the employee \u201cmay be able to cause harm because of his [or her] position as agent \u201d of the employer (emphasis added)). Here, Ocana failed to present any evidence showing that Kaminski\u2019s conduct occurred as a result of an abuse of his supervisory status. Since there is no evidence showing that Kaminski was able to commit his alleged acts by virtue of his supervisor status, summary judgment on this claim was proper.\nOcana, 2Q04-NMSC-018, \u00b6\u00b6 29-32, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court appended a footnote to the very end of its aided-in-agency spiel:\nWe note that Ell&amp;rth and Faragher relied, in part, on the aided-in-agency theory of the Restatement in crafting their holdings. Both c\u00e1ses, however, expressly did not adopt the approach wholesale, but instead modified it to fit within the Title VII context. See Faragher, 524 U.S. at 802 n. 3, 118 S.Ct. 2275; Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 755, 118 S.Ct. 2257 (calling the Restatement \u201ca useful beginning point for a discussion of general agency principles,\u201d but going on to modify the doctrine to effectuate the policy goals of Title VII). Because the Supreme Court modified, rather than adopted, the Restatement approach in Ellerth and Faragher, we see nothing inconsistent with the result reached in this section, which relies on the Restate*1124ment, and the result reached in Section II, which relies on Ellerth and Faragher.\nOcana, 2004-NMSC-018, \u00b632 n. 1, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58 (emphasis in original). The above portions outline the Supreme Court of New Mexico\u2019s adoption of the aided-in-agency theory in the non-NMHRA context. The last above-the-line paragraph makes it clear that the Supreme Court of New Mexico retained an important limitation on the theory from the Title VII context: the tortfeasor must be the plaintiffs supervisor, and not merely a coworker, for the employer to be held vicariously liable. See Ocana, 2004-NMSC-018, \u00b6 32,135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58. The Supreme Court affirmed the summary judgment that the district court had granted in the employer\u2019s favor, because the plaintiff was unable to show that her supervisor \u201cwas able to commit his alleged acts by virtue of his supervisor status\u201d\u2014 not his agency status. 2004-NMSC-018, \u00b6 32, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58 (emphasis added). Swapping out \u201cagency relation,\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2, with \u201csupervisor status,\u201d Ocana, 2004-NMSC-018, \u00b632, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58, narrows the aided-in-agency theory\u2019s reach substantially. The supervisor in Ocana was probably \u2014 or at least plausibly \u2014 aided by his agency relationship with the employer, as he would likely have been unable to stalk the plaintiff at her workplace if he did not also work there. The Supreme Court of New Mexico, however, wanted more: the tort cannot be of a nature that a mere coworker could have just as easily committed; rather, a specifically supervisory relationship must have aided the tort\u2019s commission.\nA more obvious takeaway from Ocana is nonetheless vitally important. The Supreme Court of New Mexico recognized the aided-in-agency theory as standing distinct, separate, and independent from apparent authority. In an effort to limit the theory\u2019s potentially limitless font of vicarious liability, many courts flirted with the notion of conflating aided-in-agency, see Restatement (Second) of Agency ' \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2, with apparent authority, see id. \u00a7 129(2)(d) cl. 1, or of construing the concept of being aided in agency as a limitation on vicarious liability by way of apparent authority, despite the illogie of reading two independent clauses separated by an \u201cor\u201d as being cumulative requirements.11 See, e.g., Mahar v. StoneWood Transp., 823 A.2d at 546 (\u201cComment e to section 219(2)(d) acknowledges that the section is limited in its application to cases within the apparent authority of the employee, or when the employee\u2019s conduct involves misrepresentation or deceit.\u201d).\n*1125D. OTHER STATE SUPREME COURTS APPLY THE THEORY TO TORTS THAT A POLICE OFFICER COMMITS AGAINST A CITIZEN.\nIn 2004, around the same time that the Supreme Court of New Mexico was deciding Ocana, the Vermont Supreme Court applied the aided-in-agency theory in a context very close to the one that this case presents. In Doe v. Forrest, 2004-VT-37, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48 (2004), the court held a sheriffs department vicariously liable for one of its deputies sexually assaulting a citizen. The deputy in question regularly visited a convenience store as part of his community policing function, and, over time, struck up a familiar relationship with the plaintiff, a twenty-year-old cashier at the store. See 2004-VT-37, \u00b6 2, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48. In the weeks preceding the sexual assault, the deputy\u2019s visits to the store \u201cincreased in frequency and duration, as he apparently became more personally interested in\u201d the plaintiff. 2004-VT-37, \u00b6 2, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48. The court described the events on the date of the sexual assault as follows:\nWhen Forrest entered the store, plaintiff was on the telephone with her mother while attending to customers at the check-out counter. After those customers left the store, he took the telephone from plaintiff and jokingly told her mother, who was also an employee of the store, to stop harassing plaintiff. Forrest then hung up the telephone and began asking plaintiff questions that were sexual in nature. He turned the store\u2019s thermostat to ninety degrees and informed her that he had done so. As she was readjusting the thermostat, he took hold of her hair, which was in a ponytail, and used it to move her head in various directions. He told her that he liked women who wore their hair in a ponytail so that he could control them. He then put his arm around plaintiff, who said nothing, but moved away from him and returned to the check-out counter.\nForrest then selected an adult magazine from the store\u2019s magazine rack and showed plaintiff a picture of a woman performing fellatio. After a short conversation pertaining to the sexual act depicted in the magazine, he began to maneuver her into a secluded area of the store, where he coerced her to perform oral sex. He also kissed and fondled her breasts. After approximately fifteen minutes, she moved away from Forrest, who departed soon thereafter. She then telephoned for help. Forrest did not during the sexual assault unhol-ster his weapon or handcuffs, nor did he threaten to use either instrument on plaintiff.\n2004-VT-37, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48. In the wake of the incident, the deputy resigned from the department, and later pled guilty to a criminal charge of lewd and lascivious behavior, 13 Vt. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2601. See 2004-VT-37, \u00b6 5, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48.\nThe plaintiff sued the department alleging several theories of vicarious liability. After concluding that the department could not be held directly liable, and that the deputy\u2019s actions had been outside the scope of his employment, the court analyzed the actions under the aided-in-agency theory, ultimately \u201cholding] that if plaintiff can show that an on-duty law enforcement officer was aided in accomplishing an intentional tort involving a sexual assault on the plaintiff by the existence of the employment relationship with the law enforcement agency, vicarious liability will apply.\u201d 2004-VT-37, \u00b6 48,176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48. In doing so, the Vermont Supreme Court relied upon similar holdings \u2014 both articulated much less robustly than in Doe v. Forrest \u2014 by the Supreme *1126Court of California, see Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles, 54 Cal.3d 202, 285 Cal.Rptr. 99, 814 P.2d 1341 (1991) (en banc), and the Court of Appeals of Louisiana, see Applewhite v. City of Baton Rouge, 380 So.2d 119 (La.Ct.App.1979). See Doe v. Forrest, 2004-VT-37, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48. The Vermont Supreme Court reasoned:\nThe Court in Faragher was very-careful to analyze the policy judgments behind \u00a7 219(2)(d) and apply it to implement those policies. We similarly examine some of those policy issues in the context of an intentional sexual tort of a law enforcement officer perpetrated on a community citizen the officer was charged to protect as part of his community policing function. The Far-agher Court emphasized three main considerations in applying \u00a7 219(2)(d) in the supervisor-employee relationship: the opportunity for contact created by the relationship; the powerlessness of the employee to resist the supervisor and prevent the unwanted contact; and the opportunity to prevent and guard against the conduct.\nWhat makes the circumstances of this case virtually unique from a policy perspective is the extraordinary power that a law enforcement officer has over a citizen. A number of courts have talked about this power in finding vicarious liability in cases involving sexual assaults by police officers. See, e.g., Applewhite v. City of Baton Rouge, 380 So.2d 119, 121 (La.Ct.App.1979); Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles, 54 Cal.3d 202, 285 Cal.Rptr. 99, 814 P.2d 1341, 1349-52 (1991) (en banc).\nMary M. is explicitly policy-based and contains this rationale as part of the holding:\nAt the outset, we observed that society has granted police officers extraordinary power and authority over its citizenry. An officer who detains an individual is acting as the official representative .of the state, with all of its coercive power. As visible symbols of that power, an officer is given a distinctively marked car, a uniform, a badge,' and a gun. As one court commented, \u201cpolice officers [exercise] the most awesome and dangerous power that a democratic state possesses with respect to its residents \u2014 the power to use lawful force to arrest and detain them.\u201d Inherent in this formidable power is the potential for abuse; The cost resulting from misuse of that power should be borne by the community, because of the substantial benefits that the community derives from the lawful exercise of police power.\nMary M. v. City of Los Angeles, 285 Cal.Rptr. 99, 814 P.2d at 1349. Applewhite has a similar rationale, although related to the traditional rationale of apparent authority:\nWe particularly note that Officer Crowe was on duty in uniform and armed, and was operating a police unit at the time of this incident. He was able to separate the plaintiff from her companions because of the force and authority of the position which he held. He took her into police custody and then committed the sexual abuse upon her in the vehicle provided for his use by his employer.\nA police officer is a public servant given considerable public trust and authority. Our review of the jurisprudence indicates that, almost uniformly, where excesses are committed by such officers, their employers are held to be responsible for their actions even though those actions may be somewhat removed from their usual duties. This is unquestionably the case because of the position of such officers in our society.\n*1127Applewhite v. City of Baton Rouge, 380 So.2d at 121.\nThis power is especially pronounced when the tort is committed on a citizen the law enforcement officer is charged with protecting. The Faragher Court noted the particular power of an employment supervisor'who could inflict adverse employment actions on a resistant employee. Not only is the supervisor placed in the position to sexually harass the employee, but the fear of retaliation prevents the employee from resisting or complaining. In like manner, when the law enforcement officer is the wrongdoer, the citizen is also stripped of the official protection that society provides. The citizen is particularly vulnerable and defenseless.\nFinally, Faragher relied on the greater opportunity that employers had to \u201cguard against misconduct' by supervisors ...; employers have greater opportunity and incentive to screen them, train them, and monitor their performance.\u201d 524 U.S. at 803, 118 S.Ct. 2275. As the California Supreme Court noted in Mary M., 285 Cal.Rptr. 99, 814 P.2d at 1347, imposing liability on the employer may prevent recurrence of tor-tious conduct by creating an incentive for vigilance by those in a position to prevent it.[12] No incentive to prevent this kind of conduct is created by leaving the victim uncompensated. Nor do we think we create an adequate incentive by requiring a plaintiff to prove that the employer inadequately supervised the officer. See West v. Waymire, 114 F.3d [646] at 649 [ (7th Cir.1997) ] (\u201cWe want the police department to supervise its officers in this domain with especial care, and so we do not impose on the plaintiff the burden of establishing negligent supervision.\u201d). We also note the observation of the court in Mary M. that the costs of police misconduct should be borne by the community because the community derives substantial benefits from the lawful exercise of police power.\nDoe v. Forrest, 2004-VT-37, \u00b6\u00b6 33-36, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48 (citations omitted); id. \u00b6 39, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48. The Vermont Supreme Court decided not to extend its holding, at that time, beyond the context of on-duty law enforcement officers, noting that the Supreme Court of California had, in a decision issued years before Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles, declined to extend the aided-in-agency theory of liability to torts that a schoolteacher commits against his or her students. See 2004-VT-37, \u00b6 47, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48 (citing John R. v. Oakland Unified Sch. Dist., 48 Cal.3d 438, 256 Cal.Rptr. 766, 769 P.2d 948, 956-57 (1989))(\u201c[W]e find it best to adopt a rationale as narrow as possible under the circumstances.\u201d).\nThe Vermont Supreme Court ultimately decided that the plaintiff could submit her vicarious liability argument to the jury, reversing the lower court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of the department. See 2004-VT-37, \u00b6\u00b6 56-58, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48. Although the deputy never threatened her, the court concluded that \u201cthe extent to which Forrest\u2019s position as a law enforcement officer, with the gun and handcuffs, enabled him to force or persuade plaintiff to perform fellatio on him without significant physical resistance or cries for help is disputed,\u201d and must go to the jury. 2004-VT-37, \u00b6 56, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48.\n*1128The Vermont Supreme Court\u2019s decision was issued over a strenuous dissent by the Honorable Marilyn S. Skoglund, Associate Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court, who argued that the majority \u201cfundamentally misinterpreted the second clause [of \u00a7 219(2)(d) ] as completely independent of the first, and that properly understood it applies only where the agent \u2018purported to act or speak on behalf of the principal and he was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relationship.\u2019 \u201d Doe v. Forrest, 2004-VT-37, \u00b6 66, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48 (Skoglund, J., dissenting(emphasis added) (citation omitted). She further posited that the Supreme Court of the United States \u201cnever intended for its decisions in Faragher and El-lerth to have any influence on the development of common-law agency principles or the application of \u00a7 219(2)(d) outside the specific context of Title VII,\u201d 2004-VT-37, \u00b6 68, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48, noting that the Supreme Court of the United States had, itself, stated that \u201cits intention was not \u2018to make a pronouncement of agency law in general,\u2019 but rather \u2018to adapt agency concepts to the practical objectives of Title VII,\u2019 \u201d 2004-VT-37, \u00b6 65, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48 (quoting Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. at 802 n. 3, 118 S.Ct. 2275).\nIn 2007,13 the Vermont Supreme Court issued another case involving the aided-in-agency theory, Doe v. Newbury Bible Church, 2007-VT-72, 182 Vt. 174, 933 A.2d 196 (2007). Justice Skoglund, the dissenter in Doe v. Forrest, wrote the majority opinion. The case involved a pastor\u2019s criminal sexual abuse of an underage parishioner, who then attempted to sue the church under an aided-in-agency theory. See 2007-VT-72, \u00b6\u00b6 1-5, 182 Vt. 174, 933 A.2d 196. Several instances of abuse had occurred on church property, or at times when the pastor was alone with the parishioner by virtue of his pastoral relationship with the youth, and thus the case would seem to fit within \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2\u2019s literal terms. See 2007-VT-72, \u00b6 3, 182 Vt. 174, 933 A.2d 196. The Vermont Supreme Court nevertheless held that the church could not be held vicariously liable for the pastor\u2019s actions, distinguishing Doe v. Forrest as follows:\nThe circumstances of the tort in this case distinguish it from Forrest in several crucial ways. First, a pastor is not a public actor, and therefore, the policy reasons for extending the cost of police misconduct to the general public are not present. As a society, we give police officers power beyond that of all other citizens so that they may better protect us. A pastor, by contrast, is vested with no more power than any other person who takes a leadership role in an organization. Although a pastor\u2019s leadership serves the needs of his church, holding the church responsible for his abuse of that power does nothing to deter future abuses: in this case the church removed [the pastor] from his position before the lawsuit against it was filed. Vicarious liability merely penalizes innocent church members for conduct in which they took no part, of which they had no knowledge, and from which they gained no benefit.\nSecond, although a pastor\u2019s position within the church gives him some authority or power over parishioners, especially children who attend a church school, that power is simply not the same as police power. A pastor\u2019s influence over a, child is little different from *1129the authority exerted by other adult figures in a child\u2019s life.\nFinally, in Forrest we relied upon the unique access, as well as the special power, that police officers have over citizens. Importantly, when a pastor or other person in a position of authority commits a criminal and tortious act, the victim can turn to the police for help, but when a law enforcement officer is the perpetrator, the victim is uniquely isolated from the protections of the rule of law. In Forrest, we refused to make broad pronouncements about future cases. Instead, we limited our application of \u00a7 219(2)(d) to the facts before us at that time. Today, we once again limit our holding to the facts before us. We continue to rely on California\u2019s guidance in this area because it is one of the few states that has developed a body of case law applying \u00a7 219(2)(d). In John R., the California Supreme Court declined to hold a school district vicariously liable for a teacher\u2019s molestation of a student while participating in a school-sponsored extracurricular program. In its decision, the court noted the significant distinction between law enforcement officers and teachers:\nIt suffices here to note that the authority of a police officer over a motorist \u2014 bolstered most immediately by his uniform, badge and firearm, and only slightly less so by the prospect of criminal sanctions for disobedience\u2014 plainly surpasses that of a teacher over a student. The teacher\u2019s authority is different in both degree and kind, and it is simply not great enough to persuade us that vicarious liability should attach here for the teacher\u2019s tort. Furthermore, invoking respon-deat superior here would raise an entirely different specter of untoward consequences, or interference with the purposes for which the authority was conferred in the first place, than might result from the imposition of vicarious liability in the limited context of a police officer\u2019s abuse of authority. We doubt that police departments would deprive their officers of weapons or preclude them from enforcing the laws, but we see a significant and unacceptable risk that school districts would be dissuaded from permitting teachers to interact with then-students on any but the most formal and supervised basis.\nJohn R. v. Oakland Unified Sch. Dist., 256 Cal.Rptr. 766, 769 P.2d at 956-57. The court emphasized that school districts would still be liable for their own negligence in hiring or supervising a teacher who molests students.\nPrincipled distinctions can be drawn between law enforcement officers and others in positions of authority. Holding a small church and school vicariously liable for the acts of its pastor \u2014 without any regard to fault \u2014 would in no way further the policy considerations set forth in Forrest or the Title VII cases relied upon therein.\nDoe v. Newbury Bible Church, 2007-VT-72, \u00b6\u00b6 9-13, 182 Vt. 174, 933 A.2d 196 (citations omitted).\nE. THE RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY ABANDONS THE THEORY.\nIn 2006, the American Law Institute published the Restatement (Third) of Agency, obliterating all above-the-line references to the aided-in-agency theory. The closest analogue to the Second Restatement\u2019s, \u00a7 219 is the Third Restatement\u2019s \u00a7 7.03, which serves as the new master summary section14 setting forth *1130the circumstances in which a principal can be held liable for his or her agent\u2019s torts:\n(1) A principal is subject to direct liability to a third party harmed by an agent\u2019s conduct when\n(a) as stated in \u00a7 7.04, the agent acts with actual authority or the principal ratifies the agent\u2019s conduct and\n(i) the agent\u2019s conduct is tortious, or\n(ii) the agent\u2019s conduct, if that of the principal, would subject the principal to tort liability; or\n(b) as stated in \u00a7 7.05, the principal is negligent in selecting, supervising, or otherwise controlling the agent; or\n(c) as stated in \u00a7 7.06, the principal delegates performance of a duty to use care to protect other persons or their property to an agent who fails to perform the duty.\n(2) A principal is subject to vicarious liability to a third party harmed by an agent\u2019s conduct when\n(a) as stated in \u00a7 7.07, the agent is an employee who commits a tort while acting within the scope of employment; or\n(b) as stated in \u00a7 7.08, the agent commits a tort when acting with apparent authority in dealing with a third party on or purportedly on behalf of the principal.\nRestatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 7.03 (2006).\nThe Third Restatement\u2019s only reference to the aided-in-agency theory comes in the commentary to \u00a7 7.08, the new section devoted to apparent authority. See Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 7.08 cmt. b. Section 7.08\u2019s above-the-line text provides that \u201c[a] principal is subject to vicarious liability for a tort committed by an agent in dealing or communicating with a third party on or purportedly on behalf of the principal when actions taken by the agent with apparent authority constitute the tort or enable the agent to conceal its commission,\u201d Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 7.08, and its commentary explains:\nThis rule differs from the counterpart material in Restatement Second, Agency, in two respects. First, much of the treatment in Restatement Second, Agency, is structured on a tort-specific basis. Second, Restatement Second, Agency \u00a7 219(2)(d) states that an employer is subject to liability for an employee\u2019s tort when the employee acted outside the scope of employment when \u201cthe servant purported to act or to speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance upon apparent authority ...\u201d Section 219(2)(d) concludes with a further general basis for an employer\u2019s vicarious liability, which is whether an employee \u201cwas aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.\u201d This Restatement does not include \u201caided in accomplishing\u201d as a distinct basis for an employer\u2019s (or principal\u2019s) vicarious liability. The purposes likely intended to be met by the \u201caided in ac*1131complishing\u201d basis are satisfied by a more fully elaborated treatment of apparent authority and by the duty of reasonable care that a principal owes to third parties with whom it interacts through employees and other agents.\nRestatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 7.08 cmt. b (omission in original).\nThe Third Restatement\u2019s dismissive treatment of the aided-in-agency theory raises questions as to whether courts were ever correct to apply it, and, even if so, whether they should continue to apply it\u2014 given that the theory was a whole-cloth creation of an earlier Restatement \u2014 -in contexts beyond those in which controlling authority mandates its application, e.g., Title VIL15\nII. THE COURT\u2019S ERIE PREDICTION.\nThe Court concludes that the Supreme Court of New Mexico, having adopted the aided-in-agency theory in Ocana, would go at least as far as the Supreme Courts of California and Vermont in construing it. The Supreme Court of New Mexico 'is unabashedly liberal on civil-rights and civil-liberties issues, see, e.g., State v. Cardenas-Alvarez, 2001-NMSC-017, \u00b6\u00b6 32-35, 130 N.M. 386, 25 P.3d 225, 237-40 (discussing the court\u2019s embrace of \u201cNew Federalism,\u201d a doctrine of state-level expansion on federal constitutional rights, which the Honorable William J. Brennan, Jr., Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, championed), and the Court is relatively confident about how it would balance its people\u2019s liberty interests \u2014 specifically, their interest in being free from rape at the hands of their state-sanctioned captore \u2014 against its contractors\u2019 economic interests. The Court concludes that the policy rationales for imposing vicarious liability under the aided-in-agency theory in the police officer-citizen context are as strong as \u2014 if not stronger than \u2014 they are in the prison guard-inmate context, and, accordingly, the Supreme Court of New Mexico would probably apply the theory in this context. The Court can thus sum up its Erie prediction as follows: if an inmate can establish that a prison official with corporal authority over the inmate committed a tort against the inmate, and that the official\u2019s position of authority aided the official in the commission of that tort, then the official\u2019s employer16 is vicariously liable for all injuries that the tort inflicts.\nThe Court will describe the reasoning behind its Erie prediction, beginning with *1132Ocana itself, then moving to available limiting principles that make the theory workable and the policy rationales that make it sensible, and then discussing how the theory is consistent with the State of New Mexico\u2019s current civil-rights and immunity regimes. Last, the Court will explain why it is unpersuaded that the Third Restatement\u2019s jettisoning of the theory should change its prediction.\nA. OCANA UNAMBIGUOUSLY ADOPTED \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2.\nJust as a court engaging in statutory interpretation must always begin with a statute\u2019s text, a court formulating an Erie prediction should look first to the words of the state supreme court.17 In Ocana, the. Supreme Court of New Mexico not only \u2022 adopted \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2, but it clearly indicated that the theory: (i) applies to both the NMHRA \u2014 -in the same way that it applies to Title VII \u2014 and to common-law torts; and (ii) is not merely a reformulation of or limitation on apparent authority. In doing so, the Supreme Court of New Mexico foreclosed two of the most narrowing, most obvious, and most popular manners of cabining the theory. What re*1133mains is a theory that \u2014 by its own terms and by the terms in which Ocana described it \u2014 imposes liability on prison guards who use their state-imparted authority to engage in tortious conduct against inmates. What makes this case challenging is that the theory, without further limitation, opens up vicarious liability in host of other situations \u2014 such as the coffee-poisoning barista, the housewife-raping utility worker, and the company car-using drive-by shooter \u2014 in which it seems undesirable, if not, in some circumstances, absurd. Cf. EEOC v. Genesco, Inc., 2011 WL 2490634, at *4 (\u201cThe \u2018aided-in-agency\u2019 exception should not swallow the rule of limited respondeat superior liability for intentional torts.\u201d).\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s adoption of the theory into New Mexico common law comes in two paragraphs near the end of Ocana, and contains no explicit limiting principles:\nUnder the aided-in-agency theory, an employer may be held liable for the intentional torts of an employee acting outside the scope of his or her employment if the employee \u201cwas aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 219(2)(d) (1958). As the parties acknowledge, no New Mexico court has yet adopted the aided-in-agency theory in addressing respondeat superior issues. Ocana asserts that we should adopt this theory because our courts have relied upon other sections of the Restatement in determining the scope of an employer\u2019s liability. She also asserts that it would be consistent with New Mexico\u2019s public policy favoring compensation to a victim injured by another\u2019s tortious actions.... As a result of the parties\u2019 arguments, we discuss whether we should adopt the aided-in-agency theory in the context of sexual harassment.\nWe do not believe that it would be a radical departure for this Court to adopt the aided-in-agency theory of vicarious liability. New Mexico courts have routinely relied upon the Restatement (Second) of Agency in discussing issues of respondeat superior. Additionally, adopting the aided-in-agency theory would further the policies that underlie tort law.\nConsequently, the question that we must decide is whether Ocana presented sufficient evidence showing that Kamin-ski was aided by his status as her supervisor in committing his alleged torts.\nOcana, 2004-NMSC-018, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58. See id. \u00b632 n. 1, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58. (\u201c[T]he result reached in this section ... relies on the Restatement.\u201d). Despite seemingly adopting the Restatement wholesale, in the lead-up to its analysis, the Supreme Court of New Mexico made the following statement: \u201cAs a result of the parties\u2019 arguments, we discuss whether we should adopt the aided-in-agency theory in the context of sexual harassment.\u201d Ocana, 2004-NMSC-018, \u00b6 30, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58 (emphasis added). The question, then, is whether the Supreme Court intended to limit the theory\u2019s application to the employment context. No such limitation exists under a natural reading of Ocana, but, reading the case to the full extent of its terms \u2014 and applying it outside the employment context \u2014 there would be nothing to stop the parade of horribles to which the Court has alluded throughout this opinion.\nThere are, however, a number of limiting principles \u2014 short of limiting the theory to the employment context \u2014 that the Supreme Court of New Mexico can graft onto Ocana to avoid these results and prevent the aided-in-agency theory from becoming strict vicarious liability. The Court will discuss how it believes that the Supreme *1134Court will reign in the theory. First, however, the Court will again point out the obvious, which \u2014 given the importance of beginning an Erie prediction with the Supreme Court\u2019s own precedent \u2014 bears repeating: Ocana adopted the aided-in-agency theory, and the opinion\u2019s language does not limit it to the employment context.\nB. SUFFICIENT LIMITING PRINCIPLES EXIST TO MAKE THE THEORY WORKABLE OUTSIDE THE EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT, AND, APPROPRIATELY LIMITED, THE THEORY MAKES SENSE.\nAs a federal court, the Court cannot impose limiting principles on New Mexico common-law rules. The Court can, however, predict limiting principles that the Supreme Court of New Mexico might impose, and, if those limiting principles would render the rule more attractive, then they can influence the Court\u2019s prediction whether the Supreme Court would adopt the rule in the first place. Here, the question is not whether the Supreme Court would adopt the aided-in-agency theory \u2014 it already has \u2014 but whether it would extend it outside of the employment context. To put the Court\u2019s overall analysis in simpler terms: (i) Ocana appears to adopt the aided-in-agency theory without qualification; (ii) adopting the aided-in-agency theory without qualification would produce absurd results, and it thus seems improbable that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would not qualify the theory if faced with its consequences; (iii) the Court must decide, then, how the Supreme Court would qualify the theory; (iv) one way the Supreme Court could qualify the theory\u2014 which, while not the most natural reading of Ocana, could be reconciled with the ease \u2014 is by limiting the theory to the employment context; and (v) the Court must determine whether the Supreme Court would limit the theory in that manner or if it would use other limiting principles, such as those that the Supreme Courts of California and Vermont used.\nThe Court concludes that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would not limit the aided-in-agency theory\u2019s application to the employment context, but, rather, would do as the Supreme Courts of California and Vermont have done, and apply it outside the employment context in cases where the tortfeasor\u2019s relationship with his employer gives him \u201cextraordinary power\u201d over his victim. Doe v. Forrest, 2004-VT-37, \u00b6 34, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48 (\u201cWhat makes the circumstances of this case virtually unique from a policy perspective is the extraordinary power that a law enforcement officer has over a citizen.\u201d). Extending the aided-in-agency theory\u2019s reach to these cases- \u2014 which include prison guard-inmate and police officer-citizen cases \u2014 carries forward the same rationale that Ocana and the Supreme Court of the United States used to justify applying the theory to supervisor-subordinate torts: the employer created the opportunity for the tort by giving the tortfeasor power over the victim. See Ocana, 2004-NMSC-018, \u00b632, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58 (\u201cIt is this authority, bestowed by the employer, that gives the supervising employee the ability to injure the subordinate employee. In this sense, the supervising employee is \u2018aided-in-agency.\u2019 \u201d). A prison guard has even more employer-vested power over an inmate than a private-sector supervisor has over a subordinate: the control that a prison guard exerts over an inmate extends into virtually every facet of the inmate\u2019s life; the relationship, unlike a private-sector supervisor-subordinate relationship, often involves the use of legitimate bodily force and physical violence; and, unlike a private-sector employee, an inmate cannot simply quit the job of being a prisoner.\n*1135Extending the aided-in-agency theory to \u201cextraordinary power\u201d cases honors Oca-na\u2019s reasoning, but so does stopping its reach at that point. By limiting the theory there, the Court excludes the more undesirable theoretical consequences of a literal, unchecked reading of \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2, such as imposing vicarious liability in the cases of the coffee-poisoning barista, the housewife-raping utility worker, and 'the company car-driving shooter. Requiring a relationship of job-created control between a tortfeasor, and his or her victim, holds the employer liable only when the tortfea-sor has capitalized on the power that the employer gave the tortfeasor, and not merely the opportunity. Opportunity is generic: a factory worker who sexually assaults the coworker next to him on the assembly line might only have been able to do so because the factory stationed him next to his victim, but the factory did not increase the odds \u2014 at least as they were knowable to the employer at the time \u2014 of either that specific worker committing sexual assault or of that specific coworker being sexually assaulted. On the other hand, when an employer vests an employee with power over another person\u2014 whether the other person is a subordinate employee or a non-employee third party, like an inmate \u2014 the employer enables torts that might not otherwise happen \u2014 torts, that are, essentially, an abuse of that power. There is danger inherent in granting one person extraordinary power over another, and the granting of that power should, thus, carry with it some accountability.\nThere are additional policy reasons for applying the aided-in-agency theory to prison guard-inmate torts, most of which the Vermont Supreme Court canvassed in Doe v. Forrest. The Court will not rehash that case\u2019s reasoning, but will add a few points of its own. First, although conduct like Greffet\u2019s certainly does not fall under apparent authority\u2014which requires an objectively reasonable perception that the agent was acting pursuant to the principal\u2019s orders \u2014 some attention should be paid to the level of sophistication and, frankly, desperation, typical among inmates, and how those factors affect their reasonable perception of a prison guard\u2019s authority. In an inmate\u2019s eyes, the State authority that prison guards wield appears delegated, and not merely representatively exercised. In other words, an inmate\u2014 especially one, like Pe\u00f1a, whom a guard has consistently singled out for attention\u2014 likely feels as if she is not merely under the State\u2019s control, by way of its guards, but that she is under the control of the guard himself.\nSecond, a prison guard who harasses an-inmate does so with a built-in quasi-claim of right. An inmate who challenges a prison guard\u2019s actions as being outside the scope of his agency relationship \u2014 ie., outside his or her lawful authority \u2014 does so in the face of substantial risk of retaliation, not merely from the .prison guard, but from the guard\u2019s employer \u2014 the prison higher-ups \u2014 as well. The credibility gap between prison guards and inmates is enormous in everyone\u2019s eyes, but especially in the eyes of the jail employees directly responsible for handling complaints \u2014 -who are, after all, the tortfeasor\u2019s coworkers.\nBoth of these reasons apply more strongly in the prison guard-inmate context than in the police officer-citizen context. As to the first reason, while citizens and police officers alike may feel, to some extent, like a police officer on the scene \u201cis the law,\u201d interactions between any one police officer and any one citizen happen only occasionally, and are usually brief. Conversely, a prison guard\u2019s interactions with an inmate are more-or-less continuous, usually over an extended period of time, thus furthering the impression that it is the guard, not the guard\u2019s employer, to *1136whom the inmate is beholden. As to the second reason, while there may generally be a credibility gap between a police officer and a citizen, this gap\u2019s size varies depending on the citizen in question, and, unless the officer happens to know the citizen with whom he or she is dealing, the officer has little way of knowing \u2014 and thus little way of exploiting \u2014 even the larger gaps that exist when the citizen in question turns out to be, e.g., a recidivist criminal. Prison guards, however, know that the person with whom they are dealing is a criminal, and thus likely to be viewed as less than fully credible. Also, unlike the police officer-citizen relationship, the prison guard-inmate relationship is an irreducibly unpleasant one \u2014 one oriented around captivity and control \u2014 and complaints of mistreatment or abuse from prisoners are thus more apt to be shrugged off by authorities than complaints from citizens about police officers.\nThe Court thus concludes that applying the aided-in-agency theory to cases where a principal vests an agent with extraordinary control over a third party, which the agent then uses to commit a tort against the third party, (i) is true to Ocanals text and rationale; (ii) is a workable rule, which does not give rise to limitless vicarious liability; and (iii) is a sensible rule, which furthers policy considerations \u2014 such as deterrence and accountability on the principal\u2019s part, and providing compensation to injured victims \u2014 which would likely motivate the Supreme Court of New Mexico to adopt the rule.\nC. THE COURT\u2019S CONSTRUCTION CREATES CONSISTENCY BETWEEN INMATES OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PRISONS AS TO THEIR ABILITY TO RECEIVE REDRESS FOR THE WRONGS OF PRISON GUARDS.\nThere is another consideration that cuts in favor of adopting the Vermont and California supreme courts\u2019 construction of the aided-in-agency theory: it puts inmates of privately run correctional facilities on an equal footing with those of state-run facilities in terms of inmates\u2019 ability to recover from the \u201cdeep pocket\u201d \u2014 the corporation and the State, respectively. As it stands presently, it is easier to recover from the State than from a private corrections corporation on state-law intentional tort claims arising from prisoner abuse. This disparity is not immediately evident, so the Court will explain how recovery is sought from both classes of prison guards.\nState-employee prison guards, unlike private ones, are entitled to immunity under the NMTCA. See N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 41-4-4A (\u201cA governmental entity and any public employee while acting within the scope of duty are granted immunity from liability for any tort....\u201d); id. \u00a7 41^1-3 (\u201c \u2018[Pjublic employee\u2019 means an officer, employee or servant of a governmental entity, excluding independent contractors .... \u201d); Giron v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 14 F.Supp.2d 1245, 1252 (D.N.M.1998) (Hansen, J.). At facilities where the majority of those held have not yet been convicted and are being held pending trial \u2014 most \u201cjails\u201d \u2014 guards are considered \u201claw enforcement officers\u201d under the NMTCA, and, as a result, do not have immunity against most intentional-tort claims, including assault and battery. See N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 41-4-12 (waiving immunity for injuries \u201cresulting from assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest,\u201d and other intentional torts); id. \u00a7 41-4-3D (defining \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d as one \u201cwhose principal duties under law are to hold in custody any person accused of a criminal offense, to maintain public order or to make arrests for crimes\u201d (emphasis added)); Callaway v. N.M. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 1994-NMCA-049, \u00b6 12, 117 N.M. 637, 875 P.2d 393, 397 (holding that, at facilities with mostly post-conviction prisoners, \u201ccorrections officers are not law enforce-*1137merit officers under\u201d the NMTCA); Davis v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Dona Ana Cnty., 1999-NMCA-110, \u00b6 35, 127 N.M. 785, 987 P.2d 1172, 1183 (holding that guards at facilities \u201cin which the inmates are primarily \u2018accused of a criminal offense\u2019 and awaiting trial, fall within the definition of law enforcement officers under\u201d the NMTCA). At facilities where the majority of the inmates have already been convicted \u2014 -presumably all \u201cprisons\u201d\u2014 guards\u2019 immunity from suit is essentially absolute.18 Immunity is limited to the guard\u2019s \u201cscope of duties,\u201d but that term is not synonymous with the common-law concept of \u201cscope of employment\u201d: as noted earlier, under standard agency principles, an employee\u2019s scope of employment generally excludes all intentionally tortious conduct, per se; a guard\u2019s \u201cscope of duties,\u201d on the other hand, includes almost everything he or she does at the facility. See Risk Mgmt. Div., Dep\u2019t of Fin. &amp; Admin., State v. McBrayer, 2000-NMCA-104, \u00b6\u00b6 8-23, 129 N.M. 778, 14 P.3d 43, 46-50. Paralleling the NMTCA\u2019s protections against state-law claims, state-employee prison guards are entitled to qualified immunity against federal suits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, whereas private prison guards receive no such benefit. See Richardson v. McKnight, 521 U.S. 399, 412, 117 S.Ct. 2100, 138 L.Ed.2d 540 (1997) (\u201c[P]ri-vate prison guards, unlike those who work directly for the government, do not enjoy immunity from suit in a \u00a7 1983 case.\u201d).\nIf an inmate at a state-run facility manages to sue and obtain a judgment against one of his or her prison guards, however, payment by the State is essentially automatic. Although the Supreme Court of New Mexico purports to have a nuanced vicarious-liability standard for NMTCA cases, see Weinstein v. City of Santa Fe ex rel. Santa Fe Police Dep\u2019t, 1996-NMSC-021, \u00b6\u00b6 14-17, 121 N.M. 646, 916 P.2d 1313, 1318-19, the reality is that, if an inmate can recover a judgment against a state-employee prison guard \u2014 whether under state law or \u00a7 1983 \u2014 the State has to pay it:\nA governmental entity shall pay any award for punitive or exemplary damages awarded against a public employee under the substantive law of a jurisdiction other than New Mexico, including other states, territories and possessions and the United States of America, if the public employee was acting within the scope of his duty.[19]\n*1138N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 41^-4C. The State thus indemnifies prison guards in state-run institutions almost automatically, whether the judgment is under state law or under \u00a7 1983.\nTo recover against a private corrections corporation, however \u2014 rather than just against the often judgment-proof prison guard \u2014 the inmate must establish supervisory liability, which requires showing that the employer was \u201cnegligen[t] in selecting, training, retaining, supervising, or otherwise controlling the agent.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 7.05(1). Applying the aided-in-agency theory to private prison guards and their corporate employers brings consistency to the civil-rights vicarious-liability landscape.\nD. THE THIRD RESTATEMENT\u2019S DISCONTINUATION OF THE THEORY IS OF MINIMAL IMPORTANCE.\nAfter itself creating the aided-in-agency theory in 1958, the Restatement of Agency series now distances itself from the theory \u2014 more-or-less pretending that it never existed. The Third Restatement, however, has little to no bearing on this case. The Supreme Court of New Mexico has cited to the Restatement (Third) of Agency only four times \u2014 never for any principle that contradicts the Restatement (Second) of Agency, and never for anything having to do with the aided-in-agency theory or intentional-tort liability, more generally. See Baker v. Hedstrom, 2013-NMSC-043, \u00b6 32, 309 P.3d 1047, 1056; San Juan Agri. Water Users Ass\u2019n v. KNME-TV, 2011-NMSC-011, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 43, 150 N.M. 64, 257 P.3d 884, 890, 894; Hamberg v. Sandia Corp., 2008-NMSC-015, \u00b6 13, 143 N.M. 601, 179 P.3d 1209, 1212; Maes v. Audubon Indem. Ins. Grp., 2007-NMSC-046, \u00b6 17, 142 N.M. 235, 164 P.3d 934, 939. While it may initially seem unsettling to stick with a theory after its creator and chief proponent renounces it \u2014 especially given that judicial acceptance of the theory was almost entirely predicated on trust in the creator \u2014 it is appropriate here. First, neither the American Law Institute nor the Restatement of Agency \u201cseries\u201d is a monolithic or continuous institution to which the Court should necessarily ascribe internally consistent decisionmaking. None of the Second Restatement\u2019s authors participated in the Third Restatement, and the Third Restatement \u2019s authors may not be any more in-the-know regarding the aided-in-agency theory than the Court is. Nor is the American Law Institute or the Restatement of Agency series an institution \u2014 like, say, the Supreme Court \u2014 to which the Court must, as a matter of law \u2014 in the Supreme Court\u2019s case, as a matter of stare decisis \u2014 impute an artificial internal consistency that spans across changes in membership. The Restatements are each separate treatises whose persuasive weight should be judged individually, and the Court can no more assume trans-edition internal consistency from them than it can from two separate articles published in the same law review.20 Second, even if the same authors who wrote the Second Restatement had also written the Third Restatement, they would still be powerless to undo the case law that developed in the *1139interim between the two editions. This observation is especially relevant when the intervening case law constitutes mandatory authority, but it is also relevant when the case law is merely persuasive \u2014 -judges may have their own reasons, separate from those of the Restatement authors, for adopting the theory. Third, because, unlike the Second Restatement, the Supreme Court of New Mexico has never cited, let alone adopted, the Third Restatement\u2019s views on the aided-in-agency theory, the Third Restatement is strictly persuasive authority. As persuasive authority, the Third Restatement\u2019s take on the aided-in-agency theory is (i) directly contradicted by controlling authority, namely Ocana; and (ii) not very persuasive, ignoring a half-century of aided-in-agency precedent, and failing to engage any of the rationales for or against the theory.\nThe Restatement brought the aided-in-agency theory into the world, and it now wishes to take it out. The Third Restatement has no right to do so, however. In the forty-eight years that \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2 spent floating around the American legal system, it took on a life of its own in the case law \u2014 including from such authoritative sources as the Supreme Courts of the United States and of New Mexico. It is that life \u2014 not the Second Restatement\u2019s unexplained and probably wrongheaded initial articulation of the theory, or the Third Restatement\u2019s attempts to wish it away \u2014 that the Court must apply.\nIII. THE THEORY\u2019S APPLICATION IN THIS CASE.\nHaving formulated its Erie prediction, the Court now applies the aided-in-agency theory to Pe\u00f1a\u2019s allegations that Greffet raped her at the NMWCF. The Court concludes that Pe\u00f1a has plausibly alleged that Greffet\u2019s employment with CCA imbued him with extraordinary power over Pe\u00f1a and that this power aided Greffet in committing sexual battery against her. Greffet\u2019s job did not merely give him the opportunity to batter Pe\u00f1a\u2014 in the way that an NMWCF janitor might have an agency-aided opportunity to batter her by virtue of having access to her \u2014 but, rather, it gave him an extraordinary power over Pe\u00f1a, which Greffet used, in much the same manner as the deputy in Doe v. Forrest, to coerce Pe\u00f1a into oral sex.\nThe Court has already summarized Pe\u00f1a\u2019s factual allegations. See infra Factual Background. She articulates the legal theory through which she seeks relief from CCA as follows:\nAt all times that. Defendant Greffet sexually contacted and penetrated Plaintiff, Plaintiff lacked the capacity to consent to thereto. In any case, Plaintiff did not consent to the sexual penetration or contact.\nDefendant Greffet\u2019s sexual contact and penetration of Plaintiff in the NMWCF ... constituted the intentional torts of battery and rape.\nAt the time of the NMWCF rapes, Plaintiff was directly informed and/or had reason to believe that Defendant Greffet was an agent and employee of the Corporation.\nBecause Defendant Greffet was an agent of the Corporation at the time of the NMWCF rapes, the Corporation is legally liable for the tortious conduct that occurred at the NMWCF, as described above, under the legal doctrine of \u201crespondeat superior.\u201d\nComplaint \u00b6\u00b6 77-78, at 12; id. \u00b6\u00b6 80-81, at 12. While sparse, and seemingly aimed more squarely at an apparent-authority theory than an aided-in-agency one, these allegations suffice to state a claim against CCA under the aided-in-agency theory of vicarious liability.\n*1140The picture the Complaint paints is clear enough. Greffet, \u201ca corrections officer[ ] at the NMWCF,\u201d Complaint \u00b6 6, at 2, \u201cbegan to make sexualized comments about [the] physical appearance,\u201d Complaint \u00b6 10, at 2, of Pe\u00f1a, \u201ca post-conviction prisoner\u201d at the NMWCF, Complaint \u00b6 3, at 1, and someone under Greffet\u2019s charge. \u201cFor a time, [Pe\u00f1a] resisted these advances,\u201d Complaint \u00b6 11, at 2, but, in the succeeding months, Greffet \u201cbegan to sexually fondle\u201d Pe\u00f1a, Complaint \u00b6 12, at 3. Soon after, Greffet \u201ccalled [Pe\u00f1a] into the Commander\u2019s offiee[ ] ... of NMWCF,\u201d Complaint \u00b6 16, at 3, \u201crevealed his erect penis to\u201d her, Complaint \u00b6 17, at 3, and \u201corally sodomized her,\u201d Complaint \u00b6 18, at 3. This pattern of behavior continued, eventually resulting in Greffet impregnating Pe\u00f1a. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 31-39, at 5-6. Pe\u00f1a alleges that she \u201cdid not consent,\u201d and, in fact, \u201clacked the capacity to consent,\u201d because of the power than Greffet held over her. Complaint \u00b6 77, at 12.\nThese- allegations set forth facts that render it plausible that Greffet was able to sexually batter Pe\u00f1a only by abusing the extraordinary power his position vested in him, and manipulating the submission Pe\u00f1a was required to show to someone in his position of authority. They therefore suffice to state a claim, which the jury can accept or reject at trial. The Court will add that this case implicates many of the policy considerations that led it to conclude that the aided-in-agency theory applies to prison guard-inmate torts in the first place. The State of New Mexico entrusts CCA with executing a core governmental function \u2014 something only the government can do \u2014 and CCA does not do it for free. CCA makes a taxpayer-funded profit operating prisons, administering the deliberate and controlled deprivation of basic liberties of citizens of the State of New Mexico as part of their state-sanctioned criminal punishment. CCA knows the standards that pertain to imprisonment in the United States, it knows how important those standards are, and it knows that one of the biggest concerns that the State of New Mexico has in outsourcing its incarceration functions is the maintenance of those standards. Sexual bodily integrity is not, never has been, and never will be one of the rights relinquished upon receipt of a criminal conviction in this country. If Pe\u00f1a\u2019s allegations are indeed true, and Greffet was able have undetected sex with a prisoner on the premises of a New Mexico correctional facility, then the Court cannot say that the law will, or should, be all that sympathetic to CCA\u2019s arguments that it should not have to assume the economic risk of hiring a rogue officer. The State of New Mexico pays CCA not to hire bad apples, and the Supreme Court of New Mexico would likely conclude that the harms that incidents like this one inflict on the public\u2019s trust in the penal system justify any dent that the imposition of vicarious liability might make in CCA\u2019s coffers.\nIT IS ORDERED that the CCA Defendants\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, filed September 20, 2014 (Doc. 63), is denied.\n\n. The Court earlier issued an Order, filed September 9, 2014 (Doc. 77), denying the CCA Defendants\u2019 Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, filed September 20, 2013 (Doc. 63). In its Order, the Court stated that it would, \u201cat a later date[,] issue a Memorandum Opinion more fully detailing its rationale for this decision.\u201d Order at 1 n. 1. This Memorandum Opinion is the promised opinion.\n\n\n. Throughout the factual allegations in her Complaint, Pe\u00f1a uses terms related to sexual abuse as the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 15601-15609 (\"PREA\u201d), defines them. Pe\u00f1a is not, however, contending that the PREA applies to her claims in this case. Section 15609(11) of Title 42 of the United States Code provides: \"The term 'sexual fondling\u2019 means the touching of the private body parts of another person (including the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks) for the purpose of sexual gratification.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15609(11).\n\n\n. The PREA defines rape as:\n(A) the carnal knowledge, oral sodomy, sexual assault with an object, or sexual fondling of a person, forcibly or against that person\u2019s will;\n(B) the carnal knowledge, oral sodomy, sexual assault with an object, or sexual fondling of a person not forcibly or against the person\u2019s will, where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his or her youth or his or her temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity; or\n*1107(C) the carnal knowledge, oral sodomy, sexual assault with an object, or sexual fondling of a person achieved through the exploitation of the fear or threat of physical violence or bodily injury.\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15609(9).\n\n\n. The Honorable Antonin G. Scalia, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, has criticized the Restatements \u2014 the modern ones, especially \u2014 for losing sight of their purported mission of summarizing existing law:\nThe object of the original Restatements was \"to present an orderly statement of the general common law.\u201d Restatement of Conflict of Laws, Introduction, p. viii (1934). Over time, the Restatements ' authors have abandoned the mission of describing the law, and have chosen instead to set forth their aspirations for what the law ought to be. Keyes, The Restatement (Second): Its Misleading Quality and a Proposal for Its Amelioration, 13 Pepp. L.Rev. 23, 24-25 (1985). Section 39 of the Third Restatement of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment is illustrative; as Justice THOMAS notes, it constitutes a \" 'novel extension' \u201d of the law that finds little if any support in case law. Restatement sections such as that should be given no weight whatever as to the current state of the law, and no more weight regarding what the law ought to be than the recom-mend\u00e1tions of any respected lawyer or scholar. And it cannot safely be assumed, without further inquiry, that a Restatement provision describes rather than revises cur.rent law.\nKansas v. Nebraska, - U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1042, 1064, 191 L.Ed.2d 1 (2015) (Scalia, J., dissenting). The Court agrees with Justice Scalia\u2019s criticisms, but it notes that, in this case, whether the Restatement's rule was descriptive or prescriptive at the time it was written is irrelevant. The Supreme Court of New Mexico explicitly adopted it in Ocana, thus elevating its status above that of mere persuasive authority \u2014 which is all the Restate-*1117merits usually are, in the absence of express incorporation in controlling authority.\n\n\n. The analogous section of the Restatement (First) of Agency contains no reference to the aided-in-agency theory:\n(1) Except as to fellow servants, a master is subject to liability for injuries caused by the tortious conduct of servants within the scope of their employment.\n(2) Except as stated in \u00a7\u00a7 212-214 and 265-267, a master is not liable for the tortious conduct of servants acting outside the scope of employment.\nRestatement (First) of Agency \u00a7 219 (1933). The sections to which \u00a7 219(2) refers relate to situations where the principal intends to bring about the agent\u2019s actions or their consequences, see Restatement (First) of Agency \u00a7 212, agent negligence, see id. \u00a7 213, situations where a principal fails to perform what should be a non-delegable duty, see id. \u00a7 214, and situations where the agent had apparent authority, see id. \u00a7\u00a7 265-267.\n\n\n. Put more simply, if a tortfeasor uses his or her apparent authority to commit a tort that he or she could not have committed \u2014 or would have had a harder time committing\u2014 without the apparent authority, then the agency relationship aided the tortfeasor. There could theoretically, however, be situations in which a tortfeasor acted with apparent authority but was not aided in agency. For example, if a plaintiff owes money to a loans-hark, and someone whom the plaintiff knows to be one of the loanshark's minions comes to the plaintiff\u2019s home and beats and robs the plaintiff, the plaintiff may reasonably believe that the minion was acting on the loanshark\u2019s authority, thus giving rise to vicarious liability under an apparent-authority theory. If, however, the minion was, in actuality, just robbing the plaintiff at random for the minion\u2019s own personal gain, then, unless the plaintiff submitted to the minion's robbery as a result of minion\u2019s apparent authority, the minion\u2019s agency relationship with the loanshark did not aid the minion in his commission of the torts. This example illustrates that, while \u00a7 219(2)(d)\u2019s first clause is not the \"primary\u201d source of theoretical liability in \u00a7 219(2)(d), nor does the second clause entirely swallow it.\n\n\n. The Restatement created the aided-in-agency theory in 1958. For such a theoretically cavernous theory of liability \u2014 one of which, it would seem, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers would have at least wanted to test the boundaries \u2014 there is surprisingly little case law on it from the first few ensuing decades.\n\n\n. As the Court alluded earlier, the First Circuit did not hold that the aided-in-agency theory contains an instrumentality requirement. It stated only that, even if an instrumentality requirement were to be grafted onto the theory, that case\u2019s facts would still give rise to vicarious liability, because the key was an instrumentality. See Costos v. Coconut Island Corp., 137 F.3d at 50; Zsigo v. Hurley Med. Ctr., 716 N.W.2d at 225 (\u201cSpecifically, the key was the 'instrumentality' that provided the manager with the opportunity to accomplish the rape.\u201d).\n\n\n. This characterization is perhaps a too-harsh one, and the Court means it with no disrespect \u2014 nor does the Court even mean to suggest that the Supreme Court was wrong. In these cases, however, despite the Supreme Court's proclamation that it was \"rely[ing] \u2018on the general common law of agency,\u2019 \u201d it ultimately narrowed \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2 by looking to Title VII-specific policy considerations. Both cases contain the same sentence summarizing their reasoning:\nIn order to accommodate the principle of vicarious liability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority, as well as Title VII\u2019s equally basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees, we adopt the following holding in this case and in [the other case], also decided today.\nBurlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 764, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998) (Kennedy, J.); Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (Souter, J.). These opinions are not likely to win any awards for the tightness of their analyses, cf. Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 771-72, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998) (Thomas, J., dissenting)(\u201cThis rule is a whole-cloth creation that draws no support from the legal principles on which the Court claims it .is based.... [This] holding is a product of willful policymaking, pure and simple.\u201d), but, in fairness to the Supreme Court, the Circuit-level law on Title VII harassment claims was all over the place \u2014 sometimes even within the same Circuit \u2014 and an authoritative, final construction was sorely needed, see Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 749, 118 S.Ct. 2257 (\"The Court of Appeals en banc reversed in a decision which produced eight separate opinions and no consensus for a controlling rationale.\u201d).\n\n\n. The commercial legal-research databases do not typically report opinions from the New Mexico district courts, so the Court cannot guarantee that no state trial court discussed\u2014 or at least mentioned- \u2014 -it.\n\n\n. The Supreme Court of the United States considered and rejected this construction, holding that \u00a7 219(2)(d)\u2019s apparent-authority clause and its aided-in-agency clause do not modify one another, and their placement together in \u00a7 219(2)(d) does not affect either clause's substantive meaning.\nThe City ... contends that \u00a7 219(2)(d) has no application here. It argues that the second qualification of the subsection, referring to a servant \"aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation,\u201d merely \"refines\u201d the one preceding it, which holds the employer vicariously liable for its servant's abuse of apparent authority. But this narrow reading is untenable; it would render the second qualification of \u00a7 219(2)(d) almost entirely superfluous (and would seem to ask us to shut our eyes to the potential effects of supervisory authority, even when not explicitly invoked). The illustrations accompanying this subsection make clear that it covers not only cases involving the abuse of apparent authority, but also cases in which tortious conduct is made possible or facilitated by the existence of the actual agency relationship.\nFaragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. at 801-02, 118 S.Ct. 2275 (citations omitted).\n\n\n. The Supreme Court of California also concluded: \"There is little or no risk that preventive measures would significantly interfere with the ability of police departments to enforce the law and to protect society from criminal acts.\u201d Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles, 285 Cal.Rptr. 99, 814 P.2d at 1348.\n\n\n. Interestingly, the Vermont Supreme Court issued that case a year after the American Law Institute abandoned the aided-in-agency theory in the Restatement (Third) of Torts, which was published in 2006. The Vermont Supreme Court does not discuss the new Restatement\u2019s decision to disclaim the theory, or cite to the new Restatement, at all.\n\n\n. While many successor Restatements maintain the same basic organization as their predecessor edition \u2014 keeping the section numbering of various topics the same across *1130editions \u2014 the Restatement (Third) of Agency uses an entirely different numbering system and organization than the Second Restatement. Where there once was \u00a7 219, titled \u201cWhen Master is Liable for Torts of His Servants,\u201d inside a title, titled \"Torts of Servants,\u201d inside a topic, titled \"Liability for Authorized Conduct or Conduct Incidental Thereto,\u201d inside a chapter, titled \"Liability of Principal to Third Person; Torts,\u201d there now is, within the chapter titled \"Torts \u2014 Liability of Agent and Principal,\u201d a topic titled \"Principal\u2019s Liability,\u201d containing the following sections: (i) \"Principal's Liability' \u2014 In General\u201d; (ii) \"Agent Acts with Actual Authority\u201d; (iii) \"Principal's Negligence in Conducting Activity Through Agent; Principal\u2019s Special Relationship with Another Person\u201d; (iv) \"Failure in Performance of Principal\u2019s Duty of Protection\u201d; (v) \"Employee Acting Within the Scope of Employment\u201d; and (vi) \"Agent Acts with Apparent Authority.\u201d\n\n\n. The Court is reluctant to be overly critical of the American Law Institute and its Fellows \u2014 whose hard work has produced such foundational scholarly contributions as the Model Penal Code, the Uniform Commercial Code, and the Restatements \u2014 but the Third Restatement\u2019s cursory treatment of the aided-in-agency theory is unhelpful, and it ducks issues the Restatement has a responsibility to address. Myriad courts nationwide, including the Supreme Court of the United States, relied extensively on the Second Restatement\u2019s \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2 in defining the contours of vicarious liability for various claims \u2014 including those arising under Title VII, which are among the most commonly brought claims in the federal court system. The Third Restatement\u2019s single-paragraph explanation for the change would be more suited to a renumbering or syntactic reformulation than it is to an abandonment of highly important, theoretically open-ended, and much-debated substantive provision, which an earlier edition of the same publication created out of whole cloth. In the words of Professor Alan Oxford of the Appalachian School of Law, \"although a Restatement should not invent the recipe, it should clean up the mess it leaves behind.\u201d Oxford, supra, at 166 (emphasis omitted)(capitalization altered for readability).\n\n\n. The Court need not decide \u2014 or rather, as a federal court, it cannot decide, and it need not opine \u2014 the question whether this theory extends to state-operated correctional facilities. The question before the Court is whether the theory applies to private correctional facilities.\n\n\n. In performing its Erie-mandated duty to predict what a state supreme court would do if faced with a case, see Comm\u2019r v. Estate of Bosch, 387 U.S. 456, 87 S.Ct. 1776, 18 L.Ed.2d 886 (1967), a federal court may sometimes contradict the state supreme court's own precedent if the federal court concludes that the state supreme court would, given the opportunity, overrule its earlier holding, see Anderson Living Trust v. WPX Energy Prod., LLC, 27 F.Supp.3d 1188, 1247 n. 30 (D.N.M.2014) (Browning, J.). Courts should, obviously, be reticent to formulate an Erie prediction that conflicts with state-court precedent; even if the prediction turns out to be correct, such predictions produce disparate results between cases filed in state and federal courts, as the old state supreme court precedent usually binds state trial courts. The factors to which a federal court should look before making an Erie prediction that a state supreme court will overrule its prior precedent vary depending upon the case, but some consistent ones include: (i) the age of the state supreme court decision from which the federal court is considering departing\u2014 the younger the state case is, the less likely it is that departure is warranted; (ii) the amount of doctrinal reliance that the state courts- \u2014 especially the state supreme court\u2014 have placed on the state decision from which the federal court is considering departing; (iii) apparent shifts away from the doctrine that the state decision articulates, especially if the state supreme court has explicitly called an older case\u2019s holding into question; (iv) changes in the composition of the state supreme court, especially if mostly dissenting justices from the earlier state decision remain on the court; and (v) the decision's patent illogic or its inapplicability to modern times. In short, a state supreme court case that a federal court Erie predicts will be overruled is likely to be very old, neglected by subsequent state-court cases \u2014 perhaps because it is in a dusty corner of the common law which does not get much attention or have much application \u2014 and clearly wrong.\nThe Supreme Court of New Mexico unanimously decided Ocana, and it did so only eleven years ago. As a result, three of the five justices who were on the Supreme Court of New Mexico at the time that it decided Ocana are still on the court today. Compare Ocana, 2004-NMSC-018, 135 N.M. 539, 91 P.3d 58 (Maes, CJ., joined by Minzner, Serna, Bosson &amp; Chavez, JJ.), with Justices of the Supreme Court, New Mexico Supreme Court, https:// nmsupremecourt.nmcourts.gov/bios/index. php (last visited June 16, 2015)(listing the Supreme Court of New Mexico\u2019s current membership as Vigil, C.J., and Maes, Bosson, Chavez, &amp; Daniels, JJ.). The aided-in-agency theory has not flourished doctrinally in the New Mexico courts \u2014 in fact, it was never brought up again after Ocana \u2014 but nor has it ever been called into question. New Mexico courts have cited Ocana for propositions unrelated to the aided-in-agency theory on at least twenty-eight occasions, including three times by the Supreme Court of New Mexico. For these reasons, the Court does not conclude that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would, if faced with the facts now before the Court, overrule Ocana. Rather, the Court will \u2014 in line with the usual practice \u2014 reconcile its Erie prediction with Ocana.\n\n\n. The difference in immunity afforded to guards at mostly pre-conviction facilities and those at mostly post-conviction facilities may seem unprincipled to some. Even assuming post-conviction inmates are less deserving of protection from guards' intentional torts than pre-conviction detainees \u2014 an assumption which, itself, implies that tortious conduct is a valid part of a criminal sentence \u2014 there is likely no sound reason why a pre-conviction detainee who happens to be housed at a mostly post-conviction facility should lack legal redress that is available to a post-conviction inmate who happens to be housed at a mostly pre-conviction facility. Nevertheless, the distinction represents sound statutory interpretation \u2014 the New Mexico Legislature has drawn the line for who counts as a law enforcement officer at whether the individual\u2019s \"principal duties under law are to hold in custody any person accused of a criminal offense\u201d \u2014 and the courts' duty is to apply the law as written, and not to rewrite the law into something it is not.\n\n\n. The State is not required, under \u00a7 41-4\u2014 4C, to indemnify a state-employee prison guard for torts committed outside of the guard\u2019s scope of duties. This exception is theoretically important, because the only way an inmate can recover state-law intentional-tort damages against a guard in a mostly post-conviction facility is by establishing that the tort was outside of the guard\u2019s scope of duties. Empirical evidence, however, indicates that this exception does almost no work: police officers, for instance, personally contribute to paying judgments entered against them in fewer than a half a percent of cases, and, collectively, they pay only 0.02 percent of *1138all civil-rights damages. See Joanna C. Schwartz, Police Indemnification, 89 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 885, 890 (2014)(\"Police officers are virtually always indemnified.\u201d).\n\n\n. This statement is not entirely fair. When the Restatements faithfully pursue their assigned mission to restate the law as it exists, there will naturally be a great deal of consistency across editions. When a Restatement creates its own theory \u2014 as it did with \u00a7 219(2)(d) cl. 2 \u2014 it cannot be assumed that a later Restatement edition\u2019s authors will share the same normative impulses that the former Restatement edition\u2019s authors had.\n\n",
