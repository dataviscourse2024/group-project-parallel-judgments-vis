For the second\ncount, the jury assessed punishment at confinement for twenty years. The trial court\naccepted the jury\u2019s recommendation on the first count and placed Appellant on\n\n      1\n       See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.011 (West Supp. 2017).\n\fcommunity supervision for ten years. On the second count, the trial court sentenced\nAppellant to confinement for twenty years. On appeal, Appellant presents two\nissues. We affirm.\n                              I. The Charged Offense\n      The grand jury indicted Appellant on two separate counts for the offense of\nsexual assault of a child. Under Count One, the indictment alleged that Appellant\nintentionally and knowingly caused the penetration of M.B.\u2019s sexual organ with his\nsexual organ while M.B. was under the age of seventeen. Under Count Two, the\nindictment alleged that Appellant intentionally and knowingly caused the\npenetration of M.B.\u2019s anus with his sexual organ while M.B. was under the age of\nseventeen. A person commits the offense of sexual assault of a child if the person\nintentionally or knowingly \u201ccauses the penetration of the anus or sexual organ of a\nchild\u201d who is under the age of seventeen. TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 22.011(a)(2)(A).\n                              II. Evidence at Trial\n      In November 2014, M.B. was living with Appellant\u2019s wife, Pollyanna Flores,\nand Appellant\u2019s ex-sister-in-law, Kyla Graves, in Lubbock. M.B. is Pollyanna\u2019s\ncousin and had moved in with Pollyanna to assist with the care of her three children.\nAppellant worked in the oil fields in Midland, Texas, and was only home about\n\u201conce every other week\u201d or on \u201c[t]he weekends.\u201d M.B. accused Appellant of\nsexually assaulting her at a hotel room in Midland on or about November 5, 2014.\nM.B. was sixteen years old at the time, and her recollection of that night was unclear\nbecause she drank too much alcohol.\n         A. M.B., Pollyanna, and the three children took a trip to Midland.\n      M.B., Pollyanna, the children, and Appellant met up at a Comfort Inn in\nMidland in a hotel room with two beds. Appellant brought alcoholic drinks with\nhim, and Appellant, Pollyanna, and M.B. all proceeded to drink together. M.B.\n\n\n                                          2\n\fremembered being on one of the beds while Appellant, Pollyanna, and the children\nwere on the other bed.\n      M.B. testified that the next thing she remembered was being in the bathroom\nwith Pollyanna. Pollyanna asked M.B. to check and see if Pollyanna still had her\ntampon in. M.B. checked for her. The next thing M.B. remembered was being in\nthe main room and lying on one of the beds next to Pollyanna. M.B. said that\nAppellant stood in front of his wife and then moved over to M.B. and \u201cput his penis\ninside of me [M.B.].\u201d M.B. \u201cbelieved\u201d that Appellant put his penis in her \u201cbutt,\u201d\nbut she did not remember if he put it anywhere else. M.B. remembered saying \u201cstop\u201d\nand then remembered being in the restroom \u201ctrying to calm down.\u201d M.B. showered\n\u201cto try and get everything out,\u201d and when she walked out of the restroom, she noticed\nthat Appellant was not there and Pollyanna was crying. M.B. then told Pollyanna\nthat she was ready to leave.\n      Graves testified at trial that M.B. called her on the phone around 4:00 or\n4:30 a.m. on their drive back to Lubbock and that they arrived back home around\n6:30 a.m. During the phone call with M.B., Graves did not notice anything out of\nthe ordinary. Graves remarked that, when M.B. arrived at the house, she appeared\nto be \u201c[j]ust fine\u201d but that Pollyanna was crying. Graves said that she never\nwitnessed anything inappropriate happen between Appellant and M.B.\n         B. M.B. spoke out about the sexual assault, and a nurse conducted\n            a sexual assault examination.\n      M.B. testified that, later that day, she texted her close friend about what had\nhappened. Her friend, in turn, communicated with M.B.\u2019s brother at school and told\nhim about the assault. M.B.\u2019s mother found out and took M.B. to the emergency\nroom at University Medical Center in Lubbock because M.B. was in pain and \u201cwas\nbleeding from [her] butt.\u201d At the emergency room, M.B. said she had been \u201craped\nthe night before\u201d by Appellant.\n\n                                          3\n\f      Angelica Loli Reyna, the \u201cnursing house supervisor\u201d at UMC and a sexual\nassault nurse examiner (SANE), and Cassandra Schmitt, a victim\u2019s advocate for the\nLubbock Rape Crisis Center, were called to UMC in response to M.B.\u2019s accusations.\nReyna conducted a sexual assault examination on M.B., and Schmitt was present\nduring the examination to \u201cprovide a listening ear.\u201d Reyna testified that M.B.\nidentified Appellant as her assailant and told her that Appellant \u201cstuck his penis in\n[her] vagina\u201d and then \u201cturned [her] over and stuck his penis in [her] butt.\u201d Reyna\nalso conducted an \u201canal-genital examination\u201d on M.B. and found an abrasion on her\ninner thigh and groin area, \u201csignificant redness\u201d at the entry of her vagina\u2014\nspecifically the posterior fourchette, and three anal tears. Reyna testified at trial that\nher findings were consistent with what M.B. had told her, specifically with regard to\nthe anal penetration that M.B. had alleged. Schmitt testified that M.B. was sobbing\nand shaking while speaking to the police and while recalling the assault to the nurse.\n                                     III. Analysis\n      In his first issue, Appellant claims his \u201ctrial counsel was ineffective when he\nadmitted his client\u2019s guilt to the jury during opening statement and closing\narguments.\u201d In his second issue, Appellant claims that the evidence was insufficient\nto convict him of sexual assault of a child as alleged in Count One of the indictment.\nWe will address Appellant\u2019s sufficiency challenge first and then address his\nineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n          A. Issue Two: The State adduced sufficient evidence to convict\n             Appellant of the offense of sexual assault of a child as alleged in\n             Count One of the indictment.\n      Appellant complains in his second issue that that the State adduced\ninsufficient evidence that Appellant intentionally and knowingly penetrated M.B.\u2019s\nsexual organ with his sexual organ. Appellant points out that M.B. could not recall\nif Appellant vaginally penetrated her but testified merely that she \u201cbelieved\u201d\n\n\n                                            4\n\fAppellant put his penis in her \u201cbutt.\u201d The State argues that Reyna\u2019s testimony and\nthe admitted SANE report provide competent evidence of vaginal penetration. We\nagree with the State and conclude that Reyna\u2019s testimony and the SANE report\nconstitute sufficient evidence from which a jury could have reasonably concluded\nthat Appellant penetrated M.B.\u2019s sexual organ with his sexual organ.\n      The standard of review for sufficiency of the evidence is whether any rational\njury could have found Appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the charged\noffense. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318 (1979); Brooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d\n893, 912 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010); Hooper v. State, 214 S.W.3d 9, 13 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2007). We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and\ndetermine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements\nof the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319; Isassi v. State,\n330 S.W.3d 633, 638 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). The trier of fact may believe all,\nsome, or none of a witness\u2019s testimony because the factfinder is the sole judge of the\nweight and credibility of the witnesses. Sharp v. State, 707 S.W.2d 611, 614 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1986); Isham v. State, 258 S.W.3d 244, 248 (Tex. App.\u2014Eastland 2008,\npet. ref\u2019d). We defer to the trier of fact\u2019s resolution of any conflicting inferences\nraised by the evidence and presume that the trier of fact resolved such conflicts in\nfavor of the verdict. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 326; Brooks, 323 S.W.3d at 894; Clayton v.\nState, 235 S.W.3d 772, 778 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\n      Although M.B. did not testify at trial that she was vaginally penetrated by\nAppellant, M.B. told Reyna during the SANE examination that Appellant \u201cstuck his\npenis in my vagina.\u201d Reyna recounted M.B.\u2019s statements at trial, and Reyna\u2019s SANE\nreport, which also contained M.B.\u2019s allegations of vaginal penetration, was admitted\ninto evidence. M.B. testified she was sixteen years old at the time of the assault.\nThis is sufficient evidence from which a jury could have reasonably concluded that\nAppellant intentionally and knowingly penetrated M.B.\u2019s \u201csexual organ\u201d with his\n                                          5\n\fsexual organ while she was under the age of seventeen. PENAL \u00a7 22.011(a)(2)(A);\nsee Adams v. State, 502 S.W.3d 238, 244 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2016,\npet. ref\u2019d) (concluding that a SANE nurse\u2019s testimony was sufficient evidence from\nwhich a jury could have concluded that the defendant committed the offense of\naggravated sexual assault against a child). Moreover, Reyna found an abrasion on\nM.B.\u2019s inner thigh and groin area and \u201csignificant redness\u201d at the entry of her vagina.\n      The defense elicited testimony from Reyna that the \u201cabrasion\u201d was not\nactually an abrasion, but just \u201cpretty red\u201d skin, and that the red skin could have been\ncaused by tight clothing. The jury could have chosen to disregard this testimony.\nSee Sharp, 707 S.W.2d at 614; Isham, 258 S.W.3d at 248. After a review of the\nrecord, we hold that a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that\nAppellant committed the offense of sexual assault of a child as alleged in Count One\nof the indictment. We overrule Appellant\u2019s second issue.\n          B. Issue One: Appellant has failed to establish that he received\n             ineffective assistance of counsel.\n      Appellant argues in his first issue that he received ineffective assistance of\ncounsel because his attorney stated in his opening statement and closing argument\nthat \u201csomething did happen\u201d and that we are not going to deny that \u201csomething\nhappened.\u201d Appellant claims that this is a concession of guilt and argues that he\nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S.\n668 (1984), and, alternatively, United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984). As we\nexplain below, we disagree that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel conceded his guilt and hold\nthat Appellant has not carried his burden of showing ineffective assistance of counsel\nunder either Strickland or Cronic.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f             1. An appellant ordinarily has the burden, under Strickland,\n                to prove deficient performance and prejudice, but in\n                extreme circumstances, under the standard outlined in\n                Cronic, prejudice is presumed.\n      In most cases, we review an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under the\nStrickland standard, which is a two-part analysis that includes a performance prong\nand a prejudice prong. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687. For the performance prong,\nAppellant must show that trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. Id. For the\nprejudice prong, Appellant must show that there is a reasonable probability that the\noutcome would have differed but for trial counsel\u2019s errors. See Wiggins v. Smith,\n539 U.S. 510, 534 (2003); Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. \u201cA failure to make a showing\nunder either prong of the Strickland test defeats a claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel.\u201d Hudson v. State, No. 11-15-00047-CR, 2016 WL 3573484, at *2 (Tex.\nApp.\u2014Eastland June 30, 2016, pet. ref\u2019d) (mem. op., not designated for publication)\n(citing Perez v. State, 310 S.W.3d 890, 893 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010)).\n      In rare cases, a party claiming ineffective assistance of counsel is not required\nto show prejudice, but rather, prejudice is presumed and the party is only required to\nshow deficient performance. Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175, 190 (2004); see\nCronic, 466 U.S. at 658\u201360. As outlined in Cronic, prejudice will be presumed if\n\u201ccounsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial\ntesting.\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659. In this scenario, there is \u201ca constructive denial of\nthe assistance of counsel altogether,\u201d and prejudice is presumed because it is \u201cso\nlikely.\u201d Cannon v. State, 252 S.W.3d 342, 349 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (citing\nCronic, 466 U.S. at 658\u201359); see Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 696\u201397; Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 692; Ex parte McFarland, 163 S.W.3d 743, 752\u201353 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2005).\n      In Cannon, for example, the Court of Criminal Appeals presumed prejudice\nwhere defense counsel \u201ceffectively boycotted the trial proceedings\u201d and \u201cabandoned\n\n                                          7\n\fhis role as advocate for the defense.\u201d See id. at 350 (noting that counsel, in part,\ndeclined to participate in jury selection, declined to make objections, declined to\ncross-examine State witnesses, declined to make an opening or closing argument,\nand declined to offer any defense because he was \u201cunprepared to go forward\u201d). The\nTenth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals have also stated that an attorney\u2019s\nadmission that his client is guilty invokes the presumption of prejudice and results\nin a \u201cfail[ure] to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing.\u201d\nUnited States v. Swanson, 943 F.2d 1070, 1074 (9th Cir. 1991) (\u201cA lawyer who\ninforms the jury that it is his view of the evidence that there is no reasonable doubt\nregarding the only factual issues that are in dispute has utterly failed \u2018to subject the\nprosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing.\u2019\u201d (quoting Cronic, 466 U.S. at\n659)); Osborn v. Shillinger, 861 F.2d 612, 625 (10th Cir. 1988) (\u201c[A]n attorney who\nadopts and acts upon a belief that his client should be convicted \u2018fail[s] to function\nin any meaningful sense as the Government\u2019s adversary.\u2019\u201d); see also United States\nv. Williamson, 53 F.3d 1500, 1511 (10th Cir. 1995). This presumption of prejudice\nshould only be applied in extreme circumstances. See Harris v. State, No. 11-05-\n00411-CR, 2007 WL 2128954, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Eastland July 26 2007, no pet.)\n(not designated for publication) (citing Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659\u201360); see also Nixon,\n543 U.S. at 190.\n             2. Appellant has not shown that his trial counsel failed to\n                subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial\n                testing under Cronic.\n      Appellant asserts that prejudice should be presumed under Cronic because his\nattorney failed to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing\nwhen, in opening statement and closing argument, he stated that \u201csomething\nhappened.\u201d We disagree with Appellant\u2019s argument for two reasons: (1) Appellant\u2019s\nattorney did not admit Appellant\u2019s guilt when he stated that \u201csomething happened\u201d;\n\n\n                                           8\n\fand (2) Appellant\u2019s counsel remained an advocate for Appellant throughout the\nentire trial.\n       First, when counsel\u2019s statements are considered in context with his full\nopening and closing statements, rather than in isolation, it is clear that counsel did\nnot concede Appellant\u2019s guilt. In counsel\u2019s opening statement and closing argument,\neach time he said that \u201csomething did happen\u201d and that we are not going to deny that\n\u201csomething happened,\u201d he limited his statements immediately afterwards when he\nargued that the State could not meet its burden of proof. For example, in closing\nargument after counsel said, \u201cWe\u2019re not denying that something happened,\u201d he\nasked the jury twice: \u201cWhat really happened?\u201d He continued and stated that the\nState\u2019s case \u201cis riddled with nothing but reasonable doubt\u201d and ultimately asked the\njury to find Appellant \u201cnot guilty.\u201d Counsel\u2019s statements were not a concession of\nguilt because his statement that \u201csomething happened\u201d does not concede facts that\nshow Appellant was guilty of an element of the offense of sexual assault of a child.\nCompare Nixon, 543 U.S. at 182 (conceding guilt where counsel stated that \u201c[i]n\nthis case, there won\u2019t be any question, none whatsoever, that my client, Joe Elton\nNixon, caused Jeannie Bickner\u2019s death\u201d), and Swanson, 943 F.2d at 1074\n(presuming prejudice because defense counsel conceded that there was no\nreasonable doubt that his client was the perpetrator and that he committed the offense\ncharged), with Williamson, 53 F.3d at 1510\u201312 (holding that there was no concession\nof guilt where defense counsel stated in closing argument that he was not going to\ndispute the testimony from three police officers that they bought drugs from his\nclient, even though the defendant had testified that they were lying).\n       Second, the entire record reflects that Appellant\u2019s attorney \u201cremained a legal\nadvocate of the defendant who acted with \u2018undivided allegiance and faithful devoted\nservice.\u2019\u201d Williamson, 53 F.3d at 1511. Before trial began, Appellant\u2019s counsel\nfiled various motions and participated in several hearings\u2014all in support of\n                                          9\n\fAppellant\u2019s defense. Appellant\u2019s attorney subsequently questioned and instructed\nthe venire panel during voir dire about the State\u2019s burden of proof, the presumption\nof innocence afforded to Appellant, and the possibility of probation as punishment.\nAppellant\u2019s attorney thereafter asserted numerous challenges for cause and\nexhausted all of the allowable peremptory strikes at the conclusion of voir dire.\n      During the State\u2019s case-in-chief, the State called six witnesses to testify, and\nAppellant\u2019s trial counsel cross-examined all of the witnesses.          Significantly,\nAppellant\u2019s counsel elicited testimony, on cross-examination from Reyna, that\nsexual assault was not the only possible cause of M.B.\u2019s injuries. In addition, Reyna\nconceded that the \u201cabrasion\u201d she observed was not actually an abrasion at all but,\nrather, was just \u201cpretty red\u201d skin. In addition to other objections, Appellant\u2019s\ncounsel objected to the admission of the SANE report and to the proffer of Reyna as\nan expert.\n      After the State rested, the defense called two witnesses: Kyla Graves and\nAppellant\u2019s mother, Zoila Flores.        Appellant\u2019s counsel elicited exculpatory\ntestimony from Graves that she never witnessed anything inappropriate transpire\nbetween Appellant and M.B.\n      Based on the foregoing, there is nothing in the record to suggest that\nAppellant\u2019s trial counsel failed \u201cto subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful\nadversarial testing.\u201d Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659. For the presumption of prejudice to\napply, \u201cthe attorney\u2019s failure to test the prosecutor\u2019s case must be complete.\u201d Bell,\n535 U.S. at 686; see Cannon, 252 S.W.3d at 350. The extreme circumstances\nrequired to presume prejudice are not before us in this case. Therefore, to prevail on\nhis ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Appellant must show, under Strickland,\nboth deficient performance and prejudice. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f             3. Appellant has failed to show that his attorney\u2019s remarks,\n                even if we assume that such remarks constitute deficient\n                performance, prejudiced him.\n      Appellant argues under Strickland that his attorney rendered deficient\nperformance by the remarks made during opening and closing and that he was\nprejudiced as a result. Assuming without deciding that counsel\u2019s performance was\ndeficient under Strickland, Appellant has not shown that \u201cthere is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\nwould have been different.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694; Cannon, 252 S.W.3d at\n349. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence\nin the outcome.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. Appellant argues that admitting\n\u201csomething did happen\u201d undermined Appellant\u2019s not guilty plea and the reasonable\ndoubt argument espoused at trial. However, M.B.\u2019s and Reyna\u2019s testimony strongly\nweighed against Appellant and supported a finding that Appellant sexually assaulted\nM.B. \u201cWhen making [the prejudice] determination, any constitutionally deficient\nacts or omissions will be considered in light of the \u2018totality of the evidence before\nthe judge or jury.\u2019\u201d Ex parte Ellis, 233 S.W.3d 324, 331 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)\n(quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695). Given the weight of the evidence showing\nAppellant\u2019s guilt, counsel\u2019s remarks that \u201csomething happened\u201d did not prejudice\nAppellant\u2019s defense. See Thompson v. State, 915 S.W.2d 897, 904 n.2 (Tex. App.\u2014\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1996, pet. ref\u2019d) (concluding that an attorney\u2019s remarks\nthroughout trial that the true issue in the case was punishment rather than guilt did\nnot prejudice the defendant because there was \u201coverwhelming evidence of [the\ndefendant\u2019s] guilt\u201d). We overrule Appellant\u2019s first issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f                                     IV.
