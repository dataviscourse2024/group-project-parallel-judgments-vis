Ct. No. NA043605\n____________________________________)\n\n\n        A jury convicted defendant Calvin Dion Chism of the first degree murder\n(Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a) (count one))1 and attempted robbery (\u00a7\u00a7 211/664\n(count two)) of Richard Moon, and the second degree robbery of Jung Ja Chung (\u00a7\n211 (count three)).2 The jury found true the special circumstance allegation that\nthe murder was committed during the attempted commission of a robbery (\u00a7\n190.2, subd. (a)(17)(A)). It also found true allegations that a principal in counts\none and two was armed with a firearm (former \u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)), and that\ndefendant personally used a firearm in the commission of all three counts, (former\n\u00a7 12022.5, former subd. (a)(1), now subd. (a)). The trial court found true the\nallegation that defendant had suffered one prior serious or violent juvenile\n\n\n\n1       All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.\n2       Marcus Johnson and Samuel Taylor were tried with defendant for their\ninvolvement in the murder and attempted robbery of Moon. Each was convicted\nof first degree murder with an attempted robbery special circumstance, and each\nwas sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.\n\fadjudication within the meaning of the \u201cThree Strikes Law\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-\n(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)).\n       The jury was unable to reach a penalty verdict, and the trial court declared a\nmistrial. Another jury was impaneled. After a retrial of the penalty phase trial, the\nsecond jury returned a verdict of death as to count one.\n       The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for new trial (\u00a7 1181) and his\nmotion to modify the penalty verdict (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e)). With regard to count\none, the trial court sentenced defendant to death plus a consecutive upper term of\n10 years for the personal use of a firearm enhancement. The court sentenced\ndefendant to an upper term of six years on count two, plus a consecutive term of\nfive years for the personal use of a firearm enhancement, but the court stayed this\n11-year sentence pursuant to section 654. The court then imposed a consecutive\nupper term of five years on count three, doubled to 10 years under the Three\nStrikes Law, plus a 10-year consecutive sentence for the personal use of a firearm\nenhancement. Defendant was awarded 643 days of presentence custody credits.\nThis appeal is automatic.\n       We conclude defendant is entitled to 96 days of conduct credit (\u00a7 2933.1,\nsubd. (c)), and order the clerk of the superior court to modify the abstract of\njudgment to reflect those 96 days of conduct credit. The judgment, including the\ndeath sentence, is otherwise affirmed.\n                                      I. FACTS\n\n       A. Guilt Phase\n\n           1. Prosecution Evidence\n\n                a. Riteway Robbery\n       On May 18, 1997, defendant entered the Riteway Market (Riteway or\nmarket) in Compton alone and asked the lone clerk, Jung Ja Chung, for hair gel.\n\n\n                                          2\n\fChung said she did not have any, and defendant left. Defendant quickly returned\nwith codefendant Johnson and three accomplices. One accomplice approached\nChung, pointed his gun at her, and demanded money. Defendant went behind the\ncounter and told Chung to open the cash register. Defendant took cash from the\nregister and a nine-millimeter Glock handgun (the Glock) that the owner kept\nunder the counter. The other robbers took various items. Defendant pointed the\nGlock at Chung as he followed his accomplices out of the store.\n      At trial, defendant\u2019s California Youth Authority (CYA) parole officer,\nKenneth Lipkin, viewed the Riteway surveillance videotape of the robbery and\nrecognized defendant as the person who first entered the market and later pointed\nthe Glock at Chung as he left. Lipkin recognized defendant\u2019s voice on the tape\nsaying, \u201cWe\u2019re in the house. They don\u2019t have a video,\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a Glock,\u201d and\n\u201c187.\u201d Lipkin noted that defendant\u2019s \u201c187\u201d comment was a reference to the Penal\nCode section that defines murder.\n\n               b. Eddie\u2019s Liquor Store\n\n                  (1) The Murder and Attempted Robbery\n      On June 12, 1997,3 Edward Snow owned Eddie\u2019s Liquor (Eddie\u2019s or liquor\nstore), which was located at the intersection of East Artesia Boulevard and Butler\nAvenue in Long Beach. Richard Moon was employed at Eddie\u2019s as a clerk.\n      Codefendant Johnson\u2019s sister Marcia4 was acquainted with defendant and\nTaylor.5 Around 9:00 a.m. on June 12, defendant, Johnson, Taylor, and Marcia\n\n\n3      All calendar references are to 1997 unless otherwise noted.\n4      Codefendant Johnson, his sister, and an unrelated witness share the same\nlast name. To simplify our discussion of the facts and the law, we shall refer to\ncodefendant Johnson as Johnson, and we refer to Johnson\u2019s sister Marcia and\nwitness Stephanie Johnson by first name.\n5      Marcia testified pursuant to a plea agreement with the Los Angeles County\nDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office that provided she would serve a 12-year sentence for her\n\n                                         3\n\fmet at Marcia\u2019s home in Compton. Defendant wore black jeans and a black T-\nshirt with the word \u201cAir\u201d and a white Nike logo printed across the front (Nike Air\nT-shirt). Defendant had a Glock handgun in his waistband, the same gun Marcia\nhad seen him carrying \u201call the time\u201d during the previous month. Defendant told\nthem about his plan to rob Eddie\u2019s and assigned each person a task. He instructed\nMarcia to enter Eddie\u2019s to determine the location of any surveillance video\ncameras and the number of clerks. Defendant appointed Taylor to be the driver,\nand directed Johnson to go into the store with defendant. No one objected to\ndefendant\u2019s plan.\n       Approximately 15 minutes later, the group left Marcia\u2019s house in a light\ngray Plymouth Voyager van Taylor had borrowed from his girlfriend, Zonita\nWallace.6 Defendant had the Glock tucked in his waistband when he entered the\nvan. Around 2:00 p.m., Taylor parked a couple of blocks away from Eddie\u2019s.\nMarcia exited, walked to the liquor store and went inside. She saw a camera, and\nshe saw a clerk standing behind the counter. Marcia purchased candy, returned to\nthe van, and told defendant what she had seen. Defendant and Johnson then\nwalked towards the liquor store. Defendant had a bulge in his waistband. Within\na minute or two, there were one or two gunshots, and defendant and Johnson then\nran from the liquor store to the van. Taylor drove the group to a house in Long\nBeach to meet Iris Johnston. The drive took 20 to 30 minutes. The group stayed\nat the house for about 10 minutes. They then left with Johnston and a friend and\ndrove to defendant\u2019s residence.\n\ninvolvement in the crimes that occurred at Eddie\u2019s in exchange for her truthful\ntestimony.\n6       Wallace testified she loaned the van to Taylor in June 1997, but she did not\nrecall the date. She said she was truthful when she spoke with Detective Reynolds\non June 19. Reynolds testified Wallace told him she loaned the van to Taylor at\nabout 1:30 p.m. on June 12, and that he returned it at about 4:30 p.m. that same\nday.\n\n                                         4\n\f       Steven Miller had been sitting on a bus bench across the street from Eddie\u2019s\non June 12 when he saw two African-American men enter the liquor store.7\nShortly thereafter, Miller heard a popping sound he thought was a gunshot. He\nthen saw the same men run from the store. They ran north on Butler Avenue\napproximately two blocks and turned right onto East Marker Lane. Miller\nimmediately ran into Eddie\u2019s and saw Moon under the counter on his back,\nunconscious and bleeding. Miller telephoned the police. He described the two\nAfrican-American males as 17 to 18 years old, five feet and seven or eight inches\ntall, with short \u201cAfro style\u201d hair and \u201cthin builds.\u201d Miller added that one wore\ndark jeans and a black shirt with white stripes on the front.\n       Stephanie Johnson heard gunshots as she drove near the intersection of\nArtesia Boulevard and Butler Avenue between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m. on June 12.\nShe then saw two men running from the direction of the liquor store. One was\ndark-skinned, slim, and of medium height. He was wearing dark khaki pants and a\nblack shirt with a white shirt underneath, and his hair was curly on top and shaved\naround the bottom. Stephanie could not describe the second person or recall his\nclothing.\n       During the afternoon of June 12, Peter Motta was driving on East Marker\nLane when he saw a light-colored Plymouth Voyager, the same make and model\nas Wallace\u2019s, parked near the intersection of East Marker Lane and Butler Avenue.\nTwo African-Americans were inside, one in the driver\u2019s seat, the other in the\npassenger seat. Two men ran very fast from Butler Avenue towards the van and\n\n\n\n\n7       Miller refused to testify at trial. His observations and statements regarding\nthe attempted robbery and murder at Eddie\u2019s were admitted over a defense\nobjection through the testimony of the police officer who interviewed him shortly\nafter Moon was murdered.\n\n                                          5\n\fthen \u201cdisappear[ed].\u201d Motta noticed one was African-American, thin, and slightly\ntaller than average.\n\n                  (2) Events Immediately Following the Crimes at Eddie\u2019s\n       Long Beach Police Officers Rudy Romero and Stacey Holdredge arrived at\nEddie\u2019s at 2:08 p.m. While Romero spoke with Miller outside, Holdredge went\ninside and found Moon lying on the floor behind the counter, bleeding and\nunconscious. Moon died before the paramedics arrived.\n       Iris Johnston was acquainted with defendant, Johnson, Taylor, and Marcia.\nThe group met Johnston at the Long Beach home of one of her friends between\n1:00 and 1:30 p.m. the day Moon was killed. Johnston testified they arrived in a\nvan similar in make and model to Wallace\u2019s van. After about 10 minutes,\nJohnston and the group left in that van and drove to defendant\u2019s residence. Along\nthe way, Johnston saw helicopters overhead and asked what happened. Someone\nsaid, \u201cThere must have been a robbery.\u201d Defendant said \u201cI\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d \u201cknow [who]\ndid it.\u201d Inside defendant\u2019s residence, they watched the news on television. They\nthen walked to a store. Defendant appeared nervous when they saw a police car.\nLater, while defendant, Marcia, and Johnston were on a three-way telephone call,\ndefendant told Johnston he wanted to talk privately with Marcia. That evening,\nJohnston wrote and hand delivered a letter to defendant in which she accused him\nand the others of having committed \u201cthat little robbery in Long Beach.\u201d\n\n                  (3) Investigation\n       Police recovered a bullet from the floor near Moon\u2019s hip and a spent nine-\nmillimeter cartridge casing on the floor near the liquor shelves. There was an\nindentation in the ice cream machine in the store, which was consistent with the\ntype of mark caused by a bullet ricocheting off a hard item. The owner of Eddie\u2019s\ntestified there was no indentation on the ice cream machine prior to June 12, and\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\fnothing was missing from the cash register. Police retrieved a videotape from a\nvideocassette recorder (VCR) inside the liquor store (videotape; or liquor store or\nsurveillance videotape).\n       Los Angeles County deputy medical examiner Stephen Scholtz performed\nan autopsy on Moon\u2019s body and determined the cause of death was a gunshot to\nMoon\u2019s back. The bullet had exited through Moon\u2019s chest. Moon\u2019s right knee\nwas scuffed, and his scalp was bruised. Scholtz examined Moon\u2019s shirt visually\nand microscopically but observed no residue or soot. Scholtz examined Moon\u2019s\nentire body but found no stippling, which is the marking of skin by powered\nparticles discharged from a firearm.\n\n                  (4) Search of Defendant\u2019s Residence\n       On June 19, one week after Moon was murdered, defendant\u2019s parole officer\nand Compton police searched defendant\u2019s residence. They found a loaded Glock\nhandgun on his bedroom closet shelf, a black T-shirt with \u201cAir\u201d and a white Nike\nsymbol printed across the front, and a letter Johnston had written to defendant\ndated June 12. Defendant was arrested the same day.\n\n                  (5) Search of Johnston\u2019s Residence\n       On August 20, police searched Johnston\u2019s home and recovered a letter\ndefendant had written to her that was postmarked August 11.\n\n                  (6) Firearms Evidence\n       Riteway\u2019s owner identified the loaded Glock handgun found in defendant\u2019s\nbedroom closet as the gun that had been kept under the counter at Riteway. He\ntestified that the Glock had been under the counter on the day of the Riteway\nrobbery.\n       Robert Hawkins, a Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department crime\nlaboratory firearm examiner, examined and test fired the Glock, and he examined\n\n\n                                         7\n\fthe bullet and cartridge casing recovered from the floor at Eddie\u2019s. Hawkins\ntestified the bullet could have been fired from the Glock, but he could not be\ncertain because there were not enough markings on it. Based on markings on the\ncartridge casing, Hawkins concluded the casing had been fired from the Glock.\nHawkins examined photographs taken of Eddie\u2019s ice cream machine, and\nconcluded the indentation on its outer metal surface could have been caused by a\nbullet strike. Hawkins used a chemical process on Moon\u2019s shirt that revealed two\ngunpowder particles, each of which was within three and a half inches of the\ncenter of the entry hole on the back of the shirt. Based on those measurements,\nHawkins concluded the gun was approximately four to five feet from Moon when\nit was fired.\n\n                  (7) Physical Appearance of Defendant and Johnson\n       On June 12, defendant, an African-American, was five feet nine inches tall\nand weighed 152 pounds. On June 20, Johnson, an African-American, was six\nfeet tall and weighed 150 pounds.\n\n            2. Defense Evidence\n       Defense investigator Daniel Mendoza testified that there was a doorway but\nno door between defendant\u2019s bedroom and an adjacent spare bedroom that could\nbe accessed through the back door of the house.\n       Michael Cayton, a Long Beach Harbor Patrol officer, testified as a witness\nfor Johnson. Between 12:00 and 3:00 p.m. on June 12, Cayton was off duty and\ndriving near Eddie\u2019s when he noticed three \u201csuspicious\u201d men standing near a\nparking lot. Cayton noticed the men were dark skinned, in their early 20\u2019s, and\nbetween five feet nine inches and six feet one inch in height. One walked toward\nEddie\u2019s, one followed, and one stayed outside looking around. Two of the men\n\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\fentered the liquor store. Cayton could not identify or exclude defendant, Johnson,\nor Taylor as any of the three men he saw that day.\n\n       B. Penalty Phase\n\n            1. Prosecution Evidence\n       At the penalty phase retrial before a new jury, the prosecutor presented\nevidence similar to that presented during the guilt phase, evidence of prior crimes\ncommitted by defendant, and victim impact testimony.\n       On December 9, 1993, Cheryl Quadrelli-Jones, an assistant principal at\nAnaheim\u2019s Gilbert West High School, saw defendant leave the school and cross\nthe street towards a pedestrian pass-through that led to a nearby neighborhood.\nApproximately 100 feet from defendant, a male appeared from another pass-\nthrough. Defendant extended his arm and fired a gun at that individual. As\nQuadrelli-Jones yelled to students to get down, defendant and the male he had shot\nat left the area.\n       On January 31, 1994, defendant and two male companions approached\nBradley Turner in a parking lot at Cypress\u2019s Arnold Park. Defendant held a gun to\nTurner\u2019s head. One companion demanded Turner\u2019s wallet and then searched for it\nin Turner\u2019s car. Not finding the wallet, he said to the others, \u201cJust kill the mother\nfucker right now.\u201d Defendant and Turner then struggled, and defendant shot\nTurner in the leg. Rhonda Griffin, who was nearby, saw defendant fleeing and\ntried to chase him. She was within an arm\u2019s length of defendant when he pressed\na gun against her temple and said, \u201cDo you want some of this, you fucking bitch?\u201d\nA car filled with several other people drove up, and defendant jumped in.\nDefendant was subsequently arrested. On July 25, 1994, defendant admitted\nallegations in a juvenile petition that he committed the attempted second degree\nrobbery of Turner and assaulted Turner with a semiautomatic firearm.\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f       The victim impact evidence included testimony from family members and\nfriends regarding victim Moon\u2019s personality, his joy of life, and the effect his\ndeath had on those close to him. It also included a photo board with several\nphotographs of Moon with members of his family. We provide a detailed\nsummary of this testimony and physical evidence in conjunction with our\ndiscussion of defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by admitting much of\nthe victim impact testimony.\n\n           2. Defense Evidence\n       Defendant\u2019s mother and father were 13 and 15 years old, respectively,\nwhen defendant was born. Defendant\u2019s mother had six children with five different\nmen. She was a drug abuser, and she lost custody of defendant when he was seven\nyears old. Until then, defendant had been a \u201chappy\u201d child.\n       Defendant then lived with his paternal grandmother. When defendant was\n10 years old, his father was killed, and defendant had to identify the body. After\nthat, defendant began having behavioral problems. His paternal grandmother gave\ncustody of defendant to his maternal grandmother, who took defendant to therapy\nsessions at a church once a week for about a year. Defendant graduated from high\nschool in 1996 during his CYA commitment.\n       Arthur Gray, a senior pastor at Abundant Joy Christian Fellowship in\nInglewood, knew defendant in his early childhood. Defendant had attended\nchurch and participated in many church activities, including the choir. Defendant\nwas always pleasant, courteous, and friendly.\n       Chaplain Robert Curry met defendant at the Paso Robles CYA facility in\nabout 1995. Defendant always was willing to work, even without compensation.\nHe sang in the choir, preached, acted as a peer counselor, and inspired others.\nDefendant helped to reduce racial tensions within his unit.\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f       Deandre Brown testified that, while defendant was a ward at the Paso\nRobles CYA, he inspired Brown to believe in God and in himself. Defendant\nencouraged Brown to attend high school classes.\n       Lorraine Wahlberb, a volunteer at the Paso Robles CYA, met defendant in\n1996. She was involved in many activities with defendant. He spoke during\nchurch services and participated in church activities. Defendant often preached at\nclasses offered at the institution and positively influenced others.\n       In 1997, Lawrence Mills met defendant while teaching him at the Chino\nCYA. In 1998, defendant was returned to CYA upon violation of his parole for\nhis involvement in the instant crimes. Mills testified that defendant earned a\ntraining certificate in operating a forklift and another certificate in warehousing.\n       Defendant testified about his mother losing custody of him, his father\u2019s\ndeath, and having to identify his father\u2019s body. He added that, while living with\nhis paternal grandmother, he twice was sexually assaulted by a neighbor, whom he\ndid not identify. At age 11, defendant started to use drugs and alcohol. Later, he\nbecame interested in religion. While at various CYA facilities, defendant became\nreligious and experienced a spiritual awakening.\n       Defendant denied any involvement in the instant crimes. He said his\ngrandmothers had taught him the difference between right and wrong, and he told\nthe jury, \u201cA lot of the crimes and stuff, I\u2019m pretty much guilty of . . . , a murderer,\nI\u2019m not. I value the human life too much for me to kill a man over a dollar.\u201d\nAddressing the victim\u2019s wife, defendant said \u201cevery time I see you, hearing the\nspark that your daughter said that you had in your eyes, I got to go to . . . my cell,\nevery night and think about how your life was before Mr. Moon died. And if I\nwas to say anything, it wouldn\u2019t be sorry. It would be I wish I could change the\nhands of time. I wish I could bring him back. But I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f                                  II. DISCUSSION\n\n       A. Jury Selection Issues\n\n           1. Group Death-qualification Voir Dire\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred in failing to conduct the death-\nqualifying portion of voir dire of potential jurors individually and in sequestration\nas required by Hovey v. Superior Court (1980) 28 Cal. 3d 1. He asserts violations\nof his federal constitutional rights to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments, to a trial by an impartial jury under the Sixth Amendment, and to\nreliable guilt and penalty verdicts under the Eighth Amendment.\n       We have noted that Hovey held \u201cprospective jurors in capital cases should\nbe sequestered and questioned individually regarding their views on the death\npenalty. In 1990, the voters adopted Proposition 115, which as relevant here,\nabrogated Hovey by adding to the Code of Civil Procedure a provision stating that\n\u2018where practicable, [voir dire shall] occur in the presence of the other\n[prospective] jurors in all criminal cases, including death penalty cases.\u2019 (Code\nCiv. Proc., \u00a7 223.)\u201d (People v. Tafoya (2007) 42 Cal. 4th 147, 167.) We have\nconsistently held individual voir dire is not constitutionally required following\npassage of Proposition 115. (See, e.g., People v. Thomas (2012) 53 Cal. 4th 771,\n789; People v. Brasure (2008) 42 Cal. 4th 1037, 1050-1051.) We decline\ndefendant\u2019s request to reconsider our prior holdings.\n\n           2. Constitutionality of Death qualification Voir Dire\n       Defendant contends his death judgment must be reversed because the death\nqualification portion of jury selection is unconstitutional. The high court and this\ncourt have rejected this contention. (Lockhart v. McCree (1986) 476 U.S. 162,\n176-177; People v. Lenart (2004) 32 Cal. 4th 1107, 1120.) Defendant offers no\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fpersuasive reason to reconsider the issue as to our state constitution, and we\ndecline to do so.\n\n       B. Guilt Phase Issues\n\n           1. Steven Miller\u2019s Statements\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred in admitting the portion of Officer\nRomero\u2019s testimony that related the statements Steven Miller made outside of\nEddie\u2019s shortly after the murder. Defendant claims admission of Miller\u2019s\nstatements violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.\n\n               a. Factual and Procedural Background\n       Over a defense hearsay objection, Officer Romero testified as follows\nregarding his encounter with Miller outside Eddie\u2019s.\n       Officer Romero arrived at Eddie\u2019s within seven minutes of the 911 radio\nbroadcast. Miller was the first person he contacted. Miller appeared to be \u201cvery\nnervous,\u201d \u201cunsettled,\u201d and \u201cvery uneasy and shaken up\u201d throughout the encounter.\nMiller said, \u201cI think he\u2019s dead.\u201d Miller told Officer Romero the following. Miller\nhad been sitting on a bus bench across the street from the liquor store when he saw\ntwo African-American males go inside. Shortly afterward, Miller heard a popping\nsound he recognized as a gunshot. Miller then saw the same men run from\nEddie\u2019s, head north on Butler Avenue, and turn right onto East Marker Lane.\nMiller immediately ran into Eddie\u2019s, looked behind the counter, and saw the clerk\non his back, unconscious and bleeding. Miller called the police. In addition,\nMiller told Officer Romero both males appeared to be 17 or 18 years old, five feet\nand seven or eight inches tall, with short \u201cAfro style\u201d hair and \u201cthin builds.\u201d One\nwore dark jeans and a black shirt with white stripes on the front. The second wore\nlong dark shorts.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f       Romero radioed for police assistance. Meanwhile, Officer Holdredge,\nRomero\u2019s partner, had entered Eddie\u2019s to check on the clerk. After finding him on\nthe floor, Holdredge called for paramedics and additional police assistance.\n       Before the prosecution called Miller to the stand, counsel for Miller\ninformed the court that Miller was in custody awaiting trial in an unrelated Three\nStrikes case and that Miller intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against\nself-incrimination if called to testify. During a hearing on the matter, the parties\nindicated they were unaware of any information that would suggest Miller would\nincriminate himself if he testified in this case. Based on representations by\ncounsel that they would not try to impeach Miller based on his prior criminal\nrecord, the trial court ruled Miller did not have a right to assert the Fifth\nAmendment privilege, and advised Miller of this ruling. However, when the\nprosecution called Miller as a witness, Miller refused to answer any questions.\nThe court found Miller in contempt and unavailable to testify.\n\n                b. Discussion\n       Evidence Code section 1200, subdivision (a), provides that \u201c \u2018[h]earsay\nevidence\u2019 is evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness while\ntestifying at the hearing and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter stated.\u201d\nHearsay evidence is not admissible \u201c[e]xcept as provided by law.\u201d (Id., subd. (b).)\nMiller\u2019s statements were hearsay because they were made out of court and were\noffered for the truth of what he had told Officer Romero. Evidence Code section\n1240 provides that \u201c[e]vidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the\nhearsay rule if the statement: [\u00b6] (a) Purports to narrate, describe, or explain an\nact, condition, or event perceived by the declarant; and [\u00b6] (b) Was made\nspontaneously while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by\nsuch perception.\u201d Defendant concedes Miller\u2019s statements qualified for admission\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\funder this exception to the hearsay rule, but relying on the high court\u2019s decision in\nCrawford v. Washington (2004) 541 U.S. 36, 68 (Crawford), he contends the\nstatements were not admissible under the confrontation clause of the Sixth\nAmendment.\n       Crawford held the confrontation clause \u201cprohibits \u2018admission of testimonial\nstatements of . . . witness[es] who did not appear at trial unless [the witness] was\nunavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-\nexamination.\u2019 (Crawford, [541 U.S.] at pp. 53-54, italics added.)\u201d (People v.\nRomero (2008) 44 Cal. 4th 386, 421 (Romero).)8 Thereafter, as we noted in\nRomero, in Davis v. Washington (2006) 547 U.S. 813, the high court explained\nthat \u201c \u2018[s]tatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police\ninterrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose\nof the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\nThey are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no\nsuch ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to\nestablish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d\n(Romero, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 421.) After Crawford, the high court has\nemphasized that \u201c \u2018not all those questioned by the police are witnesses\u2019 for\npurposes of the Sixth Amendment and not all \u2018 \u201cinterrogations by law enforcement\nofficers\u201d [citation], are subject to the Confrontation Clause.\u2019 ([Michigan v.]\nBryant [(2011) 562] U.S. __ , __ ,131 S.Ct. [1143,] 1153, quoting Crawford,\n\n\n8      Although Crawford was decided after defendant\u2019s trial, while his appeal\nwas pending, the high court\u2019s ruling applies retroactively to his case. (People v.\nCage (2007) 40 Cal. 4th 965, 975 fn. 4.) Moreover, because defendant\u2019s counsel\ncould not have anticipated Crawford\u2019s sweeping changes to federal confrontation\nclause case law, he did not forfeit this claim by failing to object to the admission\nof Miller\u2019s statements on federal constitutional grounds. (People v. Pearson\n(2013) 56 Cal. 4th 393, 461-462.)\n\n                                          15\n\fsupra, 541 U.S. at p. 53.)\u201d (People v. Blacksher (2011) 52 Cal. 4th 769, 811\n(Blacksher).)\n       Based on the reasoning in Bryant, in Blacksher we identified six factors to\nconsider in determining whether statements made in the course of police\nquestioning were for the \u201c \u2018primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute\nfor trial testimony\u2019 that implicates the confrontation clause.\u201d (Blacksher, supra,\n52 Cal.4th at p. 813.) These are (1) an objective evaluation of the circumstances\nof the encounter and the statements and actions of the individuals involved in the\nencounter; (2) whether the statements were made during an ongoing emergency or\nunder circumstances that reasonably appeared to present an emergency, or were\nobtained for purposes other than for use by the prosecution at trial; (3) whether\nany actual or perceived emergency presented an ongoing threat to first responders\nor the public; (4) the declarant\u2019s medical condition; (5) whether the focus of the\ninterrogation had shifted from addressing an ongoing emergency to obtaining\nevidence for trial; and (6) the informality of the statement and the circumstances\nunder which it was obtained. (Id. at pp. 814-815.)\n       Applying Crawford to defendant\u2019s case, we conclude that Miller\u2019s\nstatements to Officer Romero were nontestimonial and that their admission did not\nviolate defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. Officer Romero was\nthe first officer to arrive at the scene, and Miller was the first person he contacted.\nMiller appeared to be very nervous and \u201cshaken up.\u201d The circumstances of the\nencounter, which took place outside a store where a shooting had recently\noccurred, reveal that Miller and Officer Romero spoke to each other in order to\ndeal with an ongoing emergency. It was objectively reasonable for Officer\nRomero to believe the suspects, one of whom presumably was still armed with a\ngun, remained at large and posed an immediate threat to officers responding to the\nshooting and the public. We are convinced that Miller\u2019s additional statements\n\n                                          16\n\fconcerning his observations and descriptions of the suspects were made for the\nprimary purpose of meeting an ongoing emergency and not to produce evidence\nfor use at a later trial. (See Romero, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 422 [statements made\nby an agitated victim of an ax attack were provided to police for the purpose of\naddressing an emergency situation and determining whether the attacker remained\nat large and presented a threat to others].)\n\n           2. Evidence that Wallace was Fearful of Testifying\n       Defendant contends the trial court erroneously admitted evidence that three\nyears prior to trial, either Johnson or his cousin accused Zonita Wallace of talking\nwith police, contending it was irrelevant. Defendant also claims the evidence was\nunduly prejudicial under Evidence Code section 352, because the jury could infer\nhis consciousness of guilt based on evidence of his association with Johnson and\nJohnson\u2019s connection to the accusation.9\n\n\n\n\n9       Here, and in most other claims, defendant contends the asserted error\nviolated various of his state and federal constitutional rights. \u201cIn most instances,\ninsofar as defendant raised the issue at all in the trial court, he failed explicitly to\nmake some or all of the constitutional arguments he now advances. In each\ninstance, unless otherwise indicated, it appears that either (1) the appellate claim is\nof a kind (e.g., failure to instruct sua sponte; erroneous instruction affecting\ndefendant\u2019s substantial rights) that required no trial court action by the defendant\nto preserve it, or (2) the new arguments do not invoke facts or legal standards\ndifferent from those the trial court itself was asked to apply, but merely assert that\nthe trial court\u2019s act or omission, insofar as wrong for the reasons actually\npresented to that court, had the additional legal consequence of violating the\nConstitution. To that extent, defendant\u2019s new constitutional arguments are not\nforfeited on appeal. [Citations.] [\u00b6] In the latter instance, of course, rejection, on\nthe merits, of a claim that the trial court erred on the issue actually before that\ncourt necessarily leads to rejection of the newly applied constitutional \u2018gloss' as\nwell. No separate constitutional discussion is required in such cases, and we\ntherefore provide none.\u201d (People v. Boyer (2006) 38 Cal. 4th 412, 441, fn. 17.)\n\n                                          17\n\f                a. Factual and Procedural Background\n       Wallace testified she dated Taylor in 1996 and 1997 and was acquainted\nwith defendant and Johnson. On the day Moon was murdered, Wallace owned a\ngray Plymouth Voyager van that had two front doors and one sliding side door.\nWallace had loaned the van to Taylor in June 1997 but did not recall the date.\n       Wallace further testified that she drove her van with Compton Police\nDetective Catherine Chavers on June 19 after her interview with Sergeant\nFrederick Reynolds but did not recall that she and Chavers drove to a gas station.\nWallace denied that while at the gas station with Chavers, she met someone whom\nshe identified as Johnson. She also denied that something occurred at the gas\nstation that caused her to be afraid.\n       Over a hearsay objection by Johnson\u2019s counsel, Sergeant Reynolds testified\nthat during the June 19 interview, Wallace said she had loaned Taylor the van the\nweek before. Reynolds testified that after the interview, he drove to a gas station\nwhere he saw Chavers with Wallace, and that Wallace appeared to be frightened.\nWithout explaining why, Wallace said she would not go to court because she was\nafraid. The trial court ruled Reynolds\u2019s testimony was admissible to explain\nWallace\u2019s failure to recall driving with Chavers to the gas station, to explain\nWallace\u2019s denials that she had identified Johnson and become frightened by\nsomething that occurred at the gas station, and to demonstrate Johnson\u2019s\nconsciousness of guilt.\n       The prosecutor then made an offer of proof that Detective Chavers would\ntestify she rode with Wallace to a gas station in Compton on June 19, that Wallace\nidentified Johnson and his cousin Michael as the two males inside a vehicle parked\nat that location, that Wallace talked with the two males while Chavers waited in\nthe van, that Chavers overheard one of the males accuse Wallace of having spoken\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fwith the police, and that Wallace denied the accusation but thereafter appeared to\nbe \u201cfrightened.\u201d\n         The prosecutor argued evidence of the accusation was admissible to show\nWallace was fearful of testifying and to demonstrate Johnson\u2019s consciousness of\nguilt. Counsel for Johnson argued that the evidence should be excluded because\nWallace was not asked on direct examination whether she was afraid to testify.\nAlso, the evidence assertedly was unduly prejudicial because there was no\nshowing that Johnson made the accusation. Defendant\u2019s counsel did not join in\nthese objections.\n         The trial court overruled Johnson\u2019s objections and admitted evidence of the\naccusation on the grounds asserted by the prosecutor. Thereafter, Detective\nChavers testified consistent with the prosecution\u2019s offer of proof that Wallace\nidentified Johnson and his cousin at the gas station, that one of the males said,\n\u201c[Wallace] had spoken to the police,\u201d and that Wallace then appeared to be\nfrightened.\n\n                 b. Discussion\n         Preliminarily, the People argue defendant forfeited this issue because he did\nnot join in Johnson\u2019s objections. \u201cA litigant need not object, however, if doing so\nwould be futile.\u201d (People v. Wilson (2008) 44 Cal. 4th 758, 793.) Here, because\ndefendant had no reasonable basis to present additional information that might\nhave altered the trial court\u2019s ruling or to object that the ruling would have caused\nhim unique prejudice, he could have reasonably believed making his own motion\nwould have been futile. We consider this contention on its merits and find no\nerror.\n         We review a trial court\u2019s rulings on the admission and exclusion of\nevidence for abuse of discretion. (People v. Guerra (2006) 37 Cal. 4th 1067, 1113\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\f(Guerra).) \u201cEvidence that a witness is afraid to testify or fears retaliation for\ntestifying is relevant to the credibility of that witness and is therefore admissible.\u201d\n(People v. Burgener (2003) 29 Cal. 4th 833, 869 (Burgener); see generally Evid.\nCode, \u00a7 780.) Evidence of any explanation of the basis for such fear is likewise\nrelevant to the jury\u2019s assessment of the witness\u2019s credibility and admissible for\nthat nonhearsay purpose, but not for the truth of any matters asserted. (Burgener,\nat p. 869.)\n        Evidence that Johnson or his companion accused Wallace of speaking with\nthe police was relevant because the jury reasonably could infer that the accusation\nwas made to persuade Wallace not to cooperate with police or testify at a trial\ninvolving the liquor store incident. The jury also reasonably could infer that the\naccusation frightened Wallace and affected her testimony. Here, where Wallace\n\u201cprofessed inability to remember her previous statements [and gave] equivocal\nresponses to many of the prosecutor\u2019s questions, . . . the trial court did not abuse\nits discretion in determining that evidence of her fear in testifying was relevant to\nthe jury\u2019s assessment of her credibility.\u201d (People v. Valdez (2012) 55 Cal. 4th 82,\n137.)\n        Defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary, the accusation was admissible although\nit occurred more than three years before Wallace testified. Wallace\u2019s testimony\nwas riddled with claimed memory failures and evasive and inconsistent responses,\nmany of which related to events that occurred the day the accusation was made.\nWallace\u2019s professed inability to remember her prior statements and her equivocal\nresponses could be explained by her fear of retaliation for testifying and that fear\ncould have reasonably originated from the accusation Detective Chavers\noverheard.\n        We conclude the accusation was admissible against defendant\nnotwithstanding the lack of evidence linking the statement to him. \u201cFor such\n\n                                          20\n\fevidence to be admissible, there is no requirement to show threats against the\nwitness were made by the defendant personally or the witness\u2019s fear of retaliation\nis \u2018directly linked\u2019 to the defendant.\u201d (Guerra, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 1142.)\nBecause \u201c[i]t is not necessarily the source of the threat \u2014 but its existence \u2014 that\nis relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility\u201d (Burgener, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 870), the\nevidence similarly was not excludable on the ground that Chavers was unable to\ndiscern whether Johnson or his cousin made the accusation.\n       Citing Evidence Code section 352, defendant next contends admission of\nevidence of the accusation to show Johnson\u2019s consciousness of guilt was unduly\nprejudicial to him because the testimony implied his consciousness of guilt\nalthough no evidence connected him to the accusation. Defendant, however, did\nnot object to the evidence on this specific ground at trial, did not join in Johnson\u2019s\nobjection on this ground, and did not request a limiting instruction on the ground\nthat the evidence was admissible as to Johnson but not him. The issue is therefore\nforfeited. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 353, subd. (a) [an objection to the assertedly\nerroneous admission of evidence must be timely and specific], 355 [when\nevidence is admissible for one purpose and inadmissible for another, \u201cthe court\nupon request shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury\naccordingly\u201d].) Because such a specific objection could have prevented the\nasserted prejudice and nothing suggests it would have been futile for defendant to\nobject on this specific ground in the trial court, this claim is forfeited on appeal.\n(People v. Duran (1976) 16 Cal. 3d 282, 289; People v. Wilson, supra, 44 Cal.4th\nat p. 793.)\n       Even if this claim were preserved, it has no merit. Neither the evidence nor\nthe prosecutor suggested the accusation was evidence of defendant\u2019s\nconsciousness of guilt. Defendant\u2019s speculation that the jury might have\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fconnected the evidence to him does not establish that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in admitting evidence of the accusation.\n\n           3. Marcia Johnson\u2019s Statements to Detective Edwards\n       Defendant contends the trial court erroneously permitted Detective Paul\nEdwards to testify that during his interview with Marcia, Marcia said that the night\nbefore the murder, defendant had told her he had been to the liquor store before\nand saw only one clerk inside, an old man. This claim is without merit.\n\n               a. Factual and Procedural Background\n       On direct examination, Marcia testified that when she met with defendant,\nJohnson, and Taylor at her home the morning of the murder, defendant told the\ngroup about his plans to rob Eddie\u2019s. He said he wanted Marcia to go inside, look\nfor cameras, and determine how many clerks were working. Defendant said\nTaylor would drive, and Johnson would enter the liquor store with defendant.\nOnly defendant spoke, and no one objected. Marcia testified she had not been to\nthe liquor store or heard of it before that morning.\n       During cross-examination, defendant\u2019s counsel asked about specific\ndiscrepancies in Marcia\u2019s statements to Detective Edwards regarding the planning\nof the robbery. Marcia testified she initially told Edwards that she, Johnson and\nTaylor \u201cscoped out\u201d the liquor store on the morning of the crimes. Asked whether\nshe had mentioned to Edwards that defendant was involved, Marcia admitted she\ndid not include defendant in that version of the events. Counsel asked whether\nEdwards told Marcia he did not believe her, and had suggested the planning had\noccurred the night before. Marcia testified Edwards did so, and that she then told\nEdwards the group met the night before but had not discussed a plan to rob the\nliquor store at that time. Counsel then asked whether she recalled telling Edwards\nthat during the night meeting, defendant \u201ccame to me and told me that he needed\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\fme to do something and he needed me to go to the store and go buy, go check out\nand see how many people was in there and to buy something. He said he needed\nthe money. He was going to rob a liquor store.\u201d Marcia then testified she recalled\ntelling Edwards this, but testified the conversation did not relate to any plans to\nrob Eddie\u2019s.\n       Thereafter, Detective Edwards testified that when he interviewed Marcia,\nshe initially told him that on the morning of the crimes, she, Taylor, and Johnson\ndrove to the liquor store in a brown Cutlass. After Edwards said he did not believe\nher, Marcia told Edwards defendant accompanied them to the store and that they\ndrove there in Wallace\u2019s van. After Edwards said he believed the planning had\noccurred the night before, Marcia agreed and told Edwards the foursome met at\nher house the night before. She added that defendant said he had been to the store\non a prior occasion and saw only one clerk, an old man, inside.\n       Defendant\u2019s counsel objected that Marcia\u2019s statement that defendant had\nsaid he had previously been to the store was inadmissible hearsay, but the trial\ncourt ruled the statement was admissible to impeach Marcia\u2019s testimony and for its\ntruth under the prior inconsistent statements exception to the hearsay rule. The\ncourt reasoned the statement was inconsistent with Marcia\u2019s direct testimony\nbecause Marcia did not mention it when the prosecutor asked about the statements\ndefendant had made when he discussed his plans to rob the liquor store. The court\nthen informed the parties that, although it had excused Marcia from giving further\ntestimony, it would permit counsel to recall her to give her an opportunity to\nexplain or deny the statement, as required under Evidence Code section 770.\nMarcia was not recalled to testify.\n\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\f               b. Discussion\n       \u201cA statement by a witness that is inconsistent with his or her trial testimony\nis admissible to establish the truth of the matter asserted in the statement under the\nconditions set forth in Evidence Code sections 1235 and 770.\u201d (People v. Johnson\n(1992) 3 Cal. 4th 1183, 1219.)10 Defendant contends Marcia\u2019s statement to\nDetective Edwards regarding what defendant told her about his prior visit to the\nliquor store was not admissible as a prior inconsistent statement because the\nprosecutor did not question Marcia specifically regarding whether defendant had\npreviously been there. We need not decide the correctness of the trial court\u2019s\nruling as to whether this particular statement of Marcia\u2019s was inconsistent with her\ntrial testimony on that point. Marcia impliedly acknowledged to Edwards that she\nhad heard of the liquor store the night before the murder when she told Edwards\nthe group met that night and defendant told them he had gone to the store on a\nprior occasion and observed the lone clerk. On direct examination, however,\nMarcia denied she had \u201cever heard of Eddie\u2019s Liquor Store before [the morning of\nthe crimes].\u201d In effect, Marcia\u2019s prior statement to Edwards was inconsistent with\nthat testimony as to when she first heard of Eddie\u2019s and therefore was admissible\nunder Evidence Code section 1235.11 (See People v. Cowan (2010) 50 Cal. 4th\n\n\n10      Section 1235 of the Evidence Code provides: \u201cEvidence of a statement\nmade by a witness is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement is\ninconsistent with his testimony at the hearing and is offered in compliance with\nSection 770.\u201d Evidence Code section 770 provides: \u201cUnless the interests of\njustice otherwise require, extrinsic evidence of a statement made by a witness that\nis inconsistent with any part of his testimony at the hearing shall be excluded\nunless: [\u00b6] (a) The witness was so examined while testifying as to give him an\nopportunity to explain or to deny the statement; or [\u00b6] (b) The witness has not been\nexcused from giving further testimony in the action.\u201d\n11      Marcia\u2019s hearsay statement to Edwards consisted of double hearsay because\nit also included an out-of-court statement by defendant offered for its truth.\nDefendant\u2019s statement was admissible because it qualified under the hearsay\nexception for a party admission (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1220). (See People v. Williams\n\n                                          24\n\f401, 462 [test for whether a witness\u2019s prior statement is inconsistent with prior\ntestimony is whether the statement is inconsistent in effect rather than an express\ncontradiction of terms].) Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in admitting Marcia\u2019s statements to Detective Edwards.12\n\n           4. Adoptive Admission\n       Defendant contends testimony regarding a letter Iris Johnston wrote to\ndefendant was erroneously admitted under the hearsay exception for adoptive\nadmissions. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1221.) Defendant also claims the Compton Police\nDepartment violated his due process rights and right to present a defense by failing\nto preserve his letter to Johnston in violation of California v. Trombetta (1984)\n467 U.S. 479, 485-490 (Trombetta).\n\n                a. Factual and Procedural Background\n       Over defendant\u2019s objection, Iris Johnston testified she hand delivered a\nletter to defendant the evening of the murder in which she accused him of\ncommitting a robbery at the liquor store. A redacted version of her letter that\nomitted express or implied references to Johnson and Taylor was admitted into\nevidence. The redacted letter read as follows: \u201c6-12-97 [\u00b6] Dear Dein, [\u00b6]\nWhat\u2019s up? Nothing much this way, just chillin in my room being bored, I want to\ntell you a little something! First of all I wanted to say I have a little idea that you\nguys did that little robbery in Long Beach, because ya\u2019ll ran to the T.V. to watch\nthe news and than when ya\u2019ll seen the helicopters ya\u2019ll was like, \u2018yeah, we know\nthe [guys] that did that. So I had a little ideal that ya\u2019ll did something and than\nwhen we was walking home ya\u2019ll was getting all nervous when a police car would\n\n(1997) 16 Cal. 4th 153, 199, fn. 3 [multiple hearsay is admissible provided that\neach hearsay level falls within a hearsay exception].)\n12    Although our theory of admissibility differs from that of the trial court, \u201cwe\nreview the ruling, not the court\u2019s reasoning, and, if the ruling was correct on any\nground, we affirm.\u201d (People v. Geier (2007) 41 Cal. 4th 595, 582.)\n\n                                           25\n\fpass by. Another idea I have is when we was on the phone together watching the\nnews, you was all telling me to talk, until they showed that part about the robbery.\nI was like hello, you was like \u2018you can\u2019t talk while I\u2019m watching the news. I was\nsaying to my self they must of did it, that\u2019s why I got off the phone with you. And\nthen when we was on the phone (Marcia, me, you) and ya\u2019ll was like ya\u2019ll need to\ntell each other something and ya\u2019ll didn\u2019t want me to hear. [\u00b6] Will all I am\ntrying to say is that I don\u2019t want us going any further than what we already are,\nbecause if we go to gether and you get caught doing what ever the fuck you be\ndoing, I\u2019m just going to be ass out! Will just get back at me whenever! . . . P.S.\nDon\u2019t be afriad to tell me something! [\u00b6] Much [heart symbol], [\u00b6] Iris.\u201d\n       Defendant did not read the letter in Johnston\u2019s presence. There is no\nevidence that he responded to it or discussed it with Johnston. Johnston did not\nspeak with defendant until several years later, within months of her testimony at\ntrial. During the search of defendant\u2019s residence one week after the shooting,\npolice found the letter on his bedroom dresser.\n       Sergeant Reynolds testified that while searching Johnston\u2019s home on\nAugust 20, police found a handwritten letter from defendant to Johnston dated\nAugust 11. Reynolds booked defendant\u2019s letter into evidence at the Compton\nPolice Department but did not note its contents in any report. Reynolds testified\nhe was unable to locate defendant\u2019s letter because it was apparently misplaced\nwhen the Compton Police Department moved its evidence storage to a Los\nAngeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department facility.\n       The prosecutor sought to admit Johnston\u2019s letter as an implied admission\nby defendant that he had committed the attempted robbery because he failed to\nrespond to that letter. Defense counsel objected that there was no foundation for\nadmitting Johnston\u2019s letter because there was no evidence defendant had read it,\nand, alternatively, that the letter was inadmissible because defendant may have\n\n                                         26\n\fdenied Johnston\u2019s accusation in his letter that law enforcement lost. The trial\ncourt admitted Johnston\u2019s letter into evidence, reasoning it was sufficiently\naccusatory to prompt a response from defendant and that none had been given.\nThe court rejected as speculative the assertion by defendant\u2019s counsel that\ndefendant may have denied the accusation in his letter to Johnston.\n\n               b. Johnston\u2019s Accusation\n       \u201c[A] trial court has broad discretion to determine whether a party has\nestablished the foundational requirements for a hearsay exception [citation] and\n\u2018[a] ruling on the admissibility of evidence implies whatever finding of fact is\nprerequisite thereto . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] We review the trial court\u2019s conclusions\nregarding foundational facts for substantial evidence. [Citation.]\u201d (People v.\nDeHoyos (2013) 57 Cal. 4th 79, 132.)\n       Johnston\u2019s letter constituted hearsay because the prosecution offered it as\nan out-of-court statement to prove that defendant did admit that he committed\n\u201cthat little robbery in Long Beach.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200.) The prosecutor sought\nadmission of Johnston\u2019s letter under the adoptive admission hearsay exception. In\nsupport of that theory of admissibility, the prosecution introduced evidence that\nJohnston delivered her letter to defendant shortly after the crimes occurred, its\ncontents were accusatory, defendant did not respond to Johnston\u2019s letter, that letter\nwas found in his bedroom a week after Johnston delivered it, and he wrote a letter\nto Johnston two months later.\n       \u201c \u2018Evidence of a statement offered against a party is not made inadmissible\nby the hearsay rule if the statement is one of which the party, with knowledge of\nthe content thereof, has by words or other conduct manifested his adoption or his\nbelief in its truth.\u2019 (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1221.) Under this provision, \u2018[i]f a person is\naccused of having committed a crime, under circumstances which fairly afford\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fhim an opportunity to hear, understand, and to reply, and which do not lend\nthemselves to an inference that he was relying on the right of silence guaranteed\nby the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and he fails to speak, or\nhe makes an evasive or equivocal reply, both the accusatory statement and the fact\nof silence or equivocation may be offered as an implied or adoptive admission of\nguilt.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Riel (2000) 22 Cal. 4th 1153, 1189.)\n       While the letter was plainly accusatory and would call for a response if the\naccusations were untrue and were known to defendant, there is no evidence of the\ncircumstances under which defendant read the letter, if he had done so, and there\nis no evidence of defendant\u2019s reaction upon reading it. There was no showing\nthat, by words or conduct, defendant manifested his adoption of, or belief in, the\ncontents of Johnston\u2019s letter. Defendant\u2019s mere possession of it is insufficient to\nsatisfy this requirement. (See, e.g., People v. Lewis (2008) 43 Cal. 4th 415, 499\n[evidence of the defendant\u2019s possession of drawings that purportedly bore his\nnickname and indicated he identified with the Penal Code section for robbery and\nconsidered himself a menace to society was insufficient to support a finding that\nhe manifested a belief in what the drawings depicted].) We conclude the trial\ncourt erred in admitting Johnston\u2019s letter under the adoptive admissions hearsay\nexception. Additionally, because there was no properly admitted evidence of an\nadoptive admission, the trial court erred in instructing the jury on adoptive\nadmissions under CALJIC No. 2.71.5.\n       Defendant argues his death judgment should be reversed because the\nprosecutor assertedly exploited the error in admitting the evidence during\nargument by stressing the evidence was critical to the People\u2019s case whether it was\nconsidered for its substance as an implied admission by defendant or as proof of\nwhat occurred. Also, the error assertedly reduced the prosecution\u2019s burden of\nproof of all elements of the capital charges in violation of his constitutional rights\n\n                                          28\n\fby \u201cfilling in holes in [its] case \u2014 the identity of the perpetrators and\ncorroboration of Marcia Johnson\u2019s testimony.\u201d\n       We find the argument unpersuasive. As explained below, we are satisfied\nthe jury reasonably did not consider the contents of the letter for their truth. Also,\nthe court instructed the jury that statements made by counsel are not evidence.\n(CALJIC No. 1.02.) Therefore, the erroneous admission of the evidence was\nharmless. (People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal. 2d 818, 836 (Watson); see People v.\nCoffman and Marlow (2004) 34 Cal. 4th 1, 76 [erroneous admission of evidence at\nthe guilt phase is reviewed under Watson standard].) In addition, because the\nletter lacked substantive value, its erroneous admission had no impact on the\nprosecution\u2019s burden of proof, and therefore the error was not of constitutional\ndimension.\n       Defendant nonetheless contends that the error and prejudice in the\nadmission of Johnston\u2019s letter as an adoptive admission was exacerbated by the\ntrial court\u2019s error in instructing the jury with CALJIC No. 2.71.5. Assertedly, the\ninstructional error reduced the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof, in violation of his\nconstitutional rights to due process, trial by an impartial jury, and a reliable death\nverdict.\n       CALJIC No. 2.71.5 as given informed the jury that \u201c[i]f you should find\nfrom the evidence that there was an occasion when a defendant: one, under\nconditions which reasonably afforded him an opportunity to reply; two, failed to\nmake a denial in the face of an accusation expressed directly to him, or in his\npresence charging him with the crime for which this defendant now is on trial, or\ntending to connect him with this commission, and; three, that he heard the\naccusation and understood its nature, then the circumstance of his silence on that\noccasion may be considered against him as indicating an admission that the\naccusation thus made was true. [\u00b6] Evidence of an accusatory statement is not\n\n                                          29\n\freceived for the purpose of proving its truth, but only as it supplies meaning to a\nsilence of the accused in the face of it. [\u00b6] Unless you find that a defendant\u2019s\nsilence at the time indicated an admission that the accusatory statement was true,\nyou must entirely disregard his statement.\u201d\n       Under this instruction, the jury could consider evidence of the letter to infer\nan admission by defendant that Johnston\u2019s accusations were true only if it found\npreliminarily that defendant read her letter, understood its contents to be an\naccusation that he committed the liquor store robbery, and was reasonably\nafforded an opportunity to deny the accusation but failed to do so. As discussed\nabove, we concluded the evidence was insufficient to establish these predicate\nfacts. In addition, the jury was instructed under CALJIC No. 17.31 to disregard an\ninstruction that applies to facts determined not to exist. We presume the jury\nfollowed the instructions it was given. (Guerra, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 1115.)\nUnder these circumstances, the jury reasonably accorded no weight to the\nevidence. (See People v. Guiton (1993) 4 Cal. 4th 1116, 1127 [\u201cIn analyzing the\nprejudicial effect of error, . . . an appellate court does not assume an unreasonable\njury.\u201d].) Moreover, because the instruction had no application to the facts alleged\nin the letter, defendant\u2019s claim that the instructional error reduced the\nprosecution\u2019s burden of proof is without merit. For these reasons, we conclude the\nerror in instructing the jury under CALJIC No. 2.71.5 was harmless. (Watson,\nsupra, 46 Cal.2d at p. 836; see People v. Beltran (2013) 56 Cal. 4th 935, 955\n[\u201c \u2018 \u201c[m]isdirection of the jury, including incorrect, ambiguous, conflicting, or\nwrongly omitted instructions that do not amount to federal constitutional error are\nreviewed under the harmless error standard articulated\u201d in Watson \u2019 \u201d].)\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f               c. Loss of Defendant\u2019s Letter to Johnston\n       Defendant contends that law enforcement committed prejudicial error in\nfailing to disclose to the defense the contents of defendant\u2019s letter to Johnston and\nthat law enforcement\u2019s subsequent loss or destruction of his letter violated his\nrights to present a defense and to due process pursuant Arizona v. Youngblood\n(1988) 488 U.S. 51, 58, and Trombetta, supra, 467 U.S. at pages 488-489.\n       \u201c \u2018 \u201cLaw enforcement agencies have a duty, under the due process clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, to preserve evidence \u2018that might be expected to play a\nsignificant role in the suspect\u2019s defense.\u2019 [Citations.] To fall within the scope of\nthis duty, the evidence \u2018must both possess an exculpatory value that was apparent\nbefore the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant\nwould be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available\nmeans.\u2019 [Citations.] The state\u2019s responsibility is further limited when the\ndefendant\u2019s challenge is to \u2018the failure of the State to preserve evidentiary material\nof which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the\nresults of which might have exonerated the defendant.\u2019 [Citation.] In such case,\n\u2018unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to\npreserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of\nlaw.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Farnam (2002) 28 Cal. 4th 107, 166.)\n       Defendant did not raise this issue in the trial court. His due process claim\nunder Trombetta is of a type that requires a trial court to consider additional facts\nand apply a legal standard different than that applied in ruling on a hearsay\nobjection. (See People v. Boyer, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 441, fn. 17.) Therefore,\nthe trial court\u2019s ruling that Johnston\u2019s letter was admissible as an adoptive\nadmission would not have necessarily led to a rejection of the claim that defendant\nwas denied due process of law because law enforcement had misplaced his letter\nto Johnston. (Ibid.) Accordingly, we conclude defendant\u2019s Trombetta claim is\n\n\n                                          31\n\fforfeited because defendant failed to raise the issue below. (People v. Duran,\nsupra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 289.)\n       In any event, the claim is without merit. Defendant has not shown that his\nletter had \u201c \u2018an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was\ndestroyed [or lost].\u2019 \u201d (People v Pastor Cruz (1993) 16 Cal. App. 4th 322, 325.)\nAssuming defendant\u2019s letter to Johnston potentially was useful to his defense,\nnothing in the record suggests it was lost due to bad faith on the part of law\nenforcement, and its absence \u201cdid not deny defendant all opportunity \u2018to obtain\ncomparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Thomas\n(2012) 54 Cal. 4th 908, 929, quoting Trombetta, supra, 467 U.S at p. 489.)\nDefendant was able to cross-examine Johnston on the issue and, had he chosen to\ndo so, he could have testified to the nature of his letter to Johnston. \u201cThere is no\nconstitutional infirmity in the circumstance that if defendant had wanted to expand\non the information presented by [the contents of Johnston\u2019s letter,] and . . . by\ntestifying himself, he might have been put in the position of choosing between his\nright to testify at the trial and his right to remain silent. \u2018 \u201c \u2018The criminal process .\n. . is replete with situations requiring the \u201cmaking of difficult judgments\u201d as to\nwhich course to follow. [Citation.] Although a defendant may have a right, even\nof constitutional dimensions, to follow whichever course he chooses, the\nConstitution does not by that token always forbid requiring him to choose.\u2019 \u201d\n[Citations.]\u2019 (People v. Letner and Tobin (2010) 50 Cal. 4th 99, 153.)\u201d (Thomas,\nsupra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 929, fn. 5.)\n\n           5. Accomplice Corroboration\n       The trial court instructed the jury that Marcia was an accomplice as a matter\nof law. Defendant contends his first degree murder and attempted robbery\nconvictions and the attempted robbery felony-murder special-circumstance finding\n\n\n\n                                           32\n\fmust be reversed because they were based on Marcia\u2019s uncorroborated testimony.\nThe contention is without merit.\n       Section 1111 provides: \u201cA conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of\nan accomplice unless it be corroborated by such other evidence as shall tend to\nconnect the defendant with the commission of the offense . . . .\u201d \u201c \u2018Corroborating\nevidence may be slight, may be entirely circumstantial, and need not be sufficient\nto establish every element of the charged offense.\u2019 [Citation.] The evidence is\n\u2018sufficient if it tends to connect the defendant with the crime in such a way as to\nsatisfy the jury that the accomplice is telling the truth.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Gonzales and\nSoliz (2011) 52 Cal. 4th 254, 303.)\n       Marcia testified as follows. On the morning of the crimes, defendant\narrived at her house wearing a black and white Nike Air T-shirt and black jeans,\nwith a Glock tucked in the waistband. Defendant articulated his plan to rob the\nliquor store to Marcia, Johnson, and Taylor and assigned each a task. Marcia\nidentified Wallace\u2019s van as the one Taylor used to drive them. Defendant had the\nGlock in his waistband when he left the house and entered the van. Taylor parked\na couple of blocks from the store. Marcia got out and walked to the store. Once\ninside, she looked around, bought some candy, and returned to the van. Marcia\ninformed defendant that inside the store there were two cameras and one clerk.\nShe got in the van, and defendant and Johnson got out. Defendant had a bulge in\nhis waistband as he walked with Johnson toward the liquor store. After she heard\na gunshot, she watched as defendant and Johnson ran to the van. They both\nreentered the van. Taylor then drove to a house in Long Beach where the group\nmet Johnston.\n       Marcia\u2019s testimony was sufficiently corroborated by other evidence\nconnecting defendant to the attempted robbery and the murder at Eddie\u2019s.\nDefendant stole the murder weapon during the Riteway robbery, and the loaded\n\n                                         33\n\fmurder weapon was found in defendant\u2019s bedroom closet one week after the\nmurder. Eddie\u2019s surveillance videotape shows two African-American men\nentering and leaving the liquor store at the time of the crime, and defendant is\nAfrican-American. One of the men wore a black T-shirt with a large white Air\nNike logo on the front, and police found a similar shirt in defendant\u2019s bedroom\none week after the crimes. Additionally, evidence that defendant participated in\nthe robbery of the Riteway clerk in which a gun was used reasonably supports an\ninference that defendant intended to rob the clerk working at Eddie\u2019s when\ndefendant shot him with the Glock stolen from Riteway.\n       We conclude the record contains more than ample evidence that\ncorroborates Marcia\u2019s testimony and supports defendant\u2019s convictions for first\ndegree murder and attempted robbery, as well as for the attempted robbery felony-\nmurder special-circumstance finding. Even if, as defendant asserts, section 1111\ncreates a \u201cliberty interest\u201d under Hicks v. Oklahoma (1980) 447 U.S. 343, his\nfederal constitutional right to due process were not violated based on\nuncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.\n\n           6. Still Photographs from the Liquor Store Videotape\n       Defendant contends that the trial court erred prejudicially in admitting two\nstill photographs that were printed from the liquor store videotape using\nequipment at Aerospace Corporation (Aerospace). Assertedly, the photographs\nwere enhanced and the prosecution failed to lay a proper foundation. The\ncontention is without merit.\n\n               a. Factual background\n       Officer Holdredge testified that she arrived at Eddie\u2019s within minutes after\nthe shooting, that she viewed the surveillance videotape police obtained at the\ncrime scene, and that it accurately portrayed what occurred when she, Officer\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\fRomero, and Miller were inside the store. Long Beach Police Sergeant Jorge\nCisneros testified that he viewed the videotape at the police station and identified\nPeople\u2019s exhibits Nos. 43A and 43B as the two still photographs that were printed\nfrom the videotape using equipment at the police station. He explained that the\nheads and necks of the subjects shown on the film were not visible on the still\nprints because the VCR \u201cdid not display the entire picture on the film,\u201d that is, the\n\u201ctop and bottom\u201d portions of the film (i.e., margins) were not visible.\n       Sergeant Cisneros went to Aerospace and requested that still photographs\nbe printed from the videotape. He remained at Aerospace and watched one of its\nemployees insert the videotape in a VCR that was connected to a computer, a\nmonitor, and a printer. Cisneros described the Aerospace monitor as having a\nlarger screen than the one used at the police station to view the videotape.\nAccording to Cisneros, when the videotape was played, \u201cthe picture of what was\non that video tape did appear on the computer screen\u201d and it showed \u201cthe full\nlength of the film on the VCR,\u201d including the images recorded in the margins of\nthe film. He pointed to the frames he wanted printed, and the employee printed\nthe stills (People\u2019s exhibits Nos. 41 and 42). Cisneros testified that the difference\nbetween the images that were shown on the photographs printed using the\nequipment at the police station and those shown on the photographs printed using\nthe Aerospace equipment was that the latter showed defendant\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s\nheads and necks, whereas the former did not. Cisneros said that Aerospace\npersonnel informed him that \u201cthey could not do any enhancements to the video.\n[B]ut we did get, like I said, we could see more of the film, I believe because of\nthe [equipment] we were using.\u201d Cisneros did not \u201cask that any of the action [on\nthe videotape] be altered.\u201d In ruling the evidence was admissible, the trial court\nfound that \u201cAerospace equipment [could] show the whole frame, [that] the Long\n\n\n\n                                         35\n\fBeach Police Department [could] only show a portion,\u201d and that the photographs\nhad not been enhanced.\n\n                b. Discussion\n       \u201cNo photograph or film has any value in the absence of a proper\nfoundation. It is necessary to know when it was taken and that it is accurate and\ntruly represents what it purports to show. It becomes probative only upon the\nassumption that it is relevant and accurate.\u201d (People v. Bowley (1963) 59 Cal. 2d\n855, 862 (Bowley).) The general rule is that a photograph is admissible upon a\nshowing that it accurately depicts what it purportedly shows. (Ibid; see Evid.\nCode, \u00a7\u00a7 250 [a photograph is a \u201cwriting\u201d], 1400 [\u201cAuthentication of a writing\nmeans (a) the introduction of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the\nwriting that the proponent of the evidence claims it is or (b) the establishment of\nsuch facts by any other means provided by law.\u201d].) \u201cThis is usually shown by the\ntestimony of the one who took the picture. However, this is not necessary and it is\nwell settled that the showing may be made by the testimony of anyone who knows\nthat the picture correctly depicts what it purports to represent.\u201d (People v. Doggett\n(1948) 83 Cal. App. 2d 405, 409; see Bowley, supra, 59 Cal.2d at pp. 860-861\n[citing Doggett with approval].)\n       Evidence Code section 1553, subdivision (a), establishes a rebuttable\npresumption that \u201c[a] printed representation of images stored on a video or digital\nmedium is presumed to be an accurate representation of the images it purports to\nrepresent.\u201d The presumption affects the burden of proof and is rebutted by a\nshowing that the \u201cprinted representation of images stored on [the] video or digital\nmedium is inaccurate or unreliable.\u201d (Ibid.) The burden then shifts to the\nproponent of the printed representation to prove by a preponderance of evidence\nthat it accurately represents the existence and content of the images on the video or\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fdigital medium. (Ibid.) If the proponent of the evidence fails to carry his burden\nof showing the printed representation accurately depicts what it purportedly\nshows, the evidence is inadmissible for lack of adequate foundation. (Bowley,\nsupra, 59 Cal.2d at pp. 860-861.)\n       Once properly authenticated and admitted into evidence, a photograph may\nbe used as demonstrative evidence to support a witness\u2019s testimony or as probative\nevidence of what is shown. (Bowley, supra, 59 Cal.2d at pp. 860-861.) A trial\ncourt\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence of photographs will not be disturbed\non appeal absent an abuse of discretion. (People v. Rountree (2013) 56 Cal. 4th\n823, 852.)\n       Here, the still photographs were properly authenticated and admitted into\nevidence. Officer Holdredge viewed the videotape police retrieved from the VCR\nat the crime scene and testified it accurately depicted her conduct and that of\nOfficer Romero and Miller inside the store immediately after the shooting. Thus,\nthe videotape was shown to be an accurate representation of what it purported to\nbe, a recording of the events that occurred inside Eddie\u2019s at or near the time of the\nshooting.\n       In addition, Sergeant Cisneros testified that that the still photographs\nprinted at Aerospace depicted the images stored on the videotape that Officer\nHoldredge authenticated. He explained that the Aerospace photographs depicted\nthe suspects\u2019 heads and necks because the company\u2019s equipment could print the\nportion of the recorded images stored in the margins of the videotape, whereas the\nequipment used at the police station could not. Under these circumstances, we\nconclude the prosecution established that the photographs printed at Aerospace\ndepicted the images recorded on the videotape, and therefore were presumed to be\naccurate representations of those images. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1553.) Defendant\u2019s mere\nspeculation that the photographs were manipulated or enhanced could not rebut\n\n                                         37\n\fthis presumption. For these reasons, we conclude the photographs were\nadequately authenticated, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\nadmitting them.\n\n           7. Evidence of the Riteway Robbery\n       Defendant claims the trial court committed prejudicial error when, despite\ndefendant\u2019s willingness to plead guilty to the Riteway robbery and stipulate he\nobtained the gun used in the capital crime in that robbery, the court cross-admitted\nevidence of the Riteway robbery to prove defendant was guilty of the charged\nattempted robbery and murder at Eddie\u2019s. Defendant alternatively claims the trial\ncourt prejudicially erred in failing to give its promised limiting instruction on the\nother crimes evidence.\n\n               a. Factual and Procedural Background\n       Before any evidence was introduced, the prosecutor made a motion to\npermit the jury to consider evidence of the Riteway robbery on the capital charges.\nShe argued the evidence was relevant to show defendant, Johnson, and Taylor\nacted pursuant to a common plan or scheme and entered Eddie\u2019s with the intent to\nrob. Defendant offered to plead guilty to the Riteway robbery and to stipulate he\nobtained the gun used in the capital crime in that robbery. Defendant\u2019s plea offer\nwas conditioned on the trial court finding that the Riteway robbery evidence was\nnot admissible under Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b). Counsel\nfurther argued any evidence regarding the Riteway robbery other than the fact of a\nguilty plea to that robbery charge and a stipulation about the gun would be\ninadmissible because it would be unduly prejudicial under Evidence Code section\n352.\n       The court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion, ruling that evidence of the\nRiteway robbery was relevant to prove intent and knowledge with regard to the\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\fcapital charges under section (b) of Evidence Code section 1101, and that the\nevidence was not unduly prejudicial within the meaning of Evidence Code section\n352. In response to that ruling, defendant withdrew his plea offer, and the trial\ncourt informed the parties that it would give an instruction as to defendant and\nJohnson on the purposes for which the jury could and could not consider the\nRiteway robbery evidence with regard to the liquor store charges. Prior to\ndeliberations, the court gave a limiting instruction only as to Johnson that\ninformed the jury it could consider the evidence on the issues of intent, identity,\ncommon plan, and knowledge.\n\n                b. Discussion\n       We first consider whether the trial court erred in admitting the Riteway\nrobbery evidence to prove defendant\u2019s involvement in the liquor stores crimes.\n       \u201cUnless evidence is admitted for a limited purpose, or against a specific\nparty, evidence admitted at trial may generally be considered for any purpose. A\ncorollary of this rule is that the jury is free to apply its factual findings on one\ncount in deciding any other count to which those facts are relevant.\u201d (People v.\nVillatoro (2012) 54 Cal. 4th 1152, 1170, fn. omitted.) \u201cOne example of limited\nadmissibility arises in the context of other crimes evidence. Evidence of a\nperson\u2019s character, also known as propensity evidence, is inadmissible to prove\nconduct in conformity with that character trait. [Citations.] This is the familiar\nban on propensity evidence: [Evidence of other crimes] generally cannot be\nadmitted to prove the defendant is disposed to commit crimes. [Evidence Code]\n[s]ection 1101 [, subdivision] (a) codifies this general rule. Notwithstanding that\nrule, [Evidence Code] section 1101, subdivision (b) . . . clarifies that [other crimes\nevidence] can be admitted for other relevant purposes, such as proving motive,\n\n\n\n\n                                           39\n\fopportunity, intent, and so on, but they may not be admitted to prove the defendant\nhad a disposition to commit similar bad acts.\u201d (Id. at pp., 1170-1171, fn. omitted.)\n        \u201cEvidence of identity is admissible where it is conceded or assumed that the\ncharged offense was committed by someone, in order to prove that the defendant\nwas the perpetrator.\u201d (People v. Ewoldt (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 380, 394, fn. 2.) The\nadmissibility of other crimes evidence for this purpose \u201cturns on proof that the\n[incidents] share sufficient distinctive common features to raise an inference of\nidentity.\u201d (People v. Lindberg (2008) 45 Cal. 4th 1, 23, italics added.) We have\noften commented that \u201c \u2018[t]he pattern and characteristics of the crimes must be so\nunusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.\u2019 \u201d (Ewoldt, supra, 7 Cal.4th at p.\n403.)\n        Here, the evidence established that defendant, an African-American male,\nstole a Glock handgun during the Riteway robbery, and that the same Glock was\nused to shoot and kill Moon at Eddie\u2019s one month after the Riteway robbery. The\nevidence further established that the same stolen Glock was found loaded in\ndefendant\u2019s bedroom closet one week after the murder at Eddie\u2019s. The evidence\nalso revealed that defendant mentioned the Penal Code section for murder (187)\nduring the Riteway robbery, and that a murder at Eddie\u2019s was committed by an\nAfrican-American man using the Glock stolen from Riteway. In light of the\ndistinctive shared features between the crimes at Riteway and Eddie\u2019s related to\nthe Glock handgun, evidence of the circumstances surrounding the Riteway\nrobbery reasonably support the inference that the individual who committed the\nRiteway robbery and stole the Glock from Riteway is the same person who had a\nGlock tucked in his waistband hours before the murder at Eddie\u2019s, was one of the\ntwo perpetrators who used the stolen Glock to murder the clerk at Eddie\u2019s, and\npossessed the stolen loaded Glock in his bedroom soon after the murder.\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\fTherefore, we conclude evidence related to the Riteway robbery evidence was\nrelevant to the issue of identity with regard to the liquor store charges.\n       The Riteway robbery evidence also was relevant to the liquor store charges\non the issue of intent. \u201cIn order to be admissible to prove intent, the uncharged\nmisconduct must be sufficiently similar to the charged offense to support the\ninference that the defendant probably acted with the same intent in each instance.\n[Citations.]\u201d (People v. Lindberg, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 23.) \u201c \u2018The inference to\nbe drawn is not that the actor is disposed to commit such acts; instead, the\ninference to be drawn is that, in light of the first event, the actor, at the time of the\nsecond event, must have had the intent attributed to him by the prosecution.\u2019\n[Citations.]\u201d (People v. Gallego (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 115, 171.)\n       Assuming defendant was one of the two individuals who planned and\ncommitted the acts that occurred at the liquor store on June 12, the fact that he\ncommitted the Riteway robbery was relevant to the issue of intent with regard to\nthe attempted robbery charge connected with the liquor store murder. In both\ncases, an armed individual confronted a lone clerk behind the checkout counter of\na small store during the daytime. Force was used against both clerks. The Glock\nstolen by defendant during the Riteway robbery was used by one of the\nperpetrators at the liquor store. Based on these similarities, evidence of the\nRiteway robbery would reasonably support an inference that defendant harbored\nthe same intent to rob in each instance.\n       Having concluded evidence of the Riteway robbery was admissible on the\nissues of identity and intent on the liquor store charges,13 we next address\n\n13     We need not discuss the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling that Rite Way\nrobbery was also admissible on the liquor store charges on the issue of knowledge.\nAssuming any error in that regard, we note that \u201c \u2018 \u201ca ruling or decision, itself\ncorrect in law, will not be disturbed on appeal merely because given for a wrong\nreason.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Zapien (1993) 4 Cal. 4th 929, 976.) That is, because as we\n\n                                           41\n\fdefendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor was required to accept his plea offer and\nstipulation regarding the gun he stole during the Riteway robbery.\n       \u201cThe general rule is that the prosecution in a criminal case cannot be\ncompelled to accept a stipulation if the effect would be to deprive the state\u2019s case\nof its persuasiveness and forcefulness.\u201d (People v. Edelbacher (1989) 47 Cal. 3d\n983, 1007.) The key factual disputes in this trial were whether defendant\ncommitted the crimes at the liquor store, and, if so, whether he acted with an intent\nto rob the liquor store\u2019s clerk. Defendant\u2019s plea offer and proposed stipulation\nregarding the Riteway robbery would not have included an admission on either of\nthese issues. Had the facts of the Riteway robbery been withheld from the jury as\nthe result of a stipulation, the prosecution would have been deprived of significant\ncircumstantial evidence material to the liquor store crimes. There were no\npercipient witnesses to the liquor store crimes, the surveillance videotape only\nshowed the suspects entering and exiting the liquor store, and apparently nothing\nhad been taken from the store. Under these circumstances, evidence of the\nRiteway robbery was crucial for the prosecution in demonstrating that defendant\nand Johnson possessed a similar intent to rob the liquor store in a similar fashion,\nin order to prove the charge of attempted robbery. In People v. Arias (1996) 13\nCal. 4th 92, we held that the prosecutor could not be compelled to accept\ndefendant\u2019s offer to stipulate to charges stemming from a sexual assault where the\nprosecution would otherwise lose material circumstantial evidence relevant to the\nissues of identity and consciousness of guilt on charges stemming from a murder\nthat occurred prior to the sexual assault. (Id. at pp. 130-131.) Here, as in Arias,\n\n\n\n\nexplain below, the trial court did not err in ruling the evidence was admissible on\nthe issue of intent, its additional ruling that the evidence was admissible on the\nissue of knowledge is of no consequence.\n\n                                         42\n\fthe prosecution was not required to accept defendant\u2019s plea offer and proposed\nstipulation.\n       Defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary, the trial court did not abuse its discretion\nin denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the details of the Riteway robbery on the\ncapital charges under Evidence Code section 352. The robbery and attempted\nrobbery counts from the separate incidents were properly joined as alleging crimes\nof the same class (\u00a7 954; People v. Walker (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 605, 622), and the\ndetails of the manner in which the Riteway robbery was carried out were not likely\nto inflame the jury\u2019s passions because, as defendant\u2019s attorney acknowledged, the\nRiteway robbery was a \u201cstandard robbery.\u201d\n       We next address defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court committed prejudicial\nerror by failing to instruct the jury that evidence admitted to prove the Riteway\nrobbery could be not be considered to prove his propensity to commit the liquor\nstore crimes. Although the trial court had informed the parties it would give a\nlimiting instruction as to both Johnson and defendant, the court referred only to\nJohnson when it gave the limiting instruction prior to deliberations. Because the\ntrial court was not obligated to provide a limiting instruction, defendant forfeited\nthe issue by failing to request either a correction of the given instruction or a new\ninstruction that applied specifically to the charges against defendant. (People v.\nFreeman (1994) 8 Cal. 4th 450, 495.) In any event, any error in failing to give a\nlimiting instruction as to defendant was harmless given the multiple permissible\nuses of the Riteway robbery evidence with regard to the liquor store charges, the\nabsence of any argument by the prosecutor urging the jury to infer defendant\u2019s\npropensity to commit robberies, the presumption that the jurors followed the\ninstructions regarding presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt, and the\noverwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt as to the liquor store charges.\n\n\n\n                                          43\n\f            8. CALJIC No. 17.41.1\n       Pursuant to CALJIC No. 17.41.1, the trial court instructed the jury that\n\u201c[t]he integrity of a trial requires that jurors, at all times during their deliberations,\nconduct themselves as required by these instructions. Accordingly, should it occur\nthat any juror refuses to deliberate or expresses an intention to disregard the law or\nto decide the case in this guilt phase based on penalty or punishment, or any other\nimproper basis, it is the obligation of the other jurors to immediately advise the\nCourt of the situation.\u201d Defendant contends this instruction infringed on his\nfederal and state constitutional rights to trial by jury and his state constitutional\nright to a unanimous verdict. (U.S. Const., 6th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art.\nI, \u00a7 16.)\n       Although we disapproved use of this instruction in future trials in People v.\nEngelman (2002) 28 Cal.4th 436,we held that \u201cthe instruction does not infringe\nupon defendant\u2019s federal or state constitutional right to trial by jury or his state\nconstitutional right to a unanimous verdict.\u201d (Id. at pp. 439-440.) Defendant\nprovides no persuasive reason for us to reconsider our conclusion, nor does he cite\nanything in the record that indicates any juror refused to deliberate or expressed an\nintention to disregard the law or to decide the case on an improper basis. (See\nPeople v. Brown (2004) 33 Cal. 4th 382, 393.) Accordingly, we reject this claim.\n\n            9. Cumulative Error\n       Defendant contends the cumulative effect of the asserted guilt phase errors\nrequires reversal regardless of the prejudicial impact of any single error. To the\nextent there are instances in which we have found error or assumed its existence,\nwe have concluded no prejudice resulted. We do not find reversible error by\nconsidering the claims cumulatively.\n\n\n\n\n                                            44\n\f       C. Penalty Phase Issues (Penalty Retrial)\n\n           1. Batson/Wheeler\n       Defendant claims that at the penalty retrial, the trial court erroneously\ndenied his two motions under People v. Wheeler (1978) 22 Cal. 3d 258 (Wheeler)\nbased on the prosecutor\u2019s assertedly discriminatory use of peremptory challenges\nto remove African-American Prospective Jurors F. J. and J. S., in violation of his\nstate constitutional right to trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-\nsection of the community (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16). For the first time on appeal,\ndefendant claims the erroneous denial of his Wheeler motions deprived him of his\nFourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws. (Batson v. Kentucky\n(1986) 476 U.S. 79 (Batson).)14 For the reasons we explain below, the trial court\ndid not err in denying the Batson/Wheeler motions.15\n\n               a. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n                  (1) Prospective Jurors F.J. and J.S.\n       During general voir dire, the prospective jurors responded orally to\nquestions posed by the trial court that were based on questions that appeared on a\nprinted questionnaire, which was provided to all jurors. Among other things, the\njurors were asked to state their occupation, if any, and any prior occupation that\nwas substantially different from their current employment.\n       Prospective Juror F.J. revealed that since graduating from high school he\nhad been a driver with United Parcel Service (UPS) for 18 years. He had never\n\n14     Although the defendant cited only Wheeler when making his motions, on\nappeal a Wheeler motion is treated as a motion under Wheeler and Batson.\n(People v. Yeoman (2003) 31 Cal. 4th 93, 117-118.) We refer to the defense\nmotions as Batson/Wheeler motions throughout this opinion.\n15     Because we find the trial court did not err by denying either of defendant\u2019s\nBatson/Wheeler motions, we reject defendant\u2019s boilerplate claims of violations of\nvarious other state and federal constitutional rights. (See People v. Roldan (2005)\n35 Cal. 4th 646, 703; People v. Yeoman, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 118.)\n\n                                          45\n\fheld a supervisory position. He had prior jury experience in two criminal trials: a\nrobbery case, which had proceeded to verdict, and a murder case, which had\nresulted in a hung jury. He had felt frustrated that the jurors could not reach a\nverdict.\n       Prospective Juror J.S. designed telephone circuits for Pacific Bell, her\nemployer for 30 years. While she experienced career advancement and trained\nothers in the use of computers and circuit designs for 20 years, she was never a\nsupervisor. As a designer, she would get an order and put together the circuit.\nWhile in school and before her employment at Pacific Bell, J.S. worked at the\n\u201cDepartment of Justice\u201d or the \u201cDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office\u201d \u201chandling . . .\ntranscripts and filing them.\u201d J.S. had prior jury service in a criminal and a civil\ntrial, each of which reached a verdict. The criminal case concerned child\nmolestation; the civil case involved personal injury. J.S. said she would express\nher opinions during deliberations and listen to her fellow jurors, but would not\nchange her views just to accommodate the views of others.\n\n                  (2) Peremptory Challenges\n       Prospective Juror F.J.\n       After the prosecutor exercised her fourth peremptory challenge against\nProspective Juror F.J., defense counsel objected the challenge was racially\nmotivated, noting there remained only one or two African-Americans in the\nvenire. The trial court responded that it \u201calways feel[s] inadequate in these\nWheeler motions. Now I\u2019m supposed to put on a D.A. hat and look at my notes\nand see whether, in my opinion, a reasonable D.A. would have had a not racial\nreason for using a peremptory.\u201d The court noted that some district attorneys\nautomatically exclude a prospective juror who had served on a hung jury. It found\ndefendant failed to make a prima facie showing of group bias and offered the\nprosecutor the opportunity to place her reasons for the challenge on the record.\n\n                                          46\n\f       In response, the prosecutor noted that F.J. had \u201c[n]o significant life\nexperiences that indicates strong decisionmaking skills. He\u2019s been throughout his\noccupation, a UPS driver, never supervised anybody. There is nothing about his\nbackground that indicates that he can engage in a decision that \u2014 of this\nmagnitude. There is . . . strength about his background; although, in a different\ntype of case, I think he would be a wonderful juror, but this is a penalty where I\u2019m\ngoing to be asking him to bring back a verdict of death. I want strong decision-\nmaking skills.\u201d The court then said its notes indicated \u201csince high school UPS\ndriver, loading, no supervisory experience, girlfriend sells computers, two minor\nchildren, plays golf, coaches a traveling basketball team.\u201d After the court denied\nthe motion, the prosecutor added that the decision in the penalty phase of a death\npenalty case \u201cis far more stressful and of greater magnitude than your ordinary\ncase, and I bear that in mind when I excuse jurors.\u201d\n       Prospective Juror J.S.\n       Following Prospective Juror F.J.\u2019s excusal, the parties exercised several\nmore peremptory challenges. When the prosecutor challenged Prospective Juror\nJ.S., counsel made his second Batson/Wheeler motion. He argued that \u201c[t]here\u2019s\nonly two or three left in the group in the audience. She seemed like an idea [sic]\njuror. She had two priors, both\u2014one civil, one criminal. There was a verdict.\nShe has worked for many, many, many years at Pacific Bell. Worked her way up.\nShe supervised people. She trains. She obviously can make decisions. She\nworked\u2014and just otherwise seems to be a good juror. I can\u2019t see any reason why\nthe District Attorney would not accept her, other than the fact she is a black\nfemale. And I would note that the last jury which hung, the two hangs were black\nfemales. But that should not be a basis.\u201d\n       The trial court reminded counsel that the prosecutor had explained that she\n\u201crelied on life\u2019s experience criteria\u201d earlier in excusing Prospective Juror F.J. and\n\n\n                                          47\n\fstated that it did not recall that Prospective Juror J.S. \u201csupervised anybody.\u201d The\ntrial court \u201cbelieve[d] she [had] trained people on how to use the computer design\ncircuits.\u201d\n       After the court invited the prosecutor to comment, she stated that \u201cmy\nrecollection is that she specifically said she did not supervise anybody.\u201d The\nprosecutor felt J.S. had a \u201cmisleading\u201d job description, that she \u201cmakes no\ndecisions. She is given specifications and she inputs that information into a\ncomputer. She is basically a more sophisticated form of a filing clerk\u201d and has\n\u201cheld nothing but clerk positions. She has trained individuals in terms of inputting\ndata. She is a data entry specialist, basically. I don\u2019t think the fact she trains\npeople in how they input data makes her specifically qualified for high-stress\ndecision-making jobs. . . . This is going to be a very stressful, deliberative process\n[that] requires individuals who are seasoned decision makers. They could handle\nthe stress of a tough decision. The fear factor involved any time you get a\nstressful and difficult decision to make, that can be very crippling in terms of the\ndeliberation process when you get somebody in the jury room who doesn\u2019t have\nthat experience. And that\u2019s one of . . . the many things that I look at in terms of a\njuror. I\u2019ve looked at her job description. She has basically been in clerk positions.\nIf I were to not kick her, it seems to me that it would only be because she is an\nAfrican-American. And I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019m going to discriminate in one\ndirection or the other. I\u2019m not going to keep her simply because she is African-\nAmerican. . . . [T]here\u2019s absolutely nothing about her background that tells me that\nshe can operate in a high-stress situation. And that\u2019s very important in this type of\ncase where the issue is life and death.\u201d\n       The court found defendant had failed to make a prima facie case of racial\ndiscrimination but permitted counsel to further argue. Counsel argued J.S.\u2019s life\nexperiences, including her 30-year employment with Pacific Bell, employment at\n\n                                           48\n\fthe Department of Justice, and her 20-year experience at Pacific Bell training\nothers in the use of computers and circuit designs provided her adequate\nexperience to make difficult decisions, and thus she was qualified to sit as a capital\njuror.\n         The trial court clarified that J.S. had been a \u201cfiling clerk\u201d with the\nDepartment of Justice and stated that regardless of whether it would have used the\nprosecutor\u2019s criteria to exercise peremptory challenges, it found significant that it\nwas \u201ca non-race based criteria. And her use of the peremptory as to this juror was\nconsistent with that non-suspect category use.\u201d\n         The prosecutor was permitted to add to the record that \u201cit\u2019s not just\nsupervisory positions that I look for. I look for how they handled stressful\nsituations or inciden[ts] in their life.\u201d She said she had to decide \u201cwhether or not\nan individual juror has what it takes to be fearless in the decision to handles the\nstress of the moment, and to engage in basically a deliberative process that\ninvolves a decision of an enormous magnitude.\u201d Noting she has limited things she\ncan look at, and that voir dire is like a job interview, she concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t\nbelieve that [J.S.] is up to the decision in this case.\u201d\n         The court said it was \u201cconfident the D.A. is not using a protected category\nbasis for her peremptories\u201d and gave the defense further opportunity to make a\nrecord. Defense counsel asked the court \u201cmay I inquire, this juror was asked\nwhether or not she has ever had to deal with stress in her life, specifically?\u201d The\ntrial court stated that \u201c[I] don\u2019t recall that specific question. [B]ut there were\nquestions about her life.\u201d The prosecutor then objected, stating \u201chow a person\ndeals with stress and how they recognize it as stress will vary from individual to\nindividual. I know what I go on; their ability to deal with stress is one of the\nthings I look at, including their ability to make decisions. That includes\nprocessing information and experience in making decisions. It\u2019s my opinion that\n\n                                            49\n\fmore experienced people in terms of decision makers make better decisions for the\nappropriate reasons.\u201d The trial court denied the request to reopen voir dire and\ndenied the Batson/Wheeler motion. At that time, the jury for the penalty retrial\nincluded 11 Caucasians and one African-American. The alternate jurors included\ntwo Caucasians, one African-American, and an individual who may have been\nHispanic or Filipino.\n\n           b. Discussion\n       The federal and state Constitutions prohibit the use of peremptory\nchallenges to remove prospective jurors based solely on impermissible group bias.\n(Batson, supra, 476 U.S. at p. 89; Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at pp. 276-277.) We\nconduct the three-step Batson inquiry to review claims of alleged group bias based\non race. \u201cFirst, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has made a\nprima facie showing that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge based\non race. Second, if the showing is made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to\ndemonstrate that the challenges were exercised for a race-neutral reason. Third,\nthe court determines whether the defendant has proven purposeful discrimination.\nThe ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and\nnever shifts from, the opponent of the strike. [Citation.] The three-step procedure\nalso applies to state constitutional claims.\u201d (People v. Lenix (2008) 44 Cal. 4th\n602, 612-613 (Lenix).)\n       In ruling on defendant\u2019s Batson/Wheeler motion concerning F.J.\u2019s excusal,\nthe court explicitly ruled that he failed to make a prima facie showing of\ndiscrimination. Then, after the prosecutor stated her reasons for excusing F.J, the\ntrial court stated that \u201cmy notes, since high school UPS driver, loading, no\nsupervisory experience, girlfriend sells computers, two minor children, plays golf,\ncoaches a traveling basketball team.\u201d In doing so, the trial court impliedly agreed\n\n\n\n                                         50\n\fwith the prosecutor that F.J. did not have supervisory experience and found the\nprosecutor\u2019s justification was genuine.\n       In denying defendant\u2019s Batson/Wheeler motion regarding J.S., the trial\ncourt stated that a \u201cprima facie showing [of group bias] has not been made.\u201d It\nrecalled that J.S. had experience training others at Pacific Bell \u201con how to use the\ncomputer design circuits\u201d but not supervising employees. The court also expressly\nfound that the prosecutor\u2019s justification was a \u201cnon-race based criteria\u201d and that\nher excusal of J.S. was \u201cconsistent with that non-suspect category.\u201d Taken\ntogether, the court\u2019s statements evince its satisfaction that the prosecutor\u2019s\nexplanations were genuine and credible.\n       Where the trial court determines that defendant did not make a prima facie\nshowing of group bias and also rules on, indicates agreement or satisfaction with,\nor otherwise passes judgment on the ultimate question of purposeful\ndiscrimination, the case is described as a first stage/third stage Batson/Wheeler\nhybrid, and the question whether a defendant established a prima facie case of\ngroup bias is rendered moot. (People v. Riccardi (2012) 54 Cal. 4th 758, 786\n[question whether defendant established prima facie showing of purposeful\ndiscrimination rendered moot where \u201cthe court expressly agreed with the\nprosecutor\u2019s reasons, and thereafter appeared implicitly to agree with the\nprosecutor\u2019s reasons given in response to [the] defendant\u2019s subsequent Wheeler\nmotions\u201d]; Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613, fn. 8, citing Hernandez v. New York\n(1991) 500 U.S. 352, 359; see People v. Mills (2010) 48 Cal. 4th 158, 173-174\n[question whether prima facie case of group bias has been made is mooted where\nthe trial \u201cpassed judgment on the prosecutor\u2019s actual reasons for the peremptory\nchallenges (the third stage of a Batson inquiry), expressly noting that the court was\n\u2018satisfied . . . from the explanation given by the prosecutor\u2019 that the motivation for\nthe challenges was not based on race\u201d].) Here, as indicated above, with respect to\n\n                                          51\n\feach of defendant\u2019s Batson/Wheeler motions, the trial court ruled ultimately that\nthe prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons were genuine and race neutral, and therefore, as to\neach motion, the question whether defendant made a prima facie showing of racial\ndiscrimination is rendered moot. Accordingly, \u201c \u2018we express no opinion on\nwhether defense counsel established a prima facie case of discrimination and\ninstead skip to Batson\u2019s third stage to evaluate the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for\ndismissing [the] African\u2013American prospective jurors.\u2019 \u201d (Riccardi, supra, 54\nCal.4th at p. 787.)\n       \u201cAt the third stage of the Wheeler/Batson inquiry, \u2018the issue comes down to\nwhether the trial court finds the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral explanations to be\ncredible. Credibility can be measured by, among other factors, the prosecutor\u2019s\ndemeanor; by how reasonable, or how improbable, the explanations are; and by\nwhether the proffered rationale has some basis in accepted trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d\n(Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613.) In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a\nBatson/Wheeler motion, we examine \u201conly whether substantial evidence supports\nits conclusions.\u201d (Id. at p. 613.) \u201c \u2018We presume that a prosecutor uses peremptory\nchallenges in a constitutional manner and give great deference to the trial court\u2019s\nability to distinguish bona fide reasons from sham excuses. [Citation.] So long as\nthe trial court makes a sincere and reasoned effort to evaluate the\nnondiscriminatory justifications offered, its conclusions are entitled to deference\non appeal. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d (People v. Manibusan (2013) 58 Cal. 4th 40, 76.)\n       Defendant first contends we should not give the normal deference to the\ntrial court\u2019s rulings because the trial court was biased. Defendant\u2019s claim to the\ncontrary, the fact that in ruling on the Batson/Wheeler motion as to J.S., the trial\ncourt mentioned the reasons the prosecutor gave for her earlier decision to\nchallenge F.J. does not, as defendant asserts, establish it abandoned its neutrality.\nWe next consider whether substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s rulings\n\n                                          52\n\fthat the prosecutor provided plausible, race-neutral reasons for challenging F.J.\nand J.S.\n\n                  (1) Statistical Evidence\n       \u201cIf a prosecutor articulates a basis for a peremptory challenge that results in\nthe disproportionate exclusion of members of a certain race, the trial judge may\nconsider that fact as evidence that the prosecutor\u2019s stated reason constitutes a\npretext for racial discrimination.\u201d (Hernandez v. New York (1991) 500 U.S. 352,\n363 (plur. opn. of Kennedy, J.).) Defendant contends statistical evidence\ndemonstrates that the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges to F.J. and J.S. were\nracially motivated.\n       Here, the 59-member venire included four or five African-Americans,\nrepresenting approximately 6.7 or 8.5 percent of the venire. The prosecutor used\n18.2 percent of her challenges (2 of 11) to remove 40 percent (2 of 5) or 50\npercent (2 of 4) of the available African-Americans. The prosecutor used two\nadditional challenges against non-African-Americans during selection of the four\nalternate jurors. Thus, before accepting the panel, the prosecutor exercised a total\nof 15.4 percent of her challenges (2 of 13) against African-American prospective\njurors. One African-American sat on the jury, and one sat as an alternate.16\n       We do not find these numbers suggest improper discrimination. In People\nv. Pearson, supra, 56 Cal.4th at page 422, we held the prosecutor\u2019s use of one of\ntwo peremptory challenges (50 percent) against a group comprising only 12.5\npercent of the 24-member panel did not appear \u201c \u2018suspicious.\u2019 \u201d The numbers here\n\n\n16      Further jury selection proceedings were held prior to commencement of the\npenalty trial after two alternate jurors were excused, one for medical reasons and\nthe other due to a death in the family. Defendant does not support his claim with\nstatistical evidence from those proceedings nor does he complain about the\ncircumstances under which the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge\nduring those proceedings.\n\n                                         53\n\fare similar and do not cause concern that the challenges were racially motivated.\nIn addition, we observe that the sole African-American on the jury represented 8.3\npercent of the jury, approximately the same percentage of African-Americans on\nthe venire. Further, while not conclusive, the fact that the jury included an\nAfrican-American \u201cis an indication of good faith [by the prosecutor] in exercising\nperemptories.\u201d (People v. Turner (1994) 8 Cal. 4th 137, 168.)\n       After reviewing the relevant statistics, we are not persuaded that a\ndisproportionate number of African-Americans were excluded from the jury.\nHowever, because even a lone race-based challenge is unconstitutional, we bear in\nmind those statistics while examining the prosecutor\u2019s explanation for challenging\nF.J. and J.S. (People v. Jones (2011) 51 Cal. 4th 346, 363.)\n\n                   (2) The Prosecutor\u2019s Explanations\n       \u201cA prosecutor asked to explain his conduct must provide a \u2018 \u201cclear and\nreasonably specific\u201d \u2019 explanation of his \u201clegitimate reasons\u201d for exercising the\nchallenges.\u2019 \u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613, quoting Batson, supra, 476 U.S.\nat p. 98, fn. 20.) \u201cNevertheless, although a prosecutor may rely on any number of\nbases to select jurors, a legitimate reason is one that does not deny equal\nprotection.\u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613.) A peremptory challenge may be\njustified by \u201ca neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried.\u201d\n(Batson, supra, 476 U.S. at p. 98.) A peremptory challenge may be based on\nemployment (see e.g., People v. Johnson (1989) 47 Cal. 3d 1194, 1216, 1220), and\n\u201c \u2018hunches[,]\u2019 and even \u2018arbitrary\u2019 exclusion is permissible, so long as the reasons\nare not based on impermissible group bias\u201d (People v. Turner, supra, 8 Cal.4th at\np. 165). The basis for a challenge may range from \u201cthe virtually certain to the\nhighly speculative\u201d (Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 275) and \u201ceven a \u2018trivial\u2019\n\n\n\n\n                                          54\n\freason, if genuine and neutral, will suffice.\u201d (People v. Arias, supra, 13 Cal.4th at\np. 136.)\n        Citing Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at page 276, defendant contends the\nprosecutor\u2019s reasons were not valid because a lack of supervisory experience does\nnot reflect a specific bias against the prosecution, nor does it indicate the juror will\nbe unable to deliberate in the case at hand. While Wheeler explained that\nperemptory challenges are permissible to remove a prospective juror who harbors\n\u201ca specific bias . . . relating to the particular case on trial or the parties or witnesses\nthereto,\u201d (Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 276), it also recognized that \u201cthe law\nallows removal of a biased juror by a challenge for which no reason \u2018need be\ngiven,\u2019 i.e., publicly stated: in many instances the party . . . cannot establish his\nreason by normal methods of proof . . .\u201d (id. at p. 275). Therefore, as long as it is\nexercised in a nondiscriminatory manner, a peremptory challenge may be based on\nspeculation that a prospective juror would be unable to decide penalty because he\nor she lacked supervisory work experience.\n        Here, the prosecutor stated she desired jurors who could make difficult\ndecisions such as those in the penalty phase of a death penalty case. It was her\nbelief that this quality is demonstrated by a person who has had practical work\nexperience as a supervisor and that those who did not have this experience were\nless likely to be able to decide hard questions. The prosecutor further stated that\nbecause the prospective jurors\u2019 oral responses to the written questionnaire the trial\ncourt used during general voir dire provided only limited personal and background\ninformation about the prospective jurors, she believed this factor provided relevant\nand sufficient information to consider in exercising peremptory challenges in this\ncase.\n        \u201cThe proper focus of a Batson/Wheeler inquiry, of course, is on the\nsubjective genuineness of the race-neutral reasons given for the peremptory\n\n                                            55\n\fchallenge, not on the objective reasonableness of those reasons.\u201d (People v.\nReynoso (2003) 31 Cal. 4th 903, 924 [prosecutor\u2019s subjective opinion that a\ncustomer service representative lacks educational experience to effectively serve\nas a juror, while \u201cof questionable persuasiveness,\u201d could properly form the basis\nof a peremptory challenge].) Therefore, a prosecutor \u201ccan challenge a potential\njuror whose occupation, in the prosecutor\u2019s subjective estimation, would not\nrender him or her the best type of juror to sit on the case for which the jury is\nbeing selected.\u201d (Id. at p. 925.)\n       If the prosecutor in this case genuinely exercised her peremptory challenges\nbecause, in her subjective estimation, neither F.J. nor J. S. had the \u201chigh stress\u201d\ndecisionmaking skills required of a capital juror, that explanation constitutes \u201can\nentirely valid and nondiscriminatory reason for exercising [those] challenge[s].\u201d\n(People v. Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 924, italics omitted.) Here, the\nprosecutor asked other non-African-American prospective jurors whether they had\nsupervisory experience, and the defense, apparently sharing the prosecutor\u2019s view\nthat supervisory experience was a factor worthy of consideration, sought the same\ninformation from several other prospective jurors. We conclude the record\nsubstantially supports the trial court\u2019s conclusions that the prosecutor\u2019s\nexplanations for peremptorily challenging F.J. and J.S. were genuine and not\nracially motivated.\n       The dissent makes much of the fact that, in making the Batson/Wheeler\nobjection, defense counsel asserted that \u201cthe two hangs [at the first trial] were\nblack females.\u201d Assuming the assertion, not otherwise supported in the record,\nwas accurate, the trial court was aware of it and could take it into account in its\nruling. It does not itself show discriminatory intent at the second trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                          56\n\f                  (3) Comparative Analysis\n       Defendant contends a comparative juror analysis of F.J.\u2019s and J.S.\u2019s work\nexperience with that of eight non-African-American jurors whom the prosecutor\ndid not challenge (W.B., L.F., G.M., K.K., B.A., R.P., W.F., M.C.) demonstrates\nthat the prosecutor\u2019s justifications for challenging F.J. and J.S. were pretextual.\n\u201cComparative juror analysis is evidence that, while subject to inherent limitations,\nmust be considered when reviewing claims of error at [Batson/Wheeler]\u2019s third\nstage when the defendant relies on such evidence and the record is adequate to\npermit the comparisons.\u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 607.) \u201cIn those\ncircumstances, comparative juror analysis must be performed on appeal even\nwhen such an analysis was not conducted below.\u201d (Ibid.) \u201c[C]omparative juror\nanalysis is but one form of circumstantial evidence that is relevant, but not\nnecessarily dispositive, on the issue of intentional discrimination.\u201d (Id. at p. 622.)\nThis is true because \u201c[o]n appellate review, a voir dire answer sits on a page of\ntranscript. In the trial court, however, advocates and trial judges watch and listen\nas the answer is delivered. Myriad subtle nuances may shape it, including attitude,\nattention, interest, body language, facial expression and eye contact. \u2018Even an\ninflection in the voice can make a difference in the meaning.\u2019 \u201d (Ibid.) Moreover,\nwe have recognized \u201cthat it is a combination of factors rather than any single one\nwhich often leads to the exercise of a peremptory challenge\u201d; that \u201cthe particular\ncombination or mix of jurors which a lawyer seeks may, and often does, change as\ncertain jurors are removed or seated in the jury box\u201d; and that \u201cthe same factors\nused in evaluating a juror may be given different weight depending on the number\nof peremptory challenges the lawyer has at the time of the exercise of the\nperemptory challenge and the number of challenges remaining with the other\nside.\u201d (People v. Johnson, supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 1220.) \u201cIt is therefore with good\nreason that we and the United States Supreme Court give great deference to the\n\n\n                                          57\n\ftrial court\u2019s determination that the use of peremptory challenges was not for an\nimproper or class bias purpose.\u201d (Id. at p. 1221.)\n       \u201cThe high court stated: \u2018It is true that peremptories are often the subjects of\ninstinct, Batson v. Kentucky, supra, [476 U.S.] at [page] 106 . . . (Marshall, J.,\nconcurring), and it can sometimes be hard to say what the reason is. But when\nillegitimate grounds like race are in issue, a prosecutor simply has got to state his\nreasons as best he can and stand or fall on the plausibility of the reasons he gives.\nA Batson challenge does not call for a mere exercise in thinking up any rational\nbasis. If the stated reason does not hold up, its pretextual significance does not\nfade because a trial judge, or an appeals court, can imagine a reason that might not\nhave been shown up as false.\u2019 [Citation.] The high court cautioned that efforts by\na trial or reviewing court to \u2018substitute\u2019 a reason will not satisfy the prosecutor\u2019s\nburden of stating a racially neutral explanation. (Ibid.)\u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th\nat pp. 624-625.)\n       Preliminarily, defendant contends that the only criteria to be examined\nusing comparative analysis are the prosecutor\u2019s characterizations and the record of\nactual responses by challenged and unchallenged jurors. However, \u201c[w]hen asked\nto engage in comparative juror analysis for the first time on appeal, a reviewing\ncourt need not, indeed, must not turn a blind eye to reasons the record discloses for\nnot challenging other jurors even if those other jurors are similar in some respects\nto excused jurors.\u201d (People v. Jones, supra, 51 Cal.4th at pp. 365-366.) This is so\nbecause a party legitimately may challenge one prospective juror but not another\nto whom the same particular concern applies. (Id. at p. 365.) \u201cTwo panelists\nmight give a similar answer on a given point. Yet the risk posed by one panelist\nmight be offset by other answers, behavior, attitudes or experiences that make one\njuror, on balance, more or less desirable. These realities, and the complexity of\nhuman nature, make a formulaic comparison of isolated responses an\n\n                                          58\n\fexceptionally poor medium to overturn a trial court\u2019s factual finding.\u201d (Lenix,\nsupra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 624.)\n       Before we proceed with our analysis, we address the question whether it is\nappropriate to consider the oral responses of the non-African-American jurors that\nwere provided after the trial court denied his second motion, that is, the responses\nof Prospective Jurors B.A., R.P., W.F., and M.C. As we stated in Lenix, \u201cappellate\nreview is necessarily circumscribed. . . . [T]he trial court\u2019s finding is reviewed on\nthe record as it stands at the time the [Batson/Wheeler] ruling is made.\u201d (Lenix,\nsupra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 624.) \u201cIf the defendant believes that subsequent events\nshould be considered by the trial court, a renewed objection is required to permit\nappellate consideration of these subsequent developments.\u201d (Ibid.) Thus, if\ndefendant believed the trial court should have considered any post-ruling\ndevelopments, he could have, and should have, renewed his Batson/Wheeler\nclaim. Because defendant did not, his reliance on the responses of the above\njurors that were provided after the trial court denied his second motion is forfeited.\nNonetheless, out of caution, we consider the responses of these prospective jurors\nin our comparison below.\n       Juror W.B.\n       Juror W.B. was a network technician for the Huntington Beach School\nDistrict, and his responsibilities included computer network administration and\ncomputer troubleshooting. He did not supervise anyone in that position, but he\nhad previously worked in sales and office management for an electrical wholesale\nbusiness. There, he supervised two to three \u201cwarehouse-type\u201d employees.\nDefendant acknowledges this juror\u2019s supervisory experience, but asserts it should\nbe accorded little weight because for the five years prior to defendant\u2019s trial, the\njuror held jobs that required increased technical experience and lacked supervisory\nresponsibilities. However, the prosecutor\u2019s questions indicate she was concerned\n\n                                          59\n\fwith supervisory work experience in general, not that such experience had to be\nthe prospective juror\u2019s current or most recent position.\n       Juror L.F.\n       Juror L.F. worked as an administrative assistant for Boeing \u201coff and on\nabout 20 years,\u201d handling worker\u2019s compensation and medical claims and acting\nas \u201ca buffer between the injured worker and the insurance carrier.\u201d Although she\nmade no decisions on the approval or rejection of claims, she consulted with\nothers on those decisions, provided input, and discussed pertinent information with\nthe individual making the ultimate decision. The prosecutor may have reasonably\nviewed Juror L.F. as someone with experience in making decisions in stressful\ncircumstances, and someone who would work well with other jurors as a team and\nreturn a verdict.\n       Juror G.M.\n       Juror G.M. was a senior consulting engineer for Tasco Refining. He had\nnever directly supervised people, although he had directed and reviewed the work\nof engineering contractors. He sometimes worked as part of a team. The\nprosecutor may have reasonably found Juror G.M. to be more favorable than F.J.\nand J.S. based solely on his experience in directing and reviewing the work of\nothers, as well as making independent, complex decisions, experience she believed\nindicated the prospective juror could decide difficult questions.\n       Juror K.K.\n       Juror K.K. was a Raytheon lab technician who had worked in the areas of\nmetallurgy and electronic failure analysis for 15 years. He did not supervise\nemployees, but the employees would help each other. Depending on the problem\npresented, Juror K.K. might receive instructions from engineers or might instruct\nothers. Juror K.K. had obtained an advance degree in financing that was related to\nhis job. The prosecutor may have reasonably found that while Juror K.K. lacked\n\n                                         60\n\fsupervisory experience, his ability to receive and give instructions to solve\nproblems on a continuing basis demonstrated a strong ability to make decisions.\nBy contrast, F.J.\u2019s and J.S.\u2019s work experience did not appear to involve these\nskills.\n          Juror B.A.\n          Juror B.A. was a sales representative for Frito-Lay company. Previously,\nshe had been the assistant manager of a high school cafeteria for seven years.\nDefendant asserts this juror \u201cwas never a true supervisor\u201d because she merely was\nresponsible for \u201cseeing that the food was served properly and on time and\neverybody was doing their duties.\u201d The prosecutor had explained she generally\nwas looking for supervisory responsibilities that revealed that a juror could make\ntough decisions. Juror B.A.\u2019s responses suggested her responsibilities as a\ncafeteria manager included supervising other employees. Nothing in the\ndescription of Prospective Jurors F.J.\u2019s and J.S.\u2019s job responsibilities appears to\ncompare. Significantly, Juror B.A. had been trained in the operation of firearms\nand owned a variety of firearms. She had shot \u201c.22\u2019s, .38\u2019s, .45\u2019s, [and] nine\nmillimeters,\u201d and owed four .22 rifles, a .22 pistol, a nine-millimeter\nsemiautomatic, and a .20-gauge shotgun. The backgrounds of F.J. and J.S. were\ndistinguishable from Juror B.A. by their lack of any supervisory responsibilities,\nas well as by their lack of experience with guns, a significant factor given the\nprosecution\u2019s reliance on ballistics evidence in this case.\n          Juror R.P.\n          Juror R.P. had been a diesel equipment operator for 11 years. Like F.J. and\nJ.S., he did not have supervisory work experience. However, Juror R.P. had had\nlife experiences F.J. and J.S. lacked that suggested he would be a favorable juror\nfor the prosecution. Juror R.P. had previously been a juror in a capital case that\ninvolved multiple murder charges and special circumstances allegations, and the\n\n                                           61\n\fjury had reached verdicts in both the guilt and penalty phase. The fact that Juror\nR.P. had been in the same stressful decisionmaking environment about which the\nprosecutor was concerned substantially distinguishes him from F.J. and J.S. In\naddition, Juror R.P. had ties to Long Beach law enforcement: his brother-in-law\nwas the police chief of its airport, his sister was a 911 operator for the Long Beach\nPolice Department, and an acquaintance worked for the police department. The\nprosecutor could have chosen not to strike Juror R.P. because of those strong ties\nto law enforcement. (See People v. Gray (2005) 37 Cal. 4th 168, 190-191\n[prosecutor could have chosen not to strike a juror whose husband was a\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Officer, believing the juror would be favorable to the\nprosecution].) In addition, Juror R.P. had witnessed two separate killings. At the\nscene of the first, he identified the suspect for police. Juror R.P. had intended to\ntestify in that case and had gone to court, but was not called to the witness stand.\nHe did testify at the vehicle manslaughter trial related to the second killing. These\nexperiences suggest Juror R.P. was not easily intimidated and could make hard\ndecisions. Notwithstanding Juror R.P.\u2019s lack of supervisory experience, the\nprosecutor could have believed he would have less difficulty deliberating during\npenalty than either F.J. or J.S.\n       Juror W.F.\n       Juror W.F. was an account coordinator for a coupon distribution company,\nconsulting with manufacturers to decide the type of media to use for distribution\nof coupons. She worked in conjunction with her account manager in making\ndecisions for her clients. Juror W.F. had previously worked for a public relations\nadvertising agency and as a marketing manager for Little Caesar\u2019s Pizza.\nAlthough she did not have supervisory work experience, her work experience is\ndistinguishable from that of F.J. and J.S. in that it required decisionmaking and\nworking in a team environment. In addition, Juror G.M.\u2019s brother-in-law was a\n\n                                          62\n\fLong Beach police officer whom she saw twice a month. The prosecutor could\nhave believed Juror G.M.\u2019s connection to the Long Beach Police Department, one\nof the investigating agencies in this case, would have made her a desirable juror\nfor the prosecution.\n       Juror M.C.\n       Juror M.C., a widow with nine adult children, had volunteered as a docent\nat the Torrance courthouse for 13 years. She had previously been a nurse\u2019s aide\nfor five years. She had prior jury service in a robbery trial that proceeded to\nverdict. One of her nephews was retired from the Los Angeles Police Department,\nand another was an interpreter at the Long Beach courthouse. Although Juror\nM.C. lacked supervisory experience, the prosecutor could have decided she was a\ndesirable juror for the prosecution who could deliberate effectively based on her\nexperience running a large household, her volunteer docent work in a courthouse\nfor 13 years, her experience on a criminal case that reached a verdict, and her ties\nto the legal community and law enforcement.\n       The comparative analysis we have undertaken, whether or not it includes\nour consideration of the oral responses of the non-African-American jurors that\nwere provided after the trial court denied defendant\u2019s second motion, does not\nundermine our conclusion that substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s denial\nof the Batson/Wheeler motions as to F.J. and J.S.\n\n           2. Admissibility of Miller\u2019s Statements to Officer Romero, Johnston\u2019s\n               Letter to Defendant, and the Still Photographs\n       In determining the penalty, the jury takes into account \u201cthe circumstances\nof the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present [case].\u201d\n(\u00a7 190.3, factor (a).) Therefore, \u201cevidence of the circumstances of the offense,\nincluding evidence creating a lingering doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt of the\noffense, is admissible at a penalty retrial as a factor in mitigation under section\n\n\n                                          63\n\f190.3.\u201d (People v. Gay (2008) 42 Cal. 4th 1195, 1221.) During the penalty retrial,\nthe prosecution introduced evidence that it had presented at the guilt trial to\nestablish the circumstances of the crimes. Defendant\u2019s trial attorney argued that\nnotwithstanding the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, lingering doubts existed\nregarding whether the shooting was accidental, whether defendant was the actual\nshooter, the credibility of Marcia\u2019s accomplice testimony, and the credibility of\nthe forensic expert concerning the expended bullets and casings.\n       Here, defendant contends the trial court at the penalty retrial erred in\nadmitting as circumstances of the crime (1) Miller\u2019s statements to Officer Romero,\n(2) Johnston\u2019s letter as an adoptive admission defendant committed \u201cthat little\nrobbery in Long Beach,\u201d and (3) the still photographs printed at Aerospace. He\nargues the erroneous admission of this evidence was prejudicial because it\npermitted the prosecutor to \u201cnegat[e] [his] strong mitigating circumstance of\nlingering doubt and skew[] the jury\u2019s weighing process in the direction of death.\u201d\n       \u201cError in admitting or excluding evidence at the penalty phase of a capital\ntrial is reversible if there is a reasonable possibility it affected the verdict.\u201d\n(People v. Gay, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 1223.) In part II.B.1, above, we found\nMiller\u2019s statements were not testimonial within the meaning of Crawford, supra,\n541 U.S. 32, and that their admission was constitutionally permissible during the\nguilt trial. For the same reasons, the evidence was properly admitted at the penalty\ntrial under factor (a) of section 190.3.\n       As discussed above in part II.B.4, above, we conclude Johnston\u2019s letter was\nerroneously admitted during the guilt phase but that the error was harmless. We\nalso conclude the erroneous instruction under CALJIC NO. 2.71.5 for adoptive\nadmissions did not compound the error or violate defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\nAdmission of the letter and instruction during the penalty retrial was error for the\nreasons expressed above. The information in Johnston\u2019s letter, however, was\n\n                                            64\n\fconveyed through Johnston\u2019s own testimony, and it did not address defendant\u2019s\nrole in the crime. Defendant\u2019s attorney argued to the jury that defendant was less\nculpable because he was not the actual shooter and did not intend to shoot the\nvictim, but Johnston\u2019s letter neither accused defendant of intentionally shooting\nthe clerk nor expressed knowledge of how the crimes were carried out. For these\nreasons, we conclude the error in admitting Johnston\u2019s letter had no reasonable\npossibility of affecting the penalty verdict. (People v. Pearson, supra, 56 Cal.4th\nat p. 472.)\n       Finally, in part II.B.6, above, we concluded the trial court acted within its\ndiscretion in admitting the still photographs printed at Aerospace. Here, for the\nsame reasons, the evidence was properly admitted at the penalty retrial under\nfactor (a) of section 190.3.\n\n              3. Exclusion of Evidence Explaining why Defendant Shot Moon\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred in excluding Marcia\u2019s statement to\nDetective Edwards during her interview that defendant told her he shot Moon only\nbecause Moon had gone for a gun. Defendant claims the evidence was admissible\nunder Evidence Code section 356\u2019s rule of completeness because it related to other\nstatements Marcia had made to Edwards that were admitted at trial.\n\n                 a. Factual and Procedural Background\n       On direct examination, Detective Edwards testified Marcia gave him\nseveral accounts about when the group met and planned the robbery and what\ndefendant had said during their meetings. On cross-examination, defense counsel\nasked Edwards whether Marcia told him defendant said he shot the victim because\nthe victim had reached for a gun. The prosecutor objected on hearsay grounds. At\na sidebar, counsel argued the statement was admissible under the rule of\ncompleteness. The trial court sustained the hearsay objection.\n\n\n\n                                         65\n\f                b. Discussion\n       Evidence Code section 356 provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[w]here part of\n[a] . . . conversation . . . is given in evidence by one party, the whole on the same\nsubject may be inquired into by an adverse party; . . . . when a . . . conversation . . .\nis given in evidence, any other act, declaration, conversation, or writing which is\nnecessary to make it understood may also be given in evidence.\u201d \u201cThe purpose of\nEvidence Code section 356 is to avoid creating a misleading impression.\n[Citation.] It applies only to statements that have some bearing upon, or\nconnection with, the portion of the conversation originally introduced. [Citation.]\nStatements pertaining to other matters may be excluded.\u201d (People v. Samuels\n(2005) 36 Cal. 4th 96, 130; see People v. Zapien, supra, 4 Cal.4th at p. 959.)\n       Here, defendant contends Marcia\u2019s statement to Detective Edwards that\ndefendant said he shot the victim because Moon was reaching for a gun was\nadmissible because it bore upon the statements Marcia made to Edwards that had\nalready been admitted. However, at the time of counsel\u2019s objection, the relevant\nportion of the interview that had been elicited through Marcia\u2019s testimony related\nsolely to what she perceived during the planning of the robbery and the events\nleading to and immediately following the crimes. Marcia\u2019s statements did not\nsuggest a reason for the shooting or refer to any other statements defendant may\nhave made about the shooting. Nothing about what had been presented to the jury\nwas misleading, and the excluded statement had no bearing on the portion of\nMarcia\u2019s interview that had been introduced into evidence. Accordingly, we\nconclude the trial court properly excluded Edward\u2019s proffered testimony regarding\nany statements by Marcia that purportedly explained why or how the victim had\nbeen shot.\n\n\n\n\n                                           66\n\f           4. Victim Impact Evidence\n       Defendant contends his penalty judgment must be reversed because the\npresentation of victim impact evidence, including a photo board displaying 17\nphotographs of the victim, was unduly prejudicial and rendered his trial\nfundamentally unfair.\n       We summarize the relevant victim impact evidence before addressing\ndefendant\u2019s claim of prejudice.\n       Los Angeles Police Officer Stephen Morris was married to victim Richard\nMoon\u2019s stepdaughter Maryann. Morris testified he met Richard Moon in 1986\nand described him as the most generous person he ever met, crediting Moon with\nhelping him graduate from the police academy. Morris learned of Moon\u2019s death\nwhile on duty. He broke down and cried, and his supervisor had to drive him\nhome. Morris felt guilty because he was working blocks from Eddie\u2019s when\nMoon was shot, but he was not there to help. Morris observed that everything had\nturned \u201cupside-down\u201d for Moon\u2019s wife, Catherine, after the murder.\n       Morris testified Moon loved life more than anyone he knew, and that Moon\nenjoyed spending time with his family. Morris identified many photographs on\nthe photo board, including some of himself and his family. Some showed Moon\nwith his wife in Hawaii. Others showed Moon with family members celebrating\nspecial occasions such as a graduation ceremony, dressed as Santa Claus, playing\nwith children, posing with his granddaughter, and \u201cclowning around.\u201d One large\nphotograph in the center of the board showed Moon smiling with his arms\noutstretched.\n       Jolene Watson, mother of Moon\u2019s grandson Christopher, considered Moon\nto be a good friend. Watson testified that she, Christopher, and Moon\u2019s son Billy\nwere living with Moon and Catherine as a family when Moon was killed. After\nWatson learned of Moon\u2019s death, she informed Billy. Billy gave the news to his\n\n\n                                        67\n\fmother, whose reaction \u201cwas absolutely horrible.\u201d Watson identified a photograph\nthat depicted Moon at Watson\u2019s high school graduation.\n       Catherine\u2019s daughter Maryann was Moon\u2019s stepdaughter, but Moon treated\nMaryann like his own child. Maryann described the moment she learned of\nMoon\u2019s death as the most painful thing that ever happened to her. She added,\n\u201c[t]here\u2019s just a big gap in our lives.\u201d She described her mother as very lonely and\nempty, and having \u201clost the sparkle in her eye.\u201d\n       \u201cIn a capital trial, evidence showing the direct impact of the defendant\u2019s\nacts on the victims\u2019 friends and family is not barred by the Eighth or Fourteenth\nAmendments to the federal Constitution. (Payne v. Tennessee (1991) 501 U.S.\n808, 825-827.) Under California law, victim impact evidence is admissible at the\npenalty phase under section 190.3, factor (a), as a circumstance of the crime,\nprovided the evidence is not so inflammatory as to elicit from the jury an irrational\nor emotional response untethered to the facts of the case.\u201d (People v. Pollock\n(2004) 32 Cal. 4th 1153, 1180.)\n       Defendant contends section 1191.117 limits the prosecution to a single\nvictim impact witness at the penalty phase. The issue is forfeited because\ndefendant failed to object on this ground in the trial court. (See People v. Kelly\n(2007) 42 Cal. 4th 763, 793 [failure to object to particular victim impact testimony\n\n\n17     In relevant part, section 1191.1 reads as follows: \u201c[T]he next of kin of the\nvictim if the victim has died[ ] have the right to attend all sentencing proceedings\nunder this chapter . . . . [\u00b6] The victim, or up to two of the victim\u2019s parents or\nguardians if the victim is a minor, or the next of kin of the victim if the victim has\ndied, have the right to appear, personally or by counsel, at the sentencing\nproceeding and to reasonably express his, her, or their views concerning the crime,\nthe person responsible, and the need for restitution. The court in imposing\nsentence shall consider the statements of victims, parents or guardians, and next of\nkin made pursuant to this section and shall state on the record its conclusion\nconcerning whether the person would pose a threat to public safety if granted\nprobation.\u201d\n\n                                         68\n\fforfeits issue on appeal]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 353, subd. (a).) Even if the issue were\npreserved, it would fail on its merits because \u201ca trial court has the discretionary\npower under section 1191.1 to hear witnesses who are not strictly victims.\u201d\n(People v. Brown (2003) 31 Cal. 4th 518, 573, fn. 24; see People v. Zamudio\n(2008) 43 Cal. 4th 327, 364-365 [victim impact evidence not limited to testimony\nof a single witness]; People v. Pollock, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 1183 [victim impact\nevidence not limited to testimony of family members].) Defendant provides no\npersuasive reason to reconsider our prior decisions.\n       Next, defendant contends the trial court erroneously admitted victim impact\nevidence that was far more extensive and prejudicial than the evidence held\nadmissible in Payne v. Tennessee. To the contrary, the testimony of Morris,\nWatson, and Maryann was limited to explain the nature of their relationship with\nthe victim, the immediate effects of the murder, and the residual and continuing\nimpact of the murder on their lives. (People v. Brown, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 398;\nsee People v. Ervine (2009) 47 Cal. 4th 745, 792 [victim impact evidence may\ninclude the murder\u2019s effect on friends, coworkers, and the community].)\nAdmission of Watson\u2019s testimony regarding the close relationship the victim had\nwith his son Billy and the emotional impact of the victim\u2019s death on his grandson\nChristopher was not improper, even though neither of those family members\ntestified. \u201cThere is no requirement that family members confine their testimony\nabout the impact of the victim\u2019s death to themselves, omitting mention of other\nfamily members.\u201d (People v. Panah (2005) 35 Cal. 4th 395, 495.) We also\nconclude the number of witnesses was not excessive. (See People v. Taylor\n(2010) 48 Cal. 4th 574, 646 [proper to admit victim impact testimony of six family\nmembers representing four generations of victim\u2019s close family].)\n       Defendant next contends admission of the prosecution\u2019s photo board was\nunduly prejudicial and rendered his trial fundamentally unfair.\n\n                                          69\n\f       Photographic evidence of the victim while alive is relevant and admissible\nas \u201cit portrays the victim as seen by the defendant before the murder.\u201d (People v.\nAnderson (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 543, 594.) Here, there was nothing particularly\ninflammatory about the photographs that might have unfairly influenced the\njurors. The prosecutor properly used them to convey that, as Morris, Watson, and\nMaryann had described, Moon had celebrated and enjoyed life to the fullest.\n       Defendant objected at trial that one particular photograph was inadmissible\nbecause it depicted Moon in a \u201cJesus Christ[-like] pose,\u201d and was used as \u201cnothing\nbut a sympathy ploy.\u201d The photograph depicts Moon by the water looking up\nwhile standing with his arms outstretched. That pose and others on the board that\ndepict Moon with his arms outstretched were in keeping with Morris\u2019s description\nof Moon as one who outwardly expressed his joy for life. Although the\nchallenged photograph was centered on the photo board and larger than the other\nphotographs, the prosecutor placed no special emphasis on the challenged\nphotograph nor did he attribute any religious significance to it. We conclude the\nchallenged photograph was properly admitted as part of the photo board.\n       Defendant contends the prejudicial effect of the photographs was\nestablished by the jury\u2019s request to view the photo board during the course of its\none-day penalty phase deliberations. Although the request was denied, defendant\nargues \u201cthe request itself lays bare the raw emotion present in the jury room and\nthe prejudicial effect\u201d of the photographs on display.\n       The record does not support the claim of prejudice. In refusing the jury\u2019s\nrequest to view the photographs during deliberations, the trial court limited the\nextent to which the photographs could emotionally affect the jurors, and defendant\ncites nothing in the record that suggests the photographs were so inflammatory\nthat they prevented the jurors from making a rational penalty determination.\nEvidence presented at the penalty phase need not be devoid of emotional content.\n\n                                         70\n\f(People v. Lopez (2013) 56 Cal. 4th 1028, 1078.) \u201cThe photographs admitted here,\nand the prosecutor\u2019s use of them in argument, assisted the jury in evaluating the\nconsequences of defendant\u2019s crimes and they were not the type of \u2018irrelevant\ninformation or inflammatory rhetoric that diverts the jury\u2019s attention from its\nproper role or invites an irrational, purely subjective response.\u2019 \u201d (People v.\nThomas, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 825.)\n       Defendant next contends that during rebuttal the prosecutor improperly\nasked the jury to base its penalty decision on a comparison of the virtues of the\nvictim and defendant, by arguing, \u201cI\u2019m asking you to consider everything. But\nview Calvin Chism in the context of what he has done in his lifetime, and compare\nit to those circumstances in aggravation that have been offered to you for your\nconsideration. Then reach an appropriate and truthful verdict.\u201d The prosecutor\nproperly asked the jurors to \u201cconsider everything\u201d and \u201ccompare\u201d defendant\u2019s\nconduct throughout his life in light of all the aggravating evidence in deciding\npenalty. There was no misconduct.\n\n           5. Defendant\u2019s Proposed Jury Instructions\n       Defendant claims the trial court erred in refusing to give certain special\ninstructions requested by the defense. He contends their absence deprived him of\nfederal and state constitutional rights to present a defense, to a fair and reliable\ncapital trial, and to due process of law.\n       Defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction No. 52.16 stated: \u201cThe mitigating\ncircumstances that I have read for your consideration are given to you merely as\nexamples of some of the factors that you may take into account as reasons for\ndeciding not to impose a death sentence in this case. You should pay careful\nattention to each of those factors. Anyone of them may be sufficient, standing\nalone, to support a decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in this\n\n\n\n                                            71\n\fcase. But you should not limit your consideration of mitigating circumstances to\nthese specific factors. [\u00b6] You may also consider any other circumstances relating\nto the case or to the defendant as shown by the evidence as reasons for not\nimposing the death penalty. [\u00b6] A mitigating circumstance does not have to be\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt to exist. You must find that a mitigating\ncircumstance exists if there is any substantial evidence to support it. [\u00b6] Any\nmitigating circumstance presented to you may outweigh all the aggravating\nfactors. You are permitted to use mercy, sympathy, or sentiment in deciding what\nweight to give each mitigating factor.\u201d\n       The trial court properly rejected this instruction. Pursuant to CALJIC No.\n8.85, the court instructed the jury it could consider, take into account, and be\nguided by, among other things, \u201c[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the\ngravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime and any\nsympathetic or other aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record that the\ndefendant offers as a basis for a sentence less than death, whether or not related to\nthe offense for which he is on trial.\u201d We have consistently held this instruction\n\u201cadequately instructs the jury concerning the circumstances that may be\nconsidered in mitigation, including sympathy and mercy.\u201d (People v. Burney\n(2009) 47 Cal. 4th 203, 261.)\n       Defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction No. 52.25 stated: \u201cThere is no\nrequirement that all jurors unanimously agree on any matter offered in mitigation.\nEach juror must make an individual evaluation of each fact or circumstance\noffered in mitigation. Each juror must make his own individual assessment of the\nweight to be given such evidence. Each juror should weigh and consider such\nmatters regardless of whether or not they are accepted by other jurors.\u201d\n       We have held the trial court is \u201cnot required to instruct [the jury] that\nunanimity is not required before a juror may consider evidence to be mitigating.\u201d\n\n                                          72\n\f(People v. Coddington (2000) 23 Cal. 4th 529, 641.) In addition, \u201cCALJIC No.\n8.88 adequately advises jurors on the scope of their discretion to reject death and\nto return a verdict of life without possibility of parole.\u201d (People v. McKinnon\n(2011) 52 Cal. 4th 610, 696.)18 The trial court did not err in refusing the proposed\ninstruction.\n       Defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction No. 52.26 stated: \u201cThe aggravating\nfactors that I have just listed for you may be considered by you, if applicable, and\nestablished by the evidence, in determining the penalty you will impose in this\ncase. These factors that I have listed are the only ones that you may find to be\naggravating factors and you cannot take into account any other facts or\ncircumstances as a basis for imposing the penalty of death on the defendant.\u201d\n       Here, \u201c[t]he court gave the standard sentencing instruction (see CALJIC\nNo. 8.85), and we have held that instruction is proper despite its failure expressly\n\n18      The trial court instructed the jury under CALJIC No. 8.88, in pertinent part,\nas follows: \u201cAfter having heard all of the evidence, and after having heard and\nconsidered the arguments of counsel, you shall consider, take into account, and be\nguided by the applicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances upon\nwhich you have been instructed. [\u00b6] An aggravating factor is any fact, condition\nor event attending the commission of a crime which increases its guilt or enormity,\nor adds to its injurious consequences which is above and beyond the elements of\nthe crime itself. [\u00b6] A mitigating circumstance is any fact, condition or event\nwhich does not constitute a justification or excuse for the crime in question, but\nmay be considered as an extenuating circumstance in determining the\nappropriateness of the death penalty. [\u00b6] The weighing of aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances does not mean a mere mechanical counting of factors on\neach side of an imaginary scale, or the arbitrary assignments of weights to any of\nthem. [\u00b6] You are free to assign whatever moral or sympathetic value you deem\nappropriate to each and all of the various factors you are permitted to consider. [\u00b6]\nIn weighing the various circumstances you determine under the relevant evidence\nwhich penalty is justified and appropriate by considering the totality of the\naggravating circumstances with the totality of the mitigating circumstances. [\u00b6]\nTo return a judgment of death, each of you must be persuaded that the aggravating\ncircumstances are so substantial in comparison with the mitigating circumstances\nthat it warrants death instead of life without parole.\u201d\n\n                                         73\n\fto limit aggravating evidence to the enumerated statutory factors, and to exclude\nnonstatutory factors as a basis for the death penalty. [Citation.]\u201d (People v.\nTaylor (2001) 26 Cal. 4th 1155, 1180.) The trial court properly refused to instruct\nthe jury with proposed jury instruction No. 52.26.\n       Defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction No. 52.32 stated: \u201cThe law of\nCalifornia does not require that you ever vote to impose the penalty of death.\nAfter considering all of the evidence in the case and the instructions given to you\nby the court, it is entirely up to you to determine whether you are convinced that\nthe death penalty is the appropriate punishment under all of the circumstances of\nthe case.\u201d\n       The proposed instruction was duplicative of CALJIC Nos. 8.8419 and 8.88.\n\u201cCALJIC No. 8.84 informed the jurors in this case that state law required that a\ndefendant found guilty of a special circumstance murder be punished by death or\nconfinement in prison for life without the possibility of parole and that \u2018you must\nnow determine which of these penalties shall now be imposed on the defendant.\u2019\n(Italics added.) CALJIC No. 8.88 further advised the jurors that \u2018you determine\nunder the relevant evidence which penalty is justified and appropriate.\u2019 \u201d (People\nv. McKinnon, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 694.) There is no requirement that the trial\ncourt must instruct the jury, pursuant to CALJIC No. 8.88, that \u201cdeath must be the\nappropriate penalty, not just a warranted penalty.\u201d (People v. Moon (2005) 37\n\n\n19      Pursuant to CALJIC No. 8.84, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he\ndefendant in this case has been found guilty of murder of the first degree. The\nallegation [that the] murder was committed under a special circumstance has been\nspecially found to be true. It is the law of this state that the penalty for a defendant\nfound guilty of murder in the first degree shall be death, or a confinement in the\nstate prison for life without the possibility of parole, in any case in which the\nspecial circumstance alleged in this case has been specially found to be true.\nUnder the law of this state, you must now determine which of these penalties shall\nbe imposed on the defendant.\u201d\n\n                                          74\n\fCal. 4th 1, 43.) The trial court properly rejected defendant\u2019s request to give\nproposed jury instruction No. 52.32.\n       The defense also asked the trial court to give proposed jury instructions\nNos. 52.36, 52.39, and 52.39.1. Those proposed instructions would have told the\njurors that \u201cyou must assume that the penalty that each of you chooses will in fact\nbe carried out\u201d (No. 52.36), \u201c[l]ife without the possibility of parole means exactly\nwhat it says the defendant will be imprisoned for the rest of his life\u201d (No. 52.39),\nand \u201c you must assume that a sentence of death means that the defendant will\nsuffer the ultimate penalty and be executed.\u201d However, \u201cbecause of the\n\u2018possibility of appellate reversal or gubernatorial commutation or pardon, it would\nbe inaccurate and therefore erroneous to instruct the jury that if it returns a death\nverdict, the sentence of death will inexorably be carried out.

Wallace (2008) 44 Cal. 4th 1032, 1091.) \u201c[W]e have\nconsistently held that the phrase \u2018life without possibility of parole\u2019 as it appears in\nCALJIC No. 8.84 adequately informs the jury that a defendant sentenced to life\nimprisonment without possibility of parole is ineligible for parole. [Citations.]\nWe also have held that the United States Supreme Court decisions in Kelly v.\nSouth Carolina (2002) 534 U.S. 246, Shafer v. South Carolina (2001) 532 U.S. 36,\nand Simmons v. South Carolina (1994) 512 U.S. 154, do nothing to alter that\nconclusion.\u201d (Ibid.) The trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s request to instruct\nthe jury under defendant\u2019s proposed jury instructions Nos. 52.36, 52.39, and\n52.39.1.\n       Defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction No. 52.38 stated: \u201cEvidence has\nbeen introduced in this case that may arouse in you a natural sympathy for the\nvictim or the victim\u2019s family. [\u00b6] You must not allow such evidence to divert\nyour attention from your proper role in deciding the appropriate punishment in this\n\n\n\n                                          75\n\fcase. [\u00b6] You may not impose the penalty of death as a result of an irrational,\npurely emotional response to this evidence.\u201d\n       In People v. Zamudio, supra, 43 Cal. 4th 327, we listed several reasons why\nthe trial court properly refused to give a similar instruction proposed by the\ndefense. Those reasons apply here as well. \u201cFirst, the substance of the requested\ninstruction, insofar as it correctly stated the law, was adequately covered by the\nslightly modified version of CALJIC 8.84.1 the trial court gave;[20] \u2018[t]he\nproposed instruction would not have provided the jury with any information it had\nnot otherwise learned from CALJIC No. 8.84.1 . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] Second, the\nrequested instruction is misleading to the extent it indicates that emotions may\nplay no part in a juror\u2019s decision to opt for the death penalty. Although jurors\nmust never be influenced by passion or prejudice, at the penalty phase, they \u2018may\nproperly consider in aggravation, as a circumstance of the crime, the impact of a\ncapital defendant\u2019s crimes on the victim\u2019s family, and in so doing [they] may\nexercise sympathy for the defendant\u2019s murder victims and . . . their bereaved\nfamily members. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Because the proposed instruction was\nmisleading . . . , and because the point was adequately covered by the instructions\nthat the court did give, the trial court acted correctly in refusing to use\u2019 the\ninstruction defendant proposed. [Citation.]\u201d (People v. Zamudio, supra, 43\nCal.4th at pp. 368-369, fn. omitted.) The trial court properly rejected defendant\u2019s\nrequest that it instruct the jury with proposed jury instruction No. 52.38.\n       We conclude the trial court properly refused defendant\u2019s proposed\ninstructions.\n\n20     The court instructed with CALJIC No. 8.84.1, which, as relevant here, told\nthe jurors \u201c[y]ou must neither be influenced by bias, nor prejudice against the\ndefendant, nor be swayed by public opinion or public feelings. Both the People\nand the defendant have a right to expect that you will consider all of the evidence,\nfollow the law, exercise your discretion conscientiously, and reach a just verdict.\u201d\n\n                                           76\n\f            6. Cumulative Error\n       Defendant contends the cumulative effect of the asserted penalty phase\nerrors requires reversal of his convictions and death sentence even if none of the\nerrors individually compels reversal. We conclude any errors or assumed errors\nwere not prejudicial, whether viewed separately or cumulatively.\n\n            7. Attempted Robbery Felony-murder Special-circumstance Allegation\n       Defendant was found death-eligible based on the jury\u2019s true finding on the\nattempted robbery felony-murder special-circumstance allegation. He contends\nimposition of his death sentence violates international law and the Eighth\nAmendment\u2019s proportionality requirement, in the absence of a finding that he\nintended to kill the victim or exhibited reckless indifference to life as a major\nparticipant in the robbery. These claims have no merit.\n       \u201cThe felony-based special circumstances do not require that the defendant\nintend to kill. It is sufficient if the defendant is the actual killer or either intends to\nkill or \u2018with reckless indifference to human life and as a major participant, aids,\nabets, counsels, commands, induces, solicits, requests, or assists in the\ncommission\u2019 of the felony.

Reeves (1998) 524 U.S. 88, 99, the state must\nprove the actual killer had a culpable mental state].)\n       Imposition of the death penalty absent a finding of a culpable mental state\nfor an actual killer does not violate international law because international law\ndoes not prohibit a sentence of death rendered in accordance with state and federal\nconstitutional and statutory requirements. (See People v. Watkins (2012) 55\nCal. 4th 999, 1034; People v. Taylor, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 661.)\n       We decline defendant\u2019s request to reconsider these prior holdings.\n\n\n\n\n                                            77\n\f           8. Challenges to California\u2019s Death Penalty Law\n       Defendant raises numerous challenges to California\u2019s death penalty law\nunder the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal\nConstitution. We have consistently rejected each claim, and defendant offers no\npersuasive reason to reconsider our prior decisions.\n       \u201cSection 190.2 is not impermissibly broad in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment.\u201d (People v. Loker (2008) 44 Cal. 4th 691, 755.) \u201cThe sentencing\nfactor of \u2018circumstances of the crime\u2019 (\u00a7 190.3, factor (a)) is not unconstitutionally\nvague and does not result in the arbitrary and capricious imposition of the death\npenalty.\u201d (People v. Valencia (2008) 43 Cal. 4th 268, 310.)\n       \u201cThe jury need not make written findings, or achieve unanimity as to\nspecific aggravating circumstances, or find beyond a reasonable doubt that an\naggravating circumstance is proved (except for other crimes), that aggravating\ncircumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances, or that death is the appropriate\npenalty. [Citations.] The death penalty statute is not unconstitutional for failing to\nprovide the jury with instructions of the burden of proof and standard of proof for\nfinding aggravating and mitigating circumstances in reaching a penalty\ndetermination.\u201d (People v. Morrison (2004) 34 Cal. 4th 698, 730\u2013731.)\n       \u201cIncluding in the list of potential mitigating factors adjectives such as\n\u2018extreme\u2019 (\u00a7 190.3, factors (d), (g)) and \u2018substantial\u2019 (id. factor (g)) does not erect\nan impermissible barrier to the jury\u2019s consideration of mitigating evidence.\u201d\n(People v. Valdez, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 180.) \u201cIntercase proportionality review\nis not required. [Citation.] Use of prior criminal activity in aggravation was\nproper.

Defendant\u2019s Prior Juvenile Adjudication for Assault with a Firearm\n       After a court trial held prior to sentencing, defendant was found to have\nsuffered a prior serious or violent felony conviction for purposes of sentence\nenhancement under the Three Strikes law. The trial court\u2019s finding was based on\ndefendant\u2019s juvenile adjudication for assault with a firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (b)) for\nhis involvement in the Arnold Park incident. Applying the second strike provision\nof the Three Strikes Law, the court doubled defendant\u2019s sentence for the Riteway\nrobbery. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d).)\n       Relying on Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466, defendant\ncontends the trial court improperly doubled his sentence for his conviction of the\nRiteway robbery in violation of his federal constitutional because prior juvenile\nadjudications are not proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n       After defendant filed his opening brief, we decided in People v. Nguyen\n(2009) 46 Cal. 4th 1007, 1028, that \u201cthe absence of a constitutional or statutory\nright to jury trial under the juvenile law does not, under Apprendi, preclude the use\nof a prior juvenile adjudication of criminal misconduct to enhance the maximum\nsentence for a subsequent adult felony offense by the same person.\u201d We decline\ndefendant\u2019s request to reconsider that decision.\n\n           10. Imposition of Upper Terms on Counts Two and Three and the\n               Firearm Enhancements on Counts One and Three\n       Citing Cunningham v. California (2007) 549 U.S. 270, defendant contends\nthe trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial by erroneously\nsentencing him to upper terms for attempted robbery (count two) and second\ndegree robbery (count three) and for the firearm enhancements imposed (former\n\n\n\n                                         79\n\f\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)(1)) as to counts one (first degree murder) and three21 based\non facts neither found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt nor admitted by\ndefendant.\n       In imposing upper terms for counts two and three and the firearm\nenhancements as to counts one and three, the trial court said \u201cthe factors in\naggravation greatly outweigh those in mitigation\u201d and specifically found as\nfollows: (1) all of the crimes involved great violence, the threat of great bodily\ninjury, viciousness, and callousness; (2) both victims were particularly vulnerable\ngiven they were alone and unarmed; (3) defendant was in a position of leadership\nand induced Johnson to participate in the attempted robbery; (4) the manner in\nwhich the crimes were carried out reflected planning, sophistication, and\nprofessionalism; defendant \u201cha[d] an entourage that he . . . recruit[ed] to commit\nthe robberies;\u201d before defendant entered the store, he sent someone inside to look\nfor clerks and cameras; (5) a firearm was used in each robbery; (6) defendant\nengaged in violent conduct indicating a threat to society; and (7) defendant had\nrecently been paroled.\n       \u201cApprendi v. New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466, holds that, under the Sixth\nAmendment, \u2018any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed\nstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\u2019 [Citation.] In Blakely v. Washington (2004) 542 U.S. 296, the high court\nextended the scope of Apprendi by defining \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 as the\n\u2018maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected\nin the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u2019 [Citations.] Applying Blakely,\nthe court later held in Cunningham v. California, supra, 549 U.S. 270, that\nCalifornia\u2019s determinate sentencing law did not comport with a defendant\u2019s Sixth\n\n\n21     The trial court stayed defendant\u2019s sentence on count two.\n\n                                         80\n\fAmendment jury trial right. As Cunningham explained, \u2018If the jury\u2019s verdict alone\ndoes not authorize the sentence, if, instead, the judge must find an additional fact\nto impose the longer term, the Sixth Amendment requirement is not satisfied.\u2019\n(Cunningham, at p. 290.) Because the aggravating circumstances necessary for\nimposition of an upper term \u2018depend on facts found discretely and solely by the\njudge\u2019 (id. at p. 288), the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 prescribed in California\u2019s\nsentencing scheme is not the upper term but rather the middle term (ibid.).\u201d\n(People v. Myles (2012) 53 Cal. 4th 1181, 1220.)\n       In People v. Black (2007) 41 Cal. 4th 799 (Black), we explained that \u201cthe\nimposition of the upper term does not infringe upon the defendant\u2019s constitutional\nright to jury trial so long as one legally sufficient aggravating circumstance has\nbeen found to exist by the jury, has been admitted by the defendant, or is justified\nbased upon the defendant\u2019s record of prior convictions.\u201d (Id. at p. 816.) This\nexception \u201cinclude[s] not only the fact that a prior conviction occurred, but also\nother related issues that may be determined by examining the records of the prior\nconvictions.\u201d (Id. at p. 819.) For example, the trial court\u2019s finding that the\ndefendant\u2019s prior convictions were \u201c \u2018numerous or of increasing seriousness\u2019 \u201d\nfalls within this exception for a defendant\u2019s recidivism. (Id. at pp. 818-819; see\nid., p. 820.) \u201cThe determinations whether a defendant has suffered prior\nconvictions, and whether those convictions are \u2018numerous or of increasing\nseriousness\u2019 (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.421(b)(2)), require consideration of only\nthe number, dates, and offenses of the prior convictions alleged. The relative\nseriousness of these alleged convictions may be determined simply by reference to\nthe range of punishment provided by statute for each offense. This type of\ndetermination is \u2018quite different from the resolution of the issues submitted to a\njury, and is one more typically and appropriately undertaken by a court.\u2019 \u201d (Id. at\npp. 819-820.)\n\n                                         81\n\f       In People v. Towne (2008) 44 Cal. 4th 63, 80-81, we held that imposition of\nan upper term based on the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant was on\nprobation or parole at the time the offense was committed did not violate the\ndefendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under Cunningham. Similarly,\nin this case the trial court\u2019s reliance on its finding that defendant had recently been\nparoled to impose the upper terms on counts two and three and the firearm\nenhancements imposed under former section 12022.5, subdivision (a)(1), on\ncounts one and three, was permissible under Cunningham. (See People v.\nMoberly (2009) 176 Cal. App. 4th 1191, 1198 [\u201cthe dual use of a fact or facts to\naggravate both a base term and the sentence on an enhancement is not\nprohibited\u201d]; People v. Price (1984) 151 Cal. App. 3d 803, 812 & fn. 5 [\u201ca trial\ncourt may use the same fact(s) to impose more than one aggravated term provided\nthe fact is reasonably related to the particular count\u201d and \u201cthe fact has not already\nbeen or will not be used to impose either an enhancement or a consecutive term\u201d].)\nAccordingly, defendant was not deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to a jury\ntrial under Cunningham.\n\n           11. Conduct Credits\n       At sentencing, the trial court awarded defendant 643 days of custody\ncredits. Defendant contends the trial court erroneously relied on section 2933.2 to\ndeny him any presentence conduct credits.\n       Subdivision (a) of section 2933.2 prohibits any person convicted of murder\nfrom accruing any presentence conduct or work time credit. However, the statute\napplies only to offenses committed after its effective date of June 3, 1998.\n(\u00a7 2933.2, subd. (d), as approved by voters (Prop. 222) June 2, 1998; see People v.\nHutchins (2001) 90 Cal. App. 4th 1308, 1317). Because defendant committed his\ncrimes on June 12, 1997, any good time or work time credits are governed by\n\n\n\n                                          82\n\fsection former section 4019, which provided that a defendant convicted of a crime\nenumerated in section 667.5 will receive one day of conduct credit for each six-\nday period of confinement during which he complies with the rules and\nregulations of the facility. (Former \u00a7 4019, subds. (a)(1), (c), (f), as amended by\nStats. 1982, ch. 1234, \u00a7 7, p. 4553.) Under section 2933.1, subdivision (c),\nhowever, \u201cthe maximum credit that may be earned against a period of confinement\nin, or commitment to, a county jail . . . following arrest and prior to placement in\nthe custody of the Director of Corrections, shall not exceed 15 percent of the\nactual period of confinement for any person specified in subdivision (a).\u201d\nSubdivision (a) of that statute, which imposes a limitation on the number of work\ntime credits that may be awarded (an issue not relevant here), applies to \u201cany\nperson who is convicted of a felony offense listed in subdivision (c) of Section\n667.5.\u201d (\u00a7 2933.1, subd. (a).)\n       Defendant\u2019s convictions for murder and attempted robbery are listed under\nsection 667.5, subdivision (c)(1) (murder) and (9) (robbery) and thus he is a\nperson specified in subdivision (a) of section 2933.1. Therefore, the combined\ntotal of defendant\u2019s presentence conduct credits awarded under former section\n4019 may not exceed 15 percent of his actual period of confinement. (\u00a7 2933.1,\nsubd. (c); People v. Palacios (1997) 56 Cal. App. 4th 252, 258.) Accordingly,\ndefendant is entitled to 96 days of conduct credit (15 percent of 643 presentence\ndays of confinement). (Former \u00a7 4019, subds. (a)(1), (c), (f).)\n\n\n\n\n                                         83\n\f                                III. DISPOSITION\n       Defendant is entitled to 96 days of conduct credit under former section\n4019, subdivisions (a)(1), (c), (f). The superior court is directed to modify the\nabstract of judgment to reflect that defendant is entitled to 96 days of conduct\ncredit. (\u00a7 2933.1, subdivision (c).) In all other respects, including the verdict of\ndeath, the judgment is affirmed.\n                                                         CHIN, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.J.\nBAXTER, J.\nWERDEGAR, J.\nCORRIGAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                          84\n\f      CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION BY KENNARD, J.\n\n\n       I join the majority in upholding defendant\u2019s convictions for murder, robbery,\nand attempted robbery, as well as his death sentence. But I disagree with the\nmajority\u2019s rejection of defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred when it applied the\n\u201cThree Strikes\u201d law (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) to\ndouble his five-year sentence for robbery. (See maj. opn., ante, at p. 79.)\n       Defendant argues that because his prior \u201cstrike\u201d was an adjudication in\njuvenile court, as to which he had no right to trial by jury, the federal\nConstitution\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial barred the trial court from\nusing the prior juvenile adjudication to double his sentence for robbery. The\nmajority disagrees, relying on this court\u2019s previous rejection of a similar claim in\nPeople v. Nguyen (2009) 46 Cal. 4th 1007 (Nguyen).\n       I dissented in Nguyen. As my dissent explained, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment\u2019s\nright to a jury trial does not permit a trial court to impose additional punishment\nthat is based on prior juvenile conduct for which there was no right to a jury trial.\u201d\n(Nguyen, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 1034 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) Thus, the trial\ncourt here erred in using defendant\u2019s prior juvenile adjudication to double\ndefendant\u2019s sentence for robbery. Therefore, I would direct the clerk of the\nsuperior court to modify the judgment by dismissing defendant\u2019s prior \u201cstrike\u201d and\nby reducing his robbery sentence to an undoubled term of five years.\n\n\n                                           KENNARD, J.*\n\n\n*      Retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, assigned by the Chief\nJustice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.\n\f          CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION BY LIU, J.\n\n\n       Defendant Calvin Chism, a black man, was sentenced to death for the\nmurder of Richard Moon, a white store clerk. At the first penalty phase, the jury\nhung 10-2 in favor of death. It is undisputed that the two holdouts were black\nwomen. In selecting the second penalty-phase jury, the prosecutor exercised\nperemptory strikes against the first two black jurors available for challenge. When\ndefendant challenged both strikes as racially motivated (see Batson v. Kentucky\n(1986) 476 U.S. 79 (Batson); People v. Wheeler (1978) 22 Cal. 3d 258 (Wheeler)),\nthe prosecutor gave reasons for each strike. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s\nmotions, and this court now upholds the trial court\u2019s rulings.\n       Today\u2019s opinion marks the second time in 12 months that this court has\nrejected a claim of improper discrimination in jury selection despite indications in\nthe record that the strike of a black female juror was substantially motivated by\ndiscriminatory intent. (See People v. Williams (2013) 56 Cal. 4th 630, 698 (dis.\nopn. of Werdegar, J.) [\u201cas to at least two African-American women called as\nprospective jurors, the prosecutor engaged in purposeful discrimination in\nexercising his challenges\u201d]; id. at p. 718 (dis. opn. of Liu, J.) [same].)\n       Prospective Juror J.S., the second black juror struck by the prosecutor, was\na telephone circuit designer who worked her way up from a clerk position over a\n30-year career at Pacific Bell. For the past 20 years, she had trained others on how\nto design circuits. She had two adult children as well as a 12-year-old. She had\n\fpreviously served on a jury in a criminal case and in a civil case, both of which\nreached a verdict. At voir dire, she said she would be willing to vote for either\ndeath or life without parole, and that her decision would depend on the evidence.\nShe said she would be willing to express her views and would be open to listening\nto others. She repeatedly said she would be willing to vote for the death penalty in\nan appropriate case.\n       In striking this juror, the prosecutor gave two reasons related to\ndecisionmaking ability: (1) lack of supervisory experience in the workplace and\n(2) lack of experience handling stressful situations in life. The record reveals no\nsupport for the second reason, and the trial court refused a defense request to\nreopen voir dire specifically to examine whether J.S. had dealt with stressful\nsituations in her life. As to the first reason, the record does not support the\nprosecutor\u2019s characterization of J.S.\u2019s position at Pacific Bell, and at least three\nseated white jurors had no supervisory role in their current jobs. Considering all\nrelevant circumstances in the record before us, I find it difficult to conclude that\nthe prosecutor\u2019s strike of J.S. was not motivated in substantial part by improper\ndiscrimination. Accordingly, I dissent from that aspect of today\u2019s decision.\n                                           I.\n       In Snyder v. Louisiana (2008) 552 U.S. 472 (Snyder), the high court made\nclear that \u201c \u2018[t]he Constitution forbids striking even a single prospective juror for a\ndiscriminatory purpose[.]\u2019 \u201d (Id. at p. 478.) Snyder, a capital case, focused on the\nstrike of a single black juror, Jeffrey Brooks, whom the prosecutor described (1) as\nhaving a \u201c \u2018nervous\u2019 \u201d demeanor and (2) as possibly prone to convict the\ndefendant of a lesser crime, thus avoiding a penalty phase, in order \u201c \u2018to go home\nquickly\u2019 \u201d and fulfill his obligations as a student teacher. (Ibid.) The high court\nrefused to credit the first reason because \u201cthe record [did] not show that the trial\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fjudge actually made a determination concerning Mr. Brooks\u2019 demeanor.\u201d (Id. at\np. 479.)\n       As to the second reason, Snyder concluded that it \u201cfails even under the\nhighly deferential standard\u201d applicable on habeas review. (Snyder, supra, 552\nU.S. at p. 479; see id. at p. 478 [applying \u201c \u2018clear error\u2019 \u201d standard].) The high\ncourt said the possibility that Mr. Brooks would vote to convict on a lesser offense\nin order to end the case quickly was \u201chighly speculative.\u201d (Id. at p. 482.) Further,\nthe court found the strike \u201csuspicious\u201d because \u201cthe prosecutor anticipated on the\nrecord during voir dire\u201d that the trial would be brief, because \u201cMr. Brooks\u2019 dean\npromised to \u2018work with\u2019 Mr. Brooks to see that he was able to make up any\nstudent-teaching time that he missed due to jury service,\u201d and because \u201cthe trial\noccurred relatively early in the fall semester,\u201d thus giving Mr. Brooks \u201cmany\nweeks\u201d to make up any lost teaching time. (Id. at pp. 482\u2013483.) Finally, the court\nsaid \u201c[t]he implausibility of this explanation is reinforced by the prosecutor\u2019s\nacceptance of white jurors who disclosed conflicting obligations that appear to\nhave been at least as serious as Mr. Brooks\u2019.\u201d (Id. at p. 483; see id. at p. 484\n[comparing Mr. Brooks to two white jurors with \u201curgent\u201d or \u201cmore pressing\u201d work\nor family obligations].) In light of these circumstances, Snyder concluded that the\nprosecutor\u2019s strike of Mr. Brooks was \u201cmotivated in substantial part by\ndiscriminatory intent.\u201d (Id. at p. 485.)\n       As explained below, the prosecutor\u2019s strike of J.S. in this case is no less\nsuspicious than the strike of Mr. Brooks in Snyder.\n                                           A.\n       During voir dire on March 5, 2001, Prospective Juror J.S. introduced\nherself as a telephone circuit designer for Pacific Bell. She had graduated from\nhigh school and attended two years of college, studying business administration.\nWhile in school, she did clerical work at the Los Angeles County \u201cDepartment of\n\n                                           3\n\fJustice\u201d or \u201cDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d At the time of voir dire, she had worked\nfor Pacific Bell for 30 years, initially as \u201ca clerk for awhile, and then I moved on\nup.\u201d When asked whether she \u201cever supervised any employees,\u201d J.S. said, \u201cNo. I\ndo a lot of training.\u201d J.S. proceeded to explain that for about 20 years, she had\nbeen training others on how to design circuits on a computer.\n       J.S. had previously served on a jury in a criminal trial and in a civil trial. In\nboth instances, the jury reached a verdict. The criminal case concerned child\nmolestation, and the civil case involved personal injuries. J.S. was divorced; her\nformer husband was a plumber. She had two adult sons and a 12-year-old son, as\nwell as three grandchildren.\n       On March 2, 2001, the court had asked J.S. about her views on the death\npenalty. J.S. said she would neither automatically vote for death nor automatically\nvote against death. When the court asked for her \u201cgeneral views on the death\npenalty,\u201d J.S. said, \u201cI would have to hear the evidence.\u201d The court then asked, \u201cSo\nif you heard the evidence, and you were instructed on the law, if you were\nconvinced that death was the appropriate penalty, you could vote for that?\u201d J.S.\nreplied, \u201cYes.\u201d The court also asked, \u201cIf you were convinced that life without\nparole was appropriate, could you vote for that?\u201d J.S. replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\n       On March 5, 2001, in response to questions from the prosecutor, J.S. said\nshe understood she would have to weigh each piece of evidence, to decide whether\nit was aggravating or mitigating, and to choose the appropriate penalty. At that\npoint, the prosecutor asked, \u201cWith all that in mind, and understanding that before\nyou\u2019re asked to exercise your choice you will be presented evidence, do you feel\nthat you would always choose life over death?\u201d J.S. replied, \u201cNo.\u201d The\nprosecutor then asked, \u201cDo you feel the other way, that you would always choose\ndeath over life?\u201d J.S. said, \u201cNo.\u201d The voir dire continued: \u201c[Prosecutor]: At this\njuncture, are you prepared, if in your mind you think death is an appropriate\n\n                                           4\n\fpenalty, to come back with a verdict of death? [\u00b6] [J.S.]: Yes. [\u00b6] [Prosecutor]:\nYou understand that\u2019s what would be required if you think death is appropriate?\n[\u00b6] [J.S.]: Yes. [\u00b6] [Prosecutor]: You can do that? [\u00b6] [J.S.]: Yes.\u201d\n       J.S. then gave the following answers to questions from defense counsel and\nthe court: \u201c[Defense counsel]: . . . [Y]ou can assure us that you will express your\nviews and listen to others, right? [\u00b6] [J.S.]: Yes. . . . [\u00b6] [Defense counsel]: In\nother words, if you have an opinion and the a [sic] majority disagrees with you,\nyou will state your opinion? [\u00b6] You won\u2019t be a shrinking violet? [\u00b6] [J.S.]: No.\n[\u00b6] The Court: You are not going to change your mind to accommodate some\nother people, are you? [\u00b6] [J.S.]: No. [\u00b6] [Defense counsel]: By the same token,\nif you listen to them, you do believe that you might be right \u2014 you will be open to\nlistening to them? [\u00b6] [J.S.]: Yes. [\u00b6] [Defense counsel]: And you understand\nthat the final ultimate decision on your vote is your measuring stick, your opinion?\n[\u00b6] [J.S.]: Yes. [\u00b6] [Defense counsel]: Both sides are entitled to that, correct? [\u00b6]\n[J.S.]: Yes.\u201d\n       The prosecutor exercised her fourth peremptory challenge against F.J., the\nfirst black juror available for challenge, and the trial court denied defendant\u2019s\nBatson motion. On March 6, 2001, after the parties exercised additional strikes,\nthe prosecutor struck J.S., who was the second black juror available for challenge.\nDefense counsel again objected. At sidebar, defense counsel observed that J.S.\n\u201cseemed like an idea [sic] juror. She had two priors, both \u2014 one civil, one\ncriminal. There was a verdict. She has worked for many, many, many years at\nPacific Bell. Worked her way up. She supervised people. She trains. She\nobviously can make decisions. She worked \u2014 and just otherwise seems to be a\ngood juror. [\u00b6] I can\u2019t see any reason why the district attorney would not accept\nher, other than the fact she is a black female. [\u00b6] And I would note that the last\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fjury which hung, the two hangs were black females. But that should not be a\nbasis.\u201d\n          The court responded: \u201cOf course, [the prosecutor] has relied on life\u2019s\nexperience criteria in the past. [\u00b6] . . . . [\u00b6] This juror has trained people. I don\u2019t\nrecall that she supervised anybody. I believe she has trained people on how to use\nthe computer design circuits.\u201d\n          The prosecutor responded: \u201cMy recollection is that she specifically said\nshe did not supervise anybody. [\u00b6] From what I can glean from her job assignment\nis she\u2019s got a very fancy, but misleading, job description, which she is basically,\nfrom my understanding, she is into data entry. She makes no decisions. She is\ngiven specifications and she inputs that information into a computer. She is\nbasically a more sophisticated form of a filing clerk. And, basically, she\u2019s held\nnothing but clerk positions. She has trained individuals in terms of inputting data.\nShe is a data entry specialist, basically.\n          \u201cI don\u2019t think the fact she trains people in how they input data makes her\nspecifically qualified for high-stress decision-making jobs. And that\u2019s basically\nwhat this is. This is going to be a very stressful, deliberative process. It also\nrequires individuals who are seasoned decision makers. They could handle the\nstress of a tough decision. [\u00b6] . . . .\n          \u201cI\u2019ve looked at her job description. She has basically been in clerk\npositions. If I were to not kick her, it seems to me that it would only be because\nshe is an African American. And I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019m going to discriminate in\none direction or the other. I\u2019m not going to keep her simply because she is\nAfrican American. I have confidence in the fact that good people with experience\ncan be fair to an African American male.\n          \u201cI don\u2019t think that it is essential that an African American sit on the jury. I\nthink it would be wonderful if we can find individuals who I feel are seasoned\n\n                                             6\n\fdecision makers who can handle the stress of the situation. But there\u2019s absolutely\nnothing about her background that tells me that she can operate in a high-stress\nsituation. And that\u2019s very important in this type of case where the issue is life and\ndeath. It\u2019s going to be extremely stressful.\u201d\n       At that point, the trial court said: \u201cThe D.A.\u2019s comments have been non-\nsolicited. I asked a prima facie showing, that prima facie showing has not been\nmade.\u201d Defense counsel disputed the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of J.S.\u2019s work\nexperience and explained that J.S.\u2019s long work history, experience as a trainer, and\nmiddle age (\u201cshe is at least in her 50s, probably older\u201d) would make her a good\njuror. The court said, \u201cHer position in the Department of Justice was filing,\u201d and\nthen added, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t necessary [sic] agree or disagree with the criteria that the\nD.A. is using as far as whether I would if I were a D.A., but that\u2019s a non-race\nbased criteria. And her use of the peremptory as to this juror was consistent with\nthat non-suspect category use.\u201d\n       After further argument by defense counsel, the prosecutor said, \u201cBut I want\nto add that it\u2019s not just supervisory positions that I look for. I look for how they\nhandled stressful situations or incidences in their life.\u201d Defense counsel then\nasked, \u201cMay I inquire, this Juror was asked whether or not she has ever had to deal\nwith stress in her life, specifically?\u201d The court responded, \u201cI don\u2019t recall that\nspecific question. But there were questions about her life.\u201d At that point, defense\ncounsel said, \u201cThere would be a request to reopen general voir dire on behalf of\nMr. Chism so we can explore that possibility with [J.S.].\u201d The prosecutor objected\nand, without disputing that J.S. had not been asked about stressful life experiences,\nsaid, \u201cHow a person deals with stress and how they recognize it as stress will vary\nfrom individual to individual. I know what I go on; their ability to deal with stress\nis one of the things I look at, including their ability to make decisions.\u201d Without\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\ffurther analysis, the court said, \u201cThe voir dire was appropriately conducted. The\nrequest is denied.\u201d\n       The only other identified black woman on the panel, M.G., was excused for\ncause because she said she would never impose the death penalty. In the end, the\njury that made the penalty decision consisted of 11 white jurors and one black\nman, A.D., who was a former correctional officer and current correctional\ncounselor with the federal Bureau of Prisons. A.D. had served on three juries, all\nof which reached a verdict. During his voir dire, the court said, \u201cAnd I take it if\nthere is a disturbance in the institution, it\u2019s a stressful situation,\u201d and asked\nwhether A.D. \u201cdeal[t] with stress every day in [his] life.\u201d A.D. answered in the\naffirmative. A.D. also noted that he was the union president, that he had had law\nenforcement and weapons training, and that he had friends in most law\nenforcement agencies.\n                                           B.\n       Although the trial court found no prima facie case of discrimination in\ndenying defendant\u2019s Batson motion with respect to J.S., today\u2019s opinion properly\nconcludes that \u201cthe trial court ruled ultimately that the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons\nwere genuine and race neutral, and therefore . . . the question whether defendant\nmade a prima facie showing of racial discrimination is rendered moot.\u201d (Maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 52.) The question before us is whether an examination of \u201call of\nthe circumstances\u201d bearing on the prosecutor\u2019s strike of J.S. reveals purposeful\ndiscrimination. (Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at p. 478.) For several reasons, I believe\nit does.\n       First, the prosecutor struck J.S., a black juror, in a capital penalty trial\nwhere the defendant was a black man convicted of murdering a white victim. We\nhave noted the obvious relevance of this racial dynamic, as has the high court.\n(See People v. Taylor (2010) 48 Cal. 4th 574, 608 [\u201c \u2018[A]dequate inquiry into\n\n                                            8\n\fpossible racial bias is . . . essential in a case in which an African-American\ndefendant is charged with commission of a capital crime against a White victim.\u2019\n(People v. Holt (1997) 15 Cal. 4th 619, 660; see also Mu\u2019Min v. Virginia (1991)\n500 U.S. 415, 424 . . . .)\u201d]; People v. Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 281 [\u201c[T]he\ndefendant need not be a member of the excluded group in order to complain of a\nviolation of the representative cross-section rule; yet if he is, and especially if in\naddition his alleged victim is a member of the group to which the majority of the\nremaining jurors belong, these facts may also be called to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d];\nPowers v. Ohio (1991) 499 U.S. 400, 416 (Powers) [\u201cRacial identity between the\ndefendant and the excused person might in some cases be the explanation for the\nprosecution\u2019s adoption of the forbidden stereotype, and if the alleged race bias\ntakes this form, it may provide one of the easier cases to establish both a prima\nfacie case and a conclusive showing that wrongful discrimination has occurred.\u201d].)\n       Second, in objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s strike of J.S., defense counsel\nobserved that the first penalty-phase jury hung because two black female jurors\nrefused to vote for death. On appeal, defendant quoted this observation in his\nbriefing and mentioned it repeatedly at oral argument. The accuracy of the\nobservation was never disputed by the prosecutor, the trial court, or the Attorney\nGeneral on appeal. Moreover, neither the prosecutor, the trial court, nor the\nAttorney General ever disputed the prosecutor\u2019s awareness that the two holdouts\nwere black women. Plainly, the uncontested observation that two black female\njurors refused to vote for death in the first penalty trial heightens the possibility\nthat improper discrimination informed the prosecutor\u2019s strike of J.S., the only\ndeath-qualified black woman on the panel.\n       Third, although today\u2019s opinion says \u201cthe fact that the jury included an\nAfrican-American \u2018is an indication of good faith [by the prosecutor] in exercising\nperemptories\u2019 \u201d (maj. opn., ante, at p. 54), I am doubtful that much can be inferred\n\n                                           9\n\ffrom the prosecutor\u2019s failure to strike seated Juror A.D., a correctional counselor\nwith strong professional and personal ties to law enforcement. Given A.D.\u2019s\nbackground, it would have been odd and clearly suspicious for the prosecutor to\nstrike A.D.\n       Fourth, and most importantly, a review of the record casts doubt on the\nprosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for striking J.S. In explaining the strike, the prosecutor\ntook the view that a capital sentencing proceeding \u201crequires individuals who are\nseasoned decision makers.\u201d The prosecutor said that in selecting \u201cindividuals who\nI feel are seasoned decision makers who can handle the stress of the situation,\u201d she\nconsidered two indicators: (1) \u201csupervisory positions\u201d in employment and (2)\n\u201chow they handled stressful situations or incidences in their life.\u201d According to\nthe prosecutor, these were the criteria that motivated her to strike J.S. These\nreasons thus comprise the sole focus of our review. (See Miller-El v. Dretke\n(2005) 545 U.S. 231, 252 (Miller-El) [\u201c[W]hen illegitimate grounds like race are\nin issue, a prosecutor simply has got to state his reasons as best he can and stand or\nfall on the plausibility of the reasons he gives. A Batson challenge does not call\nfor a mere exercise in thinking up any rational basis. If the stated reason does not\nhold up, its pretextual significance does not fade because a trial judge, or an\nappeals court, can imagine a reason that might not have been shown up as\nfalse.\u201d].)\n       As to the first criterion, it is true that J.S. said during voir dire that she had\nnot supervised any employees. The prosecutor was entitled to rely on this\ncriterion as long as she applied it evenhandedly to all jurors, regardless of race.\nHowever, at least two white jurors, L.F. and K.K., who were already empaneled at\nthe time the prosecutor struck J.S., also had no supervisory experience, and a third\nseated white juror, W.B., had no supervisory role in his current job and only a\nminor supervisory role in a previous job.\n\n                                           10\n\f       L.F. was an administrative assistant at Boeing who handled worker\u2019s\ncompensation and medical claims. During voir dire, the prosecutor asked L.F.\nabout her job, as follows:\n       \u201c[The prosecutor]: You make decisions as to whether or not claims will be\napproved or rejected?\n       \u201c[L.F.]: No, ma\u2019am.\n       \u201c[The prosecutor]: What is [sic] your job duties with respect to that?\n       \u201c[L.F.]: I\u2019m a buffer between the injured worker and the insurance carrier.\nI do a lot of problem solving to eliminate that.\n       \u201c[The prosecutor]: Your [sic] a facilitator?\n       \u201c[L.F.]: Yes, uh-huh.\n       \u201c[The prosecutor]: How long have you been engaged in that particular job\nassignment?\n       \u201c[L.F.]: Probably off and on about 20 years at Boeing.\n       ....\n       \u201c[The prosecutor]: Do you work with other individuals on your job?\n       \u201c[L.F.]: Yes.\n       \u201c[The prosecutor]: Can you tell me about that?\n       \u201c[L.F.]: We have workers\u2019 comp and the leave of absence are in the same\narea. And so there is cross-training. [\u00b6] I have no decision making in what I do,\nbut I can consult, of course, with other people on decisions to be made.\u201d\n       \u201c[The prosecutor]: Okay. [\u00b6] So if a problem arises that requires a\ndecision, are you responsible for bringing it to somebody else\u2019s attention?\n       \u201c[L.F.]: Yes.\n       \u201c[The prosecutor]: Do you also discuss pertinent information with that\nindividual who would make the ultimate decision?\n       \u201c[L.F.]: Sometimes.\n\n                                         11\n\f       \u201c[The prosecutor]: Do you have some input?\n       \u201c[L.F.]: Yes.\n       \u201c[The prosecutor]: Apart from that, you basically facilitate the making of\nthe claim and the processing of the claim?\n       \u201c[L.F.]: Yes.\u201d\n       K.K. was a lab technician at Raytheon, a position he had held for 15 years.\nThe prosecutor asked K.K., \u201cWhat specifically do you do?\u201d K.K. replied,\n\u201cMetallurgy and electronic failure analysis.\u201d K.K. said he had an advanced degree\nin finance. When the prosecutor asked whether he \u201cever had to supervise\nemployees,\u201d K.K. said, \u201cBasically, we\u2019re self-helping each other. [\u00b6] . . . . [\u00b6] A\nlot of the people that we work with, some of it\u2019s on-the-job training, some of it\u2019s\nworking directly with engineers that give us instructions, so it depends on who\nneeds help.\u201d When the prosecutor asked whether he had held any other jobs, K.K.\nsaid, \u201cNot since I\u2019ve completed school, but I\u2019ve been auto mechanic, house\npainter, whole bunch of different types of jobs I guess.\u201d\n       A third seated white juror, W.B., was a network technician for Huntington\nBeach High School District. When the prosecutor asked him to describe his job,\nW.B. said, \u201cIt means computer system, computer network administration,\ncomputer troubleshooting.\u201d When the prosecutor asked whether he supervised\nany employees, W.B. replied, \u201cNo. I do not.\u201d W.B. went on to say that five years\nearlier, he \u201cwas in electrical wholesale, in sales and office management, that type\nof thing.\u201d The prosecutor asked whether he supervised any employees while\nworking in office management, and W.B. said, \u201cYes. Warehouse-type people.\u201d\nThe prosecutor then asked, \u201cAnd what\u2019s the maximum number of employees you\nsupervised?\u201d W.B. replied, \u201cWe had two, three, just sometimes temporaries.\u201d\n       To the extent that the prosecutor looked for supervisory experience as a\nproxy for seasoned decisionmaking ability, a comparison of J.S. with L.F. is\n\n                                         12\n\f\u201cparticularly striking.\u201d (Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at p. 483.) As an administrative\nassistant handling worker\u2019s compensation and medical claims, L.F. served as a\n\u201cbuffer\u201d and a \u201cfacilitator.\u201d She facilitated the making and processing of claims,\nand she brought problems, information, and input to others responsible for making\ndecisions. But she said, \u201cI have no decision making in what I do . . . .\u201d In\naddition, K.K., while having more advanced education than J.S., likewise had no\nsupervisory role in his job as a lab technician. Further, W.B. had no supervisory\nrole in his job as a network technician. The only supervisory experience W.B.\nmentioned was a job in office management five years earlier, in which he\nsupervised two or three \u201c[w]arehouse-type people\u201d who were \u201csometimes\ntemporaries.\u201d In sum, nothing in the record indicates that J.S.\u2019s job as a telephone\ncircuit designer was less suggestive of seasoned decisionmaking ability than L.F.\u2019s\njob as an administrative assistant, K.K.\u2019s job as a lab technician, or W.B.\u2019s job as a\nnetwork technician or his prior job in office management. (See Miller-El, supra,\n545 U.S. at p. 241 [\u201cIf a prosecutor\u2019s proffered reason for striking a black panelist\napplies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack who is permitted to serve,\nthat is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination . . . .\u201d].)\n       Today\u2019s opinion speculates that \u201c[t]he prosecutor may have reasonably\nviewed Juror L.F. as someone with experience in making decisions in stressful\ncircumstances, and someone who would work well with other jurors as a team and\nreturn a verdict,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he prosecutor may have reasonably found that . . .\n[K.K.\u2019s] ability to receive and give instructions to solve problems on a continuing\nbasis demonstrated a strong ability to make decisions.\u201d (Maj. opn., ante, at\npp. 60\u201361.) But the record nowhere suggests that L.F. worked \u201cin stressful\ncircumstances.\u201d Moreover, why wouldn\u2019t it have been equally reasonable for the\nprosecutor to infer from J.S.\u2019s work experience that J.S., like K.K., was engaged in\nproblem solving on a continuing basis and, like L.F, would work well with others?\n\n                                          13\n\fJ.S. appeared to be a valued employee at Pacific Bell, having been promoted over\na 30-year career from a clerk position to training others on how to design\ntelephone circuits. From J.S.\u2019s job description, there was every reason for the\nprosecutor to infer that J.S. was experienced in problem solving and worked well\nwith others.\n       Indeed, the prosecutor\u2019s strike of J.S. after having accepted L.F., K.K., and\nW.B. appears even more suspicious in light of the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of\nJ.S.\u2019s job. The prosecutor described J.S. as \u201ca data entry specialist\u201d who \u201cmakes\nno decisions\u201d and \u201cis given specifications and . . . inputs that information into a\ncomputer. She is basically a more sophisticated form of a filing clerk. And\nbasically, she\u2019s held nothing but clerk positions.\u201d This minimization of J.S.\u2019s\nwork history is unsupported by the record. J.S. worked as a clerk while she was in\nschool and began working as a clerk for Pacific Bell, but eventually moved up to\nher current role. Regarding the process of designing circuits, J.S. said, \u201cWe get an\norder, and then we have to put together the circuit, where it\u2019s going from and\nwhere it ends up at.\u201d J.S. never mentioned data entry, and the prosecutor did not\nask whether J.S.\u2019s job involved decisionmaking, problem solving, or technical\nexpertise. As with L.F., K.K., and W.B., the prosecutor did not ask J.S. whether\nher job involved stressful situations. When defense counsel noted that the\nprosecutor\u2019s characterization of J.S.\u2019s work experience was unsupported by J.S.\u2019s\ntestimony, the trial court did not address the discrepancy. The court observed that\nJ.S.\u2019s \u201cposition in the Department of Justice was filing\u201d but did not consider J.S.\u2019s\njob as a circuit designer who trained others at Pacific Bell, a position she had held\nfor 20 years.\n       As noted, the prosecutor gave a second reason in explaining her strike of\nJ.S.: \u201c. . . I want to add that it\u2019s not just supervisory positions that I look for. I\nlook for how they handled stressful situations or incidences in their life.\u201d But this\n\n                                           14\n\freason does not dispel the inference of discrimination because, as defense counsel\nobjected at trial and as the record makes clear, J.S. was never asked about stressful\nsituations in her life. The trial court said, \u201cI don\u2019t recall that specific question.\nBut there were questions about her life.\u201d The only questions asked about J.S.\u2019s\nlife, apart from her work history, concerned the makeup of her family and what\nactivities she engaged in on a regular basis, to which J.S. said, \u201cI take my son, my\n12-year-old son, back and forth to basketball practice and his games and \u2014 [\u00b6]\n. . . . [\u00b6] . . . . I don\u2019t have time to do anything else.\u201d Defense counsel asked the\ntrial court to reopen voir dire specifically to examine whether J.S. had dealt with\nstressful situations in her life. But the prosecutor objected, and the trial court\ndenied the request. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s second reason could not have\ndistinguished L.F., K.K., or W.B. from J.S. because nothing in the record\naddressed whether or how those jurors had dealt with stressful situations in their\nlives.\n         To sum up: The prosecutor struck J.S., a black woman, in selecting the jury\nfor a capital penalty trial involving a black man convicted of murdering a white\nvictim. It is undisputed that the first penalty-phase jury hung with two black\nwomen as holdouts against a death verdict. Based on J.S.\u2019s work experience, the\nprosecutor said J.S. was not a \u201cseasoned decision maker[]\u201d who \u201ccould handle the\nstress of a tough decision.\u201d But J.S.\u2019s work experience does not appear\nmeaningfully different, as a proxy for decisionmaking ability, from the work\nexperience of three seated white jurors, including an administrative assistant who\nsaid, \u201cI have no decision making in what I do . . . .\u201d Further, although the\nprosecutor said she also \u201clook[s] for how they handled stressful situations or\nincidences in their life,\u201d this additional reason could not have explained the strike\nof J.S. because J.S. was never asked about stressful situations in her life.\nConsidering the totality of relevant circumstances, I find it more likely than not\n\n                                           15\n\fthat the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for striking J.S. were pretextual. \u201cThe prosecution\u2019s\nproffer of th[ese] pretextual explanation[s] naturally gives rise to an inference of\ndiscriminatory intent.\u201d (Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at p. 485.)\n                                          III.\n       In reaching a contrary conclusion, today\u2019s opinion reveals several dubious\naspects of our Batson jurisprudence.\n       First, the court\u2019s examination of defendant\u2019s Batson claim, including its\ncursory comparative juror analysis, accords deference to the trial court\u2019s ruling.\n(Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 52, 57\u201359.) But nothing in the record indicates that the\ntrial court, in making its ruling, compared J.S. to white jurors whom the prosecutor\ndid not strike. The trial court also did not examine discrepancies between J.S.\u2019s\ntestimony and the prosecutor\u2019s account of J.S.\u2019s job. Nor did the trial court reopen\nvoir dire in light of the prosecutor\u2019s claim that J.S. had not dealt with stressful\nsituations in her life, even though the court acknowledged that J.S. had not been\nasked that question. Although deference is appropriate when the trial court has\nmade \u201c \u2018a sincere and reasoned effort to evaluate\u2019 \u201d all relevant circumstances\nbearing on a Batson claim (People v. Lenix (2008) 44 Cal. 4th 602, 614 (Lenix)), it\nis unclear what exactly this court is deferring to here. (See People v. Mai (2013)\n57 Cal. 4th 986, 1062 (conc. opn. of Liu, J.).) On this record, the case for\ndeference is especially weak because the prosecutor did not rely on J.S.\u2019s\ndemeanor or other intangible qualities apparent only to the trial court. This court,\nno less than the trial court, is capable of evaluating the prosecutor\u2019s claims as to\ndecisionmaking ability, as demonstrated by each juror\u2019s employment or life\nexperience.\n       Second, the court casts doubt on the utility of comparative juror analysis\nwhen conducted for the first time on appeal because \u201ca party legitimately may\nchallenge one prospective juror but not another to whom the same particular\n\n                                          16\n\fconcern applies. [Citation.] \u2018Two panelists might give a similar answer on a\ngiven point. Yet the risk posed by one panelist might be offset by other answers,\nbehavior, attitudes or experiences that make one juror, on balance, more or less\ndesirable. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 59.) Whatever the merits of this\nconcern (cf. Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 247, fn. 6 [rejecting \u201ca rule that no\ncomparison is probative unless the situation of the individuals compared is\nidentical in all respects\u201d]), it has no applicability here. That is because the\nprosecutor emphasized that the capital sentencing process, in her view, \u201crequires\nindividuals who are seasoned decision makers.\u201d (Italics added.) In other words,\nthe prosecutor\u2019s reason for striking J.S. was a necessary quality she purportedly\nsought in any seated juror, whatever other qualities a juror might have. A\ncomparative analysis that focuses specifically on this quality is thus probative of\npurposeful discrimination. (The court does not posit other qualities that\ndistinguish L.F., K.K., or W.B. from J.S. in any event.) Moreover, the utility of\nsuch analysis does not require a large number of comparison jurors. In Snyder, the\nhigh court found it highly probative to compare a black juror struck by the\nprosecutor to just two seated white jurors. (Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at pp. 483\u2013\n484.) Here, as in Snyder, comparative juror analysis gives rise to a strong\ninference of discriminatory intent, even on a deferential standard of review. (Id. at\np. 485; see Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 241 [finding comparative juror analysis\n\u201c[m]ore powerful\u201d than the fact that the prosecution struck 10 out of 11 black\nvenirepersons].)\n       Third, the court says \u201c[t]he basis for a challenge may range from \u2018the\nvirtually certain to the highly speculative\u2019 [citation] and \u2018even a \u201ctrivial\u201d reason, if\ngenuine and neutral, will suffice.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 54\u201355.)\nBut Snyder identified the \u201chighly speculative\u201d nature of the prosecutor\u2019s stated\nreason as an indication of implausibility, giving rise to an inference of\n\n                                          17\n\fdiscriminatory intent. (Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at p. 482.) Further, the court says\nthe Batson inquiry focuses \u201c \u2018on the subjective genuineness of the race-neutral\nreasons given for the peremptory challenge, not on the objective reasonableness of\nthose reasons.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 55\u201356.) But we have also recognized\nthat the prosecutor\u2019s credibility can be measured by, among other factors, \u201c \u2018how\nreasonable, or how improbable, the explanations are.\u2019 \u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th\nat p. 613, quoting Miller\u2013El v. Cockrell (2003) 537 U.S. 322, 339.) Quite often, as\nin this case, an objective analysis of the reasonableness of the prosecutor\u2019s\nexplanation in light of the relevant circumstances in the record is the only basis for\nmeaningful review of a Batson ruling.\n       Finally, today\u2019s opinion makes new law that improperly limits comparative\njuror analysis. In this appeal, defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s stated\nreasons for striking two black jurors are undermined by a comparison of those\njurors not only to nonblack jurors already seated at the time the trial court ruled on\nthe strikes, but also to nonblack jurors seated after the trial court\u2019s rulings. The\ncourt holds that \u201cif defendant believed the trial court should have considered any\npost-ruling developments, he could have, and should have, renewed his\nBatson/Wheeler claim. Because defendant did not, his reliance on the responses of\nthe above jurors that were provided after the trial court denied his second motion\nis forfeited.\u201d (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 59.) This rule, the court says, follows from\nour statement in Lenix that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s finding is reviewed on the record as it\nstands at the time the Wheeler/Batson ruling is made. If the defendant believes\nthat subsequent events should be considered by the trial court, a renewed objection\nis required to permit appellate consideration of these subsequent developments.\u201d\n(Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 624.)\n       But this statement in Lenix was dictum because Lenix involved no issue of\n\u201csubsequent developments\u201d urged for appellate consideration. The forfeiture rule\n\n                                          18\n\fannounced today is in substantial tension with Lenix\u2019s key holding with regard to\nconsideration of comparative juror analysis when it is urged for the first time on\nappeal. In light of the obvious importance that Snyder and Miller-El assigned to\ncomparative juror analysis, Lenix said that those cases \u201cstand for the proposition\nthat, as to claims of error at Wheeler/Batson\u2019s third stage, our former practice of\ndeclining to engage in comparative juror analysis for the first time on appeal\nunduly restricts review based on the entire record. As the high court noted in\nSnyder, \u2018In Miller-El v. Dretke, the Court made it clear that in considering a\nBatson objection, or in reviewing a ruling claimed to be Batson error, all of the\ncircumstances that bear upon the issue of racial animosity must be consulted.\u2019\n(Snyder, [supra, 552 U.S.] at p. 478, italics added.) Thus, evidence of\ncomparative juror analysis must be considered in the trial court and even for the\nfirst time on appeal if relied upon by the defendant and the record is adequate to\npermit the urged comparisons.\u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 622, fn. omitted.)\n       Lenix thus holds that in reviewing a Batson ruling, an appellate court is not\nprecluded from considering, and indeed must consider, grounds that the defendant\ndid not bring to the trial court\u2019s attention. The essential premise of this holding is\nthat appellate review of a Batson ruling is not merely an exercise in evaluating the\ntrial court\u2019s performance based on arguments put forth by the parties. Instead, as\nLenix said, Snyder and Miller-El require appellate courts to consider all relevant\ncircumstances \u2014 to engage in \u201creview based on the entire record\u201d \u2014 in\ndetermining whether the strike of a particular juror was improperly motivated.\n(Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 622.) If jurors seated before a trial court\u2019s ruling,\nbut never brought to the court\u2019s attention, must be considered in comparative juror\nanalysis, then there is no reason why jurors seated after a trial court\u2019s ruling may\nbe considered only if the defendant makes a renewed objection. Any juror\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\faccepted by the prosecutor is a potentially relevant basis for comparison in\ndetermining whether a particular strike was discriminatory.\n       Although I agree that comparing the struck jurors to jurors seated after the\ntrial court\u2019s ruling does not aid the Batson claim in this case (maj. opn., ante, at\npp. 61\u201363), this is not always so. In People v. Manibusan (2013) 58 Cal. 4th 40,\nthe prosecution exercised its first peremptory strike against a black female juror\nwhose only prior service on a jury had resulted in a hung jury. Among the reasons\noffered for the strike, the prosecutor said, \u201cI have an absolute policy of getting rid\nof people whose only jury experience resulted in a hung jury.\u201d (Id. at p. 108\n(conc. opn. of Liu, J.).) But after the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s Batson\nmotion, the prosecutor repeatedly accepted two jurors whose sole experience on a\njury had resulted in a hung jury. \u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s \u2018absolute policy,\u2019 it turns out,\nwas not absolute at all.\u201d (Ibid.) Today\u2019s decision requires us to ignore such\nobviously relevant circumstances in evaluating a Batson claim.\n       As a practical matter, the court has put the bar on notice that any reasonably\ncompetent defense attorney must reassert all Batson challenges at the end of jury\nselection, even though counsel need not bring any comparative juror analysis to\nthe trial court\u2019s attention in order to preserve the entire record for appeal. (See\nLenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 622 [\u201cevidence of comparative juror analysis must\nbe considered . . . even for the first time on appeal if relied upon by the defendant\nand the record is adequate to permit the urged comparisons\u201d].) The peculiarity of\nthis result should be a tip-off that something is amiss. Under Snyder, Miller-El,\nand Lenix, our duty to consider all relevant circumstances in evaluating a Batson\nclaim does not depend on counsel\u2019s compliance with such an empty exercise.\n\n                                          IV.\n       Today\u2019s decision extends this court\u2019s extraordinary track record of denying\nBatson claims. (See People v. Harris (2013) 57 Cal. 4th 804, 885, 892\u2013898 (conc.\n\n                                          20\n\fopn. of Liu, J.) [documenting this court\u2019s rejection of Batson claims in 101 out of\n102 cases presenting the issue over the past two decades, with People v. Silva\n(2001) 25 Cal. 4th 345 (Silva) as the sole exception].) Our Batson jurisprudence\n\u2014 especially its reflexive deference to trial court rulings and its refusal to infer\ndiscrimination from disparate treatment of similarly situated jurors \u2014 leaves one\nto wonder whether any circumstances, short of an outright admission by the\nprosecutor (see Silva, at p. 375), will ever suffice to prove a violation.\n       Prospective Juror J.S. was a mother of three who advanced over a 30-year\ncareer into a technical job in which she trained others. She had twice served on a\njury that reached a verdict. She repeatedly said she would consider the evidence,\nwould speak her mind and listen to others, and would be willing to vote for the\ndeath penalty in an appropriate case. J.S. appeared to be a well-qualified juror, no\nless qualified than several white jurors whom the prosecutor accepted. In this\npenalty retrial of a black man convicted of murdering a white victim, in which it is\nundisputed that the first penalty-phase jury hung with two black women refusing\nto vote for death, the prosecutor\u2019s strike of J.S. was not credibly explained by the\nreasons the prosecutor gave. Under the laws of this state, defendant may well\ndeserve the death penalty in the eyes of a reasonable jury. But the jury must be\none selected free of improper discrimination.\n       I join the portion of the court\u2019s opinion affirming defendant\u2019s convictions.\nBut I respectfully dissent from the court\u2019s affirmance of the penalty verdict.\n                                                   LIU, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fSee next page for addresses and telephone numbers for counsel who argued in Supreme Court.\n\nName of Opinion People v.

            "opinion_text": "\nOpinion\nCHIN, J.\nA jury convicted defendant Calvin Dion Chism of the first degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a) (count one))1 and attempted robbery (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 664 (count two)) of Richard Moon, and the second degree robbery of Jung Ja Chung (\u00a7 211 (count three)).2 The jury found true the special circumstance allegation that the murder was committed during the attempted commission of a robbery (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(A)). It also found true allegations that a principal in counts one and two was armed with a firearm (former \u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1)), and that defendant personally used a firearm in the commission of all three counts (former \u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)(1); see now \u00a7 12022.5 subd. (a)). The trial court found true the allegation that defendant had suffered one prior serious or violent juvenile adjudication within the meaning of the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)).\nThe jury was unable to reach a penalty verdict, and the trial court declared a mistrial. Another jury was impaneled. After a retrial of the penalty phase trial, the second jury returned a verdict of death as to count one.\n*1279The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for new trial (\u00a7 1181) and his motion to modify the penalty verdict (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e)). With regard to count one, the trial court sentenced defendant to death plus a consecutive upper term of 10 years for the personal use of a firearm enhancement. The court sentenced defendant to an upper term of six years on count two, plus a consecutive term of five years for the personal use of a firearm enhancement, but the court stayed this 11-year sentence pursuant to section 654. The court then imposed a consecutive upper term of five years on count three, doubled to 10 years under the Three Strikes law, plus a 10-year consecutive sentence for the personal use of a firearm enhancement. Defendant was awarded 643 days of presentence custody credits. This appeal is automatic.\nWe conclude defendant is entitled to 96 days of conduct credit (\u00a7 2933.1, subd. (c)), and order the clerk of the superior court to modify the abstract of judgment to reflect those 96 days of conduct credit. The judgment, including the death sentence, is otherwise affirmed.\nI. Facts\nA. Guilt Phase\n1. Prosecution Evidence\na. Riteway Robbery\nOn May 18, 1997, defendant entered the Riteway Market (Riteway or market) in Compton alone and asked the lone clerk, Jung Ja Chung, for hair gel. Chung said she did not have any, and defendant left. Defendant quickly returned with codefendant Johnson and three accomplices. One accomplice approached Chung, pointed his gun at her, and demanded money. Defendant went behind the counter and told Chung to open the cash register. Defendant took cash from the register and a nine-millimeter Clock handgun (the Clock) that the owner kept under the counter. The other robbers took various items. Defendant pointed the Clock at Chung as he followed his accomplices out of the store.\nAt trial, defendant\u2019s California Youth Authority (CYA) parole officer, Kenneth Lipkin, viewed the Riteway surveillance videotape of the robbery and recognized defendant as the person who first entered the market and later pointed the Clock at Chung as he left. Lipkin recognized defendant\u2019s voice on the tape saying, \u201cWe\u2019re in the house. They don\u2019t have a video,\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a Clock,\u201d and \u201c187.\u201d Lipkin noted that defendant\u2019s \u201c187\u201d comment was a reference to the Penal Code section that defines murder.\n*1280b. Eddie\u2019s Liquor Store\n(1) The Murder and Attempted Robbery\nOn June 12, 1997,3 Edward Snow owned Eddie\u2019s Liquor (Eddie\u2019s or liquor store), which was located at the intersection of East Artesia Boulevard and Butler Avenue in Long Beach. Richard Moon was employed at Eddie\u2019s as a clerk.\nCodefendant Johnson\u2019s sister Marcia4 was acquainted with defendant and Taylor.5 Around 9:00 a.m. on June 12, defendant, Johnson, Taylor, and Marcia met at Marcia\u2019s home in Compton. Defendant wore black jeans and a black T-shirt with the word \u201cAir\u201d and a white Nike logo printed across the front (Nike Air T-shirt). Defendant had a Clock handgun in his waistband, the same gun Marcia had seen him carrying \u201call the time\u201d during the previous month. Defendant told them about his plan to rob Eddie\u2019s and assigned each person a task. He instructed Marcia to enter Eddie\u2019s to determine the location of any surveillance video cameras and the number of clerks. Defendant appointed Taylor to be the driver, and directed Johnson to go into the store with defendant. No one objected to defendant\u2019s plan.\nApproximately 15 minutes later, the group left Marcia\u2019s house in a light gray Plymouth Voyager van Taylor had borrowed from his girlfriend, Zonita Wallace.6 Defendant had the Clock tucked in his waistband when he entered the van. Around 2:00 p.m., Taylor parked a couple of blocks away from Eddie\u2019s. Marcia exited, walked to the liquor store and went inside. She saw a camera, and she saw a clerk standing behind the counter. Marcia purchased candy, returned to the van, and told defendant what she had seen. Defendant and Johnson then walked towards the liquor store. According to Marcia, defendant had \u201ca bulge in his waistband.\u201d Within a minute or two, there were one or two gunshots, and defendant and Johnson then ran from the liquor store to the van. Taylor drove the group to a house in Long Beach to meet Iris Johnston. The drive took 20 to 30 minutes. The group stayed at the house for about 10 minutes. They then left with Johnston and a friend and drove to defendant\u2019s residence.\n*1281Steven Miller had been sitting on a bus bench across the street from Eddie\u2019s on June 12 when he saw two African-American men enter the liquor store.7 Shortly thereafter, Miller heard a popping sound he thought was a gunshot. He then saw the same men run from the store. They ran north on Butler Avenue approximately two blocks and turned right onto East Marker Lane. Miller immediately ran into Eddie\u2019s and saw Moon under the counter on his back, unconscious and bleeding. Miller telephoned the police. He described the two African-American males as 17 to 18 years old, five feet seven or eight inches tall, with short \u201cAfro style\u201d hair and \u201cthin builds.\u201d Miller added that one wore dark jeans and a black shirt with white stripes on the front.\nStephanie Johnson heard gunshots as she drove near the intersection of Artesia Boulevard and Butler Avenue between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m. on June 12. She then saw two men running from the direction of the liquor store. One was dark skinned, slim, and of medium height. He was wearing dark khaki pants and a black shirt with a white shirt underneath, and his hair was curly on top and shaved around the bottom. Stephanie could not describe the second person or recall his clothing.\nDuring the afternoon of June 12, Peter Motta was driving on East Marker Lane when he saw a light-colored Plymouth Voyager (the same make and model as Wallace\u2019s) parked near the intersection of East Marker Lane and Butler Avenue. Two African-Americans were inside, one in the driver\u2019s seat, the other in the passenger seat. Two men ran very fast from Butler Avenue towards the van and then \u201cdisappear[ed].\u201d Motta noticed one was African-American, thin, and slightly taller than average.\n(2) Events Immediately Following the Crimes at Eddie\u2019s\nLong Beach Police Officers Rudy Romero and Stacey Holdredge arrived at Eddie\u2019s at 2:08 p.m. While Romero spoke with Miller outside, Holdredge went inside and found Moon lying on tire floor behind the counter, bleeding and unconscious. Moon died before the paramedics arrived.\nIris Johnston was acquainted with defendant, Johnson, Taylor, and Marcia. The group met Johnston at the Long Beach home of one of her friends between 1:00 and 1:30 p.m. the day Moon was killed. Johnston testified they arrived in a van similar in make and model to Wallace\u2019s van. After about 10 minutes, Johnston and the group left in that van and drove to defendant\u2019s *1282residence. Along the way, Johnston saw helicopters overhead and asked what happened. Someone said, \u201cThere must have been a robbery.\u201d Defendant said \u201cI\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d \u201cknow [who] did it.\u201d Inside defendant\u2019s residence, they watched the news on television. They then walked to a store. Defendant appeared nervous when they saw a police car. Later, while defendant, Marcia, and Johnston were on a three-way telephone call, defendant told Johnston he wanted to talk privately with Marcia. That evening, Johnston wrote and hand delivered a letter to defendant in which she accused him and the others of having committed \u201cthat little robbery in Long Beach.\u201d\n(3) Investigation\nPolice recovered a bullet from the liquor store floor near Moon\u2019s hip and a spent nine-millimeter cartridge casing on the floor near the liquor shelves. There was an indentation in the ice cream machine in the store, which was consistent with the type of mark caused by a bullet ricocheting off a hard item. The owner of Eddie\u2019s testified there was no indentation on the ice cream machine prior to June 12, and nothing was missing from the cash register. Police retrieved a videotape from a videocassette recorder (VCR) inside the liquor store (videotape or liquor store videotape or surveillance videotape).\nLos Angeles County deputy medical examiner Stephen Scholtz performed an autopsy on Moon\u2019s body and determined the cause of death was a gunshot to Moon\u2019s back. The bullet had exited through Moon\u2019s chest. Moon\u2019s right knee was scuffed and his scalp was bruised. Scholtz examined Moon\u2019s shirt visually and microscopically but observed no gunshot residue or soot. Scholtz examined Moon\u2019s entire body but found no stippling, which is the marking of skin by powdered particles discharged from a firearm.\n(4) Search of Defendant\u2019s Residence\nOn June 19, one week after Moon was murdered, defendant\u2019s parole officer and Compton police searched defendant\u2019s residence. They found a loaded Clock handgun on his bedroom closet shelf, a black T-shirt with \u201cAir\u201d and a white Nike symbol printed across the front, and a letter Johnston had written to defendant dated June 12. Defendant was arrested the same day.\n(5) Search of Iris Johnston\u2019s Residence\nOn August 20, police searched Johnston\u2019s home and recovered a letter defendant had written to her that was postmarked August 11.\n*1283(6) Firearms Evidence\nRiteway\u2019s owner identified the loaded Clock handgun found in defendant\u2019s bedroom closet as the gun that had been kept under the counter at Riteway. He testified that the Clock had been under the counter on the day of the Riteway robbery.\nRobert Hawkins, a Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department crime laboratory firearm examiner, examined and test fired the Clock, and he examined the bullet and cartridge casing recovered from the floor at Eddie\u2019s. Hawkins testified the bullet could have been fired from the Clock, but he could not be certain because there were not enough markings on it. Based on markings on the cartridge casing, Hawkins concluded the casing had been fired from the Clock. Hawkins examined photographs taken of Eddie\u2019s ice cream machine, and concluded the indentation on its outer metal surface could have been caused by a bullet strike. Hawkins used a chemical process on Moon\u2019s shirt that revealed two gunpowder particles, each of which was within three and a half inches of the center of the entry hole on the back of the shirt. Based on those measurements, Hawkins concluded the gun was approximately four to five feet from Moon when it was fired.\n(7) Physical Appearance of Defendant and Johnson\nDefendant, an African-American, was five feet nine inches tall and weighed 152 pounds. Johnson, an African-American, was six feet tall and weighed 150 pounds.\n2. Defense Evidence\nDefense investigator Daniel Mendoza testified that there was a doorway but no door between defendant\u2019s bedroom and an adjacent spare bedroom that could be accessed through the back door of the house.\nMichael Cayton, a Long Beach Harbor Patrol officer, testified as a witness for Johnson. Between 12:00 and 3:00 p.m. on June 12, Cayton was off duty and driving near Eddie\u2019s when he noticed three \u201csuspicious\u201d men standing near a parking lot. Cayton noticed the men were dark skinned, in their early 20\u2019s, and between five feet nine inches and six feet one inch in height. One walked toward Eddie\u2019s, one followed, and one stayed outside looking around. Two of the men entered the liquor store. Cayton could not identify or exclude defendant, Johnson, or Taylor as any of the three men he saw that day.\n*1284B. Penalty Phase\n1. Prosecution Evidence\nAt the penalty phase retrial before a new jury, the prosecutor presented evidence similar to that presented during the guilt phase, evidence of prior crimes committed by defendant, and victim impact testimony.\nOn December 9, 1993, Cheryl Quadrelli-Jones, an assistant principal at Anaheim\u2019s Gilbert West High School, saw defendant leave the school and cross the street towards a pedestrian passthrough that led to a nearby neighborhood. Approximately 100 feet from defendant, a male appeared from another passthrough. Defendant extended his arm and fired a gun at that individual. As Quadrelli-Jones yelled to students to get down, defendant and the male he had shot at left the area.\nOn January 31, 1994, defendant and two male companions approached Bradley Turner in a parking lot at Cypress\u2019s Arnold Park. Defendant held a gun to Turner\u2019s head. One companion demanded Turner\u2019s wallet and then searched for it in Turner\u2019s car. Not finding the wallet, he said to the others, \u201cJust kill the motherfucker right now.\u201d Defendant and Turner then struggled, and defendant shot Turner in the leg. Rhonda Griffin, who was nearby, saw defendant fleeing and tried to chase him. She was within an arm\u2019s length of defendant when he pressed a gun against her temple and said, \u201cDo you want some of this, you fucking bitch?\u201d A car filled with several other people drove up, and defendant jumped in. Defendant was subsequently arrested. On July 25, 1994, defendant admitted allegations in a juvenile petition that he committed the attempted second degree robbery of Turner and assaulted Turner with a semiautomatic firearm.\nThe victim impact evidence included testimony from family members and friends regarding victim Moon\u2019s personality, his joy of life, and the effect his death had on those close to him. It also included a photo board with several photographs of Moon with members of his family. We provide a detailed summary of this testimony and physical evidence in conjunction with our discussion of defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by admitting much of the victim impact testimony.\n2. Defense Evidence\nDefendant\u2019s mother and father were 13 and 15 years old, respectively, when defendant was bom. Defendant\u2019s mother had six children with five different men. She was a drug abuser, and she lost custody of defendant when he was seven years old. Until then, defendant had been a \u201chappy\u201d child.\n*1285Defendant then lived with his paternal grandmother. When defendant was 10 years old, his father was killed, and defendant had to identify the body. After that, defendant began having behavioral problems. His paternal grandmother gave custody of defendant to his maternal grandmother, who took defendant to therapy sessions at a church once a week for about a year. Defendant graduated from high school in 1996 during his CYA commitment.\nArthur Gray, a senior pastor at Abundant Joy Christian Fellowship in Inglewood, knew defendant in his early childhood. Defendant had attended church and participated in many church activities, including the choir. Defendant was always pleasant, courteous, and friendly.\nChaplain Robert Curry met defendant at the Paso Robles CYA facility in about 1995. Defendant always was willing to work, even without compensation. He sang in the choir, preached, acted as a peer counselor, and inspired others. Defendant helped to reduce racial tensions within his unit.\nDeandre Brown testified that, while defendant was a ward at the Paso Robles CYA, he inspired Brown to believe in God and in himself. Defendant encouraged Brown to attend high school classes.\nLorraine Wahlberb, a volunteer at the Paso Robles CYA, met defendant in 1996. She was involved in many activities with defendant. He spoke during church services and participated in church activities. Defendant often preached at classes offered at the institution and positively influenced others.\nIn 1997, Lawrence Mills met defendant while teaching him at the Chino CYA. In 1998, defendant was returned to CYA upon violation of his parole for his involvement in the instant crimes. Mills testified that defendant earned a training certificate in operating a forklift and another certificate in warehousing.\nDefendant testified about his mother losing custody of him, his father\u2019s death, and having to identify his father\u2019s body. He added that, while living with his paternal grandmother, he twice was sexually assaulted by a neighbor, whom he did not identify. At age 11, defendant started to use drugs and alcohol. Later, he became interested in religion. While at various CYA facilities, defendant became religious and experienced a spiritual awakening.\nDefendant denied any involvement in the instant crimes. He said his grandmothers had taught him the difference between right and wrong, and he told the jury, \u201cA lot of the crimes and stuff, I\u2019m pretty much guilty of . . . , a murderer, I\u2019m not. I value the human life too much for me to kill a man over a dollar.\u201d Addressing the victim\u2019s wife, defendant said \u201cevery time I see you, *1286hearing the spark that your daughter said that you had in your eyes, I got to go to . . . my cell, every night and think about how your life was before Mr. Moon died. And if I was to say anything, it wouldn\u2019t be sorry. It would be I wish I could change the hands of time. I wish I could bring him back. But I can\u2019t.\u201d\nII. Discussion\nA. Jury Selection Issues\n1. Group Death-qualification Voir Dire\nDefendant contends the trial court erred in failing to conduct the death-qualifying portion of voir dire of potential jurors individually and in sequestration as required by Hovey v. Superior Court (1980) 28 Cal.3d 1 [168 Cal.Rptr. 128, 616 P.2d 1301]. He asserts violations of his federal constitutional rights to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, to a trial by an impartial jury under the Sixth Amendment, and to reliable guilt and penalty verdicts under the Eighth Amendment.\nWe have noted that Hovey held \u201cprospective jurors in capital cases should be sequestered and questioned individually regarding their views on the death penalty. In 1990, the voters adopted Proposition 115, which as relevant here, abrogated Hovey by adding to the Code of Civil Procedure a provision stating that \u2018where practicable, [voir dire shall] occur in the presence of the other [prospective] jurors in all criminal cases, including death penalty cases.\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 223.)\u201d (People v. Tafoya (2007) 42 Cal.4th 147, 167 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 163, 164 P.3d 590].) We have consistently held individual voir dire is not constitutionally required following passage of Proposition 115. (See, e.g., People v. Thomas (2012) 53 Cal.4th 771, 789 [137 Cal.Rptr.3d 533, 269 P.3d 1109]; People v. Brasure (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1037, 1050-1051 [71 Cal.Rptr.3d 675, 175 P.3d 632].) We decline defendant\u2019s request to reconsider our prior holdings.\n2. Constitutionality of Death-qualification Voir Dire\nDefendant contends his death judgment must be reversed because the death-qualification portion of jury selection is unconstitutional. The high court and this court have rejected this contention. (Lockhart v. McCree (1986) 476 U.S. 162, 176-177 [90 L.Ed.2d 137, 106 S.Ct. 1758]; People v. Lenart (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1107, 1120 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 592, 88 P.3d 498].) Defendant offers no persuasive reason to reconsider the issue as to our state Constitution, and we decline to do so.\n*1287B. Guilt Phase Issues\n1. Steven Miller\u2019s Statements\nDefendant contends the trial court erred in admitting the portion of Officer Romero\u2019s testimony that related the statements Steven Miller made outside of Eddie\u2019s shortly after the murder. Defendant claims admission of Miller\u2019s statements violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.\na. Factual and Procedural Background\nOver a defense hearsay objection, Officer Romero testified as follows regarding his encounter with Miller outside Eddie\u2019s.\nOfficer Romero arrived at Eddie\u2019s within seven minutes of the 911 radio broadcast. Miller was the first person he contacted. Miller appeared to be \u201cvery nervous,\u201d \u201cunsettled,\u201d and \u201cvery uneasy and shaken up\u201d throughout the encounter. Miller said, \u201cI think he\u2019s dead.\u201d Miller told Officer Romero the following. Miller had been sitting on a bus bench across the street from the liquor store when he saw two African-American males go inside. Shortly afterward, Miller heard a popping sound he recognized as a gunshot. Miller then saw the same men run from Eddie\u2019s, head north on Butler Avenue, and turn right onto East Marker Lane. Miller immediately ran into Eddie\u2019s, looked behind the counter, and saw the clerk on his back, unconscious and bleeding. Miller called the police. In addition, Miller told Officer Romero both males appeared to be 17 or 18 years old, five feet seven or eight inches tall, with short \u201cAfro style\u201d hair and \u201cthin builds.\u201d One wore dark jeans and a black shirt with white stripes on the front. The second wore long dark shorts.\nRomero radioed for police assistance. Meanwhile, Officer Holdredge, Romero\u2019s partner, had entered Eddie\u2019s to check on the clerk. After finding him on the floor, Holdredge called for paramedics and additional police assistance.\nBefore the prosecution called Miller to the stand, counsel for Miller informed the court that Miller was in custody awaiting trial in an unrelated Three Strikes case and that Miller intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if called to testify. During a hearing on the matter, the parties indicated they were unaware of any information that would suggest Miller would incriminate himself if he testified in this case. Based on representations by counsel that they would not try to impeach Miller based on his prior criminal record, the trial court ruled Miller did not have a right to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege, and advised Miller of this ruling. *1288However, when the prosecution called Miller as a witness, Miller refused to answer any questions. The court found Miller in contempt and unavailable to testify.\nb. Discussion\nEvidence Code section 1200, subdivision (a), provides that \u201c \u2018[hearsay evidence\u2019 is evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness while testifying at the hearing and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter stated.\u201d Hearsay evidence is not admissible \u201c[e]xcept as provided by law.\u201d (Id., subd. (b).) Miller\u2019s statements were hearsay because they were made out of court and were offered for the truth of what he had told Officer Romero. Evidence Code section 1240 provides that \u201c[e]vidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement: [][] (a) Purports to narrate, describe, or explain an act, condition, or event perceived by the declarant; and [][] (b) Was made spontaneously while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by such perception.\u201d Defendant concedes Miller\u2019s statements qualified for admission under this exception to the hearsay rule, but relying on the high court\u2019s decision in Crawford v. Washington (2004) 541 U.S. 36, 68 [158 L.Ed.2d 177, 124 S.Ct. 1354] (Crawford), he contends the statements were not admissible under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.\nCrawford held the confrontation clause \u201cprohibits \u2018admission of testimonial statements of . . . witness [es] who did not appear at trial unless [the witness] was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u2019 (Crawford, [541 U.S.] at pp. 53-54, italics added.)\u201d (People v. Romero (2008) 44 Cal.4th 386, 421 [79 Cal.Rptr.3d 334, 187 P.3d 56] (Romero).)8 Thereafter, as we noted in Romero, in Davis v. Washington (2006) 547 U.S. 813 [165 L.Ed.2d 224, 126 S.Ct. 2266], the high court explained that \u201c \u2018[statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d (Romero, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 421.) After Crawford, the high court has emphasized that \u201c \u2018not all those *1289questioned by the police are witnesses\u2019 for purposes of the Sixth Amendment and not all 1 \u201cinterrogations by law enforcement officers\u201d [citation], are subject to the Confrontation Clause.\u2019 ([Michigan v.] Bryant [(2011) 562] U.S. _,_[179 L.Ed.2d 93, 131 S.Ct. [1143,] 1153], quoting Crawford, supra, 541 U.S. at p. 53.)\u201d (People v. Blacksher (2011) 52 Cal.4th 769, 811 [130 Cal.Rptr.3d 191, 259 P.3d 370] (Blacksher)).\nBased on the reasoning in Bryant, in Blacksher we identified six factors to consider in determining whether statements made in the course of police questioning were for the \u201c \u2018primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony\u2019 that implicates the confrontation clause.\u201d (Blacksher, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 813.) These are (1) an objective evaluation of the circumstances of the encounter and the statements and actions of the individuals involved in the encounter; (2) whether the statements were made during an ongoing emergency or under circumstances that reasonably appeared to present an emergency, or were obtained for purposes other than for use by the prosecution at trial; (3) whether any actual or perceived emergency presented an ongoing threat to first responders or the public; (4) the declarant\u2019s medical condition; (5) whether the focus of the interrogation had shifted from addressing an ongoing emergency to obtaining evidence for trial; and (6) the informality of the statement and the circumstances under which it was obtained. (Id. at pp. 814-815.)\nApplying Crawford to defendant\u2019s case, we conclude that Miller\u2019s statements to Officer Romero were nontestimonial and that their admission did not violate defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. Officer Romero was the first officer to arrive at the scene, and Miller was the first person he contacted. Miller appeared to be \u201cvery nervous\u201d and \u201cshaken up.\u201d The circumstances of the encounter, which took place outside a store where a shooting had recently occurred, reveal that Miller and Officer Romero spoke to each other in order to deal with an ongoing emergency. It was objectively reasonable for Officer Romero to believe the suspects, one of whom presumably was still armed with a gun, remained at large and posed an immediate threat to officers responding to the shooting and to the public. We are convinced that Miller\u2019s additional statements concerning his observations and descriptions of the suspects were made for the primary purpose of meeting an ongoing emergency and not to produce evidence for use at a later trial. (See Romero, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 422 [statements made by an agitated victim of an ax attack were provided to police for the purpose of addressing an emergency situation and determining whether the attacker remained at large and presented a threat to others].)\n*12902. Evidence That Wallace Was Fearful of Testifying\nDefendant contends the trial court erroneously admitted evidence that three years prior to trial, either Johnson or his cousin accused Zonita Wallace of talking with police, contending it was irrelevant. Defendant also claims the evidence was unduly prejudicial under Evidence Code section 352, because the jury could infer his consciousness of guilt based on evidence of his association with Johnson and Johnson\u2019s connection to the accusation.9\na. Factual and Procedural Background\nWallace testified she dated Taylor in 1996 and 1997 and was acquainted with defendant and Johnson. On the day Moon was murdered, Wallace owned a gray Plymouth Voyager van that had two front doors and one sliding side door. Wallace had loaned the van to Taylor in June 1997 but did not recall the date.\nWallace further testified that she drove her van with Compton Police Detective Catherine Chavers on June 19, after her interview with Sergeant Frederick Reynolds; she did not recall that she and Chavers drove to a gas station. Wallace denied that while at the gas station with Chavers, she met someone whom she identified as Johnson. She also denied that something occurred at the gas station that caused her to be afraid.\nOver a hearsay objection by Johnson\u2019s counsel, Sergeant Reynolds testified that during the June 19 interview, Wallace told him she had loaned Taylor the van the week before. Reynolds testified that after the interview, he drove to a gas station where he saw Chavers with Wallace, and that Wallace appeared to be frightened. Without explaining why, Wallace said she would not go to court because she was afraid. The trial court ruled Reynolds\u2019s testimony was admissible to explain Wallace\u2019s failure to recall driving with Chavers to the *1291gas station, to explain Wallace\u2019s denials that she had identified Johnson and had become frightened by something that occurred at the gas station, and to demonstrate Johnson\u2019s consciousness of guilt.\nThe prosecutor then made an offer of proof that Detective Chavers would testify she rode with Wallace to a gas station in Compton on June 19, that Wallace identified Johnson and his cousin Michael as the two males inside a vehicle parked at that location, that Wallace talked with the two males while Chavers waited in the van, that Chavers overheard one of the males accuse Wallace of having spoken with the police, and that Wallace denied the accusation but thereafter appeared to be \u201cfrightened.\u201d\nThe prosecutor argued evidence of the accusation was admissible to show Wallace was fearful of testifying and to demonstrate Johnson\u2019s consciousness of guilt. Counsel for Johnson argued that the evidence should be excluded because Wallace was not asked on direct examination whether she was afraid to testify. Also, the evidence assertedly was unduly prejudicial because there was no showing that Johnson made the accusation. Defendant\u2019s counsel did not join in these objections.\nThe trial court overruled Johnson\u2019s objections and admitted evidence of the accusation on the grounds asserted by the prosecutor. Thereafter, Detective Chavers testified consistent with the prosecution\u2019s offer of proof that Wallace identified Johnson and his cousin at the gas station, that one of the males said, \u201c[Wallace] had spoken to the police,\u201d and that Wallace then appeared to be frightened.\nb. Discussion\nPreliminarily, the People argue defendant forfeited this issue because he did not join in Johnson\u2019s objections. \u201cA litigant need not object, however, if doing so would be futile.\u201d (People v. Wilson (2008) 44 Cal.4th 758, 793 [80 Cal.Rptr.3d 211, 187 P.3d 1041].) Here, because defendant had no reasonable basis to present additional information that might have altered the trial court\u2019s ruling or to object that the ruling would have caused him unique prejudice, he could have reasonably believed making his own motion would have been futile. We consider this contention on its merits and find no error.\nWe review a trial court\u2019s rulings on the admission and exclusion of evidence for abuse of discretion. (People v. Guerra (2006) 37 Cal.4th 1067, 1113 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 118, 129 P.3d 321] (Guerra).) \u201cEvidence that a witness is afraid to testify or fears retaliation for testifying is relevant to the credibility of that witness and is therefore admissible.\u201d (People v. Burgener (2003) 29 Cal.4th 833, 869 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 747, 62 P.3d 1] (Burgener); see *1292generally Evid. Code, \u00a7 780.) Evidence of any explanation of the basis for such fear is likewise relevant to the jury\u2019s assessment of the witness\u2019s credibility and admissible for that nonhearsay purpose, but not for the truth of any matters asserted. (Burgener, at p. 869.)\nEvidence that Johnson or his companion accused Wallace of speaking with the police was relevant because the jury reasonably could infer that the accusation was made to persuade Wallace not to cooperate with police or testify at a trial involving the liquor store incident. The jury also reasonably could infer that the accusation frightened Wallace and affected her testimony. Here, where Wallace \u201cprofessed inability to remember her previous statements [and gave] equivocal responses to many of the prosecutor\u2019s questions, ... the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that evidence of her fear in testifying was relevant to the jury\u2019s assessment of her credibility.\u201d (People v. Valdez (2012) 55 Cal.4th 82, 137 [144 Cal.Rptr.3d 865, 281 P.3d 924].)\nDefendant\u2019s claim to the contrary, the accusation was admissible although it occurred more than three years before Wallace testified. Wallace\u2019s testimony was riddled with claimed memory failures and evasive and inconsistent responses, many of which related to events that occurred the day the accusation was made. Wallace\u2019s professed inability to remember her prior statements and her equivocal responses could be explained by her fear of retaliation for testifying and that fear could have reasonably originated from the accusation Detective Chavers overheard.\nWe conclude the accusation was admissible against defendant notwithstanding the lack of evidence linking the statement to him. \u201cFor such evidence to be admissible, there is no requirement to show threats against the witness were made by the defendant personally or the witness\u2019s fear of retaliation is \u2018directly linked\u2019 to the defendant.\u201d (Guerra, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 1142.) Because \u201c[i]t is not necessarily the source of the threat\u2014but its existence\u2014that is relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility\u201d (Burgener, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 870), the evidence similarly was not excludable on the ground that Chavers was unable to discern whether Johnson or his cousin made the accusation.\nCiting Evidence Code section 352, defendant next contends admission of evidence of the accusation to show Johnson\u2019s consciousness of guilt was unduly prejudicial to him because the testimony implied his consciousness of guilt, although no evidence connected him to the accusation. Defendant, however, did not object to the evidence on this specific ground at trial, did not join in Johnson\u2019s objection on this ground, and did not request a limiting instruction on the ground that the evidence was admissible as to Johnson but *1293not him. The issue is therefore forfeited. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 353, subd. (a) [an objection to the assertedly erroneous admission of evidence must be timely and specific], 355 [when evidence is admissible for one purpose and inadmissible for another, \u201cthe court upon request shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly\u201d].) Because such a specific objection could have prevented the asserted prejudice and nothing suggests it would have been futile for defendant to object on this specific ground in the trial court, this claim is forfeited on appeal. (People v. Duran (1976) 16 Cal.3d 282, 289 [127 Cal.Rptr. 618, 545 P.2d 1322]; People v. Wilson, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 793.)\nEven if this claim were preserved, it has no merit. Neither the evidence nor the prosecutor suggested the accusation was evidence of defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt. Defendant\u2019s speculation that the jury might have connected the evidence to him does not establish that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of the accusation.\n3. Marcia Johnson\u2019s Statements to Detective Edwards\nDefendant contends the trial court erroneously permitted Detective Paul Edwards to testify that during his interview with Marcia, Marcia said that the night before the murder, defendant had told her he had been to the liquor store before and saw only one clerk inside, an old man. This claim is without merit.\na. Factual and Procedural Background\nOn direct examination, Marcia testified that when she met with defendant, Johnson, and Taylor at her home the morning of the murder, defendant told the group about his plans to rob Eddie\u2019s. He said he wanted Marcia to go inside, look for cameras, and determine how many clerks were working. Defendant said Taylor would drive, and Johnson would enter the liquor store with defendant. Only defendant spoke, and no one objected. Marcia testified she had not been to the liquor store or heard of it before that morning.\nDuring cross-examination, defendant\u2019s counsel asked about specific discrepancies in Marcia\u2019s statements to Detective Edwards regarding the planning of the robbery. Marcia testified she initially told Edwards that she, Johnson and Taylor \u201cscoped out\u201d the liquor store on the morning of the crimes. Asked whether she had mentioned to Edwards that defendant was involved, Marcia admitted she did not include defendant in that version of the events. Counsel asked whether Edwards told Marcia he did not believe her, and had suggested the planning had occurred the night before. Marcia testified Edwards did so, and that she then told Edwards the group met the *1294night before but had not discussed a plan to rob the liquor store at that time. Counsel then asked whether she recalled telling Edwards that during the night meeting, defendant \u201ccame to me and told me that he needed me to do something and he needed me to go to the store and go buy, go check out and see how many people [were] in there and to buy something. He said he needed the money. He was going to rob a liquor store.\u201d Marcia then testified she recalled telling Edwards this, but testified the conversation did not relate to any plans to rob Eddie\u2019s.\nThereafter, Detective Edwards testified that when he interviewed Marcia, she initially told him that on the morning of the crimes, she, Taylor, and Johnson drove to the liquor store in a brown Cutlass. After Edwards said he did not believe her, Marcia told Edwards defendant accompanied them to the store and that they drove there in Wallace\u2019s van. After Edwards said he believed the planning had occurred the night before, Marcia agreed and told Edwards the foursome met at her house the night before. She added that defendant said he had been to the store on a prior occasion and saw only one clerk, an old man, inside.\nDefendant\u2019s counsel objected that Marcia\u2019s statement that defendant had said he had previously been to the store was inadmissible hearsay, but the trial court ruled the statement was admissible to impeach Marcia\u2019s testimony and for its truth under the prior inconsistent statements exception to the hearsay rule. The court reasoned the statement was inconsistent with Marcia\u2019s direct testimony because Marcia did not mention it when the prosecutor asked about the statements defendant had made when he discussed his plans to rob the liquor store. The court then informed the parties that, although it had excused Marcia from giving further testimony, it would permit counsel to recall her to give her an opportunity to explain or deny the statement, as required under Evidence Code section 770. Marcia was not recalled to testify.\nb. Discussion\n\u201cA statement by a witness that is inconsistent with his or her trial testimony is admissible to establish the truth of the matter asserted in the statement under the conditions set forth in Evidence Code sections 1235 and 770.\u201d (People v. Johnson (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1183, 1219 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 702, 842 P.2d 1].)10 Defendant contends Marcia\u2019s statement to Detective Edwards *1295regarding what defendant told her about his prior visit to the liquor store was not admissible as a prior inconsistent statement because the prosecutor did not question Marcia specifically regarding whether defendant had previously been there. We need not decide the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling as to whether this particular statement of Marcia\u2019s was inconsistent with her trial testimony on that point. Marcia impliedly acknowledged to Edwards that she had heard of the liquor store the night before the murder when she told Edwards the group met that night and defendant told them he had gone to the store on a prior occasion and observed the lone clerk. On direct examination, however, Marcia denied she had \u201cever heard of Eddie\u2019s Liquor Store before [the morning of the crimes].\u201d In effect, Marcia\u2019s prior statement to Edwards was inconsistent with that testimony as to when she first heard of Eddie\u2019s and therefore was admissible under Evidence Code section 1235.* 11 (See People v. Cowan (2010) 50 Cal.4th 401, 462 [113 Cal.Rptr.3d 850, 236 P.3d 1074] [test for whether a witness\u2019s prior statement is inconsistent with prior testimony is whether the statement is inconsistent in effect rather than an express contradiction of terms].) Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Marcia\u2019s statements to Detective Edwards.12\n4. Adoptive Admission\nDefendant contends testimony regarding the letter Iris Johnston wrote to defendant was erroneously admitted under the hearsay exception for adoptive admissions. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1221.) Defendant also claims the Compton Police Department violated his due process rights and right to present a defense by failing to preserve his letter to Johnston in violation of California v. Trombetta (1984) 467 U.S. 479, 485-490 [81 L.Ed.2d 413, 104 S.Ct. 2528] (Trombetta).\na. Factual and Procedural Background\nOver defendant\u2019s objection, Iris Johnston testified she hand delivered a letter to defendant the evening of the murder in which she accused him of committing the robbery at the liquor store. A redacted version of her letter that omitted express or implied references to Johnson and Taylor was admitted *1296into evidence. The redacted letter read as follows: \u201c6-12-97 [f] Dear Dein, [f] What\u2019s up? Nothing much this way, just chillin in my room being bored, I want to tell you a little something! First of all I wanted to say I have a little idea that you guys did that little robbery in Long Beach, because ya\u2019ll ran to the T.V. to watch the news and than when ya\u2019ll seen the helicopters ya\u2019ll was like, \u2018yeah, we know the [guys] that did that. So I had a little ideal that ya\u2019ll did something and than when we was walking home ya\u2019ll was getting all nervous when a police car would pass by. Another idea I have is when we was on the phone together watching the news, you was all telling me to talk, until they showed that part about the robbery. I was like hello, you was like \u2018you can\u2019t talk while I\u2019m watching the news.\u2019 I was saying to my self they must of did it, that\u2019s why I got off the phone with you. And then when we was on the phone (Marcia, me, you) and ya\u2019ll was like ya\u2019ll need to tell each other something and ya\u2019ll didn\u2019t want me to hear, [f] Will all I am trying to say is that I don\u2019t want us going any further than what we already are, because if we go to gether and you get caught doing what ever the fuck you be doing, Fm just going to be ass out! Will just get back at me whenever! . . . P.S. Don\u2019t be afriad to tell me something! [(][] Much [heart symbol], [\u00dc Ms.\u201d\nDefendant did not read the letter in Johnston\u2019s presence. There is no evidence that he responded to it or discussed it with Johnston. Johnston did not speak with defendant until several years later, within months of her testimony at trial. During the search of defendant\u2019s residence one week after the shooting, police found the letter on his bedroom dresser.\nSergeant Reynolds testified that while searching Johnston\u2019s home on August 20, police found a handwritten letter from defendant to Johnston dated August 11. Reynolds booked defendant\u2019s letter into evidence at the Compton Police Department but did not note its contents in any report. Reynolds testified he was unable to locate defendant\u2019s letter because it was apparently misplaced when the Compton Police Department moved its evidence storage to a Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department facility.\nThe prosecutor sought to admit Johnston\u2019s letter as an implied admission by defendant that he had committed the attempted robbery because he failed to respond to that letter. Defense counsel objected that there was no foundation for admitting Johnston\u2019s letter because there was no evidence defendant had read it, and, alternatively, that the letter was inadmissible because defendant may have denied Johnston\u2019s accusation in his letter that law enforcement lost. The trial court admitted Johnston\u2019s letter into evidence, reasoning it was sufficiently accusatory to prompt a response from defendant and that none had been given. The court rejected as speculative the assertion by defendant\u2019s counsel that defendant may have denied the accusation in his letter to Johnston.\n*1297b. Johnston\u2019s Accusation\n\u201c[A] trial court has broad discretion to determine whether a party has established the foundational requirements for a hearsay exception [citation] and \u2018[a] ruling on the admissibility of evidence implies whatever finding of fact is prerequisite thereto . . . [Citation.] We review the trial court\u2019s conclusions regarding foundational facts for substantial evidence. [Citation.]\u201d (People v. DeHoyos (2013) 57 Cal.4th 79, 132 [158 Cal.Rptr.3d 797, 303 P.3d 1].)\nJohnston\u2019s letter constituted hearsay because the prosecution offered it as an out-of-court statement to prove that defendant did admit that he committed \u201cthat little robbery in Long Beach.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200.) The prosecutor sought admission of Johnston\u2019s letter under the adoptive admission hearsay exception. In support of that theory of admissibility, the prosecution introduced evidence that Johnston delivered her letter to defendant shortly after the crimes occurred, its contents were accusatory, defendant did not respond to Johnston\u2019s letter, that letter was found in his bedroom a week after Johnston delivered it, and he wrote a letter to Johnston two months later.\n\u201c \u2018Evidence of a statement offered against a party is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement is one of which the party, with knowledge of the content thereof, has by words or other conduct manifested his adoption or his belief in its truth.\u2019 (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1221.) Under this provision, \u2018[i]f a person is accused of having committed a crime, under circumstances which fairly afford him an opportunity to hear, understand, and to reply, and which do not lend themselves to an inference that he was relying on the right of silence guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and he fails to speak, or he makes an evasive or equivocal reply, both the accusatory statement and the fact of silence or equivocation may be offered as an implied or adoptive admission of guilt.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Riel (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1153, 1189 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 998 P.2d 969].)\nWhile the letter was plainly accusatory and would call for a response if the accusations were untrue and were known to defendant, there is no evidence of the circumstances under which defendant read the letter, if he had done so, and there is no evidence of defendant\u2019s reaction upon reading it. There was no showing that, by words or conduct, defendant manifested his adoption of, or belief in, the contents of Johnston\u2019s letter. Defendant\u2019s mere possession of it is insufficient to satisfy this requirement. (See, e.g., People v. Lewis (2008) 43 Cal.4th 415, 499 [75 Cal.Rptr.3d 588, 181 P.3d 947] [evidence of the defendant\u2019s possession of drawings that purportedly bore his nickname and indicated he identified with the Pen. Code section for robbery and considered himself a menace to society was insufficient to support a finding that he *1298manifested a belief in what the drawings depicted].) We conclude the trial court erred in admitting Johnston\u2019s letter under the adoptive admissions hearsay exception. Additionally, because there was no properly admitted evidence of an adoptive admission, the trial court erred in instructing the jury on adoptive admissions under CALJIC No. 2.71.5.\nDefendant argues his death judgment should be reversed because the prosecutor assertedly exploited the error in admitting the evidence during argument by stressing the evidence was critical to the People\u2019s case whether it was considered for its substance as an implied admission by defendant or as proof of what occurred. Also, the error assertedly reduced the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof of all elements of the capital charges in violation of his constitutional rights by \u201cfilling in holes in [its] case\u2014the identity of the perpetrators and corroboration of Marcia Johnson\u2019s testimony.\u201d\nWe find the argument unpersuasive. As explained below, we are satisfied the jury did not consider the contents of the letter for their truth. Also, the court instructed the jury that statements made by counsel are not evidence. (CALJIC No. 1.02.) Therefore, the erroneous admission of the evidence was harmless. (People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243] (Watson); see People v. Coffman and Marlow (2004) 34 Cal.4th 1, 76 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 710, 96 P.3d 30] [erroneous admission of evidence at the guilt phase is reviewed under Watson standard].) In addition, because the letter lacked substantive value, its erroneous admission had no impact on the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof, and therefore the error was not of constitutional dimension.\nDefendant nonetheless contends that the error and prejudice in the admission of Johnston\u2019s letter as an adoptive admission was exacerbated by the trial court\u2019s error in instructing the jury with CALJIC No. 2.71.5. Assertedly, the instructional error reduced the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof, in violation of his constitutional rights to due process, trial by an impartial jury, and a reliable death verdict.\nCALJIC No. 2.71.5 as given informed the jury that \u201c[i]f you should find from the evidence that there was an occasion when a defendant: one, under conditions which reasonably afforded him an opportunity to reply; two, failed to make a denial in the face of an accusation expressed directly to him, or in his presence charging him with the crime for which this defendant now is on trial, or tending to connect him with this commission, and; three, that he heard the accusation and understood its nature, then the circumstance of his silence on that occasion may be considered against him as indicating an admission that the accusation thus made was true. [|] Evidence of an accusatory statement is not received for the purpose of proving its truth, but *1299only as it supplies meaning to a silence of the accused in the face of it. [][] Unless you find that a defendant\u2019s silence at the time indicated an admission that the accusatory statement was true, you must entirely disregard his statement.\u201d\nUnder this instruction, the jury could consider evidence of the letter to infer an admission by defendant that Johnston\u2019s accusations were true only if it found preliminarily that defendant read her letter, understood its contents to be an accusation that he committed the liquor store robbery, and was reasonably afforded an opportunity to deny the accusation but failed to do so. As discussed above, we concluded the evidence was insufficient to establish these predicate facts. In addition, the jury was instructed under CALJIC No. 17.31 to disregard an instruction that applies to facts determined not to exist. We presume the jury followed the instructions it was given. (Guerra, supra, 37 Cal.4th at p. 1115.) Under these circumstances, a reasonable jury would have accorded no weight to the evidence. (See People v. Guiton (1993) 4 Cal.4th 1116, 1127 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 365, 847 P.2d 45] [\u201cIn analyzing the prejudicial effect of error, ... an appellate court does not assume an unreasonable jury.\u201d].) Moreover, because the instruction had no application to the facts alleged in the letter, defendant\u2019s claim that the instructional error reduced the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof is without merit. For these reasons, we conclude the error in instructing the jury under CALJIC No. 2.71.5 was harmless. (Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d at p. 836; see People v. Beltran (2013) 56 Cal.4th 935, 955 [157 Cal.Rptr.3d 503, 301 P.3d 1120] [\u201c \u2018 \u201c[misdirection of the jury, including incorrect, ambiguous, conflicting, or wrongly omitted instructions that do not amount to federal constitutional error are reviewed under the harmless error standard articulated\u201d in Watson\u2019 \u201d].)\nc. Loss of Defendant\u2019s Letter to Johnston\nDefendant contends that law enforcement committed prejudicial error in failing to disclose to the defense the contents of defendant\u2019s letter to Johnston and that law enforcement\u2019s subsequent loss or destruction of his letter violated his rights to present a defense and to due process pursuant to Arizona v. Youngblood (1988) 488 U.S. 51, 58 [102 L.Ed.2d 281, 109 S.Ct. 333], and Trombetta, supra, 467 U.S. at pages 488-489.\n\u201c ' \u201cLaw enforcement agencies have a duty, under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to preserve evidence \u2018that might be expected to play a significant role in the suspect\u2019s defense.\u2019 [Citations.] To fall within the scope of this duty, the evidence \u2018must both possess an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and be of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\u2019 [Citations.] The state\u2019s responsibility is further limited when the defendant\u2019s challenge is to \u2018the failure *1300of the State to preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said than that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated the defendant.\u2019 [Citation.] In such case, \u2018unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Farnam (2002) 28 Cal.4th 107, 166 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 47 P.3d 988].)\nDefendant did not raise this issue in the trial court. His due process claim under Trombetta is of a type that requires a trial court to consider additional facts and apply a legal standard different than that applied in ruling on a hearsay objection. (See People v. Boyer, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 441, fn. 17.) Therefore, the trial court\u2019s ruling that Johnston\u2019s letter was admissible as an adoptive admission would not have necessarily led to a rejection of the claim that defendant was denied due process of law because law enforcement had misplaced his letter to Johnston. {Ibid.) Accordingly, we conclude defendant\u2019s Trombetta claim is forfeited because defendant failed to raise the issue below. (People v. Duran, supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 289.)\nIn any event, the claim is without merit. Defendant has not shown that his letter had \u201c \u2018an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed [or lost].\u2019 \u201d (People v. Pastor Cruz (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 322, 325 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 13].) Assuming defendant\u2019s letter to Johnston potentially was useful to his defense, nothing in the record suggests it was lost due to bad faith on the part of law enforcement, and its absence \u201cdid not deny defendant all opportunity \u2018to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Thomas (2012) 54 Cal.4th 908, 929 [144 Cal.Rptr.3d 366, 281 P.3d 361], quoting Trombetta, supra, 467 U.S at p. 489.) Defendant was able to cross-examine Johnston on the issue and, had he chosen to do so, he could have testified to the nature of his letter to Johnston. \u201cThere is no constitutional infirmity in the circumstance that if defendant had wanted to expand on the information presented by [the contents of Johnston\u2019s letter,] and ... by testifying himself, he might have been put in the position of choosing between his right to testify at the trial and his right to remain silent. \u2018 \u201c \u2018The criminal process ... is replete with situations requiring the \u201cmaking of difficult judgments\u201d as to which course to follow. [Citation.] Although a defendant may have a right, even of constitutional dimensions, to follow whichever course he chooses, the Constitution does not by that token always forbid requiring him to choose.\u2019 \u201d [Citations.]\u2019 (People v. Letner and Tobin (2010) 50 Cal.4th 99, 153 [112 Cal.Rptr.3d 746, 235 P.3d 62].)\u201d (Thomas, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 929, fn. 5.)\n*13015. Accomplice Corroboration\nThe trial court instructed the jury that Marcia was an accomplice as a matter of law. Defendant contends his first degree murder and attempted robbery convictions and the attempted robbery felony-murder special-circumstance finding must be reversed because they were based on Marcia\u2019s uncorroborated testimony. The contention is without merit.\nSection 1111 provides: \u201cA conviction [cannot] be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless it be corroborated by such other evidence as shall tend to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense . . . .\u201d \u201c \u2018Corroborating evidence may be slight, may be entirely circumstantial, and need not be sufficient to establish every element of the charged offense.\u2019 [Citation.] The evidence is \u2018sufficient if it tends to connect the defendant with the crime in such a way as to satisfy the jury that the accomplice is telling the truth.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Gonzales and Soliz (2011) 52 Cal.4th 254, 303 [128 Cal.Rptr.3d 417, 256 P.3d 543].)\nMarcia testified as follows. On the morning of the crimes, defendant arrived at her house wearing a black-and-white Nike Air T-shirt and black jeans, with a Clock tucked in the waistband. Defendant articulated his plan to rob the liquor store to Marcia, Johnson, and Taylor and assigned each a task. Marcia identified Wallace\u2019s van as the one Taylor used to drive them. Defendant had the Clock in his waistband when he left the house and entered the van. Taylor parked a couple of blocks from the store. Marcia got out and walked to the store. Once inside, she looked around, bought some candy, and returned to the van. Marcia informed defendant that inside the store there were two cameras and one clerk. She got in the van, and defendant and Johnson got out. Defendant had a bulge in his waistband as he walked with Johnson toward the liquor store. After she heard a gunshot, she watched as defendant and Johnson ran to the van. They both reentered the van. Taylor then drove to a house in Long Beach where the group met Johnston.\nMarcia\u2019s testimony was sufficiently corroborated by other evidence connecting defendant to the attempted robbery and the murder at Eddie\u2019s. Defendant stole the murder weapon during the Riteway robbery, and the loaded murder weapon was found in defendant\u2019s bedroom closet one week after the murder. Eddie\u2019s surveillance videotape shows two African-American men entering and leaving the liquor store at the time of the crime, and defendant is African-American. One of the men wore a black T-shirt with a large white Air Nike logo on the front, and police found a similar shirt in defendant\u2019s bedroom one week after the crimes. Additionally, evidence that defendant participated in the robbery of the Riteway clerk in which a gun was *1302used reasonably supports an inference that defendant intended to rob the clerk working at Eddie\u2019s when defendant shot him with the Clock stolen from Riteway.\nWe conclude the record contains more than ample evidence that corroborates Marcia\u2019s testimony and supports defendant\u2019s convictions for first degree murder and attempted robbery, as well as for the attempted robbery felony-murder special-circumstance finding. Even if, as defendant asserts, section 1111 creates a \u201cliberty interest\u201d under Hicks v. Oklahoma (1980) 447 U.S. 343 [65 L.Ed.2d 175, 100 S.Ct. 2227], his federal constitutional right to due process was not violated based on uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.\n6. Still Photographs from the Liquor Store Videotape\nDefendant contends that the trial court erred prejudicially in admitting two still photographs that were printed from the liquor store videotape using equipment at Aerospace Corporation (Aerospace). Assertedly, the photographs were enhanced and the prosecution failed to lay a proper foundation. The contention is without merit.\na. Factual Background\nOfficer Holdredge testified that she arrived at Eddie\u2019s within minutes after the shooting, that she viewed the surveillance videotape police obtained at the crime scene, and that it accurately portrayed what occurred when she, Officer Romero, and Miller were inside the store. Long Beach Police Sergeant Jorge Cisneros testified that he viewed the videotape at the police station and identified People\u2019s exhibits Nos. 43A and 43B as the two still photographs that were printed from the videotape using equipment at the police station. He explained that the heads and necks of the subjects shown on the film were not visible on the still prints because the VCR \u201cdid not display the entire picture on the film,\u201d that is, the \u201ctop and bottom\u201d portions of the film (i.e., margins) were not visible.\nSergeant Cisneros went to Aerospace and requested that still photographs be printed from the videotape. He remained at Aerospace and watched one of its employees insert the videotape in a VCR that was connected to a computer, a monitor, and a printer. Cisneros described the Aerospace monitor as having a larger screen than the one used at the police station to view the videotape. According to Cisneros, when the videotape was played, \u201cthe picture of what was on that video tape did appear on the computer screen\u201d and it showed \u201cthe full length of the film on the VCR,\u201d including the images recorded in the margins of the film. He pointed to the frames he wanted *1303printed, and the employee printed the stills (People\u2019s exhibits Nos. 41 and 42). Cisneros testified that the difference between the images that were shown on the photographs printed using the equipment at the police station and those shown on the photographs printed using the Aerospace equipment was that the latter showed defendant\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s heads and necks, whereas the former did not. Cisneros said that Aerospace personnel informed him that \u201cthey could not do any enhancements to the video. [B]ut we did get, like I said, we could see more of the film, I believe because of the [equipment] we were using.\u201d Cisneros did not \u201cask that any of the action [on the videotape] be altered.\u201d In ruling the evidence was admissible, the trial court found that \u201cAerospace equipment [could] show the whole frame, [that] the Long Beach Police Department [could] only show a portion,\u201d and that the photographs had not been enhanced.\nb. Discussion\n\u201cNo photograph or film has any value in the absence of a proper foundation. It is necessary to know when it was taken and that it is accurate and truly represents what it purports to show. It becomes probative only upon the assumption that it is relevant and accurate.\u201d (People v. Bowley (1963) 59 Cal.2d 855, 862 [31 Cal.Rptr. 471, 382 P.2d 591] (Bowley).) The general rule is that a photograph is admissible upon a showing that it accurately depicts what it purportedly shows. (Ibid.; see Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 250 [a photograph is a \u201c[w]riting\u201d], 1400 [\u201cAuthentication of a writing means (a) the introduction of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the writing that the proponent of the evidence claims it is or (b) the establishment of such facts by any other means provided by law.\u201d].) \u201cThis is usually shown by the testimony of the one who took the picture. However, this is not necessary and it is well settled that the showing may be made by the testimony of anyone who knows that the picture correctly depicts what it purports to represent.\u201d (People v. Doggett (1948) 83 Cal.App.2d 405, 409 [188 P.2d 792]; see Bowley, supra, 59 Cal.2d at pp. 860-861, citing Doggett with approval.)\nEvidence Code section 1553, subdivision (a), establishes a rebuttable presumption that \u201c[a] printed representation of images stored on a video or digital medium is presumed to be an accurate representation of the images it purports to represent.\u201d The presumption affects the burden of proof and is rebutted by a showing that the \u201cprinted representation of images stored on [the] video or digital medium is inaccurate or unreliable.\u201d (Ibid.) The burden then shifts to the proponent of the printed representation to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it accurately represents the existence and content of the images on the video or digital medium. (Ibid.) If the proponent of the evidence fails to carry his burden of showing the printed representation accurately depicts what it purportedly shows, the evidence is inadmissible for lack of adequate foundation. (Bowley, supra, 59 Cal.2d at pp. 860-861.)\n*1304Once properly authenticated and admitted into evidence, a photograph may be used as demonstrative evidence to support a witness\u2019s testimony or as probative evidence of what is shown. (Bowley, supra, 59 Cal.2d at pp. 860-861.) A trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence of photographs will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. (People v. Rountree (2013) 56 Cal.4th 823, 852 [157 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 301 P.3d 150].)\nHere, the still photographs were properly authenticated and admitted into evidence. Officer Holdredge viewed the videotape police retrieved from the VCR at the crime scene and testified it accurately depicted her conduct and that of Officer Romero and Miller inside the store immediately after the shooting. Thus, the videotape was shown to be an accurate representation of what it purported to be, a recording of the events that occurred inside Eddie\u2019s at or near the time of the shooting.\nIn addition, Sergeant Cisneros testified that the still photographs printed at Aerospace depicted the images stored on the videotape that Officer Holdredge authenticated. He explained that the Aerospace photographs depicted the suspects\u2019 heads and necks because the company\u2019s equipment could print the portion of the recorded images stored in the margins of the videotape, whereas the equipment used at the police station could not. Under these circumstances, we conclude the prosecution established that the photographs printed at Aerospace depicted the images recorded on the videotape, and therefore were presumed to be accurate representations of those images. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1553.) Defendant\u2019s mere speculation that the photographs were manipulated or enhanced could not rebut this presumption. For these reasons, we conclude the photographs were adequately authenticated, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting them.\n7. Evidence of the Riteway Robbery\nDefendant claims the trial court committed prejudicial error when, despite defendant\u2019s willingness to plead guilty to the Riteway robbery and stipulate he obtained the gun used in the capital crime in that robbery, the court cross-admitted evidence of the Riteway robbery to prove defendant was guilty of the charged attempted robbery and murder at Eddie\u2019s. Defendant alternatively claims the trial court prejudicially erred in failing to give its promised limiting instruction on the other crimes evidence.\na. Factual and Procedural Background\nBefore any evidence was introduced, the prosecutor made a motion to permit the jury to consider evidence of the Riteway robbery on the capital *1305charges. She argued the evidence was relevant to show defendant, Johnson, and Taylor acted pursuant to a common plan or scheme and entered Eddie\u2019s with the intent to rob. Defendant offered to plead guilty to the Riteway robbery and to stipulate he obtained the gun used in the capital crime in that robbery. Defendant\u2019s plea offer was conditioned on the trial court finding that the Riteway robbery evidence was not admissible under Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b). Counsel further argued any evidence regarding the Riteway robbery other than the fact of a guilty plea to that robbery charge and a stipulation about the gun would be inadmissible because it would be unduly prejudicial under Evidence Code section 352.\nThe court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion, ruling that evidence of the Riteway robbery was relevant to prove intent and knowledge with regard to the capital charges under section (b) of Evidence Code section 1101, and that the evidence was not unduly prejudicial within the meaning of Evidence Code section 352. In response to that ruling, defendant withdrew his plea offer, and the trial court informed the parties that it would give an instruction as to defendant and Johnson on the purposes for which the jury could and could not consider the Riteway robbery evidence with regard to the liquor store charges. Prior to deliberations, the court gave a limiting instruction only as to Johnson that informed the jury it could consider the evidence on the issues of intent, identity, common plan, and knowledge.\nb. Discussion\nWe first consider whether the trial court erred in admitting the Riteway robbery evidence to prove defendant\u2019s involvement in the liquor store crimes.\n\u201cUnless evidence is admitted for a limited purpose, or against a specific party, evidence admitted at trial may generally be considered for any purpose. A corollary of this rule is that the jury is free to apply its factual findings on one count in deciding any other count to which those facts are relevant.\u201d (People v. Villatoro (2012) 54 Cal.4th 1152, 1170 [144 Cal.Rptr.3d 401, 281 P.3d 390], fn. omitted.) \u201cOne example of limited admissibility arises in the context of other crimes evidence. Evidence of a person\u2019s character, also known as propensity evidence, is inadmissible to prove conduct in conformity with that character trait. [Citations.] This is the familiar ban on propensity evidence: [Evidence of other crimes] generally cannot be admitted to prove the defendant is disposed to commit crimes. [Evidence Code] [s]ection 1101[, subdivision] (a) codifies this general rule. Notwithstanding that rule, [Evidence Code] section 1101, subdivision (b) . . . clarifies that [other crimes evidence] can be admitted for other relevant purposes, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, and so on, but [it] may not be admitted *1306to prove the defendant had a disposition to commit similar bad acts.\u201d (Id. at pp. 1170-1171, fn. omitted.)\n\u201cEvidence of identity is admissible where it is conceded or assumed that the charged offense was committed by someone, in order to prove that the defendant was the perpetrator.\u201d (People v. Ewoldt (1994) 7 Cal.4th 380, 394, fn. 2 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 646, 867 P.2d 757].) The admissibility of other crimes evidence for this purpose \u201cturns on proof that the [incidents] share sufficient distinctive common features to raise an inference of identity.\u201d (People v. Lindberg (2008) 45 Cal.4th 1, 23 [82 Cal.Rptr.3d 323, 190 P.3d 664], italics added.) We have often commented that \u201c \u2018[t]he pattern and characteristics of the crimes must be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.\u2019 \u201d (Ewoldt, supra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 403.)\nHere, the evidence established that defendant, an African-American male, stole a Clock handgun during the Riteway robbery, and that the same Clock was used to shoot and kill Moon at Eddie\u2019s nearly one month after the Riteway robbery. The evidence further established that the same stolen Clock was found loaded in defendant\u2019s bedroom closet one week after the murder at Eddie\u2019s. The evidence also revealed that defendant mentioned the Penal Code section for murder (\u00a7 187) during the Riteway robbery, and that the murder at Eddie\u2019s was committed by an African-American man using the Clock stolen from Riteway. In light of the distinctive shared features between the crimes at Riteway and Eddie\u2019s related to the Clock handgun, evidence of the circumstances surrounding the Riteway robbery supports the reasonable inference that the individual who committed the Riteway robbery and stole the Clock from Riteway is the same person who (1) had a Clock tucked in his waistband hours before the murder at Eddie\u2019s, (2) was one of the two perpetrators who used the stolen Clock to murder the clerk at Eddie\u2019s, and (3) possessed the stolen loaded Clock in his bedroom soon after the murder. Therefore, we conclude evidence related to the Riteway robbery evidence was relevant to the issue of identity with regard to the liquor store charges.\nThe Riteway robbery evidence also was relevant to the liquor store charges on the issue of intent. \u201cIn order to be admissible to prove intent, the uncharged misconduct must be sufficiently similar to the charged offense to support the inference that the defendant probably acted with the same intent in each instance. [Citations.]\u201d (People v. Lindberg, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 23.) \u201c \u2018The inference to be drawn is not that the actor is disposed to commit, such acts; instead, the inference to be drawn is that, in light of the first event, the actor, at the time of the second event, must have had the intent attributed to him by the prosecution.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (People v. Gallego (1990) 52 Cal.3d 115, 171 [276 Cal.Rptr. 679, 802 P.2d 169].)\n*1307Assuming defendant was one of the two individuals who planned and committed the acts that occurred at the liquor store on June 12, the fact that he committed the Riteway robbery was relevant to the issue of intent with regard to the attempted robbery charge connected with the liquor store murder. In both cases, an armed individual confronted a lone clerk behind the checkout counter of a small store during the daytime. Force was used against both clerks. The Clock stolen by defendant during the Riteway robbery was used by one of the perpetrators at the liquor store. Based on these similarities, evidence of the Riteway robbery would support a reasonable inference that defendant harbored the similar intent to rob in each instance.\nHaving concluded evidence of the Riteway robbery was admissible on the issues of identity and intent on the liquor store charges,13 we next address defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor was required to accept his plea offer and stipulation regarding the gun he stole during the Riteway robbery.\n\u201cThe general mle is that the prosecution in a criminal case cannot be compelled to accept a stipulation if the effect would be to deprive the state\u2019s case of its persuasiveness and forcefulness.\u201d (People v. Edelbacher (1989) 47 Cal.3d 983, 1007 [254 Cal.Rptr. 586, 766 P.2d 1].) The key factual disputes in this trial were whether defendant committed the crimes at the liquor store, and, if so, whether he acted with an intent to rob the liquor store\u2019s clerk. Defendant\u2019s plea offer and proposed stipulation regarding the Riteway robbery would not have included an admission on either of these issues. Had the facts of the Riteway robbery been withheld from the jury as the result of a stipulation, the prosecution would have been deprived of significant circumstantial evidence material to the liquor store crimes. There were no percipient witnesses to the liquor store crimes the surveillance videotape only showed the suspects entering and exiting the liquor store, and apparently nothing had been taken from the store. Under these circumstances, evidence of the Riteway robbery was crucial for the prosecution in demonstrating that defendant and Johnson possessed a similar intent to rob the liquor store in a similar fashion, in order to prove the charge of attempted robbery. In People v. Arias (1996) 13 Cal.4th 92 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 770, 913 P.2d 980], we held that the prosecutor could not be compelled to accept the defendant\u2019s offer to stipulate to charges stemming from a sexual assault where the prosecution would otherwise lose material circumstantial evidence relevant to the issues of identity and consciousness of guilt on charges stemming from a murder *1308that occurred prior to the sexual assault. (Id. at pp. 130-131.) Here, as in Arias, the prosecution was not required to accept defendant\u2019s plea offer and proposed stipulation.\nDefendant\u2019s claim to the contrary notwithstanding, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the details of the Riteway robbery on the capital charges under Evidence Code section 352. The robbery and attempted robbery counts from the separate incidents were properly joined as charging crimes of the same class (\u00a7 954; People v. Walker (1988) 47 Cal.3d 605, 622 [253 Cal.Rptr. 863, 765 P.2d 70]), and the details of the manner in which the Riteway robbery was carried out were not likely to inflame the jury\u2019s passions because, as defendant\u2019s attorney acknowledged, the Riteway robbery was a \u201cstandard robbery.\u201d\nWe next address defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court committed prejudicial error by failing to instruct the jury that evidence admitted to prove the Riteway robbery could not be considered to prove his propensity to commit the liquor store crimes. Although the trial court had informed the parties it would give a limiting instruction as to both Johnson and defendant, the court referred only to Johnson when it gave the limiting instruction prior to deliberations. Because the trial court was not obligated to provide a limiting instruction, defendant forfeited the issue by failing to request either a correction of the given instruction or a new instruction that applied specifically to the charges against defendant. (People v. Freeman (1994) 8 Cal.4th 450, 495 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 558, 882 P.2d 249].) In any event, any error in failing to give a limiting instruction as to defendant was harmless given the multiple permissible uses of the Riteway robbery evidence with regard to the liquor store charges, the absence of any argument by the prosecutor urging the jury to infer defendant\u2019s propensity to commit robberies, the presumption that the jurors followed the instructions regarding presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt, and the overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt as to the liquor store charges.\n8. CALJIC No. 17.41.1\nPursuant to CALJIC No. 17.41.1, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he integrity of a trial requires that jurors, at all times during their deliberations, conduct themselves as required by these instructions. Accordingly, should it occur that any juror refuses to deliberate or expresses an intention to disregard the law or to decide the case in this guilt phase based on penalty or punishment, or any other improper basis, it is the obligation of the other jurors to immediately advise the Court of the situation.\u201d Defendant contends this instruction infringed on his federal and state constitutional rights to trial by jury and his state constitutional right to a unanimous verdict. (U.S. Const., 6th &amp; 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16.)\n*1309Although we disapproved use of this instruction in future trials in People v. Engelman (2002) 28 Cal.4th 436 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 862, 49 P.3d 209], we held that \u201cthe instruction does not infringe upon defendant\u2019s federal or state constitutional right to trial by jury or his state constitutional right to a unanimous verdict . . . (id. at pp. 439-440.) Defendant provides no persuasive reason for us to reconsider our conclusion, nor does he cite anything in the record that indicates any juror refused to deliberate or expressed an intention to disregard the law or to decide the case on an improper basis. (See People v. Brown (2004) 33 Cal.4th 382, 393 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 624, 93 P.3d 244].) Accordingly, we reject this claim.\n9. Cumulative Error\nDefendant contends the cumulative effect of the asserted guilt phase errors requires reversal regardless of the prejudicial impact of any single error. To the extent there are instances in which we have found error or assumed its existence, we have concluded no prejudice resulted. We do not find reversible error by considering the claims cumulatively.\nC. Penalty Phase Issues (Penalty Retrial)\n1. B atson/Wheeler\nDefendant claims that at the penalty retrial, the trial court erroneously denied his two motions under People v. Wheeler (1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748] (Wheeler) based on the prosecutor\u2019s assertedly discriminatory use of peremptory challenges to remove African-American Prospective Jurors F.J. and J.S., in violation of his state constitutional right to trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16). For the first time on appeal, defendant claims the erroneous denial of his Wheeler motions deprived him of his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws. (Batson v. Kentucky (1986) 476 U.S. 79 [90 L.Ed.2d 69, 106 S.Ct. 1712] (Batson).)14 For the reasons we explain below, the trial court did not err in denying the Batson/Wheeler motions.15\n*1310a. Factual and Procedural Background\n(1) Prospective Jurors F.J. and J.S.\nDuring general voir dire, the prospective jurors responded orally to questions posed by the trial court that were based on questions that appeared on a printed questionnaire, which was provided to all jurors. Among other things, the jurors were asked to state their occupation, if any, and any prior occupation that was substantially different from their current employment.\nProspective Juror F.J. revealed that since graduating from high school he had been a driver with United Parcel Service (UPS) for 18 years. He had never held a supervisory position. He had prior jury experience in two criminal trials: a robbery case, which had proceeded to verdict, and a murder case, which had resulted in a hung jury. He had felt frustrated that the jurors could not reach a verdict.\nProspective Juror J.S. designed telephone circuits for Pacific Bell, her employer for 30 years. While she experienced career advancement and trained others in the use of computers and circuit designs for 20 years, she was never a supervisor. As a designer, she would get an order and put together the circuit. While in school and before her employment at Pacific Bell, J.S. worked at the \u201cDepartment of Justice\u201d or the \u201cDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office\u201d \u201chandling . . . transcripts and filing them.\u201d J.S. had prior jury service in a criminal and a civil trial, each of which reached a verdict. The criminal case concerned child molestation; the civil case involved personal injury. J.S. said she would express her opinions during deliberations and listen to her fellow jurors but would not change her views just to accommodate the views of others.\n(2) Peremptory Challenges\n\nProspective Juror F.J.\n\nAfter the prosecutor exercised her fourth peremptory challenge against Prospective Juror F.J., defense counsel objected the challenge was racially motivated, noting there remained only one or two African-Americans in the venire. The trial court responded that it \u201calways feel[s] inadequate in these Wheeler motions. Now Pm supposed to put on a D.A. hat and look at my notes and see whether, in my opinion, a reasonable D.A. would have had a not racial reason for using a peremptory.\u201d The court noted that some district attorneys automatically exclude a prospective juror who had served on a hung jury. It found defendant failed to make a prima facie showing of group bias and offered the prosecutor the opportunity to place her reasons for the challenge on the record.\n*1311In response, the prosecutor noted that F.J. had \u201c[n]o significant life experiences that indicates strong decisionmaking skills. He\u2019s been throughout his occupation, a UPS driver, never supervised anybody. There is nothing about his background that indicates that he can engage in a decision that\u2014of this magnitude. There is . . . strength about his background; although, in a different type of case, I think he would be a wonderful juror, but this is a penalty where I\u2019m going to be asking him to bring back a verdict of death. I want strong decisionmaking skills.\u201d The court then said its notes indicated \u201csince high school UPS driver, loading, no supervisory experience, girlfriend sells computers, two minor children, plays golf, coaches a traveling basketball team.\u201d After the court denied the motion, the prosecutor added that the decision in the penalty phase of a death penalty case \u201cis far more stressful and of greater magnitude than your ordinary case, and I bear that in mind when I excuse jurors.\u201d\n\nProspective Juror J.S.\n\nFollowing Prospective Juror F.J.\u2019s excusal, the parties exercised several more peremptory challenges. When the prosecutor challenged Prospective Juror J.S., counsel made his second Batson/Wheeler motion. He argued that \u201c[tjhere\u2019s only two or three left in the group in the audience. She seemed like an idea [sic] juror. She had two priors, both\u2014one civil, one criminal. There was a verdict. She has worked for many, many, many years at Pacific Bell. Worked her way up. She supervised people. She trains. She obviously can make decisions. She worked\u2014and just otherwise seems to be a good juror. [1] I can\u2019t see any reason why the District Attorney would not accept her, other than the fact she is a black female. [][] And I would note that the last jury which hung, the two hangs were black females. But that should not be a basis.\u201d\nThe trial court reminded counsel that the prosecutor had explained that she \u201crelied on life\u2019s experience criteria\u201d earlier in excusing Prospective Juror F.J. and stated that it did not recall that Prospective Juror J.S. \u201csupervised anybody.\u201d The trial court \u201cbelievefd] she [had] trained people on how to use the computer design circuits.\u201d\nAfter the court invited the prosecutor to comment, she stated that \u201cmy recollection is that she specifically said she did not supervise anybody.\u201d The prosecutor felt J.S. had a \u201cmisleading\u201d job description, that she \u201cmakes no decisions. She is given specifications and she inputs that information into a computer. She is basically a more sophisticated form of a filing clerk\u201d and has \u201cheld nothing but clerk positions. She has trained individuals in terms of inputting data. She is a data entry specialist, basically, [f] I don\u2019t think the fact she trains people in how they input data makes her specifically qualified *1312for high-stress decision-mating jobs. . . . This is going to be a very stressful, deliberative process [that] requires individuals who are seasoned decision makers. They could handle the stress of a tough decision. The fear factor involved any time you get a stressful and difficult decision to make, that can be very crippling in terms of the deliberation process when you get somebody in the jury room who doesn\u2019t have that experience. And that\u2019s one of . . . the many things that I look at in terms of a juror, [f] I\u2019ve looked at her job description. She has basically been in clerk positions. If I were to not tick her, it seems to me that it would only be because she is an African American. And I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019m going to discriminate in one direction or the other. I\u2019m not going to keep her simply because she is African American. . . . [T]here\u2019s absolutely nothing about her background that tells me that she can operate in a high-stress situation. And that\u2019s very important in this type of case where the issue is life and death.\u201d\nThe court found defendant had failed to make a prima facie case of racial discrimination but permitted counsel to further argue. Counsel argued J.S.\u2019s life experiences, including her 30-year employment with Pacific Bell, employment at the Department of Justice, and her 20-year experience at Pacific Bell training others in the use of computers and circuit designs provided her adequate experience to make difficult decisions, and thus she was qualified to sit as a capital juror.\nThe trial court clarified that J.S. had been a \u201cfiling clerk\u201d with the Department of Justice and stated that regardless of whether it would have used the prosecutor\u2019s criteria to exercise peremptory challenges, it found significant that it was \u201ca non-race based criteria. And her use of the peremptory as to this juror was consistent with that non-suspect category use.\u201d\nThe prosecutor was permitted to add to the record that \u201cit\u2019s not just supervisory positions that I look for. I look for how they handled stressful situations or incidents] in their life.\u201d She said she had to decide \u201cwhether or not an individual juror has what it takes to be fearless in the decision to handle the stress of the moment, and to engage in basically a deliberative process that involves a decision of an enormous magnitude.\u201d Noting she has limited things she can look at, and that voir dire is like a job interview, she concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that [J.S.] is up to the decision in this case.\u201d\nThe court said it was \u201cconfident the D.A. is not using a protected category basis for her peremptories\u201d and gave the defense further opportunity to make a record. Defense counsel asked the court, \u201cMay I inquire, this juror was asked whether or not she has ever had to deal with stress in her life, specifically?\u201d The trial court stated that \u201cI don\u2019t recall that specific question. *1313But there were questions about her life.\u201d The prosecutor then objected, stating, \u201cHow a person deals with stress and how they recognize it as stress will vary from individual to individual. I know what I go on; their ability to deal with stress is one of the things I look at, including their ability to make decisions. That includes processing information and experience in making decisions. It\u2019s my opinion that more experienced people in terms of decision makers make better decisions for the appropriate reasons.\u201d The trial court denied the request to reopen voir dire and denied the Batson/Wheeler motion. At that time, the jury for the penalty retrial included 11 Caucasians and one African-American. The alternate jurors included two Caucasians, one African-American, and an individual who may have been Hispanic or Filipino.\nb. Discussion\nThe federal and state Constitutions prohibit the use of peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors based solely on impermissible group bias. (Batson, supra, 476 U.S. at p. 89; Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at pp. 276-277.) We conduct the three-step Batson inquiry to review claims of alleged group bias based on race. \u201cFirst, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has made a prima facie showing that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge based on race. Second, if the showing is made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to demonstrate that the challenges were exercised for a race-neutral reason. Third, the court determines whether the defendant has proven purposeful discrimination. The ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike. [Citation.] The three-step procedure also applies to state constitutional claims.\u201d (People v. Lenix (2008) 44 Cal.4th 602, 612-613 [80 Cal.Rptr.3d 98, 187 P.3d 946] (Lenix).)\nIn ruling on defendant\u2019s Batson/Wheeler motion concerning F.J.\u2019s excusal, the court explicitly ruled that he failed to make a prima facie showing of discrimination. Then, after the prosecutor stated her reasons for excusing FJ, the trial court stated that \u201cmy notes, since high school UPS driver, loading, no supervisory experience, girlfriend sells computers, two minor children, plays golf, coaches a traveling basketball team.\u201d In doing so, the trial court impliedly agreed with the prosecutor that F.J. did not have supervisory experience and found the prosecutor\u2019s justification was genuine.\nIn denying defendant\u2019s Batson/Wheeler motion regarding J.S., the trial court stated that a \u201cprima facie showing [of group bias] has not been made.\u201d It recalled that J.S. had experience training others at Pacific Bell \u201con how to use the computer design circuits\u201d but not supervising employees. The court also expressly found that the prosecutor\u2019s justification was a \u201cnon-race based *1314criteria\u201d and that her excusal of J.S. was \u201cconsistent with that non-suspect category.\u201d Taken together, the court\u2019s statements evince its satisfaction that the prosecutor\u2019s explanations were genuine and credible.\nWhere the trial court determines that defendant did not make a prima facie showing of group bias and also rules on, indicates agreement or satisfaction with, or otherwise passes judgment on the ultimate question of purposeful discrimination, the case is described as a first stage/third stage Batson/Wheeler hybrid, and the question whether a defendant established a prima facie case of group bias is rendered moot. (People v. Riccardi (2012) 54 Cal.4th 758, 786 [144 Cal.Rptr.3d 84, 281 P.3d 1] [question whether defendant established prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination rendered moot where \u201cthe court expressly agreed with the prosecutor\u2019s reasons, and thereafter appeared implicitly to agree with the prosecutor\u2019s reasons given in response to [the] defendant\u2019s subsequent Wheeler motions\u201d]; Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613, fn. 8, citing Hernandez v. New York (1991) 500 U.S. 352, 359 [114 L.Ed.2d 395, 111 S.Ct. 1859]; see People v. Mills (2010) 48 Cal.4th 158, 173-174 [106 Cal.Rptr.3d 153, 226 P.3d 276] [question whether prima facie case of group bias has been made is mooted where the trial \u201cpassed judgment on the prosecutor\u2019s actual reasons for the peremptory challenges (the third stage of a Batson inquiry), expressly noting that the court was \u2018satisfied . . . from the explanation given by the prosecutor\u2019 that the motivation for the challenges was not based on race\u201d].) Here, as indicated above, with respect to each of defendant\u2019s Batson/Wheeler motions, the trial court ruled ultimately that the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons were genuine and race neutral, and therefore, as to each motion, the question whether defendant made a prima facie showing of racial discrimination is rendered moot. Accordingly, \u201c \u2018we express no opinion on whether defense counsel established a prima facie case of discrimination and instead skip to Batson\u2019s third stage to evaluate the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for dismissing [the] African-American prospective jurors.\u2019 \u201d (Riccardi, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 787.)\n\u201cAt the third stage of the Wheeler/Batson inquiry, \u2018the issue comes down to whether the trial court finds the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral explanations to be credible. Credibility can be measured by, among other factors, the prosecutor\u2019s demeanor; by how reasonable, or how improbable, the explanations are; and by whether the proffered rationale has some basis in accepted trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613.) In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a Batson/Wheeler motion, we examine \u201conly whether substantial evidence supports its conclusions.\u201d (Lenix at p. 613.) \u201c \u2018We presume that a prosecutor uses peremptory challenges in a constitutional manner and give great deference to the trial court\u2019s ability to distinguish bona fide reasons from sham excuses. [Citation.] So long as the trial court makes a sincere and reasoned effort to evaluate the nondiscriminatory justifications *1315offered, its conclusions are entitled to deference on appeal. [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d (People v. Manibusan (2013) 58 Cal.4th 40, 76 [165 Cal.Rptr.3d 1].)\nDefendant first contends we should not give the normal deference to the trial court\u2019s rulings because the trial court was biased. Defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary notwithstanding, the fact that in ruling on the Batson/Wheeler motion as to J.S., the trial court mentioned the reasons the prosecutor gave for her earlier decision to challenge F.J. does not, as defendant asserts, establish it abandoned its neutrality. We next consider whether substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s rulings that the prosecutor provided plausible, race-neutral reasons for challenging F.J. and J.S.\n(1) Statistical Evidence\n\u201cIf a prosecutor articulates a basis for a peremptory challenge that results in the disproportionate exclusion of members of a certain race, the trial judge may consider that fact as evidence that the prosecutor\u2019s stated reason constitutes a pretext for racial discrimination.\u201d (Hernandez v. New York, supra, 500 U.S. at p. 363 (plur. opn. of Kennedy, J.).) Defendant contends statistical evidence demonstrates that the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges to F.J. and J.S. were racially motivated.\nHere, the 59-member venire included four or five African-Americans, representing approximately 6.7 or 8.5 percent of the venire. The prosecutor used 18.2 percent of her challenges (two of 11) to remove 40 percent (two of five) or 50 percent (two of four) of the available African-Americans. The prosecutor used two additional challenges against non-African-Americans during selection of the four alternate jurors. Thus, before accepting the panel, the prosecutor exercised a total of 15.4 percent of her challenges (two of 13) against African-American prospective jurors. One African-American sat on the jury, and one sat as an alternate.16\nWe do not find these numbers suggest improper discrimination. In People v. Pearson, supra, 56 Cal.4th at page 422, we held the prosecutor\u2019s use of one of two peremptory challenges (50 percent) against a group comprising only 12.5 percent of the 24-member panel did not appear \u201c \u2018suspicious.\u2019 \u201d The numbers here are similar and do not cause concern that the challenges were racially motivated. In addition, we observe that the sole African-American on the jury represented 8.3 percent of the jury, approximately the same percentage of African-Americans on the venire. Further, *1316while not conclusive, the fact that the jury included an African-American \u201cis an indication of good faith [by the prosecutor] in exercising peremptories.\u201d (People v. Turner (1994) 8 Cal.4th 137, 168 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 762, 878 P.2d 521].)\nAfter reviewing the relevant statistics, we are not persuaded that a disproportionate number of African-Americans were excluded from the jury. However, because even a lone race-based challenge is unconstitutional, we bear in mind those statistics while examining the prosecutor\u2019s explanation for challenging FJ. and J.S. (People v. Jones (2011) 51 Cal.4th 346, 363 [121 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 247 P.3d 82].)\n(2) The Prosecutor\u2019s Explanations\n\u201cA prosecutor asked to explain his conduct must provide a \u2018 \u201cclear and reasonably specific\u201d explanation of his \u201clegitimate reasons\u201d for exercising the challenges.\u2019 \u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613, quoting Batson, supra, 476 U.S. at p. 98, fn. 20.) \u201cNevertheless, although a prosecutor may rely on any number of bases to select jurors, a legitimate reason is one that does not deny equal protection.\u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613.) A peremptory challenge may be justified by \u201ca neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried.\u201d (Batson, supra, 476 U.S. at p. 98.) A peremptory challenge may be based on employment (see, e.g., People v. Johnson (1989) 47 Cal.3d 1194, 1216, 1220 [255 Cal.Rptr. 569, 767 P.2d 1047]), and \u201c \u2018hunches[,]\u2019 and even \u2018arbitrary\u2019 exclusion is permissible, so long as the reasons are not based on impermissible group bias\u201d (People v. Turner, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 165). The basis for a challenge may range from \u201cthe virtually certain to the highly speculative\u201d (Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 275) and \u201ceven a \u2018trivial\u2019 reason, if genuine and neutral, will suffice.\u201d (People v. Arias, supra, 13 Cal.4th at p. 136.)\nCiting Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at page 276, defendant contends the prosecutor\u2019s reasons were not valid because a lack of supervisory experience does not reflect a specific bias against the prosecution, nor does it indicate the juror will be unable to deliberate in the case at hand. While Wheeler explained that peremptory challenges are permissible to remove a prospective juror who harbors \u201ca specific bias . . . relating to the particular case on trial or the parties or witnesses thereto\u201d (Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 276), it also recognized that \u201cthe law allows removal of a biased juror by a challenge for which no reason \u2018need be given,\u2019 i.e., publicly stated; in many instances the party . . . cannot establish his reason by normal methods of proof . . .\u201d (id. at p. 275). Therefore, as long as it is exercised in a nondiscriminatory manner, a peremptory challenge may be based on speculation that a prospective juror would be unable to decide a penalty because he or she lacked supervisory work experience.\n*1317Here, the prosecutor stated she desired jurors who could make difficult decisions such as those in the penalty phase of a death penalty case. It was her belief that this quality is demonstrated by a person who has had practical work experience as a supervisor and that those who did not have this experience were less likely to be able to decide hard questions. The prosecutor further stated that because the prospective jurors\u2019 oral responses to the written questionnaire the trial court used during general voir dire provided only limited personal and background information about the prospective jurors, she believed this factor provided relevant and sufficient information to consider in exercising peremptory challenges in this case.\n\u201cThe proper focus of a Batson/Wheeler inquiry, of course, is on the subjective genuineness of the race-neutral reasons given for the peremptory challenge, not on the objective reasonableness of those reasons.\u201d (People v. Reynoso (2003) 31 Cal.4th 903, 924 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 769, 74 P.3d 852] [prosecutor\u2019s subjective opinion that a customer service representative lacks educational experience to effectively serve as a juror, while \u201cof questionable persuasiveness,\u201d could properly form the basis of a peremptory challenge].) Therefore, a prosecutor \u201ccan challenge a potential juror whose occupation, in the prosecutor\u2019s subjective estimation, would not render him or her the best type of juror to sit on the case for which the jury is being selected.\u201d (Id. at p. 925.)\nIf the prosecutor in this case genuinely exercised her peremptory challenges because, in her subjective estimation, neither F.J. nor J.S. had the \u201chigh stress\u201d decisionmaking skills required of a capital juror, that explanation constitutes \u201can entirely valid and nondiscriminatory reason for exercising [those] challenge^].\u201d (People v. Reynoso, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 924, italics omitted.) Here, the prosecutor asked other non-African-American prospective jurors whether they had supervisory experience, and the defense, apparently sharing the prosecutor\u2019s view that supervisory experience was a factor worthy of consideration, sought the same information from several other prospective jurors. We conclude the record substantially supports the trial court\u2019s conclusions that the prosecutor\u2019s explanations for peremptorily challenging F.J. and J.S. were genuine and not racially motivated.\nThe dissent makes much of the fact that, in making the Batson/Wheeler objection, defense counsel asserted that \u201cthe two hangs [at the first trial] were black females.\u201d Assuming the assertion, not otherwise supported in the record, was accurate, the trial court was aware of it and could take it into account in its ruling. It does not itself show discriminatory intent at the second trial.\n*1318(3) Comparative Analysis\nDefendant contends a comparative juror analysis of FJ.\u2019s and J.S.\u2019s work experience with that of eight non-African-American jurors whom the prosecutor did not challenge (W.B., L.F., G.M., K.K., B.A., R.P., W.F., M.C.) demonstrates that the prosecutor\u2019s justifications for challenging FJ. and J.S. were pretextual. \u201cComparative juror analysis is evidence that, while subject to inherent limitations, must be considered when reviewing claims of error at [Batson/Wheeler]\u2019s third stage when the defendant relies on such evidence and the record is adequate to permit the comparisons.\u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 607.) \u201cIn those circumstances, comparative juror analysis must be performed on appeal even when such an analysis was not conducted below.\u201d (Ibid.) \u201c[Comparative juror analysis is but one form of circumstantial evidence that is relevant, but not necessarily dispositive, on the issue of intentional discrimination.\u201d (Id. at p. 622.) This is true because \u201c[o]n appellate review, a voir dire answer sits on a page of transcript. In the trial court, however, advocates and trial judges watch and listen as the answer is delivered. Myriad subtle nuances may shape it, including attitude, attention, interest, body language, facial expression and eye contact. \u2018Even an inflection in the voice can make a difference in the meaning.\u2019 \u201d (Ibid.) Moreover, we have recognized \u201cthat it is a combination of factors rather than any single one which often leads to the exercise of a peremptory challenge\u201d; that \u201cthe particular combination or mix of jurors which a lawyer seeks may, and often does, change as certain jurors are removed or seated in the jury box\u201d; and that \u201cthe same factors used in evaluating a juror may be given different weight depending on the number of peremptory challenges the lawyer has at the time of the exercise of the peremptory challenge and the number of challenges remaining with the other side.\u201d (People v. Johnson, supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 1220.) \u201cIt is therefore with good reason that we and the United States Supreme Court give great deference to the trial court\u2019s determination that the use of peremptory challenges was not for an improper or class bias purpose.\u201d (Id. at p. 1221.)\n\u201cThe high court stated: \u2018It is true that peremptori.es are often the subjects of instinct, Batson v. Kentucky, supra, [476 U.S.] at [page] 106 .. . (Marshall, J., concurring), and it can sometimes be hard to say what the reason is. But when illegitimate grounds like race are in issue, a prosecutor simply has got to state his reasons as best he can and stand or fall on the plausibility of the reasons he gives. A Batson challenge does not call for a mere exercise in thinking up any rational basis. If the stated reason does not hold up, its pretextual significance does not fade because a trial judge, or an appeals court, can imagine a reason that might not have been shown up as false.\u2019 [Citation.] The high court cautioned that efforts by a trial or reviewing *1319court to \u2018substitute\u2019 a reason will not satisfy the prosecutor\u2019s burden of stating a racially neutral explanation. (Ibid.)\u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at pp. 624-625.)\nPreliminarily, defendant contends that the only criteria to be examined using comparative analysis are the prosecutor\u2019s characterizations and the record of actual responses by challenged and unchallenged jurors. However, \u201c[wjhen asked to engage in comparative juror analysis for the first time on appeal, a reviewing court need not, indeed, must not turn a blind eye to reasons the record discloses for not challenging other jurors even if those other jurors are similar in some respects to excused jurors.\u201d (People v. Jones, supra, 51 Cal.4th at pp. 365-366.) This is so because a party legitimately may challenge one prospective juror but not another to whom the same particular concern applies. (Id. at p. 365.) \u201cTwo panelists might give a similar answer on a given point. Yet the risk posed by one panelist might be offset by other answers, behavior, attitudes or experiences that make one juror, on balance, more or less desirable. These realities, and the complexity of human nature, make a formulaic comparison of isolated responses an exceptionally poor medium to overturn a trial court\u2019s factual finding.\u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 624.)\nBefore we proceed with our analysis, we address the question whether it is appropriate to consider the oral responses of the non-African-American jurors that were provided after the trial court denied his second motion, that is, the responses of Prospective Jurors B.A., R.P., W.F., and M.C. As we stated in Lenix, \u201cappellate review is necessarily circumscribed. . . . [T]he trial court\u2019s finding is reviewed on the record as it stands at the time the [Batson/Wheeler] ruling is made.\u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 624.) \u201cIf the defendant believes that subsequent events should be considered by the trial court, a renewed objection is required to permit appellate consideration of these subsequent developments.\u201d (Ibid) Thus, if defendant believed the trial court should have considered any postruling developments, he could have, and should have, renewed his Batson/Wheeler claim. Because defendant did not, his reliance on the responses of the above jurors that were provided after the trial court denied his second motion is forfeited. Nonetheless, out of caution, we consider the responses of these prospective jurors in our comparison below.\n\nJuror W.B.\n\nJuror W.B. was a network technician for the Huntington Beach School District, and his responsibilities included computer network administration and computer troubleshooting. He did not supervise anyone in that position, but he had previously worked in sales and office management for an electrical *1320wholesale business. There, he supervised two to three \u201cwarehouse-type\u201d employees. Defendant acknowledges this juror\u2019s supervisory experience, but asserts it should be accorded little weight because for the five years prior to defendant\u2019s trial, the juror held jobs that required increased technical experience and lacked supervisory responsibilities. However, the prosecutor\u2019s questions indicate she was concerned with supervisory work experience in general, not that such experience had to be the prospective juror\u2019s current or most recent position.\n\nJuror L.F.\n\nJuror L.F. worked as an administrative assistant for Boeing \u201coff and on about 20 years,\u201d handling workers\u2019 compensation and medical claims and acting as \u201ca buffer between the injured worker and the insurance carrier.\u201d Although she made no decisions on the approval or rejection of claims, she consulted with others on those decisions, provided input, and discussed pertinent information with the individual making the ultimate decision. The prosecutor may have reasonably viewed Juror L.F. as someone with experience in making decisions in stressful circumstances, and someone who would work well with other jurors as a team and return a verdict.\n\nJuror G.M.\n\nJuror G.M. was a senior consulting engineer for Tasco Refining. He had never directly supervised people, although he had directed and reviewed the work of engineering contractors. He sometimes worked as part of a team. The prosecutor may have reasonably found Juror G.M. to be more favorable than FJ. and J.S. based solely on his experience in directing and reviewing the work of others, as well as making independent, complex decisions, experience she believed indicated the prospective juror could decide difficult questions.\n\nJuror K.K.\n\nJuror K.K. was a Raytheon lab technician who had worked in the areas of metallurgy and electronic failure analysis for 15 years. He did not supervise employees, but the employees would help each other. Depending on the problem presented, Juror K.K. might receive instructions from engineers or might instruct others. Juror K.K. had obtained an advance degree in finance that was related to his job. The prosecutor may have reasonably found that while Juror K.K. lacked supervisory experience, his ability to receive and give instructions to solve problems on a continuing basis demonstrated a strong ability to make decisions. By contrast, F.J.\u2019s and J.S.\u2019s work experience did not appear to involve these skills.\n\n*1321\nJuror B.A.\n\nJuror B.A. was a sales representative for Frito-Lay company. Previously, she had been the assistant manager of a high school cafeteria for seven years. Defendant asserts this juror \u201cwas never a true supervisor\u201d because she merely was responsible for \u201cseeing that the food was served properly and on time and everybody was doing their duties.\u201d The prosecutor had explained she generally was looking for supervisory responsibilities that revealed that a juror could make tough decisions. Juror B.A.\u2019s responses suggested her responsibilities as a cafeteria manager included supervising other employees. Nothing in the description of Prospective Jurors F.J.\u2019s and J.S.\u2019s job responsibilities appears to compare. Significantly, Juror B.A. had been trained in the operation of firearms and owned a variety of firearms. She had shot \u201c.22\u2019s, ,38\u2019s, .45\u2019s, [and] nine millimeters,\u201d and owed four .22 rifles, a .22 pistol, a nine-millimeter semiautomatic, and a 20-gauge shotgun. The backgrounds of FJ. and J.S. were distinguishable from Juror B.A. by their lack of any supervisory responsibilities, as well as by their lack of experience with guns, a significant factor given the prosecution\u2019s reliance on ballistics evidence in this case.\n\nJuror R.P.\n\nJuror R.P. had been a diesel equipment operator for 11 years. Like FJ. and J.S., he did not have supervisory work experience. However, Juror R.P. had had life experiences FJ. and J.S. lacked that suggested he would be a favorable juror for the prosecution. Juror R.P. had previously been a juror in a capital case that involved multiple murder charges and special circumstances allegations, and the jury had reached verdicts in both the guilt and penalty phase. The fact that Juror R.P. had been in the same stressful decisionmaking environment about which the prosecutor was concerned substantially distinguishes him from FJ. and J.S. In addition, Juror R.P. had ties to Long Beach law enforcement: his brother-in-law was the police chief of its airport, his sister was a 911 operator for the Long Beach Police Department, and an acquaintance worked for the police department. The prosecutor could have chosen not to strike Juror R.P. because of those strong ties to law enforcement. (See People v. Gray (2005) 37 Cal.4th 168, 190-191 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 451, 118 P.3d 496] [prosecutor could have chosen not to strike a juror whose husband was a California Highway Patrol officer, believing the juror would be favorable to the prosecution].) In addition, Juror R.P. had witnessed two separate killings. At the scene of the first, he identified the suspect for police. Juror R.P. had intended to testify in that case and had gone to court but was not called to the witness stand. He did testify at the vehicular manslaughter trial related to the second killing. These experiences suggest Juror R.P. was not *1322easily intimidated and could make hard decisions. Notwithstanding Juror R.P.\u2019s lack of supervisory experience, the prosecutor could have believed he would have less difficulty deliberating during penalty than either FJ. or J.S.\n\nJuror W.F.\n\nJuror W.F. was an account coordinator for a coupon distribution company, consulting with manufacturers to decide the type of media to use for distribution of coupons. She worked in conjunction with her account manager in making decisions for her clients. Juror W.F. had previously worked for a public relations advertising agency and as a marketing manager for Little Caesar\u2019s Pizza. Although she did not have supervisory work experience, her work experience is distinguishable from that of FJ. and J.S. in that it required decisionmaking and working in a team environment. In addition, Juror W.F.\u2019s brother-in-law was a Long Beach police officer whom she saw twice a month. The prosecutor could have believed Juror W.F.\u2019s connection to the Long Beach Police Department, one of the investigating agencies in this case, would have made her a desirable juror for the prosecution.\n\nJuror M.C.\n\nJuror M.C., a widow with nine adult children, had volunteered as a docent at the Torrance courthouse for 13 years. She had previously been a nurse\u2019s aide for five years. She had prior jury service in a robbery trial that proceeded to verdict. One of her nephews was retired from the Los Angeles Police Department, and another was an interpreter at the Long Beach courthouse. Although Juror M.C. lacked supervisory experience, the prosecutor could have decided she was a desirable juror for the prosecution who could deliberate effectively based on her experience running a large household, her volunteer docent work in a courthouse for 13 years, her experience on a criminal case that reached a verdict, and her ties to the legal community and law enforcement.\nThe comparative analysis we have undertaken, whether or not it includes our consideration of the oral responses of the non-African-American jurors that were provided after the trial court denied defendant\u2019s second motion, does not undermine our conclusion that substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s denial of the Batson/Wheeler motions as to FJ. and J.S.\n2. Admissibility of Miller\u2019s Statements to Officer Romero, Johnston\u2019s Letter to Defendant, and the Still Photographs\nIn determining the penalty, the jury takes into account \u201c[t]he circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present *1323[case].\u201d (\u00a7 190.3, factor (a).) Therefore, \u201cevidence of the circumstances of the offense, including evidence creating a lingering doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense, is admissible at a penalty retrial [as a factor in mitigation] under . . . section 190.3 . . . .\u201d (People v. Gay (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1195, 1221 [73 Cal.Rptr.3d 442, 178 P.3d 422].) During the penalty retrial, the prosecution introduced evidence that it had presented at the guilt trial to establish the circumstances of the crimes. Defendant\u2019s trial attorney argued that notwithstanding the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, lingering doubts existed regarding whether the shooting was accidental, whether defendant was the actual shooter, the credibility of Marcia\u2019s accomplice testimony, and the credibility of the forensic expert concerning the expended bullets and casings.\nHere, defendant contends the trial court at the penalty retrial erred in admitting as circumstances of the crime (1) Miller\u2019s statements to Officer Romero, (2) Johnston\u2019s letter as an adoptive admission defendant committed \u201cthat little robbery in Long Beach,\u201d and (3) the still photographs printed at Aerospace. He argues the erroneous admission of this evidence was prejudicial because it permitted the prosecutor to \u201cnegat[e] [his] strong mitigating circumstance of lingering doubt and skew[] the jury\u2019s weighing process in the direction of death.\u201d\n\u201cError in admitting or excluding evidence at the penalty phase of a capital trial is reversible if there is a reasonable possibility it affected the verdict.\u201d (People v. Gay, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 1223.) In part II.B.L, ante, we found Miller\u2019s statements were not testimonial within the meaning of Crawford, supra, 541 U.S. 36, and that their admission was constitutionally permissible during the guilt trial. For the same reasons, the evidence was properly admitted at the penalty trial under factor (a) of section 190.3.\nAs discussed in part II.B.4., ante, we conclude Johnston\u2019s letter was erroneously admitted during the guilt phase but that the error was harmless. We also conclude the erroneous instruction under CALJIC NO. 2.71.5 for adoptive admissions did not compound the error or violate defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Admission of the letter and instruction during the penalty retrial was error for the reasons expressed above. The information in Johnston\u2019s letter, however, was conveyed through Johnston\u2019s own testimony, and it did not address defendant\u2019s role in the crime. Defendant\u2019s attorney argued to the jury that defendant was less culpable because he was not the actual shooter and did not intend to shoot the victim, but Johnston\u2019s letter neither accused defendant of intentionally shooting the clerk nor expressed knowledge of how the crimes were carried out. For these reasons, we conclude the error in admitting Johnston\u2019s letter had no reasonable possibility of affecting the penalty verdict. (People v. Pearson, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 472.)\n*1324Finally, in part II.B.6., ante, we concluded the trial court acted within its discretion in admitting the still photographs printed at Aerospace. Here, for the same reasons, the evidence was properly admitted at the penalty retrial under factor (a) of section 190.3.\n3. Exclusion of Evidence Explaining Why Defendant Shot Moon\nDefendant contends the trial court erred in excluding Marcia\u2019s statement to Detective Edwards during her interview that defendant told her he shot Moon only because Moon had gone for a gun. Defendant claims the evidence was admissible under Evidence Code section 356\u2019s rule of completeness because it related to other statements Marcia had made to Edwards that were admitted at trial.\na. Factual and Procedural Background\nOn direct examination, Detective Edwards testified Marcia gave him several accounts about when the group met and planned the robbery and what defendant had said during their meetings. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Edwards whether Marcia told him defendant said he shot the victim because the victim had reached for a gun. The prosecutor objected on hearsay grounds. At a sidebar, counsel argued the statement was admissible under the rule of completeness. The trial court sustained the hearsay objection.\nb. Discussion\nEvidence Code section 356 provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[wjhere part of [a] . . . conversation ... is given in evidence by one party, the whole on the same subject may be inquired into by an adverse party; . . . when a . . . conversation ... is given in evidence, any other act, declaration, conversation, or writing which is necessary to make it understood may also be given in evidence.\u201d \u201cThe purpose of Evidence Code section 356 is to avoid creating a misleading impression. [Citation.] It applies only to statements that have some bearing upon, or connection with, the portion of the conversation originally introduced. [Citation.] Statements pertaining to other matters may be excluded.\u201d (People v. Samuels (2005) 36 Cal.4th 96, 130 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 105, 113 P.3d 1125]; see People v. Zapien, supra, 4 Cal.4th at p. 959.)\nHere, defendant contends Marcia\u2019s statement to Detective Edwards that defendant said he shot the victim because Moon was reaching for a gun was admissible because it bore upon the statements Marcia made to Edwards that had already been admitted. However, at the time of counsel\u2019s objection, the relevant portion of the interview that had been elicited through Marcia\u2019s *1325testimony related solely to what she perceived during the planning of the robbery and the events leading to and immediately following the crimes. Marcia\u2019s statements did not suggest a reason for the shooting or refer to any other statements defendant may have made about the shooting. Nothing about what had been presented to the jury was misleading, and the excluded statement had no bearing on the portion of Marcia\u2019s interview that had been introduced into evidence. Accordingly, we conclude the trial court properly excluded Edward\u2019s proffered testimony regarding any statements by Marcia that purportedly explained why or how the victim had been shot.\n4. Victim Impact Evidence\nDefendant contends his penalty judgment must be reversed because the presentation of victim impact evidence, including a photo board displaying 17 photographs of the victim, was unduly prejudicial and rendered his trial fundamentally unfair.\nWe summarize the relevant victim impact evidence before addressing defendant\u2019s claim of prejudice.\nLos Angeles Police Officer Stephen Morris was married to victim Richard Moon\u2019s stepdaughter Maryann. Morris testified he met Richard Moon in 1986 and described him as the most generous person he ever met, crediting Moon with helping him graduate from the police academy. Morris learned of Moon\u2019s death while on duty. He broke down and cried, and his supervisor had to drive him home. Morris felt guilty because he was working blocks from Eddie\u2019s when Moon was shot, but he was not there to help. Morris observed that everything had turned \u201cupside-down\u201d for Moon\u2019s wife, Catherine, after the murder.\nMorris testified Moon loved life more than anyone he knew, and that Moon enjoyed spending time with his family. Morris identified many photographs on the photo board, including some of himself and his family. Some showed Moon with his wife in Hawaii. Others showed Moon with family members celebrating special occasions such as a graduation ceremony, dressed as Santa Claus, playing with children, posing with his granddaughter, and \u201cclowning around.\u201d One large photograph in the center of the board showed Moon smiling with his arms outstretched.\nJolene Watson, mother of Moon\u2019s grandson Christopher, considered Moon to be a good friend. Watson testified that she, Christopher, and Moon\u2019s son Billy were living with Moon and Catherine as a family when Moon was killed. After Watson learned of Moon\u2019s death, she informed Billy. Billy gave the news to his mother, whose reaction \u201cwas absolutely horrible.\u201d Watson identified a photograph that depicted Moon at Watson\u2019s high school graduation.\n*1326Catherine\u2019s daughter Maryann was Moon\u2019s stepdaughter, but Moon treated Maryann like his own child. Maryann described the moment she learned of Moon\u2019s death as the most painful thing that ever happened to her. She added, \u201c[t]here\u2019s just a big gap in our lives.\u201d She described her mother as very lonely and empty, and having \u201clost the sparkle in her eye.\u201d\n\u201cIn a capital trial, evidence showing the direct impact of the defendant\u2019s acts on the victims\u2019 friends and family is not barred by the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. (Payne v. Tennessee (1991) 501 U.S. 808, 825-827 [115 L.Ed.2d 720, 111 S.Ct. 2597].) Under California law, victim impact evidence is admissible at the penalty phase under section 190.3, factor (a), as a circumstance of the crime, provided the evidence is not so inflammatory as to elicit from the jury an irrational or emotional response untethered to the facts of the case.\u201d (People v. Pollock (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1153, 1180 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 34, 89 P.3d 353].)\nDefendant contends section 1191.117 limits the prosecution to a single victim impact witness at the penalty phase. The issue is forfeited because defendant failed to object on this ground in the trial court. (See People v. Kelly (2007) 42 Cal.4th 763, 793 [68 Cal.Rptr.3d 531, 171 P.3d 548] [failure to object to particular victim impact testimony forfeits issue on appeal]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 353, subd. (a).) Even if the issue were preserved, it would fail on its merits because \u201ca trial court has the discretionary power under section 1191.1 to hear witnesses who are not strictly victims.\u201d (People v. Brown (2003) 31 Cal.4th 518, 573, fn. 24 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 145, 73 P.3d 1137]; see People v. Zamudio (2008) 43 Cal.4th 327, 364-365 [75 Cal.Rptr.3d 289, 181 P.3d 105] [victim impact evidence not limited to testimony of a single witness]; People v. Pollock, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 1183 [victim impact evidence not limited to testimony of family members].) Defendant provides no persuasive reason to reconsider our prior decisions.\nNext, defendant contends the trial court erroneously admitted victim impact evidence that was far more extensive and prejudicial than the evidence held admissible in Payne v. Tennessee. To the contrary, the testimony of Morris, Watson, and Maryann was limited to explain the nature of their relationship with the victim, the immediate effects of the murder, and the *1327residual and continuing impact of the murder on their lives. (People v. Brown, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 398; see People v. Ervine (2009) 47 Cal.4th 745, 792 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d 786, 220 P.3d 820] [victim impact evidence may include the murder\u2019s effect on friends, coworkers, and the community].) Admission of Watson\u2019s testimony regarding the close relationship the victim had with his son Billy and the emotional impact of the victim\u2019s death on his grandson Christopher was not improper, even though neither of those family members testified. \u201cThere is no requirement that family members confine their testimony about the impact of the victim\u2019s death to themselves, omitting mention of other family members.\u201d (People v. Panah (2005) 35 Cal.4th 395, 495 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 672, 107 P.3d 790].) We also conclude the number of witnesses was not excessive. (See People v. Taylor (2010) 48 Cal.4th 574, 646 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 87, 229 P.3d 12] [proper to admit victim impact testimony of six family members representing four generations of victim\u2019s close family].)\nDefendant next contends admission of the prosecution\u2019s photo board was unduly prejudicial and rendered his trial fundamentally unfair.\nPhotographic evidence of the victim while alive is relevant and admissible as \u201cit portrays the victim as seen by the defendant before the murder.\u201d (People v. Anderson (2001) 25 Cal.4th 543, 594 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 575, 22 P.3d 347].) Here, there was nothing particularly inflammatory about the photographs that might have unfairly influenced the jurors. The prosecutor properly used them to convey that, as Morris, Watson, and Maryann had described, Moon had celebrated and enjoyed life to the fullest.\nDefendant objected at trial that one particular photograph was inadmissible because it depicted Moon in a \u201cJesus Christ[-like] pose,\u201d and was used as \u201cnothing but a sympathy ploy.\u201d The photograph depicts Moon by the water looking up while standing with his arms outstretched. That pose and others on the board that depict Moon with his arms outstretched were in keeping with Morris\u2019s description of Moon as one who outwardly expressed his joy for life. Although the challenged photograph was centered on the photo board and larger than the other photographs, the prosecutor placed no special emphasis on the challenged photograph nor did he attribute any religious significance to it. We conclude the challenged photograph was properly admitted as part of the photo board.\nDefendant contends the prejudicial effect of the photographs was established by the jury\u2019s request to view the photo board during the course of its one-day penalty phase deliberations. Although the request was denied, defendant argues \u201cthe request itself lays bare the raw emotion present in the jury room and the prejudicial effect\u201d of the photographs on display.\n*1328The record does not support the claim of prejudice. In refusing the jury\u2019s request to view the photographs during deliberations, the trial court limited the extent to which the photographs could emotionally affect the jurors, and defendant cites nothing in the record that suggests the photographs were so inflammatory that they prevented the jurors from making a rational penalty determination. Evidence presented at the penalty phase need not be devoid of emotional content. (People v. Lopez (2013) 56 Cal.4th 1028, 1078 [157 Cal.Rptr.3d 570, 301 P.3d 1177].) \u201cThe photographs admitted here, and the prosecutor\u2019s use of them in argument, assisted the jury in evaluating the consequences of defendant\u2019s crimes and they were not the type of \u2018irrelevant information or inflammatory rhetoric that diverts the jury\u2019s attention from its proper role or invites an irrational, purely subjective response.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Thomas, supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 825.)\nDefendant next contends that during rebuttal the prosecutor improperly asked the jury to base its penalty decision on a comparison of the virtues of the victim and defendant, by arguing, \u201cI\u2019m asking you to consider everything. But view Calvin Chism in the context of what he has done in his lifetime, and compare it to those circumstances in aggravation that have been offered to you for your consideration. Then reach an appropriate and truthful verdict.\u201d The prosecutor properly asked the jurors to \u201cconsider everything\u201d and \u201ccompare\u201d defendant\u2019s conduct throughout his life in light of all the aggravating evidence in deciding a penalty. There was no misconduct.\n5. Defendant\u2019s Proposed Jury Instructions\nDefendant claims the trial court erred in refusing to give certain special instructions requested by the defense. He contends their absence deprived him of federal and state constitutional rights to present a defense, to a fair and reliable capital trial, and to due process of law.\nDefendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction No. 52.16 stated: \u201cThe mitigating circumstances that I have read for your consideration are given to you merely as examples of some of the factors that you may take into account as reasons for deciding not to impose a death sentence in this case. You should pay careful attention to each of those factors. Anyone of them may be sufficient, standing alone, to support a decision that death is not the appropriate punishment in this case. But you should not limit your consideration of mitigating circumstances to these specific factors, [f] You may also consider any other circumstances relating to the case or to the defendant as shown by the evidence as reasons for not imposing the death penalty, [f] A mitigating circumstance does not have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to exist. You must find that a mitigating circumstance exists if there is any substantial evidence to support it. [][] Any mitigating circumstance presented to you may *1329outweigh all the aggravating factors. You are permitted to use mercy, sympathy, or sentiment in deciding what weight to give each mitigating factor.\u201d\nThe trial court properly rejected this instruction. Pursuant to CALJIC No. 8.85, the court instructed the jury it could consider, take into account, and be guided by, among other things, \u201c[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime and any sympathetic or other aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record that the defendant offers as a basis for a sentence less than death, whether or not related to the offense for which he is on trial.\u201d We have consistently held this instruction \u201cadequately instructs the jury concerning the circumstances that may be considered in mitigation, including sympathy and mercy.\u201d (People v. Burney (2009) 47 Cal.4th 203, 261 [97 Cal.Rptr.3d 348, 212 P.3d 639].)\nDefendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction No. 52.25 stated: \u201cThere is no requirement that all jurors unanimously agree on any matter offered in mitigation. Each juror must make an individual evaluation of each fact or circumstance offered in mitigation. Each juror must make his own individual assessment of the weight to be given such evidence. Each juror should weigh and consider such matters regardless of whether or not they are accepted by other jurors.\u201d\nWe have held the trial court is \u201cnot required to instruct [the jury] that unanimity is not required before a juror may consider evidence to be mitigating.\u201d (People v. Coddington (2000) 23 Cal.4th 529, 641 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 528, 2 P.3d 1081].) In addition, \u201cCALJIC No. 8.88 adequately advises jurors on the scope of their discretion to reject death and to return a verdict of life without possibility of parole.\u201d (People v. McKinnon (2011) 52 Cal.4th 610, 696 [130 Cal.Rptr.3d 590, 259 P.3d 1186].)18 The trial court did not err in refusing the proposed instruction.\n*1330Defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction No. 52.26 stated: \u201cThe aggravating factors that I have just listed for you may be considered by you, if applicable, and established by the evidence, in determining the penalty you will impose in this case. These factors that I have listed are the only ones that you may find to be aggravating factors and you cannot take into account any other facts or circumstances as a basis for imposing the penalty of death on the defendant.\u201d\nHere, \u201c[t]he court gave the standard sentencing instruction (see CALJIC No. 8.85), and we have held that instruction is proper despite its failure expressly to limit aggravating evidence to the enumerated statutory factors, and to exclude nonstatutory factors as a basis for the death penalty. [Citation.]\u201d (People v. Taylor (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1155, 1180 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 827, 34 P.3d 937].) The trial court properly refused to instruct the jury with proposed jury instruction No. 52.26.\nDefendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction No. 52.32 stated: \u201cThe law of California does not require that you ever vote to impose the penalty of death. After considering all of the evidence in the case and the instructions given to you by the court, it is entirely up to you to determine whether you are convinced that the death penalty is the appropriate punishment under all of the circumstances of the case.\u201d\nThe proposed instruction was duplicative of CALJIC Nos. 8.8419 and 8.88. \u201cCALJIC No. 8.84 informed the jurors in this case that state law required that a defendant found guilty of a special circumstance murder be punished by death or confinement in prison for life without the possibility of parole and that \u2018you must now determine which of these penalties shall now be imposed on the defendant.\u2019 (Italics added.) CALJIC No. 8.88 further advised the jurors that \u2018you determine under the relevant evidence which penalty is justified and appropriate. \u2019 \u201d (People v. McKinnon, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 694.) There is no requirement that the trial court must instruct the jury, pursuant to CALJIC No. 8.88, that \u201cdeath must be the appropriate penalty, *1331not just a warranted penalty.\u201d (People v. Moon (2005) 37 Cal.4th 1, 43 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 894, 117 P.3d 591].) The trial court properly rejected defendant\u2019s request to give proposed jury instruction No. 52.32.\nThe defense also asked the trial court to give proposed jury instructions Nos. 52.36, 52.39, and 52.39.1. Those proposed instructions would have told the jurors that \u201cyou must assume that the penalty that each of you chooses will in fact be carried out\u201d (No. 52.36), \u201c[l]ife without the possibility of parole means exactly what it says the defendant will be imprisoned for the rest of his life\u201d (No. 52.39), and \u201cyou must assume that a sentence of death means that the defendant will suffer the ultimate penalty and be executed (No. 52.39.1).\u201d However, \u201cbecause of the \u2018possibility of appellate reversal or gubernatorial commutation or pardon, it would be inaccurate and therefore erroneous to instruct the jury that if it returns a death verdict, the sentence of death will inexorably be carried out. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (People v. Wallace (2008) 44 Cal.4th 1032, 1091 [81 Cal.Rptr.3d 651, 189 P.3d 911].) \u201c[W]e have consistently held that the phrase \u2018life without possibility of parole\u2019 as it appears in CALJIC No. 8.84 adequately informs the jury that a defendant sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole is ineligible for parole. [Citations.] We also have held that the United States Supreme Court decisions in Kelly v. South Carolina (2002) 534 U.S. 246 [151 L.Ed.2d 670, 122 S.Ct. 726], Shafer v. South Carolina (2001) 532 U.S. 36 [149 L.Ed.2d 178, 121 S.Ct. 1263], and Simmons v. South Carolina (1994) 512 U.S. 154 [129 L.Ed.2d 133, 114 S.Ct. 2187], do nothing to alter that conclusion.\u201d (Ibid.) The trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s request to instruct the jury under defendant\u2019s proposed jury instructions Nos. 52.36, 52.39, and 52.39.1.\nDefendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction No. 52.38 stated: \u201cEvidence has been introduced in this case that may arouse in you a natural sympathy for the victim or the victim\u2019s family. [][] You must not allow such evidence to divert your attention from your proper role in deciding the appropriate punishment in this case. [][] You may not impose the penalty of death as a result of an irrational, purely emotional response to this evidence.\u201d\nIn People v. Zamudio, supra, 43 Cal.4th 327, we listed several reasons why the trial court properly refused to give a similar instruction proposed by the defense. Those reasons apply here as well. \u201cFirst, the substance of the requested instruction, insofar as it correctly stated the law, was adequately covered by the slightly modified version of CALJIC 8.84.1 the trial court gave;[20] \u2018[t]he proposed instruction would not have provided the jury with any information it had not otherwise learned from CALJIC *1332No. 8.84.1 . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] Second, the requested instruction is misleading to the extent it indicates that emotions may play no part in a juror\u2019s decision to opt for the death penalty. Although jurors must never be influenced by passion or prejudice, at the penalty phase, they \u2018may properly consider in aggravation, as a circumstance of the crime, the impact of a capital defendant\u2019s crimes on the victim\u2019s family, and in so doing [they] may exercise sympathy for the defendant\u2019s murder victims and . . . their bereaved family members. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Because the proposed instruction was misleading . . . , and because the point was adequately covered by the instructions that the court did give, the trial court acted correctly in refusing to use\u2019 the instruction defendant proposed. [Citation.]\u201d (People v. Zamudio, supra, 43 Cal.4th at pp. 368-369, fn. omitted.) The trial court properly rejected defendant\u2019s request that it instruct the jury with proposed jury instruction No. 52.38.\nWe conclude the trial court properly refused defendant\u2019s proposed instructions.\n6. Cumulative Error\nDefendant contends the cumulative effect of the asserted penalty phase errors requires reversal of his convictions and death sentence even if none of the errors individually compels reversal. We conclude any errors or assumed errors were not prejudicial, whether viewed separately or cumulatively.\n7. Attempted Robbery Felony-murder Special-circumstance Allegation\nDefendant was found death eligible based on the jury\u2019s true finding on the attempted robbery felony-murder special-circumstance allegation. He contends imposition of his death sentence violates international law and the Eighth Amendment\u2019s proportionality requirement, in the absence of a finding that he intended to kill the victim or exhibited reckless indifference to life as a major participant in the robbery. These claims have no merit.\n\u201cThe felony-based special circumstances do not require that the defendant intend to kill. It is sufficient if the defendant is the actual killer or either intends to kill or \u2018with reckless indifference to human life and as a major participant, aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, solicits, requests, or assists in the commission\u2019 of the felony. [Citations.]\u201d (People v. Rountree, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 854; see People v. Letner and Tobin, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 194 [rejecting argument that under Hopkins v. Reeves (1998) 524 U.S. 88, *133399 [141 L.Ed.2d 76, 118 S.Ct. 1895], the state must prove the actual killer had a culpable mental state].)\nImposition of the death penalty absent a finding of a culpable mental state for an actual killer does not violate international law because international law does not prohibit a sentence of death rendered in accordance with state and federal constitutional and statutory requirements. (See People v. Watkins (2012) 55 Cal.4th 999, 1034 [150 Cal.Rptr.3d 299, 290 P.3d 364]; People v. Taylor, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 661.)\nWe decline defendant\u2019s request to reconsider these prior holdings.\n8. Challenges to California\u2019s Death Penalty Law\nDefendant raises numerous challenges to California\u2019s death penalty law under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. We have consistently rejected each claim, and defendant offers no persuasive reason to reconsider our prior decisions.\n\u201cSection 190.2 is not impermissibly broad in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d (People v. Loker (2008) 44 Cal.4th 691, 755 [80 Cal.Rptr.3d 630, 188 P.3d 580].) \u201cThe sentencing factor of \u2018circumstances of the crime\u2019 (\u00a7 190.3, factor (a)) is not unconstitutionally vague and does not result in the arbitrary and capricious imposition of the death penalty.\u201d (People v.

Defendant\u2019s Prior Juvenile Adjudication for Assault with a Firearm\nAfter a court trial held prior to sentencing, defendant was found to have suffered a prior serious or violent felony conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement under the Three Strikes law. The trial court\u2019s finding was based on defendant\u2019s juvenile adjudication for assault with a firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (b)) for his involvement in the Arnold Park incident. Applying the second strike provision of the Three Strikes law, the court doubled defendant\u2019s sentence for the Riteway robbery. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d).)\nRelying on Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348], defendant contends the trial court improperly doubled his sentence for his conviction of the Riteway robbery in violation of his federal constitutional right because prior juvenile adjudications are not proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAfter defendant filed his opening brief, we decided in People v. Nguyen (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1007, 1028 [95 Cal.Rptr.3d 615, 209 P.3d 946], that \u201cthe absence of a constitutional or statutory right to jury trial under the juvenile law does not, under Apprendi, preclude the use of a prior juvenile adjudication of criminal misconduct to enhance the maximum sentence for a subsequent adult felony offense by the same person.\u201d We decline defendant\u2019s request to reconsider that decision.\n10. Imposition of Upper Terms on Counts Two and Three and the Firearm Enhancements on Counts One and Three\nCiting Cunningham v. California (2007) 549 U.S. 270 [166 L.Ed.2d 856, 127 S.Ct. 856], defendant contends the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial by erroneously sentencing him to upper terms for attempted robbery (count two) and second degree robbery (count three) and for the firearm enhancements imposed (former \u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)(1)) as to counts one (first degree murder) and three21 based on facts neither found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt nor admitted by defendant.\nIn imposing upper terms for counts two and three and the firearm enhancements as to counts one and three, the trial court said \u201cthe factors in *1335aggravation greatly outweigh those in mitigation\u201d and specifically found as follows: (1) all of the crimes involved great violence, the threat of great bodily injury, viciousness, and callousness; (2) both victims were particularly vulnerable given they were alone and unarmed; (3) defendant was in a position of leadership and induced Johnson to participate in the attempted robbery; (4) the manner in which the crimes were carried out reflected planning, sophistication, and professionalism; defendant \u201cha[d] an entourage that he . . . recruit[ed] to commit the robberies;\u201d before defendant entered the store, he sent someone inside to look for clerks and cameras; (5) a firearm was used in each robbery; (6) defendant engaged in violent conduct indicating a threat to society; and (7) defendant had recently been paroled.\n\u201cApprendi v. New Jersey[, supra,] 530 U.S. 466 . . . holds that, under the Sixth Amendment, \u2018any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citation.] In Blakely v. Washington (2004) 542 U.S. 296 [159 L.Ed.2d 403, 124 S.Ct. 2531], the high court extended the scope of Apprendi by defining \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 as the \u2018maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u2019 [Citations.] Applying Blakely, the court later held in Cunningham v. California, supra, 549 U.S. 270, that California\u2019s determinate sentencing law did not comport with a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment jury trial right. As Cunningham explained, \u2018If the jury\u2019s verdict alone does not authorize the sentence, if, instead, the judge must find an additional fact to impose the longer term, the Sixth Amendment requirement is not satisfied.\u2019 (Cunningham, at p. 290.) Because the aggravating circumstances necessary for imposition of an upper term \u2018depend on facts found discretely and solely by the judge\u2019 (id. at p. 288), the \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 prescribed in California\u2019s sentencing scheme is not the upper term but rather the middle term (ibid.).\u201d (People v. Myles (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1181, 1220 [139 Cal.Rptr.3d 786, 274 P.3d 413].)\nIn People v. Black (2007) 41 Cal.4th 799 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 569, 161 P.3d 1130], we explained that \u201cthe imposition of the upper term does not infringe upon the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to jury trial so long as one legally sufficient aggravating circumstance has been found to exist by the jury, has been admitted by the defendant, or is justified based upon the defendant\u2019s record of prior convictions.\u201d (Id. at p. 816.) This exception \u201cinclude[s] not only the fact that a prior conviction occurred, but also other related issues that may be determined by examining the records of the prior convictions.\u201d (Id. at p. 819.) For example, the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s prior convictions were \u201c \u2018numerous or of increasing seriousness\u2019 \u201d falls within this exception for a defendant\u2019s recidivism. (Id. at pp. 818-819; see id. at p. 820.) \u201cThe determinations whether a defendant has suffered prior convictions, and whether those convictions are \u2018numerous or of *1336increasing seriousness\u2019 (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.421(b)(2)), require consideration of only the number, dates, and offenses of the prior convictions alleged. The relative seriousness of these alleged convictions may be determined simply by reference to the range of punishment provided by statute for each offense. This type of determination is \u2018quite different from the resolution of the issues submitted to a jury, and is one more typically and appropriately undertaken by a court.\u2019 \u201d (Id. at pp. 819-820.)\nIn People v. Towne (2008) 44 Cal.4th 63, 80-81 [78 Cal.Rptr.3d 530, 186 P.3d 10], we held that imposition of an upper term based on the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant was on probation or parole at the time the offense was committed did not violate the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under Cunningham. Similarly, in this case the trial court\u2019s reliance on its finding that defendant had recently been paroled to impose the upper terms on counts two and three and the firearm enhancements imposed under former section 12022.5, subdivision (a)(1), on counts one and three, was permissible under Cunningham. (See People v. Moberly (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 1191, 1198 [98 Cal.Rptr.3d 434] [\u201cthe dual use of a fact or facts to aggravate both a base term and the sentence on an enhancement is not prohibited\u201d]; People v. Price (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 803, 812 &amp; fn. 5 [199 Cal.Rptr. 99] [\u201ca trial court may use the same fact(s) to impose more than one aggravated term provided the fact is reasonably related to the particular count . . .\u201d and \u201cthe fact has not already been or will not be used to impose either an enhancement or a consecutive term\u201d].) Accordingly, defendant was not deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under Cunningham.\n11. Conduct Credits\nAt sentencing, the trial court awarded defendant 643 days of custody credits. Defendant contends the trial court erroneously relied on section 2933.2 to deny him any presentence conduct credits.\nSubdivision (a) of section 2933.2 prohibits any person convicted of murder from accruing any presentence conduct or worktime credit. However, the statute applies only to offenses committed after its effective date of June 3, 1998. (\u00a7 2933.2, subd. (d), as approved by voters (Prop. 222) June 2, 1998; see People v. Hutchins (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1317 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 643]). Because defendant committed his crimes on June 12, 1997, any good time or worktime credits are governed by former section 4019, which provided that a defendant convicted of a crime enumerated in section 667.5 will receive one day of conduct credit for each six-day period of confinement during which he complies with the rules and regulations of the facility. (Former \u00a7 4019, subds. (a)(1), (c), (f), as amended by Stats. 1982, ch. 1234, \u00a7 7, p. 4553.)  Under section 2933.1, subdivision (c), however, \u201cthe *1337maximum credit that may be earned against a period of confinement in, or commitment to, a county jail . . . following arrest and prior to placement in the custody of the Director of Corrections, shall not exceed 15 percent of the actual period of confinement for any person specified in subdivision (a).\u201d Subdivision (a) of that statute, which imposes a limitation on the number of worktime credits that may be awarded (an issue not relevant here), applies to \u201cany person who is convicted of a felony offense listed in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5.\u201d (\u00a7 2933.1, subd. (a).)\nDefendant\u2019s convictions for murder and attempted robbery are listed under section 667.5, subdivision (c)(1) (murder) and (9) (robbery) and thus he is a person specified in subdivision (a) of section 2933.1. Therefore, the combined total of defendant\u2019s presentence conduct credits awarded under former section 4019 may not exceed 15 percent of his actual period of confinement. (\u00a7 2933.1, subd. (c); People v. Palacios (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 252, 258 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 318].) Accordingly, defendant is entitled to 96 days of conduct credit (15 percent of 643 presentence days of confinement). (Former \u00a7 4019, subds. (a)(1), (c), (f).)\nm. DISPOSITION\nDefendant is entitled to 96 days of conduct credit under former section 4019, subdivisions (a)(1), (c), (f). The superior court is directed to modify the abstract of judgment to reflect that defendant is entitled to 96 days of conduct credit. (\u00a7 2933.1, subd. (c).) In all other respects, including the verdict of death, the judgment is affirmed.\nCantil-Sakauye, C. J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., and Corrigan, J., concurred.\n\n All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.\n\n\n Marcus Johnson and Samuel Taylor were tried with defendant for their involvement in the murder and attempted robbery of Moon. Each was convicted of first degree murder with an attempted robbery special circumstance, and each was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.\n\n\n All calendar references are to 1997 unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n Codefendant Johnson, his sister, and an unrelated witness share the same last name. To simplify our discussion of the facts and the law, we shall refer to codefendant Johnson as Johnson, and we refer to Johnson\u2019s sister Marcia and witness Stephanie Johnson by first name.\n\n\n Marcia testified pursuant to a plea agreement with the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office that provided she would serve a 12-year sentence for her involvement in the crimes that occurred at Eddie\u2019s in exchange for her truthful testimony.\n\n\n Wallace testified she loaned the van to Taylor in June 1997, but she did not recall the date. She said she was truthful when she spoke with Sergeant Reynolds on June 19. Reynolds testified Wallace told him she loaned the van to Taylor about 1:30 p.m. on June 12, and that he returned it about 4:30 p.m. that same day.\n\n\n Miller refused to testify at trial. His observations and statements regarding the attempted robbery and murder at Eddie\u2019s were admitted over a defense objection through the testimony of the police officer who interviewed him shortly after Moon was murdered.\n\n\n Although Crawford was decided after defendant\u2019s trial, while his appeal was pending, the high court\u2019s ruling applies retroactively to his case. (People v. Cage (2007) 40 Cal.4th 965, 974, fn. 4 [56 Cal.Rptr.3d 789, 155 P.3d 205].) Moreover, because defendant\u2019s counsel could not have anticipated Crawford\u2019s sweeping changes to federal confrontation clause case law, he did not forfeit this claim by failing to object to the admission of Miller\u2019s statements on federal constitutional grounds. (People v. Pearson (2013) 56 Cal.4th 393, 461-462 [154 Cal.Rptr.3d 541, 297 P.3d 793].)\n\n\n Here, and in most other claims, defendant contends the asserted error violated various of his state and federal constitutional rights. \u201cIn most instances, insofar as defendant raised the issue at all in the trial court, he failed explicitly to make some or all of the constitutional arguments he now advances. In each instance, unless otherwise indicated, it appears that either (1) the appellate claim is of a kind (e.g., failure to instruct sua sponte; erroneous instruction affecting defendant\u2019s substantial rights) that required no trial court action by the defendant to preserve it, or (2) the new arguments do not invoke facts or legal standards different from those the trial court itself was asked to apply, but merely assert that the trial court\u2019s act or omission, insofar as wrong for the reasons actually presented to that court, had the additional legal consequence of violating the Constitution. To that extent, defendant\u2019s new constitutional arguments are not forfeited on appeal. [Citations.] H] In the latter instance, of course, rejection, on the merits, of a claim that the trial court erred on the issue actually before that court necessarily leads to rejection of the newly applied constitutional \u2018gloss\u2019 as well. No separate constitutional discussion is required in such cases, and we therefore provide none.\u201d (People v. Boyer (2006) 38 Cal.4th 412, 441, fn. 17 [42 Cal.Rptr.3d 677, 133 P.3d 581].)\n\n\n Section 1235 of the Evidence Code provides: \u201cEvidence of a statement made by a witness is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement is inconsistent with his testimony at the hearing and is offered in compliance with Section 770.\u201d Evidence Code section 770 provides: \u201cUnless the interests of justice otherwise require, extrinsic evidence of a statement made by a witness that is inconsistent with any part of his testimony at the hearing shall be excluded unless: [jQ (a) The witness was so examined while testifying as to give him an *1295opportunity to explain or to deny the statement; or [][] (b) The witness has not been excused from giving further testimony in the action.\u201d\n\n\n Marcia\u2019s hearsay statement to Edwards consisted of double hearsay because it also included an out-of-court statement by defendant offered for its truth. Defendant\u2019s statement was admissible because it qualified under the hearsay exception for a party admission (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1220). (See People v. Williams (1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 199-200, fn. 3 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 123, 940 P.2d 710] [multiple hearsay is admissible provided that each hearsay level falls within a hearsay exception].)\n\n\n Although our theory of admissibility differs from that of the trial court, \u201cwe review the ruling, not the court\u2019s reasoning, and, if the ruling was correct on any ground, we affirm.\u201d (People v. Geier (2007) 41 Cal.4th 555, 582 [61 Cal.Rptr.3d 580, 161 P.3d 104].)\n\n\n We need not discuss the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling that the Riteway robbery was also admissible on the liquor store charges on the issue of knowledge. Assuming any error in that regard, we note that \u201c \u2018 \u201ca ruling or decision, itself correct in law, will not be disturbed on appeal merely because given for a wrong reason.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Zapien (1993) 4 Cal.4th 929, 976 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 122, 846 P.2d 704].) That is, because as we explain below, the trial court did not err in ruling the evidence was admissible on the issue of intent, its additional ruling that the evidence was admissible on the issue of knowledge is of no consequence.\n\n\n Although defendant cited only Wheeler when making his motions, on appeal a Wheeler motion is treated as a motion under Wheeler and Batson. (People v. Yeoman (2003) 31 Cal.4th 93, 117-118 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 186, 72 P.3d 1166].) We refer to the defense motions as Batson/Wheeler motions throughout this opinion.\n\n\n Because we find the trial court did not err by denying either of defendant\u2019s Batson/Wheeler motions, we reject defendant\u2019s boilerplate claims of violations of various other state and federal constitutional rights. (See People v. Roldan (2005) 35 Cal.4th 646, 703 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 360, 110 P.3d 289]; People v. Yeoman, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 118.)\n\n\n Further jury selection proceedings were held prior to commencement of the penalty trial after two alternate jurors were excused, one for medical reasons and the other due to a death in the family. Defendant does not support his claim with statistical evidence from those proceedings nor does he complain about the circumstances under which the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge during those proceedings.\n\n\n In relevant part, section 1191.1 reads as follows: \u201c[T]he next of kin of the victim if the victim has died . . . have the right to attend all sentencing proceedings under this chapter .... [ID The victim, or up to two of the victim\u2019s parents or guardians if the victim is a minor, or the next of kin of the victim if the victim has died, have the right to appear, personally or by counsel, at the sentencing proceeding and to reasonably express his, her, or their views concerning the crime, the person responsible, and the need for restitution. The court in imposing sentence shall consider the statements of victims, parents or guardians, and next of kin made pursuant to this section and shall state on the record its conclusion concerning whether the person would pose a threat to public safety if granted probation.\u201d\n\n\n The trial court instructed the jury under CALJIC No. 8.88, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cAfter having heard all of the evidence, and after having heard and considered the arguments of counsel, you shall consider, take into account, and be guided by the applicable factors of aggravating and mitigating circumstances upon which you have been instructed. fi[] An aggravating factor is any fact, condition or event attending the commission of a crime which increases its guilt or enormity, or adds to its injurious consequences which is above and beyond the elements of the crime itself. [|] A mitigating circumstance is any fact, condition or event which does not constitute a justification or excuse for the crime in question, but may be considered as an extenuating circumstance in determining the appropriateness of the death penalty. Q] The weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances does not mean a mere mechanical counting of factors on each side of an imaginary scale, or the arbitrary assignments of weights to any of them, [f] You are free to assign whatever moral or sympathetic value you deem appropriate to each and all of the various factors you are permitted to consider. [1] In *1330weighing the various circumstances you determine under the relevant evidence which penalty is justified and appropriate by considering the totality of the aggravating circumstances with the totality of the mitigating circumstances. [SO To return a judgment of death, each of you must be persuaded that the aggravating circumstances are so substantial in comparison with the mitigating circumstances that it warrants death instead of life without parole.\u201d\n\n\n Pursuant to CALJIC No. 8.84, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he defendant in this case has been found guilty of murder of the first degree. The allegation [that the] murder was committed under a special circumstance has been specially found to be true. It is the law of this state that the penalty for a defendant found guilty of murder in the first degree shall be death, or a confinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole, in any case in which the special circumstance alleged in this case has been specially found to be true. Under the law of this state, you must now determine which of these penalties shall be imposed on the defendant.\u201d\n\n\n The court instructed with CALJIC No. 8.84.1, which, as relevant here, told the jurors \u201c[y]ou must neither be influenced by bias, nor prejudice against the defendant, nor be swayed by public opinion or public feelings. Both the People and the defendant have a right to expect *1332that you will consider all of the evidence, follow the law, exercise your discretion conscientiously, and reach a just verdict.\u201d\n\n\n The trial court stayed defendant\u2019s sentence on count two.\n\n",

But I disagree with the majority\u2019s rejection of defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred when it applied the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d)) to double his five-year sentence for robbery. (See maj. opn., ante, at p. 1334.)\nDefendant argues that because his prior \u201cstrike\u201d was an adjudication in juvenile court, as to which he had no right to trial by jury, the federal Constitution\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial barred the trial court from using the prior juvenile adjudication to double his sentence for robbery. The majority disagrees, relying on this court\u2019s previous rejection of a similar claim in People v. Nguyen (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1007 [95 Cal.Rptr.3d 615, 209 P.3d 946] (Nguyen).\n*1338I dissented in Nguyen. As my dissent explained, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to a jury trial does not permit a trial court to impose additional punishment that is based on prior juvenile criminal conduct for which there was no right to a jury trial.\u201d (Nguyen, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 1034 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) Thus, the trial court here erred in using defendant\u2019s prior juvenile adjudication to double defendant\u2019s sentence for robbery. Therefore, I would direct the clerk of the superior court to modify the judgment by dismissing defendant\u2019s prior \u201cstrike\u201d and by reducing his robbery sentence to an undoubled term of five years.\n\nRetired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.\n\n",

At the first penalty phase, the jury hung 10 to two in favor of death. It is undisputed that the two holdouts were black women. In selecting the second penalty phase jury, the prosecutor exercised peremptory strikes against the first two black jurors available for challenge. When defendant challenged both strikes as racially motivated (see Batson v. Kentucky (1986) 476 U.S. 79 [90 L.Ed.2d 69, 106 S.Ct. 1712] (Batson); People v. Wheeler (1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748] (Wheeler)), the prosecutor gave reasons for each strike. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motions, and this court now upholds the trial court\u2019s rulings.\nToday\u2019s opinion marks the second time in 12 months that this court has rejected a claim of improper discrimination in jury selection despite indications in the record that the strike of a black female juror was substantially motivated by discriminatory intent. (See People v. Williams (2013) 56 Cal.4th 630, 698-699 [156 Cal.Rptr.3d 214, 299 P.3d 1185] (dis. opn. of Werdegar, J.) [\u201cas to at least two African-American women called as prospective jurors, the prosecutor engaged in purposeful discrimination in exercising his challenges . . .\u201d]; id. at p. 718 (dis. opn. of Liu, J.) [same].)\nProspective Juror J.S., the second black juror struck by the prosecutor, was a telephone circuit designer who worked her way up from a clerk position over a 30-year career at Pacific Bell. For the past 20 years, she had trained others on how to design circuits. She had two adult children as well as a 12 year old. She had previously served on a jury in a criminal case and in a civil case, both of which reached a verdict. At voir dire, she said she would be willing to vote for either death or life without parole, and that her decision would depend on the evidence. She said she would be willing to express her views and would be open to listening to others. She repeatedly said she would be willing to vote for the death penalty in an appropriate case.\nIn striking this juror, the prosecutor gave two reasons related to decision-making ability: (1) lack of supervisory experience in the workplace and (2) *1339lack of experience handling stressful situations in life. The record reveals no support for the second reason, and the trial court refused a defense request to reopen voir dire specifically to examine whether J.S. had dealt with stressful situations in her life. As to the first reason, the record does not support the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of J.S.\u2019s position at Pacific Bell, and at least three seated white jurors had no supervisory role in their current jobs. Considering all relevant circumstances in the record before us, I find it difficult to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s strike of J.S. was not motivated in substantial part by improper discrimination. Accordingly, I dissent from that aspect of today\u2019s decision.\nI.\nIn Snyder v. Louisiana (2008) 552 U.S. 472 [170 L.Ed.2d 175, 128 S.Ct. 1203] (Snyder), the high court made clear that \u201c \u2018[t]he Constitution forbids striking even a single prospective juror for a discriminatory purpose ....\u2019\u201d (Id. at p. 478.) Snyder, a capital case, focused on the strike of a single black juror, Jeffrey Brooks, whom the prosecutor described (1) as having a \u201c \u2018nervous\u2019 \u201d demeanor and (2) as possibly prone to convict the defendant of a lesser crime, thus avoiding a penalty phase, in order \u201c \u2018to go home quickly\u2019 \u201d and fulfill his obligations as a student teacher. (Ibid.) The high court refused to credit the first reason because \u201cthe record [did] not show that the trial judge actually made a determination concerning Mr. Brooks\u2019 demeanor.\u201d (Id. at p. 479.)\nAs to the second reason, Snyder concluded that it \u201cfails even under the highly deferential standard\u201d applicable on habeas corpus review. (Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at p. 479; see id. at p. 478 [applying \u201cclear error\u201d standard].) The high court said the possibility that Mr. Brooks would vote to convict on a lesser offense in order to end the case quickly was \u201chighly speculative.\u201d (Id. at p. 482.) Further, the court found the strike \u201csuspicious\u201d because \u201cthe prosecutor anticipated on the record during voir dire\u201d that the trial would be brief, because \u201cMr. Brooks\u2019 dean promised to \u2018work with\u2019 Mr. Brooks to see that he was able to make up any student-teaching time that he missed due to jury service,\u201d and because \u201cthe trial occurred relatively early in the fall semester,\u201d thus giving Mr. Brooks \u201cmany weeks\u201d to make up any lost teaching time. (Id. at pp. 482-483.) Finally, the court said \u201c[t]he implausibility of this explanation is reinforced by the prosecutor\u2019s acceptance of white jurors who disclosed conflicting obligations that appear to have been at least as serious as Mr. Brooks\u2019.\u201d (Id. at p. 483; see id. at p. 484 [comparing Mr. Brooks to two white jurors with \u201curgent\u201d or \u201cmore pressing\u201d work or family obligations].) In light of these circumstances, Snyder concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s strike of Mr. Brooks was \u201cmotivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.\u201d (Id. at p. 485.)\n*1340As explained below, the prosecutor\u2019s strike of J.S. in this case is no less suspicious than the strike of Mr. Brooks in Snyder.\nA.\nDuring voir dire on March 5, 2001, Prospective Juror J.S. introduced herself as a telephone circuit designer for Pacific Bell. She had graduated from high school and attended two years of college, studying business administration. While in school, she did clerical work at the Los Angeles County \u201cDepartment of Justice\u201d or \u201cDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d At the time of voir dire, she had worked for Pacific Bell for 30 years, initially as \u201ca clerk for awhile, and then I moved on up.\u201d When asked whether she \u201cever supervised any employees,\u201d J.S. said, \u201cNo. I do a lot of training.\u201d J.S. proceeded to explain that for about 20 years, she had been training others on how to design circuits on a computer.\nJ.S. had previously served on a jury in a criminal trial and in a civil trial. In both instances, the jury reached a verdict. The criminal case concerned child molestation, and the civil case involved personal injuries. J.S. was divorced; her former husband was a plumber. She had two adult sons and a 12-year-old son, as well as three grandchildren.\nOn March 2, 2001, the court had asked J.S. about her views on the death penalty. J.S. said she would neither automatically vote for death nor automatically vote against death. When the court asked for her \u201cgeneral views on the death penalty,\u201d J.S. said, \u201cI would have to hear the evidence.\u201d The court then asked, \u201cSo if you heard the evidence, and you were instructed on the law, if you were convinced that death was the appropriate penalty, you could vote for that?\u201d J.S. replied, \u201cYes.\u201d The court also asked, \u201cIf you were convinced that life without parole was appropriate, could you vote for that?\u201d J.S. replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\nOn March 5, 2001, in response to questions from the prosecutor, J.S. said she understood she would have to weigh each piece of evidence, to decide whether it was aggravating or mitigating, and to choose the appropriate penalty. At that point, the prosecutor asked, \u201cWith all that in mind, and understanding that before you\u2019re asked to exercise your choice you will be presented evidence, do you feel that you would always choose life over death?\u201d J.S. replied, \u201cNo.\u201d The prosecutor then asked, \u201cDo you feel the other way, that you would always choose death over life?\u201d J.S. said, \u201cNo.\u201d The voir dire continued; \u201c[Prosecutor]: At this juncture, are you prepared, if in your mind you think death is an appropriate penalty, to come back with a verdict of death? [f] [J.S.]: Yes. [][] [Prosecutor]: You understand that\u2019s what would be required if you think death is appropriate? [][] [J.S.]: Yes. [f] [Prosecutor]: You can do that? [][] [J.S.]: Yes.\u201d\n*1341J.S. then gave the following answers to questions from defense counsel and the court: \u201c[Defense counsel]: . . . [Y]ou can assure us that you will express your views and listen to others, right? [][] [J.S.]: Yes. . . . [ft] [Defense counsel]: In other words, if you have an opinion and the a [sic] majority disagrees with you, you will state your opinion? [ft] You won\u2019t be a shrinking violet? [][] [J.S.]: No. [ft] [The Court]: You are not going to change your mind to accommodate some other people, are you? [f] [J.S.]: No. [ft] [Defense counsel]: By the same token, if you listen to them, you do believe that you might be right\u2014you will be open to listening to them? [ft] [J.S.]: Yes. [ft] [Defense counsel]: And you understand that the final ultimate decision on your vote is your measuring stick, your opinion? [ft] [J.S.]: Yes. [1] [Defense counsel]: Both sides are entitled to that, correct? [ft] [J.S.]: Yes.\u201d\nThe prosecutor exercised her fourth peremptory challenge against F.J., the first black juror available for challenge, and the trial court denied defendant\u2019s Batson motion. On March 6, 2001, after the parties exercised additional strikes, the prosecutor struck J.S., who was the second black juror available for challenge. Defense counsel again objected. At sidebar, defense counsel observed that J.S. \u201cseemed like an idea [szc] juror. She had two priors, both\u2014one civil, one criminal. There was a verdict. She has worked for many, many, many years at Pacific Bell. Worked her way up. She supervised people. She trains. She obviously can make decisions. She worked\u2014-and just otherwise seems to be a good juror, [ft] I can\u2019t see any reason why the district attorney would not accept her, other than the fact she is a black female, [ft] And I would note that the last jury which hung, the two hangs were black females. But that should not be a basis.\u201d\nThe court responded: \u201cOf course, [the prosecutor] has relied on life\u2019s experience criteria in the past, [ft] . . . [ft] This juror has trained people. I don\u2019t recall that she supervised anybody. I believe she has trained people on how to use the computer design circuits.\u201d\nThe prosecutor responded: \u201cMy recollection is that she specifically said she did not supervise anybody, [ft] From what I can glean from her job assignment is she\u2019s got a very fancy, but misleading, job description, which she is basically, from my understanding, she is into data entry. She makes no decisions. She is given specifications and she inputs that information into a computer. She is basically a more sophisticated form of a filing clerk. And, basically, she\u2019s held nothing but clerk positions. She has trained individuals in terms of inputting data. She is a data entry specialist, basically.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the fact she trains people in how they input data makes her specifically qualified for high-stress decision-making jobs. And that\u2019s basically what this is. This is going to be a very stressful, deliberative process. It *1342also requires individuals who are seasoned decision makers. They could handle the stress of a tough decision. [ft] . . . [ft]\n\u201cI\u2019ve looked at her job description. She has basically been in clerk positions. If I were to not kick her, it seems to me that it would only be because she is an African American. And I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019m going to discriminate in one direction or the other. I\u2019m not going to keep her simply because she is African American. I have confidence in the fact that good people with experience can be fair to an African American male.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that it is essential that an African American sit on the jury. I think it would be wonderful if we can find individuals who I feel are seasoned decision makers who can handle the stress of the situation. But there\u2019s absolutely nothing about her background that tells me that she can operate in a high-stress situation. And that\u2019s very important in this type of case where the issue is life and death. It\u2019s going to be extremely stressful.\u201d\nAt that point, the trial court said: \u201cThe D.A.\u2019s comments have been non-solicited. I asked a prima facie showing, that prima facie showing has not been made.\u201d Defense counsel disputed the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of J.S.\u2019s work experience and explained that J.S.\u2019s long work history, experience as a trainer, and middle age (\u201cshe is at least in her 50s, probably older\u201d) would make her a good juror. The court said, \u201cHer position in the Department of Justice was filing,\u201d and then added, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t necessary [sic] agree or disagree with the criteria that the D.A. is using as far as whether I would if I were a D.A., but that\u2019s a non-race based criteria. And her use of the peremptory as to this juror was consistent with that non-suspect category use.\u201d\nAfter further argument by defense counsel, the prosecutor said, \u201cBut I want to add that it\u2019s not just supervisory positions that I look for. I look for how they handled stressful situations or incidences in their life.\u201d Defense counsel then asked, \u201cMay I inquire, this Juror was asked whether or not she has ever had to deal with stress in her life, specifically?\u201d The court responded, \u201cI don\u2019t recall that specific question. But there were questions about her life.\u201d At that point, defense counsel said, \u201cThere would be a request to reopen general voir dire on behalf of Mr. Chism so we can explore that possibility with [J.S.].\u201d The prosecutor objected and, without disputing that J.S. had not been asked about stressful life experiences, said, \u201cHow a person deals with stress and how they recognize it as stress will vary from individual to individual. I know what I go on; their ability to deal with stress is one of the things I look at, including their ability to make decisions.\u201d Without further analysis, the court said, \u201cThe voir dire was appropriately conducted. The request is denied.\u201d\n*1343The only other identified black woman on the panel, M.G., was excused for cause because she said she would never impose the death penalty. In the end, the jury that made the penalty decision consisted of 11 white jurors and one black man, A.D., who was a former correctional officer and current correctional counselor with the federal Bureau of Prisons. A.D. had served on three juries, all of which reached a verdict. During his voir dire, the court said, \u201cAnd I take it if there is a disturbance in the institution, it\u2019s a stressful situation,\u201d and asked whether A.D. \u201cdeal[t] with stress every day in [his] life.\u201d A.D. answered in the affirmative. A.D. also noted that he was the union president, that he had had law enforcement and weapons training, and that he had friends in most law enforcement agencies.\nB.\nAlthough the trial court found no prima facie case of discrimination in denying defendant\u2019s Batson motion with respect to J.S., today\u2019s opinion properly concludes that \u201cthe trial court ruled ultimately that the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons were genuine and race neutral, and therefore ... the question whether defendant made a prima facie showing of racial discrimination is rendered moot.\u201d (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1314.) The question before us is whether an examination of \u201call of the circumstances\u201d bearing on the prosecutor\u2019s strike of J.S. reveals purposeful discrimination. {Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at p. 478.) For several reasons, I believe it does.\nFirst, the prosecutor struck J.S., a black juror, in a capital penalty trial where defendant was a black man convicted of murdering a white victim. We have noted the obvious relevance of this racial dynamic, as has the high court. (See People v. Taylor (2010) 48 Cal.4th 574, 608 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 87, 229 P.3d 12] [\u201c \u2018[Ajdequate inquiry into possible racial bias is . . . essential in a case in which an African-American defendant is charged with commission of a capital crime against a White victim.\u2019 (People v. Holt (1997) 15 Cal.4th 619, 660 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 782, 937 P.2d 213]; see also Mu\u2019min v. Virginia (1991) 500 U.S. 415, 424 [114 L.Ed.2d 493, 111 S.Ct. 1899]....)\u201d]; Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 281 [\u201c[T]he defendant need not be a member of the excluded group in order to complain of a violation of the representative cross-section rule; yet if he is, and especially if in addition his alleged victim is a member of the group to which the majority of the remaining jurors belong, these facts may also be called to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d]; Powers v. Ohio (1991) 499 U.S. 400, 416 [113 L.Ed.2d 411, 111 S.Ct. 1364] [\u201cRacial identity between the defendant and the excused person might in some cases be the explanation for the prosecution\u2019s adoption of the forbidden stereotype, and if the alleged race bias takes this form, it may provide one of the easier cases to establish both a prima facie case and a conclusive showing that wrongful discrimination has occurred.\u201d].)\n*1344Second, in objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s strike of J.S., defense counsel observed that the first penalty phase jury hung because two black female jurors refused to vote for death. On appeal, defendant quoted this observation in his briefing and mentioned it repeatedly at oral argument. The accuracy of the observation was never disputed by the prosecutor, the trial court, or the Attorney General on appeal. Moreover, neither the prosecutor, the trial court, nor the Attorney General ever disputed the prosecutor\u2019s awareness that the two holdouts were black women. Plainly, the uncontested observation that two black female jurors refused to vote for death in the first penalty trial heightens the possibility that improper discrimination informed the prosecutor\u2019s strike of J.S., the only death-qualified black woman on the panel.\nThird, although today\u2019s opinion says \u201cthe fact that the jury included an African-American \u2018is an indication of good faith [by the prosecutor] in exercising peremptories\u2019 \u201d (maj. opn., ante, at p. 1316), I am doubtful that much can be inferred from the prosecutor\u2019s failure to strike seated Juror A.D., a correctional counselor with strong professional and personal ties to law enforcement. Given A.D.\u2019s background, it would have been odd and clearly suspicious for the prosecutor to strike A.D.\nFourth, and most importantly, a review of the record casts doubt on the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for striking J.S. In explaining the strike, the prosecutor took the view that a capital sentencing proceeding \u201crequires individuals who are seasoned decision makers.\u201d The prosecutor said that in selecting \u201cindividuals who I feel are seasoned decision makers who can handle the stress of the situation,\u201d she considered two indicators: (1) \u201csupervisory positions\u201d in employment and (2) \u201chow they handled stressful situations or incidences in their life.\u201d According to the prosecutor, these were the criteria that motivated her to strike J.S. These reasons thus comprise the sole focus of our review. (See Miller-El v. Dretke (2005) 545 U.S. 231, 252 [162 L.Ed.2d 196, 125 S.Ct. 2317] (Miller-El) [\u201c[W]hen illegitimate grounds like race are in issue, a prosecutor simply has got to state his reasons as best he can and stand or fall on the plausibility of the reasons he gives. A Batson challenge does not call for a mere exercise in thinking up any rational basis. If the stated reason does not hold up, its pretextual significance does not fade because a trial judge, or an appeals court, can imagine a reason that might not have been shown up as false.\u201d].)\nAs to the first criterion, it is true that J.S. said during voir dire that she had not supervised any employees. The prosecutor was entitled to rely on this criterion as long as she applied it evenhandedly to all jurors, regardless of race. However, at least two white jurors, L.F. and K.K., who were already empaneled at the time the prosecutor struck J.S., also had no supervisory experience, and a third seated white juror, W.B., had no supervisory role in his current job and only a minor supervisory role in a previous job.\n*1345L.F. was an administrative assistant at Boeing who handled workers\u2019 compensation and medical claims. During voir dire, the prosecutor asked L.F. about her job, as follows:\n\u201c[The prosecutor]: You make decisions as to whether or not claims will be approved or rejected?\n\u201c[L.F.]: No, ma\u2019am.\n\u201c[The prosecutor]: What is [sic] your job duties with respect to that?\n\u201c[L.F.]: Pm a buffer between the injured worker and the insurance carrier. I do a lot of problem solving to eliminate that.\n\u201c[The prosecutor]: Your [sic] a facilitator?\n\u201c[L.F.]: Yes, uh-huh.\n\u201c[The prosecutor]: How long have you been engaged in that particular job assignment?\n\u201c[L.F.]: Probably off and on about 20 years at Boeing. [][] ...[!]\n\u201c[The prosecutor]: Do you work with other individuals on your job?\n\u201c[L.F.]: Yes.\n\u201c[The prosecutor]: Can you tell me about that?\n\u201c[L.F.]: We have workers\u2019 comp and the leave of absence are in the same area. And so there is cross-training, [f] I have no decision making in what I do, but I can consult, of course, with other people on decisions to be made.\u201d\n\u201c[The prosecutor]: Okay. [][] So if a problem arises that requires a decision, are you responsible for bringing it to somebody else\u2019s attention?\n\u201c[L.F.]: Yes.\n\u201c[The prosecutor]: Do you also discuss pertinent information with that individual who would make the ultimate decision?\n\u201c[L.F.]: Sometimes.\n\u201c[The prosecutor]: Do you have some input?\n*1346\u201c[L.F.]: Yes.\n\u201c[The prosecutor]: Apart from that, you basically facilitate the making of the claim and the processing of the claim?\n\u201c[L.F.]: Yes.\u201d\nK.K. was a lab technician at Raytheon, a position he had held for 15 years. The prosecutor asked K.K., \u201cWhat specifically do you do?\u201d K.K. replied, \u201cMetallurgy and electronic failure analysis.\u201d K.K. said he had an advanced degree in finance. When the prosecutor asked whether he \u201cever had to supervise employees,\u201d K.K. said, \u201cBasically, we\u2019re self-helping each other, [f] . . . [|] A lot of the people that we work with, some of it\u2019s on-the-job training, some of it\u2019s working directly with engineers that give us instructions, so it depends on who needs help.\u201d When the prosecutor asked whether he had held any other jobs, K.K. said, \u201cNot since I\u2019ve completed school, but I\u2019ve been auto mechanic, house painter, whole bunch of different types of jobs I guess.\u201d\nA third seated white juror, W.B., was a network technician for Huntington Beach High School District. When the prosecutor asked him to describe his job, W.B. said, \u201cIt means computer system, computer network administration, computer troubleshooting.\u201d When the prosecutor asked whether he supervised any employees, W.B. replied, \u201cNo. I do not.\u201d W.B. went on to say that five years earlier, he \u201cwas in electrical wholesale, in sales and office management, that type of thing.\u201d The prosecutor asked whether he supervised any employees while working in office management, and W.B. said, \u201cYes. Warehouse-type people.\u201d The prosecutor then asked, \u201cAnd what\u2019s the maximum number of employees you supervised?\u201d W.B. replied, \u201cWe had two, three, just sometimes temporaries.\u201d\nTo the extent that the prosecutor looked for supervisory experience as a proxy for seasoned decisionmaking ability, a comparison of J.S. with L.F. is \u201cparticularly striking.\u201d (Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at p. 483.) As an administrative assistant handling workers\u2019 compensation and medical claims, L.F. served as a \u201cbuffer\u201d and a \u201cfacilitator.\u201d She facilitated the making and processing of claims, and she brought problems, information, and input to others responsible for making decisions. But she said, \u201cI have no decision making in what I do ... .\u201d In addition, K.K., while having more advanced education than J.S., likewise had no supervisory role in his job as a lab technician. Further, W.B. had no supervisory role in his job as a network technician. The only supervisory experience W.B. mentioned was a job in office management five years earlier, in which he supervised two or three \u201c[w]arehouse-type people\u201d who were \u201csometimes temporaries.\u201d In sum, *1347nothing in the record indicates that J.S.\u2019s job as a telephone circuit designer was less suggestive of seasoned decisionmaking ability than L.F.\u2019s job as an administrative assistant, K.K.\u2019s job as a lab technician, or W.B.\u2019s job as a network technician or his prior job in office management. (See Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 241 [\u201cIf a prosecutor\u2019s proffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack who is permitted to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination . . . .\u201d].)\nToday\u2019s opinion speculates that \u201c[t]he prosecutor may have reasonably viewed Juror L.F. as someone with experience in making decisions in stressful circumstances, and someone who would work well with other jurors as a team and return a verdict,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he prosecutor may have reasonably found that. . . [K.K.\u2019s] ability to receive and give instructions to solve problems on a continuing basis demonstrated a strong ability to make decisions.\u201d (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1320.) But the record nowhere suggests that L.F. worked \u201cin stressful circumstances.\u201d Moreover, why would it not have been equally reasonable for the prosecutor to infer from J.S.\u2019s work experience that J.S., like K.K., was engaged in problem solving on a continuing basis and, like L.F, would work well with others? J.S. appeared to be a valued employee at Pacific Bell, having been promoted over a 30-year career from a clerk position to training others on how to design telephone circuits. From J.S.\u2019s job description, there was every reason for the prosecutor to infer that J.S. was experienced in problem solving and worked well with others.\nIndeed, the prosecutor\u2019s strike of J.S. after having accepted L.F., K.K., and W.B. appears even more suspicious in light of the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of J.S.\u2019s job. The prosecutor described J.S. as \u201ca data entry specialist\u201d who \u201cmakes no decisions\u201d and \u201cis given specifications and . . . inputs that information into a computer. She is basically a more sophisticated form of a filing clerk. And basically, she\u2019s held nothing but clerk positions.\u201d This minimization of J.S.\u2019s work history is unsupported by the record. J.S. worked as a clerk while she was in school and began working as a clerk for Pacific Bell, but eventually moved up to her current role. Regarding the process of designing circuits, J.S. said, \u201cWe get an order, and then we have to put together the circuit, where it\u2019s going from and where it ends up at.\u201d J.S. never mentioned data entry, and the prosecutor did not ask whether J.S.\u2019s job involved decisionmaking, problem solving, or technical expertise. As with L.F., K.K., and W.B., the prosecutor did not ask J.S. whether her job involved stressful situations. When defense counsel noted that the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of J.S.\u2019s work experience was unsupported by J.S.\u2019s testimony, the trial court did not address the discrepancy. The court observed that J.S.\u2019s *1348\u201cposition in the Department of Justice was filing\u201d but did not consider J.S.\u2019s job as a circuit designer who trained others at Pacific Bell, a position she had held for 20 years.\nAs noted, the prosecutor gave a second reason in explaining her strike of J.S.: \u201c. . . I want to add that it\u2019s not just supervisory positions that I look for. I look for how they handled stressful situations or incidences in their life.\u201d But this reason does not dispel the inference of discrimination because, as defense counsel objected at trial and as the record makes clear, J.S. was never asked about stressful situations in her life. The trial court said, \u201cI don\u2019t recall that specific question. But there were questions about her life.\u201d The only questions asked about J.S.\u2019s life, apart from her work history, concerned the makeup of her family and what activities she engaged in on a regular basis, to which J.S. said, \u201cI take my son, my 12-year-old son, back and forth to basketball practice and his games and\u2014[][] ... [][]... I don\u2019t have time to do anything else.\u201d Defense counsel asked the trial court to reopen voir dire specifically to examine whether J.S. had dealt with stressful situations in her life. But the prosecutor objected, and the trial court denied the request. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s second reason could not have distinguished L.F., K.K., or W.B. from J.S. because nothing in the record addressed whether or how those jurors had dealt with stressful situations in their lives.\nTo sum up: The prosecutor struck J.S., a black woman, in selecting the jury for a capital penalty trial involving a black man convicted of murdering a white victim. It is undisputed that the first penalty phase jury hung with two black women as holdouts against a death verdict. Based on J.S.\u2019s work experience, the prosecutor said J.S. was not a \u201cseasoned decision maker[]\u201d who \u201ccould handle the stress of a tough decision.\u201d But J.S.\u2019s work experience does not appear meaningfully different, as a proxy for decisionmaking ability, from the work experience of three seated white jurors, including an administrative assistant who said, \u201cI have no decision making in what I do ... .\u201d Further, although the prosecutor said she also \u201clook[s] for how they handled stressful situations or incidences in their life,\u201d this additional reason could not have explained the strike of J.S. because J.S. was never asked about stressful situations in her life. Considering the totality of relevant circumstances, I find it more likely than not that the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for striking J.S. were pretextual. \u201cThe prosecution\u2019s proffer of th[ese] pretextual explanation^] naturally gives rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.\u201d (Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at p. 485.)\nII.\nIn reaching a contrary conclusion, today\u2019s opinion reveals several dubious aspects of our Batson jurisprudence.\n*1349First, the court\u2019s examination of defendant\u2019s Batson claim, including its cursory comparative juror analysis, accords deference to the trial court\u2019s ruling. (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 1315, 1318.) But nothing in the record indicates that the trial court, in making its ruling, compared J.S. to white jurors whom the prosecutor did not strike. The trial court also did not examine discrepancies between J.S.\u2019s testimony and the prosecutor\u2019s account of J.S.\u2019s job. Nor did the trial court reopen voir dire in light of the prosecutor\u2019s claim that J.S. had not dealt with stressful situations in her life, even though the court acknowledged that J.S. had not been asked that question. Although deference is appropriate when the trial court has made \u201c \u2018a sincere and reasoned effort to evaluate\u2019 \u201d all relevant circumstances bearing on a Batson claim (People v. Lenix (2008) 44 Cal.4th 602, 614 [80 Cal.Rptr.3d 98, 187 P.3d 946] (Lenix)), it is unclear what exactly this court is deferring to here. (See People v. Mai (2013) 57 Cal.4th 986, 1062 [161 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 305 P.3d 1175] (conc. opn. of Liu, J.).) On this record, the case for deference is especially weak because the prosecutor did not rely on J.S.\u2019s demeanor or other intangible qualities apparent only to the trial court. This court, no less than the trial court, is capable of evaluating the prosecutor\u2019s claims as to decisionmaking ability, as demonstrated by each juror\u2019s employment or life experience.\nSecond, the court casts doubt on the utility of comparative juror analysis when conducted for the first time on appeal because \u201ca party legitimately may challenge one prospective juror but not another to whom the same particular concern applies. [Citation.] \u2018Two panelists might give a similar answer on a given point. Yet the risk posed by one panelist might be offset by other answers, behavior, attitudes or experiences that make one juror, on balance, more or less desirable. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1319.) Whatever the merits of this concern (cf. Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 247, fn. 6 [rejecting \u201ca rule that no comparison is probative unless the situation of the individuals compared is identical in all respects\u201d]), it has no applicability here. That is because the prosecutor emphasized that the capital sentencing process, in her view, \u201crequires individuals who are seasoned decision makers.\u201d (Italics added.) In other words, the prosecutor\u2019s reason for striking J.S. was a necessary quality she purportedly sought in any seated juror, whatever other qualities a juror might have. A comparative analysis that focuses specifically on this quality is thus probative of purposeful discrimination. (The court does not posit other qualities that distinguish L.F., K.K., or W.B. from J.S. in any event.) Moreover, the utility of such analysis does not require a large number of comparison jurors. In Snyder, the high court found it highly probative to compare a black juror struck by the prosecutor to just *1350two seated white jurors. (Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at pp. 483-484.) Here, as in Snyder, comparative juror analysis gives rise to a strong inference of discriminatory intent, even on a deferential standard of review. (Id. at p. 485; see Miller-El, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 241 [finding comparative juror analysis \u201c[mjore powerful\u201d than the fact that the prosecution struck 10 out of 11 black venirepersonsj.)\nThird, the court says \u201c[t]he basis for a challenge may range from \u2018the virtually certain to the highly speculative\u2019 [citation] and \u2018even a \u201ctrivial\u201d reason, if genuine and neutral, will suffice.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1316.) But Snyder identified the \u201chighly speculative\u201d nature of the prosecutor\u2019s stated reason as an indication of implausibility, giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent. (Snyder, supra, 552 U.S. at p. 482.) Further, the court says the Batson inquiry focuses \u201c \u2018on the subjective genuineness of the race-neutral reasons given for the peremptory challenge, not on the objective reasonableness of those reasons.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1317.) But we have also recognized that the prosecutor\u2019s credibility can be measured by, among other factors, \u201c \u2018how reasonable, or how improbable, the explanations are.\u2019 \u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613, quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell (2003) 537 U.S. 322, 339 [154 L.Ed.2d 931, 123 S.Ct. 1029].) Quite often, as in this case, an objective analysis of the reasonableness of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation in light of the relevant circumstances in the record is the only basis for meaningful review of a Batson ruling.\nFinally, today\u2019s opinion makes new law that improperly limits comparative juror analysis. In this appeal, defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for striking two black jurors are undermined by a comparison of those jurors not only to nonblack jurors already seated at the time the trial court ruled on the strikes, but also to nonblack jurors seated after the trial court\u2019s rulings. The court holds that \u201cif defendant believed the trial court should have considered any postruling developments, he could have, and should have, renewed his Batson/Wheeler claim. Because defendant did not, his reliance on the responses of the above jurors that were provided after the trial court denied his second motion is forfeited.\u201d (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1319.) This rule, the court says, follows from our statement in Lenix that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s finding is reviewed on the record as it stands at the time the Wheeler/Batson ruling is made. If the defendant believes that subsequent events should be considered by the trial court, a renewed objection is required to permit appellate consideration of these subsequent developments.\u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 624.)\n*1351But this statement in Lenix was dictum because Lenix involved no issue of \u201csubsequent developments\u201d urged for appellate consideration. The forfeiture rule announced today is in substantial tension with Lenix\u2019s key holding with regard to consideration of comparative juror analysis when it is urged for the first time on appeal. In light of the obvious importance that Snyder and Miller-El assigned to comparative juror analysis, Lenix said that those cases \u201cstand for the proposition that, as to claims of error at Wheeler/Batson\u2019s third stage, our former practice of declining to engage in comparative juror analysis for the first time on appeal unduly restricts review based on the entire record. As the high court noted in Snyder, \u2018In Miller-El v. Dretke, the Court made it clear that in considering a Batson objection, or in reviewing a ruling claimed to be Batson error, all of the circumstances that bear upon the issue of racial animosity must be consulted.\u2019 (Snyder, [supra, 552 U.S.] at p. [478], italics added.) Thus, evidence of comparative juror analysis must be considered in the trial court and even for the first time on appeal if relied upon by the defendant and the record is adequate to permit the urged comparisons.\u201d (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 622, fn. omitted.)\nLenix thus holds that in reviewing a Batson ruling, an appellate court is not precluded from considering, and indeed must consider, grounds that the defendant did not bring to the trial court\u2019s attention. The essential premise of this holding is that appellate review of a Batson ruling is not merely an exercise in evaluating the trial court\u2019s performance based on arguments put forth by the parties. Instead, as Lenix said, Snyder and Miller-El require appellate courts to consider all relevant circumstances\u2014to engage in \u201creview based on the entire record\u201d\u2014in determining whether the strike of a particular juror was improperly motivated. (Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 622.) If jurors seated before a trial court\u2019s ruling, but never brought to the court\u2019s attention, must be considered in comparative juror analysis, then there is no reason why jurors seated after a trial court\u2019s ruling may be considered only if the defendant makes a renewed objection. Any juror accepted by the prosecutor is a potentially relevant basis for comparison in determining whether a particular strike was discriminatory.\nAlthough I agree that comparing the struck jurors to jurors seated after the trial court\u2019s ruling does not aid the Batson claim in this case (maj. opn., ante, at pp. 1321-1322), this is not always so. In People v. Manibusan (2013) 58 Cal.4th 40 [165 Cal.Rptr.3d 1], the prosecution exercised its first peremptory strike against a black female juror whose only prior service on a jury had resulted in a hung jury. Among the reasons offered for the strike, the prosecutor said, \u201c T have an absolute policy of getting rid of people whose only jury experience resulted in a hung jury.\u2019 \u201d (Id. at p. 108 (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Liu, J.).) But after the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s Batson motion, the prosecutor repeatedly accepted two jurors whose sole experience on a jury had resulted in a hung jury. \u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s \u2018absolute policy,\u2019 it *1352turns out, was not absolute at all.\u201d (Ibid.) Today\u2019s decision requires us to ignore such obviously relevant circumstances in evaluating a Batson claim.\nAs a practical matter, the court has put the bar on notice that any reasonably competent defense attorney must reassert all Batson challenges at the end of jury selection, even though counsel need not bring any comparative juror analysis to the trial court\u2019s attention in order to preserve the entire record for appeal. (See Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 622 [\u201cevidence of comparative juror analysis must be considered . . . even for the first time on appeal if relied upon by the defendant and the record is adequate to permit the urged comparisons\u201d].) The peculiarity of this result should be a tipoff that something is amiss. Under Snyder, Miller-El, and Lenix, our duty to consider all relevant circumstances in evaluating a Batson claim does not depend on counsel\u2019s compliance with such an empty exercise.\nIII.\nToday\u2019s decision extends this court\u2019s extraordinary track record of denying Batson claims. (See People v. Harris (2013) 57 Cal.4th 804, 885, 892-898 [161 Cal.Rptr.3d 364, 306 P.3d 1195] (conc. opn. of Liu, J.) [documenting this court\u2019s rejection of Batson claims in 101 out of 102 cases presenting the issue over the past two decades, with People v. Silva (2001) 25 Cal.4th 345 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 93, 21 P.3d 769] (Silva) as the sole exception].) Our Batson jurisprudence\u2014especially its reflexive deference to trial court rulings and its refusal to infer discrimination from disparate treatment of similarly situated jurors\u2014leaves one to wonder whether any circumstances, short of an outright admission by the prosecutor (see Silva, at p. 375), will ever suffice to prove a violation.\nProspective Juror J.S. was a mother of three who advanced over a 30-year career into a technical job in which she trained others. She had twice served on a jury that reached a verdict. She repeatedly said she would consider the evidence, would speak her mind and listen to others, and would be willing to vote for the death penalty in an appropriate case. J.S. appeared to be a well-qualified juror, no less qualified than several white jurors whom the prosecutor accepted. In this penalty retrial of a black man convicted of murdering a white victim, in which it is undisputed that the first penalty phase jury hung with two black women refusing to vote for death, the prosecutor\u2019s strike of J.S. was not credibly explained by the reasons the prosecutor gave. Under the laws of this state, defendant may well deserve the death penalty in the eyes of a reasonable jury. But the jury must be one selected free of improper discrimination.\n*1353I join the portion of the court\u2019s opinion affirming defendant\u2019s convictions. But I respectfully dissent from the court\u2019s affirmance of the penalty verdict.\n",
