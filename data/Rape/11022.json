After the school term ended, several of the younger and smaller\n\nwrestlers told an investigator that before practice sessions and while on bus trips\n\nJ.H. inserted his finger or fingers into their rectums. The investigation ultimately\n\nresulted in a juvenile delinquency petition. In the adjudicatory hearing, J.H. said\n\nthat he never intended to insert his finger into the other wrestlers\u2019 rectums \u2014 he\n\nwas performing a legitimate wrestling move called \u201cskinning.\u201d The court concluded\n\notherwise, adjudicating J.H. of having committed seven attempted rapes. On\n\nappeal, J.H. asserts that there was no proof of any sexual intent on his part and the\n\nevidence was insufficient to sustain the court\u2019s findings. Because there was\n\nsufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s decision and an attempted rape may be\n\ncommitted even if the perpetrator had no sexual purpose, we affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n[\u00b62.]        Sometime after the end of the 2006 school term, allegations arose that\n\nJ.H., a sixteen-year-old junior, had assaulted several members of the Parker High\n\nSchool wrestling team. These incidents occurred when J.H. engaged in horseplay\n\neither before wrestling practices or during bus trips for wrestling events. Grades\n\nseven through twelve practiced together. The allegations were that J.H., sometimes\n\nwith the assistance of other wrestlers, held down smaller or younger members on\n\nthe team and attempted to insert his finger or fingers through their clothing into\n\ntheir rectums, at times successfully.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -1-\n\f#24561\n\n[\u00b63.]        Agent James Severson of the Division of Criminal Investigation looked\n\ninto these accusations. He interviewed the victims, as well as J.H. and several\n\nother members of the wrestling team. A grand jury later indicted J.H. on twenty-\n\none counts of rape and attempted rape. J.H. successfully moved to transfer the\n\nproceedings to juvenile court, when the State made no objection. The State filed a\n\ndelinquency petition alleging, in addition to the previous charges, two Child in Need\n\nof Supervision counts. Later, the State voluntarily dismissed ten of the rape and\n\nattempted rape charges.\n\n[\u00b64.]        At the adjudicatory hearing, all the victims testified that team\n\nmembers would engage in horseplay before wrestling practice or on bus trips. But,\n\naccording to these wrestlers, J.H.\u2019s horseplay was different. Three occurrences\n\ntypify the victims\u2019 testimony and the court\u2019s conclusions. In one instance, on a bus\n\nride home from a tournament, J.H. grabbed a fifteen-year-old freshman and took\n\nhim to the back of the bus, saying \u201cif you scream, I will hurt you.\u201d There, with the\n\nhelp of another wrestler, J.H. shoved him onto the floor between two seats, and\n\ninserted his finger into the victim\u2019s anus. The boy yelled out, but someone covered\n\nhis mouth.\n\n[\u00b65.]        More common were the incidents in the school wrestling room before\n\npractice sessions, when the coaches had not yet arrived. On one occasion, J.H. told\n\nanother wrestler to hold a fifteen-year-old freshman down. J.H. then inserted his\n\nfinger into the boy\u2019s \u201cbuttock cheeks\u201d while the boy kicked and yelled. The boy\n\ntestified that he believed J.H.\u2019s finger went into his rectum because it felt worse\n\nthan the previous time J.H. had done this to him. A fourteen-year-old freshman\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f#24561\n\nwas similarly maltreated. J.H. pushed him onto his stomach and stuck his finger\n\ninto the boy\u2019s \u201cbutt cheeks,\u201d but did not enter his rectum. J.H. covered his mouth\n\nwhen the boy kicked and screamed. J.H. told the boy not to tell anyone about this.\n\nSaying he was scared, the boy did not report what happened for some time.\n\n[\u00b66.]        Although some of the wrestlers said that they thought these acts were\n\nall just part of the horseplay, they also said that what J.H. did hurt them or made\n\nthem feel uncomfortable. As for the question whether this maneuver was a\n\nwrestling move called \u201cskinning,\u201d the victims described their understanding of the\n\nmove and said that what J.H. did to them was not skinning.\n\n[\u00b67.]        The State presented expert testimony from Michael McArthur. His\n\nwrestling r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included several state and national championships, as well as\n\nexperience as both an Olympic wrestler and coach. McArthur knew the so-called\n\n\u201cskinning\u201d move as the \u201cbutt drag.\u201d The butt drag, according to McArthur, did not\n\ninvolve placing a finger near the rectum. Rather, McArthur described it as \u201ca\n\ndefensive move when an opponent is attacking the legs. I would \u2014 if it was me\n\napplying the move, I would be in a sprawled position with my legs back and I would\n\nreach over the person\u2019s back to the end of their spinal cord and then try to apply\n\npressure up the spinal cord with the \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s called the heel of my\n\nhand or my forearm, depending on how long my arm is.\u201d\n\n[\u00b68.]        In contrast to McArthur\u2019s opinion, volunteer coach Dominick LaRocca\n\ngave another understanding of the \u201cskinning\u201d move, a move he taught the Parker\n\nwrestlers. A member of the Nebraska Wrestling Coaches\u2019 Hall of Fame, LaRocca\n\nexplained that the move is used to try \u201cto break down the opponent\u2019s hips by\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f#24561\n\nreaching into the rectal area and turning a man\u2019s hips away from you or towards\n\nyou, whichever . . . the situation determines.\u201d He agreed that the move does \u201cnot\n\ninvolve fingers in the rectum.\u201d But, he said that in applying this move, in the\n\nstruggle to gain an advantage over an opponent, there might be inadvertent\n\npenetration through the clothing. It \u201coccurs all the time.\u201d\n\n[\u00b69.]        J.H. testified that he never intended to insert his fingers into the\n\nrectums of his teammates. Rather, he was just horsing around and wrestling in\n\nfun. Even in horseplay, he said that he was performing the wrestling move called\n\n\u201cskinning\u201d or \u201cbutt drag.\u201d This move, according to J.H., is used to bring a wrestler\n\nto the floor. The wrestler would be on all fours, and the person doing the \u201cskinning\u201d\n\nwould reach over and place his hand and fingers on the coccyx and apply pressure\n\nforward. J.H. insisted that he never intentionally attempted to insert his finger in\n\nanother wrestler\u2019s anus.\n\n[\u00b610.]       The circuit court adjudicated J.H. guilty of seven attempted rapes and\n\nnot guilty of the remaining charges. It found the victims to be credible despite some\n\ninconsistencies in their testimony. The court attributed the inconsistencies \u201cto their\n\nage and the length of time that passed before they began talking about these\n\nexperiences.\u201d Moreover, the court considered the close relationships of the victims\n\n(some are friends and some are related) and that \u201cthe victims have to some extent\n\nacted in concert with one another since these charges arose.\u201d\n\n[\u00b611.]       In its memorandum opinion, the circuit court wrote that \u201cthe evidence\n\noverwhelmingly [showed] that J.H.\u2019s intent during each of these incidents was to\n\ninsert his fingers into the rectums of these young wrestlers apparently for fun or as\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f#24561\n\na type of initiation.\u201d The court found that the victims\u2019 allegations were confirmed\n\nby some of the wrestlers who were not victims and by some of the older wrestlers\n\nwho were J.H.\u2019s friends. Moreover, as the court explained, J.H.\u2019s own statements to\n\nthe law enforcement investigator \u201ccorroborate[d] the victims\u2019 testimonies.\u201d\n\nAlthough J.H. admitted only to \u201cskinning\u201d other wrestlers, the court concluded that\n\n\u201cJ.H. was not \u2018skinning\u2019 these young wrestlers in the sense of how the wrestling\n\nmove is applied.\u201d Expressing its strong conviction about what had happened, the\n\ncourt remarked that \u201cthere are times where the inappropriate \u2018horseplay\u2019 so far\n\ncrosses the line that it needs to be called what it is, a crime.\u201d Written findings and\n\na judgment of adjudication were entered on April 27, 2007.\n\n[\u00b612.]       J.H. appeals asserting that there was insufficient evidence to support\n\nhis adjudications for attempted rape. He contends that there was no intent \u201cto\n\ncommit an act of sexual penetration within the meaning of what the law considers\n\nrape, under these facts and circumstances[.]\u201d\n\n                                          II.\n\n[\u00b613.]       We review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo. State v. Tofani,\n\n2006 SD 63, \u00b635, 719 NW2d 391, 400 (citing State v. Disanto, 2004 SD 112, \u00b614,\n\n688 NW2d 201, 206). \u201cIn measuring evidentiary sufficiency, we ask \u2018whether, after\n\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational\n\ntrier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d Id. \u00b624 (quoting Disanto, 2004 SD 112, \u00b614, 688 NW2d at 206\n\n(quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 US 307, 319, 99 SCt 2781, 2789, 61 LEd2d 560\n\n(1979))).\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f#24561\n\n[\u00b614.]       In his appellate briefs and oral argument, counsel for J.H. spent\n\nconsiderable effort surveying the contradictions and inconsistencies in the\n\ntestimony of the wrestling team members who gave evidence against his client. We\n\nhave carefully reviewed the transcripts and agree that, in several instances, those\n\ninconsistencies are verifiable in the record. Nonetheless, the circuit court took all\n\nthis into account, including the five-month delay in reporting the incidents, and still\n\nconcluded that the salient events occurred as these witnesses recounted. There is\n\nno showing that the court\u2019s fact and credibility findings were erroneous. Under our\n\nde novo review, the events as told by the victims appear consistent and, in several\n\ninstances, corroborated.\n\n                                          III.\n\n[\u00b615.]       On a more difficult issue, J.H. maintains that the evidence is\n\ninsufficient to establish that he intended to penetrate the victims sexually. He\n\ncontends that, like other wrestlers, he regularly engaged in horseplay before\n\npractice or on bus trips. The horseplay, J.H. asserts, might sometimes involve\n\nconduct that would not be allowed in legitimate wrestling matches, but should not\n\nresult in adjudications of attempted rape.\n\n[\u00b616.]       According to J.H., the State failed to prove a purpose to penetrate for\n\nsexual gratification or arousal. Indeed, the court concluded that J.H.\u2019s attempt to\n\nstick his fingers into the anuses of his fellow wrestlers was, in effect, a vulgar\n\nprank. In the court\u2019s words, \u201cJ.H.\u2019s intent during each of these incidents was to\n\ninsert his fingers into the rectums of these young wrestlers apparently for fun or as\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f#24561\n\na type of initiation.\u201d During the dispositional hearing, the court specifically made a\n\nfinding on the record that J.H.\u2019s actions were not sexually motivated.\n\n[\u00b617.]       Do these acts constitute attempted rape if they were done without any\n\nsexual intent? As charged in this case, the crime of rape is \u201can act of sexual\n\npenetration accomplished with any person under any of the following circumstances\n\n. . . (2) Through the use of force, coercion, or threats of immediate and great bodily\n\nharm against the victim or other persons within the victim\u2019s presence, accompanied\n\nby apparent power of execution[.]\u201d SDCL 22-22-1(2). Sexual penetration is defined\n\nin SDCL 22-22-2 as \u201can act, however slight, of sexual intercourse, cunnilingus,\n\nfellatio, anal intercourse, or any intrusion, however slight, of any part of the body or\n\nof any object into the genital or anal openings of another person\u2019s body.\u201d We\n\nconstrue these statutes \u201caccording to the fair import of their terms, with a view to\n\neffect their objects and promote justice.\u201d SDCL 22-1-1.\n\n[\u00b618.]       In the first grouping \u2014 \u201csexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal\n\nintercourse\u201d \u2014 all the acts are innately sexual. It is entirely comprehensible that\n\nthe Legislature would call these acts \u201csexual penetration.\u201d But \u201cany\u201d intrusions,\n\n\u201chowever slight, of any part of the body or of any object into the genital or anal\n\nopenings\u201d are not necessarily sexual in nature. Here we encounter a problem. Did\n\nthe Legislature intend that literally \u201cany\u201d such \u201cintrusion,\u201d regardless of whether\n\nthe actor had a sexual intent, would constitute rape?\n\n[\u00b619.]       It appears that the element of sexual intent was deliberately omitted\n\nfrom the rape statute, for it was clearly included in the sexual contact statute. In\n\nSDCL 22-22-7.1, the Legislature defined \u201csexual contact\u201d to include \u201cany touching,\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f#24561\n\nnot amounting to rape, whether or not through clothing or other covering, of the\n\nbreasts of a female or the genitalia or anus of any person with the intent to arouse or\n\ngratify the sexual desire of either party.\u201d (Emphasis added). Evidently, the\n\nLegislature believed that certain types of \u201csexual penetration\u201d could be nonsexual,\n\nyet constitute a crime.\n\n[\u00b620.]       At least two other jurisdictions have encountered difficulties in a\n\nsimilar definition of sexual penetration. A Rhode Island statute defined sexual\n\npenetration as any \u201cintrusion, however slight, by any part of a person\u2019s body or by\n\nany object into the genital or anal openings of another person\u2019s body. . . .\u201d State v.\n\nBryant, 670 A2d 776, 783 (RI 1996) (quoting RI Gen Laws \u00a7 11-37-1(8) (1981)). The\n\nRhode Island Supreme Court noted that no intent element was included, although\n\none existed in the sexual contact statute. Nevertheless, according to the court, the\n\nabsence of the intent element \u201cin a statute does not mean the Legislature declined\n\nto require a specific mental state but that it rather \u2018merely recognized that intent\n\nwas so inherent in the idea of the offense that it required no statutory affirmation.\u2019\u201d\n\nState v. Griffith, 660 A2d 704, 706 (RI 1995) (quoting State v. Tobin, 602 A2d 528,\n\n534 (RI 1992) (quoting Morissette v. United States, 342 US 246, 252, 72 SCt 240,\n\n244, 96 LEd 288, 294 (1952))). To correct this latent defect, the court ruled that\n\nnecessity required the inclusion of \u201csexual arousal or gratification in order to\n\npreclude the possibility that a defendant could be convicted because of an innocent\u201d\n\npenetration. Bryant, 670 A2d at 783 (citing Griffith, 660 A2d at 707). This\n\n\u201cnecessity\u201d arose because at common law \u201cnothing short of penile penetration was\n\nsufficient in order to constitute the offense of rape\u201d and the risk of innocent\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f#24561\n\npenetrations did not exist. Id.; see also Griffith, 660 A2d at 706 (citing Tobin, 602\n\nA2d at 534 (quoting Morissette, 342 US at 252, 72 SCt at 244, 96 LEd 288 (1952))).\n\n[\u00b621.]         A similar definition of sexual penetration confronted the Mississippi\n\nSupreme Court. To reconcile its meaning, the court ruled that\n\n               [a]lthough, on its face, the definition of sexual penetration\n               announced in [Miss Code Ann] \u00a7 97-3-97 encompasses any\n               penetration, the Court holds the parameters of the definition of\n               sexual penetration are logically confined to activities which are\n               the product of sexual behavior or libidinal gratification, not\n               merely the product of clinical examinations or domestic,\n               parental functions. As stated in United States v. Harriss, 347\n               US 612, 618, 74 SCt 808, 812, 98 LEd 996 (1954), \u201c[I]f [the]\n               general class of offenses can be made constitutionally definite by\n               a reasonable construction of the statute, this Court is under a\n               duty to give the statute that construction.\u201d\n\nRoberson v. State, 501 So2d 398, 400-01 (Miss 1987). Thus, the court concluded,\n\nsexual penetration must be accompanied by a sexual intent in order to preclude\n\ncriminal convictions for innocent conduct.\n\n[\u00b622.]         The Rhode Island case dealt with the crime of \u201cfirst-degree child\n\nmolestation sexual assault,\u201d and the Mississippi case examined the crime of \u201csexual\n\nbattery.\u201d See RI Gen Laws \u00a7\u00a7 11-37-8.1; 11-37-1(8); Miss Code Ann \u00a7\u00a7 97-3-95, 97-3-\n\n97 (1986). In each case, the crime prohibited \u201csexual penetration\u201d with an underage\n\nor incapacitated person. * In neither of these statutes, however, is there an element\n\nof \u201cforce, coercion, or threats of immediate and great bodily harm,\u201d as in the section\n\nof the South Dakota statute charged here. That distinguishes our case. Along with\n\n\n\n*        These statutes are similar to South Dakota\u2019s definition of rape in SDCL 22-\n         22-1(1), involving sexual penetration of a child under thirteen. J.H. was not\n         charged under this section. We express no opinion on whether this section or\n         SDCL 22-22-1(3) could encompass innocent conduct.\n\n                                           -9-\n\f#24561\n\nsexual penetration there must be force, coercion, or threats, under SDCL 22-22-1(2).\n\nThis section in our rape statute obviously contemplates not only penetration in the\n\nsexual sense but also penetration in the abusive sense. One who forces or coerces\n\ngenital or anal penetration with another commits the offense even without any\n\nsexual motivation. Thus, under our statutory definition of forced or coercive rape in\n\nSDCL 22-22-1(2), we do not have the specter of criminalizing innocent conduct.\n\n[\u00b623.]       It has been repeatedly stated that rape in our State is a general intent\n\ncrime. State v. Pugh, 2002 SD 16, \u00b68 n3, 640 NW2d 79, 82 n3; State v. Perkins, 444\n\nNW2d 34, 38 (SD 1989); State v. Means, 363 NW2d 565, 568 (SD 1985); State v.\n\nHoughton, 272 NW2d 788, 791 (SD 1978), overruled on other grounds by State v.\n\nWillis, 370 NW2d 193 (SD 1985). Therefore, the perpetrator need only intend the\n\nprohibited act. State v. Schouten, 2005 SD 122, \u00b613, 707 NW2d 820, 824 (citations\n\nomitted). Nonetheless, criminal liability must be based on proof that the act was\n\naccompanied by a culpable state of mind. State v. Huber, 356 NW2d 468, 472 (SD\n\n1984) (quoting LaFave & Scott, Handbook on Criminal Law \u00a7 28, at 201 (1972))\n\n(\u201csome form of mental state is a prerequisite to guilt\u201d).\n\n[\u00b624.]       J.H. may not have known that his actions constituted a crime. Yet,\n\nwhen he forcibly tried to insert his fingers into the anus of one of his fellow\n\nwrestlers, in circumstances where the court found he was not performing the\n\nskinning move or any other wrestling maneuver, he committed the offense of\n\nattempted rape as defined under our law. While there was no sexual intent, there\n\nwas a culpable mental state, an abusive intent. We conclude that a rational trier of\n\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\f#24561\n\nfact could find the essential elements of the acts of delinquency committed by J.H.\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n[\u00b625.]       Affirmed.\n\n[\u00b626.]       GILBERTSON, Chief Justice, and SABERS, ZINTER, and\n\nMEIERHENRY, Justices, concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f",
