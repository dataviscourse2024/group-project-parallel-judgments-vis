DECISION OF THE BOARD OF\n                                                      IMMIGRATION APPEALS\nERIC H.

Petitioners, Maureen Jacobs, as lead petitioner, and her husband,\n\nTrevor Anthony Jacobs, as a derivative petitioner, seek review of an order of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) upholding the denial of the lead petitioner\u2019s application for asylum\n\npursuant to \u00a7 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158, withholding of\n\nremoval pursuant to \u00a7 241(b)(3) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), and protection under the\n\nConvention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). The immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied the application on\n\nseveral grounds, including Petitioners\u2019 failure to produce corroborating evidence. Petitioners\n\nappealed to the BIA. The BIA dismissed the appeal, agreeing with the IJ that Petitioners failed to\n\n\n       *\n       The Honorable Robert H. Cleland, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of\nMichigan, sitting by designation.\n\n                                                  1\n\fsufficiently corroborate their claims because Petitioners failed to submit documents that were\n\nreasonably available to them. For the reasons set forth below, we DENY the petition for review.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       A.      Factual Background\n\n       Maureen Jacobs, the lead petitioner, is a native and citizen of South Africa, and is married\n\nto Trevor Jacobs, a native and citizen of Namibia. On January 24, 2000, Maureen entered the United\n\nStates through Detroit, Michigan on a J-2 visa. Approximately one year later, on January 21, 2001,\n\nMaureen filed an application for asylum, listing her husband, Trevor, as a derivative beneficiary.\n\nMaureen claimed that she feared returning to South Africa because she believed that she would be\n\nsubjected to torture based on her membership in Mapogo-a-Mathamaga (\u201cMapogo\u201d). She also\n\nalleged that she had suffered \u201charassment, intimidation, and rape\u201d because she was a \u201cwhite,\n\nAfrikaner woman.\u201d (J.A. 881.)\n\n       In her asylum application and during the removal hearing, Maureen claimed that she suffered\n\npersecution because of her membership in Mapogo. Petitioners described Mapogo as a group of\n\ncitizens coming together to \u201cgive protection to the citizens\u201d against criminal activity because of the\n\ninability of the police to protect them. (J.A. 161.) Maureen testified that she and her husband joined\n\nin February 1999 and received leopard head bumper stickers for their cars and home to indicate that\n\nthey were members of Mapogo. According to Maureen, the African National Congress (\u201cANC\u201d),\n\nthe controlling political party in South Africa, is hostile to Mapogo. Maureen also claimed that she\n\nwas the target of violence because she was a white woman, and that the police were unable to protect\n\nher from the rape and violence committed against white women in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f        During the removal hearing, Maureen testified to three specific incidents in support of her\n\napplication for asylum, withholding of removal, and request for relief under the CAT. The first\n\nincident of violence she described occurred in August 1999. Maureen testified that as she entered\n\nthe store on a shopping trip, a man blocked her way. According to Maureen, he was waving a\n\ncigarette in her face and \u201c[h]e got very aggressive\u201d and was \u201ccursing\u201d at her. (J.A. 162.) She stated\n\nthat she \u201csaw two men standing just behind his back\u201d and, when she attempted to back away from\n\nthe man with the cigarette, she noticed \u201cthree men . . . standing at [her] back with their arms over\n\ntheir chest and . . . laughing.\u201d Maureen indicated that she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d (J.A. 163.) She testified\n\nthat \u201cthe man grabbed me by my arm and he placed the burning cigarette on my lip and he was\n\nburning me and he was shouting . . . . go and tell your Mapago [sic] husband that we will come and\n\nget him.\u201d (J.A. 165.)\n\n        Maureen then went home to wait for her husband to return from work and, when he arrived,\n\nshe told him what had happened. She testified that Trevor \u201cimmediately . . . called the police . . .\n\nand the police asked him if there was any witnesses or do we know the people and we said we did\n\nnot know the people and there wasn\u2019t any witnesses and then the police just say that if we don\u2019t have\n\nwitnesses, then we cannot make a case . . . .\u201d (J.A. 166.) Maureen said that the police refused to\n\nmake a report.\n\n        The second incident allegedly occurred on September 15, 1999. According to Maureen,\n\nSarah, \u201ca black woman whom [they] knew,\u201d visited their home and told them that \u201cseveral black\n\nmen were coming to [their] home\u201d to kill them. (J.A. 203.) Petitioners testified that Trevor asked\n\nMaureen to leave the house and stay with a friend, Alta Vanderwalt, and to call the police. As the\n\nmob approached Petitioners\u2019 home, the men threatened to \u201ckill all Mapogo members and tear down\n\n\n                                                   3\n\fall Mapogo member homes.\u201d (J.A. 892.) Before the mob attacked their home, however, Petitioners\n\nclaimed that Mapogo members arrived and spoke with the mob, eventually convincing them to leave.\n\nPetitioners stated that the police never arrived at their home.\n\n       Finally, Maureen described a third incident of violence she claims occurred while she was\n\nliving in South Africa. On January 7, 2000, Maureen was driving to a friend\u2019s house, and claims she\n\nnoticed a white car tailgating her car. She stated that, although she slowed down to let the car pass\n\nher, it did not, and instead continued to follow her. Maureen claimed that when she arrived at the\n\ndirt road leading to her friend\u2019s house, she had to slow down to make a turn and, when she turned,\n\ndust surrounded her car and the engine stopped. According to Maureen, the men in the car following\n\nher surrounded the car and began shaking it. Maureen stated that the men broke the window,\n\ndragged her out of the car, and told her that they wanted to \u201cteach [her] husband a lesson.\u201d (J.A.\n\n893.) In addition, they called her a \u201cwhite Mapago [sic] dog\u2019s wife,\u201d (J.A. 218), and were \u201cshouting\n\nin [her] face that . . . they were from the ANC . . . . [and] [t]hey will do whatever they want and\n\nnobody will stop them not even the Mapagos [sic]\u201d (J.A. 219). She testified that each of the men\n\nthen raped her. Maureen stated that she did not tell anyone about the rape until she arrived in the\n\nUnited States, and feared going to the police or a hospital because her attackers had told her that they\n\nwould slit her throat if she went to the police. Maureen also testified that she feared that she had\n\ncontracted HIV as a result of the rape, given the high rate of infection in South Africa. After arriving\n\nin the United States, Maureen took two HIV tests, both of which indicated that she does not have\n\nHIV.\n\n       B.      Procedural History\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f        On September 4, 2001, the INS issued a Notice to Appear to both Maureen and Trevor,\n\nalleging that they were removable pursuant to \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B) of the INA because they overstayed\n\na non-immigrant visa. Petitioners appeared before an immigration judge in Detroit, Michigan, and\n\nconceded removability. When Petitioners declined to designate a country of removal, the court\n\ndesignated South Africa as the country of removal for Maureen, and Namibia as the country of\n\nremoval for Trevor.\n\n        The IJ held a removal hearing on July 25, 2005, during which Maureen and Trevor testified.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ denied Maureen\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and protection under the CAT. The IJ found that Petitioners were not credible, and also\n\nconcluded that Petitioners failed to corroborate the claims in the asylum application. In particular,\n\nthe IJ cited the absence of police reports, medical records, and evidence of Petitioners\u2019 membership\n\nin Mapogo, concluding that there was an \u201cabsolute lack of corroborative evidence.\u201d (J.A. 763.) The\n\nIJ also found that Maureen could not establish that she suffered persecution based on a protected\n\nground, and that Maureen further failed to demonstrate that she could not return to a different region\n\nof South Africa.\n\n        Petitioners appealed to the BIA, which affirmed. The BIA issued a separate opinion,\n\nagreeing with the IJ that Petitioners did not meet their burden of proof for asylum. Specifically, the\n\nBIA agreed with the IJ that Petitioners failed to produce \u201cdocuments that were reasonably available\n\n. . . and . . . failed to sufficiently explain their absence.\u201d (J.A. 2.) Petitioners now seek review of the\n\nBIA\u2019s decision.\n\nII.     THE BIA\u2019S DECISION THAT PETITIONERS FAILED TO MEET THEIR BURDEN\n        OF PROOF BASED ON THE LACK OF CORROBORATING EVIDENCE IS\n        SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE\n\n\n                                                    5\n\f         A.     Standard of Review\n\n         In reviewing the IJ\u2019s decision, the BIA declined to summarily affirm. Instead, the BIA issued\n\na separate opinion. Under these circumstances, this Court \u201creview[s] the BIA\u2019s decision as the final\n\nagency determination.\u201d Khalili v. Holder, 557 F.3d 429, 435 (6th Cir. 2009). \u201cTo the extent the BIA\n\nadopted the immigration judge\u2019s reasoning, however, this Court also reviews the immigration\n\njudge\u2019s decision.\u201d Id. We review the legal conclusions of the BIA de novo, and review factual\n\nfindings under the substantial evidence standard. Zoarab v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 777, 780 (6th Cir.\n\n2008).\n\n         In the context of the BIA\u2019s finding that certain corroborating documentation was available\n\nto Petitioners, \u201c[n]o court shall reverse a determination made by a trier of fact with respect to the\n\navailability of corroborating evidence . . . unless the court finds . . . that a reasonable trier of fact is\n\ncompelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.\u201d Shkabari v. Gonzales, 427\n\nF.3d 324, 331 n.2 (quoting Real ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(e), 119 Stat. 231, 305\n\n(2005)). Accordingly, in order to reverse the BIA\u2019s factual determinations, this Court \u201cmust find that\n\n\u2018the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but indeed compels it.\u2019\u201d Dorosh v. Ashcroft,\n\n398 F.3d 379, 381 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting Klawitter v. INS, 970 F.2d 149, 152 (6th Cir. 1992)).\n\n         B.     Agency Decision\n\n         The IJ concluded that Petitioners had not met their burden of proof for asylum or withholding\n\nof removal in part based on the failure to produce corroborating evidence. The IJ found that there\n\nwas an \u201cabsolute lack of corroborative evidence,\u201d and that \u201c[i]t would not be unreasonable at all for\n\n[the court] to have expected such corroborative evidence.\u201d (J.A. 763.) More specifically, the\n\nimmigration judge found that Petitioners had failed to present any evidence that they were members\n\n\n                                                     6\n\fof Mapogo. Although Petitioners testified that Trevor\u2019s brother was unable to obtain an original\n\ndocument proving their membership in Mapogo, the IJ found that \u201cth[e] record [was] devoid of any\n\nsupporting statement to substantiate the . . . claim that this brother made attempts to get their original\n\nmembership documents . . . from the Mapago [sic] organization, but was unable to do so.\u201d (J.A.\n\n766.) The IJ also noted the absence of \u201cany statement from [Trevor\u2019s] brother indicating that he\n\nfailed or was unable to get such original membership documents.\u201d (J.A. 766-67.) According to the\n\nIJ, \u201c[n]o attempts were apparently made by [Petitioners] to contact the Mapago [sic] association\n\nwhich clearly has a web site which even lists telephone numbers at which you can contact them.\u201d\n\n(J.A. 772.) In addition, the IJ\u2019s oral decision noted the lack of \u201cany supporting statements from any\n\nfellow members of the Mapago [sic] organization.\u201d (J.A. 770.)\n\n        Additionally, the IJ faulted Petitioners for failing to submit evidence corroborating the claim\n\nthat Maureen was attacked. Although recognizing that information relating to Maureen\u2019s HIV tests\n\nwas \u201chighly sensitive,\u201d the IJ nonetheless found that the medical records could \u201ccorroborate her\n\nconcern over obtaining such a virus\u201d as a result of the rape. (J.A. 768.) The IJ also noted the lack\n\nof \u201cany documents indicating that [Maureen] obtained any medical treatment whatsoever as a result\n\nof any attack/rape.\u201d (J.A. 770.) Further, the IJ believed that Petitioners could have obtained police\n\nreports documenting the attack on Maureen, and that their explanation for failing to do so was\n\ninadequate. Finally, the IJ concluded that Petitioners should have submitted statements from\n\nneighbors who knew of the \u201cincident\u201d on September 15, 1999, in which Petitioners learned that \u201ca\n\nmob was on their way to kill them.\u201d (J.A. 770.)\n\n        On appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision, the BIA agreed with the IJ that Petitioners failed to\n\nsufficiently corroborate their claim:\n\n\n                                                    7\n\f        Despite [having more than one year to collect and submit corroborating documents],\n        the respondents failed to submit any evidence corroborating their membership with\n        Mapago [sic], [Maureen]\u2019s HIV tests, a police report of the 1999 alleged attack on\n        [Maureen], or statements from [Trevor]\u2019s brother . . . or Petitioners\u2019 neighbors. . .\n        . [C]orroboration of the fact that the two were Mapago [sic] members could have\n        been easily obtained considering that the group has a web page with contact\n        information. We further note that a statement from the lead respondent\u2019s brother-in-\n        law was reasonably available considering that he supplied the respondents with the\n        Mapago [sic] membership \u201capplication.\u201d . . . . Inasmuch as the Immigration Judge\u2019s\n        lack of corroboration finding rests upon a lack of documents that were reasonably\n        available to the respondents and the respondents have failed to sufficiently explain\n        their absence, we will agree with the Immigration Judge that the respondents failed\n        to meet their burden of proof for asylum.\n\n(J.A. 2.)\n\n        C.     Analysis\n\n        The BIA rejected Petitioners\u2019 asylum application because Petitioners offered no evidence\n\nbeyond their testimony to corroborate their claims. Under agency regulations, \u201c[t]he testimony of\n\nthe applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d\n\n8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). Nonetheless, \u201ceven when an applicant\u2019s credibility has not been questioned,\n\nthe failure to provide reasonably available corroborating evidence\u201d can constitute grounds for\n\nconcluding that an applicant has failed to meet the burden of proof. Shkabari, 427 F.3d at 331. The\n\n\u201ccorroboration rule,\u201d however, does not require an applicant to provide supporting documentation\n\nunless \u201cit \u2018is of the type that would normally be created or available in the particular country and is\n\naccessible to the alien, such as through friends, relatives, or co-workers.\u2019\u201d Dorosh, 398 F.3d at 382-\n\n83 (quoting Perkovic v. INS, 33 F.3d 615 (6th Cir. 1994)). Consequently, \u201cwhere an alien\u2019s\n\ntestimony is the only evidence available, it can suffice where [it] is believable, consistent, and\n\nsufficiently detailed.\u201d Dorosh, 398 F.3d at 382. \u201cHowever, . . . where it is reasonable to expect\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fcorroborating evidence for certain alleged facts pertaining to the specifics of an applicant\u2019s claim,\n\nsuch evidence should be provided.\u201d Id. (citation omitted).\n\n       We conclude that the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence because Petitioners\n\nfailed to submit evidence that normally would be available and accessible, \u201csuch as through friends,\n\nrelatives, or co-workers.\u201d Id. at 383. In dismissing Petitioners\u2019 appeal, the BIA first focused on\n\nPetitioners\u2019 failure to submit evidence\u2014such as membership forms or statements from family\n\nmembers and friends\u2014corroborating the claim that they were members of Mapogo. Petitioners\n\ntestified that Trevor\u2019s brother, Gavin, attempted to get a copy of the actual membership form that\n\nMaureen and Trevor submitted to Mapogo to become members. According to Maureen, however,\n\nGavin was unsuccessful because \u201c[i]t is very difficult in South Africa . . . to get original documents.\u201d\n\n(J.A. 229.) Maureen also testified that they did not receive documentation of their membership in\n\nMapogo because \u201cthe Mapago [sic] people in South Africa are not well equipped like here in the\n\nUnited States.\u201d (J.A. 199.) Similarly, Trevor stated that they did not receive any evidence of their\n\nmembership in Mapogo or identification cards, but, instead, received stickers for their homes and\n\ncars to prove that they were members. Trevor also testified that, \u201cto [his brother]\u2019s knowledge, they\n\ndon\u2019t keep file of [membership papers].\u201d (J.A. 244.)\n\n       Petitioners\u2019 testimony suggests that Mapogo membership documents might not \u201cbe created\n\nor available\u201d in South Africa. See Dorosh, 398 F.3d at 383. However, even if Mapogo did not\n\nmaintain membership records and refused to provide Trevor\u2019s brother with evidence of Petitioners\u2019\n\nmembership in Mapogo, Petitioners failed to produce any evidence that they attempted to secure the\n\ndocuments from Mapogo\u2014Trevor testified that he did not even attempt to contact Mapogo. See\n\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fShkabari, 427 F.3d at 331 (\u201cEven if the doctor was still unavailable, Mrs. Shkabari did not present\n\nany evidence in the forms of letters or envelopes that she had tried to retrieve her files . . . .\u201d).\n\n        Petitioners also failed to adequately explain the absence of such corroborating evidence.\n\nWhen questioned as to why she did not obtain \u201can affidavit or documentation verifying that [Gavin]\n\nattempted documentation from the Mapago [sic] verifying your membership and was unable to do\n\nso,\u201d Maureen answered that she \u201cdidn\u2019t know that [she could] do that.\u201d (J.A. 201.) With respect\n\nto statements from family and friends who knew of their membership in Mapogo, Maureen testified\n\nthat she did not obtain statements verifying that she and her husband were members of Mapogo\n\nbecause she \u201cthought the only documentation direct from Mapago [sic] the headquarters, I thought\n\nthat is the documentation that the court or my lawyer wanted.\u201d (J.A. 200.) The record does not\n\ncompel, as it must to overturn the BIA\u2019s findings, the conclusion that such evidence was unavailable\n\nto Petitioners at the time Maureen submitted her asylum application.\n\n        The BIA also cited Petitioners\u2019 failure to submit statements from neighbors confirming the\n\nmob\u2019s alleged attack against them on September 15, 1999, and concluded that those documents were\n\navailable and accessible to Petitioners. During the removal hearing, Maureen explained that she\n\ncould not secure a statement from Sarah, the woman who alerted them to the attack, because Sarah\n\ncould not read or write and did not have a telephone. Maureen also testified that she did not know\n\nof anyone in the area who could help Sarah write a statement. However, in explaining the absence\n\nof affidavits or statements from other potential witnesses, Maureen stated only that her \u201clawyer did\n\nnot tell [her] to get information . . . and [she] never kn[e]w that the Court w[ould] see it.\u201d (J.A. 223.)\n\nMaureen then stated: \u201cIf I knew it, I would get that information.\u201d (Id.) Maureen\u2019s testimony thus\n\n\n\n\n                                                   10\n\fsuggests that she could have obtained the statements, but did not because she was unaware that they\n\ncould be used to support her asylum application.\n\n        This Court addressed a similar set of facts in Liti v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 631 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\nIn Liti, the court agreed with the BIA that \u201ccorroborating evidence was reasonably available to the\n\nLitis, yet not provided.\u201d Id. at 640. The court found that \u201cthough they have family members still\n\nliving in Albania, the Litis failed to provide any affidavits in support of their claim of persecution\n\n. . . . [T]hough Liti is in frequent contact with his brother, . . . the Litis failed to provide an affidavit\n\n. . . to bolster their claims of a well-founded fear of political persecution.\u201d Id. Similarly, Petitioners\n\nwere in contact with Trevor\u2019s brother and also had friends and family who continued to live in South\n\nAfrica. Nonetheless, Petitioners failed to secure statements from neighbors and family, and \u201cdid not\n\nprovide any reasonable explanation for the absence of any corroborating evidence.\u201d See id. Given\n\nPetitioners\u2019 testimony, the record does not compel the conclusion that neighbors\u2019 statements\n\nregarding the incidents of violence were unavailable.\n\n        Finally, the BIA agreed with the IJ that Petitioners failed to submit either Maureen\u2019s HIV\n\ntests or medical records to show that she was tested for HIV. Although Maureen offered an adequate\n\nexplanation for the absence of a medical or police report documenting the sexual assault,1\n\n\n\n        1\n         The IJ expressed concern that Maureen told no one about the rape, did not go to a hospital\nor to the police after she was raped, and failed to present her medical records showing that she took\nan HIV test. Numerous times during the hearing, however, Maureen explained the absence of a\npolice report or hospital record documenting her rape. Maureen testified that, \u201c[i]f you go to a\nhospital and a doctor, they will send you to the police.\u201d (J.A. 240.) Maureen stated that she feared\ninvolving the police \u201cbecause those men said his brother is in the police and they know where we\nwere.\u201d (J.A. 169.) According to Maureen, \u201c[t]he man who attack[ed] me also said if I go to the\npolice, they will slit my throat.\u201d (J.A. 193.) Moreover, she testified that she did not go to a hospital\nor doctor because the police and doctors treat rape victims \u201cvery badly\u201d (J.A. 197), and \u201cif you are\nraped . . . there is a label around your neck.\u201d (J.A. 240).\n\n                                                     11\n\fshe failed to explain her failure to submit medical records indicating that she was tested for HIV.2\n\nMaureen testified that she was tested for HIV in the United States in December 2000 and January\n\n2003. (J.A. 172.) Records indicating that she had the tests performed is the type of evidence\n\n\u201cavailable\u201d and \u201caccessible\u201d to Petitioners. See Shkabari, 427 F.3d at 331 (noting that the petitioner\n\ncould have sought medical evidence from doctors in this country to submit in connection with her\n\nasylum application). Accordingly, evidence that Maureen was tested for HIV was \u201creasonably\n\navailable corroborating evidence\u201d that Petitioners could have submitted in support of Maureen\u2019s\n\nasylum application. Consequently, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding\n\nthat statements from Trevor\u2019s brother, neighbors, and friends, as well as evidence of Maureen\u2019s HIV\n\ntests, were types of evidence that were \u201creasonably available,\u201d and that Petitioners failed to provide\n\na reasonable explanation for their failure to submit such corroborating evidence.3 See Liti, 411 F.3d\n\n\n       2\n        Before the BIA, Petitioners argued that they failed to submit Maureen\u2019s HIV test results\nbecause they received ineffective assistance of counsel. The BIA declined to address Petitioners\u2019\nargument, concluding that Petitioners did not satisfy the Lozada requirements. Further, the BIA\nfound that even if ineffective assistance of counsel explained the absence of the HIV test, it did not\nexplain \u201cwhy they failed to submit the other documents that were reasonably available.\u201d (J.A. 740.)\nRegardless of the merits of Petitioners\u2019 claims, the issue of whether Petitioners received ineffective\nassistance is not before us.\n       3\n         We also note that, although the BIA never mentioned the absence of police reports as a basis\nfor concluding that Petitioners failed to meet their burden of proof, the IJ explicitly found that\nPetitioners should have submitted police reports documenting the acts of violence. However, the\nrecord compels the finding that police reports were unavailable. Petitioners testified that the police\nrefused to make a report regarding the assault on Maureen at the shopping center, and that the police\nnever responded to their call for help regarding the mob attack on September 15, 1999. Further,\nMaureen testified that she never reported her rape to the police because she feared retaliation from\nher attackers. Petitioners also submitted numerous articles and reports detailing the ineffectiveness\nof South African police. For example, the 1999 Country Reports released by the State Department\nnoted that, despite reforms, the South African Police Service (\u201cSAPS\u201d) \u201chas been left with\ndeficiencies in midlevel leadership, and . . . . continued to be understaffed, overworked, and\nundertrained.\u201d (J.A. 470.) Accordingly, Petitioners met their burden of showing that police reports\nare not \u201cnormally . . . created or available in [South Africa].\u201d See Vasha v. Gonzales, 410 F.3d 863,\n\n                                                 12\n\fat 640.\n\nIII.      CONCLUSION\n\n          We DENY the petition seeking review of the BIA\u2019s dismissal of Petitioners\u2019 appeal.\n\n\n\n\n871 n.3 (6th Cir. 2005) (\u201c[G]iven . . . the fact that \u2018[t]he majority of police officers receive little or\nno training,\u2019 we cannot say that police records are the type of documentation normally created and\naccessible to current asylum applicants . . . .\u201d).\n\n                                                   13\n\f",
