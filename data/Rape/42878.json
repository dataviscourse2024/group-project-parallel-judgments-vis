            "opinion_text": "\nMCFADDEN, Judge.\nAfter a jury trial, Robert Austin Bufford was convicted of child molestation and aggravated child molestation. He argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence regarding his appearance at the time of his arrest and that his trial counsel was ineffective because she did not object to this evidence. Because Bufford has waived appellate review of the admission of the evidence, and because he has not met his burden of demonstrating that his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the evidence constituted deficient performance, we affirm.\n1. Facts.\nThe incident at issue in this case occurred in the early morning of January 1, 2007. R. B., then five years old, and her family celebrated New Year\u2019s Eve at the house of a family friend, who was Bufford\u2019s stepfather. Bufford was present, as well.\nDuring the night, R. B. and her teenaged brother tried to go to sleep on couches in the living room. Bufford entered the room and R. B. went to sit next to him in a chair. R. B. testified that Bufford then pulled down her panties and touched and kissed her \u201cprivacy,\u201d scaring her. R. B.\u2019s brother testified that he saw Bufford enter the room and R. B. sit next to him in a chair. The brother saw Bufford lean toward R. B. with \u201chis hand inside of her leg.\u201d He then saw Bufford get on his knees and place his head near the girl\u2019s \u201cprivate area.\u201d\nAfter Bufford left the room, R. B.\u2019s brother reported what he had seen to the children\u2019s parents. The family left the friend\u2019s house and drove home. Subsequently, R. B. told her mother that Bufford had \u201ctouched her in her privacy\u201d \u2022\u2014 referring to her vagina \u2014 and \u201ckissed her privacy.\u201d R. B.\u2019s parents notified the police, and R. B. and her brother gave forensic interviews to a social worker. Those interviews corroborated the children\u2019s trial testimony and were published to the jury.\n2. Admission of evidence about Bufford\u2019s appearance.\nBufford argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his appearance at the time of his arrest, specifically a booking *124photograph (or \u201cmug shot\u201d) and testimony from witnesses regarding differences between Bufford\u2019s appearance at the time of arrest and at the time of trial. But Bufford did not object to either the testimony or the admission of the photograph during trial and does not argue on appeal that admitting that evidence was plain error. Consequently, Bufford has waived appellate review of this claim of error. See Brooks v. State, 281 Ga. 514, 516 (2) (640 SE2d 280) (2007) (failure to object to admission of evidence at trial generally constitutes waiver of appellate review); see also OCGA \u00a7 24-1-103 (a) (1), (d) (error shall not be predicated upon ruling admitting evidence unless substantial right of party is affected and timely objection or motion to strike appears of record; however, court may take notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although such errors were not brought to court\u2019s attention).\n3. Ineffective assistance of counsel.\nBufford argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the evidence concerning his appearance, which he contends was irrelevant and should have been excluded under DeCastro v. State, 221 Ga. App. 83 (470 SE2d 748) (1996) (physical precedent only). The record shows that trial counsel instead questioned witnesses on whether the booking photograph reflected Bufford\u2019s regular appearance.\nBufford\u2019s reliance upon DeCastro is flawed. Under Court of Appeals Rule 33 (a), DeCastro is not binding precedent but is merely physical precedent, because one judge concurred only in the judgment. And the record belies Bufford\u2019s assertion that, as in DeCastro, his identity was not at issue in the case. See DeCastro, 221 Ga. App. at 86. Instead, at several points during trial, his counsel posed questions to witnesses which suggested that R. B.\u2019s brother could have been the perpetrator. The admission of the evidence was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. See Fortson v. State, 280 Ga. 376, 379 (2) (628 SE2d 104) (2006) (\u201c[t]he admission of relevant evidence that is challenged on the basis that its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial impact is within the sound discretion of the trial court\u201d) (citation omitted); Smith v. State, 291 Ga. App. 545, 547 (2) (662 SE2d 323) (2008) (\u201c[u]nless the potential for prejudice in the admission of evidence substantially outweighs its probative value, the Georgia rule favors the admission of any relevant evidence, no matter how slight its probative value\u201d) (citation and punctuation omitted). Cf. OCGA \u00a7 24-4-403 (effective January 1, 2013) (allowing for the admission of relevant evidence unless \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion *125of the issues, or misleading the jury or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence\u201d).\nAssuming arguendo that Bufford had a valid objection to the admission of the evidence regarding his former appearance, he did not show that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object.\nTo prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, [an] appellant must show counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced him to the point that a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\n(Citation and punctuation omitted.) Pruitt v. State, 282 Ga. 30, 34 (4) (644 SE2d 837) (2007). In reviewing a trial court\u2019s determination on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we uphold the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous and review the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo. Badie v. State, 317 Ga.App. 712, 717 (2) (732 SE2d 553) (2012).\nIn denying Bufford\u2019s motion for new trial, the trial court determined that \u201c[t]rial counsel\u2019s actions regarding the booking photo and related issues were ones of reasonable trial strategy.\u201d Bufford argues that the court had no basis for this determination because his trial counsel did not testify at the hearing on his motion for new trial. To the extent he suggests that the state was required to present evidence on the issue of trial counsel\u2019s strategy, however, Bufford misapprehends the burden of proof. See McClarity v. State, 234 Ga. App. 348, 350 (3) (506 SE2d 392) (1998). Instead,\n[t]here is a strong presumption that a trial attorney\u2019s performance falls within a wide range of reasonable professional assistance. When trial counsel does not testify at the motion for new trial hearing, the defendant has an extremely difficult task to overcome the presumption. Judicial review of trial counsel\u2019s performance is highly deferential, and trial counsel\u2019s strategy was not unreasonable merely because appellate counsel would have pursued a different strategy.\n(Citations omitted.) Anderson v. State, 274 Ga. 871, 873-874 (4) (560 SE2d 659) (2002).\nGenerally, whether to object to irrelevant evidence is a tactical and strategic decision. See Anderson v. State, 206 Ga. App. 354, 355 (2) (426 SE2d 6) (1992). And \u201c[i]n the absence of contrary evidence, *126defense counsel\u2019s actions are presumed to be part of trial strategy.\u201d (Citations and punctuation omitted.) McClarity, 234 Ga. App. at 351 (3). There is no evidence in this case showing that trial counsel\u2019s actions were not part of her trial strategy; to the contrary, her attempts to explain Bufford\u2019s appearance through the questioning of witnesses suggests that she made a strategic decision about how to handle the state\u2019s evidence about Bufford\u2019s appearance.\nDecided March 6, 2013.\nMcCracken Poston, for appellant.\nHerbert E. Franklin, Jr., District Attorney, Christopher A. Amt, Assistant District Attorney, for appellee.\nOf course, \u201c[t]actics and strategy provide no talismanic protection against an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\u201d (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Benham v. State, 277 Ga. 516, 518 (591 SE2d 824) (2004). There are sometimes decisions that no reasonable trial counsel would make under the circumstances. See, e.g., Hall v. McPherson, 284 Ga. 219, 232 (4) (663 SE2d 659) (2008); Benham, 277 Ga. at 518. But Bufford has not established that his counsel\u2019s decision to question witnesses about changes in his appearance rather than object to the state\u2019s evidence on that point was a decision that no reasonable trial counsel would make under the circumstances of this case. \u201c[Bjecause [Bufford] did not question trial counsel concerning this decision, [he] has failed to carry [his] burden to demonstrate that trial counsel provided deficient performance.\u201d (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Smith v. State, 288 Ga. 348, 353 (8) (d) (703 SE2d 629) (2010). See also Morgan v. State, 276 Ga. 72, 77 (9) (575 SE2d 468) (2003) (affirming trial court\u2019s denial of motion for new trial on ineffective assistance ground, where trial counsel\u2019s action could have been a matter of reasonable trial strategy and trial counsel did not testify at motion for new trial hearing).\nFurthermore, there is no merit in Bufford\u2019s argument that, under Belt v. State, 225 Ga. App. 813 (485 SE2d 39) (1997), he was not allowed to call his trial counsel as a witness to establish that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Belt concerned the prohibition against trial counsel asserting his or her own ineffectiveness while still representing the defendant. Id. at 814-815 (2) (a). Bufford, in contrast, was represented by new, post-conviction counsel at the hearing on his motion for new trial.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\n\nBarnes, P. J., and McMillian, J., concur.\n\n",
