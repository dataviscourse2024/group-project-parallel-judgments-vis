MARBLEY, District Judge. Defendant-Appellant, Sean Lamont Cromer, appeals\nhis conviction by a jury for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. On appeal, Cromer asserts the\nfollowing grounds for reversal: (1) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction; (2) the district\ncourt plainly erred by allowing a witness to testify about hearsay statements made by a confidential\ninformant (\u201cCI\u201d) indicating that Cromer was involved in drug activity; (3) the district court erred by not\nrequiring the production of the CI after admitting the hearsay statements made by the CI; and (4) the district\ncourt erred by allowing Cromer to cross-examine a witness without giving him Faretta warnings.\nJurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. For the following reasons, Cromer\u2019s conviction is\nREVERSED and this case is REMANDED for additional proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n\n\n\n   *\n    The Honorable Algenon L. Marbley, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.\n\n\n                                                             1\n\fNo. 02-2394                 United States v. Cromer                                                      Page 2\n\n\n                                                  I. BACKGROUND\n                                                A. Procedural History\n        On June 6, 2001, a grand jury for the Western District of Michigan returned a two-count indictment\nagainst Cromer based upon the results of a search conducted pursuant to a warrant on March 8, 2001, at a\nresidence located at 3284 Buchanan Avenue in Wyoming, Michigan (the \u201cBuchanan residence\u201d). Count\nI charged Cromer with being a felon in possession of a firearm \u201c[o]n or about March 8, 2001,\u201d in violation\nof 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 921(a), and 924(a)(1). Count II charged Cromer with \u201cknowingly, intentionally\nand unlawfully possess[ing] with intent to distribute . . . cocaine,\u201d in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and\n(b)(1)(C). On July 10, 2001, a grand jury returned a superseding indictment, adding a third count based\nupon a firearm found at the time of Cromer\u2019s arrest, on May 24, 2001. Count III thus charged Cromer with\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm \u201c[o]n or about May 24, 2001.\u201d\n          At the beginning of Cromer\u2019s first trial, the district court granted Cromer\u2019s oral motion to sever the\ndrug charge from the firearms charges and proceeded to try Cromer solely upon the drug charge. Cromer\u2019s\nfirst trial on the possession with intent to distribute charge was held on January 15, 2002, through January\n18, 2002, and resulted in a hung jury. The court declared a mistrial on January 23, 2002. Cromer\u2019s second\ntrial on the drug charge was held on May 21, 2002, through May 24, 2002. Cromer moved for a judgment\nof acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s case and then again moved for a judgment of acquittal at the\nclose of all the evidence. Both motions were denied. The jury found Cromer guilty of the drug charge.\nSubsequently, Cromer and the government entered into a plea agreement regarding the two firearms charges,\nwhereby Cromer agreed to plead guilty to the felon in possession charge contained in Count III and the\ngovernment agreed to dismiss the felon in possession charge contained in Count I.\n        The district court sentenced Cromer to 294 months of imprisonment on Count II, the drug charge,\nand 96 months of imprisonment on Count III, the firearms charge. On November 21, 2002, Cromer filed\na timely notice of appeal of his judgment of conviction on the possession with intent to distribute cocaine\ncharge. In his plea agreement, Cromer waived the right to appeal his conviction and sentence on the felon\nin possession charge contained in Count III, and he does not raise any issues on appeal regarding his\nconviction or sentence on that charge.\n                                               B. Factual Background1\n                                           1. Evidence of Cromer\u2019s Guilt\n       On March 8, 2001, a search warrant was executed at the Buchanan residence, during the course of\nwhich the following incriminating evidence was discovered:\n          (1)      a \u201cpocket tech digital scale,\u201d rolling paper, and razor blades in a kitchen cupboard;\n          (2)      a shoe box containing a pan and knife covered in cocaine residue, a small bag of suspected\n                   marijuana, a small bag of cocaine, and small baggies in a cupboard or pantry;\n          (3)      two electric mixers\u2013one that had cocaine residue on it and one that did not have any cocaine\n                   residue on it\u2013in a kitchen cupboard;\n          (4)      $8,500 in cash inside an oven mitt that was resting between the refrigerator and its handle;\n          (5)      a loaded gun in the basement;\n\n\n   1\n       The following factual background is taken from testimony provided during Cromer\u2019s second trial.\n\fNo. 02-2394             United States v. Cromer                                                         Page 3\n\n\n       (6)     a large glass tube containing cocaine residue in a hidden corner of a kitchen cabinet;\n       (7)     a coffee grinder caked with cocaine residue; and\n       (8)     some apparent drug tabulations, mixed in with thirty to forty documents that appeared to be\n               Cromer\u2019s.\n       At trial, the government introduced evidence that Cromer\u2019s fingerprints were found on the mixer\nwith the cocaine residue, the gun, and a Pyrex dish with no cocaine residue; that Cromer had spent at least\nsome time at the residence for the stated purpose of house sitting; that the interior of the Buchanan residence\nwas consistent with the sort of \u201cstash house\u201d often used by distributors of crack cocaine; and that Cromer,\nwhen he was arrested, had on his person almost $4,000 in cash for which he provided inconsistent\nexplanations.\n                                          2. Hearsay Statements\n        On direct examination of Maureen O\u2019Brien, the officer in charge of the investigation of the\nBuchanan residence, the prosecutor asked, \u201cWere you in charge of the investigation that led to charges\nagainst Sean Cromer?\u201d The prosecutor also asked, \u201cWhat was your role in that?\u201d O\u2019Brien stated in\nresponse, \u201cMy partner and I, Officer Galloway, back in January of 2001, had information about 3284\nBuchanan. And we began an investigation about this residence being associated with selling drugs.\u201d The\nprosecutor then asked, \u201cBy investigating the place, did you come up with enough information that a state\ncourt judge gave you an order to go and have the place searched?\u201d O\u2019Brien responded by saying, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n       The prosecutor also engaged in the following colloquy with O\u2019Brien:\n       Q       ....\n               Was there a period or a time set where you would meet with other officers that were\n               going to assist you in getting ready to conduct the search of Buchanan Street?\n       A       Yes. . . .\n       ....\n       Q       Now, during the course of that meeting, from the information available to you, did\n               some names come up or some descriptions of people come up that you told the\n               officers you thought might be there?\n       A       Yes.\n       Q       And can you tell us what was the name or names that you had of people that were\n               associated with that place from your investigation that you told the officers to be on\n               the lookout for?\n       A       Well, the focus of our investigation were [sic] for two subjects: one being a person\n               nicknamed Nut, which is Mr. Sean Cromer. The second individual who was the\n               subject of this investigation was Quincy Hatcher.\n       Q       Now you knew the name Nut. Did you know the defendant\u2019s nickname before the\n               date of the search?\n       A       Yes.\n\fNo. 02-2394                  United States v. Cromer                                                       Page 4\n\n\n          Q        And what was the nickname that you knew him by?\n          A        Peanut.\n          Q        Did you actually know his name as Sean Cromer before the search?\n          A        Not until we got inside.\nThe prosecutor then proceeded to question O\u2019Brien regarding the search. Neither the prosecutor nor\nO\u2019Brien mentioned during this line of questioning that O\u2019Brien had received a tip from an informant.\n      On cross examination, the following exchange took place between Cromer\u2019s defense counsel and\nO\u2019Brien:\n          Q        And in this particular affidavit, you talked about an informant who had gone into the\n                   home at Buchanan and saw cocaine being purchased there. Is that correct?\n          A        That\u2019s correct.\n          ....\n          Q        And that within the past 36 hours of the time that you prepared your affidavit, that\n                   your informant had been in that house?\n          A        Yes.\n          Q        So when I asked you [the] question about purchasing drugs, you\u2019re swearing to\n                   Judge Timmers that actually he had been in there within -- I say he -- he or she had\n                   been in within 36 hours and could purchase drugs and saw drugs there?\n          A        That\u2019s correct.\n          ....\n          Q        Was there surveillance of the home within 36 hours?\n          A        Yes, there was.\n          ....\n          Q        During this 36 hours, did you see Sean Cromer either go into or come out of that\n                   home?\n          A        I did not see him physically, no.\n          Then, still on cross examination, the following exchange took place between Cromer and O\u2019Brien2:\n\n          Q        Did the informant give you the description of the person?\n          A        Of both people, yes.\n\n\n   2\n       At this point, Cromer was conducting the cross examination with his counsel\u2019s assistance.\n\fNo. 02-2394             United States v. Cromer                                                       Page 5\n\n\n      Q       He said both people?\n      A       Yes.\n      Q       Did he give you a description of Mr. Cromer?\n      A       Yes.\n      Q       He did?\n      A       Um-hum.\n      Q       Did the informant give you the name of the person doing the selling?\n      A       Yes.\n      Q       So the informant --\n              THE COURT: Just a minute. Let\u2019s have a side bar over here.\n      ....\n              THE COURT: Mr. Cromer, you\u2019re killing yourself.\n              DEFENDANT CROMER: No, I ain\u2019t.\n             MR. COURTADE [government\u2019s counsel]: I was about to object to hearsay, but\n      you\u2019re going to open the door to allowing me to respond to what did the informant say about\n      you, and that could hurt you definitely.\n              DEFENDANT CROMER: But what I\u2019m leading to is the affidavit. You made a[n]\n      affidavit; and, in the affidavit, you gave a description. It never said nothing about the two\n      people. You said one person.\n      ....\n              THE COURT: . . . . What I\u2019m concerned about is I don\u2019t know what the next\n      question is going to be. But if the next question is did -- she said that, yes, the informant\n      identified -- described you, that never would have come in otherwise.\n              DEFENDANT CROMER: She didn\u2019t say he described me.\n              THE COURT: She just did.\n              DEFENDANT CROMER: Okay. I can go back to other testimony where she said\n      that the informant didn\u2019t describe nobody.\n              THE COURT: Okay. Okay. So that would discredit her. I just want to --\n              DEFENDANT CROMER: She before that, she didn\u2019t know nothing about me.\n              THE COURT: Okay.\n              (End of bench conference. In open court:)\n\fNo. 02-2394              United States v. Cromer                                                      Page 6\n\n\n       ....\n       BY DEFENDANT CROMER:\n       ....\n       Q       And was your statement truthful and factual when you said that the person who gave\n               the description of the person selling the drugs was a 25-year-old?\n       A       Yes. That was -- yes.\n       Q       Did it prove to be true?\n       A       I\u2019m sorry?\n       Q       Did it prove to be true that it was a 25-year-old doing the selling?\n       ....\n       A       Well --\n              MR. COURTADE: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object because that\u2019s a conclusion I\n       believe that the jury is being called upon to make. It would be improper for her to give her\n       own opinion.\n               THE COURT: I think the question can be rephrased. But sustained as to the form\n       of that question.\nAfter the district court sustained this objection, Cromer moved to a different line of questioning.\n      Subsequently, on redirect, the following exchange occurred between the government\u2019s counsel and\nO\u2019Brien:\n       A       The description was for a black male, darker skinned, five-seven, 200 pounds, and\n               25 years.\n       Q       Now, who provided that? It was alluded to that you provided that description.\n               Where did that description come from?\n       A       That description came from the informant.\n       Q       That was not your description to the Judge. That was the informant\u2019s description?\n       A       That\u2019s correct.\n       Q       Now, how does that description compare with Quincy Hatcher?\n       A       He\u2019s more -- Mr. Cromer is stockier, smaller and stockier. Mr. Hatcher is like five-\n               eleven, 150 pounds. He\u2019s more of a bean pole than stocky.\n       Q       So the description that you provided, which of the two individuals that you know --\n               Quincy Hatcher and Sean Cromer -- who does it more -- the informant\u2019s description\n               more closely match?\n       A       It more accurately depicts Mr. Cromer.\n\fNo. 02-2394            United States v. Cromer                                                             Page 7\n\n\n       In his rebuttal closing statement, the government\u2019s counsel commented on the description of Cromer\nprovided by the informant. The government\u2019s counsel stated,\n       This individual was a confidential informant. But what they have said was pretty darn\n       accurate. Okay. They\u2019re off by ten years on age. I\u2019m not a very good judge of age. Mr.\n       Kaczor [defense counsel] kept saying it was Ms. O\u2019Brien\u2019s description. She did not describe\n       him. It was the informant\u2019s description. Black male, 25, five-seven, 200 pounds.\n                                   3. Cromer\u2019s Participation at Trial\n        During defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of O\u2019Brien, defense counsel indicated to the court that\nCromer wanted to participate in the cross-examination of O\u2019Brien, and possibly the examination of other\nwitnesses and closing argument. While Cromer\u2019s participation was being discussed, the government\u2019s\ncounsel stated, \u201cUnless his questions are scripted and defense counsel has looked at them, it could open\ndoors to other evidence that he might not want to have come in.\u201d Initially the district judge was not going\nto allow Cromer to cross-examine O\u2019Brien because defense counsel had already started cross examining\nher, though the judge indicated that he would allow Cromer to examine other witness and participate in\nclosing argument. Defense counsel, however, again raised Cromer\u2019s concerns. At a side bar during defense\ncounsel\u2019s cross-examination of O\u2019Brien, the following exchange took place:\n               MR. KACZOR [defense counsel]: . . . . Mr. Cromer is upset, basically saying that\n       he has a number of questions that he believes I am covering at this point but that he would\n       cover them in a much more effective manner. So he doesn\u2019t want me to ask those questions.\n       He wants me to stop asking questions so that he can then ask the questions himself.\n       ....\n       THE COURT: . . . .\n               Mr. Cromer, what would you -- I\u2019m going to give about a five-minute demonstration\n       here -- give you a chance for a five-minute demonstration to see what you\u2019re going to do.\n       This is a new legal issue to me. You have the right to try your case without a lawyer. I don\u2019t\n       know that you can try your case 50 percent without a lawyer. But let\u2019s see what you do here.\n        After the court had excused the jury, the district judge allowed Cromer to practice cross examining\nO\u2019Brien. During this practice, the district judge told Cromer that he was being argumentative and also\nindicated that one of his questions was inappropriate. Cromer stated during this practice, \u201cI can always\nconsult my counsel as far as anything that may be something that shouldn\u2019t be appropriately asked.\u201d Then,\nthe following dialogue ensued:\n               THE COURT: Let me just tell you my observations about it. I think that, quite\n       frankly, you\u2019re respectful when you ask questions, and I think you\u2019re doing your best to ask\n       the questions. You have to be careful about being argumentative. From my perspective,\n       looking at it as a judge -- and I\u2019m not the judge of the facts in this case -- your client -- or,\n       your counsel is more effective than you are in asking the questions. But it\u2019s your case. As\n       you say, you are the person facing a heavy jail sentence if you get convicted. All I can do\n       and all your lawyer can do is give you advice; although, I could prevent you from asking\n       questions. But it does not seem to be a disruptive procedure to me.\n               I\u2019m willing to hear both the government and Mr. Kaczor on this.\n       ....\n               MR. COURTADE: I guess our basic position is we\u2019ll try anything once.\n\fNo. 02-2394             United States v. Cromer                                                           Page 8\n\n\n                THE COURT: Well, it\u2019s different. But, you know, it\u2019s his life. And if he\u2019s more\n       comfortable doing this, and if he behaves appropriately, -- and I am questioning a little bit\n       . . . a person has the right to represent himself. What has never been decided, as far as I\n       know, is can he represent himself 50 percent or 65 percent or 35 percent. I don\u2019t know.\n       ....\n               MR. KACZOR: In this circuit, I have been appointed as what the Court calls stand-\n       by counsel on some of these tax protester cases. Essentially, what I have done is sat by and\n       advised the defendant, given him my best advice. And at times, the defendant questioned\n       witnesses; and at times, I questioned witnesses. I think that\u2019s somewhat what Mr. Cromer\n       wants. . . . It\u2019s somewhat frustrating to me to represent him and get all these questions he\n       wants. I think there is more to just what\u2019s on the written page. I think it\u2019s important to allow\n       him to continue if that\u2019s what he wants.\n               THE COURT: All right.\n              MR. COURTADE: Your Honor, what I would -- again, what I do not want is the\n       tag-team approach when both of them get up.\n               THE COURT: Mr. Cromer is going to have to finish it.\n       ....\n              THE COURT: I\u2019ll give him any opportunity to consult with Mr. Kaczor when he\n       wants, too. For example, if there is an objection, sometimes a simple rephrasing of the\n       question can take care of it. And so you\u2019ll be literally stand-by counsel, Mr. Kaczor, because\n       I want you to stand right next to him while he does this.\n             MR. KACZOR: I have no objection to whatever the Court would like to do to\n       accommodate Mr. Cromer.\n               THE COURT: All right.\n               Mr. Cromer, do you want to do it that way?\n              DEFENDANT CROMER: He can sit down, or he can stand next to me. I don\u2019t have\n       a problem with it. Basically, the questions is [sic] \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d questions.\n       ....\n               THE COURT: I\u2019ll have the jury come back, and I\u2019ll explain to them that Mr. Cromer\n       wants to take a more active role in his own defense. And he is not firing his counsel or\n       anything, but he wants to ask the questions and that Kaczor will be standing by Mr. Cromer\n       to help him phrase the questions correctly and to consult with Mr. Cromer whenever he\n       wants.\nThe district judge stated several times both in and out of the presence of the jury that Cromer was not firing\nhis counsel. After Cromer conducted a large portion of the cross-examination of O\u2019Brien, the district judge,\noutside the presence of the jury, told Cromer and his counsel to speed up the cross-examination and\nindicated on the record \u201cthat there are long discussions before each -- almost every question now.\u201d The\ncourt instructed defense counsel to \u201cgo over\u201d the rest of the questions with Cromer, and defense counsel did\nso. Additionally, on redirect examination of O\u2019Brien, the district judge allowed defense counsel to make\n\fNo. 02-2394                 United States v. Cromer                                                                       Page 9\n\n\nobjections on behalf of Cromer, and it appears that defense counsel conducted the recross-examination of\nO\u2019Brien.\n                                                       II. ANALYSIS\n         Cromer argues that his conviction cannot stand for the following reasons: (1) there was insufficient\nevidence to support his conviction; (2) the district court plainly erred by allowing a witness to testify about\nhearsay statements made by a confidential informant (\u201cCI\u201d) implicating Cromer in drug activity; (3) the\ndistrict court erred by not requiring the production of the CI after admitting the hearsay statements made\nby the CI; and (4) the district court erred by allowing Cromer to cross-examine a witness without giving\nFaretta warnings.\n        In light of Crawford v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004), decided after the briefing in this case\nwas complete, the Court holds that statements of a confidential informant are testimonial in nature and\ntherefore may not be offered by the government to establish the guilt of an accused absent an opportunity\nfor the accused to cross-examine the informant. The government in this case did offer certain statements\nmade by a CI for the purpose of establishing the truth of the matter asserted. The admission of these\nstatements amounted to plain error, so Cromer\u2019s conviction must be reversed.\n         On retrial, because the district court may face issues regarding Cromer\u2019s participation in his defense\nthat are similar to the issues encountered in the previous trial, the Court also decides Defendant-Appellant\u2019s\nFaretta claim in order to provide guidance to the district court on remand. Due to our resolution of the\nConfrontation Clause issue, however, we need not reach either of the other matters raised by Cromer on\nappeal.\n                                                A. Confrontation Clause\n        The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment states, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused\nshall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VI. Prior\nto Crawford v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004), the admissibility of out-of-court statements under the\nConfrontation Clause was governed by Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980). According to Roberts, an\nunavailable witness\u2019s out-of-court statement could be admitted against the accused if the statement had\nadequate indicia of reliability. Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66. A statement was considered to have sufficient\nindicia of reliability if it either fell within a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or bore \u201cparticularized\nguarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Id.\n        Crawford involved a tape-recorded statement given by the defendant\u2019s wife to the police describing\nthe stabbing with which the defendant was charged. Pursuant to the state marital privilege, the defendant\u2019s\nwife did not testify at trial, so the defendant had no opportunity to cross-examine her. The statement\nnevertheless was admitted at trial, over the defendant\u2019s objections, because the trial court determined that\nthe statement had \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66.\n        The Supreme Court, in Crawford, introduced a fundamental re-conception of the Confrontation\nClause. The Court reaffirmed the importance of the confrontation right and introduced a distinction between\ntestimonial and nontestimonial statements for Confrontation Clause purposes: \u201cWhere testimonial\nstatements are involved, we do not think the Framers meant to leave the Sixth Amendment\u2019s      protection to\nthe vagaries of the rules of evidence, much less to amorphous notions of \u2018reliability.\u2019\u201d3 Crawford, 124 S.\nCt. at 1370. The Court based this distinction on the word \u201cwitnesses\u201d in the Clause, which refers to those\nwho \u201cbear testimony.\u201d Id. at 1364 (quoting 1 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language\n\n    3\n      The Court found the admission of statements deemed reliable by a judge to be fundamentally at odds with the right of\nconfrontation: \u201cDispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because\na defendant is obviously guilty. This is not what the Sixth Amendment prescribes.\u201d Crawford at 1370-71.\n\fNo. 02-2394                   United States v. Cromer                                                                    Page 10\n\n\n(1828)). Ultimately, the Court\u2019s holding was that testimonial, out-of-court statements offered against the\naccused to establish the truth of the matter asserted may only be admitted where the declarant is unavailable\nand where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. Id. at 1369, 1374.\nWhile the Court declined to \u201cspell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial,\u2019\u201d it stated that the term\n\u201capplies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial;\nand to police interrogations.\u201d Id. at 1374. The Court found that the defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s tape-recorded\nstatement was \u201ctestimonial under any definition,\u201d id. at 1370, and accordingly reversed the defendant\u2019s\nconviction, id. at 1374.\n        There are three categories of statements in the case sub judice that the Confrontation Clause arguably\nshould have excluded. First is the testimony provided by O\u2019Brien in the government\u2019s case-in-chief in\nwhich O\u2019Brien describes the commencement of the investigation based on information she and her partner\nhad regarding the Buchanan residence. Second is testimony O\u2019Brien provided on direct examination\nrelating to information she had before the search on a man nicknamed \u201cNut.\u201d Third is O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony,\ngiven on redirect examination, in which she furnishes and discusses the physical description given to her\nby the CI. The description was for an alleged drug distributor operating out of the Buchanan residence.\nO\u2019Brien stated on redirect, and the government argued in closing, that the description more closely matched\nCromer than Hatcher.\n         At trial, Cromer did not object to any of these statements. When an appellant fails to object to an\nerror in the district court, this Court reviews for plain error. Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b) (\u201cA plain error that\naffects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d);\nUnited States v. Koeberlein, 161 F.3d 946, 949 (6th Cir. 1998). Plain error review applies even if the\nforfeited assignment of error is a constitutional error. United States v. Jones, 108 F.3d 668, 676 (6th Cir.\n1997). Pursuant to plain error review, an appellate court may only correct an error not raised at trial if there\nis \u201c(1) \u2018error,\u2019 (2) that is \u2018plain,\u2019 and (3) that \u2018affect[s] substantial rights.\u2019\u201d Johnson v. United States, 520\nU.S. 461, 466-67 (1997) (quoting United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993)). \u201cIf all three conditions\nare met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error\n\u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d Johnson at 467\n(quoting Olano, 507 U.S. at 732) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n         The threshold determination that we must make is whether the statements of a confidential informant\nto police are \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature. While the Crawford Court did not provide a comprehensive definition\nof \u201ctestimonial,\u201d it did provide some guidance in the matter. For example, the Court noted that \u201ctestimony\u201d\nmay be defined as \u201c[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving\nsome fact.\u201d Crawford at 1364 (quoting 1 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language\n(1828)). The Court emphasized that, \u201c[a]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers\nbears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.\u201d Id. at\n1364. The 4Court mentioned various formulations that had been proposed to define the class of \u201ctestimonial\u201d\nstatements but found no need to choose among those formulations since \u201c[s]tatements taken by police\n\n\n    4\n        The Court included the following \u201cformulations of this core class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements\u201d:\n                    \u201cex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent\u2013that is, material such as affidavits,\n                    custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or\n                    similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used\n                    prosecutorially,\u201d Brief for Petitioner 23; \u201cextrajudicial statements . . . contained in formalized\n                    testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions,\u201d White\n                    v. Illinois, 502 U.S. 346, 365, 112 S. Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992) (THOMAS, J., joined\n                    by SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); \u201cstatements that were made\n                    under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the\n                    statement would be available for use at a later trial,\u201d Brief for National Association of\n                    Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 3.\n\fNo. 02-2394             United States v. Cromer                                                         Page 11\n\n\nofficers in the course of interrogations,\u201d such as the defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s tape-recorded statement, are\n\u201ctestimonial under even a narrow standard.\u201d Id. at 1364 (\u201cPolice interrogations bear a striking resemblance\nto examinations by justices of the peace in England.\u201d).\n        The Court examined the historical underpinnings of the Confrontation Clause, concluding that \u201cthe\nprincipal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure,\nand particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.\u201d Id. at 1363. The Court\ndetailed one of the \u201cmost notorious instances of civil-law examination\u201d\u2013the 1603 trial of Sir Walter Raleigh\nfor treason. Id. at 1360. There, Lord Cobham, Raleigh\u2019s alleged accomplice, had implicated Raleigh in an\nexamination before the Privy Council and in a letter. Id. Raleigh argued that Cobham had lied to save\nhimself and demanded the right to confront his accuser face-to-face. Id. Raleigh\u2019s judges refused to call\nCobham to appear, and Raleigh was found guilty and sentenced to death. Id. Out of such abuses was the\nEnglish right of confrontation, used as a model for our Confrontation Clause, born. Id.\n         Additional guidance may be found by looking to the sources upon which the Crawford Court relied\nin framing its re-definition of the Confrontation Clause. For example, the Court cites to works by two\nleading constitutional scholars\u2013Professor Akhil Reed Amar of Yale Law School and Professor Richard\nFriedman of University of Michigan Law School\u2013both of whom have been closely associated with the\ntestimonial approach to the Confrontation Clause. Professor Amar contends that the Clause encompasses\n\u201cthose \u2018witnesses\u2019 who testify either by taking the stand in person or via government-prepared affidavits,\ndepositions, videotapes, and the like.\u201d Akhil Reed Amar, Confrontation Clause First Principles: A Reply\nto Professor Friedman, 86 Geo. L.J. 1045, 1045 (1998). Professor Friedman, in contrast, urges a broader\ndefinition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d that would include any statement \u201cmade in circumstances in which a reasonable\nperson would realize that it likely would be used in investigation or prosecution of a crime.\u201d Richard D.\nFriedman & Bridget McCormack, Dial-In Testimony, 150 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1171, 1240-41 (2002). Based on\nhis proposed definition, Friedman offers five rules of thumb:\n        A statement made knowingly to the authorities that describes criminal activity is almost\n        always testimonial. A statement made by a person claiming to be the victim of a crime and\n        describing the crime is usually testimonial, whether made to the authorities or not. If, in the\n        case of a crime committed over a short period of time, a statement is made before the crime\n        is committed, it almost certainly is not testimonial. A statement made by one participant in\n        a criminal enterprise to another, intended to further the enterprise, is not testimonial. And\n        neither is a statement made in the course of going about one\u2019s ordinary business, made\n        before the criminal act has occurred or with no recognition that it relates to criminal activity.\nRichard D. Friedman, Confrontation: The Search for Basic Principles, 86 Geo. L.J. 1011, 1042-43 (1998)\n[hereinafter Friedman, Confrontation].\n        Since Crawford, other Circuits have begun to work toward developing a more comprehensive\ndefinition of \u201ctestimonial.\u201d See United States v. Saget, 377 F.3d 223, 228 (2d Cir. 2004) (\u201cCrawford at least\nsuggests that the determinative factor in determining whether a declarant bears testimony is the declarant\u2019s\nawareness or expectation that his or her statements may later be used at a trial.\u201d); see also Horton v. Allen,\n370 F.3d 75, 84 (1st Cir. 2004) (finding statements made in private conversation between private individuals\nnot to be testimonial because \u201c[t]hey were not ex-parte in-court testimony or its equivalent; were not\ncontained in formalized documents such as affidavits, depositions, or prior testimony transcripts; and were\nnot made as part of a confession resulting from custodial examination\u201d and they were not made \u201cunder\ncircumstances in which an objective person would \u2018reasonably believe that the statement would be available\nfor use at a later trial\u2019\u201d (quoting Crawford, 124 S. Ct. at 1364)). In United States v. Silva, 380 F.3d 1018\n(7th Cir. 2004), the Seventh Circuit denounced the practice of law enforcement officials, under the guise\n\n\nCrawford at 1364.\n\fNo. 02-2394                 United States v. Cromer                                                                    Page 12\n\n\nof demonstrating the reason for a particular investigation, testifying at trial as to statements made by\nconfidential informants. The court strongly suggested that statements by a CI are testimonial in nature:\n         Under the prosecution\u2019s theory, every time a person says to the police \u201cX committed the\n         crime,\u201d the statement (including all corroborating details) would be admissible to show why\n         the police investigated X. That would eviscerate the constitutional right to confront and\n         cross-examine one\u2019s accusers. See Crawford v. Washington, --- U.S. ----, 124 S. Ct. 1354,\n         158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).\nSilva, 380 F.3d at 1020.\n        We find the definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d proposed by Professor Friedman to be both well-reasoned\nand wholly consistent with the purpose behind the Confrontation Clause. As emphasized by Crawford, the\nConfrontation Clause refers to those who bear testimony against an accused. Statements \u201cmade to the\nauthorities who will use them in investigating and prosecuting a crime, . . . made with the full understanding\nthat they will be so used,\u201d are precisely the sort of accusatory statements the Confrontation Clause was\ndesigned to address. Friedman, Confrontation, 86 Geo. L.J. at 1025. Certainly Lord Cobham, who accused\nSir Walter Raleigh of treason, fell into this category.\n        Professor Friedman\u2019s definition is somewhat broader than Professor Amar\u2019s definition, which would\nimplicate the Confrontation Clause only in the instance of formalized statements\u2013such as affidavits,\ndepositions, and government-prepared recordings\u2013made directly to the authorities. As explained by\nProfessor Friedman, however, the broader definition \u201cis necessary to ensure that the adjudicative system\ndoes not effectively invite witnesses to testify in informal ways that avoid confrontation.\u201d Friedman,\nConfrontation, 86 Geo. L.J. at 1043. The Crawford Court found the absence of an oath not to be\ndeterminative in considering whether a statement is testimonial. Crawford, 124 S. Ct. at 1364-65. We are\nunable to discern how the additional formalities identified by Professor Amar are necessary components of\na testimonial statement.\n        Indeed, the danger to a defendant might well be greater if the statement introduced at trial, without\na right of confrontation, is a statement volunteered to police rather than a statement elicited through\nformalized police interrogation. One can imagine the temptation that someone who bears a grudge might\nhave to volunteer to police, truthfully or not, information of the commission of a crime, especially when that\nperson is assured he will not be subject to confrontation. Professor Friedman\u2019s concern becomes especially\nmeaningful in such a context. If the judicial system only requires cross-examination when someone has\nformally served as a witness against a defendant, then witnesses     and those who deal with them will have\nevery incentive to ensure that testimony is given informally.5 The proper inquiry, then, is whether the\ndeclarant intends to bear testimony against the accused. That intent, in turn, may be determined by querying\nwhether a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would anticipate his statement being used against\nthe accused in investigating and prosecuting the crime.\n         Considered within such a framework, statements of a confidential informant are testimonial. Indeed,\nsuch statements fall squarely within Professor Friedman\u2019s paradigm: \u201cA statement made knowingly to the\nauthorities that describes criminal activity is almost always testimonial.\u201d Friedman, Confrontation, 86 Geo.\nL.J. at 1042. Tips provided by confidential informants are knowingly and purposely made to authorities,\naccuse someone of a crime, and often are used against the accused at trial. The very fact that the informant\nis confidential\u2013i.e., that not even his identity is disclosed to the defendant\u2013heightens the dangers involved\nin allowing a declarant to bear testimony without confrontation. The allowance of anonymous accusations\nof crime without any opportunity for cross-examination would make a mockery of the Confrontation Clause.\n\n    5\n      Professor Friedman gives the example of a private rape counselor who is able to assure a victim that she may give a\nvideotaped statement, without going under oath, that will be provided to prosecutors and used against the perpetrator with little\nrisk that she will have to testify in court and face cross-examination. Friedman, Confrontation, 86 Geo. L.J. at 1040-41.\n\fNo. 02-2394                 United States v. Cromer                                                   Page 13\n\n\nCf. Silva, 380 F.3d at 1020 (\u201cThis court has warned against the potential for abuse when police testify to\nthe out-of-court statements of a confidential informant.\u201d).\n       Given that statements by a confidential informant are testimonial and thus are subject to the dictates\nof the Confrontation Clause, the next question is whether any of the testimony provided by O\u2019Brien\nimplicates the Clause. For purposes of this analysis, the objectionable statements made by O\u2019Brien may\nbe divided into three categories. The first set of objectionable testimony was provided in the following\nexchange in O\u2019Brien\u2019s direct examination:\n          Q        ....\n                   Were you in charge of the investigation that led to charges against Sean Cromer?\n          A        Yes.\n          Q        What was your role in that?\n          A        My partner and I, Officer Galloway, back in January of 2001, had information about\n                   3284 Buchanan. And we began an investigation about this residence being\n                   associated with selling drugs.\n          Q        By investigating the place, did you come up with enough information that a state\n                   court judge gave you an order to go and have the place searched?\n          A        Yes.\n        Cromer\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights were not violated by this testimony. This exchange at least\narguably did not even put before the jury any statements made by the CI. See United States v. Dunbar, No.\n02-10564, 2004 WL 1614932, at *1 (9th Cir. July 19, 2004) (finding no Confrontation Clause violation\nwhere no testimonial evidence provided by CI was ever introduced into evidence); United States v. Stone,\n222 F.R.D. 334, 339 (E.D. Tenn. 2004) (same). Even if testimonial statements of an out-of-court declarant\nwere revealed by this testimony, Cromer\u2019s confrontation right was not implicated because the testimony was\nprovided merely by way of background. See United States v. Martin, 897 F.2d 1368, 1371-72 (6th Cir.\n1990) (finding Confrontation Clause not implicated where assertions not offered for their content, but\nmerely to explain why government commenced investigation). The Confrontation Clause \u201cdoes not bar the\nuse of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d\nCrawford, 124 S. Ct. at 1369 n.9 (citing Tennessee v. Street, 471 U.S. 409, 414 (1985)). Any out-of-court\nstatements alluded to by O\u2019Brien at this juncture served the purpose of explaining how certain events came\nto pass or why the officers took the actions they did.6 Because the statements were not offered to establish\nthe truth of the matter asserted, the Confrontation Clause does not apply.\n        The second category of testimony that potentially violated the Confrontation Clause includes\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s statements, also provided on direct examination, regarding information about a person nicknamed\n\u201cNut.\u201d When asked what names she had, prior to executing the search, of persons involved with illegal\nactivities at the Buchanan residence, O\u2019Brien replied, \u201cWell, the focus of our investigation were [sic] for\ntwo subjects: one being a person nicknamed Nut, which is Mr. Sean Cromer. The second individual who\nwas the subject of this investigation was Quincy Hatcher.\u201d This testimony was not offered merely to\nexplain why a government investigation was undertaken or to demonstrate the effect of the out-of-court\nstatements on the officers. Cf. Martin, 897 F.2d at 1371 (\u201cIn some circumstances, out of court statements\noffered for the limited purpose of explaining why a government investigation was undertaken have been\ndetermined not to be hearsay.\u201d). Rather, the purpose of this testimony could only have been to help\n\n   6\n       For the same reason, O\u2019Brien\u2019s statements here also did not contain inadmissible hearsay.\n\fNo. 02-2394                  United States v. Cromer                                                               Page 14\n\n\nestablish that the person nicknamed \u201cNut\u201d  or \u201cPeanut,\u201d which the prosecution demonstrated elsewhere in\nthe trial was Sean Cromer\u2019s nickname,7 had been involved with the illegal drug activity occurring at the\nBuchanan residence. See United States v. Fountain, 2 F.3d 656, 669 (6th Cir. 1993) (concluding that, where\nthe reason for focusing officers\u2019 search on a particular room was not at issue in the case, out-of-court\nstatement purportedly offered to establish that reason was, in actuality, offered to prove the truth of the\nmatter asserted); Stewart v. Cowan, 528 F.2d 79, 86 n.4 (6th Cir. 1976) (finding Confrontation Clause and\nhearsay violations where out-of-court statements implicated defendant as the perpetrator of the crime and\nthus went \u201cto the very heart of the prosecutor\u2019s case\u201d).\n        Crawford held that when testimonial, out-of-court statements of an unavailable declarant are offered\nto prove the truth of the matter asserted, the admission of those statements violates the Confrontation Clause\nunless the defendant has had an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony about\n\u201cNut\u201d is distinguishable from her earlier background testimony for several reasons. Not only did the\ntestimony about \u201cNut\u201d more clearly place before the jury information provided by a CI, but this second\ncategory of testimony also implicated Cromer in a way that went \u201cto the very heart of the prosecutor\u2019s case.\u201d\nStewart, 528 F.2d at 86 n.4. In the earlier testimony, O\u2019Brien had merely stated that she \u201chad information\u201d\nabout the Buchanan residence that led her to begin an investigation. O\u2019Brien thus alluded, in the vaguest\npossible terms, to the statements made to her by a CI; she also manifestly linked those out-of-court\nstatements with action taken by her and her partner. Furthermore, that brief explanation for why the\ngovernment began its investigation of the Buchanan residence at least arguably provided some assistance\nto the jury in understanding the background of the case.\n        O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony about \u201cNut,\u201d by contrast, explicitly, albeit not directly, informed the jury that\nsomeone had implicated Nut in illegal activities. The prosecutor attempted      to link this statement by a CI\nwith an action taken by O\u2019Brien; however, any such linkage is a sham.8 The central issue at Cromer\u2019s trial\nwas not whether illegal activity occurred at the Buchanan residence, but whether Cromer knowingly\nparticipated in that illegal activity. The evidence on this point was so tenuous that the jury in Cromer\u2019s first\ntrial was unable to convict him.9 Because there was no dispute as to the subjects of the government\u2019s\ninvestigation or the reason those subjects were believed to be involved, evidence that the government\nfocused its investigation on Nut is helpful to the jury only insofar as it relates to the difficult question of\nwhether Cromer was involved in the illegal activity. See Silva, 380 F.3d at 1020 (\u201cIf a jury would not\notherwise understand why an investigation targeted a particular defendant, the testimony could dispel an\naccusation that the officers were officious intermeddlers staking out [the defendant] for nefarious purposes.\nNo such argument was made in this case, however, and no other explanation was given why the testimony\nwould be relevant.\u201d); Fountain, 2 F.3d at 669 (finding the only possible conclusion to be that statement was\noffered for truth where purported reason for offering statement was to establish immaterial issue); Stewart,\n528 F.2d at 88 (finding the admission of highly inculpatory out-of-court statement to violate Confrontation\nClause). In other words, we are forced to conclude that the purpose of this testimony was to establish the\ntruth of the matter asserted: to prove that Cromer was, indeed, involved in the illegal activity, as stated by\nthe CI. Because there was a testimonial, out-of-court statement, offered to establish the truth of the matter\nasserted, and Cromer was provided no opportunity to cross-examine the CI, Cromer\u2019s Sixth Amendment\nconfrontation right was violated by the introduction of this second set of testimony.\n\n    7\n        For example, Cromer\u2019s girlfriend, Felicia Crawford, testified that she knew Cromer only as \u201cPeanut.\u201d\n    8\n      The government\u2019s counsel, rather than asking O\u2019Brien what information she had about suspects, asked her what suspects\nshe told the officers conducting the search to be on the lookout for.\n    9\n      The evidence of Cromer\u2019s guilt boils down to the following: (1) Cromer had spent some amount of time in the Buchanan\nresidence; (2) alleged drug tabulations were found among paperwork containing Cromer\u2019s name; (3) Cromer\u2019s fingerprint was\nfound on a mixer that had cocaine residue; (4) Cromer\u2019s fingerprint was found on a loaded gun in the basement of the Buchanan\nresidence; and (5) Cromer had almost $4,000 in cash on his person when he was arrested, over two months after the raid on the\nBuchanan residence.\n\fNo. 02-2394                 United States v. Cromer                                                                   Page 15\n\n\n        The third category of objectionable testimony is O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony on redirect examination\nregarding the physical description provided by the CI. As we have already established, the out-of-court\nstatements of the CI were testimonial in nature, and Cromer had no opportunity to cross-examine the CI.\nMoreover, the physical description was provided to the jury for the purpose of establishing the truth of the\nmatter asserted\u2013that   Cromer, who met the description, had participated in the illegal activity at the Buchanan\nresidence.10 The only question regarding this third set of testimony is whether the fact that Cromer opened\nthe door to this testimony somehow acts to preclude the testimony from violating the Confrontation Clause.\nThe government argues that any error in the admission of this testimony is error that Cromer invited or\nprovoked as part of a failed defense strategy and, thus is not reversible error. As Crawford demonstrates,\nhowever, the Confrontation Clause, when properly applied, is not dependent upon \u201cthe law of Evidence for\nthe time being.\u201d Crawford, 124 S. Ct. at 1364, 1370 (quoting 3 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1397, p. 101 (2d\ned. 1923)) (\u201cWhere testimonial statements are involved, we do not think the Framers meant to leave the\nSixth Amendment\u2019s protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence . . . .\u201d); see also Friedman,\nConfrontation, 86 Geo. L.J. at 1020 (\u201c[W]e might well pause at a doctrine that in effect conforms a\nconstitutional right, a part of the Bill of Rights, to the contours designed\u2013in a process not bearing the\nremotest resemblance to the amendment procedure established by Article V of the Constitution\u2013by a\ncommittee of drafters of evidentiary rules for the federal courts.\u201d).\n        As a matter of modern evidence law, the district court may well have been correct in admitting\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s redirect testimony about the description provided by the informant since          Cromer, on cross-\nexamination, had opened the door to the subject by asking about that description.11 See United States v.\nRamos, 861 F.2d 461, 468 (6th Cir. 1988) (finding no violation of confrontation right when defendant, on\ncross-examination, had opened door for government\u2019s line of inquiry); United States v. Wynn, 845 F.2d\n1439, 1443 (7th Cir. 1988) (\u201cIt is clear from the record that [the defendant] opened the door to this line of\nquestioning when he tried to impeach [the government agent] on the issue of his motive for investigating\n[the defendant]. By questioning [the agent\u2019s] motives, [defendant\u2019s] counsel was attempting to further his\nown theory that [defendant] was framed. . . . On redirect examination the government merely clarified the\nbasis for [the agent\u2019s] suspicion of [the defendant].\u201d); United States v. Walker, 421 F.2d 1298, 1299-1300\n(3d Cir. 1970) (stating that a defendant can, \u201cby cross-examination of a witness[,] . . . open the door for the\nadmission on redirect examination of matters tending to support the case, which would not have been\nadmissible on the case in chief\u201d). Cromer and his counsel, on cross-examination, introduced the existence\nof an informant and a description provided by that informant in an attempt to discredit the government\u2019s\ncase by emphasizing the limited information tying Cromer to the Buchanan residence prior to the execution\nof the warrant. Even after Cromer was warned that this line of questioning would open the door to allow\nthe government to question O\u2019Brien about the exact content of the informant\u2019s statements, Cromer\ncontinued in his attempt to establish that the informant\u2019s statement did not describe him. On redirect\nexamination, the government merely clarified the precise nature of the description provided by the CI.\n         The pertinent question, however, is not whether the CI\u2019s statements were properly admitted pursuant\nto \u201cthe law of Evidence for the time being.\u201d Crawford, 124 S. Ct. at 1364. Rather, the relevant inquiry is\nwhether Cromer\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him was violated by O\u2019Brien\u2019s redirect testimony.\nIf there is one theme that emerges from Crawford, it is that the Confrontation Clause confers a powerful and\nfundamental right that is no longer subsumed by the evidentiary rules governing the admission of hearsay\nstatements. Thus, the mere fact that Cromer may have opened the door to the testimonial, out-of-court\nstatement that violated his confrontation right is not sufficient to erase that violation. In this, too, we agree\n\n    10\n       Any potential doubts about whether these statements were offered for the truth of the matter asserted is resolved by the\nprosecutor\u2019s closing argument, wherein the government\u2019s counsel argued that Cromer was guilty because he matched the\ndescription offered by the CI.\n    11\n       We need not devote much attention to the question of whether the Confrontation Clause was violated by any of the\nevidence admitted during O\u2019Brien\u2019s cross-examination since \u201ca party may not complain on appeal of errors that he himself invited\nor provoked.\u201d Harvis v. Roadway Express, Inc., 923 F.2d 59, 60 (6th Cir. 1991).\n\fNo. 02-2394             United States v. Cromer                                                         Page 16\n\n\nwith Professor Friedman, who has postulated that a defendant only forfeits his confrontation right if his own\nwrongful conduct is responsible for his inability to confront the witness. Friedman, Confrontation, 86 Geo.\nL.J. at 1031. If, for example, the witness is only unavailable to testify because the defendant has killed or\nintimidated her, then the defendant has forfeited his right to confront that witness. A foolish strategic\ndecision does not rise to the level of such misconduct and so will not cause the defendant to forfeit his rights\nunder the Confrontation Clause. O\u2019Brien\u2019s redirect testimony relating the CI\u2019s physical description\ntherefore violated Cromer\u2019s right of confrontation.\n        The only question remaining in our Confrontation Clause analysis is whether the two violations of\nthe Clause that we have identified amounted to plain error. We already have found that there was error.\nIn light of Crawford, the error is \u201cplain.\u201d Based on Crawford\u2019s affirmation of the importance of the\nconstitutional right of confrontation, we readily can determine that Cromer\u2019s substantial rights were affected\nby these violations. In the context of a case as close as this one on the central issue of whether the defendant\nwas involved in any illegal drug activities, the admission of these statements directly tying Cromer to the\ncrime likely impacted the outcome of the trial. Because this plain error compromised the fairness and\nintegrity of Cromer\u2019s trial, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND this case for\na new trial in accordance with this opinion.\n                                            B. Faretta Warnings\n         Cromer argues on appeal that the district court violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment by\nfailing to give him Faretta warnings and to make an explicit finding that he knowingly and voluntarily\nwaived his right to counsel before allowing him to conduct part of the cross-examination of O\u2019Brien. When\nreviewing an alleged deprivation of a defendant\u2019s right to counsel, this court reviews for clear error the\ndistrict court\u2019s factual findings and reviews de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions. United States v.\nCope, 312 F.3d 757, 772 (6th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 198 (2003).\n        The Supreme Court has held that a criminal defendant has a constitutionally protected right to\npresent his own defense in addition to a constitutionally protected right to be represented by counsel.\nFaretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 833-34 (1975). By electing to exercise his constitutional right to\npresent his own defense, a defendant necessarily waives his constitutional right to be represented by\ncounsel. United States v. Mosley, 810 F.2d 93, 97 (6th Cir. 1987) (\u201c\u2018The right to defend pro se and the right\nto counsel have been aptly described as \u201ctwo faces of the same coin,\u201d in that waiver of one right constitutes\na correlative assertion of the other.\u2019\u201d (quoting United States v. Conder, 423 F.2d 904, 908 (6th Cir. 1970))).\nThis waiver of counsel must be knowing and voluntary. Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835. This Court has adopted\na rather lengthy series of questions from 1 Bench Book for United States District Judges 1.02-2 to -5 (3d\ned. 1986) that a district court should ask in order to ensure that a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel is knowing\nand intelligent. United States v. McDowell, 814 F.2d 245, 247, 250 (6th Cir. 1987). Substantial compliance\nwith this series of questions is sufficient. United States v. Miller, 910 F.2d 1321, 1324 (6th Cir. 1990);\nUnited States v. Grosshans, 821 F.2d 1247, 1250-51 (6th Cir. 1987).\n        Defendant-Appellant contends that a proper waiver of his right to counsel was required even though\nhe sought a hybrid form of representation rather than total self-representation because he sought to take on\nsome of the core functions of counsel. Cromer argues that the district court erred both by failing to ensure\nthat he had knowingly and intelligently made the necessary waiver and by failing to make a specific finding\nof knowing and intelligent waiver. While the trial court did state that it thought Cromer\u2019s counsel could do\na better job and did indicate that Cromer would have to comply with the Federal Rules of Evidence,\nDefendant-Appellant contends that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to address Cromer\nin a manner substantially similar to the colloquy mandated by McDowell.\n        The United States asserts that there was no reason for the district court to secure a waiver of the right\nto counsel because Cromer never unequivocally asked to proceed pro se. Indeed, Defendant-Appellant did\nnot actually proceed without the assistance of counsel when he questioned the witness because his attorney\n\fNo. 02-2394                 United States v. Cromer                                                                      Page 17\n\n\nstood next to him at the podium during the questioning, conferred with him before virtually every question,\nand continued to make objections on this behalf and make interjections on the record when necessary. The\ngovernment contends that to the extent a waiver of counsel was required, Cromer effectively waived that\nright. Finally, the government maintains that even if there was any error, that error was harmless.\n         There is conflicting authority on the issue of when Faretta warnings are required. A number of\ncourts have held that there is a presumption against a waiver of counsel, and that Faretta warnings are only\nrequired when a defendant has clearly and unequivocally asserted his right to proceed pro se. Buhl v.\nCooksey, 233 F.3d 783, 790 (3d Cir. 2000) (\u201cCourts must indulge every reasonable presumption against a\nwaiver of counsel.

See Mosley, 810 F.2d at 97-98; see also\nMcKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168, 183 (1984) (noting that \u201cFaretta does not require a trial judge to permit \u2018hybrid\u2019\nrepresentation\u201d and \u201c[a] defendant does not have a constitutional right to choreograph special appearances by counsel\u201d). A district\ncourt may, however, exercise its discretion to permit a defendant to participate in his own defense without requiring the defendant\nthereafter to proceed without the assistance of counsel. See Mosley, 810 F.2d at 97-98.\n\fNo. 02-2394                 United States v. Cromer                                                                    Page 18\n\n\nquestions.\u201d Id. at 225. The district court allowed Leggett to cross-examine three government witnesses,\nto pose questions to two defense witnesses, and to make a closing argument to the jury following the\nsummation of his counsel. The D.C. Circuit noted that, by its own terms, \u201cFaretta applies only where a\ndefendant chooses to proceed pro se and thereby forgoes the benefits associated with the right to counsel.\u201d\nId. at 224. Finding that the defendant had not made an unmistakable choice to proceed pro se, the court\nnoted that \u201cbecause the record shows that the hybrid procedure allowed by the district court responded to\nLeggett\u2019s concerns and to his stated preference that he be allowed to supplement his counsel\u2019s questions and\nargument, he has a heavy burden to show that the district court abused its discretion.\u201d Id. at 224.\n        In other cases, however, courts have held that in the instance of hybrid representation, Faretta\nwarnings must be given any time the defendant assumes any of the \u201ccore functions\u201d of counsel. United\nStates v. Davis, 269 F.3d 514, 519-20 (5th Cir. 2001); United States v. Turnbull, 888 F.2d 636, 638 (9th Cir.\n1989). In Davis, for example, the court allowed a hybrid arrangement whereby either the defendant or his\ncounsel was required to be responsible for each witness:\n         Of the nineteen witnesses examined by the defense at trial, Davis questioned fourteen. Fry\n         [defense counsel] made objections to the Government\u2019s questioning of one witness;\n         responded to offers of government exhibits; assisted Davis in making a proffer of a witness\u2019s\n         potential testimony; and moved for acquittal after the Government rested, but not at the close\n         of all the evidence. Both Davis and Fry gave closing arguments.\nDavis, 269 F.3d at 517. The court found that, \u201c\u2018[h]ybrid\u2019 or not, the representation sought by Davis entailed\na waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel that required the safeguards specified in Faretta.\u201d Id. at\n520. The court implied that defense counsel had acted in the role of standby counsel and held that because\nthe existence of such standby counsel does not satisfy the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, Davis had\nwaived his right to counsel and the district court had erred by not ensuring that the waiver was knowing and\nintelligent. Id.\n        We agree that Faretta procedures are only required when a defendant has clearly and unequivocally\nasserted his right to proceed pro se, and we13find this case to be factually comparable to the Leggett line of\ncases rather than to the Davis line of cases. A defendant may assert either his right to counsel or his right\nto present his own defense. Because the assertion of the right to self-representation necessarily involves\na waiver of the constitutional right to counsel, and given the importance of the right to counsel, we think\nthe wisest course is to require a clear and unequivocal assertion of a defendant\u2019s right to self-representation\nbefore his right to counsel may be deemed waived. Requiring an articulate and unmistakable demand of\nthe right to proceed pro se decreases the danger of a savvy defendant manipulating these two mutually\nexclusive rights to put the district court in a Catch-22. A defendant who seeks merely to supplement his\ncounsel\u2019s representation, as Cromer did here, has failed to avail himself of his right to self-representation\nand thus failed to waive his right to the assistance of counsel. This case is readily distinguishable from cases\nin which a defendant assumes the whole of his representation part-way through trial or acts as co-counsel\nwith full responsibility for certain witnesses. Here, Cromer did not waive his right to counsel because he\ncontinued to receive substantial assistance from counsel, even while he was actually questioning the witness.\nBecause there was no waiver, clearly and unequivocally asserted, there was no need to warn Cromer about\nthe consequences of that waiver.\n\n\n\n    13\n        In Wilson v. Hurt, No. 00-3165, 2002 WL 197997, at *4-5 (6th Cir. Feb. 6, 2002), this Court, in an unreported decision,\nexpressed its agreement with Davis and Turnbull rather than with Leggett. We note that Wilson does not represent binding\nprecedent. Furthermore, Wilson is factually distinguishable from the case sub judice. There, the defendant had elected to proceed\npro se in the middle of his trial. After the request, Wilson examined all of the remaining witnesses, testified in narrative form\nwithout the assistance of counsel, and delivered his own closing argument. Wilson\u2019s attorney remained at counsel table, but he\nappears to have acted only in an advisory capacity. While Wilson seems to have acted on his own during the entire second part\nof the trial, Cromer never actually acted without the assistance of counsel.\n\fNo. 02-2394         United States v. Cromer                                           Page 19\n\n\n                                     III. CONCLUSION\n       For the foregoing reasons, this matter is REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings\nin accordance with this opinion.\n\f",
