Defendant\r\nsat on the couch, and she lay across the couch on her stomach with her legs\r\nacross his.\u00a0 Defendant began massaging her calves.\u00a0 Defendant then\r\nmoved his hands up her legs, reached under her shorts, and began massaging her\r\nlower buttocks.\u00a0 Complainant was uncomfortable but said nothing.\u00a0\r\nDefendant moved one of his hands toward her inner thigh and then penetrated her\r\nvagina with one or two of his fingers, up to the second joint, for about two\r\nminutes.\u00a0 Scared, complainant remained silent.\u00a0 After defendant\r\nstopped, complainant went to her room.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b6 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nShortly afterwards, her friend M.W. came to the house to watch a movie.\u00a0\r\nM.W. testified that complainant acted normally.\u00a0 Complainant testified\r\nthat after M.W. left, defendant asked if she had told.\u00a0 Complainant said\r\nshe had not, and defendant then said not to tell her mother.\u00a0\r\nComplainant\u2019s version of events included declaring to defendant that \u201cnothing\r\nhappened\u201d in order to change the subject, and incidents of normalcy such as\r\ngoing to church the next day with defendant and getting a ride to school with\r\nhim on Monday.\u00a0 When her mother returned home, complainant did not tell\r\nher what happened. \u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b6 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nOver the following months, complainant began reporting what took place\r\nduring the massage.\u00a0 She first told her sister, two or three weeks later,\r\nthat defendant\u2019s leg massage \u201cfelt a bit uncomfortable after a little while,\u201d\r\nbut did not elaborate.\u00a0 Two or three weeks later still, complainant told\r\nher friend J.P. that defendant gave her a massage that had gotten \u201ca bit\r\nawkward.\u201d\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b6 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nComplainant further testified that following the massage incident her\r\nrelationship with defendant became evermore contentious and that she \u201cdistanced\u201d\r\nherself from her mother to avoid telling what happened.\u00a0 Complainant and\r\ndefendant increasingly fought over house rules.\u00a0 The tension culminated\r\none evening in May 2009 with a major argument over her taking a piece of\r\nfood.\u00a0 Then hearing her mother and defendant arguing over defendant\u2019s\r\ntreatment of her, complainant decided to tell.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b6 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nOn the next day, complainant told her mother that defendant gave her a\r\nleg massage the previous October and that it became \u201cinappropriate and very uncomfortable.\u201d\u00a0\r\nThey agreed to talk more later because, in complainant\u2019s view, her mother was\r\n\u201cstill processing\u201d and complainant had to go to work.\u00a0 She\r\ntestified that the following night she purposely, but inaccurately, told her\r\nmother that defendant touched her \u201cbutthole\u201d during the massage because it was\r\ntoo awkward to say he touched her vagina. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b6 8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThat same week, unaware of mandatory reporting obligations, complainant\r\ntold a high school teacher about the massage.\u00a0 The teacher reported it to\r\nthe guidance counselor, who contacted the police.\u00a0 Complainant spoke with\r\na police officer, and testified that she did not know what the officer meant\r\nwhen asked if defendant penetrated her genitalia.\u00a0 The officer then\r\nexplained penetration and that defendant could get in significantly more\r\ntrouble if he penetrated her than if he did not.\u00a0 Complainant testified\r\nthat, based on the explanation, and to avoid getting defendant into more\r\nserious trouble, she said he did not penetrate her.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b6 9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nComplainant next met with a detective from the Chittenden Unit for\r\nSpecial Investigations (CUSI) and gave a sworn statement.\u00a0 According to\r\nher testimony, she may have repeated that defendant touched her \u201cbutthole\u201d and\r\ndenied that defendant penetrated her.\u00a0 At this meeting, complainant also\r\nsaid she did not want to proceed with criminal charges, and she testified that,\r\nat this point, she wanted only for defendant to get help, admit what he did,\r\nand apologize to her.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b6 10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nAt some point after this CUSI interview, complainant received a letter\r\nfrom defendant.\u00a0 He wrote that his \u201cactions were wrong, damaging, hurtful,\r\ninconsiderate, disrespectful, and embarrassing for all,\u201d that he took \u201cfull\r\nresponsibility\u201d for them, that he was \u201cglad . . .\u00a0 that [she was] accurate\r\nwith her testimony\u201d given at her CUSI meeting, and that his arrest would be\r\n\u201cwarranted.\u201d\u00a0 Complainant testified that she felt that defendant finally\r\nadmitted what he did, and that she still just wanted him to get help.\u00a0\r\nComplainant\u2019s grandmother also testified that defendant visited her in the same\r\nmonth, was very emotional and admitted that he touched complainant\r\n\u201cinappropriately,\u201d but did not describe what he did. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b6 11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nComplainant requested another meeting with CUSI in late May because of\r\nguilt over not disclosing the full truth, and wanted to tell CUSI that\r\ndefendant did in fact penetrate her.\u00a0 Complainant further testified that\r\neven after relating this information, she remained ambivalent about formal\r\ncharges.\u00a0 Complainant decided otherwise, however, upon learning that\r\ndefendant started to deny the incident and assert that complainant made up her\r\npenetration claim at the behest of her mother.\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b6 12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDefendant was charged in June 2009 with one count of sexual assault\r\nunder 13\u00a0V.S.A. \u00a7 3252.\u00a0 His first trial ended in a hung jury.\u00a0\r\nHe was retried on the original sexual assault count, joined with an additional\r\ncount of lewd and lascivious conduct under 13 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a02601.\u00a0\r\nDefendant was convicted on both counts and appealed.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b6 13.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDefendant made a post-trial motion for judgment of acquittal under\r\nV.R.Cr.P. 29(c), arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his\r\nconvictions.\u00a0 The criminal division denied the motion as to both\r\ncounts.\u00a0 As to the sexual assault count, the\r\ncourt explained in part that defendant\u2019s \u201creal complaint\u201d was that\r\ncomplainant\u2019s allegation of an unlawful sexual act was incredible because she\r\n\u201cdescribed the [massage] in various ways to various persons at various\r\ntimes.\u201d\u00a0 It reasoned that the jury was free to resolve the question of\r\ncomplainant\u2019s credibility in defendant\u2019s favor, but decided against him.\u00a0\r\nThe court confirmed that complainant\u2019s testimony, if believed, was sufficient\r\nto show defendant\u2019s conduct was intentional and that there was no evidence that\r\nhis contact was consensual.\u00a0 The court denied the motion for acquittal on\r\nthe lewd-and-lascivious-conduct count on the same basis.\u00a0 Defendant\r\nargues this was error, given that complainant\u2019s testimony was rife with\r\nunexplained contradictions and lies.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b6 14.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nReviewing a motion for judgment of acquittal, the test is whether \u201cthe\r\nevidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the State and excluding\r\nany modifying evidence, fairly and reasonably tends to convince a reasonable\r\ntrier of fact that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\u00a0 State\r\nv. Boglioli, 2011 VT 60, \u00b6 7, ___ Vt. ___, 26 A.3d 44 (mem.) (quotation\r\nomitted).\u00a0 The court should enter a judgment of acquittal only if the\r\nState fails to offer \u201cany evidence to substantiate a jury verdict.\u201d\u00a0 State\r\nv. Couture, 169 Vt. 222, 226, 734 A.2d 524, 527 (1999).\u00a0 Credibility\r\nquestions raised by the evidence at trial are \u201centirely within the province of\r\nthe jury.\u201d\u00a0 State v. Hinchliffe, 2009 VT 111, \u00b6 22, 186 Vt. 487,\r\n987 A.2d 988. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b6 15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe State had to prove sexual assault by nonconsensual digital\r\npenetration and lewd and lascivious conduct by handling the complainant\u2019s\r\ngenitals.\u00a0 The sexual assault charge specified that defendant \u201cengaged in\r\na sexual act with [complainant],\u201d by \u201ccompel[ing her] to participate in a\r\nsexual act without her consent by inserting his finger into [her] genital\r\nopening.\u201d\u00a0 See 13\u00a0V.S.A.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03252(a)(1).\u00a0 \u201cSexual act,\u201d defined by the statute in pertinent part, is\r\n\u201cconduct between persons consisting of . . . any intrusion, however slight, by\r\nany part of a person\u2019s body or any object into the genital or anal opening of\r\nanother.\u201d\u00a0 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 3251(1).\u00a0 The lewd and lascivious\r\nconduct count alleged that defendant \u201cengaged in open and gross lewdness and\r\nlascivious behavior . . . by having contact between his hands and\r\n[complainant\u2019s] vulva.\u201d\u00a0 See 13 V.S.A.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02601.\u00a0 There was\r\nsufficient evidence to support defendant\u2019s convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b6 16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDefendant argues that the state\u2019s principle evidence on both charges,\r\ncomplainant\u2019s testimony, was \u201cobjectively\u201d incredible, but our review must\r\nexamine her testimony\u2014in fact all of the evidence\u2014in the light most favorable\r\nto the State.\u00a0 State v. Boglioli, 2011 VT 60, \u00b6 7.\u00a0 Through\r\ncross examination, defendant had the opportunity to highlight any perceived\r\nweaknesses in the complaining witness\u2019s differing narrations.\u00a0 See Hinchliffe,\r\n2009 VT 111, \u00b6 22 (explaining that cross-examination is defendant\u2019s tool to\r\nshow inconsistencies in incriminating testimony).\u00a0 The question of the\r\nwitness\u2019s objective credibility was ultimately for the jury to determine and is\r\nnot for this Court to weigh on appeal.\u00a0 See State v.
