(5:07-hc-\n02097-FL)\n\n\nSubmitted: May 30, 2017                                           Decided: June 13, 2017\n\n\nBefore MOTZ, KING, and AGEE, Circuit Judges.\n\n\nAffirmed by unpublished per curiam opinion.\n\n\nLawrence H.

Norman Acker, III, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, Michael Lockridge, Special Assistant United States Attorney,\nRaleigh, North Carolina, for Appellee.\n\n\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n       Hobart J. Barrett, Jr. appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for\n\nconditional release from the custody of the Attorney General pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 4247(h) (2012). In reviewing a district court\u2019s order denying release, we review \u201cthe\n\ndistrict court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.\u201d United\n\nStates v. Francis, 686 F.3d 265, 273 (4th Cir. 2012). A court commits clear error by\n\nmaking findings without properly taking into account substantial evidence to the contrary,\n\nand we will only find clear error if, after considering the entire record, we are \u201cleft with\n\nthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d Id. (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n       Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248(d) (2012), a court may after a hearing commit a person\n\nwho is sexually dangerous to the custody of the Attorney General. \u201cA \u2018sexually dangerous\n\nperson\u2019 is defined as one \u2018who has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent\n\nconduct or child molestation and who is sexually dangerous to others.\u2019\u201d Francis, 686 F.3d\n\nat 268 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(a)(5) (2012)). Once committed, a person remains\n\nconfined until he is no longer sexually dangerous to others. Id. (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248(e)\n\n(2012)). \u201cA committed individual may seek periodic review of his confinement no sooner\n\nthan 180 days from the most recent determination by the district court.\u201d Id. (citing 18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 4247(h)).\n\n       \u201c[W]hen a person who has been civilly committed as sexually dangerous petitions\n\nfor relief from his civil commitment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(h), he bears the burden of\n\nshowing by a preponderance of the evidence that he is no longer sexually dangerous within\n\n                                             2\n\fthe meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(a)(5)-(6).\u201d United States v. Wetmore, 812 F.3d 245, 248\n\n(1st Cir. 2016) (citing United States v. Anderson, 151 F.3d 1030 at *2 (4th Cir. 1998)\n\n(unpublished table decision)). \u201cIf the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\na committed person is no longer sexually dangerous to others if released unconditionally\n\nor if released under a prescribed regimen of treatment, then the court must order the\n\nappropriate discharge.\u201d United States v. Comstock, 627 F.3d 513, 516 (4th Cir. 2010)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude\n\nthat the district court did not err in denying Barrett\u2019s petition for conditional release.\n\n       Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument\n\nbecause the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this\n\ncourt and argument would not aid in the decisional process.\n\n                                                                                  AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\f",
