We affirm.\n\n      A prior panel of this Court summarized the history of this case as\n\nfollows.\n\n      On February 24, 2012, M.N, then four years old, went to the\n      doctor for a routine checkup. While in the doctor\u2019s office, she\n      informed Joyce Ames, her paternal grandmother, that her\n      \u201ccookie\u201d hurt. She indicated that she was referring to her genital\n      area. She also referred to her anus as \u201ccelery.\u201d She continued\n      to expound that Appellant put his \u201cpeanut\u201d in her \u201ccookie,\u201d and\n      she explained that \u201cFred\u201d told her about those terms. The\n      doctor instructed Ames to take M.N. to Children\u2019s Hospital for an\n      evaluation.\n\n\n*Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-S40045-15\n\n\n           On March 13, 2012, M.N. was interviewed at A Child\u2019s\n     Place at Mercy by Sara Gluzman, a forensic interviewer trained in\n     evaluating and interviewing children who are suspected victims\n     of abuse. During the course of the interview, Gluzman asked\n     M.N. if there are places people are not supposed to touch.3\n     M.N., in response, drew a picture and told Gluzman it was a\n     \u201cboob\u201d and people are not supposed to touch it. Gluzman\n     showed M.N. an anatomical depiction of the human body, which\n     she uses with all children she interviews, and asked M.N. what\n     she called different areas of the body. M.N. used the term\n     \u201ccoochie.\u201d When Gluzman asked what she uses \u201ccoochie\u201d for,\n     M.N. explained her mother called it \u201cpeachie\u201d and that it is used\n     \u201cto pee.\u201d M.N. told Gluzman that Appellant put his \u201cpart\u201d in her\n     \u201cpeachie\u201d and \u201cbutt.\u201d M.N. also said it happened \u201c[m]ore than\n     one time.\u201d Following the interview, Dr. Mary Carrasco, the\n     director of A Child\u2019s Place at Mercy, performed an examination of\n     M.N., which did not reveal physical evidence of abuse.4\n          _______\n          3\n            The interview was recorded and played during the trial.\n          The exchange between M.N. and Gluzman during the\n          interview is included in the transcript of the trial.\n          4\n            Dr. Carrasco testified at trial as an expert in pediatric\n          child abuse. She testified that the lack of physical findings\n          \u201cdoes not mean nothing occurred. \u2026 [M]ost of the time,\n          that is 94% of the time, there will be no physical evidence\n          of sexual abuse.\u201d\n\n     \u2026 A three-day jury trial commenced on January 8, 2014. M.N.,\n     Ames, M.N.\u2019s mother, Gluzman, and Dr. Carrasco testified on\n     behalf of the Commonwealth. After the Commonwealth rested,\n     two defense witnesses testified. On January 10, 2014, the jury\n     found Appellant guilty of all charged offenses.\n\n           Following the guilty verdicts, the Commonwealth filed its\n     notice of intention to seek mandatory sentences pursuant to 42\n     Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9718(a).5 The trial court conducted a sentencing\n     hearing on April 3, 2014 and imposed the mandatory minimum\n     sentences sought by the Commonwealth [for an aggregate\n     sentence of 40 to 80 years of imprisonment].\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fJ-S40045-15\n\n\n             _______\n             5\n               Section 9718 provides for mandatory minimum sentences\n             of, inter alia, not less than ten years\u2019 imprisonment for\n             rape of a child and not less than ten years\u2019 imprisonment\n             for any conviction under [18 Pa.C.S.] \u00a7 3123 (relating to\n             IDSI),when the victim is less than sixteen years of age. 42\n             Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9718(a).\n\nCommonwealth           v.   Mitchell,   No.   578   WDA   2014,   unpublished\n\nmemorandum at 2-4 (Pa. Super. January 22, 2015) (citations and some\n\nfootnotes omitted).\n\n      On appeal to this Court, Appellant raised five issues, including the\n\nfollowing:\n\n      I.    Whether the evidence was legally and factually insufficient\n      to show that [Appellant] committed the crimes of Rape, Forcible\n      Compulsion, Rape of a Child, IDSI Forcible Compulsion, IDSI\n      Person Less than 16 years of Age, beyond a reasonable doubt[?]\n\n      II.  Whether the trial judge committed reversible error in\n      permitting [M.N.] to testify on the lap of her grandmother, Joyce\n      Ames, despite a sequestration of witnesses and over defense\n      counsel\u2019s objection[?]\n\nId. at 5 (quoting Appellant\u2019s Brief).\n\n      This Court held that Appellant waived his challenge to the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence by failing to specify in his concise statement of errors\n\ncomplained of on appeal which elements of the crimes lacked proof beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.      Id. at 8. The panel nonetheless proceeded to address\n\nthe merits of the claim:\n\n      We observe that had Appellant properly preserved this issue, he\n      would not be entitled to relief.   In support of this claim,\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fJ-S40045-15\n\n\n      Appellant asks this court to reweigh the evidence presented at\n      trial. Specifically, Appellant recounts, \u201c[t]he defense presented\n      two witnesses, both of [whom] testified that this could have\n      been a scheme devised by [M.N.\u2019s mother]\u2026.\u201d The jury in this\n      case was free to credit M.N.\u2019s testimony and disregard the\n      speculative testimony proffered by the defense.              See\n      [Commonwealth v. Kearney, 92 A.3d 51, 64 (Pa. Super.\n      2014)].       Moreover, \u201cit is well-established that          the\n      uncorroborated testimony of the complaining witness is sufficient\n      to convict a defendant of sexual offenses.\u201d Commonwealth v.\n      Castelhun, 889 A.2d 1228, 1232 (Pa. Super. 2005) (citations\n      and quotation marks omitted). Therefore, viewing the evidence\n      in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, sufficient\n      evidence was presented to find Appellant guilty of the charged\n      offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. See [Commonwealth v.\n      Patterson, 91 A.3d 55, 66 (Pa. 2014)].\n\nId. at 9 n.9. The panel also concluded that \u201cthe trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion by making an exception to the general sequestration order, and\n\nAppellant has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the\n\nexception.\u201d Id. at 13.\n\n      Although it found that all of Appellant\u2019s stated issues were either\n\nmeritless or both waived and meritless, this Court concluded that Appellant\u2019s\n\nsentence was illegal under Alleyne v. United States, \u2013\u2013\u2013 U.S. \u2013\u2013\u2013, 133\n\nS.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), and its progeny.        Accordingly, this\n\nCourt affirmed Appellant\u2019s convictions, but vacated his judgment of sentence\n\nand remanded for resentencing without consideration of section 9718.\n\nMitchell, unpublished memorandum at 26-27.\n\n      On March 6, 2015, Appellant was resentenced without consideration of\n\nany mandatory minimum sentencing statute to an aggregate term of 39 to\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fJ-S40045-15\n\n\n78 years\u2019 imprisonment. Appellant\u2019s post-sentence motion for modification\n\nof sentence was denied on March 11, 2015. Appellant timely filed a notice of\n\nappeal.\n\n      On appeal, Appellant presents two issues,1 both of which were raised\n\nin his first direct appeal:\n\n      I.    Whether the evidence was legally and factually insufficient\n      to show that [Appellant] committed the crimes of Rape [by]\n      Forcible Compulsion, Rape of a Child, IDSI Forcible Compulsion,\n      IDSI Person Less than 16 years of Age, beyond a reasonable\n      doubt?\n\n      II.  Whether the trial judge committed reversible error in\n      permitting [M.N.] to testify on the lap of her grandmother, Joyce\n      Ames, despite a sequestration of witnesses and over defense\n      counsel\u2019s objection?\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 7 (unnecessary capitalization omitted).\n\n      As the trial court aptly stated, Trial Court Opinion, 4/8/2015, at 4, the\n\nlaw of the case doctrine applies to Appellant\u2019s claims. \u201cThe law of the case\n\n\n\n1\n   Appellant lists only two issues in his statement of questions involved.\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 7. However, four additional issues are raised in the\nargument portion of his brief. Those questions are not properly before us.\nSee Pa.R.A.P. 2116(a) (\u201cNo question will be considered unless it is stated in\nthe statement of questions involved or is fairly suggested thereby.\u201d). We\nnote that three of the four additional issues were rejected by this Court in\nAppellant\u2019s first direct appeal, and would thus be subject to the same\nanalysis we provide for the claims we do address. The fourth additional\nissue is a challenge to the discretionary aspects of his sentence, which we\nwould reject based upon Appellant\u2019s failure to include in his brief a concise\nstatement of reasons relied upon for allowance of appeal pursuant to\nPa.R.A.P. 2119(f). Commonwealth v. Coulverson, 34 A.3d 135, 142 (Pa.\nSuper. 2011) (\u201cIf the Rule 2119(f) statement is absent\u2026, this Court may\nrefuse to accept the appeal.\u201d).\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJ-S40045-15\n\n\ndoctrine refers to a family of rules which embody the concept that a court\n\ninvolved in the later phases of a litigated matter should not reopen questions\n\ndecided by another judge of that same court or by a higher court in the\n\nearlier phases of the matter.\u201d Commonwealth v. Fears, 86 A.3d 795, 815\n\n(Pa. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[W]hen an appellate court\n\nhas considered and decided a question submitted to it upon appeal, it will\n\nnot, upon a subsequent appeal on another phase of the case, reverse its\n\nprevious ruling even though convinced it was erroneous.\u201d2 Commonwealth\n\nv. McCandless, 880 A.2d 1262, 1268 (Pa. Super. 2005). Exceptions may\n\nbe made \u201cunder exceptional circumstances, including: an intervening change\n\nin the law, a substantial change in the facts, or if the prior ruling was clearly\n\nerroneous and would create a manifest injustice if followed.\u201d Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n      Appellant presents us with no argument that the law or facts have\n\nchanged since this Court\u2019s prior determination.      Nor does he contend that\n\nthe prior rulings were clearly erroneous and create a manifest injustice.\n\n\n\n2\n  All of the issues were \u201cdecided\u201d in Appellant\u2019s prior appeal for purposes of\nthe doctrine of law of the case, as the court performed an even-if analysis\nfor the claims it determined were waived. See Commonwealth v. Reed,\n971 A.2d 1216, 1220 (Pa. 2009) (\u201cIn the instant case, while the Superior\nCourt in Reed I determined that Reed\u2019s claims were waived, it also\ndetermined that even if the claims had not been waived, they were without\nmerit, and the court explained the basis for its conclusions. Thus, the\nSuperior Court\u2019s holding in Reed I that Reed\u2019s claim \u2026 was meritless was a\nvalid holding that constitutes the law of the case\u2026.\u201d).\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fJ-S40045-15\n\n\nRather, Appellant merely reproduces verbatim the arguments presented in\n\nhis prior appellate brief.   This Court will not consider those arguments a\n\nsecond time. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Kratzer, 660 A.2d 102, 105\n\n(Pa. Super. 1995) (\u201cKratzer argues that the trial court erred in denying the\n\nwithdrawal of his guilty plea because it was involuntary and unknowing as a\n\nresult of guilty plea counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness and coercion.     This identical\n\nissue was raised before and decided by a panel of this Court in [Kratzer\u2019s\n\nprior appeal]. \u2026 Therefore, we need not consider this issue.\u201d).\n\n      Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
