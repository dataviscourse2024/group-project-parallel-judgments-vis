Thomas Patrick Murphy, HUNTON & WILLIAMS, LLP, McLean,\nVirginia, for Appellees.   ON BRIEF: Arthur E. Schmalz, Ryan M.\nBates, HUNTON & WILLIAMS LLP, McLean, Virginia, for Appellees.\n\fGREGORY, Circuit Judge:\n\n        Pro se Plaintiff Richard Weidman sued his former employer,\n\nExxon     Mobil    Corporation        (\u201cExxonMobil\u201d),          and   ten    ExxonMobil\n\nemployees,      alleging       that   he    was    fired       in    retaliation   for\n\nreporting illegal pharmacy practices, which caused him to suffer\n\na heart attack and emotional distress.                     Weidman, still pro se,\n\nappeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his fraud, intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress, personal injury, and wrongful\n\ndischarge claims.             Weidman furthermore challenges the district\n\ncourt\u2019s denial of his motion to remand the case to state court.\n\nFor the reasons below, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of\n\nWeidman\u2019s motion to remand and dismissal of all but one of his\n\ntort claims.        We hold Weidman has sufficiently stated a claim\n\nfor wrongful discharge against ExxonMobil.\n\n\n\n                                           I.\n\n        In March 2013, Weidman filed suit in Fairfax County Circuit\n\nCourt     against       his     former     employer,          ExxonMobil,    and   ten\n\nExxonMobil employees.             These employees include:                 (1) Clarion\n\nEllis    Johnson,       Medical    Director;      (2)    Jeffrey      Woodbury,    Vice\n\nPresident    for    Safety,       Security,       Health       and   Environment   and\n\nJohnson\u2019s supervisor; (3) Victoria Martin Weldon, U.S. Director\n\nof   Medicine     and    Occupational      Health       and    Weidman\u2019s    supervisor\n\nfrom February 2010; and (4) Stephen Jones, whose title is not\n\n                                           2\n\fgiven    but     who     reported      directly          to    Johnson          and    supervised\n\nWeldon.         The      complaint      also           named     four          individuals      who\n\ninvestigated          Weidman\u2019s       reports           of     retaliation:                  Daniel\n\nWhitfield,       Kent     Dixon,      Jeremy          Sampsell,          and     F.    Bud     Carr.\n\nLastly, the suit named Meghan Hasson and Gerard Monsivaiz, who\n\nworked in the Human Resources Department, though Monsivaiz is\n\nonly    mentioned       in    the    case    caption.            Weidman        is     a   Virginia\n\nresident, as are three of the defendants:                                Hasson, Monsivaiz,\n\nand Sampsell.\n\n       Weidman worked as Senior Physician in ExxonMobil\u2019s Fairfax,\n\nVirginia office from 2007 until his termination in January 2013.\n\nUpon    being    hired,       Weidman       was       required      to    read        ExxonMobil\u2019s\n\nStandards       of     Business      Conduct          (\u201chandbook\u201d).              This      handbook\n\ndetailed employee standards with respect to reporting suspected\n\nviolations       of     law    and     policy.            It     also          guaranteed       non-\n\nretaliation      by     ExxonMobil      against          employees         for        making    such\n\nreports.       Weidman claims that he attended yearly meetings where\n\nvideos were played showing Rex Tillerson, CEO of ExxonMobil,\n\nguaranteeing that employees would never suffer retaliation for\n\nreporting violations.\n\n       Weidman\u2019s       complaint      alleges          that    in    2009        he     discovered\n\nExxonMobil      had     been    operating         illegal      pharmacies             in   multiple\n\nstates, and had also illegally stockpiled large quantities of\n\nmedication in its Fairfax, Virginia office, as well as in other\n\n                                                  3\n\fclinics.      He asserts many senior managers were aware of these\n\nillegal     activities,        including           Johnson,        Weldon,        and    Jones.\n\nWeidman further contends that Jones requested he \u201cparticipate in\n\na   scheme\u201d    to     distribute      stockpiled            medication       to    ExxonMobil\n\nemployees      in   Virginia.             In   January       2010,       Weidman        says    he\n\ninformed      Johnson    he    would       not     obtain      a    New     Jersey       medical\n\nlicense to work at a clinic in that state as long as it was\n\noperating an illegal pharmacy.                       In response to this, Weidman\n\nalleges Johnson became \u201cphysically intimidating\u201d toward him.\n\n      Weidman claims he reported \u201cviolations of the law by the\n\nMedical Department,\u201d in response to which \u201cJohnson initiated a\n\nmalicious      campaign       of    retaliation.\u201d             The        campaign       included\n\n\u201cattempts      to     humiliate,          discredit,          and        punish     Weidman,\u201d\n\nincluding      \u201ccontinuously          humiliat[ing]           Weidman        before        [his]\n\ncolleagues,\u201d falsely classifying him as a poor performer, and\n\n\u201cma[king] statements that clearly implied that Weidman was a\n\npedophile\u201d at an office gathering.                     Shortly thereafter, Weidman\n\nreported via email to senior management his belief that Johnson\n\nwas   retaliating       against       him      for    prior    complaints,           and    that\n\nExxonMobil      was     violating         pharmacy      laws        in    several        states.\n\nExxonMobil     proceeded       to    conduct         what    Weidman       describes       as    a\n\n\u201csham\u201d     investigation           into     his      allegations.            Weidman       says\n\nWhitfield and Dixon, two investigators assigned to the matter,\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\ffalsely concluded that Johnson had not harassed Weidman and that\n\nthe pharmacies were legal.\n\n      On       an       unspecified     date       after   the    investigation          into\n\nWeidman\u2019s report, Weidman says the Medical Department designated\n\nhim as a \u201cpoor performer\u201d and required him to participate in a\n\nperformance improvement plan.                  In September 2011, Weidman claims\n\nto have received an email from ExxonMobil\u2019s Legal Department\n\nstating ExxonMobil pharmacies had been in violation of multiple\n\nstate laws.             Weidman says he then sent another email to senior\n\nmanagers informing them that Johnson and other members of the\n\nMedical Department had retaliated against him, and that there\n\nhad     been        a    cover   up    of    these     actions     during    the     first\n\ninvestigation.               A   second      investigation        commenced,      led      by\n\nSampsell and Carr.               During the investigation, Carr allegedly\n\nadmitted to Weidman that ExxonMobil had been operating illegal\n\npharmacies          for    years,     and   that     Johnson     had    permitted    their\n\noperation.\n\n      Under the performance improvement plan, which lasted for\n\nover a year, Weidman participated in meetings with Weldon, which\n\nHasson     also         attended.      Weidman      contends     the    purpose     of    the\n\nmeetings was not to improve his performance, but to overburden\n\nhim with the creation of new tasks meant to cause his failure to\n\nperform.       In late October 2012, Weidman alleges he complained to\n\nHuman      Resources         about     the     \u201coppressive        and    unjustifiable\u201d\n\n                                               5\n\fmeetings.           He   was      particularly               concerned       about       a    meeting\n\nscheduled       just     days     before      he       was    to   undergo         surgery.          The\n\nmeeting    occurred        on     October       24,      2012,      and      was    \u201chostile         and\n\nconfrontational.\u201d            Weidman claims to have had a heart attack\n\nduring    the      meeting      \u201cas     a    direct      result         of   the    stress         which\n\nWeldon    maliciously           inflicted          upon       him.\u201d          In     mid-December,\n\nExxonMobil extended Weidman\u2019s performance improvement plan.                                          At\n\nthe   next      meeting      in    January         2013,       Weidman\u2019s          employment         was\n\nterminated, allegedly for failure to cooperate with the plan.\n\n      Subsequently,          Weidman         filed      his     complaint         asserting         four\n\ncauses    of       action:        (1)       fraud,       because         Appellees           allegedly\n\nretaliated         against      him     despite         representations             made      to     the\n\ncontrary in the handbook and by CEO Tillerson in yearly videos;\n\n(2) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (3) \u201cpersonal\n\ninjury\u201d of \u201cirreparable damage to his heart\u201d; and (4) wrongful\n\ndischarge.         Weidman pursues this last count under two theories,\n\nthat his termination violated Virginia\u2019s public policy and was\n\nalso a breach of an implied unilateral contract established by\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s employee handbook.\n\n      Appellees removed the case to the U.S. District Court for\n\nthe   Eastern       District       of       Virginia,         where     they      also       moved   to\n\ndismiss      the    case     under      Federal         Rule       of    Procedure           12(b)(6).\n\nWeidman moved to remand the case to state court.                                     The district\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fcourt dismissed all of Weidman\u2019s claims and denied his motion to\n\nremand.\n\n\n\n                                      II.\n\n    In appealing the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to\n\nremand, Weidman raises a threshold jurisdictional issue that we\n\naddress de novo.       See Mayes v. Rapoport, 198 F.3d 457, 460 (4th\n\nCir. 1999).     Weidman named three non-diverse defendants in his\n\ncomplaint, but the district court found it could properly retain\n\nsubject     matter    jurisdiction     under     the   \u201cfraudulent    joinder\u201d\n\ndoctrine.     Normally, complete diversity of citizens is necessary\n\nfor a federal court to exercise diversity jurisdiction, meaning\n\nthe plaintiff cannot be a citizen of the same state as any other\n\ndefendant.      Id.    at   464.      However,     the   fraudulent    joinder\n\ndoctrine      provides      that     diversity      jurisdiction      is   not\n\nautomatically defeated by naming non-diverse defendants. 1                 The\n\ndistrict court can \u201cdisregard, for jurisdictional purposes, the\n\ncitizenship of certain nondiverse defendants.\u201d              Id. at 461.     It\n\ncan retain jurisdiction upon the non-moving party showing either\n\n\n    1\n       Contrary to its name, the \u201cfraudulent joinder\u201d doctrine\nrequires neither fraud nor joinder. \u201cIn fact, it is irrelevant\nwhether the defendants were \u2018joined\u2019 to the case or originally\nincluded as defendants,\u201d as the doctrine is \u201capplicable to each\ndefendant named by the plaintiff either in the original\ncomplaint or anytime prior to removal.\u201d Mayes, 198 F.3d at 461\nn.8.\n\n\n                                       7\n\fthat     the     plaintiff     committed           outright     fraud     in    pleading\n\njurisdictional facts, or that \u201cthere is no possibility that the\n\nplaintiff would be able to establish a cause of action against\n\nthe in-state defendant in state court.\u201d                   Mayes, 198 F.3d at 464;\n\nsee also Marshall v. Manville Sales Corp., 6 F.3d 229, 233 (4th\n\nCir. 1993) (\u201cA claim need not ultimately succeed . . . [as] only\n\na possibility of a right to relief need be asserted.\u201d).\n\n        We agree with the district court that Weidman, a Virginia\n\nresident, cannot succeed in any of his claims against the non-\n\ndiverse defendants \u2013 Monsivaiz, Sampsell, or Hasson \u2013 in state\n\ncourt.      First,      Monsivaiz     is    only      mentioned    in   the    complaint\n\ncaption; there is no factual detail at all to support any claims\n\nagainst    him.         Of   the   two     remaining      non-diverse         defendants,\n\nWeidman has not in any way alleged that Sampsell or Hasson made\n\nmaterially false statements on which Weidman reasonably relied,\n\nthat their actions were connected to his heart attack, or that\n\nthey engaged in outrageous or intolerable conduct.                        These claims\n\nfail in any case, for reasons described in Part III.\n\n        The only plausible claim against Hasson and Sampsell is the\n\nwrongful       discharge     claim.        Appellees     argue     that   Sampsell    or\n\nHasson cannot be liable for wrongful discharge because Weidman\n\nnamed     only    ExxonMobil       in      the      paragraph     of    his    complaint\n\ndescribing       this    count.         Even       assuming   Weidman     brings    suit\n\nagainst all Appellees on this claim, there simply are not enough\n\n                                               8\n\ffacts    to   connect     the    actions   of   Sampsell      and     Hasson    to    his\n\nallegedly      wrongful         discharge.           Virginia        law     recognizes\n\nindividual employee liability for wrongful discharge for public\n\npolicy reasons.      See VanBuren v. Grubb, 733 S.E.2d 919, 923 (Va.\n\n2012).    Still, Sampsell is described as one of two investigators\n\nassigned to the second investigation into Weidman\u2019s complaints.\n\nHe is mentioned only once in a paragraph that focuses on actions\n\ntaken not by Sampsell, but by his co-investigator.                           Similarly,\n\nthe most alleged against Hasson is that she attended Weidman\u2019s\n\nperformance improvement meetings.\n\n     Appellees have satisfied their burden of showing there is\n\n\u201cno possibility\u201d of Weidman succeeding in any of his tort claims\n\nagainst any of these non-diverse defendants.                         Thus, we affirm\n\nthe district court\u2019s denial of Weidman\u2019s motion to remand.\n\n\n\n                                       III.\n\n     Moving to the district court\u2019s dismissal of Weidman\u2019s tort\n\nclaims, we review a grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to\n\nstate a claim de novo.

These circumstances are \u201cthe time, place,\n\nand   contents   of   the   false    representations,     as   well   as    the\n\nidentity of the person making the misrepresentation and what he\n\nobtained thereby.\u201d     Harrison v.

Weidman\n\nonly vaguely referred to CEO Tillerson and unnamed \u201cmembers of\n\nthe Human Resources and Law Departments\u201d in his complaint.

He does not specify when or how many times\n\nthe representations occurred, but alleges that \u201c[a]t the time\n\nthese representations were made . . . the parties who made them\n\nknew\u201d that reporting violations \u201ccould result in actions taken\n\nagainst those who reported [them].\u201d                     J.A. 22 (Compl. \u00b6 26).\n\nAbsent additional details, the district court properly dismissed\n\nWeidman\u2019s fraud claim.\n\n                                          B.\n\n      Weidman further appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of\n\nhis claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.                              This\n\nclaim      requires     that:       (1)        the     wrongdoer\u2019s          conduct     was\n\n\u201cintentional or reckless\u201d; (2) the conduct was \u201coutrageous and\n\nintolerable\u201d; (3) \u201cthere was a causal connection between the\n\nwrongdoer\u2019s conduct and the emotional distress\u201d; and (4) the\n\nresulting distress was severe.                 Womack v. Eldridge, 210 S.E.2d\n\n145, 148 (Va. 1974).\n\n      Weidman\u2019s       allegations    against          Appellees     \u2013       that   he   was\n\nlabeled a     poor     performer    and   impliedly        called       a    pedophile    \u2013\n\nwhile unsettling, are nonetheless insufficient as a matter of\n\nlaw   to    establish    \u201coutrageous      and        intolerable\u201d       conduct.

This argument fails for\n\nseveral reasons.          First, Weidman raises this issue for the first\n\ntime on appeal.            See Karpel v. Inova Health Sys. Servs., 134\n\nF.3d 1222, 1227 (4th Cir. 1998) (\u201c[I]ssues raised for the first\n\ntime   on   appeal        generally     will      not    be    considered.\u201d).              More\n\nfundamentally, the Supreme Court of Virginia wrote in Womack\n\nthat a plaintiff must show only negligent, as opposed to willful\n\nor wanton conduct, \u201cwhere emotional disturbance is accompanied\n\n                                             12\n\fby physical injury,\u201d but did so in reference to the tort of\n\nnegligent infliction of emotional distress.                210 S.E. 2d at 147.\n\nWhen Weidman points to Womack for the principle that he is not\n\nrequired to show conduct going \u201cbeyond all possible bounds of\n\ndecency,\u201d Russo, 400 S.E.2d at 162, he is actually trying to\n\nreframe his claim as one for negligent, rather than intentional,\n\ninfliction of emotional distress, which we cannot allow.\n\n     Therefore, Weidman is required to allege \u201coutrageous and\n\nintolerable\u201d conduct, and we agree with the district court that\n\nhe has not done so.\n\n                                        C.\n\n     Count Three of Weidman\u2019s complaint is a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d\n\ncause of action against Appellees.                Weidman states in a single\n\nparagraph:         \u201cDue to the intentional and malicious acts of the\n\nDefendants towards the Plaintiff that the Defendants knew, or\n\nshould      have    known,    would   have    injured     the    Plaintiff,    the\n\nPlaintiff suffered irreparable damage to his heart.\u201d                     J.A. 23\n\n(Compl. \u00b6 33).          In dismissing this count, the district court\n\ntreated     Weidman\u2019s    heart    attack     as    an   injury   for   which   the\n\nVirginia      Workers\u2019       Compensation    Act    provides     the   exclusive\n\nremedy. 2     We instead affirm dismissal of this count for failure\n\n\n     2\n        The Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cVWCA\u201d) is\ntriggered when an employee suffers an \u201cinjury by accident\narising out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d Va.

A well-pled\n\ncomplaint    must   offer      more    than      \u201clabels    and   conclusions,\u201d      or\n\n\u201cnaked     assertions     devoid       of     further      factual     enhancement.\u201d\n\nAshcroft    v.

Weidman\u2019s    one-sentence\n\nallegation    that,     \u201cdue    to    the    intentional      and    malicious     acts\n\n. . . the Plaintiff suffered irreparable damage to his heart,\u201d\n\nJ.A. 23 (Compl. \u00b6 33), is exactly the kind of \u201cnaked assertion\u201d\n\nthat is insufficient to state a claim.\n\n                                            D.\n\n      Weidman\u2019s     wrongful      discharge       claim    against     ExxonMobil   is\n\npresented in two parts.              According to Weidman, his termination\n\nfor refusing to participate in an allegedly illegal pharmacy\n\noperation violated Virginia public policy.                    He also argues that\n\nthe   anti-retaliation            provision        in      ExxonMobil\u2019s     handbook\n\n\n\nAnn. \u00a7 65.2-101.    This does not include \u201c[i]njuries resulting\nfrom repetitive trauma, continuing mental or physical stress, or\nother cumulative events.\u201d Morris v. Morris, 385 S.E.2d 858, 865\n(Va. 1989).    Had Weidman pled that his heart attack was the\nfinal result of repetitive stress or cumulative events, as\nopposed to a discrete event, his claim may not have been barred\nby the VWCA.    Nevertheless, his own complaint does not support\nthis argument. See J.A. 21 (Compl. \u00b6 22) (\u201cDuring the\n[performance improvement] meeting, Weidman suffered a heart\nattack as a direct result of the stress which Weldon maliciously\ninflicted upon him.\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\n\n                                            14\n\fconstituted        an     implied       unilateral         contract         that   ExxonMobil\n\nbreached      by     firing      him    for        reporting        violations        of      state\n\npharmacy laws.\n\n       Virginia adheres to a strong presumption that employment is\n\nat will, meaning employment lasts for an indefinite term and can\n\nbe terminated for almost any reason.                         See VanBuren, 733 S.E.2d\n\nat 921.       However, there is an exception to this doctrine for at-\n\nwill employees who claim to have been discharged in violation of\n\npublic policy.            Bowman v. State Bank of Keysville, 331 S.E.2d\n\n797,    801    (Va.       1985).        The        Supreme      Court    of    Virginia         has\n\nrecognized three situations in which a litigant may show her\n\ndischarge violated public policy:                         (1) where an employer fired\n\nan employee for exercising a statutorily created right; (2) when\n\nthe public policy is \u201cexplicitly expressed in the statute and\n\nthe    employee      was      clearly    a    member       of   that    class      of      persons\n\ndirectly entitled to the protection enunciated by the public\n\npolicy\u201d;      and       (3)    \u201cwhere        the     discharge        was     based      on     the\n\nemployee\u2019s       refusal       to   engage     in     a    criminal      act.\u201d          Rowan    v.\n\nTractor Supply Co., 559 S.E.2d 709, 711 (Va. 2002).\n\n       The    district         court    determined           that     Weidman      failed        to\n\nidentify a statute whose public policy ExxonMobil violated in\n\nfiring him.         We disagree and find Weidman sufficiently stated a\n\nclaim     that      his    termination         violated         the     public     policy       of\n\nsections 54.1-3310 and 54.1\u20143435 of the Virginia Code.                                        These\n\n                                               15\n\fstatutes make it unlawful for anyone to practice pharmacy or to\n\nengage in wholesale distribution of prescription drugs without a\n\nlicense.        Va. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-3310, 54.1\u20143435.               While not part\n\nof Virginia\u2019s criminal code, a violation of these sections leads\n\nto criminal penalties.               See id. \u00a7 54.1-111 (making a violation a\n\nClass 1 misdemeanor 3).              Therefore, refusal to practice pharmacy\n\nwithout a license should be treated as refusal to engage in a\n\ncriminal act.\n\n       Weidman has pled sufficient factual detail to adequately\n\nstate      this   claim.       He     writes   in     his   complaint   that    he    was\n\nwrongfully discharged for \u201crefusing to participate in illegal\n\npharmacy distribution activities . . . contraven[ing] the public\n\npolicy      interest      of   the    Commonwealth      of    Virginia.\u201d       J.A.   24\n\n(Compl. \u00b6 38).         He furthermore describes:\n\n                Jones     also     requested    that    Weidman\n                participate in a scheme involving a Virginia\n                pharmacy,    in   which   the  pharmacy   would\n                distribute    the   stockpiled  medication   to\n                Exxon Mobil employees, but Weidman refused\n                to do so and informed Jones that this would\n                be against the law.\n\nJ.A.       14   (Compl.    \u00b6   8).       In    this    way,   Weidman   has    clearly\n\ndescribed the circumstances of his refusal to engage in an act\n\nof criminal consequences.\n\n\n       3\n       A Class 1 misdemeanor is punishable by \u201cconfinement in\njail for not more than twelve months and a fine of not more than\n$2,500, either or both.\u201d Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-11(a).\n\n\n                                              16\n\f     Appellees      argue     that    this       claim    cannot       survive       because\n\nWeidman failed to cite the statute in his complaint.                                However,\n\nany deficiency in this regard is merely technical.                             Weidman did\n\nprovide    the    citations    in     his    reply       to    Appellees\u2019       Motion      to\n\nDismiss.     See Mem. Opp\u2019n Mot.

Especially since Weidman\u2019s complaint identified his\n\nrefusal     to    \u201cparticipate        in     illegal          pharmacy     distribution\n\nactivities\u201d as contravening Virginia public policy, his failure\n\nto provide specific citations \u2013 which he in fact provided in his\n\nresponsive pleadings \u2013 cannot be considered failure to \u201cgive the\n\ndefendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon\n\nwhich it rests.\u201d        Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (ellipsis omitted).\n\n     We therefore find that Weidman has sufficiently stated a\n\nwrongful     discharge      claim       under       Virginia\u2019s          public        policy\n\nexception    to   its    at-will     employment      doctrine.
