The State has filed a motion to affirm the judgment\n\nbelow on the ground that it is manifest on the face of Taylor\u2019s opening brief that his\n\nappeal is without merit. We agree and affirm.\n\n      (2)    The record reflects that, in December 2007, a Superior Court jury found\n\nTaylor guilty of six counts of first degree rape, one count of continuous sexual abuse\n\nof a child, and one count of endangering the welfare of a child. After a presentence\n\finvestigation, the Superior Court sentenced Taylor to 115 years of Level V\n\nincarceration, the minimum mandatory term of incarceration for Taylor\u2019s\n\nconvictions.      This Court affirmed Taylor\u2019s convictions and sentence on direct\n\nappeal. 1\n\n         (3)    In June 2009, Taylor filed a motion for a new trial alleging the victim\n\nhad recanted her trial testimony. The Superior Court held an evidentiary hearing on\n\nthe matter and subsequently denied the motion. Taylor did not appeal. In December\n\n2009, Taylor filed a motion for postconviction relief. The Superior Court denied the\n\nmotion, and we affirmed its denial on appeal. 2\n\n         (4)    On June 20, 2019, Taylor filed a second motion for postconviction\n\nrelief. Taylor asserted five claims of \u201cnew evidence\u201d that purportedly entitled him\n\nto relief: (i) his convictions for six counts of rape were inconsistent with the victim\u2019s\n\ntrial testimony; (ii) a juror was prejudiced against him because the trial judge\n\nallegedly admonished the juror\u2019s employer; (iii) trial counsel should have questioned\n\nthe victim about identifying marks on Taylor\u2019s body; (iv) a journal admitted into\n\nevidence at trial showed evidence of a conspiracy between the victim and Taylor\u2019s\n\nex-wife to frame Taylor for rape; and (v) in 2018, the State dropped the charges\n\nagainst another defendant in a similar \u201che-said, she-said\u201d rape case.

Mar. 1, 2011).\n\n\n                                                2\n\fCourt summarily dismissed Taylor\u2019s motion on June 26, 2019. 3              This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n       (5)    In reviewing the Superior Court\u2019s denial of a motion for postconviction\n\nrelief, this Court must first consider the procedural requirements of Rule 61 before\n\nit may consider the merits of any postconviction claim.4 Under Rule 61, a second or\n\nsubsequent motion for postconviction relief is not permitted unless the motion pleads\n\nwith particularity the existence of new evidence that creates a strong inference of\n\nactual innocence or a new rule of constitutional law that is retroactively applicable, 5\n\nor the motion asserts a claim that the court lacked jurisdiction. 6 We agree with the\n\nSuperior Court\u2019s conclusion that Taylor\u2019s second motion for postconviction relief\n\nwas subject to summary dismissal. Taylor\u2019s motion did not plead with particularity\n\nthe existence any new evidence that creates a strong inference that Taylor is actually\n\ninnocent in fact of the acts underlying the charges of which he was convicted or the\n\nexistence of a new rule of constitutional law that applies to his case. Nor did it assert\n\nthat the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction to enter a judgment of conviction and\n\nsentence him.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  State v. Taylor, 2019 WL 2714834 (Del. Super. Ct.
