HORNE v. THE STATE.\n\n      MILLER, Judge.\n\n      Following a jury trial, Damion Horne was convicted of aggravated battery\n\n(OCGA \u00a7 16-5-24 (a)), aggravated assault (OCGA \u00a7 16-5-21 (a) (2) (2008)), false\n\nimprisonment (OCGA \u00a7 16-5-41 (a)), and battery (OCGA \u00a7 16-5-23.1 (a)).1 Horne\n\nappeals from the denial of his motion for new trial, contending that he received\n\nineffective assistance of counsel. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n             On appeal from a criminal conviction, we view the evidence in the\n      light most favorable to support the jury\u2019s verdict, and the defendant no\n      longer enjoys a presumption of innocence. We do not weigh the\n      evidence or judge the credibility of the witnesses, but determine only\n\n      1\n         Horne was also charged with rape (OCGA \u00a7 16-6-1 (a) (1)), two counts of\naggravated sodomy (OCGA \u00a7 16-6-2 (a) (1)), and another count of aggravated\nassault. The trial court declared a mistrial as to these counts when the jury could not\nreach a verdict, and the State subsequently nolle prossed them.\n\f      whether the evidence authorized the jury to find the defendant guilty of\n      the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt in accordance with the standard\n      set forth in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 [99 SCt 2781, 61 LEd2d\n      560] (1979).\n\n(Citation omitted.) Wilson v. State, 318 Ga. App. 37 (733 SE2d 345) (2012).\n\n      So viewed, the evidence shows that the victim and Horne were in a long-term\n\nrelationship and shared a residence. On August 11, 2008, prior to the incident at\n\nissue, the victim called 911 and reported that Horne had physically assaulted her after\n\nhe saw text messages on her phone concerning a sexual relationship with another\n\nman. The responding officer observed that the left side of the victim\u2019s face was very\n\nswollen and she was very upset. Horne, who had left the residence before police\n\narrived, was not arrested.\n\n      On August 18, 2008, the day at issue, the victim called 911 and reported that\n\nHorne came to the house, beat her, raped her, stabbed her with scissors, and would\n\nnot let her leave the house. When police officers responded to the scene, they caught\n\nHorne as he was attempting to flee. A police officer made contact with the victim and\n\nobserved that she was crying, her face was swollen and bruised, one eye was swollen\n\nand bloodshot, and she had wounds on her legs.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f       The victim was transported to the hospital. At the hospital, and during a police\n\ninterview that was recorded and played for the jury, the victim reported that, on the\n\nday in question, Horne accused her of seeing another guy, began hitting her when she\n\ndenied it, and then grabbed her by her hair and dragged her upstairs, where he threw\n\nher onto the bed and resumed hitting her while threatening to kill her.\n\n       A few months before the trial, the victim married Horne. At Horne\u2019s trial, the\n\nvictim recanted her allegations of abuse. In particular, the victim testified that she lied\n\nabout the August 11 and August 18 incidents; most of her injuries were the result of\n\nconsensual rough sex with Horne, while other injuries were self-inflicted; and Horne\n\ndid not become physically violent with her, never threatened to kill her, and never hit\n\nher on the head. The victim testified that she lied about Horne hurting her and\n\nthreatening to kill her because she hoped to get Horne into trouble for wanting to\n\nleave her.\n\n       After the victim recanted, the State called an expert in the field of intimate\n\npartner violence. The expert testified about the behaviors of victims of such violence,\n\nincluding that some of these victims minimize the acts of violence because they want\n\nto stay with the abuser, they often return to their abuser after an incident of violence,\n\nvictims often change their mind about participating in the prosecution of such\n\n                                            3\n\foffenses and victims sometimes recant their claims of abuse once they realize the\n\nramifications of filing a police report.\n\n      1. In three related enumerations of error, Horne contends that trial counsel was\n\nineffective in handling the testimony of the State\u2019s expert witness. Horne has failed\n\nto establish that trial counsel was ineffective.\n\n              To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a\n      defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that\n      the deficient performance so prejudiced the defendant that there is a\n      reasonable likelihood that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the outcome of the\n      trial would have been different. [See] Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\n      S. 668, 687 [104 SCt 2052, 80 LEd2d 674] (1984). If an appellant fails\n      to meet his or her burden of proving either prong of the Strickland test,\n      the reviewing court does not have to examine the other prong. In\n      reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision, we accept the trial court\u2019s factual\n      findings and credibility determinations unless clearly erroneous, but we\n      independently apply the legal principles to the facts. Furthermore, there\n      is a strong presumption that the performance of counsel was within the\n      wide range of reasonable professional lawyering, and we cannot reach\n      a contrary conclusion unless defendant successfully rebuts the\n      presumption by clear and convincing evidence. Judicial scrutiny of\n      counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\n\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Bridges v. State, 286 Ga. 535, 537 (1) (690 SE2d\n\n136) (2010).\n\n      (a) At trial, trial counsel filed a motion in limine to exclude the expert\u2019s\n\ntestimony regarding the behaviors of victims of intimate partner violence because the\n\n\n                                           4\n\fexpert\u2019s testimony was not admissible and there was no evidence the victim was in\n\na cycle of abuse. While Horne argues that trial counsel could have supported the\n\nmotion in limine with better authority and with a better understanding of the factual\n\ncircumstances involved in this case, trial counsel\u2019s decision on how to argue the\n\nmotion is considered strategic and rarely constitutes reversible error. See Pitts v.\n\nState, 272 Ga. App. 182, 188-189 (4) (a) (612 SE2d 1) (2005).\n\n      In any case, Horne cannot establish that the motion in limine would likely have\n\nbeen granted because the expert\u2019s testimony was clearly relevant to explain why a\n\nvictim of intimate partner violence might recant in order to protect the abuser from\n\nprosecution. See Parrish v. State, 237 Ga. App. 274, 277 (2) (i) (514 SE2d 458)\n\n(1999) (where victim\u2019s credibility is at issue, expert testimony regarding abusive\n\nrelationships is relevant to explain the victim\u2019s behavior); see also Housing Auth. of\n\nthe City of Macon v. Younis, 279 Ga. App. 599 (631 SE2d 802) (2006) (\u201cA motion\n\nin limine should [only] be granted when there is no circumstance under which the\n\nevidence under scrutiny is likely to be admissible at trial.\u201d) (citation omitted). Indeed,\n\n      [t]he battered person syndrome is a complex area of human response and\n      behavior. Therefore, expert testimony must be admitted because it\n      supplies an interpretation of the facts which differs from the ordinary lay\n      perception.\n\n\n                                            5\n\f(Citations and punctuation omitted; emphasis supplied.) Watson v. State, 278 Ga. 763,\n\n771-772 (11) (604 SE2d 804) (2004). Since the expert\u2019s testimony was admissible,\n\nHorne cannot show that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in his handling\n\nof the motion in limine.\n\n      (b) Horne next argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to effectively\n\nchallenge the expert witness\u2019s testimony, because there was evidence that\n\ncontradicted or did not support the three-phase \u201cbattering cycle\u201d that develops in\n\nabusive relationships.2\n\n      Decisions regarding\n\n      how to deal with the presentation of an expert witness by the opposing\n      side, including whether to present counter expert testimony, to rely upon\n      cross-examination, to forego cross-examination and/or to forego\n      development of certain expert opinion, is a matter of trial strategy\n      which, if reasonable, cannot be the basis for a successful ineffective\n      assistance of counsel claim.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n        \u201cThe \u2018battering cycle\u2019 consists of three phases: the \u2018tension-building\u2019 stage\nin which minor abusive episodes occur and the [victim] attempts to be as placating\nand passive as possible to avoid more serious violence; the \u2018acute battering\u2019 stage in\nwhich explosive violence occurs; and the \u2018contrition\u2019 stage in which the batterer asks\nfor forgiveness and makes promises, such as to seek help and to refrain from further\nviolence.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Johnson v. State, 266 Ga. 624, 626 (2), n.4 (469 SE2d\n152) (1996).\n\n                                           6\n\f(Citation and punctuation omitted.) Brown v. State, 292 Ga. 454, 456-457 (2) (738\n\nSE2d 591) (2013).\n\n      Here, trial counsel testified at the new trial hearing that the expert witness\n\ntestified about basic principles that were widely accepted and that no expert in the\n\nfield would refute. Trial counsel further testified that he did not seek an additional\n\nexpert on the issue of battered person syndrome because the defense\u2019s theory was that\n\nmany of the victim\u2019s injuries resulted from consensual rough sex and that she\n\nfabricated some of the allegations of abuse in order to retaliate against Horne for\n\nwanting to leave her. In light of these circumstances, Horne cannot overcome the\n\nstrong presumption that trial counsel\u2019s decisions regarding how to deal with the\n\nState\u2019s expert fell within the range of sound trial strategy and reasonable professional\n\njudgment.\n\n      Moreover, Horne cannot establish prejudice from trial counsel\u2019s failure to\n\npresent evidence showing that the victim\u2019s behaviors did not comport with battered\n\nperson syndrome. The expert witness did not evaluate the victim, opine that the\n\nvictim suffered from this syndrome, or specify that the victim recanted in this case\n\nbecause she was a battered person. While Horne argues that trial counsel should have\n\nchallenged the expert\u2019s testimony that false reporting occurs less than one percent of\n\n                                           7\n\fthe time, the expert did not opine on the veracity of the victim\u2019s report to police in\n\nthis case.\n\n      The jury is the arbiter of credibility, and it was able to assess all of the evidence\n\nand determine whether the victim\u2019s recantation was credible. See Lowery v. State, 264\n\nGa. App. 655, 657 (3) (592 SE2d 102) (2003) (it is for the jury to determine the\n\ncredibility of witnesses, and the jury may reject a witness\u2019s explanation where it is\n\ninconsistent with or does not explain other evidence). The jury was entitled to reject\n\nthe victim\u2019s trial testimony and rely upon her prior statements, which constituted\n\nsubstantive evidence. See Meeks v. State, 281 Ga. App. 334, 336 (636 SE2d 77)\n\n(2006) (\u201c[E]ven though a witness may recant on the stand, her prior inconsistent\n\nstatements constitute substantive evidence on which the factfinder may rely.\u201d)\n\n(citation and punctuation omitted). Given the victim\u2019s prior statements to police and\n\nhospital staff that Horne assaulted her, along with those witnesses\u2019 observations\n\ncorroborating the same, there is no reasonable likelihood that the outcome of the trial\n\nwould have been different had trial counsel more thoroughly challenged the State\u2019s\n\nexpert to show that the victim did not suffer from battered person syndrome.\n\nTherefore, Horne has failed to establish that trial counsel was ineffective on this\n\nground.\n\n                                            8\n\f      2. Horne next contends that trial counsel was ineffective for using the defense\n\nof consent for the charges of aggravated assault, aggravated battery, and battery. We\n\ndiscern no error.\n\n      \u201cTrial tactics and strategy, however mistaken they may appear with hindsight,\n\nare almost never adequate grounds for finding trial counsel ineffective unless they are\n\nso patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have chosen them.\u201d\n\n(Citation and footnote omitted.) Terrell v. State, 276 Ga. App. 102, 104 (2) (622 SE2d\n\n434) (2005).\n\n      Regardless of whether consent is a valid defense to aggravated assault,\n\naggravated battery, or battery, Horne has failed to establish that trial counsel was\n\nineffective. Horne was charged with rape, two counts of aggravated assault,\n\naggravated battery, two counts of aggravated sodomy, false imprisonment, and\n\nbattery. Trial counsel testified that the general defense strategy was that the victim\n\nconsented to sex; many of the victim\u2019s injuries were the result of consensual rough\n\nsex; the injury to the victim\u2019s eye was self-inflicted during the August 11th argument;\n\nand the victim fabricated other allegations of abuse in order to retaliate against Horne.\n\nHorne concedes that the defense was reasonable as to some of his charged offenses,\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fin particular the rape and aggravated sodomy counts that were nolle prossed after the\n\njury could not reach a verdict.\n\n      Given the favorable outcome as to nolle prossed offenses, we cannot say that\n\ntrial counsel\u2019s decision to consistently employ the consent defense, whether \u201cwise or\n\nunwise,\u201d was a patently unreasonable trial strategy. Cf. Lambert v. State, 287 Ga. 774,\n\n776 (2) ( 700 SE2d 354) (2010) (despite presenting legally invalid coercion defense\n\nto murder charge, trial counsel was not ineffective where trial counsel was\n\nconstrained by defendant\u2019s admission that he committed fatal beating).\n\n      3. Horne also contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object\n\nto the improper argument of the prosecuting attorney. Specifically, Horne argues that\n\nthe following portion of the State\u2019s argument was improper:\n\n      We seek justice. We seek justice, and we\u2019re not trying to punish\n      innocent people.\n\n      We agree with Horne that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was improper. See Powell\n\nv. State, 291 Ga. 743, 745-746 (2) (733 SE2d 294) (2012) (forbidding arguments\n\nproviding or implying that the government only prosecutes guilty people). However,\n\n\u201cit is important to view those remarks not in isolation, but in their proper context.\u201d\n\n(Citation omitted.) Id. at 746-747 (2) (b).\n\n\n                                          10\n\f      Here, before the prosecutor made the improper comment, trial counsel\n\nchallenged the prosecution and investigation of the case by arguing that the State was\n\nconvinced of Horne\u2019s guilt as soon as it arrested him because it did not corroborate\n\nthe victim\u2019s outcry and ignored evidence undermining her claims. Specifically, trial\n\ncounsel argued that the State conducted little, if any investigation, after Horne was\n\narrested, ignored the lack of evidence of sexual assault, only briefly interviewed the\n\nvictim following her release from the hospital, and failed to contact the police officer\n\nwho responded to the August 11 911 call or interview individuals who witnessed the\n\nincident, which would have revealed that the victim was not credible. When the\n\nprosecutor made her closing argument, the prosecutor pointed out that several\n\nimpartial witnesses, including police officers and hospital staff, who made contact\n\nwith the victim following the August 18 incident testified at the trial. The prosecutor\n\nthen stated\n\n      [all of these witnesses] would have to be in a conspiracy to get Horne.\n      And we don\u2019t know him. The State, I promise you, was . . . minding\n      their own business when the victim called the police, twice. Not once,\n      but twice. She called on him and said, help me; He\u2019s trying to kill me.\n      We didn\u2019t even know who he was before she called.\n\n      ...\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f      But why would the State get into a conspiracy to get him? Why would\n      these witnesses get into [a] conspiracy to get him? We seek justice. We\n      seek justice, and we\u2019re not trying to punish innocent people.\n\nSoon after these remarks, the prosecutor conceded that Horne was presumed innocent,\n\nand asked the jury to find him guilty based on the trial evidence.\n\n      Given the context of the prosecutor\u2019s statements,\n\n      [w]e conclude that . . . the improper remarks of the prosecuting attorney\n      did not undermine the fundamental fairness of the trial, and any\n      potential harm was mitigated by the jury\u2019s understanding that the\n      prosecutor was countering defense counsel\u2019s attack on the prosecution\u2019s\n      integrity. . . . Moreover, at the close of the case, the trial court\n      specifically instructed the jury that neither the indictment nor closing\n      arguments should be considered as evidence.\n\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.) Powell, supra, 291 Ga. at 749 (2) (b). Under\n\nthese circumstances, Horne has failed to establish a reasonable likelihood that, absent\n\nthe failure of his lawyer to object to the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks, the outcome\n\nof the trial would have been different. Id.\n\n      4. Horne contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a special\n\ndemurrer to the aggravated battery count, which allowed the jury to convict him of\n\nfracturing the victim\u2019s cheekbone based on the uncharged altercation on August 11,\n\n2008, rather than the charged assault of August 18. We disagree.\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f      Since \u201ca defendant can be re-indicted after the grant of a special demurrer, a\n\nfailure to file such a demurrer generally will not support a finding of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.\u201d (Citations and punctuation omitted.) Lewis v. State, 304 Ga.\n\nApp. 831, 837 (5) (698 SE2d 365) (2010). \u201cTo succeed on his ineffective assistance\n\nclaim, [Horne] was required to show that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to specially demur\n\nmaterially impacted his ability to present a defense, thereby creating a reasonable\n\nprobability that counsel\u2019s deficiency changed the outcome of the case.\u201d (Citation and\n\npunctuation omitted.) Id.\n\n      Here, the aggravated battery count charged that, on August 18, 2008, Horne\n\n\u201cdid maliciously cause bodily harm to [the victim] by seriously disfiguring her face;\n\nsaid accused having accomplished said act by striking said [victim] about the face\n\ncausing a fracture to her cheek bone, forehead to swell and eye to blacken.\u201d Horne\n\nhas not shown that trial counsel\u2019s failure to demur materially impacted his ability to\n\npresent a defense since, although he argued that the date of the injury was unclear, his\n\ndefense at trial was that the victim\u2019s injury was accidentally self-inflicted.\n\nAccordingly, trial counsel\u2019s failure to demur affords no basis for reversal. See Lewis,\n\nsupra, 304 Ga. App. at 837-838 (5).\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f      5. Horne contends that trial counsel was also ineffective for failing to request\n\njury charges on lesser included offenses.\n\n      (a) Horne first argues that trial counsel should have requested a jury charge on\n\nsimple battery as a lesser included offense of aggravated assault. We disagree.\n\n      Here, the indictment charged that Horne committed the aggravated assault by\n\nrepeatedly striking the victim with a paddle, a \u201cmeans likely to cause serious bodily\n\ninjury when used offensively against the person.\u201d Former OCGA \u00a7 16-5-21 (a) (2)\n\nprovides that a person commits the offense of aggravated assault when that person\n\nassaults another person with any object which, when used offensively against a\n\nperson, is likely to or actually does result in serious bodily injury. A person commits\n\nan assault by attempting to commit a violent injury to the person of another or by\n\ncommitting an act that places another in reasonable apprehension of immediately\n\nreceiving a violent injury. OCGA \u00a7 16-5-20 (a).\n\n      Contrary to Horne\u2019s argument, former OCGA \u00a7 16-5-21 (a) (2) does not require\n\nthat the State prove actual injuries. See Gutierrez v. State, 235 Ga. App. 878, 882 (3)\n\n(510 SE2d 570) (1998) (aggravated assault conviction does not require actual injury,\n\nas the State may establish commission of offense by showing that serious bodily\n\ninjury is likely to result from the assault). Additionally, while Horne suggests that he\n\n                                          14\n\fonly struck the victim once, the victim confirmed that Horne struck her with a paddle\n\non the back and on the legs, suggesting that the Horne struck her more than once.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the failure to request a jury instruction on a lesser\n\nincluded offense of battery cannot support a claim of ineffective assistance because\n\nthe evidence does not reasonably raise the issue that Horne may be guilty only of\n\nbattery. See, e.g., Ellis v. State, 316 Ga. App. 352, 365 (7) (d) (729 SE2d 492) (2012).\n\n      (b) Horne argues that trial counsel also should have requested a jury charge on\n\nbattery as a lesser included offense of aggravated battery. Horne was charged with\n\naggravated battery for maliciously causing bodily harm to the victim by seriously\n\ndisfiguring her face by striking the victim and causing a fracture to her cheek bone.\n\nAt trial, Horne asserted that the victim\u2019s injury was self-inflicted when, on August 11,\n\n2008, one week prior to the incident at issue in this case, she swung a bottle at Horne,\n\nhe blocked her swing, and the bottle ricocheted and hit her in the face. Since Horne\u2019s\n\ndefense was that he did not fracture the victim\u2019s cheekbone, we cannot say that trial\n\ncounsel\u2019s failure to request a jury charge on battery was patently unreasonable. See\n\nLeonard v. State, 279 Ga. App. 192, 195 (2) (b) (630 SE2d 804) (2006) (failure to\n\nrequest lesser included offense of battery in connection with aggravated assault\n\ncharge based on an all or nothing defense was not patently unreasonable).\n\n                                          15\n\f       6. In his last enumeration of error, Horne contends that trial counsel was\n\nineffective for failing to request a limiting instruction on the statute of limitation for\n\nthe aggravated battery count, because this instruction conflicted with the trial court\u2019s\n\njury charge on prior difficulties. We disagree.\n\n       During the victim\u2019s testimony about the August 11 incident, the trial court\n\ninstructed the jury that it was to consider this evidence only for the purpose of\n\ndetermining the state of feelings between Horne and the victim, and for no other\n\npurpose. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial court instructed the jury that the State\n\nwas permitted to prove the commission of an offense on any date within the statute\n\nof limitations, so long as the indictment did not specifically allege that the date of the\n\noffense was material.\n\n       Horne speculates that these two instructions conflicted and this conflict created\n\na strong possibility that the jury convicted him of aggravated battery based on injuries\n\nthe victim suffered during the August 11 incident. In considering a claim that the\n\ndefendant was convicted in a manner not alleged in the indictment, however, we\n\nfocus on the record evidence and do not engage in conjecture or speculation.\n\nMcCrickard v. State, 249 Ga. App. 715, 717-718 (1) (c) (549 SE2d 505) (2001).\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\f             Here, the trial court charged the jury on the specific allegations of\n      the indictment. The court charged the jury that the State must prove the\n      allegations of the indictment. The evidence established the allegations\n      of the indictment. Other than the fact that prior difficulties evidence\n      exists in the record, there is nothing to indicate the jury either was\n      confused or ignored the trial court\u2019s instructions and actually used such\n      prior difficulties evidence to convict in a manner not alleged in the\n      indictment.\n\n(Punctuation omitted.) McCrickard , supra, 249 Ga. App. at 718 (1) (c).\n\n      Even assuming that the victim broke her cheekbone on August 11th, as\n\nsuggested by Horne, the cheekbone fracture was not a material element of the offense,\n\nand there is evidence of other serious disfigurement to support the aggravated battery\n\nconviction. Notably, the detective testified that he observed that the victim had\n\npuncture wounds on her head, her eye was red and bruised, and she had knots all over\n\nher forehead, and it was for the jury to decide whether the disfigurement was serious.\n\nSee Feagin v. State, 317 Ga. App. 543, 545 (1) (731 SE2d 778) (2012); see also\n\nGanas v. State, 245 Ga. App. 645, 646 (1) (a) (537 SE2d 758) (2000) (severe bruising\n\nmay constitute serious disfigurement). Under these circumstances, Horne\u2019s claim that\n\ntrial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a limiting instruction fails.\n\n      Judgment affirmed. Andrews, P. J., and Branch, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\f",
