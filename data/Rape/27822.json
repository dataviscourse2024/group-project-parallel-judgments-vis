We recently recognized,\n\n        however, that placing the burden of proving a consent defense on the defendant\n\n        violates the defendant\u2019s due process rights. State v. W.R., 181 Wn.2d 757, 763, 336\n\n        P.3d 1134 (2014). Now, \u201conce a defendant asserts a consent defense and provides\n\n        sufficient evidence to support the defense, the State bears the burden of proving lack\n\n        of consent as part of its proof of the element of forcible compulsion.\u201d Id.\n\n                                                   1\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\n       The question in this case is whether the instructions given in Leland Knapp\u2019s\n\ntrial adequately communicated that updated rule to the jury. Because the instructions\n\nproperly informed the jury of the applicable law, were not misleading, and permitted\n\nKnapp to argue his theory of the case, we hold they are constitutionally adequate.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm Knapp\u2019s conviction.\n\n                      FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       The facts in this case are disputed. The parties agree only that Knapp had\n\nintercourse with B.S.1 on Super Bowl Sunday, February 7, 2016; that Knapp was\n\nhigh on methamphetamine at the time; and that Knapp and B.S. had been friends\n\nsince high school, when B.S. was Knapp\u2019s boss at a Jack in the Box restaurant. The\n\nremaining facts are contested.\n\nI.     The State\u2019s Version of Events\n\n       Knapp unexpectedly came to B.S.\u2019s house shortly before the Super Bowl\n\nstarted. Knapp was high on methamphetamine and had consumed alcohol earlier in\n\nthe day, the combination of which left Knapp significantly impaired. Knapp sat with\n\nB.S. on the couch and began making sexual and vulgar comments, which was out of\n\ncharacter and made B.S. uncomfortable. When he leaned in for a kiss, B.S. told\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Consistent with the State\u2019s briefing, we identify the person who survived this rape\nby her initials.\n                                             2\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\nKnapp, \u201c\u2018That\u2019s not gonna happen\u2019\u201d and \u2018\u201cNo.\u201d\u2019 4 Verbatim Report of Proceedings\n\n(VRP) at 616. Knapp quickly left the house.\n\n      But Knapp soon returned, claiming he left his bandana behind. Once back\n\ninside the house, Knapp threw B.S. to the ground and began pulling down her pants.\n\nB.S. resisted, \u201c[t]rying to pull them back up and telling [Knapp], \u2018No.\u2019\u201d Id. at 617.\n\nB.S. heard her neighbors outside and screamed for help, but the neighbors did not\n\nhear her. Knapp gagged B.S. with his bandana so she could not scream anymore.\n\n      As they continued to struggle, Knapp removed the bandana from B.S.\u2019s mouth\n\nand tried to use it to tie her hands together. B.S. attempted to escape, scooting away\n\non the floor as she tried to pull her pants back up. Knapp caught B.S., pinned her\n\nagainst a wall, and raped her. Knapp then fled, but not before telling B.S. that she\n\nwould never know if she was \u201chis first or his 16th rape.\u201d Id. at 626.\n\n      B.S. called her mother, then she called the police. The police took B.S.\u2019s\n\nstatement and transported her to the hospital, where an examination revealed genital\n\ninjuries consistent with rape. Police apprehended Knapp soon after and, though no\n\nofficer told Knapp he was under arrest for rape, Knapp stated, \u2018\u201cIt\u2019s her word against\n\nmine.\u201d\u2019 Id. at 650. An analysis of Knapp\u2019s bandana\u2014which he again left at B.S.\u2019s\n\nhouse\u2014identified genetic material that matched B.S.\u2019s saliva and skin cells,\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\nconsistent with B.S.\u2019s statement to police. The Benton County prosecutor charged\n\nKnapp with rape in the second degree by forcible compulsion.\n\nII.   Knapp\u2019s Version of Events\n\n      Knapp acknowledged he visited B.S. at her house on Super Bowl Sunday,\n\noffering several reasons for his visit, including to \u201cinvite [B.S.] to a birthday party,\u201d\n\n\u201cpay her back the money [he] owed her,\u201d \u201csay that [he] had cancer,\u201d and/or simply\n\n\u201cto say hello to a friend.\u201d Id. at 638, 660. Knapp claims B.S. began demanding\n\ndrugs when she realized he was high. When Knapp refused, B.S. became angry, so\n\nKnapp left.\n\n      Soon after, Knapp realized he forgot his bandana at B.S.\u2019s house and returned\n\nto retrieve it. B.S. again asked Knapp to share methamphetamine with her and\n\noffered sex in exchange. According to Knapp, this was an arrangement he and B.S.\n\nhad made on previous occasions. Knapp decided to \u201cget her high and have sex with\n\nher.\u201d Id. at 643. Knapp and B.S. had intercourse, which Knapp argued was\n\nconsensual.\n\n      Afterward, Knapp \u201cmisplaced the methamphetamines\u201d and B.S. became\n\n\u201cpretty irate.\u201d Id. at 644. B.S. threatened to call the police and falsely accuse Knapp\n\nof rape. Knapp left and was soon stopped by police, but initially assumed he was\n\nstopped for his outstanding legal financial obligations. Knapp told police, \u2018\u201cIt\u2019s her\n\n\n                                           4\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\nword against mine\u201d\u2019 when he deduced that B.S. had, in fact, called the police to\n\naccuse him of rape. Id. at 650.\n\nIII.   Procedural History\n\n       After three days of trial,2 the trial court instructed the jury, using the\n\nWashington Pattern Jury Instructions: Criminal (WPICs) for cases involving second\n\ndegree rape by forcible compulsion. Those instructions had been recently revised in\n\naccordance with our decision in W.R. See 11 WASHINGTON PRACTICE: WASHINGTON\n\nPATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS: CRIMINAL 18.25 cmt. at 304-05 (4th ed. 2016)\n\n(WPIC). The trial court used three pattern instructions relevant here.\n\n       The first instruction lays out the elements of second degree rape that the State\n\nmust prove in order to convict the defendant of second degree rape under RCW\n\n9A.44.050, including that the defendant used \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d to have sex with\n\nthe survivor.    WPIC 41.02, at 833.        The second instruction defines \u201cforcible\n\ncompulsion\u201d as \u201cphysical force that overcomes resistance, or a threat . . . that places\n\na person in fear of death or physical injury to oneself or another person or in fear of\n\nbeing kidnapped or that another person will be kidnapped.\u201d WPIC 45.03, at 918.\n\nAnd the third instruction provides that \u201c[e]vidence of consent may be taken into\n\n\n       2\n         This trial was Knapp\u2019s second. Immediately after the jury returned the verdict in\nKnapp\u2019s first trial, the presiding juror revealed that she had made material\nmisrepresentations during voir dire, and the trial court granted Knapp\u2019s motion for a new\ntrial. No aspect of Knapp\u2019s first trial is at issue here.\n                                            5\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\nconsideration in determining whether the defendant used forcible compulsion to\n\nhave [sexual intercourse].\u201d WPIC 18.25, at 304 (second alteration in original).\n\n      Knapp objected to the second and third pattern instructions, arguing they did\n\nnot adequately inform the jury that the State bears the burden of proving lack of\n\nconsent beyond a reasonable doubt.            Knapp proposed a pair of alternative\n\ninstructions defining forcible compulsion and describing how evidence of consent\n\nmay be used. Knapp\u2019s proposed instruction on forcible compulsion provided:\n\n      Forcible compulsion exists when both of the following elements are present:\n             (1) a person has not consented to sexual intercourse, [and]\n             (2) that person has been subjected to physical force that overcomes\n      resistance, or a threat . . . .\n\nClerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 411 (emphasis added). Knapp\u2019s proposed instruction on\n\nconsent provided:\n\n      Consent means that at the time of the act of sexual intercourse there are actual\n      words or conduct indicating a freely given agreement to have sexual\n      intercourse. The defendant has no burden to prove that the sexual intercourse\n      was consensual. It is the State\u2019s burden to prove the absence of consent\n      beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nCP at 412.\n\n      The trial court rejected Knapp\u2019s proposed instructions, reasoning those\n\ninstructions would inappropriately add an element to the crime charged. The court\n\ninstructed the jury using the updated WPICs, and the jury convicted Knapp.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\n      Knapp timely appealed, arguing the pattern jury instructions were\n\nconstitutionally inadequate because, contrary to this court\u2019s decision in W.R., they\n\ndo not specifically instruct the jury that the State bears the burden of disproving\n\nconsent beyond a reasonable doubt. Division Three of the Court of Appeals affirmed\n\nKnapp\u2019s conviction. Knapp then petitioned this court for review, which we granted.\n\nState v. Knapp, 195 Wn.2d 1014, 461 P.3d 1197 (2020).\n\n                                    ANALYSIS\n\n      The question before us is straightforward: Do Washington\u2019s updated pattern\n\njury instructions for second degree rape by forcible compulsion adequately convey\n\nthat the State bears the burden to prove lack of consent as part of its proof of the\n\nelement of forcible compulsion? We hold today that they do.\n\n      In criminal trials, due process \u201crequires that jury instructions adequately\n\nconvey to the jury that the State bears the burden of proving \u2018every element of the\n\ncrime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d State v. Imokawa, 194 Wn.2d 391, 396,\n\n450 P.3d 159 (2019) (quoting State v. Brown, 147 Wn.2d 330, 339, 58 P.3d 889\n\n(2002)). A corollary rule is that a defendant cannot be required to disprove any fact\n\nthat constitutes the crime charged. So when a defendant raises a defense that would\n\nnecessarily negate an element of the crime charged, the jury instructions must make\n\nclear that the State bears the burden of disproving that defense. See W.R., 181 Wn.2d\n\n\n                                         7\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\nat 763 (\u201c[O]nce a defendant asserts a consent defense and provides sufficient\n\nevidence to support the defense, the State bears the burden of proving lack of consent\n\nas part of its proof of the element of forcible compulsion.\u201d).\n\n       \u201cWhen instructing the jury that the State has the burden to disprove a defense,\n\n\u2018a specific instruction is preferable, but failure to provide one is not reversible per se\n\nso long as the instructions, taken as a whole, make it clear that the State has the\n\nburden.\u201d\u2019 Imokawa, 194 Wn.2d at 397 (quoting State v. Acosta, 101 Wn.2d 612,\n\n621, 683 P.2d 1069 (1984)). Jury instructions are constitutionally adequate \u201cwhen,\n\ntaken as a whole, they properly inform the jury of the applicable law, are not\n\nmisleading, and permit the defendant to argue his theory of the case.\u201d State v. Tili,\n\n139 Wn.2d 107, 126, 985 P.2d 365 (1999). Because jury instructions are statements\n\nof law, we review challenges to the accuracy and adequacy of jury instructions de\n\nnovo. State v. Bennett, 161 Wn.2d 303, 307, 165 P.3d 1241 (2007).\n\n       Knapp challenges the trial court\u2019s instructions on the forcible compulsion\n\nelement of second degree rape and consent, which followed WPIC 45.03 and 18.25.\n\nHe claims our decision in W.R. requires the State to prove forcible compulsion and\n\nlack of consent, so his proposed instructions are a more accurate statement of the\n\nlaw.   Knapp argues the pattern jury instructions given by the trial court are\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\nconstitutionally inadequate because they did not explicitly provide that the State\n\nbears the burden to prove lack of consent beyond all reasonable doubt.\n\n      Knapp\u2019s argument is flawed for three reasons. First, Knapp misunderstands\n\nour decision in W.R.: we did not hold that the State must prove lack of consent\n\nseparate and apart from forcible compulsion but, rather, that \u201cthe State bears the\n\nburden of proving lack of consent as part of its proof of the element of forcible\n\ncompulsion.\u201d 181 Wn.2d at 763 (emphasis added). Second, Knapp does not show\n\nthe trial court\u2019s jury instructions failed to adequately convey that the State bears the\n\nburden of proof. Finally, Knapp\u2019s proposed instructions would impermissibly add\n\nlack of consent as a separate element for the crime of second degree rape by forcible\n\ncompulsion. The trial court properly rejected Knapp\u2019s proposed instructions and\n\ninstructed the jury according to the pattern jury instructions applicable to second\n\ndegree rape by forcible compulsion.\n\nI.    Consent and Forcible Compulsion Are Not Independent Elements of Second\n      Degree Rape; One Negates the Other\n\n      In W.R., this court overturned 25 years of precedent and recognized that \u201cdue\n\nprocess prohibits shifting the burden to the defendant to prove consent.\u201d 181 Wn.2d\n\nat 768. We did so in part because the United States Supreme Court had recently\n\n\u201cclarified that the prosecution must always bear the burden of disproving a defense\n\nthat necessarily negates an element of the charged offense.\u201d Id. at 764 (citing Smith\n\n                                           9\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\nv. United States, 568 U.S. 106, 110, 133 S. Ct. 714, 184 L. Ed. 2d 570 (2013)). We\n\nexplained that \u201cforcible compulsion contemplates force that overcomes actual\n\nresistance or threats that place a person in actual fear[, so t]here can be no forcible\n\ncompulsion when the victim consents, as there is no resistance to overcome.\u201d Id. at\n\n765. In the context of rape, consent and forcible compulsion are mutually exclusive.\n\n      \u201cBecause the defense of consent necessarily negates the element of forcible\n\ncompulsion,\u201d we held the \u201cdefendant cannot be burdened with proving consent by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, as the burden must remain on the State to prove\n\nforcible compulsion beyond reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at 766-67. Accordingly, \u201cthe\n\nState can require the defendant to prove that defense only to the extent of creating a\n\nreasonable doubt as to his or her guilt.\u201d Id. at 766 (citing State v. Riker, 123 Wn.2d\n\n351, 367, 869 P.2d 43 (1994)). Once the defendant has asserted a consent defense\n\nand presented sufficient evidence to support that defense, \u201cthe State bears the burden\n\nof proving lack of consent as part of its proof of the element of forcible compulsion.\u201d\n\nId. at 763.\n\n      Contrary to Knapp\u2019s claims, W.R. did not hold that the State must prove lack\n\nof consent in addition to forcible compulsion. Instead, we explained that consent\n\nand forcible compulsion are \u201cconceptual opposites.\u201d Id. at 768. Evidence of consent\n\nsuggests there was no forcible compulsion, and evidence of forcible compulsion\n\n\n                                          10\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\nsuggests there was no consent. See id. at 766 (\u201c[C]redible evidence of consent\n\nnecessarily raises doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d). Because \u201cforce is an objective\n\nindicator of nonconsent,\u201d Washington law \u201cdo[es] not treat force and nonconsent as\n\nseparate formal elements.\u201d Id. at 767 (citing and quoting Wallace D. Loh, The\n\nImpact of Common Law and Reform Rape Statutes on Prosecution: An Empirical\n\nStudy, 55 WASH. L. REV. 543, 552 n. 43 (1980)).\n\n      For that reason, we observed, \u201cIt is not necessary to add a new instruction on\n\nconsent\u201d because the issue of consent inherently exists within the element of forcible\n\ncompulsion. Id. at 767 n.3. That observation aligns with our approach to jury\n\ninstructions for negating defenses in other contexts, where we have held that\n\n\u201calthough the jury was not explicitly instructed on the State\u2019s burden to disprove\n\n[the defense that negates an element of the crime],\u201d the instructions were\n\nnevertheless constitutionally adequate because \u201cthe defense and the element are\n\nmutually exclusive.\u201d See Imokawa, 194 Wn.2d at 399-400.\n\n      In State v. King, 92 Wn.2d 541, 599 P.2d 522 (1979), we upheld a homicide\n\nconviction even though the jury was not explicitly instructed that the State bore the\n\nburden of proof to disprove the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense. There, the trial\n\ncourt instructed the jury that one element of the crime was that \u2018\u201cthe killing, not\n\nbeing either excusable or justifiable, was done with the intent to cause the death\u201d\u2019 of\n\n\n                                          11\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\nthe victim. Id. at 544 (emphasis omitted). The trial court further instructed the jury\n\nthat \u201c\u2018[t]he killing of a human being is justifiable when committed in the lawful\n\ndefense of the slayer or of any other person in his presence or company.\u201d\u2019 Id. But\n\nthe trial court refused to give the defendant\u2019s proposed instruction on self-defense:\n\n\u201c\u2018When a defendant claims that he killed another in self-defense of his own person\n\nor person in his presence the burden is upon the State to prove beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that there is an absence of self-defense.\u2019\u201d Id. at 543. We affirmed the\n\nconviction, explaining that \u201cinstructions Nos. 20 and 29 allocated to the State the\n\nburden of proof on the issue of self-defense and sufficiently permitted King to argue\n\nhis theory of the case,\u201d even though King did not receive his proposed instruction.\n\nId. at 546.\n\n      Similarly, in Imokawa, we affirmed convictions for vehicular homicide and\n\nvehicular assault even though the jury was not explicitly instructed that the State\n\nbore the burden to prove the absence of a superseding intervening cause. 194 Wn.2d\n\nat 403. The jury was instead instructed that the State bore the burden of proving\n\nproximate cause beyond a reasonable doubt and that proximate cause could, in some\n\ncircumstances, be superseded by an intervening act. Id. at 395. We reasoned that\n\n\u201cproximate cause and presence of a superseding intervening cause are mutually\n\nexclusive,\u201d so the \u201ctrial court did not need to explicitly instruct the jury that the State\n\n\n                                            12\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\nhas the burden to prove absence of superseding intervening cause.\u201d Id. at 402. We\n\nconcluded that when \u201ca jury is instructed as to the statutory elements of a crime, that\n\nthe State bears the burden of proving all elements beyond a reasonable doubt, and\n\nthat the defendant has no burden of proof, the instructions as a whole are\n\nconstitutionally adequate and do not violate due process.\u201d Id. at 403.\n\n      The same is true here. As we explained in W.R., the State\u2019s burden to prove\n\nlack of consent is wholly contained within its burden to prove forcible compulsion.\n\nLike proximate cause and superseding intervening cause, consent and forcible\n\ncompulsion are mutually exclusive. The two cannot coexist, so there is no reason to\n\ntreat them as separate, independent elements. The trial court properly instructed\n\nKnapp\u2019s jury on the statutory elements of second degree rape, explained that the\n\nState bears the burden of proving all elements beyond a reasonable doubt, and\n\nacknowledged that \u201c[e]vidence of consent may be taken into consideration in\n\ndetermining whether the defendant used forcible compulsion to have [sexual\n\nintercourse].\u201d WPIC 18.25, at 304 (second alteration in original). Under our\n\nprecedent, these instructions were constitutionally adequate.\n\n      Nevertheless, Knapp argues his jury should have been explicitly instructed\n\nthat the State bears the burden of proving lack of consent beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nbecause that is the only way to ensure the burden is not impermissibly shifted to the\n\n\n                                          13\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\ndefendant. Knapp is mistaken: under our precedent, the jury instructions given at\n\nhis trial made the State\u2019s burden clear.\n\nII.   The Jury Instructions Properly Placed the Burden of Proving Each Element\n      of Second Degree Rape on the State and Did Not Shift the Burden of\n      Proving Consent to Knapp\n\n      We have long held that \u2018\u201ca specific instruction is preferable\u201d\u2019 when\n\ninstructing the jury that the State bears the burden of proving the absence of\n\na negating defense. Imokawa, 194 Wn.2d at 397 (quoting Acosta, 101 Wn.2d at\n\n621 (distinguishing State v. McCullum, 98 Wn.2d 484, 656 P.2d 1064\n\n(1983) (plurality opinion))). But \u2018\u201cfailure to provide one is not reversible per\n\nse so long as the instructions, taken as a whole, make it clear that the State\n\nhas the burden.\u201d\u2019    Id. (quoting Acosta, 101 Wn.2d at 621). \u201c[S]o long as the\n\nburden is not shifted to the defendant in the instructions, the jury need not be\n\ninstructed as to the State\u2019s burden to prove absence of a defense; it need only\n\nbe specifically instructed on the essential elements of the crime.\u201d Id. at 400-01.\n\n      Here, the trial court properly instructed the jury that the State bore the burden\n\nof proof on each element of second degree rape by forcible compulsion and that\n\nKnapp\u2019s consent defense could prevent the State from meeting that burden. The trial\n\ncourt\u2019s instructions on consent were based on WPIC 18.25, as amended following\n\nour decision in W.R. That pattern instruction\u2014designed to instruct the jury on the\n\n\n                                           14\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\ndefense of consent in first and second degree rape\u2014provides that \u201c[e]vidence of\n\nconsent may be taken into consideration in determining whether the defendant used\n\nforcible compulsion to have [sexual intercourse].\u201d WPIC 18.25, at 304 (second\n\nalteration in original).\n\n       Knapp complains WPIC 18.25 inappropriately relieves the State of its burden\n\nto prove forcible compulsion by failing to clearly and unambiguously set forth the\n\nState\u2019s burden to prove lack of consent. He acknowledges our recent holding in\n\nImokawa that trial courts do not need to explicitly instruct the jury that the State has\n\nthe burden to prove the absence of a negating defense, but he attempts to distinguish\n\nthat case because the challenged instructions there included a definition relevant to\n\nthe defense and WPIC 18.25 does not define consent in the same manner. But this\n\nargument is unavailing.\n\n       What matters is not whether one jury instruction provides a definition, but\n\nwhether the instructions as a whole \u201cproperly inform the jury of the applicable law,\n\nare not misleading, and permit the defendant to argue his theory of the case.\u201d Tili,\n\n139 Wn.2d at 12. Here, reading WPIC 18.25 in the context of the other relevant jury\n\ninstructions, the trial court\u2019s instructions clearly meet this standard. WPIC 41.02\n\naccurately explains the elements of second degree rape under RCW 9A.44.010(6),\n\nincluding forcible compulsion, and puts the burden of proof squarely on the State.\n\n\n                                          15\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\nWPIC 45.03 defines \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d according to statute. And WPIC 18.25\n\nexplains evidence of consent is relevant to \u201cdetermining whether the defendant used\n\nforcible compulsion to have [sexual intercourse].\u201d These clear, accurate descriptions\n\nof the law were not misleading.\n\n       Perhaps most importantly, these instructions plainly allowed Knapp to argue\n\nhis theory of the case. Knapp\u2019s defense was that the sexual intercourse was\n\nconsensual, and the instructions allowed him to argue that B.S.\u2019s alleged consent\n\nmeant the State failed to prove forcible compulsion beyond a reasonable doubt. The\n\njury was unconvinced by Knapp\u2019s arguments, but that is not the fault of the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s jury instructions.\n\nIII.   Knapp\u2019s Proposed Jury Instruction Would Impermissibly Add an Element to\n       Second Degree Rape and Reflect Antiquated Notions of How Victims of\n       Sexual Assault Should Act\n\n       As we know, lack of consent is not a separate and distinct element of second\n\ndegree rape by forcible compulsion. W.R., 181 Wn.2d at 763 (\u201cthe State bears the\n\nburden of proving lack of consent as part of its proof of the element of forcible\n\ncompulsion\u201d (emphasis added)). But Knapp\u2019s proposed instruction on forcible\n\ncompulsion, which includes the entirety of WPIC 45.03, would have explicitly added\n\nconsent as an additional element:\n\n       Forcible compulsion exists when both of the following elements are present:\n              (1)  a person has not consented to sexual intercourse, [and]\n\n                                           16\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\n             (2)     that person has been subjected to physical force that overcomes\n      resistance, or a threat . . . .\n\nCP at 411 (emphasis added). Under this instruction, the State would have to prove\n\nlack of consent as a distinct element in addition to its proof of forcible compulsion.\n\nNeither RCW 9A.44.050 nor W.R. makes lack of consent a distinct element of the\n\ncrime of second degree rape by forcible compulsion. Knapp\u2019s proposed instruction\n\neffectively seeks to amend the law and add a new element to the State\u2019s burden.\n\nThe trial court properly rejected that instruction as an incorrect statement of law.\n\n      Worse, Knapp\u2019s proposed instruction represents a retreat from current law\n\nback to antiquated notions of the rape survivor\u2019s \u201cappropriate\u201d behavior, by shifting\n\nthe focus of the trial to the survivor\u2019s (in)actions. The dissent in W.R. warned against\n\nthe consequences of such a retreat: \u201cwrongfully put[ting] the victim\u2019s actions and\n\nreputation on trial\u201d makes victims \u201cless likely to report the rape\u201d because \u201cthey may\n\nfeel that they themselves are on trial.\u201d 181 Wn.2d at 772, 773 (Owens, J., dissenting).\n\nBy adding a separate requirement to prove an element of lack of consent, Knapp\u2019s\n\nproposed instruction would shift the focus of trial \u201cto [the victim\u2019s] actions rather\n\nthan the crime against them.\u201d Id. at 773. Indeed, that is precisely what Knapp\u2019s\n\nstrategy was at trial and during closing arguments. See 4 VRP at 717 (\u201cSo, let\u2019s talk\n\nabout what she said[,] . . . that during this allegation she started screaming, and she\n\nstarted screaming because she heard the neighbors talking outside her mobile home\n\n                                           17\n\fState v. Knapp, No. 98067-5\n\n\n\n. . . . They didn\u2019t come running to the door, banging on the door. They didn\u2019t hear\n\nher. She can hear them talking, but they can\u2019t hear her screaming. It\u2019s a problem\n\n[for the State\u2019s ability to prove lack of consent].\u201d).\n\n        Our decision in W.R. specifically and intentionally avoided that outcome by\n\ndeclining to recognize lack of consent as a separate and distinct element of second\n\ndegree rape by forcible compulsion. We explained \u201cthat the State\u2019s burden to prove\n\nforcible compulsion encompasses the concept of nonconsent [and] is consistent with\n\nrape reform laws\u201d by \u201c\u2018focus[ing] more on the actor\u2019s use or threat of force rather\n\nthan the victim\u2019s conduct as the external criterion of nonconsent.\u2019\u201d Id. at 767\n\n(quoting Loh, supra, at 550). By locating the State\u2019s burden to prove lack of consent\n\nsquarely within its burden to prove forcible compulsion, we maintained the proper\n\nfocus of rape prosecutions on the defendant\u2019s conduct. In this way, W.R.\u2019s holding\n\nbalances the defendant\u2019s due process rights with \u201c\u2018society\u2019s interest in accurately\n\nidentifying perpetrators of rape, not in reinforcing traditional assumptions regarding\n\nappropriate behavior of [virtuous] [men and] women.\u2019\u201d Id. at 773 (alterations in\n\noriginal) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Camara, 113 Wn.2d\n\n631, 639, 781 P.2d 483 (1989); Camara was overruled in part by W.R., 181 Wn.2d\n\n757).\n\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\fState v.

But I write separately to emphasize that trial courts retain discretion\n\nto instruct juries on the statutory definition of consent and the parties\u2019 burdens with\n\nregard to that defense.\n\n        I therefore respectfully concur.\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n   I.      The Jury Instructions Were Constitutionally Adequate\n\n        I agree with the majority that taken as a whole, the jury instructions in this\n\ncase were constitutionally adequate and did not impermissibly shift the burden of\n\nproving consent to the defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                            1\n\fState v. Knapp (Leland Hohn, IV), No. 98067-5\n(Gordon McCloud, J., concurring)\n\n\n\n      As the majority explains, the parties do not contest the fact that Knapp and\n\nB.S. had sexual intercourse on February 7, 2016. The parties do, however, contest\n\nthe details of what happened and whether the acts were consensual. Majority at 2-\n\n5. Knapp\u2019s defense theory was that the acts were all consensual. 4 Verbatim Report\n\nof Proceedings (VRP) (Feb. 7, 2018) at 637, 643, 711.\n\n      The jury received the following instructions relevant to the elements of rape\n\nthat bear on consent. Instruction 7 stated the elements of second degree rape in\n\nviolation of RCW 9A.44.050 as follows:\n\n              To convict the defendant of the crime of rape in the second degree,\n          each of the following three elements of the crime must be proved beyond\n          a reasonable doubt:\n\n             ....\n\n             (2) That the sexual intercourse occurred by forcible compulsion;\n\n             ....\n\nClerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 427; cf. WPIC 1 41.02, at 833-34. Instruction 9 defined\n\n\u201cforcible compulsion\u201d:\n\n              Forcible compulsion means physical force that overcomes resistance,\n          or a threat, express or implied, that places a person in fear of death or\n          physical injury to oneself or another person or in fear of being kidnapped\n          or that another person will be kidnapped.\n\n\n      1\n       11 WASHINGTON PRACTICE: WASHINGTON PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS:\nCRIMINAL (4th ed. 2016) (WPIC).\n                                         2\n\fState v.

And instruction 10 stated the following\n\nabout consent:\n\n          Evidence of consent may be taken into consideration in determining\n          whether the defendant used forcible compulsion to have sexual\n          intercourse.\n\nCP at 430; cf. WPIC 18.25, at 304.\n\n      Knapp argued that instructions 9 and 10 did not make clear that the State is\n\nthe party that bears the burden of proving lack of consent. Majority at 6; 4 VRP\n\n(Feb. 7, 2018) at 680-81. He offered two alternative instructions, discussed infra\n\nPart II. The trial court rejected them. 4 VRP (Feb. 7, 2018) at 682; CP at 411, 412.\n\nAs a result, the jury received no instruction at all on the definition of consent or the\n\nburden of proof on lack of consent.\n\n      Knapp argues that this made the court\u2019s instructions misleading. He\n\ncontends that those instructions conflicted with State v. W.R., which held that\n\n\u201conce a defendant asserts a consent defense and provides sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the defense, the State bears the burden of proving lack of consent as part of\n\nits proof of the element of forcible compulsion.\u201d 181 Wn.2d 757, 763, 336 P.3d\n\n1134 (2014).\n\n      Like the majority, I disagree. In W.R., we made clear that a finding of\n\nforcible compulsion cannot coexist with a finding of consent: \u201cno circumstance\n\n                                           3\n\fState v. Knapp (Leland Hohn, IV), No. 98067-5\n(Gordon McCloud, J., concurring)\n\n\n\ncould exist where a defendant forcibly compels a victim to engage in consensual\n\nsexual intercourse.\u201d Id. at 768. For that reason, we held that making the defendant\n\nbear the burden of proving consent by a preponderance of the evidence violates\n\ndue process clause protections. Id. at 765. Instead, \u201c[w]hile the defendant may be\n\ntasked with producing evidence to put consent in issue, such evidence need only\n\ncreate reasonable doubt as to the victim\u2019s consent.\u201d Id. at 768.\n\n      That holding means that if the State proves forcible compulsion, it has\n\nnecessarily proved lack of consent. See id. at 767. Thus, the court need not always\n\nprovide an additional instruction defining consent in a second degree rape\n\nprosecution. Id. at 767 n.3. Instead, it is sufficient for the court to simply instruct\n\nthe jury on the elements of the crime. Id. And while it is often preferable for the\n\ncourt to explicitly tell the jury that the State bears the burden of disproving a\n\nnegating defense, \u201c\u2018[s]o long as the burden is not shifted to the defendant in\n\nthe instructions, the jury need not be instructed as to the State\u2019s burden to prove\n\nabsence of a defense; it need only be specifically instructed on the essential\n\nelements of the crime.\u2019\u201d Majority at 14 (quoting State v. Imokawa, 194 Wn.2d 391,\n\n400-01, 450 P.3d 159 (2019) (emphasis added)).\n\n      Here, the trial court instructed the jury on the elements of the crime, on the\n\nfact that the State bore the burden of proving each element beyond a reasonable\n\n                                            4\n\fState v.

I therefore\n\nagree with the majority that under our precedent, the instructions were\n\nconstitutionally adequate.\n\n   II.      Trial Courts Must, and Do, Retain the Discretion To Instruct Juries on the\n            Definition of Consent and on the State\u2019s Burden of Proof Regarding\n            Negating Defenses\n\n         Because the conclusion that the jury instructions were constitutionally\n\nadequate is sufficient to answer the question before us, I would end the discussion\n\nthere.\n\n         In its Part III, however, the majority goes on to address Knapp\u2019s first\n\nproposed instruction, which was rejected by the trial court. Majority at 16-17. That\n\nproposed instruction stated, in relevant part,\n\n         Forcible compulsion exists when both of the following elements are present:\n\n               (1) a person has not consented to sexual intercourse,\n               (2) that person has been subjected to physical force that overcomes\n               resistance.\n\nCP at 411. I agree with the majority that the trial court properly rejected this\n\ninstruction because it incorrectly states that lack of consent and forcible\n\ncompulsion are separate \u201celements.\u201d Majority at 17. In fact, as discussed above,\n\nconsent and forcible compulsion are conceptual opposites: by proving forcible\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fState v. Knapp (Leland Hohn, IV), No. 98067-5\n(Gordon McCloud, J., concurring)\n\n\n\ncompulsion, the State necessarily proves lack of consent. W.R., 181 Wn.2d at 767;\n\nsupra Part I.\n\n      The majority does not address Knapp\u2019s second proposed instruction, which\n\nwould have instructed the jury on the definition of \u201cconsent\u201d and the State\u2019s\n\nburden of proof. That proposed instruction read:\n\n      Consent means that at the time of the act of sexual intercourse there are\n      actual words or conduct indicating a freely given agreement to have sexual\n      intercourse. The Defendant has no burden to prove that the sexual\n      intercourse was consensual. It is the State\u2019s burden to prove the absence of\n      consent beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nCP at 412.\n\n      I write to emphasize that trial courts retain the discretion to instruct juries in\n\nthis manner. By leaving the second proposed instruction unaddressed, I believe the\n\nmajority\u2019s Part III\u2014even though it is dicta\u2014creates potential confusion.\n\n       Unlike his first proposed instruction, Knapp\u2019s second proposed instruction,\n\nalone, does not misstate the law or \u201cimpermissibly add an element to the crime.\u201d\n\nMajority at 17, 18. In fact, Knapp\u2019s second proposed instruction would have\n\nprovided the jury with the statutory definition of consent and the accurate\n\nstatement of the parties\u2019 burdens with regard to the defense of consent.\n\n      This is clear, first, from the fact that the first sentence of the proposed\n\ninstruction was identical in all relevant respects to RCW 9A.44.010(7), the\n\n                                           6\n\fState v. Knapp (Leland Hohn, IV), No. 98067-5\n(Gordon McCloud, J., concurring)\n\n\n\nstatutory definition of consent.2 It is thus an accurate statement of the law that was\n\nrelevant to an issue in the case. The second and third sentences of the proposed\n\ninstruction correctly explained the parties\u2019 burdens of proof with regard to the\n\nnegating defense of consent. In W.R., we plainly held that because \u201cconsent\n\nnegates the element of forcible compulsion,\u201d \u201conce a defendant asserts a consent\n\ndefense and provides sufficient evidence to support the defense, the State bears the\n\nburden of proving lack of consent as part of its proof of the element of forcible\n\ncompulsion.\u201d 181 Wn.2d at 763. That is precisely what Knapp\u2019s proposed\n\ninstruction would have stated: \u201cThe Defendant has no burden to prove that the\n\nsexual intercourse was consensual. It is the State\u2019s burden to prove the absence of\n\nconsent beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d CP at 412. Because consent had been raised\n\nas a defense, the State had the burden to disprove it as part of its burden to prove\n\nthe element of forcible compulsion.\n\n       While W.R. held that \u201c[i]t is not necessary to add a new instruction on\n\nconsent simply because evidence of consent is produced,\u201d 181 Wn.2d at 767 n.3\n\n\n\n       2\n         RCW 9A.44.010(7) provides, \u201c\u2018Consent\u2019 means that at the time of the act of\nsexual intercourse or sexual contact there are actual words or conduct indicating freely\ngiven agreement to have sexual intercourse or sexual contact.\u201d WPIC 45.04, at 920, is\nnearly identical. Presumably because this was a rape prosecution rather than a\nprosecution for indecent liberties, Knapp\u2019s proposed instruction omitted the phrase \u201cor\nsexual contact\u201d from his proposed instruction.\n                                             7\n\fState v. Knapp (Leland Hohn, IV), No. 98067-5\n(Gordon McCloud, J., concurring)\n\n\n\n(emphasis added), W.R. did not hold that courts are barred from providing such an\n\ninstruction. Unlike Knapp\u2019s first proposed instruction, which mischaracterized\n\nforcible compulsion and lack of consent as separate elements, his second proposed\n\ninstruction would not have improperly added an element for the State to prove.\n\nInstead, it would have provided a correct, relevant statement of the law and would\n\nhave represented the \u201c\u2018preferable\u2019\u201d approach of giving a \u201c\u2018specific instruction\u2019\u201d on\n\nthe State\u2019s burden to disprove a defense. Majority at 8 (quoting Imokawa, 194\n\nWn.2d at 397).\n\n       There are compelling reasons why a trial court might find it proper to give\n\nsuch an instruction on consent\u2014and I write separately to make clear that this\n\noption remains open.3 Unlike other legal concepts (like those cited by the majority\n\n\n       3\n         As the majority explains, Knapp was tried once before; he sought and obtained a\nnew trial because the presiding juror revealed she had made material misrepresentations\nduring voir dire. Majority at 5 n.2; 3 VRP (Dec. 6, 2017) at 424. That first trial is not at\nissue here. But interestingly, the judge at Knapp\u2019s first trial agreed with Knapp that it was\nappropriate to instruct the jury on consent, reasoning that\n\n       [issues concerning the burden of proof are] of constitutional dimension[.] I don\u2019t\n       see how you can ignore that and not instruct the jury on consent. It just doesn\u2019t\n       seem logical to me and doesn\u2019t seem fair at all to a defendant in these\n       circumstances.\n\n              You know, we have in front of us a case where she clearly says, \u201cHe\n       exercised forcible compulsion, and I did not consent,\u201d and he clearly says, \u201cShe\n       consented.\u201d I think this\u2014the facts of this case do cry out for me to instruct in this\n       way.\n\n                                             8\n\fState v. Knapp (Leland Hohn, IV), No. 98067-5\n(Gordon McCloud, J., concurring)\n\n\n\nin its discussion of negating elements), rape has its own charged history that has\n\nled to significant confusion about what constitutes \u201cconsent.\u201d Lack of consent has\n\nalways been \u201c\u2018the basic substantive element of the crime\u2019\u201d of rape. State v. Lynch,\n\n178 Wn.2d 487, 512, 309 P.3d 482 (2013) (Gordon McCloud, J., concurring)\n\n(quoting Wallace Loh, The Impact of Common Law and Reform Rape Statutes on\n\nProsecution: An Empirical Study, 55 WASH. L. REV. 543, 557 (1980)); W.R., 181\n\nWn.2d at 767. But the way the legal system has defined and measured consent has\n\nchanged significantly, even in recent memory. Today, our law recognizes that if a\n\nperson does not affirmatively communicate their freely given agreement to\n\nparticipate in sexual intercourse, they have not consented. RCW 9A.44.010(7). But\n\nit wasn\u2019t long ago that the law primarily focused on the alleged victim\u2019s resistance\n\nas the objective measure of nonconsent. State v. Severns, 13 Wn.2d 542, 544, 125\n\nP.2d 659 (1942) (element of rape was \u201cforcibly overcoming [the alleged victim\u2019s]\n\nresistance\u201d); State v.

Accordingly, the judge at Knapp\u2019s first trial gave an\ninstruction on consent following WPIC 45.04, at 920, which is essentially identical to the\nstatutory definition of consent. 2 VRP (July 27, 2017) at 358. The court also gave a\nmodified version of WPIC 45.03, at 918, the definition of \u201cforcible compulsion,\u201d which\nexplicitly stated that consent negates forcible compulsion. 2 VRP (July 27, 2017) at 358\n(\u201cForcible compulsion means the absence of consent together with physical force that\novercomes resistance or a threat . . . .\u201d); see also id. at 345.\n\n                                            9\n\fState v. Knapp (Leland Hohn, IV), No. 98067-5\n(Gordon McCloud, J., concurring)\n\n\n\ninstructed that \u201c\u2018in order to constitute the crime of rape[,] force must be used by\n\nthe male, and that force must be sufficient to overcome the will and consent of the\n\nprosecuting witness\u2019\u201d). Even under the rape reform statutes of 1975, a person\n\ncould not be raped by their spouse, under the law, because marriage meant consent\n\nto sexual intercourse. See LAWS OF 1975, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 14, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.\n\nAlthough the marriage defense has been abolished with regard to certain sex\n\noffenses,4 it remains with regard to others. At the time of this writing, a bill is\n\npending in the legislature that would abolish the remaining vestiges of the marriage\n\ndefense. 5\n\n\n\n       4\n         In 1983, the legislature abolished the marital defense to first and second degree\nrape. See LAWS OF 1983, ch. 118, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 (amending RCW 9A.44.040(1) and RCW\n9A.44.050(1)). In 2013, the legislature abolished the marital defense to third degree rape\nand to indecent liberties by forcible compulsion when the victim is incapable of consent\nor when the perpetrator is a health care provider and the victim is a patient. LAWS OF\n2013, ch. 94, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 (amending RCW 9A.44.060(1) and RCW 9A.44.100(1)).\n       5\n         S.B. 5177 deletes language defining certain sex offenses in terms of whether the\nperpetrator was married to the victim. Many sex offense statutes still contain such\nlanguage, including RCW 9A.44.050(1)(c), (e), (f) (second degree rape of a person who\nis developmentally disabled, is a resident of a facility for persons with a mental disorder\nor chemical dependency, or is a frail elder or vulnerable adult), .073 (first degree rape of\na child), .076 (second degree rape of a child), .079 (third degree rape of a child), .083\n(first degree child molestation), .086 (second degree child molestation), .089 (third\ndegree child molestation), .093 (first degree sexual misconduct with a minor), .096\n(second degree sexual misconduct with a minor), and .100 (indecent liberties with a\nperson who is developmentally disabled, is a resident of a facility for persons with a\nmental disorder or chemical dependency, or is a frail elder or vulnerable adult). See S.B.\n5177, 67th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2021).\n                                             10\n\fState v. Knapp (Leland Hohn, IV), No. 98067-5\n(Gordon McCloud, J., concurring)\n\n\n\n      In the recent past, too, even when the defendant was accused of using\n\nphysical violence to subdue the complainant, questions by both parties often\n\ncentered on that complainant\u2019s sexual history and reputation, whether her clothes\n\nsignaled \u201cpermission,\u201d or whether the two had had prior sexual contact\u2014all based\n\non the obviously faulty assumption that this information was relevant to whether\n\nthe complainant consented on the occasion in question. Rape shield statutes, which\n\nmake most evidence regarding an alleged victim\u2019s sexual history inadmissible in a\n\nrape prosecution, were enacted relatively recently as cultural attitudes shifted\n\ntoward an acknowledgment that evidence of prior consent to sexual conduct \u201cis\n\nusually of little or no probative value in predicting the victim\u2019s consent to sexual\n\nconduct on the occasion in question.\u201d State v. Hudlow, 99 Wn.2d 1, 9, 659 P.2d\n\n514 (1983) (explaining that adoption of rape shield statutes nationwide is a \u201crecent\n\ntrend, reversing years of the opposite rule\u201d (footnote omitted)); see also RCW\n\n9A.44.030 (Washington\u2019s rape shield statute, first enacted in 1975).\n\n      These recent, significant, and ongoing developments in the legal system\u2019s\n\nunderstanding of consent illustrate why we should not foreclose a trial court\u2019s\n\nability to instruct a jury on the accurate, statutory definition of consent.\n\n      What is more, providing the modern, affirmative statutory definition of\n\nconsent in the context of a second degree rape prosecution like Knapp\u2019s could help\n\n                                           11\n\fState v. Knapp (Leland Hohn, IV), No. 98067-5\n(Gordon McCloud, J., concurring)\n\n\n\nensure that the jury does not make decisions based on \u201cantiquated notions of the\n\nrape survivor\u2019s \u201cappropriate\u201d behavior.\u201d Majority at 17. As discussed above, the\n\ncommon law approach to rape certainly did focus on the survivor\u2019s resistance as an\n\nobjective measure of nonconsent. But the current statutory definition of consent\n\ndoes not do that. Instead, it focuses on whether a person\u2019s affirmative words or\n\nactions indicate a \u201cfreely given agreement\u201d to sex. RCW 9A.44.010(7). Under this\n\ndefinition, consent logically cannot be inferred from a person\u2019s failure to\n\nphysically resist. Indeed, the only remaining reference to resistance in the statutes\n\nrelevant to this case is contained in the definition of forcible compulsion itself, a\n\nfact the majority doesn\u2019t address. RCW 9A.44.010(6) (\u201cforcible compulsion\u201d\n\nencompasses \u201cphysical force which overcomes resistance . . .\u201d). Thus, providing\n\nour statutory definition of consent would not shift the focus from the actions of the\n\ncomplainant to the actions of the defendant.\n\n      I view the majority\u2019s Part III as an unnecessary addition to the opinion\u2014that\n\nis, as dicta\u2014but I believe its focus only on the first, erroneous proposed instruction\n\nis potentially misleading. Courts must\u2014and do\u2014retain the discretion to instruct\n\nthe jury on the statutory definition of consent and on the parties\u2019 burdens regarding\n\nthe negating defense of consent as they strive to ensure that jury instructions\n\n\u201cproperly inform the jury of the applicable law, are not misleading, and permit the\n\n                                          12\n\fState v.

But trial courts should, and do, retain the ability to\n\nprovide accurate instructions to the jury on the statutory definition of consent and\n\non the parties\u2019 burdens related to consent, when proper. I disagree with any\n\nsuggestion in the majority opinion to the contrary.\n\n      I therefore respectfully concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 ____________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                           13\n\f",
