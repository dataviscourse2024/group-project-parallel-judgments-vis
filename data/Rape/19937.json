Ct. No. MF034272A )\n\n         v.\n\nLEON SMITH,\n\n                   Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n\n\n         A jury convicted defendant Leon Smith of forcible lewd acts upon a child under\nthe age of 14 years (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (b); count 1),1 continuous sexual abuse of a\nchild under the age of 14 years (\u00a7 288.5, subd. (a); count 2), and oral copulation or sexual\npenetration of a child 10 years of age or younger (\u00a7 288.7, subd. (b); count 3).\n         For counts 2 and 3, the trial court sentenced defendant to state prison for a total\nterm of 31 years to life. On the prosecutor\u2019s motion, the court dismissed count 1.\n\n\n1   Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n                                                             1\n\f       Defendant appeals. He contends his conviction on count 3 violates ex post facto\nprinciples.2 We reject this contention and will affirm the judgment.\n                        FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       Count 3 charged defendant with violating section 288.7, subdivision (b) \u201c[o]n or\nabout September 21, 2006 through January 21, 2008.\u201d Section 288.7, subdivision (b)\nprovides: \u201cAny person 18 years of age or older who engages in oral copulation or sexual\npenetration, as defined in Section 289, with a child who is 10 years of age or younger is\nguilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for a term of\n15 years to life.\u201d Section 288.7 was added in 2006, and took effect immediately, on\nSeptember 20, 2006. (Stats. 2006, ch. 337, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 62, pp. 2584, 2590-2591, 2668.) The\nvictim was born on January 22, 1997; thus, on January 22, 2008, the victim turned 11\nyears of age. Defendant was born on January 31, 1971.\n       At trial, the prosecutor presented specific evidence of the dates, the victim\u2019s ages\nand class (kindergarten to seventh grade), and the types of defendant\u2019s conduct. The\nvictim testified that defendant would lick her vagina at least once a week when she was 6,\n7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 years of age, from 2003 to 2010. Defendant testified and\ndenied having ever molested the victim and more particularly, denied having ever orally\ncopulated her or sexually penetrated her.\n       The jury was instructed on count 3 as follows:\n       \u201cThe defendant is charged in Count 3 with engaging in oral copulation or sexual\npenetration with a child under 10 years of age or younger, in violation of Penal Code\nsection 288.7[, subdivision] (b). [\u00b6] To prove that the defendant is guilty of this crime,\n\n\n\n2 Defendant did not raise an ex post facto objection in the trial court. People v. Hiscox\n(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 253 (Hiscox) held that the failure to register an ex post facto\nobjection in the trial court does not forfeit the issue on appeal. (Id. at p. 259.)\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fthe People must prove that: [\u00b6] 1. The defendant engaged in an act of oral copulation or\nsexual penetration with [the victim]; [\u00b6] 2. When the defendant did so, [the victim] was\n10 years of age or younger; [\u00b6] 3. At the time of the act, the defendant was at least 18\nyears of age. [\u00b6] Oral copulation is any contact, no matter how slight, between the\nmouth of one person and the sexual organ or anus of another person. Penetration is not\nrequired. [\u00b6] Sexual penetration means penetration, however slight, of the genital or anal\nopening of the other person by any foreign object, substance, instrument, device, or any\nunknown object for the purpose of sexual abuse, arousal, or gratification. [\u00b6] A foreign\nobject, substance, instrument, or device includes any part of the body except a sexual\norgan.\u201d\n       On count 3, the jury was instructed on unanimity:\n       \u201cThe defendant is charged with sex crime with a child 10 years or younger, Penal\nCode [section] 288.7[, subdivision] (b) in Count 3 sometime during the period of\nSeptember 21, 2006 to January 21, 2008. The [P]eople have presented evidence of more\nthan one act to prove that the defendant committed this offense. You must not find the\ndefendant guilty unless you all agree that the People have proved that the defendant\ncommitted at least one of these acts and you all agree on which act he committed.\u201d\n       In opening argument, the prosecutor discussed the frequency of defendant\u2019s abuse.\nWith respect to count 3, the prosecutor argued that the statute went into effective on\nSeptember 20, 2006, that defendant licked the victim\u2019s vagina weekly between\nSeptember 21, 2006, and January 21, 2008, and that to prove the offense, \u201c[w]e just need\none time this happened\u201d between those dates. In rebuttal, the prosecutor referred to the\nvictim\u2019s age as between nine and 10 years of age.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n       Defendant argues the evidence does not establish a \u201cspecific date\u201d on which the\noral copulation occurred and the evidence which was presented showed that the offense\noccurred both before and after the effective date. He further argues the jury was not\n\n                                             3\n\fasked to find that the offense occurred after the effective date and may have found he\ncommitted the offense before or after the effective date of section 288.7. Relying upon\nthe oral pronouncement of the verdict, defendant argues that the jury\u2019s verdict on count 3\nwas consistent with a finding that the offense was committed prior to the effective date.3\nWe reject defendant\u2019s arguments and conclude that the jury was asked to find and the\nevidence supports its verdict that the offense occurred after the effective date.\n       \u201c \u2018[A]ny statute which punishes as a crime an act previously committed, which\nwas innocent when done; which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime,\nafter its commission, or which deprives one charged with crime of any defense available\naccording to law at the time when the act was committed, is prohibited as ex post\nfacto.\u2019 \u201d (Collins v. Youngblood (1990) 497 U.S. 37, 42 [111 L.Ed.2d 30, 39], italics\nomitted.)\n       In Hiscox, supra, 136 Cal.App.4th 253, the defendant was convicted of 11 counts\nof lewd acts upon a child sometime between 1992 and 1996. The court sentenced the\ndefendant to 11 consecutive terms of 15 years to life under section 667.61, which did not\ngo into effect until November 30, 1994. (Hiscox, at pp. 256-257.) Since the record did\nnot reflect beyond a reasonable doubt that the offenses occurred after November 30,\n\n\n\n\n3 In its written verdict, the jury convicted defendant on count 3, which was described as\na \u201csex crime with a child ten (10) years or younger, victim . . . , DOB: 1.22.97, oral sex\nwhile victim was nine (9) - ten (10) years old, a felony, as charged and set forth in Count\nThree (3) of the Information on file herein.\u201d When the jury\u2019s verdict was read in open\ncourt, the clerk misread it to include the word \u201cunder\u201d -- \u201csex crime of a child under 10\nyears or younger, . . . oral sex while the victim was 9- to 10-years-old . . . .\u201d (Italics\nadded.) The jury was polled on all counts and asked whether it was his or her verdict\n(\u201cCount 1, the jury\u2019s verdict is guilty. [\u00b6] Juror Number 1, is this your verdict?\u201d) and so\non. The jurors confirmed their verdicts.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f1994, Hiscox concluded the sentence violated ex post facto principles and remanded for\nresentencing under prior law. (Id. at pp. 259, 261-262.)\n       In Hiscox, \u201cneither the prosecution, the defense, nor the court realized that the\neffective date of section 667.61 presented a problem of proof regarding when the charged\noffenses were committed. The prosecutor did not ask the victims to identify when they\nwere molested with any specificity. The evidence did not reliably connect the various\ncharges to any time frame other than the period between 1992 and 1996. The court did\nnot instruct the jury that its findings under section 667.61 were restricted to offenses\ncommitted on or after November 30, 1994, and defense counsel raised no ex post facto\nobjection.\u201d (Hiscox, supra, 136 Cal.App.4th at p. 258.)\n       Where the prosecution relies upon generic evidence to prove multiple acts of\nmolestation, Hiscox stated that the prosecutor \u201cmust establish a time frame for the\noffenses sufficient to bring them within the scope of any statutory or constitutional\nlimitation on punishment.\u201d (Hiscox, supra, 136 Cal.App.4th at p. 260.) But if \u201cthe\nevidence leaves no reasonable doubt that the underlying charges pertained to events\noccurring on or after\u201d the effective date, the verdict will be upheld. (Id. at p. 261.)\n       Based on the charging document, the prosecutor\u2019s argument, and the unanimity\ninstruction, the parties and court were aware of the effective date of section 288.7. The\njury was asked to decide whether the offense occurred after the effective date of\nsection 288.7 in that it had to be unanimous. Thus, the evidence reflects that defendant\nengaged in the conduct alleged in count 3 countless times from September 21, 2006,\nthrough January 21, 2008. The jury convicted defendant on all counts. The jury\ndetermined the victim was credible and defendant was not. The evidence leaves no\nreasonable doubt that defendant violated section 288.7 on or after the effective date.\n       In support of his argument that the jury was not required to find that the offense\nwas committed on or after September 20, 2006, the effective date of section 288.7,\ndefendant relies on CALCRIM No. 207 given to the jury: \u201cIt is alleged that the crime\n\n                                              5\n\foccurred on or about, as to Count 1, in June 2010; as to Count 2, April 1, 2008 through\nJanuary 21, 2011; as to Count 3, September 21, 2006 through January 21, 2008. The\nPeople are not required to prove that the crime took place exactly on that day, but only\nthat it happened reasonably close to that day.\u201d (Italics added.)\n       We reject defendant\u2019s reliance upon the \u201creasonably close\u201d language of\nCALCRIM No. 207 in support of his argument that it cannot be determined whether the\njury relied on an act committed before or after the effective date of section 288.7. The\ninstructions are read as a whole and language in a particular instruction is not read in\nisolation as defendant has done in support of his argument. \u201cIn reviewing claims of\ninstructional error, we look to whether the defendant has shown a reasonable likelihood\nthat the jury, considering the instruction complained of in the context of the instructions\nas a whole and not in isolation, understood that instruction in a manner that violated his\nconstitutional rights. [Citations.] We interpret the instructions so as to support the\njudgment if they are reasonably susceptible to such interpretation, and we presume jurors\ncan understand and correlate all instructions given.\u201d (People v. Vang (2009)\n171 Cal.App.4th 1120, 1129.)\n       As reasonably read, the unanimity instruction told the jury that it had to determine\nwhether the prosecution proved that defendant violated section 288.7 \u201csometime during\nthe period of September 21, 2006 to January 21, 2008.\u201d There is no reasonable\nlikelihood that the jury ignored this instruction and found defendant committed the act\nbefore the period alleged, relying on the \u201creasonably close\u201d language. Defendant has\nfailed to demonstrate an ex post facto violation.\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f                                    DISPOSITION\n     The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                        BLEASE    , Acting P.
