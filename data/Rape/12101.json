No. CIV-95-1165-M)\n\n\nSubmitted on the briefs:\n\nPatrick M. Ryan, United States Attorney, Steven K.

Reischel, Deputy Corporation Counsel, Mary L. Wilson, Assistant Corporation\nCounsel, Washington, D.C., for Amicus Curiae.\n\n\nBefore KELLY, BARRETT, and HENRY, Circuit Judges.\n\n\nKELLY, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n       Petitioner-appellee James F. Johnson is an inmate in federal custody serving an\n\naggregate U.S. Code and District of Columbia (D.C.) Code sentence. In district court,\n\nJohnson filed a habeas petition, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, arguing that he was entitled to\n\ncredit under his D.C. sentence for \u201cstreet time\u201d accrued prior to revocation of his parole. The\n\ndistrict court agreed and granted the requested relief. On appeal by respondents-appellants\n\nThomas Kindt and the U.S. Parole Commission (the Commission), we reverse the judgment\n\nof the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.1\n\n\n                                      BACKGROUND\n\n       Johnson was convicted of the D.C. crimes of rape and carrying a pistol without a\n\nlicense and also the federal crime of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. In 1985,\n\nthe United States Bureau of Prisons calculated his aggregated sentence at approximately\n\n        1\n              After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. See\nFed. R. App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1.9. The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral\nargument.\n\n                                              -2-\n\ftwenty-five years (thirteen years under the D.C. Code and twelve years under the U.S. Code).\n\nOn February 4, 1989, the Commission released Johnson on parole with approximately twenty-\n\none years left to be served.2\n\n        On August 24, 1994, the Commission issued an arrest warrant for a parole violation\n\n(commission of new criminal conduct).           As of that date, Johnson had accumulated\n\napproximately five and one-half years of street time,3 allocated proportionately to the federal\n\nand D.C. crimes as 910 days to the U.S. Code sentence and 1092 days to the D.C. Code\n\nsentence. The Commission revoked Johnson\u2019s parole and ordered the forfeiture of his street\n\ntime.\n\n        Johnson filed a habeas petition, arguing that, under D.C. Code \u00a7 24-431(a), a provision\n\neffective April 11, 1987, he should have retained credit for the 1092\n\n\n\n\n        2\n              The Commission, which has statutory authority to make parole decisions for D.C.\noffenders housed in federal prisons, is required to follow D.C. law with regard to D.C. offenses.\nSee Johnson v. Williford, 821 F.2d 1279, 1288 (7th Cir. 1987); see also D.C. Code \u00a7 24-209.\n        3\n                \u201c\u2018Street time\u2019 is measured from the date of release on parole to the execution of\nthe [arrest] warrant or confinement on other charges.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.66(i).\n\n                                                -3-\n\fdays of street time attributable to his D.C. sentence.4 The Commission, however, asserted that\n\na previous, and conflicting, D.C. Code provision required the forfeiture of D.C. street time\n\nupon the revocation of parole. See D.C. Code \u00a7 24-206(a) (providing that, after revocation\n\nof parole, \u201c[t]he time a prisoner was on parole shall not be taken into account to diminish the\n\ntime for which he was sentenced\u201d). The district court, relying on the case of Noble v. United\n\nStates Parole Commission, 887 F. Supp. 11, 13-14 (D.D.C. 1995) (Noble I), concluded that\n\nthe Commission had reached an erroneous interpretation of D.C. law. Determining that D.C.\n\nCode \u00a7 24-431(a) applied to Johnson\u2019s street time because it was earned after the effective\n\ndate of the provision, the district court granted the habeas petition and ordered the\n\nCommission to credit Johnson with the street time allocated to his D.C. sentence.\n\n       The Commission appealed the district court\u2019s ruling to this court. While the appeal\n\nwas pending, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia resolved the statutory\n\ninterpretation issue by answering a question certified by the United States Court of Appeals\n\nfor the District of Columbia in the Noble case.5 It determined that D.C. Code \u00a7 24-431(a)\n\n        4\n               D.C. Code \u00a7 24-431(a) provides:\n\n               Every person shall be given credit on the maximum and the minimum term\n        of imprisonment for time spent in custody or on parole as a result of the offense\n        for which the sentence was imposed. When entering the final order in any case,\n        the court shall provide that the person be given credit for the time spent in custody\n        or on parole as a result of the offense for which sentence was imposed.\n        5\n               The certified question was:\n\n        Under District of Columbia law . . ., did the United States Parole Commission\n        properly interpret sections 24-206(a) and 24-431(a) of the District of Columbia\n                                                                                     (continued...)\n\n                                                -4-\n\fdoes not effect an implied repeal of D.C. Code \u00a7 24-206(a), so that once parole is revoked,\n\nD.C. law does not entitle an offender to street-time credit. See United States Parole Comm\u2019n\n\nv. Noble, 693 A.2d 1084, 1085, 1105 (D.C. 1997) (Noble III) (withdrawn, then\n\nreinstated after en banc rehearing, see United States Parole Comm\u2019n v. Noble, 711 A.2d 85,\n\n86 (D.C. 1998)).\n\n       On appeal, Johnson concedes that this court is bound by the Noble III holding, see\n\nJohnson v. Fankell, 117 S. Ct. 1800, 1804 (1997), but argues that retroactive application\n\nwould offend due process.\n\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n       Generally, \u201c[a] judicial construction of a statute is an authoritative statement of what\n\nthe statute meant before as well as after the decision of the case giving rise to that\n\nconstruction.\u201d Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U.S. 298, 312-13 (1994). However, the\n\nSupreme Court has held that\n\n       an unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute, applied\n       retroactively, operates precisely like an ex post facto law, such as Art. I, \u00a7 10\n       of the Constitution forbids . . . . If a state legislature is barred by the Ex Post\n       Facto Clause from passing such a law, it must follow that a State Supreme\n       Court is barred by the Due Process Clause from achieving precisely the same\n       result by judicial construction.\n\n\n\n       (...continued)\n       5\n\n       Code in deciding that, after revocation of a person\u2019s parole, time that the person\n       spent on parole before revocation cannot be credited against his sentence?\n\nNoble v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, 82 F.3d 1108, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (Noble II).\n\n                                               -5-\n\fBouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 353-54 (1964). The construction of a criminal\n\nstatute may not \u201cdeprive the defendant of the fair warning to which the Constitution entitles\n\nhim.\u201d Id. at 354. The Bouie principles apply to \u201cafter-the-fact increases in the degree of\n\npunishment\u201d as well as \u201cthe ex post facto construction of substantive criminal statutes.\u201d\n\nHelton v. Fauver, 930 F.2d 1040, 1045 (3d Cir. 1991) (citing Devine v. New Mexico Dep\u2019t\n\nof Corrections, 866 F.2d 339, 344 (10th Cir. 1989)).\n\n       The test for determining whether the retroactive application of a judicial decision\n\nviolates due process is essentially one of foreseeability. See McDonald v. Champion, 962\n\nF.2d 1455, 1458 (10th Cir. 1992). The issue is a \u201cquestion[] of constitutional law reviewable\n\nunder a plenary standard.\u201d Helton, 930 F.2d at 1044; see also Mahn v. Gunter, 978 F.2d 599,\n\n601 (10th Cir. 1992).6\n\n       A judicial construction of a statute is unforeseeable if it is \u201cunexpected\n\nand indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct at\n\nissue.\u201d Bouie, 378 U.S. at 354. Unforeseeable judicial decisions include expansion of a\n\nstatute narrow and precise on its face beyond those terms, McDonald, 962 F.2d at 1458; the\n\noverruling of precedent, Devine, 866 F.2d at 345; or when \u201can in-depth inquiry by a dedicated\n\nand educated student of [the relevant] law would have revealed nothing to foreshadow the\n\n[controlling court] opinion,\u201d id.\n\n\n        6\n                We note that the D.C. Court of Appeals has expressed no view on \u201cwhether there\nshould be any limitation on the class of prisoners the ruling should reach; i.e., the issue of\nretroactivity/prospectivity.\u201d Noble III, 693 A.2d at 1104.\n\n                                             -6-\n\f       The case of Tyler v. United States, 929 F.2d 451, 457 (9th Cir. 1991), provides a\n\nfactual and legal framework for considering the foreseeability of the Noble III holding.\n\nAccording to Tyler, soon after \u00a7 24-431(a) was enacted, concerned parties recognized the\n\ninconsistency between \u00a7 24-431(a) and \u00a7 24-206(a). See id. at 455. Without \u201canalysis of\n\nwhether [the] inconsistency [was] irreconcilable,\u201d mention of the disfavored status of implied\n\nrepeals, or acknowledgment of the congressional oversight of D.C. criminal legislation, the\n\nD.C. Corporation Counsel advised the D.C. Department of Corrections that the newer\n\nprovision impliedly repealed the older, so that parole violators had the right to retain street\n\ntime. Id. Subsequently, \u201cthe D.C. Department of Corrections adopted a rule requiring\n\nretention of street time after a parole revocation.\u201d Id.\n\n       Federal prison officials, however, reached a different conclusion. The Commission\n\ndetermined that \u00a7 24-206(a), the street time forfeiture statute, was still valid, and continued\n\nto apply it. See id. at 455-57.\n\n       After weighing the merits of the divergent positions taken by the D.C. government and\n\nthe Commission, the Tyler court concluded that \u00a7 24-431(a) \u201cdid not impliedly repeal the\n\nlongstanding requirement of section 24-206 that parole violators forfeit their street time.\u201d Id.\n\nat 457. Until the decision in Noble III was announced, Tyler was the only appellate decision\n\nthat directly addressed the issue. See Noble III, 693 A.2d at 1104. The D.C. Court of Appeals\n\nhad \u201csent mixed signals\u201d on the subject. Noble v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, 82 F.3d\n\n1108, 1111-12 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (Noble II) (noting that, in Luck v. District of Columbia, 617\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\fA.2d 509 (D.C. 1992) the court had assumed in dicta that \u00a7 24-431(a) permitted street-time\n\ncredit after the Act\u2019s effective date).\n\n          In 1994, when Johnson violated his parole, it was foreseeable that the Commission\u2019s\n\nview would ultimately prevail. The Noble III decision did not expand a narrow and precise\n\nlegislative provision or overrule controlling precedent. Moreover, elementary legal research\n\nwould have revealed the principle that repeals by implication are disfavored. See, e.g.,\n\nCrawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U.S. 437, 442 (1987); Noble II, 82 F.3d at\n\n1112. Accordingly, applying the Noble III holding to Johnson\u2019s petition does not offend due\n\nprocess.\n\n          The judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma\n\nis REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions to deny Johnson\u2019s request for habeas\n\nrelief.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\f                                                                                        F I L E D\n                                                                                United States Court of Appeals\n                                                                                        Tenth Circuit\n                         UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                                                                                         JUL 17 1998\n                                FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n                                                                                   PATRICK FISHER\n                                                                                              Clerk\n\n JAMES F.

Johnson is an inmate in federal custody serving an\n\naggregate U.S. Code and District of Columbia (D.C.) Code sentence. In district court,\n\nJohnson filed a habeas petition, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, arguing that he was entitled\n\nto credit under his D.C. sentence for \u201cstreet time\u201d accrued prior to revocation of his parole.\n\nThe district court agreed and granted the requested relief. On appeal by respondents-\n\nappellants Thomas Kindt and the U.S. Parole Commission (the Commission), we reverse the\n\njudgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this order\n\nand judgment.\n\n\n                                       BACKGROUND\n\n       Johnson was convicted of the D.C. crimes of rape and carrying a pistol without a\n\nlicense and also the federal crime of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. In 1985,\n\nthe United States Bureau of Prisons calculated his aggregated sentence at approximately\n\ntwenty-five years (thirteen years under the D.C. Code and twelve years under the U.S. Code).\n\nOn February 4, 1989, the Commission released Johnson on parole with approximately twenty-\n\none years left to be served.1\n\n\n\n\n       1\n              The Commission, which has statutory authority to make parole decisions for D.C.\noffenders housed in federal prisons, is required to follow D.C. law with regard to D.C. offenses.\nSee Johnson v. Williford, 821 F.2d 1279, 1288 (7th Cir. 1987); see also D.C. Code \u00a7 24-209.\n\n                                               -2-\n\f        On August 24, 1994, the Commission issued an arrest warrant for a parole violation\n\n(commission of new criminal conduct).             As of that date, Johnson had accumulated\n\napproximately five and one-half years of street time,2 allocated proportionately to the federal\n\nand D.C. crimes as 910 days to the U.S. Code sentence and 1092 days to the D.C. Code\n\nsentence. The Commission revoked Johnson\u2019s parole and ordered the forfeiture of his street\n\ntime.\n\n        Johnson filed a habeas petition, arguing that, under D.C. Code \u00a7 24-431(a), a provision\n\neffective April 11, 1987, he should have retained credit for the 1092 days of street time\n\nattributable to his D.C. sentence.3 The Commission, however, asserted that a previous, and\n\nconflicting, D.C. Code provision required the forfeiture of D.C. street time upon the\n\nrevocation of parole. See D.C. Code \u00a7 24-206(a) (providing that, after revocation of parole,\n\n\u201c[t]he time a prisoner was on parole shall not be taken into account to diminish the time for\n\nwhich he was sentenced\u201d). The district court, relying on the case of Noble v. United States\n\nParole Commission , 887 F. Supp. 11, 13-14 (D.D.C. 1995) ( Noble I), concluded that the\n\nCommission had reached an erroneous interpretation of D.C. law. Determining that D.C.\n\n\n        2\n                \u201c\u2018Street time\u2019 is measured from the date of release on parole to the execution of\nthe [arrest] warrant or confinement on other charges.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.66(i).\n        3\n               D.C. Code \u00a7 24-431(a) provides:\n\n               Every person shall be given credit on the maximum and the minimum term\n        of imprisonment for time spent in custody or on parole as a result of the offense\n        for which the sentence was imposed. When entering the final order in any case,\n        the court shall provide that the person be given credit for the time spent in custody\n        or on parole as a result of the offense for which sentence was imposed.\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fCode \u00a7 24-431(a) applied to Johnson\u2019s street time because it was earned after the effective\n\ndate of the provision, the district court granted the habeas petition and ordered the\n\nCommission to credit Johnson with the street time allocated to his D.C. sentence.\n\n       The Commission appealed the district court\u2019s ruling to this court. While the appeal\n\nwas pending, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia resolved the statutory\n\ninterpretation issue by answering a question certified by the United States Court of Appeals\n\nfor the District of Columbia in the Noble case.4 It determined that D.C. Code \u00a7 24-431(a)\n\ndoes not effect an implied repeal of D.C. Code \u00a7 24-206(a), so that once parole is revoked,\n\nD.C. law does not entitle an offender to street-time credit. See United States Parole Comm\u2019n\n\nv. Noble, 693 A.2d 1084, 1085, 1105 (D.C. 1997) (Noble III) (withdrawn, then\n\nreinstated after en banc rehearing, see United States Parole Comm\u2019n v. Noble, No. 96-SP-578,\n\n1998 WL 208865 (D.C. Apr. 23, 1998)).\n\n       On appeal, Johnson concedes that this court is bound by the Noble III holding, see\n\nJohnson v. Fankell, 117 S. Ct. 1800, 1804 (1997), but argues that retroactive application\n\nwould offend due process.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n              The certified question was:\n\n       Under District of Columbia law . . ., did the United States Parole Commission\n       properly interpret sections 24-206(a) and 24-431(a) of the District of Columbia\n       Code in deciding that, after revocation of a person\u2019s parole, time that the person\n       spent on parole before revocation cannot be credited against his sentence?\n\nNoble v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, 82 F.3d 1108, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (Noble II).\n\n                                                -4-\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\n\n       Generally, \u201c[a] judicial construction of a statute is an authoritative statement of what\n\nthe statute meant before as well as after the decision of the case giving rise to that\n\nconstruction.\u201d Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U.S. 298, 312-13 (1994). However, the\n\nSupreme Court has held that\n\n       an unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute, applied\n       retroactively, operates precisely like an ex post facto law, such as Art. I, \u00a7 10\n       of the Constitution forbids . . . . If a state legislature is barred by the Ex Post\n       Facto Clause from passing such a law, it must follow that a State Supreme\n       Court is barred by the Due Process Clause from achieving precisely the same\n       result by judicial construction.\n\nBouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 353-54 (1964). The construction of a criminal\n\nstatute may not \u201cdeprive the defendant of the fair warning to which the Constitution entitles\n\nhim.\u201d Id. at 354. The Bouie principles apply to \u201cafter-the-fact increases in the degree of\n\npunishment\u201d as well as \u201cthe ex post facto construction of substantive criminal statutes.\u201d\n\nHelton v. Fauver, 930 F.2d 1040, 1045 (3d Cir. 1991) (citing Devine v. New Mexico Dep\u2019t\n\nof Corrections, 866 F.2d 339, 344 (10th Cir. 1989)).\n\n       The test for determining whether the retroactive application of a judicial decision\n\nviolates due process is essentially one of foreseeability. See McDonald v. Champion , 962\n\nF.2d 1455, 1458 (10th Cir. 1992). The issue is a \u201cquestion[] of constitutional law reviewable\n\n\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\funder a plenary standard.\u201d Helton, 930 F.2d at 1044; see also Mahn v. Gunter, 978 F.2d 599,\n\n601 (10th Cir. 1992).5\n\n       A judicial construction of a statute is unforeseeable if it is \u201cunexpected and\n\nindefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct at issue.\u201d\n\nBouie, 378 U.S. at 354. Unforeseeable judicial decisions include expansion of a statute\n\nnarrow and precise on its face beyond those terms,        McDonald, 962 F.2d at 1458; the\n\noverruling of precedent, Devine, 866 F.2d at 345; or when \u201can in-depth inquiry by a dedicated\n\nand educated student of [the relevant] law would have revealed nothing to foreshadow the\n\n[controlling court] opinion,\u201d id.\n\n       The case of Tyler v. United States, 929 F.2d 451, 457 (9th Cir. 1991), provides a\n\nfactual and legal framework for considering the foreseeability of the Noble III holding.\n\nAccording to Tyler, soon after \u00a7 24-431(a) was enacted, concerned parties recognized the\n\ninconsistency between \u00a7 24-431(a) and \u00a7 24-206(a). See id. at 455. Without \u201canalysis of\n\nwhether [the] inconsistency [was] irreconcilable,\u201d mention of the disfavored status of implied\n\nrepeals, or acknowledgment of the congressional oversight of D.C. criminal legislation, the\n\nD.C. Corporation Counsel advised the D.C. Department of Corrections that the newer\n\nprovision impliedly repealed the older, so that parole violators had the right to retain street\n\n\n\n\n       5\n                We note that the D.C. Court of Appeals has expressed no view on \u201cwhether there\nshould be any limitation on the class of prisoners the ruling should reach; i.e., the issue of\nretroactivity/prospectivity.\u201d Noble III, 693 A.2d at 1104.\n\n                                              -6-\n\ftime. Id. Subsequently, \u201cthe D.C. Department of Corrections adopted a rule requiring\n\nretention of street time after a parole revocation.\u201d Id.\n\n       Federal prison officials, however, reached a different conclusion. The Commission\n\ndetermined that \u00a7 24-206(a), the street time forfeiture statute, was still valid, and continued\n\nto apply it. See id. at 455-57.\n\n       After weighing the merits of the divergent positions taken by the D.C. government and\n\nthe Commission, the Tyler court concluded that \u00a7 24-431(a) \u201cdid not impliedly repeal the\n\nlongstanding requirement of section 24-206 that parole violators forfeit their street time.\u201d Id.\n\nat 457. Until the decision inNoble III was announced, Tyler was the only appellate decision\n\nthat directly addressed the issue. See Noble III, 693 A.2d at 1104. The D.C. Court of Appeals\n\nhad \u201csent mixed signals\u201d on the subject. Noble v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, 82 F.3d\n\n1108, 1111-12 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (Noble II) (noting that, in Luck v. District of Columbia, 617\n\nA.2d 509 (D.C. 1992) the court had assumed in dicta that \u00a7 24-431(a) permitted street-time\n\ncredit after the Act\u2019s effective date).\n\n       In 1994, when Johnson violated his parole, it was foreseeable that the Commission\u2019s\n\nview would ultimately prevail. The Noble III decision did not expand a narrow and precise\n\nlegislative provision or overrule controlling precedent. Moreover, elementary legal research\n\nwould have revealed the principle that repeals by implication are disfavored.         See, e.g.,\n\nCrawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc. , 482 U.S. 437, 442 (1987); Noble II, 82 F.3d at\n\n\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\f1112. Accordingly, applying theNoble III holding to Johnson\u2019s petition does not offend due\n\nprocess.\n\n          The judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma\n\nis REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions to deny Johnson\u2019s request for habeas\n\nrelief.\n\n\n\n                                                           Entered for the Court\n\n\n\n                                                           Paul J.
