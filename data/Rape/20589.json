BLOMERTH, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                            MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n               A jury convicted appellant Candelario Cerda of two counts of sexual assault of a child\n\nand for each count assessed his punishment at confinement for ten years in the Texas Department\n\nof Criminal Justice and a $5,000 fine. See Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.011(a)(2)(A). The trial court\n\nimposed sentence in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict and ordered the sentences to be served\n\nconsecutively. See id. \u00a7 3.03(b)(2)(A); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 42.08. In five points of error on\n\nappeal, appellant complains about the admission of \u201cbackdoor\u201d hearsay evidence, the exclusion of\n\nimpeachment evidence, the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct a hearing outside the presence of the jury\n\nto determine the admissibility of extraneous-offense evidence, the denial of his right to present a\n\nmeaningful defense, and the insufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. We find no\n\nreversible error. However, through our own review of the record, we have found non-reversible error\n\fin the written judgments of conviction. We will modify the judgments to correct the clerical errors\n\nand, as modified, affirm the judgments.\n\n\n                                          BACKGROUND\n\n               V.R. testified that she knew appellant through church, where he was a worship leader.\n\nWhen she was 15 years old, she exchanged phone numbers with appellant at a church member\u2019s\n\nfuneral. Subsequently, they began texting and talking with each other frequently. In one of their\n\nconversations, appellant asked V.R. if she would have sex with him. She refused because he went\n\nto her church and was 25 years old. Appellant assured her that no one would know. One week after\n\nthe funeral, appellant asked V.R. to meet him at an H.E.B. grocery store near her house. V.R. snuck\n\nout of her house while her parents were asleep and met him as he had asked. Appellant picked V.R.\n\nup in his black pickup truck and told her that they were going to his friend\u2019s house to watch a movie.\n\nInstead, however, he drove her to a vacant lot.\n\n               Appellant parked the truck at the lot and told V.R. to get in the back seat, take off her\n\nclothes, and lie down. As she complied, appellant put sun shades up to cover all the windows, then\n\nmoved to the back seat and removed his clothes. He took a towel from under the seat and placed it\n\non the seat underneath V.R. He then put his fingers inside her vagina. Appellant next directed V.R.\n\nto get on her hands and knees. After she complied, he put his penis inside her vagina. At this point,\n\nV.R. told appellant to stop but he did not. According to V.R.\u2019s testimony, he only stopped when he\n\nnoticed blood coming from her vagina. He gave her paper towels to wipe herself and then told her\n\nto get dressed. Appellant put his clothes back on and got back in the front seat. He told V.R. to stay\n\non the floor of the backseat while he drove her home. He dropped her off at a church near her house.\n\n                                                  2\n\f               However, V.R. was afraid to go home. Instead, she walked around town. At some\n\npoint, she encountered a boy she knew as \u201cJeremiah,\u201d who was a friend of one of her brothers. She\n\nborrowed his phone to call her mother but hung up before her mother answered because she got\n\nscared. V.R. testified that Jeremiah asked her to have sex with him but she said no. The two then\n\nsmoked marijuana together. At some point, V.R. saw a knife sticking out from Jeremiah\u2019s pocket,\n\nbecame scared, and ran off without returning Jeremiah\u2019s phone. Afterwards, as she was walking,\n\nshe saw one of her brothers outside a nearby store. Her brother picked her up and drove her home.\n\nOnce at home, V.R. eventually told her dad that \u201c[appellant] raped [her].\u201d\n\n               F.F. met appellant at church when she was 12 years old. When she was 14, she and\n\nappellant began talking on the phone. Appellant began asking F.F. to sneak out of her home at night,\n\nwhich she did. He would pick her up in his truck. F.F. testified that her relationship with appellant\n\nbecame \u201cphysical\u201d\u2014meaning sexual\u2014when she was 15 years old. She described multiple occasions\n\non which she and appellant engaged in sexual activities; she stated that their sexual relationship\n\nlasted nine or ten months. F.F. also testified about two incidents in which she was with appellant\n\nparked in his truck and they were discovered by police: one at a park where they were \u201cjust talking\u201d\n\n(before their relationship had become sexual) and another at a parking garage at Texas State\n\nUniversity where they were both undressed and about to have sex. F.F. described having sex with\n\nappellant at a Motel 6 in San Marcos, in his truck at multiple locations, and in a storage building at\n\nchurch. Her testimony reflected that on numerous occasions appellant had anal sex, vaginal sex, and\n\noral sex with her. He also penetrated her digitally on repeated occasions, including one time when\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fhe attempted to put his entire fist into her vagina, causing her to bleed. F.F. disclosed appellant\u2019s\n\nconduct with her after V.R. revealed appellant\u2019s sexual assault of her.\n\n                The State charged appellant with two counts of sexual assault of a child, one count\n\nrelating to each girl. A jury found appellant guilt of sexually assaulting both girls and for each count\n\nassessed a ten-year sentence and a $5,000 fine. The trial court sentenced appellant in accordance\n\nwith the jury\u2019s verdicts, ordering the sentences to run consecutively. This appeal followed.\n\n\n                                            DISCUSSION\n\n                                         Backdoor Hearsay\n\n                At trial, Melissa Rodriguez, a forensic interviewer with the children\u2019s advocacy\n\ncenter, testified about the demeanor of V.R. and F.F. during their forensic interviews as well as the\n\nfact that both girls were enrolled in counseling at the advocacy center. Also at trial, V.R.\u2019s father\n\ntestified about what he did after his daughter told him about what had happened. In his first point\n\nof error, appellant complains that the trial court erred by allowing this testimony because it\n\nconstituted inadmissible \u201cbackdoor\u201d hearsay.\n\n                Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at a trial,\n\noffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Tex. R. Evid. 801(d). Hearsay is\n\ngenerally inadmissible except as provided by the rules of evidence or statute. Tex. R. Evid. 802.\n\nThe hearsay prohibition cannot be circumvented by eliciting the substance of the statement in\n\nindirect form. Schaffer v. State, 777 S.W.2d 111, 113 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989). If the content of a\n\nstatement is presented by implication, such \u201cbackdoor hearsay\u201d is subject to the same rules and\n\nlimitations as the more common form of hearsay. Gilbert v. State, 874 S.W.2d 290, 295 (Tex.\n\n                                                   4\n\fApp.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, pet. ref\u2019d) (citing Schaffer, 777 S.W.2d at 113). Whether testimony\n\nviolates the hearsay prohibition necessarily turns on how strongly the content of an out-of-court\n\nstatement can be inferred from the context; the question is whether the strength of the inference\n\nproduces an \u201cinescapable conclusion\u201d that the evidence is being offered to prove the substance of\n\nan out-of-court statement. Head v. State, 4 S.W.3d 258, 261\u201362 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). \u201cAn\n\nanalysis of whether the impermissible inference is so overriding as to fall within the hearsay\n\nprohibition will necessarily turn on the specific factual circumstances of a given case.\u201d Id.\n\nat 262 n.4.\n\n               Appellant argues that the complained-of testimony contained strong inferences about\n\nthe truthfulness of the outcry statements of the girls and thus was \u201cbackdoor\u201d hearsay. However,\n\nhearsay by inference, or backdoor hearsay, violates the prohibition against hearsay because it\n\npresents the content or substance, indirectly, of the out-of-court statement. Here, the complained-of\n\ntestimony did not convey the content of the girls\u2019 out-of-court statements, even by implication.\n\nRodriguez did not give any specifics about the girls\u2019 comments during the forensic interviews; she\n\nsimply described her observations of the girls during their interviews.1 These personal observations\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          We note that the prosecutor asked Rodriguez, \u201cCan you describe [F.F.]\u2019s demeanor during\nthis interview?\u201d She responded, \u201cYes,\u201d and then proceeded to describe F.F.\u2019s demeanor. Only after\nshe completed her answer did appellant object. Because appellant waited until the question calling\nfor the purportedly objectionable response had been asked and answered before he objected, his\nobjection was untimely and his complaint about the admission of Rodriguez\u2019s testimony about F.F.\u2019s\ndemeanor has not been preserved for appellate review. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1); see also Pena\nv. State, 353 S.W.3d 797, 807 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011) (objection is timely if made at earliest\nopportunity or as soon as grounds for objection become apparent); Saldano v. State, 70 S.W.3d 873,\n889 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (\u201c[T]he failure to object in a timely and specific manner during trial\nforfeits complaints about the admissibility of evidence.\u201d).\n\n                                                 5\n\fconveyed her perception of how the girls felt emotionally during the interview; they did not convey\n\nthe contents of any statements made during the interview. The fact that V.R. \u201cseemed nervous\u201d or\n\nthat F.F. \u201cwas pretty upset\u201d in no way conveyed their descriptions of the acts of sexual abuse\n\nappellant perpetrated against them. Nor does the fact that the girls were in counseling convey the\n\ncontent of any out-of-court statement describing sexual abuse.\n\n               Similarly, V.R.\u2019s father did not convey any specifics about what his daughter told\n\nhim.2 Rather, his testimony merely described the actions he took after talking to her. The\n\nprohibition against backdoor hearsay does not prohibit a witness from testifying about actions he\n\ntook in response to an out-of-court statement, but only from detailing the contents of the statement\n\nwhen doing so. See, e.g., Schaffer, 777 S.W.2d at 114\u201315 (holding it was permissible for police\n\nofficer to testify that officer was acting in response to \u201cinformation received,\u201d but officer was not\n\npermitted to relate historical aspects of case, which were replete with hearsay statements); see also\n\nDunbar v. State, No. 03-12-00315-CR, 2014 WL 2741237, at *5 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin June 13, 2014,\n\nno. pet. h.) (mem. op., not designated for publication) (\u201cWitnesses are generally allowed to explain\n\nthat an out-of-court statement caused the witness to take a particular action so long as the testimony\n\ndoes not strongly imply the content of the out-of-court statement.\u201d).\n\n               The test for backdoor hearsay is whether the \u201c\u2018State\u2019s sole intent in pursuing [a] line\n\nof questioning was to convey to the jury\u2019 the contents of out-of-court statements.\u201d Head, 4 S.W.3d\n\n\n       2\n          V.R.\u2019s father answered affirmatively when the prosecutor asked, \u201cOkay. Did, at some\npoint, [V.R.] open up to you about what had happened?\u201d Appellant neither objected to this question\nnor the answer. Appellant objected to the next question about whether V.R. \u201c[made] an outcry to\n[him],\u201d which the trial court sustained. The prosecutor then asked V.R.\u2019s father, \u201cWhat did you\ndo next?\u201d\n\n                                                  6\n\fat 262 (quoting Schaffer, 777 S.W.2d at 114). Because the content of the girls\u2019 out-of-court\n\nstatements were not impliedly presented in the testimony of the forensic interviewer or V.R.\u2019s father,\n\nwe are unable to conclude from the record that the State\u2019s sole intent in offering the complained-of\n\ntestimony was to convey the content or substance of any of the girls\u2019 out-of-court statements. See\n\nid. (concluding that trial court could have reasonably determined that State\u2019s intent in questioning\n\nwitness was not solely to convey out-of-court statement). Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in allowing the complained-of testimony. See Gurka v. State, 82 S.W.3d 416, 421\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2002, pet. ref\u2019d) (trial court\u2019s decision to admit testimony objected to on basis\n\nof backdoor hearsay is subject to abuse-of-discretion standard); Head, 4 S.W.3d at 262 n.4 (review\n\nof trial court\u2019s decision to allow disputed testimony is tempered by general rule that trial judge\u2019s\n\nevidentiary ruling on hearsay objection will be upheld absent abuse of discretion). We overrule\n\nappellant\u2019s first point of error.\n\n\n                                     Impeachment Evidence\n\n                As evidence of the previous and subsequent relationship between appellant and F.F.,\n\nsee Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 38.37(b)(2), the State offered evidence of an incident when appellant\n\nand F.F. were discovered by police parked in appellant\u2019s truck in a university garage on the Texas\n\nState University campus. Upon discovery, appellant attempted to flee the scene in his truck but was\n\napprehended and arrested for evading detention.\n\n                Jesus Balderama, a senior patrol officer with the Texas State University campus\n\npolice, testified about the encounter with appellant. He stated that he discovered appellant\u2019s truck\n\nin one of the university\u2019s parking garages at approximately 1:30 a.m. with the engine running and\n\n                                                  7\n\fsun shades covering all the windows. The officer described his failed attempts to make contact with\n\nthe occupants of the truck and the ensuing chase when appellant drove off. He testified that as he\n\nwas pursuing appellant\u2019s truck, he noticed someone running from the truck and advised his\n\ndispatcher of the situation. He explained that he did not actually see the person jump out of the truck\n\nbut did notice someone running from it.3\n\n               During cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel questioned Officer Balderama about\n\nthe fleeing figure. He asked the officer to describe \u201cthe image that you say you saw exit the car and\n\nfor how long you saw that image.\u201d The officer responded that he \u201csaw that image for a brief\n\n30 seconds, if that.\u201d Counsel later asked the officer how long the fleeing figure was on the dash-cam\n\nvideo from his patrol car. Officer Balderama responded, \u201cLike I said, give or take a couple of\n\nseconds, 20, 30 seconds.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel persisted, asking, \u201cA couple of seconds or 20, 30?\u201d\n\nThe officer repeated the time frame of \u201c30, 20, 30 seconds.\u201d Counsel then announced his desire \u201cto\n\nimpeach this witness by letting him see his video.\u201d At the ensuing bench conference, appellant\u2019s\n\ncounsel indicated that he wanted the officer to refresh his recollection with the video \u201cor else [he\n\nwas] going to impeach him with it, one or the other.\u201d Counsel asserted that \u201cthe figure, whoever it\n\nwas, wasn\u2019t visible on his dash cam for more than three seconds, flat.\u201d4 The trial court declined to\n\nallow appellant\u2019s counsel to impeach the officer in this manner.\n\n       3\n         Subsequent testimony from F.F. revealed that she was the person who fled from appellant\u2019s\ntruck that night. Her testimony also established that she and appellant were undressed and about to\nengage in sexual activity in the truck when discovered by the police.\n       4\n         In his brief, appellant asserts that the figure appeared on the dash-cam video for \u201c3-5\nseconds of obscured view.\u201d Appellant failed to offer the video into evidence, so it is not part of the\nappellate record and is unavailable for review.\n\n\n                                                  8\n\f                In his second point of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by not allowing\n\nhis counsel to impeach Officer Balderama by showing the dash-cam video of appellant\u2019s evading-\n\ndetention arrest. He contends that he was entitled to impeach the general credibility of the officer\n\nby use of such evidence. We disagree.\n\n                As a general rule, a party is not entitled to impeach a witness on a collateral or\n\nimmaterial matter. Ramirez v. State, 802 S.W.2d 674, 675 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990); Poole v. State,\n\n974 S.W.2d 892, 905 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 1998, pet. ref\u2019d). A collateral matter is one which seeks\n\nonly to test a witness\u2019s general credibility or relates to facts irrelevant to issues at trial. Keller\n\nv. State, 662 S.W.2d 362, 365 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984); Delamora v. State, 128 S.W.3d 344, 363\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2004, pet. ref\u2019d). \u201cThe test as to whether a matter is collateral is whether the\n\ncross-examining party would be entitled to prove it as a part of his case tending to establish his plea.\u201d\n\nRamirez, 802 S.W.2d at 675 (quoting Bates v. State, 587 S.W.2d 121, 133 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979));\n\nsee Hayden v. State, 296 S.W.3d 549, 554 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). Here, the evidence sought to be\n\nintroduced by appellant bears no relationship to any contested issue in the sexual-assault trial. How\n\nlong the fleeing figure was shown on the dash-cam video was not evidence that appellant could have\n\nrelied on in his case-in-chief to show that he had not sexually assaulted F.F. Thus, whether Officer\n\nBalderama was accurate as to the precise amount of time that the fleeing figure appeared on the\n\ndash-cam video was a collateral matter.\n\n                Furthermore, a party may not cross-examine a witness on a collateral matter and\n\nthen contradict the witness\u2019s answer. Delamora, 128 S.W.3d at 363; see Shipman v. State,\n\n604 S.W.2d 182, 184\u201385 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980). By repeatedly asking Officer Balderama how\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\flong the fleeing figure appeared on the dash-cam video, appellant\u2019s counsel elicited a response from\n\nthe officer for the sole purpose of introducing extraneous evidence to contradict the officer\u2019s\n\nresponse and place the officer\u2019s own character into issue. Such questioning was improper. See\n\nHammett v. State, 713 S.W.2d 102, 105 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986) (party may not \u201cbootstrap\u201d its way\n\nto impeachment by eliciting offending statement on cross-examination).\n\n               As a collateral matter\u2014not relating to appellant\u2019s claim that he was not guilty of\n\nsexually assaulting F.F. but merely serving to contradict Officer Balderama on facts irrelevant to\n\nissues at trial\u2014the amount of time the fleeing figure appeared on video was inadmissible\n\nimpeachment evidence. As such, the trial court did not err by refusing to allow appellant to impeach\n\nOfficer Balderama with the dash-cam video. We overrule appellant\u2019s second point of error.\n\n\n                                  Extraneous-Offense Evidence\n\n               During the State\u2019s rebuttal case, Todd Harrison, a patrol officer with the San Marcos\n\nPolice Department, testified about an incident in which he encountered appellant and 14-year-old\n\nF.F. parked in appellant\u2019s truck in one of the city parks after hours, at around 2:30 in the morning.\n\nIn his third point of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in allowing this testimony\n\nwithout first conducting a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine its admissibility.\n\n               Preservation of error is a systemic requirement on appeal. Blackshear v. State,\n\n385 S.W.3d 589, 590 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012) (citing Ford v. State, 305 S.W.3d 530, 532 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2009)). A reviewing court should not address the merits of an issue that has not been preserved\n\nfor appeal. Wilson v. State, 311 S.W.3d 452, 473\u201374 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). To preserve a\n\ncomplaint for appellate review, a party must have presented to the trial court a timely request,\n\n                                                 10\n\fobjection, or motion that states the specific grounds for the desired ruling if they are not apparent\n\nfrom the context of the request, objection, or motion. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1); Clark v. State,\n\n365 S.W.3d 333, 339 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012).                An objection is timely if made at the\n\nearliest opportunity or as soon as the grounds for the objection become apparent. Pena v. State,\n\n353 S.W.3d 797, 807 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011); Sandoval v. State, 409 S.W.3d 259, 306 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Austin 2013, no pet.). If a defendant fails to object until after an objectionable question has\n\nbeen asked and answered, and he can show no legitimate reason to justify the delay, his objection\n\nis untimely, and any claim of error is forfeited. Luna v. State, 268 S.W.3d 594, 604 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2008); Sandoval, 409 S.W.3d at 306.\n\n                Here, appellant objected to the extraneous-conduct evidence and requested a hearing\n\noutside the presence of the jury only after the officer had already testified about the encounter rather\n\nthan when the prosecutor began eliciting the details of the encounter. Thus, appellant\u2019s objection\n\nand request for a hearing were untimely. Appellant\u2019s late objection and untimely request did not\n\npreserve his complaint as to the admission of the officer\u2019s testimony. See Saldano v. State,\n\n70 S.W.3d 873, 889 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (\u201c[T]he failure to object in a timely and specific manner\n\nduring trial forfeits complaints about the admissibility of evidence.\u201d). Accordingly, we overrule\n\nappellant\u2019s third point of error.\n\n\n                                      Right to Present Defense\n\n                In his fourth point of error, appellant asserts that the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings\n\nviolated his right to present a complete and meaningful defense. As best as we can discern, appellant\n\ncomplains about the exclusion of the following:\n\n                                                   11\n\f       \u2022       evidence of a potential alternative perpetrator for V.R.\u2019s sexual assault,\n\n       \u2022       evidence of a potential alternative perpetrator for F.F.\u2019s sexual assault,\n\n       \u2022       F.F.\u2019s medical records from her stay in a psychiatric hospital,\n\n       \u2022       testimony demonstrating the detective\u2019s \u201cshoddy investigation,\u201d\n\n       \u2022       evidence of V.R.\u2019s juvenile record,\n\n       \u2022       a DPS lab report,\n\n       \u2022       testimony about V.R.\u2019s dating history,\n\n       \u2022       evidence of F.F.\u2019s pregnancy at the time of the SANE exam,\n\n       \u2022       opinion testimony regarding F.F.\u2019s truthfulness and unreliability as a witness,\n\n       \u2022       testimony about a purported prior false allegation of sexual assault made by F.F.,\n\n       \u2022       the detective\u2019s arrest warrant affidavit concerning the sexual assault of V.R., and\n\n       \u2022       rebuttal testimony from the SANE nurse who examined V.R.\n\n\n               As noted in the discussion of the previous point of error, preservation of error is a\n\nsystemic requirement on appeal. Blackshear, 385 S.W.3d at 590. An appellate issue involving a\n\nproffer of evidence, as opposed to an objection, must still satisfy the preservation-of-error\n\nrequirements. Reyna v. State, 168 S.W.3d 173, 179 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005) (stating that purpose\n\nof requiring objection is to give trial court or opposing party opportunity to correct error or remove\n\nbasis for objection and reasoning that \u201c[a]though this case involves a proffer of evidence rather than\n\nan objection, the same rationale applies\u201d). To preserve a complaint regarding the exclusion of\n\nevidence, a party must not only tell the judge that the evidence is admissible, but must also explain\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fwhy it is admissible. Id. at 177\u201379. Further, the explanation given at trial must match the one urged\n\non appeal. Id. at 179.\n\n                As to the excluded evidence about which appellant complains in this point of error,\n\nappellant objected only that he was \u201cdenied the opportunity to properly defend\u201d in connection with\n\nthe exclusion of F.F.\u2019s medical records from the psychiatric hospital. With all the other rulings\n\nrelated to the complained-of exclusion of evidence, appellant neither objected to the exclusion on\n\nthe ground, nor offered the evidence on the basis, that his right to present a meaningful defense was\n\ncompromised.     While the right to present a meaningful defense is rooted in constitutional\n\nprotections, even constitutional rights may be waived if the proper request, objection, or motion is\n\nnot asserted in the trial court. Saldano, 70 S.W.3d at 886\u201387; see Mendez v. State, 138 S.W.3d 334,\n\n342 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). If a party fails to properly object to constitutional errors at trial, these\n\nerrors can be forfeited. Clark, 365 S.W.3d at 339; Briggs v. State, 789 S.W.2d 918, 924 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1990). Because appellant did not articulate that his right to present a meaningful defense\n\nsupported the admission of the complained-of excluded evidence (other than F.F.\u2019s medical records\n\nfrom the psychiatric hospital), the trial court never had the opportunity to rule on this rationale.\n\nAccordingly, appellant did not preserve his complaint that the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings\n\nexcluding the complained-of evidence (other than F.F.\u2019s medical records from the psychiatric\n\nhospital) violated his right to present a proper defense.\n\n                As to the medical records from F.F.\u2019s hospitalization in a psychiatric hospital,\n\nappellant sought to offer these records to attack F.F.\u2019s reliability and credibility. However, during\n\ncross-examination of F.F., appellant elicited testimony about F.F.\u2019s mental-health issues, including\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fthe fact that she engaged in self-harming behavior (cutting herself), heard voices (demon voices\n\ntelling her to kill herself), had visual hallucinations (red and green eyes on the bathroom window that\n\nwatched her take showers), thought her father had been possessed by demons on three occasions (and\n\nsaw him levitate on one such occasion), and had suicidal ideation (including specific plans for killing\n\nherself). F.F. also admitted that when she was in the psychiatric hospital she denied being sexually\n\nabused, even though her hospital stay was after appellant began engaging in sexual activity with her.\n\nLater, on further cross-examination, F.F. acknowledged that she was not taking the medications\n\nprescribed to her to address her visual and auditory hallucinations.\n\n               In addition, appellant called a psychologist to testify as an expert on his behalf. Based\n\non his review of F.F.\u2019s hospital records, the doctor testified that F.F. was \u201csuffering from psychotic\n\nsymptoms\u201d and \u201cher GAF was quite low.\u201d5 The two GAF scores F.F. was given, 20 and 15, reflected\n\n\u201cextremely compromised\u201d functioning. The doctor explained that a GAF score between 21 and 30,\n\n\u201cwhich was a notch above what [F.F.] got,\u201d would reflect people who are actively delusional, having\n\nhallucinations, who would have serious impairment in their judgment or in their communication, and\n\nwould be unable to function in most situations. Appellant\u2019s counsel also questioned his expert about\n\nthe \u201crisk that is associated when a psychotic stops taking his or her medication.\u201d\n\n               Thus, the record reflects that the evidence for which appellant sought admission of\n\nF.F.\u2019s medical records was in fact presented to the jury by the defense. Appellant was able to attack\n\nF.F.\u2019s credibility with evidence of her mental-health issues. Appellant\u2019s assertion that the exclusion\n\n\n       5\n          The expert explained: \u201cThe GAF is an overall rating scale that mental health providers use,\nin order to try and make a very general assessment of the level of functioning of the individual. It\nruns from 0 to 100, with 100 being best, in ten-point increments.\u201d\n\n                                                  14\n\fof the medical records from the psychiatric hospital deprived him of \u201cthe opportunity to defend\u201d is\n\nwithout merit. We overrule appellant\u2019s fourth point of error.6\n\n\n                                    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n                In his final point of error, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to\n\nsupport his convictions for sexual assault of a child.\n\n\n\n\n        6\n           Additionally, we observe that appellant\u2019s brief misstates some of the complained-of rulings\nof the trial court and the purported exclusion of evidence. For example, appellant states in his brief\nthat his counsel was not permitted to attack F.F.\u2019s reputation for truthfulness through defense witness\nLaura Cerda. However, the record reflects that counsel explicitly asked Ms. Cerda, \u201cWhat was\n[F.F.]\u2019s reputation in the community for truthfulness?\u201d She answered the question, uninterrupted\nand without objection from the State. It was only to the subsequent questioning concerning a \u201cfalse\nrape claim\u201d that the State objected. In the ensuing proffer outside the presence of the jury, appellant\nwholly failed to make any showing of the falsity of the prior allegations. See Lopez v. State,\n18 S.W.3d 220, 225\u201326 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (for prior accusations to have probative value in\nimpeaching witness\u2019s credibility in sexual-assault case, party must show accusations were false and\nsimilar to current accusation). Accordingly, as to that line of questioning, the trial court ruled, \u201cThis\ntestimony is not coming in, and the jury will be instructed to disregard it in its entirety.\u201d Appellant\u2019s\ncharacterization of that trial-court ruling as excluding testimony from his witness about F.F.\u2019s\nreputation for truthfulness is inaccurate.\n         Also in his brief, appellant claims that his counsel was prevented from questioning Detective\nNichols about the impropriety of two complaining witnesses meeting to collaborate. Yet, the record\ndemonstrates otherwise. During cross-examination of the detective, appellant\u2019s counsel asked the\ndetective, \u201cIs it good police practice in your jurisdiction to allow two witnesses to get together and\ncompare their stories before they would come to you and give a second statement?\u201d After the court\noverruled the State\u2019s relevance objection, the detective answered, \u201cNot if they are known witnesses,\nno.\u201d Counsel later asked, \u201cIs it good practice, then, to allow a complaining witness and a \u2014\nsomebody who had been implicated as a potential complaining witness \u2014 to allow them to get\ntogether during the course of your investigation before you take an official statement from the second\none?\u201d Detective Nichols answered,\u201cIf they are in my control, no, it\u2019s not good practice.\u201d\n         Because we resolve this point of error on the basis of procedural default (as to the purportedly\nexcluded evidence other than F.F.\u2019s medical records) and do not address the substance of appellant\u2019s\ncomplaint (except as to the exclusion of F.F.\u2019s medical records), we need not address these and other\nincorrect descriptions of the record.\n\n                                                   15\n\f               Due process requires that the State prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, every element\n\nof the crime charged. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 313 (1979); Rabb v. State, --- S.W.3d ---,\n\nNo. PD-1643-12, 2014 WL 2865698, at *2 (Tex. Crim. App. June 25, 2014). When reviewing the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we consider all of the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the\n\nessential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319; Rabb,\n\n2014 WL 2865698, at *2; Brooks v. State, 323 S.W.3d 893, 899 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). We review\n\nall the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and assume that the trier of fact resolved\n\nconflicts in the testimony, weighed the evidence, and drew reasonable inferences in a manner that\n\nsupports the verdict. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 318; see Laster v. State, 275 S.W.3d 512, 517 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2009). We consider only whether the jury reached a rational decision. Isassi v. State, 330\n\nS.W.3d 633, 638 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (\u201cOur role on appeal is restricted to guarding against the\n\nrare occurrence when a factfinder does not act rationally.\u201d) (quoting Laster, 275 S.W.3d at 518).\n\n               In his brief, appellant argues that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction\n\nfor sexually assaulting V.R. because there was \u201cno physical evidence to corroborate [V.R.\u2019s] story,\u201d\n\nthere is no corroborating DNA evidence, appellant\u2019s mother and sister provided a \u201csolid alibi,\u201d the\n\ninvestigating detective was \u201cnot credible,\u201d and there were inconsistencies in witness testimony. He\n\nargues that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction for sexually assaulting F.F. because\n\nF.F.\u2019s accusation was \u201cnot supported by independent evidence,\u201d F.F. came forward only after talking\n\nto V.R. and discovering that the two girls had similar stories, there was \u201cno DNA corroboration,\u201d\n\nappellant\u2019s mother and sister explained how F.F. had knowledge of the contents of appellant\u2019s truck\n\n\n\n                                                  16\n\f(one of the alleged sites of sexual-assault incidents), F.F.\u2019s story regarding one sexual assault\n\nincident was \u201cneither plausible nor credible\u201d and was \u201cstrongly disputed\u201d by testimony of defense\n\nwitnesses, F.F. was not a reliable witness because she was afflicted with psychological issues, and\n\nthere were omissions and inconsistencies in F.F.\u2019s testimony.\n\n                However, the jury, as exclusive judge of the facts, is entitled to weigh and resolve\n\nconflicts in the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom.                 Clayton v. State,\n\n235 S.W.3d 772, 778 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007); see Tex. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 36.13, 38.04. The\n\njury is also free to accept or reject any or all of the evidence presented by either side. See Lancon\n\nv. State, 253 S.W.3d 699, 707 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); Wesbrook v. State, 29 S.W.3d 103, 111 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2000). Thus, when the record supports conflicting inferences, we must presume that the\n\ntrier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the verdict and defer to that resolution. Jackson,\n\n443 U.S. at 326; Anderson v. State, 416 S.W.3d 884, 888 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).\n\n                V.R. testified that on the night in question she was 15 years old and, at appellant\u2019s\n\ndirection, snuck out of her house while her parents were asleep. Appellant picked her up behind an\n\nH.E.B. grocery store near her house. He drove her to a vacant lot, where he parked his truck and put\n\nmultiple sun screens up to cover all the truck windows. He told V.R. to get in the back seat. When\n\nshe complied he told her, in a \u201ckind of mean\u201d voice, to remove her clothes. Again, she complied\n\nthinking that \u201csomething bad was going to happen to [her].\u201d Appellant then moved to the back seat\n\nand took his clothes off. He told V.R. to lay down and took a towel from under the seat, placing it\n\non the back seat under V.R.\u2019s bottom. V.R. testified that appellant then \u201cput his hand in [her]\n\nvagina.\u201d She stated that \u201c[i]t hurted\u201d when he put his fingers in the \u201cinside part of [her] vagina.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\fAppellant then instructed V.R. to get on her hands and knees. Once again, V.R. complied.\n\nAccording to V.R., appellant then \u201cstuck his penis in [her],\u201d \u201cin [her] vagina.\u201d She described feeling\n\nhis chest against her body as he \u201ckept going back and forth\u201d and indicated that \u201c[i]t hurted really\n\nbad.\u201d At that point, V.R. told appellant to stop, but he did not. She testified that appellant later\n\n\u201cstopped on his own because he was seeing blood\u201d coming from her vagina. Appellant then gave\n\nV.R. paper towels to wipe herself with. As he did so, he told V.R. to go home and take a shower.\n\nWhen V.R. cleaned herself with the paper towels she saw her blood on them. V.R. testified that\n\nafterwards \u201cthat part of [her] body . . . hurted\u201d and she felt \u201cconfused.\u201d Appellant told her to put her\n\nclothes back on, and he put his own clothes back on. He then got back in the front seat, told V.R.\n\nto stay in the backseat on the floor, started the truck, and began driving. He dropped her off by a\n\nchurch near her house.\n\n                F.F. testified that appellant had engaged in sexual activity with her over a period of\n\nnine to ten months when she was 15 years old. She said that she had sex with appellant more than\n\n100 times, describing the kinds of sex as \u201c[o]ral, anal and the normal [meaning vaginal].\u201d She\n\ndescribed an incident when appellant took her to a Motel 6 in San Marcos and \u201cput his fingers inside\n\n[her] . . . inside [her] vagina.\u201d She said that she told appellant to stop because he was hurting her\n\nand she was bleeding because \u201che was trying to put his whole fist inside [her].\u201d F.F. said that they\n\nhad sexual encounters in appellant\u2019s truck \u201ca lot of times\u201d and described an incident when appellant\n\nparked his truck in a Target parking lot in San Marcos, after hours, and put sun shades up to cover\n\nall the windows and \u201cdid [her] through the back,\u201d meaning he penetrated her anus with his penis.\n\nShe testified that \u201cit hurt\u201d and said that she bled, as she did several times when they had anal\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fintercourse. She also described the lubricant appellant often used when they had anal intercourse.\n\nAs to the indicted offense, F.F. testified about an incident in a church storage building during a\n\nchurch service. She said that she had gone to the storage to retrieve water for her mother. Appellant\n\ncame into the storage building and told her to pull her pants down. Initially F.F. refused but\n\nappellant locked the door and told her \u201cjust to do it.\u201d She testified that she \u201cdid it real quick\u201d and\n\nappellant \u201cput his penis in [her] vagina.\u201d She recalled that he was not wearing a condom and \u201che\n\ncomed inside\u201d a cup.\n\n                Thus, both V.R. and F.F. described instances in which appellant penetrated their\n\nsexual organs with his sexual organ as alleged in the indictment.              See Tex. Penal Code\n\n\u00a7 22.011(a)(2)(A). Both girls provided specific facts and sensory details when testifying about what\n\nhappened, where it happened, and (in general terms) when it happened. Appellant\u2019s contention that\n\nthe testimony of V.R. or F.F. is insufficient because it was uncorroborated is without merit. Because\n\nboth girls were under 17 years of age at the time of these offenses, their testimony alone is sufficient\n\nto support appellant\u2019s conviction for these sexual assaults. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 38.07(a),\n\n(b)(1); Perez v. State, 113 S.W.3d 819, 838 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin 2003, pet. ref\u2019d), overruled on other\n\ngrounds by Taylor v. State, 268 S.W.3d 571, 587 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). Further, the State has no\n\nburden to produce any corroborating or physical evidence. See Martines v. State, 371 S.W.3d 232,\n\n240 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2011, no pet.); see also Lee v. State, 176 S.W.3d 452, 458\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2004) (\u201cThe lack of physical or forensic evidence is a factor for the\n\njury to consider in weighing the evidence.\u201d), aff\u2019d, 206 S.W.3d 620 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f                Moreover, contrary to appellant\u2019s claim, there was corroborating evidence in this\n\ncase. The sexual-assault examinations of both girls provided corroborating medical evidence. The\n\nsexual-assault nurse who examined V.R. approximately 19 hours after the assault noted trauma\n\npresent in the genital exam of V.R. The nurse described acute injuries present in V.R.\u2019s sexual\n\norgan\u2014including bruising, tears, and swelling of the hymen\u2014consistent with V.R.\u2019s description of\n\nthe sexual assault. The nurse also observed V.R. and noted that she had difficulty sitting because\n\nshe was in pain. The clothing V.R. wore that night, recovered during the sexual-assault exam, had\n\nblood stains in the crotch area. Likewise, the sexual-assault nurse who examined F.F. noted trauma\n\npresent in F.F.\u2019s genital exam. The nurse observed several well-healed tears in F.F.\u2019s hymen\n\nconsistent with previous sexual activity. She opined that such injuries usually result from blunt force\n\ntrauma. Also, phone records demonstrated that appellant communicated with the girls, texting and\n\ncalling, during the time frame of the sexual assaults, just as the girls indicated. In addition, the girls\u2019\n\ntherapist described the common characteristics of victims of child sexual abuse and testified that\n\nboth girls exhibited some of those behaviors. Also, the testimony of law-enforcement officers\n\nshowed that appellant was discovered parked in his truck with F.F. on several occasions.7\n\n                In short, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, we\n\nconclude that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of these offenses beyond\n\n\n\n\n        7\n          In addition, the testimony of V.R. and F.F. demonstrated that appellant engaged in similar\nconduct with both girls: sexual activity in his parked truck after covering the windows with sun\nscreens and penetrating their sexual organs until they bled. Each girl\u2019s testimony helped corroborate\nthat of the other.\n\n                                                    20\n\fa reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence in his final point of error.\n\n\n                                   Clerical Error in Judgments\n\n               However, we observe that the judgments of conviction in this case contain clerical\n\nerrors. Both judgments of conviction reflect that the \u201cStatute for Offense\u201d is \u201cTPC 22.021(a)(2)(A).\u201d\n\nHowever, section 22.021 of the Penal Code is the statute for aggravated sexual assault. The statute\n\nfor sexual assault as alleged in the indictment in this case is section 22.011(a)(2)(A) of the Penal\n\nCode. This Court has authority to modify incorrect judgments when the necessary information is\n\navailable to do so. See Tex. R. App. P. 46.2(b); Bigley v. State, 865 S.W.2d 26, 27\u201328 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1993). Accordingly, we modify each judgment of conviction to state that the \u201cStatute for\n\nOffense\u201d is \u201c22.011(a)(2)(A) Penal Code.\u201d\n\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n               Having overruled all of appellant\u2019s points of error, we modify the trial court\u2019s\n\njudgments of conviction as noted above and affirm the judgments as modified.\n\n\n\n                                              __________________________________________\n                                              J.
