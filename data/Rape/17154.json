GARRISON,\n\n\n\n\n                                               Defendant-Appellant.\n\n\n\n\n          Appeal from the United States District Court\n              for the Southern District of Georgia\n\n\n                        (January 22, 1998)\n\n\n\n\nBefore HATCHETT, Chief Judge, BIRCH, Circuit Judge, and CLARK,\nSenior Circuit Judge.\n\fBIRCH, Circuit Judge:\n\n     In this Medicare fraud appeal, we determine whether the\n\nowner and chief executive officer of a home healthcare provider\n\nproperly was accorded a two-level enhancement in her sentence\n\nunder U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3 for abusing a position of public trust by\n\nsubmitting falsified Medicare claims to a fiscal intermediary. The\n\ndistrict court also imposed a two-level enhancement for an\n\naggravating role in the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c) and\n\ndeparted upward in calculating the fine. Because the two-level\n\nenhancement for abuse of a position of public trust was improper,\n\nwe vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.\n\n                           I. BACKGROUND\n\n         From 1976 to 1995, defendant-appellant, Jeanette G.\n\nGarrison, an experienced businesswoman and registered nurse,\n\nwas the owner, chief executive officer, and manager of\n\nHealthmaster Home Health Care, Inc. (\u201cHealthmaster\u201d),1 which\n\n\n\n     1\n       Although Healthmaster was owned jointly by Jeanette\nGarrison and her husband, Dr. Joseph Garrison, Jeanette Garrison\noperated the company.\n\n                                   2\n\fprovided home nursing care for patients with illnesses and\n\ndisabilities. Based in Augusta, Georgia, Healthmaster operated in\n\nfive states with twenty-two divisions, 125 separate locations, and\n\n2,500 to 3,000 employees.2 The Medicare program of the United\n\nStates Department of Health and Human Services3 reimbursed\n\nninety to ninety-three percent of Healthmaster\u2019s costs for eligible\n\nindividuals; the Medicaid program of the Georgia Department of\n\nMedical Assistance and private insurers reimbursed the balance of\n\nthe expenses. To obtain reimbursement from Medicare,\n\nHealthmaster submitted reports documenting its costs to Aetna Life\n\nand Casualty Insurance Company (\u201cAetna\u201d), which served as the\n\nfiscal intermediary for the Department of Health and Human\n\n\n\n\n     2\n         Garrison began the company with one employee in 1976.\n     3\n       The Medicare Act is part of the Social Security Act, 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395-1395cc. Medicare is a health insurance program\nthat provides medical benefits primarily to persons sixty-five\nyears of age and older who are eligible for Social Security\nretirement benefits and to individuals under sixty-five who have\nreceived Social Security benefits for at least two years. See 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1395c. Medicare beneficiaries are entitled to have\npayments made on their behalf for certain inpatient and\noutpatient hospital care and related services supplied by a\nhospital or \u201cprovider.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395d; 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.202\n(1995).\n\n                                  3\n\fServices, Health Care Financing Administration.4 The fiscal\n\nintermediary is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that\n\nMedicare payments are made to healthcare providers only for\n\ncovered services and may reject or adjust claims.5 Garrison\u2019s\n\nconduct that supported her plea agreement and guilty plea showed\n\nthat she directed the submission of cost reports by Healthmaster for\n\nnonallowable expenses, totaling an intended loss of approximately\n\n$1,200,000.\n\n     The first category of nonallowble expenses was political\n\ncontributions. Garrison instructed Healthmaster employee and\n\nattorney, Noel Ingram, to contact Healthmaster employees to solicit\n\ncontributions for specific political candidates of Garrison\u2019s choice.\n\n     4\n      Healthcare providers participate in the Medicare program by\nentering into a \u201cprovider agreement\u201d with the Secretary of Health\nand Human Services (\u201cSecretary\u201d). See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395cc.       The\nSecretary   reimburses   healthcare   providers   through   \u201cfiscal\nintermediaries,\u201d generally private insurance companies, which are\nresponsible for determining the total amount of Medicare\nreimbursement owed to a provider each year in accordance with\nMedicare policy. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395g, 1395(h)(c)(1).        Under\ncontract with the Department of Health and Human Services, a fiscal\nintermediary disburses Medicare benefit payments on a cost basis to\nproviders. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 421.1.\n     5\n       A suspension of payments can be made without notice to the\nhealthcare provider if the fiscal intermediary determines that\nthe claims for Medicare reimbursement \u201cinvolve[] fraud or willful\nnisrepresentation.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.371(b).\n\n                                   4\n\fIngram collected the political contributions from Healthmaster\n\nemployees and gave them to Garrison, who dispensed the money\n\nto the political candidates. The employees who made political\n\ncontributions were reimbursed subsequently through\n\nHealthmaster\u2019s payroll. These payroll expenditures then were\n\nsubmitted by Healthmaster to Aetna and falsely identified as\n\nemployee bonuses to qualify for reimbursement under Medicare.\n\nThese reimbursements by Medicare to Healthmaster more than\n\ntripled over a four-year period: $25,200 in 1989, $42,262.92 in\n\n1990, $44,700 in 1991, and $83,864.47 in 1992. The total amount\n\nof improper reimbursements by Medicare for this four-year period\n\nwas $195,991.39. In February, 1993, Garrison directed\n\nHealthmaster employee Mike Haddle, the cost report expert, to\n\nmake cost report adjustments for the improper amounts claimed.\n\nAn adjustment of $66,443 was made on the next cost report for the\n\nimproper claims for political contributions. Thus, the actual loss\n\nsuffered by Medicare for improper political contributions was\n\n$129,548.77.\n\n\n                                  5\n\f     The second category of impermissible costs that Healthmaster\n\nsubmitted to Aetna and for which it received Medicare\n\nreimbursement was shared services. On cost reports submitted to\n\nAetna, Garrison directed that Healthmaster employees, whose\n\nsalaries were reimbursed by Medicare, be shown as fulltime\n\nHealthmaster employees, although they performed work for her\n\nother companies, primarily Master Health Plan, Inc. (\u201cMaster Health\n\nPlan\u201d), a health maintenance organization, the costs of which were\n\nnot reimbursebursable by Medicare.6 Garrison instructed that\n\nHealthmaster bill Medicare for these shared service employees\u2019\n\nsalaries without deducting the non-Medicare work that they\n\nperformed for her other companies. Additionally, she had cost\n\nreports filed that falsely represented her non-Healthmaster\n\nemployees to be Healthmaster employees. As a result of both of\n\n\n\n     6\n       In addition to Healthmaster and Master Health Plan,\nGarrison also owned Employee Benefit Coordinators, Inc., the\npurpose of which was to market Master Health Plan; Healthmaster\nPharmaceutical and Equipment Company, Inc., which sold durable\nmedical equipment; Healthmaster Homecare of Georgia, Inc. (\u201cHM\nHomecare\u201d), an independent, Medicaid-reimbursed company that\nprovided home visitation services other than skilled nursing; and\nPreferred Care, Inc., which was a holding company for Equipment\nCompany and HM Homecare.\n\n                                 6\n\fboth of these misrepresentations, Medicare improperly reimbursed\n\nHealthmaster $770,814.71 between 1989 and 1993. In February,\n\n1993, Garrison instructed Haddle to make a cost report adjustment\n\nof $300,000 to compensate for the employees who spent a portion\n\nof their time working at Garrison\u2019s other companies, where salaries\n\nwere not reimbursable by Medicare. The actual loss suffered by\n\nMedicare under Garrison\u2019s shared services scheme was\n\n$470,814.71.\n\n     The third category of nonallowable expenses that were\n\nreimbursed by Medicare was miscellaneous personal costs.\n\nHealthmaster received Medicare reimbursement for such\n\nexpenditures as golfing trips to Pebble Beach, California, for a\n\nlobbyist and political figures; a trip by Garrison, her daughter, and\n\nHealthmaster employees to the 1992 Democratic Party National\n\nConvention; the partial purchase price of $30,000 for a travel\n\nagency, Morris Travel, bought by Garrison and disguised on cost\n\nreports as employee \u201ctraining,\u201d complete with supporting sign-in\n\nsheets placed in Healthmaster files to deceive auditors; a\n\n\n                                   7\n\fhoneymoon cruise for a Healthmaster employee; a trip to the 1991\n\nWorld Series in Minnesota; approximately $19,000 for alcohol\n\nserved at Healthmaster Christmas parties between 1989 and 1993;\n\napproximately $22,000 for alcohol and food for Healthmaster\u2019s\n\nGeorgia Dome suite between 1992 and 1994; a 1986 Mercedes\n\nBenz owned by Healthmaster that was traded for a 1993 Mercedes\n\nfor Garrison\u2019s son; and five pleasure trips to New York City, Las\n\nVegas, and Nashville taken by Healthmaster employees, for which\n\nbrochures, falsely indicating a business purpose for these trips,\n\nwere produced and placed in Healthmaster files to deceive\n\nauditors. From 1989 to 1993, Healthmaster submitted to Medicare\n\nas reimbursable expenses various miscellaneous personal costs\n\nthat amounted to $225,633.73.\n\n     Garrison was charged in a 133-count indictment with five\n\ncodefendants: Healthmaster, Master Health Plan, Dennis J. Kelly,\n\nDavid W. Suba, and Managed Risk Services, Inc.7 Represented by\n\n        7\n          Kelly, a certified public accountant, was the chief\nfinancial officer and vice president of Healthmaster, or second-in-\ncommand under Garrison. He recommended that she hire Suba as an\ninsurance risk manager.      Kelly and Suba formed Managed Risk\nServices, Inc., of which Suba was president. These three\n\n                                  8\n\fcounsel, Garrison entered into a plea agreement with the\n\ngovernment in which she acknowledged that she willfully had\n\nsubmitted fraudulent cost reports for Medicare reimbursement.\n\nUnder the terms of the plea agreement, Garrison agreed to plead\n\nguilty to the first ten counts of the indictment,8 to sell Healthmaster\n\nto an independent party, to pay $11,500,000 in restitution,9 to forgo\n\nchallenging a ten-year exclusion from participation as a healthcare\n\nprovider in the Medicare program, and to cooperate with law\n\nenforcement by giving truthful information and testimony in the\n\ninvestigation and prosecution of unlawful activity.\n\n     In exchange, the government agreed to dismiss the remaining\n\n\n\n\ncodefendants were tried jointly and convicted.\n     8\n       Count 1 charged Garrison with conspiracy to defraud the\nUnited States in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Counts 2 through\n10 charged her with false statements to defraud the United States\nMedicare program in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\n     9\n       Of the restitution amount, Garrison was to pay $10,000,000\nto Medicare and $1,500,000 to Medicaid to reimburse these public\nhealth insurance programs for the losses caused by Garrison,\nHealthmaster, Master Health Plan, and related companies and their\nofficers and employees to these respective programs. Under the\nrestitution terms of Garrison\u2019s plea agreement, the government\nagreed to dismiss the indictment as to Healthmaster and Master\nHealth Plan provided that full disgorgement was accomplished by\nthese companies.\n\n                                   9\n\fcounts against Garrison,10 to dismiss the indictment as to\n\nHealthmaster and Master Health Plan, to forgo in the Southern\n\nDistrict of Georgia further prosecution of Garrison \u201cor any entity in\n\nwhich she has majority ownership, directly or through trusts, or\n\nthrough trusts for her children, for any criminal act or omission\n\noccurring prior to the date of the Indictment that is currently known\n\nto the government,\u201d R1-331-5, to recommend a three-level\n\nreduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility under\n\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, to take no position on upward adjustments for\n\naggravating role in the offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 and for\n\nabuse of a position of trust under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, and to forgo\n\nrecommending a fine, provided that there was complete restitution\n\nof $11,500,000. Except for seeking a two-level enhancement for\n\nmore than minimal planning under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(2)(A) and a\n\nloss determination of approximately $1,630,00011 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\n\n     10\n       The remaining indictment counts were: Counts 11-32, false\nstatements to defraud the United States; Counts 36-78, mail\nfraud; Counts 79-105, money laundering; Counts 116-118,\nembezzlement from an employee benefit plan; and Count 133,\nforfeiture.\n     11\n       This loss amount included $129,548.77 for improperly\nreimbursed political contributions, $770,814.71 for \u201cghost\n\n                                  10\n\f2F1.1, the government agreed to make no recommendation\n\nregarding the sentence. While the government agreed to file a\n\nmotion for downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for\n\nsubstantial assistance to authorities, provided Garrison fulfilled all\n\nof her obligations under her plea agreement, she understood and\n\nagreed that the decision to depart downward was within the\n\nsentencing court\u2019s discretion. Garrison stated that she entered into\n\nthe plea agreement voluntarily without coercion or promises other\n\nthan those in the agreement that resulted from negotiations with the\n\ngovernment and her attorneys with her \u201cauthorization, knowledge\n\nand consent.\u201d R1-331-13.\n\n     At the plea proceeding, Garrison reaffirmed her understanding\n\nof the charges against her, the penalties that she confronted, and\n\nthe terms of her plea agreement. She acknowledged that the plea\n\nagreement did not bind the district court and that she could receive\n\n\n\nemployees\u2019\u201d salaries, and $262,536.76 for pleasure trips and\nother improper billings. Although Garrison maintained that the\namount of loss directly attributable to her was less than\n$500,000, the $1,630,000 loss calculated by the government was\nincluded in the restitution amount of $11,500,000, which Garrison\nagreed to pay under the terms of her plea agreement.\n\n                                   11\n\fthe maximum sentence on the counts to which she pled guilty. The\n\ndistrict judge accepted Garrison\u2019s guilty plea after determining that\n\nshe \u201cis fully competent, fully aware of everything that is taking place\n\nhere,\u201d that there \u201cis an ample factual basis for the plea,\u201d and that \u201cit\n\nis voluntary and made with a full appreciation of its consequences.\u201d\n\nR2-316-27-28.\n\n     Because Garrison acknowledged at her October 26, 1995,\n\nsentencing that she had reviewed the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d)\n\nwith her attorney and that it was factually accurate, the district\n\njudge adopted the account of Garrison\u2019s offenses in the PSR as his\n\nfindings of fact. The district judge determined Garrison\u2019s offense\n\nlevel to be 20.12 Garrison\u2019s criminal history category of I yielded a\n\nsentencing range of thirty-three to forty-one months of\n\nimprisonment and a fine of $7,500 to $75,000.\n\n\n     12\n       Garrison\u2019s offense level of 20 reflected a base offense\nlevel of 6 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(a) with the following\nadjustments: an 11-level increase for a loss of more than\n$800,000 but less than $1,500,000, U.S.S.G. 2F1.1(b)(1)(L); a\ntwo-level increase for more than minimal planning, U.S.S.G. \u00a7\n2F1.1(b)(2)(A); a two-level increase for aggravating role in the\noffense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c); a two-level increase for abuse of a\nposition of public trust, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3; and a three-level\nreduction for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a),\n(b).\n\n                                   12\n\f     The district judge imposed the minimum Guidelines prison\n\nterm of thirty-three months, followed by three years of supervised\n\nrelease, during which time Garrison will be required to perform 200\n\nhours of community service. Garrison also was ordered to pay\n\nrestitution of $11,500,00, the amount stated in the plea agreement.\n\nThe district court departed upward and imposed the maximum fine\n\non each count to which Garrison pled guilty for a total fine of\n\n$2,500,000. At the sentencing proceeding, Garrison\u2019s attorney\n\nobjected to the enhancements for abuse of a position of public trust\n\nand aggravating role in the offense as well as the upward departure\n\nin the fine.\n\n     On appeal, Garrison challenges her sentence enhancements\n\nfor abuse of a position of public trust and for an aggravating role in\n\nthe offense. She also contends that these enhancements\n\nsubjected her to impermissible double counting.13 Finally, she\n\ncontests the upward departure of her fine as to notice and amount.\n\n\n     13\n       Because we conclude that Garrison\u2019s sentence improperly\nwas enhanced for abuse of a position of public trust and remand\nfor resentencing without this enhancement, we need not address\nher double-counting issue.\n\n                                  13\n\f                             II. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Enhancement for Abusing a Position of Public Trust\n\n     Garrison argues that her two-level enhancement for abuse of\n\na position of public trust was erroneous since she did not occupy\n\nsuch a position because of the fiscal intermediary, Aetna, which\n\ndirectly requested reimbursement from Medicare for Healthmaster\u2019s\n\nhealthcare services. She also contends that any false statements\n\nmade to Medicare were included in her crime of conviction, which\n\nprecludes this enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3.14 While the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s factual determination that a defendant abused a\n\nposition of public trust is reviewed for clear error, its conclusion that\n\nthe defendant\u2019s conduct justifies the abuse-of-trust enhancement\n\nis a question of law that we review de novo. United States v. Terry,\n\n60 F.3d 1541, 1545 (11th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___,\n\n116 S. Ct. 737 (1996).\n\n\n     14\n       Given Garrison\u2019s sentencing date of October 26, 1995, we\nuse the applicable United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n(1994) and statutes and regulations in effect on that date. See\nUnited States v. Camacho, 40 F.3d 349, 354 (11th Cir. 1994) (\u201cThe\nsentencing court must employ the guidelines in effect at the time\nthe sentencing hearing is held.\u201d), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 115\nS. Ct. 1810 (1995).\n\n                                   14\n\f     The abuse-of-trust enhancement provides:\n\n     If the defendant abused a position of public or private\n     trust, or used a special skill, in a manner that significantly\n     facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense,\n     increase by 2 levels. This adjustment may not be\n     employed if an abuse of trust or skill is included in the\n     base offense level or specific offense characteristic.\n\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. The determination of whether a defendant\n\noccupied a position of trust that would warrant this enhancement is\n\nmade from the perspective of the victim of the crime. See United\n\nStates v. Zaragoza, 123 F.3d 472, 481 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, ___\n\nU.S. ___, 118 S. Ct. 317 (1997); United States v. Mackey, 114 F.3d\n\n470, 475 (4th Cir. 1997); United States v. Castagnet, 936 F.2d 57,\n\n62 (2d Cir. 1991); United States v. Hill, 915 F.2d 502, 506 n.3 (9th\n\nCir. 1990). \u201cFor the enhancement to apply, defendant must have\n\nbeen in a position of trust with respect to the victim of the crime,\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Ragland, 72 F.3d 500, 502 (6th Cir. 1996)\n\n(emphasis added), and \u201cthe position of trust must have contributed\n\nin some significant way to facilitating the commission or\n\nconcealment of the offense,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, comment. (n.1);\n\n\u201c[s]uch persons generally are viewed as more culpable,\u201d id.\n\n                                   15\n\fcomment. (backg\u2019d.).15 In the fraud context, section 3B1.3 has\n\nbeen recognized to apply in two situations: (1) \u201cwhere the\n\ndefendant steals from his employer, using his position in the\n\ncompany to facilitate the offense,\u201d and (2) \u201cwhere a \u2018fiduciary or\n\npersonal trust relationship exists\u2019 with other entities, and the\n\ndefendant takes advantage of the relationship to perpetrate or\n\nconceal the offense.\u201d United States v.

In analyzing whether section 3B1.3 applies in a fiduciary\n\nor personal trust situation, sentencing and reviewing courts must\n\n\u201cdistinguish between those arms-length commercial relationships\n\nwhere trust is created by the defendant\u2019s personality or the victim\u2019s\n\n     16\n       As examples, our court has determined that neither a food\nservice foreman, arrested while attempting to smuggle cocaine\ninto a federal penitentiary, United States v. Long, 122 F.3d\n1360, 1365-66 (11th Cir. 1997), nor a president and sole\nshareholder of an investment company that actually was a Ponzi\nscheme, Mullens, 65 F.3d at 1566-67, abused a position of trust\nmaking them eligible for a \u00a7 3B1.3 enhancement as imposed by the\nrespective district courts.\n\n                                  17\n\fcredulity, and relationships in which the victim\u2019s trust is based on\n\ndefendant\u2019s position in the transaction.\u201d Koehn, 74 F.3d at 201;\n\nsee Mullens, 65 F.3d at 1567 (\u201cFraudulently inducing trust in an\n\ninvestor is not the same as abusing a bona fide relationship of trust\n\nwith that investor.\u201d). Since the \u201cprimary concern of \u00a7 3B1.3 is to\n\npenalize defendants who take advantage of a position that provides\n\nthem freedom to commit or conceal a difficult-to-detect wrong,\u201d only\n\nsuch a defendant whose position enables or significantly facilitates\n\nthe offense is eligible for this enhancement.17 Koehn, 74 F.3d at\n\n201 (emphasis added); see Brunson, 54 F.3d at 678 (\u201cThe\n\nguideline enhancement requires more than a mere showing that\n\nthe victim had confidence in the defendant. Something more akin\n\nto a fiduciary function is required.\u201d).\n\n     The application note accompanying section 3B1.3 explains:\n\n     \u201cPublic or private trust\u201d refers to a position of public or\n     private trust characterized by professional or managerial\n\n     17\n       The Tenth Circuit further explained: \u201cIt follows that not\nevery misuse of a fiduciary relationship will subject a defendant\nto the enhancement; he must either occupy a \u2018formal position of\ntrust\u2019 or create sufficient indicia that he holds such a position\nthat it is appropriate to hold him so accountable.\u201d Koehn, 74\nF.3d at 201-02 (quoting United States v.

Persons\n     holding such positions ordinarily are subject to\n     significantly less supervision than employees whose\n     responsibilities are primarily nondiscretionary in nature. .\n     . . This adjustment, for example, would apply in the case\n     of an embezzlement of a client\u2019s funds by an attorney\n     serving as a guardian, a bank executive\u2019s fraudulent loan\n     scheme, or the criminal sexual abuse of a patient by a\n     physician under the guise of an examination. This\n     adjustment would not apply in the case of an\n     embezzlement or theft by an ordinary bank teller or hotel\n     clerk because such positions are not characterized by\n     the above-described factors.\n\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, comment. (n.1). Thus, \u201cthe abuse of trust\n\nenhancement applies only where the defendant has abused\n\ndiscretionary authority entrusted to the defendant by the victim\u201d;\n\narm\u2019s-length business relationships are not available for the\n\napplication of this enhancement.18 United States v. Jolly, 102 F.3d\n\n     18\n       The Sixth Circuit has provided elucidating clarification\nregarding the type of trust that must be abused for a \u00a7 3B1.3\nenhancement to be applicable:\n\n          Clearly, then, the notion of \u201ctrust\u201d embodied in\n     the guideline is not the one contemplated by the\n     ordinary dictionary concept of reliance or confidence\n     for, in that sense, a bank trusts its tellers not to\n     steal from the till. Rather, as used in the guideline,\n     \u201cposition of public or private trust\u201d is a term of art,\n     appropriating some of the aspects of the legal concept\n     of a trustee or fiduciary.

The\n\ndefendant in Broderson, a vice president of Grumman Data\n\nSystems Corporation, had negotiated a contract with the National\n\nAeronautics and Space Administration (\u201cNASA\u201d) to provide\n\nsupercomputer hardware, software, and related integration and\n\nmaintenance services to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\n\nHouston, Texas. The contract negotiations were governed by the\n\nTruth in Negotiations Act (\u201cTINA\u201d), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2306a, and the\n\nimplementing regulations for TINA in the Federal Acquisition\n\nRegulations (\u201cFAR\u201d), 48 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 15.801-15.804. Both TINA and\n\nFAR required Broderson, who was responsible for preparing and\n\nsubmitting Grumman\u2019s proposals to NASA, to disclose to NASA all\n\ncost and pricing information until NASA and Grumman reached an\n\nagreement. Broderson arranged to finance Grumman\u2019s purchase\n\nof the supercomputer hardware through a third-party financing\n\ncompany and lease the equipment to NASA. The financing\n\ncompany initially offered an interest rate of 13.77 percent, and he\n\ndisclosed this rate to NASA. Broderson, however, failed to inform\n\n\n                                 22\n\fNASA that the financing company subsequently reduced the\n\ninterest rate to 10.5 percent. He submitted to NASA two\n\nCertificates of Current Cost or Pricing Data, which falsely stated\n\nthat, to the best of his knowledge and belief, Grumman\u2019s cost and\n\npricing information were accurate and current. The final contract\n\nprovided lease payments over fifty-seven months at the 13.77\n\npercent interest rate. Thereafter, Grumann sold the lease\n\npayments to the financing company at the 10.5 percent interest\n\nrate. A jury convicted Broderson of executing a major fraud\n\nscheme by incorrectly pricing a government contract valued at\n\nmore than $1,000,000, wire fraud, and making false statements to\n\nthe United States. At sentencing, the district court assigned\n\nBroderson a base offense level of six under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(a)\n\nand enhanced his sentence two levels under section 3B1.3 for\n\nabuse of a position of public trust.\n\n     In determining that the section 3B1.3 enhancement was\n\nerroneous and remanding for resentencing, the Second Circuit\n\ndetermined that Broderson \u201cdid not occupy a position of trust vis-a-\n\n\n                                   23\n\fvis the government\u201d because \u201cTINA and FAR imposed specific\n\nlegal obligations . . . that he failed to fulfill.\u201d Broderson, 67 F.3d at\n\n455. Deriving guidance from the examples in the commentary to\n\nsection 3B1.3, \u201can attorney embezzling a client\u2019s money, a bank\n\nexecutive executing a fraudulent loan scheme, and a physician\n\nsexually abusing a patient during an examination,\u201d that court\n\nconcluded that the position of trust addressed by section 3B1.3\n\nreferred to discretion specifically entrusted to the defendant by the\n\nvictim. Id. at 456; see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, comment. (n.1); see also\n\nUnited States v. Yount, 960 F.2d 955, 957 (11th Cir. 1992)\n\n(summarily affirming section 3B1.3 enhancement for bank vice-\n\npresident and trust officer who misappropriated for his own use\n\ntrust accounts of elderly persons, none of whom lived\n\nindependently). Rejecting the government\u2019s overbroad definition of\n\na position of trust, the Second Circuit explained:\n\n           The government\u2019s theory seems so far reaching\n     that it might cause virtually anyone who is commanded\n     by statute to make an accurate report to the government\n     to be subject to a Section 3B1.3 enhancement. All\n     taxpayers who file false tax returns, for example, might\n     be included. We believe that it is fairly obvious that the\n\n                                    24\n\f     Sentencing Commission harbored no intent that the\n     enhancement be so sweeping.\n         ....\n           Broderson was a high-ranking executive at\n     Grumman and therefore had managerial discretion to\n     negotiate for that company. Had he accepted a bribe\n     from another party to give that party better terms than\n     were necessary, that would have abused his position of\n     trust. In contrast, NASA entrusted Broderson with no\n     discretion whatsoever and whatever \u201ctrust\u201d NASA placed\n     in Broderson was based strictly on the explicit\n     commands of TINA and FAR.\n\nBroderson, 67 F.3d at 455, 456; see United States v. Kummer, 89\n\nF.3d 1536, 1546-47 (11th Cir. 1996) (upholding section 3B1.3\n\nenhancement for a financial secretary of a local labor union and a\n\ngeneral representative of the international union for using funds\n\nfrom the union\u2019s health and welfare plan to purchase stock in a\n\nconstruction project in exchange for obtaining a personal home\n\nloan).\n\n     Garrison similarly argues that abuse of trust in her position as\n\nchief executive of Healthmaster would occur if she had accepted a\n\nbribe from a party negotiating with Healthmaster to Healthmaster\u2019s\n\ndetriment. In contrast, she contends that \u201cfalse statements on the\n\ncost reports submitted to a fiscal intermediary for the Government\n\n                                 25\n\fdo not implicate such a trust relationship.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 26.\n\nSignificantly, when an arm\u2019s length relationship existed between\n\nthe defendant and the victim such that the discretionary authority\n\nentrusted to the defendant was not directly from the victim, a\n\nsection 3B1.3 enhancement was held to be improper. See, e.g.,\n\nJolly, 102 F.3d at 48-50 (concluding that president of corporation\n\ndid not stand in a position of trust relative to creditors of the\n\ncorporation); United States v. West, 56 F.3d 216, 221 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1995) (holding that title of president carried \u201cno special weight\u201d\n\nbecause it was not the position in the company but the exercise of\n\nmanagerial and professional discretion with respect to the task\n\nhired by a customer to perform that determined eligibility for abuse-\n\nof-trust enhancement); Brunson, 54 F.3d at 675-78 (determining\n\nthat no trust relationship exists in a typical arm\u2019s-length commercial\n\nrelationship where defendant, who defrauded the Russian Coal\n\nCorporation of over four million dollars and transferred into his\n\npersonal bank account sums, which he used personally for luxury\n\nautomobiles, purchase of a residence, vacations, jewelry, computer\n\n\n                                    26\n\fhardware and software, college tuition for his son, furniture, and\n\nhome improvements); Moored, 997 F.2d at 144-45 (deciding that a\n\nsection 3B1.3 enhancement is improper when defendant abused a\n\nposition of trust with a third party; in applying for loans, defendant\n\nfalsified an offer to purchase stock as well as falsified a letter of\n\ncredit from a bank).\n\n     In this case, the PSR, adopted by the district court, states that\n\n\u201c[t]he Medicare program of the United States Department of Health\n\nand Human Services is the primary victim in the instant offense.\u201d\n\nPSR at 5, \u00b6 10 (Sept. 25, 1995). As in Broderson, statutory\n\nreporting requirements do not create a position of trust relative to a\n\nvictim of the crime. Furthermore, Garrison and Healthmaster did\n\nnot report directly to Medicare but to Aetna, the fiscal intermediary\n\nwhose specific responsibility was to review requests for Medicare\n\nreimbursement before submitting those requests to Medicare.\n\nBecause of this removed relationship to Medicare, plus Aetna\u2019s\n\nreview of Healthmaster\u2019s Medicare requests, Garrison and\n\nHealthmaster were not directly in a position of trust in relation to\n\n\n                                   27\n\fMedicare. While Medicare may have been the victim in this case,\n\nthe section 3B1.3 enhancement is unavailable because Garrison\n\ndid not occupy a sufficiently proximate position of trust relative to\n\nMedicare. Additionally, Garrison did not hold a position of\n\ndiscretion concerning her crime of false reporting to Medicare, as\n\nrequired for application of the abuse-of-trust enhancement. As her\n\ncounsel explained at sentencing, Garrison lacked the discretion\n\nand ability to conceal the false cost reports submitted for Medicare\n\nreimbursement and relied on others to accomplish this deception.19\n\n     19\n       At sentencing, Garrison\u2019s counsel explained her lack of\nability to defraud Medicare and her reliance on financial experts\nat Healthmaster for filing the false cost reports for Medicare\nreimbursement:\n\n          [T]he crime here is false statements, that is\n     filing false reports for Medicare reimbursements.\n          Far from having specialized knowledge, Mrs.\n     Garrison had to hire people who had specialized\n     knowledge to do that. She didn\u2019t do it. She didn\u2019t do\n     the cost reports.\n          When she opened up her office by herself in one\n     room with a straight-back chair and a folding card\n     table, the next employee she hired\u2013 \u2013 she was looking\n     for people to take over the books because she was in\n     the nursing side of the business.\n          The more and more she got into her business, the\n     more she relied on people who had been federal auditors\n     in the past, who were CPAs, who understood the\n     intricacies of this process.\n          She hired Joe Norman. She hired Mike Haddle.\n     These are the people who had the specialized knowledge,\n     not Mrs. Garrison. She does not -- -- it does not\n     apply to her in terms of the enhancement for\n     specialized knowledge.\n\n                                   28\n\f     In contrast to Garrison\u2019s lack of discretion and inability to\n\n\n\n              . . . .\n          Mrs. Garrison didn\u2019t deal with the federal\n     auditors. When the federal auditors came to\n     Healthmaster, they didn\u2019t go and spend their days with\n     Mrs. Garrison. They spent their days with Dennis\n     Kelly. They spent their days, maybe some of those\n     days, with the cost report expert, Mike Haddle.\n          But primarily, if not exclusively, Dennis Kelly\n     was the point person for dealing with the federal\n     auditors, not Mrs. Garrison. So it [section 3B1.3]\n     doesn\u2019t apply to her.\n          . . . .\n     [T]heir [the government\u2019s] basic position . . . is Mrs.\n     Garris4n was the CEO of these companies, and we all\n     need to have correct Medicare reimbursement.\n          That\u2019s not enough for the enhancement because, in\n     order to have an enhancement because of level of\n     authority, that level of authority must have\n     facilitated -- -- substantially facilitated the\n     commission of the crime.\n          Simply because Mrs. Garrison was the CEO of the\n     company, that does not, therefore, under the case law,\n     give the Court or this report [PSR] the authority to\n     enhance her based upon her CEO status. Far from it.\n          The report discusses that she had direct access to\n     the cost reports and discusses manipulation of the\n     reports and document production. Absolutely no, Your\n     Honor. There are no facts in this report or no facts\n     before this Court which show that Mrs. Garrison had\n     anything to do with the federal auditors because that\n     wasn\u2019t her job.\n          There are no facts before this Court and no facts\n     in this report which deal with Mrs. Garrison\n     manipulating reports and documents which were presented\n     to the federal auditors. There are no facts in this\n     report and no facts before the Court about Mrs.\n     Garrison manipulating any document production. That\n     wasn\u2019t her job.\n          There were people in that company that did have\n     hands-on dealings with those auditors: Dennis Kelly, he\n     was the point man; the expert, Mike Haddle, he was, I\n     assume, one of the individuals who would be dealing on\n     a day-to-day basis with retrievable documents. But not\n     Mrs. Garrison.\n\nR4-11, 12-14 (emphasis added).\n\n                                  29\n\fproduce the fraudulent Medicare reimbursement requests as\n\nsection 3B1.3 envisions is a physician who possesses the expertise\n\nto create erroneous medical records and, consequently, fraudulent\n\nMedicare reports that are difficult to detect and to question.20 Cf.\n\nUnited States v.

Garrison did not have the\n\nexpertise to produce the fraudulent Medicare reports; Kelly, a\n\ncertified public accountant, vice president and second in command\n\nat Healthmaster, was tried and convicted for generating the\n\nfraudulent Medicare reports. Kelly and others working under his\n\nsupervision, not Garrison, caused the fraudulent Medicare claims to\n\nbe difficult for Aetna to detect. Accordingly, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s determination that Garrison occupied a position of\n\ntrust with respect to Medicare was clearly erroneous because she\n\ndid not produce the fraudulent Medicare claims, and the fiscal\n\nintermediary, Aetna, did not discover the erroneous reports upon\n\n\n                                   31\n\freviewing them.21 Garrison\u2019s relationship with Medicare was too\n\nattenuated for her to have received the abuse-of-trust\n\nenhancement because Medicare relied on Aetna to review and to\n\nsubmit proper claims for Medicare reimbursement.\n\n     In addition to arguing that she did not occupy a position of\n\ntrust relative to Medicare within the meaning of section 3B1.3,\n\nGarrison also contends that the district judge erred in imposing the\n\nsection 3B1.3 enhancement, which does not apply if abuse of trust\n\nwas \u201cincluded in the base offense level or specific offense\n\ncharacteristic.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. She argues that the offense to\n\nwhich she pled guilty, perpetrating a fraud on Medicare through\n\nfalse cost reports, is the same as the basis for the enhancement for\n\nan abuse of a position of public trust. We agree.\n\n     In Broderson, the Second Circuit explained that \u201c[t]he conduct\n\nthat is the basis of the conviction must be independently criminal . .\n\n\n\n     21\n       While medical diagnoses and treatments determined as a\nresult of a physician\u2019s training and experience may be difficult,\nif not impossible, to detect by a fiscal intermediary, the\nmedical costs for such items as supplies submitted by\nHealthmaster for reimbursement by Medicare were ascertainable by\nAetna.\n\n                                  32\n\f. and not itself the abuse of trust.\u201d Broderson, 67 F.3d at 456; see\n\nJolly, 102 F.3d at 49 (determining that the trust involved in an\n\narm\u2019s-length, non-fiduciary fraud is the victim\u2019s reliance on\n\nmisleading statements, which is \u201ca specific offense characteristic of\n\nfraud, and a Section 3B1.3 enhancement is inappropriate\u201d).\n\nBecause Broderson\u2019s fraudulent conduct was signing the certificate\n\nstating that Grumman had complied with the applicable regulations,\n\n\u201c[a]ny abuse of trust was therefore \u2018included in the base offense\n\nlevel\u2019 of six for fraud and deceit.\u201d Broderson, 67 F.3d at 456\n\n(quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3). Similarly, this court in Mullens\n\ndetermined that Mullens\u2019s control over the investment company\u2019s\n\naccounts facilitated his fraud offense, which was another way of\n\nstating that he controlled an elaborate, well-organized Ponzi\n\nscheme. Because the district judge had enhanced Mullens\u2019s\n\nsentencing guideline range for that conduct, an additional\n\nenhancement for abuse of trust was improper. Mullens, 65 F.3d at\n\n1567; cf. United States v. Clark, 989 F.2d 447, 449 (11th Cir. 1993)\n\n(affirming section 3B1.3 enhancement for police officer who pled\n\n\n                                  33\n\fguilty to accepting bribes for protecting cocaine transactions during\n\nreverse sting because his base offense level for cocaine\n\npossession \u201cd[id] not include the factor of abuse of a position of\n\ntrust\u201d).\n\n      Since Garrison\u2019s base fraud crime was the submission of false\n\nstatements on cost reports submitted to Aetna for Medicare\n\nreimbursement, she cannot receive an enhancement for abuse of a\n\nposition of public trust based on the same conduct under the\n\nspecific terms of section 3B1.3. Additionally, Garrison had no\n\nspecial expertise and was more removed from the criminal conduct\n\nat issue in this case than the defendants in Mullens or Broderson\n\nbecause she did not create or submit the false Medicare claims to\n\nAetna for approval; they were produced by Kelly and others at\n\nHealthmaster who had the ability to formulate the reports. Because\n\nGarrison did not hold a direct or fiduciary-type position of public\n\ntrust relative to the Medicare program, the victim, and her fraud\n\ncrime of conviction encompasses the same false cost reports that\n\nthe district judge used as the basis for her abuse-of-public-trust\n\n\n                                  34\n\fenhancement, the district judge on remand will resentence\n\nGarrison without the section 3B1.3 enhancement.\n\nB. Enhancement for Aggravating Role in the Offense\n\n     Garrison argues that the district judge improperly enhanced\n\nher sentence by two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c) for her\n\naggravating role in the crimes to which she pled guilty. She\n\ncontends that there is no evidentiary basis to support a finding that\n\nshe was a leader or manager of one or more participants in her\n\ncrime of false statements. We review the sentencing court\u2019s\n\ndetermination of role in the offense for clear error. United States\n\nv. Tapia, 59 F.3d 1137, 1143 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, __ U.S. __,\n\n116 S. Ct. 401, and cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 116 S. Ct. 546\n\n(1995).\n\n     Under section 3B1.1(c), the district judge is authorized to\n\nincrease a sentence by two levels if \u201cthe defendant was an\n\norganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity\u201d\n\nother than extensive criminal conduct involving five or more\n\nparticipants. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c). To qualify for this\n\n\n                                  35\n\fenhancement, the defendant must have organized, led, managed\n\nor supervised \u201cone or more other participants.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1,\n\ncomment.

The application notes further\n\nguide the district court \u201c[i]n distinguishing a leadership and\n\norganizational role from one of mere management or supervision\u201d:\n\n     Factors the court should consider include the exercise of\n     decision making authority, the nature of participation in\n     the commission of the offense, the recruitment of\n     accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the\n     fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning\n     or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the\n     illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority\n     exercised over others.\n\nId. comment. (n.4); see United States v. Ramsdale, 61 F.3d 825,\n\n830 (11th Cir. 1995) (using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.4) to\n\ndetermine role in the offense).\n\n     Garrison\u2019s direction of Ingram, Healthmaster\u2019s in-house\n\nattorney with Medicare expertise, in the political contributions\n\nscheme, described in the conspiracy count to which Garrison pled\n\nguilty, supports the district judge\u2019s conclusion that Ingram was a\n\n                                  36\n\fparticipant in Garrison\u2019s political contributions scheme within the\n\nmeaning of section 3B1.1, comment. (n.1).22 Moreover, at the\n\n     22\n       The political contributions scheme, including Garrison\u2019s\ndirection of Ingram, an unindicted coconspirator, is alleged as\nfollows in the conspiracy count of the indictment to which\nGarrison pled guilty:\n\n          1. In the fall of 1989, [Garrison] directed\n     [Ingram] to solicit political contributions from\n     various HEALTHMASTER, INC. employees for a\n     gubernatorial candidate.\n\n          2. [Ingram] then prepared and submitted for\n     [Garrison\u2019s] approval a list of potential employees to\n     be approached for a $200.00 political contribution.\n\n          3. At [Garrison\u2019s] direction, [Ingram] then\n     contacted each of the HEALTHMASTER, INC. employees,\n     requested the $200.00 political contributions, and told\n     the employees that they would be reimbursed $400.00 by\n     HEALTHMASTER, INC. if the contribution was made.\n\n          4. At [Garrison\u2019s] behest, [Ingram] then collected\n     the employees\u2019 personal contribution checks.\n\n          5. Soon thereafter, in the fall of 1989, the list\n     of contributing employees was submitted to\n     HEALTHMASTER, INC.\u2019s payroll office with instructions\n     from [Garrison] that each employee who contributed\n     $200.00 should be reimbursed or given a \u201cbonus\u201d in the\n     amount of $400.00.\n\n          6. HEALTHMASTER, INC. then reimbursed each\n     contributing employee in the amount of $400.00.\n\n          7. On approximately twenty different occasions,\n     between 1989 and 1992, [Garrison] directed [Ingram] to\n     solicit political contributions from HEALTHMASTER, INC.\n     employees for a total of approximately ten different\n     political candidates selected by [Garrison], in\n     generally the same manner as described above.\n\n          8. Thereafter, from 1990 through 1992,\n     HEALTHMASTER, INC. submitted annual cost reports to\n     Medicare claiming reimbursement for its employees\u2019\n     wages, which included the amounts reimbursed those\n     employees for political contributions.\n\n                                  37\n\fchange of plea proceeding, Garrison admitted to the district judge\n\nthat she had \u201csolicited political contributions and reimbursed\n\nemployees through compensation on a cost report that was\n\nreimbursed by Medicare.\u201d R2-12. Additionally, Special Agent\n\nStephen Robertson of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation testified\n\nconcerning the reimbursement of political contributions:\n\n     Jeanette Garrison had an employee, Noel Ingram,\n     contact a group of employees and solicit contributions for\n     specific political candidates. A list of these contributions\n     was maintained.\n           The employees would give their contributions to Ms.\n     Ingram, who would give them to Mrs. Garrison for\n     presentation to the candidate.\n           The employees were reimbursed through payroll,\n     which was, in turn, submitted by cost report to Medicare\n     for reimbursement.\n\n\n\n\n          9. In this manner, between 1989 and 1992,\n     HEALTHMASTER, INC. fraudulently reimbursed its\n     employees\u2019 political contributions in the total amount\n     of approximately $195,991.39. In or about March, 1993,\n     after a former employee of one of Garrison\u2019s companies,\n     EBC, filed a lawsuit against EBC which threatened to\n     publicly disclose the Healthmaster political\n     contribution scheme, HEALTHMASTER, INC. made just one\n     cost report adjustment of only approximately $66,443.00\n     for political contributions in 1992. HEALTHMASTER,\n     INC. fraudulently obtained reimbursements from Medicare\n     for the balance of its employees\u2019 political\n     contributions.\n\nR1-1-14-16.\n\n                                 38\n\fId. at 14-15.23 Not only did Garrison decline to cross-examine\n\nRobertson, but also she conceded that his account was\n\n\u201c[s]ubstantially correct.\u201d Id. at 17.\n\n     At sentencing, Garrison\u2019s attorney acknowledged to the court\n\nthat \u201cMrs. Garrison directed Noel Ingram to solicit political\n\ncontributions. Absolutely right. Mrs. Garrison did solicit Noel\n\nIngram, or direct her, to go out and solicit political contributions.\n\nWe have no quarrels with that, and we don\u2019t dispute that.\u201d R4-25.\n\nThe attorney for Healthmaster further testified at sentencing that,\n\nafter Garrison encountered legal problems with her healthcare\n\n     23\n       At the sentencing hearing, the probation officer\ntestified as follows regarding Ingram\u2019s participation in the\nMedicare fraud and Garrison\u2019s direction of her:\n\n          In the role in the offense issue, there is no\n     question that Mrs. Garrison directed Noel Ingram to\n     solicit the political contributions from other\n     employees within the company. As chairman of\n     Healthmaster, Mrs. Garrison was the only person there\n     who could tell someone to go out and solicit these\n     contributions.\n          The fact that Noel Ingram did not necessarily\n     submit the cost report is not critical. The element of\n     the offense in relevant conduct here allows that to be\n     considered, that she was directed by Mrs. Garrison to\n     commit that fraud.\n          The fact that [Ingram] was not charged criminally\n     is a decision that the Government made. There is no\n     indication that that was necessarily not a criminal\n     act.\n\nR4-22.\n\n                                    39\n\fbusinesses, she instructed Kelly, second in command at\n\nHealthmaster, and Haddle, the cost report expert, to determine \u201cif\n\nthere had been improper entries in the cost reports relating to\n\npolitical contributions and to fix all the cost reports applicable. . . .\n\nThe direction was to take whatever steps were necessary to correct\n\nthe cost reports and get them right.\u201d Id. at 30, 31. The factual\n\naccount of Garrison\u2019s instruction of Ingram concerning political\n\ncontributions as stated in the PSR, which the district judge adopted\n\nwith no objection from Garrison, supports Ingram\u2019s participant\n\nstatus as well as Garrison\u2019s aggravating role in the crime under\n\nsection 3B1.1(c) and describes how Ingram collected hundreds of\n\nthousands of dollars at Garrison\u2019s direction over a four-year\n\nperiod.24\n\n     24\n       The following factual account of the political\ncontributions scheme is stated in the PSR under offense conduct:\n\n     In the instant offense, Garrison had employee, Noel\n     Ingram, contact a group of employees each year in an\n     effort to solicit political contributions for specific\n     political candidates. The employees gave their\n     political contributions to Ingram who then gave them to\n     Garrison for presentation to the respective political\n     candidates. Employees were later reimbursed through\n     Healthmaster, Incorporated\u2019s payroll expenditures.\n     These payroll expenditures were in turn submitted by\n     Healthmaster, Incorporated to Aetna as employee bonuses\n     which qualified for reimbursement through Medicare\n\n                                    40\n\f     This record evidence refutes Garrison\u2019s representation that\n\n\u201c[t]he Government failed to prove, and the trial court did not find,\n\nIngram participated knowingly in some part of the criminal\n\nenterprise,\u201d which precludes her from being a participant under\n\nsection 3B1.1(c). Appellant\u2019s Brief at 35. Garrison would not have\n\ntrusted an unwitting pawn to play such an important role in her\n\npolitical contributions scheme. Ingram\u2019s delegated responsibilities\n\n\n\n     funds. In 1989, Healthmaster, Incorporated submitted\n     cost reports in the form of bonuses which were, in\n     fact, reimbursements for political contributions in the\n     amount of $25,200. In 1990, the false reimbursements\n     for political contributions totaled $42,262.92. In\n     1991, the false reimbursements for political\n     contributions totaled $44,700. In 1992, the\n     reimbursements for political contributions totaled\n     $83,864.47. The reimbursements from Medicare for\n     political contributions for the calendar years 1989\n     through 1992 totaled $195,991.39. However, in February\n     1993, Garrison directed employee Mike Haddle to make a\n     cost adjustment of approximately $66,443 to Aetna for\n     reimbursement to Medicare for the political\n     contribution reimbursements. Therefore, Medicare\n     suffered a direct loss of $129,548.77 as a result of\n     the political contribution reimbursement scheme.\n     However, the intended loss to Medicare was $195,\n     991.39.\n\nPSR at 4, \u00b6 6 (emphasis added). With respect to the two-level\nenhancement for Garrison\u2019s aggravating role in the offense, the\nPSR states: \u201cPursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c), the offense is\nincreased two levels. Garrison was the chief executive officer\nand owner of Healthmaster, Incorporated. Garrison directed\nemployee, Noel Ingram, to solicit political contributions from\nother employees. The defendant, therefore, is correctly\ndescribed as a leader and manager in the instant offense.\u201d Id.\nat 6, \u00b6 19.\n\n                                  41\n\fin that scheme consisted of deciding which employees to solicit,\n\nserving as Garrison\u2019s liaison to those employees, promising them a\n\n$400 reimbursement for each $200 contribution, collecting a\n\nconsiderable amount of money from these employees over a four-\n\nyear period of time, and delivering to Garrison the funds. Garrison\n\nthen distributed the money to candidates of her choice, fraudulently\n\nbilled Medicare for it, and recycled the Medicare reimbursements to\n\nthe contributing employees with a hundred percent interest on their\n\ncontributions. Rather than being a dupe, Ingram was\n\nHealthmaster\u2019s in-house attorney whose expertise was Medicare\n\nregulations, the very law that Garrison\u2019s political contributions\n\nscheme violated.25 Additionally, Garrison not only used Ingram in\n\nthis political contributions scheme, but also she directed Kelly and\n\nHaddle to rectify the false Medicare cost reports when the scheme\n\nwas about to be exposed.\n\n\n\n     25\n       Given the extensive involvement in this Medicare fraud\ncrime of Noel O\u2019Neal Ingram, a member of the State Bar of\nGeorgia, the Clerk is directed to provide a copy of this opinion\nto the Office of the General Counsel of the State Bar of Georgia\nfor the purpose of determining whether this unindicted\ncoconspirator is fit for continued membership in the Georgia Bar.\n\n                                  42\n\f     As defined by the application notes for section 3B1.1, Ingram\n\nwas a participant in Garrison\u2019s fraud on the Medicare program\n\nthrough the political contributions scheme, and her conduct was\n\ndirected, managed and supervised by Garrison. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7\n\n3B1.1, comment. (n.1-2). Furthermore, Garrison instructed Kelly\n\nand Haddle to remedy Healthmaster\u2019s false cost reports to\n\nMedicare to avert detection of the four-year political contributions\n\nscheme. We conclude that the district judge properly imposed a\n\ntwo-level enhancement in Garrison\u2019s sentence under section\n\n3B1.1(c) for her aggravating role as an organizer and leader in the\n\npolitical contributions scheme to defraud Medicare because this\n\ndetermination is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nSee United States v. Stanley, 24 F.3d 1314, 1323 (11th Cir. 1994).\n\nC. Fine\n\n     1. Notice\n\n     Garrison complains that she did not receive adequate notice\n\nthat the district judge would depart upward in imposing her fine in\n\n\n\n\n                                  43\n\fthe amount of $2,500,00026 in accordance with Burns v. United\n\nStates, 501 U.S. 129, 138-39, 111 S. Ct. 2182, 2187 (1991); United\n\nStates v. Paslay, 971 F.2d 667, 673-74 n.11 (11th Cir. 1992).\n\nUnder Burns, the district court must give \u201creasonable notice\u201d that it\n\nis contemplating an upward departure in the sentencing range\n\nestablished by the Sentencing Guidelines. Burns, 501 U.S. at 138,\n\n111 S.Ct. at 2187. \u201cThis notice must specifically identify the ground\n\non which the district court is contemplating an upward departure.\u201d\n\nId. at 138-39, 111 S.Ct. at 2187. Our court has held that Burns\n\nrequires that the notice \u201cmust affirmatively indicate that an upward\n\ndeparture is appropriate based on a particular ground\u201d and that the\n\ndefendant must be provided with notice \u201csetting forth the potential\n\nground (or grounds) for the upward departure within a \u2018reasonable\u2019\n\namount of time prior to the sentencing hearing.\u201d Paslay, 971 F.2d\n\nat 673-74 n.11.\n\n\n     26\n       Based on Garrison\u2019s total offense level of 20, which\nincluded the two-level enhancement for abuse of trust that we\nhave determined to be incorrect, her fine range would have been\n$7,500 to $75,000. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(c)(3). Our elimination of\nthe abuse-of-trust enhancement, however, does not affect our\ndecision to uphold the fine, which is based on independently\njustifying reasons.\n\n                                  44\n\f     Garrison concedes that her attorney received the revised PSR\n\ncontaining notice of the possibility of upward departure on October\n\n20, 1995, which was six days before sentencing on October 26,\n\n1995. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 42. This notice advised: \u201cThe Court may\n\nconsider an upward departure from the stated guideline fine range\n\nbecause the defendant profited substantially from her involvement\n\nin the offense and the sale of the company.\u201d27 Revised PSR at 16,\n\n\u00b6 63 (Oct. 19, 1995).28 Garrison acknowledged the notice of a\n\n\n\n     27\n       Under her plea agreement, Garrison was to sell\nHealthmaster to an independent party and to use the proceeds to\npay $11,500,000 in restitution to Medicare and Medicaid. See\nR1-331-5; PSR at 5, \u00b6 10. A contract for the sale of Healthmaster\nfor $54,740,000 was scheduled for closing on November 1, 1995.\nAfter payment of costs, taxes, and creditors, Garrison and her\nfamily were to receive between $14,200,000 and $18,000,000 from\nthe sale.\n     28\n       We note that this revised PSR was not in the record on\nappeal, although both parties quote the same recommendation for\nupward departure in Garrison\u2019s fine that we quote concerning the\nissue of notice. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 42; Appellee\u2019s Brief at\n34. Since adequate notice of upward departure in Garrison\u2019s fine\nis an issue on appeal and this revised PSR was the notice, it was\nincumbent upon the parties in preparing the record on appeal to\nbe certain that this revised PSR, essential to our review of the\nnotice issue with respect to the fine, was part of the appellate\nrecord. Instead, this court had to obtain this revised PSR, which\nboth parties acknowledge receiving six days prior to the\nsentencing hearing, from the probation office. We are\ndisappointed by the lack of diligence shown by the parties in\nthis case in preparing the record on appeal. It is the\nresponsibility of the parties to work with each other and the\nclerk\u2019s office to ensure that the record on appeal is complete\nfor our review of the appellate issues.\n\n                                 45\n\fpotential upward departure in her fine and challenged the rationale\n\nthat she would profit from the sale of Healthmaster in her\n\nsentencing memorandum:\n\n           On Friday morning, October 20, [Garrison\u2019s]\n     counsel received an amendment by the probation office\n     to the presentence report. The amendment suggested\n     the possibility of an upward departure on the fine range\n     because [Garrison] \u201cprofited substantially from . . . the\n     offense and the sale of the Company.\u201d This is incorrect.\n     In the sale of the company, the state and federal\n     governments are receiving $9M more in repayments\n     than they are owed plus $10M in taxes. Any funds\n     remaining after the payment of creditors are\n     serendipitous and will benefit the trusts of the Garrison\n     children. The incremental benefit to Garrison companies\n     from political contributions and shared services is being\n     repaid many times over.\n\nR1-421-25 n.1.29\n\n     29\n       Garrison\u2019s sentencing memorandum, dated October 20, 1995,\nalso was not part of the record on appeal, although the\ngovernment quotes the same footnote in its brief. See Appellee\u2019s\nBrief at 35. In the course of our appellate review, the district\ncourt, at our request, obtained Garrison\u2019s sentencing memorandum\nand docketed it for the first time as received there on November\n24, 1997; our court did not receive Garrison\u2019s sentencing\nmemorandum until December 5, 1997. Whatever inadvertence caused\nGarrison\u2019s sentencing memorandum not to have been docketed\npreviously in the district court and, consequently, not to be\npart of the original record in this case, we know that it was\nreceived by the government, which filed a response, R1-330, prior\nto Garrison\u2019s sentencing and that it was reviewed by the district\ncourt because it is referenced in the sentencing transcript, R4-\n4. Accordingly, we have considered Garrison\u2019s sentencing\nmemorandum and the representations therein. We reiterate,\nhowever, that it is the responsibility of the parties to see that\nthe appellate record is complete and that documents from which\n\n                                 46\n\f     At sentencing, Garrison\u2019s counsel confirmed that he had no\n\nobjections \u201cas to the factual accuracy\u201d of the PSR but that he did\n\n\u201cdispute some of the conclusions legally.\u201d R4-4. Garrison, who\n\nhad filed a statement that she had \u201cread, reviewed and\n\nunder[stood] the presentence report,\u201d R1-326-1, agreed with her\n\ncounsel\u2019s representations at sentencing, R4-4. After Garrison\u2019s\n\ncounsel presented witnesses on her behalf, the district judge asked\n\nGarrison if she wanted to speak, but she declined, and her attorney\n\nannounced that they were ready to proceed with the sentencing.\n\nId. at 91. The district judge asked counsel if there was \u201cany reason\n\nwhy I should not now proceed with the imposition of sentence?\u201d Id.\n\nat 92. Garrison\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cThere is no reason, Your\n\nHonor.\u201d Id.\n\n     The district judge then imposed Garrison\u2019s sentence, including\n\nthe $2,500,000 fine. Her counsel did not object to the fine when it\n\nwas imposed, and the district judge went on to address supervised\n\n\n\nthey quote on appeal were docketed in the district court and are\npart of the record on appeal.\n\n\n                                 47\n\frelease, dismissal of the remaining counts of the indictment,\n\narrangements for Garrison\u2019s surrender, and her right to appeal.\n\nThereafter, the district judge asked if Garrison\u2019s counsel had \u201cany\n\nobjection to the Court\u2019s finding of fact and conclusions of law or to\n\nthe manner in which sentence was pronounced?\u201d R4-97. The\n\nfollowing colloquy ensued between Garrison\u2019s counsel and the\n\nsentencing judge:\n\n      COUNSEL: Your Honor, to preserve the record, we do\n      object on the abuse of trust and role in the offense.\n           Additionally, although not argued to you today, we\n      footnoted in our sentencing memorandum our objection\n      to an upward departure in the fine level which the Court\n      has imposed here.\n\n      THE COURT: Yes.\n\n      COUNSEL: And we would state that we respectfully do\n      not believe that the record reflects that the elements for\n      such an upward departure exist in this case.\n           And therefore, we wish to preserve our appellate\n      issues on that.\n\n      THE COURT: Certainly. All right. That is the judgment\n      of the Court.\n\nId.\n\n      Because Garrison acknowledges that she received notice of\n\n\n                                  48\n\fthe possibility of upward departure in her fine six days prior to her\n\nsentencing in the revised PSR, she objected to an upward\n\ndeparture in her sentencing memorandum, and she relied on that\n\nobjection at sentencing, we conclude that she received reasonable\n\nnotice of the potential of upward departure in her fine. She acted\n\nupon this notice in her responsive sentencing memorandum and\n\nwas content to rely upon her footnote response in that\n\nmemorandum at sentencing, although the district judge gave her\n\ncounsel the opportunity to object at sentencing following his\n\nstatement of the reasons for the upward departure in the fine.\n\nSince the district judge based his reasons for the upward departure\n\nin Garrison\u2019s fine on facts found in the PSR, which Garrison\n\nasserted to the court that she had reviewed, understood, and\n\naccepted as accurate, she cannot now contrariwise represent that\n\nshe was unprepared for or surprised by the reasons upon which the\n\ndistrict judge based the upward departure.30\n\n     30\n       The lack-of-notice cases relied upon by Garrison are\ninapposite because either the PSR did not indicate the\npossibility of an upward departure or did not specify the reason\nfor an upward departure. See Burns, 501 U.S. at 131-32, 111\nS.Ct. at 2184 (holding that the district court violated Fed.

Ct. 2325 (1993).\nIn contrast, Garrison was notified in the revised PSR, which she\nreceived six days prior to her sentencing, of the potential\nupward departure in her fine because of her substantial profits\nresulting from her involvement in the crimes to which she pled\nguilty and the sale of the company. While the district judge\nelaborated on these reasons for the upward departure at\nsentencing, they nevertheless were the bases for the upward\ndeparture for which Garrison was prepared by the notice in the\nrevised PSR.\n     31\n       Sentencing Guidelines policy statements are binding on\nfederal courts as interpretive guides to the meaning of an\napplicable guideline.

Furthermore, she should not\n\nhave been surprised by the reasons for the upward departure,\n\nwhich were based on the facts of the PSR. There was no plain\n\nerror regarding notice of the upward departure in Garrison\u2019s fine.\n\n     2. Upward Departure\n\n     Garrison argues that the district judge used improper factors\n\nin upwardly departing in the imposition of her fine from the\n\nGuidelines range of $7,500 to $75,000 , U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(c)(3).\n\nShe contends that her $2,500,000 fine \u201dis so large and\n\ndisproportionate to the offense that it is unreasonable on its face.\u201d\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 49. We review a district court\u2019s departure from\n\nthe applicable Sentencing Guidelines for abuse of discretion, and\n\nthat decision is entitled to \u201csubstantial deference .\u201c Koon v. United\n\nStates, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 116 S. Ct. 2035, 2046 (1996).\n\n     The Sentencing Guidelines mandate that \u201c[t]he court shall\n\nimpose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes\n\nthat he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any\n\n\n                                  52\n\ffine.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(a); see United States v. Hairston, 46 F.3d\n\n361, 376 (4th Cir. 1995) (\u201cThe defendant bears the burden of\n\ndemonstrating his present and prospective inability to pay [a\n\nfine].\u201d), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 116 S. Ct. 124 (1995). After a\n\nsentencing court determines that a fine is appropriate, it then is\n\nrequired to consider \u201cseven factors in setting the amount of the fine,\n\nincluding the evidence presented as to the defendant\u2019s ability to\n\npay.\u201d United States v. Lombardo, 35 F.3d 526, 527 (11th Cir.\n\n1994) (per curiam). Under the Sentencing Guidelines, those\n\nfactors that the district court must consider to determine the\n\namount of a fine are:\n\n     (1) the need for the combined sentence to reflect the\n     seriousness of the offense (including the harm or loss to\n     the victim and the gain to the defendant), to promote\n     respect for the law, to provide just punishment and to\n     afford adequate deterrence;\n\n     (2) any evidence presented as to the defendant\u2019s ability\n     to pay the fine (including the ability to pay over a period\n     of time) in light of his earning capacity and financial\n     resources;\n\n     (3) the burden that the fine places on the defendant and\n     his dependents relative to alternative punishments;\n\n\n                                  53\n\f     (4) any restitution or reparation that the defendant has\n     made or is obligated to make;\n\n     (5) any collateral consequences of conviction, including\n     civil obligations arising from the defendant\u2019s conduct;\n\n     (6) whether the defendant previously has been fined for\n     a similar offense; and\n\n     (7) any other pertinent equitable considerations.\n\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d). Although we have not required that the\n\ndistrict court make specific findings concerning each of these\n\nfactors, we need the court\u2019s reasoning or sufficient record evidence\n\nto show consideration of these factors for our review. Lombardo,\n\n35 F.3d at 529-30. We have recognized that the amount of a fine\n\ncan be based on a defendant\u2019s role in the criminal conduct, the\n\nlikelihood that prior income was derived predominantly from the\n\ncriminal activity, \u201cand the district court\u2019s realistic assessment of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s personal ability to pay.\u201d United States v. Nelson, 837\n\nF.2d 1519, 1526 n.4 (11th Cir. 1988). Since these factors must be\n\nconsidered with the imposition of any fine, they comprise the\n\nfoundation for the fine determined by the sentencing court from\n\nwhich the district court in this case additionally departed upward.\n\n                                   54\n\fThe Sentencing Guidelines anticipate the potential for upward\n\ndepartures in fines in particular cases where the Guideline range is\n\ninsufficient:\n\n     The Commission envisions that for most defendants, the\n     maximum of the guideline fine range from subsection (c)\n     will be at least twice the amount of gain or loss resulting\n     from the offense. Where, however, two times either the\n     amount of gain to the defendant or the amount of loss\n     caused by the offense exceeds the maximum of the fine\n     guideline, an upward departure from the fine guideline\n     may be warranted.\n\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2, comment. (n.4) (emphasis added).\n\n     In Koon, the Supreme Court established the analysis for\n\ndetermining whether a particular Guidelines departure is justified:\n\n     1) What features of this case, potentially, take it outside\n     the Guidelines\u2019 \u201cheartland\u201d and make of it a special, or\n     unusual, case?\n\n     2) Has the Commission forbidden departures based on\n     those features?\n\n     3) If not, has the Commission encouraged departures\n     based on those features?\n\n     4) If not, has the Commission discouraged departures\n     based on those features?\n\nKoon, ___ U.S. at ___, 116 S.Ct. at 2045 (citation and internal\n\n\n                                  55\n\fquotation marks omitted).\n\n      At sentencing, the district judge explained his reasoning for\n\nimposing Garrison\u2019s sizeable fine:\n\n            The Defendant shall pay the United States a fine of\n     two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on each of Counts\n     1 through 10, for a total fine of two million, five hundred\n     thousand dollars.\n            And that fine has been imposed in a sense as an\n     upward departure from the fine guideline range. In\n     deciding to depart upward, I, of course, considered and\n     had to consider many factors:\n            First, the Court wants to be sure that the combined\n     sentence reflects the seriousness of the offense and that\n     it promotes respect for the law;\n            In addition, that it provides a just punishment under\n     all the facts;\n            And finally, and most importantly, as has been\n     pointed out by counsel, affords an adequate deterrence.\n            In addition, I have evaluated the Defendant\u2019s ability\n     to pay the imposed fine and the possibility that it would\n     impose a burden on her or her dependents. The\n     information, however, provided and contained in the\n     Presentence Report has shown that she does have\n     significant financial resources to pay the fine and that\n     she has provided a trust and numerous business\n     opportunities for her dependents which should provide\n     them with ample financial security for the balance of their\n     lives.\n            I have chosen the fine amount to reflect the intent of\n     the Sentencing Commission as stated in Section 5E1.2\n     in the application note number four, which states that if\n     two times the amount of loss exceeds the maximum of\n     the fine guideline, an upward departure may be\n\n                                  56\n\f     warranted. And the amount of loss in this case, of\n     course, greatly exceeded that maximum and fully\n     authorizes the fine that the Court has imposed.\n           As has been commented repeatedly, this is a very\n     high profile case. In these times, not only because of\n     this case, but we hear continually the public\u2019s concern\n     about the Medicare program and the possibility of losing\n     medical benefits in old age.\n           And I think it would be reasonable to assume that\n     the public sees the Defendant as a person who has\n     violated the law, and as a result, made very substantial\n     profits for herself and her family even after restitution and\n     other civil obligations have been paid.\n           So to impose a fine less than the maximum allowed\n     by statute could cause the public to lose respect for the\n     courts and the judicial process, something that becomes\n     involved and is involved in the imposition of any\n     sentence by this Court.\n\nR4-93-95 (emphasis added). We affirm a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s\n\ndetermination of the facts supporting an upward departure unless\n\nthat determination was clearly erroneous.\u201d32 United States v.\n\nGunby, 112 F.3d 1493, 1503 (11th Cir. 1997).\n\n\n     32\n       The district court\u2019s factual findings concerning the \u00a7\n5E1.2(d) factors in determining a fine is reviewed under the\nclearly erroneous standard and is to be distinguished from our\nabuse-of-discretion review of the district court\u2019s decision to\ndepart upward. See Long, 122 F.3d at 1366; Lombardo, 35 F.3d at\n527; see also United States v. Rowland, 906 F.2d 621, 623 (11th\nCir. 1990) (recognizing that, because a district court\u2019s\ndetermination of the appropriate fine involves factual issues,\n\u201cincluding the defendant\u2019s ability to pay the fine imposed,\u201dthe\ndistrict court\u2019s calculation of the fine is entitled to deference\nand can be reversed on appeal only for clear error).\n\n                                  57\n\f     Garrison conceded the factual accuracy of the PSR, which\n\nstates that \u201c[t]he minimum amount of intended loss to have been\n\nsuffered by Medicare as a result of Garrison\u2019s activity is\n\n$1,192[,]440.21,\u201d PSR at 5, \u00b6 9, and that \u201cMedicare suffered a\n\ndirect loss of a minimum of $743,397.49 in the instant offense,\u201d id.\n\nat \u00b6 10 .33 The application commentary to the fraud guideline,\n\nunder which Garrison was sentenced, states that \u201c[c]onsistent with\n\nthe provisions of \u00a7 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an\n\nintended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be\n\ndetermined, this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual\n\nloss.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, comment. (n.7). Garrison pled guilty to\n\nconspiracy in addition to nine false statement counts. A minimum\n\nintended loss of approximately $1,200,000 is almost sixteen times\n\n$75,000, which is the maximum of the Sentencing Guidelines fine\n\nrange on each count. Even the direct loss in excess of $743,000\n\nwas nearly ten times $75,000.\n\n\n     33\n       As the PSR recommended, the district judge increased\nGarrison\u2019s base offense level by eleven levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\n2F1.1(b)(1)(L), which corresponds to a loss of more than $800,000\nbut less than $1,500,000. See PSR at 6, \u00b6 16.\n\n                                   58\n\f     The Sentencing Guidelines provide that \u201c[t]he amount of the\n\nfine should always be sufficient to ensure that the fine, taken\n\ntogether with other sanctions imposed, is punitive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7\n\n5E1.2(e).   Garrison\u2019s net worth, stated in her PSR, which she\n\nagreed at sentencing was accurate, was $46,483,011. PSR at 11.\n\nShe was to make an estimated $14,000,000 from the sale of\n\nHealthmaster after all of her obligations to the government and the\n\ncompany\u2019s creditors were paid. Over ninety percent of\n\nHealthmaster\u2019s business was reimbursed by Medicare, which\n\nGarrison had bilked for years to cover her and her family\u2019s personal\n\nexpenses, her employees\u2019 salaries for non-Medicare work, and\n\neven political contributions. Additionally, Garrison agreed and\n\nunderstood pursuant to her plea agreement that \u201cthe question of\n\nfine will ultimately be within the Court\u2019s discretion, in accordance\n\nwith the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d R1-331-4. The record evidences\n\nthat these facts that support the district judge\u2019s upward departure\n\nare not clearly erroneous.\n\n     In departing upward in Garrison\u2019s fine, the district judge\n\n\n                                  59\n\fspecifically relied on the Sentencing Guidelines application\n\ncommentary, providing that \u201c[w]here . . . two times either the\n\namount of gain to the defendant or the amount of loss caused by\n\nthe offense exceeds the maximum of the fine guideline, an upward\n\ndeparture from the fine guideline may be warranted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7\n\n5E1.2, comment.

Whatever Garrison\u2019s agreements are with\nthe trustee in bankruptcy for Healthmaster and the nature of the\nadditional $5,000,000 payment that she claims that she has made,\nin her plea agreement, Garrison knowingly and voluntarily agreed\nto pay $11,500,000 as \u201cfull and complete restitution,\u201d\n$10,000,000 to Medicare and $1,500,000 to Medicaid, for losses\nattributable to her and her companies. R1-331-5. Furthermore,\nin the provision in the second paragraph of \u00a7 5E1.2,\ncomment.(n.4), upon which Garrison relies, the Sentencing\nCommission \u201csought to state an additional basis for departure,\nnot to narrow the terms of the departure authorized in the first\nparagraph.\u201d United States v. Leonard, 67 F.3d 460,462 (2d Cir.\n1995) (per curiam).\n\n                                  60\n\fGuidelines fine of $75,000 was inadequate and, therefore, an\n\nupward departure was warranted under section 5E1.2, comment.\n\n(n.4), the district judge calculated Garrison\u2019s fine pursuant to her\n\nplea agreement, wherein she agreed that she was subject to a fine\n\nnot to exceed $250,000 on each of the ten counts to which she\n\npled guilty, R1-331-9, 10.35 This calculation complies with 18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3571(b)(3).36\n\n     Additionally, Garrison selectively quotes out of context from\n\nthe district judge\u2019s reasons for the upward departure in her fine to\n\nargue that the judge improperly based the departure on her \u201csocio-\n\neconomic status\u201c and \u201cpublicity.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 50, 51.\n\nWhen viewed in context of his reasons for the upward departure in\n\n\n     35\n       Garrison pled guilty to Count One for conspiracy to\ndefraud the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 and\nCounts Two through Ten for false statements to Medicare in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\n     36\n       Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571(b)(3), the maximum to which a\ndefendant may be sentenced per felony is $250,000. Garrison\nincorrectly argues that her $2,500,000 fine violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\n3571(d), which alternatively limits a defendant\u2019s fine based on\npecuniary gain or loss to \u201cnot more than the greater of twice the\ngross gain or twice the gross loss.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571(d).\nGarrison fails to recognize that \u00a7 3571(d) is an alternative\nmethod of calculating a defendant\u2019s fine and that it does not\npreclude a fine under \u00a7 3571(b)(3). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571(b)(2).\n\n\n                                  61\n\fher fine, it is clear that the district judge was stating on the record\n\nthat he had considered the requisite factors of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d)\n\nin determining the fine portion of Garrison\u2019s sentence. See 18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (listing the factors to be considered in imposing\n\nsentence). Rather than imposing the fine based on Garrison\u2019s\n\naffluence, as she contends,37 the district judge determined the fine\n\nfor Garrison\u2019s substantial fraud on the Medicare program, from\n\nwhich she and her family profited greatly and to which she pled\n\nguilty. Garrison\u2019s greed, reflected in the considerable amount of\n\nher Medicare fraud over a number of years, was the basis for her\n\nfine. The district judge assessed her ability to pay the fine in\n\n     37\n       We   reject Garrison\u2019s self-serving arguments attempting to\nshow that   the district judge based her fine on her socio-economic\nstatus as   a misrepresentation of the facts and the judge\u2019s\nreasoning   in imposing her fine:\n\n     Simply because a party engages in limited criminal\n     activity which may result in an illegal gain, it does\n     not follow that all other income from a business is not\n     legitimately earned. Clearly, the trial court\n     impermissibly increased Garrison\u2019s fine based upon the\n     wealth and socio-economic status she and her family\n     achieved through 20 years of building a business. This\n     business legitimately earned, and is entitled to\n     retain, the vast majority of its profits.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 51. The record evidence in this case shows\nthat Healthmaster predominately was funded by Medicare, which was\ndefrauded at Garrison\u2019s direction of considerable funds.\n\n\n                                   62\n\faddition to restitution as he is required to do. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7\n\n5E1.2(d)(2)-(4) (requiring a sentencing judge to consider ability to\n\npay, burden placed on dependents, and restitution before\n\ndetermining a fine amount).\n\n     Similarly, Garrison incorrectly attributes the amount of her fine\n\nto publicity or notoriety surrounding her case as being a motivating\n\nfactor for the upward departure by the district judge.38\n\nContrary to her mischaracterization of publicity as a reason for the\n\nupward departure, the judge stated at sentencing that there was\n\npublic concern regarding Medicare fraud and its impact on the\n\nMedicare program. From a punitive perspective, the judge also\n\nstated that the public would lose respect for the judicial process if a\n\ncriminal who had profited substantially from a federal health\n\n\n     38\n       Garrison\u2019s publicity argument as it relates to her fine\nis as follows:\n\n     All defendants should be sentenced fairly and equally\n     based on their conduct, not on the amount of publicity\n     that their case has generated. Sentencing decisions\n     based upon the notoriety of a particular defendant are\n     inherently unfair and contrary to the purposes of our\n     justice system. Publicity is an unreasonable basis for\n     a departure from the sentencing guidelines and should\n     not be allowed.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 49-50 (emphasis added).\n\n                                  63\n\finsurance program did not receive a commensurate sentence. In\n\ndetermining a fine, a sentencing judge is required to consider \u201cthe\n\nneed for the combined sentence to reflect the seriousness of the\n\noffense (including the harm or loss to the victim and the gain to the\n\ndefendant), to promote respect for the law, to provide just\n\npunishment and to afford adequate deterrence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7\n\n5E1.2(d)(1). Given Garrison\u2019s substantial profits over time from her\n\nMedicare fraud, the district judge did not believe that the highest\n\nSentencing Guidelines applicable fine was sufficient to punish\n\nGarrison\u2019s calculated crime that defrauded Medicare, our federal,\n\npublic health insurance program. Where the amount of loss \u201cdoes\n\nnot fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct,\n\nan upward departure may be warranted,\u201d such as when \u201cthe\n\noffense caused a loss of confidence in an important institution.\u201d\n\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, comment. (n.10)(e); see Gunby, 112 F.3d at\n\n1502 (determining that the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin departing upward in sentence after concluding that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s fraudulent schemes \u201csignificantly disrupted a\n\n\n                                  64\n\fgovernmental function\u201d). Thus, sufficient punishment for her\n\nMedicare fraud and deterrence of such conduct were behind the\n\npublic concern factor for the district judge\u2019s decision to depart\n\nupward in Garrison\u2019s fine and not publicity.\n\n     Applying the Koon analysis to the district judge\u2019s upward\n\ndeparture in Garrison\u2019s fine, we find that the judge\u2019s explanation\n\nwas compliant. The district judge enunciated at sentencing his\n\nevaluation of the factors required under the Sentencing Guidelines\n\nbefore the imposition of any fine. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d). He\n\nparticularly was impressed by the considerable amount that\n\nGarrison and those at her direction defrauded the Medicare\n\nprogram over a period of twenty years, and he carefully assessed\n\nGarrison\u2019s ability to pay the fine imposed, which she has not\n\ndisputed. For defrauding our federal health insurance program for\n\nher personal gain as well as contributions to political candidates,\n\nthe district judge determined that Garrison\u2019s criminal conduct was\n\nespecially egregious and warranted an upward departure from the\n\nhighest amount under the Guidelines range. Far from forbidding\n\n\n                                  65\n\fsuch a departure, the Sentencing Commission specifically provided\n\nfor it as U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2, comment. (4) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1,\n\ncomment. (n.10) clarify.   Significantly, the $2,500,000 fine also\n\nwas available under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571(b) (3), which permits a fine\n\nof $250,000 per felony for a defendant. Furthermore, Garrison\u2019s\n\nargument that her restitution amount precluded her sizeable fine is\n\nunavailing because she agreed in her plea agreement to pay\n\n$11,500,000 in restitution as well as a fine to be determined by the\n\ndistrict judge. Accordingly, we conclude that the district judge did\n\nnot abuse his discretion in departing upward in Garrison\u2019s fine.\n\n                           III. CONCLUSION\n\n     In this appeal from her Medicare fraud sentence, Garrison\n\nargues that her sentence should not have been enhanced for\n\nabuse of a position of trust and role in the offense. She also\n\ncontends that she did not have sufficient notice concerning the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s upward departure in her fine and that the amount\n\nwas unjustified. The district court appropriately enhanced\n\nGarrison\u2019s sentence for her aggravating role in the offense and her\n\n\n                                  66\n\ffine was not an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, we VACATE\n\nGarrison\u2019s sentence because the enhancement for abuse of a\n\nposition of trust was improper, as we have explained herein.\n\nAccordingly, we REMAND for resentencing with instructions that\n\nthe district court eliminate the enhancement for abuse of a position\n\nof public trust.\n\n\n\n\n                                 67\n\f",
