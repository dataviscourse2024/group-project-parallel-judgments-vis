            "opinion_text": "\nSOMERVILLE, Judge.\nDefendant was charged in a three-count indictment with rape, robbery in the first degree, and assault with intent to kill with a deadly weapon with malice aforethought. Having waived a jury, the offenses for which defendant stood charged were tried to the court. At the close of all the evidence the state elected to dismiss counts one (rape) and two (robbery in the first degree) of the indictment and the case was submitted to the court solely under count three of the indictment, assault with intent to kill with a deadly weapon with malice aforethought (Section 559.180, RSMo 1969).\nThe court entered a verdict finding defendant guilty under count three of the indictment. After a pre-sentence investigation, his punishment was fixed at thirty years confinement in the custody of the Missouri Department of Corrections.1 Allo-cution was afforded, and judgment was rendered and sentence pronounced and entered accordingly.\nOn appeal, the brief filed on defendant\u2019s behalf by appointed counsel raises only one claim of error: \u201cThe court erred in overruling the motion to suppress defendant\u2019s written confession because it was taken after defendant had invoked his fifth amendment privilege not to incriminate himself and under the totality of circumstances derogated rights guaranteed to defendant by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\u201d Defendant, however, apparently concluding that *845the brief filed by appointed counsel failed to raise all viable issues, filed four pro se briefs. Read in conjunction with each other, the pro se briefs appear to raise three additional claims of error which may be paraphrased as follows: (1) The verdict returned by the trial court did not find defendant guilty of an offense proscribed by Section 559.180, RSMo 1969, because it failed to include the word \u201caforethought\u201d after the word \u201cmalice\u201d, and, therefore it was a verdict finding him guilty of an offense proscribed by Section 559.190, RSMo 1969, which carries a maximum punishment of five years imprisonment; 2 (2) Prosecution of defendant under Section 559.180, supra, rather than for \u201cattempted murder\u201d, violated his constitutionally guaranteed rights of \u201cdue process and equal protection\u201d because the maximum punishment prescribed by Section 559.180, supra, exceeded the maximum punishment prescribed in paragraph (2) of Section 556.150, RSMo 1969, the general \u201cattempt\u201d statute; and (3) The imposed sentence of thirty years confinement in the custody of the Missouri Department of Corrections resulted from the trial court\u2019s improper consideration of the other charges leveled against the defendant which were subsequently dismissed at the close of all the evidence, and was otherwise excessive.\nThe four pro se briefs referred to were intermittently filed by defendant without leave of court over a period of approximately ten months, the fourth and final one having been filed on the day the case was argued before and submitted to this court on appeal. All but one were untimely filed. With respect to those filed out of time, defendant made no attempt to have them considered by invoking Rule 84.-08.3 This court is being confronted with a steady progression of instances of accuseds in criminal cases on appeal filing pro se briefs even though their counsel of record have already filed briefs. Understandably, the pro se briefs which are filed rarely comply with the rules governing appellate procedure and, in many instances, infuse the respective appeals with elements of confusion. Appellate courts faced with this situation are placed in the incongruous position of either summarily rejecting such briefs for noncompliance with the rules, thereby giving the appearance of arbitrarily disregarding the rights of those seeking redress before them, or of expending an inordinate amount of time attempting to draw some semblance of meaning from them. In those instances where appellate courts, out of conscience, yield to the latter course, the entire appellate process is reined to almost a complete standstill because of the expenditure of time usually required to ferret out and understand the issues sought to be raised. Time and experience have taught that the administration of justice is best served by adherence to procedural requirements and rules. When procedural requirements and rules are lightly ignored, confusion is most often the result, and if justice then emerges it is more by chance than by design. Pro se briefs in criminal cases filed out of time without leave of court, and which bear little or no resemblance to compliance with appellate procedural requirements and rules, in most instances, confuse rather than aid the appellate process. Unrestrained consideration of them tends to place meaningful appellate consideration of criminal appeals in serious jeopardy. Although this court, with great reluctance, has concluded to review the issues raised by defendant in his pro se briefs for the simple reason that existing case law prevails to support a ready disposition of *846them, a caveat is sounded with respect to entertaining issues sought to be raised in future criminal appeals by pro se briefs which fail to comply with appellate procedural requirements and rules. If accuseds in criminal appeals represented by counsel insist on representing themselves separate and apart from the efforts of counsel of record, then they must abide by and be bound by the same procedural requirements and rules imposed on counsel and stand ready to suffer the same consequences for noncompliance.\nNotwithstanding his contention that the verdict returned by the trial court did not find him guilty of an offense proscribed by Section 559.180, supra, defendant does not question the sufficiency of the evidence to support a verdict for violation of said statute. Therefore, a brief summary of the evidence will suffice. Defendant entered the victim\u2019s home at approximately 11:00 P.M. on the night of May 12, 1974, commenced hitting her with his fists and told her, \u201cI intend to kill you.\u201d After a lapse of time, defendant then picked up a telephone and unmercifully beat the victim into a state of unconsciousness. According to the victim, just before she lapsed into unconsciousness, the defendant tore her robe off and \u201cstuck his penis in [her].\u201d The vicious beating administered by defendant broke the victim\u2019s arm in two places, her jaw in two places, and inflicted cuts \u201call over\u201d her face and head requiring innumerable stitches. A written confession made by defendant, which was offered and admitted into evidence, corroborated certain portions of the victim\u2019s testimony.\nIn order to place defendant\u2019s first claim of error in proper dispositional context, it is necessary to review the evidence adduced in connection with his motion to suppress. Defendant was arrested at approximately 2:80 the following morning at his place of abode. He was taken to \u201cpolice headquarters\u201d of the Kansas City, Missouri, Police Department at 1125 Locust Street. The record is silent as to when he arrived at \u201cpolice headquarters\u201d. Sometime after his arrest, and more precisely at approximately 4:20 A.M., a detective on the police force removed defendant from the \u201cjail\u201d on the eighth floor of \u201cpolice headquarters\u201d and took him to the second floor for the \u201cpurpose\u201d of \u201cinterrogating\u201d him. Two detectives on the police force conducted the interrogation. Prior to any interrogation, defendant was handed a printed \u201cMiranda\u201d warning and asked if he could read. Defendant replied that he could and then proceeded to read the printed \u201cMiranda\u201d warning. After defendant read the printed \u201cMiranda\u201d warning he was asked if he understood it and he replied that he did. The printed \u201cMiranda\u201d warning which was handed to and read by defendant, and which he stated he understood, contained a place for him to sign indicating a waiver of his rights explained therein. Defendant did not sign the printed \u201cMiranda\u201d warning, and, according to one of the detectives present, gave the following reason for not doing so: \u201cHe stated he understood his rights, but he just didn\u2019t want to sign any type of report at that time.\u201d Defendant at no time ever requested to contact or have an attorney present. Notwithstanding his refusal to sign the written waiver on the printed \u201cMiranda\u201d warning, the record bears out that almost immediately thereafter defendant \u201cwas willing to talk\u201d and did talk to the two detectives regarding the offense for which he had been arrested. According to the record, during this stage of the interrogation, both of the detectives kept stressing to defendant \u201cthat he could have an attorney if he wished\u201d, \u201cthat he didn\u2019t have to make any statement\u201d, and \u201cthat he didn\u2019t have to talk to [them] if he didn\u2019t want to.\u201d Throughout this portion of the interrogation, defendant \u201cwouldn\u2019t give [the detectives] too many facts, but he was willing to talk with [them].\u201d After passage of a brief period of time defendant interrupted the questioning and advised the two detectives that he would like to talk to a \u201cfriend\u201d before talking any more with them. Defendant\u2019s request was honored and all questioning ceased at that time. The \u201cfriend\u201d with whom defendant wished *847to talk was a gentleman by the name of Russell Dupree. Mr. Dupree, who was contacted by one of the detectives, arrived at \u201cpolice headquarters\u201d sometime after 5:00 A.M. Defendant, in an isolated place, conversed with Mr. Dupree for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes. Immediately after concluding his conversation with Mr. Dupree, defendant advised the two detectives that \u201che was willing to give [them] a statement in regard to the offense that [they] were questioning him about.\u201d However, before proceeding to interrogate defendant further, one of the two detectives again informed defendant of his rights per Miranda. After receiving his additional \u201cMiranda\u201d warning, defendant proceeded to orally relate to the interrogating officers his participation in the events which precipitated his arrest. During the course of doing so, one of the detectives again gave defendant a \u201cMiranda\u201d warning. Throughout the course of the interrogation defendant\u2019s behavior was described by the detectives as \u201cnormal\u201d. On the other hand, Russell Dupree, who was produced as a witness at the hearing by defendant, testified that when he talked with defendant at police headquarters he had an \u201canguished\u201d look on his face and his conversation was sometimes difficult to \u201cfollow logically\u201d. The trial court obviously resolved this evidentia-ry conflict in favor of the state. The information which defendant orally related to the detectives on this latter occasion was reduced to writing and signed by defendant at approximately 7:80 A.M.\nFrom the tenor of his argument, defendant\u2019s first claim of error appears to hang on the meaning to be drawn from certain language isolated by him from Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 473, 474, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1627, 1628, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 723 (1966):\n\u201cIf the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. At this point he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise.\u201d\nUsing the above as a contentional point of origin, defendant argues that his refusal to sign the waiver portion of the \u201cMiranda\u201d warning which was handed to him conclusively \u201cindicated\u201d that he wished to remain silent and any statement secured thereafter from him could not \u201cbe other than the product of compulsion.\u201d\nDefendant\u2019s argument emphasizes form over fact. The mechanical approach advocated by defendant is patently fallacious. If refusal to sign a written waiver conclusively indicates that an interrogee is claiming his constitutional right to remain silent, then, by the same logic, it could be argued with equal force that execution of a written waiver conclusively indicates that an interrogee is foregoing his constitutional right to remain silent. The inherent danger of emphasizing form over fact thus emerges with unmistakable clarity. The utilization of printed \u201cMiranda\u201d warnings and companion waiver forms by law enforcement personnel should be viewed for what it actually is \u2014 an effort to document their investigative file with written indicia that a \u201cMiranda\u201d warning was given and the interrogee waived the right to remain silent. But the existence of such documentations is by no means conclusive. As pointed out in Miranda v. Arizona, supra, 384 U.S. at 492, 86 S.Ct. at 1637, \u201c[t]he mere fact that he signed a statement which contained a typed-in clause stating that he had \u2018full knowledge\u2019 of his \u2018legal rights\u2019 does not approach the knowing and intelligent waiver required to relinquish constitutional rights.\u201d Both sides of the proposition are succinctly stated in United States v. Hayes, 385 F.2d 375, 377 (4th Cir. 1967), cert. denied 390 U.S. 1006, 88 S.Ct. 1250, 20 L.Ed.2d 106 (1968): \u201cJust as the mere signing of a boilerplate statement to the effect that a defendant is knowingly waiving his rights will not discharge the government\u2019s burden, so the mere absence of such a statement will not preclude as a matter of law *848the possibility of an effective waiver.\u201d Fact prevails over form, not form over fact. Therefore, as noted in United States v. McDaniel, 463 F.2d 129, 135 (5th Cir. 1972), it becomes necessary to look at all the circumstances surrounding the interrogation to ascertain whether defendant\u2019s refusal to sign a waiver demonstrated that he was unwilling to forego his constitutional right to remain silent. The Supreme Court of Missouri in State v. Auger, 434 S.W.2d 1, 5, 6 (Mo.1968), implicitly advanced and adhered to the above composite principle. In Auger, the accused, after being given a \u201cMiranda\u201d warning, declined to sign a waiver of his rights and, by way of explanation, stated \u201cthat his attorney had always told him not to sign anything\u201d. However, his declination to sign a waiver was followed, \u201calmost immediately\u201d, with the statement that \u201che didn\u2019t mind talking about it.\u201d A contention identical to the one here advanced by defendant was rejected by the court, and it proceeded to review the attendant facts and circumstances disclosed by the record in order to determine whether the interrogee\u2019s refusal to sign the waiver indicated that he had chosen to stand mute. After doing so, the court concluded that the interrogee had voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent and that the confession obtained from him was otherwise free of any taint of coercion or duress. Defendant attempts to distinguish Auger from the instant case in two respects: (1) unlike the interrogee in Auger, he did not, \u201calmost immediately\u201d following his refusal to sign the waiver, affirmatively state that he \u201cdidn\u2019t mind talking about it\u201d; and (2) unlike the inter-rogee in Auger, he was interrogated in the early hours of the morning and after a considerable period of time had elapsed following his refusal to sign the waiver. Defendant\u2019s first attempt to distinguish this case from Auger, to say the least, is superficial. In legal contemplation it is difficult to perceive any practical distinction between the statement made by the interrogee in Auger that he \u201cdidn\u2019t mind talking about it\u201d and the record disclosure here that defendant, almost immediately following his refusal to sign a written waiver, was \u201cwilling to talk\u201d to the two interrogating officers and did in fact do so. Defendant\u2019s other attempt to distinguish the two cases is unpersuasive. Although defendant made no inculpatory statements until after he counseled with his friend Russell Dupree, the interrogation commenced shortly after his refusal to sign the waiver in view of his willingness to talk. Defendant has failed to produce any authority, and this court knows of none, holding that his interrogation during the early morning hours ipso facto proves that he did not voluntarily waive his right to remain silent. At best, it was but one of a number of factors to be weighed in proper perspective.\nDefendant does not contend that he was not advised of his rights per Miranda. A reasonable explanation for his refusal to sign the waiver, particularly in view of his almost immediate willingness thereafter to talk to the investigating officers, lies in the oft recognized innate reluctance of people to \u201cput pen to paper\u201d.\nWhen all of the circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s custodial interrogation are viewed in their entirety, they stand to support the trial court\u2019s admission of defendant\u2019s confession \u2014 defendant was given the full panoply of rights required by Miranda, not only at the outset, but several times during the overall course of his interrogation; he voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent; his waiver of his right to remain silent was not the product of coercion or duress; his right to cut off interrogation was scrupulously honored; and further interrogation thereafter was voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently initiated by him, again absent coercion or duress. The time of defendant\u2019s arrest, and the passage of a reasonable amount of time to book and process him, suggest that his interrogation chronologically occurred during the ordinary sequence of events that followed his apprehension. Although his interrogation may at first blush appear to have been somewhat *849protracted, it is readily explained by the record in view of defendant\u2019s request to cut off further interrogation until he consulted and conferred with his friend, Russell Du-pree. At the time, Dupree was working as a security guard for a business concern located some ten blocks from \u201cpolice headquarters\u201d. Dupree had to be located, come to police headquarters, and then afforded an adequate opportunity to consult with defendant. Although never raised by defendant, resumption of the interrogation after he talked with his friend Russell Du-pree does not appear to have any constitutionally impermissible overtones in view of the recently decided case of Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96, 96 S.Ct. 321, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975).\nDefendant cites and places great emphasis on People v. Fioritto, 68 Cal.2d 714, 68 Cal.Rptr. 817, 441 P.2d 625 (1968), to support his claim that his written confession was extracted after he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. A careful reading of People v. Fioritto, supra, discloses that the court, in a decidedly cryptic manner, held that the mere refusal by an interrogee to sign a written waiver of his rights per Miranda, regardless of attendant facts and circumstances, was tantamount to a positive invocation of the right to remain silent. Form rather than fact was accentuated. The logic and reason which cut the template in State v. Auger, supra, underscores fact as opposed to form. The underlying rationale of State v. Auger, supra, also prevails in a number of other jurisdictions. See: State v. Cashaw, 4 Wash.App. 243, 480 P.2d 528 (1971); State v. Carpenter, 211 Kan. 234, 505 P.2d 753 (1973); United States v. Hayes, supra; United States v. McDaniel, supra; United States v. Devall, 462 F.2d 137 (5th Cir. 1972); United States v. Biondo, 483 F.2d 635 (8th Cir. 1973); United States v. Sawyer, 504 F.2d 878 (5th Cir. 1974); and United States v. Reynolds, 496 F.2d 158 (6th Cir. 1974).\nHaving concluded that the trial court did not err in admitting defendant\u2019s written confession into evidence, attention now turns to the claims of error raised by defendant in his pro se briefs.\nThe verdict rendered by the trial court reads as follows: \u201cSo the Court has no hesitation, and does find, the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the charge as made in Count III, Assault with Intent to Kill With a Deadly Weapon with Malice.\u201d Defendant takes the position that the verdict did not find him guilty of violating Section 559.180, supra, and, therefore, the punishment which the court imposed, being the higher range prescribed by Section 559.180, supra, was unlawful. The crux of defendant\u2019s position being that since the word \u201cmalice\u201d in the verdict was not followed by the word \u201caforethought\u201d, the trial court, in fact, found him guilty of an offense proscribed by Section 559.190, supra, and the sentence imposed exceeded the permissible maximum range of punishment. Defendant relies on State v. Mathis, 427 S.W.2d 450 (Mo.1968), and correctly points out that the court therein distinguished \u201cmalice\u201d and \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d and held that \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d, as opposed to \u201cmalice\u201d, was an essential elementof an offense charged under Section 559.180. This court expressly refrains from explicating the finely spun distinction between \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d and \u201cmalice\u201d because it is unnecessary to do so in order to dispose of this point. State v. Johnson, 461 S.W.2d 724, 727 (Mo.1971), is recommended reading for those interested in the legally drawn line of demarcation between \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d and \u201cmalice\u201d and the subtleties distinguishing them. Cook v. State, 511 S.W.2d 877 (Mo.App.1974), incisively disposes of this point adversely to defendant. In Cook, the movant in a Rule 27.26 motion urged that the sentence pronounced upon him (fifteen years) exceeded the maximum permitted by statute, since the following verdict returned by the jury which tried him found him guilty of an offense proscribed by Section 559.190, supra, rather than an offense proscribed by Section 559.180: \u201cWe, the jury in the above *850entitled cause, find the defendant guilty of Assault with Intent to do Great Bodily Harm with Malice, as charged.\u201d The mov-ant, comparable to the tack here taken by defendant, argued that the verdict necessarily had to be construed as finding him guilty of assault with malice and not assault with malice aforethought. The Missouri Court of Appeals, St. Louis District, rejected movant\u2019s attack on the verdict. After noting that \u201cthe controlling object is to learn the intent of the jury\u201d, and in ascertaining the jury\u2019s intent their verdict \u201cshould be liberally construed\u201d and should not be tested \u201cby technical rules of construction\u201d, the court looked at the pleadings and instructions to discover the jury\u2019s intent. Since the substituted information under which movant was tried clearly charged him with an assault with malice aforethought and the instructions to the jury posited a verdict of guilty upon a finding by them beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault was committed with malice aforethought, the court held that the verdict returned by the jury should and would be construed as finding movant guilty of an assault in violation of Section 559.180, supra, and, accordingly, the fifteen year sentence imposed was within the permissible maximum statutory range.\nThis court, in the context of defendant\u2019s point, fails to see any valid distinction between a verdict in a jury tried case and a verdict in a court tried case. Count III of the indictment under which defendant was charged and found guilty alleged facts charging him with assault with intent to kill with a deadly weapon with malice aforethought, and, more specifically, referred three times to the assault as having been committed with \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d and never once used \u201cmalice\u201d alone. The verdict returned by the trial judge found \u201cdefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the charge as made in Count III.\u201d Moreover, the able trial judge, before rendering the controversial verdict, remarked, as a matter of record, that if defendant were being tried by a jury MAI-CR 6.22(b)4 would be the required and appropriate verdict directing instruction. The verdict which defendant faults does not have to be tortuously construed to arrive at the conclusion that the trial judge intended to and did find defendant guilty of assault within the purview of Section 599.180, supra. Whatever explanation there may be for the inadvertent omission of the word \u201caforethought\u201d following the word \u201cmalice\u201d in the formal verdict, the omission did not render the verdict defective. The verdict is not rife with doubt since it explicitly finds defendant guilty as charged in Count III of the indictment, and the remarks made by the trial judge with reference to MAI-CR 6.22(b) convincingly demonstrate that his use of the term \u201cmalice\u201d in the formal verdict had all the connotations of \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d. For reasons stated, the point just addressed fails to afford defendant any relief.\nDefendant\u2019s contention that his prosecution under Section 559.180, supra, rather then for \u201cattempted murder\u201d, violated his constitutionally guaranteed rights of \u201cdue process and equal protection\u201d because the maximum punishment prescribed for said offense exceeded the maximum punishment prescribed in paragraph (2) of Section 556.150, supra, the general \u201cattempt\u201d statute, was met and answered adversely to defendant in Turnbough v. State, 533 S.W.2d 609, 613 (Mo.App.1975) appl. to transfer denied March 8, 1976: \u201c\u00a7 559.180 defines the crime of assault with intent to kill; it does not come within the purview of the attempt statute; it promulgates a distinct crime and is complete in itself.\u201d\nDefendant\u2019s remaining contention is twofold \u2014 (1) that the trial court improperly *851considered the subsequently dismissed charges in fixing his sentence at thirty years confinement, and (2) that said sentence was otherwise excessive. However viewed, it lacks merit. The first aspect of defendant\u2019s remaining contention stands unsupported by the record. Moreover, the basic tenet that a trial judge is justified in taking into account the nature and circumstances of the offense for which a defendant has been found guilty when determining and fixing sentence, State v. Cline, 452 S.W.2d 190, 195 (Mo.1970) rev\u2019d on other grounds; State v. Burton, 355 Mo. 792, 198 S.W.2d 19, 22 (1946), would be substantially eroded if the position advanced by defendant prevails where, as here, it rests on nothing more than mere supposition. The other aspect of defendant\u2019s remaining contention, that the sentence imposed was excessive, was met and answered adversely to defendant in State v. Kennedy, 513 S.W.2d 697, 701 (Mo.App.1974), where the same argument was made concerning the imposition of a one hundred year sentence upon an accused convicted of violating Section 559.180, supra: \u201cA sentence within statutory limits is not, as a matter of law, excessive or cruel and unusual. Garrett v. State, supra [486 S.W.2d 272, 274 (Mo.1974)]. This is particularly so when brutality accompanies the offense, as it does here. A long sentence is appropriate and consequently the punishment imposed was not erroneous. State v. Agee, 474 S.W.2d 817[14] (Mo.1971).\u201d\nThe offense for which defendant was tried, found guilty and sentenced was permeated with brutality to an unconscionable degree. Perforce, the thirty year sentence imposed upon defendant cannot be said to be excessive.\nJudgment affirmed.\nAll concur.\n\n. The prescribed punishment for violating Section 559.180, RSMo 1969, being \u201c . . . imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than two years.\u201d\n\n\n. The prescribed punishment for violating Section 559.190, RSMo 1969, being \u201c . . imprisonment in the penitentiary not exceeding five years, or in the county jail not less than six months, or by a fine not less than one hundred dollars and imprisonment in the county jail not less than three months, or by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars.\u201d\n\n\n. This court believes that where, as here, an accused is represented by counsel who has already filed a brief on his behalf, cause should be shown and leave of court obtained by an accused wishing to file an additional brief.\n\n\n.
