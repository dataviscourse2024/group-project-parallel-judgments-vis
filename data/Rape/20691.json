Jeffries appeals the district court\u2019s denial\nof his petition for habeas corpus seeking to overturn his conviction for murder and attempted rape\nbased on evidence discovered subsequent to trial that implicates another person, John Dillon, in the\ncrime. The issues on appeal are whether the district court erred in holding that: (1) upholding the\nKentucky Supreme Court\u2019s decision that the evidence introduced at trial was sufficient to support\na conviction; (2) affirming the Kentucky Court of Appeals\u2019 decision that the Commonwealth\u2019s\n\n        *\n         The Honorable Louis F. Oberdorfer, Senior United States District Judge for the District of Columbia, sitting\nby designation.\n\n\n                                                         1\n\fNo. 06-5726                        Jeffries v. Morgan                                          Page 2\n\n\nfailure to turn over the limited information it had about Dillon to the defense did not give rise to a\nBrady v. Maryland claim; and (3) denying as moot Jeffries\u2019 motion to expand the record and compel\nthe Commonwealth to produce the transcripts of the trial. We now find that the district court erred\nin denying Jeffries\u2019 motion to expand the record. Therefore, we VACATE the district court\u2019s denial\nof habeas corpus, REVERSE the denial of Jeffries\u2019 motion to expand the record, and REMAND\nwith instructions that the district court review the entire available record in assessing Jeffries\u2019\npetition.\n                                                  I.\n                                      A. Factual Background\n                                    1. Trial and Direct Appeal\n       The Kentucky Supreme Court summarized the evidence presented at trial as follows:\n               On February 20, 1995, Mary McKee left her house for a walk and never\n       returned. The next day, her housekeeper became alarmed when Mrs. McKee failed\n       to answer her door. The housekeeper contacted a neighbor. A search was conducted\n       and Mrs. McKee\u2019s body was discovered in a yard between two houses. Her\n       pantyhose and panties had been removed, her longish skirt was hiked up to her\n       mid-thigh, and her blouse was ripped partially open. Blood was splattered on a\n       nearby wall and teeth fragments were scattered near the body. There were smeared\n       fingerprints on Mrs. McKee\u2019s right thigh and buttocks. According to the medical\n       examiner, Mrs. McKee was beaten to death, apparently with the bloody rocks found\n       near her body. Further, the medical examiner testified that Mrs. McKee did not die\n       immediately from the beating but probably expired some twenty minutes thereafter.\n               On February 27, 1995, Jeffries was questioned by the police about Mrs.\n       McKee\u2019s murder and turned over the clothes he was wearing on the day of the\n       murder. Tests revealed the presence of blood on his jacket, sole of his shoe, and\n       inside the tongue of his right shoe. There was no identification as to whom the blood\n       on his jacket and the sole of his shoe belonged or whether it was even human blood.\n       However, the blood found on the inside of the tongue of Jeffries\u2019 shoe was positively\n       identified as Mrs. McKee\u2019s. Further, a palm print on Mrs. McKee\u2019s glasses, which\n       were found next to her body, was positively identified as belonging to Jeffries.\n       Finally, witnesses testified that they saw Jeffries in the general area where Mrs.\n       McKee\u2019s body was found.\n               Upon questioning, Jeffries denied all knowledge of the crime. However,\n       when he took the stand, he testified that he had lied to the police when they\n       questioned him. Contrary to his earlier statements, he testified that on the evening\n       of the murder he had been cutting through the yard in question and had tripped over\n       a body. He testified that he could not even identify the gender of the body. He ran\n       away because he was scared. He never checked on the well-being of the person he\n       tripped over. He did not tell his mother or his father about tripping over the body,\n       apparently because his parents were mad at him and telling them would require a\n       confession that he had been drinking that day.\n        Also introduced at trial were the results of a forensic examination, which discovered a hair\nmatching neither Jeffries nor McKee inside her underpants and fibers on the body that did not come\nfrom either McKee\u2019s or Jeffries\u2019 clothes. On March 21, 1997, the jury convicted Jeffries based on\nthis evidence. On June 9, 1997, Jeffries was sentenced to thirty-five years in prison.\n\fNo. 06-5726                         Jeffries v. Morgan                                           Page 3\n\n\n      On direct appeal, Jeffries argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.\n On October 15, 1998, the Kentucky Supreme Court, in an unpublished opinion, rejected this\nargument and affirmed his conviction. With respect to the attempted rape charge, the court held:\n        The overt acts in this case are those that led to the discovery of Mrs. McKee on her\n        back with her undergarments removed, her skirt pushed up, her blouse torn partially\n        open, and with smeared fingerprints on her thigh and buttocks. The circumstances\n        of the case are that the brutal attack on Mrs. McKee occurred in a yard away from\n        the street, out of sight.\nConcerning the issue of the identity of the killer, the court cited the blood found on Jeffries\u2019 clothes,\nespecially the drop matching McKee\u2019s blood on the tongue of his shoe, Jeffries\u2019 palm print on her\nglasses, witness testimony placing him near the crime scene and stating that he was mud-covered,\nevidence that his clothes had been laundered, and inconsistency between Jeffries\u2019 testimony at trial\nand his statement to police as evidence of Jeffries\u2019 guilt.\n                               2. Information Discovered After Trial\n        In March 1998, Jeffries\u2019 counsel received a letter from the Kentucky Attorney General listing\nthe results of an investigation into various third-party statements that John Dillon had admitted his\ninvolvement in McKee\u2019s murder, including the following: (1) on June 10, 1997, the day after the\nsentencing, Chris Beach, at the time a prisoner in jail, told a police detective that he had in the past\nheard Joe Buck Dixon refer to Dillon as a rapist and that he, Tyrus Beach, and Annette Clark heard\nDillon tell a girl named Tammy: \u201cThe old lady kept screaming. When he got done I was going to\ntake my turn. She kept screaming. I had to kill the old bitch.\u201d; (2) on or about June 12, 1997, Linda\nRaisor told a detective that Pocahontas Biggers (Dillon\u2019s aunt) had told her three months ago that\nDillon had admitted murdering McKee; (3) on June 24, 1997, Tiffany Solace told a sheriff\u2019s deputy\nthat Dillon killed McKee, but provided no basis for her belief; and (4) on January 22, 1998, Tammy\nand Kim Chesser told a person in a judge\u2019s office that Dillon had threatened Nikki Chesser in\nconnection with the case. None of these statements were known to the Commonwealth before\nJeffries\u2019 trial.\n         On June 9, 1998, in response to this letter, Jeffries moved for a new trial in the trial court\nbased on newly discovered evidence. He attached two affidavits to his motion: (1) Nikki Chesser\u2019s\naffidavit stating that Dillon admitted killing McKee and threatened Chesser not to tell anyone about\nit; and (2) Beach\u2019s affidavit that he overheard Dillon publicly declare his involvement in a killing,\nstating \u201cI don\u2019t remember if he said I did not mean to kill her or we did not mean to kill her. But\nafter that he was real scared and crying.\u201d\n         A detective Pratt interviewed Dillon after Jeffries\u2019 trial concerning these allegations. During\nthis interview, Dillon stated that he was with a girlfriend at the time of the killings. Pratt testified\nat a hearing on the motion for a new trial that Dillon told him the girlfriend\u2019s name was Jessica\nPeyton. Peyton testified before a grand jury that she was 11 years old at the time of McKee\u2019s\nmurder, did not live in the county where the murder occurred at the time of the offense, was never\nromantically involved with Dillon, and was not with him at the time of the offense.\n         Jeffries presented two legal theories concerning why this new evidence warranted a new trial.\nFirst, he argued that the evidence discovered and disclosed by the Commonwealth after trial and\nevidence that the defense might discover after additional investigation made it reasonably certain\nthat a new trial would have a different result. Second, he argued, based on counsel\u2019s understanding\nat that time that the Commonwealth knew that third parties had heard Dillon claim responsibility\nfor the killing before the trial, that the Commonwealth had failed to turn over exculpatory evidence\nto Jeffries in violation of his rights under Brady. During discovery on this motion, the situation was\n\fNo. 06-5726                        Jeffries v. Morgan                                            Page 4\n\n\nclarified: the Commonwealth had not known before the trial about the third-party accounts of\nDillon\u2019s statements, but it had failed to turn over some information about Dillon that it did possess\nbefore trial.\n         The Commonwealth had briefly investigated Dillon soon after the murder. A probation\nofficer had spotted Dillon with a white teenager (not Jeffries) 7/10ths of a mile from where the body\nwas found about half an hour before the crime was committed. Detective Rick Barbiarz interviewed\nDillon, who claimed that he was with his girlfriend at the time of the killing. There is no record that\nanyone ever checked on Dillon's alibi. Based on Dillon\u2019s statements and the statement of his\ngrandmother that she was keeping Dillon on a \u201ctight leash,\u201d Barbiarz cleared Dillon as a suspect.\nIn the motion hearing, Babiarz testified that he did not consider Dillon a suspect and that he was not\nsure if the interview had been taped.\n         Before the trial, Jeffries\u2019 counsel requested a list of all individuals the police questioned\nduring the investigation, including all related notes and recordings. In its response to this request,\nthe Commonwealth failed to include the information about Dillon in the list of suspects it had\ncleared. Jeffries thus modified the theory of his Brady claim, arguing that the information the\nCommonwealth had about Dillon pretrial was exculpatory, because it would have led the defense\nto discover the witnesses to Dillon\u2019s statements admitting to the murder and weaknesses in Dillon\u2019s\nalibi, all of which would have strengthened Jeffries\u2019 defense that he had stumbled across the body\nafter the killing. The trial court denied the motion for a new trial, and, on October 17, 2003, the\nKentucky Court of Appeals affirmed. In addressing the Brady claim, the court stated that\n       If the exculpatory evidence was available to the prosecution before the trial, we\n       would have no reluctance in reversing and remanding for a new trial. . . . What we\n       have in the current situation is the suppression of the name and interview of a suspect\n       before trial. Neither the name nor the results of the interview are in themselves\n       exculpatory. This case is similar to Wood v. Bartholomew, wherein the Supreme\n       Court quoted (with approval) the Federal District Court\u2019s analysis of the suppressed\n       evidence as being not exculpatory evidence but \u201c[t]he information withheld only\n       possibly could have led to some admissible evidence.\u201d Wood, 516 U.S. [1,] 5\n       [(1995)] (emphasis in original).\n                                       B. Procedural History\n        On September 19, 2005, Jeffries filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, raising two\ngrounds: (1) the prosecutor\u2019s failure to turn over the name and alibi of a person interviewed during\nthe investigation violated his rights under Brady, and (2) the evidence introduced at trial was\ninsufficient to support a conviction.\n       On November 22, 2005, the Commonwealth moved to dismiss the petition as procedurally\ndefaulted and on the merits. The Commonwealth included the written state trial court record; this\nrecord did not include the transcript of the trial.\n       On December 22, 2005, Jeffries moved to compel production of the state trial court record.\nThe court submitted this motion to a magistrate judge for review. On February 3, 2006, the\nmagistrate judge ordered the Commonwealth to produce a list of all available transcripts and\nportions of the trial for which only video, not transcripts, were available.\n        On March 20, 2006, Jeffries moved for leave to expand the state court record. On April 11,\n2006, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation denying Jeffries\u2019 grounds for habeas\nrelief on the merits and dismissing his motion to expand the record as moot.\n\fNo. 06-5726                         Jeffries v. Morgan                                           Page 5\n\n\n        On May 2, 2006, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation\nas the opinion of the court over Jeffries\u2019 objection and entered final judgment dismissing the petition\nwith prejudice.\n        On May 30, 2006, Jeffries filed an application for certificate of appealability for the district\ncourt\u2019s denial of his Brady claim, his sufficiency of the evidence claim, and his motion to expand\nthe record. On October 17, 2006, the district court granted a certificate of appealability on the Brady\nclaim but denied the application for the other two claims.\n       On January 17, 2007, this Court expanded the certificate of appealability to include the other\ntwo claims.\n                                                   II.\n                                       A. Standard of Review\n        Our standard of review for petitions for habeas corpus relief from state-court determinations\nis governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\nHowever, because we do not reach the merits of Jeffries\u2019 petition for habeas corpus, we apply the\ntraditional standard, and review the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo, but will set aside its\nfactual findings only if clearly erroneous.\u201d Brown v. Palmer, 441 F.3d 347, 350 (6th Cir. 2006).\n                     B. Failure to Review the Entire State Court Trial Record\n         Jeffries argues that the district court erred by denying his sufficiency of the evidence and\nBrady claims without reviewing the entire record of the evidence presented at trial. Our Circuit has\nheld that \u201ca District Court must make a review of the entire state court trial transcript in habeas\ncases, and where substantial portions of that transcript were omitted before the District Court, a\nhabeas case should be remanded to the District Court for consideration in light of the full record.\u201d\nAdams v. Holland, 330 F.3d 398, 406 (6th Cir. 2003). The Commonwealth cites a much older case,\nLoveday v. Davis, for the proposition that, when the petition does not specifically challenge the\nfactual findings of the state court, the district court is not required to examine the transcript. 697\nF.2d 135, 139 (6th Cir. 1983). While we have held that Loveday is still controlling in this Circuit,\nsee Nash v. Eberlin, 437 F.3d 519, 525 (6th Cir. 2006), we have also explained that a constitutional\nsufficiency of the evidence challenge requires a careful review of the entire trial transcript by the\nhabeas court when a petitioner disagrees with the challenged state court opinion\u2019s summary of the\ntrial testimony or relevant facts, Clark v. Waller, 490 F.3d 551, 556 (6th Cir. 2007); see also Nash,\n437 F.3d at 525 (\u201cLoveday prohibits the imposition of a general rule requiring district courts to\nreview the transcript in all cases, but it also does not prevent us from remanding for such a review\nif we believe that extra information is required.\u201d).\n         We find that both Jeffries\u2019 constitutional challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence and his\nBrady challenge require a habeas court to review the entire record of the trial in order to properly\nassess his habeas petition. While the state court opinions provide a summary of the facts, Jeffries\n\u201cquarrel[s] with that summary.\u201d Clark, 490 F.3d at 556. He argues that, on direct appeal, the\nKentucky Supreme Court did not give \u201ca complete picture of the trial,\u201d and he cites evidence, such\nas the hair and fibers that matched neither Jeffries nor McKee, that \u201cmay be in the trial transcript\nbut simply was not discussed in the state court\u2019s opinion[s],\u201d Nash, 437 F.3d at 525; cf. Clark, 490\nF.3d at 555 (holding that review of the transcript is not necessary because \u201c[petitioner] does not\nquarrel with the state court\u2019s recitation of the relevant evidence, nor does he point to gaps in it\u201d).\nJeffries requested that the district court review the trial transcript below, and even the district court\nrecognized that \u201c[i]t may prove difficult to fairly evaluate Petitioner\u2019s claims without review of any\nof the state court trial record.\u201d Under these circumstances, we think it makes considerable sense for\n\fNo. 06-5726                        Jeffries v. Morgan                                          Page 6\n\n\nthe district court to examine these arguments in the light cast upon them by the entire record of\nJeffries\u2019 state court trial.\n                                                 III.\n         Having found that the district court committed reversible error by not reviewing the entire\ntrial record during its review of Jeffries\u2019 habeas petition, we need not reach the other issues raised\non appeal. Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s denial of Jeffries\u2019 petition for habeas\ncorpus, REVERSE the district court\u2019s denial of Jeffries\u2019 motion to expand the record, and REMAND\nwith instructions that the entire trial record be reviewed by the district court in assessing Jeffries\u2019\npetition.\n\f",
