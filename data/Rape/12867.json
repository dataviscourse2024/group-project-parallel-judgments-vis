The habeas court denied the petition finding that the petitioner was properly sentenced.\nUpon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the judgment of the habeas corpus court.\n\n    Tenn.

Factual Background\n\n        The record reflects that the petitioner was initially charged with four counts of rape of a child\nand that he ultimately pled guilty in the Henry County Circuit Court to a single count of incest.\nPursuant to a plea agreement, the convicting court imposed a sentence of ten years in the Tennessee\nDepartment of Corrections and ordered the petitioner to register as a sex offender in compliance\nwith Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-39-103. Based on the trial court\u2019s statements at the\nguilty plea hearing, the petitioner contends that the convicting court also sentenced him to lifetime\ncommunity supervision pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-524. He argues that\nhe received an illegal sentence because the statute neither authorizes nor requires lifetime community\nsupervision as part of a sentence for incest.\n\f        The transcript of the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea hearing reflects that the parties agreed that the\npetitioner\u2019s guilty plea required \u201clifetime supervision.\u201d The following comments with respect to\nlifetime supervision were made at the guilty plea hearing:\n\n                The Court: Does this require lifetime supervision?\n                [State]: Yes, Sir.\n                [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, we agree that it does. And I believe\n                that we agreed that it only requires thirty-five percent release\n                eligibility verses eighty-five.\n                ....\n                The Court: Upon your plea of guilty you\u2019re hereby found guilty and\n                sentenced to a term of ten years and designated a range two offender.\n                As a part of this sentence you will have to give up blood for a DNA\n                sample. You will be designated as a sex offender and subject to\n                lifetime supervision. And you will have to undergo standardized\n                treatment for sex offenders.\n\n       The judgment of conviction entered after the guilty plea hearing does not include a lifetime\ncommunity supervision requirement. To the contrary, the box on the judgment form next to the\nstatement requiring community supervision for life pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section\n39-13-524 is unchecked. Moreover, the only special conditions listed on the judgment form are the\nrequirements that the petitioner undergo standardized treatment for sex offenders and that he comply\nwith the registration requirements of Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-39-103.\n\n        The petitioner initially filed a post-conviction petition challenging the legality of the sentence\nhe received. After a hearing, the post-conviction court denied the petition because it concluded that\nthe judgment accurately reflects that the petitioner was not sentenced to lifetime community\nsupervision and because it concluded that the parties and the judge at the guilty plea hearing \u201cmost\nprobably meant that Mr. Kesterson would be required to register as a sex offender for life rather than\nbeing subjected to lifetime supervision.\u201d In its written order denying relief, the habeas corpus court\nrelied on the post-conviction court\u2019s findings.\n\n                                                  II. Analysis\n\n        Initially, we note that the determination of whether to grant habeas corpus relief is a question\nof law. Summers v. State, 212 S.W.3d 251, 255 (Tenn. 2007). As such, we will review the trial\ncourt\u2019s findings de novo without a presumption of correctness. Id. Moreover, it is the petitioner\u2019s\nburden to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cthat the sentence is void or that the\nconfinement is illegal.\u201d Wyatt v. State, 24 S.W.3d 319, 322 (Tenn. 2000).\n\n        Article I, section 15 of the Tennessee Constitution guarantees an accused the right to seek\nhabeas corpus relief. See Taylor v. State, 995 S.W.2d 78, 83 (Tenn. 1999). However, \u201c[s]uch relief\nis available only when it appears from the face of the judgment or record of the proceedings that a\n\n\n                                                   -2-\n\ftrial court was without jurisdiction to sentence a defendant or that a defendant\u2019s sentence of\nimprisonment or other restraint has expired.\u201d Wyatt, 24 S.W.3d at 322. In other words, habeas\ncorpus relief may be sought only when the judgment is void, not merely voidable. Taylor, 995\nS.W.2d at 83. \u201cA void judgment \u2018is one in which the judgment is facially invalid because the court\nlacked jurisdiction or authority to render the judgment or because the defendant\u2019s sentence has\nexpired.\u2019 We have recognized that a sentence imposed in direct contravention of a statute, for\nexample, is void and illegal.\u201d Stephenson v. Carlton, 28 S.W.3d 910, 911 (Tenn. 2000) (quoting\nTaylor, 995 S.W.2d at 83).\n\n         The judgment in the present case is facially valid, and the sentence reflected thereon is legal.\nNevertheless, the petitioner interprets the trial court\u2019s comments at the guilty plea hearing as\nrequiring lifetime community supervision pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-524.\n He argues that the sentencing hearing transcript controls when there is a conflict between it and the\njudgment entered by the trial court, see e.g., State v. Moore, 814 S.W.2d 381 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n1991), and that he therefore received an illegal sentence that voids his conviction. In essence, the\npetitioner contends that his judgment of conviction must be modified to reflect that he was sentenced\nto lifetime community supervision and that he is entitled to habeas corpus relief on the basis of the\nillegal sentence. We disagree.\n\n          The petitioner\u2019s judgment of conviction became final thirty days after its entry. State v.\nGreen, 106 S.W.3d 646, 650 (Tenn. 2003). After a judgment reflecting a legal sentence becomes\nfinal, \u201cthe only jurisdiction to amend a sentence in a manner more onerous than that initially imposed\nstems from probation violations, violations of jail or workhouse rules, or community corrections\nprogram modifications or violations\u201d or to correct a clerical error in the judgment that resulted from\nthe trial court\u2019s oversight or omission pursuant to Rule 36 of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal\nProcedure. Moore, 814 S.W.2d at 383 (citations omitted).\n\n        Under Rule 36, the court \u201cmay at any time correct clerical mistakes in judgments, orders,\nor other parts of the record, and errors in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d Tenn. R.\nCrim. P. 36. Despite the discussion of lifetime supervision during the guilty plea hearing, the incest\njudgment ultimately entered reflects a proper sentence for the petitioner\u2019s incest conviction. We do\nnot believe that the convicting court\u2019s proper imposition of a sentence that does not require lifetime\ncommunity supervision amounts to a clerical error that resulted from its oversight or omission.\n\n        Moreover, the record neither demonstrates nor has the petitioner alleged that lifetime\ncommunity supervision was a material element of the petitioner\u2019s plea agreement. In deciding\nwhether an illegal sentence renders a guilty plea and resulting conviction invalid, \u201cthe determinative\nissue is whether the plea agreement included an illegal sentence as a material element.\u201d Summers,\n212 S.W.3d at 259. If the illegal provision of the sentence was not a material element of the plea,\nthen \u201cthe illegality infects only the sentence, only the sentence is rendered void and habeas corpus\nrelief may be granted to the extent of the sentence only. In such cases, the underlying conviction\nremains intact,\u201d and the appropriate remedy is a remand for correction of the sentence. Smith v.\nLewis, 202 S.W.3d 124, 130 (Tenn. 2006).\n\n\n                                                  -3-\n\f        The judgment in the present case is facially valid, and the record reflects that the petitioner\nneither bargained for nor received an illegal sentence. Accordingly, he is not entitled to habeas\ncorpus relief.\n\n                                              III. Conclusion\n\n        Based upon the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the habeas corpus court\u2019s denial of\nthe petitioner\u2019s petition for habeas corpus relief.\n\n\n                                                               _______________________________\n                                                               NORMA McGEE OGLE, JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\f",
