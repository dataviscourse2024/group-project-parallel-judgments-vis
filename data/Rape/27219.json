Bergerson, Judge\n\n        On Petition to Transfer from the Indiana Court of Appeals,\n                              No. 19A-CR-796\n\n\n\n                           Per Curiam Opinion\nChief Justice Rush and Justice David, Justice Massa, and Justice Goff concur.\n      Justice Slaughter dissents, believing transfer should be denied.\n\fPer curiam.\n\n   Thomas K. Jackson admitted to having sexual intercourse with K.S. on\nthree occasions when she was between 21 and 23 years old, but insisted\nthe sex was consensual. The issues at trial were whether K.S., who is\n\u201cmoderately intellectually handicap[ped],\u201d could, and did, legally consent\nto sex with Jackson.\n\n  After the first trial on these charges ended in a mistrial when the jury\ncould not reach a unanimous verdict, in December 2018 a second jury\nconvicted Jackson of three counts of Level 3 felony rape.1 During the\nsentencing hearing, the prosecutor acknowledged that Jackson, then 52\nyears old, had led a law-abiding life and recommended that the court\nimpose the advisory sentence of nine years for each of the three counts.\nThe prosecutor also did not object to a split sentence with part of that time\nserved on probation. The trial court instead sentenced Jackson to\nenhanced consecutive sentences of 12 years on each count, for an executed\nsentence of 36 years. Jackson\u2019s earliest possible release date is December 3,\n2045, when he will be 79 years old.\n\n    In a divided decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed Jackson\u2019s\nconvictions and sentence. Jackson v. State, No. 19A-CR-796, 2019 WL\n7342368 (Ind. Ct. App. 2019). Judge Brown dissented as to the sentence,\nwriting that an enhanced prison term for a low-risk offender with no\ncriminal history such as Jackson \u201cdoes not reflect the goals of reformation\nor rehabilitation.\u201d Id. at *10.\n\n   Jackson petitioned for transfer, which we now grant, vacating the Court\nof Appeals decision. Ind. Appellate Rule 58(A). Jackson challenged his\nconvictions in the Court of Appeals, but on transfer argues only that\nimposing consecutive 12-year sentences was excessive absent more\nsubstantial aggravating factors.\n\n\n\n\n1Jackson was acquitted of one count of Level 3 felony rape of K.S. at his first trial, though this\nacquittal was not included in the evidence presented at the second trial.\n\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 20S-CR-315 | May 19, 2020                              Page 2 of 4\n\f   The Indiana Constitution authorizes independent appellate review and\nrevision of a trial court\u2019s sentencing decision. See IND. CONST. art. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 4,\n6; McCain v. State, 88 N.E.3d 1066, 1067 (Ind. 2018). That authority is\nimplemented through Indiana Appellate Rule 7(B), which permits this\nCourt to revise a sentence if, after due consideration of the trial court\u2019s\ndecision, the sentence is found to be inappropriate in light of the nature of\nthe offense and the character of the offender. Rule 7(B) \u201cplaces central\nfocus on the role of the trial judge, while reserving for the appellate court\nthe chance to review the matter in a climate more distant from local\nclamor.\u201d Serino v. State, 798 N.E.2d 852, 856-57 (Ind. 2003). \u201cUltimately,\nour constitutional authority to review and revise sentences boils down to\nour collective sense of what is appropriate.\u201d Taylor v. State, 86 N.E.3d 157,\n165 (Ind. 2017) (cleaned up), reh\u2019g denied.\n\n   During the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor and trial court identified\ntwo mitigating factors: Jackson\u2019s lack of criminal history and his low risk\nto reoffend as identified in the Presentence Investigation Report.\nAggravators included Jackson\u2019s violation of a position of trust and his lack\nof remorse\u2014though the trial court conceded that the latter was \u201cconsistent\nwith [Jackson\u2019s] claim of a consensual relationship.\u201d Sentencing Order at\n3. The prosecutor recommended that Jackson receive the advisory\nsentence for each charge, for a total of 27 years.\n\n   Whether a sentence should be deemed inappropriate \u201cturns on our\nsense of the culpability of the defendant, the severity of the crime, the\ndamage done to others, and myriad other factors that come to light in a\ngiven case.\u201d Cardwell v. State, 895 N.E.2d 1219, 1224 (Ind. 2008). Pursuant\nto our authority under Appellate Rule 7(B), we find that exceeding the 27-\nyear sentence the prosecutor recommended, absent more significant\naggravating factors, is inappropriate under the circumstances of this case.\n\n   Accordingly, we revise Jackson\u2019s sentence to 27 years, with seven of\nthose years suspended to probation. We summarily affirm the remainder\nof the Court of Appeals opinion, Ind. Appellate R. 58(A)(2), and remand\nto the trial court to issue a revised sentencing order consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Supreme Court | Case No. 20S-CR-315 | May 19, 2020           Page 3 of 4\n\fRush, C.J., and David, Massa, and Goff, JJ., concur.\nSlaughter, J., dissents, believing transfer should be denied.\n\n\n\nATTORNEY FOR APPELLANT\nElizabeth A.
