STANLEY, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.\n\n\nTHE LEGAL AID BUREAU OF BUFFALO, INC., BUFFALO (NICHOLAS P. DIFONZO OF\nCOUNSEL), FOR DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.\n\nLAWRENCE FRIEDMAN, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, BATAVIA (WILLIAM G. ZICKL OF\nCOUNSEL), FOR RESPONDENT.\n\n\n     Appeal from a judgment of the Genesee County Court (Robert C.\nNoonan, J.), rendered August 1, 2013. The judgment convicted\ndefendant, upon his plea of guilty, of attempted rape in the first\ndegree and rape in the second degree.\n\n     It is hereby ORDERED that the case is held, the decision is\nreserved and the matter is remitted to Genesee County Court for\nfurther proceedings in accordance with the following memorandum: On\nappeal from a judgment convicting him, upon his plea of guilty, of\nattempted rape in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 130.35 [4])\nand rape in the second degree (\u00a7 130.30 [1]), defendant contends that\nCounty Court erred in imposing an enhanced sentence based on his\nalleged violation of the conditions of the court\u2019s sentence promise.\nWe conclude that, before imposing an enhanced sentence, the court\nshould have conducted a more in-depth inquiry to determine whether\ndefendant violated the conditions of the sentence promise by failing\nto answer truthfully questions asked of him by the probation officer\nwho prepared his presentence report (PSR).\n\n     By way of background, the indictment alleged in pertinent part\nthat defendant, age 34, had sexual intercourse with two girls who were\nunder the age of 15. After several court appearances, defendant\nreached an agreement with the People whereby he pleaded guilty to rape\nin the second degree in satisfaction of the counts of the indictment\nrelating to the older victim, and attempted rape in the first degree\nin satisfaction of the counts relating to the younger victim. During\nthe plea colloquy, defendant stated under oath that he had sexual\nintercourse with both victims.\n\n     In return for defendant\u2019s plea, the court, consistent with the\nplea agreement, promised to sentence defendant to a determinate term\nof imprisonment of ten years plus a period of postrelease supervision\n\f                                 -2-                           463\n                                                         KA 13-01457\n\nfor rape in the second degree, and to a lesser concurrent term of\nimprisonment for attempted rape in the first degree. Prior to\naccepting defendant\u2019s plea, however, the court stated that its\nsentence promise was conditioned upon defendant, among other things,\ncooperating with the probation department \u201cin the preparation\u201d of a\nPSR and truthfully answering any questions asked of him \u201cin that\nprocess.\u201d \u201c[I]f you fail to keep any of those promises to me,\u201d the\ncourt advised defendant, \u201cyour guilty plea will stand, but the promise\nof a ten-year cap and the promise of concurrent sentences would be\ngone.\u201d\n\n     During his interview with the probation officer assigned to\nprepare the PSR, defendant admitted that he had sexual intercourse\nwith the older victim. With respect to the younger victim, defendant\nstated that he attempted to have sexual intercourse with her as well\nbut that, after touching her breasts, he stopped because he could tell\nfrom her body language that she did not wish to go further. At the\nrequest of the probation officer, defendant went to a sex offender\ntreatment facility to obtain a sex offender evaluation and risk\nassessment. During his interview with a social worker at the\ntreatment facility, defendant again admitted that he had sexual\nintercourse with the older victim but initially denied having sexual\nintercourse with the younger victim. Upon further questioning,\nhowever, defendant eventually admitted that he had sexual intercourse\nwith both victims, as he stated during the plea colloquy.\n\n     When defendant appeared for sentencing, the prosecutor asked the\ncourt to impose the promised sentence. Following an off-the-record\nconference at the bench, however, the prosecutor asked the court to\nimpose an enhanced sentence of imprisonment of 15 years, contending\nthat defendant violated the conditions of the sentence promise by\nlying to the probation officer when he said that he merely touched the\nyounger victim\u2019s breasts, and lying to the social worker by initially\ndenying that he had sexual intercourse with her. Following a brief\nadjournment, the court concluded that defendant violated the\nconditions of the sentence promise by lying to the probation officer\nand deceiving the officer \u201cinto thinking that there was only one\nvictim of serious sexual intrusion and not two.\u201d The court sentenced\ndefendant to consecutive determinate terms of imprisonment amounting\nto 22 years, plus a period of postrelease supervision.\n\n     As a preliminary matter, we note that, although defendant\neffected a valid waiver of the right to appeal, a \u201cgeneral waiver of\nthe right to appeal does not foreclose review of the defendant\u2019s\ncontention that his [postplea] conduct did not warrant an enhanced\nsentence\u201d (People v Patterson, 106 AD3d 757, 757, lv denied 21 NY3d\n1018; see People v Faulkner, 54 AD3d 1134, 1135, lv denied 11 NY3d\n854). Moreover, with respect to preservation, because the court was\n\u201caware of, and expressly decided, the [issue] raised on appeal\u201d\n(People v Collins, 106 AD3d 1544, 1546, lv denied 21 NY3d 1072\n[internal quotation marks omitted]; see People v Hawkins, 11 NY3d 484,\n493), we conclude that defendant\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s imposition\nof the enhanced sentence is properly before us notwithstanding defense\ncounsel\u2019s failure to object to the enhanced sentence.\n\f                                 -3-                           463\n                                                         KA 13-01457\n\n     With respect to the merits, \u201c[i]t is well established that the\nviolation of an explicit and objective . . . condition[ of a sentence\npromise] that was accepted by the defendant can result in the\nimposition of an enhanced sentence\u201d (People v Becker, 80 AD3d 795,\n796; see People v Hicks, 98 NY2d 185, 189). In addition, \u201ca failure\nto abide by a condition of a [sentence promise] to truthfully answer\nquestions asked by the probation department is an appropriate basis\nfor the enhancement of the defendant\u2019s sentence\u201d (Patterson, 106 AD3d\nat 757; see Hicks, 98 NY2d at 189; People v Mazyck, 117 AD3d 1084,\n1085, lv denied 23 NY3d 1064).\n\n     Here, the court did not find that defendant lied during his\ninterview with the social worker who prepared the sex offender\nevaluation and risk assessment instrument. Thus, even assuming,\narguendo, that defendant\u2019s statements to the social worker constitute\na violation of the conditions of the court\u2019s sentence promise, as the\nPeople contend, the court did not decide that issue adversely to\ndefendant, and we cannot therefore affirm on that basis (see People v\nConcepcion, 17 NY3d 192, 197-198; People v LaFontaine, 92 NY2d 470,\n474, rearg denied 93 NY2d 849).\n\n     As noted, the court imposed an enhanced sentence based solely on\nits determination that defendant \u201clied to the probation officer\u201d\nduring the PSR interview, presumably by telling the officer about an\nincident in which he touched the younger victim\u2019s breasts but did not\nhave sexual intercourse with her. With respect to that issue, we\nconclude that it cannot be determined from a review of record,\nincluding the PSR, whether defendant failed to answer truthfully\nquestions asked of him by the probation officer, as the court found.\nDefendant\u2019s admission of one incident in which he touched the younger\nvictim\u2019s breasts but stopped short of having sexual intercourse with\nher does not preclude the fact that there may have been a separate\nincident in which he had sexual intercourse with her. The PSR does\nnot indicate whether the probation officer specifically asked\ndefendant whether he had sexual intercourse with the younger victim,\nand it is therefore unclear whether defendant violated the condition\nof the sentence promise that he answer such questions truthfully. In\nthe absence of evidence of an untruthful answer to a question asked by\nthe probation officer, we conclude that the court erred in imposing an\nenhanced sentence. We therefore hold the case, reserve decision and\nremit the matter to County Court for a hearing to determine whether\nthere is such evidence.\n\n\n\n\nEntered:   May 8, 2015                          Frances E.
