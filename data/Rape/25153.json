(C.R. at 35.) Appellant was brought to trial on\n\nSeptember 26, 2013. (III R.R. at 1). Appellant entered a plea of not guilty to the\n\ncharges. (IV R.R. at 11.) The jury found Appellant guilty on October 3, 2013. (VII\n\nR.R. at 3.) The jury found the allegation in the enhancement paragraph true and\n\nsentenced Appellant to life in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. (VII R.R.\n\nat 4-5.) Appellant filed a Motion for New Trial and Request for Evidentiary\n\nHearing on November 4, 2013 (MNT1) The trial court signed an order of\n\npresentment on the motion for new trial on November 8, 2013. The trial court\n\ndenied Appellant\u2019s Motion for New Trial and Request for Evidentiary Hearing on\n\nDecember 16, 2013. (IX R.R. at 24.) Appellant gave timely notice of appeal and\n\nthe trial court\u2019s certification of defendant\u2019s right of appeal ensures Appellant has\n\nthe legal right to appeal. (C.R. 207, 209.) Tex. R. App. Proc. 25.2(a).\n\n\n\n\n1\n    Appellant\u2019s Motion for New Trial and Request of Evidentiary Hearing will hereinafter be cited as \u201cMNT.\u201d\n                                                          1\n\f                         ISSUES PRESENTED\n\nIssue One: Appellant received ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nIssue Two: The trial court erred in denying Appellant\u2019s motion for a\nspeedy trial.\n\nIssue Three: The trial court erred by failing to grant an evidentiary\nhearing on the Motion for New Trial.\n\nIssue Four: The trial court erred by bringing a material defense\nwitness, D.R. into the courtroom, handcuffed, and in a jail uniform.\n\nIssue Five: A new trial should have been granted based on newly\ndiscovered evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                  2\n\f                                STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      R.R. was fifteen years old at the time of the trial. (IV R.R. at 41.) Prior to the\n\ndate of the alleged incident, R.R. had not been home for two weeks. (IV R.R. at\n\n32.) Instead of going home, R.R. would go to Appellant\u2019s house with her best\n\nfriend, D.R., who had a room at Appellant\u2019s house. (IV R.R. at 33, 47.) R.R. went\n\nto Appellant\u2019s house almost every day after school and stayed the night there once\n\nin a while. (IV R.R. at 49.)\n\n      On January 2, 2012, R.R. claims that she was over at Raymond\u2019s house with\n\nD.R. in Appellant\u2019s room smoking. (IV R.R. at 52, 53.) Appellant left for a few\n\nhours and returned while R.R. was asleep according to R.R. (Id.) R.R. had also\n\ntaken \u201chandlebars\u201d, a type of drug, that day. (Id.) She claims that Appellant gave\n\nher and D.R. one of the handlebars each in their hand and placed some in a drink\n\nthat they consumed. (IV R.R. at 53-54.) R.R. claims that while they were\n\nconsuming these drinks, Appellant left, and R.R. stayed in Appellant\u2019s room. (IV\n\nR.R. at 55-56.) R.R. claims that Appellant would give marijuana and handlebars to\n\nD.R. (IV R.R. at 50.) Appellant denies giving them any bars or marijuana. (Id.)\n\nGabriale Cavitt testified that she never saw Cavitt use any drugs other than taking\n\nhis medicine. (V R.R. at 77.)\n\n      As R.R. was sitting in Appellant\u2019s bed talking to D.R., D.R. fell asleep. (IV\n\nR.R. at 57.) R.R. stated that she stayed awake for a while and then went to sleep\n                                           3\n\fnext to D.R. (Id.) According to R.R., Appellant was not there when R.R. went to\n\nsleep, but when she woke up, she was laying on her stomach, and Appellant was\n\non top of her. (IV R.R. at 58.) R.R., who weighs about 200 pounds (IV R.R. at\n\n106), never felt anyone pulling her pants down, but she felt pain in her vagina.\n\nR.R. claims Appellant was trying to force his penis into her vagina, but that it did\n\nnot penetrate her vagina even though it seemed like Appellant was trying to\n\npenetrate her with his penis and his arms were \u201call over her body\u201d. (IV R.R. at 58-\n\n60, 85.) She testified that when she awoke, she was wearing a pajama jacket and\n\nher long pajama pants, which were down by her ankles, and he was not wearing\n\nany pants, but she did not see his penis. (IV R.R. at 58-59.) The lights were out in\n\nthe ceiling of the bedroom and/or the hall, so the only light in the room would have\n\nbeen from the television or computer. (IV R.R. at 84.) R.R. testified that she knew\n\nit was Appellant because of his voice and she recognized his figure. (IV R.R. at\n\n105.) According to R.R., when she woke up she said, \u201cWhat are you doing? He\n\nsaid: I\u2019m just playing with you.\u201d (IV R.R. at 59.) She claims Appellant then\n\njumped up over the front of the bed. (IV R.R. at 108.) She tried to wake up D.R.,\n\nbut she would not wake up. (IV R.R. at 59.)\n\n           Raven then went up to Appellant\u2019s granddaughter and niece\u2019s apartment. (IV\n\nR.R. at 59.) Appellant\u2019s niece is Deanna2 Hoedzoade, and his granddaughter is\n\n2\n    Deanna is referred to as \u201cDee\u201d during most of the trial testimony.\n                                                            4\n\fnamed Gabriale. (IV R.R. at 63-64; V R.R. at 61.) They went down and carried\n\nD.R. upstairs. (IV R.R. at 64.)D.R. did not wake up until the next morning. (Id.)\n\nR.R. left and went to Juanita Robicheaux\u2019s house and told a story of what she\n\nclaimed occurred. Juanita Robicheaux is Appellant\u2019s hospice provider, and\n\nAppellant would go to her house every day. (V R.R. at 59, 123.) They did not\n\nbelieve R.R.. (IV R.R. at 90.) While R.R. does not remember talking to Shayshay\n\nMiller at Juanita Robicheaux\u2019s house and telling her that she was not sure what\n\nhappened, R.R. does remember speaking to Makayla Wilborn at Juanita\n\nRobicheaux\u2019s house. (IV R.R. at 115, 116.) She denies telling Makayla Wilborn\n\nthat she was not sure or nothing happened. (Id.) R.R. claims that Wilborn asked\n\nher what happened and she did not tell her anything. (Id.) They did not call the\n\npolice. (IV R.R. at 90.) She did not tell her mother the story until she eventually\n\nwent home two days after the alleged incident, and still no one called the police.\n\n(IV R.R. at 66, 67.) R.R. claims she did not originally tell her mother because she\n\ndid not want her mother to know she was doing drugs. (IV R.R. at 67.) R.R.\u2019s\n\nmother told the school principal and they called the police. (Id.) R.R. was not\n\nmedically examined until 22 days after the alleged incident. (IV R.R. at 145.) The\n\nexam showed no abnormalities. (IV R.R. at 20.)\n\n      Gabriale Cavitt testified that she and Dee Hoedzoade went to Appellant\u2019s\n\napartment on the day this incident is alleged to have occurred. (V R.R. at 66.)\n                                        5\n\fWhen they arrived, Appellant was fully dressed and washing dishes. (V R.R. at 66-\n\n67.) They talked to Appellant for five or ten minutes and then went back upstairs to\n\ntheir apartment. (V R.R. at 67.) Gabriale testified that it only takes four to five\n\nseconds to walk to her apartment. (Id.) Not even five minutes later, R.R. came to\n\nher apartment banging on the door and alleged that Appellant tried to rape her. (V\n\nR.R. at 69.) R.R. did not want to call the police. (V R.R. at 72.) Gabriale stated that\n\nshe went back down to Appellant\u2019s apartment and called D.R. five times telling her\n\nto get up but did not want to get up. (V R.R. at 73.) Gabriale testified that she\n\npicked D.R. up and carried her back up to their apartment and called Juanita\n\nRobicheaux. (Id.) The next morning, while it was still dark outside, Juanita\n\nRobicheaux\u2019s boyfriend, Tremane, picked up R.R. and D.R.. (Id.)\n\n      After Dee told Appellant that a girl was claiming somebody touched her, he\n\npicked up the phone and called 911. (V R.R. at 143.) The police would not file a\n\ncomplaint because Appellant did not know what girl said someone touched her;\n\ntherefore, they lacked a complaining witness. (V R.R. at 145.)\n\n      Appellant testified that the day after this alleged incident, R.R. and D.R.\n\nwere at his house when he arrived home after leaving Juanita Robicheaux\u2019s house.\n\n(V R.R. at 136.) They stayed at his house all night. (V R.R. at 136-37; VI R.R. at\n\n21.) The next day R.R. wore Appellant\u2019s clothes. (V R.R. at 142; VI R.R. at 24.)\n\nGabriale saw R.R. with D.R. at Appellant\u2019s house after school let out and R.R. was\n                                          6\n\fwearing the clothes Appellant gave her. (V R.R. at 80-81.) R.R. denies going back\n\nto Appellant\u2019s house the next day after she got out of school, and denied going to\n\nAppellant\u2019s house and wearing his clothes to school the next day. (IV R.R. at 76 -\n\n77.) R.R. was reluctant to talk to the police and was uncooperative. (IV R.R. at 26-\n\n31.)\n\n       A letter was written in R.R.\u2019s handwriting apologizing for making up this\n\nallegation and stating that she was intoxicated and on drugs when she did. (Def.\u2019s\n\nEx. 1) According to Gabriale Cavitt, the letter was prepared at her house and dated\n\nJanuary 28, 2013. (V R.R. at 84.) Gabriale denies helping R.R. write the letter and\n\ntestified that she only proofread it. (V R.R. at 85.) R.R. claims that D.R. wrote a\n\nstatement and then asked her to copy it in her own handwriting and sign it, and that\n\nshe was pressured to write it. (IV R.R. at 70, 76.) D.R. was also present at Gabriale\n\nCavitt\u2019s when R.R. wrote the letter. (VI R.R. at 25.) D.R. denies writing the letter\n\nor telling her what to put in the letter, and she testified that R.R. gave her the letter.\n\n(VI R.R. at 25-26.)\n\n       Appellant acquired statements from Makayla and Shayshay Miller and he\n\nbrought those statements when he talked to Sergeant Colburn. (V R.R. at 152.)\n\nFurthermore, Appellant testified that he could not become erect as a result of his\n\nmedications. (V R.R. at 154.) Appellant denies trying to molest R.R. (V R.R. at\n\n155.) Appellant did not know if R.R. was in his apartment the day of the incident\n                                            7\n\fbecause he did not see her there. (V R.R. at 165.) Appellant did not remember\n\nGabriale picking up D.R. and carrying her from his apartment or trying to wake her\n\nup. (V R.R. at 167.) Appellant was sleeping at the time this would have occurred,\n\nand Dee was the one that woke him up. (V R.R. at 167, 195.)\n\n      D.R. was brought into the courtroom in front of the jury in handcuffs and a\n\nbrown inmate jumpsuit. (VI R.R. at 3, 11-12.) Defense counsel requested that the\n\nhandcuffs be removed. (VI R.R. at 3.) According to D.R., her mother, Juanita\n\nRobicheaux was out of town at the time of the trial. (VI R.R. at 6.) She testified\n\nthat on the day of the incident, she and R.R. smoked marijuana when Appellant\n\nwas not there. (VI R.R. at 8-9.) D.R. was the one that got the handlebars off of the\n\nheadboard of Appellant\u2019s bed, R.R. asked her for the handlebars, and D.R. gave\n\nher one. (VI R.R. at 10, 56.) According to D.R., Appellant did not have anything to\n\ndo with them smoking or doing handlebars. (VI R.R. at 11.) D.R. testified that she\n\nput handlebars inside of a drink and put it in the freezer and gave herself one and\n\nhalf and she gave R.R. one and half handlebars. (VI R.R. at 56.) She also testified\n\nthat she was just asleep not passed out when she was carried. (VI R.R. at 61.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f                                         ARGUMENT\n\n       Issue One: Appellant received ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n       Appellant hereby incorporates by reference the Statement of Facts portion of\n\nthis brief as set forth at 3-8, supra.\n\n       A. Standard of Review\n\n       There are two components to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). The appellant must establish\n\nthat his trial counsel performed deficiently and that the deficiency operated to\n\nprejudice him. Id. To show prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a\n\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the\n\nproceeding would have been different.\u201d A reasonable probability is a probability\n\nsufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id. at 694. In evaluating the\n\nfirst component, reviewing courts must not second-guess legitimate strategic or\n\ntactical decisions made by trial counsel in the midst of trial, but instead \u201cmust\n\nindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of\n\nreasonable professional assistance.\u201d Id. at 689.\n\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\f      B. Trial Counsel improperly informed the jury that Appellant had\n         already been incarcerated based on this case for the past 542 Days.\n\n      During voir dire, defense counsel informed the jury that Appellant had been\n\nin jail on this case for five hundred and forty two days, infringing on his\n\nfundamental right to the presumption of innocence. In Ephram v. State, the Texas\n\nCourt of Criminal Appeals held that \u201ctrying a defendant in prison clothing\n\ninfringed upon his right to presumption of innocence and required reversal.\u201d 471\n\nS.W.2d 798 (Tex. Crim. App. 1971).\n\n      Defense counsel started voir dire but stating \u201cIt\u2019s my high honor and\n\nprivilege to represent Mr. Cavitt. I\u2019ve known him for 542 days now.\u201d (III RR. At\n\n121.) Defense was asking the venirepanel whether the fact that he has been\n\nindicted makes him guilty, and a venireperson responded:\n\n      [Venireperson]:          How many days did you say he\u2019s been locked up?\n\n      [Defense counsel]:       Five-forty-two\n\n      [Venireperson]:          I don\u2019t know.\n\n      [Defense counsel]:       That has nothing to do with it. We\u2019re getting to\n                               trial. I\u2019m asking about this paper.\n\n      [Venireperson]:          He\u2019s been in there that long?\n\n      [Defense counsel]:       Right.\n\n      [Venireperson]:          So, something must be wrong.\n\n      [Defense counsel]:       Right. What must be wrong?\n                                        10\n\f      [Venireperson]:          He\u2019s guilty.\n\n      [Defense counsel]:       Because he\u2019s been here 542 days he must be\n                               guilty?\n\n      [Venireperson]:          Yeah. Why is taking him so long to get the\n                               evidence or whatever and get it lined out and get\n                               him out of here?\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:       I\u2019ve been ready for trial after 90 days. (III RR. At\n                               128-29.)\n\n      Defense counsel also elicited testimony from Appellant that he had a lengthy\n\npretrial incarceration.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:       And you\u2019ve been in jail now how long?\n\n      [Appellant]:             Almost two years.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:       550 days, 48 days, something like that?\n\n      [Appellant]:             Yes, sir. (V R.R. at 113.)\n\n      Defense counsel\u2019s comments regarding Appellant\u2019s lengthy pretrial\n\nincarceration violated his constitutional protections and the requisite presumption\n\nof innocence. His comments violated Appellant\u2019s presumption of innocence under\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. These comments are\n\nanalogous to cases in which an accused is brought in front of the jury in prison\n\nclothes, and infringe on Appellants right to be presumed innocent until proven\n\nguilty. To implement the presumption the presumption [of innocence], courts must\n\n\n                                        11\n\fbe alert to factors that may undermine the fairness of the fact-finding process. In\n\nthe administration of criminal justice, courts must carefully guard against dilution\n\nof the principle that guilt is to be established by probative evidence and beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501 (1976). Similar to wearing\n\nprison garb, pretrial incarceration \u201coperates usually against only those who cannot\n\npost bail prior to trial. Persons who can secure release are not subjected to this\n\ncondition.\u201d Id. at 505. There can be no valid strategically reason to comment on\n\nAppellant\u2019s lengthy pretrial incarceration.\n\n      C. Failing to adequately inform Appellant about advantages and\n         disadvantages of testifying.\n\n      During voir dire, defense counsel informed the jury that he decides whether\n\nor not Mr. Cavitt will testify. (III RR. At 129.) He later reiterated this again to the\n\njury by stating, \u201cNow, if Mr. Cavitt doesn\u2019t testify \u2013 and again, it would be up to\n\nme \u2013 would you hold that against him on the first row?\u201d (III R.R. at 129.) \u201cI\u2019m\n\nhaving my client testify and my client has a checkered [past], he\u2019s been to prison\n\nbefore, can you set all that aside, can you set all that aside and not think about that\n\nat all, and just on the facts of this case and the testimony you hear [and] render a\n\nverdict.\u201d (III R.R. at 139.) Before Appellant testified, defense counsel went on the\n\nrecord and made Appellant confirm that he understands that he has the right to\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\ftestify or not and that if he testifies he would be subject to rigorous cross-\n\nexamination. (V R.R. At 111.)\n\n      Nevertheless, trial counsel failed to adequately discuss with Appellant\n\nwhether or not he should testify during the guilt-innocence phase of the trial.\n\n(MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 4.) Appellant has a criminal history including a previous sexual\n\nassault conviction among other serious convictions. Counsel failed to discuss with\n\nAppellant that his prior criminal history could be revealed to the jury if he decided\n\nto testify. (MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 4.) If he had been informed of this information,\n\nAppellant would have chosen not to testify at the guilt-innocence phase of the trial.\n\n(MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 4.) Appellant even filed a letter with the trial court asking that he\n\norder the district attorney not to bring up any other case that is not involved with\n\nhis current charge. (MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 12.)(C.R. at 123-27.) The Defendant\u2019s\n\ncriminal history came out during the guilt-innocence phase of the trial after the\n\nDefendant testified.\n\n      Counsel\u2019s failure to advise Appellant of the disadvantages of testifying,\n\nincluding the admissibility of his prior sexual assault conviction, was outside the\n\nwide range of professionally competent advice and did not constitute the exercise\n\nof reasonable professional judgment. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668\n\n(1984). The prejudicial effect of the admission of a prior sexual assault conviction\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fduring a sexual assault of a child trial is apparent, and Appellant was denied a fair\n\ntrial by counsel\u2019s failure to inform him of the effect of his decision to testify.\n\n      D. Failing to challenge or strike venireperson.\n\n      In response to questioning regarding Appellant\u2019s criminal history and being\n\nable to render a fair verdict, venireperson number 39 stated,\n\n      [Venireperson]:             Like the previous two are saying, if the person has\n                                  a history of the similar crime and their testimony is\n                                  not credible in my eyes.\n\n      [Defense counsel]:          And you couldn\u2019t render a fair and impartial\n                                  verdict. Is that right?\n\n      [Venireperson]:             That\u2019s hard to say that. (III R.R. at 145.)\n\n      Defense failed to challenge venireperson 39 for cause, or move to strike him.\n\n(III R.R. at 149-59) (C.R. at 169.) Venireperson 39 was placed on the jury\n\npresiding over the trial. (III R.R. at 160.)\n\n      In this case Appellant\u2019s prior conviction for sexual assault was revealed\n\nduring the guilt-innocence state of the trial. Appellant was entitled to a fair and\n\nimpartial jury under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and\n\nArt. 1 \u00a7 10 of the Texas Constitution. Under the Texas Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure, Article 35.16(9), venireperson 39 was challengeable for cause because\n\nhe had a bias against the defendant. \u201cOne improper juror destroys the integrity of\n\nthe verdict.\u201d Sorrell v. State, 169 S.W. 299, 303 (Tex. Crim. App. 1914). There\n\n\n                                           14\n\fcan be \u201cno reasonable defense strategy that would justify allowing such an\n\nindividual to sit on a jury to determine the legal fate of one\u2019s client in a criminal\n\ntrial. Permitting such an occurrence undermines in advance the perceived essence\n\nof a jury\u2019s purpose to render a fair and impartial verdict. Delrio v. State, 820\n\nS.W.2d 29, 32 (Tex. App. \u2013 Houston [14th Dist.] 1991).\n\n      E. Failing to secure the presence of material witnesses to testify at the\n         trial.\n\n      Counsel was ineffective for failing to subpoena material witnesses in support\n\nof the Appellant\u2019s assertion that the complainant\u2019s allegation was fabricated. See\n\nShelton v. State, 841, S.W.2d 526 (Tex. App. \u2013 Fort Worth 1992, no pet.)\n\nAppellant had informed his attorney that he was set up because he had people\n\nremoved from his apartment. (MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 4.) He also sent a letter to the court\n\ninforming the court of this information. (MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 5.) Appellant had\n\ninformed his attorney that Gabriale Cavitt, R.R., and Deanna Hoedzoade made up\n\nthis allegation after the Defendant had the Houston Police Department come and\n\nremove Gabriale Cavitt and Deanna Hoedzoade from his residence and he had\n\nasked R.R. to go home. (MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 4.) Appellant\u2019s theory of motive\n\nregarding the complainant\u2019s story was also reflected in his statement provided to\n\nthe police and noted in the offense report. (MNT at 3.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f      Dorothy Cavitt Lewis had informed Appellant\u2019s attorney, William Gifford,\n\nbefore the trial that Deanna Hoedzoade had personally told her that they lied to the\n\npolice, she was on drugs, and they made all of this up. (MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 6.)\n\nDeanna told Dorothy that she wanted to go to the police station to change her\n\nstatement, but she was scared of getting in trouble. (MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 6.) Dorothy\n\nCavitt Lewis was never subpoenaed or requested to attend the trial. Dorothy Cavitt\n\nLewis would have attended the trial if she was subpoenaed or requested to do so.\n\n(MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 6.)\n\n      Additionally, Ja\u2019Shone Collins wrote an affidavit for the defense on June 21,\n\n2012. (MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 7.) This affidavit was provided to defense counsel and was\n\nalso in the State\u2019s file available under the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s open\n\nfile policy. (MNT at 4.) In her affidavit she stated that her and some friends were at\n\nthe Appellant\u2019s house. Raven was upset because Appellant would not take her\n\nhome so she paired up with \u201cMr. Raymond\u2019s other enemies\u201d and made R.R. say\n\nthat when she woke up Appellant was on top of her. Later on in the week, R.R. told\n\nMs. Collins that they made her say that because they were upset with Appellant.\n\n(MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 7.) Counsel failed to subpoena Ja\u2019Shone Collins to testify at the\n\ntrial. (MNT at 4.)\n\n      In his affidavit, defense counsel stated that Ja\u2019Shone Collins told his\n\ninvestigator that she was present and in bed with R.R., D.R., and Appellant. (MNT,\n                                         16\n\fState\u2019s Ex. 1.) Since defense counsel believed it to be untruthful, he did not use her\n\ntestimony.\n\n      Moreover, Jacquette Miller also wrote a statement for the defense. (MNT,\n\nDef.\u2019s Ex. 8.) In her statement, she stated that when R.R. told her about what\n\nhappened, Ms. Miller said she was going to call the police and told R.R. to call her\n\nmother. R.R. begged Ms. Miller not to call the police because R.R. was not really\n\nsure and her mother would not let her come around anymore. Ms. Miller also wrote\n\nthat after this happened R.R. went to school the next day and then went back to\n\nAppellant\u2019s apartment and spent the night again. R.R. also kept changing her story\n\nabout what happened. She told Ms. Miller she really did not know. This statement\n\nwas written on January 13, 2012, and provided to defense counsel. The statement\n\nwas also in the State\u2019s file that was available through the District Attorney\u2019s open\n\nfile policy. (MNT at 5.) Jacquette Miller also provided a statement to the police. In\n\nher statement, which was also reflected in the offense report available to the\n\ndefense under the District Attorney\u2019s open file policy, stated that on the night of\n\nthe incident R.R. told her she did not know if Appellant had his clothes on. (Id.)\n\nR.R. told her she did not know who it was that did this to her. (Id.) Ms. Miller told\n\nR.R. she was going to call the police, but R.R. told her not to call the police\n\nbecause she would get in trouble with her mother. (Id.) R.R. then told her she did\n\nnot know what happened. (Id.) She told R.R. to go home after school, but instead\n                                         17\n\fR.R. went back to the Defendant\u2019s apartment. (Id.) R.R. spent the night at\n\nAppellant\u2019s and wore Appellant\u2019s clothes to school the next day. (Id.) Counsel\n\nfailed to subpoena Jaquette Miller to testify at the trial. (Id.)\n\n      In his affidavit for the motion for new trial, defense counsel stated that\n\nJuanita Robicheaux told him that Jacquette Miller was a heavy drug user and could\n\ngenerally be found on a particular street corner and that no one had an actual\n\naddress at which Jacquette Miller could be located. (MNT, State\u2019s Ex. 1.) He stated\n\nthat based on his inability to locate her, and her credibility issues, he decided to\n\nproceed without her. (Id.) Although defense counsel stated that his investigator\n\nwent to places that he was informed she could be found, he did not state how many\n\ntimes he went to these places and what places he went to.\n\n      Likewise, Clydell Adams would testify that R.R. was high on weed and she\n\ntold people around the apartment that it was not the Defendant who did this to her.\n\nHe also saw R.R. come back to the Defendant\u2019s apartment after this incident and\n\nstay at his apartment for the next two nights. (MNT, Exhibit 10.) This statement\n\nwas provided to defense counsel prior to trial. The statement was also in the State\u2019s\n\nfile that was available through the District Attorney\u2019s open file policy. Counsel\n\nfailed to subpoena Clydell Adams to testify at the trial. (MNT at 5.)\n\n      Defense counsel stated that the reason he did not subpoena him to testify\n\nwas because he was in jail, he had a criminal history, he did not want this imputed\n                                            18\n\fon Appellant, and he believed he could elicit the same testimony from Gabriale\n\nCavitt and D.R.. (MNT, State\u2019s Ex. 1.)\n\n        Makayla Wilburn also wrote a statement that R.R. changed her story. She\n\nalso said that R.R. went back to stay at the Defendant\u2019s apartment and asked to\n\nwear his clothes. (MNT, Exhibit 9.) This statement was provided to defense\n\ncounsel. The statement was also in the State\u2019s file that was available through the\n\nDistrict Attorney\u2019s open file policy. Counsel failed to subpoena Makayla Wilburn\n\nto testify at the trial.\n\n       Defense counsel stated that he was aware of the statement given by Wilburn\n\nbut he believed it was duplicative of other witness testimony and neither himself\n\nnor his investigator was able to locate her. Defense counsel fails to state what\n\nefforts either himself or his investigator took to locate her. Furthermore, testimony\n\nthat R.R. would change her story was material to Appellant\u2019s defense.\n\n       Additionally, Juanita Robicheaux was sworn to return and was not present\n\nduring the trial. (IV R.R. at 3-4.) At the beginning of the trial, defense counsel\n\nnoted on the record that Juanita Robicheaux was a \u201ccritical, important witness\u201d\n\nwho left town for a month for work. Defense counsel had informed her that she\n\nneeded to be present when he spoke to her the Friday before trial; however, she left\n\ntown. (IV R.R. at 5.)\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\f        Defense counsel moved for a continuance in the interest of justice. (IV R.R.\n\nat 5.) Defense counsel stated that her testimony was \u201cextremely important when it\n\ncomes to the testimony of what the child did, what happened at that exact time, and\n\nwho was present. And without that testimony, I can\u2019t get anyone else to say: I\n\nbrought him to the house, let him off, he goes in the kitchen.\u201d (IV R.R. at 6.) The\n\ncourt denied Appellant\u2019s motion for continuance. (IV R.R. at 6.) The court later\n\ngranted a short continuance during the trial until the following day. (V R.R. at\n\n201.)\n\n        After the defense rested, defense counsel withdrew his motion for a\n\ncontinuance based on the fact that the witness was not present to testify. (VI R.R.\n\nat 74.) He withdrew his request for a continuance based on his opinion that other\n\nwitnesses have covered what he believed Juanita Robicheaux would testify to. (VI\n\nR.R. at 74.) Defense counsel stated that all he believed Juanita Robicheaux would\n\nbe able to testify to that was not already introduced at the trial was that \u201cshe was\n\nwith Raymond all day and she\u2019s his caregiver. That\u2019s about it.\u201d (VI R.R. at 74.)\n\n        According to defense counsel\u2019s affidavit, he considered Juanita Robicheaux\n\nto be an important witness in the case. (MNT, State\u2019s Ex. 1.) He stated that he was\n\nconcerned that the jury would blame Appellant if he were to ask for the case to be\n\nfurther delayed to get her into court and he was unable to give any kind of timeline\n\nas to when she might appear. (MNT, State\u2019s Ex. 1.)\n                                         20\n\f      Juanita Robicheaux was the Appellant\u2019s healthcare provider and is the\n\nmother of D.R. (MNT at 6.) Juanita Robicheaux provided a statement to the police\n\nthat was also reflected in the offense report available under the District Attorney\u2019s\n\nopen file policy. (Id.) According to Juanita Robicheaux\u2019s statement to the police,\n\nD.R. told her mother, Juanita Robicheaux, that R.R. was lying. (Id.) Juanita\n\nRobicheaux told R.R. to call the police the night of the incident and R.R. said she\n\ndid not want to the call the police. (Id.) R.R. was mad because D.R. and R.R. got\n\ninto an argument and that was when the police became involved. (Id.) According to\n\nthe offense report, Juanita Robicheaux also signed a statement saying that R.R.\n\nkept changing her story. (Id.)\n\n      F. Failing to elicit testimony to demonstrate a motive for R.R. to make\n         up this allegation.\n\n      Gabriale and Dee Hoedzoade had a fight with Appellant and he made them\n\nmove out of the house before this incident. (IV R.R. at 135; V R.R. at 52, 61-62.)\n\nCounsel failed to elicit testimony from Gabriale Cavitt that R.R., the complainant,\n\ntold Gabriale Cavitt about three or four weeks after this alleged incident that she\n\nmade this up because she was upset. Gabriale Cavitt had informed trial counsel of\n\nthis information. Gabriale Cavitt testified during the trial, and would have testified\n\nto this information if the Defendant\u2019s attorney elicited it during her testimony.\n\n(MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 6.)\n\n\n                                         21\n\f      Moreover, D.R. also wrote a statement for the defense. See (MNT, Def.\u2019s\n\nEx. 14.) In her statement she said R.R. was mad because the Appellant kept telling\n\nher that she needed to call her mother or he will take her home. D.R. also stated in\n\nan affidavit that Gabriale Cavitt and Deanna Jackson (also known as Deanna\n\nHoedzoade) were mad at Appellant and told R.R. to get Appellant in trouble with\n\nthis accusation. R.R. did not report it until she \u201cgot into it\u201d with D.R. and that is\n\nwhen she reported this incident. (MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 15.) Both her statement and her\n\naffidavit were provided to defense counsel and were in the State\u2019s file available for\n\nreview under the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s open file policy. (MNT at 8.)\n\nD.R. testified at the trial. Counsel failed to elicit this information through her\n\ntestimony at trial.\n\n      G. Failing to object to inadmissible expert testimony regarding\n         Appellant\u2019s likelihood of reoffending during the guilt-innocence\n         stage of the trial.\n\n      Dr. Lawrence Thompson Jr. (\u201cThompson\u201d) testified for the defense. (IV\n\nR.R. at 173.) Thompson is employed with the Harris County Children\u2019s\n\nAssessment Center as the director of therapy and psychological services. (IV R.R.\n\nat 174.) During redirect examination, the State asked to approach the bench and\n\ninformed the court at the bench that he wanted to \u201cask the witness about patterns of\n\nbehavior with regard to people who reoffend in sexual abuse cases,\u201d and asked if\n\nthere was any objection to it. (IV R.R. at 201.) Defense counsel\u2019s only concern, as\n                                         22\n\fstated at the bench, was that he \u201ccouches it abuse as to what, an adult or a child\n\nwhatever. Because if we have no report of any prior children, this is a child clinical\n\npsychologist.\u201d (IV R.R. at 201.) The State elicited testimony that some sex\n\noffenders have specific adults or children that they target, and that \u201chypothetically,\n\nan individual who targeted a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old female, would be\n\nwithin the type of general category that somebody might select?\u201d (IV R.R. at 202-\n\n03.) To which, Thompson responded that essentially \u201cit\u2019s not just the age that they\n\nmay be attracted to, but what they look like.\u201d (IV R.R. at 204.) The prosecutor then\n\nwent further and asked, \u201cIn your experience dealing with sex offenders or\n\nperpetrators of sexual abuse, is it common or uncommon for them to be a one-shot\n\ndeal? Is it just usually one time they commit sexual abuse or is it typically a\n\nbehavior issue?\u201d (IV R.R. at 206.) Thompson responded, \u201cI can say as to the extent\n\nthat there is an inappropriate sexual attraction to children, that inappropriate sexual\n\nattraction is there and is an issue in an ongoing way. There\u2019s no cure for that\n\ninappropriate sexual attraction.\u201d (IV R.R. at 204.)\n\n      Under Texas Rule of Evidence 702, the trial court must find that the\n\nfollowing three conditions are satisfied before admitting expert testimony: (1) the\n\nwitness qualifies as an expert by reason of her knowledge, skill, experience,\n\ntraining, or education; (2) the subject matter of the testimony is an appropriate one\n\nfor expert testimony; and (3) admitting the expert testimony will actually assist the\n                                          23\n\ftrier of fact in deciding the case. Tex. R. Evid. 702. The trial court\u2019s determination\n\nregarding experts\u2019 qualifications and the admissibility of expert testimony is\n\nsubject to an abuse of discretion standard. Lagrone v. State, 942 S.W.2d 602, 616\n\n(Tex. Crim. App), cert. denied (1997).\n\n      Under Texas Rules of Evidence, Rule 403, \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence\n\nmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice . . . \u201d Tex. R. Evid. 403. Defense counsel was also ineffective for\n\nfailing to object to this line of under Rule 403 since any probative value was\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\n      H. Introducing testimony regarding Appellant\u2019s prior remote\n         convictions and failing to obtain a ruling regarding the admissibility\n         of Appellant\u2019s prior convictions.\n\n      Eliciting testimony from the defendant as to his own prior convictions can\n\nbe a matter of sound trial strategy, if the prior convictions are admissible. Martin v.\n\nState, 265 S.W.3d 435, 443 (Tex. App. \u2013 Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.);\n\nRodriguez v. State, 129 S.W.3d 551, 558-59 (Tex. App. \u2013 Houston [1st Dist.] 2003,\n\npet. ref\u2019d). However, if prior convictions are inadmissible, there can be no\n\nreasonable trial strategy for introducing them before the jury. Robertson v. State,\n\n187 S.W.3d 475, 485-86 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). \u201cThe fact that a witness,\n\nincluding the accused, has been charged with an offense, is inadmissible for\n\nimpeaching the witness\u2019s credibility unless the charge has resulted in a final\n                                          24\n\fconviction for a felony or an offense involving moral turpitude, and even then it\n\nmust not be too remote.\u201d Sinegal v. State, 789 S.W.2d 383 (Tex. App. \u2013 Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 1990, pet. ref\u2019d) (citing Alexander v. State, 740 S.W.2d 749, 763 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1987).\n\n      Rule 609 provides that evidence of a witness\u2019s prior convictions is\n\nadmissible for purposes of impeachment if the crime was a felony or a crime of\n\nmoral turpitude and if the trial court determines its probative value outweighs its\n\nprejudicial effect. Tex. R. Evid. 609(a). However, a prior conviction is\n\npresumptively inadmissible for impeachment purposes if more than ten years have\n\nelapsed since the date of conviction or of the witnesses\u2019 release date from the\n\nconfinement imposed for the prior conviction, whichever is later. The date of trial\n\nis the controlling time for computation because the purpose of admitting prior\n\nconvictions at the guilt stage of the trial is to allow impeachment. Sinegal, 789\n\nS.W.2d at 387.\n\n      The testimony elicited at trial is that Appellant was convicted of Accessory\n\nto Robbery in the early 1970s, Sexual Assault in 1989, and Forgery in 1986. (CR.\n\nAt 35.) (V R.R. at 114.) These convictions were approximately 40, 24, and 27\n\nyears old respectively. Additionally, Appellant testified that he served eighteen to\n\nnineteen years on the accessory to robbery charge that he was convicted of in the\n\nearly 1970s. (V R.R. at 114.) It is reasonable to assume that Appellant was\n                                        25\n\freleased before 1986, because that is when he was convicted of Forgery. Therefore,\n\nAppellant was released from confinement on his conviction of accessory to\n\nrobbery approximately 27 years ago. Therefore his conviction was presumptively\n\ntoo remote to be admissible.\n\n      Furthermore, the State failed to list Appellant\u2019s prior conviction for\n\nAccessory to Robbery from the early 1970s in its notice of prior convictions and\n\nextraneous offenses that was filed on January 15, 2013. (C.R. at 67.) Therefore,\n\ncounsel elicited harmful testimony that the State never sought to introduce, nor\n\ngave notice that it intended to introduce at trial.\n\n      Appellant testified that he was released after approximately serving six\n\nmonths on his conviction of Forgery in 1986. (V RR. At 116-17.) Therefore, it has\n\nbeen approximately 27 years since he was released from confinement on his charge\n\nof Forgery. Therefore his conviction was presumptively too remote to be\n\nadmissible.\n\n      Moreover, Appellant testified that he was released after serving 16-and-half\n\nyears or 17-and-a-half years on his conviction of sexual assault in 1989. Therefore,\n\nit has been approximately eight years since Appellant was released from\n\nconfinement on his charge of sexual assault.\n\n      The Court of Criminal Appeals has set out a nonexclusive list of factors\n\ncourts should use to weight the probative value of a conviction against its\n                                           26\n\fprejudicial effect. Theus v. State, 845 S.W.2d 874 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992). These\n\ninclude: (1) the impeachment value of the prior crime; (2) the temporal proximity\n\nof the past crime relative to the charged offense and the witness\u2019s subsequent\n\nhistory; (3) the similarity between the past crime and charged offense; (4) the\n\nimportance of the witness\u2019s testimony; and (5) the importance of the witness\u2019s\n\ncredibility. Id. at 880. The proponent seeking to introduce Rule 609 evidence has\n\nthe burden of showing that the probative value of a conviction outweighs its\n\nprejudicial effect. Id.\n\n       With respect to the first factor, the Court of Criminal Appeals has stated that\n\ncrimes involving deception or moral turpitude have a higher impeachment value\n\nthan crimes involving violence. Id. at 811. The impeachment value of his sexual\n\nassault conviction or his accessory to robbery conviction is low because the crimes\n\ndo not necessarily involve deception. However, the charge of forgery could be\n\nfound to involve deception.\n\n       The second Theus factor favors admission \u201cif the past crime was recently\n\ncommitted and if the witness has demonstrated a propensity for breaking the law.\u201d\n\nSimpson v. State, 886 S.W.2d 449, 452 (Tex. App. \u2013 Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, pet.\n\nref\u2019d). Appellant was convicted of Accessory to Robbery in the 1970s, Sexual\n\nAssault in 1989, Forgery in 1986. (CR. At 35.) These convictions were\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fapproximately 40, 24 and 27 years old respectively. These convictions were too\n\nremote to be admissible.\n\n       Under the third Theus factor, similarity between a prior offense and the\n\ncurrent offense weights against admissibility under Rule 609, whereas dissimilarity\n\nbetween the prior offense and the current offense favors admissibility. Theus, 845\n\nS.W.2d at 881. \u201cThis is so because the admission for impeachment purposes of a\n\ncrime similar to that charged presents a situation in which the jury could convict\n\nbased on the perception of the past conduct rather than the facts of the present case.\n\nThomas v. State, 312 S.W.3d at 732, 739-40 (Tex. App. \u2013 Houston [1st Dist.] 2009,\n\npet. ref\u2019d).\n\n       With respect to Appellant\u2019s prior conviction for forgery and accessory to\n\nrobbery, the dissimilarity in the two offenses would weigh in favor of\n\nadmissibility. However, Appellant\u2019s previous conviction for sexual assault and the\n\npresent charge of sexual assault of a child include the same sexual assault elements\n\nand this similarity would weigh in favor of exclusion. Therefore, the third Theus\n\nfactor favors admissibility of Appellant\u2019s prior conviction for forgery and\n\naccessory to robbery, but disfavors admissibility of Appellant\u2019s prior conviction\n\nfor sexual assault.\n\n       Finally, under the fourth and fifth factors, the court is to consider the\n\nimportance of appellant\u2019s testimony and his credibility. Martin v. State, 265\n                                         28\n\fS.W.3d 435, 445 (Tex. App. \u2013 Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.). According to\n\nR.R.\u2019s testimony, the only person awake at Appellant\u2019s apartment when this\n\nincident is alleged to have occurred was Appellant when she woke up during the\n\nalleged incident. Therefore, the jury\u2019s verdict on guilt or innocence depended\n\nalmost entirely on its assessment of R.R.\u2019s and Appellant\u2019s credibility.\n\n        There could be no reasonable basis for failing to have the court weigh these\n\nfactors and make a ruling before admitting evidence of these convictions before the\n\njury.\n\n        I. Eliciting inadmissible facts regarding Appellant\u2019s prior convictions.\n\n        During the trial, defense counsel elicited potentially inadmissible facts\n\nregarding Appellant\u2019s prior convictions and his status as a registered sex offender.\n\n        [Defense Counsel]:       Now, you went to the database and know that he\n                                 was a sex offender?\n\n        [John Colburn]:          Yes, sir. (IV R.R. at 165.)\n\n        and\n\n        [Defense Counsel]:       Did you know Mr. Cavitt was in the penitentiary\n                                 for about 34 years?\n\n        [Gabriale Cavitt]:       Yes, sir. (V R.R. at 110.)\n\n        Defense counsel elicited further facts regarding Appellant\u2019s criminal history\n\nand the length of time Appellant spent incarcerated on his prior convictions, which\n\nwould be inadmissible at the guilt-innocence stage of the trial.\n                                          29\n\f[Defense Counsel]:   The first time you went to prison was when, if you\n                     recall?\n\n[Appellant]:         In the early, early \u201870s.\n\n[Defense Counsel]:   What was that for?\n\n[Appellant]:         Accessory to robbery.\n\n[Defense Counsel]:   Accessory to robbery. All right. How long did you\n                     stay in prison that time.\n\n[Appellant]:         Twenty\u2014eighteen, nineteen years, something like\n                     that. A long time.\n\n[Defense Counsel]:   Okay. Eighteen to nineteen years?\n\n[Appellant]:         Yes, sir. (V R.R. at 114.)\n\n[Defense Counsel]:   Sure. Okay. And then you messed up again and\n                     went to prison; is that correct[?]\n\n[Appellant]:         Yes, sir.\n\n[Defense Counsel]:   When was that?\n\n[Appellant]:         I think it was \u201986.\n\n[Defense Counsel]:   1986. What was that for?\n\n[Appellant]:         I had got a forgery by passing check case.\n\n[Defense Counsel]:   So, you had a forgery in there. How long were you\n                     in prison that time.\n\n[Appellant]:         I was in there \u2013 I think like maybe six months or\n                     seven months because it got reversed.\n\n\n\n                                 30\n\f      [Defense Counsel]:        Okay. So, you don\u2019t have a conviction for that as\n                                far as you know?\n\n      [Appellant]:              No, not as far as I know.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:        Now, did you then go to prison again?\n\n      [Appellant]:              Yes, sir.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:        When was that?\n\n      [Appellant]:              I don\u2019t remember what year it was.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:        Okay. And what was that for?\n\n      [Appellant]:              Sexual assault.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:        Sexual assault?\n\n      [Appellant]:              Right.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:        How long were in prison that time?\n\n      [Appellant]:              I would say it was 16-and-a-half-years or 17-and-\n                                a-half years.\n\n      [Defense Counsel]:        All right. So how many total years have you been\n                                in prison.\n\n      [Appellant]:              Thirty-five and one-half years. (V RR.

The information elicited by defense counsel would have been\n\n\n                                            31\n\finadmissible, and this information impacted his right to a fair trial and his\n\npresumption of innocence.\n\n      J. Failing to object to the State\u2019s questioning of Appellant regarding\n         details of his previous sexual assault conviction.\n\n      Trial counsel failed to object to inadmissible details regarding Appellant\u2019s\n\nprior conviction for sexual assault.\n\n      [Prosecutor]:              The case that you plead guilty to back in 1988\n                                 involved a complaining witness who was a female,\n                                 right?\n\n      [Appellant]:               1988, yes, sir.\n\n      [Prosecutor]:              The prior sexual assault. She was 18 years old,\n                                 right?\n\n      [Appellant]:               Yes, sir.\n\n      [Prosecutor]:              And you said you pled to that and got 18 years and\n                                 you finished that up around 2005, 2006?\n\n      [Appellant]:               Yes, sir. (V R.R. at 187.)\n\n      As stated above, supra, Generally, even though prior conviction may be\n\nadmissible, details of that conviction are not. Lape v. State, 893 S.W.2d 949 (Tex.\n\nApp. \u2013 Houston [14th Dist.], pet ref\u2019d.); Jabari v. State, 273 S.W.3d 745 (Tex. App.\n\n\u2013 Houston [1st Dist. 2008, no pet.). The harmful effect of this testimony was\n\nexacerbated by Dr. Lawrence Thompson Jr.\u2019s testimony regarding attraction to\n\nchildren of a certain age. (IV R.R. at 202-03.) There could not be a valid\n\n\n                                             32\n\fstrategically reason for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s question eliciting\n\ninadmissible and harmful information.\n\n      K. Harm\n\n      Appellant was harmed based on the attorney\u2019s ineffective assistance since he\n\nwas denied the presumption of innocence by trial counsel commenting on his\n\nlengthy pretrial incarceration, his lengthy criminal history and venireperson 39 was\n\nplaced on the jury who stated that he would have trouble finding appellant credible\n\nwhen he has a prior similar crime. Moreover, he was denied a fair trial by\n\ncounsel\u2019s failure to secure the presence of material witnesses to testify at trial in\n\nhis defense, his counsel\u2019s failure to elicit testimony regarding R.R.\u2019s motive to\n\nmake up this allegation from the witnesses who did testify, his counsel\u2019s failure to\n\nobject to inadmissible expert testimony regarding appellant\u2019s likelihood of\n\nreoffending during the guilt-innocence stage of trial, his trial counsel\u2019s introduction\n\nof his prior convictions without a ruling as to their admissibility, his trial counsel\n\neliciting facts regarding Appellant\u2019s prior convictions and failing to object to the\n\nState\u2019s introduction of facts regarding his prior convictions. Additionally,\n\nAppellant was harmed as a result of counsel\u2019s failure to advise him of the\n\ndisadvantages of testifying since his prior criminal history was revealed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\f       Issue Two: The trial court erred in denying Appellant\u2019s motion\n       for a speedy trial.\n\n       Appellant hereby incorporates by reference the Statement of Facts portion of\n\nthis brief as set forth at 3-8, supra.\n\n       A defendant does not have the right to hybrid representation. Robinson v.\n\nState, 240 S.W.3d 919 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). A trial court is free to disregard\n\nany pro se motions presented by a defendant who is represented by counsel. Id.\n\nHowever, once a trial court actually rules on a pro se motion, that ruling is subject\n\nto appellate review. Id. at 922. Additionally, defense counsel adopted all of the\n\npros se motions filed by Appellant. (V R.R. at 184.)\n\n       The defendant\u2019s assertion of his speedy trial right is entitled to strong\n\nevidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of that\n\nright. Appellant filed a pro se motion for a speedy trial on August 19, 2013. (MNT,\n\nDef.\u2019s Ex. 20.) The Defendant was incarcerated on this charge on April 3, 2012. At\n\nthat point the Defendant had already been incarcerated for over one year and four\n\nmonths. The trial court denied this motion on August 21, 2013. (MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex.\n\n20.)\n\n       The court is to analyze a speedy trial decision by looking at four specific\n\nfactors laid out by Barker v. Wingo: (1) whether the delay before trial was\n\nuncommonly long; (2) whether the government or the criminal defendant is more\n\n\n                                         34\n\fto blame for that delay; (3) whether, in due course, the defendant asserted his right\n\nto a speedy trial; and (4) whether he suffered prejudice as the delay\u2019s result.\n\nZamaro v. State, 84 S.W.3d 643 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002)(en banc)(citing citing\n\nBarker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 515 (1970)). The courts \u201cmust analyze federal\n\nconstitutional claims by first weighing the strength of the above factors and then\n\nbalancing their relative weights in light of \u2018the conduct of both the prosecution and\n\nthe defendant.\u2019\u201d Id. at 648 (Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. at 530).\n\n      The first factor is the length of the delay. Id. \u201cThe length of the delay\n\nbetween an initial charge and trial (or the defendant\u2019s demand for a speedy trial)\n\nacts as a \u2018triggering mechanism\u2019\u201d Id. In Harris v. State, the Texas Court of\n\nCriminal Appeals recognized that a delay of eight months or longer is\n\npresumptively unreasonable and triggers speedy trial analysis. 827 S.W.2d 949\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1992)(en banc). Therefore, in the instant case, the delay of over\n\none year and four months before the Defendant filed the motion for speedy trial\n\ntriggered a speedy trial analysis and this factor weights against the State.\n\n      The second factor is the reason for the delay. Where the record is silent\n\nregarding the reason for the delay this factor weighs against the State. Zamaro v.\n\nState, 84 S.W.3d at 650.\n\n      The third factor is assertion of the right. The defendant has no duty to bring\n\nhimself to trial; that is the State\u2019s duty. Id. at 651. However, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s\n                                          35\n\fassertion of his speedy trial right is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in\n\ndetermining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right.\u201d Id. This factor\n\nweights in the defendant\u2019s favor.\n\n      The final factor is prejudice caused by the delay. \u201c\u2019Prejudice of course,\n\nshould be assessed in light of the interests of defendants which the speedy trial\n\nright was designed to protect.\u2019 The Supreme Court has identified three such\n\ninterests: 1) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; 2) to minimize anxiety and\n\nconcern of the accused; and 3) to limit the possibility that he defense will be\n\nimpaired. Although the last type of prejudice is the most serious, a defendant\u2019s\n\nclaim of a speedy trial violation need not necessarily demonstrate prejudice to his\n\nability to present defensive matters.\u201d Id. at 652.\n\n      In this case, Appellant informed the court in his motion for speedy trial that\n\nhe has lost one or more witnesses because they moved and he no longer has an\n\naddress for them. Additionally, Appellant sent numerous letters to the court\n\ninforming the court that he was dying from his numerous ailments, which brought\n\nanxiety and concern to Appellant since his access to medical care was limited and\n\nhe was spending his limited time remaining awaiting trial. These letters also show\n\nAppellant\u2019s anxiety and concern while incarcerated. Appellant also stated in a\n\ncouple of the letters to the trial court that he is not receiving the right treatment and\n\n\n\n                                           36\n\fmedication in jail. (MNT, Def.\u2019s Ex. 5, 12, 17, 20.) These factors weight in favor\n\nof Appellant.\n\n       Therefore, Appellant\u2019s right to a speedy trial was violated, and the trial court\n\nerred in denying the Appellant\u2019s motion for a speedy trial.\n\n       Issue Three: The trial court erred by failing to grant an\n       evidentiary hearing on the Motion for New Trial.\n\n       Appellant hereby incorporates by reference the Statement of Facts portion of\n\nthis brief as set forth at 3-8, supra.\n\n       Because Appellant\u2019s motion for new trial was supported by affidavit, raised\n\nmatters outside of the record, and was timely filed and presented to this Court,\n\nAppellant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing. See Reyes v. State, 849 S.W.2d\n\n812, 816 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993). Failure to conduct an evidentiary hearing was\n\nan abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Id.\n\n       Appellant\u2019s motion for new trial, supported by his affidavit, was filed in a\n\ntimely manner. The motion raised matters not determinable from the record,\n\nnamely that counsel was ineffective regarding matters outside of the trial\n\ntranscript. Because appellant\u2019s motion for new trial raised matters not determinable\n\nfrom the record upon which he could be entitled to relief, the trial judge abused his\n\ndiscretion in failing to hold a hearing. Id. Therefore, if the judgment is not reversed\n\nand remanded for a new trial based on the sworn affidavits and information in the\n\n\n                                           37\n\fMotion for New Trial, the cause should be remanded to the trial court for a hearing\n\non appellant\u2019s Motion for New Trial. See id.\n\n       Issue Four: The trial court erred by bringing a material defense\n       witness, D.R. into the courtroom, handcuffed, and in a jail\n       uniform.\n\n       Appellant hereby incorporates by reference the Statement of Facts portion of\n\nthis brief as set forth at 3-8, supra.\n\n       \u201c[P]ossible prejudice to a defendant should be avoided unless there are\n\nsufficient reasons to have his witness appear handcuffed and in jail clothing.\u201d\n\nThompson v. State, 514 S.W.2d 275 (Tex. Crim. App. 1974). The test on appeal is\n\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion in requiring the witness to appear in\n\njail uniform and handcuffed. Id. at 278. To enable the appellate court to review the\n\ntrial court\u2019s action on appeal, \u201cthe record should contain the factual matters on\n\nwhich the trial court\u2019s discretion was based. It must appear in the record that in\n\nexercise of its discretion the trial court had a fair knowledge and understanding of\n\nall such factual matters.\u201d Id. In this case, a material defense witness, D.R., was\n\nbrought into the courtroom in a jail uniform with handcuffs on her wrists and\n\nshackles on her ankles. The handcuffs were removed from her wrists prior to her\n\ntestimony after the jury had already observed the handcuffs on the witness.\n\nHowever, Ms. D.R. remained shackled at the ankles even during her testimony on\n\nbehalf of the defendant. This undoubtedly prejudiced her credibility with the jury\n                                         38\n\fand thereby prejudiced the defendant\u2019s trial. The trial court abused its discretion\n\nand a new trial should be ordered.\n\n       Issue Five: A new trial should be granted based on newly\n       discovered evidence.\n\n       Appellant hereby incorporates by reference the Statement of Facts portion of\n\nthis brief as set forth at 3-8, supra.\n\n       In order to grant a new trial based on newly discovered evidence the record\n\nmust reflect that: (1) the newly discovered evidence was unknown or unavailable\n\nto the movant at the time of his trial; (2) the movant\u2019s failure to discover or obtain\n\nthe evidence was not due to a lack of diligence; (3) the new evidence is admissible\n\nand is not merely cumulative, corroborative, collateral or impeaching; and (4) the\n\nnew evidence is probably true and will probably bring about a different result on\n\nanother trial. Eddlemon v. State, 591 S.W.2d 847, 849 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1979)(Panel No. 3).\n\n       In the instant case, Deanna Hoedzoade informed Laverne Cavitt White after\n\nthe trial that she wanted to change her statement to the police. She wanted to give a\n\nstatement that they did not expect that it would go this far and that the allegation\n\nwas not true. (MNT at 14.) This evidence was not available prior to the trial, this\n\nevidence would be admissible to impeach R.R.\u2019s testimony if Deanna Hoedzoade\n\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\fassisted R.R. in fabricating this story, and this evidence would probably bring\n\nabout a different result on another trial.\n\n                                        PRAYER\n\n      FOR THESE REASONS, Appellant respectfully prays that this Honorable Court\n\nreverse the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction and remand the case for a new trial,\n\nor in the alternative, remanded to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on the\n\nmotion for new trial, and for any other appropriate remedy.\n\n                                         Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                         /s/ Nicole DeBorde\n                                         NICOLE DEBORDE\n                                         TBA No. 00787344\n                                         Bires Schaffer & DeBorde\n                                         JPMorgan Chase Bank Building\n                                         712 Main Street, Suite 2400\n                                         Houston, Texas 77002\n                                         Telephone: (713) 228-8500\n                                         Facsimile: (713) 228-0034\n\n                                         COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT\n\n\n\n\n                                             40\n\f                          CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\n\n      Pursuant to Rule 9 of the Texas Rules of Appellant Procedure, the\n\nundersigned counsel of record certifies that Appellant\u2019s brief contains 8,937 words.\n\n\n\n\n                                      /s/ Nicole DeBorde\n                                      NICOLE DEBORDE\n\n\n\n\n                                        41\n\f                            CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\n      I certify that a copy of this Brief for Appellant has been served upon the\n\nHarris County District Attorney\u2019s Office \u2013 Appellate Section, on this 20th day of\n\nMarch by leaving a copy with the Clerk of the this Court pursuant to local practice.\n\n\n\n\n                                      /s/ Nicole DeBorde\n                                      NICOLE DEBORDE\n\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\f",
