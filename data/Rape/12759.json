Appellant\n                                submitting on briefs.\n\n                                (Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, II, Attorney General; Leah A. Darron, Senior\n                                Assistant Attorney General, on brief), for appellee. Appellee\n                                submitting on brief.\n\n\n                      Curtis Tyrell Montague (\u201cMontague\u201d) appeals his conviction by a jury of robbery, in\n\n              violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58, and felony murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32, among other\n\n              offenses. Montague requested jury instructions on both excusable self-defense, sometimes referred\n\n              to as self-defense with fault, and justifiable self-defense, or self-defense without fault. The trial\n\n              court granted the instruction on excusable self-defense, but denied the jury instruction on justifiable\n\n              self-defense. For purposes of this opinion, the only assignment of error currently before us is that\n\n              the trial court erred in denying Montague\u2019s jury instruction on justifiable self-defense. For the\n\n              following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n                      \u201cJustifiable homicide in self-defense occurs where a person, without any fault on his part\n\n              in provoking or bringing on the difficulty, kills another under reasonable apprehension of death\n\n              or great bodily harm to himself.\u201d Bailey v.

App. 68, 71, 435 S.E.2d 414, 416 (1993).\n\n       The granting and denying of jury instructions rests in the sound discretion of the trial\n\ncourt. Cooper v. Commonwealth, 277 Va. 377, 381, 673 S.E.2d 185, 187 (2009). An appellate\n\ncourt\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions \u201c\u2018is to see that the law has been clearly stated\n\nand that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Molina\n\nv. Commonwealth, 272 Va. 666, 671, 636 S.E.2d 470, 473 (2006)). \u201cJury instructions are\n\nproperly refused if not supported by more than a scintilla of evidence.\u201d Rhodes v.\n\nCommonwealth, 41 Va.

Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 339, 348, 512\n\nS.E.2d 153, 157-58 (1999) (quoting Brandau v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 408, 411-12, 430\n\nS.E.2d 563, 565 (1993)). \u201cIn determining whether evidence amounts to more than a scintilla,\n\n\u2018we must look at the evidence in the light most favorable to [the appellant].\u2019\u201d Herbin v.\n\nCommonwealth, 28 Va. App. 173, 181, 503 S.E.2d 226, 230 (1998) (quoting Foster v.\n\nCommonwealth, 13 Va. App. 380, 383, 412 S.E.2d 198, 200 (1991)).\n\n       The evidence established that on April 8, 2008, Candace Williams (\u201cWilliams\u201d) and Jada\n\nDickerson (\u201cDickerson\u201d) were inside a van designing a plan to rob a local drug dealer, Shawn\n\nLuck (\u201cLuck\u201d). Montague was sitting in the back seat of the van. Williams made a phone call to\n\nLuck requesting a quarter of crack cocaine, and then the three drove to obtain a loaded .38\n\ncaliber revolver from a friend of Williams. When Williams returned to the van with the revolver,\n\nMontague took the gun and placed it in his lap.\n\n                                                -2-\n\f       After the three took property from another drug dealer walking down the street, Williams\n\ncalled Luck again, and they drove to meet him. Luck drove to the agreed upon location with\n\nfriends. Luck got into the van and pulled out a scale and a quarter ounce of crack cocaine.\n\nMontague said, \u201cI wanted a half.\u201d Luck went to his car, returned to the van and sat in the back\n\nseat, and put the crack cocaine on the scale. At that point, the driver of the van, either Williams\n\nor Dickerson, sped off. Montague and Luck then shot each other. Williams and Dickerson\n\ndisagreed about whether Montague or Luck fired the first shot. However, they both testified that\n\nthey intended to rob Luck, that Montague pointed the gun at Luck as the van sped off, and that\n\nMontague demanded Luck\u2019s property.\n\n       Later the same day, Montague gave several conflicting accounts of the events to\n\nDetectives Lisa Reeves and Ed Prachar. Montague first stated that Luck got in the van because\n\nhe asked for a ride to the \u201chood,\u201d and while Montague was sitting in the front seat smoking a\n\ncigarette Luck shot him in the back for no particular reason. Then Montague said that he was\n\ntrying to sell Luck a digital scale, and Luck tried to rob him. He also stated that he, Williams,\n\nand Dickerson were trying to buy drugs from Luck. Montague admitted to shooting Luck, but he\n\ngave three different accounts of the struggle between them. He said when Luck tried to rob him,\n\nhe reached for another gun that Luck had on him and shot Luck. Montague also stated that he\n\nand Luck struggled over one gun that belonged to Luck and he shot Luck with that gun. In yet\n\nanother account, Montague said he shot Luck with a firearm he knew was under his seat in the\n\nvan while they struggled over Luck\u2019s firearm.\n\n       This record does not reveal even a scintilla of evidence that Montague was without any\n\nform of fault in contributing to the affray with Luck. Montague willingly participated in the plan\n\nto rob Luck by holding the gun obtained for that purpose and luring Luck to the van with a\n\npurported drug transaction. Montague told Detective Prachar that he intended to buy drugs from\n\n                                                -3-\n\fLuck. Thus, Montague\u2019s own statement establishes that he was engaging in criminal activity and\n\nthus was certainly at fault in creating the difficulty leading to any necessity to kill Luck.\n\nTherefore, Montague\u2019s own evidence admitting his culpability and its clear nexus to Luck\u2019s\n\ndeath forecloses an instruction on justifiable self-defense and the trial court did not err by\n\nrefusing it. 1\n\n        Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n                                                                                            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n         Given that the issue has not been briefed and argued on appeal, we decline to hold as\nbroadly as the concurrence proposes, that justifiable self-defense can never be asserted by a\ndefendant charged with felony murder.\n                                               -4-\n\fKelsey, J., concurring.\n\n       Citing the felony-murder statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-32, the murder indictment against\n\nMontague alleged he \u201cdid feloniously kill and murder\u201d the victim during the \u201ccommission of\n\nrobbery or in the attempted commission of robbery.\u201d App. at 7. The indictment did not assert\n\npremeditation or any malicious intent to kill. The closing arguments, jury instructions, and\n\nverdict forms all confirm that the sole theory of murder advanced by the Commonwealth was\n\nfelony murder \u2014 the victim was killed by Montague, and the killing occurred during the\n\ncommission of a robbery. The jury found Montague guilty of both robbery and felony murder. 2\n\n       At trial, Montague asserted he shot the victim in self-defense. Montague asked for, and\n\nreceived, a jury instruction outlining the principles of excusable self-defense. He also requested,\n\nbut was refused, an instruction addressing justifiable self-defense. On appeal, Montague claims\n\nthe trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on justifiable self-defense principles. As a\n\nmatter of law, I believe the trial court committed no error.\n\n                  A. GENERAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n\n       In criminal cases, two threshold requirements \u2014 one legal, the other factual \u2014 must be\n\nmet before a jury instruction can be offered. First, criminal jury instructions should accurately\n\ninform the jury of \u201cthe law of the case applicable to the particular facts\u201d relevant to the charge.\n\nJohnson v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 146, 155, 255 S.E.2d 525, 530 (1979). \u201cAn instruction\n\nwhich is inappropriate to the offense for which the defendant was indicted is improper and\n\nshould be refused.\u201d 1 Instructions for Virginia and West Virginia \u00a7 19, at 56-57 (4th ed. 1998)\n\n(citations omitted). Second, the proponent of the instruction must provide a prima facie factual\n\nshowing, usually described as \u201cmore than a scintilla of evidence,\u201d Avent v. Commonwealth, 279\n\n\n       2\n         The jury found Montague guilty of two counts of robbery, in violation of Code\n\u00a7 18.2-58, four counts of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, in violation of Code\n\u00a718.2-53.1, and abduction, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-47.\n                                                -5-\n\fVa. 175, 202, 688 S.E.2d 244, 259 (2010) (citation omitted), sufficient to permit a rational jury\n\nto find in favor of the instruction\u2019s proponent on the issue addressed by the instruction.\n\n       Both requirements must be met before a criminal defendant has a right to any particular\n\njury instruction. In this case, however, I see no need to address the second requirement (whether\n\na sufficient factual basis for the instruction can be teased out of the record) because the first\n\nrequirement (whether the instruction is legally applicable) cannot be met as a matter of law. 3 I\n\ncome to this conclusion based upon the elements of a felony-murder charge and the\n\nincompatibility of justifiable self-defense in this context.\n\n                              B. THE FELONY-MURDER DOCTRINE\n\n       As early as 1776, Virginia recognized the \u201ccommon law of England, insofar as it is not\n\nrepugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall\n\ncontinue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the\n\nGeneral Assembly.\u201d Code \u00a7 1-200 (recodifying former Code \u00a7 1-10); see Satterwhite v.\n\nCommonwealth, 56 Va. App. 557, 560, 695 S.E.2d 555, 556-57 (2010). To be sure, \u201c[t]his\n\nprinciple is older than the Commonwealth itself.\u201d Taylor v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. App. 435,\n\n443-44, 710 S.E.2d 518, 522 (2011) (citing W. Hamilton Bryson, Virginia Civil Procedure 47\n\n(3d ed. 1997), tracing Virginia\u2019s adoption of the common law to the royal instructions to the\n\nVirginia Company, which planted the colony at Jamestown).\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          On appeal, the Commonwealth argues Montague can meet neither the factual nor the\nlegal thresholds for the justifiable self-defense instruction. Though emphasizing in its brief the\nformer point, the Commonwealth argues on the latter: \u201cThe purpose of the felony murder rule is\nto deter inherently dangerous felonies by holding felons responsible for the consequences of the\nfelony, whether intended or not. King v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 351, 354, 368 S.E.2d 704,\n705 (1988). To allow self-defense, perfect or imperfect, to apply to felony murder would defeat\nthat purpose.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 12.\n                                                  -6-\n\f       Though subject to considerable scholarly debate, the felony-murder doctrine developed\n\nlargely from the restatements of the common law by Lord Edward Coke 4 and Sir William\n\nBlackstone. 5 Virginia courts carried these common law principles into our jurisprudence. See,\n\ne.g, Commonwealth v. Jones, 28 Va. (1 Leigh) 598, 611 (1829); accord Robertson v.\n\nCommonwealth, 1 Va. Dec. 851, 855, 20 S.E. 362, 364 (1894); Howell v. Commonwealth, 67\n\nVa. (26 Gratt.) 995, 997 (1875); Whiteford v. Commonwealth, 27 Va. (6 Rand.) 721, 724 (1828).\n\n       Since 1796, Virginia statutes have recognized the common law doctrine of felony\n\nmurder. See 1796 Va. Acts ch. 200 (first felony-murder statute). Code \u00a7 18.2-32 identifies the\n\npredicate felonies for first-degree murder, but does not otherwise codify the common law\n\nelements of the doctrine. Defining second-degree felony murder, Code \u00a7 18.2-33 codifies the\n\ncommon law rule that a killing may constitute felony murder if done \u201caccidentally\u201d or \u201ccontrary\n\nto the intention of the parties,\u201d so long as it takes place \u201cwhile in the prosecution\u201d of a felony not\n\nincluded in Code \u00a7 18.2-32. \u201cThis statute codifies ancient common law.\u201d Heacock v.\n\nCommonwealth, 228 Va. 397, 403, 323 S.E.2d 90, 93 (1984); accord Haskell v. Commonwealth,\n\n218 Va. 1033, 1035 n.1, 243 S.E.2d 477, 478 n.1 (1978) (noting the statute is of \u201cancient\n\norigin\u201d).\n\n       The common law requires neither \u201cpremeditation\u201d nor \u201cintent to kill\u201d for a conviction for\n\nfelony murder. Wooden v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 758, 762, 284 S.E.2d 811, 814 (1981);\n\nJones, 28 Va. (1 Leigh) at 611 (holding the prosecution need not prove \u201cthe death was the\n\n       4\n         See 3 Edward Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England, ch. 8, at 56 (4th ed. 1669)\n(defining \u201chomicide, that is neither forethought, nor voluntary,\u201d but that occurs during the\ncommission of an \u201cunlawful\u201d act, as \u201cmurder\u201d (modern spelling used)).\n       5\n           \u201c[I]f a man be doing any thing unlawful, and a consequence ensues which he did not\nforesee or intend, as the death of a man, or the like, his want of foresight shall be no excuse; for,\nbeing guilty of one offence in doing antecedently what is in itself unlawful, he is criminally\nguilty of whatever consequence may follow the first misbehaviour.\u201d 4 William Blackstone,\nCommentaries *26-27. \u201cAnd if one intends to do another felony, and undesignedly kills a man,\nthis is also murder.\u201d Id. at *200-01 (citing 1 Matthew Hale, Pleas of the Crown 465).\n                                                 -7-\n\fultimate result, which the will, deliberation and premeditation of the party accused sought\u201d);\n\naccord Howell, 67 Va. (26 Gratt.) at 997 (explaining the \u201cintention to kill\u201d is \u201cno part\u201d of the\n\ndefinition of felony murder); Whiteford, 27 Va. (6 Rand.) at 725 (stating in dicta that felony\n\nmurder occurs without \u201cthe ingredient of a willful killing\u201d).\n\n       Though the killer must have acted with malice, \u201cthe malice intrinsic in the commission of\n\none of the predicate felonies \u2018provides the malice prerequisite to a finding that the homicide was\n\nmurder.\u2019\u201d Heacock, 228 Va. at 403, 323 S.E.2d at 93 (quoting Wooden, 222 Va. at 762, 284\n\nS.E.2d at 814). By \u201cimputing malice to the killing,\u201d Turner v. Commonwealth, 282 Va. 227,\n\n250, 717 S.E.2d 111, 123 (2011) (quoting Commonwealth v. Montague, 260 Va. 697, 700, 536\n\nS.E.2d 910, 912 (2000)), the doctrine of felony murder meets the common law requirement of\n\nmalice while decoupling it from the specific act of killing. See generally 2 Charles E. Torcia,\n\nWharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 147, at 296-97 (15th ed. 1994).\n\n       The legal imputation of malice, however, occurs only when the facts satisfy the \u201cres\n\ngestae rule,\u201d which requires the killing to be \u201cso closely related to the felony in time, place, and\n\ncausal connection as to make it a part of the same criminal enterprise.\u201d Montague, 260 Va. at\n\n701, 536 S.E.2d at 913 (quoting Haskell, 218 Va. at 1044, 243 S.E.2d at 483); see also Turner,\n\n282 Va. at 250, 717 S.E.2d at 123. If the facts of the case satisfy the res gestae rule, the malice\n\nintrinsic to the underlying felony serves as a sufficient mens rea substitute for the lack of a\n\nparticular intent to kill or the absence of malice specific to the homicidal act. See generally\n\nRonald J. Bacigal, Criminal Offenses and Defenses 344-46 (2012-13).\n\n                       C. JUSTIFIABLE SELF-DEFENSE AND FELONY MURDER\n\n       The underlying logic of a felony-murder charge reveals the manifest illogic of responding\n\nto such a charge with a claim of justifiable self-defense.\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f       \u201cKilling in self-defense may be either justifiable or excusable homicide.\u201d Avent, 279 Va.\n\nat 199, 688 S.E.2d at 257 (quoting Yarborough v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 971, 975, 234 S.E.2d\n\n286, 290 (1977)). When successful, a claim of self-defense renders an accused \u201cinnocent and\n\nguiltless\u201d of any form of criminal homicide. Bailey v. Commonwealth, 200 Va. 92, 96, 104\n\nS.E.2d 28, 31 (1958). In Virginia, self-defense is not merely a mitigating factor lowering the\n\ngrade of homicide \u2014 it is a complete exoneration.\n\n       The two variations of self-defense, justifiable and excusable, turn on a single variable:\n\nthe killer\u2019s fault in bringing about the situation during which the killing occurs. In cases of\n\njustifiable self-defense, \u201cthe slayer is in no kind of fault whatsoever, not even in the minutest\n\ndegree; and is therefore to be totally acquitted and discharged, with commendation rather than\n\nblame.\u201d Dodson v. Commonwealth, 159 Va. 976, 981, 167 S.E. 260, 261 (1933) (emphasis\n\nadded and citation omitted). \u201cIf a defendant is even slightly at fault,\u201d on the other hand, \u201cthe\n\nkilling is not justifiable homicide.\u201d Avent, 279 Va. at 203, 688 S.E.2d at 259 (emphasis added)\n\n(quoting Perricllia v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 85, 94, 326 S.E.2d 679, 685 (1985)). \u201cExcusable\n\nhomicide in self-defense occurs where the accused [is] in some fault in the first instance in\n\nprovoking or bringing on the difficulty\u201d leading up to the killing. Id. at 200, 688 S.E.2d at 257\n\n(emphasis added and citation omitted).\n\n       It necessarily follows that a claim of justifiable self-defense can never be asserted against\n\na charge of felony murder. No defendant can be convicted of felony murder unless he has\n\ncommitted a felony \u2014 which, by definition, involves legal fault. And, even then, the killing\n\nmust take place within the res gestae of the felony so as \u201cto make it a part of the same criminal\n\nenterprise.\u201d Montague, 260 Va. at 701, 536 S.E.2d at 913 (quoting Haskell, 218 Va. at 1043-44,\n\n243 S.E.2d at 483). The necessary predicate for justifiable self-defense \u2014 the absence of any\n\n\u201cfault whatsoever, not even in the minutest degree,\u201d Dodson, 159 Va. at 981, 167 S.E. at 261\n\n                                                -9-\n\f(citation omitted) \u2014 will never exist in a case where the accused is charged with, and convicted\n\nof, felony murder. Put another way, justifiable self-defense is legally irrelevant to a felony-\n\nmurder charge. If a defendant is guilty of felony murder, he can never be wholly without fault.\n\nAnd, if he is innocent of felony murder, either because he committed no felony at all or because\n\nthe killing was outside the res gestae of the alleged felony, it matters not that he can also show\n\nthe killing was justified.\n\n        Courts applying common law principles uniformly support this view. As one court put it,\n\n\u201cwhen one kills in the commission of a felony, that person cannot claim self-defense, for \u2018this\n\nwould be fundamentally inconsistent with the very purpose of the felony murder [statute].\u2019\u201d\n\nState v. Amado, 756 A.2d 274, 284 (Conn. 2000) (citation omitted); see also Sutton v. State, 776\n\nA.2d 47, 71 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2001) (recognizing that \u201cself-defense is not a defense to felony\n\nmurder\u201d and noting that it \u201cborders on the absurd\u201d to apply the concept in a robbery felony-\n\nmurder case). A claim of self-defense \u201cmay not be invoked by a defendant who, through his\n\nown wrongful conduct (e.g., the initiation of a physical attack or the commission of a felony),\n\nhas created circumstances under which his adversary\u2019s attack or pursuit is legally justified.\u201d\n\nPeople v. Valencia, 180 P.3d 351, 370 (Cal. 2008). \u201cIndeed, nearly every jurisdiction that has\n\nopined on the matter makes a justification [self] defense unavailable to those who initiated the\n\nunderlying felonies.\u201d People v. Walker, 78 A.D.3d 63, 68-69 (N.Y. App. Div. 2010) (citing\n\ncases). 6\n\n\n        6\n          See also United States v.

Phillips, 287\n                                                - 10 -\n\f       Some courts conclude that neither form of self-defense, justifiable or excusable, may be\n\nraised as a matter of law to defend against a charge of felony murder. It is unnecessary, for my\n\npurposes, to go so far in this case. The trial court granted Montague\u2019s instruction on excusable\n\nself-defense. Whether the trial court erred in doing so is not before us. I thus offer no opinion\n\non whether the trial court erred in granting Montague\u2019s request for an excusable self-defense\n\ninstruction. In sum; because justifiable self-defense cannot be asserted as a basis for exoneration\n\nof a felony-murder charge, I would hold the trial court correctly refused the instruction.\n\n\n\n\nP.3d 245, 255 (Kan. 2012) (recognizing that \u201cself-defense is not available to a person who [i]s\nattempting to commit, committing, or escaping from the commission of a forcible felony\u201d\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); State v.
