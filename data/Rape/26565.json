Brosnahan,\n          Defendant-Appellant.                                 )   Judge, presiding.\n\n\n          JUSTICE HYMAN delivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\n          Presiding Justice Mason and Justice Pucinski concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n\n                                             OPINION\n\n\u00b61        Shortly after Terrell Phagan had stolen a green van at gunpoint, he tried to elude Chicago\n\nand Illinois State Police officers during an 11-mile chase through the streets of Chicago. During\n\nthe officers\u2019 pursuit, Phagan shot at them several times. Eventually, officers arrested Phagan\n\nafter pinning the van between one of their cars and a pole.\n\n\u00b62        The State brought two cases against Phagan. In No. 11 CR 17961, the State charged\n\nPhagan with offenses related to the car chase and his use of a gun against the officers. In No. 11\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nCR 17962, the State charged Phagan with offenses relating to his theft of the van and his use of a\n\ngun. The trial court joined the cases for a jury trial.\n\n\u00b63      In case number 17961, the jury found Phagan guilty of two counts of aggravated\n\ndischarge of a firearm and two counts of attempted murder of a peace officer. The trial court\n\nmerged the aggravated discharge counts into the attempted murder counts and sentenced Phagan\n\nto two concurrent terms of 50 years. That sentence consisted of a 30-year base sentence for the\n\nattempted murder of a peace officer coupled with a 20-year firearm add-on. See 720 ILCS 5/8-\n\n4(c)(1)(A), (C) (West 2014).\n\n\u00b64      In case number 17962, the jury found Phagan guilty of armed robbery, aggravated\n\nvehicular hijacking, and aggravated possession of a stolen motor vehicle. The trial court imposed\n\nconcurrent 21-year sentences for each of the three offenses.\n\n\u00b65      The trial court then ordered the concurrent 50-year sentences from one case and\n\nconcurrent 21-year sentences from the other to run consecutively, bringing Phagan\u2019s sentence to\n\na total of 71 years.\n\n\u00b66      Phagan\u2019s brief contains no argument that the State failed to prove him guilty beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, and at oral argument his counsel confirmed that he is not challenging the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence against him. But he raises four arguments about the fairness of the\n\ntrial proceedings and sentencing: (i) the State made a series of improper arguments in closing\n\nstatements and rebuttal that deprived him of a fair trial; (ii) the 20-year firearm enhancement\n\ndoes not apply to attempted murder of a peace officer; (iii) the trial court erred by imposing\n\ndiscretionary consecutive sentences; and (iv) Phagan\u2019s 71-year sentence is excessive.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -2-\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n\u00b67     We find no error in the conduct of closing arguments or in the imposing of consecutive\n\nsentences. We do, however, find error in applying both the 20-year firearm enhancement and the\n\nenhanced sentencing range for attempted murder of a peace officer and vacate the 20-year\n\nfirearm enhancement. We do not fault the trial judge, who followed published decisions from\n\nthis district in arriving at her decision. But on de novo review of the statutory text, we disagree\n\nwith the decisions of our court for reasons we explain. We vacate the 20-year firearm\n\nenhancement but otherwise affirm Phagan\u2019s conviction and sentence.\n\n\u00b68                                         Background\n\n\u00b69     At about 2 a.m. on October 10, 2011, Anthony Wilson was at his aunt\u2019s house waiting for\n\nhis child\u2019s mother to arrive. He was in the driver\u2019s seat of a green 1999 Chevrolet Savannah van,\n\ntalking through the window with a friend. A gray Chevrolet Malibu drove up on the driver\u2019s side\n\nand \u201casked did [they] have any loud,\u201d a term used for marijuana. Wilson told the passenger of\n\nthe Malibu that he had no marijuana, and the Malibu drove away, turning left onto South Normal\n\nAvenue.\n\n\u00b6 10   Wilson\u2019s friend left to go across the street to his house, and the gray Malibu returned. The\n\nsame man who had asked about the marijuana got out, walked up to Wilson\u2019s window and\n\npointed \u201clike a silver .38 or .357\u201d revolver at him. While Wilson was still seated in the van, the\n\nman took about $100 and Wilson\u2019s debit card. Wilson identified Phagan in court as that man.\n\n\u00b6 11   Phagan then told Wilson to get out, which he did. The driver of the Malibu started\n\nlooking through the van. Phagan told Wilson to open up the back, revealing six speaker boxes\n\nthat \u201ccovered up the back, back door.\u201d After seeing the speakers, Phagan told Wilson to \u201cgo on\n\ndown the street,\u201d and Wilson ran four or five houses down as he \u201chollered [his] cousin\u2019s name\u201d\n\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nso that someone would come outside. As he ran he heard a gunshot, saw a flash from a gun in\n\nPhagan\u2019s direction, and heard \u201ca ding\u201d of metal hit the gate of a fence nearby.\n\n\u00b6 12    Wilson saw Phagan and the driver get back in the Malibu, so he started to run back to his\n\nvan. But the Malibu made a U-turn toward the van, and Wilson ran to his friend\u2019s house, where\n\nhe hid behind some bushes. Wilson watched Phagan get out of the Malibu and into his van,\n\ndriving up Normal and turning onto 100th Street. Wilson called the police.\n\n\u00b6 13    Chicago Police officers Sean Carroll and Michael Pantano, on patrol nearby in an\n\nunmarked car, received a call for a \u201crobbery in progress that was reading like a carjacking.\u201d On\n\ntheir way to the call, they saw the van and Malibu described by the dispatcher. The officers\n\nfollowed both onto the entrance ramp of Interstate 57 located at 99th Street and Halsted Street.\n\nThe van and Malibu took the split toward Interstate 94 heading to Indiana; they were traveling\n\nnext to each other going 15 to 20 miles per hour below the speed limit. Eventually, the officers\n\nactivated their emergency lights, and both the van and the Malibu pulled over.\n\n\u00b6 14    Officer Carroll got out of the car, and as soon as he set foot on the pavement, both the\n\nvan and the Malibu drove away. The Malibu continued on I-94, and the van took the feeder ramp\n\noff I-94 onto Stony Island Avenue. The officers stayed with the van. At the intersection of Stony\n\nIsland and 95th Street the van attempted a U-turn. As the van turned, Carroll could see the driver\n\nand identified him in court as Phagan. The van then headed back toward I-94, and Carroll saw\n\n\u201can object which appeared to be a gun come out of the driver\u2019s side window of the van pointing\n\ndirectly back at [their] patrol vehicle.\u201d Carroll heard \u201ctwo loud pop sounds, which [he]\n\nassociated with\u2014as being shots fired.\u201d Concrete shot up into the air, which Carroll believed was\n\na result of a bullet impacting the street.\n\n\n\n                                               -4-\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n\u00b6 15   Carroll and Pantano followed the van back onto I-94 toward downtown. At about 87th\n\nStreet, Carroll saw the back driver\u2019s side window of the van shatter \u201cwith the sound of a loud\n\npop.\u201d He was able to see the driver\u2019s right hand \u201ccome back up towards the front of the [van]\n\nholding what appeared to be the gun.\u201d The officers continued following the van as it exited I-94\n\nat 71st Street. Other responding officers joined Carroll and Pantano. Carroll and Pantano\n\nmaintained their position as the lead pursuit car, zig-zagging through the streets of Chicago\n\nheading in a generally northeast direction. Carroll and Pantano eventually lost sight of the van\n\nnear the intersection of Pershing Road (39th Street) and Vincennes Avenue. Neither Carroll nor\n\nPantano fired their weapons.\n\n\u00b6 16   Sergeant James Walsh, who had arrived at Pershing and Vincennes, watched the chase\n\nunfold and saw \u201cthe individual in the van stick his arm out\u201d holding what appeared to be a\n\nweapon. Walsh fired twice at the driver, who was the only person he could see in the van,\n\ncausing the van to move around him to head east on Pershing.\n\n\u00b6 17   Chicago police officers Steve Jarosz and Ryan Harty also monitored the progress of the\n\nchase on the radio; they relocated to 38th Place and Vincennes and saw police cars following a\n\ngreen van. Eventually, at about 38th Place and Langley Avenue, Jarosz and Harty took over as\n\nlead car. At the time they were able to see that someone was in the driver\u2019s seat, but not the\n\nindividual\u2019s face.\n\n\u00b6 18   While Jarosz and Harty were still on Langley, \u201c[a]t that point, it was one shot, and that\n\nshot, just by [Jarsoz\u2019s] experience, and the echo came right at [them], at [their] car, above [their]\n\ncar. [Jarosz] didn\u2019t know where the shot went, but that\u2019s what happened, and the car continued\n\n*** southbound on Langley.\u201d Jarosz could tell that the shot came from directly in front of them\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nand could not see any cars other than the van. Jarosz heard shots from other directions. The van\n\nturned east onto Pershing, and Jarosz and Harty pulled back from their pursuit. Neither officer\n\nfired.\n\n\u00b6 19     Officer Jaysen Orkowski had been parked directly across a small grassy area from where\n\nJarosz and Harty joined the chase. He saw the van turn south onto Langley from 38th Place, and\n\nhis partner \u201cfloored it\u201d to try to intercept the van. Orkowski saw the driver \u201cstick out a gun,\u201d a\n\nsilver revolver, over his left shoulder pointing it at the car behind the van. Orkowski fired three\n\ntimes, but the van did not stop. Orkowski and his partner, while not the lead car, joined the chase\n\nas the van turned east onto Pershing.\n\n\u00b6 20     Officers Eric Taylor and Ayokunle Akinbusuyi arrived at the intersection of Pershing and\n\nLangley. Taylor and Akinbusuyi started to turn north onto Langley when Taylor saw the driver\n\nin the van \u201creach over out of the window\u201d with what appeared to be a gun and heard what he\n\nbelieved to be a gunshot. Taylor and Akinbusuyi backed up onto Pershing; the van started\n\ndriving toward them. Taylor saw the van\u2019s driver reach his arm toward an open window \u201cand\n\n[he] believe[d] [he] heard a gunshot.\u201d Despite Taylor firing six shots and Akinbusuyi firing three\n\nto five shots, the van did not stop and continued east on Pershing.\n\n\u00b6 21     The van reached 750 East Pershing, where Sergeant James Walsh was parked. Walsh\n\nheard \u201ca large amount of gunfire\u201d and saw the van coming toward him \u201ca matter of seconds\u201d\n\nlater. Walsh also fired into the van, but the van did not stop.\n\n\u00b6 22     Less than a block away, Officer Angelo New and his partner had arrived at the\n\nintersection of Pershing and Cottage Grove Avenue. After hearing \u201cmultiple gunshots to the\n\nwest,\u201d New saw the van driving toward him at a \u201chigh rate of speed.\u201d New fired one round from\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nhis gun into the van, which caused the driver to almost lose control but ultimately did not deter\n\nhim. New watched as the van and \u201ca barrage of police cars\u201d continued driving east.\n\n\u00b6 23   Lieutenant Christopher Kapa, who had been parked next to New and his partner, took\n\nover as the lead pursuit car. The van went from Pershing onto Lake Shore Drive, eventually\n\ntaking the exit for the Interstate 55 ramp going west. Instead of continuing on the interstate, the\n\nvan exited at State Street, turning south. After zig-zagging from State Street, to 26th Street, to\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. Drive, to 29th Street, the van eventually came to a stop in a parking lot at\n\n3001 S. Vernon Avenue.\n\n\u00b6 24   Officer Pablo Mariano\u2019s vehicle, driven by Sergeant Lopez, had become the lead pursuer\n\nat about 31st Street and Lake Shore Drive. As the van exited I-55 at State Street, he saw the\n\ndriver \u201cmotion[ ] several times with his right hand an object, chrome object, which he was\n\ndriving, he was attempting to aim at us several times.\u201d Mariano fired twice at the van to no avail.\n\nAs the van turned from 26th Street onto Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, Lopez attempted to bump\n\nit with his car. The van wobbled but continued to the S. Vernon parking lot, where Lopez\n\nbumped the van again, this time wedging it between his car and a pole. Lopez testified that he\n\npulled Phagan out of the driver\u2019s seat and placed him under arrest.\n\n\u00b6 25   Chicago police forensic investigator Carl Brasic arrived at the scene and collected\n\nevidence from the interior of the van. He recovered \u201ca six-inch barreled 357-magnum revolver\n\non the floor of the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d Five of the six bullets had been fired. Brasic also swabbed the\n\ngun for DNA. The parties stipulated that Illinois State Police forensic analyst Ryan Paulsen\n\nwould testify that the DNA on the revolver was a mix of at least two people but was \u201cpotentially\n\nincomplete and not suitable for comparison.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n\u00b6 26   Through a combination of testimony and stipulations, the record indicates that (i) no\n\nfingerprints suitable for comparison were found on the cartridge casings from the revolver in the\n\nvan; (ii) DNA swabs from inside the van revealed a mixture of at least three people and one\n\nprofile from which Phagan could be excluded; (iii) gunshot residue (GSR) tests of Phagan\u2019s\n\nhands indicated that he \u201cmay not have discharged a firearm\u201d and, if he did, \u201cthen the particles\n\nwere removed by activity, not deposited, or not detected\u201d; (iv) the GSR test to the front driver\n\narea of the van indicated that the area had come into contact with GSR or was in the environment\n\nof a discharged firearm; and (v) officers recovered two shirts from Phagan, one of which was\n\nnegative for GSR and one of which had GSR particles in the shirt\u2019s upper area. (The presence of\n\nGSR does not necessarily mean that a person fired a gun.)\n\n\u00b6 27   Forensic analysis also went to each location on the route of the chase where officers had\n\nfired their guns. In total, at least 18 cartridge casings and bullets were traced to the various\n\nofficers\u2019 firearms. Of those, five bullets were found in the van. Four were conclusively linked to\n\nofficer firearms, and one was consistent with a 9 mm/.38 caliber, but could not be definitely\n\ntraced to an officer\u2019s gun.\n\n\u00b6 28   Phagan testified in his own defense. He explained that he was in the area of 10010 South\n\nNormal at about 2 a.m. on October 10, 2011, to buy a McDonald\u2019s Monopoly game piece from a\n\nman he knew only as \u201cBlack Boy.\u201d Black Boy had arranged the purchase of the highly coveted\n\nBoardwalk playing piece from an unknown woman for $2500 to $3500. Phagan arrived in the\n\ngray Malibu with his friend Jay, but the woman had not yet appeared.\n\n\u00b6 29   After being told to wait for 20 to 30 minutes, Jay started playing dice with the five or six\n\nother men that were gathered there, including Anthony Wilson. After Jay won some money and\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nit became apparent that the woman with the Monopoly piece was not coming, Phagan and Jay\n\ntried to leave. One of the men, apparently disgruntled over Jay\u2019s success at dice, told them they\n\ncould not leave, pulled out a gun, and held it to Phagan.\n\n\u00b6 30   Phagan was able to push the man with the gun away and run behind a car. As soon as\n\nPhagan pushed him, the man fired a shot. As Phagan hid, he heard tires screeching and saw the\n\ngray Malibu drive away. Thinking Jay had left him, Phagan got into the green van because he\n\n\u201cfelt like it was [his] only way off the block.\u201d As Phagan attempted to maneuver the van, he\n\nheard another shot, and the passenger window blew out. Phagan was able to put the van into\n\ndrive when the man with the gun came up to the passenger side, put his arm in the van, and fired\n\nthe gun again.\n\n\u00b6 31   Phagan pulled onto 100th Street and saw the gray Malibu parked there, Jay in the driver\u2019s\n\nseat. They both drove off and eventually made it to the expressway where they were pulled over\n\nby the police. After one of the officers got out of the police car, Phagan drove off again. Asked to\n\nexplain why he fled from police he said: \u201cI was thinking when I had pulled off the block when\n\nthe guy stuck his arm in the window and I heard a thump, I thought I had ran, like, maybe his leg\n\nover or something ***. So when I was on the expressway and the police pulled me over, I\u2019m\n\nthinking, like, okay, I don\u2019t want to go back to jail.\u201d Phagan explained that, during the time the\n\npolice were chasing him, he was able to hear sirens and \u201csome shots\u201d but he did not remember\n\nmost of the chase. Phagan denied ever shooting at the officers and testified that the gun found in\n\nthe van was the same gun that the man had used to shoot at him back on South Normal.\n\n\u00b6 32   During closing arguments, while discussing the firearm evidence collected, the State\n\nargued: \u201cThe Defendant is literally caught at 3001 South King in the stolen vehicle with a\n\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nsmoking gun.\u201d Defense counsel objected, and the court overruled him. Defense counsel then\n\npresented his closing argument to the jury, repeatedly arguing that the officers have \u201cgot to be\n\njustified taking 25 shots at the van.\u201d Counsel argued that many of the officers\u2019 explanations\n\nabout hearing gunshots from the van were to \u201cjustify [the officers\u2019] actions\u201d because \u201cwhen\n\nthey\u2019re [sic] shots fired, and the officers get into position pretty much have a green light to fire\n\nshots and that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d In rebuttal, the State argued that it did not matter that\n\nthere were minor inconsistencies in some of the officers\u2019 testimony because \u201c[w]ouldn\u2019t it be\n\nsuspect if it was all exactly the same, if everybody saw the same thing[?] They\u2019re just doing their\n\njob. They\u2019re out there serving and protecting. We ask them to do that. We need the police.\u201d\n\nAgain, defense counsel objected, and the trial court overruled his objection. Finally, in regard to\n\nPhagan\u2019s testimony, the State argued in rebuttal: \u201cAgain make absolutely no mistake about it.\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous what he told you. Don\u2019t believe it for a second. He has so much to lose. That\u2019s\n\nwhy he\u2019s doing it.\u201d Again, the trial court overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection.\n\n\u00b6 33   In case number 17961, the jury found Phagan guilty of attempted first degree murder of\n\nofficers Carroll and Pantano. The jury also found, in response to a special jury question, that the\n\nState had proved that Phagan personally discharged a firearm during each of those offenses. The\n\njury also found Phagan guilty of two counts of aggravated discharge of a firearm, again as to\n\nofficers Carroll and Pantano.\n\n\u00b6 34   In case number 17962, the jury found Phagan guilty of armed robbery and aggravated\n\nvehicular hijacking of Anthony Wilson, but the jury found that the State had not proven that\n\nPhagan personally discharged a firearm during those offenses. The jury also found Phagan guilty\n\nof aggravated possession of a stolen motor vehicle.\n\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n\u00b6 35   In a motion for a new trial, Phagan reasserted the argument that he had made before trial\n\nthat it was error to allow the State to seek enhancements for attempted murder based on both the\n\nstatus of the victims as peace officers and the discharge of a firearm. The motion also argued that\n\nthe State improperly referred to a \u201csmoking gun\u201d during its closing argument and improperly\n\nbolstered the credibility of the police officers\u2019 testimony during rebuttal. The motion made no\n\nmention of defense counsel\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s comments about Phagan\u2019s testimony. After\n\nhearing argument, the court denied the motion.\n\n\u00b6 36   At sentencing, Phagan\u2019s mother testified that she and Phagan\u2019s grandmother had shared\n\nthe responsibility of raising him. Phagan had made it to eighth grade and then dropped out. He\n\nworked for his uncle doing landscaping for about two-and-a-half years. At the end, she asked the\n\njudge to be lenient because \u201cTerrell made a mistake, and I think we are all entitled to make a\n\nmistake.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 37   The State, in aggravation, called Detective Grossman from the Sauk Village Police\n\nDepartment. He testified that in July of 2008, he went to a gas station in response to a call about\n\na stolen vehicle in the parking lot. When he got there, he tried to get the two occupants out of the\n\ncar, but they refused and drove off. The driver drove erratically, including through construction\n\nzones, sometimes at speeds \u201c[i]n excess of 110 miles an hour.\u201d The passenger leaned out and\n\nfired a gun at the officer, causing him to lose control of his car and crash. The second police car\n\nalso eventually dropped out of the pursuit. Officers found the stolen car abandoned in Chicago.\n\nAfter Phagan was arrested, he admitted to officers that he had been the driver of the fleeing car\n\nand knew that it had been stolen. Phagan also admitted that he knew the passenger had a gun.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n\u00b6 38   Referring to Phagan\u2019s 2008 case, the court considered it \u201ceerily similar to the one here\n\nbefore the court\u201d and noted that Phagan had been on parole for that offense when he committed\n\nthis one. And the court could not say that Phagan\u2019s conduct would be unlikely to recur.\n\nAccordingly, the trial court found that Phagan\u2019s behavior put \u201ccountless people\u201d in harm\u2019s way\n\nand that Phagan made \u201cdecision after decision\u201d to keep going even though he could have stopped\n\nat any time.\n\n\u00b6 39   In case number 17961, the court imposed a 50-year sentence on each count of attempted\n\nfirst degree murder. Each sentence consisted of 30 years for the attempted murder of a peace\n\nofficer plus a 20-year firearm enhancement for Phagan\u2019s personal discharge of a firearm. The\n\ncourt ordered each 50-year sentence to run concurrently. The court previously had merged the\n\naggravated discharge offenses into the attempted murder offenses.\n\n\u00b6 40   In case number 17962, for each of the three offenses on which the trial court found\n\nPhagan guilty, the court imposed a 21-year sentence to run concurrently.\n\n\u00b6 41   The trial court found that \u201c[Phagan\u2019s] actions ha[ve] put countless individuals in danger,\n\nboth from what occurred in 2008 and certainly with the continuing course of criminal conduct in\n\nthis case. So it is the court\u2019s view that consecutive sentences in this case are required to protect\n\nthe public from further criminal conduct by the defendant.\u201d The court ordered the 50-year\n\nsentence in case number 17961 to run consecutively to the 21-year sentence in case number\n\n17962, leading to a total sentence of 71 years in the Department of Corrections. Phagan\u2019s motion\n\nto reconsider sentence was denied.\n\n\u00b6 42                                         Analysis\n\n\u00b6 43                                 Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n\u00b6 44   Phagan takes issue with three statements the prosecutor made during closing arguments.\n\nHe claims that the State misstated the evidence when it argued \u201c[t]he Defendant is literally\n\ncaught at 3001 South King Drive in the stolen vehicle with the smoking gun.\u201d He claims that the\n\nState, in rebuttal, improperly vouched for its police officer witnesses when it argued \u201c[t]hey\u2019re\n\njust doing their job. They\u2019re out there serving and protecting. We ask them to do that. We need\n\nthe police.\u201d Finally, he claims that the State improperly disparaged his own testimony when it\n\nargued \u201cit\u2019s ridiculous what [Phagan] told you. Don\u2019t believe it for a second. He has so much to\n\nlose. That\u2019s why he\u2019s doing it.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 45   The State contends that all of its closing arguments were proper and any error would be\n\ndeemed harmless. As to the \u201csmoking gun\u201d argument, the State asserts that the term was used\n\nfiguratively and was supported by the evidence because Phagan was found with a gun after\n\nofficers saw him fire one. As to Phagan\u2019s bolstering claim, the prosecutor was simply stating\n\ncommon knowledge supported by the facts and in response to defense counsel\u2019s argument\n\nimplying that the officers had lied to justify their actions. Finally, as to Phagan\u2019s claim that the\n\nState disparaged his testimony, the State initially argues that Phagan forfeited the claim by not\n\nincluding it in Phagan\u2019s posttrial motion; on the merits, the State contends commenting on a\n\ndefendant\u2019s credibility is fair game and material inconsistencies in the testimony supported the\n\ncomments.\n\n\u00b6 46                                   Standard of Review\n\n\u00b6 47   Both parties acknowledge that there is a \u201cconflict\u201d or \u201csplit in authority\u201d surrounding the\n\nstandard of review for claims of prosecutorial misconduct in closing argument. In 2007, the\n\nIllinois Supreme Court said, \u201cWhether statements made by a prosecutor at closing argument\n\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nwere so egregious that they warrant a new trial is a legal issue this court reviews de novo.\u201d\n\nPeople v. Wheeler, 226 Ill. 2d 92, 121 (2007). Before that, our supreme court had said \u201c[t]he\n\nregulation of the substance and style of the closing argument is within the trial court\u2019s discretion,\n\nand the trial court\u2019s determination of the propriety of the remarks will not be disturbed absent a\n\nclear abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) People v. Blue, 189 Ill. 2d 99, 128\n\n(2000). These seemingly contradictory statements have led to differences of opinion among the\n\nappellate court districts as to which decision controls. See People v. Green, 2017 IL App (1st)\n\n152513, \u00b6 80 (collecting cases).\n\n\u00b6 48   Phagan argues that under any standard of review the prosecutor\u2019s arguments constitute\n\nerror. The State argues that any errors were harmless and asks us to adopt an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard to review the initial question of whether there was error at all. We agree that the abuse\n\nof discretion standard is the correct one and join the decisions of other courts that have held\n\nsimilarly. E.g., People v. Averett, 381 Ill. App. 3d 1001, 1007 (2008); People v. Love, 377 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 306, 313 (2007).\n\n\u00b6 49   Because both Blue (abuse of discretion) and Wheeler (de novo) are decisions from our\n\nsupreme court, we must explain our decision to choose one over the other. It cannot be\n\nunderstated that, in the context of alleged impropriety in argument, the pedigree for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard spans more than a hundred years. E.g., People v. McCann, 247 Ill. 130, 170-\n\n71 (1910); Bulliner v. People, 95 Ill. 394, 405-06 (1880). Of the many cases decided around the\n\nturn of the twentieth century, North Chicago Street Ry. Co. v. Cotton, 140 Ill. 486 (1892),\n\nprovides one of the most comprehensive accounts of the reasons courts apply the abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard in this context. We note that Cotton was a civil case but has since been\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nincorporated by citation into many criminal decisions. E.g., People v. Smothers, 55 Ill. 2d 172,\n\n176 (1973).\n\n\u00b6 50   The court in Cotton, adopting an abuse of discretion standard, focused on the presence of\n\nthe trial judge during the entirety of the proceedings. 140 Ill. at 502. Because the trial judge is\n\npresent for the entire trial, he or she has the benefit of \u201chearing the remarks of counsel on both\n\nsides\u201d and is better situated to determine whether anything that happened or was said justifies the\n\nchallenged remark. Id. \u201cEvery reasonable presumption must be indulged in that the trial judge\n\nhas performed his [or her] duty, and has properly exercised the discretion vested in him [or her]\n\n***.\u201d Id. at 503. We add to Cotton\u2019s observations that the trial judge is also in a superior position\n\nto observe the tone of the advocates, the apparent impression of the remarks on the jurors, and\n\nthe rhetorical impact that a passing remark may or may not have had in the broader context of\n\ncounsel\u2019s entire argument. As judges of a reviewing court, the \u201cdry\u201d record provides us with\n\nnone of these benefits.\n\n\u00b6 51   A claim that a de novo standard of review applies does not enjoy similar historical\n\nsupport. In Wheeler, 226 Ill. 2d at 121, our supreme court pointed to People v. Graham, 206 Ill.\n\n2d 465 (2003), as authority for announcing a de novo standard of review. But, as precedents go,\n\nGraham is far from helpful. There, the defendant claimed both that he had been denied a fair trial\n\nbecause the State elicited testimony about his postarrest silence at trial and that the prosecutor\n\nerred in bringing that silence up during closing arguments. Id. at 474. The court then said, \u201cWe\n\nreview this legal issue de novo,\u201d making no differentiation between the distinct claims the\n\ndefendant had raised. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n\u00b6 52      That would be confusing enough, but the court declined to conduct an analysis on the\n\nmerits of either of those arguments. The defendant had forfeited both claims by failing to object\n\nto either the testimony or the State\u2019s closing argument. Id. at 475. The court found that neither\n\nprong of plain error saved the defendant from forfeiture. Id. at 475-76. Ultimately, the question\n\nthe court answered was whether the defendant\u2019s forfeiture could be excused on the ground that\n\ncounsel had performed ineffectively, and the court concluded that counsel had performed\n\neffectively. Id. at 476-77. Questions of ineffective assistance of counsel are reviewed de novo.\n\nPeople v. Demus, 2016 IL App (1st) 140420, \u00b6 27. Reading Graham, therefore, provides no\n\nclarity as to whether it applied a de novo standard of review to the prosecutorial misconduct\n\nclaims\u2014claims it did not decide\u2014or to the ultimate ineffective assistance claim that it did\n\ndecide.\n\n\u00b6 53      Assuming that Graham was applying a de novo standard of review to the prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct claim, it would be the last link in a remarkably brief chain of precedent. The case on\n\nwhich Graham relied for its finding of a de novo standard of review had nothing to do with\n\nclaims of prosecutorial misconduct. See People v. Carlson, 185 Ill. 2d 546, 551 (1999). Rather,\n\nthat case raised the question of whether the trial court erred in denying a defendant\u2019s motion to\n\nsuppress evidence. Id. Again, like claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the determination\n\nof whether suppression is warranted presents a question of law requiring de novo review. People\n\nv. Colyar, 2013 IL 111835, \u00b6 24. The ultimate source of Wheeler\u2019s conclusion about the standard\n\nof review involved a case examining a distinct substantive area of law.\n\n\u00b6 54      We conclude that Blue, applying an abuse of discretion standard to claims of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct in closing argument, properly invoked over a century of Illinois\n\n\n\n                                              - 16 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nSupreme Court precedent. Wheeler, applying a de novo standard of review, imported that\n\nstandard with no explanation from cases that are either unclear or that analyze dissimilar claims.\n\nOur supreme court has announced its own duty to resolve apparent conflicts in its precedent.\n\nWilliams v. Crickman, 81 Ill. 2d 105, 111-12 (1980). Perhaps it is time the court does so. In the\n\nmeantime, we follow Blue and review claims of prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments\n\nunder the abuse of discretion standard.\n\n\u00b6 55                                 Misstatement of Evidence\n\n\u00b6 56   Phagan first claims that the prosecutor misstated the evidence in closing argument by\n\nsaying \u201c[t]he defendant is literally caught at 3001 South King Drive in the stolen vehicle with the\n\nsmoking gun.\u201d While a prosecutor has wide latitude to make closing arguments, those arguments\n\ncannot be based on a misstatement of the evidence. People v. Jackson, 2012 IL App (1st)\n\n102035, \u00b6 18. A single misstatement does not necessarily deprive a defendant of a fair trial\n\nunless the remark \u201c \u2018result[s] in substantial prejudice to the defendant and constitute[s] a material\n\nfactor in his conviction.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting People v. Brooks, 345 Ill. App. 3d 945, 951 (2004)).\n\n\u00b6 57   The parties\u2019 dispute centers on competing readings of Jackson, and we find resolving\n\ntheir dispute resolves this issue. In Jackson, the defendant was convicted of aggravated unlawful\n\nuse of a weapon, which required the police to prove that he knowingly possessed a firearm. Id.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 1, 19. Officers pulled Jackson over for a traffic stop, and one of them saw a bag of cannabis in\n\nthe center console. Id. \u00b6 6. When they asked Jackson to step out of the car, Jackson \u201cmade an\n\naggressive, quick motion,\u201d started the car, and tried to put it in drive. Id. \u00b6 9. The officers ordered\n\nhim out of the car again, and after he and the passenger complied, they found a gun on the\n\ndriver\u2019s side of the car under the floor mat along with a larger bag of cannabis. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10.\n\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nJackson testified that he did not know about the gun in his car and had never seen it there. Id.\n\n\u00b6 13. During rebuttal, the prosecutor argued that in \u201c \u2018Defendant[\u2019s] own words, he told the\n\nofficers he found a gun in his car.\u2019 \u201d Id. \u00b6 18.\n\n\u00b6 58    The court found the prosecutor\u2019s argument to be an obvious misstatement of the\n\nevidence, seeing as the defendant had repeatedly denied knowing about the gun in his car. Id.\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 17, 20. The court went on to find prejudice because the question at the heart of Jackson\u2019s case\n\nwas not only whether a gun was in the car but whether Jackson knew about it. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. The\n\nonly evidence of knowledge was circumstantial evidence based on the officer\u2019s testimony that\n\nJackson had turned his car back on and tried to put it in drive. Id. \u00b6 19. That testimony was\n\ndisputed too. Id. In short, no direct or physical evidence showed that Jackson knew the gun was\n\nin his car. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20.\n\n\u00b6 59    Phagan and the State initially dispute whether the prosecutor actually misstated the\n\nevidence. Jackson guides us because there the prosecutor made a claim (the defendant confessed\n\nto knowing about the gun) that was directly contradictory to the defendant\u2019s testimony and his\n\nentire theory of the case (he did not know about the gun). Id. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. Here, the alleged\n\ninaccuracy is less clear. As the State points out, citing Merriam Webster\u2019s online dictionary, the\n\nterm \u201csmoking gun\u201d carries a widely known colloquial meaning. Indeed the only definitions of\n\nthe phrase provided are \u201csomething that serves as conclusive evidence or proof (as of a crime or\n\nscientific theory)\u201d or \u201ca piece of evidence that clearly proves who did something or shows how\n\nsomething happened.\u201d See Merriam-Webster\u2019s Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-\n\nwebster.com/dictionary/smoking%20gun (last visited Apr. 18, 2019) [https://perma.cc/NLY9-\n\nJ7WD].\n\n\n\n                                                   - 18 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n\u00b6 60    We are not persuaded by Phagan\u2019s argument that the prosecutor misstated the evidence\n\nbecause the gun was not currently hot or issuing smoke when the officers discovered it. The\n\njurors heard the testimony about the points during the chase at which the driver fired the gun.\n\nThey were well aware that the driver was not observed firing the gun immediately before the\n\nchase ended. The plain meaning of the prosecutor\u2019s argument, under any reasonable\n\ninterpretation, was figurative: the police officers found a gun at the feet of the driver\u2019s seat in the\n\nvan where, several moments before, the driver was seen firing a gun. Based on the evidence\n\npresented, the State was entitled to argue to the jury that the discovery of the gun was\n\n\u201cconclusive evidence or proof\u201d of the officers\u2019 testimony that they had seen the driver of the van\n\nfire the gun.\n\n\u00b6 61    Even if we were to find that the prosecutor misstated the evidence by using the phrase\n\n\u201csmoking gun,\u201d we would not find any prejudice like the court did in Jackson. Unlike the court\n\nin Jackson, we are not evaluating proof of a subjective mental state that can only be shown by\n\ncircumstantial evidence. The prosecutor\u2019s argument spoke to one question: Did Phagan fire the\n\ngun found in his car? Multiple witnesses testified that they saw the driver of the van shoot at\n\nthem. Officer Pantano even testified that, at the time the driver shot at him and Officer Carroll,\n\nhe could see the driver, whom he identified as Phagan. Additionally, even if the witnesses who\n\nsaw the driver fire a gun could not see his face, it is undisputed that only Phagan occupied the\n\nvan during the chase.\n\n\u00b6 62    Additionally, unlike Jackson, we are not confronted with a complete lack of physical\n\nevidence surrounding the disputed remark. Illinois State Police analyst Ellen Chapman testified\n\nthat she found gunshot residue from the driver area. She also found gunshot residue on Phagan\u2019s\n\n\n\n                                                - 19 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nwhite short-sleeved T-shirt. We acknowledge that Chapman testified that the presence of gunshot\n\nresidue does not necessarily mean the person came in contact with it by firing a gun. But the\n\ngunshot residue testimony must be taken in conjunction with the facts that officers saw the driver\n\nfiring the gun and it is undisputed that Phagan was the driver.\n\n\u00b6 63   The gun was not literally smoking; it was \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence, and we find no error.\n\nRegardless, any error that may exist would not have prejudiced Phagan.\n\n\u00b6 64                                          Bolstering\n\n\u00b6 65   Phagan next argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by improperly bolstering\n\nthe credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses. During rebuttal the State argued, referring to the police\n\nofficers: \u201cThey\u2019re just doing their job. They\u2019re out there serving and protecting. We ask them to\n\ndo that. We need the police.\u201d According to Phagan, the prosecutor\u2019s argument \u201cattempted to\n\nbolster the credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses based solely on their status as officers, resulting in\n\ngrave prejudice to Phagan, as the entire case hinged on the jury\u2019s credibility determinations.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 66   The State counters that the prosecutor did not bolster its witnesses because the prosecutor\n\ndid not inject personal beliefs and instead \u201cmade benign, accurate, common knowledge\n\nstatements about the job of police officers.\u201d As an alternative argument, the State says that the\n\ndefense counsel\u2019s argument \u201cprovoked or invited\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal.\n\n\u00b6 67   The hallmark of improper bolstering involves an expression of a prosecutor\u2019s personal\n\nbelief in the credibility of a witness. See People v. Rogers, 172 Ill. App. 3d 471, 476 (1988);\n\nPeople v. Townsend, 136 Ill. App. 3d 385, 394 (1985) (improper to \u201cplace[ ] the weight of the\n\nState\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office behind the credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses\u201d). Even where a\n\nprosecutor does not explicitly state his or her personal beliefs about witness credibility, \u201crepeated\n\n\n                                                - 20 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nreferences to [a witness\u2019s] status as a police officer and a sworn deputy\u201d nonetheless can amount\n\nto improper bolstering. See People v. Ford, 113 Ill. App. 3d 659, 662 (1983).\n\n\u00b6 68    Phagan argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during rebuttal were \u201cvery similar to those\n\nthat were found to be reversible error in Ford and Rogers.\u201d We disagree. In Ford the prosecutor\n\ncompared one of the officers involved to the defendant, describing the officer as a person \u201c \u2018of\n\nimpecable [sic] credentials\u2019 \u201d and the defendant as a person who \u201c \u2018her own community didn\u2019t\n\ntrust.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 661. The prosecutor went on to ask the jury, \u201c \u2018Why would [the officer], a sworn\n\nWarren County Deputy, pull a charade like this and lie and perjure herself for a lousy 15 gram\n\npurchase of marijuana?\u2019 \u201d Id. at 662. The court found these comments \u201cexceeded the boundaries\n\nof proper argument.\u201d Id. The prosecutor in Ford directly linked the witness\u2019s status as an officer\n\nand her credibility.\n\n\u00b6 69    The prosecutor went further in Rogers, arguing, \u201c \u2018What can I say about [the officers],\n\nseasoned veterans on the police force. Credibility untouchable. Important testimony.\u2019 \u201d 172 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 476. Again, like in Ford, the prosecutor in Rogers directly linked the witnesses\u2019 status\n\nas officers with their credibility: \u201c \u2018You take all the evidence in consideration and look at the\n\ntestimony of the witnesses and believe me you look at [the officers] and they won\u2019t get on the\n\nstand and lie and make up something.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 477. \u201c[T]aken in context,\u201d according to the\n\nopinion, the State had improperly attempted to inject its personal views about the credibility of\n\nits officer witnesses. Id.\n\n\u00b6 70    When we view the prosecutor\u2019s statements in Phagan\u2019s case, particularly when we view\n\nthem in context, we do not find similar error. The entire paragraph of transcript containing the\n\ndisputed statements reads:\n\n\n\n                                              - 21 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n                The pursuit is fluid. The officers see different things at different times.\n\n       Everybody sees different things at different times. Wouldn\u2019t it be suspect if it was\n\n       all exactly the same, if everybody saw the same thing[?] They\u2019re just doing their\n\n       job. They\u2019re out there serving and protecting. We ask them to do that. We need\n\n       the police.\u201d\n\nIn context, the prosecutor appears to be attempting to explain the reason that officers would\n\ntestify with slight variations even though they viewed the same event. We cannot say, in light of\n\nthe guidance offered by Rogers and Ford, that the prosecutor\u2019s comments amount to improper\n\nbolstering. We do not, however, share the State\u2019s view that these comments embody entirely\n\n\u201cbenign, accurate, common knowledge statements about the job of police officers.\u201d In particular,\n\nthe addition of \u201c[w]e ask them to do that\u201d and \u201c[w]e need the police\u201d to the end of this portion of\n\nthe argument carries the risk of implying to the jury that they should take the officers\u2019 testimony\n\nmore seriously because officers perform critical societal functions.\n\n\u00b6 71   While we could say that the prosecutor\u2019s comments verged on the improper when read on\n\ntheir own, we also agree with State that defense counsel\u2019s argument invited the remarks. See,\n\ne.g., People v. Vargas, 409 Ill. App. 3d 790, 797 (2011) (\u201cprosecutor\u2019s remarks on rebuttal will\n\nnot be deemed improper where the record reveals they were the product of defense counsel\u2019s\n\nprovocation or invitation\u201d). Defense counsel\u2019s theme sought to demonstrate the officers only said\n\nthat there were shots fired from the van to justify their own decisions to shoot their weapons.\n\nWhen referring to the shots fired by officers Taylor and Akinbusuyi, counsel argued that \u201cyou\n\ngot to say that you see something in order to justify these actions\u201d and went on to argue, \u201c[the\n\nofficers] don\u2019t see any muzzle flashes from the van. They don\u2019t see any flashes of light. But\n\n\n\n                                               - 22 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nthey\u2019re firing away because you got to justify your actions.\u201d Immediately after that argument,\n\nthis time referring to officer New, counsel argued he heard shots fired and \u201cwhen [he] saw the\n\nvan, [he] fired off a shot. Got to justify [his] actions. Got to say something.\u201d Counsel rounded\n\nout the argument: \u201cBasically when they\u2019re [sic] shots fired, and the officers get into position\n\npretty much have a green light to fire shots and that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 72   Phagan\u2019s counsel\u2019s entire characterization of the officers\u2019 testimony sought to convey\n\nthat the officers only testified as to what they saw and heard shots from the van to justify the\n\nshots they took; in other words, the officers lied to avoid getting in trouble for shooting at the\n\nvan.\n\n\u00b6 73   In light of defense counsel\u2019s characterization of the officers\u2019 testimony we do not find\n\nstatements like \u201c[t]hey\u2019re out there serving and protecting,\u201d \u201c[w]e ask them to do that,\u201d and\n\n\u201c[w]e need the police,\u201d to establish improper bolstering. If anything, the State engaged in an\n\nattempt to rehabilitate the officers after defense counsel strongly implied that they lied to save\n\nthemselves from some kind of liability. More importantly, we find that overruling Phagan\u2019s\n\nobjection to this line of argument was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n\u00b6 74                                   Phagan\u2019s Credibility\n\n\u00b6 75   Phagan maintains that the prosecutor improperly \u201cattack[ed]\u201d Phagan\u2019s credibility by\n\narguing, \u201cit\u2019s ridiculous what [Phagan] told you. Don\u2019t believe it for a second. He has so much to\n\nlose. That\u2019s why he\u2019s doing it.\u201d In particular, Phagan claims that these remarks referenced his\n\npossible punishment, which a prosecutor cannot do. See People v. Cisewski, 118 Ill. 2d 163, 177\n\n(1987). The State initially responds that the claim has been forfeited, having not been specifically\n\nlisted in the posttrial motion. The State goes on to argue that the claim fails on the merits because\n\n\n\n                                               - 23 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nthe prosecutor may permissibly comment on any witness\u2019s credibility, even the defendant\u2019s\n\nwhen the defendant chooses to testify. See People v. Kirchner, 194 Ill. 2d 502, 549 (2000)\n\n(\u201cState may challenge a defendant\u2019s credibility and the credibility of his theory of defense in\n\nclosing argument when there is evidence to support such a challenge\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 76   We agree with the State that Phagan forfeited this argument by failing to include it in his\n\nposttrial motion. To preserve an issue for review, a defendant must object to the alleged error\n\nwhen it occurs and raise the issue in a posttrial motion. People v. Enoch, 122 Ill. 2d 176, 186\n\n(1988). In terms of claims about prosecutorial misconduct in argument, a defendant must include\n\neach claimed error in the posttrial motion not just a general claim of misconduct. See Love, 377\n\nIll. App. 3d at 312-13 (distinguishing between alleged errors that were and were not included in\n\ndefendant\u2019s posttrial motion). Defense counsel certainly objected to the State\u2019s comments about\n\nPhagan\u2019s credibility during the rebuttal argument, but those comments are not claimed errors in\n\nthe motion for a new trial. Strictly applying Enoch, Phagan\u2019s claim has been forfeited.\n\n\u00b6 77   We could excuse Phagan\u2019s forfeiture and consider this claim on the merits (see People v.\n\nPerry, 2014 IL App (1st) 122584, \u00b6 20 (forfeiture a limit on parties, not court)), but defense\n\ncounsel on appeal does not use his reply brief to respond to the State\u2019s forfeiture argument or\n\ncontend that there are any grounds on which we could excuse his forfeiture. See People v.\n\nRamsey, 239 Ill. 2d 342, 412 (2010) (proper to raise plain error for first time in reply brief). At a\n\nminimum, counsel has forfeited any response to the State\u2019s forfeiture argument. See Ill. S. Ct. R.\n\n341(h)(7) (eff. May 25, 2018). Because trial counsel\u2019s failure to include this claim in Phagan\u2019s\n\nposttrial motion results in forfeiture and because appellate counsel does not ask us to excuse that\n\nforfeiture, we decline to address this claim on the merits.\n\n\n\n                                               - 24 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n\u00b6 78   In sum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled Phagan\u2019s objections\n\nto the prosecutor\u2019s arguments about \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence and the officers\u2019 motives for\n\ntestifying. Phagan\u2019s claim that the prosecutor improperly disparaged his testimony has been\n\nforfeited and counsel makes no argument that we can review that claim for plain error. Finding\n\nno error in the prosecutor\u2019s argument, we affirm Phagan\u2019s convictions.\n\n\u00b6 79                                  Firearm Enhancement\n\n\u00b6 80   Phagan goes on to mount several attacks on his sentence, first claiming that the 20-year\n\nfirearm add-on imposed on his sentence for attempted murder of a peace officer does not apply\n\nto that offense. The statute defining attempt offenses in Illinois contains a separate provision\n\noutlining specific sentencing requirements for attempted first degree murder. As a baseline, the\n\nstatute requires attempted first degree murder to be sentenced as a Class X offense, carrying a\n\nsentencing range of 6 to 30 years. 720 ILCS 5/8-4(c)(1) (West 2014); 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-25(a)\n\n(West 2014).\n\n\u00b6 81   If the victim is a peace officer, the statute extends the sentencing range to 20 to 80 years.\n\n720 ILCS 5/8-4(c)(1)(A); 9-1(b)(1) (West 2014). If the defendant personally discharges a firearm\n\nduring the commission of the offense, the statute requires the imposition of an additional 20\n\nyears. Id. \u00a7 8-4(c)(1)(C).\n\n\u00b6 82   Phagan argues that the 20-year enhancement for personally discharging a firearm does\n\nnot apply to his conviction for attempted first degree murder of a peace officer because the plain\n\nlanguage of the attempt statute only allows the court to impose one enhancement or the other, not\n\nboth. Phagan relies on a decision of this court, People v. Douglas, 371 Ill. App. 3d 21, 26 (2007),\n\nwhich held that once a court applies the status-based enhancement in subsection (A), it cannot\n\n\n\n                                              - 25 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\napply any of the others. Phagan acknowledges that, since Douglas, two other panels of this court\n\nhave rejected it and held that both the status-based and firearm-based enhancements can be\n\napplied to a single sentence. People v. Smith, 2012 IL App (1st) 102354, \u00b6\u00b6 107-16; People v.\n\nTolentino, 409 Ill. App. 3d 598, 603-06 (2011). He asks us to depart from those decisions.\n\n\u00b6 83   The State, of course, asks that we follow Smith and Tolentino and find that the plain\n\nlanguage of the statute allows for imposing both the status-based and firearm-based\n\nenhancements to attempted first degree murder. According to the State, no language in the statute\n\nindicates that these enhancements are mutually exclusive, and applying both keeps with the\n\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s intent to punish offenses more harshly when the offender uses a gun.\n\n\u00b6 84   Before the filing of the State\u2019s brief and Phagan\u2019s reply brief, another panel of this court\n\nweighed in. The court in People v. Jackson, 2018 IL App (1st) 150487, joined Smith and\n\nTolentino to reject the reasoning in Douglas. We disagree with the conclusion in Jackson\n\nbecause we find its statutory analysis to be incomplete. We also disagree with the conclusions in\n\nSmith and Tolentino because both cases analyzed the statute as it existed before the General\n\nAssembly made a consequential amendment.\n\n\u00b6 85   We agree with the court\u2019s conclusion in Douglas, though for different reasons. We hold\n\nthat the plain language of section 8-4(c)(1) of the attempt statute does not allow for imposing\n\nmore than one of the exceptions in subsections (A)-(E). Therefore, we vacate the application of\n\nthe 20-year firearm enhancement in subsection (C) to Phagan\u2019s sentence for attempted first\n\ndegree murder.\n\n\u00b6 86   We begin our analysis with a significant point that the parties do not dispute: the statutory\n\nsubsections are sentencing enhancements and do not lay out unique elements for separate\n\n\n\n                                              - 26 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\noffenses. We pause to explain our agreement with that proposition due to Douglas, on which\n\nPhagan relies, possibly suggesting that the enhancements are elements of unique offenses. In\n\nDouglas, the court discussed the legislative purpose behind the enhancements for attempted\n\nmurder of a peace officer and described the General Assembly\u2019s enactment as \u201ccreating a Class\n\nX offense carrying 20 to 80 years\u201d and said that subsections (B), (C), and (D) are \u201ceach a\n\ndifferent offense.\u201d 371 Ill. App. 3d at 26. To the extent the court in Douglas meant to advance\n\nthis interpretation, we conclude the decision is incorrect.\n\n\u00b6 87   As a general rule, if a statute lays out the elements of a criminal offense and then\n\nseparately provides sentencing classifications based on other factors, those additional factors do\n\nnot create new offenses. People v. Owens, 2016 IL App (4th) 140090, \u00b6 33 (citing People v. Van\n\nSchoyck, 232 Ill. 2d 330, 337 (2009)). Instead, those additional factors serve only to enhance the\n\nultimate punishment. Id. The attempt statute expressly sets out the elements of the offense under\n\na heading bearing that specific language. See 720 ILCS 5/8-4(a) (West 2014) (\u201cElements of the\n\noffense.\u201d). Then the separate factors are laid out in a subsection labeled \u201cSentence.\u201d See id. \u00a7 8-\n\n4(c). The structure of the statute makes plain that we are dealing, not with separate offenses, but\n\nwith additional factors that provide exceptions to the general Class X sentence imposed for\n\nattempted first degree murder.\n\n\u00b6 88   We are mindful that, under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 495 (2000), labeling\n\nan additional factor an \u201cenhancement\u201d does not diminish the State\u2019s burden to prove that factor\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. But the General Assembly has accounted for this constitutional rule\n\nand has placed strict limits on the ability to charge and obtain a conviction based on nonelement\n\nsentencing enhancements. The Code of Criminal Procedure provides that, where the State alleges\n\n\n\n                                                - 27 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\na nonelement fact that increases the range of penalties beyond the statutory maximum that could\n\notherwise be imposed, the State must notify the defendant before trial, submit the enhancement\n\nto the fact finder, and prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. 725 ILCS 5/111-3(c-5) (West 2014).\n\n\u00b6 89    Here, the State both amended the indictment and submitted a written motion seeking the\n\nrelevant enhancements. The jury instructions included the victims\u2019 status as peace officers as\n\npropositions that the State had to prove, and the State submitted special jury questions regarding\n\nthe proof of personal discharge of a firearm beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, we are presented\n\nwith nonelement sentencing enhancements that have been proven in a manner consistent with the\n\nconstitutional rule of Apprendi. Cf. Jackson, 2018 IL App (1st) 150487, \u00b6\u00b6 55-59.\n\n\u00b6 90    Turning to whether both enhancements can apply to attempted first degree murder, we\n\nare confronted with a question of statutory interpretation. Our objective in construing a statute is\n\nto give effect to the General Assembly\u2019s intent, which we do by looking to the language in the\n\nstatute and ascribing its plain and ordinary meaning. Id. \u00b6 48. Unless the language of the statute\n\nis ambiguous, we do not resort to extrinsic aids of statutory construction. Id. (citing People v.\n\nGlisson, 202 Ill. 2d 499, 505 (2002)). We employ the de novo standard of review when\n\nconstruing a statute. Id. \u00b6 47.\n\n\u00b6 91    The sentencing provision of the attempt statute, section 8-4(c)(1), states:\n\n                \u201c(c) Sentence.\n\n                A person convicted of attempt may be fined or imprisoned or both not to\n\n        exceed the maximum provided for the offense attempted but, except for an\n\n        attempt to commit the offense defined in Section 33A-2 of this Code:\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 28 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n                       (1) the sentence for attempt to commit first degree murder is the\n\n                sentence for a Class X felony, except that\n\n                               (A) an attempt to commit first degree murder when at least\n\n                       one of the aggravating factors specified in paragraphs (1), (2), and\n\n                       (12) of subsection (b) of Section 9-1 is present is a Class X felony\n\n                       for which the sentence shall be a term of imprisonment of not less\n\n                       than 20 years and not more than 80 years;\n\n                               (B) an attempt to commit first degree murder while armed\n\n                       with a firearm is a Class X felony for which 15 years shall be\n\n                       added to the term of imprisonment imposed by the court;\n\n                               (C) an attempt to commit first degree murder during which\n\n                       the person personally discharged a firearm is a Class X felony for\n\n                       which 20 years shall be added to the term of imprisonment\n\n                       imposed by the court;\n\n                               (D) an attempt to commit first degree murder during which\n\n                       the person personally discharged a firearm that proximately caused\n\n                       great bodily harm, permanent disability, permanent disfigurement,\n\n                       or death to another person is a Class X felony for which 25 years\n\n                       or up to a term of natural life shall be added to the term of\n\n                       imprisonment imposed by the court; and\n\n                               (E) if the defendant proves by a preponderance of the\n\n                       evidence at sentencing that, at the time of the attempted murder, he\n\n\n                                               - 29 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n                       or she was acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting\n\n                       from serious provocation by the individual whom the defendant\n\n                       endeavored to kill, or another, and, had the individual the\n\n                       defendant endeavored to kill died, the defendant would have\n\n                       negligently or accidentally caused that death, then the sentence for\n\n                       the attempted murder is the sentence for a Class 1 felony[.].\u201d 720\n\n                       ILCS 5/8-4(c)(1)(A)-(E) (West 2014).\n\n\u00b6 92   As we have alluded to, the bulk of the relevant cases provide little help because they were\n\nnot confronted with the applicable text. The statute\u2019s 2010 amendments changed the period at the\n\nend of subsection (D) into a semicolon and added everything from \u201cand\u201d to the end of subsection\n\n(E). Pub. Act 96-710 (eff. Jan. 1, 2010) (amending 720 ILCS 5/8-4). Douglas, decided in 2007,\n\ninterpreted the version of the statute in effect in 2000. 371 Ill. App. 3d at 26. Smith and\n\nTolentino, decided in 2012 and 2011 respectively, also interpreted versions of the statute in effect\n\nbefore the amendment. See Smith, 2012 IL App (1st) 102354, \u00b6 107 (citing 720 ILCS 5/8-4(c)\n\n(West 2004)); Tolentino, 409 Ill. App. 3d at 604 (citing 720 ILCS 5/8-4(c) (West 2006)). Only\n\none case, which neither party cites but was addressed during oral argument, interprets the\n\npostamendment version\u2014Jackson, 2018 IL App (1st) 150487, \u00b6 49 (citing 720 ILCS 5/8-4(c)\n\n(West 2010)). We will, accordingly, begin our analysis with Jackson although, as we will\n\nexplain, that analysis only gets us so far.\n\n\u00b6 93   Jackson points to section 8-4(c) as stating a general rule: attempted first degree murder is\n\na Class X offense carrying a sentencing range of 6 to 30 years in prison. Id. \u00b6 50. The statute then\n\ngoes on to list exceptions, beginning with subsection (A), which allows for an enhanced\n\n\n\n                                               - 30 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nsentencing range of 20 to 80 years when the victim is, among others, a peace officer. Id.\n\nJackson\u2019s analysis focuses on what comes next: a semicolon. Because a series of subsections\n\npunctuated by semicolons follow subsection (A), ordinary principles of grammar would suggest\n\nthat these are \u201crelated but separate concept[s].\u201d Id. \u00b6 51. Ordinarily this means we would read\n\nsubsections (A)-(E) disjunctively, that is, only one could apply at a time. Id.\n\n\u00b6 94   Jackson went on to find that the \u201cand\u201d transition from subsection (D) to subsection (E)\n\ndisrupted the usual inference that we would derive from a semicolon. Id. The court reasoned that,\n\nby inserting \u201cand\u201d at the end of a list punctuated by semicolons, the General Assembly expressed\n\nan intent that the subsections apply conjunctively, meaning that more than one can apply to a\n\ngiven defendant at a given time. Id. The court in Jackson found this to be a natural reading\n\nbecause subsections (B)-(D) add a term of years onto the new sentencing range required when\n\nsubsection (A) applies. Id. \u00b6 52.\n\n\u00b6 95   Absent from the analysis in Jackson (and from the parties\u2019 briefs before us) is a\n\ndiscussion of the effect of the addition of subsection (E) on the analysis. Certainly, we must\n\ninterpret statutes to give every section its intended effect. People v. Stoecker, 2014 IL 115756,\n\n\u00b6 25 (\u201cevery clause of a statute must be given a reasonable meaning, if possible, and should not\n\nbe rendered meaningless or superfluous\u201d). Additionally, we interpret statutes as a whole,\n\nrejecting an interpretation that exalts one provision of a statutory scheme over another. People v.\n\nMiles, 2017 IL App (1st) 132719, \u00b6 25 (\u201cWhen interpreting a statute, we do not read a portion of\n\nit in isolation; instead, we read it in its entirety, keeping in mind the subject it addresses and the\n\ndrafters\u2019 apparent objective in enacting it.\u201d). When we adhere to these principles and take\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 31 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\naccount of subsection (E), reading these provisions conjunctively, as the court did in Jackson,\n\nbrings about an unworkable result.\n\n\u00b6 96   Subsection (E) borrows language that is \u201csubstantially similar to the statutory language\n\nfor one of the grounds for second degree murder.\u201d People v. Lauderdale, 2012 IL App (1st)\n\n100939, \u00b6 23 (citing 720 ILCS 5/9-2(a)(1) (West 2010)). Because the court in Lauderdale found\n\nthat the defendant had failed to prove the existence of facts justifying mitigation under\n\nsubsection (E), the court expressly declined to decide whether the 25-year firearm enhancement\n\nin subsection (D) could be applied if the mitigating circumstances in subsection (E) also were\n\nfound. Id. \u00b6 35.\n\n\u00b6 97   We are aware that our supreme court has said, \u201cunder the Illinois attempt statute, no\n\ncrime of attempted second degree murder exists.\u201d People v. Lopez, 166 Ill. 2d 441, 451 (1995).\n\nAs we have said, subsections (A)-(E) do not create new offenses; they provide exceptions to the\n\ndefault Class X sentencing range for attempted first degree murder. That said, we examine the\n\ndifferences between first and second degree murder to further our understanding of the\n\nrelationship between subsections (A)-(E) in the attempt statute.\n\n\u00b6 98   Under our law, while it is listed in its own statute, Illinois has no separate offense of\n\nsecond degree murder. See People v. Jeffries, 164 Ill. 2d 104, 122 (1995) (second degree murder\n\nis not lesser-included offense of first degree murder but, rather, a lesser-mitigated offense of first\n\ndegree murder). In other words, finding a defendant guilty of second degree murder means he or\n\nshe must have committed acts that establish every element of first degree murder. Lopez, 166 Ill.\n\n2d at 447. Then, once the State has proven the elements of first degree murder, the defendant has\n\nthe opportunity to prove one of two mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of the\n\n\n\n                                                - 32 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nevidence. Id.; see also 720 ILCS 5/9-2(a)(1)-(2) (West 2014). By its plain terms, the statute\n\ncodifying second degree murder only allows a defendant to present mitigating circumstances if\n\nhe or she allegedly committed nonaggravated first degree murder. See 720 ILCS 5/9-2(a) (West\n\n2014) (citing id. \u00a7 9-1(a)(1)-(2)). Hence, there cannot be, for instance, second degree murder of a\n\npeace officer.\n\n\u00b6 99   With these base principles in mind, we turn to the sentencing exceptions in section 8-\n\n4(c)(1)(A)-(E). To receive the enhancement for attempted murder of a peace officer, the\n\ndefendant must attempt an act that, if he or she had succeeded, would be first degree murder of a\n\npeace officer. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 8-4(c)(1)(A); 9-1(b)(1). To receive the mitigation of a Class 1 sentence\n\nbased on serious provocation, the defendant must have attempted an act that, if he or she had\n\nsucceeded, would have been second degree murder (first degree plus a mitigating circumstance).\n\nSee id. \u00a7 8-4(c)(1)(E). These two exceptions to the base Class X sentencing range for attempted\n\nfirst degree murder cannot exist together because, if the defendant attempted the aggravated form\n\nof first degree murder, the defendant cannot also have attempted first degree murder plus a\n\nmitigating circumstance. We know this because, as we have explained, the mitigating\n\ncircumstances that allow for a second degree murder conviction do not apply to the aggravated\n\nversions of first degree murder.\n\n\u00b6 100 Jackson relied on the word \u201cand\u201d to support its conjunctive interpretation of the\n\nsubsections without taking account of what came after the \u201cand.\u201d One simply cannot read\n\nsubsection (A) and subsection (E) conjunctively. Applying the conjunctive reading proposed in\n\nJackson to the remainder of the subsections would require us to acquiesce in an impossible\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 33 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nreading of the statutory scheme as a whole, an absurd result we are obligated to avoid. See In re\n\nAndrew B., 237 Ill. 2d 340, 348 (2010) (we presume legislature did not intend absurd results).\n\n\u00b6 101 Accounting for subsection (E), as we must, leads to absurd results. But reading the statute\n\nconjunctively leads to another absurdity that existed even before the amendment of the attempt\n\nstatute. Phagan points out that reading the subsections conjunctively would allow the trial court\n\nto impose the 15-year, 20-year, and 25-year enhancements in subsections (B), (C), and (D)\n\nrespectively, on top of each other as long as the State proved the factual predicate for the most\n\nserious of the three. In Jackson, the court dismissed this concern as \u201cunfounded\u201d because of the\n\nrule that the court is to interpret statutes so as to prohibit multiple enhancements absent clear\n\nlegislative intent to the contrary. 2018 IL App (1st) 150487, \u00b6 53. We cannot reconcile this\n\nassurance with Jackson\u2019s finding of a clear legislative intent to read the statute conjunctively. It\n\ncannot both be true that the legislature wanted the subsections to apply conjunctively, which\n\nwould require the imposition of every subsection that applied, but at the same time did not intend\n\nmultiple enhancements.\n\n\u00b6 102 The State\u2019s attempt to save this reading of the statute fares no better. In contrast to\n\nJackson, at oral argument the State embraced the multiple-enhancement interpretation and\n\nassured us that trial courts simply are not sentencing defendants under every enhancement that\n\napplies. We have similarly been unable to find any case in which a court has applied more than\n\none of the enhancements in subsections (B)-(D). But the State\u2019s assurance that trial courts are not\n\napplying these enhancements on top of one another raises another interpretive problem: the\n\nenhancements under subsections (B)-(D) are mandatory. Each subsection states that the term of\n\nyears \u201cshall be added\u201d if the trial court finds the requisite facts. If subsections (B)-(D) are to be\n\n\n\n                                               - 34 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nread conjunctively and the imposition of each subsection to be mandatory, then trial courts (or at\n\nleast the trial court in this case) are acting contrary to the mandates of the statute.\n\n\u00b6 103 We have explained the problems a conjunctive interpretation of the statute poses. It is\n\nimpossible to read subsection (A) and subsection (E) conjunctively because the attempt offense\n\ndescribed in each subsection cannot both have been committed by the same person at the same\n\ntime. We cannot read subsections (B)-(D) conjunctively because doing so appears to sanction an\n\nunintended multiple enhancement. Both problems are at once solved by a disjunctive reading of\n\nsubsections (A)-(E).\n\n\u00b6 104 Further support comes from the statutory amendment. Douglas was the only opinion\n\ninterpreting the former version section 8-4(c). When we interpret amended statutes, we presume\n\nthat the General Assembly knows of appellate and supreme court decisions interpreting those\n\nstatutes at the time of the amendment. People v. Gliniewicz, 2018 IL App (2d) 170490, \u00b6 38. If\n\nthe legislature leaves the statute unchanged in spite of our decision, we presume that the\n\nlegislators acquiesced in our interpretation. See Bruso v. Alexian Brothers Hospital, 178 Ill. 2d\n\n445, 458-59 (1997). Other provisions of the Criminal Code demonstrate the General Assembly\u2019s\n\nability to make the compound application of status- and firearm-based enhancements\n\nunmistakable. For example, the aggravated assault offense delineates separate offenses based on\n\nthe location of the offense (720 ILCS 5/12-2(a) (West 2014)), based on victim status (id. \u00a7 12-\n\n2(b)(1)-(10)), and based on the use of a firearm (id. \u00a7 12-2(c)(1)-(9)). The sentencing provision\n\nthen sets out separate classes of offense for each enumerated subsection. Id. \u00a7 12-2(d). That\n\nprovision further provides additional enhancements for certain status-based offenses when a\n\nCategory I, II, or III weapon is used. Id. The General Assembly, through this statutory scheme,\n\n\n\n                                                 - 35 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nmakes plain that the status and weapon aggravating factors are distinct, going on to include\n\nseparate subsections where it obviously intends enhancements to be based on the use of a\n\nweapon and victim status combined.\n\n\u00b6 105 Another example, slightly more analogous, involves the statute criminalizing predatory\n\ncriminal sexual assault of a child. See id. \u00a7 11-1.40. There, the legislature set out specific\n\nelements that create the offense. Id. \u00a7 11-1.40(a)(1)-(2). The first element depends purely on the\n\nchild\u2019s age. Id. \u00a7 11-1.40(a). The second element is based on the age of the child and then nests\n\nwithin it certain additional factors, including the presence or discharge of a firearm. Id. \u00a7 11-\n\n1.40(a)(2)(A)-(B). Then, in the sentencing section, the statute delineates distinct sentencing\n\nranges and enhancements for each subsection.\n\n\u00b6 106 These statutory provisions provide evidence that the General Assembly has the ability to\n\nimpose status-plus-firearm enhancements when it intends to do so. We cannot read that intent\n\nhere, however, particularly when we must presume the legislature was aware of Douglas when it\n\namended the attempt statute. The General Assembly could have easily expressed its intent to\n\ninterpret the statute in the way the State would like by nesting subsections (B) through (D) under\n\nsubsection (A), but it chose not to.\n\n\u00b6 107 We find that the attempted first degree murder statute found in section 8-4(c)(1)(A)-(E),\n\nas it is currently written, does not allow for the imposition of the 20- to 80-year extended\n\nsentencing range combined with the 20-year firearm enhancement. See id. \u00a7 8-4(c)(1)(A)-(E).\n\n\u00b6 108                                       Remedy\n\n\u00b6 109 Phagan argues that we should \u201ceither vacate the 20-year sentencing enhancements or\n\nremand this cause for resentencing.\u201d The State takes no position on remedy, simply asking us to\n\n\n                                              - 36 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\naffirm. While Phagan does not cite any authority or offer any explanation as to why we would\n\nvacate the firearm enhancement as opposed to the peace officer enhancement, we agree that\n\nvacating the 20-year firearm enhancement is the proper course.\n\n\u00b6 110 We have found no authority directly on point in the context of sentencing enhancements,\n\nbut the law is well settled in the analogous context of one-act, one-crime violations. Our supreme\n\ncourt has \u201calways held\u201d that, when the entry of two convictions violates the one-act, one-crime\n\nrule, the less serious offense must be vacated. People v. Lee, 213 Ill. 2d 218, 226-27 (2004). We\n\nare permitted to make that determination for ourselves, without remand to the trial court, when\n\nwe are able to determine the more serious offense. People v. Grant, 2017 IL App (1st) 142956,\n\n\u00b6 33. In the one-act, one-crime context, we determine the more serious offense by looking at the\n\npossible punishments\u2014the greater the penalty, the more serious the offense. People v. Artis, 232\n\nIll. 2d 156, 170 (2009). If the punishments are identical, we can also look to the mental state\n\nrequired\u2014the more culpable the mental state, the more serious the offense. Id. at 170-71.\n\n\u00b6 111 These principles are easily applicable to Phagan\u2019s case, even though we are dealing with\n\nsentencing enhancements, not separate offenses. The peace officer sentencing enhancement\n\nincreases the sentencing range from 6-30 years to 20-80 years. 720 ILCS 5/8-4(c)(1)(A); 9-\n\n1(b)(1) (West 2014). The firearm enhancement, applied separately as we now hold it must be,\n\nincreases the sentencing range from 6-30 years to 26-50 years. See id. \u00a7 8-4(c)(1)(C) (adding 20\n\nyears to base Class X range). The peace officer sentencing enhancement increases the possible\n\npenalty far beyond the firearm sentencing enhancement and appears to be the enhancement the\n\nGeneral Assembly viewed as the more serious.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 37 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n\u00b6 112 We go on to analyze the mens rea for each enhancement, however, because of the\n\nsubstantial overlap between the two sentencing ranges. The firearm sentencing enhancement, by\n\nits plain text, imposes no additional mental state requirement beyond the base attempted murder\n\noffense. It is enough that the defendant committed attempted murder while discharging a firearm.\n\nThe peace officer enhancement, on its own terms, also does not add a mental state requirement.\n\nBut the peace officer enhancement does directly cross-reference to the underlying offense. See\n\nid. \u00a7 8-4(c)(1)(A) (citing id. \u00a7 9-1(b)(1)). The underlying offense requires the defendant to have\n\nknowledge that the victim was a peace officer. Id. \u00a7 9-1(b)(1). So we know that a defendant who\n\nattempts to murder a peace officer must know that he is attempting to murder a peace officer. We\n\nconclude that the peace officer enhancement requires a more culpable mens rea than the firearm\n\nenhancement.\n\n\u00b6 113 Because the firearm enhancement is the less serious enhancement, based both on the\n\npossible penalties associated with it and the lesser mental state required, we vacate the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s imposition of the 20-year firearm enhancement.\n\n\u00b6 114                         Discretionary Consecutive Sentences\n\n\u00b6 115 Phagan argues that the trial court erred by ordering his sentence for attempted murder to\n\nrun consecutively to his other concurrent sentences. He argues that the independently lengthy\n\nprison terms are sufficient to protect the public because, despite his criminal background, this\n\ncase did not result in any injuries or damage. The State responds that the trial court properly\n\nfound that Phagan\u2019s conviction for a 2008 case was \u201ceerily similar\u201d to this one and that Phagan\n\nput numerous lives at risk by his conduct, making a consecutive sentence necessary to protect the\n\npublic. We agree with the State and find, given the extreme danger caused by Phagan\u2019s conduct\n\n\n\n                                              - 38 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nand his apparent penchant to be involved in this kind of behavior, the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion by imposing consecutive sentences.\n\n\u00b6 116 The Unified Code of Corrections allows for the imposition of discretionary consecutive\n\nsentences where, \u201chaving regard to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history\n\nand character of the defendant,\u201d the court believes that consecutive sentences \u201cprotect the public\n\nfrom further criminal conduct by the defendant.\u201d 730 ILCS 5/5-8-4(c)(1) (West 2014).\n\nConsecutive sentences should be imposed in exceptional cases, and the record must show that\n\nthe trial court has adequately balanced mitigating factors and rehabilitative potential against the\n\nneed to protect the public. People v. O\u2019Neal, 125 Ill. 2d 291, 298-301 (1988); see also People v.\n\nBuckner, 2013 IL App (2d) 130083, \u00b6 36. Given the fact-intensive balancing required from the\n\ntrial court, we follow an abuse of discretion standard. O\u2019Neal, 125 Ill. 2d at 297-98.\n\n\u00b6 117 The trial court relied heavily on the danger to the public and the police caused by\n\nPhagan\u2019s behavior. The record supports this conclusion. Ample testimony attests to Phagan\n\nrepeatedly driving over the speed limit, ignoring traffic control devices, and driving off-road. In\n\npursuit, the officers also had to drive at high speeds and sometimes in the wrong lane of traffic.\n\nWhile it was early morning, and the videos of the chase show little traffic, the trial court\n\ncorrectly found that the chase posed a significant risk of danger to anyone in the vicinity,\n\nincluding Phagan and the pursuing officers. That would be danger enough, but Phagan\n\ncompounded that danger by firing at the officers. In response, several officers fired at least 17\n\nshots.\n\n\u00b6 118 Even more significantly, the trial court found Phagan\u2019s actions to be both deliberate and\n\nlikely to be repeated. The trial judge, when considering mitigation, rejected the idea that\n\n\n\n                                               - 39 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nPhagan\u2019s conduct \u201cdid not contemplate\u201d the possibility of serious physical harm to another. The\n\ncourt noted that at every turn Phagan could have made a choice to reduce the possibility of injury\n\nby complying with the police when they attempted to pull him over. Instead, he led a \u201chigh speed\n\nchase with basically shootouts at three different points.\u201d Phagan undoubtedly understood that he\n\n\u201ccould cause or threaten serious physical harm certainly to civilians that were around, as well as\n\nresponding officers.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 119 As we laid out in the facts, Phagan committed this offense while on mandatory\n\nsupervised release (parole) for a 2008 offense that bears striking similarities. A Sauk Village\n\npolice officer found Phagan and a codefendant in a car that had been stolen four days before.\n\nAfter unsuccessful efforts to arrest them, Phagan sped off, at times \u201c[i]n excess of 110 miles an\n\nhour,\u201d driving erratically. The codefendant, the passenger, leaned out and fired at the pursuing\n\nofficers causing one squad car to crash and another to abandon the pursuit. The trial court\n\ndescribed this offense as \u201ceerily similar\u201d to this one, and we agree. Phagan has shown, twice\n\nnow, complete disregard for the safety of the citizens of Chicago, the police, and himself. We\n\nfind the trial court\u2019s judgment, that this aggravation is \u201cincredibly, incredibly significant,\u201d to not\n\nbe an abuse of discretion.\n\n\u00b6 120 Phagan fails to identify any record facts that the trial court should have considered in\n\nmitigation and did not. Instead, he recites a series of Illinois cases reversing the imposition of\n\nconsecutive sentences for \u201cfar more serious crimes\u201d than his, including O\u2019Neal, People v.\n\nRucker, 260 Ill. App. 3d 659 (1994), and People v. Brown, 258 Ill. App. 3d 544 (1994). We find\n\nthese cases distinguishable, each for slightly different reasons.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 40 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n\u00b6 121 In O\u2019Neal, the trial court ordered the murder sentence to run consecutively to the\n\nconcurrent sentences for rape and aggravated kidnapping. 125 Ill. 2d at 293-94. The defendant\n\nand another offender had forced their way into victim\u2019s car. Id. at 294-95. They drove to an alley\n\nwhere they put the victim\u2019s boyfriend in the trunk and the defendant raped the victim. Id. at 295.\n\nAfter the defendant was done, the other offender got on top of the victim; the defendant then shot\n\nthe other offender and fled. Id. The defendant was 19, the youngest of six children to a mother on\n\npublic aid. Id. at 300. The defendant had left home while he was still in grammar school and his\n\nonly conviction had been a robbery for which he had received probation. Id. The defendant also\n\ntestified that he was afraid of the other offender, who had previously forced him to participate in\n\nother crimes and to perform sexual acts at gunpoint. Id. at 296.\n\n\u00b6 122 The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court reversing the\n\nimposition of consecutive sentences. Id. at 301. Central to its analysis was the determination that\n\nthe trial court had considered the evidence in aggravation, but there was \u201cno indication that the\n\ntrial court gave serious consideration to [the] defendant\u2019s youth and other evidence in mitigation,\n\nnamely, his desire to free himself from [the other offender\u2019s] oppressive deviate sexual\n\npractices.\u201d Id. at 300. Phagan\u2019s sentencing hearing does not present us with the same\n\ndeficiencies. The trial court went through the statutory mitigating factors and explained why each\n\none did not apply. Of particular relevance, contrary to the court\u2019s reasoning in O\u2019Neal, the trial\n\ncourt found that Phagan\u2019s conduct was not the result of provocation, inducement, or some other\n\nexcuse. O\u2019Neal presented an uncommon set of facts and a trial court unwilling to consider them;\n\nthat is not Phagan\u2019s situation.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 41 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\n\u00b6 123 In Rucker, the trial court imposed consecutive sentences for two separate counts of armed\n\nrobbery despite the presence of a deluge of mitigating evidence. There, the 17-year-old\n\ndefendant and two of his friends placed orders for pizza. Rucker, 260 Ill. App. 3d at 660. Both\n\ntimes the same delivery person arrived. Id. The first time the boys brandished a metal pipe and\n\ntook the pizza without paying; the second time, the boys hit the delivery person with baseball\n\nbats, causing a skull fracture and shattered elbow, and took money from him. Id. at 660-61. At\n\nsentencing the State argued the severity of the offense in aggravation. Id. In contrast, the\n\nmitigation evidence showed that the defendant had been a well-performing student until his\n\ngrandmother died and his girlfriend broke up with him, at which point he was hospitalized for\n\nsevere depression, and never successfully treated. Id. at 661. The defendant, though he explained\n\nthe offense as one of the another boy\u2019s idea, expressed remorse and a willingness to pay\n\nrestitution to the victim. Id. at 661-62.\n\n\u00b6 124 The appellate court reversed the consecutive sentences, finding that, while a lengthy\n\nsentence was appropriate, consecutive sentences of 6 and 14 years was an abuse of discretion in\n\nlight of the facts. Id. at 663. None of the mitigation present in Rucker exists here. Phagan was not\n\na young boy, cajoled into crime by peer pressure. There is no evidence of trauma that would\n\nhave caused a behavioral spiral. Similarly, because Phagan did not speak in allocution, there is\n\nno affirmative evidence that he expressed any remorse. Indeed, most of his trial testimony was\n\nnothing but an elaborate exercise in blame-shifting, and a futile one at that\u2014the jury did not\n\naccept any of his excuses. We cannot say that Rucker supports reversal.\n\n\u00b6 125 The court in Brown confronted a confluence of reasons to justify a reversal of\n\nconsecutive sentences. The defendant had been convicted of aggravated criminal sexual assault,\n\n\n\n                                               - 42 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\naggravated criminal sexual abuse, and armed robbery. Brown, 258 Ill. App. 3d at 545. As in\n\nO\u2019Neal, the appellate court described the trial court\u2019s consecutive sentences decision as\n\n\u201cboilerplate.\u201d Id. at 554. As in Rucker, significant mitigating evidence was presented, including\n\nthat the defendant was 19, had no criminal history, had been employed, and lived with his\n\nfamily. Id. In addition, the defendant in Brown faced a different application of the consecutive\n\nsentencing statute. By the statute\u2019s text, his sentences for aggravated criminal sexual assault and\n\narmed robbery were required to run consecutively, and the defendant did not challenge that\n\naspect of his sentence. Id. at 553. Those sentences alone amounted to 20 years. Id. at 554. The\n\nappellate court found it unnecessary to add an additional discretionary consecutive sentence of\n\nfive years. Id. As before, we are not presented with significant mitigation or with a \u201cboilerplate\u201d\n\nruling from the trial court or with sentences already running consecutively by operation of law.\n\n\u00b6 126 The trial court\u2019s decision did not amount to an abuse of discretion. Phagan does not claim\n\nthat the trial court failed to consider mitigating evidence. The trial court carefully considered the\n\npotential for harm caused by Phagan\u2019s conduct and, given Phagan\u2019s criminal history, the\n\nsubstantial likelihood that he might do something like this again. We agree that the record\n\nsupports the trial court\u2019s conclusion. We affirm the imposition of consecutive sentences.\n\n\u00b6 127                               Excessiveness of Sentence\n\n\u00b6 128 Phagan also challenges his sentence as excessive. We address this issue without\n\nremanding because, as we read Phagan\u2019s brief, we understand his challenge to be only to the\n\nconcurrent 30-year sentences for attempted murder of a peace officer irrespective of his\n\nchallenges to the 20-year firearm enhancement or the consecutive sentence in his other case.\n\nWhile Phagan\u2019s brief does complain about his \u201c71-year aggregate sentence,\u201d the remedy he\n\n\n\n                                               - 43 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\nseeks is exclusively related to his 30-year attempted murder sentence. Specifically, he asks only\n\nthat we \u201creduce [his] sentences for attempt[ed] first degree murder to the minimum of 20 years\u201d\n\nor remand for resentencing. This task is the same regardless of our conclusions as to the other\n\naspects of his sentence, so we undertake it now.\n\n\u00b6 129 Phagan makes three basic arguments as to the excessiveness of his 30-year attempted\n\nmurder sentences: (i) his sentence had no deterrence value because, as the trial court\n\nacknowledged, the case had not received \u201csubstantial visibility\u201d; (ii) the sentence serves no\n\nrehabilitative purpose because Phagan had rehabilitative potential but received a de facto life\n\nsentence; and (iii) the trial court\u2019s sentence was disproportionate to the nature of the offense. The\n\nState responds to each claim, but the theme of the State\u2019s argument is that on balance the\n\nseriousness of Phagan\u2019s offense significantly outweighs any possible mitigation and justifies his\n\nsentence, which was within the applicable sentencing range. We ultimately agree with the State.\n\n\u00b6 130 Phagan briefly reiterates the trial court\u2019s point that his sentence would not serve the\n\ninterest in general deterrence because the case was not widely publicized. We note some courts\n\nhave expressed doubt that publicity is a necessary component of general deterrence. See United\n\nStates v. Robinson, 778 F.3d 515, 521 (6th Cir. 2015) (\u201cA court should not require evidence of\n\nlikely publicity before taking into account the Congressional sentencing goal of deterrence\n\n***.\u201d). Indeed, general deterrence concerns maintaining the faith that our judicial system\n\nadequately punishes wrongdoing as much as it does about preventing others from committing the\n\nprecise crime of which a defendant is convicted. Cf. United States v. Martin, 455 F.3d 1227,\n\n1240 (11th Cir. 2006). It would be impossible to advance this goal if we consistently sanctioned\n\nrelatively lenient punishment for serious offenses just because those cases did not achieve public\n\n\n\n                                               - 44 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\ninfamy. We find that, even if Phagan\u2019s offense had not been widely known, his sentence\n\ndemonstrates the trial court\u2019s commitment to punishing defendants sufficiently for bad acts and\n\nfosters a culture of deterrence that our system values.\n\n\u00b6 131 Phagan further argues that he is \u201cnot beyond rehabilitation\u201d because he was only 23 years\n\nold at the time of the offense, had a supportive family, had purportedly left the gang with which\n\nhe had been involved, and had struggled with poverty and his mother\u2019s substance abuse. Defense\n\ncounsel made these same arguments to the trial court. We presume that the trial court considered\n\nthis evidence unless affirmative proof shows the contrary. People v. Brewer, 2013 IL App (1st)\n\n072821, \u00b6 55. The trial court expressly considered the statutory mitigating factor related to\n\nPhagan\u2019s attitude and likelihood to commit another crime as well as potential hardship to his\n\nfamily members caused by a long sentence. The existence of mitigating factors does not require\n\nthe trial court to sentence close to the minimum. People v. Flores, 404 Ill. App. 3d 155, 158\n\n(2010).\n\n\u00b6 132 Despite the trial court\u2019s authority to substantially depart from the minimum\u2014even with\n\nthe existence of mitigating factors\u2014the court did not do so for the base sentence for attempted\n\nmurder. As a result, we cannot say that his sentence is \u201cdisproportionate to the nature of the\n\noffense,\u201d as Phagan argues. The permissible range for Phagan\u2019s sentence is 20 to 80 years. 720\n\nILCS 5/8-4(c)(1)(A) (West 2014). Phagan\u2019s base sentence is 10 years beyond the minimum and\n\n50 years shy of the maximum. We have already set out, in great detail, the danger caused by\n\nPhagan\u2019s offense and his having committed similar offenses. Given the deference we owe to\n\nsentences within the statutory range (see People v. Vega, 2018 IL App (1st) 160619, \u00b6 64),\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 45 -\n\fNo. 1-15-3031\n\n\ncoupled with the trial court\u2019s careful consideration of the factors in aggravation and mitigation,\n\nwe do not see a justification to disturb the trial court\u2019s sentencing judgment.\n\n\u00b6 133 Affirmed in part and vacated in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 46 -\n\f",
