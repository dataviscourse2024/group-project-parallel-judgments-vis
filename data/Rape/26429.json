Myers of\n               murder, he filed a motion for testing under the DNA Testing\n\f                                     - 757 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        301 Nebraska R eports\n                                STATE v. MYERS\n                               Cite as 301 Neb. 756\n\nAct.1 The district court denied that motion as well as Myers\u2019\nmotion for the appointment of counsel. We would review these\ndenials for an abuse of discretion. But to do so, the court\nbelow must have applied only the part of the legal framework\ngoverning whether to grant testing. Because the district court\nmay have relied instead upon principles governing relief avail-\nable after testing, we must reverse the order and remand the\ncause for reconsideration of the motions under only the correct\nportion of the governing framework.\n                       BACKGROUND\n                   Circumstances of Crimes\n   The State charged Myers with first degree murder, use of\na deadly weapon in the commission of a felony, and posses-\nsion of a deadly weapon by a felon in connection with the\n1995 shooting death of Lynette Mainelli. A jury convicted\nMyers of the charges, and we affirmed his convictions on\ndirect appeal.2\n   The factual background relating to Myers\u2019 convictions is\nset forth in more detail in our opinion involving Myers\u2019 direct\nappeal.3 Our opinion stated in part:\n      Edward Wilson testified that he was in the van driven\n      by Myers the night Mainelli was killed. Myers drove to\n      the Blue Lake Manor Apartments, where Mainelli lived.\n      Myers got out of the van, and Edward Wilson saw that\n      he had on gloves. Myers went to the back of the van,\n      and Edward Wilson heard a \u201cclacking\u201d noise, which\n      he recognized as the sound of a bullet moving into a\n      chamber. Myers then left the van and walked toward the\n      apartment complex. He was gone for about 1 hour, and\n      upon his return, he got in the van and took the passen-\n      gers home.\n\n\u20021\t\n      See Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 29-4116 to 29-4125 (Reissue 2016).\n\u20022\t\n      See State v.

MYERS\n                               Cite as 301 Neb. 756\n\n        Sam Edwards testified that as Myers dropped him off,\n     Myers gave him a handgun and told him to \u201cput it up\u201d\n     because the police were out and Myers had in-transit\n     stickers on the van. Earlier, Edwards had seen the pistol\n     on Myers\u2019 lap. Edwards subsequently retrieved the pis-\n     tol and gave it to Edward Wilson, who stated the pistol\n     had once belonged to his sister, Edwina Wilson. Edward\n     Wilson testified that he recognized the gun because it\n     had a unique color and a name written on it and that he\n     thought the black handle was unusual. Edward Wilson\n     sold the pistol because he suspected that it had been\n     used in the murder of Mainelli. The pistol was the same\n     caliber as two .22-caliber casings found beside Mainelli\u2019s\n     body. Daniel Bredow, a firearm toolmarks examiner with\n     the city of Omaha, testified that he compared the bullets\n     found at the crime scene with bullets fired from the gun\n     Myers gave Edwards. Bredow concluded that the bullets\n     taken from the crime scene had been fired by the gun\n     which could be traced to Myers.\n        [Timothy] Sanders testified that in the summer and\n     early fall of 1995, Myers had said that Mainelli was going\n     to testify against Charles Duncan, so she needed to have\n     \u201cher cap pulled back and to be shot.\u201d Sanders saw Myers\n     with a small .22-caliber handgun in the summer of 1995.\n     Edwina Wilson testified that in December 1996, after\n     Mainelli\u2019s death, Myers had told her to tell the police he\n     was with her at the time of the killing.4\n   Other information relevant to the instant appeal is derived\nfrom the trial record. The State presented evidence about\nMyers\u2019 plan to be intimate with Mainelli. Timothy Sanders,\nwho was in the same gang as Myers, testified that Myers\nsaid Mainelli needed to be shot and that Myers said he was\ngoing to have sex with Mainelli. Sanders testified that after\nMainelli\u2019s death, Myers told him that Mainelli walked into\n\n\u20024\t\n      Id. at 312-13, 603 N.W.2d at 388-89.\n\f                              - 759 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   301 Nebraska R eports\n                         STATE v.

In closing arguments, the\nprosecutor summarized: \u201cShe took off her clothes; she laid on\nthe bed. He put the gun towards her temple and he shot her.\u201d\n\n                    Motion for DNA Testing\n   In 2016, Myers filed a motion pursuant to the DNA Testing\nAct seeking \u201cDNA testing of items of evidence that may con-\ntain biological material.\u201d He listed 26 items of evidence taken\nfrom the crime scene, and he wished to have those items tested\nin order to exclude himself as a donor of any biological mate-\nrial. The items included Mainelli\u2019s bedding, bullets and spent\n.22-caliber casings, beverage containers, clothing, spiral note-\nbooks, cigarette butts and contents of ashtrays, gunshot residue\ntest kit from Mainelli\u2019s hands, vials of Mainelli\u2019s blood, a rape\nkit, and hair samples.\n   Myers sought a variety of different DNA tests. He wanted\ntesting of any hairs, blood, semen, saliva, or skin cells on vari-\nous items, asserting that if such DNA evidence excluded Myers\nand was found to be of another male, \u201cthis would prove that\nthe story from the informant was false, and Myers is in fact\n[i]nnocent.\u201d Myers alleged there was \u201cgood cause to believe\nbiological evidence still exists and can be identified and pro-\nfiled with today\u2019s DNA technology.\u201d Myers asserted that if a\nsuspect touched his face or head while wearing gloves, the\nskin cells could be transferred to other objects. Myers wanted\nthe spent .22-caliber casings tested, because \u201cit has become\npossible to obtain DNA profiles from few skin cells left by the\nperson who loaded a shell into a gun.\u201d Myers also moved for\nthe appointment of counsel. In connection with a motion to\npreserve evidence, Myers included a laboratory report showing\nthat a sexual assault examination of Mainelli was performed\nand that a vaginal swab and vaginal smear slide from a sexual\nassault kit revealed \u201c[v]ery few spermatozoa.\u201d\n   Myers filed an affidavit in support of his motion for DNA\ntesting. He stated that DNA evidence was not available at the\n\f                                    - 760 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        301 Nebraska R eports\n                               STATE v. MYERS\n                              Cite as 301 Neb. 756\n\ntime of his trial, that law enforcement withheld any findings of\nbiological evidence from him, and that testing all of the items\nwould exonerate him. Myers also stated that he was with his\ngirlfriend on the night of the murder and that testing all of the\nitems would prove that the State\u2019s informant lied. He subse-\nquently filed a supplemental amendment to his motion, seeking\nDNA testing of the sexual assault kit.\n   The State filed an inventory of evidence that had been\ngathered in connection with the case. It showed that the items\nMyers wished to have tested were in the State\u2019s possession.\n   The district court held a hearing. Myers asked the court to\nconsider his motion along with the supplemental amendment\nand to take judicial notice of \u00a7 29-4120(5). He presented no\nevidence. The State likewise presented no evidence, but it\nrequested that the court review the bill of exceptions from the\ntrial, along with Myers\u2019 motion to determine whether DNA\ntesting was appropriate.\n                   District Court\u2019s Decision\n   The district court denied Myers\u2019 motion. It found that DNA\ntesting was not warranted under \u00a7 29-4120(5)(c), because the\nresults would not provide exculpatory evidence. The court\nquoted extensively from a portion of State v. Buckman 5\n(including portions of the Buckman opinion which relied on\nState v. Bronson 6) where we discussed when a court may\nvacate and set aside a judgment based on test results that\n\u201cexonerate or exculpate\u201d an accused and \u201cshow a complete\nlack of evidence to establish an essential element of the\ncrime charged.\u201d\n   The court explained that testing of the evidence would\nnot exonerate or exculpate Myers in light of the evidence at\ntrial, because \u201cthe absence of [Myers\u2019] DNA from these items\nwould not establish [Myers\u2019] innocence considering witnesses\n\n\u20025\t\n      State v. Buckman, 267 Neb. 505, 517, 675 N.W.2d 372, 382 (2004).\n\u20026\t\n      State v.

The court concluded that \u201cregardless of whether\n[Myers\u2019] DNA was excluded or someone else\u2019s DNA could\nbe found on this evidence, such DNA results would not \u2018show\na complete lack of evidence to establish an essential element\nof the crime charged\u2019 when you consider the totality of the\nevidence.\u201d\n   Myers timely appealed.\n\n               ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Myers assigns that the district court erred in (1) refusing\nto order DNA testing, (2) making findings of fact and con-\nclusions of law without actual DNA results, (3) failing to\ndetermine whether the State refused to allow him access to\nDNA evidence, and (4) failing to appoint counsel to repre-\nsent him.\n\n                  STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1,2] A motion for DNA testing is addressed to the discre-\ntion of the trial court, and unless an abuse of discretion is\nshown, the trial court\u2019s determination will not be disturbed.7\nAn appellate court will uphold a trial court\u2019s findings of fact\nrelated to a motion for DNA testing unless such findings are\nclearly erroneous.8\n\n\u20027\t\n      State v.

But it is also important to remem-\nber that both Buckman and the Bronson11 decision cited in\nBuckman were appeals where DNA testing had been ordered\nand focused on the relief sought and denied based upon the\ntest results.\n   In Buckman, we first summarized the legal framework appli-\ncable in determining whether to order testing. We said:\n          The initial step toward obtaining relief under the DNA\n      Testing Act is for a person in custody to file a motion\n      requesting forensic DNA testing of biological material.\n      . . . Forensic DNA testing is available for any biological\n      material that is related to the investigation or prosecution\n      that resulted in the judgment; is in the actual or construc-\n      tive possession of the state, or others likely to safeguard\n      the integrity of the biological material; and either was not\n      previously subjected to DNA testing or can be retested\n      with more accurate current techniques.12\nWe pause at this point to observe there is no dispute that Myers\nmet these criteria.\n   If the above criteria are met and if the court further deter-\nmines that the requirements of \u00a7 29-4120(5) have been met,\nthe court must order testing.

For convenience, we\nquote the current version, which was in effect at the time of\nMyers\u2019 motion:\n      Upon consideration of affidavits or after a hearing, the\n      court shall order DNA testing pursuant to a motion filed\n      under subsection (1) of this section upon a determination\n      that (a)(i) the biological material was not previously sub-\n      jected to DNA testing or (ii) the biological material was\n      tested previously, but current technology could provide\n      a reasonable likelihood of more accurate and probative\n      results, (b) the biological material has been retained\n      under circumstances likely to safeguard the integrity of\n      its original physical composition, and (c) such testing\n      may produce noncumulative, exculpatory evidence rel-\n      evant to the claim that the person was wrongfully con-\n      victed or sentenced.16\n   In Buckman, we elaborated on the last prong of \u00a7 29-4120(5)\nand clarified that the threshold to satisfy it was rather low.\nWe stated:\n      Exculpatory evidence is defined as evidence favorable\n      to the person in custody and material to the issue of the\n      guilt of the person in custody. . . .

In Buckman,18 we also set forth the procedure appli-\ncable after a court orders DNA testing. We stated:\n        Once DNA testing is conducted, and results are\n     obtained, the question is whether the evidence obtained\n     exonerates or exculpates the movant. Based on the test\n     results, the movant may obtain relief in one of two\n     ways, each of which requires a different quantum of\n     proof. As previously noted, when the test results exon-\n     erate or exculpate the movant, the court may \u201cvacate\n     and set aside the judgment and release the person from\n     custody.\u201d . . . However, if the court does not vacate and\n     set aside the judgment, the movant may file a motion\n     for new trial based upon \u201cnewly discovered exculpatory\n     DNA or similar forensic testing obtained under the DNA\n     Testing Act.\u201d19\nWe summarized the proof necessary for each potential remedy:\n     [T]he court may vacate and set aside the judgment in\n     circumstances where the DNA testing results are either\n     completely exonerative or highly exculpatory\u2014when the\n     results, when considered with the evidence of the case\n     which resulted in the underlying judgment, show a com-\n     plete lack of evidence to establish an essential element\n     of the crime charged. . . .

It denied testing on\nthe basis that Myers failed to meet the \u201cmay produce noncumu-\nlative, exculpatory evidence\u201d requirement of \u00a7 29-4120(5)(c).\nBut in making its determination, the court discussed a more\nonerous standard governing relief which might be available\nafter testing has been performed.\n   The court\u2019s order shows that it imported the legal standard\nfor determining whether to vacate or set aside a conviction.\nIt quoted, with emphasis, when a motion to vacate and set\naside the judgment under \u00a7 29-4123(2) may be granted. It also\nquoted language from Buckman, highlighting that vacating\nor setting aside a judgment was intended \u201cto apply to those\ncases in which DNA test results \u2018conclusively establish the\nguilt or innocence of a criminal defendant\u2019\u201d21 and would be\nproper \u201conly where the results of DNA testing either com-\npletely exonerated the movant or were highly exculpatory.\u201d22\nFinally, the court found that \u201cregardless of whether [Myers\u2019]\nDNA was excluded or someone else\u2019s DNA could be found\non this evidence, such DNA results would not \u2018show a\ncomplete lack of evidence to establish an essential element\nof the crime charged\u2019 when you consider the totality of\nthe evidence.\u201d\n\n20\t\n      Id. at 518, 675 N.W.2d at 383 (citations omitted).\n21\t\n      Id. at 516, 675 N.W.2d at 382.\n22\t\n      Id. at 516-17, 675 N.W.2d at 382.\n\f                                - 766 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       301 Nebraska R eports\n                           STATE v. MYERS\n                          Cite as 301 Neb. 756\n\n   On appeal, we are tasked with determining whether the dis-\ntrict court abused its discretion in denying Myers\u2019 motion for\nDNA testing. But we cannot do so, because the court mingled\nstandards applicable to \u00a7 29-4123(2) and (3) into its analysis\nunder \u00a7 29-4120(5). Where it should have addressed only the\nfirst part of the statutory framework, its decision can be read\nto instead delve into the questions that apply in the latter part\nof the framework. Here, the question before the court was\nwhether to allow testing.\n   Because the court\u2019s order fails to make clear that its\ndenial of DNA testing was based solely on \u00a7 29-4120(5), we\nmust remand the cause to the district court for a determina-\ntion under that section, based upon the existing record. On\nremand, the court shall determine whether the requirements of\n\u00a7 29-4120(5) have been met, including whether DNA testing\nof the items requested may produce noncumulative evidence\nwhich is favorable to Myers and material to the issue of\nhis guilt.\n\n                   A ppointment of Counsel\n   Myers also assigns error to the district court\u2019s denial of his\nmotion for the appointment of counsel. A court shall appoint\ncounsel for an indigent person upon a showing that DNA test-\ning may be relevant to the person\u2019s claim of wrongful con-\nviction.23 Because we are remanding the cause to the district\ncourt to consider whether Myers\u2019 motion for DNA testing\nshould be granted under the proper standard, we also remand\nthe cause for a determination as to whether he made the requi-\nsite showing to require the appointment of counsel.\n\n                Access to Biological M aterial\n   Myers also contends that the Omaha Police Department\ndid not disclose to the defense that it secured a sexual assault\nexamination kit and collected a vaginal vault sample from the\n\n23\t\n      \u00a7 29-4122.\n\f                                      - 767 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        301 Nebraska R eports\n                                 STATE v.

This is not part of the\nDNA Testing Act framework.\n   The DNA Testing Act is a limited remedy providing inmates\nan opportunity to obtain DNA testing in order to establish inno-\ncence after a conviction.24 We have previously stated, although\nin dicta, that a constitutional challenge to the destruction of\nevidence is outside the purview of the DNA Testing Act.25\nWe conclude that whether the prosecution improperly with-\nheld evidence is not properly presented in a motion for DNA\ntesting. Upon remand, the district court need not consider this\nargument further.\n                         CONCLUSION\n   Because the district court applied principles governing relief\nwhich might be available after testing when it should have\nlimited its consideration to whether it was required to order\ntesting, we must reverse the order and remand the cause for\nreconsideration of the motions under the correct portion of\nthe governing framework. We likewise reverse the denial of\ncounsel and remand the cause for a determination as to whether\nMyers made the requisite showing to be entitled to the appoint-\nment of counsel.\n\tR eversed and remanded for\n\t                                 further proceedings.\n   Freudenberg, J., not participating.\n\n24\t\n      State v.
