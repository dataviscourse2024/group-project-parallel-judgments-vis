Ronald Paul pleaded no contest in Tennessee state court to one\n\ncount of rape. The judgment that effectuated the plea noted a special condition: \u201cnor shall\n\ndefendant be required to comply w/ the sexual offender registry.\u201d That condition occasions this\n\nappeal from Paul\u2019s conviction for violating federal sex-offender reporting requirements. Paul\n\nmaintains that when Tennessee absolved him of his state obligation to register, it also eliminated\n\nhis corresponding federal registration duty. Agreeing with the district court that the Tennessee\n\njudgment did not excuse Paul from complying with federal registration requirements, we\n\nAFFIRM.\n\fCase No. 17-5329\nUnited States v. Paul\n\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       \u201c[T]o allow members of the public to adequately protect themselves and their children,\u201d\n\nTennessee requires a \u201cviolent sexual offender\u201d like Paul to register with the state promptly after\n\nrelease from custody. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 40-39-201(b)(2), 40-39-202(30)\u2013(31) (defining a\n\n\u201cviolent sexual offender\u201d as one convicted of a \u201cviolent sexual offense,\u201d which includes rape),\n\n40-39-203(a)(1). Tennessee law requires that he thereafter (for life) provide in-person updates\n\nboth quarterly and within 48 hours of any address change. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 40-39-203(a)(1),\n\n40-39-204(b)(1), 40-39-207(g)(1)(B).\n\n   A. Paul\u2019s Registration History\n\n       Following his release from custody, Paul registered as a sex offender at the Jackson\n\nCounty Sheriff\u2019s Office, despite the notation on his judgment. The registering officer testified\n\nthat she not only processed Paul\u2019s initial registration but also that she explained Tennessee\u2019s\n\nregistration requirements and gave Paul a copy, which he acknowledged by signing a form. He\n\ncontinued to register a few times each year; eventually, he skipped several quarters and then\n\nstopped registering entirely.\n\n       All 12 registration forms Paul signed reiterated his Tennessee registration obligations.\n\nThe final form included specific notice of a duty to register under the federal Sex Offender\n\nRegistration and Notification Act (SORNA).\n\n       Less than a month after Paul last registered, he traveled to the Philippines, and did not\n\nreturn to the United States for over a year. When he returned to Tennessee for a five-week stay,\n\nhowever, Paul failed to report or register a Tennessee address. For that failure, a grand jury\n\nindicted him for violating SORNA. A jury later convicted him. Paul appeals, continuing to\n\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\fCase No. 17-5329\nUnited States v. Paul\n\n\nargue, as he has throughout this protracted litigation, that he should not have been prosecuted\n\nand that dismissal was warranted.1\n\n                                           II. ANALYSIS\n\n        \u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment on\n\nlegal grounds.\u201d United States v. Philp, 460 F.3d 729, 732 (6th Cir. 2006); see also United States\n\nv. Felts, 674 F.3d 599, 602 (6th Cir. 2012) (statutory construction and constitutionality issues are\n\nreviewed de novo).\n\n   A. Applicable Law and Procedure\n\n       SORNA requires sex offenders to inform authorities of where they live, work, and attend\n\nschool. See 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20913(a). The Act \u201cestablishes a comprehensive national system for the\n\nregistration of [sex] offenders.\u201d 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20901.\n\n       SORNA defines a sex offender as \u201can individual who was convicted of a sex offense\u201d\n\nand subjects such an offender to certain registration requirements. Id. \u00a7 20911(1). Paul pleaded\n\nno contest in Tennessee to one count of rape, qualifying him as a \u201csex offender\u201d under SORNA\n\nand subjecting him to federal registration duties. Among its requirements, SORNA obligates sex\n\noffenders to register \u201cin each jurisdiction where the offender resides.\u201d Id. \u00a7 20913(a).\n\n   B. Paul\u2019s Violation\n\n       The government argues that the following statutory language justifies Paul\u2019s conviction:\n\n\u201cWhoever . . . is required to register under [SORNA] . . . travels in interstate or foreign\n\ncommerce . . . and . . . knowingly fails to register or update a registration as required by\n\n       1\n         This case\u2019s procedural history includes a mistrial, a jury trial, the denial of multiple\nmotions to dismiss, the grant of multiple motions in limine filed by the government, and an\nappeal to a different panel of this court resulting in remand to consider intervening Supreme\nCourt precedent.\n\n\n                                               -3-\n\fCase No. 17-5329\nUnited States v. Paul\n\n\n[SORNA]; shall be fined . . . or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\u201d           18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 2250(a).\n\n          Paul \u201ctravel[ed]\u201d internationally to the Philippines and failed to register the Tennessee\n\naddress where he resided for the five weeks after returning to the United States. The only\n\nelement Paul can dispute is whether he \u201cknowingly\u201d failed to register that address.\n\n   C. Court Denies Dismissal and Grants Government\u2019s Motion in Limine\n\n          In practice, sex offenders register according to the requirements of their state of\n\nresidence; that registration also satisfies SORNA. The wrinkle here is the exemption language in\n\nPaul\u2019s Tennessee judgment. As Paul sees it, the special Tennessee condition eliminated all his\n\nregistration requirements, prompting him to seek dismissal of this SORNA-based case. The\n\ndistrict court denied dismissal, however, concluding that SORNA imposes a distinct federal duty\n\nthat Paul\u2019s Tennessee judgment could not and did not release. The court also granted the\n\ngovernment\u2019s pretrial motion to withhold from jury consideration the legal issue of whether\n\nPaul\u2019s Tennessee judgment excused him from SORNA\u2019s reporting requirements.\n\n          To conclude that SORNA required registration despite Tennessee excusing it,2 the district\n\ncourt analyzed the language and legislative history of SORNA as well as case law\u2014a task the\n\nlaw assigns to judges, not to jurors. And though Paul wishes to cast this as a violation of his\n\nSixth Amendment rights, he cannot reasonably do so. The judge\u2014as occurs in every trial\u2014gave\n\nthe jury the law applicable to the case: that SORNA obligated Paul to register as a sex offender.\n\nWhether he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt remained in the jury\u2019s hands. See United\n\n\n\n          2\n              We presume the validity of the exemption in the Tennessee judgment in deciding this\nappeal.\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fCase No. 17-5329\nUnited States v. Paul\n\n\nStates v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 513 (1995) (\u201c[T]he judge must be permitted to instruct the jury\n\non the law and to insist that the jury follow his instructions.\u201d).\n\n        At trial, Paul conceded that he was \u201cconvicted of a qualifying sex offense that requires\n\nhim to register under [SORNA]\u201d and that the records of his international travel were \u201ctrue and\n\naccurate.\u201d In defense, he put before the jury the language from his Tennessee judgment, pressing\n\nthe jury to find that it showed that he did not knowingly violate SORNA. The jury returned a\n\nguilty verdict.\n\n    D. Paul\u2019s Challenges\n\n        Paul advances several theories for why he cannot be convicted under SORNA. He\n\ngenerally targets aspects of SORNA\u2019s operation as undercutting Tennessee\u2019s state sovereignty.\n\nThat is, the way Paul assesses it, applying SORNA to him effectively invalidates the exemption\n\nTennessee meant to confer.\n\n        He also argues that the federal registration requirement is \u201ctie[d] . . . directly to the state\n\nrequirement,\u201d such that only an individual who is required to register by his state of residence\n\nmay be prosecuted. In support of that theory, he points to SORNA\u2019s requirement that a sex\n\noffender register in the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d where he resides as presupposing an existing state\n\nobligation. 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20913(a). Paul suggests that three of our cases addressing SORNA\n\nconvictions of defendants who had also violated state registration requirements confirm his view.\n\nSee United States v. Harper, 502 F. App\u2019x 447 (6th Cir. 2012) (per curiam); Felts, 674 F.3d 599\n\n(6th Cir. 2012); United States v. Trent, 654 F.3d 574 (6th Cir. 2011).\n\n        But Paul fails to appreciate the duality of the sex offender registration systems. Yes, a\n\nsex offender\u2019s SORNA obligations are coextensive with corresponding state registration\n\nrequirements. But SORNA imposes duties on all sex offenders, irrespective of what they may be\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fCase No. 17-5329\nUnited States v. Paul\n\n\nobliged to do under state law. As the government cogently argues, if Congress meant for sex\n\noffenders\u2019 SORNA requirements to depend on state registration requirements, the Act would\n\nspecifically say so. Like the government, we read SORNA to bind all individuals \u201cconvicted\u201d of\n\nsex offenses, not just those with corresponding state obligations. 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20911(1).\n\n        We have not interpreted SORNA otherwise. With this legislation, Congress sought to\n\ncreate nationwide uniformity for sex offender registration and resolve inadequacies stemming\n\nfrom the \u201cpatchwork of federal and 50 individual state registration systems.\u201d United States v.\n\nKebodeaux, 133 S. Ct. 2496, 2505 (2013) (quoting Reynolds v. United States, 565 U.S. 432, 435\n\n(2012)). The district court correctly denied Paul\u2019s motions to dismiss.\n\n    E. Paul\u2019s Additional Arguments\n\n        Full Faith and Credit\n\n        Paul also argues that enforcing SORNA against him deprives his Tennessee judgment of\n\nthe full faith and credit it must be accorded under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the\n\nConstitution. U.S. Const. Art. IV \u00a7 1. To prevail, Paul would need to show that the Tennessee\n\njudgment validly excused him from all registration requirements under both state and federal\n\nlaw.   But nothing in the Tennessee judgment addressed Paul\u2019s SORNA obligations.               The\n\nTennessee court meant to relieve him of \u201ccomply[ing] w/ the sexual offender registry,\u201d not \u201cany\u201d\n\nor \u201call\u201d registries.\n\n        Vague as Applied\n\n        Paul additionally claims that SORNA is unconstitutionally vague as applied to his\n\nsituation because it requires him to go to a state office to register for federal purposes when his\n\nTennessee judgment specifically promised that he need not register there.            A statute is\n\nunconstitutionally vague if it \u201cfails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of\n\n                                               -6-\n\fCase No. 17-5329\nUnited States v. Paul\n\n\nwhat is prohibited, or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory\n\nenforcement.\u201d United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 304 (2008); see also United States v.\n\nBlaszak, 349 F.3d 881, 888 (6th Cir. 2003).          Paul raises no cognizable challenge to the\n\nconstitutionality of SORNA as applied to him. See United States v. Lechner, 806 F.3d 869, 875\n\n(6th Cir. 2015) (explaining that a defendant must show the statute was vague \u201cas applied to his\n\nparticular case\u201d (quoting United States v. Kernell, 667 F.3d 746, 750 (6th Cir. 2012))). He\n\nhighlights only his confusion about his requirements under his Tennessee judgment.              That\n\nconfusion, however, stems from the Tennessee judgment, rather than from SORNA.\n\n       Nor can Paul credibly argue that he lacked notice of SORNA\u2019s requirements. When he\n\nlast registered in 2009, the final page of his registration instructions included a section titled:\n\n\u201cNotification of Federal Duty to Register as a Sex Offender.\u201d           This section included the\n\nfollowing details of his SORNA requirements:\n\n       Under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, a federal law, persons\n       with sex offense convictions must register as a sex offender and keep their\n       registration current in each jurisdiction (state or territory) in which they\n       reside . . . . [C]onvicted sex offenders are required to notify the jurisdiction where\n       they are required to register not later than three business days (48 hours under\n       Tennessee law) after any change of name, residence, employment, or student\n       status. Failure to comply with these obligations subjects the convicted offender to\n       prosecution for failure to register or update their registration under federal law, 18\n       U.S.C. \u00a7 2250, punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment, which may be\n       independent of any additional state law violations.\n\nOn the registration form, Paul marked an \u201cX\u201d next to a line saying he \u201cread and underst[oo]d the\n\nrequirements\u201d and signed his name. He initialed the bottom of each instruction page. We find\n\nthat Paul had fair notice of SORNA\u2019s registration requirements.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\fCase No. 17-5329\nUnited States v. Paul\n\n\n       Tenth Amendment and Commandeering\n\n       Paul alleges that his federal prosecution nullifies Tennessee\u2019s police power in violation of\n\nthe Tenth Amendment. He claims that SORNA deprives Tennessee of the ability to decide who\n\nmust register in the state and that SORNA violates anti-commandeering principles by requiring\n\nTennessee to register him. See Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 935 (1997).\n\n       Neither argument has merit. Again, Tennessee ostensibly relieved Paul of his registration\n\nobligations under Tennessee law, nothing more. Paul acknowledges that SORNA is a valid\n\nexercise of federal authority under the Spending Clause. See United States v. Stock, 685 F.3d\n\n621, 626 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207\u201312 (1987)) (finding\n\nstate action conditioned upon the receipt of federal funds valid); Felts, 674 F.3d at 606\u201308\n\n(same). And Paul misidentifies the relevant actor. SORNA compels action by sex offenders, not\n\nstates. Stock, 685 F.3d at 626. Tennessee could have refused to accept Paul\u2019s registration. In\n\nthat case, Tennessee would have had to forgo some federal funding and Paul would have had an\n\naffirmative defense. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(c) (excusing a SORNA violation if \u201cuncontrollable\n\ncircumstances prevented . . . compl[iance],\u201d the sex offender \u201cdid not contribute to the creation\n\nof such circumstances in reckless disregard of the requirement to comply,\u201d and the sex offender\n\n\u201ccomplied as soon as such circumstances ceased to exist\u201d); Stock, 685 F.3d at 626 n.3; Felts, 674\n\nF.3d at 607\u201308. But we are not presented with that scenario here.\n\n                                  III.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For these reasons, we AFFIRM.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\f",
