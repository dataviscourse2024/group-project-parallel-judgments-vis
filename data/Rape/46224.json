    "summary": "The Reporter's statement of the case: The following are the facts of the case as found by the court: I. Plaintiff is now, and during all the times hereinafter mentioned was, a corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of South Dakota, duly licensed to transact business within the State of Minnesota, having its principal place of business at St. Paul in said State. It has at all times borne true allegiance to the Government of the United States, and has not in any way voluntarily abetted or given encouragement to rebellion against said Government, or to any enemies thereof. II. On and prior to October 1, 1918, plaintiff was, ever since said date has been and now is, owner and in actual possession of that certain building and ground upon which located, lying and being in the county of Iiamsey and State of Minnesota, bounded by University Avenue, Cromwell Avenue, Bayard Avenue, and Palham Street, in said city, comprising lots 1 to 6, inclusive, block 6, Baker\u2019s addition to the city of St. Paul. III. On September 24, 1918, long prior to that date, and thereafter during all the times herein mentioned, Major W. It. Weaver, of the United States Army, was officer in command of tlie United States Air Mechanics\u2019 Training School, then located and conducted in the so-called Overland Building, in the city of St. Paul, which said Overland Building was then located within the second block west of plaintiff\u2019s said building. At said time Captain Arthur Gosling had charge, for the United States, under said Major W. R. Weaver, of all business affairs pertaining to said school, and more especially the procuring of supplies, the payment therefor, the procuring of buildings and quarters, and the payment therefor, and then had offices located in said Overland Building. At said time one L. L. Davis was civilian chief clerk and assistant to said Captain Arthur Gosling, and had an office in said Overland Building. At said time one George W. Heinrich, an enlisted man, was likewise attached to the office of Captain Arthur Gosling, and was at times delegated to perform special duties, owing to his unusual business experience. IY. In September and October of 1918 an epidemic of influenza broke out and spread throughout said aviation school, about 600 of the students being afflicted. The students were then quartered in the Overland Building and in tents on the premises, from 1,200 to 1,500 being quartered in tents. The housing facilities were entirely inadequate, and the congestion interfered with the proper combating of the disease. V. With a view to acquiring more housing space, Major Weaver and Captain Gosling, accompanied by several officers from Washington, began an inspection of buildings which might be suitable for the desired purpose, and they found the plaintiff\u2019s building exceptionally desirable. Thereupon, about September 10, 1918, negotiations were commenced between said plaintiff and said Major W. R. Weaver, through Captain Gosling\u2019s office, for the leasing by plaintiff to the Government of the United States of the building of said plaintiff for sleeping quarters in connection with said aviation school, which negotiations resulted, on or about September 28, 1918, in \u00e1 verbal agreement for the leasing of said premises by plaintiff to the United States and the preparation by said Captain Gosling\u2019s office of a written lease. It was verbally agreed between said plaintiff and said Major Weaver and Captain Gosling that the Government of the United States would pay to plaintiff as rental of said building 25 cents per square foot per year for all space included in said building, which was in said lease designated as 84,000 square feet, but which was in truth and in fact 76,600 square feet; that said Government should at its own expense remove from said building all of plaintiff\u2019s personal property to a place provided therefor by plaintiff, should pay said plaintiff for any damage resulting to plaintiff\u2019s property from such removal, should have the right to cancel said lease upon 30 days\u2019 written notice to plaintiff, and should upon surrender of said building move back into said building plaintiff\u2019s said personal property, and pay to said plaintiff any damage, if any, resulting to said property in so removing the same back into said building. The written lease prepared in Captain Gosling\u2019s office was by him presented to the plaintiff for signature, and on or about September 28,1918, the same was duly executed by the plaintiff and delivered to said Captain Gosling and was by said Major Weaver forwarded to Washington for proper signature on behalf of the United States, but was never so signed. Said written lease was as follows: LEASE. Lessor: Twin City Four Wheel Drive Company. Contracting officer: C. G. Edgar, colonel, Signal Corps.

VI. On or' about October 1, 1918, the Government of the United States took possession of the building of said plaintiff under direction of said Major W. E. Weaver, and pursuant to the terms of said purported lease, and remained in possession of the same to January 31,1919. VII. Thirty days prior to said January 31, 1919, said plaintiff received written notice from said Captain Gosling that the Government would, on or before January 31, 1919, surrender possession of said building to said plaintiff, which it did. The plaintiff was not notified until after the termination of the Government\u2019s occupancy that the written lease would not be executed. VIII. A reasonable rental value for said premises at the time the United States took possession thereof and during its occupancy was 25 cents per square foot per year, or $6,550 for the period of occupancy in addition to any expense to the plaintiff of removing therefrom and returning thereto its personal property. IX. The personal property belonging to plaintiff in said building, consisting o\u00ed approximately 150 truck loads, on October 1, 1918, was by said Captain Gosling\u2019s office carried on trucks belonging to the Government of the United States from said building to a building leased by said plaintiff for said purpose from South Side Wagon & Auto Company. In so removing the same said property was allowed to stand upon said trucks in rain while being so taken to the building designated therefor, and was roughly handled in such removal, and was deposited in a pile or heap in the building to which removed, and was damaged thereby to the amount of $1,621.60. X. Upon surrender of said building by the Government said plaintiff requested Captain Gosling to procure the return of plaintiff\u2019s property to said building, but he directed that the plaintiff should itself return its property, stating that the expense thereof would be reimbursed to it, and plaintiff thereupon removed said property back into its building at an expense to it of $1,281.19, which was not reimbursed. XI. A portion of plaintiff\u2019s building, including 1,300 square feet of space on the ground floor, and twice that amount in the basement, had been rented to Portage ILubber Company upon a lease having 23 months to run. It had been rented at $250 per month, or 76 cents per square foot per year, and has since the surrender of the building by the Government been rented at the rate of $180.55 per month, or a total loss of $2,060.67. XII. A claim was duly presented by plaintiff to the War Department\u2019s' claim board and a hearing thereon had on June 21, 1919, at St.. Paul, Minnesota, and thereafter an award was made by said board allowing said plaintiff the sum of $4,914.70 in full of its said claim, including all items thereof and no more. 'Said plaintiff received notice of the making of said award August 21, 1919, and thereafter on or about September 19, 1919, in writing notified said War Department\u2019s claim board of its refusal to accept said award, but of its willingness to accept three-fourths of the amount thereof to apply on any amount to be allowed by the Court \u2022 of Claims of the United States upon its said claim, which was paid and received in the amount of $3,686.01.",

            "opinion_text": "\nDowNey, Judge,\ndelivered the opinion o\u00ed the court:\nDuring the year 1918, as a war activity, the United States was maintaining in St. Paul, Minnesota, a training school for air-service mechanics. It was located in the Overland Building, and the students were quartered therein and in tents on the premises. In September of that year there were twelve or fifteen hundred students quartered in tents, and about this time an epidemic of influenza broke out and spread among the students to such an extent that about six hundred were afflicted. Housing accommodations were entirely inadequate under favorable circumstances and with such an epidemic raging, the congestion and the character of the accommodations were such that it could not be properly handled and suppressed.\nUnder these circumstances Major Weaver, who was in command of the school, and Captain Gosling, who was supply officer and charged with the duty of procuring supplies and quarters, accompanied by several officers from Washington, who were presumably there for that purpose, began an inspection of buildings which might be procured or taken over for use as quarters, and having inspected a large manufacturing building belonging to the plaintiff company they found it \u201c exceptionally desirable.\u201d\nNegotiations were entered into between the plaintiff\u2019s officers on the one hand and Major Weaver and Captain Gosling on the other, resulting in a proposition being submitted by the plaintiff, which, as to proposed rental charges, was thereafter considerably reduced, and a verbal agreement was thereupon reached between them for the renting of the building. This agreement, in brief, involved the payment of rental at the rate of 25 cents per square foot per year for the entire building, the reimbursing to the plaintiff of any expense incurred in moving its property out of the building and in returning it thereto at the expiration of the tenancy, with provisions as to the extension and the termination of the tenancy, with other formal matter not here material.\nThe terms agreed upon were incorporated in a written lease prepared by Captain Gosling, or in his office under his direction, and by him presented to the plaintiff\u2019s proper *114officers for signature and signed by them, after proper authority granted by the directors, and this lease was sent on to Washington for signature on behalf of the United States, the plaintiff being given to understand that it would be returned signed within a short time, probably within a week.\nThe officers of 'the training school thereupon took possession of the building under the lease. Officers from Washington had participated in the inspection and approval of the building, and there is apparent from the record no expectation upon the part of the officers of the school other than that the lease would be signed when it reached Washington. The plaintiff\u2019s property then in the building, after but a day\u2019s notice, was loaded rather indiscriminately and without care into trucks and hauled and dumped into a building which plaintiff had succeeded in hastily renting for that purpose, some damage thereto resulting.\nThe armistice soon followed, and about the last of December the United States, by Captain Gosling, notified the plaintiff that possession of the building would be surrendered on or before January 31, 1919, and it was surrendered on or before that date. It was not, so far as appears from the record, until after the termination of the tenancy by reason of the 80-day notice and the surrender of the building to the plaintiff that plaintiff was notified that the lease signed by it and under which it had surrendered possession of its building, had not been and would not be signed by the United States.\nIt does not appear from the record why this lease was sent to Washington for signature when it is conclusively shown that it was one of the duties of Captain Gosling, as supply officer, to procure quarters and when in this matter he acted, in addition to his own authority, under the direction of the commanding officer and in an emergency. However, the reason for the procedure, probably a good one, is not material. The circumstances are of some interest as bearing on the good faith of the supply officer as the Government\u2019s authorized rental agent and of the plaintiff in surrendering the possession of its building under a lease which it had every reason to assume would be properly executed by the United States, in connection with which it is to be noted that a three-*115months\u2019 tenancy expired without any notice within that time to the plaintiff that the lease would not be executed, although possession under the lease must have been well known in the Washington office during all that time, and also, that the tenancy was in fact terminated by just such a notice as was provided for in the lease.\nThe plaintiff sues for the amount of rent provided for in the lease (less an amount already paid) which it also proves was the fair rental value of the property, expense of returning its property to the building, a work it- was directed to undertake for itself on assurance that it would be reimbursed, damages to its property in moving and some loss occasioned by the termination of a profitable existent tenancy in a part of its building at the time it was taken over by the United States. The last of these items is not strenuously urged and there is apparent no basis upon which it can be predicated. Neither does it seem to us possible upon any theory to permit a recovery for the alleged damages done to plaintiff\u2019s property in connection with its removal.\nThere remains the question of the recovery of the rental either at the rate provided in the lease as agreed upon between the parties or at its fair value as shown and found and the expense to which plaintiff was put in returning its property to its building at the expiration of the tenancy. And it may here be noted that the findings of fact fix the rental value of the property at the same amount provided in the lease, in addition to the cost to the plaintiff of removing and returning its property, also provided for therein. It is not necessary, therefore, to discuss in detail any one of the two or three different theories under which the plaintiff might and we believe is entitled to recover, or to discriminate with nicety between the different theories and their applicability.\nThe plaintiff relies upon the Dent Act, 40 Stat. 1272. The defendant\u2019s position is that the lease not having been \u201c reduced to writing and signed by the contracting parties with their names at the end thereof,\u201d as required by section 3744, ^Revised Statutes, \u201c the question involved in this case is the rental value of the property.\u201d We might leave the case where the defendant has thus put it, for the result *116is apparent. But it is our understanding that the purpose of the Dent Act in the main was to provide relief from the infirmities under which parties dealing with the Government found themselves by reason of the fact that their contracts had not been formally executed as required by the statute cited. And the conditions of such relief recited in the first section of the act seem to be broad enough to cover this case.\nBut, aside from this feature of the case, this contract was fully performed and, as said, so iierformed before any notice to the plaintiff that it would not be executed as required by law. It has frequently been held that the invalidity of a contract is immaterial after it has been performed.\nAnd if it could be successfully contended that relief is not to be found in the Dent Act or upon the contract because it was fully performed, there would remain the right, as upon an implied contract, to recover the fair rental value of the property. It would seem that no further discussion was necessary.\nUpon any one of these theories the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the sum of $4,145.18.\nGraham, Judge; Hat, Judge; Booth, Judge, and Campbell, Chief Justice, concur.\n",
