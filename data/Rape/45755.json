Procedural History and Factual Background\n\n\u00b62         In 1983, brothers Henry McCollum and Leon Brown were convicted of the rape\n\n     and murder of 11-year-old Sabrina Buie and sentenced to death. On appeal, the\n\n     North Carolina Supreme Court granted McCollum and Brown new trials. See State\n\n     v. McCollum, 321 N.C. 557, 364 S.E.2d 112 (1988). McCollum was retried and again\n\n     convicted of first-degree rape and first-degree murder. The trial court arrested\n\n     judgment on the rape conviction and sentenced McCollum to death for the murder\n\n     conviction. At sentencing, the jury found as mitigating circumstances that McCollum\n\n     \u201cwas mentally retarded, that the offense was committed while he was under the\n\n     influence of mental or emotional disturbance, that he is easily influenced by others,\n\n     and [that] he has difficulty thinking clearly under stress.\u201d\n\n\u00b63         Brown was retried, convicted of first-degree rape, and sentenced to life in\n\n     prison. In the trial court\u2019s judgment, it recommended Brown receive psychological\n\n     treatment in prison. On appeal, this Court found no error, but the opinion included\n\n     the trial court\u2019s order denying a motion to suppress which found that Brown \u201chas an\n\n     I.Q. variously tested between 49 and 65, but has been generally classified as suffering\n\n     from mild mental retardation[.]\u201d State v. Brown, 112 N.C. App. 390, 393, 436 S.E.2d\n\n     163, 165 (1993).\n\n\u00b64         In April 1995, McCollum was represented by Kenneth Rose, an attorney with\n\n     the Center for Death Penalty Litigation, and attorneys from Wilmer Hale, in filing a\n\f                                   N.C. STATE BAR V. MEGARO\n\n                                         2022-NCCOA-718\n\n                                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n     motion for appropriate relief (\u201cMAR\u201d).       The MAR alleged that an incriminating\n\n     statement made by McCollum was unreliable due to his intellectual disabilities,\n\n     which were established by opinions from four mental health professionals.\n\n\u00b65         In January 2002, Rose represented McCollum in filing an amended MAR\n\n     \u201cbased on [McCollum\u2019s] subaverage intellectual functioning and significant\n\n     limitations in adaptive functioning.\u201d In support of the MAR, McCollum submitted a\n\n     2002 affidavit of Dr. Rogers in which Dr. Rogers averred that \u201cin her 1995 testing\n\n     McCollum had a full-scale IQ of 68 and significant subaverage intellectual\n\n     functioning that placed him in the lowest 2-3 percent of the population in overall\n\n     intellectual functioning.\u201d McCollum also submitted a 2002 affidavit of Dr. Rumer,\n\n     who averred that McCollum \u201chad a history of subaverage scores on intellectual\n\n     testing with full-scale scores of 56, 61 and 69, and adaptive functioning deficits.\u201d\n\n\u00b66         In August 2014, Rose and Vernetta Alston, also an attorney with the Center\n\n     for Death Penalty Litigation, filed an MAR alleging McCollum was innocent based in\n\n     part on results of DNA testing done on a cigarette butt found at the scene of the\n\n     murder; the DNA did not match either brother, but instead matched an inmate \u201cthen\n\n     serving a life sentence for the murder of a woman in the same area as Buie, a month\n\n     after Buie\u2019s murder.\u201d Brown filed a similar MAR through separate counsel. The trial\n\n     court granted McCollum\u2019s and Brown\u2019s MARs, vacated their convictions and\n\n     judgments, and released them from prison after having served 31 years.\n\f                                  N.C. STATE BAR V. MEGARO\n\n                                        2022-NCCOA-718\n\n                                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n\u00b67         Attorneys Mike Lewis, Mark Rabil, and Tom Howlett agreed to represent\n\n     McCollum and Brown on a contingency fee basis in civil litigation for the alleged\n\n     misconduct of law enforcement officers involved in the investigation and prosecution\n\n     of the brothers. Rose, Alston, and attorneys with Wilmer Hale agreed to represent\n\n     McCollum and Brown on a pro bono basis to file pardon petitions with the governor\n\n     and to seek compensation in the Industrial Commission as persons wrongfully\n\n     convicted of felonies, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 148-84. On 11 September 2014,\n\n     Rose and Alston filed petitions for pardons of innocence on behalf of the brothers. On\n\n     15 September 2014, Rose and Alston received notice from the Clemency\n\n     Administrator that \u201c[a]ll necessary documents have been received and this request is\n\n     now being processed. You will be notified when a decision has been made on this\n\n     request.\u201d After McCollum\u2019s and Brown\u2019s cases caught the attention of the media,\n\n     \u201cMcCollum and Brown began receiving charitable donations and financial assistance\n\n     from various sources[.]\u201d\n\n\u00b68         In January 2015, Kim Weekes and Deborah Pointer, who were not attorneys\n\n     and who referred to themselves as \u201cconsultant advisors,\u201d contacted Brown\u2019s sister,\n\n     Geraldine Brown Ransom, claiming they could help McCollum and Brown. Weekes\n\n     and Pointer entered into an agreement with Ransom, who was not a guardian for\n\n     either McCollum or Brown at that point, to serve as activists for the brothers and to\n\n     assist with their pardon process. Weekes and Pointer notified Rose that they were\n\f                                   N.C. STATE BAR V. MEGARO\n\n                                         2022-NCCOA-718\n\n                                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       authorized to represent McCollum and Brown \u201cin all and any of the Civil/Litigation\n\n       of the Pardon/Fundraising of NC matters.\u201d\n\n\u00b69           Weekes and Pointer contacted Defendant about representing the brothers.\n\n       Defendant \u201cread news accounts of McCollum and Brown\u2019s cases, reviewed transcripts\n\n       of their MAR hearings that he found online, and did preliminary research on their\n\n       cases.\u201d Before Defendant met with McCollum and Brown, Pointer warned Defendant\n\n       that Ransom requested that Defendant refrain from discussing money amounts in\n\n       front of the brothers. Pointer also told Defendant that Ransom would give the\n\n       brothers a monthly stipend. Defendant entered into a representation agreement with\n\n       McCollum, Brown, and Ransom.       At the time they entered into the agreement,\n\n       petitions for pardons had already been filed for McCollum and Brown.            The\n\n       representation agreement provided the following: Defendant would collect a\n\n       contingency fee of 27-33% of any monetary recovery from Robeson County, the Red\n\n       Springs Police Department, and the State of North Carolina; McCollum and Brown\n\n       were conveying to Defendant an irrevocable interest in net proceeds arising from any\n\n       recovery; and Defendant was entitled to the contingency interest in the outcome of\n\n       the case regardless of whether McCollum and Brown terminated the representation\n\n       agreement.\n\n\u00b6 10         Defendant began working with Multi Funding, Inc., to obtain \u201cimmediate\n\n       funding through loans\u201d for McCollum and Brown. Defendant advanced $1,000 cash\n\f                                    N.C. STATE BAR V. MEGARO\n\n                                           2022-NCCOA-718\n\n                                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       to each McCollum and Brown and facilitated the brothers each getting loans from\n\n       Multi Funding for $100,000 at 19% interest, compounded every six months.\n\n       Defendant ensured that Weekes and Pointer were paid $10,000 from the initial loan\n\n       proceeds to the brothers. Defendant sent letters to Rose and Howlett, \u201cwarning them\n\n       to never contact McCollum and Brown again as it would violate the \u2018rules of ethics\u2019\n\n       and would be \u2018actionable as tortious interference of contract.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00b6 11         After the governor granted pardons of innocence to the brothers, Defendant\n\n       filed a joint petition in the Industrial Commission seeking compensation for\n\n       McCollum and Brown, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 148-84. The attachments to the\n\n       petition were almost exclusively the work product of Rose and Alston. Defendant also\n\n       filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North\n\n       Carolina on behalf of the brothers against various parties alleged to be responsible\n\n       for their wrongful conviction and incarceration. In August 2015, Brown, who suffers\n\n       from bi-polar disorder and schizophrenia, was hospitalized after a breakdown.\n\n       Defendant filed a petition in Cumberland County to have Brown declared\n\n       incompetent and proposed that Ransom be appointed Brown\u2019s guardian.\n\n\u00b6 12         On 2 September 2015, after a brief hearing, McCollum and Brown were each\n\n       awarded $750,000, the statutorily mandated amount of compensation under N.C.\n\n       Gen. Stat. \u00a7 148-84. Defendant was issued a check for $1.5 million; Defendant took\n\f                                    N.C. STATE BAR V. MEGARO\n\n                                          2022-NCCOA-718\n\n                                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       $500,000 as a contingency fee. The brothers were left with $500,000 each, and of this\n\n       money:\n\n                    Defendant used nearly $110,000.00 each of McCollum and\n                    Brown\u2019s     Industrial Commission     award,    totaling\n                    $220,000.00, to repay the loans he facilitated their\n                    obtaining . . . .\n                    Defendant charged a combined total of $21,173.88 in costs\n                    and expenses to McCollum and Brown for the Industrial\n                    Commission process. These charges included costs related\n                    to the pardon process and related to Brown\u2019s incompetency\n                    proceeding.\n                    Defendant used $25,972.14 of the Industrial Commission\n                    award to repay money he and his firm advanced to\n                    McCollum and Brown prior to their Industrial Commission\n                    award[.]\n\n\u00b6 13         After these deductions, Defendant disbursed $358,363.28 to McCollum. After\n\n       McCollum spent all the funds, Defendant helped McCollum obtain a second loan for\n\n       $50,000 at 18% interest, compounded every six months.          Defendant facilitated\n\n       McCollum obtaining a third loan for $15,000 at 18% interest, compounded every six\n\n       months. After Ransom was removed as Brown\u2019s guardian for mismanaging his funds,\n\n       Defendant helped Ransom \u201cget a $25,000.00 loan from [Multi Funding] against any\n\n       future recovery made by Brown, with the loan proceeds sent to [Ransom] purportedly\n\n       for Brown\u2019s rent.\u201d As a result of the loan, Multi Funding perfected a lien for $25,000\n\n       against any future recovery made by Brown.\n\f                                   N.C.

In anticipation of submitting a settlement proposal, Defendant engaged\n\n       Dr. Thomas Harbin to evaluate McCollum\u2019s competency to enter into a settlement\n\n       agreement. Despite contrary findings in an earlier report, Dr. Harbin concluded that\n\n       \u201cMcCollum was able to manage his own financial and legal affairs, and to make or\n\n       communicate important decisions concerning his person and finances.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 16         In April 2017, Defendant submitted a settlement proposal for McCollum and\n\n       Brown\u2019s civil suit for $500,000 each to the federal District Court. Defendant claimed\n\n       that the brothers were competent to enter into the representation agreement and the\n\n       settlement agreement and asked the Court to approve the settlement and\n\n       Defendant\u2019s 33% fee. The proposed settlement provided that the liens securing the\n\n       Multi Funding loans would be paid out of the settlement proceeds, leaving McCollum\n\n       with $178,035.58 and Brown with $403,493.96. During a hearing related to approval\n\n       of the proposed settlement, federal District Court Judge Terrance Boyle rejected Dr.\n\f                                   N.C. STATE BAR V.

Tarlton filed a motion asking the Court\n\n       to determine whether Defendant\u2019s representation agreement with McCollum was\n\n       valid based on McCollum\u2019s incapacity. Defendant filed a motion to discharge Tarlton\n\n       as Guardian Ad Litem and to halt any further inquiry as to McCollum\u2019s competency.\n\n       Judge Boyle entered an order directing Dr. George Corvin to conduct a competency\n\n       evaluation for McCollum.\n\n\u00b6 17         Dr. Corvin submitted a comprehensive report, finding that McCollum \u201cclearly\n\n       suffers from psychological and intellectual limitations impairing his ability to\n\n       manage his own affairs and make/communicate important decisions regarding his\n\n       life without the assistance of others.\u201d Judge Boyle entered an order finding that\n\n       McCollum was incompetent to manage his own affairs and that the representation\n\n       agreement between Defendant and McCollum was invalid. The Court approved the\n\n       settlement proposal, but not Defendant\u2019s fee.           Defendant was terminated as\n\n       McCollum\u2019s counsel by Tarlton. Defendant\u2019s law partner filed a motion challenging\n\n       Tarlton\u2019s authority to terminate Defendant. The federal District Court ordered\n\n       Defendant removed from the case for good cause shown. On 29 January 2021, Dr.\n\n       Corvin evaluated McCollum to determine whether McCollum was competent to enter\n\n       into a representation agreement with Defendant, and whether McCollum was\n\n       competent to enter into loan agreements with Multi Funding. Dr. Corvin found:\n\f               N.C. STATE BAR V.

McCollum\u2019s intellectual\ndisorders are known to be static in nature, meaning there\nis no known treatment to reverse the cognitive limitations\ninherent in such conditions;\nMcCollum continued to display evidence of impaired\nexecutive functioning (above and beyond that associated\nwith his known intellectual developmental disorder)\nstemming from his previously diagnosed neurocognitive\ndisorder.   McCollum tends to make decisions about\ncircumstances (and people) in a rather impulsive manner\nwithout consideration of (or adequate understanding of)\nthe subtleties and complexities that are most commonly\nassociated with such decisions;\nMcCollum continues to experience symptoms consistent\nwith a diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\nstemming from his prior lengthy incarceration on death\nrow after having been convicted of a crime that he did not\ncommit. McCollum experiences intense physiological and\npsychological reactivity (i.e., flashbacks) when he sees\npolice officers in his community, stating that when he sees\nthem \u2018it makes me think of what happened to me, it scares\nme. It reminds me of what happened out there\u2019;\nMcCollum has been unable to pass the written portion of\nthe test to obtain a driver\u2019s license. McCollum agreed to\n\u2018sign the papers\u2019 to engage Defendant\u2019s representation\nbecause \u2018he gave us money. I agreed to sign the papers for\nhim to handle my pardon and civil suit \u2013 because he gave\nus money, found me a better place. But he had me fooled.\u2019\nRegarding Defendant, McCollum \u2018thought he was doing a\ngood job, but I didn\u2019t know that he was taking that much\nmoney.

Moreover, in order to satisfy the evidentiary\n                    requirements of the whole-record test in an attorney\n                    disciplinary action, the evidence used by the DHC to\n                    support its findings and conclusions must rise to the\n                    standard of clear, cogent, and convincing.\n\n       N.C.

Defendant does not challenge any of the remaining 129\n\n       findings of fact, stating that \u201c[t]he word limit under the Rules prevents further\n\n       dissection of all the factual findings in the Order of Discipline.\u201d The remaining\n\n       findings of fact are thus binding on appeal.

McCollum\u2019s intellectual\n             disorders are known to be static in nature, meaning there\n             is no known treatment to reverse the cognitive limitations\n             inherent in such conditions[.]\n\nOther relevant unchallenged findings of fact include:\n\n             37. McCollum and Brown were easily manipulated and\n             were particularly susceptible to manipulation and\n             financial coercion, given their intellectual disabilities,\n             decades in prison, and relative poverty.\n             ...\n             47. . . .

MEGARO\n\n                                             2022-NCCOA-718\n\n                                            Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n\u00b6 30         The DHC is given broad disciplinary discretion. \u201cMisconduct by any attorney\n\n       shall be grounds for . . . [s]uspension for a period up to but not exceeding five years,\n\n       any portion of which may be stayed upon reasonable conditions to which the offending\n\n       attorney consents[.]\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 84-28(c)(2) (2021). \u201cAny order disbarring or\n\n       suspending    an   attorney   may      impose     reasonable   conditions   precedent   to\n\n       reinstatement.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 84-28(c).\n\n\u00b6 31         Defendant received $500,000 for preparing compensation petitions and\n\n       attending the Industrial Commission hearing on behalf of McCollum and Brown.\n\n       Defendant\u2019s attachments to the petitions for compensation were almost exclusively\n\n       Rose and Alston\u2019s work product.         The transcript for the Industrial Commission\n\n       hearing is seven pages long and \u201c[t]he State did not oppose compensation for\n\n       McCollum and Brown[.]\u201d A contingent fee for the representation in the Industrial\n\n       Commission was improper because McCollum and Brown were \u201centitled to the\n\n       maximum compensation authorized by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 148-84: $750,000 each.\u201d The\n\n       $250,000 restitution payment ordered by the DHC is a conservative estimate of the\n\n       amount Defendant collected that he was not entitled to, and a generous assessment\n\n       of the value of Defendant\u2019s services in the Industrial Commission proceeding.\n\n\u00b6 32         Based on the whole record, clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supports the\n\n       $250,000 restitution payment to McCollum and Brown.\n\f                                   N.C. STATE BAR V. MEGARO\n\n                                         2022-NCCOA-718\n\n                                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n          C. Discrepancies between Written Order and Oral Findings\n\n\u00b6 33         Defendant contends that the written Order is at odds with the DHC\u2019s oral\n\n       findings. This contention lacks merit.\n\n\u00b6 34         After deliberations, the chair of the hearing panel announced the discipline the\n\n       DHC was imposing on Defendant:\n\n                   The license of Patrick Megaro is suspended for a period of\n                   five years. He may reapply after three years with the\n                   following terms and conditions:\n                   Number one, that he pay the costs of this action;\n                   Number two, that he pay restitution in the amount of\n                   $250,000 with $125,000 going to the guardian ad litem for\n                   each of Mr. McCollum and Mr. Brown;\n                   Number three, that prior to being readmitted into practice\n                   that he complete ten hours of ethical -- ethics continuing\n                   legal education;\n                   Number four, that upon application to reinstate his license,\n                   that Mr. Megaro be supervised by an attorney that is\n                   approved by the State Bar, and that that supervision will\n                   take place for at least two years.\n                   That\u2019s the ruling of the panel.\n\n\u00b6 35         There is no discrepancy between the chair\u2019s announcement and the written\n\n       Order, which imposes a five-year suspension with conditions for reinstatement and\n\n       permits Defendant to apply for a stay of the remainder of the suspension after three\n\n       years if he satisfies the reinstatement conditions. The oral announcement of the DHC\n\n       decision was not a comprehensive recitation of the 24-page Order because \u201c[a] trial\n\n       judge cannot be expected to enter in open court immediately after trial the detailed\n\f                                    N.C.

MEGARO\n\n                                             2022-NCCOA-718\n\n                                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       findings of fact and conclusions of law that are generally required for a final\n\n       judgment.\u201d Morris v. Bailey, 86 N.C. App. 378, 389, 358 S.E.2d 120, 127 (1987).\n\n\u00b6 36         There is no merit to Defendant\u2019s argument that the additional level of detail\n\n       in the DHC\u2019s written Order is a discrepancy.\n\n          D. Equal Protection Argument\n\n\u00b6 37         Defendant contends that the North Carolina State Bar violated his rights to\n\n       Due Process and Equal Protection because \u201cthe Rules of Professional Conduct [we]re\n\n       selectively enforced against [him].\u201d This constitutional question was not raised in the\n\n       lower tribunal and may not be raised for the first time in this Court. See Lane v. Iowa\n\n       Mut. Ins. Co., 258 N.C. 318, 322, 128 S.E.2d 398, 400 (1962) (citations omitted).\n\n       Defendant\u2019s equal protection argument is not properly before the Court, and we\n\n       decline to address it.\n\n                                      III.     Conclusion\n\n          The Order is affirmed.\n\n             AFFIRMED.\n\n             Judges DIETZ and CARPENTER concur.\n\f",
