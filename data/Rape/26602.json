On\n\ndirect appeal,\n\n        Appellant claim[ed] that the trial court erred in denying his\n        request for instructions on the use of deadly force for the\n        protection of others and to prevent the commission of a crime.\n        In both such instances, the charge \u201cmust be given upon request\n        where the jury would have a possible basis for finding it.\u201d\n        Commonwealth v. [Carl] Brown, 421 A.2d 660, 662 (Pa.\n        1980). We have reviewed [the trial court]\u2019s opinion, dated\n        November 16, 200[1], and we conclude that the trial court was\n        correct in determining that there was no basis for the jury\n        finding for Appellant on either one of these defenses. We adopt\n        that portion of [the trial court]\u2019s opinion discussing this issue for\n        purposes of further appellate review.\n\nCommonwealth           v.

Super. filed December 31, 2002).\n\nThe above-referenced portion of the trial court opinion is as follows:\n\n        The final issue raised by [Appellant] is that the [trial c]ourt erred\n        in not giving the jury instruction of defense of others and\n        preventing the commission of a crime. A trial court should not\n        instruct the jury on legal principles that have no application to\n        the facts presented at trial because it may cause confusion and\n        place obstacles in the path of a true verdict.

Stonehouse dealt with the\n        battered woman syndrome.

Id[.] at 60. The [C]ourt . . . stated \u201cthe\n     ultimate test for adequate provocation remains whether a\n     reasonable man, confronted with this series of events, became\n     impassioned to the extent that his mind was incapable of cool\n     reflection.\u201d In this case there is no evidence of physical or\n     psychological abuse occurring to either [Appellant] or his\n     daughter. There are no series of events leading up to the act.\n     The requirements for 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. Section 506 -\n     Justification, use of force for the protection of other persons, are\n     that the use of force upon or toward another person is justifiable\n     when (1) the defendant would be justified under \u00a7505 (self-\n     defense) in using such force to protect himself against the injury\n     he believes to be threatened to the other person he seeks to\n     protect, (2) defendant believes the circumstances would justify\n     the person he is seeking to protect to use such protective force,\n     and (3) defendant believes intervention is necessary for the\n     protection of such other person. Section 505 states that use of\n     force toward another is justifiable when defendant believes such\n     force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting\n     himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person.\n     18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7505. Section 505(b)(2) states that\n     deadly force is not justifiable under this section unless defendant\n     believes such force is necessary to protect himself against death,\n     serious bodily injury, kidnapping or sexual intercourse compelled\n     by force or threat. Id. [Appellant] testified that when he\n     opened the door where his daughter was he saw [the\n     murder victim] sleeping and holding [the child]\u2019s hand on\n     his penis. (N.T., July 12, 2001, at 107). Then he stated\n     [the murder victim] lunged at him and he fired the gun.\n     (N.T., July 12, 2001, at 108). These circumstances do not\n     meet the requirements for use of force for the protection of\n     another. [Appellant\u2019s child] was not in immediate danger of\n     death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping or sexual intercourse\n     compelled by force or threat nor was unlawful force being used\n     against her. Therefore [Appellant]\u2019s request for this instruction\n     was properly denied.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, filed November 16, 2001, at 8-9 (emphasis added)\n\n(some formatting).\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fJ-S27031-19\n\n\n        On December 31, 2002, this Court affirmed the judgment of sentence\n\nin its entirety.

Commonwealth v. Bender (\u201cBender VI\u201d), 53 A.3d 924, No. 107\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fJ-S27031-19\n\n\nWDA 2012, unpublished memorandum at 1, 4 (Pa. Super. filed June 4,\n\n2012). This Court stated:\n\n     Appellant claimed at trial that the victim was sexually molesting\n     his then two-year old daughter, so he entered the house and\n     bedroom to take his daughter away, and shot the victim when\n     he lunged at Appellant.2 (See id., 7/12/01, at 108).\n        2Appellant did not in fact remove his daughter. (See N.T.\n        Trial, 7/12/01, at 132).\n\n     ...\n\n     When reviewing an order denying a motion for post-conviction\n     DNA testing, this Court determines whether the movant satisfied\n     the statutory requirements set forth in PCRA section 9543.1. . . .\n\n        In any motion under subsection (a) [authorizing\n        application for DNA testing], under penalty of perjury, the\n        applicant shall . . . specify the evidence to be tested; [ ]\n        assert the applicant\u2019s actual innocence of the offense for\n        which the applicant was convicted; and . . . present a\n        prima facie case demonstrating that the:\n\n            (i) identity of or the participation in the crime by the\n            perpetrator was at issue in the proceedings that\n            resulted in the applicant\u2019s conviction and sentencing;\n            and\n\n            (ii) DNA testing of the specific evidence, assuming\n            exculpatory results, would establish:\n\n                  (A) the applicant\u2019s actual innocence of\n                  the offense for which the applicant was\n                  convicted[.]\n\n     42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9543.1(c).\n\n     Here, Appellant argues, in effect, that DNA evidence could link\n     the deceased victim to his claim at trial that the victim was\n     molesting his then two-year old daughter. (See Appellant\u2019s\n     Brief, at 15). Appellant posits that such evidence would warrant\n     reconsideration of his claim of \u201cdefense of another\u201d at trial. . . .\n\n     [T]he PCRA court properly determined that Appellant\u2019s basic DNA\n     claim does not merit relief.    The most obvious defect of\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJ-S27031-19\n\n\n      Appellant\u2019s argument at the hearing and on appeal is his bald,\n      unsupported attempt to use his claimed suspicions of\n      molestation by the victim to make the victim the \u201cperpetrator\u201d\n      within the meaning of the PCRA DNA testing statute. (See, e.g.,\n      Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 9, 11, 24); see also 42 Pa.C.S.A.\n      \u00a7 9543.1(c)(3)(i) (applicant must \u201cpresent a prima facie case\n      demonstrating that the . . . identity of or the participation in the\n      crime by the perpetrator was at issue in the proceedings that\n      resulted in the applicant\u2019s conviction and sentencing[.]\u201d).\n\n      In this case, Appellant is the perpetrator, and the only\n      perpetrator, of the crimes for which the jury convicted him.\n      Appellant\u2019s attempt to make the victim the perpetrator is\n      unsupported by law or fact, and is, therefore, frivolous and\n      utterly without merit. Indeed, Appellant concedes that he shot\n      the victim; he only argues that he had a reason. That is not\n      enough to satisfy the statutory requirements. Thus, Appellant\n      fails to show that \u201cDNA testing of the specific evidence,\n      assuming exculpatory results, would establish . . . the applicant\u2019s\n      actual innocence of the offense for which the applicant\n      was convicted[.]\u201d      Id. at \u00a7 9543.1(c)(3)(i) (ii) (emphasis\n      added). . . . DNA evidence, even if found, would not disprove\n      Appellant\u2019s conceded identity as the shooter.\n\nId. at 2, 5-9.\n\n      On March 17, 2015, this Court affirmed the dismissal of Appellant\u2019s\n\nPCRA petition immediately prior to the current one -- his sixth, not counting\n\nthe motion for DNA -- in which Appellant had challenged the propriety of the\n\nboilerplate form he had used to file his first pro se PCRA petition. Bender\n\nVIII, No. 1637 WDA 2014, unpublished memorandum at 1, 3.\n\n      On May 23, 2018, Appellant pro se filed the current PCRA petition, his\n\nseventh. Appellant concedes that the petition is untimely, as it \u201cis outside\n\nthe one-year statutory limit,\u201d because it was not \u201cfiled within one year of the\n\ndate that [his] conviction became final[.]\u201d PCRA Petition, 5/23/2018, at 2\n\n(citing   42   Pa.C.S.   \u00a7   9545(b)(1)).   However,    he   alleges   that   the\n\n                                      -6-\n\fJ-S27031-19\n\n\n\u201cgovernmental interference exception\u201d to the time bar applies, because\n\n\u201cprior district attorneys\u201d interfered with his ability to present evidence, such\n\nas \u201csuppressed\u201d \u201cmaterial DNA discovery\u201d that the murder victim sexually\n\nabused children, including Appellant\u2019s child.         PCRA Memorandum of Law,\n\n05/23/2018, at i-ii (unnecessary capitalization omitted). He continues that\n\nthis   \u201cgovernmental      interference\u201d       prevented   him   from     presenting\n\n\u201csubstantive defenses of (1) . . . use of force for the protection of other\n\npersons [and] (2) use of force to prevent the commission of crime.\u201d Id. at\n\ni-ii, 1 (unnecessary capitalization omitted). Appellant summarizes:\n\n       This continuing governmental interference violates deeply rooted\n       public policy of the Commonwealth thus not subjecting this\n       matter to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544 (Previous litigation and waiver) as\n       this matter is an on-going and continuing governmental\n       interference of, inter alia, ignoring, covering-up, suppressing and\n       intentionally misstating material evidence and testimony of\n       sexual abuse of children in violation of substantive based laws\n       enacted by the Pennsylvania legislature and additional\n       substantive based laws as demonstrated supra.\n\nId. at 1.\n\n       On June 25, 2018, the PCRA court entered a notice of intent to dismiss\n\nall claims without a hearing pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 907. Appellant filed a\n\nresponse dated July 8, 2018, and entered on the docket on July 12, 2018.\n\nThe    response   did   not    request   to   amend    the   PCRA   petition.   On\n\nSeptember 26, 2018,      the    PCRA     court   dismissed   Appellant\u2019s   petition.\n\nAccording to the certified docket, the dismissal order was not mailed to\n\nAppellant until October 1, 2018.\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fJ-S27031-19\n\n\n       Appellant filed a notice of appeal and a concise statement of errors\n\ncomplained of on appeal on October 29, 2018, and a second notice of appeal\n\nand concise statement of errors on October 31, 2018.               This Court\n\nconsolidated the appeals on November 20, 2018.4\n\n       Appellant presents the following issues for our review:\n\n       1.     Whether the [PCRA] court abused its discretion when the\n       [PCRA] court notified Appellant in the 08/28/18[5] order that\n       Appellant\u2019s 07/08/18 objections to the court\u2019s 06/25/18 order of\n       it \u201c907 Notice of Intent to Dismiss\u201d were not filed where the\n       certified docket entry of 07/12/18 patently demonstrate that\n       Appellant\u2019s material and pertinent objections were timely filed\n       warranting a remand for adjudication of the substantive merits?\n\n       2.    Whether the [PCRA] court abused its discretion in denying\n       Appellant\u2019s   subsequent      PCRA     invoking     42     Pa.C.S.\n       \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i) (governmental interference exception) and\n       ruling on the substantive merits that are demonstrated in the\n       pertinent and material pleading and facts of record that implicate\n       matter of Federal and Commonwealth deeply rooted public\n       policy?\n\n       3.     Should not the [PCRA] court enter an order of recusal in\n       the important public policy related matter where the [PCRA]\n       court\u2019s action/inaction itself constitutes further governmental\n       interference with the presentation of Appellant\u2019s substantive\n       based claims?\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 4.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n4 On January 29, 2019, the PCRA court entered a statement in lieu of\nopinion.\n5 Nothing appears on the certified docket or in the certified record for\nAugust 28, 2018.

Lavar Brown, 196 A.3d 130,\n\n150 (Pa. 2018)).\n\n       The    timeliness     of   a   post-conviction   petition   is   jurisdictional.\n\nCommonwealth v. Hernandez, 79 A.3d 649, 651 (Pa. Super. 2013).\n\nGenerally, a petition for relief under the PCRA, including a second or\n\nsubsequent petition, must be filed within one year of the date the judgment\n\nof sentence is final, \u201cunless the petition alleges and the petitioner proves\u201d\n\none of the three exceptions to the time limitations for filing the petition set\n\nforth in section 9545(b) of the statute. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1).6 In\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n6   The three exceptions to the timeliness requirement are:\n\n       (i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of\n       interference by government officials with the presentation of the\n       claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this\n       Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States;\n\n       (ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown\n       to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the\n       exercise of due diligence; or\n\n       (iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was\n       recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States or the\n       Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in\n       this section and has been held by that court to apply\n       retroactively.\n\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii).\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fJ-S27031-19\n\n\nthe current action, the PCRA court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over\n\nAppellant\u2019s seventh PCRA petition, because the petition was untimely and\n\nfailed to satisfy any exception to the PCRA\u2019s time bar.\n\n      \u201c[T]he date on which the judgment of sentence became final . . . in\n\nthis case is January 30, 2003, one year after Appellant\u2019s time to petition for\n\nallowance of appeal to our Supreme Court expired.           Appellant\u2019s petition\n\nplainly does not meet the time bar.\u201d       Bender VIII, No. 1637 WDA 2014,\n\nunpublished memorandum at 2-3.\n\n      Appellant   attempts   to   invoke     the   \u201cgovernmental   interference\u201d\n\nexception to the time bar, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i). PCRA Memorandum\n\nof Law, 05/23/2018, at i-ii, 1.    Appellant appears to be arguing that the\n\ndistrict attorney interfered by preventing him from submitting evidence at\n\nhis trial that the victim was sexually abusing children, including Appellant\u2019s\n\ndaughter. PCRA Memorandum of Law, 05/23/2018, at i-ii; Appellant\u2019s Brief\n\nat 5-6, 11-12, 19, 51. He contends:\n\n      These governmental officials have consistently distorted,\n      misstated and deliberately attempt to cover-up and suppress\n      material physical, documented and testimonial evidence\n      involving sexual abuse of children.        In violation of duly\n      promulgated statutes (laws), rules of evidence and deeply rooted\n      public policy where this continuing governmental interference is\n      \u201cin violation of the U.S. Const. or Pa. Const. or laws\u201d providing\n      the [PCRA] court with jurisdiction. It is beyond dispute that an\n      untimely PCRA must invoke an exception to 42 Pa.C.S.\n      \u00a7 9545(b) for a court to have jurisdiction to adjudicate the\n      merits of a PCRA.\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 10 -\n\fJ-S27031-19\n\n\nAppellant\u2019s   Brief   at   11-12;   see   also   PCRA   Memorandum    of   Law,\n\n05/23/2018, at 1. He additionally argues that he \u201ccan present the material\n\nDNA that has been suppressed by these governmental officials that clearly\n\nconstitute governmental interference of exposing sexual abuse of children.\u201d\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 21; see also PCRA Memorandum of Law, 05/23/2018, at\n\ni-ii.\n\n        Appellant provides no explanation as to how or why district attorneys\n\nor any other government official interfered in his ability to present evidence.\n\nSee generally Appellant\u2019s Brief; PCRA Memorandum of Law, 05/23/2018.\n\nThe PCRA requires that \u201cthe petitioner proves\u201d one of the three exceptions,\n\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1) (emphasis added), which Appellant has failed to do.\n\n        Additionally, the governmental interference exception to the PCRA\n\ntime bar requires that \u201cthe failure to raise the claim previously was the\n\nresult of interference by government officials . . .\u201d     Id. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i)\n\n(emphasis added).      Appellant could not have \u201cfail[ed] to raise the claim\n\npreviously,\u201d id., because he gave testimony during trial in support of his\n\nallegation that the murder victim sexually abused Appellant\u2019s child, thereby\n\njustifying Appellant\u2019s actions as defense of others and prevention of the\n\ncommission of a crime. Trial Court Opinion, filed November 16, 2001, at 8-9\n\n(citing N.T., 7/12/2001, at 107-08).       Appellant also raised this claim on\n\ndirect appeal, Bender I, No. 1319 WDA 2001, unpublished memorandum at\n\n16-17, and in a prior post-conviction motion, Bender VI, No. 107 WDA\n\n\n                                      - 11 -\n\fJ-S27031-19\n\n\n2012, unpublished memorandum at 1-2, 4-9; accordingly, again, Appellant\n\ncould not have \u201cfail[ed] to raise the claim\u201d pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.\n\n\u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i). Appellant is merely attempting to re-litigate a claim he lost\n\non direct appeal over a decade-and-a-half ago and on collateral review over\n\nsix years ago.\n\n      Appellant thus has not established an exception to the timeliness\n\nrequirement under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1). Consequently, the PCRA court\n\nwas without jurisdiction to review the merits of Appellant\u2019s claim and\n\nproperly dismissed his petition.\n\n      Having discerned no error of law, we affirm the order below. Medina,\n\n2019 PA Super 119, *8.\n\n      Order affirmed.\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
