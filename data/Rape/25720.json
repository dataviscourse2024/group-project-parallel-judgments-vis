The jury was not instructed that it must find Benson committed the\n\nrape of a child count as separate and distinct from the child molestation counts. But\n\nbecause it was manifestly apparent to the jury that the State was not seeking multiple\n\npunishments against Benson for the same act, there was no double jeopardy violation.\n\n       The trial court imposed a community custody condition that Benson cannot\n\nfrequent areas where minors are known to congregate as defined by the community\n\ncorrections officer. We agree with the parties that the condition is not sufficiently\n\ndefinite to apprise Benson of prohibited conduct and allows for arbitrary enforcement by\n\nhis community corrections officer.\n\n       Therefore, we affirm and remand with instructions to strike the unconstitutionally\n\nvague community custody condition.\n\fNo. 74815-7-1/2\n\n                                         FACTS\n\n       In 2001, when A.L.F. was seven years old, she moved with her mother and sister\n\nto Lynnwood, Washington) While A.L.F.'s mother worked at a nearby restaurant,\n\nArthur Benson, her mother's live-in boyfriend, supervised A.L.F. and her sister.\n\n       Benson began a game of \"Truth or Dare\" with A.L.F. and her sister. He showed\n\nthem his penis. By the time A.L.F. was eight years old, Benson had asked her to touch\n\nhis penis with her hand, which she did several times.\n\n       At one point, Benson put his penis in A.L.F.'s mouth. Benson engaged in other\n\nsexual activity with A.L.F. in her mother's bedroom. Benson had A.L.F. go to her\n\nmother's room, where she got on all fours on a towel, and he placed his penis against\n\nher genitals. This happened approximately seven different times. One time, Benson\n\nand A.L.F. lay in bed face-to-face and Benson put his penis on her genitals. A.L.F.\n\ntestified none of these incidents involved penetration.2\n\n       The State charged Benson with one count of first degree rape of a child and\n\nthree counts of first degree child molestation involving A.L.F.\n\n       In colloquy regarding jury instructions, the court, prosecutor, and defense\n\ncounsel discussed instructions regarding the number of counts alleged:\n\n        COURT:       Right. And it only deals with the child molestation counts,\n                     because I would say as I heard the testimony, and please\n                     correct me if I'm wrong, as I heard the testimony I only heard\n                     one act of child rape.\n\n        STATE:       Right. Rape of a child, yes.\n\n\n       I Because the victim was a minor, she will be referred to by her initials.\n       2 A.L.F. testified that on one occasion, Benson put his penis \"more inside,\" but\nthen clarified that there was no penetration. Report of Proceedings(RP)(Dec. 14,\n2015) at 96.\n\fNo. 74815-7-1/3\n\n        COURT:       Rape of a child.\n\n        DEFENSE: I'm assuming we all know what act we're talking about.\n                 We're all talking about the allegation of oral sex; correct?\n\n        STATE:       Uh-huh.\n\n        DEFENSE: We're not talking about the all fours on the bed.\n\n       STATE:        There is no penetration testified to.\n\n        COURT:       Correct. All right. So then there would be no exceptions to\n                     the giving or not giving of any of the court's instructions.[3]\n\n       The court based its to-convict instructions for first degree child molestation on\n\npattern jury instruction WPIC 44.11.4 Each instruction required the jury to find an \"act\n\nseparate and distinct from\" the other two counts of child molestation.6 The court's to-\n\nconvict instruction for the single count of first degree rape of a child was based on\n\nWPIC 44.11.6 The instruction did not require an \"act separate and distinct from\" the\n\ncounts of molestation.7 The instructions included a definition of \"sexual contact\"6 and\n\n\"sexual intercourse.\"6 The definition for \"sexual intercourse\" did not include\n\npenetration.16\n\n\n       3 RP (Dec. 16, 2015) at 11-12.\n\n      4 11 WASHINGTON PRACTICE: WASHINGTON PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS: CRIMINAL\n44.21, at 866 (4th ed. 2016)(WPIC).\n       5 CP at 75-77.\n       6 CP at 74.\n       7   Id.\n       8 CP  at 78 (\"Sexual contact means any touching of the sexual or other intimate\nparts of a person done for the purpose of gratifying sexual desires of either party.\").\n       9 CP at 79.\n       10 id.(\"Sexual intercourse means any act of sexual contact between persons\n\ninvolving the sex organs of one person and the mouth or anus of another whether such\npersons are of the same or opposite sex.\").\n\n\n                                             3\n\fNo. 74815-7-1/4\n\n       In closing, the State elected which act it relied on for the single count of first\n\ndegree rape of a child:\n\n      Now we get to Count No. 9 and it's the only charge of rape of a child in the\n      first degree and it involves            And what we're talking about is her\n      holding his penis in her mouth. ... Sexual intercourse is what's required\n      for rape of a child in the first degree, and sexual intercourse is defined in\n      jury instruction No. 14. \"Sexual intercourse means any act of sexual\n      contact between persons involving the sex organs of one person and the\n      mouth or anus of another whether such persons are of the same or\n      opposite sex.\" So sex organs of one person, penis, mouth of another,\n      mouth or anus of another. So that's mouth on penis. That is rape ofa\n      child in the first degree.1111\n\nThe State also elected which acts it relied on for the three counts of first degree child\n\nmolestation:\n\n              Now, in regard to the other counts regarding, referring to[ALE],\n       there are three more. Okay. So there are three more counts of child\n       molestation in the first degree relating to [A.L.F.].\n\n             So what do we have with [A.L.F.]? We have her telling us that she\n       touched his penis with her hand more than one time. She actually said\n       more than one, maybe less than ten. So we have at least two.\n\n             Then we have the whole getting on all fours. She said\u2014well, let\n       me back Up. So she said he was naked. She was naked. His penis was\n       touching her vagina. That's unquestionably sexual contact. She said that\n       happened maybe seven times. I mean, that's well more than three.\n\n                And then we have the one time that was different ....\n\n              ... She said that time he wanted to try something that was\n       different. So they were both naked and his penis\u2014they were facing each\n       other that time and his penis was on her vaginal area. That's clearly\n       sexual contact. It didn't work. So they didn't do it again.\n\n              Now, it's not rape because there was no penetration. She clearly\n       said, no, his penis didn't actually go in. . . . But, anyway, that's sexual\n       contact, but it's short of penetration, so that would be child molestation.r121\n\n\n       11   RP (Dec. 16, 2015) at 227-28(emphasis added).\n       12   Id. at 229-31 (emphasis added).\n\n\n                                              4\n\fNo. 74815-7-1/5\n\n       The jury convicted Benson on all counts.\n\n       Benson appeals.\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\n                                      Double Jeopardy\n\n       Benson argues the jury instructions violated his right to be free from double\n\njeopardy because they exposed him to multiple punishments for the same offense.\n\n       \"The constitutional guaranty against double jeopardy protects a defendant\n\nagainst multiple punishments for the same offense.\"13 This court reviews a double\n\njeopardy claim de novo, and it may be raised for the first time on appea1.14 We \"may\n\nconsider insufficient instructions in light of the full record' to determine if the instructions\n\n`actually effected a double jeopardy error.'\"15\n\n       In State v. Land, this court recognized when an act of sexual intercourse involves\n\noral-genital contact only, if done for sexual gratification, that conduct is both molestation\n\nand rape.16 Because they are the same in fact and in law, they are not separately\n\npunishable.17 When both are charged, the jury instructions must require that the rape of\n\na child and child molestation counts be based on separate and distinct acts.15 The\n\nabsence of such language presents the potential for double jeopardy.19 But there is no\n\n\n             v.

We agree there was no double jeopardy violation.\n\n       In State v. Perla Fuentes, the defendant was convicted of one count of first\n\ndegree rape of a child and two counts of first degree child molestation.21 The jury\n\ninstructions for one count of rape of a child did not require that the conduct must have\n\noccurred on an occasion separate and distinct from the child molestation charges.22\n\nOur Supreme Court held it was \"manifestly apparent that the convictions were based on\n\nseparate acts because the prosecution made a point to clearly distinguish between the\n\nacts that would constitute rape of a child and those that would constitute child\n\nmolestation.\"23\n\n       The Perla Fuentes court focused on the clear election by the State in closing\n\nargument:\n\n              In the prosecutor's closing argument, he addressed count I (child\n       rape) and identified the two specific acts that occurred at the condo that\n       supported a child rape conviction. The prosecutor then addressed counts\n\n        Mutch, 171 Wn.2d at 664 (quoting State v. Berg, 147 Wn. App. 923, 931, 198\n       20\n\nP.3d 529(2009)).\n       21 179 Wn.2d 808, 823, 318 P.3d 257(2014).\n       22 id.\n\n       23 Id. at 825.\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fNo. 74815-7-1/7\n\n       III and IV, which involved child molestation that occurred during the same\n       time period as count I. The prosecutor clearly used \"rape\"and \"child\n       molestation\" to describe separate and distinct acts. He divided Perla\n       Fuentes's behaviors into two categories\u2014the acts involving penetration,\n       which constituted rape, and the other inappropriate acts, which constituted\n       molestation. And again, the defendant did not challenge the number of\n       acts or whether the acts overlapped; he challenged only J.B.'s\n       believability. The jury ultimately believed J.B.'s testimony regarding the\n       various acts that occurred at the condo.r241\n\nIn addition to a clear election in closing argument, the \"manifestly apparent\" cases\n\nrecognize other factors such as clear and distinct references to rape of a child and\n\nmolestation, separate to-convict instructions, clarity of the evidence presented at trial,\n\nand whether the defense challenged the credibility of the victim rather than the number\n\nof acts or whether the acts overlapped.25\n\n       Consistent with Perla Fuentes, the State here clearly identified the single incident\n\nof oral-genital contact during the Truth or Dare game as the incident supporting the\n\nsingle count of rape of a child. The State then identified categories of the conduct that\n\nthe State relied on for the child molestation counts: multiple incidents of A.L.F. touching\n\nBenson with her hand, a single face-to-face incident of genital-to-genital contact without\n\npenetration, and numerous incidents of genital-to-genital contact with A.L.F. on all fours\n\nwithout penetration.\n\n       The State drew a clear distinction between the alleged counts of rape of a child\n\nand child molestation, similar to the prosecutor's closing remarks in Pena Fuentes.26\n\n\n       24Id. at 825-26 (emphasis added)(citations omitted).\n      25 See id. at 825; Land, 172 Wn.

App. 109, 118-21, 332 P.3d 1142(2014).\n        26 Pena Fuentes, 179 Wn.2d at 825 (\"The prosecutor clearly used 'rape' and\n'child molestation' to describe separate and distinct acts.\").\n\n\n                                             7\n\fNo. 74815-7-1/8\n\nAdditionally, the jury received separate to-convict instructions, the evidence presented\n\nat trial did not confuse or blur the single incident of sexual intercourse by oral-genital\n\ncontact with other acts of sexual contact, and Benson focused on credibility of the victim\n\nrather than challenge the number of acts or whether the acts overlapped.\n\n       Benson's attempts to distinguish Perla Fuentes are not persuasive. Benson\n\ncontends the Perla Fuentes court relied on the prosecutor's division of the acts into two\n\ncategories: \"'acts involving penetration, which constituted rape, and the other\n\ninappropriate acts, which constituted molestation.'\"27 But Perla Fuentes is not so\n\nnarrow. The court emphasized the clarity of the prosecutor's election at closing, not the\n\nspecific categories described by the prosecutor.28\n\n       Relying on State v. Kier,29 Benson argues that an election in closing cannot cure\n\na double jeopardy violation. But the Kier court merely noted that it could not \"consider\n\nthe closing statement in isolation.\"30 Here, we do not rely on the State's closing\n\nargument in isolation. As discussed, other factors recognized in the \"manifestly\n\napparent\" cases are also present.\n\n       Alternatively, Benson contends theState's use of a unanimity instruction does\n\nnot cure a double jeopardy violation. Benson relies on State v. Borsheim.31 In that\n\ncase, this court held a unanimity instruction did not cure a double jeopardy violation\n\n\n\n\n       27 Appellant's   Reply Br. at 6(quoting Pena Fuentes, 179 Wn.2d at 825).\n       28Pena Fuentes, 179 Wn.2d at 826 (\"Because of the clarity of the prosecutor's\nclosing argument, we believe. . .\")(emphasis added).\n       28 164 Wn.2d     798, 194 P.3d 212(2008).\n       30   Id. at 813(emphasis added).\n       31   140 Wn.

None of the acts the State elected for child\n\nmolestation included oral-genital contact.\n\n       In conclusion, the State's closing argument was clear. There was no suggestion,\n\ndirect or indirect, that the act of oral-genital contact was the basis for any of the three\n\ncounts of first degree child molestation. The State clearly referred to rape of a child and\n\nchild molestation as distinct counts. And the defense challenged A.L.F.'s credibility\n\nrather than the number of acts or whether the acts overlapped.34 It was manifestly\n\napparent to the jury that the State was not seeking to impose multiple punishments for\n\nthe same act. Benson was not denied his right to be free from double jeopardy.\n\n\n\n\n       32   Id. at 370.\n       33 Benson does not assert a need for separate and distinct acts to support\nmultiple identical counts as addressed in Borsheim. See Borsheim, 140 Wn. App. at\n367; see Appellant's Br. at 1.

We agree.35\n\n                                      Appellate Costs\n\n       Appellate costs are generally awarded to the substantially prevailing party.36\n\nHowever, when a trial court makes a finding of indigency, that finding remains\n\nthroughout review \"unless the commissioner or clerk determines by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that the offender's financial circumstances have significantly improved\n\nsince the last determination of indigency.\"37\n\n       Here, Benson was found indigent on appeal by the trial court. If the State has\n\nevidence indicating that Benson's financial circumstances have significantly improved\n\nsince the trial court's finding, it may file a motion for costs with the commissioner.\n\nOtherwise, the State is not entitled to appellate costs.\n\n                        Statement of Additional Grounds for Review\n\n       In his statement of additional grounds for review, Benson denies that anything\n\never happened. He refers to his medical records, but those are not part of the record on\n\nappeal. He suggests others can confirm he was not in the household for a period of\n\ntime, but the record on appeal does not include any such information. Arguments\n\n\n\n\n       35 SeeState v.
