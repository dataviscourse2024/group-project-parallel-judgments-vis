STATE OF TENNESSEE\n\n                      Direct Appeal from the Criminal Court for Shelby County\n                                 No. P-23806    Chris Craft, Judge\n\n\n\n                       No. W2001-01976-CCA-MR3-CD - Filed April 14, 2003\n\n\n                                                      ORDER\n\n\n        The Defendant, Rodney Dimitri Caples, was originally indicted for rape of a child. He\nsubsequently entered a \u201cbest- interest\u201d plea of guilty1 to the lesser-included offense of aggravated\nsexual battery. He later filed for post-conviction relief, alleging that he had received ineffective\nassistance of counsel and that, as a result, his guilty plea was not knowing or voluntary. After an\nevidentiary hearing, the trial court denied his petition. This appeal followed.\n\n        The only proof offered by the Defendant at his post-conviction hearing was his own\ntestimony. He complained that his lawyers,2 provided by the Public Defender\u2019s office, did not\nprepare for trial and, as a result, coerced him into pleading guilty. The State called Sherry Brown,\nthe lawyer who both supervised the Defendant\u2019s first lawyer and assumed the Defendant\u2019s\nrepresentation when that lawyer left the office. Ms. Brown\u2019s testimony contradicted the Defendant\u2019s\ntestimony in numerous respects. A transcript of the Defendant\u2019s plea hearing was also admitted.\nThe trial court took the matter under advisement and subsequently entered a thorough order denying\nthe Defendant\u2019s claim for relief. In pertinent part, the Order provides:\n\n               Petitioner\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that he was coerced into entering\n       his plea, and that he didn\u2019t understand the judge\u2019s questions [at the plea hearing] due\n       to an unspecified illness, is simply not credible. This Court finds that the Public\n       Defender\u2019s office investigated his case early on, prior to the date set for his\n       preliminary hearing. His prior attorney obtained discovery, and Ms. Brown\n       explained the issues in his case with petitioner. The allegations against petitioner,\n       although serious, were simple and straightforward, pitting petitioner\u2019s possible\n       testimony against that of the 12 year old victim. After being informed on trial date\n\n\n       1\n           See North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S .Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 16 2 (1970 ).\n\n       2\n           The D efendant\u2019s initial lawyer was later replaced by Assistant Public Defender Sherry Brown.\n\f       that his attorney had left the Public Defender\u2019s officer, petitioner was told by his new\n       attorney that his case would not be going to trial, and was reset three days to allow\n       him to think about an offer of settlement. On that date, after discussing his options\n       with his new attorney, he decided to enter a best interest plea to a lesser included\n       offense. Petitioner has not suggested any additional investigation or witnesses that\n       would have induced him to change his plea or the State\u2019s offer. He has failed to carry\n       his \u201cburden of proving the allegations of fact by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d\n       Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-210(f). He has neither shown that his attorney was\n       deficient nor that he was prejudiced by her representation, and this Court finds that\n       his plea was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made.\n\n\n        The evidence does not preponderate against the trial court\u2019s findings of fact. No error of law\nrequiring a reversal of the judgment is apparent on the record. Based upon a thorough reading of the\nrecord, the briefs of the parties, and the law governing the issues presented for review, the judgment\nof the trial court is affirmed in accordance with Rule 20 of the Court of Criminal Appeals of\nTennessee.\n\n        Because it appears to the Court that the Appellant, Rodney Dimitri Caples, is indigent, costs\nare assessed against the State of Tennessee.\n\n\n\n                                                       ___________________________________\n                                                       DAVID H.
