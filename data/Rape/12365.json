EMMETT LAMON ROSEMAN\n\n             Direct Appeal from the Circuit Court for Marshall County\n       Nos. 12CR142, 12CR143, 13CR7, 13CR8, 13CR9        Lee Russell, Judge\n\n\n                No. M2013-02150-CCA-R3-CD - Filed August 19, 2014\n\n\nThe appellant, Emmett Lamon Roseman, pled guilty to possession of marijuana, the sale of\ncrack cocaine, the delivery of crack cocaine, and three counts of failure to appear. The trial\ncourt imposed a total effective sentence of twenty years in the Tennessee Department of\nCorrection. On appeal, the appellant challenges the length of the sentences and the\nimposition of consecutive sentencing. Upon review, we affirm the judgments of the trial\ncourt.\n\n     Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgments of the Circuit Court are\n                                     Affirmed.\n\nN ORMA M CG EE O GLE, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which T HOMAS T. W OODALL\nand A LAN E. G LENN, JJ., joined.\n\nMichael Auffinger, Lewisburg, Tennessee, for the appellant, Emmett Lamon Roseman.\n\nRobert E. Cooper, Jr., Attorney General and Reporter; Meredith DeVault, Senior Counsel;\nRobert James Carter, District Attorney General; and Weakley E. Barnard, Assistant District\nAttorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                         OPINION\n\n       On September 13, 2013, the appellant pled guilty to possession of a Schedule VI\ncontrolled substance, namely marijuana, with the intent to sell, a Class E felony; to sale of\na Schedule II controlled substance, namely crack cocaine, a Class B felony; and to delivery\nof a Schedule II controlled substance, namely crack cocaine, a Class B felony. The appellant\npled guilty on a separate indictment to failure to appear on a statutory rape charge on January\n15, 2013; to failure to appear on a charge of possession of a Schedule VI controlled\nsubstance with the intent to sell on January 8, 2013; and to failure to appear on a charge of\n\fpossession of a Schedule VI controlled substance with the intent to sell on December 19,\n2012, all Class E felonies. The plea agreement provided that the trial court would determine\nthe length and manner of service of sentence.\n\n        A transcript of the guilty plea hearing was not included in the record on appeal.\nHowever, the presentence report, which was introduced at the sentencing hearing, reflects\nthat on January 12, 2011, members of the 17th Judicial District Drug Task Force and\ndetectives with the Lewisburg Police Department utilized the services of a confidential\ninformant (CI). The CI purchased $60 worth of marijuana from the appellant in the parking\nlot of an apartment building on Haynes Street in Lewisburg. After the transaction, the\nappellant returned to an apartment on the top left side of the building. The agents and\ndetectives watched the building for one or two hours and noticed several individuals arrive\nand leave from the appellant\u2019s apartment. One of the individuals, who was stopped by Agent\nBrad Martin, possessed a small bag of marijuana. Officer Tim Miller decided to approach\nthe apartment and perform a \u201cknock-and-talk.\u201d He walked up the stairs, looked through the\nblinds, and saw the appellant and a young female in the living room. When Officer Miller\nknocked on the closed door, he saw the female grab a Ziploc bag from the couch and run\ntoward the rear of the apartment. The bag appeared to contain a large amount of marijuana.\nThe appellant answered the door, and Officer Miller walked down the hall where the female\nhad gone. He noticed a light on in the bathroom off the hall. An empty Ziploc bag was lying\non the floor and approximately three ounces of marijuana was floating on the water inside\nthe toilet. The agents performed a consensual search of the appellant and found $450 of\nsuspected illegal drug proceeds, including $60 from the controlled buy. A subsequent\nconsensual search of the residence revealed two sets of digital scales in the master bedroom.\nThe appellant spoke with the agents and acknowledged ownership of the marijuana and\nscales.\n\n       The presentence report further reflects that on October 19, 2011, Agent Brad Martin\nand Officer Tim Miller met with a CI, who told them that the appellant and Whitney Green\nwere involved in the illegal distribution of cocaine. At approximately 7:04 p.m., the CI\ncalled Green and asked to buy $100 worth of crack cocaine. Around 7:21 p.m., Green sent\nthe CI a text message, instructing him to meet her at Kris\u2019s Store. The appellant and Green\narrived at the store in a red Ford Focus. The CI approached the car and had a \u201chand-to-hand\nexchange\u201d with the appellant. Afterward, the CI rendezvoused with the agents and\nrelinquished a small, white, plastic bag containing crack cocaine.\n\n      The presentence report also reflects that the appellant had two prior misdemeanor\nconvictions for failure to appear; three convictions of assault; eight convictions of selling\nmarijuana; four convictions of possessing marijuana; one conviction of disorderly conduct;\nand two convictions of possessing drug paraphernalia.\n\n                                             -2-\n\f       Renee Howell, a probation officer, testified that she prepared the appellant\u2019s\npresentence report. She stated that the appellant previously had probationary sentences\nrevoked on at least two occasions. She also stated that the appellant was on probation when\nhe committed the three failure to appear offenses; however, he was not on probation when\nhe committed the drug offenses.\n\n       On cross-examination, Howell said that when she spoke with the appellant, he\nindicated that he was trying to \u201cturn his life around as best as he can.\u201d He told her that he\nwas taking courses while he was incarcerated.\n\n        Regarding the conviction of possession of marijuana with the intent to sell, the parties\nagreed that the appellant was a Range II offender, that he was entitled to release eligibility\nafter service of thirty-five percent of his sentence, and that he was subject to a sentence\nbetween two to four years. The parties also agreed that the appellant was a Range I offender\non the crack cocaine conviction, that he was entitled to release eligibility after service of\nthirty percent of his sentence, and that he was subject to a sentence between eight to twelve\nyears. Finally, the parties agreed that the appellant was a Range III offender for his\nconvictions of failure to appear, that he was entitled to release eligibility after service of\nforty-five percent of his sentence, and that he was subject to a sentence between four to six\nyears.\n\n         To each conviction, the court applied enhancement factor (1), that the appellant has\na previous history of criminal convictions or criminal behavior, in addition to those necessary\nto establish the appropriate range. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-114(1). The court specifically\nnoted that it did not consider the felony offenses used to establish the appellant\u2019s sentencing\nrange but considered his multitude of misdemeanor offenses. The court also applied\nenhancement factor (8), that the appellant, before trial or sentencing, failed to comply with\nthe conditions of a sentence involving release into the community, to all of the convictions.\nId. at (8). The court noted that the appellant had previously violated probation on at least two\noccasions. Finally, the court applied enhancement factor (13)(C), that the appellant was on\nprobation at the time he committed the offenses, to the failure to appear convictions. The\ncourt applied mitigating factor (1), that the appellant\u2019s criminal conduct neither caused nor\nthreatened serious bodily injury, to all of the convictions. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-113(1).\nHowever, the court did not afford the factor \u201csignificant weight.\u201d After considering the\nenhancement and mitigating factors, the trial court sentenced the appellant to three years for\nthe marijuana conviction, ten years for the crack cocaine conviction, and five years for each\nof the three failure to appear convictions.\n\n       The court further found that consecutive sentencing was appropriate because the\nappellant is an offender whose record of criminal activity is extensive. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\n\n                                              -3-\n\f40-35-115(2). Additionally, the court found that consecutive sentencing was appropriate for\nthe failure to appear convictions because the appellant committed the offenses while on\nprobation. The court observed that the appellant was arguably a professional criminal, noting\nthat it did not \u201csee a lot of other alternative means of support other than illegal activities\u201d;\nhowever, the court declined to impose consecutive sentencing on this basis. Id. at (1). The\ncourt ordered two of the appellant\u2019s failure to appear sentences to be served concurrently\nwith each other but consecutively to the third failure to appear sentence. The court further\nordered the sentences for the drug offenses to be served concurrently with each other but\nconsecutively to the sentences for failure to appear, for a total effective sentence of twenty\nyears.\n\n       On appeal, the appellant challenges the length of the sentences imposed by the trial\ncourt and the imposition of consecutive sentencing.\n\n                                          II. Analysis\n\n        Initially, we note that the record does not contain a transcript of the appellant\u2019s guilty\nplea hearing. We have determined, however, that the record is adequate for appellate review\nof the sentence. See State v. Caudle, 388 S.W.3d 273, 279 (Tenn. 2012).\n\n        Our supreme court has held that \u201csentences imposed by the trial court within the\nappropriate statutory range are to be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard with a\n\u2018presumption of reasonableness.\u2019\u201d State v. Bise, 380 S.W.3d 682, 708 (Tenn. 2012). Our\nsupreme court has further explicitly stated that \u201cthe abuse of discretion standard,\naccompanied by a presumption of reasonableness, applies to within-range sentences that\nreflect a decision based upon the purposes and principles of sentencing, including the\nquestions related to probation or any other alternative sentence.\u201d Caudle, 388 S.W.3d at 278-\n79. Additionally, our supreme court has held \u201cthat the appropriate standard of appellate\nreview for consecutive sentencing is abuse of discretion accompanied by a presumption of\nreasonableness.\u201d State v. Pollard, 432 S.W.3d 851, 859 (Tenn. 2013).\n\n        In conducting its review, this court considers the following factors: (1) the evidence,\nif any, received at the trial and the sentencing hearing; (2) the presentence report; (3) the\nprinciples of sentencing and arguments as to sentencing alternatives; (4) the nature and\ncharacteristics of the criminal conduct involved; (5) evidence and information offered by the\nparties on enhancement and mitigating factors; (6) any statistical information provided by the\nadministrative office of the courts as to sentencing practices for similar offenses in\nTennessee; (7) any statement by the appellant in his own behalf; and (8) the potential for\nrehabilitation or treatment. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 40-35-102, -103, -210; see also Bise,\n380 S.W.3d at 697-98. The burden is on the appellant to demonstrate the impropriety of his\n\n                                               -4-\n\fsentence. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-401, Sentencing Comm\u2019n Cmts.\n\n      In determining a specific sentence within a range of punishment, the trial court should\nconsider, but is not bound by, the following advisory guidelines:\n\n                     (1) The minimum sentence within the range of\n              punishment is the sentence that should be imposed, because the\n              general assembly set the minimum length of sentence for each\n              felony class to reflect the relative seriousness of each criminal\n              offense in the felony classifications; and\n\n                     (2) The sentence length within the range should be\n              adjusted, as appropriate, by the presence or absence of\n              mitigating and enhancement factors set out in \u00a7\u00a7 40-35-113 and\n              40-35-114.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-210(c).\n\n        Although the trial court should consider enhancement and mitigating factors, the\nstatutory enhancement factors are advisory only. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-114; see also\nBise, 380 S.W.3d at 701; State v. Carter, 254 S.W.3d 335, 343 (Tenn. 2008). Our supreme\ncourt has stated that \u201ca trial court\u2019s weighing of various mitigating and enhancement factors\n[is] left to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d Carter, 254 S.W.3d at 345. In other words,\n\u201cthe trial court is free to select any sentence within the applicable range so long as the length\nof the sentence is \u2018consistent with the purposes and principles of [the Sentencing Act].\u2019\u201d Id.\nat 343. \u201c[A]ppellate courts are therefore left with a narrower set of circumstances in which\nthey might find that a trial court has abused its discretion in setting the length of a\ndefendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d Id. at 345-46. \u201c[They are] bound by a trial court\u2019s decision as to the\nlength of the sentence imposed so long as it is imposed in a manner consistent with the\npurposes and principles set out in sections -102 and -103 of the Sentencing Act.\u201d Id. at 346.\n\n        On appeal, the appellant acknowledges that the trial court correctly applied the\nenhancement factors, that the sentences imposed were within the appropriate statutory\nranges, and that \u201cthe current state of Tennessee sentencing law favors upholding such within-\nrange sentences.\u201d We agree. Nevertheless, the appellant implores this court to \u201creexamine\nits stance on this issue.\u201d He argues that the trial court should have attributed more weight\nto mitigating factor (1), contending that \u201c[f]undamental fairness should require that\nmitigating factors are exercised in the reduction of sentences to the same degree that\nenhancement factors are exercised in the increase of sentences.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\f       This court has repeatedly held that a \u201c\u2018sentence is not determined by the mathematical\nprocess of adding the sum total of enhancing factors present then subtracting from this figure\nthe mitigating factors present for a net number of years.\u2019\u201d State v. Alder, 71 S.W.3d 299,\n306 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2001) (quoting State v. Boggs, 932 S.W.2d 467, 474 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. 1996)). Therefore, we conclude that \u201c[t]he court did not err by refusing to\nmathematically offset the enhancing factors against the mitigators it found.\u201d State v. Paul\nAllen St. Clair, No. M2012-00578-CCA-R3-CD, 2013 WL 1611206, at *3 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. at Nashville, Apr. 16, 2013), perm. to appeal denied, (Tenn. 2013). Regardless, the\nweighing of mitigating and enhancing factors is left to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion.\nCarter, 254 S.W.3d at 345. Furthermore, we note that the 2005 amendments to the 1989\nSentencing Act \u201cdeleted as grounds for appeal a claim that the trial court did not weigh\nproperly the enhancement and mitigating factors.\u201d Id. at 344. Accordingly, the appellant is\nnot entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n        Finally, the appellant argues that the trial court erred by imposing consecutive\nsentencing. Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-115(b) contains the discretionary\ncriteria for imposing consecutive sentencing. See also State v. Wilkerson, 905 S.W.2d 933,\n936 (Tenn. 1995). Because the criteria for determining consecutive sentencing \u201care stated\nin the alternative[,] . . . only one need exist to support the appropriateness of consecutive\nsentencing.\u201d State v. Mickens, 123 S.W.3d 355, 394 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2003). In the instant\ncase, the trial court found that the appellant was an offender whose record of criminal activity\nwas extensive and that the appellant was sentenced for an offense committed while on\nprobation. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-115(b)(2), (6).\n\n        The appellant acknowledges that the trial court followed the applicable law and that,\non appeal, its ruling is subject to review by this court for an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless,\nthe appellant asks this court to \u201creevaluate\u201d the issue of consecutive sentencing. The\nappellant contends that based on the nonviolent nature of the appellant\u2019s offenses, a fifteen-\nyear sentence is more appropriate. We decline the appellant\u2019s request and conclude that the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion by imposing consecutive sentencing.\n\n                                       III. Conclusion\n\n      In sum, we conclude that the trial court did not err in sentencing the appellant.\nTherefore, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n\n\n                                                     _________________________________\n                                                     NORMA McGEE OGLE, JUDGE\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f",
