He maintained that the district court improperly\ninstructed the jury that he could be convicted if criminal\nsexual activity was a motivating purpose of the transportation\nof an individual, and that the district court was required to\ninstruct the jury that criminal sexual activity must be the\ndominant purpose in order to establish the requisite intent.\n\n    The panel held that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in instructing the jury, consistent with this court\u2019s\nprecedent, that the government was required to prove beyond\na reasonable doubt that a dominant, significant, or motivating\npurpose of the transportation of the defendant\u2019s victims was\nto engage in criminal sexual activity. The panel wrote that\nthe non-retroactive amendment to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b), a\nstatute under which the defendant was not charged, does not\nundermine the consistent precedent throughout the circuits\n\n    *\n      This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.

He wrote that the\ninstruction lowered the government\u2019s burden of proof,\ncontrary to the holding in Mortensen v.

The issue that confronts us\nin this appeal is whether the district court properly instructed\nthe jury that it could convict Flucas if a motivating purpose\nof his transportation of his victims from Oregon to California\nwas to engage in criminal sexual activity. Flucas maintains\nthat the district court was required to instruct the jury that the\ngovernment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the\ndominant purpose of his transportation of his sexual abuse\nvictims was to engage in criminal sexual activity. Flucas\nasserts that he was entitled to this instruction in support of his\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                           5\n\ntheory of defense that the dominant purpose of his\ntransportation of his victims from Oregon to California was\nto obtain a higher paying job, not to engage in criminal sexual\nactivity.\n\n    We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and\nwe affirm Flucas\u2019 convictions. We hold that the district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury, consistent\nwith our precedent, that the government was required to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that a dominant, significant,\nor motivating purpose of the transportation of Flucas\u2019 victims\nwas to engage in criminal sexual activity.1\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n    In a third superseding indictment, Flucas was charged\nwith \u201cknowingly transport[ing] in interstate commerce and\nforeign commerce individuals Person 1, Person 2, and Person\n3, each of whom had not attained the age of 18 years, with\nintent that each such individual engage in sexual activity for\nwhich any person could be charged with a criminal offense\u201d\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a). The indictment alleged\nthat Flucas engaged in incest, sexual intercourse, and oral\ncopulation with Person 1, Person 2, and Person 3 in violation\nof California law. Flucas was also charged under 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2421(a) with \u201cknowingly transport[ing] in interstate\ncommerce and foreign commerce an individual, Person 4,\nwith intent that such individual engage in sexual activity for\n\n\n\n\n    1\n      In a memorandum disposition filed concurrently with this opinion,\nwe address Flucas\u2019 additional challenges to his convictions.\n\f6                   UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nwhich any person could be charged with a criminal offense,\nto wit: incest in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 285.\u201d2\n\n    During Flucas\u2019 second trial,3 Person 1 testified that, in\n2014, she met Person 2, Flucas\u2019 daughter, in Oregon, and\nstarted living at Flucas\u2019 residence. Person 1 stated that Flucas\nwas the father of her son, who was born in Stockton,\nCalifornia, when Person 1 was sixteen years old. Person 1\nrelated that Flucas started to \u201ctouch [her] in a sexual manner\u201d\nwhen she was fifteen years old, and had intercourse with her\nbetween one and three times a week. Flucas instructed\nPerson 1 not to tell anyone about the sex acts, and to fabricate\na name for the father of her child.\n\n    Flucas told Person 1 that he wanted her to move with him\nto California in 2015 because she \u201cwas having his child.\u201d\nFlucas threatened Person 1, that if she attempted to stay in\nOregon with her father or stepmother, he would \u201cbring [her]\nback\u201d to him. Person 1 did not believe that she \u201chad a choice\nabout moving\u201d to California. Person 1 testified that Flucas\ncontinued to have intercourse \u201c[a] few times a week\u201d with her\nin California. Person 1 did not believe that she \u201ccould stop\nwhat was happening to [her].\u201d\n\n   Person 2, Flucas\u2019 daughter, testified that Flucas started to\nhave intercourse with her when she was thirteen years old.\nPerson 2 became pregnant with Flucas\u2019 child in 2013, when\n\n\n    2\n      A third count alleging that Flucas transported Person 2 and Person\n3 with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, was dismissed.\n    3\n      In Flucas\u2019 first trial, the jury convicted Flucas of attempted witness\ntampering, but was unable to reach a verdict on the transportation\noffenses.\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                      7\n\nshe was fifteen years old, but lost the child. During an\ninvestigation by child protective services, Person 2 did not\ndisclose the sexual abuse or that Flucas was the father of her\nchild. Prior to her interview, Flucas warned Person 2 that she\nknew \u201cwhat and what not to say.\u201d\n\n    Person 2 testified that she moved with Flucas to Klamath\nFalls, Oregon, when she was fifteen years old, after he lost his\njob in Americus, Georgia, due to allegations by \u201cher little\nsisters\u2019 and brothers\u2019 grandmother\u201d of sexual abuse. They\nrelocated to Oregon because Flucas was \u201ctrying to move\naway from . . . the people who were [making] the\nallegations.\u201d Person 2 related that Flucas continued to\nsexually abuse her in Oregon.\n\n    In 2017, Person 2 realized that she was unable to protect\nher sisters, and decided that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to live\nanymore.\u201d Person 2 attempted to commit suicide by crashing\nher car into a pole. At the hospital, Person 2 informed law\nenforcement about the sexual abuse.\n\n    Person 3, Flucas\u2019 daughter, testified that Flucas started to\nsexually abuse her when she was six years old, and had\nintercourse with her for the first time when she was thirteen\nyears old. Flucas promised that he would purchase a cell\nphone, computer, and car if she had intercourse with him.\nPerson 3 confirmed that Flucas continued to have intercourse\nwith her after moving to Oregon and California.\n\n    Person 3 related that in 2017 she attempted to commit\nsuicide with \u201ca bunch of [Flucas\u2019] narcotics\u201d because she\n\u201cdidn\u2019t want to be [in his house] anymore.\u201d Person 3 testified\nthat she slept for most of the day until Flucas returned home.\nPerson 3 stated that, when Flucas returned, he took her into\n\f8                UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\na closet in his bedroom, where she vomited and they \u201chad\nsex.\u201d When Person 3 was interviewed by child protective\nservices, Flucas told her to deny any sexual abuse.\n\n    Person 4, Flucas\u2019 daughter, testified that Flucas was the\nfather of her three children. Person 4 related that, in August,\n2008, she was living with Flucas in Valdosta, Georgia. In\nFebruary, 2010, Flucas started to touch Person 4 \u201cin a sexual\nmanner,\u201d when she was in the ninth grade. Person 4 testified\nthat she was fifteen when Flucas began having intercourse\nwith her. Person 4 related that she was \u201cconfused,\u201d and\nbecame physically attracted to her father because he \u201cmade\n[her] believe that [she] was the only one he wanted and . . . he\ncould take care of [her] and [her] kids.\u201d Person 4 told her\nsisters about the sexual abuse, but Flucas convinced them that\nshe was lying. Person 4 subsequently \u201ccovered up\u201d her story\nat Flucas\u2019 insistence. Flucas also told Person 4 that he had\n\u201crecordings in the phones and cameras in the rooms to see\nwhat you all are doing,\u201d and commanded that \u201c[w]hat\nhappens in this house stays in this house.\u201d\n\n    When Person 4 gave birth to her first child, Flucas told\nher to fabricate the name of a father. Flucas also instructed\nher not to provide the name of a father on the child\u2019s birth\ncertificate. According to Person 4, Flucas told her that he\nwanted to have \u201cseven more kids\u201d with her, and was angry\nwhen she attempted to use birth control.\n\n    In April, 2014, Person 4 was interviewed by the Georgia\nDepartment of Family and Children\u2019s Services. Person 4 lied\nto the investigators when she told them that Flucas did not\nsexually abuse her. Person 4 related that she subsequently\nmoved with Flucas and other members of his household to\nAmericus, Georgia, where they resided for approximately one\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                    9\n\nmonth. Person 4 testified that it was Flucas\u2019 idea to move to\nAmericus, and that he continued to have intercourse with her.\n\n    Flucas was eventually fired from his job in Americus,\nGeorgia, when his employer was informed about sexual abuse\nallegations. Flucas, Person 4, Person 4\u2019s two children, Person\n3, Person 2, and other members of the household\nsubsequently moved to Klamath Falls, Oregon, in September,\n2014. Person 4 testified that Flucas would not allow her to\ncontact her mother to inform her where she was residing.\nWhile in Oregon, Person 4 became pregnant with her third\nchild.\n\n    Person 4 related that, in August, 2015, Flucas decided to\nmove to Stockton, California. Flucas prohibited Person 4\nfrom contacting her mother. Flucas continued to have\nintercourse with Person 4 in California. Flucas also told her\nthat, if she ever married, she \u201cstill [had to] have sex with\nhim.\u201d\n\n    Person 4 related that, after Person 2 was involved in an\naccident, Flucas threatened Person 4 that, \u201cIf I go down you\ngo down. For every child you have, there\u2019s like a three-year\nsentence.\u201d Person 4 was interviewed by a detective after\nPerson 2\u2019s accident, and was confronted with DNA results\nindicating that Flucas was the father of her children. As\ndirected by Flucas, Person 4 told the detective that she\n\u201cinseminated [herself] with a syringe\u201d with semen from his\ncondoms.\n\n   Person 4 testified that Flucas had intercourse with her on\nOctober 28, 2017, at a hotel in California. According to\nPerson 4, Flucas told her that they could move to Switzerland,\nRhode Island, or New Jersey, where incest was legal.\n\f10                  UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\n    Person 5 testified that her mother was in a relationship\nwith Flucas, and that Flucas sexually abused Person 5 when\nshe was eight years old. Flucas had intercourse with Person\n5 for the first time when she was thirteen years old. Flucas\ntold Person 5 that she was \u201chis soulmate,\u201d and that, \u201cif [she]\ncheated on him, he\u2019d kill [her].\u201d Person 5 explained that she\nwas unable to tell anyone about the sexual abuse because she\ndidn\u2019t think she would be believed. Person 5 eventually\nthought she was \u201cin love\u201d with Flucas.\n\n    Person 5 testified that Flucas was the father of her six\nchildren. Flucas instructed Person 5 to fabricate the name of\na father for the children. Flucas also told Person 5 that he\nwanted to have between eight and ten children with her.\n\n    Person 5 moved with Flucas to Oregon in March, 2015,\nwhen she was \u201ceight or nine months pregnant.\u201d Person 5\ntestified that Flucas continued to have intercourse with her in\nOregon. When they subsequently moved to Stockton,\nCalifornia, Flucas prohibited Person 5 from informing her\nmother. Flucas continued to have intercourse with Person 5\nin California, and Person 5 became pregnant.\n\n    When Person 5 was interviewed by a detective, she was\npresented with DNA results indicating that Flucas was the\nfather of her children. Person 5 told the detective that she\ninseminated herself with Flucas\u2019 sperm because \u201cthat\u2019s the\nstory that Mr. Flucas told [her] to say.\u201d4\n\n\n     4\n      The dissent characterizes the evidence of Flucas\u2019 guilty as \u201cflimsy.\u201d\nDissenting Opinion, p. 66. The dissent bases this characterization on\nFlucas\u2019 testimony that he moved to California for a better paying job. See\nid. at 66. But this characterization does not acknowledge powerful\ntestimony from the victims detailing Flucas\u2019 controlling behavior, his\n\f                    UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                            11\n\n    Flucas testified that he had intercourse with Person 4, his\ndaughter, and acknowledged that sexual abuse occurred while\nresiding in Georgia. However, Flucas maintained that he\nmoved to California to seek a better paying job. Flucas\u2019\ndefense was that he moved for financial reasons, not to\ntransport his daughters and the other minors for criminal\nsexual activity.\n\n    At trial, the government proposed the following\ninstruction with respect to the intent requirements for a\nconviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423:\n\n         To find the defendant guilty of Count One\n         and/or Count Two, you need not find that the\n         intended criminal sexual activity was the\n         defendant\u2019s sole or most important purpose.\n         It is sufficient if the government proves\n         beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual\n         activity was a significant, dominant, or\n         motivating purpose. In other words, the\n         government must prove that the criminal\n         sexual activity was not merely incidental to\n         the transportation. A person may have more\n         than one significant, dominant, or motivating\n         purpose for transporting others across a state\n         line.\n\nThe government proposed the instruction because the jury in\nFlucas\u2019 first trial \u201cstruggled with the intent instruction and\nasked for further clarifying instructions,\u201d and the proffered\n\n\n\ntravels from other states where he was under investigation, and his refusal\nto allow his victims to notify their relatives that they had moved.\n\f12                   UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\ninstruction \u201cadded clarity about the nature of the intent\ninstruction.\u201d5\n\n    Flucas objected to the proposed instruction because \u201cit\n[was] not sufficient for the government to prove that illegal\nsexual activity was a motivating purpose,\u201d and proposed an\nalternative instruction:\n\n         It is not necessary for the government to prove\n         that the (prostitution or) illegal sexual activity\n         was the sole purpose for any transportation\n         from one state to another. A person may have\n         several different purposes or motives for such\n         travel and each may prompt in varying\n         degrees the act of making the journey. The\n         government must prove beyond a reasonable\n         doubt, however, that a significant or dominant\n         purpose of the travel from one state to another\n         was to have the person(s) transported engage\n         in (prostitution or) illegal sexual activity.\n\n         The Government must prove that the criminal\n         sexual activity was not merely incidental to\n         the transportation.\n\n    The district court determined that use of the term\n\u201cmotivating\u201d was consistent with legal precedent, and\ninstructed the jury that:\n\n\n\n     5\n      During Flucas\u2019 first trial, the jury asked the district court to \u201cclarify\nthe court\u2019s definition of intent, beyond the instructions given.\u201d\n\f                   UNITED STATES V.

To find\n         Mr. Flucas guilty of Counts 1 and/or 2, the\n         government must prove that Mr. Flucas\n         intended Person 1, 2, 3 and/or 4 to engage in\n         criminal sexual activity after transporting\n         them from one state to another state, not that\n         anyone actually engaged in such conduct.6\n\n\n\n\n    6\n      The dissent\u2019s speculative assertion that \u201cwe must assume that [the\njury] chose the common denominator \u2013 \u2018motivating\u2019 \u2013 because satisfying\nthat standard would automatically satisfy the higher standards of\n\u2018dominant\u2019 and \u2018significant\u2019\u201d is accompanied by no supporting authority.\nDissenting Opinion, p. 65.\n\f14                  UNITED STATES V.

DISCUSSION\n\n    Flucas contends that he is entitled to a new trial because\nthe district court erroneously instructed the jury concerning\nthe requisite intent for transporting an individual or minor for\ncriminal sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421 and\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423. Flucas maintains that the district court\nimproperly instructed the jury that Flucas could be convicted\nif criminal sexual activity was a motivating purpose of the\ntransportation of an individual, and that the district court was\nrequired to instruct the jury that criminal sexual activity must\nbe the dominant purpose in order to establish the requisite\nintent.\n\n\n\n\n       7\n       Because Flucas filed his notice of appeal on February 15, 2019,\n\u201cafter the . . . announce[ment of] a . . . sentence\u201d on February 12, 2019,\nbut \u201cbefore the entry of the judgment\u201d on February 25, 2019, his appeal\nis \u201ctreated as filed on the date of and after the entry [of the judgment].\u201d\nFed. R. App. P. 4(b)(2).\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                     15\n\n    In interpreting the elements for transportation and travel\noffenses, we have consistently held that a dominant,\nsignificant, or motivating purpose to engage in criminal\nsexual activity satisfies the intent requirement. In United\nStates v. Kinslow, 860 F.2d 963 (9th Cir. 1988), disapproved\nof on other grounds by United States v. Brackeen, 969 F.2d\n827, 829 (9th Cir. 1992) (en banc) (per curiam), we affirmed\nthe defendant\u2019s conviction for \u201cinterstate transportation of a\nminor for sexual purposes in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423.\u201d\nId. at 964, 970. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s assertion that\n\u201cthe evidence was legally insufficient to support his\nconviction . . . because sexual misconduct was not a dominant\npurpose in the transportation of [the minor] across state\nlines,\u201d we responded that \u201c[i]n this circuit, a federal crime\nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423 exists if the immoral activity is one\nof the dominant purposes of the transportation.\u201d Id. at 967\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We further\nemphasized that it was \u201cnot necessary . . . that the immoral\nactivity be the only purpose of the trip.\u201d Id. Instead, we\nconcluded that:\n\n       [The defendant] asserts that his only purpose\n       in taking [the minor] across state lines was to\n       insure his own safe passage from Arizona to\n       California. While this may have been one of\n       his goals, the jury was entitled to find that [the\n       defendant] also intended to assert sexual\n       control over the females in the . . . family and\n       that this was one of the reasons he took them\n       all into California. . . . A rational trier of fact\n       could have found that one of the dominant\n\f16                     UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\n            purposes in transporting [the minor] across\n            state lines was to have her available to him for\n            immoral, sexual purposes.\n\nId. at 967\u201398.\n\n    In United States v. Lukashov, 694 F.3d 1107, 1110 (9th\nCir. 2012), we considered the defendant\u2019s challenge to his\nconviction for aggravated sexual abuse in violation of\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c).8 The defendant maintained that the\nevidence supporting his conviction was insufficient because\n\u201chis purpose in traveling to New York and back to Oregon\nwas to pick up and deliver goods in his capacity as a\nlong-haul truck driver.\u201d Id. at 1118. The district court\ninstructed the jury that:\n\n            The government need not prove that the\n            Defendant traveled across a state line for the\n            sole and exclusive purpose of engaging in a\n            sexual act. A person may have different\n            purposes or motives for travel and each may\n\n     8\n         18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) provides in pertinent part:\n\n            Whoever crosses a State line with intent to engage in a\n            sexual act with a person who has not attained the age of\n            12 years, . . . knowingly engages in a sexual act with\n            another person who has not attained the age of 12 years,\n            or knowingly engages in a sexual act under the\n            circumstances described in subsections (a) [by force or\n            threat] and (b) [by other means in a federal enclave]\n            with another person who has attained the age of 12\n            years but has not attained the age of 16 years (and is at\n            least 4 years younger than the person so engaging), or\n            attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title and\n            imprisoned for not less than 30 years or for life.\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                    17\n\n       prompt in varying degrees the act of making\n       the journey. For purposes of this element, the\n       government must prove beyond a reasonable\n       doubt that a dominant, significant, or\n       motivating purpose of Defendant\u2019s travel\n       across a state line was to engage in a sexual\n       act with [the minor]. In other words, the\n       government must prove the sexual act was not\n       merely incidental to the travel.\n\nId. (alteration omitted) (emphasis added). Unpersuaded by\nthe defendant\u2019s assertion that criminal sexual activity must be\nthe sole purpose for his travels, we held that:\n\n       A rational jury could have found beyond a\n       reasonable doubt that once [the defendant]\n       formed the intent to sexually abuse [the\n       minor], whether that occurred before he\n       started the trip or only after he dropped off\n       [another minor] in Montana and was alone in\n       his truck with [his victim], he had that illicit\n       intent for the rest of the trip, until he returned\n       her to her mother in Portland. Given the\n       repeated instances of abuse after the first time\n       in Montana, a jury could rationally infer that\n       [the defendant] crossed the Montana\u2013North\n       Dakota and subsequent state lines with a\n       dominant, significant, or motivating purpose\n       of committing additional sexual acts. That\n       [the defendant] also had a commercial\n       purpose for crossing state lines does not\n       negate the inference that he had a significant\n       or motivating purpose to continue abusing\n       [the minor] because, as the district court\n\f18               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\n       correctly instructed the jury, the government\n       did not have to prove that sexually abusing\n       [the minor] was the sole purpose of [the\n       defendant\u2019s] interstate travel. . . .\n\nId. at 1118\u201319 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)\n(emphases added).\n\n    In reaching this conclusion, we relied on the Tenth\nCircuit\u2019s decision in United States v. Cryar, 232 F.3d 1318\n(10th Cir. 2000). See id. at 1119. In Cryar, the defendant\nasserted that there was insufficient evidence supporting his\nconviction for \u201ccross[ing] the state line between Texas and\nOklahoma with the intent to engage in a sexual act with a\nsix-year old girl in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c).\u201d\n232 F.3d at 1319. The defendant specifically argued that \u201cthe\ndominant purpose of his crossing the state line . . . was to\nearn a living, and not to commit a sexual act.\u201d Id. at 1324.\nThe Tenth Circuit disagreed, concluding that \u201cthere was\nample evidence for a jury to determine that a motivating or\ndominant purpose of [the defendant\u2019s] travels to Oklahoma\nwas to spend time with and attempt to engage in sexual acts\nwith a child under twelve years old.\u201d Id. (citation omitted)\n(emphasis added).\n\n    In United States v. Lindsay, 931 F.3d 852, 864 (9th Cir.\n2019), we applied Lukashov and rejected a challenge to a jury\ninstruction delineating the intent requirements for a\nconviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423. In that case, the district\ncourt instructed the jury that:\n\n       the United States does not have to prove that\n       Defendant traveled in foreign commerce for\n       the sole and exclusive purpose of engaging in\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                     19\n\n       illicit sexual conduct. The government must\n       prove that a dominant, significant, or\n       motivating purpose of Defendant\u2019s travel in\n       foreign commerce was to engage in illicit\n       sexual conduct.\n\nId. at 858 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis\nadded). In addressing the defendant\u2019s assertion that the\nstatutory term \u201c\u2018for the purpose of\u2019 clearly refers to a but-for\ncausation standard, contrary to the \u2018dominant, significant, or\nmotivating\u2019 standard the district court applied,\u201d we clarified\nthat:\n\n       It is not obviously wrong to interpret \u201cfor the\n       purpose of\u201d as applying to any dominant,\n       significant, or motivating purpose to account\n       for that fact, as a plain understanding of the\n       phrase can encompass multiple intentions.\n       For instance, in common conversation a\n       person can travel to the grocery store \u201cfor the\n       purpose of\u201d buying milk and getting gas if\n       both milk and gas are motivating reasons for\n       the excursion.\n\nId. at 864 (emphasis added). In light of consistent precedent\nthat a motivating purpose to engage in illicit sexual activity\nmay support the intent requirements for transportation and\ntravel offenses, we held that \u201cthe district court did\n\nnot plainly err by instructing the jury that [the defendant]\ntraveled in foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in\nillicit sexual activity if that purpose was dominant,\nsignificant, or motivating.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Although\nwe applied plain error review in rejecting the defendant\u2019s\n\f20               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nchallenge to the jury instruction, we nonetheless adhered to\nthe principles articulated in Lukashov that the defendant\u2019s\ncontention \u201cignore[d] the human ability and propensity to act\nin light of multiple motives and purposes.\u201d Id. at 864, quoting\nLukashov, 694 F.3d at 1118.\n\n    The dissent minimizes the import of Lindsay because it\nwas decided on plain error review. See Dissenting Opinion,\npp. 55\u201356. Although \u201c[a]n error cannot be plain where there\nis no controlling authority on point and where the most\nclosely analogous precedent leads to conflicting results,\u201d\nUnited States v. Gnirke, 775 F.3d 1155, 1164 (9th Cir. 2015)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted), that was not\nthe standard applied in Lindsay. Rather, we considered\nLukashov and concluded that it was not error to instruct the\njury regarding the defendant\u2019s \u201cmotivating purpose.\u201d\n931 F.3d at 864. Notably absent was any mention of the lack\nof \u201ccontrolling authority\u201d or conflicting precedent. Gnirke,\n775 F.3d at 1164. In any event, in order for plain error to\nexist, there must first be error. See United States v. Johnson,\n979 F.3d 632, 636 (9th Cir. 2020), as amended. In Lindsay,\nwe found none. See Lindsay, 931 F.3d at 864.\n\n    The dissent\u2019s conclusion that there was no plain error in\nLindsay \u201c[g]iven the confusion in the courts,\u201d rests upon a\nproposition which we never mentioned or relied on.\nDissenting Opinion, pp. 55\u201356. Rather, our holding that the\ndistrict court did not err in instructing the jury that a\ndominant, significant, or motivating purpose suffices to\nestablish the requisite intent is bolstered by a long line of\nconsistent and uniform cases from our sister circuits.\n\n    In United States v. Hayward, 359 F.3d 631 (3d Cir. 2004),\nthe defendant asserted that \u201cthe District Court should have\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                     21\n\ninstructed the jury that criminal sexual activity had to be \u2018the\ndominant\u2019-rather than \u2018a significant or motivating\u2019-purpose\nof the trip to England in order to convict.\u201d Id. at 637\n(emphases in the original). Instead, the district court\ninstructed the jury that:\n\n       It is not necessary for the government to prove\n       that the illegal sexual activity was the sole\n       purpose for the transportation. A person may\n       have several different purposes or motives for\n       such travel, and each may prompt in varying\n       degrees the act of making the journey. The\n       government must prove beyond a reasonable\n       doubt, however, that a significant or\n       motivating purpose of the travel across state\n       or foreign boundaries was to have the\n       individual transported engage in illegal\n       sexual activity. In other words, the illegal\n       sexual activity must have not been merely\n       incidental to the trip.\n\nId. (emphasis in the original). In approving the district\ncourt\u2019s instruction, the Third Circuit observed that:\n\n       [The defendant] points to no case in which\n       any Court of Appeals required a jury\n       instruction that criminal sexual activity must\n       be the dominant purpose of interstate travel to\n       support a conviction under 18 U.S.C.\n       \u00a7 2423(a). The Government relies on\n       decisions by the First, Second, Fifth, Sixth,\n       Seventh and Tenth Circuits, in which criminal\n       sexual activity was one of a number of\n       multiple motives for interstate travel. Those\n\f22               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\n       courts declined to reverse convictions where\n       the respective district court had refused or\n       failed to give \u201cthe dominant purpose\u201d jury\n       instruction that [the defendant] now requests.\n\nId. at 638 (citations omitted) (emphasis in the original).\n\n    In United States v. Campbell, 49 F.3d 1079 (5th Cir.\n1995), the Fifth Circuit similarly analyzed the intent\nrequirements for 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423. See\nid. at 1082. The defendant asserted that \u201cthe evidence was\ninsufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find that his\ndominant purpose in traveling was to engage in prostitution.\u201d\nId. (internal quotation marks omitted). The defendant\n\u201cquestion[ed] whether a dominant purpose can exist under the\nMann Act when an equally compelling but innocent purpose\nfor traveling exists,\u201d and asserted that the prostitute\u2019s \u201cvisit\nwas motivated at least equally by the desire to visit her\nchild.\u201d Id. at 1083 (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nFifth Circuit rejected \u201cthis line of arithmetic hairsplitting,\u201d\nbecause \u201c[t]he dominant requirement does not impose a but\nfor limitation on the defendant\u2019s intent.\u201d Id. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Fifth Circuit explained that:\n\n       In determining whether a dominant purpose\n       exists, we instead ask whether the illicit\n       behavior is one of the efficient and\n       compelling purposes of the travel.\n       Accordingly, many purposes for traveling\n       may exist, but, as long as one motivating\n       purpose is to engage in prostitution, criminal\n       liability may be imposed under the Act. When\n       no dominant purpose exists, it is because any\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                      23\n\n        such purpose was either non-existent or\n        incidental.\n\nId. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis\nadded). The Fifth Circuit concluded that \u201c[w]hile it is true\nthat [the prostitute] did have a child in the area, and they\ncould have been traveling in order to visit the child, this fact\nis not inconsistent with the prostitution plan. A reasonable\njury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the group was\ntraveling to New Mexico to visit [the prostitute\u2019s] daughter\nand engage in prostitution.\u201d Id. (emphasis in the original);\nsee also United States v. Hitt, 473 F.3d 146, 152 (5th Cir.\n2006) (holding that evidence that the defendants \u201cengage[d]\nin a grooming process designed to reduce [the victim\u2019s]\nresistance to sexual advances\u201d was sufficient to demonstrate\nthat the defendants \u201ctransported the victim to Louisiana with\nan efficient and compelling purpose to engage in illicit sexual\nactivity\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    In United States v. Vang, 128 F.3d 1065 (7th Cir. 1997),\nthe Seventh Circuit, in affirming a conviction under\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b), explained that the evolving intent\nstandard for transportation and travel offenses originated with\nthe Mann Act. The Seventh Circuit observed that \u201c[t]hough\nenacted in 1994, the statutory antecedents of \u00a7 2423(b) date\nback to the early part of this century.\u201d Id. at 1069. \u201cCongress\nmade the statute gender-neutral in a 1986 amendment, retired\nthe purpose test for interstate transportation, and clarified the\namorphous phrase any immoral purpose by narrowing the\nstatute\u2019s coverage to illegal sexual activity.\u201d Id. (footnote\nreference and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSection\n2423 evolved from this same legislative initiative as an effort\nto protect minors from predatory sexual conduct by adults,\u201d\nand \u201c[i]n 1994, Congress created \u00a7 2423(b) in a further\n\f24               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nattempt to expand the protection of minors. The new statute\npunishes mere travel in interstate commerce\u2014even if no\ntransportation of a minor was involved\u2014if the defendant is\nfound to have traveled for the purpose of engaging in any\nsexual act (as defined in another Code section) with a minor.\u201d\nId.\n\n    The Seventh Circuit concluded that the Supreme Court\u2019s\nstatement in Mortensen v. United States, 322 U.S. 369 (1944)\nthat, under the Mann Act, illicit sexual activity \u201cmust be the\ndominant motive of such interstate movement\u201d was dicta. Id.\nat 1071 (emphasis in the original). The Seventh Circuit\nobserved that \u201cmany circuits have upheld jury instructions\nand convictions where an immoral purpose was at least one\nof the purposes motivating the interstate transportation.\u201d Id.\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis\nadded). \u201cOther courts have used a dominant purpose\nstandard, but have regarded dominant as synonymous with\ncompelling or motivating, and they have never held\u2014as\nDefendants urge here\u2014that interstate travel can have only\none dominant purpose.\u201d Id. (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In approving the jury instruction provided by\nthe district court, the Seventh Circuit held that:\n\n       the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury\n       interpreting \u00a7 2423(b)\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d element\n       properly reflect this circuit\u2019s law. At the most\n       fundamental level, the defendants fail to\n       convince us that Mortensen\u2019s use of the word\n       \u201cdominant\u201d grafted a new requirement onto\n       the Mann Act that an immoral purpose must\n       be \u201cthe dominant purpose\u201d of interstate travel.\n       Congress has not used the word \u201cdominant\u201d in\n       either the Mann Act or \u00a7 2423(b), and we are\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                    25\n\n       not prepared to read such a requirement into\n       the statutes. . . . Courts . . . have consistently\n       used the word \u201cdominant\u201d to mean merely\n       \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201ccompelling\u201d or \u201cefficient\u201d;\n       there has never been any implied requirement\n       of preeminence of purpose. We are simply not\n       willing to break ranks with our sister circuits\n       on this matter for the sake of semantic purity.\n\nId. at 1072.\n\n    In United States v. Perkins, 948 F.3d 936 (8th Cir. 2020),\nthe Eighth Circuit recently considered the intent requirements\nfor 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a) in discerning the mens rea for\nviolations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c). See id. at 937. The Eighth\nCircuit explained that:\n\n       The intent element of \u00a7 2241(c) is an issue of\n       first impression for the Eighth Circuit. We\n       have, however, addressed the intent element\n       in cases involving the interstate transportation\n       of a minor for the purpose of engaging in\n       illegal sexual activity under 18 U.S.C.\n       \u00a7 2423(a). To prove the intent element under\n       \u00a7 2423(a), the illicit behavior must be one of\n       the purposes motivating the interstate\n       transportation, but need not be the dominant\n       purpose, and the sexual activity just may not\n       be merely incidental to the trip. The Eighth\n       Circuit has also held intent for \u00a7 2423(a) may\n       be inferred from all the circumstances,\n       including the defendant\u2019s own statements.\n\f26               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nId. at 938\u201339 (citations, alteration, and internal quotation\nmarks omitted) (emphasis added).\n\n    Thus, a common analytical thread runs through our\nprecedent and that of other circuits for transportation\noffenses\u2014the requisite intent may be established when the\ndefendant has a dominant, significant, or motivating purpose\nfor transporting an individual in order to engage in criminal\nsexual activity.\n\n    The dissent basically advocates straying from this\nprecedential harmony to hold that the district court committed\ninstructional error as a matter of law. In its analytical\njourney, the dissent initially relies on Hansen v. Haff,\n291 U.S. 559, 562\u201363 (1934), a pre-World War II case, for\nthe proposition that \u201c[p]eople not of good moral character,\nlike others, travel from place to place and change their\nresidence. But to say that, because they indulge in illegal or\nimmoral acts, they travel for that purpose, is to emphasize\nthat which is incidental and ignore what is of primary\nsignificance.\u201d Dissenting Opinion, p. 40. The dissent\u2019s\nreliance on this general language from Hansen does nothing\nto diffuse the contemporary, consistent precedent underlying\nthe district court\u2019s proper instruction.\n\n    The dissent next lands on Mortensen v. United States,\n322 U.S. 369 (1944), Cleveland v. United States, 329 U.S. 14\n(1946), Hawkins v. United States, 358 U.S. 74 (1958), and\nDaigle v. United States, 181 F.2d 311 (1st Cir. 1950) in\nsupport of its contention that the defendant\u2019s intent to illicit\nsex acts not be \u201ca mere incident but rather an efficient\npurpose prompting and impelling the defendants to the\ntransportation of the girls.\u201d Dissenting Opinion, pp. 42\u201343,\n45\u201346. Our precedent and that of other circuits is consistent\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                      27\n\nwith this proposition, and also consistent with the instruction\ngiven by the district court that the criminal sexual activity\ncould not be the \u201cincidental purpose\u201d of the defendant\u2019s\ntravel or transportation for criminal sexual activity as distinct\nfrom the travel. See Lukashov, 694 F.3d at 1118\u201319; Lindsay,\n931 F.3d at 864; Hayward, 359 F.3d at 637; Campbell,\n49 F.3d 1083; Perkins, 948 F.3d at 938\u201339.\n\n    Importantly, in United States v. Ellis, 935 F.2d 385 (1st\nCir. 1991), the First Circuit took great pains to explain the\nconsistency among the holdings in Daigle, Mortensen, and\nHawkins, and the motivating purpose jury instruction:\n\n        [The defendant] contends the court erred in\n        rejecting his proffered alternative charge that\n        the dominant purpose of the transportation\n        must be the intent to engage in sexual activity\n        with the minor. [The defendant] points to the\n        Supreme Court\u2019s holding in [Mortensen],\n        construing an earlier Mann Act provision that\n        preceded the present 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421. . . .\n\n        Seven years after Mortensen, [in Daigle] this\n        Circuit reviewed a district court\u2019s instruction\n        that the jury could convict so long as it found\n        that one of the purposes of the interstate\n        transportation was an immoral one.\n        Notwithstanding Mortensen\u2019s language on the\n        dominant motive, we upheld the instruction.\n        Both before 1950 and thereafter many other\n        circuit courts took the same position, namely,\n        that it was enough if one of the efficient\n        purposes of the interstate transportation was\n        to engage in the outlawed activity.\n\f28            UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\n     [The defendant] urges us to reconsider Daigle\n     as being inconsistent with the Supreme\n     Court\u2019s venerable pronouncements in\n     Mortensen and elsewhere on dominant\n     motive. We are not persuaded. Quite apart\n     from the 40 years that have elapsed since\n     Daigle, and its widespread acceptance, we\n     believe Daigle\u2019s reasoning to be sound and\n     not inconsistent with Mortensen. As the\n     Daigle court pointed out, there was in\n     Mortensen a total lack of evidence of any\n     purpose for the interstate journey other than\n     the innocent one of giving the women a\n     deserved vacation from their work as\n     prostitutes in their bawdy house. Thus the\n     Court had no reason to consider the question\n     of multiple purposes. It is true that the\n     language in Mortensen alluding to a single\n     dominant purpose was repeated in a footnote\n     in [Hawkins], but in Hawkins the Court was\n     concerned with a very different issue. No\n     more than Mortensen itself does Hawkins\n     contradict Daigle on the narrow issue of\n     interstate journeys involving several motives.\n\n     In the present case, as in Daigle, the district\n     court . . . sufficiently met the requirements of\n     Mortensen, as interpreted in Daigle, by\n     requiring that criminal sexual activity be one\n     of the several motives or purposes not a mere\n     incident of the trip or trips, but instead was at\n     least one of the defendant\u2019s motivations for\n     taking the trip in the first place.\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                    29\n\nId. at 389\u201390 (citations, alterations, footnote reference, and\ninternal quotation marks omitted) (emphases in the original).\n\n    The dissent also relies on a 1947 decision from the Eighth\nCircuit, Mellor v. United States, 160 F.2d 757 (8th Cir. 1947).\nSee Dissenting Opinion, p. 45 n.2. However, the Eighth\nCircuit has remained steadfast, as of 2020, in applying the\nmotivating purpose standard. See Perkins, 948 F.3d\nat 938\u201339 (stating that \u201cto prove the intent element under\n\u00a7 2423(a), the illicit behavior must be one of the purposes\nmotivating the interstate transportation, but need not be the\ndominant purpose, and the sexual activity just may not be\nmerely incidental to the trip\u201d) (citations, alteration, and\ninternal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in the original).\n\n    The dissent\u2019s approach closely resembles the argument\nadvanced by the defendant and rejected by the Third Circuit\nin Hayward. As the Third Circuit observed, \u201c[the defendant]\npoints to no case in which any Court of Appeals required a\njury instruction that criminal sexual activity must be the\ndominant purpose of interstate travel to support a conviction\nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a).\u201d 359 F.3d at 638 (footnote\nreference omitted) (emphasis in the original). The Third\nCircuit further emphasized the uniformity of the circuits on\nthis issue: the \u201cFirst, Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Tenth\nCircuits, in which criminal sexual activity was one of a\nnumber of multiple motives for interstate travel . . . declined\nto reverse convictions where the respective district court had\nrefused or failed to give the dominant purpose jury instruction\nthat [the defendant] now requests.\u201d Id. (citations and internal\nquotation marks omitted) (emphasis in the original).\n\n    Against this backdrop of uniform precedent, the dissent\nrelies on United States v. Generes, 405 U.S. 93 (1972), \u201ca tax\n\f30               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\ncase\u201d for which the dissent contends \u201cthe particulars are not\nimportant to us.\u201d Dissenting Opinion, p. 60. We disagree.\nThe \u201cparticulars\u201d are important because they reveal the lack\nof applicability of this tax case to the instruction given by the\ndistrict court in this criminal case.\n\n    In Generes, \u201c[a] debt a closely held corporation owed to\nan indemnifying shareholder-employee became worthless in\n1962.\u201d Generes, 405 U.S. at 94. The issue was \u201cwhether, for\nthe shareholder-employee, that worthless obligation was a\nbusiness or a nonbusiness bad debt\u201d under the Internal\nRevenue Code and corresponding Treasury Regulations. Id.\nThe Treasury Regulation specified that \u201cthe character of the\ndebt is to be determined by the relation which the loss\nresulting from the debt\u2019s becoming worthless bears to the\ntrade or business of the taxpayer. If that relation is a\nproximate one in the conduct of the trade or business in\nwhich the taxpayer is engaged at the time the debt becomes\nworthless, the debt comes within the exception provided by\nthat subparagraph.\u201d Id. at 95 n.2 (alteration omitted)\n(emphasis added). The Supreme Court explained that \u201c[i]n\ndetermining whether a bad debt is a business or a nonbusiness\nobligation, the Regulations focus on the relation the loss bears\nto the taxpayer\u2019s business,\u201d and that \u201c[i]f, at the time of\nworthlessness, that relation is a proximate one, the debt\nqualifies as a business bad debt and the aforementioned\ndesirable tax consequences then ensue.\u201d Id. at 95 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Resolution of the issue \u201cturn[ed]\non the proper measure of the required proximate relation.\u201d\nId.\n\n    \u201cAt the trial Mr. Generes testified that his sole motive in\nsigning the indemnity agreement was to protect his\n$12,000-a-year employment with the corporation,\u201d and the\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                          31\n\ndistrict court instructed the jury that a \u201csignificant,\u201d as\nopposed to a \u201cdominant\u201d motivation, \u201csatisfie[d] the\nRegulations\u2019 requirement of proximate relationship.\u201d Id.\nat 99 (footnote reference omitted).\n\n    The Supreme Court \u201cconclude[d] that in determining\nwhether a bad debt has a proximate relation to the taxpayer\u2019s\ntrade or business, as the Regulations specify, and thus\nqualifies as a business bad debt, the proper measure is that of\ndominant motivation, and that only significant motivation is\nnot sufficient.\u201d Id. at 103. In delineating the dominant\nmotivation standard for debts under the Tax Code and\nTreasury Regulations, the Supreme Court stated in full9 that:\n\n        The dominant-motivation standard has the\n        attribute of workability. It provides a\n        guideline of certainty for the trier of fact. The\n        trier then may compare the risk against the\n        potential reward and give proper emphasis to\n        the objective rather than to the subjective. As\n        has just been noted, an employee-shareholder,\n        in making or guaranteeing a loan to his\n        corporation, usually acts with two\n        motivations, the one to protect his investment\n        and the other to protect his employment. By\n        making the dominant motivation the measure,\n        the logical tax consequence ensues and\n        prevents the mere presence of a business\n        motive, however small and however\n        insignificant, from controlling the tax result at\n        the taxpayer's convenience. This is of\n\n   9\n     The dissent omits the highlighted language utilized by the Supreme\nCourt in articulating the standard. See Dissenting Opinion, p. 60.\n\f32               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\n       particular importance in a tax system that is so\n       largely dependent on voluntary compliance.\n\nId. at 104 (emphasis added).\n\n    There are notable distinctions between the standard\narticulated in Generes and the standard applied to travel and\ntransportation offenses for criminal sexual activity. First, the\napplicable Treasury Regulation, in defining nonbusiness debt,\n\u201cfocus[ed] on the relation the loss bears to the taxpayer\u2019s\nbusiness. If, at the time of worthlessness, that relation is a\nproximate one, the debt qualifies as a business bad debt and\nthe aforementioned desirable tax consequences then ensue.\u201d\nId. at 96. In contrast, the criminal statutes prohibiting\ntransportation of individuals and minors for criminal sexual\nactivity are not premised on a \u201cproximate relation,\u201d instead\nestablishing criminal liability for a defendant who \u201cknowingly\ntransports any individual in interstate or foreign commerce,\nor in any Territory or Possession of the United States, with\nintent that such individual engage in prostitution, or in any\nsexual activity for which any person can be charged with a\ncriminal offense,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421(a) (emphases added), or\nwho \u201cknowingly transports an individual who has not attained\nthe age of 18 years in interstate or foreign commerce, or in\nany commonwealth, territory or possession of the United\nStates, with intent that the individual engage in prostitution,\nor in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a) (emphases\nadded).\n\n   Second, the Supreme Court developed the dominant\nmotivation standard in the tax context in order to prevent \u201cthe\nmere presence of a business motive, however small and\nhowever insignificant, from controlling the tax result at the\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                    33\n\ntaxpayer\u2019s convenience.\u201d Generes, 405 U.S. at 104. This\nreasoning is consistent with the district court\u2019s instruction\nthat \u201cthe government must prove that the criminal sexual\nactivity was not merely incidental to the transportation.\u201d\n\n   Third and finally, the Supreme Court emphasized that:\n\n       The Code itself carefully distinguishes\n       between business and non-business items. . . .\n       The point . . . is that the tax statutes have\n       made the distinction, that the Congress\n       therefore intended it to be a meaningful one,\n       and that the distinction is not to be obliterated\n       or blunted by an interpretation that tends to\n       equate the business bad debt with the\n       nonbusiness bad debt.          We think that\n       emphasis upon the significant rather than\n       upon the dominant would have a tendency to\n       do just that.\n\nId. at 103\u201304 (emphases added). The dissent does not point\nto any similar distinctions intended by Congress in its efforts\nto prohibit the transportation of minors and other individuals\nfor criminal sexual activity.\n\n    Thus, the dissent ostensibly posits that the district court\nshould have imported the \u201cdominant motivation\u201d standard\nused to determine a nonbusiness debt under the Treasury\nRegulations to instruct the jury concerning the charges\nbrought against Flucas for transporting minors or other\nindividuals and engaging in criminal sexual activity. See\n\f34                  UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nDissenting Opinion, p. 60. In light of Lukashov,10 Lindsay,\nand consistent precedent from other circuits, we decline to\nhold that the district court erred as a matter of law in not\ninstructing the jury based on the dissent\u2019s formulation of a\nstandard applied in tax cases.\n\n    Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertions, see Dissenting\nOpinion, pp. 61\u201364, we are unconvinced that the non-\nretroactive amendment to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b), a statute\ninvolving travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct\nthat Flucas was not charged under, has any bearing on the\ninstructional issue raised in this appeal.11 Prior to December,\n2018, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b) provided that:\n\n          A person who travels in interstate commerce\n          or travels into the United States, or a United\n          States citizen or an alien admitted for\n          permanent residence in the United States who\n          travels in foreign commerce, for the purpose\n          of engaging in any illicit sexual conduct with\n          another person shall be fined under this title\n          or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b)(2017) (emphasis added). In December,\n2018, pursuant to the Abolish Human Trafficking Act of\n2017, Congress amended 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b) in order to\n\n     10\n       The best argument that the dissent can muster against our reasoning\nin Lukashov is that it was dicta. See Dissenting Opinion, p. 56. But dicta\nor not, it was consistent with the other precedent approving the language\nin the district court\u2019s instruction.\n     11\n       The amendment to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b) to specify \u201ca motivating\npurpose\u201d standard has not been applied retroactively. See United States\nv. Lieu, 963 F.3d 122, 126 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2020).\n\f                 UNITED STATES V.

Pub. L. 115-392, December 21, 2018, 132 Stat\n5250, 5256.\n\n    The Seventh Circuit\u2019s discussion in United States v.\nMcGuire, 627 F.3d 622 (7th Cir. 2010) of the \u201cpurpose\u201d\nrequirement for 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b), prior to the 2018\namendment, is instructive. In that case, the government only\ncharged the defendant with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b).\nThe Seventh Circuit detailed the practical ramifications of the\ngovernment\u2019s charging decision resulting from the statutory\ndistinctions:\n\n       Section 2421 is the original Mann Act, as\n       amended in minor respects. Section 2423(a),\n       intended to protect minors from sexual\n       predation, mirrors the Mann Act but imposes\n       more severe penalties. Section 2423(b), the\n       provision under which the defendant was\n       prosecuted, was added to expand the\n       protection of minors still further; it punishes\n       travel in interstate commerce even if no minor\n       is transported, if the purpose of the travel is\n       sex with a minor. (Prosecutors frequently use\n       this section to prosecute persons who cross\n       state lines to rendezvous with minors whom\n       they meet in online chat rooms). Section\n       2423(c) was added to punish persons who\n       travel in foreign commerce and have sex with\n       a minor in the course of the trip regardless of\n       what the defendant intended when he set out\n       on it. It is apparent that if, as the jury found,\n       the defendant had molested [the victim] on\n\f36               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\n       their travels, he violated sections 2421,\n       2423(a), and 2423(c). But inexplicably the\n       government charged the defendant only with\n       violating section 2423(b), which requires that\n       the travel be for the purpose of engaging in\n       illegal sexual activity. This charging decision\n       . . . enabled the defendant to argue that the\n       purpose of his trips was merely to conduct\n       retreats; sex was not the purpose but a\n       welcome byproduct . . . of the opportunities\n       that the retreats created, as the boys were\n       more vulnerable when far from home and the\n       defendant\u2019s molestation of them was less\n       likely to be detected by his religious\n       superiors, who as we know had suspected him\n       for many years of being a child molester yet\n       had taken no effective steps to protect young\n       boys from him.\n\nId. at 624 (citations omitted) (emphasis in the original).\n\n    In its amended form, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b) requires that the\ngovernment demonstrate that \u201ca motivating purpose\u201d of the\ndefendant\u2019s travels was to engage in illicit sexual activity.\nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b) (2021). It bears emphasizing that,\ndespite decades of precedent holding that a dominant,\nsignificant, or motivating purpose may suffice to establish the\nrequisite intent for 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a), Congress did not\namend that statutory provision in any fashion. Notably,\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a), in stark contrast with the amended\nversion of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b), does not use the term\n\u201cpurpose,\u201d instead providing that \u201c[a] person who knowingly\ntransports an individual who has not attained the age of\n18 years in interstate or foreign commerce, or in any\n\f                 UNITED STATES V.

Garland, 11 F.4th 764, 776\u201377 (9th Cir.\n2021) (citations, alterations, and internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n    In sum, we are not persuaded that the non-retroactive\n2018 amendment to \u00a7 2423(b) has any bearing on whether the\ndistrict court abused its discretion in instructing the jury.\nRather, we conclude that the district court correctly instructed\nthe jury in accordance with our precedent and that of our\nsister circuits with respect to the intent requirements under\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2421(a) and 2423(a). After all, if Congress\nwanted to also amend \u00a7 2423(a), it could have easily done so.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n    The district court did not abuse its discretion in\ninstructing the jury concerning the intent requirements for\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2421(a) and 2423(a). The instruction\ncomported with our precedent, as well as that of our sister\ncircuits, that the government must prove beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that a dominant, significant, or motivating purpose of\nthe transportation of the individuals was to engage in criminal\nsexual activity. The non-retroactive amendment of a statute\nthat Flucas was not charged under does not undermine the\n\f38               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nconsistent precedent throughout the circuits rejecting the\n\u201cdominant purpose\u201d mens rea advocated by Flucas.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nSCHROEDER, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n    This is not a complicated case. As Judge Rawlinson\u2019s\nopinion documents, the language in this instruction has been\nprovided to juries for decades and approved by appellate\ncourts. It required the jury to find that illegal sexual activity\nwas a \u201csignificant, dominant, or motivating purpose\u201d of the\ntravel. I concur in Judge Rawlinson\u2019s opinion but write\nbriefly only to underscore the key points that in my view\nundermine the dissent.\n\n    First, the dissent views as binding language the Supreme\nCourt used more than seventy years ago in a case that raised\ndifferent issues than those raised here. The statute here\nrequires interstate travel \u201cwith intent\u201d to engage in unlawful\nsexual activity. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2421(a), 2423(a). The\nSupreme Court\u2019s opinion in Mortensen v. United States said\nthat such intent must be a \u201cdominant motive\u201d for the travel.\n322 U.S. 369, 374 (1944). But the problem in Mortensen was\nthat the defendants had no intent to engage in unlawful\nactivities during their travel. See id. at 372. They were\ntaking a vacation from their business of running a brothel.\nSee id. That was \u201cundisputed.\u201d See id. The Court was\ntherefore not referring to any required quantum of unlawful\nintent. The dissent thus fastens on to words that do not come\nfrom a case where the defendant traveled with any unlawful\nintent, much less from a case like this, where the defendant\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                     39\n\nintended to engage in unlawful sex with members of his\nhousehold while moving them to a different state.\n\n     Second, although the dissent acknowledges that the\ninstruction the parties agreed to was appropriate, the only\ndifference between that instruction and this one was the\naddition of the phrase \u201cor motivating\u201d to the adjectives\n\u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cdominant.\u201d As the district court observed,\nit is hard to see how the addition makes any difference, and\neven harder to imagine how the jury would have understood\n\u201cmotivating\u201d as describing a materially lower standard than\n\u201csignificant.\u201d As the majority opinion demonstrates, courts\nhave routinely treated the words as interchangeable. That this\ninstruction has so long been given to juries without being\nquestioned in this way only underscores the lack of\nperceptible difference between \u201cdominant,\u201d \u201csignificant,\u201d and\n\u201cmotivating.\u201d\n\n     Third, the dissent surmises that this jury likely did see a\ndifference because the first jury did not convict and the\nsecond jury did. Even assuming the phrase was added\nerroneously, we can not assume the addition could have been\nresponsible for the different result. Retrials differ from first\ntrials in many ways, only some of which might affect the\njury\u2019s perceptions. Here, for example, in the second trial, the\ngovernment changed its presentation to concentrate on the\ndefendant\u2019s activities during one time period rather than two.\nThe second jury thus heard a more focused presentation that\ncould have affected its understanding of the case. In contrast,\nfor the change in the wording of the instruction to have\npossibly mattered, there would have to be some likelihood\nthat the jury shot a perceived gap between \u201csignificant\u201d and\n\u201cmotivating,\u201d a gap neither the district judge, nor any other\njudges reviewing similar instructions has ever thought\n\f40                UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nexisted. The dissent is thus not supported by facts, semantics,\nor precedent.\n\n\n\nBYBEE, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n    Rodney Flucas is not a sympathetic defendant. There is\noverwhelming evidence that Flucas groomed young girls for\nsex, including his own daughters. He has fathered at least ten\nchildren with these young women, making him the father of\nhis own grandchildren. Although he likely can be charged for\nthese acts in the states of Georgia, Oregon, and California, the\nquestion in this case is whether Flucas has violated a federal\nlaw, the Mann Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2421\u201324, for transporting\nwomen and minors across state lines with the intent to engage\nin criminal sexual activity. Flucas moved his family from\nOregon to California when he accepted a new, better-paying\nposition as a special education teacher in Stockton. But as the\nCourt trenchantly observed: \u201cPeople not of good moral\ncharacter, like others, travel from place to place and change\ntheir residence. But to say that, because they indulge in\nillegal or immoral acts, they travel for that purpose, is to\nemphasize that which is incidental and ignore what is of\nprimary significance.\u201d Hansen v. Haff, 291 U.S. 559, 562\u201363\n(1934).\n\n    At Flucas\u2019s first trial, the district court instructed the jury\nthat Flucas could be convicted only if the jury found that\n\u201ccriminal sexual activity was one of the dominant purposes,\nnot merely an incidental purpose, for the transportation from\none state to another.\u201d That jury hung and was dismissed. At\nthe second trial, the government requested a different\ninstruction, over Flucas\u2019s objections. The district court\n\f                UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                   41\n\nagreed to the instruction and told the jury it could convict\nFlucas if \u201csexual activity was a significant, dominant, or\nmotivating purpose\u201d for transporting the women across state\nlines. The second time the jury convicted Flucas.\n\n    The question before us is a linguistic one. No court has\nconsidered whether \u201ca motivating purpose\u201d is different from\n\u201ca dominant or significant purpose.\u201d In my view, those terms\nare not synonymous.          The instruction lowered the\ngovernment\u2019s burden of proof, contrary to the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Mortensen v. United States, 322 U.S. 309\n(1944), and our own Mann Act decisions; and the error in\ninstruction is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Flucas\nmay be guilty of committing heinous acts in multiple\njurisdictions. But the government must show that his\ndominant or significant purpose for traveling between those\njurisdictions was to commit those unlawful sexual acts. He\nmay or may not have done so. I respectfully dissent.\n\n                              I\n\n    In 1910, born out of a hysteria that \u201cwhite slavers\u201d were\npreying upon young women\u2014coercing them into prostitution\nthrough threats, intimidation, and force\u2014Congress passed\nwhat is commonly called the Mann Act. See United States v.\nVang, 128 F.3d 1065, 1069\u201370 (7th Cir. 1997); David J.\nLangum, Crossing Over the Line: Legislating Morality and\nthe Mann Act 3\u20134 (2006). Section 2 of the Act stated\n\n       [A]ny person who shall knowingly transport\n       or cause to be transported, or aid or assist in\n       obtaining transportation for, or in\n       transporting, in interstate or foreign\n       commerce, or in any Territory or in the\n\f42               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\n       District of Columbia, any woman or girl for\n       the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or\n       for any other immoral purpose, or with the\n       intent and purpose to induce, entice, or\n       compel such woman or girl to become a\n       prostitute or to give herself up to debauchery,\n       or to engage in any other immoral practice . . .\n       shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . . .\n\nWhite-Slave Traffic Act (Mann Act), Pub. L. No. 277, \u00a7 2, 36\nStat. 825 (1910) (emphasis added), current version at\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421. Alas, \u00a7 2 of the Mann Act used the term\n\u201cintent.\u201d Intent is an important, perfectly good legal concept,\nbut sometimes in a statute, it is not particularly helpful. This\nis one of those instances. The question is, what kind of intent\ncounts? The Mann Act isn\u2019t clear on this point.\n\n    The Supreme Court took up the question in Mortensen v.\nUnited States, 322 U.S. 369 (1944). The Mortensens were\nhusband and wife who lived in Nebraska, where they ran a\nhouse of prostitution. In 1940, they traveled by car to Salt\nLake City to visit family and national parks. They invited\ntwo of the prostitutes they managed to accompany them on\nthe trip, and the girls accepted. No acts of prostitution\noccurred along the route, nor while they were in Utah. When\nthe Mortensens and the two young women returned to\nNebraska, the girls resumed their sex trade. The United\nStates charged the Mortensens with violating the Mann Act\nby transporting the girls in interstate commerce from Salt\nLake City to Nebraska for the purpose of engaging in\nprostitution. The Court wrote that \u201c[a]n intention that the\nwomen or girls shall engage in the conduct outlawed by\nSection 2 must be found to exist before the conclusion of the\ninterstate journey and must be the dominant motive of such\n\f                    UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                            43\n\ninterstate movement.\u201d Id. at 374 (emphasis added). On that\nbasis, the Court overturned the conviction. Even \u201cassum[ing]\nthat [the Mortensens] anticipated that the two girls would\nresume their activities as prostitutes,\u201d the \u201cinterstate vacation\ntrip . . . was [not] undertaken . . . for the purpose of, or as a\nmeans of effecting or facilitating, such activities.\u201d Id. at\n374\u201375. According to the Court, \u201c[w]hat Congress has\noutlawed by the Mann Act, . . . is the use of interstate\ncommerce as a calculated means for effectuating sexual\nimmorality.\u201d Id. at 375 (emphasis added). The Court\nrepeated its \u201cdominant purpose\u201d formulation in subsequent\nMann Act cases. See, e.g., Hawkins v. United States,\n358 U.S. 74, 79 (1958) (\u201cdominant purpose\u201d); Cleveland v.\nUnited States, 329 U.S. 14, 20 (1946) (\u201cdominant motive\u201d).\n\n    The statute has been amended several times since\nMortensen. See Vang, 128 F.3d at 1069 (recounting the\nhistory). The version Flucas was convicted under reads,\n\u201c[w]hoever knowingly transports any individual in interstate\nor foreign commerce . . . with intent that such individual\nengage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to\ndo so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more\nthan 10 years, or both.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421(a).1 Despite\namendments that changed the Mann Act\u2019s \u201cintent and\npurpose\u201d language to \u201cintent,\u201d Mortensen continues to\ninfluence our thinking in this area. But the Supreme Court\u2019s\nlanguage in Mortensen has also caused great confusion.\n\n\n\n\n    1\n      Flucas was also convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(a). The\nlanguage of \u00a7 2423(a) is substantially similar to \u00a7 2321(a), but applies to\ntransportation of minors.\n\f44                UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\n                               A\n\n    Federal courts since Mortensen have struggled with the\nCourt\u2019s \u201cdominant motive\u201d formulation. Indeed, \u201ccourts turn\nhandsprings trying to define \u2018dominant.\u2019\u201d United States v.\nMcGuire, 627 F.3d 622, 625 (7th Cir. 2010). For some time,\nthe courts debated whether Mortensen meant that the jury\nmust find that illicit sexual conduct was \u201cthe dominant\nmotive\u201d or \u201ca dominant motive\u201d for the interstate\ntransportation. We were concerned that a person could have\nmore than one dominant purpose. The courts quickly agreed,\nhowever, that people travel with mixed motives, and that so\nlong as \u201ca dominant motive\u201d was to traffic in prostitution or\nanother illegal criminal sex offense, the Mann Act was\nsatisfied. See, e.g., United States v. Drury, 582 F.2d 1181,\n1185 (8th Cir. 1978) (prostitution must be \u201cone of the\ndominant purposes of such interstate travel\u201d); United States\nv. Snow, 507 F.2d 22, 24 (7th Cir. 1974) (\u201cIt now appears\nsettled that prostitution or other immoral conduct, need not be\nthe sole reason for the transportation . . . .\u201d); United States v.\nSalter, 346 F.2d 509, 511 (6th Cir. 1965) (\u201cIt is sufficient if\nprostitution was only one of the dominant purposes.\u201d);\nDingess v. United States, 315 F.2d 238, 240 (4th Cir. 1963)\n(\u201cIf [the defendant] had some other lawful, but subordinate,\npurpose which he also sought to serve, the existence of that\nlawful purpose cannot purify or legitimize the dominant\npurpose of prostituting his female companions.\u201d); Dunn v.\nUnited States, 190 F.2d 496, 497 (10th Cir. 1951) (\u201cIt is\nenough that one of the dominant purposes was prostitution or\ndebauchery.\u201d). See also Forrest v. United States, 363 F.2d\n348, 350 (5th Cir. 1966).\n\n   But the courts thought that the phrase \u201cdominant motive\u201d\nwas still confusing and began tinkering with alternative word\n\f                      UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                                45\n\nformulas. Word formulas in statutes are typically Congress\u2019s\neffort to capture a \u201cmood.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v.\nNLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 487 (1951). Moods can be hard to\ndescribe\u2014a mood is itself \u201cnot . . . a body of rigid rules.\u201d Id.\nNevertheless, \u201c[a]s legislation that mood must be respected,\neven if it can only serve as a standard for judgment.\u201d Id. In\nthe case of the Mann Act, the federal courts tried to capture\nCongress\u2019s mood by adding their own word formulas. As I\ndemonstrate below, as we changed word formulas, we strayed\nfrom Mortensen\u2019s determination that the Mann act requires\nengaging in illicit sexual activity play a dominant role in the\ndecision to travel between jurisdictions.\n\n    In the aftermath of Mortensen, a number courts of appeals\nlooked to causation language borrowed from tort. They\nvariously required the government to prove that sex\ntrafficking was an \u201cefficient purpose,\u201d an \u201cefficient and\ncompelling purpose,\u201d or a \u201ccompelling and efficient\npurpose.\u201d2 See, e.g., Daigle v. United States, 181 F.2d 311,\n\n\n     2\n         The earliest use of \u201cefficient purpose\u201d in a published opinion\nappears just two years after Mortensen. See United States v. Mellor, 71 F.\nSupp. 53, 62 (D. Neb. 1946), aff\u2019d, 160 F.2d 757 (8th Cir. 1947). The\ndistrict court in its explanation of the instruction referred to \u201cefficient\npurpose\u201d as \u201cexplanatory causation.\u201d 71 F. Supp. at 62. The related term\n\u201cefficient cause\u201d has its origins in tort. See Jeremiah Smith, Legal Cause\nin Actions of Tort, 25 Harv. L. Rev. 303 (1912). Professor Smith\u2019s focus\nwas whether \u201cthe defendant\u2019s tort [was] a substantial factor in producing\nthe damage complained of.\u201d Id. at 310. He suggested that possible word\nsubstitutes for \u201csubstantial\u201d might include \u201cefficient,\u201d \u201ccontinuously\nefficient,\u201d and \u201cactive and efficient\u201d factor. Id. at 310 n.22. Anticipating\nsome of the developments here, he also suggested that \u201ca substantial\nfactor\u201d meant \u201c[n]ot the sole factor, nor the predominant factor. Enough\nif it is a substantial part of the causative antecedents; if it is one of several\nsubstantial factors.\u201d Id. at 311. See also Scott G. Johnson, The Efficient\nProximate Cause Doctrine In California: Ten Years After Garvey, 2 J. Ins.\n\f46                 UNITED STATES V.

Schneider,\n801 F.3d 186, 194 (3d Cir. 2015) (\u201cIt now appears settled that\n. . . immoral conduct, need not be the sole reason for the\ntransportation; the Act may be violated if [immoral conduct]\nis a dominant or a compelling and efficient purpose.\u201d\n(alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Snow,\n507 F.2 22, 24 (7th Cir. 1974)). In 1997, in an influential\nopinion reviewing the Mann Act\u2019s history and the cases, the\nSeventh Circuit observed that \u201ccourts have used a \u201cdominant\npurpose\u2019 standard but have regarded \u2018dominant\u2019 as\nsynonymous with \u2018compelling\u2019 or \u2018motivating.\u2019\u201d Vang,\n128 F.3d at 1071. The court concluded that \u201c[c]ourts . . .\nhave consistently used the word \u2018dominant\u2019 to mean merely\n\u2018significant\u2019 or \u2018compelling\u2019 or \u2018efficient.\u2019\u201d Inexplicably, it\nfurther opined that \u201cthere has never been any implied\n\n\nCoverage 1, 5\u20136 (1999) (noting that in tort \u201cefficient proximate cause\u201d\nmeans \u201cpredominating cause\u201d).\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                     47\n\nrequirement of preeminence of purpose.\u201d Id. at 1072. See\nalso McGuire, 627 F.3d at 625.\n\n    Although, prior to Vang, the phrase \u201cmotivating purpose\u201d\nhad not appeared regularly in cases, it had been used by some\ncourts, usually in a casual way. See Campbell, 49 F.3d\nat 1083. Around 2000, however, the phrase began to show up\nmore frequently. In United States v. Cryar, for example, the\ndistrict court had instructed the jury that the illegal sexual\nconduct need not be the sole purpose for the travel, but was\nsufficient under the Mann Act if it was \u201cone of the\nDefendant\u2019s efficient and compelling purposes, or one of the\nDefendant\u2019s dominant purposes.\u201d 232 F.3d 1318, 1324 (10th\nCir. 2000). The court of appeals affirmed the conviction and,\nin the process, subtly altered the word formula. The court\ncommented that \u201cthere was ample evidence for a jury to\ndetermine that a motivating or dominant purpose\u201d for Cryar\u2019s\ntravel was to engage in sexual conduct with a minor. Id.\n(emphasis added). The language of \u201cmotivating purpose\u201d\nwas the Tenth Circuit\u2019s imprecise gloss on what the district\ncourt had instructed.\n\n    The Third Circuit followed suit, approving the addition of\n\u201ca motivating purpose\u201d to jury instructions. In United States\nv. Hayward, Hayward and his wife owned a competitive\ncheerleading school and chaperoned six teenaged girls on a\ntrip to London. 359 F.3d 631 (3d Cir. 2004). While there,\nHayward plied them with alcohol and engaged in sexual\nactivity with them. At trial, Hayward argued that the jury\nmust find the illegal sexual conduct was \u201ca dominant\npurpose\u201d for the trip. The district court declined and\ninstructed the jury that it was sufficient if the conduct was \u201ca\nsignificant or motivating purpose\u201d of the trip to London. Id.\nat 638 (emphasis added). On appeal, Hayward altered his\n\f48               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nstrategy and claimed that the only proper instruction was that\nthe trip had to be \u201cthe dominant purpose\u201d for the trip. The\ncourt rejected all of Hayward\u2019s formulations, finding that the\njury instruction was proper. Id.\n\n    Hayward\u2019s emendation was picked up in a prominent\nfederal jury instruction treatise. In a section discussing the\nMann Act and citing Hayward as its authority, Modern\nFederal Jury Instructions recommends the following\ninstruction for the intent element of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421:\n\n       In order to establish this element, it is not\n       necessary for the government to prove that\n       engaging in prostitution was the sole purpose\n       for crossing the state line. A person may have\n       several different purposes or motives for such\n       travel, and each may prompt in varying\n       degrees the act of making the journey. The\n       government must prove beyond a reasonable\n       doubt, however, that a significant or\n       motivating purpose of the travel across a state\n       line was that [said individual(s)] would\n       engage in prostitution. In other words, that\n       illegal activity must not have been merely\n       incidental to the trip.\n\n3 Leonard B. Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions:\nCriminal, \u00b6 64.01, Instr. 64-4 (2021) (brackets in original).\nThe treatise blended two distinct concepts. The second\nsentence quoted above uses \u201cpurposes\u201d and \u201cmotives\u201d as\nnouns and treats them as synonyms. But the third sentence\nconverts \u201cmotive\u201d to an adjective modifying \u201cpurpose.\u201d As\na matter of syntax, the treatise can\u2019t have it both ways.\nHaving suggested that \u201cpurposes\u201d and \u201cmotives\u201d are the\n\f                    UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                            49\n\nsame, a \u201cmotivating purpose\u201d is redundant. It\u2019s like saying\n\u201cpurposeful purpose\u201d or \u201cmotivating motive.\u201d\n\n    Confusion followed in the commentary. Modern Federal\nJury Instructions proposes that the illicit sexual activity does\nnot have to be \u201cthe dominant motive, but only that it be a\ndominant motive in that it was a compelling or significant\nmotivation for the travel.\u201d Id. \u00b6 64.01, Instr. 64-4, Comment\n(emphasis added). That statement would accurately capture\nthe pre-2000 consensus. The problem is that between the\nmodel instruction and the commentary, the treatise uses\n\u201csignificant purpose,\u201d \u201cmotivating purpose,\u201d \u201ccompelling\nmotivation,\u201d and \u201csignificant motivation\u201d as equivalents. The\ninconsistency is not explained.3 Modern Federal Jury\nInstructions has found its way into district court instructions\nand been approved by at least one court of appeals. United\nStates v. An Soon Kim, 471 F. App\u2019x. 82, 84 (2d Cir. 2012)\n(quoting the district court\u2019s instructions, which quote from\nModern Federal Jury Instructions, and citing the treatise with\napproval).\n\n\n\n\n    3\n      Compounding its own confusion, in the same paragraph, the treatise\nalso favors eliminating use of the word \u201cdominant\u201d and the phrase\n\u201cefficient and compelling purpose\u201d in instructions because they are\n\u201clikely to confuse the jury.\u201d But, the treatise proposes using \u201cthe clearer\nterms \u2018sole purpose\u2019 and \u2018significant or motivating purpose,\u2019 which are\neasier to understand.\u201d Modern Federal Jury Instructions: Criminal,\n\u00b6 64.01, Instr. 64-4, Comment. Thus, in the same paragraph, the treatise\nproposes that courts may use \u201csignificant motivation,\u201d \u201cmotivating\npurpose,\u201d or \u201csignificant purpose\u201d interchangeably, without any\nexplanation of how those phrases are equivalent.\n\f50                   UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\n                                     B\n\n    Our own precedent on the proper jury instruction in a\nMann Act case has followed a similar twisted path. We first\ngrappled with Mortensen\u2019s \u201cdominant motive\u201d in Langford\nv. United States, 178 F.2d 48 (9th Cir. 1949).4 Langford had\nacted as Jones\u2019s pimp. Eventually Langford asked Jones to\nmarry him, although he told her she would have to continue\nto engage in prostitution. Jones and Langford traveled to\nTijuana to be married, after which they returned to Los\nAngeles where Jones resumed her prostitution. Citing\nMortensen, we held that there was sufficient evidence that\n\u201c[Langford\u2019s] dominant motive\u201d for the marriage was to get\ncontrol of Jones and re-establish a relationship of pander and\nprostitute. . . and that the trip, marriage and all, had that\nprimary end in view.\u201d Id. at 52. See also Powell v. United\nStates, 347 F.2d 156, 157 (9th Cir. 1965) (\u201cThe trial court\nproperly instructed the jury that the immoral purpose . . .\n[must] exist before the journey ends and supply the dominant\nmotive for the trip.\u201d).\n\n   We soon began considering the problem of mixed\nmotives. In Twitchell v. United States, we reconsidered our\n\n\n     4\n       We ignored Mortensen in Womble v. United States, 146 F.2d 263\n(9th Cir. 1945). Dewey Womble drove from Louisville, Kentucky, to\nStockton, California with Stephen Culp and Dewel Kathleen Womble.\nAfter arriving, Dewel Kathleen Womble began working as a prostitute.\nDewey Womble claimed \u201cthere was no evidence in that transporting\nDewel Kathleen Womble he had any intent that she should practice\nprostitution.\u201d Id. at 263. We held that intent could be \u201cinfer[red] . . . from\nall the circumstances of the evidence.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court reversed\nour decision in a two-sentence opinion holding that there was \u201cwant of\nsubstantial evidence to sustain the conviction.\u201d Womble v. United States,\n324 U.S. 830, 830 (1945) (per curiam).\n\f                 UNITED STATES V.

United States, 376 U.S. 188 (1964), vacating\nin part Twitchell v. United States, 313 F.3d 425 (9th Cir.\n1963). Rogers ran a motel in Everett, Washington, in which\nseveral units were used for prostitution. A woman named\nRyan worked at the motel and occasionally oversaw the\nprostitutes. When Ryan went to Portland, where she went on\na drinking spree, Rogers went and picked her up and returned\nher to Everett, where she took several weeks to sober up\nbefore returning to work at the motel. We reversed Rogers\u2019s\nconviction under the Mann Act:\n\n        [T]here is no showing that Ryan\u2019s trip to\n        Portland was for an immoral purpose. It was\n        to visit her home. The most that can be said\n        of the return trip is that the dominant purpose\n        was to get her sobered up and away from\n        home, where she had her drinking problem.\n        Nothing in the record would support a finding\n        that either the or a dominant purpose of that\n        trip was to have her resume immoral\n        activities.\n\nId. at 761.\n\n    In Bush v. United States, we found the \u201csole issue\u201d was\n\u201cthe intent of defendant\u2014did he have the intent, purpose and\nmotive in bringing the complaining witness to California to\nhave her engage in immoral practices?\u201d 267 F.2d 483, 485\n(9th Cir. 1959). In Bush\u2019s case, the issue was not a\nparticularly difficult one. Bush was convicted of taking a\nseventeen year old from Texas to California, where she began\nengaging in prostitution, jointly with Bush\u2019s wife, who had\n\f52               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nbeen a prostitute in Texas. Upholding the conviction, we\nstated that \u201c[i]t was not necessary that such intent be the sole\nand single purpose of the transportation, if such purpose and\nintent was one of the reasons for the transportation.\u201d Id.\n(citation omitted).\n\n     We followed Bush in United States v. Fox, when we made\nclear that it was \u201conly necessary that the government prove\nthat [prostitution, debauchery, or other immoral purpose] was\none of the dominant purposes.\u201d 425 F.2d 996, 999 (9th Cir.\n1970) (emphasis added). We approved the instruction as \u201ca\ncommon and correct statement of the law.\u201d Id. We found no\nmerits in the defendant\u2019s claim that the \u201cjury might have\nmisinterpreted the instruction to include situations in which\nillicit activity was merely incidental to the purpose of the\ninterstate journey.\u201d Id. at 1000. In a number of cases\nfollowing Fox, we hewed closely to the line that the\ngovernment must prove that unlawful sexual conduct was at\nleast a dominant purpose for the travel. See United States v.\nKinslow, 860 F.2d 963, 967 (9th Cir. 1988) (\u201cIn this circuit,\na federal crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423 exists if the immoral\nactivity is \u2018one of the dominant purposes\u2019 of the\ntransportation. It is not necessary, therefore, that the immoral\nactivity be the only purpose of the trip.\u201d (quoting Fox,\n425 F.2d at 999)); United States v. Szymanski, 431 F.2d 946,\n946 (9th Cir. 1970) (\u201ca dominant motive\u201d); Chargois v.\nUnited States, 267 F.2d 410, 412 (9th Cir. 1959) (\u201ca second\ndominant and substantial purpose\u201d).

Lukashov, for the first time, we\nimplicitly approved an instruction that a jury can convict on\nproof that the interstate travel was \u201ca dominant, significant,\nor motivating purpose.\u201d 694 F.3d 1107, 1118 (9th Cir. 2012)\n(emphasis added). Lukashov was a long-distance hauler and,\non the suggestion of his wife, took his eight-year old\nstepdaughter with him across the country, sexually abusing\nher along the way. On appeal, Lukashov did not challenge\nthe jury instructions.5 Instead, he argued that the evidence\nwas insufficient to convict him under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)\nbecause the purpose of the trip was to deliver goods to the\nEast Coast and return to Oregon. Id. at 1118\u201319. We pointed\nout that Lukashov\u2019s claim \u201cignores the human ability and\npropensity to act in light of multiple motives and purposes.\u201d\nId. at 1118. We found the evidence sufficient that \u201ca jury\n\n\n    5\n      Before the district court, Lukashov requested an instruction that the\ngovernment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cone of the\ndominant purposes of defendant\u2019s interstate travel . . . was to engage in a\nsexual act [with his stepdaughter].\u201d Proposed Jury Instructions by\nAlexander Lukashov, Jr, United States v. Lukashov, No. 3:14-cv-00502-\nBR (D. Or. filed June 21, 2010), ECF No. 87. Instead, the district court\ninstructed the jury as follows:\n\n         A person may have different purposes or motives for\n         travel and each may prompt in varying degrees the act\n         of making the journey. For purposes of the First\n         Element,, the government must prove beyond a\n         reasonable doubt that a dominant, significant, or\n         motivating purpose of Defendants across a state line\n         was to engage in a sexual act with [his stepdaughter].\n\nFinal Jury Instructions as to Alexander Lukashov, Jr, United States v.\nLukashov, No. 3:14-cv-00502-BR (D. Or. filed July 27, 2010), ECF\nNo. 139. That jury instruction is, nearly word-for-word, the instruction\napproved by the Third Circuit in Hayward and adopted in Modern Federal\nJury Instructions.\n\f54                UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\ncould rationally infer that Lukashov crossed the\nMontana\u2013North Dakota and subsequent state lines with \u2018a\ndominant, significant, or motivating purpose\u2019 of committing\nadditional sexual acts.\u201d Id. at 1119 (quoting the district court\ninstruction). See also id. (\u201cThat Lukashov also had a\ncommercial purpose for crossing state lines does not negate\nthe inference that he had a significant or motiving purpose to\ncontinue abusing [his stepdaughter] . . . .\u201d). In passing, we\nremarked that the district court \u201ccorrectly instructed the jury,\u201d\nbut we did not recognize the gloss the district court had added\nto our prior cases by including the phrase \u201cmotivating\npurpose.\u201d Id. at 1119.\n\n     Our subtle change in Lukashov reappeared in United\nStates v. Lindsay, 931 F.3d 852 (9th Cir. 2019). Lindsay was\nconvicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b) of traveling to the\nPhilippines, where he had sex with a thirteen-year old girl and\npaid her family money. The district court in his case gave the\njury effectively the same instruction found in Modern Federal\nJury Instructions and that we nominally approved in\nLukashov: \u201cThe government must prove that a dominant,\nsignificant, or motivating purpose of [Lindsay\u2019s] travel in\nforeign commerce was to engage in illicit sexual conduct.\u201d\nId. at 858. Lindsay objected to the jury instruction on appeal,\narguing that the statute required \u201cbut-for causation.\u201d Because\nLindsay failed to object in the trial court, we reviewed for\nplain error.\n\n    \u201cPlain error is error that is \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018obvious.\u2019 Id. at 864\n(emphasis added) (quoting Johnson v. United States 520 U.S.\n461, 467 (1997)). Put another way, \u201cplain error, as we\nunderstand that term, is error that is so clear-cut, so obvious,\na competent district judge should be able to avoid it without\nbenefit of objection.\u201d United States v. Turman, 122 F.3d\n\f                   UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                          55\n\n1167 (9th Cir. 1997), see United States v. Frady, 456 U.S.\n152, 163 (1982) (error is plain only if trial judge is \u201cderelict\nin countenancing it\u201d). Thus, a court may determine that there\nwas no error or that there was error, but it was not clear or\nobvious under current law.6 See, e.g., United States v.\nFerreyro, No. 19-50325, 2021 WL 5414854, at *1 (9th Cir.\n2021) (\u201cBut, even assuming error, Ferreyro cites no authority\nto support that such error was obvious.\u201d); United States v.\nMeza-Casillas, 15 F. App\u2019x 408, 409 (9th Cir. 2001)\n(\u201cAssuming without deciding that either or both arguments\nwould have been well taken, the error, if any, was not \u2018plain.\u2019\nA \u2018plain\u2019 error means an error that \u2018is so clear-cut, so obvious\na competent district court judge should be able to avoid it\nwithout benefit of [any] objection.\u2019 The error here, if any,\ndoes not meet that standard.). Contrary to the majority\u2019s\ncharacterization of Lindsay, we did not hold that the\ninstruction was not erroneous. See Maj. Op. at 20. Rather,\nciting Lukashov, we held that it was \u201cnot obviously wrong\u201d\nand \u201cthe district court did not plainly err by instructing the\njury that Lindsay traveled in foreign commerce for the\npurpose of engaging in illicit sexual activity if that purpose\nwas dominant, significant, or motivating.\u201d Id. at 19\n(emphasis added). Put simply, the district court\u2019s instruction\nin Lindsay may have been erroneous, but not clearly or\nobviously so.\n\n    We are not on plain error review here. If we were, I\nwould not only be compelled to follow Lindsay, but I would\nwillingly follow it. Given the confusion throughout the\nfederal courts, the district court\u2019s instruction here was not\n\n\n\n     6\n       A court may also determine that an error was obvious but did not\naffect substantial rights or prejudice the defendant.\n\f56                   UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nobviously erroneous.7 But Flucas objected repeatedly to the\ninstruction and made clear that he believed that the district\ncourt had reduced the government\u2019s burden. Given the\ngovernment\u2019s change in requested instruction after the first\njury hung, Flucas had every reason to object.\n\n    Our decisions, like those of our sister circuits, are\ninconsistent. Our decision in Fox stated one standard\u2014a\nstandard we followed in many other cases. Lukashov and\nLindsay indirectly approved a different instruction, without\nacknowledging the change in the instruction. Although those\ncases are more recent, neither compels our hand in this case.\nLukashov was a sufficiency-of-the-evidence case in which the\ndefendant apparently conceded the correctness of the\ninstruction. Although we pronounced the instruction correct\nin passing, we did not consider the point raised by Flucas\nhere. So our discussion of the correctness is dicta, at best.\nLindsay was on plain error review.\n\n    The troubling history of the jury instructions in Mann Act\ncases should give us pause and force us to ask: Is there a\ndifference between \u201ca dominant purpose,\u201d \u201ca significant\npurpose,\u201d and \u201ca motivating purpose\u201d? If there is not, then\nwhy have we experimented with so many formulations? I\ntake up these questions in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       The majority takes this long-running confusion as a sign of the\ncorrectness of the instruction. Maj. Op. at 20 (\u201cour holding . . . is\nbolstered by a long line of consistent and uniform cases from our sister\ncircuits.\u201d); see also id. at 33\u201334 & n.10. That is, the instruction is correct\nbecause it is consistent with similar instructions endorsed by many courts\nover a period of decades. But consistency and accuracy are distinct.\nCourts can be consistently wrong.\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                    57\n\n                               II\n\n    People are complex. We are pulled by competing\ninterests, representing people, events, and circumstances.\nSome choices in life are mutually exclusive. We can attend\nthe symphony or go the movies. We can\u2019t do both at the\nsame time. But many times, we can accommodate more than\none interest\u2014we pick up the dry cleaning on our way home\nfrom grocery shopping. We go to the university library to\nbegin research on a term paper, but that is also where our\nfriends are hanging out tonight, and it is quieter than staying\nin the dorm. And we are capable of holding in our minds\nmultiple reasons for our choices. But not every reason is as\nimportant as every other reason. Figuring out what moves us\nis one of the joys and terrors of life. It is also core to\ndetermining mens rea.\n\n                              A\n\n    \u201cDominant,\u201d \u201csignificant,\u201d and \u201cmotivating\u201d are three\nways of expressing different degrees of influence on a\nperson\u2019s decision-making. To my mind, they represent a\nhierarchy of explanations for our decisions. \u201cDominant\u201d\nmeans \u201c[e]xercising chief authority or rule: ruling, governing,\n[or] commanding; most influential\u201d and \u201c[o]ccupying a\ncommanding position.\u201d Dominant, Oxford English Dictionary\n(2d ed. 1989) (emphasis added). This represents the most\ndemanding standard. A dominant purpose would occupy a\ncommanding position in an individual\u2019s decision-making\nprocess. That is, it would be at the forefront of the\nindividual\u2019s mind when making the decision. \u201cSignificant\u201d\nmeans \u201c[s]ufficiently great or important to be worthy of\nattention; noteworthy; consequential, influential\u201d or\n\u201cnoticeable, substantial, considerable, large.\u201d Significant,\n\f58               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nOxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 1989). This is, admittedly,\nnot an obvious or large step down from dominant. But it does\ncapture an important idea\u2014a purpose need not be the\ndominant purpose, but it must bear some significance in our\ndecision. In other words, it should be a dominant purpose,\neven if it is not the dominant purpose.\n\n     By contrast, \u201cmotivate\u201d means \u201c[t]o provide or serve as\na rationale for (some action, etc.); to justify.\u201d Motivate,\nOxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 1989). This conveys little\nsense of comparative weight or importance in the decision-\nmaking process. A factor can play a small role in a person\u2019s\ndecision-making and still motivate them. If we are going to\nthe grocery store because we have no food in the house for\ndinner, stopping at the dry cleaners might be useful if it is on\nthe way; it supplies an additional motive for the trip, even if\nit is not so important as to justify a separate trip. Picking up\nthe dry cleaning provides additional value to the trip to the\nstore. That may help motivate us to go (or to go now, before\nthe dry cleaners closes) without being the dominant or even\na significant reason for leaving the house. If we are not in\nhurry to collect the dry cleaning, it may be entirely incidental\nto our reasons for going out. Even our grocery shopping has\nits own set of priorities. We need milk, bread, and eggs, but\nwe also pick up a frozen pizza and a Midnight Milky Way.\nDoes each of these items motivate us? Are they of equal of\nvalue? Is one or more of the items the dominant reason? A\nsignificant reason?\n\n    I don\u2019t think that \u201cmotivating\u201d can bear the same weight\nas either \u201cdominant\u201d or \u201csignificant.\u201d It may carry such\nweight, but it does not necessarily carry the same weight.\nHere is how we test that.\n\f                     UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                               59\n\n    Following Mortensen, federal courts added to their\ninstructions the caveat that the government did not have to\nprove that crossing state lines for illicit purposes was \u201cthe\ndominant purpose\u201d for the trip; it was sufficient if it was \u201ca\ndominant purpose.\u201d Similarly, it doesn\u2019t do violence to the\nrule to say that the government doesn\u2019t have to prove that\ninterstate travel for illicit purposes was not \u201cthe significant\npurpose,\u201d but only \u201ca significant purpose.\u201d As a matter of\nordinary conversation, it is also easy to see how we\nmight\u2014in our effort to provide more word clues for the\njury\u2014think that the government also does not have to prove\nthat interstate travel was \u201cthe motivating purpose,\u201d but only\n\u201ca motivating purpose.\u201d But here is where those formulations\nbreak down. Once the jury is told that travel must be \u201ca\nmotivating purpose,\u201d it is a short step for the jury to think that\nthe government satisfies its burden if it has proven that\ninterstate travel for illicit purposes was any motivating\npurpose, no matter how insignificant.8 Indeed, \u201cdominant\u201d\nand \u201csignificant\u201d are frequently used as modifiers before\nsome variant of \u201cmotivating\u201d in order to emphasize that not\nany motivation will satisfy the criteria under examination.\nSee, e.g., American Legion v. American Humanist Ass\u2019n,\n139 S. Ct. 2067, 2085 (2019) (\u201cThis is not to say that the\n\n\n    8\n      Instructing the jury that traveling across state lines for illicit sexual\nactivity may not be \u201cmerely incidental\u201d to the trip is not sufficient to\novercome this error. \u201cIncidental\u201d means \u201c[o]ccurring or liable to occur in\nfortuitous or subordinate conjunction with something else of which it\nforms no essential part; casual.\u201d Incidental, Oxford English Dictionary (2d\ned. 1989). Thus, to say that illicit sexual activity may not be \u201cmerely\nincidental\u201d tells the jury that it must have played, at a minimum, some\nminor role beyond fortuity in the decision to make the trip. That\nrepresents a significant departure from the \u201cdominant purpose\u201d test\nexpounded by the Supreme Court in Mortensen and that we adopted in\nFox.\n\f60               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\ncross\u2019s association with the war was the sole or dominant\nmotivation for the inclusion of the symbol in every World\nWar I memorial that features it.\u201d); Pena-Rodriguez v.\nColorado, 137 S. Ct. 855, 867 (2017) (\u201cThe Court must\ndecide whether the Constitution requires an exception to the\nno-impeachment rule when a juror's statements indicate that\nracial animus was a significant motivating factor in his or her\nfinding of guilt.\u201d); Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, 225\n(1971) (\u201cIt is difficult or impossible for any court to\ndetermine the \u2018sole\u2019 or \u2018dominant\u2019 motivation behind the\nchoices of a group of legislators.\u201d).\n\n    The hierarchy of terms I have proposed here is reflected\nin United States v. Generes, 405 U.S. 93 (1972). It is a tax\ncase, and the particulars are not important to us. But the case\n\u201cturn[ed] on the proper measure of the required proximate\nrelation\u201d between a bad debt and the taxpayer\u2019s business. Id.\nat 96. The court had to determine whether \u201cthis necessitate[s]\na \u2018dominant\u2019 business motivation on the part of the taxpayer,\nor is a \u2018significant\u2019 motivation sufficient?\u201d Id. at 96. In\nposing the question, the Court implicitly recognizes that there\nis a distinction between these two terms. Ultimately, the\nCourt held that a proof of a significant motivation is different\nfrom proof of a dominant motivation. \u201cWe conclude that . . .\nthe proper measure is that of dominant motivation, and that\nonly significant motivation is not sufficient.\u201d Id. at 103. By\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning, any \u201cmotivation\u201d is certainly\nan even lower bar than either qualifier that the Court\nconsidered.\n\n   Similarly, in United States v. Miller, a Mann Act case\nfrom the Second Circuit, Miller argued that the Act requires\nproof that criminal sexual activity was \u201cthe dominant\npurpose.\u201d 148 F.3d 207, 211 (2d Cir. 1998). The court\n\f                UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                  61\n\nrejected the argument. In the process, the Second Circuit\nused \u201cmotivation\u201d and \u201cpurpose\u201d interchangeably and\nexplained why one could have more than one dominant\npurpose for an act:\n\n       [I]n everyday speech we can and do describe\n       groups as \u201cdominant.\u201d For example, it makes\n       perfect sense to discuss the \u201cdominant\n       companies\u201d in an industry or the \u201cdominant\n       teams\u201d in a league, and all we mean by\n       describing these companies or teams as\n       \u201cdominant\u201d is that they are relatively more\n       successful or influential than others.\n       Likewise, in the context of multiple purposes,\n       \u201cdominant\u201d simply means that these\n       motivations predominate over other, less\n       powerful motivations for conduct.\n\nId. at 212. If \u201ca motivating purpose\u201d will satisfy the Mann\nAct, we will have no reason to ask the jury whether \u201cthese\nmotivations predominate over other less powerful\nmotivations for conduct\u201d\u2014because any motivating purpose\nwill do.\n\n                             B\n\n    This analysis is confirmed in the 2018 amendments to the\ncurrent version of the Mann Act. The 2018 amendment to\nSection 2423(b) makes clear what the dictionary definitions\nsuggest\u2014\u201cmotivating\u201d is a lesser standard than \u201cdominant\u201d\nor \u201csignificant.\u201d Section 2423, a derivative of Section 4 of\nthe Mann Act, provides harsh penalties for transporting\nminors to engage in illicit sexual activity. Compare\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421(a) (providing for sentences of \u201cnot more\n\f62                  UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nthan 10 years\u201d) with id. \u00a7 2423(a) (providing for sentence of\n\u201cnot less than 10 years or for life\u201d); id. 2423(b) (providing for\nsentence of \u201cnot more than 30 years).9 Prior to 2018,\n\u00a7 2423(b) made it a crime for \u201c[a] person [to] travel[] in\ninterstate commerce or travel[] into the United States . . . for\nthe purpose of engaging in any illicit sexual conduct.\u201d In\n2018, Congress amended \u00a7 2423(b) to make one small\nchange. The current version of \u00a7 2423(b) reads, \u201cA person\nwho travels in interstate commerce or travels into the United\nStates . . . with a motivating purpose of engaging in any illicit\nsexual conduct with another person . . . .\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423\n(emphasis added). \u201cWith a motivating purpose,\u201d replaced\n\u201cfor the purpose of\u201d in the prior iteration of the statute.\nCritically, Congress did not amend any other sections of the\nMann Act, including the two provisions under which Flucas\nwas convicted\u2014\u00a7\u00a7 2421(a), 2423(a). Prior to the 2018\namendment, most federal courts had treated \u00a7 2423(b) similar\nto \u00a7\u00a7 2421(a) and 2423(a) and had used \u201cdominant\u201d and\n\u201csignificant\u201d as the qualifiers for \u201cpurpose.\u201d See Schneider,\n801 F.3d at 194; McGuire, 627 F.3d at 624\u201325; Vang,\n128 F.3d at 1072\u201373; but see United States v. Garcia-Lopez,\n234 F.3d 217, 219\u201320 (5th Cir. 2000) (holding it was not\nerror for the district court to refuse to give \u201ca significant or\ndominant purpose\u201d instruction and instead instruct that it was\n\u201cenough if one of the defendant\u2019s motives in traveling in\nforeign commerce was to engage in a sexual act with a\nminor\u201d).\n\n     9\n      Section 2423 applies to crimes involving minors. Section 2423(a),\nwhich has language nearly identical to 2421(a), punishes persons who\ntransport minors \u201cwith intent that the individual engage in engage in\nprostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense.\u201d Section 2423(b) punishes person who travel to\nengage in illicit sexual conduct. Section 2423(b) does not require that the\ndefendant have transported anyone.\n\f                      UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                               63\n\n    Why did Congress tinker with the language? The statute\nwas amended as part of the Abolish Human Trafficking Act\nof 2017 to make it easier to convict sex tourists. While\n\u00a7\u00a7 2421(a) and 2423(a) punish those who transport persons\nfor illicit sex, \u00a7 2423(b) punishes those who travel for illicit\nsex. As a legislative summary explained: \u201cIn order to help\ncurb foreign offenders and internal [sic] human trafficking,\nthe legislation clarifies that persons who travel overseas with\na motivating purpose of engaging in illicit sex tourism can be\nfederally prosecuted for their offense.\u201d Cornyn, Klobuchar\nBill to Fight Human Trafficking Signed into Law, East\nTexas Review (Dec. 22, 2018) (emphasis added),\nhttps://easttexasreview.com/cornyn-klobuchar-bill-fight-hu\nman-trafficking-passes-senate/. Congress\u2019s concern with sex\ntourism is understandable in context. Whereas \u00a7\u00a7 2421(a)\nand 2423(a) punish one who \u201cknowingly transports\u201d a victim\nacross state lines for a particular purpose\u2014a deliberate act\ninvolving at least two people\u2014\u00a7 2423(b) punishes mere\n\u201ctravel\u201d across a border with bad intent. It makes sense for\nCongress to try to reach a sex tourist who comes to the United\nStates with mixed motives\u2014to see the Empire State Building\nand the Grand Canyon and also to have illicit sex. In that\nsituation, Congress might well try the outer boundaries of its\nauthority to punish any \u201cmotivating purpose\u201d for travelers,\nbut be satisfied with the historic limits\u2014a \u201cdominant\u201d or\n\u201csignificant\u201d purpose\u2014when it comes to persons who\nknowingly transport others for immoral purposes.10 By\n\n     10\n         Section 2423(c) has lowered the bar to prosecution even more. It\nmakes it illegal to travel in foreign commerce \u201cand engage[] in any illegal\nsexual conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(c). No proof of intent or motive is\nrequired; it is a strict liability statute. United States v. Pepe, 895 F.3d 679,\n688 n.4 (9th Cir. 2018) (\u201c[Section] 2423(c) doesn\u2019t itself require a mens\nrea . . . .\u201d). See Sex Tourism Prohibition Improvement Act of 2002, H.R.\nRep. No. 107-525, at 3 (The bill \u201celiminates the intent requirement\u201d), 5\n\f64                  UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nmaking \u201cmotivating purpose\u201d the standard in \u00a7 2423(b),\nCongress lowered the government\u2019s burden of proof for\nconviction. The 2018 amendment removes any possibility\nthat a jury may acquit if the defendant\u2019s purpose was not a\ndominant or significant one. By not amending \u00a7\u00a72421(a) and\n2423(a) at the same time, Congress left the higher burden of\nproof in place.\n\n                                    III\n\n    My concerns are not mere classroom hypotheticals.\nWhen the district court added that word \u201cmotivating\u201d to the\njury instruction, it lowered the government\u2019s burden of proof.\nAt Flucas\u2019s second trial, the jury was told that it was\nsufficient if the government has proven that \u201cthe sexual\nactivity was a significant, dominant, or motivating purpose\u201d\nfor Flucas\u2019s move to California. We should not be surprised\nthat the jury thought that it could convict Flucas if the sexual\nactivity was \u201cany motivating purpose\u201d for his travel from\nOregon to California. That is a clear departure from the\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision in Mortensen.\n\n    The district court\u2019s decision to add \u201cor motivating\u201d to the\ninstruction plainly was a critical change from the first trial to\nthe second. The government didn\u2019t request it idly, and\nFlucas\u2019s counsel promptly objected and identified the\n\n\n\n\n(2002). I note that the 2002 bill did not pass, but it became the basis for\nlater amendments. See Sara Sun Beale, Prosecuting Sexual Exploitation\nand Trafficking Abroad: Congress, the Courts, and the Constitution,\n27 Duke J. Gender L. & Pol\u2019y 25, 26\u201327, 27 n.12 (2020).\n\f                    UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                            65\n\nproblem for the district court.11 When the second jury was\ntold it could find Flucas guilty if \u201cthe [illegal] sexual activity\nwas a significant, dominant, or motivating purpose,\u201d only one\nof those needed be true to convict because the instruction was\nphrased in the disjunctive. That gave the jury a choice of\nstandards, and we must assume that it chose the common\ndenominator\u2014\u201cmotivating\u201d\u2014because satisfying that\nstandard would automatically satisfy the higher standards of\n\u201cdominant\u201d and \u201csignificant.\u201d12 The instruction thus\nimproperly lowered the bar from the required intent\u2014a\ndominant or significant purpose.\n\n    That reduced standard could have made a difference here,\none that we cannot conclude was harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt. See McDonnell v. United States, 136 S. Ct.\n2355, 2375 (2016); Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24\n(1967). The evidence in this case must have been difficult to\nhear. Flucas testified at trial and he admitted to having sex\n\n\n    11\n       Counsel for Flucas explained his objection to the district court: \u201cI\nthink significant and dominant are equal. Motivating is lower. And\nincidental is even lower than that. So I think that motivating is\u2014just\nmeans something totally different than significant or dominant.\u201d He\nadvised the court that \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cdominant\u201d had been approved in\nprior cases, \u201cbut the motivating is a new\u2014a new word put in there.\u201d\n    12\n       The majority refers to my point as a \u201cspeculative assertion.\u201d Maj.\nOp. 13 n.6. I am not sure why that is significant. We never know what\nthe basis for a jury\u2019s decision is. We assume that juries follow their\ninstructions. United States v. Mitchell, 502 F.3d 931, 990 (9th Cir. 2007).\n\u201cWe cannot know what this jury did behind closed doors. The standard\nthe jury applied can only be gleaned from examining what the jury was\ntold.\u201d Chalmers v. Mitchell, 73 F.3d 1262, 1267 (2d Cir. 1996). Flucas\u2019s\njury was provided with a disjunctive, and one of the alternatives is\nerroneous. We have to assume that the jury followed the district court\u2019s\ninstruction and decided on the basis of the bad instruction.\n\f66               UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nwith at least one of his daughters and a stepdaughter and\nfathering children by them. There was also very strong\nevidence that Flucas had repeatedly had sex with his\ndaughters and others over a long period, including his time in\nGeorgia, his stay in Oregon, and after his move to California.\nAnd the government elicited from Flucas that he knew what\nhe had done was wrong and that he had considered fleeing the\ncountry. But the evidence that illicit sexual conduct with his\ndaughters and other young women was a dominant or\nsignificant reason Flucas moved his family from Oregon to\nCalifornia was flimsy. Flucas was settled in Klamath Falls,\nOregon, where he had a job with the school district that\nworked out to about $18 per hour. In addition to his salary,\nhe received another $10,000 to compensate him for his\nmileage. Flucas had asked the Klamath school district for\nmore money, but the district told him there would be no bump\nin salary and that it planned to reduce his mileage\ncompensation. In the meantime, the Stockton Unified School\nDistrict made him a better offer, one that would work out to\nabout $31 per hour, plus compensation for his mileage. It\nwould be more money for fewer hours. In addition, the\nschool district offered his wife a salaried position as well,\nalso working with hearing-impaired students.\n\n    So why did Flucas move to California? To take a new\njob, as the defense argued? Or to continue to sexually abuse\nhis children, as the government claimed? The choices are not\nmutually exclusive, but they do require some assessment of\nthe relative weight of Flucas\u2019s motives for accepting a new\nteaching position and moving his family. But without\nconsidering the relative weight of his reasons for moving, the\njury may be very tempted to punish Flucas because (1) he\ncrossed a state line and (2) he was a serial sexual abuser. But\ntraveling across a state line while a serial sex abuser is not\n\f                 UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS                    67\n\nsufficient for a conviction under the Mann Act. Being a serial\nsexual abuser describes one\u2019s status, not a purpose for\ncrossing a state line. There is a serious doubt that Flucas\ncrossed the Oregon-California border with his family and\nmoving truck as \u201ccalculated means for effectuating sexual\nimmorality.\u201d Mortensen, 332 U.S. at 375.\n\n                           ****\n\n    One final, broader observation. The Mann Act is a\nparasitic act because it depends on violations of the laws of\nnon-federal jurisdictions. The Act punishes \u201cany sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal\noffense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421(a). Sex crimes are traditionally\ndefined by state law. That means that the interstate\ntransportation element is the only thing that narrows the\nMann Act; otherwise, federal law would be at least\ncoextensive with state law. This should concern us. \u201c[G]iven\nthe structure of our federal criminal justice system, we would\nexpect that state laws criminalizing sexual activity with\nminors would encompass a broader range of conduct than\nfederal laws.\u201d United States v. McCauley, 983 F.3d 690, 696\n(4th Cir. 2020). We should hesitate long before we attribute\nto Congress an exercise of power to displace the states in this\ntraditional area of state control. See United States v. Lopez,\n514 U.S. 549, 564 (1995) (warning that the \u201cimplications of\nthe Government\u2019s arguments\u201d make it \u201cdifficult to perceive\nany limitation on federal power . . . in areas such as criminal\nlaw enforcement . . . where States historically have been\nsovereign.\u201d). \u201cWhen charged conduct does not fall in the\nheartland of [the Mann Act\u2019s] proscription, the risk of\nprejudice becomes more palpable.\u201d McCauley, 983 F.3d\nat 698. This is not to say that Flucas\u2019s \u201cconduct was in any\nway excusable or beyond the reach of the criminal law. It is\n\f68                UNITED STATES V. FLUCAS\n\nsimply that it is quite possible that properly instructed the\njury would find this defendant\u2019s conduct falls outside\u201d of\nfederal criminal jurisdiction. Id.\n\n                               IV\n\n    I would reverse the judgment of conviction and remand\nto the district court with instructions that if the government\nwishes to retry Flucas, the jury must be instructed that his\ncontinued illicit sexual conduct was one of the dominant or\nsignificant purposes for moving his family from Oregon to\nCalifornia.\n\n     For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\f",
