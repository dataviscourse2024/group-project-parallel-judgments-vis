In re Iso Hodzic, Talia Seimanjin, Samra Hodzic, and Braho Hodzic, Nos. A95 462 647, A95 462 648, A95 462 649, A95 462 650 (B.I.A. July 23, 2004) aff'g Nos. A95 462 647, A95 462 648, *74A95 462 649, A95 462 650 (Immigr. Ct. New York City June 10, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.\nWhen the IJ\u2019s decision rests on alternative grounds and the BIA adopts and affirms that decision without expressly addressing each ground, this Court may review the entire IJ decision and need not confine its review to the grounds expressly addressed by the BIA. Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, 435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, 386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). It reviews de novo the IJ\u2019s findings concerning the legal sufficiency of the evidence, as they present questions regarding the application of law to fact. Edimo-Doualla v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 276, 281 (2d Cir.2006).\nThe IJ\u2019s determination that Hodzic was not eligible for relief based on the rape of his wife is dispositive. Hodzic\u2019s brief argues that the IJ erred in holding that the rape could not be considered in determining whether Hodzic had suffered past persecution. Hodzic cites Matter of C-Y-Z- 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 915, 919 (BIA 1997), and various cases from other circuit courts indicating that persecution of family members could be taken into consideration when analyzing whether an applicant had suffered past persecution.\nHodzic\u2019s case is easily distinguished from C-Y-Z-, which discusses the ability of a person whose spouse has been forced to undergo an abortion or sterilization procedure to establish his own claim of past persecution on account of a political opinion.\nHodzic also cites to a Ninth Circuit case, Lin v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 1014 (9th Cir. 2004), arguing that the court implied that the BIA\u2019s holding in C-Y-Z- should be extended to persecution committed against other close family members. Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 49. However, Lin held that the applicant could establish a well-founded fear on account of his membership in a social group said to be composed of his immediate family, which the Chinese government had singled out under the family planning laws. 377 F.3d at 1029. Because the Lin Court was analyzing the \u201con account of\u2019 element of an asylum claim, and not the harm element, Hodzic\u2019s second argument is also unavailing.\nHodzic\u2019s case is also distinguishable from the Sixth Circuit case he cites, Abay v. Ashcroft, 368 F.3d 634 (6th Cir.2004). Abay noted that the BIA and other circuits had \u201csuggested] a governing principle in favor of refugee status in cases where a parent and protector is faced with exposing her child to the clear risk of being subjected against her will to a practice that is a form of physical torture causing grave and permanent harm.\u201d Abay, 368 F.3d at 642. Because that case focused on the particular protective relationship between a parent and child, Hod-zic\u2019s argument that the principle should apply to him and his wife is without merit.\nThe agency correctly concluded that Hodzic did not suffer past persecution. In Matter of Acosta, 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985), the BIA interpreted past persecution to include \u201charm or suffering inflicted upon an individual in order to punish him for possessing a belief or characteristic a persecutor sought to overcome.\u201d Such harm must be severe. Ai Feng Yuan v. DOJ, 416 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir.2005) (citing Ghaly v. INS, 58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cpersecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society re*75gards as offensive\u201d)). Persecution must rise above mere harassment, but it is not limited to threats to life or freedom; non-life-threatening violence and physical abuse also fall within this category. Tian Yong Chen v. INS, 359 F.3d 121, 128 (2d Cir.2004). When determining whether an applicant has demonstrated persecution, the events are viewed cumulatively. See Poradisova v. Gonzales, 420 F.3d 70, 79-80 (2d Cir.2005).\nHodzic cites the rape of his wife as the most serious act of persecution against his family. In addition, he claimed that he was arrested, detained for 36 hours, and beaten in March 1999, and that he was hit with a stick three or four times on the upper arm. Here, the agency reasonably determined that Hodzic\u2019s brief detention, which did not result in severe or lasting harm, was not an independent basis on which he could claim past persecution. See Tian-Yong Chen, 359 F.3d at 128.\nThe agency\u2019s conclusion that Hodzic failed to establish his eligibility for asylum was thus supported, and a review of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is unnecessary.\nBecause Hodzic was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, 344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). Moreover, because Hodzic presented no additional evidence indicating that he would likely be tortured upon return to Montenegro, the IJ appropriately determined that he did not establish his eligibility for CAT relief.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).\n",
