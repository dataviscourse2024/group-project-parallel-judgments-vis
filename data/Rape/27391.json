MICHAEL D. DYER v. THE STATE.\n\n      Michael D. Dyer has filed numerous applications in this Court based on his\nguilty plea to two counts of aggravated child molestation in 2007.1 In his latest\nattempt to overturn his convictions, Dyer filed this pro se application for discretionary\nreview on September 1, 2020, seeking to appeal from two orders entered on July 17,\n2020: one denied his pro se motion for an out-of-time appeal, and the other dismissed\nhis pro se motion to set aside based on OCGA \u00a7 9-11-60. We lack jurisdiction.\n      First, we lack jurisdiction because, pretermitting whether Dyer has a right to\ndirectly appeal the trial court\u2019s order denying his motion for an out-of-time appeal,2\nhis application is untimely. To be timely, an application must be filed within 30 days\nof entry of the order to be appealed. See OCGA \u00a7 5-6-35 (d). Here, Dyer filed his\napplication 46 days after entry of the orders he seeks to appeal. His application is\ntherefore untimely and subject to dismissal. See Crosson v. Conway, 291 Ga. 220,\n\n\n      1\n       See Case Nos. A14D0474 (dismissed Aug. 19, 2014); A16D0422 (denied July\n14, 2016); and A19D0054 (denied Sept. 6, 2018).\n      2\n        The denial of a motion for an out-of-time appeal is directly appealable when\nthe conviction at issue has not been the subject of a direct appeal. See English v.\nState, 307 Ga. App. 544, 545 n.4 (705 SE2d 667) (2010); Lunsford v. State, 237 Ga.\nApp. 696, 696 (515 SE2d 198) (1999). Generally, if a party applies for discretionary\nreview of a directly appealable order, this Court grants the application under OCGA\n\u00a7 5-6-35 (j). To fall within this general rule, however, the application must be filed\nwithin 30 days of entry of the order to be appealed. See OCGA \u00a7 5-6-35 (d); Hill v.\nState, 204 Ga. App. 582, 582 (420 SE2d 393) (1992).\n\f220 (1) (728 SE2d 617) (2012); see also Boyle v. State, 190 Ga. App. 734, 734 (380\nSE2d 57) (1989) (\u201cThe requirements of OCGA \u00a7 5-6-35 are jurisdictional and this\n[C]ourt cannot accept an appeal not made in compliance therewith.\u201d).\n      Second, \u201c[i]t has been held many times that a motion to set aside a judgment\nis inappropriate in a criminal case.\u201d Lacey v. State, 253 Ga. 711, 711 (324 SE2d 471)\n(1985). Regardless of how it is styled, a motion seeking to challenge an allegedly\ninvalid or void judgment of conviction \u201cis not one of the established procedures for\nchallenging the validity of a judgment in a criminal case.\u201d Roberts v. State, 286 Ga.\n532, 532 (690 SE2d 150) (2010). Because Dyer is not authorized to collaterally attack\nhis conviction in this manner, there is nothing for this Court to review and an\napplication or direct appeal is subject to dismissal. See id.\n      For these reasons, this application is hereby DISMISSED.\n\n                                        Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia\n                                               Clerk\u2019s Office, Atlanta,____________________\n                                                                         09/21/2020\n                                               I certify that the above is a true extract from\n                                        the minutes of the Court of Appeals of Georgia.\n                                                Witness my signature and the seal of said court\n                                        hereto affixed the day and year last above written.\n\n\n                                             , Clerk.\n\f",
