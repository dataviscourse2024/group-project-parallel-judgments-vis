After our review, we\n\naffirm.\n\n        On October 28, 2009, Hesley pled nolo contendere to one count of rape\n\nof a child, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121(c), following disclosure of the fact he had been\n\nsexually abusing his paramour\u2019s prepubescent son for nearly two years. On\n\nFebruary 19, 2010, following a hearing, the court determined Hesley was a\n\nsexually violent predator (SVP) and, on February 26, 2010, the court\n\nsentenced Hesley to 8 to 16 years\u2019 imprisonment.         Hesley filed a motion for\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n*   Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-S50009-19\n\n\n\nreconsideration with respect to the SVP designation, which the court denied\n\non April 14, 2010. Hesley did not file a direct appeal.\n\n        On September 4, 2010, Hesley filed a pro se PCRA petition challenging,\n\namong other things, his SVP status. Hesley filed an amended PCRA petition\n\nwith the assistance of court appointed counsel on March 8, 2011. On July 28,\n\n2011, Hesley\u2019s attorney filed a second amended PCRA petition.       The court\n\nultimately denied Hesley\u2019s PCRA petition on November 5, 2012, and, on June\n\n12, 2013, this Court vacated the order denying PCRA relief and remanded with\n\ninstructions to reinstate his right to appeal his judgment of sentence nunc pro\n\ntunc.    Commonwealth v. Hesley, No. 1919 WDA 2012, at 1-2 (Pa. Super.,\n\nfiled June 12, 2013) (unpublished memorandum).\n\n        Hesley filed a notice of appeal nunc pro tunc on December 13, 2013,\n\nchallenging the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the SVP\n\ndetermination. This Court affirmed. Commonwealth v. Hesley, No. 116\n\nWDA 2014, (Pa. Super., filed August 22, 2014) (unpublished memorandum).\n\nHesley did not seek review in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\n\n        On August 20, 2018, Hesley filed the instant PCRA petition. The court\n\nappointed counsel and, on September 12, 2018, the PCRA court notified\n\nHesley of its intention to dismiss the petition without a hearing, pursuant to\n\nPa.R.Crim.P. 907.     Hesley filed an amended petition on October 2, 2018,\n\nchallenging his SVP status in light of Commonwealth v. Muniz, 164 A.3d\n\n1189 (Pa. 2017) and Commonwealth v. Butler, 173 A.3d 1212 (Pa. Super.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fJ-S50009-19\n\n\n\n2017).    The PCRA court dismissed Hesley\u2019s petition as untimely. Hesley filed\n\na timely appeal. He raises one issue for our review:\n\n      Whether the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing\n      [Hesley\u2019s] PCRA petition and petition to correct illegal sentence\n      (finding of being a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d) without a hearing\n      as [Hesley\u2019s] classification as a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d was\n      done so under a statute that was ruled unconstitutional by\n      Commonwealth v. Butler, 173 A.3d 121 (Pa. Super. 2017)?\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief, at 5.\n\n      In reviewing the propriety of a trial court\u2019s dismissal of a PCRA petition,\n\nwe are limited to determining whether the record supports the court\u2019s findings\n\nand whether the order in question is free of legal error. See Commonwealth\n\nv. Halley, 870 A.2d 795, 799 n.2 (Pa. 2005). The PCRA court\u2019s findings will\n\nnot be disturbed unless there is no support for the findings in the certified\n\nrecord.   See Commonwealth v. Carr, 768 A.2d 1164, 1166 (Pa. Super.\n\n2001).    In this case, the PCRA court concluded that Hesley\u2019s petition was\n\nuntimely and that no exceptions to the PCRA time-bar applied.            For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we agree.\n\n      A PCRA petition must be filed within one year of the date that the\n\njudgment of sentence becomes final. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9545(b)(1). This time\n\nrequirement is mandatory and jurisdictional in nature, and the court may not\n\nignore it in order to reach the merits of the petition.    Commonwealth v.\n\nMurray, 753 A.2d 201, 203 (Pa. 2000).          \u201cThus, [i]f a PCRA petition is\n\nuntimely, neither this Court nor the trial court has jurisdiction over the\n\npetition. Without jurisdiction, we simply do not have the legal authority to\n\n                                      -3-\n\fJ-S50009-19\n\n\n\naddress the substantive claims.\u201d          Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 994 A.2d\n\n1091, 1093 (Pa. 2010) (quoting Commonwealth v. Chester, 895 A.2d 520,\n\n522 (Pa. 2006) (citations omitted)). A judgment of sentence \u201cbecomes final\n\nat the conclusion of direct review, including discretionary review in the\n\nSupreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,\n\nor at the expiration of time for seeking the review.\u201d              42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\n\n9545(b)(3).\n\n        Here, Hesley\u2019s judgment of sentence became final on September 22,\n\n2014, thirty days after the expiration of the time for filing a discretionary\n\nappeal in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9545(b)(3);\n\nPa.R.A.P. 1113. Thus, in order to be timely, Hesley\u2019s petition would have had\n\nto have been filed by September 22, 2015.           The instant petition, filed on\n\nAugust 20, 2018, is, therefore, patently untimely. Moreover, Hesley has failed\n\nto establish that one of the enumerated exceptions, set forth at 42 Pa.C.S.A.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii), applies.1\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1   The exceptions to the timeliness requirement are:\n\n        (i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of\n        interference by government officials with the presentation of the\n        claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth\n        or the Constitution or laws of the United States;\n\n        (ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to\n        the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise\n        of due diligence; or\n\n        (iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was recognized\n        by the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme Court\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fJ-S50009-19\n\n\n\n       A petition invoking one of these exceptions must be filed within one year\n\nof the date the claim could first have been presented.         42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\n\n9545(b)(2).2 Here, Hesley asserts the exception to the PCRA\u2019s timeliness\n\nrequirement for a newly-recognized constitutional right, invoking our Supreme\n\nCourt\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Muniz, 164 A.3d 1189 (Pa. 2017),\n\nand this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Butler, 173 A.3d 1212 (Pa.\n\nSuper. 2017), appeal granted, 190 A.3d 581 (Pa. 2018).\n\n       In Muniz, our Supreme Court held that retroactive application of the\n\nregistration and reporting requirements of the Pennsylvania Sex Offender\n\nRegistration and Notification Act (\u201cSORNA\u201d), 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 9799.10\u2013\n____________________________________________\n\n\n       of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in this section and\n       has been held by that court to apply retroactively.\n\n\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii).\n\n2 On October 24, 2018, the General Assembly amended section 9545(b)(2),\nextending the time for filing a petition from 60 days to one year from the date\nthe claim could have been presented. See 2018 Pa. Legis. Serv. Act 2018-\n146 (S.B. 915), effective December 24, 2018. The amendment applies only\nto claims arising one year before the effective date of this section, December\n24, 2017, or thereafter. Hesley\u2019s claim relies on Commonwealth v. Muniz,\n164 A.3d 1189 (Pa. 2017), which was filed on July 19, 2017. Hesley\u2019s petition\nwas filed on August 21, 2018, beyond the one-year time limit. To the extent\nthat Hesley\u2019s relies on Commonwealth v. Butler, 173 A.3d 1212 (Pa. Super.\n2017), appeal granted, 190 A.3d 581 (Pa. 2018), which was filed on October\n31, 2017, to meet the one-year time period, we point out that Butler is a\ndecision by this Court, not the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and it cannot be\nrelied upon to establish the newly-recognized constitutional right exception.\nSee Commonwealth v. Brandon, 51 A.3d 231 (Pa. Super. 2012) (holding\nthat language of section 9545(b)(1)(iii) does not contemplate that decision of\nSuperior Court may provide basis for exception to PCRA\u2019s time bar).\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fJ-S50009-19\n\n\n\n9799.41, violated the ex post facto clauses of the United States and\n\nPennsylvania Constitutions. Muniz, 164 A.3d at 1223. On October 31, 2017,\n\nthis Court decided Butler and held in light of our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\n\nMuniz, \u201csection 9799.24(e)(3) of SORNA [involving SVP designation] violates\n\nthe federal and state constitutions because it increases the criminal penalty\n\nto which a defendant is exposed without the chosen fact-finder making the\n\nnecessary factual findings beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Butler, 173 A.3d at\n\n1218. We point out, however, that Hesley was determined to be an SVP on\n\nFebruary 19, 2010, pursuant to Megan\u2019s Law III.3 The holding in Butler does\n\nnot apply to SVP findings made pursuant to Megan\u2019s Law, nor have our\n\nappellate courts held that Butler may be applied retroactively to pre-SORNA\n\nSVP designations.\n\n        To the extent Hesley\u2019s claim implicates the timeliness exception of\n\nsubsection 9545(b)(1)(iii), that the decisions in Muniz and Butler satisfy the\n\nnewly-recognized constitutional right exception, such reliance would not\n\nsatisfy the timeliness exception. As this Court held in Commonwealth v.\n\nMurphy, 180 A.3d 402 (Pa. Super. 2018):\n\n        [W]e acknowledge that this Court has declared that \u201cMuniz\n        created a substantive rule that retroactively applies in the\n        collateral context.\u201d Commonwealth v. Rivera-Figueroa, 174\n        A.3d 674, 678 (Pa. Super. 2017). However, because [the\n        petitioner\u2019s] PCRA petition is untimely (unlike the petition at issue\n        in Rivera-Figueroa), he must demonstrate that the Pennsylvania\n        Supreme Court has held that Muniz applies retroactively in order\n        to satisfy [sub]section 9545(b)(1)(iii). Because at this time, no\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3   SORNA took effect on December 20, 2012.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fJ-S50009-19\n\n\n       such holding has been issued by our Supreme Court, [the\n       petitioner] cannot rely on Muniz to meet th[e third] timeliness\n       exception.\n\nMurphy, 180 A.3d at 405-406 (citation omitted). In other words, this Court\n\nconcluded that the holding in Muniz does not apply at this point to untimely-\n\nfiled PCRA petitions. Additionally, our Supreme Court has not held that our\n\ndecision in Butler applies retroactively, even if Butler could be construed as\n\ncreating a new constitutional right.4\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we conclude Hesley\u2019s instant PCRA petition\n\nwas untimely filed, and he has not pled and proven an exception to the PCRA\n\ntime requirement. Thus, he is not entitled to relief.\n\n       Order affirmed.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D. Seletyn, Esq.\nProthonotary\n\n\n\nDate: 9/20/2019\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n4 On July 31, 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted allowance of\nappeal in Butler. If the Supreme Court issues a decision holding that Butler\napplies retroactively, Hesley may file another PCRA petition within one year of\nthat decision, attempting to invoke a time-bar exception in subsection\n9545(b)(1)(iii). See Act 2018, Oct. 24, P.L. 894, No. 146, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 (recent\namendment to the PCRA Act); see also Commonwealth v. Murphy, 180\nA.3d 402, 406 n.1 (Pa.
