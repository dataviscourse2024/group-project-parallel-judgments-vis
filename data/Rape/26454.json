Duffy, filed this appeal from the Superior\n\nCourt's denial of his first motion for postconviction relief under Superior Court\n\nCriminal Rule 61.1 The State of Delaware has filed a motion to affirm the judgment\n\nbelow on the ground that it is manifest on the face of Duffy's opening brief that his\n\nappeal is without merit. We agree and affirm.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    State v. Duffy, 2018 WL 4002244 (Del. Super. Ct. Aug. 15, 2018).\n\f       (2)      In September 2017, Duffy was indicted for Violation of Privacy under\n\n11 Del. C. \u00a7 1335(a)(7). The charges arose from Duffy taking photographs of a store\n\ncustomer on September 9, 2017.          In November 2017, Duffy was charged by\n\nsuperseding indictment with Violation of Privacy under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1335(a)(7), two\n\ncounts of Attempted Violation of Privacy under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 1335(a)(7), and\n\nTampering with Physical Evidence. These charges arose from the same September\n\n9th incident.\n\n       (3)      On January 12, 2018, Duffy pled guilty to Violation of Privacy. As part\n\nof the plea agreement, Duffy agreed that he was a habitual offender based in part on\n\nrape convictions in the 1970s and 1980s. The State agreed to recommend no more\n\nthan seven years of Level V incarceration and to dismiss the other charges. The\n\nSuperior Court granted the State\u2019s petition to declare Duffy a habitual offender under\n\n11 Del. C.\u00a7 4214(a). On April 13, 2018, the Superior Court sentenced Duffy, as a\n\nhabitual offender under \u00a7 4214(a), to six years of Level V incarceration with credit\n\nfor 217 days previously served. Duffy filed a notice of appeal and then withdrew\n\nthe appeal.\n\n       (4)      On July 12, 2018, Duffy filed a timely motion for postconviction relief\n\nunder Superior Court Criminal Rule 61. Duffy argued that: (i) his Miranda rights\n\nwere violated; (ii) his counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue the Miranda\n\nclaim, not thoroughly reviewing video of the incident, and not interviewing the\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\fvictim or having the victim appear in court; (iii) the arresting officer made false\n\nstatements; (iv) the original charge of misdemeanor sexual harassment was\n\nwrongfully increased to a non-violent Class G felony; (v) he could not be sentenced\n\nas a habitual offender for Violation of Privacy because it is a non-violent Class G\n\nfelony; (vi) there was no video evidence; (vii) there were no case reviews; (viii) there\n\nwas prosecutorial misconduct; (ix) and he should have been sentenced under the pre-\n\nTruth-in-Sentencing law because at the time of his new crime he was on parole for\n\na pre-Truth-in-Sentencing crime. Duffy also filed a motion for appointment of\n\ncounsel.\n\n         (5)    The Superior Court denied the motions, finding that most of Duffy\u2019s\n\nclaims were barred by Rule 61(i)(3) and his knowing and voluntary guilty plea. The\n\nSuperior Court also held that Duffy failed to show his counsel was ineffective. This\n\nappeal followed. In addition to the claims he raised below, Duffy argues that he was\n\nentitled to the appointment of counsel and that the Rule 61 procedural bars are\n\ninapplicable because he produced new evidence that creates a strong inference he is\n\nactually innocent.\n\n         (6)    This Court reviews the Superior Court\u2019s denial of postconviction relief\n\nfor abuse of discretion and questions of law de novo.2 The Court must consider the\n\n\n\n\n2\n    Dawson v. State, 673 A.2d 1186, 1190 (Del. 1996).\n\n\n                                                3\n\fprocedural requirements of Rule 61 before addressing any substantive issues.3 Rule\n\n61(i)(3) provides that any ground for relief that was not asserted in the proceedings\n\nleading to the judgment of conviction is thereafter barred unless the defendant can\n\nestablish cause for relief from the procedural default and prejudice from a violation\n\nof the defendant's rights. To establish cause, the movant must demonstrate that an\n\nexternal impediment prevented him from raising the claim earlier.4                  To establish\n\nprejudice, the movant must show actual prejudice resulting from the alleged error.5\n\n       (7)     As the Superior Court recognized, Rule 61(i)(3) did not apply to\n\nDuffy\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims, but did bar his remaining claims.\n\nDuffy did not raise these claims on direct appeal of his conviction. He did not\n\nattempt to establish cause for relief from the procedural default or actual prejudice.\n\nAs to Duffy\u2019s claim that Rule 61(i)(3) is inapplicable because he produced new\n\nevidence that creates a strong inference he is actually innocent,6 he seems to rely on\n\nthe store video footage that the police reviewed before his arrest and his contention\n\nthat the victim was wearing shorts rather than a skirt. This is not new evidence that\n\ncreates a strong inference he is actually innocent of Violation of Privacy under 11\n\n\n3\n  Younger v. State, 580 A.2d 552, 554 (Del. 1990).\n4\n  Id. at 556.\n5\n  Id.\n6\n  Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(d)(2)(i) (providing defendant must \u201cplead with particularity that new\nevidence exists that creates a strong inference that the movant is actually innocent in fact of the\nacts underlying the charges of which he was convicted\u201d); Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(i)(5) (providing\nthat Rule 61(i)(3) bar does not apply to claim that satisfies the pleading requirement of Rule\n61(d)(2)(i)).\n\n\n                                                4\n\fDel. C. \u00a7 1335(a)(7), which provides that a person is guilty if they \u201c[s]ecretly or\n\nsurreptitiously videotape[], film[], photograph[] or otherwise record[] another\n\nperson under or through that person\u2019s clothing for the purpose of viewing the body\n\nof or the undergarments worn by that other person.\u201d\n\n         (8)     As the Superior Court also recognized, a defendant who enters a\n\nknowing, intelligent, and voluntary guilty plea waives his right to challenge errors\n\noccurring before the entry of the plea.7 The record reflects that Duffy entered a\n\nknowing, intelligent, and voluntary guilty plea. In the Truth-in-Sentencing Guilty\n\nPlea Form, Duffy indicated that he freely and voluntarily decided to plead guilty, no\n\none forced him to plead guilty, and he understood he was waiving certain\n\nconstitutional rights. During the guilty plea colloquy, Duffy affirmed that no one\n\nforced him to enter into the plea agreement, he understood that he was waiving his\n\ntrial and appeal rights, the information in the State\u2019s petition to declare him a habitual\n\noffender was accurate, he was subject to sentencing as a habitual offender and could\n\nbe sentenced to life imprisonment, and he was guilty of Violation of Privacy. Absent\n\nclear and convincing evidence to the contrary, which he has not identified, Duffy is\n\nbound by his representations during the guilty plea colloquy and in the Truth-in-\n\n\n\n\n7\n    Miller v. State, 840 A.2d 1229, 1232 (Del. 2003).\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fSentencing Guilty Plea Form.8 Duffy therefore waived his right to challenge errors\n\noccurring before his plea.\n\n       (9)     The Superior Court did not err in concluding that Duffy failed to show\n\nhis counsel was ineffective. To support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,\n\nDuffy must demonstrate that: (a) his counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective\n\nstandard of reasonableness; and (b) there is a reasonable probability that, but for his\n\ncounsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pled guilty but would have insisted on going to\n\ntrial.9 A defendant asserting a claim of ineffective assistance must make concrete\n\nallegations of cause and actual prejudice to substantiate a claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.10 Although not insurmountable, there is a strong presumption\n\nthat counsel\u2019s representation was professionally reasonable.11\n\n       (10) Duffy\u2019s ineffective assistance claims are not supported by the record.\n\nDuffy waived his Miranda claim and his challenges to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence when he knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty.12 Given the multiple\n\ncharges against him and his criminal history, the guilty plea provided Duffy with a\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Somerville v. State, 703 A.2d 629, 632 (Del. 1997).\n9\n  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 58-59 (1985); Albury v. State, 551 A.2d 53, 59 (Del. 1988).\n10\n   Younger, 580 A.2d at 556.\n11\n   Albury, 551 A.2d at 59.\n12\n   See supra n.7. See also Johnson v. State, 2008 WL 4830853, at *1 (Del. Nov. 7, 2008)\n(ineffective assistance of counsel claim implicating alleged errors before voluntary guilty plea was\nwaived by plea).\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fclear benefit. He faced multiple life sentences.13 Under the plea agreement, the State\n\nagreed to dismiss the other charges and cap its sentencing recommendation to seven\n\nyears of Level V incarceration. Finally, Duffy was not entitled to the appointment\n\nof postconviction counsel under the Federal Constitution or Rule 61.14\n\n       NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the judgment of the Superior\n\nCourt is AFFIRMED.\n\n                                             BY THE COURT:\n\n\n                                             /s/ Collins J. Seitz, Jr.\n                                                    Justice\n\n\n\n\n13\n   Duffy\u2019s claim that he could not be sentenced as a habitual offender for a non-violent felony is\nincorrect. 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4214(a) (providing that \u201cany person who has been 3 times convicted of any\nfelony under the laws of this State, and/or any other state, United States or any territory of the\nUnited States, and who shall thereafter be convicted of a subsequent felony is declared to be an\nhabitual criminal\u201d and may be sentenced to up to life imprisonment).\n14\n   See Roten v. State, 2013 WL 5808236, at *1 (Del. Oct. 28, 2013) (rejecting argument that the\nSupreme Court held there was a federal constitutional right to counsel in first postconviction\nproceedings in Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S. Ct. 1309 (2012)); Super. Ct. Crim. R. 61(e)(3) (providing\nthat the Superior Court may appoint counsel in a timely postconviction motion following a guilty\nplea where, among other things, the motion states a substantial ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim in relation to the guilty plea and specific exceptional circumstances warrant the appointment\nof counsel).\n\n\n                                                7\n\f",
