            "opinion_text": "\nKATZMANN, Chief Judge:\nIn this case, we must decide whether a sentencing provision that provides for a ten-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment if a defendant was previously convicted \u201cunder the laws, of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2), requires that an \u201caggravated sexual abuse\u201d or \u201csexual abuse\u201d conviction involve a minor or ward, or whether only \u201cabusive sexual conduct\u201d is modified by the phrase \u201cinvolving a minor or ward,\u201d such that a sexual abuse conviction involving an adult victim constitutes a predicate offense. We conclude that the statutory text and structure indicate that the latter reading is correct and therefore affirm the district court\u2019s imposition of a ten-year sentence on Defendant-Appellant Avondale Lock-hart.\nBaci\u00edground\nIn June 2010, after receiving information indicating that Lockhart had transferred money to a distributor of child pornography, federal agents initiated an undercover operation, in which they solicited Lockhart to purchase videos portraying child pornography from an agent-run service. Lockhart requested a number of videos from the agents, and on July 13, 2010, after obtaining a search warrant, the agents conducted a controlled delivery of the package ostensibly containing the videos Lockhart had ordered. Once Lockhart accepted the package, the agents executed the search warrant and seized Lockhart\u2019s laptop and external hard drive, which together contained over 15,000 images and at least nine videos depicting child pornography.\nAs a result of this investigation, Lock-hart was indicted on March 24, 2011, on two counts: (1) attempted receipt of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2), based on his attempted purchase of videos containing child pornography from the undercover agents; and (2) possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B), based on the images and videos already on his computer and hard drive. On March 6, 2012, pursuant to a plea agreement, Lockhart pleaded guilty to count two of the indictment in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Count one of the indictment was thereafter dismissed.\nLockhart had previously been convicted in state court in April 2000 of first degree sexual abuse, in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 130.65(1). The arrest report from this earlier conviction alleges that Lockhart pinned down his fifty-three-year old girlfriend, ripped off her underpants, and attempted to penetrate her vagina with his penis. Lockhart received a sentence of five years\u2019 probation and was classified as a level-one sex offender as a result of this conviction.\nThe Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) prepared for Lockhart\u2019s sentencing calculated a recommended sentencing range of 78-97 months under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. However, the PSR adopted the government\u2019s position that Lockhart was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2), which requires such a term of imprisonment if a person violates \u00a7 2252(a)(4) and \u201chas a prior conviction ... under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual *151abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2). The PSR thus recommended an effective range under the Sentencing Guidelines of 120 months due to Lockhart\u2019s prior conviction for sexual abuse in the first degree. In his sentencing submission, Lockhart argued that his prior conviction could not support the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence because his sexual abuse offense did not involve a minor. The district court rejected Lockhart\u2019s position, concluding that the mandatory minimum applied, and imposed a ten-year sentence, to be followed by ten years\u2019 supervised release. This appeal followed.\nDiscussion\nAs discussed above, Lockhart pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4) and was sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 2252(b)(2). While \u00a7 2252(b)(2) generally requires no minimum sentence, in certain circumstances the statute provides for a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years. In its entirety, \u00a7 2252(b)(2) provides:\nWhoever violates, or attempts or conspires to violate, paragraph (4) of subsection (a) shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both, but if any visual depiction involved in the offense involved a prepubescent minor or a minor who had not attained 12 years of age, such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or if such person has a prior conviction under this chapter, chapter 71, chapter 109A, or chapter 117, or under section 920 of Title 10 (article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), or under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward, or the production, possession, receipt, mailing, sale, distribution, shipment, or transportation of child pornography, such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned for not less than 10 years nor more than 20 years.\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2) (emphasis added).1\nHere, the district court found that Lockhart was subject to the mandatory minimum based on his prior state conviction for sexual abuse of an adult woman. On appeal, Lockhart challenges that conclusion, arguing that \u00a7 2252(b)(2)\u2019s mandatory minimum does not apply if the victim of the prior sexual abuse offense is an adult, rather than a minor. Thus, the sole issue on appeal is whether the phrase \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d modifies an entire category of state-law crimes \u2014 those \u201crelating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct\u201d \u2014 or whether \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d modifies only its immediately preceding antecedent, \u201cabusive sexual conduct.\u201d \u2018We review de novo all questions of law relating to the district court\u2019s application of a federal sentence enhancement.\u201d United States v. Beardsley, 691 F.3d 252, 257 (2d Cir.2012).2\n*152In interpreting \u00a7 2252(b)(2), \u201c[w]e start, as we must, with the language of the statute,\u201d giving the statutory terms their \u201c \u2018ordinary or natural\u2019 meaning.\u201d Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 144-45, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995) (quoting Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 228, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993)), superseded by statute on other grounds, Pub.L. No. 105-386,112 Stat. 3469 (1998) (codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)). Where, as here, the plain meaning is not pellucid, we can draw upon a variety of interpretive tools, including canons, statutory structure, and legislative history, to discern meaning. As to canons, we first consider which rule of statutory construction should inform our understanding of the phrase \u201crelating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor\u201d: the last antecedent rule or the series qualifier canon.\n\u201cUnder the last antecedent rule, \u2018a limiting clause or phrase should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Kerley, 416 F.3d 176, 180 (2d Cir.2005) (ellipsis omitted) (quoting Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26, 124 S.Ct. 376, 157 L.Ed.2d 333 (2003)). Although the \u201crule is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning,\u201d the last antecedent rule generally applies absent a contrary indication of meaning. Barnhart, 540 U.S. at 26, 124 S.Ct. 376 (citing 2A N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.33 at 369 (6th rev. ed.2000)). Relying on this presumption, the government contends that, as the district court concluded, the phrase \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d modifies only \u201cabusive sexual conduct,\u201d and therefore Lockhart\u2019s prior state conviction for sexual abuse triggers the imposition of \u00a7 2252(b)(2)\u2019s ten-year mandatory minimum sentence, regardless of the fact that the victim of his prior offense was an adult.\nLockhart argues in favor of the application of the contrary series qualifier canon of statutory construction, which \u201cprovides that a modifier at the beginning or end of a series of terms modifies all the terms.\u201d United States v. Laraneta, 700 F.3d 983, 989 (7th Cir.2012). The series qualifier canon applies where \u201c[t]he modifying clause appear[s] ... at the end of a single, integrated list,\u201d Jama v. Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement, 543 U.S. 335, 344 n. 4, 125 S.Ct. 694, 160 L.Ed.2d 708 (2005), and where the modifying clause \u201cundeniably applies to at least one antecedent, and ... makes sense with all,\u201d United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 339-40, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971). Lockhart contends that this canon should be applied, as the phrase \u201cinvolving a minor\u201d appears at the end of the integrated list of three antecedents, all of which would \u201cmake[] sense\u201d if limited by this modifying clause.\nLockhart and the government put forth various arguments to support reliance on their preferred canons. We are not fully persuaded that either canon applies unambiguously based on the language and structure of this statutory phrase alone. For example, while Lockhart is correct that the modifying clause \u201cinvolving a minor\u201d appears at the end of this particular list of state-law crimes, this is not the prototypical situation in which the series qualifier canon is applied, since the list itself falls in the middle of a longer list of qualifying predicate crimes; that is, the *153modifier does not end the list in its entirety. Cf. Bass, 404 U.S. at 337, 92 S.Ct. 515 (applying the series qualifier rule to the phrase \u201creceives, possesses, or transports in commerce or affecting commerce\u201d where that series provided the sole list of conduct prohibited by the statute). On the other hand, the inclusion of the word \u201cor\u201d before \u201cabusive sexual conduct\u201d and then again before \u201cthe production ... of child pornography\u201d in the immediately following clause suggests that the state sexual abuse crimes are set off as a separate list within the larger list, lending some support to Lockhart\u2019s preferred reading.3\nWe are not persuaded by Lock-hart\u2019s position that the three types of state sexual abuse offenses constitute a related \u201ccontinuum of conduct,\u201d each element of which should be modified by the phrase \u201cinvolving a minor\u201d to maintain a common limitation on the entire continuum. Br. for Def.-Appellant at 20. Such a reading would eliminate any distinction between \u201csexual abuse involving a minor\u201d and \u201cabusive sexual conduct involving a minor,\u201d since \u201cabusive sexual conduct involving a minor\u201d seemingly would encompass anything that constitutes \u201csexual abuse involving a minor,\u201d as well as, for example, other sexual conduct that may be criminalized only when the victim is a child. See, e.g., United States v. Hubbard, 480 F.3d 341 (5th Cir.2007) (finding a conviction for \u201csoliciting sex from a person the Defendant believed to be under sixteen\u201d to constitute a conviction relating to \u201cabusive sexual conduct involving a minor\u201d). Thus, Lock-hart\u2019s proposed reading may run up against the principle of statutory interpretation that \u201c[w]e assume that Congress used two terms because it intended each term to have a particular, nonsuperfluous meaning.\u201d Bailey, 516 U.S. at 146, 116 S.Ct. 501.\nAt the same time, neither are we convinced by the government\u2019s contention that the fact that there is no comma separating \u201cabusive sexual conduct\u201d from the modifier \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d itself proves that \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d should be read together with \u201cabusive sexual conduct,\u201d but not with \u201caggravated sexual abuse\u201d or \u201csexual abuse.\u201d We have previously acknowledged that \u201c[o]ne of the methods by which a writer indicates whether a modifier that follows a list of nouns or phrases is intended to modify the entire list, or only the immediate antecedent, is by punctuation \u2014 specifically by whether the list is separated from the subsequent modifier by a comma.\u201d Am. Int\u2019l Grp., Inc. v. Bank of Am. Corp., 712 F.3d 775, 781-82 (2d Cir.2013). However, while a comma may be a helpful aid to statutory interpretation, inclusion of such a comma is not a hard-and fast rule of grammar. See Bass, 404 U.S. at 340 n. 6, 92 S.Ct. 515 (\u201c[M]any leading grammarians, while sometimes noting that commas at the end of series can avoid ambiguity, concede that use of such commas is discretion*154ary\u201d)- Here, inserting a comma before \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d might confuse rather than clarify the meaning of this provision because, as discussed above, the relevant series of state sexual abuse offenses is separated only by a comma from a continuing list of state child pornography offenses. In this case, then, adding a comma before \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d might make the modifying clause appear to be a separate element in a longer list and would, in any case, be grammatically unnecessary. Accordingly, here, basing our analysis \u201conly on punctuation is necessarily incomplete and runs the risk of distorting [the] statute\u2019s true meaning.\u201d U.S. Nat\u2019l Bank of Or. v. Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., Inc., 508 U.S. 439, 454, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 124 L.Ed.2d 402 (1993). While the lack of a separating comma may run contrary to Lockhart\u2019s interpretation, it is not dispositive of our reading of \u00a7 2252(b)(2). See United States v. Rezin, 322 F.3d 443, 448 (7th Cir.2003).\nUltimately, we cannot definitively determine by applying the canons whether the phrase \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d modifies the entire category of state-law sexual abuse crimes or only \u201cabusive sexual conduct.\u201d While the government\u2019s reading appears to have greater support in the relevant clause, lingering ambiguity prevents us from concluding on this basis alone that the government\u2019s interpretation is the correct one. However, this ambiguity does not end our inquiry into the meaning of the statutory text. Rather, it is well established that statutory phrases should not be construed \u201cin isolation; we read statutes as a whole.\u201d Samantar v. Yousuf, 560 U.S. 305, 319, 130 S.Ct. 2278, 176 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2010) (quoting United States v. Morton, 467 U.S. 822, 828, 104 S.Ct. 2769, 81 L.Ed.2d 680 (1984)).\nAccordingly, we look to the remainder of \u00a7 2252(b)(2) and consider whether its overall scheme may shed light on what state-law sexual abuse offenses Congress intended to include as predicate offenses for imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence. In addition to imposing a ten-year term of imprisonment for predicate violations of state law, \u00a7 2252(b)(2) also provides for such a sentence if the defendant has a prior conviction under federal law for a violation under \u201c[chapter 110], chapter 71, chapter 109A, or chapter 117, or under section 920 of Title 10 (article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice).\u201d The referenced statutes prohibit sexual conduct, including conduct that may have both minor and adult victims. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1460-1470 (Chapter 71, offenses relating to obscene matter, materials or language); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241-2248 (Chapter 109A, sexual abuse of adults or minors); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251-2260A (Chapter 110, sexual exploitation and other abuse of minors); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2421-2428 (Chapter 117, transportation of adults or minors for illegal sexual activity and related crimes); 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 920 (rape and sexual assault under the Uniform Code of Military Justice). Importantly, \u00a7 2252(b)(2) does not specify that a conviction under a federal statute must involve a minor; a violation of any of these statutory provisions constitutes a predicate offense for the application of \u00a7 2252(b)(2)\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence, regardless of the age of the victim.\nLooking at \u00a7 2252(b)(2) as a whole, we find, as a number of other circuits have explained, that \u201cit would be unreasonable to conclude that Congress intended to impose the enhancement on defendants convicted under federal law, but not on defendants convicted for the same conduct under state law.\u201d United States v. Spence, 661 F.3d 194, 197 (4th Cir.2011); see also Hubbard, 480 F.3d at 350 (\u201cRead in context, the phrase \u2018involving a minor\u2019 modifies only \u2018abusive conduct.\u2019 We are *155persuaded this was the intent of Congress, not simply because of the placement of the phrase \u2018involving a minor,\u2019 but because the enumeration of prior federal offenses that will also give rise to a mandatory minimum sentence expressly includes sexual abuse of adults or minors.\u201d); Rezin, 322 F.3d at 448 (\u201c[I]t would have been strange had Congress on the one hand authorized heavier punishment for offenders who had a prior federal conviction for a sexual crime whether or not it involved a minor, and on the other hand insisted that if the prior conviction had been for a state offense, even one identical to one of the enumerated federal offenses, the victim had to be a minor.\u201d); cf. United States v. Sinerius, 504 F.3d 737, 740 (9th Cir.2007) (assuming, without analysis, that \u201cthe terms \u2018aggravated sexual abuse,\u2019 \u2018sexual abuse,\u2019 and \u2018abusive sexual conduct involving a minor\u2019 under \u00a7 2252A(b)\u201d set forth distinct offenses); United States v. West, 333 Fed.Appx. 494 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (holding that it was not plain error to apply the mandatory minimum to a prior conviction where the state law at issue did not always require an actual minor victim). This reasoning compels us to conclude that \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d modifies only prior state convictions for \u201cabusive sexual conduct,\u201d not those for \u201csexual abuse\u201d or \u201caggravated sexual abuse,\u201d each of which would constitute a predicate federal offense if committed against an adult or a child.\nWe acknowledge that the Sixth, Eighth and Tenth Circuits have reached the opposite conclusion, namely, that the phrase \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d modifies all three categories of state sexual abuse crimes. However, the Eighth and Tenth Circuits have drawn this conclusion without elaborating on their reasoning. Indeed, these circuits appear merely to have assumed that a prior state-law sexual abuse conviction requires a minor victim for purposes of the sentencing enhancement, an assumption that made little difference in those cases since the predicate violations at issue involved minor victims. See United States v. Hunter, 505 F.3d 829, 831 (8th Cir.2007) (relying on this assumption); United States v. McCutchen, 419 F.3d 1122, 1125 (10th Cir.2005) (considering whether \u201cthe statute under which [a] prior state conviction arose must have included as an element the victim\u2019s status as a minor\u201d for the conviction to fall within the scope of any of the three categories in \u00a7 2252(b)(2)). The Sixth Circuit has reached this conclusion most explicitly, although it did so because it found that another panel of that court had \u201calready considered the proper construction of the statutory language at issue,\u201d and that that prior decision bound the current panel, even though the earlier opinion did not engage in any express analysis of the statutory language. United States v. Mateen, 739 F.3d 300, 304-05 (6th Cir.2014) (citing United States v. Gardner, 649 F.3d 437 (6th Cir.2011)), reh\u2019g en banc granted, opinion vacated (Apr. 9, 2014). We are not compelled to follow such unexplored assumptions in coming to our conclusion here.4\nResisting the conclusion that Congress intended to treat state and federal predi*156cate crimes similarly, Lockhart argues that the relevant pattern in \u00a7 2252(b)(2) is instead that Congress limited other state-law predicate offenses in this and related sentencing provisions to those involving children. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2) (including state offenses relating to \u201cchild pornography\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(e) (including state offenses relating to \u201csex trafficking of children\u201d). According to Lock-hart, then, not reading \u201caggravated sexual abuse\u201d and \u201csexual abuse\u201d to be limited to those convictions \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d would create an inconsistency among the treatment of different state-law offenses. While there is some logic to this position, we do not think that this theory is more reasonable than the assumption that Congress would intend for courts to treat prior sexual abuse convictions similarly, regardless of whether the conviction was under federal or state law. Lockhart\u2019s interpretation is further undermined when one compares the language used to describe the universe of state sexual abuse convictions in \u00a7 2252(b)(2) with the federal analogs in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 (aggravated sexual abuse), 2242 (sexual abuse), and 2243 (sexual abuse of a minor or ward). Under the federal statutory scheme, adult and minor victims are included under the first two provisions, while \u00a7 2243 covers only minors and wards. Although the language used in \u00a7 2252(b)(2) is not identical to these statutory titles, it nonetheless suggests that Congress intended to impart a similar structure to state-law predicate offenses for purposes of this sentencing enhancement, and the pattern Lockhart perceives among other state-law offenses does not necessarily apply here.\nWe furthermore note that the brief legislative history of this provision does not alter our conclusion. See S.Rep. No. 104-358,104th Cong., 1996 WL 506545, at *9 (1996) (stating only that the penalties under \u00a7\u00a7 2252 and 2252A would provide for a mandatory minimum sentence for \u201ca repeat offender with a prior conviction under chapter 109A or 110 of title 18, or under any State child abuse law or law relating to the production, receipt or distribution of child pornography\u201d). Likewise, resort to the rule of lenity is inappropriate where, as here, \u201cthe statutory text allows us to make far more than \u2018a guess as to what Congress intended.\u2019 \u201d DePierre v. United States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2225, 2237, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011) (quoting Reno v. Koray, 515 U.S. 50, 65, 115 S.Ct. 2021, 132 L.Ed.2d 46 (1995)).\nAccordingly, because we conclude that \u201cinvolving a minor or ward\u201d modifies only \u201cabusive sexual conduct\u201d and not \u201csexual abuse\u201d or \u201caggravated sexual abuse,\u201d we find that the district court correctly applied \u00a7 2252(b)(2)\u2019s sentencing enhancement in light of Lockhart\u2019s prior conviction for sexual abuse.\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment and sentence of the district court are affirmed.\n\n. Language identical or similar to the key phrase \"aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\u201d is used in four other sentencing provisions in Chapter 110 of Title 18 of the United States Code. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) (referring to \"abusive sexual contact,\u201d rather than \"conduct\u201d), 2252(b)(1), 2252A(b)(1), 2252A(b)(2).\n\n\n. As part of his plea agreement, Lockhart waived his right to appeal his sentence but excluded from that waiver the issue now before the Court. On March 26, 2013, the government filed a motion to dismiss Lockhart\u2019s appeal based on this waiver. However, on July 8, 2013, the government moved to withdraw its motion to dismiss, acknowledging that the instant issue fell outside the scope of *152the appeal waiver. The Court granted the government's motion to withdraw its prior motion on July 9, 2013. Therefore, waiver is not at issue, and we proceed to the merits of Lockhart's claim.\n\n\n. Although we do not deem this dispositive on its own, we note that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(e)\u2019s similar language differs from that used in \u00a7 2252(b)(2) in a manner that sheds some light on the present dispute. Specifically, \u00a7 2251(e) imposes a heightened sentence on defendants convicted of prior crimes \"under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual contact involving a minor or ward, or sex trafficking of children, or the production ... of child pornography.\u201d In this context, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, and abusive sexual conduct do not form their own separate list ending in a common modifier; rather, \u201cabusive sexual contact involving a minor or ward\u201d is the third element of a four-element list ending in \"sex trafficking of children.\u201d We assume that Congress intended \u00a7 2251(e)\u2019s similar language to be read in tandem with \u00a7 2252(b)(2). Thus, the addition of a fourth element in \u00a7 2251(e) after the modifier suggests that the series qualifier canon should not be applied.\n\n\n. In United States v. Beardsley, 691 F.3d 252 (2d Cir.2012), this Court commented that for a state-law conviction to trigger the analogous sentencing enhancement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(1), \"the statute underlying the pri- or conviction must itself relate to sexual abuse of minors for the enhancement to apply.\u201d Id. at 269. However, this statement is dictum and does not bind this panel. At issue in Beardsley was whether to take a categorical approach in determining whether a state-law conviction for endangering the welfare of a child was a predicate offense under \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) sentencing enhancement. *156Beardsley\u2019s actual conduct underlying the conviction constituted \"abusive sexual conduct involving a minor,\" so that case turned on the scope of the conduct prohibited by the statute, not whether the conviction must involve a minor. See id. at 256. This understanding of Beardsley was confirmed in a recent decision of this Court, in which we stated that \"[w]e did not expressly identify in Beardsley that the three types of predicate offenses are distinct, nor did we address whether the phrase 'involving a minor or ward' modifies only 'abusive sexual conduct\u2019 as other Courts of Appeals have done.\u201d United States v. Barker, 723 F.3d 315, 322 (2d Cir.2013) (per curiam). Thus, we are not bound by Beardsley\u2019s suggestion that \"involving a minor\u201d modifies each term.\n\n",
