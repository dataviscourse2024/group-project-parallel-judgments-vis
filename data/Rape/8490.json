SHANNON ANN MANESS and DARYL\n                       WAYNE MANESS\n\n                     Appeal from the Circuit Court for Chester County\n                       No. 11-CR-46A Roy B. Morgan, Jr., Judge\n\n\n\n                  No. W2012-02655-CCA-R3-CD - Filed January 23, 2014\n\n\nAppellants, Daryl and Shannon Maness, were each indicted by the Chester County Grand\nJury for two counts of aggravated statutory rape. After a jury trial, Appellants were found\nguilty as charged. They were each sentenced to an effective sentence of three years. The\ntrial court denied Appellants\u2019 request for alternative sentencing. On appeal, Appellants argue\nthat the trial court erred in denying their motions in limine requesting the exclusion of certain\nsexually explicit photographs, that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions,\nand that the trial court erred in denying their request for alternative sentences. After a\nthorough review of the record, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the\nmotion in limine and that the evidence was sufficient. However, we conclude that the trial\ncourt based the denial of alternative sentencing on deterrence grounds without sufficient\nevidence as required under State v. Hooper, 29 S.W.3d 1 (Tenn. 2000). Therefore, we affirm\nAppellants\u2019 convictions, but remand for a new sentencing hearing.\n\nTenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Trial Court is Affirmed and\n                                    Remanded.\n\nJ ERRY L. S MITH, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which J OSEPH M. T IPTON, P.J., and\nN ORMA M CG EE O GLE, J., joined.\n\nKandi Kelley Collins, Jackson, Tennessee, for the appellants, Shannon Ann Maness and\nDaryl Wayne Maness.\n\nRobert E. Cooper, Jr., Attorney General and Reporter; J. Ross Dyer, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral; Jerry Woodall, District Attorney General, and Jody Pickens, Assistant District\nAttorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\f                                                   OPINION\n\n                                            Factual Background\n\n       The victim, A.G.1 , had known the Appellants her entire life because they were her\nmother\u2019s friends from school. A.G.\u2019s mother was thirty-five at the time of the incidents, so\nA.G. assumed that Appellants were also thirty-five. In June 2010, the time of the incidents,\nthe victim was fifteen and going into the tenth grade. The victim was living with her\ngrandparents. At some point, A.G. had an argument with her grandfather and asked to live\nwith Appellants, who are a married couple. The victim\u2019s mother took her to meet Mrs.\nManess, so Mrs. Maness could take A.G. to her mobile home. Appellants lived in a mobile\nhome with their son, who was younger than A.G. The family stayed in one bedroom in the\nmobile home because the air conditioning was broken. There was a mattress on the floor\nupon which Appellants\u2019 son slept when he was home. The victim slept in the bed with\nAppellants.\n\n       Around June 7, 2010, A.G. was sleeping in the bed with Appellants. Appellants\u2019 son\nwas spending the night with his grandparents. A.G. awoke to discover that Appellants were\nengaging in intercourse and that one of the Appellants was touching her breast. A.G. covered\nup and turned over. However, Appellants told A.G. that she was \u201call talk and no action.\u201d\nMr. Maness undressed A.G., and Mrs. Maness began to touch A.G.\u2019s breast. While Mrs.\nManess was touching A.G.\u2019s breast, Mr. Maness got on top of A.G. and engaged in vaginal\nintercourse with her. A.G. did not resist because she was \u201cin the middle of nowhere with\nnobody to tell.\u201d\n\n       About two weeks later, around June 20, A.G. was sleeping in the bed with Appellants\nagain. She stated that both Appellants began touching her. She was undressed at some point.\nMr. Maness got on top of her and engaged in vaginal intercourse with A.G., and Mrs. Maness\ntouched A.G. all over her body, including her breasts.\n\n        At some point after the second incident, A.G. and another girl were at Appellants\u2019\nresidence. Appellants began to argue, so the girls left and walked down the road. They\ncalled the police to pick them up. The police picked up the girls and took them home. A.G.\ntestified that Appellants sent sexually explicit photographs to her cellphone including\nphotographs of a dildo by itself, two photographs of the dildo inserted into Mrs. Maness\u2019s\nvagina, and a photograph of Mr. Maness\u2019s semi-erect penis. The photographs were sent in\nMay 2010.\n\n       1\n           It is the policy of this Court to refer to minor victims by their initials.\n\n                                                        -2-\n\f       A.G. did not tell anyone about the incidents until Annette Cotton, who is employed\nwith the Shelby County Sheriff\u2019s office and assigned to the FBI\u2019s Crimes Against Children\nUnit, came to her home and spoke with her. Agent Cotton is assigned to the Innocent Images\nTask Force. On June 30, 2010, Deputy Cotton came to Appellants\u2019 home to interview them\nand execute a search warrant. Initially, Mrs. Maness was the only adult present. Deputy\nCotton discovered in her research that Mrs. Maness was thirty-five years old. Eventually,\nMr. Maness was present at the interview. Deputy Cotton seized their cellphones and showed\nthe photographs in question to Mr. Maness. Mr. Maness identified the photographs as\nimages of his penis and his wife\u2019s vagina.\n\n      Agent Steven Lies, with the FBI, accompanied Deputy Cotton to interview Appellants\nand execute the search warrant. Mr. Maness told Agent Lies that they communicated with\nA.G. through e-mail and text messaging. Mr. Maness stated that initially their\ncommunication was harmless but that it evolved into being sexually explicit.\n\n       In November 2011, the Chester County Grand Jury indicted Appellants for two counts\nof aggravated statutory rape. On June 25, 2012, the trial court held a jury trial. At the\nconclusion of the jury trial, Appellants were each convicted as charged. On July 13, 2012,\nat separate sentencing hearings, the trial court sentenced each Appellant to three years for\neach conviction to be run concurrently. The effective sentence was three years. Appellants\nappeal both their convictions and sentences.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n                                        Photographs\n\n       On appeal, Appellants argue that the trial court erred in denying their motion in limine\nto exclude certain photographs from use as evidence at trial.\n\n       Appellants filed motions in limine to prevent the introduction of sexually explicit\nphotographs of the victim, as well as photographs taken of Appellants. The trial court held\na hearing before trial on Appellants\u2019 motions. The trial court excluded the photographs taken\nof the naked victim. The trial court stated that the photographs of the naked, minor victim\nconstitute a crime and could involve allegations of a separate crime. However, the trial court\ndetermined that the photograph of Mr. Maness\u2019s semi-erect penis, the photograph of a dildo,\nand the two photographs of the dildo being inserted into Mrs. Maness\u2019s vagina could be\nintroduced. The trial court stated that these photographs were relevant because Appellants\nwere sending sexually explicit items to the victim and it demonstrated the relationship\nbetween Appellants and A.G.\n\n\n\n                                              -3-\n\f        The Tennessee Rules of Evidence embody, and our courts traditionally have\nacknowledged, \u201ca policy of liberality in the admission of evidence in both civil and criminal\ncases . . . .\u201d State v. Banks, 564 S.W.2d 947, 949 (Tenn. 1978); see also State v. Robinson,\n930 S.W.2d 78, 84 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995). To be admissible, evidence must satisfy the\nthreshold determination of relevancy mandated by Rule 401 of the Tennessee Rules of\nEvidence. See, e.g., Banks, 564 S .W.2d at 949. Rule 401 defines \u201crelevant evidence\u201d as\nbeing \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence\nto the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without\nthe evidence.\u201d Tenn. R. Evid. 401. However, relevant \u201cevidence may be excluded if its\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice . . . .\u201d Tenn.\nR. Evid. 403; see also Banks, 564 S.W.2d at 951.\n\n        The State argues that this issue is waived because the photographs in question have\nnot been included in the record on appeal. The State is correct in this assertion. It is\nwell-settled that it is the duty of the appellant to prepare a record that conveys a fair,\naccurate, and complete account of what transpired in the trial court with respect to the issues\nthat form the basis for the appeal. Tenn. R. App. P. 24(b); State v. Thompson, 36 S.W.3d\n102, 108 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000); State v. Miller, 737 S.W.2d 556, 558 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n1987). In the absence of an adequate record, this Court must presume the correctness of the\ntrial court\u2019s ruling. State v. Bibbs, 806 S.W.2d 786, 790 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991).\n\n                                Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n        Appellants argue that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions.\nWhen a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court is obliged to review\nthat claim according to certain well-settled principles. A verdict of guilty, rendered by a jury\nand \u201capproved by the trial judge, accredits the testimony of the\u201d State\u2019s witnesses and\nresolves all conflicts in the testimony in favor of the State. State v. Cazes, 875 S.W.2d 253,\n259 (Tenn. 1994); State v. Harris, 839 S.W.2d 54, 75 (Tenn. 1992). Thus, although the\naccused is originally cloaked with a presumption of innocence, the jury verdict of guilty\nremoves this presumption \u201cand replaces it with one of guilt.\u201d State v. Tuggle, 639 S.W.2d\n913, 914 (Tenn. 1982). Hence, on appeal, the burden of proof rests with the defendant to\ndemonstrate the insufficiency of the convicting evidence. Id.\n\n        The relevant question the reviewing court must answer is whether any rational trier\nof fact could have found the accused guilty of every element of the offense beyond a\nreasonable doubt. See Tenn. R. App. P. 13(e); Harris, 839 S.W.2d at 75. In making this\ndecision, we are to accord the State \u201cthe strongest legitimate view of the evidence as well as\nall reasonable and legitimate inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u201d See Tuggle, 639\nS.W.2d at 914. As such, this Court is precluded from re-weighing or reconsidering the\n\n                                              -4-\n\fevidence when evaluating the convicting proof. State v. Morgan, 929 S.W.2d 380, 383\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1996); State v. Matthews, 805 S.W.2d 776, 779 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1990).\nMoreover, we may not substitute our own \u201cinferences for those drawn by the trier of fact\nfrom circumstantial evidence.\u201d Matthews, 805 S.W.2d at 779. Further, questions concerning\nthe credibility of the witnesses and the weight and value to be given to evidence, as well as\nall factual issues raised by such evidence, are resolved by the trier of fact and not the\nappellate courts. State v. Pruett, 788 S.W.2d 559, 561 (Tenn. 1990). \u201cThe standard of\nreview \u2018is the same whether the conviction is based upon direct or circumstantial evidence.\u2019\u201d\nState v. Dorantes, 331 S.W.3d 370, 379 (Tenn. 2011) (quoting State v. Hanson, 279 S.W.3d\n265, 275 (Tenn. 2009)).\n\n        Aggravated statutory rape is defined as, \u201cthe unlawful sexual penetration of a victim\nby the defendant, or of the defendant by the victim when the victim is at least thirteen (13)\nbut less than eighteen (18) years of age and the defendant is at least ten (10) years older than\nthe victim.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 39-13-506(c).\n\n        Appellants essentially argue that A.G. was the only witness to testify regarding the\nelements of aggravated statutory rape and that she \u201chad a means to call for help and did not,\nhad an opportunity to inform law enforcement and did not, and could not recall various\ndetails.\u201d Essentially, this argument is an attack on A.G.\u2019s credibility as a witness.\n\n       The victim was the sole witness to the events at issue. Under a recent decision of our\nsupreme court, the victim of aggravated statutory rape is no longer considered an accomplice\nand, therefore, corroboration is not required of the victim\u2019s testimony. State v. Collier, 411\nS.W.3d 886, 899-90 (Tenn. 2013). The issue presented by Appellants turns on whether the\njury found the victim to be credible.\n\n        In the case at hand, the jury clearly found the victim to be credible based upon the fact\nthat it found Appellants guilty of both counts of aggravated statutory rape. Questions of\ncredibility are determined by the jury. Bland, 958 S.W.2d at 659. When the evidence is\ntaken in the light most favorable to the State, it shows that the victim was fifteen years old\nand Appellants were thirty-five years old, which is more than ten years older than the victim.\nAlso, there was evidence presented that Mr. Maness sexually penetrated the victim, as well\nas evidence of Mrs. Maness\u2019s participation in the sexual penetration through the theory of\ncriminal responsibility, for which the jury was instructed. We conclude that there was\nsufficient evidence to support the conviction for aggravated statutory rape of A.G. by\nAppellants.\n\n       This issue is without merit.\n\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\f                                  Alternative Sentencing\n\n       On appeal, Appellants argue that the trial court erred in denying their requests for\nalternative sentencing. Appellate review of sentencing is for abuse of discretion. We must\napply \u201ca presumption of reasonableness to within-range sentencing decisions that reflect a\nproper application of the purposes and principles of our Sentencing Act.\u201d State v. Bise, 380\nS.W.3d 682, 707 (Tenn. 2012). This standard of review is also applicable to \u201cquestions\nrelated to probation or any other alternative sentence.\u201d State v. Caudle, 388 S.W.3d 273,\n278-79 (Tenn. 2012). Thus, in reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of an alternative sentence, the\napplicable standard of review is abuse of discretion with a presumption of reasonableness so\nlong as the sentence \u201creflect[s] a decision based upon the purposes and principles of\nsentencing.\u201d Id. The party appealing the sentence has the burden of demonstrating its\nimpropriety. T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-401, Sent\u2019g Comm\u2019n Cmts.; see also State v. Ashby, 823\nS.W.2d 166, 169 (Tenn. 1991).\n\n        In making its sentencing determination, the trial court, at the conclusion of the\nsentencing hearing, first determines the range of sentence and then determines the specific\nsentence and the appropriate combination of sentencing alternatives by considering: (1) the\nevidence, if any, received at the trial and the sentencing hearing; (2) the presentence report;\n(3) the principles of sentencing and arguments as to sentencing alternatives; (4) the nature\nand characteristics of the criminal conduct involved; (5) evidence and information offered\nby the parties on the enhancement and mitigating factors; (6) any statistical information\nprovided by the administrative office of the courts regarding sentences for similar offenses;\n(7) any statements the defendant wishes to make in the defendant\u2019s behalf about sentencing;\nand (8) the potential for rehabilitation or treatment. T.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 40-35-210(a), (b), -103(5);\nState v. Williams, 920 S.W.2d 247, 258 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995).\n\n       The trial court is still required to place on the record its reasons for imposing the\nspecific sentence, including the identification of the mitigating and enhancement factors\nfound, the specific facts supporting each enhancement factor found, and the method by which\nthe mitigating and enhancement factors have been evaluated and balanced in determining the\nsentence. See Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 706, n.41; State v. Samuels, 44 S.W.3d 489, 492 (Tenn.\n2001). Thus, under Bise, a \u201csentence should be upheld so long as it is within the appropriate\nrange and the record demonstrates that the sentence is otherwise in compliance with the\npurposes and principles listed by statute.\u201d Bise, 380 S.W.3d at 710.\n\n        As a result of the 2005 sentencing amendments, a defendant is no longer presumed\nto be a favorable candidate for alternative sentencing. State v. Carter, 254 S.W.3d 335, 347\n(Tenn. 2008) (citing T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-102(6)). While a presumption no longer exists, an\nespecially mitigated or standard offender convicted of a Class C, D, or E felony is still\n\n                                              -6-\n\fconsidered a \u201cfavorable candidate\u201d for alternative sentencing in the absence of evidence to\nthe contrary. Id. A defendant is eligible for an alternative sentence if his sentence is ten\nyears or less. T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-303.\n\n        In determining a defendant\u2019s suitability for a non-incarcerative sentencing alternative,\nthe trial court should consider whether:\n\n\n       (A) Confinement is necessary to protect society by restraining a defendant who\n       has a long history of criminal conduct;\n\n       (B) Confinement is necessary to avoid depreciating the seriousness of the\n       offense or confinement is particularly suited to provide an effective deterrence\n       to others likely to commit similar offenses; or\n\n       (C) Measures less restrictive than confinement have frequently or recently\n       been applied unsuccessfully to the defendant . . . .\n\n\nT.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-103(1)(A)-(C).\n\n        The court should also consider the defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation or treatment\nin determining the appropriate sentence. T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-103(5). In choosing among\npossible sentencing alternatives, the trial court should also consider Tennessee Code\nAnnotated section 40-35-103(5), which states, in pertinent part, \u201c[t]he potential or lack of\npotential for the rehabilitation or treatment of the defendant should be considered in\ndetermining the sentence alternative or length of a term to be imposed.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-\n103(5); State v. Dowdy, 894 S.W.2d 301, 305 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994). A defendant is\neligible for probation \u201cif the sentence actually imposed . . . is (10) years or less . . . .\u201d\n\n      At the sentencing hearing, the trial court stated the following reasons for denying the\nimposition of an alternative sentence:\n\n\n       In this case, the Court specifically finds though that confinement is necessary\n       to avoid depreciating the seriousness of the offense, an offense such as this,\n       particularly suited to being also an effective deterrent to others likely to\n       commit similar offenses. Those are very serious considerations for the Court\n       in this case. I just feel like it\u2019s necessary again. It\u2019s a serious offense, and I\n       want to set forth a deterrence to others under similar circumstances. I think\n\n                                              -7-\n\f       that they should be required to serve their sentence under the circumstances in\n       the Tennessee Department of Corrections as Range I Offenders, 30 percent\n       release eligibility, and that will be the order of this Court.\n\n\n        Appellants argue that the trial court erred in denying alternative sentencing because\n\u201cThe State presented no proof of prior convictions or wrongs by the Defendant.\u201d The trial\ncourt based its denial of alternative sentencing on the need for deterrence to others who are\nlikely to commit such an offense.\n\n       In State v. Hooper, 29 S.W.3d 1 (Tenn. 2000), our supreme court addressed the\nreliance upon deterrence as the basis for the denial of alternative sentencing. In Hooper, the\nsupreme court stated that if deterrence is the basis for the denial of an alternative sentence,\n\u201cthe record must contain some proof of the need for deterrence before a defendant, who is\notherwise eligible for probation or other alternative sentence, may be incarcerated.\u201d Id. at\n9. The supreme court went on to state the following:\n\n\n       The trial courts should be given considerable latitude in determining whether\n       a need for deterrence exists and whether incarceration appropriately addresses\n       that need. Accordingly, we will presume that a trial court\u2019s decision to\n       incarcerate a defendant based on a need for deterrence is correct so long as any\n       reasonable person looking at the entire record could conclude that (1) a need\n       to deter similar crimes is present in the particular community, jurisdiction, or\n       in the state as a whole, and (2) incarceration of the defendant may rationally\n       serve as a deterrent to others similarly situated and likely to commit similar\n       crimes.\n\n\nHooper, 29 S.W.3d at 10. The record herein does not contain such evidence as required by\nHooper that would lead a reasonable person to the conclusion that deterrence is a proper\nbasis to deny alternative sentencing in this case.\n\n       Therefore, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s denial of alternative sentencing based\nupon the need for deterrence is not supported by the record. We remand for a new\nsentencing hearing to determine whether Appellants are suitable for alternative sentences.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -8-\n\f                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the convictions, but remand for a new sentencing\nhearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                          ___________________________________\n                                          JERRY L.
