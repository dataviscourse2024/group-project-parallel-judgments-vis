The trial court imposed exceptional minimum sentences on each conviction based on\n\nthree aggravating factors: abuse of a position of trust, ongoing pattern of sexual abuse as\n\nmanifested by multiple incidents over a prolonged period of time (multiple incidents), and multiple\n\nvictims.\n\n       We hold that (1) the trial court\u2019s reliance on the multiple incidents aggravating factor was\n\nnot error, (2) because the State charged Menzies with crimes against each victim, the multiple\n\nvictim aggravating factor was improper, and (3) reversal of the exceptional sentences and remand\n\nfor resentencing is appropriate because the record is not sufficiently clear to establish that the trial\n\fNo. 51431-1-II\n\n\ncourt would have imposed the same exceptional sentences without the multiple victim aggravating\n\nfactor.1 In addition, on remand the trial court should address the LFOs under the current law.\n\n                                              FACTS\n\n                                       I. ORIGINAL CHARGES\n\n       In June 2016, KM\u2019s mother contacted law enforcement and reported that her six-year-old\n\ndaughter KM had disclosed that Menzies, KM\u2019s father, had sexually abused her. Based on KM\u2019s\n\nallegations, the State originally charged Menzies with two counts of first degree rape of a child\n\nand two counts of first degree child molestation. The declaration for determination of probable\n\ncause supporting these charges stated that during a forensic interview, KM had revealed that\n\nMenzies had forced her to engage in oral sex and other sexual contact \u201cmultiple times\u201d for more\n\nthan a year. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 1.\n\n       After Menzies\u2019s arrest, his 12 year old stepdaughter KE disclosed that Menzies had\n\nengaged in oral, vaginal, and anal sexual intercourse with her. KE stated that the sexual abuse\n\nstarted when she was about five years old and the incidents occurred several times a week,\n\nsometimes more than once in a single night, until Menzies\u2019s arrest.            Based on these new\n\nallegations, the State amended the information to include four more charges: three counts of first\n\ndegree rape of a child and one count of second degree rape of a child.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Menzies originally argued that the trial court also erred when it failed to enter written findings\nof fact and conclusions of law supporting the exceptional sentence. The trial court has entered\nthe written findings, so this argument is moot.\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fNo. 51431-1-II\n\n\n                               II. GUILTY PLEAS AND STIPULATION\n\n       Menzies pleaded guilty to two counts of first degree rape, one for each victim, as charged\n\nin the second amended information. In his statement of defendant on plea of guilty, Menzies stated\n\nthat he had committed the crimes and admitted facts related to three aggravating factors: abuse of\n\ntrust, multiple offenses per victim, and multiple victims. .\n\n       Menzies also entered a waiver of his right to a jury trial on the aggravating factors. In this\n\nwaiver, Menzies agreed to allow the trial court to rely on the statement of probable cause, the\n\nState\u2019s sentencing memorandum, the recitation of the facts by the State at the guilty plea hearing,\n\nthe victim impact statements, and the victims\u2019 statements in open court to establish the aggravating\n\ncircumstances and to determine \u201cwhether the facts provide substantial and compelling reasons\u201d to\n\nimpose exceptional sentences. CP at 30.\n\n       The trial court permitted the State to file the second amended information, which charged\n\nMenzies with two counts of first degree rape of a child (domestic violence), one for each child.\n\nThe information alleged that the offense against KM occurred over a two-year, three-month period\n\nand the offense against KE occurred over a six-year period. Following a colloquy, the trial court\n\nfound a factual basis for the pleas and accepted Menzies\u2019s guilty pleas. The case then proceeded\n\nto sentencing.\n\n                                         III. SENTENCING\n\n       At sentencing, Menzies argued that the trial court should not consider the abuse of trust or\n\nmultiple victim aggravating factors because they were already reflected in the charges. He did not\n\nchallenge the multiple incidents aggravating factor.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fNo. 51431-1-II\n\n\n       The trial court orally addressed all three of the aggravating factors:\n\n               This is a defendant who was in the position of trust and authority as a parent\n       or stepparent to the two victims.\n\n               The pattern of abuse was excessive, as if any abuse wouldn\u2019t be excessive.\n       But even in that context, this pattern of abuse was incredibly excessive, daily\n       patterns, oftentimes more than once a day, lasting for years. Done with threats of\n       violence and terror and even the threat of death.\n\n               Now that the defendant has been caught he recognizes his shortcomings.\n       Frankly, it\u2019s impossible for this Court to believe that the very first incident, the very\n       first moment, the very first opportunity, the very first inclination he wouldn\u2019t have\n       recognized the damage he was about to do.\n\n               If I had the power I certainly would be removing the pain from these\n       children, the ugliness in their lives, which are going to last for a heck of a lot more\n       than the sentence I\u2019m going to impose in this case. It will last the rest of their lives;\n       and by the way, probably through your grandchildren\u2019s lives and possibly through\n       their grandchildren as well.\n\n               This pattern goes on and on and on. It does not stop. Hopefully, they\u2019ll get\n       the help they need. The damage is really unmeasurable. There\u2019s no word for it.\n\n               An exceptional sentence is really called out for in this case. The Legislature\n       set some parameters for us to take a look at. They mean doggone well that we\n       follow those parameters unless there is exceptions.\n\n               There is exceptions here. This was abuse of trust, multiple victims. Yes,\n       the two victims are multiple victims. There are two crimes. They\u2019re also multiple,\n       because every doggone day they were a victim again. Multiple victims, multiple\n       times; and the power of authority and trust, coupled with threats of violence and\n       death.\n\n               240 months confinement counts I and II[.2]\n\nRP at 45-46 (emphasis added). The trial court did not, however, expressly state that it would have\n\nimposed the same sentences if one or more of the aggravating factors were not present.\n\n\n\n2\n The standard range minimum sentence based on Menzies\u2019s offender score of zero points was\n120 to 160 months.\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fNo. 51431-1-II\n\n\n         The trial court later entered written findings of fact and conclusions of law addressing the\n\nexceptional sentence. The trial court found,\n\n         4. The defendant is the stepfather of K.E. and the biological father of K.M. The\n         defendant occupied a position of trust with respect to both K.E. and K.M.\n\n         5. The defendant engaged in multiple acts of sexual intercourse with both K.M.\n         and K.E. The sexual abuse of K.M. and K.E. was excessive, lasted for years,\n         occurred on a daily or more than once daily basis and included threats of violence.\n\n         6. There are multiple victims in this case.\n\nCP at 102. The trial court also incorporated its oral ruling by reference.\n\n         Based on these findings, the trial court concluded that the facts supported each of the three\n\naggravating factors and that each of these factors were substantial and compelling reasons to\n\nimpose an exceptional sentence. The trial court imposed a sentence of 240 months to life on each\n\ncount.\n\n         The trial court also addressed LFOs. The trial court declined to impose any discretionary\n\nLFOs, but it imposed mandatory LFOs including a $200 criminal filing fee. The trial court also\n\nordered that the LFOs would bear interest from the date of the judgment and sentence.\n\n         Menzies appealed his exceptional sentences, the $200 criminal filing fee, and the LFO\n\ninterest provision.\n\n                                             ANALYSIS\n\n                                    I. EXCEPTIONAL SENTENCES\n\n         Menzies argues that (1) the multiple incidents aggravating factor was improper because the\n\nunit of prosecution for first degree rape of a child is each act of sexual intercourse or penetration\n\nand he pleaded guilty to only one charge per victim, (2) the multiple victims aggravating factor\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fNo. 51431-1-II\n\n\nwas improper because there were separate charges for each victim, and (3) these errors require\n\nresentencing because it is not clear that the trial court would have imposed the same sentences\n\nwithout these aggravating factors.\n\nA. LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n\n       To reverse an exceptional sentence, we must find, \u201c(1) under the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019\n\nstandard, the reasons for departure from the presumptive range are not supported by the record;\n\n[or] (2) as a matter of law, the stated reasons do not justify the exceptional sentence.\u201d3 State v.\n\nHutsell, 120 Wash. 2d 913, 916, 845 P.2d 1325 (1993). We may, however, affirm an exceptional\n\nsentence when it is clear from the record that the trial court would have imposed the same sentence\n\nbased on any remaining aggravating factors that are upheld. State v. Jackson, 150 Wash. 2d 251,\n\n276, 76 P.3d 217 (2003); State v. Gaines, 122 Wash. 2d 502, 512, 859 P.2d 36 (1993).\n\nB. MULTIPLE INCIDENTS\n\n       Menzies argues that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the multiple incidents aggravating factor\n\nwas improper because the unit of prosecution is each act of sexual intercourse or penetration and\n\nhe pleaded guilty to only one charge per victim. We disagree that the trial court could not consider\n\nmultiple incidents in imposing the exceptional sentence.\n\n       RCW 9.94A.530(3) gives the trial court the authority to consider facts related to additional\n\ncrimes in this circumstance. RCW 9.94A.530(3) provides, in part: \u201cFacts that establish the\n\nelements of a more serious crime or additional crimes may not be used to go outside the standard\n\n\n\n\n3\n  The third ground upon which an appellant can challenge an exceptional sentence is if the sentence\nis clearly excessive. State v. Hutsell, 120 Wash. 2d 913, 916, 845 P.2d 1325 (1993). Menzies does\nnot argue that the sentence was clearly excessive.\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fNo. 51431-1-II\n\n\nsentence range except . . . when specifically provided for in RCW 9.94A.535(3). . . (g).\u201d (Emphasis\n\nadded.) The multiple incidents aggravating factor is codified under RCW 9.94A.535(3)(g). Thus,\n\nRCW 9.94A.530(3) expressly allowed the trial court to consider \u201c[f]acts that establish the elements\n\nof a more serious crime or additional crimes\u201d in imposing the exceptional sentence based on the\n\nmultiple incidents aggravating factor.\n\n       Menzies relies on State v. Vaughn, 83 Wash. App. 669, 677, 924 P.2d 27 (1996), State v.\n\nArmstrong, 106 Wash. 2d 547, 550, 723 P.2d 1111 (1986), and State v. Dunaway, 109 Wash. 2d 207,\n\n219, 743 P.2d 1237, as amended by 749 P.2d 160 (1988), for the premise that the multiple incidents\n\nmust take place \u201cduring the course of the incident underlying the charged crime.\u201d Opening Br. of\n\nAppellant at 11. Although each of these cases involved a single charge based on a series of\n\nincidents that occurred over a shorter period of time than is the case here, none of these cases\n\nrequire that the multiple incidents that are the basis for the aggravating factor must occur during a\n\nsingle act or a specified period of time.4\n\n       Because RCW 9.94A.530(3) expressly allows the trial court to consider additional crimes\n\nwhen evaluating the multiple incidents aggravating factor, Menzies fails to show that the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s reliance on the multiple incidents aggravating factor was clearly erroneous or that this\n\naggravating factor was improper as a matter of law.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Armstrong and Dunaway also address a nonstatutory aggravating factor, not the multiple\nincidents aggravating factor at issue here. Armstrong, 106 Wash. 2d at 550; Dunaway, 109 Wash. 2d\nat 219.\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fNo. 51431-1-II\n\n\nC. MULTIPLE VICTIMS\n\n       Menzies further argues that the multiple victims aggravating factor was improper as a\n\nmatter of law because the State filed charges related to each of the victims. The State concedes\n\nthat the trial court\u2019s reliance on this aggravating factor was improper.\n\n       The multiple victim aggravator is not available when, as here, the State had filed charges\n\nfor each victim. State v. Bourne, 90 Wash. App. 963, 976, 954 P.2d 366 (1998) (citing State v. Flake,\n\n76 Wash. App. 174, 184, 883 P.2d 341 (1994)), see also State v. Modest, 88 Wash. App. 239, 252, 944\n\nP.2d 417 (1997). Accordingly, we accept the State\u2019s concession and hold that the trial court erred\n\nby considering the multiple victims aggravating factor as a matter of law.\n\nD. RESENTENCING REQUIRED\n\n       We must next address whether Menzies is entitled to resentencing. We hold that reversal\n\nof the exceptional sentences and remand for resentencing is required.\n\n       \u201cWhere the reviewing court overturns one or more aggravating factors but is satisfied that\n\nthe trial court would have imposed the same sentence based upon [the remaining factor or factors],\n\nit may uphold the exceptional sentence rather than remanding for resentencing.\u201d Jackson, 150\n\nWash. 2d at 276. It must, however, be \u201cclear whether the trial court would have imposed an\n\nexceptional sentence on the basis of only the [factors] upheld.\u201d Gaines, 122 Wash. 2d at 512\n\n(emphasis added) (citing State v. Henshaw, 62 Wash. App. 135, 140, 813 P.2d 146 (1991)).\n\n       The required clarity often comes from an express statement by the trial court that a single\n\nfactor alone would be a \u201csufficient basis for the exceptional sentence imposed.\u201d State v. Harding,\n\n62 Wash. App. 245, 250, 813 P.2d 1259 (1991). But, lacking such an express statement, the record\n\nmust, at a minimum, allow us to conclude that the trial court would have imposed the same\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fNo. 51431-1-II\n\n\nsentence based on the remaining aggravating factor or factors without engaging in speculation.\n\nSee State v. Weller, 185 Wash. App. 913, 344 P.3d 695 (2015).\n\n       Here, the record shows that the trial court initially discussed only the abuse of trust and\n\nmultiple incidents aggravating factors and concluded that these factors supported exceptional\n\nsentences. Because the trial court stated that these two factors would support exceptional sentences\n\nbefore mentioning the third factor, multiple victims, we do not have to speculate to hold that the\n\ntrial court would have imposed exceptional sentences based on fewer than all three aggravating\n\nfactors. But because the trial court also acknowledged the number of victims aggravating factor\n\nbefore announcing the length of the exceptional sentences without stating how this additional\n\nfactor influenced its final sentencing decision, \u201cwe would need to speculate to hold that the trial\n\ncourt would have imposed the same exceptional sentences based on only the [remaining]\n\naggravating factor[s].\u201d Weller, 185 Wash. App. at 931 (emphasis added). Accordingly, we reverse\n\nMenzies\u2019s exceptional sentences and remand this matter back to the trial court for resentencing\n\nwithout the multiple victims aggravating factor.\n\n                                             II. LFOs\n\n       Menzies also argues that under the current law we should vacate the $200 criminal filing\n\nfee because he is indigent and strike the LFO interest provision. Because we are already remanding\n\nfor resentencing, the trial court should reconsider the LFOs in light of the current law.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fNo. 51431-1-II\n\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n        We reverse the exceptional sentences and remand to the trial court for resentencing\n\nwithout considering the multiple victim aggravating factor. On remand, the trial court should\n\nreconsider the LFOs in light of the current law.\n\n        A majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the\n\nWashington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record in accordance with RCW 2.06.040,\n\nit is so ordered.\n\n\n\n                                                        SUTTON, J.\n We concur:\n\n\n\n MELNICK, P.J.\n\n\n\n\n CRUSER, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   10\n\f",
