Plaintiffs sought damages and injunctive relief under 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the Maryland Constitution, and Maryland common\nlaw. The district court granted summary judgment to defendants on\nplaintiffs\u2019 federal claims on the grounds that defendants had not acted\nunder color of state law. It then dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 remaining state\nclaims without prejudice. Rossignol v. Voorhaar, 199 F. Supp. 2d\n279, 286-89 (2002). Because defendants sought to censor plaintiffs\u2019\ncriticism of them in their official roles, because their official positions\nwere an intimidating asset in the execution of their plan, and because\nthis sort of quasi-private conspiracy by public officials was precisely\nthe target of \u00a7 1983, we reverse the judgment and remand for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                    I.\n\n   The facts of this case are largely undisputed. St. Mary\u2019s Today is\na weekly newspaper owned by Kenneth Rossignol and primarily serv-\ning St. Mary\u2019s County in southern Maryland. It has reported exten-\n\f4                       ROSSIGNOL v. VOORHAAR\nsively and often critically on local government and public officials,\nincluding County Sheriff Richard Voorhaar and his deputies, from\n\"Captain [Steven] Doolan at the top of the rank . . . all the way to the\nbottom.\" In defendants\u2019 own words, St. Mary\u2019s Today published\n\"constant belittlement\" and \"scandalous things\" about the sheriff\u2019s\ndeputies\u2019 performance, including what they \"buy for the agency,\nequipment, [and] positions [they] ask for.\" Nor was this just \"one arti-\ncle\"; it was constantly, \"week, after week, after week.\" This criticism\nalso extended to a personal friend of Voorhaar named Richard Fritz,\na candidate for St. Mary\u2019s County State\u2019s Attorney in the November\n1998 elections who enjoyed broad support in the Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\n   Several deputies in the Sheriff\u2019s Office anticipated that the election\nday issue of St. Mary\u2019s Today would be critical of them and their\nfavored candidates, particularly Voorhaar and Fritz. Over the course\nof a series of meetings and conversations, both on the job at the Sher-\niff\u2019s Office and in the evening at private homes, some of the deputies\nformulated a plan to deal with this problem. They decided to form\ntwo teams on election day, each comprising three sheriff\u2019s deputies,\nand buy out the stock of St. Mary\u2019s Today at vending locations\nthroughout the county. They viewed the seizure as a \"good opportu-\nnity\" for two things: \"to piss [Rossignol] off\" and to \"protest [their]\ndisagreement\" with Rossignol\u2019s \"irresponsible journalism.\" They\nplanned to stage a \"bonfire party\" when the seizure was completed.\n\n   The election day issue of St. Mary\u2019s Today bore the front-page\nheadline \"Fritz Guilty of Rape.\" It accurately reported that in 1965,\nFritz and three other men had pled guilty to carnal knowledge of a\nfifteen-year-old girl. Fritz, who was eighteen at the time of the rape,\nwas sentenced to probation and a suspended sentence of eighteen\nmonths in state prison. The same article reported that Fritz\u2019s opponent\nhad been convicted of marijuana possession in 1973. Another article\nin the issue also reported an EEOC complaint which charged that\nVoorhaar had assigned a deputy who complained of sexual harass-\nment to work directly under the supervision of the harasser. Six thou-\nsand five hundred total copies of St. Mary\u2019s Today were printed:\n2,600 papers delivered to stores in St. Mary\u2019s County, 1,100 placed\nin newspaper boxes throughout the county, 1,100 delivered by mail\nto subscribers, and 1,700 distributed to other counties. Each copy cost\nseventy-five cents.\n\f                        ROSSIGNOL v. VOORHAAR                          5\n   Late on the night before the election, six sheriff\u2019s deputies set out\nin two cars. The officers were off duty, wearing plainclothes, and\ndriving their personal cars. They drove throughout the county, buying\nnewspapers from both newsboxes and local stores. To prove that they\nwere purchasing the newspapers and not stealing them, defendants got\nreceipts from the stores and videotaped themselves removing papers\nfrom newsboxes. Later that night, Rossignol discovered defendants\u2019\nplan and drove through the county attempting to resupply the stores\nand newsboxes. But defendants followed him around the county, buy-\ning up the fresh inventory as soon as it was replenished.\n\n   During the course of the mass purchase, a group of defendants met\nwith an on-duty sheriff\u2019s deputy who had contacted them on their\ndepartment-issued pagers in order to conduct official business. Some\ndefendants also stopped at a Sheriff\u2019s Office outpost to use facilities\nthere during the course of the evening. One defendant wore his Frater-\nnal Order of Police sweatshirt with the word \"Sheriff\" written on top\nof the county seal. Two other defendants carried their service weap-\nons during the mass purchase; those firearms are visible on two vid-\neotapes of the incident and were noticed by at least one eyewitness.\n\n   Many local clerks were quite familiar with county law enforcement\npersonnel because of 7-Eleven\u2019s policy of giving free coffee and soft\ndrinks to police officers, even those out of uniform. Thus, many of the\nclerks who interacted with defendants during the night knew that they\nwere sheriff\u2019s deputies. One clerk testified that he sold the full supply\nof the paper to defendants because they were police officers, had a\n\"real intimidating attitude,\" and made it \"real apparent [that] they\ncould make my life here a living hell.\" A different clerk told one of\nher store\u2019s other customers that the St. Mary\u2019s deputies were taking\nall of the papers. A manager of one 7-Eleven was told by one of her\nnight employees that \"it was a police officer [who] bought them.\" A\nclerk at another store also explained to her manager the next morning\nthat \"cops came in and bought them all.\" And a police report on the\nincident further notes that \"several of the clerks\" at convenience\nstores and a night watchman at Walmart had \"recognized some of [the\nmen involved in the seizure] as St. Mary\u2019s County Deputies.\"\n\n  The mass purchase was completed at approximately 7:00 a.m.,\ndefendants having visited roughly forty stores and forty newsboxes\n\f6                       ROSSIGNOL v. VOORHAAR\nand removed at least 1,300 copies of the paper. At least 300 more\ncopies were seized without payment from retailers who had not yet\nopened, but defendants contend that any copies taken without pay-\nment were not taken by them. One witness testified that after the mass\npurchase he could not find \"any papers anywhere in the county.\"\n\n   Both Voorhaar and Fritz personally supported and participated in\nthe mass purchase. Approximately one week before the election, one\ndeputy spoke with Voorhaar and secured his approval for the plan.\nVoorhaar approved the plan, personally contributed $500 to defray\npurchasing costs, and wished his deputies \"good luck\" on the\nendeavor. He also personally purchased multiple copies of the news-\npaper early in the morning on election day. And during the days fol-\nlowing the election, he made extensive comments in local media\ndefending and celebrating the seizure. Likewise, Fritz explicitly\napproved the plan and was directly involved in planning its imple-\nmentation and mapping out with the other defendants exactly how\nthey should proceed on the night before election day. Fritz\u2019s co-\ndefendants testified that he contributed $500 of his own money to the\nseizure; at a minimum, he served as a conduit for contributions which\nhad been given to him. He also offered legal advice to defendants\nabout the constitutionality of their plan, researching the issue before\nadvising them that it was legal under both Maryland and federal law.\n\n   Plaintiffs brought suit in November 1999, alleging violations of\ntheir rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, as\nwell as under the Maryland Constitution and at common law. After\nextensive discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary\njudgment. In February 2002, the district court granted summary judg-\nment against plaintiffs on the \u00a7 1983 claims and accordingly dis-\nmissed plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims without prejudice. Plaintiffs now\nappeal.\n\n                                   II.\n\n   As a threshold matter, there can be no question that, if defendants\nacted under color of state law, they violated these plaintiffs\u2019 constitu-\ntional rights. The seizure clearly contravened the most elemental\ntenets of First Amendment law. First, defendants targeted Rossignol\u2019s\nnewspaper for suppression and retaliation because they disagreed with\n\f                        ROSSIGNOL v. VOORHAAR                            7\nits viewpoint and intended to prevent its message from being dissemi-\nnated. This by itself was sufficient to violate the Constitution. \"It is\naxiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based on its\nsubstantive content or the message it conveys.\" Rosenberger v. Rector\nand Visitors of Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 828 (1995). And\nwhen, as here, the government targets \"not subject matter, but particu-\nlar views taken by speakers on a subject, the violation of the First\nAmendment is all the more blatant.\" Id. at 829; see also R.A.V. v. City\nof St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992).\n\n   Second, the category of speech that defendants suppressed \"occu-\npies the core of the protection afforded by the First Amendment.\"\nMcIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm\u2019n, 514 U.S. 334, 346 (1995). \"Dis-\ncussion of public issues\" and \"debate on the qualifications of candi-\ndates\" for public office have always been \"integral to the operation of\nthe system of government established by our Constitution.\" Buckley\nv. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 14 (1976) (per curiam). And \"it is by no means\neasy to see what statements about a candidate might be altogether\nwithout relevance to his fitness for the office he seeks.\" Monitor\nPatriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U.S. 265, 275 (1971) (overturning state libel\njudgment against newspaper for criticism of a political candidate\nthree days before the primary). The First Amendment therefore \"af-\nfords the broadest protection to such political expression in order \u2018to\nassure [the] unfettered interchange of ideas,\u2019\" since \"[i]n a republic\nwhere the people are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make\ninformed choices among candidates for office is essential.\" Buckley,\n424 U.S. at 14-15 (citations omitted). It is for that reason that the First\nAmendment \"has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to\nthe conduct of campaigns for political office.\" Monitor Patriot Co.,\n401 U.S. at 272. In suppressing criticism of their official conduct and\nfitness for office on the very day that voters were heading to the polls,\ndefendants did more than compromise some attenuated or penumbral\nFirst Amendment right; they struck at its heart.\n\n   Third, the fact that defendants paid for the newspapers in no way\naffects the conclusion that the seizure violated plaintiffs\u2019 right to dis-\nseminate core political speech. \"Governmental restraint on publishing\nneed not fall into familiar or traditional patterns to be subject to con-\nstitutional limitations on governmental powers.\" Miami Herald\nPubl\u2019g Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 256 (1974). The First Amend-\n\f8                       ROSSIGNOL v. VOORHAAR\nment is about more than a publisher\u2019s right to cover his costs. Indeed,\nit protects both a speaker\u2019s right to communicate information and\nideas to a broad audience and the intended recipients\u2019 right to receive\nthat information and those ideas. Bd. of Educ., Island Trees Union\nFree Sch. Dist. No. 26 v. PICO, 457 U.S. 853, 867 (1982). Liberty\nof circulation is as important to freedom of the press \"as liberty of\npublishing; indeed, without the circulation, the publication would be\nof little value.\" Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303 U.S. 444, 452 (1938)\n(quoting Ex parte Jackson, 96 U.S. 727, 733 (1877)).\n\n   It is because of the inherently communicative purpose of First\nAmendment activity that compensation in the form of lost profits is\nlegally insufficient as a remedy for the loss of First Amendment free-\ndoms. See Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74 (1976) (plurality\nopinion) (citing New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713\n(1971)). The fact that a small newspaper seeks to turn a meager profit\ndoes not remove it from the protections of the First Amendment. The\nSupreme Court has made clear that \"the degree of First Amendment\nprotection is not diminished merely because the newspaper or speech\nis sold rather than given away.\" City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer\nPubl\u2019g Co., 486 U.S. 750, 756 n.5. What matters is that defendants\nintentionally suppressed the dissemination of plaintiffs\u2019 political ideas\non the basis of their viewpoint. And in doing so before the critical\ncommentary ever reached the eyes of readers, their conduct met the\nclassic definition of a prior restraint. E.g., Near v. Minnesota, 283\nU.S. 697 (1931).\n\n                                  III.\n\n   The district court granted summary judgment for defendants on the\ngrounds that \"the mass purchase constituted private conduct not exe-\ncuted under color of state law\" as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. 199\nF. Supp. 2d 279, 289 (D. Md. 2002). In so holding, it necessarily\ndenied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment as well. We\nreview these rulings de novo. Goldstein v. Chestnut Ridge Volunteer\nFire Co., 218 F.3d 337, 340-41 (4th Cir. 2000). When faced with\ncross-motions for summary judgment, the court must review each\nmotion separately on its own merits \"to determine whether either of\nthe parties deserves judgment as a matter of law.\" Philip Morris Inc.\nv. Harshbarger, 122 F.3d 58, 62 n.4 (1st. Cir 1997) (citation and\n\f                         ROSSIGNOL v. VOORHAAR                            9\ninternal punctuation omitted). When considering each individual\nmotion, the court must take care to \"resolve all factual disputes and\nany competing, rational inferences in the light most favorable\" to the\nparty opposing that motion. Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry.\nCo., 100 F.3d 228, 230 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n   To state a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983, plaintiffs must demonstrate\nthat defendants\u2019 effort to suppress the distribution of St. Mary\u2019s\nToday was perpetrated under color of state law. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n(2002). The color of law requirement excludes from the reach of\n\u00a7 1983 all \"merely private conduct, no matter how discriminatory or\nwrongful.\" Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 50\n(1999) (citation and internal punctuation omitted). If the substance of\n\u00a7 1983 is not to be substantially eviscerated, however, \"its ambit can-\nnot be a simple line between States and people operating outside for-\nmally governmental organizations.\" Brentwood Acad. v. Tennessee\nSecondary Sch. Athletic Ass\u2019n, 531 U.S. 288, 295 (2001).1 Section\n1983 therefore includes within its scope apparently private actions\nwhich have a \"sufficiently close nexus\" with the State to be \"fairly\ntreated as that of the State itself.\" Jackson v. Metro. Edison Co., 419\nU.S. 345, 351 (1974). \"[T]here is no specific formula for defining\nstate action\" under this standard. Hicks v. Southern Maryland Health\nSys. Agency, 737 F.2d 399, 402 n.3 (4th Cir. 1984) (quoting Hower-\nton v. Gabica, 708 F.2d 380, 383 (9th Cir. 1983)). Rather, the ques-\ntion of what is fairly attributable to the State \"is a matter of normative\njudgment, and the criteria lack rigid simplicity.\" Brentwood Academy,\n531 U.S. at 295.\n\n  1\n    Brentwood and several other cases cited herein addressed the issue of\nstate action. They control our inquiry nonetheless, since if a defendant\u2019s\nconduct satisfies the state-action requirement of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment, it also constitutes action \"under color of state law\" for the purposes\nof \u00a7 1983. Id. at 295 n.2 (citing Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S.\n922, 935 (1982)). In the course of its state action inquiries, the Supreme\nCourt has not opted for an objective or subjective test, but simply for a\nlook at the totality of circumstances that might bear on the question of\nthe nexus between the challenged action and the state.\n\f10                      ROSSIGNOL v. VOORHAAR\n                                   A.\n\n   We have no doubt that the seizure in this case was perpetrated\nunder color of state law. The requisite nexus between defendants\u2019\npublic office and their actions during the seizure arose initially out of\ntheir censorial motivation. Defendants executed a systematic,\ncarefully-organized plan to suppress the distribution of St. Mary\u2019s\nToday. And they did so to retaliate against those who questioned their\nfitness for public office and who challenged many of them in the con-\nduct of their official duties. The defendants\u2019 scheme was thus a clas-\nsic example of the kind of suppression of political criticism which the\nFirst Amendment was intended to prohibit. The fact that these law\nenforcement officers acted after hours and after they had taken off\ntheir badges cannot immunize their efforts to shield themselves from\nadverse comment and to stifle public scrutiny of their performance.\nRevene v. Charles Cty. Comm\u2019rs, 882 F.2d 870, 872 (4th Cir. 1989).\n\n   To begin with, it is clear that if a defendant\u2019s purportedly private\nactions are linked to events which arose out of his official status, the\nnexus between the two can play a role in establishing that he acted\nunder color of state law. In Layne v. Sampley, 627 F.2d 12 (6th Cir.\n1980), for example, an off-duty police officer was in plain clothes,\nhad been on vacation for several days, and was sitting in his personal\ncar when he shot the plaintiff. The Sixth Circuit nonetheless held that\nthere was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant\nhad acted under color of state law, in large part because \"the animos-\nity grew out of [the officer\u2019s] performance of his official duties.\" Id.\nat 13. And in United States v. Causey, 185 F.3d 407 (5th Cir. 1999),\nthe Fifth Circuit held that a police officer had acted under color of\nstate law when he conspired with two civilians to murder a woman\nwho had filed police brutality charges against him. Important to the\ndecision was the fact that the desire to retaliate against the victim\narose out of her criticism of the defendant\u2019s actions in his official\ncapacity. Id. at 415-16.\n\n   Indeed, where the action arises out of purely personal circum-\nstances, courts have not found state action even where a defendant\ntook advantage of his position as a public officer in other ways. For\nexample, in Martinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980 (1st Cir. 1995), an on-\nduty police officer shot his coworker with a state-issued revolver\n\f                        ROSSIGNOL v. VOORHAAR                         11\nwhile they were both in the stationhouse. The court nonetheless held\nthat the defendant had not acted under color of state law because the\nshooting had arisen from a \"singularly personal frolic: tormenting an\nacquaintance,\" and because defendant\u2019s \"status as a police officer\nsimply did not enter into\" his decision to torment the victim. Id. at\n987; see also Bonsignore v. City of New York, 683 F.2d 635, 638-39\n(2d Cir. 1982) (no state action where police officer shot his wife with\na police revolver and then committed suicide).\n\n   The actions here arose out of public, not personal, circumstances.\nWhere the sole intention of a public official is to suppress speech crit-\nical of his conduct of official duties or fitness for public office, his\nactions are more fairly attributable to the state. That was the case\nhere. Defendants were enraged by what they called Rossignol\u2019s \"un-\nsavory journalism.\" And they had reason to dislike his coverage: their\ndepositions detail at length Rossignol\u2019s past attacks on their perfor-\nmance of official duties. They were also convinced that St. Mary\u2019s\nToday would print election day attacks on \"Voorhaar [or] anybody\nthat was not on [Rossignol\u2019s] ticket.\" So they decided both to punish\nRossignol\u2019s previous speech by \"piss[ing] him off\" and to suppress\nhis expected election day criticism of Sheriff Voorhaar\u2019s performance\nin office. Defendants\u2019 statements on the videotapes recorded that eve-\nning further emphasize their desire to \"cleanse the filth\" printed in the\nnewspaper and prevent the \"pack of lies\" from being circulated.\nAmong other comparable comments, one deputy said, \"you call us\nidiots, Rossignol? We\u2019ll show you. . . . We\u2019ll show you, Rossignol;\nthat\u2019s all I got to say.\" Another deputy stated that \"we don\u2019t believe\nin blasphemy being published, so we\u2019re buying them all.\"\n\n   In their scheme to silence disrespectful speech, defendants seemed\ncalled to resurrect the discredited concept of a criminal libel, which\nwas broadly invoked in seventeenth and eighteenth century England\nto silence adverse comment on public personages, all in the name of\npreserving \"the King\u2019s peace.\" As one historian has noted, however,\nthe King\u2019s peace was \"as wide a phrase as the King\u2019s English. To dis-\nturb the King\u2019s peace of mind was probably a breach of the King\u2019s\npeace. . . . [A criminal libel] might bring institutions or prominent\npersons into contempt, or hatred, or ridicule.\" William H. Wickwar,\nThe Struggle for the Freedom of the Press 20 (1928). It goes without\nsaying that this stigmatization of speech critical of public officials\n\f12                      ROSSIGNOL v. VOORHAAR\nwas among the chief evils that the First Amendment sought to com-\nbat.\n\n   Ultimately, defendants were driven by a desire to retaliate against\nRossignol\u2019s past criticism of their fitness for office and to censor\nfuture criticism along the same lines. This link between the seizure\u2019s\npurpose and defendants\u2019 official roles helps demonstrate that defen-\ndants\u2019 actions bore a \"sufficiently close nexus\" with the State to be\n\"fairly treated as that of the State itself.\" Jackson v. Metro. Edison\nCo., 419 U.S. at 351.2\n\n                                    B.\n\n   Several additional factors reinforce our conviction that defendants\nacted under color of state law.\n\n   Among these was defendants\u2019 ability to use their positions in the\nSheriff\u2019s Department to ensure that they would not be prosecuted for\ntheir election day seizure. Under Maryland law, the Newspaper Theft\nAct prohibits \"knowingly or willfully obtain[ing] or exert[ing] control\nthat is unauthorized over newspapers with the intent to prevent\nanother from reading the newspapers.\" Md. Code, Criminal Law \u00a7 7-\n106(b) (2002) (recodified version of law in effect during the seizure).\nThe Act was passed to criminalize such events as the St. Mary\u2019s\nToday seizure: mass censorship-oriented appropriations of newspa-\npers which cannot otherwise be punished as theft. See Thomas W.\nWaldron, \"Pilfered Papers: If a Crime, What Punishment?\", Balt. Sun,\nJan. 5, 1994, at 1B (discussing history leading to passage of Act);\nEditorial, \"Can You \u2018Steal\u2019 a Free Paper?\", Wash. Post, Jan. 22, 1994,\nat A16 (same). In other words, defendants\u2019 efforts to prevent St.\nMary\u2019s County readers from reading Rossignol\u2019s newspaper put them\nin direct peril of criminal prosecution under Maryland law.\n  2\n   The principal case defendants cite in opposing this conclusion is not\ncontrolling here. See Hughes v. Halifax Cty. Sch. Bd., 855 F.2d 183 (4th\nCir. 1988). Its brief and factbound discussion of state action focused on\ndefendants\u2019 spur-of-the-moment harassment of a coworker in the work-\nplace rather than a conspiracy to suppress by prior restraint the distribu-\ntion of election day political speech.\n\f                        ROSSIGNOL v. VOORHAAR                          13\n   Voorhaar\u2019s position as Sheriff, however, gave him the ability to\nhelp shield his coworkers from the consequences of their crime\nthrough both formal direction of his department\u2019s investigations and\ninformal ties to other law enforcement agencies. And his personal\ncontribution of $500 made Voorhaar part of the conspiracy and served\nas a bond of solidarity with the other deputies involved in the seizure.\nResting on the powers of his public office and his own self-interest\nin avoiding prosecution, Voorhaar\u2019s sanction operated as a concrete\nassurance that the rest of the defendants would be shielded from crim-\ninal repercussions by the cloak of state protection. This in turn meant\nthat the St. Mary\u2019s County Sheriff Department \"did more than adopt\na passive position\" towards the seizure, Chestnut Ridge, 218 F.3d at\n342 (quoting Skinner v. Ry. Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n., 489 U.S. 602,\n615 (1989)), and instead gave \"significant encouragement\" to its per-\npetrators. Mentavlos v. Anderson, 249 F.3d 301, 311 (4th Cir. 2001)\n(quoting Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., 526 U.S. at 52).\n\n   Additionally, the deputies\u2019 identities as state officers played a role\nat several points during the seizure itself. They were recognized as\npolice officers by store employees throughout the county. They were\ncarrying their state-issued firearms, and some of those firearms were\nvisible during the evening. And one of them was wearing a Fraternal\nOrder of the Police sweatshirt. It is no surprise, then, that at least one\nclerk was intimidated into selling his entire run of newspapers by the\ndeputies\u2019 authority as state officials. When the deputies first tried to\nbuy all the papers, he said \"y\u2019all can\u2019t do that because other people\nwant to read them.\" The clerk later testified, however, that while the\ndeputies made no explicit threats, \"they basically came off real intimi-\ndating\" and \"made it real apparent . . . if I didn\u2019t sell it to them, then\nthey could make my life here a living hell. . . . [I]t wouldn\u2019t be that\nhard [for them] to set [me] up for something.\" Cf. Bantam Books, Inc.\nv. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 68 (1963) (noting that \"[p]eople do not\nlightly disregard public officers\u2019 thinly veiled threats\").\n\n   The effect of a police presence on a store owner or clerk is not hard\nto imagine. Proprietors of small stores often feel a keen need to stay\non the right side of local law enforcement. They depend heavily on\nprompt responses by the police to their calls, as well as on freedom\nfrom harassment and other unnecessary difficulties with the police.\nSee, e.g., Turner v. Dammon, 848 F.2d 440, 442-43, 445-47 (4th Cir.\n\f14                      ROSSIGNOL v. VOORHAAR\n1988). The 7-Eleven policy of giving free coffee and soft drinks to\nsheriff\u2019s deputies, for example, is driven by a desire for good relations\nwith the local police. The strength of this interest is amply confirmed\nby the willingness of the convenience stores in this case to sell their\nentire run of newspapers to the police at one stroke, even to their\npotential economic detriment. Running out of newspapers risked\noffending other customers and cutting off a significant flow of ancil-\nlary business: a major reason to sell newspapers is to attract custom-\ners into the store in the first place, thereby leading them to buy other\nitems that they otherwise might not have purchased there.\n\n   In sum, the nexus between defendants\u2019 actions and the state arose\nfrom more than just defendants\u2019 desire to still criticism of their public\nperformance. Their status as sheriff\u2019s deputies enabled them to exe-\ncute their scheme in a manner that private citizens never could have.\n\n                                   C.\n\n   Finally, both the First Amendment and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 exist in\nsignificant part to deter the kind of misdeeds perpetrated by defen-\ndants on election day. The First Amendment was drafted in the con-\ntext of a lengthy history of censorship carried out by private\norganizations with complicated ties to the state apparatus and compel-\nling motives to suppress speech unfavorable to the Crown. The Statio-\nners\u2019 Company was a private guild of printers with its origins in\nmedieval England; it was granted valuable monopolies and privileges\nby the government. Fredrick Seaton Siebert, Freedom of the Press in\nEngland, 1476-1776, at 64-66, 135 (1952). In exchange for the assur-\nance of this valued status, the Stationer\u2019s Company acted as a vigor-\nous censor, searching printing houses both for material which violated\nthe Company\u2019s own monopolistic privileges and for material consid-\nered dangerous to the Crown. Id.; see also Cyprian Blagden, The Sta-\ntioners\u2019 Company: A History, 1403-1959, at 20-21, 32-33 (1960). The\ndrafters of the First Amendment knew full well that censorship is\nequally virulent whether carried out by official representatives of the\nstate or by private individuals acting out of a self-interested hope in\nreceiving or maintaining benefits from the state. Historical experience\nflatly belies defendants\u2019 argument that the First Amendment cannot\napply to their censorial seizure because they were not wearing state\nuniforms.\n\f                       ROSSIGNOL v. VOORHAAR                        15\n   Similarly, defendants\u2019 conspiracy bears many of the hallmarks of\nthe civil rights violations that prompted the passage of \u00a7 1983. That\nstatute was enacted principally to deal with conspiracies between\nlocal law enforcement officers and private individuals \u2014 typically via\nthe Ku Klux Klan \u2014 to violate the rights of former slaves. The sup-\nporters of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 saw a criminal justice system \"under the\ncontrol of those who are wholly inimical to the impartial administra-\ntion of law and equity,\" and asked \"[w]hat benefit would result from\nappeal to . . . officers [who] are secretly in sympathy with the very\nevil against which we are striving?\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st\nSess. 394 (1871) (statement of Rep. Rainey). see also Monroe v.\nPape, 365 U.S. 167, 171-87 (1961). Congress had no doubt about the\ncomplicity of those who in their official capacities promoted the sub-\nterfuge of private arrangements to accomplish constitutionally imper-\nmissible ends. Indeed, \"without concert, understanding, and\narrangement,\" it \"could not be possible that all should be acquitted\nwho were arrested. It could not happen that in some localities a vast\nnumber of these crimes were committed and no one arrested. . . .\nThese things do not occur thus accidentally.\" Cong. Globe, 42d\nCong., 1st Sess. 459 (1871) (statement of Rep. Coburn). The whole\npurpose of the Ku Klux Klan Act was to prevent public authorities\nfrom violating constitutional rights through the use of nominally pri-\nvate means. Whether the rights be those of small papers and their\nreaders or those of freedmen is not dispositive. The unlawfulness of\nprivate infringement of those rights under color of state law remains\nthe same.\n\n   We would thus lose sight of the entire purpose of \u00a7 1983 if we held\nthat defendants were not acting under color of state law. Here, a local\nsheriff, joined by a candidate for State\u2019s Attorney, actively encour-\naged and sanctioned the organized censorship of his political oppo-\nnents by his subordinates, contributed money to support that\ncensorship, and placed the blanket of his protection over the perpetra-\ntors. Sheriffs who removed their uniforms and acted as members of\nthe Klan were not immune from \u00a7 1983; the conduct here, while dif-\nferent, also cannot be absolved by the simple expedient of removing\nthe badge.3\n  3\n    Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the \"color of law\" issue\nis inextricably intertwined with defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion\n\f16                       ROSSIGNOL v. VOORHAAR\n                                    IV.\n\n   The incident in this case may have taken place in America, but it\nbelongs to a society much different and more oppressive than our\nown. If we were to sanction this conduct, we would point the way for\nother state officials to stifle public criticism of their policies and their\nperformance. And we would leave particularly vulnerable this kind of\npaper in this kind of community. Alternative weeklies such as St.\nMary\u2019s Today may stir deep ire in the objects of their irreverence, but\nwe can hardly say on that account that they play no useful part in the\npolitical dialogue. No doubt the public has formed over time its opin-\nion of the paper\u2019s responsibility and reputation. If defendants believed\nits attacks to be scurrilous, their remedy was either to undertake their\nown response or to initiate a defamation action. It was not for law\nenforcement to summon the organized force of the sheriff\u2019s office to\nthe cause of censorship and dispatch deputies on the errands of sup-\npression in the dead of night.\n\n   The judgment of the district court is therefore reversed and the case\nis remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                          REVERSED AND REMANDED\n\non that same question, because they each rest on identical factual and\nlegal issues. The First Amendment inquiry is likewise inextricably inter-\ntwined with defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, since the same retal-\niatory suppression of core political speech lies at the heart of each. See\nSwint v. Chambers Cty. Comm\u2019n, 514 U.S. 35, 50-51 (1995) (appellate\ncourts may review issues that are \"inextricably intertwined\" with another\nissue properly on appeal). However, the questions of qualified immunity,\nmunicipal liability, the extent to which defendant\u2019s conduct is actionable\nunder the Maryland Constitution and Maryland common law, and the\nextent to which defendant Alioto participated in the seizure have not\nbeen fully briefed by the parties and have not been shown to be inextrica-\nbly intertwined with the issue properly before the court as required by\nSwint. These issues must be addressed by the district court on remand.\n\f",
