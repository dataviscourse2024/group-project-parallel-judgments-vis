Effler, District Attorney General; and Graham Wilson and\nCourtney Stanifer, Assistant District Attorneys General, for the appellee, State of\nTennessee.\n\f                                        OPINION\n\n                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        The Defendant was charged with two counts of rape of a child after the seven-\nyear-old victim disclosed sexual abuse to her older sister. The victim gave a forensic\ninterview in which she recounted that the Defendant put his tongue in her mouth and\nforced her to perform fellatio in her mother\u2019s bedroom and in her bedroom. The trial\ncourt admitted the recorded interview over the Defendant\u2019s objection. At trial, the victim\ntestified that she no longer recalled some of the events she recounted in her forensic\ninterview, but she testified regarding one instance of rape occurring in her mother\u2019s\nbedroom. On appeal, the Defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to support\nthe rape occurring in the victim\u2019s bedroom, that the trial court erred by failing to make\nspecific findings of fact to support the admission of the interview, and that the video did\nnot possess particularized guarantees of trustworthiness and was accordingly admitted in\nerror.\n\n        In August 2017, the victim lived with her three siblings: two older brothers and a\nthirteen-year-old sister. The victim\u2019s father had recently been arrested and jailed. The\nvictim\u2019s mother had moved out of the home to live in a nearby town with a boyfriend. In\nthe absence of the children\u2019s mother, the children\u2019s maternal aunt moved in to help care\nfor them. The children\u2019s aunt brought her family, consisting of the Defendant, who was\nher boyfriend, and their child. According to the victim\u2019s sister, the Defendant and the\nvictim\u2019s aunt lived with the children for \u201c[m]aybe a year.\u201d The victim\u2019s sister testified at\ntrial that she shared a room with the victim, that their room had a bed, and that the boys\nshared a separate room. The victim\u2019s paternal grandparents visited the children\nfrequently, usually after attending church. The victim\u2019s grandmother at first agreed that\nthe Defendant had been staying with the children only two to three weeks before the\nallegation of abuse, but later testified it was \u201cmuch longer\u201d and elaborated it was a period\nof months.\n\n       The victim was nine years old at the time of trial, and she testified that she knew\nthe difference between the truth and a lie. She identified the video of the forensic\ninterview, and the video was played at trial.\n\n       In the video, Ms. Bobbie Womack, a forensic interviewer at the Campbell County\nChildren\u2019s Center, asked the victim if she knew the difference between the truth and a lie.\nThe victim, who was absorbed in coloring, did not answer at first, and after a pause,\nshrugged her shoulders. Ms. Womack told the victim that they could only talk about real\nthings in the room, and she held up a blue crayon and asked the victim if it would be \u201creal\nor not real\u201d if someone said the crayon was pink. The victim shook her head and\n                                           -2-\n\fidentified the crayon as blue. She agreed she would only talk with Ms. Womack about\nthings that were real or had really happened.\n\n       The victim gave a brief account of her family, including her father\u2019s arrest. She\nsaid that when the police arrived, \u201cthey said, \u2018You\u2019re surrounded.\u2019 No, they didn\u2019t say,\n\u2018You\u2019re surrounded.\u2019 They \u2026 stopped at my house and we ran outside and then my\nmom put me in the bedroom and then we cried because they put my dad in jail.\u201d\n\n       Asked if something had happened to cause her to be brought to the Campbell\nCounty Children\u2019s Center, the victim said, \u201cSomebody, \u2026 he sticked his bad spot in my\nmouth and then he kissed me on the lips. Then he sticked his tongue in my mouth.\u201d The\nvictim identified the Defendant, whom she described as her uncle, as the perpetrator.\nDuring the interview, the victim drew a picture of the \u201cbad spot,\u201d which resembled a\npenis.\n\n        The victim said that \u201cthis happened\u201d \u201c[m]ore than one time. It happened three\ntimes. In my mom\u2019s bathroom, in her bedroom, and in the living room. That\u2019s where he\nkissed me on the lips and sticked his tongue in my mouth.\u201d The victim then added, \u201cAnd\nit also happened in the bedroom, my bedroom.\u201d Ms. Womack asked the victim to tell\nabout the first time that \u201cthis happened,\u201d and the victim said, \u201cIt was the other day.\u201d She\ntold Ms. Womack that her mother was not in the home, that her aunt was \u201cgone,\u201d and that\nher cousin was outside playing. The victim was in the house watching YouTube when\nthe Defendant entered. The victim told Ms. Womack, \u201cHe said come here, \u2026and I said\nno, and he said come here, and then he screamed at me, and then I ran into my mommy\u2019s\nbedroom, and then he caught me, and then that happened.\u201d Asked to elaborate, the\nvictim said, \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Ms. Womack recalled that the victim had said the Defendant put\nhis \u201cbad spot\u201d in her mouth and asked, \u201cSo is that what happened when you were in your\nmom\u2019s bedroom or was -- did something else happen?\u201d The victim responded, \u201cIt was\nin the living room.\u201d Ms. Womack summarized what the victim had stated about being\n\u201ccaught\u201d by the Defendant in her mother\u2019s room, and the victim clarified, \u201cI stayed in my\nmommy\u2019s bedroom trying to hide \u2013 finding somewhere to hide and then he caught me\u2026.\nHe sticked his bad spot in my mouth and then he \u2013 and then that was in my \u2013 the\nbathroom and then it was in the living room, he kissed me on the lips and sticked his\ntongue in my mouth.\u201d The victim added, \u201cAnd then it was in my \u2013 in the hallway I think\nor it was in my bedroom.\u201d The victim stated that these things happened on different\ndays when she was seven years old.\n\n       She confirmed multiple times that the Defendant put his \u201cbad spot\u201d in her mouth\nin her mother\u2019s bedroom. She said she tried to bite it and accidentally let go. She said\nthat she had her clothes on and that she took them off because they were itching her. The\nDefendant had his clothes on, but the victim told Ms. Womack that the Defendant did\n                                           -3-\n\f\u201cthat,\u201d demonstrating pulling on the front of her pants. She clarified that he unbuttoned\nhis pants. The victim stated the Defendant made her suck and lick his \u201cbad spot,\u201d but\nthat nothing happened to it or came out of it. She stated that it felt \u201cyucky\u201d \u201clike chewing\ngum.\u201d The victim told Ms. Womack that the Defendant had told her that if she told\nanybody, \u201ceven include[ing] the DCS, it will get even worser.\u201d\n\n       Asked to tell what happened in \u201cyour bedroom,\u201d the victim said, \u201cHe sticked his\nbad spot in my mouth.\u201d Ms. Womack repeated \u201cHe stuck it in your mouth?\u201d The victim\nanswered, \u201cUh-huh (affirmative).\u201d She said that no one witnessed these events. Asked if\nthis had happened to anyone else, the victim responded, \u201cNo, just me. Why did he have\nto pick me?\u201d\n\n       At one point in the interview, the victim told Ms. Womack that the Defendant\ncame into the bathroom while she was urinating. When asked later to elaborate on what\nhappened in the bathroom, the victim said that the Defendant told her \u201cYou\u2019re all right,\u201d\nand then let her go and closed the door. She clarified that the Defendant did not put his\n\u201cbad spot\u201d in her mouth and kiss her in the bathroom and that \u201csomething different\u201d also\ndid not happen in the bathroom.\n\n        The victim recounted that after the rape in her mother\u2019s bedroom, the Defendant\nlet her go and she ran outside to cry to her sister. In the forensic interview, the victim\ndescribed the disclosure to her sister as follows: \u201cAnd she said, \u2018What?\u2019 and then I said,\n\u2018Nothing.\u2019 And she said, \u2018[Victim], you\u2019re shaking.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Okay, okay. [The\nDefendant] sticked \u2026 his bad spot in my mouth, then he kissed me on the lips, and then\nhe sticked his tongue in my mouth.\u2019\u201d The victim said that she walked around with her\nsister and that her sister promised to hurt the Defendant if he assaulted the victim again.\n\n       At one point in the interview, Ms. Womack stepped out, and the victim amused\nherself with mirrored circles which were attached to the walls. She opened her mouth\nand looked inside and said to herself, \u201cCavities. It\u2019s looking good.\u201d She continued to\ntalk about cavities and to look inside her mouth. When Ms. Womack returned, Ms.\nWomack asked, \u201cYou looking at yourself in the mirrors?\u201d The victim responded, \u201cNo,\u201d\nand volunteered, \u201c I have one big cavity and two small ones.\u201d\n\n       At trial, the victim testified that there were things mentioned in the video which\nshe did not remember. She did not remember if the Defendant put his tongue in her\nmouth, if something happened in the bathroom, or anything that occurred in her bedroom.\nShe did not recall if the things she mentioned on the video happened on one day or more\nthan one day. She confirmed that her bedroom and her mother\u2019s bedroom were separate\nrooms. She also testified that she slept in a chair in the living room because she did not\n\n                                           -4-\n\fhave a bed in her bedroom and said that her brothers and sister also slept in the living\nroom.\n\n        The victim testified that when she was in her mother\u2019s room, the Defendant asked\nher to suck and lick his \u201cbad spot.\u201d She demonstrated what happened. She testified that\nafter she left her mother\u2019s bedroom, she told her sister about the abuse.\n\n      On cross-examination, the victim agreed that she did not like living with the\nDefendant and her aunt. Defense counsel asked, \u201c[The Defendant] wasn\u2019t very nice, was\nhe?\u201d The victim responded, \u201cA little bit.\u201d The victim was unhappy that her mother left\nthe home, and she did not like her mother\u2019s boyfriend. She denied having previously\naccused her father or another person of touching her inappropriately.\n\n        Ms. Womack testified at trial regarding her training and qualifications. The\nvictim\u2019s drawing of the Defendant\u2019s \u201cbad spot\u201d and a drawing the victim made of herself\non the couch with a tablet were introduced into evidence. Ms. Womack testified that in a\nforensic interview, it is preferable to have the child give a narrative as opposed to\nanswering \u201cyes or no\u201d questions. She agreed that the victim said she did not know the\ndifference between the truth and a lie at the beginning of the interview and that she had to\nask the victim about an example of what was real or not real. She agreed that in the\nvideo, the victim \u201ctalks a lot, but she doesn\u2019t talk a lot about one specific thing.\u201d Ms.\nWomack acknowledged that the victim said the abuse took place three times but listed\nfour places where it took place. She agreed that from that point in the interview, she\nasked many \u201cyes or no\u201d questions. The victim at first asserted police said, \u201cYou are\nsurrounded,\u201d during her father\u2019s arrest, and the victim later said that did not happen. Ms.\nWomack agreed that the victim said she was not looking at herself in the mirror and that\nthis was untrue. She also agreed that the victim never said, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d and only\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d once. She agreed that the victim gave inconsistent accounts of\nwhat happened on the couch. Ms. Womack helped the victim prepare for trial by\nconducting a mock trial three to four times. On redirect examination, she testified she\nfelt the victim\u2019s behavior in the interview was typical for a seven-year-old child.\n\n        The victim\u2019s sister confirmed the victim\u2019s account of the familial relationships and\ndisclosure. She testified that she was at the \u201cball goal\u201d with her two brothers and cousin\nwhile the victim was inside playing on the tablet. The children\u2019s aunt was at Walmart,\nand the Defendant was in the house. The victim came outside, visibly shaking and with\nthe back of her underwear hanging out. The victim seemed frightened. The victim\ndisclosed the abuse, and the victim\u2019s sister took the victim on a walk until the children\u2019s\naunt returned. The victim\u2019s sister did not tell their aunt about the abuse because she did\nnot think their aunt would believe her. She knew that her grandparents would come by\nlater that day, after church, and she told them when they arrived. The victim likewise\n                                           -5-\n\ftestified that her sister told her grandparents about the abuse the same day it happened.\nThe victim\u2019s sister testified that she found out about the abuse in the morning and that her\ngrandparents also came by in the morning. She said that the victim told her that \u201cthis\nhappened\u201d twice. According to the victim\u2019s sister, the abuse occurred one time\npreviously to the time the victim disclosed the abuse. The victim\u2019s sister agreed that the\nvictim went into the house alone with the Defendant after one alleged instance of abuse.\nShe said that the victim was in the house approximately twenty minutes prior to her\ndisclosure.\n\n       The victim\u2019s sister denied making up the allegations to induce the Defendant to\nleave. She said she got along with the Defendant \u201c[k]ind of.\u201d She did not ever hear her\nbrothers claim the Defendant hit them and did not see the Defendant hit them.\n\n       The victim\u2019s paternal grandmother testified that she was told about the abuse by\nthe victim and the victim\u2019s sister when she visited them after either the Saturday night\nchurch business meeting or the Sunday service. The victim\u2019s grandmother testified that\nher understanding was that \u201cthese things\u201d \u201capparently\u201d happened a day or two before the\ndisclosure. She said that the victim told her \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t just happen one time, it\nhappened on two or three other times, too.\u201d She did not report the abuse to law\nenforcement because she was afraid of the Defendant and his family and also worried that\nthe Department of Children\u2019s Services (\u201cDCS\u201d) would take the children away if the\nabuse were reported. Instead, on the day after the disclosure, the children\u2019s grandparents\nconcocted a story that the landlord was on his way to the house and that the Defendant\nand the children\u2019s aunt had to leave. The Defendant and the children\u2019s aunt left the home\nto avoid the purported visit of the landlord, and the children\u2019s mother came to stay with\nthe children for one day. After the disclosure, the children\u2019s grandfather moved in with\nthe children to care for them while the children\u2019s grandmother remained at the\ngrandparents\u2019 residence, where she was caring for her own aging parents.\n\n       The victim\u2019s sister ultimately told the children\u2019s adult cousin about the abuse\nthrough Facebook messenger. The cousin testified that she saw a prayer request for the\nvictim through Facebook and asked the victim\u2019s sister about the request through a private\nmessage. After she learned of the allegations of abuse, she called the police. She asked\nto remain anonymous because she was afraid of the Defendant\u2019s family.\n\n       On August 20, 2017, law enforcement came to the children\u2019s home and spoke with\nthe victim\u2019s grandmother. The victim\u2019s grandmother testified that the children had told\nher about the abuse on a Saturday or Sunday and that Officer Hurley1 came to the house\n\n\n       1\n           Officer Hurley\u2019s first name was not given.\n                                                   -6-\n\fthe following Sunday. The victim\u2019s grandmother acknowledged that when the officer\ntold her about the allegation that the Defendant touched the victim, she responded,\n\u201c[T]hat\u2019s what she says.\u201d The victim\u2019s grandmother had always believed the victim was\ntruthful about the abuse. She agreed that the investigating officer never got out of his car.\nHe was \u201c[m]aybe\u201d at the home for over thirty minutes, and she did not recall talking to\nany other officers.\n\n        The Defendant presented the testimony of his father, Mr. Bobby Lovin, Sr., who\nstated that during the time the Defendant lived with the children, he visited the Defendant\n\u201c[m]ost every day.\u201d He would arrive around 1:00 p.m. and stay until around 4:30 or 5:00\np.m. The last weekend that the Defendant lived in the home, the Defendant\u2019s father was\nthere on both Friday and Saturday. He testified that he was also there on Sunday and that\nSunday was the day the Defendant left the home. He did not see anything unusual occur\nbetween the victim and the Defendant, and the victim was not acting unusual or acting\nnervous. He stated that the children had a good relationship with the Defendant and that\nthey did not hate the Defendant.\n\n       Detective Gary Ruszkowski testified that he was the only investigator in New\nTazewell and that he accordingly investigated all sorts of criminal activity. He did not\ninterview the victim in this case and did not go inside the home or ask her to show him\nwhere the abuse occurred. He stated he was already familiar with the layout of the home\nand that, as a large man, he felt he would intimidate the victim if he attempted to speak\nwith her about the abuse. He did not attempt to collect physical evidence because he did\nnot think there would be any to collect. He was present during the forensic interviews of\nthe children, and he suggested questions for Ms. Womack during the break in the\ninterview. He said that he spoke with the victim\u2019s grandmother and that she was\nmistaken when she testified she only spoke with Officer Hurley. He acknowledged that\nhe did not take a written statement from either grandparent. He attempted to contact the\nchildren\u2019s mother, but she did not ever agree to speak with him. He did not speak with\nthe cousin who reported the abuse because she requested to remain anonymous when she\ncalled 911 and he was unaware of her identity until a few weeks before trial. Because he\ndid not know who reported the abuse, he did not retrieve the messages between the\nvictim\u2019s sister and cousin. He also did not retrieve video footage from Walmart showing\nthat the victim\u2019s aunt was at Walmart during the rape in the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s bedroom.\nHe stated that the victim\u2019s aunt had acknowledged that she was at Walmart during the\nrelevant time.\n\n       The jury convicted the Defendant of two counts of rape of a child. At the\nsentencing hearing, the State introduced a recording of a telephone call made by the\nDefendant during the trial. In the call, the Defendant incorrectly tells a woman that the\ncourt said it would dismiss the case if the jury were to see the facility dog which was\n                                            -7-\n\fpresent when the victim testified. The Defendant urges the woman to buy a dog whistle\nbefore coming to court and to blow it. After applying enhancement and mitigating\nfactors, the trial court imposed a Range II, thirty-two-year sentence for each conviction.\nThe court ordered the sentences to be served consecutively for an effective sixty-four-\nyear sentence. The Defendant moved for a new trial, raising issues including the\nsufficiency of the evidence, the trial court\u2019s failure to make specific findings of fact\nregarding the forensic interview, and the court\u2019s admission of the interview, which the\nDefendant asserted did not show particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. The court\nfound it had determined \u201cthat the State satisfied the statutory\u201d requisites, and it denied the\nmotion. The Defendant appeals.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n                               I. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       The Defendant asserts that the victim\u2019s forensic interview does not support his\nconviction for the rape of a child occurring in the victim\u2019s bedroom. The State responds\nthat the evidence is sufficient. We conclude that the victim\u2019s statement in the forensic\ninterview is sufficient to support the conviction.\n\n        This court must set aside a finding of guilt if the evidence is insufficient to support\nthe finding by the trier of fact of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Tenn. R. App. P.\n13(e). The question before the appellate court is whether, after viewing the evidence in\nthe light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found the\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Pope, 427 S.W.3d\n363, 368 (Tenn. 2013). This court will not reweigh or reevaluate the evidence, and it\nmay not substitute its inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence for those drawn by\nthe trier of fact. State v. Smith, 436 S.W.3d 751, 764 (Tenn. 2014). The jury\u2019s guilty\nverdict, approved by the trial judge, accredits the State\u2019s witnesses and resolves all\nconflicts in favor of the prosecution. State v. Reid, 91 S.W.3d 247, 277 (Tenn. 2002).\nThe trier of fact is entrusted with determinations concerning witness credibility, factual\nfindings, and the weight and value of evidence. Smith, 436 S.W.3d at 764. In reviewing\nthe sufficiency of the evidence, we afford the State the strongest legitimate view of the\nevidence and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence. State v.\nHawkins, 406 S.W.3d 121, 131 (Tenn. 2013). \u201cA verdict of guilt removes the\npresumption of innocence and replaces it with a presumption of guilt, and on appeal the\ndefendant has the burden of illustrating why the evidence is insufficient to support the\nverdict rendered by the jury.\u201d Reid, 91 S.W.3d at 277. In reviewing the sufficiency of\nthe evidence, this court examines the relevant statutes and analyzes the evidence at trial\nto determine whether each element of the offense is supported by adequate proof. State\nv. Stephens, 521 S.W.3d 718, 723 (Tenn. 2017).\n                                             -8-\n\f        The Defendant was convicted of two counts of rape of a child. \u201cRape of a child is\nthe unlawful sexual penetration of a victim by the defendant or the defendant by a victim,\nif the victim is more than three (3) years of age but less than thirteen (13) years of age.\u201d\nT.C.A. \u00a7 39-13-522 (2017). Sexual penetration includes fellatio. T.C.A. \u00a7 39-13-501(7).\nHere, the Defendant does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence for the offense\noccurring in the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s bedroom, and indeed, the victim stated both in the\nforensic interview and in her trial testimony that the Defendant forced her to perform\nfellatio in her mother\u2019s bedroom.\n\n        The Defendant challenges his conviction for the act of rape of a child occurring in\nthe victim\u2019s bedroom. He asserts that her trial testimony that she and her siblings slept in\nchairs in the living room makes it unclear whether she considered the living room to be\nher bedroom. We note that the evidence included testimony from both the victim and her\nsister that they had a bedroom and testimony from the victim\u2019s sister that it contained a\nbed, but in any event, the jury was not required to find that the victim\u2019s bedroom was any\nparticular physical space. The State presented evidence that the Defendant forced the\nvictim to perform fellatio in a room she described as her bedroom, and this was sufficient\nto distinguish the counts of the indictment.\n\n       The Defendant contends that the victim \u201cnever made specific statements\u201d during\nthe forensic interview or trial regarding a rape in her bedroom. During the forensic\ninterview, the victim initially listed her bedroom as one of the places where \u201csomething\u201d\nhappened. After asking the victim about events in her mother\u2019s bedroom and the\nbathroom, Ms. Womack said, \u201cHow about when you were in your bedroom; tell me about\nwhat happened in your bedroom.\u201d The victim responded, \u201cHe sticked his bad spot in my\nmouth.\u201d Ms. Womack repeated the victim\u2019s answer as a question, and the victim\nanswered, \u201cUh-huh (affirmative).\u201d The victim did not remember the offense occurring in\nher bedroom at the time of trial. Although the victim only stated that the Defendant\nraped her in her bedroom at one point in the interview and although she did not remember\nthe incident at trial, we are required on appeal to review the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the State. Pope, 427 S.W.3d at 368. The jury was entitled to credit the\nstatement the victim made during the forensic interview that the Defendant put his \u201cbad\nspot\u201d in her mouth in her bedroom.\n\n       The Defendant asserts that the inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the forensic\ninterview raise reasonable doubt regarding the second offense. See State v. Elkins, 102\nS.W.3d 578, 582-83 (Tenn. 2003) (\u201c[A] jury\u2019s verdict will not be overturned unless there\nare inaccuracies or inconsistencies that \u2018are so improbable or unsatisfactory as to create a\nreasonable doubt of the [defendant\u2019s] guilt.\u2019\u201d (quoting State v. Radley, 29 S.W.3d 532,\n537 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999))). He argues that the level of detail the victim gave\n                                           -9-\n\fregarding the rape in her mother\u2019s bedroom casts doubt on the rape in the victim\u2019s\nbedroom, because her account was less detailed. However, he cites to no legal authority\nthat the descriptions of the two offenses must be comparably detailed. He also asserts\nthat the victim\u2019s initial statement that something happened in the bathroom and her later\nstatement that nothing that \u201cwas not supposed to happen\u201d happened in the bathroom are\nan irreconcilable contradiction warranting overturning one of his convictions. However,\nwe note that any contradiction did not concern the instance of rape in the victim\u2019s\nbedroom. Furthermore, the victim had earlier said that the Defendant came into the\nbathroom while she was urinating. The victim, not being an authority on criminal\nliability, told Ms. Womack about all of the Defendant\u2019s transgressions, from opening the\nbathroom door while she was urinating, to kissing her on the mouth, to rape. The\nDefendant also argues that the victim\u2019s statements were inconsistent because when Ms.\nWomack asked if the Defendant kissed her and put his tongue in her mouth only in the\nliving room or in other places, she answered, \u201cOther places,\u201d but when asked to tell about\nthe other places, she said that he put his tongue in her mouth in the living room and then\nput his \u201cbad spot\u201d in her mouth in her mother\u2019s room. While the victim\u2019s narrative of the\nabuse is not always entirely clear in the interview, neither is her narrative so inconsistent\nor contradictory that it creates reasonable doubt, as a matter of law, regarding the second\ninstance of rape. The victim stated during the forensic interview that the Defendant put\nhis \u201cbad spot\u201d in her mouth in her bedroom, and she did not ever contradict that\nstatement. Accordingly, the evidence is sufficient.\n\n                        II. Admission of the Forensic Interview\n\n       The Defendant argues that the trial court did not make adequate factual findings\nregarding the required statutory factors that the video had particularized guarantees of\ntrustworthiness and that this court should review the issue de novo. The State responds\nthat the trial court made proper findings and that the Defendant did not\ncontemporaneously object to the trial court\u2019s lack of findings. The Defendant responds\nthat he argued during the hearing against the factors necessary to find the interview\ntrustworthy at trial. We conclude that the record supports the conclusion that the video\ncontained particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, and it was accordingly properly\nadmitted.\n\n       The admission of a forensic interview lies within the discretion of the trial court\nand is reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Franklin, 585 S.W.3d 431, 448 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. 2019). A trial court abuses its discretion when it \u201capplies incorrect legal\nstandards, reaches an illogical conclusion, bases its ruling on a clearly erroneous\nassessment of the proof, or applies reasoning that causes an injustice to the complaining\nparty.\u201d State v. Phelps, 329 S.W.3d 436, 443 (Tenn. 2010).\n\n                                           - 10 -\n\f        Under statute, a video recording in which a child under thirteen is interviewed by a\nforensic interviewer regarding sexual abuse is admissible as substantive evidence in a\ntrial on the sexual abuse if the requirements of the statute are met. T.C.A. \u00a7 24-7-123(a).\nThe statute requires the State to make various showings regarding the qualifications of\nthe interviewer and the nature of the recording, and it requires the child to authenticate\nthe video and to be available for cross-examination. T.C.A. \u00a7 24-7-123(b)(1), (3), (4),\n(5), (6). At issue on this appeal are the requirements that the video must be shown in a\npretrial hearing to \u201cpossess particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d and that \u201c[t]he\ncourt shall make specific findings of fact, on the record, as to the basis for its ruling under\nthis section.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 24-7-123(b)(2), (d).\n\n       The statute provides the following guidance on the requirement of finding\nparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness:\n\n              (2) The video recording is shown to the reasonable satisfaction of the\n       court, in a hearing conducted pretrial, to possess particularized guarantees\n       of trustworthiness.       In determining whether a statement possesses\n       particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, the court shall consider the\n       following factors:\n              (A) The mental and physical age and maturity of the child;\n              (B) Any apparent motive the child may have to falsify or distort the\n       event, including, but not limited to, bias or coercion;\n              (C) The timing of the child\u2019s statement;\n              (D) The nature and duration of the alleged abuse;\n              (E) Whether the child\u2019s young age makes it unlikely that the child\n       fabricated a statement that represents a graphic, detailed account beyond the\n       child\u2019s knowledge and experience;\n              (F) Whether the statement is spontaneous or directly responsive to\n       questions;\n              (G) Whether the manner in which the interview was conducted was\n       reliable, including, but not limited to, the absence of any leading questions;\n              (H) Whether extrinsic evidence exists to show the defendant\u2019s\n       opportunity to commit the act complained of in the child\u2019s statement;\n              (I) The relationship of the child to the offender;\n              (J) Whether the equipment that was used to make the video\n       recording was capable of making an accurate recording; and\n              (K) Any other factor deemed appropriate by the court;\n\nT.C.A. \u00a7 24-7-123(b)(2).\n\n\n\n                                            - 11 -\n\f        Prior to trial, the court reviewed the video of the interview, and Ms. Womack\ntestified regarding her training and education and other statutory factors relevant to the\nadmission of the video. On cross-examination, Ms. Womack agreed that the victim\ninitially said in the interview that she did not know the difference between the truth and a\nlie. She testified that the victim was able to distinguish between what was real and what\nwas not real and that she was told that she could only say what was real during the\ninterview. Ms. Womack agreed that the victim said the abuse happened three times but\nlisted four places. She said that the characterization of the victim\u2019s statement as \u201call over\nthe place\u201d was \u201cfair\u201d but also \u201ctypical for a seven-year-old.\u201d Ms. Womack agreed that it\nis a sign of reliability if a child sometimes answers that she does not know or corrects the\nquestioner, and she did not recall the victim doing either. It is best practice to elicit a\nnarrative from the child, but she agreed that the interview was mainly \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d\nquestions. She did not recall the victim saying anything untrue, but agreed that the\nvictim\u2019s narrative of her father\u2019s arrest included a statement that police told the residents\nthey were surrounded and that the victim later corrected herself by saying police did not\nsay that. She also agreed that the victim appeared to be looking at herself in the mirror at\none point but answered no when asked if she was looking in the mirror, and that this\nanswer was untrue.\n\n       The State argued regarding each statutory factor relevant to the trustworthiness of\nthe interview. Regarding the victim\u2019s mental and physical maturity, the State merely\noffered that she was seven years old, but the court returned to this factor and asked for\nfurther argument. The State offered that the victim gave details regarding the abuse, that\nshe made a drawing of the Defendant\u2019s genitalia, and that her explanation regarding what\nhappened supported a finding of maturity. The State argued there was no apparent\nmotive to distort the facts, that the disclosure took place close in time to the offense, that\nthe victim\u2019s account reflected atypical sexual knowledge, that the recording equipment\nwas accurate, that the victim\u2019s statements were responsive, and that the Campbell County\nChildren\u2019s Center and Ms. Womack had the statutorily required qualifications.\n\n       The defense conceded the qualifications of Ms. Womack and the accuracy of the\nvideo and instead challenged the trustworthiness of the interview. The Defendant argued\nthat the victim did not demonstrate adequate mental or physical maturity because she\ncould not tell the truth from a lie. The defense contended that the victim did not give a\nnarrative, that the questions were leading, and that the victim\u2019s statements were not\nspontaneous. The Defendant raised the victim\u2019s failure to answer that she did not know,\nher statement regarding police surrounding her home, and her denial that she looked at\nherself in the mirror. The defense conceded that there was no apparent motive to lie and\nstated that the nature and duration of the abuse and the relationship of the parties\nappeared to be neutral.\n\n                                            - 12 -\n\f       The trial court found that the State had satisfied the procedural requirements. It\nfound that the video was \u201ca typical seven-year[-]old child talking to an adult about\nsomething that - where the adult was in charge of the meeting\u201d and that \u201cit was your\nclassic forensic interview that this statute protects.\u201d The trial court noted that \u201clooking at\nthe factors\u201d and weighing what the victim was saying \u201cit goes back and forth.\u201d The court\nultimately concluded that the jury was capable of evaluating \u201cthe strengths and\nweaknesses of the statement.\u201d The Defendant argued that the State\u2019s proof was that the\nvictim was a \u201cnormal run[-]of[-]the[-]mill seven-year[-]old\u201d but that the statute required\n\u201cguarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d The court responded that \u201cthe interview process was\nwell done\u201d and ruled that the video was admissible subject to the victim\u2019s authentication\nand availability for cross-examination.\n\n       It is clear from the record that the trial court considered each statutory factor and\nthat the court found that the video possessed particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\nHowever, the trial court did not make specific findings but only generally found the\nevidence was trustworthy. See T.C.A. \u00a7 24-7-123(d). This court generally looks to\nfactual findings from the trial court in order to facilitate appellate review and to\ndetermine whether a trial court has abused its discretion. See State v. Dycus, 456 S.W.3d\n918, 930-31 (Tenn. 2015) (the appellate court may review de novo if the trial court fails\nto make findings regarding diversionary factors); State v. Pollard, 432 S.W.3d 851, 864\n(Tenn. 2013) (the appellate court may review de novo if the trial court fails to make\nproper findings regarding consecutive sentencing); State v. DuBose, 953 S.W.2d 649, 652\n(Tenn. 1997) (the appellate court may review de novo when the trial court has held a\nhearing under Tennessee Rule of Evidence 404(b) but failed to make findings regarding a\nmaterial issue or balancing the probative and prejudicial value). We have previously held\nthat when \u201cthere is virtually perfect compliance with the statute, but the court fails to\nmake complete findings of fact\u201d regarding the admissibility of a forensic interview, our\nreview is de novo. State v. Justin Tyler, No. W2015-00161-CCA-R3-CD, 2016 WL\n1756419, at *6 (Tenn. Crim. App. Apr. 29, 2016). Because the trial court\u2019s findings were\nconclusory statements indicating that the court found the victim\u2019s behavior and the\ninterview, \u201ctypical,\u201d \u201cnormal,\u201d and \u201cclassic,\u201d we review de novo the sole contested issue\nof whether the interview held particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\n\n       The Defendant argues that the victim \u201cdisplayed a lack of maturity\u201d and \u201cdid not\nconvey her thoughts clearly.\u201d We conclude the mental and physical age and maturity of\nthe victim at the time of the interview supports its admission. The Defendant asserts that\nshe \u201cdisplayed trouble with her command of reality,\u201d and he refers to her narration of her\nfather\u2019s arrest and denial that she was looking at herself in the mirrors. While the victim\ndid not directly answer Ms. Womack\u2019s question about knowing the difference between a\ntruth and a lie, instead shrugging her shoulders, Ms. Womack subsequently clarified that\nthe victim understood the difference between what was real and what was not real and\n                                            - 13 -\n\fagreed that she would only talk with Ms. Womack about real things. The victim initially\nsaid that police told her family they were \u201csurrounded,\u201d but her subsequent and\nimmediate correction rather indicates that she was attempting to follow Ms. Womack\u2019s\nrules for the interview. Furthermore, despite the Defendant\u2019s success in eliciting from\nMs. Womack testimony that the victim was not truthful when she said she was not\nlooking at herself in the mirrors, the video suggests that the victim was looking\nspecifically at her cavities rather than her \u201cself\u201d in the mirror and that her answer to Ms.\nWomack\u2019s question was merely literal. Although the Defendant asserts that the victim\ndid \u201cnot convey her thoughts clearly,\u201d the victim clearly told Ms. Womack that the\nDefendant put his \u201cbad spot\u201d in her mouth in her mother\u2019s bedroom and in her bedroom.\nThe trial court found that the victim\u2019s maturity was typical for her age, and the record\nsupports this finding. We conclude that the video supports the conclusion that the victim\npossessed sufficient maturity and mental acumen to recount the instances of sexual abuse\nto Ms. Womack and to limit her statements to what she believed to be true.\n\n        The Defendant argues that the victim, who twice asked about her mother during\nthe interview and said she anticipated living with her father when he was released from\njail, fabricated the abuse in an attempt to reunite with her parents. We note that, at the\ntime the video was admitted, the Defendant conceded that there was no apparent motive\nfor fabrication, and we consider the appellate argument waived. See Tenn. R. App. P.\n36(a) (\u201cNothing in this rule shall be construed as requiring relief be granted to a party\nresponsible for an error or who failed to take whatever action was reasonably available to\nprevent or nullify the harmful effect of an error.\u201d). We agree with the Defendant\u2019s\nconcession at trial that there was no testimony, either at the hearing or at trial, to support\na conclusion that the victim fabricated the allegations out of animosity toward the\nDefendant. Furthermore, there is no indication that the victim connected the disclosure\nof the abuse with the hope of reuniting with her parents; instead, it appears from Ms.\nWomack\u2019s statements that the victim\u2019s mother brought her to the interview and that she\nasked for her mother because she wanted to end the interview. Accordingly, this factor\nweighs in favor of admissibility.\n\n       The Defendant acknowledges that the interview took place close to the time of the\noffenses but asserts that the victim\u2019s narrative was not cohesive. We agree with the\nDefendant that the timing of the statement weighs in favor of admissibility, as it appears\nthat the abuse was disclosed close in time to the offenses and that the interview occurred\nwithin two weeks of the initial disclosure.\n\n       Regarding the nature and duration of the abuse, the Defendant asserts that\nalthough the victim stated that the abuse took place over multiple days, the circumstances\nof her disclosure, including the fact that she was most consistent about the occurrences on\nthe couch and in her mother\u2019s bedroom, indicate that the abuse only happened once. We\n                                            - 14 -\n\fconclude that the nature and duration of the abuse weighs in favor of admission, as it\nappears that the victim had a physical reaction \u2014 shaking \u2014 to the rape occurring in her\nmother\u2019s bedroom and disclosed it close in time to the offenses.\n\n       The Defendant asserts that because the victim did not say that anything happened\nto the Defendant\u2019s \u201cbad spot\u201d or that anything came out of it, she did not display atypical\nsexual knowledge. However, the victim also told Ms. Womack that the Defendant forced\nher to suck and lick his \u201cbad spot\u201d and that he put his tongue in her mouth. These\nstatements would be beyond a typical seven-year-old\u2019s knowledge and experience, and\naccordingly, this factor weighs in favor of admission.\n\n        Regarding whether the statement was spontaneous or directly responsive to\nquestions and regarding the manner of the interview, the Defendant acknowledges that\nthe victim was responsive to questioning but asserts that many of the questions were \u201cyes\nor no\u201d questions. Contrary to the Defendant\u2019s assertion that these questions were\n\u201cleading,\u201d a leading question is \u201cone which \u2018suggests a specific answer desired.\u2019\u201d State\nv. Frank Kenneth Talley, No. 01C01-9612-CC-00524, 1999 WL 722631, at *8 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Sept. 17, 1999) (quoting Cohen, Paine, & Sheppeard, Tennessee Law of\nEvidence, \u00a7 611.6 (3d ed. 1995)). \u201cThe fact that a question allows for a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019\nanswer does not make the question leading.\u201d Amanda Smith v. William R. Walker, et al.,\nNo. M2012-00593-COA-R3-CV, 2012 WL 4167167, at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 19,\n2012). When Ms. Womack asked the victim if she knew why she was at the Children\u2019s\nCenter, the victim spontaneously disclosed that the Defendant had put his tongue and\n\u201cbad spot\u201d in her mouth. Ms. Womack then proceeded to ask questions to elicit specifics\nregarding the time and place of the abuse. We conclude that the manner of the interview\nwas reliable and did not suggest to the victim that Ms. Womack was looking for any\nparticular content in the victim\u2019s statements. None of the questions which could be\nanswered with a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d inherently suggested that Ms. Womack was looking for\neither an affirmative or a negative answer to the question.\n\n       The victim lived with the Defendant, and in the forensic interview, she described\nhim as her uncle. These factors tend to support the admission of the interview, as they\nestablish that the Defendant had free access to the victim and was aware that the victim\u2019s\nparents were not there to protect her. The Defendant concedes that the video equipment\nmet statutory requirements.\n\n       We conclude that the statutory factors support the trial court\u2019s determination that\nthe interview bore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. The Defendant argues\nthat because the court at one point said, \u201cit could go either way,\u201d the interview should\nhave been excluded, but the trial court ultimately concluded that the interview was \u201cwell\ndone\u201d and should be admitted. While some of the victim\u2019s statements lacked clarity,\n                                          - 15 -\n\fthere was nothing to suggest that the interview as a whole was not trustworthy, and the\ntrial court properly concluded that the jury, in its determination of credibility, could take\ninto account any lack of clarity in the victim\u2019s individual statements. Accordingly, we\nconclude there was no error in the admission of the forensic interview, and the Defendant\nis not entitled to relief.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       Based on the foregoing, the judgments are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    ____________________________________________\n                                     JOHN EVERETT WILLIAMS, PRESIDING JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n                                           - 16 -\n\f",
