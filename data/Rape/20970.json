He appeals, alleging error in\nthe admission of evidence. Finding no fatally harmful error,\nwe affirm the judgment of conviction.\n\n                          FACTS\n\n  We state the facts presented by the government\u2019s witnesses:\n\n  According to Cecilia Tirado, the owner of a beauty shop,\nshe was driving home alone on the Imperial Highway after\nhaving been dancing at Alpine Village. The date was a Sun-\nday in July or August 2002. The time was early morning. She\n\f                  UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ                8931\nwas pulled over by someone in a patrol car dressed as a\npoliceman and carrying a gun.\n\n  The officer performed sobriety tests on her, then ordered\nher into the patrol car. He drove her by her home in the City\nof Southgate but passed the house without letting her out.\nWhile driving, he asked her whether she had a husband or\nboyfriend. After a long drive, the officer drove into a desolate\nparking lot, commanded her to undress and penetrated her\nvagina. He then drove her back to her car and left her.\n\n   According to Pamela Fields, a prostitute, she was walking\nin the center of Long Beach Boulevard late at night on Janu-\nary 8, 2003 when a black and white police car, marked \u201cSher-\niff,\u201d stopped her, and the officer asked her for identification,\nthen asked her to get into the car. He drove around and\nstopped in a nearby alley, examined her genital area and dis-\nplayed his own sexual organ. He requested her to engage in\noral sex, and she complied. He eventually let her go.\n\n   According to Kussy Guzman, a native of Peru, she was\ndriving home alone from her work as a shift leader at Jack-In-\nThe-Box at about 2:00 a.m. in the last days of 2002. She was\npulled over by a police officer, who questioned her and even-\ntually told her to sit on the street. The officer asked her\nwhether she had a mother, a sister, or a boyfriend. Purportedly\nin search of a weapon or drugs, he touched her hips, waist and\nbreasts. He then let her go.\n\n  According to Shirley Munoz, an assembler at a manufactur-\ning plant, she was driving alone to her hotel in the early morn-\ning hours of November 16, 2001. She was pulled over by a\nsheriff\u2019s deputy. She admitted to him that she was on parole.\nHe examined her, made her partially undress, and put his hand\non her breasts. The officer twice told her that she was pretty,\nand asked if she was married before eventually releasing her.\n\n   According to Elizabeth Castillo-Chavez, a married resident\nof Compton, she was pulled over by a Compton Sheriff\u2019s dep-\n\f8932              UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ\nuty on her way to work at about 5:00 a.m., near the end of\nDecember 2001. The officer ordered her into the back of his\npolice car where he placed himself next to her and asked her\npersonal questions. He told her to get out of the car and\nsearched her, rubbing his palms on her thighs, hips and\nbreasts.\n\n   The principal issue at trial was the identity of the perpetra-\ntor. The process of identification began when Fields, the night\nshe escaped from the officer, encountered her husband Rory\nFitzhugh, against whom she had a restraining order. A police\ncar noticed them, and she told the officers of her recent\nordeal. She furnished the number of the patrol car of the offi-\ncer who had tormented her and also the license plate she had\nmemorized \u2014 respectively 050 or 650 and 300795 or 000795.\nAn investigator learned that 050 was on the roof of a sheriff\u2019s\nvehicle used by two deputies on the day shift on January 8\nand not used that night. The number on the defendant\u2019s patrol\ncar was 560. The license plate on his car was E1007975.\n\n   Despite these discrepancies, the investigation continued.\nThe investigator brought a \u201cphoto-six-pack\u201d (a group of six\nsimilar-looking persons) and showed it to Fields the day after\nher ordeal. She identified the defendant as the perpetrator.\nThe investigator then had an examination made of the patrol\ncar used by the defendant on the night of January 8. A finger-\nprint matching Fields\u2019 was found on the trunk of the car.\n\n   The investigation of the Fields case interacted with the\nTirado case, when in January 2003 Tirado responded to a tele-\nphone survey by the Southgate police asking about citizen sat-\nisfaction with police activities. She told her story, and a\nSouthgate police officer called on her at home to confirm it,\nlater notifying the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s internal complaint\nbureau. An investigator there spoke to the investigator of the\nFields case.\n\n   Tirado had identified the perpetrator as a Southgate police\nofficer. But on February 19, 2003, when Tirado was shown a\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ                 8933\nphoto-six-pack she was visibly upset and at once identified\nthe defendant as the perpetrator. She also showed investiga-\ntors where she\u2019d been pulled over on the night of the attack;\nit was an area patrolled by the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Depart-\nment.\n\n   The FBI, alerted by the investigators, searched the records\nof the defendant\u2019s onboard computer. The names of Guzman,\nMunoz, and Chavez turned up. The FBI sent letters to each of\nthe three women asking if they had encountered \u201ca police\nofficer\u201d whose conduct had been improper. This inquiry led\neach of the women to report the incidents set out above. Guz-\nman then identified the defendant from an FBI photo-six-\npack.\n\n                       PROCEEDINGS\n\n   Gonzalez was indicted on August 25, 2004. Count One of\nthe indictment alleged the rape of Tirado as above narrated.\nCount Two alleged the fondling of Guzman. Count Three\nalleged the oral sex required of Fields. In addition, the gov-\nernment offered the statements of Castillo and Munoz to show\na pattern of conduct by the defendant.\n\n   After a trial by jury Gonzalez was convicted on all three\ncounts. He was sentenced to thirty years\u2019 imprisonment and\nfive years\u2019 supervised release.\n\n  Gonzalez appeals.\n\n                          ANALYSIS\n\n   Gonzalez\u2019s appeal rests in challenges to the admissibility of\nsome of the evidence used against him. He earnestly contends\nthat there were individual mistakes by the court that justify\nreversal and that cumulatively the errors require reversal. Our\nreview asks if the district court abused its discretion and if its\nerrors, if any, were more likely than not to affect the verdict.\n\f8934              UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ\nUnited States v. Chu Kong Yin, 935 F.2d 990, 994 (9th Cir.\n1991). We consider each contention of the defendant in turn.\n\n   [1] The framework for decision of the hearsay objections is\nset by Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(B) and its exposition in Tome\nv. United States, 513 U.S. 150 (1995). Rule 801 provides:\n\n       (d) Statements which are not hearsay. A statement\n    is not hearsay if \u2014\n\n       (1) Prior statement by witness. The declarant\n    testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-\n    examination concerning the statement, and the state-\n    ment is . . . (B) consistent with the declarant\u2019s testi-\n    mony and is offered to rebut an express or implied\n    charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or\n    improper influence or motive.\n\nAs statements meeting these conditions are not hearsay, they\ngo beyond rebuttal of attack on the declarant and constitute\nsubstantive evidence in the case. Tome, 513 U.S. at 157. The\nstatement may not be admitted \u201cto counter all forms of\nimpeachment or to bolster the witness merely because she has\nbeen discredited.\u201d Id. The Rule \u201cspeaks of a party rebutting\nan alleged motive, not bolstering the veracity of the story\ntold.\u201d Id. at 158. This limitation reinforces the requirement\nthat the consistent statements \u201cmust have been made before\nthe alleged influence, or motive to fabricate, arose.\u201d Id. \u201cA\nconsistent statement that predates the motive is a square\nrebuttal of the charge that the testimony was contrived as a\nconsequence of that motive.\u201d Id.\n\n   The Retelling of Tirado\u2019s Story. The defense argues that\nTirado\u2019s testimony, delivered by her in Spanish through an\ninterpreter, was improperly and prejudicially bolstered by the\ngovernment calling as a witness Sergeant Enrique Garza, the\npolice officer who interviewed her and who at trial retold the\nstory of the assault as she had told it to him. This retelling in\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ                 8935\nEnglish with the stamp of official acceptance of what Tirado\nhad already testified to must be considered, the defense main-\ntains, a violation of Rule 801(d)(1).\n\n   [2] Measured by this measure, the retelling of Tirado\u2019s\nstory by Garza was inadmissible hearsay. It was not offered\nto rebut \u201can express or implied charge of . . . recent fabrica-\ntion or improper influence or motive\u201d on Tirado\u2019s part. Refer-\nences by the defense in its cross-examination of Tirado to her\nsuit against Gonzalez and the County of Los Angeles were\nmade to bring out discrepancies in the dates to which she tes-\ntified. True, a faint implication could have been drawn that\nthis lawsuit motivated her present testimony; but \u201c[a] party\nwill often counter [hostile testimony] with at least an implicit\ncharge that the witness has been under some influence or\nmotive to fabricate.\u201d Tome, 513 U.S. at 162 (Kennedy, J., for\nplurality). Rule 801(d)(1)(B) should not be read to open \u201cthe\nfloodgates\u201d to any prior consistent statement. Id. To conclude\nthat the cross-examination of Tirado opened the door to Ser-\ngeant Garza\u2019s retelling of her story would remove the restraint\non prior consistent statements that Rule 801(d)(1)(B) imposes.\nThe district court erred in admitting it.\n\n   [3] Was admission of this hearsay prejudicial? Was it suffi-\nciently prejudicial that it more likely than not affected the ver-\ndict? Tirado\u2019s account of the rape not being at issue, it is\ndifficult to see what Garza\u2019s retelling of it added to the prose-\ncution\u2019s case except for its spillover effect: Tirado was con-\nfirmed as credible by a police officer. A kind of vouching was\nfurnished for all her testimony, including the eventual identi-\nfication. That effect of this inadmissible hearsay was prejudi-\ncial to the defendant.\n\n  [4] The second question is harder. As the Supreme Court\nhas sententiously observed, persons are entitled to fair trials,\nnot perfect ones. Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 81, 91 (1988).\nA jury that believed that Tirado had had the awful experience\n\u2014 and no one doubted that she had \u2014 would very probably\n\f8936              UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ\nhave believed that she could remember her assailant, even\nwithout the hearsay from Garza. Tirado stated at the time of\nher identification that she was \u201c100 percent sure\u201d that Gonza-\nlez had raped her. Given this testimony, it is unlikely that any\ngeneralized vouching regarding Tirado\u2019s credibility altered\nthe jury\u2019s verdict.\n\n   [5] The Retelling of Fields\u2019 Story. Clarissa McClung, a reg-\nistered nurse and sexual examiner, examined Fields at the\nhospital the night of the assault. McClung testified that the\nvictim\u2019s description of the assault affects the examination she\nconducts. She examined Fields\u2019 mouth for injury. Fields told\nher that \u201cshe had been forced to have oral copulation.\u201d This\nhearsay, objected to by the defense, was properly admitted\nunder Fed. R. Evid. 803(4) as a statement \u201cmade for purposes\nof medical diagnosis or treatment.\u201d True, she was collecting\nevidence, but that forensic function did not obliterate her role\nas a nurse, in a hospital, performing a medical examination of\na victim of a sexual assault. It would have been unprofes-\nsional for McClung to have treated Fields without eliciting an\naccount of what had happened to her. We conclude that the\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in admitting\nMcClung\u2019s statement under Rule 803(4).\n\n   The defense also objected to a retelling of Fields\u2019 story by\nSergeant James Kagy, the police officer who interrogated her\napproximately three hours after the event. Again, the objec-\ntion is to what is characterized as hearsay, but it appears to us\nto have been proper rebuttal.\n\n  The defense had cross-examined Fields as follows:\n\n    Mr. Hirsch: Ms. Fields, you have before you the\n    exhibit?\n\n    Ms. Fields: Yes, sir, I do.\n\f              UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ                   8937\nMr. Hirsch: And is this the complaint that you have\nfor damages against the County of Los Angeles and\nthe defendant in this case?\n\nMs. Fields: I actually haven\u2019t even read it yet . . . .\n\n***\n\nMr. Hirsch: You have an attorney, Mr. Gregory\nYates, who filed a lawsuit on your behalf?\n\nMs. Fields: Yes, I do, sir.\n\nMr. Hirsch: And you understand that lawsuit is\npending in the federal district court somewhere in\nthis building?\n\nMs. Fields: I\u2019m not sure.\n\nMr. Hirsch: And you understand the lawsuit is\nagainst the County of Los Angeles, Leroy Baca and\nGabriel Gonzalez; isn\u2019t that right?\n\nMs. Fields: I\u2019m not aware of everything fully, but I\nknow there\u2019s a lawsuit.\n\nMr. Hirsch: And you are seeking damages as a result\nof this lawsuit, are you not?\n\nMs. Fields: Yes, sir.\n\n***\n\nMr. Hirsch: And after the indictment was returned,\nthen your attorney filed the lawsuit; is that correct?\n\nMs. Fields: No. During that time, Ronald Mintz\npicked up the case for me and had done some filings\nfor me here in L.A.\n\f8938              UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ\n    Mr. Hirsch: Well, but did you tell Agent Riedel that\n    you contacted an attorney, and since you didn\u2019t\n    know the name of the deputy, the attorney would not\n    take the case?\n\n    Ms. Fields: That\u2019s right.\n\n    Mr. Hirsch: And after the story was publicized, and\n    the deputy had been indicted, then your attorney\n    filed the paperwork?\n\n    Ms. Fields: Yes. But during that time frame, there\n    was another attorney that helped me. His name was\n    Ronald Mintz.\n\n   [6] The thrust of this cross-examination suggested that\nFields had a money motive to lie about Gonzalez\u2019s conduct.\nUnlike the cross-examination of Tirado, the references to the\npending civil case were not incidental. They were made to\nsuggest a mercenary purpose. The officer\u2019s account of her\nstory was properly admissible rebuttal under Rule\n801(d)(1)(B).\n\n   The defense claims that Fields already had a motive to lie\nto the officer in the hospital \u2014 to avoid arrest for prostitution\nand to keep her husband out of trouble for violating a restrain-\ning order prohibiting him from being with her. The defense\nargues that the court erroneously prevented it from presenting\nthe restraining order to explain Fields\u2019 concern. It adds that\nher young children were stowed at a motel; if Fitzhugh were\narrested for violating the order and if she were arrested for\nprostitution, the children would have been abandoned; hence,\nshe quickly made up the story about Gonzalez to distract\nattention from herself and her husband. The defense notes that\nher testimony that she \u201cflagged down\u201d the officers who\nhelped her is contradicted by their testimony that they took\nthe initiative in making contact with her.\n\f                  UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ               8939\n   [7] The existence of the motives attributed to Fields does\nnot disqualify her statement to Kagy as appropriate rebuttal of\nthe implicit charge of fabricating her story in order to pursue\nthe civil suit. If the defense had been allowed to develop the\nfacts on the restraining order, it might have appeared that\nFields conceivably had a motive to distract police attention\nfrom Fitzhugh. But that motive was slight compared to her\nown motive to keep from arrest as a prostitute, and this\nmotive was already presented to the jury when her occupation\nbecame clear to them on direct examination. The jury knew\nshe had a motive to lie and that her claim to have asked the\nofficers for help was contradicted by them. The additional\ninformation about Fitzhugh would have added little to the\njury\u2019s assessment of her credibility. The court\u2019s limitation on\ncross-examination of Fields on the terms of the restraining\norder sensibly saved time and confusion and did not violate\nGonzalez\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him. See\nUnited States v. Munoz, 233 F.3d 1117, 1134 (9th Cir. 2000);\nsee also Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n\n  [8] The uncharged conduct. The acts involving Castillo and\nMunoz were testified to, over objection, as admissible under\nFed. R. Evid. 404(b). The court found that there was sufficient\nevidence for the jury to find that Gonzalez had committed the\nacts; that the acts were not too remote in time from the crimes\ncharged; that there were sufficient similarities between the\nacts and the crimes charged; that the probative value of the\nevidence outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice; and that\nevidence of the acts was extremely probative of identity and\nmodus operandi.\n\n   The defense points to differences. Gonzalez ran a computer\ncheck on Castillo and Munoz, not on Fields or Tirado. The\ncomputer check on Guzman was a month after the date she\nsaid the incident occurred. The acts committed on Castillo and\nMunoz were different from those committed on Fields, Guz-\nman and Tirado. Fields was not in a car but on foot. There\nwas no \u201csignature\u201d by the defendant.\n\f8940              UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ\n   [9] Rule 404(b) prohibits the use of other crimes or wrongs\nto prove character or criminal propensity. To draw the line\nbetween acts constituting such excluded evidence and acts\nshowing identity and modus operandi is not easy but not\nimpossible. Here modus operandi consisted in (1) being a\npolice officer armed with a badge and a gun and the invisible\naura of authority accompanying these trappings of public\ntrust; who (2) would spot a woman alone at night; (3) would\naccost her; (4) would identify her as neither a minor nor a sex-\nagenarian; (5) would attempt to establish a conversational rap-\nport by asking her about her family and personal\nrelationships; (6) would command her to sit, squat, stand, or\nundress; (7) would obtain sexual stimulation by contact with\nher flesh while she was in an isolated position unable to resist\nhis commands or his hands; and (8) would release her without\nany arrest or citation for her supposed offense. Beyond pro-\npensity, the evidence established a way of behavior that could\nbe reasonably relied upon by a juror to convict Gonzalez of\nthe charged offenses.\n\n   Conclusion. It is not contested that the testimony of the\ngovernment\u2019s witnesses, if true, established offenses by Gon-\nzalez in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242. Included in the liberty\nprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment is the concept of per-\nsonal bodily integrity and specifically \u201cthe right to be free\nfrom certain sexually motivated physical assaults and coerced\nsexual battery.\u201d United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 262\n(1997). The defendant has been shown to have, wilfully and\nunder color of state law, unlawfully coerced his victims to\nsuffer sexually-motivated assaults and batteries. We have\ntaken note of the minor discrepancies emphasized by the\ndefense in the witnesses\u2019 accounts. None of them are such as\nto shake confidence in the verdict. Their testimony was\ndetailed, their accounts of what had been done to them effec-\ntively unchallenged, and their identification of Gonzalez as\nthe perpetrator was confirmed by Fields\u2019 fingerprint on his\npatrol car; by Fields\u2019 accurate recollection of 8 of the 10 iden-\ntifying numbers on Gonzalez\u2019s patrol car; by the proof of the\n\f                  UNITED STATES v. GONZALEZ                 8941\narea he patrolled and the times he was on patrol; and by the\nexperiences of Castillo and Munoz.\n\n   Gonzalez, thirty-seven at the time of the crimes, was a\ngraduate of California State University at Long Beach. He had\nbeen gainfully employed since he was 26. He had no criminal\nrecord. He had been a member of the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s\nDepartment since 1997. To read his case is to read the story\nof a police officer inexplicably gone bad. His fall is great, his\nsentence hard. Bearing all this in mind and recalling that iden-\ntifications are sometimes mistaken, we have reviewed the\nrecord and found that we cannot say that our confidence in the\nverdict has been shaken or that the convictions were produced\nby error. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is\nAFFIRMED.\n\f",
