We affirm and remand with instructions.\n\n                                          ISSUES\n\n      Firestone presents one issue for our review, which we restate as:\n\n      I.     Whether Firestone received effective assistance of trial counsel.\n\n      In addition, we raise sua sponte:\n\n      II.    Whether the trial court erred when it failed to attach the habitual offender\n             enhancement to a specific conviction.\n\n                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      In 2004, Firestone was charged with numerous offenses based upon an incident in\n\nJanuary 2004 in which S.W. was sexually attacked by Firestone and his cousin, Bradley\n\nGriffin. Following a jury trial, Firestone was found guilty of rape and criminal deviate\n\nconduct, both as B felonies. He was also found to be an habitual offender. On direct\n\nappeal, this Court affirmed Firestone\u2019s convictions. See Firestone v. State, 838 N.E.2d\n\n468 (Ind. Ct. App. 2005).\n\n      In 2006, Firestone filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief claiming\n\nineffective assistance of trial counsel. This petition was amended by counsel in July\n\n2009, and a hearing was held on the amended petition on October 4, 2011. On December\n\n30, 2011, the court issued an order denying Firestone\u2019s petition. This appeal ensued.\n\n                            DISCUSSION AND DECISION\n\n\n                                            2\n\f       Firestone appeals from a negative judgment, and, to the extent his appeal turns on\n\nfactual issues, he must convince this Court that the evidence as a whole leads unerringly\n\nand unmistakably to a decision opposite that reached by the post-conviction court. See\n\nTimberlake v. State, 753 N.E.2d 591, 597 (Ind. 2001). Thus, we will disturb the decision\n\nof the post-conviction court only if the evidence is without conflict and leads only to a\n\nconclusion contrary to the result of the post-conviction court. Id.\n\n                              I. ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n\n       Firestone contends that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Because\n\nhe did not raise this issue in his direct appeal, see Firestone, 838 N.E.2d at 470, it is\n\navailable to him in post-conviction proceedings. See Woods v. State, 701 N.E.2d 1208,\n\n1216 (Ind. 1998) (holding that ineffective assistance of trial counsel may be raised on\n\ndirect appeal, but if it is not, it is available in post-conviction proceedings irrespective of\n\nnature of issues claimed to support competence or prejudice prongs).\n\n       In general, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are governed by the familiar\n\ntwo-part standard set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct.\n\n2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). A defendant is required to establish both (1) that\n\ncounsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance\n\nprejudiced the defendant. Johnson v. State, 948 N.E.2d 331, 334 (Ind. 2011), cert.\n\ndenied, 132 S. Ct. 1575, 182 L. Ed. 2d 194 (2012). The deficient performance prong\n\nrequires a showing that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness. Kubsch v. State, 934 N.E.2d 1138, 1147 (Ind. 2010). The prejudice\n\n                                              3\n\fprong requires a showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to render the result of\n\nthe trial unreliable. Id. Counsel\u2019s performance is presumed effective, and a defendant\n\nmust offer strong and convincing evidence to overcome this presumption. Id. Moreover,\n\nfailure to satisfy either prong of the two-part test will cause the defendant\u2019s claim to fail.\n\nHenley v. State, 881 N.E.2d 639, 645 (Ind. 2008). If we can easily dispose of an\n\nineffective assistance claim based upon the prejudice prong, we may do so without\n\naddressing whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. Id.\n\n       First, Firestone alleges that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object or\n\notherwise take steps to prevent the jury from hearing certain references to his unrelated\n\ncharges and periods of incarceration. Specifically, one of the detectives in the case\n\ntestified at trial, without objection, that a branch of the Indianapolis Police Department\n\ncreates photo line ups of people that are incarcerated. He went on to explain that the\n\ncomputer pulls pictures of people from its database that look similar to the suspect in\n\norder to create the line up. The detective testified that a line up that included Firestone\n\nwas created \u201cbecause he\u2019s been incarcerated, or he had been incarcerated before at that\n\njail.\u201d Trial Tr. p. 295. In addition, State\u2019s Exhibit 18, which was admitted at trial\n\nwithout objection, is the photo line up that was created to include Firestone\u2019s picture, and\n\ncontains the words \u201cIndianapolis Police Department\u201d across the top of the page. Finally,\n\nState\u2019s Exhibit 19 is an audio recording of the police interview with Firestone. This\n\nexhibit was also admitted without objection. Each juror was given a transcript of the\n\ninterview, and the recorded interview was played for the jury. Exhibit 19 included\n\n                                              4\n\fstatements by the detective that they were at the Marion County jail with Firestone who\n\nwas currently in custody with other cases pending. See id. at 309, 318.\n\n       At the post-conviction hearing, Firestone\u2019s trial counsel testified that he recalled\n\nvery little information from Firestone\u2019s trial and that he would normally seek to exclude\n\nsuch evidence. Indeed it does appear that an objection probably would have been granted\n\nby the trial court with regard to this evidence. However, Firestone\u2019s counsel may have\n\nprudently determined not to object to the detective\u2019s testimony regarding Firestone\u2019s\n\nprior incarceration and to the photo line up presented in Exhibit 18 so as not to call undue\n\nattention to the information. See, e.g., Benefield v. State, 945 N.E.2d 791, 799-800 (Ind.\n\nCt. App. 2011) (determining that counsel had strategic reason for decision not to object to\n\nevidence because objection may have been more damaging than evidence).\n\n       In addition, counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of Exhibit 19 containing\n\nFirestone\u2019s statement could very well have been a matter of strategy. By not objecting to\n\nExhibit 19, counsel refrained from drawing unwanted attention to the mere mention of\n\nFirestone\u2019s incarceration and instead accomplished the more important task of getting\n\nFirestone\u2019s version of events, in which he denied any physical contact with S.W., in front\n\nof the jury. Although Firestone did eventually testify in his own defense, this statement\n\nwas already admitted so that he could weigh his options at the point in trial when he\n\nwould have to decide whether to testify. Further, by allowing Exhibit 19 into evidence\n\nand by testifying, Firestone was able to twice deny wrongdoing to the jury.\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       Firestone also argues that his trial counsel knew about the photo line up and the\n\nrecorded interview prior to trial and therefore could have filed motions to redact and/or\n\nmotions in limine with regard to these evidentiary items. In assigning this knowledge to\n\nhis trial counsel, Firestone does not direct us to any testimony or evidence in support of\n\nhis claim. Moreover, based upon our analysis of resulting prejudice, counsel\u2019s pretrial\n\nknowledge is of no moment.\n\n       With regard to the prejudice prong, the evidence reveals that the references to\n\nFirestone\u2019s criminal history were extremely brief and vague. Additionally, the State did\n\nnothing to emphasize the evidence of Firestone\u2019s criminal history and the jury received\n\nno information as to the nature of the previous charges. Further, the jurors had just heard\n\ntestimony that the police department creates photo line ups so the fact that the line up\n\ncontained the words \u201cIndianapolis Police Department\u201d should not have caused undue\n\nconcern.     Furthermore, the State\u2019s evidence was compelling.                  S.W. testified\n\nunequivocally that while she was held down by Griffin, Firestone inserted his penis into\n\nher vagina against her will. Firestone then, against S.W.\u2019s will, inserted his penis into her\n\nmouth and later again inserted his penis into her vagina. Firestone has not met his burden\n\nof showing that counsel\u2019s errors rendered the result of his trial unreliable.\n\n       Next, Firestone asserts that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel\u2019s failure to\n\nobject to or otherwise attempt to prevent the jury from hearing evidence of the possibility\n\nthat a date rape drug had been administered to S.W. On this issue, Firestone presents no\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fargument as to his counsel\u2019s performance but rather focuses solely on the prejudice prong\n\nof the two-part standard.\n\n       At trial, State\u2019s Exhibit 24 was admitted by stipulation. Exhibit 24 is a lab report\n\nshowing the results of testing on S.W.\u2019s urine sample using a date rape drug panel. The\n\nresults were negative for a wide range of drugs except the stimulant Phentermine, which\n\nwas due to a weight loss medication taken by S.W.           The State also presented the\n\ntestimony of the emergency room nurse.          She testified that she is a forensic nurse\n\nexaminer in the sexual assault program at the hospital as well as the coordinator of the\n\nprogram.    The nurse testified that S.W. reported feeling more drunk than normal,\n\nvomiting numerous times, and being nauseous, dizzy, and weak. She explained that the\n\nsymptoms suffered by S.W. can be caused by \u201cdate rape drugs\u201d or \u201cdrugs used to\n\nfacilitate sexual assault\u201d being added to a drink to speed up the effects of alcohol. Trial\n\nTr. p. 384. The nurse further testified that date rape drugs usually leave the body within\n\neight to twelve hours, or sooner if the person vomits or urinates. The nurse noted that\n\nS.W. had indicated she had urinated and vomited several times between the time of the\n\nassault and her visit to the emergency room and that the assault had occurred at least\n\nfourteen hours prior to S.W. visiting the emergency room.\n\n       As to the prejudice Firestone alleges he suffered due to the admission of this\n\nevidence, we note there was never any testimony that S.W. had probably been given a\n\ndate rape drug. Although the nurse testified that some of S.W.\u2019s complaints were like\n\nthose the nurse had observed in others who had been drugged, State\u2019s Exhibit 24 was\n\n                                            7\n\fnegative for any date rape drugs in S.W.\u2019s system. Moreover, on cross-examination by\n\nFirestone\u2019s trial counsel, the nurse confirmed that the tests on S.W.\u2019s urine sample were\n\nnegative for all the drugs on the date rape drug panel except the stimulants contained in\n\nthe diet drug S.W. had been taking. The nurse also admitted on cross-examination that it\n\nwas possible that the symptoms S.W. experienced could have been caused by something\n\nother than a date rape drug. During his testimony, Firestone stated that he had never seen\n\na date rape drug, did not discuss date rape drugs with Griffin, and did not see Griffin put\n\nanything into S.W.\u2019s drink.      Finally, the State\u2019s evidence was strong, and S.W.\u2019s\n\ntestimony was unequivocal.       Firestone has failed to fulfill his burden of showing\n\nprejudice to the extent that the outcome of his trial would have been different.\n\n                     II. HABITUAL OFFENDER ENHANCEMENT\n\n       We raise, sua sponte, the issue of whether the trial court erred when it failed to\n\nattach the habitual offender enhancement to a specific conviction in sentencing Firestone.\n\nThe trial court sentenced Firestone to eighteen years on his conviction of rape (Count I),\n\neighteen years on his conviction of criminal deviate conduct (Count III), to be served\n\nconsecutively, and twenty-eight years for his adjudication as an habitual offender. See\n\nAppellant\u2019s App. in Direct Appeal p. 4; Trial Tr. pp. 741-42.\n\n       In imposing the habitual offender enhancement, the trial court did not specify\n\nwhich conviction it was enhancing. As we have previously noted, \u201cwhen defendants are\n\nconvicted of multiple offenses and found to be habitual offenders, trial courts must\n\nimpose the resulting penalty enhancement on only one of the convictions and must\n\n                                             8\n\fspecify the conviction so enhanced.\u201d Davis v. State, 843 N.E.2d 65, 67 (Ind. Ct. App.\n\n2006) (citing McIntire v. State, 717 N.E.2d 96, 102 (Ind. 1999)). Failure to specify\n\nrequires remand to the trial court to correct the sentence with regard to the habitual\n\noffender enhancement. Id. Thus, the omission here constitutes error for which remand is\n\nrequired.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       Firestone has not shown such prejudice as would render the result of his trial\n\nunreliable. Therefore, we affirm the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of relief.\n\n       However, we remand to the post-conviction court with instructions to assign the\n\nhabitual offender enhancement to one of Firestone\u2019s convictions.\n\n       Affirmed and remanded with instructions.\n\nNAJAM, J., and PYLE, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f",
