JOSEPH SUPERIOR COURT\n                        The Honorable Jane Woodward Miller, Judge\n                             Cause No. 71D08-1105-FC-101\n\n\n\n                                       May 22, 2013\n\n               MEMORANDUM DECISION \u2013 NOT FOR PUBLICATION\n\nBAKER, Judge\n\f          In this case, the appellant-defendant Jerry Lee Slisz appeals his conviction for\n\nBurglary,1 a class C felony. Slisz claims that his conviction must be reversed because the\n\ntrial court erred in refusing to give his tendered instruction on the presumption of\n\ninnocence. Slisz also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, claiming that the State\n\nfailed to prove that he intended to steal anything from the vacant house that he entered.\n\n          We conclude that because Slisz\u2019s presumption of innocence was adequately set\n\nforth in the instructions that were given, the trial court did not err in refusing to give\n\nSlisz\u2019s proffered instruction. We also find that it was reasonable for the jury to infer that\n\nSlisz intended to commit theft when he entered the house. As a result, we affirm the\n\njudgment of the trial court.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n          On May 26, 2011, at approximately 5:30 a.m., Peggy Clark arrived at her dry\n\ncleaning business in South Bend and turned on some equipment to get ready for the day.\n\nClark then went to an alley at the rear of the store, ensured that the business\u2019s shed was\n\nsecure and checked a vacant house that faced the rear of the business. Everything\n\nappeared to be intact, and Clark observed that the door to the vacant house was closed.\n\n          At approximately noon that same day, Clark heard voices in the alley, looked\n\noutside from the rear of the store, and saw two people walking through the alley. Clark\n\nthen heard a \u201cloud bang\u201d that sounded \u201clike a door being kicked in.\u201d Tr. p. 20. She went\n\nback outside and saw two people enter the vacant house. Clark called 911 and South\n\n1\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 35-43-2-1.\n                                              2\n\fBend police officer Greg Early was dispatched to the house. When Officer Early arrived,\n\nhe noticed that the door frame was damaged, and it looked like the door had been kicked\n\nin and forced open. Two other officers arrived, and all three entered the house. They\n\nannounced themselves as South Bend police officers and Officer Early secured the\n\nstairway to the basement while the other two officers conducted a sweep of the main\n\nlevel. All three officers then walked down to the basement.\n\n       The officers again identified themselves as South Bend police officers and ordered\n\nanyone in the house to \u201cshow themselves.\u201d         Tr. p. 35.   Officer Early scanned his\n\nflashlight in one of the basement rooms and observed two individuals \u201cwith their backs\n\nagainst the wall like frozen real stiff against each other.\u201d Id. at 37. Officer Early had to\n\norder them out several times before they appeared. Both men, one of whom was Slisz,\n\nwere arrested.\n\n       Thereafter, a crime scene technician, David Modlin, arrived at the house and\n\ndiscovered a black bag in the basement that contained a hacksaw, a screwdriver,\n\nsandpaper, and a pipe wrench. Slisz admitted that the bag and its contents were his\u2014but\n\nclaimed that a few days earlier, \u201csome man\u201d had given him permission to enter the house.\n\nId. at 100, 105. Slisz supplied no other information about that individual and made no\n\neffort to verify that he had permission to be in the residence. The house was owned by\n\nAshley and Eric Neff and no one had their permission to be on the property. Slisz\n\nadmitted that he intended to \u201cscrap\u201d any materials of value that he could remove from the\n\nhouse. Id. at 105.\n\n                                             3\n\f       On November 31, 2011, the State charged Slisz with burglary, a class C felony.\n\nAfter the evidence was presented, Slisz offered an instruction regarding the presumption\n\nof innocence, which the trial court refused to give. Slisz now appeals.\n\n                             DISCUSSION AND DECISION\n\n                                       I. Instruction\n\n       Slisz contends that his conviction must be reversed because the trial court erred in\n\nrefusing to give his tendered instruction on the presumption of innocence. Specifically,\n\nSlisz\u2019s tendered instruction provided that the jury should adopt an interpretation of the\n\nevidence that is consistent with a defendant\u2019s innocence if the evidence could be\n\ninterpreted as pointing to either guilt or innocence.\n\n       The purpose of jury instructions is to inform the jury of the law applicable to the\n\nfacts without misleading the jury and to enable the jurors to comprehend the case clearly\n\nand arrive at a just, fair and correct verdict. Overstreet v. Street, 783 N.E.2d 1140, 1163\n\n(Ind. 2003). Instructing the jury lies solely within the trial court\u2019s discretion. Flake v.\n\nState, 767 N.E.2d 1004, 1007 (Ind. Ct. 2002). We will reverse the trial court\u2019s decision\n\nto instruct the jury only for an abuse of discretion. Buckner v. State, 857 N.E.2d 1011,\n\n1015 (Ind. Ct. App. 2006).\n\n       A trial court erroneously refuses to give a tendered instruction, or part of a\n\ntendered instruction, if: (1) the instruction correctly sets out the law; (2) evidence\n\nsupports the giving of the instruction; and (3) the substance of the tendered instruction is\n\nnot covered by the other instructions given. Overstreet, 783 N.E.2d at 1164. Jury\n\n                                              4\n\finstructions are to be considered as a whole and in reference to each other. Error in a\n\nparticular instruction will not result in reversal unless the entire jury charge misleads the\n\njury as to the law in the case. Flake, 767 N.E.2d at 1007.\n\n       In this case, Slisz tendered the following instruction:\n\n       If the evidence in this case is susceptible of two constructions or\n       interpretations, each of which appears to you to be reasonable, and one of\n       which points to the guilt of the accused, and the other to his innocence, it is\n       your duty, under the law, to adopt that interpretation which is consistent\n       with the accused\u2019s innocence, and reject that which points to his guilt.\n\nAppellant\u2019s App. p. 5.\n\n       The trial court refused to give this instruction and, instead, instructed the jury as\n\nfollows:\n\n       You should require that the proof be so conclusive and sure as to exclude\n       every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\n\n       Under the law, you must presume that the defendant is innocent and must\n       continue to do so throughout the trial, unless the state proves every\n       essential element of the crime with which the defendant is proved [sic]\n       beyond a reasonable doubt. Because he is presumed to be innocent, the\n       defendant is not required to provide any explanation. You should attempt\n       to fit the evidence to the presumption that the defendant is innocent and the\n       theory that every witness is telling the truth. If, at the end of the trial, you\n       have a reasonable doubt concerning the defendant\u2019s guilt, you must find\n       him not guilty.\n\n       The burden is upon the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n       defendant is guilty of the crime charged . . . . The evidence must overcome\n       any reasonable doubt concerning the defendant\u2019s guilt. . . . If you find that\n       there is a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crime you\n       must give the defendant the benefit of that doubt and find the defendant not\n       guilty. . . . You should try to fit the evidence to the presumption that the\n       defendant is innocent.\n\n\n                                              5\n\fTr. p. 167-69.\n\n       When examining the instructions that the trial court gave, it is apparent that the\n\ninstructions adequately explained that the burden of proof was on the State and that it was\n\nthe jury\u2019s duty to maintain the presumption of innocence, and attempt to fit the evidence\n\ninto the theory that Slisz was innocent. In short, the substance of Slisz\u2019s proposed\n\ninstruction was adequately addressed in the instructions that the trial court actually gave.\n\nThus, we conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to give Slisz\u2019s proffered\n\ninstruction.\n\n                             II. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       Slisz also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. Specifically, Slisz argues\n\nthat his burglary conviction must be reversed because the State failed to establish that he\n\nintended to commit theft when he entered the house.\n\n       When reviewing challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, we do not reweigh\n\nthe evidence or judge the credibility of the witnesses. Bond v. State, 925 N.E.2d 773,\n\n781 (Ind. Ct. App. 2010), trans. denied. Rather, we consider only the evidence most\n\nfavorable to the verdict and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, and we will\n\naffirm if the evidence and those inferences constitute substantial evidence of probative\n\nvalue to support the verdict. Id. Reversal is appropriate only when a reasonable trier of\n\nfact would not be able to form inferences as to each material element of the offense. Id.\n\n       Class C felony burglary is governed by Indiana Code section 35-43-2-1, which\n\nprovides that \u201c[a] person who breaks and enters the building or structure of another\n\n                                             6\n\fperson, with the intent to commit a felony in it, commits burglary, a class C felony.\u201d A\n\nburglary defendant\u2019s intent to commit a felony is a \u201cmatter that the jury can infer from\n\nthe surrounding circumstances . . . [and] such intent may be inferred from the subsequent\n\nconduct of the defendant inside the premises.\u201d Jewell v. State, 672 N.E.2d 417, 427 (Ind.\n\nCt. App. 1996).\n\n       In this case, because the State alleged that Slisz intended to commit theft when he\n\nentered the vacant house, it was required to prove that Slisz intended to exert\n\nunauthorized control over the property of another person, with the intent to deprive the\n\nother person of any part of its value or use. Ind. Code \u00a7 35-43-4-2. As discussed above,\n\nthe evidence demonstrated that Clark initially observed that the door to the vacant house\n\nnear her dry cleaning business was closed but that she later heard a sound like a door was\n\nbeing kicked. In fact, after Officer Early arrived, he noticed that the \u201cdoor appeared to be\n\nkicked in.\u201d Tr. p. 20. When the police announced their presence and searched the house,\n\nSlisz was hiding in the basement and remained there even after he had been ordered out\n\nseveral times.\n\n       It was determined that the Neffs\u2014the owners of the residence\u2014had not given\n\nSlisz or the other individual who was apprehended, permission to be in the residence.\n\nThe State also presented evidence from the South Bend Code (Code) Enforcement\n\nDirector that the house was not on the demolition list.         Id. at 45, 52-53, 137-38.\n\nMoreover, the Code does not permit the \u201cscrapping\u201d of homes that are on the list. Id.\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\fAdditionally, Slisz told the police officers that he intended to scrap any materials of value\n\nfrom the residence. Id. at 105. He also admitted that a bag of tools containing a\n\nhacksaw, screwdriver, sandpaper and a pipe wrench, belonged to him. Id. at 100, 105.\n\n       Notwithstanding Slisz\u2019s contention that because there was no property of value in\n\nthe house and, therefore, he could not have had the intent to steal, our Supreme Court\n\nobserved in Baker v. State, that sufficient evidence of intent does not \u201cnecessarily\n\nrequire[ ] evidence that the defendant was near or approaching valuable property.\u201d 968\n\nN.E.2d 227, 231 (Ind. 2012). Rather, if there is evidence that the defendant committed an\n\nact which could support an inference that he was searching for something to steal, that is\n\nenough, regardless of any item\u2019s actual value. Id.\n\n       Finally, under these circumstances, which included Slisz\u2019s statement that he was\n\nlooking for things in the house that he might be able to \u201cscrap,\u201d the tools he was carrying,\n\nand his attempt to conceal himself from the police officers, it was reasonable for the jury\n\nto infer that Slisz intended to commit theft when he entered the house. As a result, we\n\nconclude that the evidence was sufficient to support Slisz\u2019s conviction for burglary, a\n\nclass C felony.\n\n       The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\nMAY, J., and MATHIAS, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f",
