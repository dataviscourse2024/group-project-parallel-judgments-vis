TRUDO, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                             MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n                 These are appeals pursuant to Anders v. California.1 In two causes consolidated for\n\ntrial, appellant David Wayne Stokes, Jr., pleaded guilty to the offenses of burglary of a building and\n\nburglary of a vehicle.2 In each cause, Stokes also pleaded true to the allegations in five enhancement\n\nparagraphs alleging five prior state-jail-felony convictions. During the plea hearing, the district court\n\ntook judicial notice of Stokes\u2019s signed judicial confessions, in which he admitted to the allegations\n\ncontained within the indictments. At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court found the\n\nevidence sufficient to support a finding of guilt but withheld that finding and reset the causes for\n\nsentencing.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n            386 U.S. 738 (1967).\n        2\n            See Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 30.02, .04.\n\f                At the sentencing hearing, the district court admitted into evidence a letter written\n\nby Stokes, in which he accepted \u201cfull responsibility for the charges\u201d against him, attempted to\n\nexplain why he had committed the burglaries, and asked the district court to place him on probation.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the district court sentenced Stokes to ten years\u2019 imprisonment in\n\neach cause, with the sentences to run concurrently. These appeals followed.\n\n                In each cause, Stokes\u2019s court-appointed counsel has filed a motion to withdraw\n\nsupported by a brief concluding that the appeal is frivolous and without merit. The brief meets\n\nthe requirements of Anders v. California by presenting a professional evaluation of the record\n\ndemonstrating why there are no arguable grounds to be advanced.3 Counsel has certified to the Court\n\nthat he has provided a copy of the motion and brief to Stokes, advised Stokes of his right to examine\n\nthe appellate record and file a pro se response, and supplied Stokes with a form motion for pro se\n\naccess to the appellate record.4 No pro se brief or other written response has been filed.\n\n                We have independently reviewed the record and agree with counsel that the\n\nappeals are frivolous and without merit. We find nothing in the record that might arguably support\n\nthe appeals. In each cause, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.\n\n                The judgments of conviction are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         See 386 U.S. at 744-45; see also Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75 (1988); High v. State,\n573 S.W.2d 807 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978); Currie v. State, 516 S.W.2d 684 (Tex. Crim. App. 1974);\nJackson v. State, 485 S.W.2d 553 (Tex. Crim.
