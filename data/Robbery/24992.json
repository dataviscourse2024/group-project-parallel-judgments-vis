I.C. \u00a7 18-2403. In exchange for his guilty\nplea, additional charges were dismissed including an allegation that he was a persistent violator.\nThe district court sentenced Mitcham to a unified term of seven years, with a minimum period of\nconfinement of three years. Mitcham appeals.\n       Sentencing is a matter for the trial court\u2019s discretion. Both our standard of review and the\nfactors to be considered in evaluating the reasonableness of the sentence are well established and\nneed not be repeated here. See State v. Hernandez, 121 Idaho 114, 117-18, 822 P.2d 1011, 1014-\n\n\n                                                1\n\f15 (Ct. App. 1991); State v. Lopez, 106 Idaho 447, 449-51, 680 P.2d 869, 871-73 (Ct. App.\n1984); State v. Toohill, 103 Idaho 565, 568, 650 P.2d 707, 710 (Ct. App. 1982). When reviewing\nthe length of a sentence, we consider the defendant\u2019s entire sentence. State v. Oliver, 144 Idaho\n722, 726, 170 P.3d 387, 391 (2007). Applying these standards, and having reviewed the record\nin this case, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion.\n       Therefore, Mitcham\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\f",
