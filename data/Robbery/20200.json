See Tex. Pen.\n\nCode Ann. ' 29.03 (West 1994). The district court adjudged him guilty and sentenced him to ten years in\n\nprison.\n\n                Appellant=s court-appointed attorney filed a brief concluding that the appeal is frivolous and\n\nwithout merit. The brief meets the requirements of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), by\n\npresenting a professional evaluation of the record demonstrating why there are no arguable grounds to be\n\nadvanced. See also Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75 (1988); High v. State, 573 S.W.2d 807 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1978); Currie v. State, 516 S.W.2d 684 (Tex. Crim. App. 1974); Jackson v. State, 485 S.W.2d\n\n553 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972); Gainous v. State, 436 S.W.2d 137 (Tex. Crim. App. 1969). A copy of\n\ncounsel=s brief was delivered to appellant, and appellant was advised of his right to examine the appellate\n\nrecord and to file a pro se brief. No pro se brief has been filed.\n\f                 We have reviewed the record and counsel=s brief and agree that the appeal is frivolous and\n\nwithout merit. We find nothing in the record that might arguably support the appeal. Counsel=s motion to\n\nwithdraw is granted.\n\n                 The judgment of conviction is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 Marilyn Aboussie, Chief Justice\n\nBefore Chief Justice Aboussie, Justices B. A. Smith and Yeakel\n\nAffirmed\n\nFiled: June 27, 2002\n\nDo Not Publish\n\n\n\n\n                                                     2\n\f",
