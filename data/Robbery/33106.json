Judgment reversed, on the law, and new trial ordered. The People concede that a new trial is warranted in this case. On the codefendant\u2019s appeal from his judgment of conviction, following a joint trial with the defendant, this court determined that he had not been afforded a fair and impartial trial (People v Rivera, 62 AD2d 1005). Hopkins, J. P., Martuscello, Latham and Hawkins, JJ., concur.\n",
