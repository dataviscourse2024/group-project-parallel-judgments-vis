See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN. \u00a7 74.351. By one issue, Quraishi contends that a claim based on a physical\n\faltercation arising from a physician\u2019s efforts to prevent a former employee from allegedly\n\nabsconding with patient medical records is a health care liability claim requiring an expert\n\nreport. We affirm.\n\n                                   I.     BACKGROUND\n\n       According to Ochoa\u2019s original petition, she was employed by Quraishi at the\n\nMiramar Interventional Pain Center for five years. Ochoa claims that throughout her\n\nemployment, Quraishi verbally and physically abused her. On June 20, 2018, Ochoa\n\nclaims Quraishi terminated her employment \u201cin a fit of rage\u201d and \u201cscreamed at her to leave\n\nhis clinic,\u201d stating he never wanted to see her again. Ochoa\u2019s pleading then alleges that\n\nwhen she went to collect her personal property, Quraishi \u201cphysically grabbed her by the\n\nshoulder, pushed her into a corner, and began viciously shaking her. [Quraishi] then\n\ninstructed another employee to lock the door to prevent [Ochoa] from leaving.\u201d Although\n\nOchoa requested to leave and made it clear that she did not want to stay, Quraishi\n\nallegedly \u201cblocked her progress and prevented her from leaving.\u201d Ochoa claims she left\n\nwhen her son came into the clinic to free her.\n\n       On October 30, 2019, Ochoa filed a lawsuit against Quraishi, alleging causes of\n\naction in tort for false imprisonment and assault. Quraishi filed his answer on February 4,\n\n2020, generally denying Ochoa\u2019s claims. On March 20, 2020, Quraishi filed a motion to\n\nstay the proceeding alleging that Ochoa\u2019s claims were health care liability claims requiring\n\nan expert report pursuant to Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code \u00a7 74.351. See id.\n\n       Quraishi argued the case was a health care liability lawsuit because he is a health\n\ncare provider. According to his motion, he terminated Ochoa on June 14, 2018, and not\n\n\n                                             2\n\fon June 20, 2018, as she alleged in her original petition. Quraishi contended that Ochoa\n\nstole patient files when she retrieved her belongings the day she was fired on June 14.\n\nWhen Ochoa returned to the office on June 20, 2018, employees allegedly noticed that\n\nshe was taking medical records again. Quraishi confronted Ochoa about her alleged theft\n\nwhen, according to him, Ochoa threatened him with a hammer. Quraishi then allegedly\n\ntold employees to lock Ochoa into an office until the police arrived to settle the matter.\n\nAccording to him, after the police inspected what Ochoa had in her possession, they\n\nreturned three patient files which included \u201cmedical history, demographics, credit card\n\ninformation[,] and other personal information.\u201d This allegation, however, is not reflected\n\nin the police report.\n\n       Ochoa, in her response, denied Quraishi\u2019s allegation that she was taking patient\n\nfiles. She disagreed that her lawsuit required an expert report and characterized the\n\nmotion to stay as a \u201cbaseless attempt to delay proceedings.\u201d In a reply brief, Quraishi\n\nattached portions of a non-certified police record, as well as three affidavits\u2014one from\n\nQuraishi and two from his current employees. The affidavits, in short, set forth that the\n\nclinic suspected that Ochoa had stolen patient records on the day she was terminated\u2014\n\nJune 14, 2018\u2014and that she did so again on June 20, 2018 before the files in her\n\npossession were allegedly returned by police.\n\n       On June 5, 2020, Quraishi filed a motion to dismiss Ochoa\u2019s lawsuit for Ochoa\u2019s\n\nfailure to provide an expert report pursuant to Chapter 74. See id. Ochoa again denied\n\nQuraishi\u2019s allegations and objected to the non-certified police record that was attached\n\nas evidence to the motion to dismiss. The trial court conducted a hearing on June 1, 2020\n\n\n                                            3\n\fon the motion to stay and on July 16, 2020 on the motion to dismiss. The trial court denied\n\nboth motions on August 25, 2020. Quraishi now appeals the denial of his motion to\n\ndismiss.\n\n                      II.    STANDARD OF REVIEW & APPLICABLE LAW\n\nA.     Standard of Review\n\n       An appellate court reviews a trial judge\u2019s decision on a motion to dismiss a claim\n\nunder \u00a7 74.351 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code for an abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Jernigan v. Langley, 195 S.W.3d 91, 93 (Tex. 2006); Am. Transitional Care Ctrs. of\n\nTex. v. Palacios, 46 S.W.3d 873, 875 (Tex. 2001). \u201cA trial court abuses its discretion if it\n\nacts in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner without reference to guiding rules or\n\nprinciples.\u201d Cayton v. Moore, 224 S.W.3d 440, 444 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2007, no pet.). A\n\ntrial court has no discretion in determining what the law is or in applying the law to the\n\nfacts. Id. at 445. A clear failure by the trial court to analyze or apply the law correctly will\n\nconstitute an abuse of discretion. Id.\n\n       Whether a claim is a health care liability claim under Chapter 74 is question of law\n\nthat is reviewed de novo. Baylor Scott & White, Hillcrest Med. Ctr. v. Weems, 575 S.W.3d\n\n357, 363 (Tex. 2019); CHRISTUS Health Gulf Coast v. Carswell, 505 S.W.3d 528, 534\n\n(Tex. 2016). When determining whether a lawsuit is a health care liability claim, courts\n\nshould \u201cconsider the entire court record, including the pleadings, motions and responses,\n\nand relevant evidence properly admitted.\u201d Loaisiga v. Cerda, 379 S.W.3d 248, 258 (Tex.\n\n2012). Courts must consider the underlying nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim rather than its\n\nlabel, such that \u201ca party cannot avoid Chapter 74\u2019s requirements and limitations through\n\n\n                                               4\n\fartful pleading.\u201d Weems, 575 S.W.3d at 363.\n\n       If a claim is a health care liability claim, a claimant shall serve on the defendant\n\nhealth care provider an expert report not later than the 120th day after the date the\n\ndefendant\u2019s answer is filed. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 74.351(a). If the\n\nexpert report has not been served within the period specified, the trial court must dismiss\n\nthe claim with respect to the health care provider with prejudice to the refiling of the claim.\n\nSee id. \u00a7 74.351(b).\n\nB.     Applicable Law\n\n       The Texas Medical Liability Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) aims to strike a \u201ccareful balance\n\nbetween eradicating frivolous claims and preserving meritorious ones.\u201d Weems, 575\n\nS.W.3d at 362\u201363 (citing Leland v. Brandal, 257 S.W.3d 204, 208 (Tex. 2008)). The\n\nexpert report serves as a threshold requirement to eliminate frivolous lawsuits \u201cbefore\n\nlitigation gets underway.\u201d Id.; see Spectrum Healthcare Res., Inc. v. McDaniel, 306\n\nS.W.3d 249, 253 (Tex. 2010).\n\n       A health care liability claim contains three basic elements: (1) a physician or health\n\ncare provider must be a defendant; (2) the claim or claims at issue must concern\n\ntreatment, lack of treatment, or a departure from accepted standards of medical care, or\n\nhealth care, or safety or professional or administrative services directly related to health\n\ncare; and (3) the defendant\u2019s act or omission complained of must proximately cause the\n\ninjury to the claimant. Texas West Oaks Hosp., L.P. v. Williams, 371 S.W.3d 171, 179\u2013\n\n80 (Tex. 2012); see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 74.001(a)(13). To determine if a\n\ncase is a health care liability claim, the focus is not the status of the claimant but rather\n\n\n                                              5\n\fthe gravamen of the claim or claims against the health care provider. See Williams, 371\n\nS.W.3d at 179\u201380. \u201cWhen a claim brought against a health care provider is \u2018based on\n\nfacts implicating the defendant's conduct during the course of a patient\u2019s care, treatment,\n\nor confinement,\u2019 a rebuttable presumption arises that it is a health care liability claim for\n\npurposes of the Medical Liability Act.\u201d Weems, 575 S.W.3d at 363 (quoting Loaisiga, 379\n\nS.W.3d at 256).\n\n       To rebut the claim of a health care liability claim, the plaintiff must show: (1) that\n\nher allegation did not contain a complaint about an act related to medical or health care\n\nservices other than the alleged offensive contact; (2) the alleged offensive contact was\n\nnot pursuant to actual or implied consent by the plaintiff; and (3) the only possible\n\nrelationship between the alleged offensive contact and the rendition of medical services\n\nor healthcare was the setting in which the act took place. Loaisiga, 379 S.W.3d at 257.\n\n                                      III.   ANALYSIS\n\n       Quraishi meets the first and third elements of a health care liability claim: he is the\n\ndefendant physician in this case and Ochoa has alleged that his actions caused her injury.\n\nWilliams, 371 S.W.3d 179\u201380; see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 74.001(a)(13).\n\nThe focus of our analysis, therefore, is on the second element: whether the claim at issue\n\nconcerns \u201ctreatment, lack of treatment, or a departure from accepted standards of medical\n\ncare, or health care, or safety or professional or administrative services directly related to\n\nhealth care.\u201d See Williams, 371 S.W.3d 179\u201380; TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN. \u00a7 74.001(a)(13).\n\n       Here, the initial police report regarding the June 20, 2018, incident between Ochoa\n\n\n                                              6\n\fand Quraishi mentioned the issue of patient records. 1 Quraishi, in the affidavit he\n\nsubmitted as evidence for his motion for stay, testified that the patient records police\n\nretrieved from Ochoa on June 20, 2018 contained his patients\u2019 \u201cmedical history,\n\ndemographics, credit card information and other personal information.\u201d Quraishi\u2019s\n\nemployee Melinda Segovia testified by affidavit that Ochoa took \u201cpatient files and office\n\nproperty\u201d the day she was terminated and attempted to do the same on June 20, 2018.\n\nAnother employee, Linda Cantu, testified that \u201c[Ochoa] had patient files in her hand and\n\n[Quraishi] was trying to prevent her from leaving with those patient files\u201d and that \u201cafter\n\nthe police inspected what [Ochoa] had in her hands, they returned the items to\n\n[Quraishi]. . . . When we looked at the files, we saw that she had taken patient files with\n\nmedical records along with some communication logs that all belonged to the office.\u201d In\n\nlight of the foregoing, we conclude Quraishi created a presumption that this lawsuit may\n\nbe a healthcare liability claim. See Weems, 575 S.W.3d at 363 (quoting Loaisiga, 379\n\nS.W.3d at 256).\n\n        We now analyze whether Ochoa conclusively rebutted the presumption that this is\n\na health care liability claim. See Loaisiga, 379 S.W.3d at 257. In Loaisiga, the Texas\n\nSupreme Court set forth a clear test to defeat a rebuttable presumption:\n\n        We conclude that a claim against a medical or health care provider for\n        assault is not an HCLC if the record conclusively shows that (1) there is no\n        complaint about any act of the provider related to medical or health care\n        services other than the alleged offensive contact, (2) the alleged offensive\n        contact was not pursuant to actual or implied consent by the plaintiff, and\n        (3) the only possible relationship between the alleged offensive contact and\n        the rendition of medical services or healthcare was the setting in which the\n        act took place.\n\n        1Although Ochoa objected that the police report Quraishi submitted as an exhibit to his motion to\nstay was not certified, Ochoa did not get a ruling on this objection.\n                                                   7\n\fId. Reviewing the record, we conclude Ochoa decisively rebuts the health care liability\n\npresumption. Id. at 257\u201358. First, Ochoa\u2019s pleadings allege false imprisonment and\n\nassault by a former employer\u2014there is no complaint whatsoever about Quraishi\u2019s\n\n\u201cmedical or health care services\u201d other than the alleged offensive conduct. Id. at 257; see\n\nT.C. v. Kayass, 535 S.W.3d 169, 174 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2017, no pet.) (holding that\n\nthe gravamen of plaintiff\u2019s sexual assault complaint against the defendant physician was\n\n\u201crelated to his offensive, intentional conduct, not his alleged violation of the confidentiality\n\nof the information of the chart\u201d when defendant used his pediatric patient\u2019s medical chart\n\nto get the plaintiff mother\u2019s phone number). Second, Ochoa did not \u201cactually\u201d or \u201cimpliedly\u201d\n\nconsent to being physically grabbed by the shoulder, pushed into a corner, and shaken,\n\nor to being locked in an office. See Loaisiga, 379 S.W.3d at 257. Third, the only\n\nrelationship to the \u201crendition of medical services or healthcare\u201d is the fact that these\n\nalleged actions occurred at Quraishi\u2019s clinic, the Miramar Interventional Pain Center. Id.;\n\nsee Drewery v. Adventist Health Sys./Tex., Inc., 344 S.W.3d 498, 504 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin\n\n2011, pet. denied) (stating that \u201cif the essence of the plaintiff's suit\u2014and the injury for\n\nwhich he seeks damages\u2014is the intentional assault,\u201d then \u201cthe reviewing court would be\n\nwrong to ignore the intentional conduct and instead focus on the potentially infinite\n\nsecondary consequences that might have also resulted in the context of the medical or\n\nhealth-care procedure\u201d); see also Brown v. Nocar, No. 13-19-00503-CV, 2021 WL\n\n1418222, at *4 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg Apr. 15, 2021, pet. filed) (mem. op.)\n\n(holding that multiple claims for sexual assault were not health care liability claims when\n\nsome of the acts occurred in the defendant\u2019s medical office). Ochoa thus meets all of the\n\n                                               8\n\felements to thoroughly rebut the health care liability presumption. See Loaisiga, 379\n\nS.W.3d at 257. We hold this is is not a health care liability claim. This is an employment\n\ndispute with allegations of a physical altercation and a possible theft.\n\n       Because this was not a healthcare liability suit, Ochoa was not required to file an\n\nexpert report. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 74.351. Thus, the trial court did\n\nnot err in denying Quraishi\u2019s motion to dismiss. See id. We overrule Quraishi\u2019s sole issue.\n\n                                    IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n                                                                LETICIA HINOJOSA\n                                                                Justice\n\n\nDelivered and filed on the\n31st day of August, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f",
