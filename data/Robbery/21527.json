We affirm.\n\n     The trial court set forth the following procedural history:\n\n                 From on or about May 20, 2013, through\n           November 2014, the Defendant was charged with\n           numerous violations of the Crimes Code.[Footnote 1]\n           At a point in time thereafter, the Defendant was\n           lodged in the Luzerne County Correctional Facility\n           (LCCF) in lieu of bail pending a competency hearing,\n           which initially was requested by the Commonwealth\n           on June 2, 2014. This Court issued an Order on\n           June 4, 2014, and a hearing was ultimately held on\n           Jan. 27, 2015, after multiple continuance requests,\n           in part, to complete the professional evaluations.\n\n\n\n* Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ. S14009/16\n\n\n                On February 17, 2015, after a comprehensive\n          hearing with evidence presented by experts for the\n          Commonwealth[Footnote 2] and Defendant, this\n          Court ruled that the Defendant was incompetent to\n          proceed to trial and issued an Order consistent with\n          our holding.\n\n                 Subsequently, a timely notice of appeal was\n          filed on March 18, 2015, and upon receipt of same\n          we directed the Commonwealth to file a concise\n          statement of errors complained of on appeal\n          pursuant to PA.R.A.P. 1925(b). The Commonwealth\n          filed the required statement on April 21, 2015,\n          alleging the following error: \u201cThe Court abused its\n          discretion when it found the Defendant incompetent\n          to stand trial in light of evidence that showed he did\n          have an ability to recall past events, including but\n          not limited to, the name of his attorney, that he has\n          been found incompetent, his date of birth, his receipt\n          of Social Security benefits and his daily routine.\u201d\n\n               [Footnote 1] By way of example, the\n               crimes alleged consisted of retail theft,\n               defiant trespass, use /possession of drug\n               paraphernalia, and a summary charge for\n               trespass.\n\n               [Footnote 2] The Commonwealth also\n               presented the lay testimony of a Wilkes-\n               Barre City Police Officer regarding his\n               observations and interaction with the\n               Defendant. We do not believe that the\n               time frame of the officer\u2019s observations\n               and interactions, in particular his\n               conversations with the Defendant and his\n               brother for approximately one hour four\n               years previously, aids our determination\n               of Defendant\u2019s present capacity. Nor is\n               Defendant\u2019s ability to identify one of\n               several attorneys representing him to\n               police significant to our decision.   In\n               addition, the issue is not whether the\n               Defendant is mute, but rather whether\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fJ. S14009/16\n\n\n                  he is legally competent to stand trial in\n                  these cases.\n\n                  For the reasons that follow we find the\n            Commonwealth\u2019s error complained of devoid of\n            merit.\n\nTrial court opinion, 6/22/15 at 1-2.\n\n      The Commonwealth raises one issue for our review:\n\n            1.    Whether the trial court abused its discretion\n                  when it found the Defendant incompetent to\n                  stand trial when the record shows the\n                  Defendant has the ability to understand the\n                  nature of the proceedings against him and can\n                  participate in his own defense?\n\nCommonwealth\u2019s brief at 4.\n\n                  A defendant is presumed to be competent to\n            stand trial. Thus, the burden is on the defendant to\n            prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he\n            was incompetent to stand trial. In order to prove\n            that he was incompetent, the defendant must\n            establish that he was either unable to understand\n            the nature of the proceedings against him or unable\n            to participate in his own defense.\n\n                  Stated otherwise, the relevant question in a\n            competency determination is whether the defendant\n            has sufficient ability at the pertinent time to consult\n            with counsel with a reasonable degree of rational\n            understanding, and to have a rational as well as a\n            factual understanding of the proceedings.\n\n                  We extend great deference to the trial judge\u2019s\n            determination as to competency because he or she\n            had the opportunity to observe directly a defendant\u2019s\n            behavior. Furthermore, we note that it is a proper\n            exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion to accept one\n            expert witness\u2019s opinion over that of a conflicting\n            opinion where the record adequately supports such a\n            resolution.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fJ. S14009/16\n\n\n\nCommonwealth v. Flor, 998 A.2d 606, 617-618 (Pa. 2010) (citation\n\nomitted).   The issue in a competency determination is whether the\n\ndefendant is able to cooperate with counsel, not whether he is actually\n\ncooperating. Id. at 618 (citations omitted).\n\n     Here, the trial court held a competency hearing prior to finding\n\nappellee incompetent to proceed to trial. Two expert witnesses testified for\n\nthe defense: Michael Allan Church, Ph.D., who was admitted as an expert in\n\nthe field of psychology without objection; and Richard Fischbein, a board\n\ncertified forensic psychiatrist who was admitted as an expert in the field of\n\nforensic psychiatry without objection. The Commonwealth called one expert\n\nwitness: John Sebastian O\u2019Brien, III, a board-certified forensic psychiatrist\n\nwho was admitted as an expert in the field of psychiatry and forensic\n\npsychiatry without objection. The Commonwealth also called a lay witness:\n\nOfficer Robert Collins of the Wilkes-Barre Police Department.\n\n     The court set forth in detail its reasons for declining to accept the\n\nopinion of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert. The court concluded as follows:\n\n                  While Dr. O\u2019Brien was of the opinion that the\n            Defendant was competent to stand trial, he\n            nonetheless agreed with Dr. Fischbein\u2019s diagnosis, in\n            that the Defendant suffered from a neuro-cognitive\n            impairment.[] Where the experts disagree is with\n            respect to how limited the Defendant is.\n            Dr. Fischbein opined the Defendant is significantly\n            impaired.     In that regard, this Court finds\n            Dr. Fischbein the more credible and persuasive\n            witness.\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fJ. S14009/16\n\n\n                  Dr. Fischbein provided other indicia of\n           Defendant\u2019s cognitive impairment to include noting\n           the Defendant has a representative payee for\n           purposes of administering his Social Security\n           Disability benefit. He also stated that he did not\n           believe the Defendant had the ability to feign his\n           condition noting Dr. Saxton, Dr. Berger, and he were\n           of a similar opinion as to his lack of competency.\n           The doctor testified it would be difficult for Defendant\n           over a period of time from 1998 to the present to be\n           consistent in order to fool multiple psychiatrists and\n           he did not believe the Defendant smart enough to\n           fool all of the doctors that had been involved to date.\n\n                  Based upon all of the aforementioned\n           testimony[Footnote         12]    and    in     particular\n           Dr. Fischbein\u2019s reliance, in part, upon objective\n           testing, we do not believe Defendant has \u201c. . .\n           sufficient ability at [this time] to consult with counsel\n           with a reasonable degree of rational understanding,\n           and [to] have a rational as well as a factual\n           understanding of the proceedings[]\u201d [citing to\n           Commonwealth v. Pruitt, 951 A.2d 307, 316 (Pa.\n           2008) (emphasis added by trial court).]\n\n                 [Footnote 12] Our decision is in part\n                 based upon this Court\u2019s observations of\n                 Defendant\u2019s demeanor and bearing.\n\nTrial court opinion, 6/22/15 at 6-7 (Footnote 11 omitted).\n\n     Despite the trial court\u2019s thorough analysis, the Commonwealth claims\n\nthat the trial court abused its discretion because it ignored the record as a\n\nwhole, especially the testimony of the lay witness that the Commonwealth\n\nclaims contradicted Dr. Fischbein\u2019s conclusion that appellee has no long-term\n\nrecall. (Commonwealth\u2019s brief at 10-11.) In essence, the Commonwealth\n\nsimply disagrees with the way that the trial court weighed the evidence as to\n\nappellee\u2019s incompetency and the court\u2019s ultimate determination based on\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJ. S14009/16\n\n\nthat evidence.    Accordingly, the Commonwealth requests this court to\n\nreconsider the matter anew. That we will not do. Because the trial court\n\nprovided a well-articulated and compelling rationale for its incompetency\n\nfinding that is grounded in testimonial evidence and supported by the\n\nrecord, we will not disturb its determination.\n\n      Order affirmed.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
