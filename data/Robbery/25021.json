F-2014-2221-D, F-2014-2222-D, F-2014-2223-D\n\n                                  ----------\n\n                       MEMORANDUM OPINION1\n\n                                  ----------\n\n     On October 16, 2015, appellant Jordan Bajonero-Palma pleaded guilty to\n\nand was convicted of possession of a controlled substance, committed on March\n\n23, 2014; aggravated robbery, committed on April 7, 2014; and two counts of\n\naggravated robbery, both committed on April 6, 2014. The trial court assessed\n\n\n     1\n      See Tex. R. App. P. 47.4.\n\fhis punishment at concurrent sentences of two years, twenty-five years, and\n\ntwenty-five years, respectively.      In each case, the trial court certified that\n\nAppellant had the right to appeal. See Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(a)(2). Appellant did\n\nnot file a motion for new trial in the trial court, but did file pro se notices of appeal\n\nfrom the trial court\u2019s judgments on April 25, 2016.\n\n      On June 3 and July 21, 2016, we notified Appellant that we did not believe\n\nwe had jurisdiction over his appeals because the notices of appeal had not been\n\nfiled timely. See Tex. R. App. P. 26.2(a). We warned Appellant that we would\n\ndismiss his appeals for want of jurisdiction unless he or any other party\n\nresponded showing grounds to continue the appeals. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.3.\n\nAppellant responded that his notices were untimely because his attorney \u201csaid he\n\nwas going to file a notice of appeal\u201d but \u201cdid not.\u201d\n\n      Our appellate jurisdiction is triggered through a timely filed notice of\n\nappeal. Olivo v. State, 918 S.W.2d 519, 522 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996). If a notice\n\nof appeal is not timely filed under Rule 26.2, we do not have jurisdiction to\n\naddress the merits of the appeal and may take no action\u2014including granting an\n\nout-of-time appeal\u2014other than dismissal. Slaton v. State, 981 S.W.2d 208, 210\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1998). Rule 26.2(a) requires that a notice of appeal be filed\n\nwithin thirty days after the date the trial court imposes sentence. Tex. R. App. P.\n\n26.2(a). Appellant did not file his notices of appeal within thirty days of the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s imposition of sentences; thus, we have no jurisdiction over his appeals\n\nand dismiss them. See Tex. R. App. P. 43.2(f).\n\n\n                                           2\n\f                                         /s/ Lee Gabriel\n\n                                         LEE GABRIEL\n                                         JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: LIVINGSTON, C.J.; GABRIEL and SUDDERTH, JJ.\n\nDO NOT PUBLISH\nTex.
