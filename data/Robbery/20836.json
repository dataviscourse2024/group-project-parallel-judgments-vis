Troy Chemical\n\nCorporation (Troy Chemical) and the Teamsters Union Local No. 408\n\n(the Union) are parties to a collective bargaining agreement\n\n(CBA).   On April 23, 1991, Troy Chemical discharged four\n\nemployees for theft of company property and immediately notified\n\nthe union shop steward of the discharges.   No grievances were\n\nfiled by the Union or the individuals pursuant to the CBA.\n\n           On January 28, 1993, the Union notified the New Jersey\n\nState Board of Mediation that a dispute existed over the\n\ndischarge of one of the four employees, and requested that an\n\narbitrator be selected.   On May 14, 1993, the mediation board\n\nadvised the parties that an arbitrator had been selected and a\n\nhearing was scheduled for October 20, 1993.   On May 24, 1993,\n\nTroy Chemical commenced an action in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of New Jersey seeking a declaratory\n\njudgment that any disputes over the discharged four employees\n\nwere not arbitrable because the Union had not complied with the\n\ngrievance procedure.1\n\n          The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nThe district court denied Troy Chemical's motion and granted the\n\nUnion's motion for summary judgment, holding that the parties had\n\nmodified by past practice the CBA provision pertaining to the\n\n\n1\n . The district court exercised subject matter jurisdiction\npursuant to section 3 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 185. We have jurisdiction over this appeal from a final\norder under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\n\fgrievance procedure for discharges and that the grievances\n\nregarding the four employees were arbitrable.     Troy Chemical\n\nappealed.    We reverse.\n\n                                 I.\n\n            The Union represents production and maintenance\n\nemployees of Troy Chemical's Newark, New Jersey specialty\n\nchemicals manufacturing facility.     Article 11 of the CBA2\n\n\n2\n.   The pertinent provisions of the Article 11 are:\n\n            A. Should any difference, grievance, dispute\n            or complaint between the Company and the\n            Union or any employees arise out of the\n            interpretation or application of the\n            Agreement, there shall be an earnest effort\n            on the part of both parties to settle same\n            promptly and through the steps hereinafter\n            set forth, it being understood and agreed\n            that no grievance shall be accepted for\n            consideration unless reduced to writing and\n            presented in the first step within two (2)\n            working days of the occurrence of the\n            incident causing the grievance. This shall\n            not, however, apply to grievances involving\n            payroll calculation.\n\n                                * * *\n\n            The dispute referred to herein shall include,\n            but shall not be limited to disputes\n            concerning the discharge of an employee . . .\n            .\n\n                                * * *\n\n            C. Except as expressly provided otherwise in\n            this Agreement, with respect to any dispute\n            which is required to be submitted to\n            arbitration pursuant to the Agreement,\n            including strikes, stoppages, lockouts and\n            any and all claims, demands and acts arising\n            therefrom which are subject to arbitration,\n            the procedure established in this Agreement\n\fprovides that no grievance shall be accepted for consideration\n\nunless reduced to writing and presented within two working days\n\nof the occurrence of the incident causing the grievance.    The\n\nonly exception to this requirement is grievances involving\n\npayroll calculations.   Step two of the grievance procedure\n\nrequires a conference between representatives of Troy Chemical\n\nand the Union within three days of the incident giving rise to\n\nthe grievance.   If there is no settlement of the dispute after\n\nthe completion of these two steps, then the matter may be\n\nsubmitted to arbitration.   Paragraph A of article 11 states,\n\n\"[t]he dispute referred to herein shall include, but shall not be\n\nlimited to disputes concerning the discharge of an employee.\"\n\nParagraph C of article 11 provides that, \"the procedure\n\nestablished in this Agreement for the adjustment of said dispute\n\nshall be the exclusive means for its determination.\"    Article 11\n\nhas remained unchanged in the more than 15 years of successive\n\nthree year collective bargaining agreements between the parties.\n\n          The district court acknowledged that express contract\n\nlanguage made it \"abundantly clear that a written grievance is to\n\nbe submitted . . . for all disputes concerning discharged\n\nemployees.\"   Nevertheless, the court found that the parties had\n\nhistorically acquiesced in the waiving of the grievance procedure\n\nin connection with discharges.   Relying on New Jersey law, the\n\ncourt held that the parties had modified the CBA by their\n\n(..continued)\n          for the adjustment of said dispute shall be\n          the exclusive means for its determination.\n\fpractice of ignoring steps 1 and 2 of the grievance procedure in\n\nconnection with discharges, and therefore, the grievances\n\nregarding the four employees were arbitrable.   In his opinion,\n\nthe arbitrator repeatedly noted that he was bound by the district\n\ncourt's legal and factual conclusions that the grievance was\n\nprocedurally and substantively arbitrable.\n\n          On appeal, Troy Chemical contends that the district\n\ncourt erred in ruling on matters of procedural arbitrability and\n\nin holding that parties had modified the express terms of the CBA\n\nby disregarding the grievance procedure provisions pertaining to\n\nemployee discharge.   The Union takes the position that the\n\ndistrict court correctly found a waiver of the grievance\n\nprocedure steps based on the past practices of the parties.\n\n                               II.\n\n          This court exercises plenary review over a grant of\n\nsummary judgment, and we apply the same test the district court\n\nshould have utilized initially.   Oritani Sav. and Loan Ass'n v.\n\nFidelity and Deposit Co., 989 F.2d 635, 637 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate only when it is demonstrated that\n\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\n\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.   Celotex Corp.\nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-32 (1986); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).       An\n\nissue of material fact is genuine \"if the evidence is such that a\n\nreasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).    In\n\ndeciding a motion for summary judgment, all reasonable inferences\n\nmust be drawn in favor of the non-movant.    Oritani, 989 F.2d at\n\f638.   We therefore conclude that the appropriate standard of\n\nreview is plenary, rather than clearly erroneous, as suggested by\n\nthe Union.\n\n           The law governing the proper forum for determining\n\nvarious issues of arbitrability is set forth by the United States\n\nSupreme Court in John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U.S.\n\n543 (1964).   In that case, a dispute arose between the employer\n\nand the union over whether the contract covered the merged\n\nemployees of the successor company, and whether the union's\n\nfailure to follow the grievance procedure foreclosed arbitration.\n\nThe Court stated that the first issue was a matter of substantive\n\narbitrability to be decided by the court, but that the issue of\n\nwhether the failure to adhere to the grievance mechanism barred\n\narbitration was a procedural question for the arbitrator.    The\n\nCourt explained:\n          It would be a curious rule which required\n          that intertwined issues of \"substance and\n          procedure\" growing out of the same facts had\n          to be carved up between two different forums,\n          one deciding after the other. Neither logic\n          nor considerations of policy compel such a\n          result.\n\nId. at 557.   The Court concluded:\n\n           Once it is determined, as we have, that the\n           parties are obligated to submit the subject\n           matter of a dispute to arbitration,\n           \"procedural\" questions which grow out of the\n           dispute and bear on its final disposition\n           should be left to the arbitrator.\n\n\nId.\n\f          Several years later, the Supreme Court reiterated its\n\nview that procedural arbitrability should be resolved by\n\narbitrators, not the courts.   In International Union of Operating\n\nEngineers v. Flair Builders, Inc., 406 U.S. 487 (1972), the\n\ncompany opposed arbitration on the grounds that the union's long\n\ndelay in filing for arbitration constituted laches.     The court of\n\nappeals upheld the district court's ruling that the issue of\n\nwhether laches existed was one to be decided by the court, not\n\nthe arbitrator.   The Supreme Court disagreed, observing that the\n\ncontract between the parties stated that the grievance and\n\narbitration procedure should be applied to \"any difference\" that\n\narose between the parties, and the question whether the\n\narbitration was barred by laches was \"a difference\" to be decided\n\nby the arbitrator.   406 U.S. at 491.   Relying on Wiley, the Court\n\nemphasized that a court should determine in the first instance\n\nwhether the parties had in fact agreed to arbitrate the subject\n\nmatter, \"[b]ut once a court finds, as here, the parties are\n\nsubject to an agreement to arbitrate, and that agreement extends\n\nto 'any difference' between them, then a claim that particular\n\ngrievances are barred by laches is an arbitrable question under\n\nthe agreement.\"   Id. at 491-92.\n          In the present action, article 11 of the CBA speaks of\n\n\"any difference, grievance, dispute or complaint\" and\n\nunambiguously states that \"disputes concerning the discharge of\n\nan employee\" are subject to the grievance procedure and\n\narbitration.   Thus, whether the Union and Troy Chemical had by\n\npractice waived steps 1 and 2 of the grievance procedure was a\n\fquestion of procedure for the arbitrator and not the court.     See\n\nAssociation of Flight Attendants, AFL-CIO v. USAir, Inc., 960\n\nF.2d 345, 349 (3d Cir. 1992) (holding that once the court\n\ndetermines that the underlying grievance is covered by the\n\narbitration clause, the court's role ends; \"[b]eyond this, the\n\ncourt usurps the exclusive function of the arbitrator when it\n\nventures to decide procedural matters, or the merits of a\n\ngrievance arising under the collective bargaining agreement\").\n\n            It is only on appeal that the Union argues that the\n\ndistrict court properly considered whether the parties waived the\n\ngrievance procedure steps based on their past practices.    In its\n\nanswer to the complaint for declaratory judgment, the Union\n\naverred as an affirmative defense that the plaintiff has not\n\nchallenged the substantive arbitrability of the dispute, but\n\nraises only questions of procedural arbitrability, which are for\n\nthe arbitrator not the court to decide.    Moreover, before the\n\ndistrict court, the Union argued that under well-settled\n\nprinciples of labor law the issues of arbitrability and waiver\n\nare committed to the arbitrator.    The Union stated in its brief,\n\n\"[t]he Union does not ask this Court to decide these questions.\n\nOn the contrary, it is not this Court's function to do so.\n\nRather, these issues are proper subjects for the arbitrator in\n\ndetermining whether the grievance is barred by procedural\n\ndefects.\"\n\n            Therefore, once the district court found that the\n\ndischarges were subject to arbitration, the court should have\n\ndenied the declaratory judgment and held that the issue of\n\fwhether the grievances were barred by procedural defects was\n\narbitrable.    The district court erred in deciding the procedural\n\nquestions and foreclosing that issue from the arbitrator's\n\ndecision.\n\n                                III.\n\n            Finally, the district court erred in granting the\n\nUnion's motion for summary judgment because the record shows that\n\nthere are disputed questions of fact.     For example, the Union\n\nlists the names of employees who previously arbitrated without\n\nfollowing the grievance procedure provisions, but it does not\n\ngive any specific dates or the names of the arbitrators, and all\n\nof the cases alleged to have waived the grievance procedure were\n\nwritten before the last CBA was entered into in 1989. In light of\n\nthe vagueness of the Union's evidence and the subsequent renewal\n\nof the grievance procedure provisions in the CBA now before us\n\nfor construction, there is a question as to whether the Union's\n\nevidence is credible.\n\n            Additionally, the Union avers by affidavit that\n\ndischarges were treated differently because the contract language\n\nin article 11 treats the discharge as a unique part of grievance\n\nwith special rights, and that Union representatives met with\n\nAlexander Gerardo, Troy Chemical's Vice President of Human\n\nResources, and that he advised them to wait to submit this matter\n\nto arbitration because he expected a quick investigation of the\n\narrests by the law enforcement people.3    Yet, the Union fails to\n\n3\n . The Union further avers that as a practical matter, Troy\nChemical knows what the grievance is in discharge cases, i.e.,\n\fpoint to any such language that gives discharge cases any special\n\nrights or shows that they are treated differently.   In fact, the\n\ngrievance forms provided by the Union to its members specifically\n\ncautioned that all complaints or grievances must be in writing,\n\nproperly signed by the members and shop steward.   \"Unless\n\ncompleted in detail, the grievance will not be acted upon.\"\n\nMoreover, Gerardo, by his affidavit, denies having met with Union\n\nrepresentatives and denies that he discussed the issue of the\n\ntimeliness of the filing or instructed the Union to delay in\n\npursuing this matter at any step in the required procedures.\n\nGerardo further avers that Troy Chemical did not enter into any\n\nunderstandings or agreements which relieved the Union from their\n\nobligation in the grievance procedure.   Troy Chemical, as the\n\nnon-moving party, was entitled to all reasonable inferences.\n\nUpon remand, these factual disputes are matters that should be\n\nresolved by the arbitrator.\n\n                              IV.\n\n          The district court exceeded its authority in\n\ndetermining whether the grievance procedure had been complied\n\nwith and whether there had been a modification of article 11.\n\nOnce the court decided that the discharges were subject to\n\narbitration, it should have held that the dispute was arbitrable\n\nand that matters relating to compliance with the grievance\n(..continued)\nthe Union is aggrieving the discharge of particular persons.\nHowever, the purpose of the grievance procedure is not merely to\ngive notice, but rather it is to give the parties the opportunity\nto confer, ascertain the facts, and promptly settle the matter in\nthe workshop, if that is at all possible.\n\fprocedure or a waiver were matters for the arbitrator.\n\n          Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be\n\nvacated and the case remanded to the district court with\n\ninstructions to return the case to the arbitrator for de novo\n\nconsideration.
