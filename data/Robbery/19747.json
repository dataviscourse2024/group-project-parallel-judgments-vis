FILED DECEMBER 10, 2014\n\n        Appellant, Jamal Clark, appeals from the judgment of sentence\n\nentered December 3, 2012, by the Honorable Chris R. Wogan, Court of\n\nCommon Pleas of Philadelphia County. We affirm.\n\n        A lengthy recitation of the facts and procedural history is unnecessary\n\nto our disposition of this case.          Following a waiver trial, Appellant was\n\nconvicted of robbery,1 carrying a firearm without a license,2 theft by unlawful\n\ntaking,3 and carrying a firearm in public in Philadelphia.4 On December 3,\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n*\n    Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n1\n    18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3701(a)(1)(ii).\n2\n    18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6106(a)(1).\n3\n    18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3921(a).\n4\n    18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6108.\n\fJ-S65002-14\n\n\n\n2012, Appellant was sentenced to five to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, to be\n\nfollowed by three years\u2019 probation. This appeal followed.\n\n       On appeal, Clark argues that the Commonwealth failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence that he was the perpetrator of the crimes for which he\n\nwas convicted.        Initially, we are obliged to note that the entirety of\n\nAppellant\u2019s brief is largely composed of run-on sentences and is replete with\n\nspelling and punctuation errors. Most egregiously, Appellant cites only two\n\nRules of Evidence in support of his claims \u2013 Appellant cites to no relevant\n\ncase law or other pertinent statute.5            As Appellant simply provides no\n\ndiscussion of pertinent legal authority to support his claim that the evidence\n\npertaining to identification was insufficient to support his convictions, we are\n\nconstrained to find this issue is waived. Commonwealth v. Love, 896 A.2d\n\n1276, 1278 (Pa. Super. 2005) (\u201cArguments not appropriately developed are\n\nwaived.\u201d); Commonwealth v. Russell, 665 A.2d 1239 (Pa. Super. 1995)\n\n(Superior Court would not review argument that contained no citation to or\n\ndiscussion of relevant legal authority).\n\n       Rather than addressing the identification issue, Appellant\u2019s brief, such\n\nthat it is, addresses the argument that the trial court improperly admitted\n\nthe testimony of the assistant district attorney who handled Appellant\u2019s\n____________________________________________\n\n\n5\n  Appellant readily admits in the portion of his brief entitled \u201cTable of Cases\nCited\u201d that \u201cNO CASES WERE CITED[.]\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at iii (capitalization\nin original).\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S65002-14\n\n\npreliminary hearing.   This precise issue was not raised in Appellant\u2019s Rule\n\n1925(b) statement of matters complained of on appeal. See Rule 1925(b)\n\nstatement, 7/15/13. Therefore, we are constrained to find this issue, too, is\n\nwaived.   See Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)(4)(vii); Commonwealth v. Melvin, ---\n\nA.3d ---, ---, 2014 WL 4100200 at *28 (Pa. Super., filed Aug. 21, 2014).\n\n     As we find that Appellant has waived the claims presented on appeal,\n\nwe affirm his judgment of sentence.\n\n     Judgment of sentence affirmed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D. Seletyn, Esq.\nProthonotary\n\n\n\nDate: 12/10/2014\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f",
