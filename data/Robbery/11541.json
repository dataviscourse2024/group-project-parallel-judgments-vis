WELLES, JUDGE\n\f                                         OPINION\n\n        This is an appeal pursuant to Rule 3 of the Tennessee Rules of Appe llate\n\nProcedure. The issue raised in this appeal is whether the trial judge erred or\n\nabused his discretion in denying the Defendant\u2019s petition to suspend the balance\n\nof his effective six-year sentence without conducting a hearing on the merits of\n\nthe petition. We have determined that this appeal should be dismissed.\n\n\n\n        On January 1, 1995 and March 6, 1995, pursuant to a plea agreement, the\n\nDefendant entered guilty pleas to three counts of aggravated burglary and one\n\ncount of burg lary. His plea agreement was a \u201cpacka ge dea l,\u201d in which the State\n\nagreed to dismiss other ch arges a gainst the Defen dant. 1 The plea agreement\n\nprovided that two of the Defendant\u2019s three-year sentences would be served\n\nconsecutively to produce an effective sentence of six years to be served in the\n\nDavidson County R egional Workhouse. Neither the Defendant\u2019s \u201cpetition to enter\n\nplea of guilty\u201d nor the judgment documents reflect any agreement concerning a\n\nsuspension of any portion of the sentences. An order was entered stating that\n\nas a p art of the plea a greem ent the Defe ndan t had a greed to drug treatm ent in\n\na program called \u201cLife Line Drug Treatment program,\u201d and one of the judgment\n\ndocum ents listed a s a spec ial condition , \u201cLife Lines .\u201d\n\n\n\n        On November 27, 1995, the Defendant filed a petition requesting that the\n\nbalance of his sentences be suspended. The petition alleged that the Defendant\n\n1\n As part of the agreem ent, the Defendant\u2019s petition to enter his guilty pleas stated, \u201call other\npresently pending charges against Defendant are to be dismissed.\u201d We cannot determine from\nthe re cord how ma ny oth er ch arge s we re pe nding , altho ugh we do note that th e De fend ant\u2019s\npetition to suspend the balance of his sentence stated that the Defendant admitted that he\ncommitted \u201ca number of burglaries\u201d in 1994.\n\n                                                    -2-\n\fhad successfully completed the \u201cLife Line Drug Treatment program,\u201d and further\n\nalleged that the Defendant\u2019s plea agreement \u201ccontemplated\u201d that the Defendant\n\ncould petition for a suspension of the balan ce of h is effective six-year sentence\n\nupon successful completion of the program. The trial court promptly denied the\n\npetition without a hearing. The Defendant filed a petition to reconsider the denial\n\nand attached a co py of a letter defense counsel had written to the assistant\n\ndistrict attorne y short ly after th e plea s were        entere d con firming    their\n\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d that if the Defendant successfully completed the Life Line Drug\n\nTreatment program the State would \u201cbe willing to recommend probation at the\n\nhearing on his petition for a suspension of the balance of his effective six-year\n\nsenten ce.\u201d The trial court promptly denied the petition to re conside r without a\n\nhearing. It is from the orders of the tria l court denying the Defendant\u2019s petition\n\nto suspend the balance of his sentences that the Defendant appeals.\n\n\n\n      On appeal, the Defendant argues that the trial court \u201cexceeded its\n\nauthority\u201d in denying the petition for a suspended sentence without conductin g\n\na hearing. In the even t the trial court w as not re quired b y law to con duct a\n\nhearing on the petition , the D efend ant arg ues th at the tria l judge abus ed his\n\ndiscretion in denying the petition without a hearing.\n\n\n\n      This matter was submitted to this court for a decision on November 13,\n\n1996. During the pendency of the appeal, the Defendant was released on parole,\n\nfailed to report to his parole officer and, effective August 7, 1996, had been\n\nclassified as \u201cabscon ded from p arole.\u201d This Cou rt subs eque ntly ord ered th at this\n\nappeal would be dismissed for mootness unless the Defendant could show cause\n\nwhy it should not be.\n\n                                          -3-\n\f       Counsel for the Defendant subsequently filed an affidavit stating that the\n\nDefendant\u2019s parole was revoked in December, 1996 and the Defendant was\n\ncurren tly serving his sentence in the Department of Corre ction. In his affidavit,\n\nhis defense counsel asserted that, even though the issu es raised on a ppeal were\n\nmoot insofar as the Defendant is concerned, there was a routin e prac tice in the\n\nDavidson County Criminal Court, Division I, of denying petitions for suspended\n\nsentences without a hearin g and th at these c ases g enerally e vaded a ppellate\n\nreview. Counsel asserted that guidance was needed on the issue of whether a\n\npetitioner was entitled to a hearing on a petition for a suspended sentence.\n\n\n\n       The doctrine of justiciability prompts courts to stay their hand in cases that\n\ndo not involve a genuine and existing controversy requiring the present\n\nadjudication of prese nt rights. McIntyre v. Traughber, 884 S.W.2d 134, 137\n\n(Tenn . Ct. App. 1994). The concept of mootness deals with the circumstances\n\nthat render a case no longe r justiciable. Id. A moo t case is on e that has lost its\n\ncharacter as a present, live controversy. A case will generally be considered\n\nmoot if it no longer serves as a mean s to provide relief to the preva iling party. Id.\n\nThe two most recognized exceptions to the mootness rule include issues of great\n\npublic interest and importance to the administration of justice and issues capa ble\n\nof repetition ye t evading review. Id. Whether to take up cases th at fit into one of\n\nthe recognized exceptions to the mootness doctrine is discretionary with the\n\nappellate courts. Id.\n\n\n\n       In the case sub judice, it is obvious that we cannot provide any meaningful\n\nrelief to the D efend ant eve n if we determine that the trial judge erred or abused\n\nhis discretion in denyin g the D efend ant\u2019s p etition to susp end th e bala nce o f his\n\n                                          -4-\n\f      sentence. To order the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the\n\n      Defe ndan t\u2019s petition for a su spen ded s enten ce, in vie w of the Defe ndan t\u2019s\n\n      subsequent conduct and current status, would border on the ridiculous.\n\n\n\n               Counsel for the Defendant argues that this Court should decide the issue\n\n      presented as an exception to the mootness rule because the issues are ca pable\n\n      of repetition ye t evade a ppellate re view. We do not believe that our sentencing\n\n      laws mandate that a trial judge condu ct an evidentiary he aring each a nd every\n\n      time a defendant files a petition requesting the court to suspend the balance of\n\n      a senten ce. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 40-35-212(c); 40-35-31 4(c). We have\n\n      located no Tennessee case involving the precise issue of whether a petition for\n\n      modification of sentence pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-\n\n      314(c) may be denied without conducting an evidentiary hearing.2 The sta tute\n\n      itself provides only that the trial judge maintains jurisdiction over those\n\n      defend ants sentenced to the local jail or workhouse, giving him or her the\n\n      authority to modify such sentences, and that applications to reduce or alter the\n\n      manner of service of a sente nce ma y be made at no less than two (2) mon th\n\n      intervals. Contrary to the Defendant\u2019s position, we do not believe the language\n\n      of the statute implies tha t a hearing mu st be conducted for every application.\n\n      Certa inly the trial court may conduct an evid entiary hearin g in appropriate cases,\n\n      but to require a hearing on each and every application could place an\n\n      unreasonable burden on the trial court. Some discretion is warranted.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n        W e not e tha t this is sue is dist inct fr om a m otion to red uce sent enc e pur sua nt to R ule 35 (b) of\nthe   Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Advisory Commission comments to Rule 35 make\n      it clear that it does not alter the statutory authority of trial courts to modify the sentences of\n      individuals sentenced to local jails or workhouses, but rather affects individuals sentenced to the\n      Department of Correction.\n\n                                                              -5-\n\f      From the record before us, we cannot conclude that the trial judge erred\n\nor abused his discretion in denying the petition for a suspension of the remainder\n\nof the sente nce witho ut an evid entiary he aring. We are provided with no facts of\n\nthe underlyin g offense s. We have no knowledge of how many charges against\n\nthe Defendant were dismissed as part of the plea agreement. We know nothing\n\nof the Defendant\u2019s background, his potential or lack of potential for rehabilitation,\n\nor his institutional record.   The order entered by the trial judge denying the\n\npetition for a susp ended senten ce states that the cou rt considered the \u201centire\n\nrecord.\u201d The \u201centire record\u201d before us reflects little more than that the Defendant\n\nentered into a plea agreement which provided for a six -year sentence and that\n\nhe completed a drug treatment program while incarcerated.\n\n\n\n       Because the issu es pre sente d in this appe al are m oot, this appe al is\n\ndismiss ed.\n\n\n\n                                 ____________________________________\n                                 DAVID H.
