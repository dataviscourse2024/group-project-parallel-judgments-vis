In November  1992, Lancer Scott\r                         ______________\r\r            Gondek was convicted  in Maine Superior Court of  robbery and\r\r            burglary and sentenced  to   prison.  While  on parole  after\r\r            imprisonment,   Gondek  was   arrested  in  March   1994  for\r\r            possession of a firearm.  The federal government indicted him\r\r            under  the  felon  in  possession  statute.    18  U.S.C.    \r\r            922(g)(1),  924(a)(2).   In  consequence of  his arrest,  his\r\r            failure to attend a drug  treatment program, and his  alcohol\r\r            use, the state court  revoked Gondek's parole and imposed  on\r\r            him a three-year prison sentence.  Gondek then pled guilty in\r\r            federal court to a single count of firearms possession.  \r\r                 In January  1995, the district court  imposed a 77-month\r\r            sentence  on   Gondek  and  concluded  that   the  Sentencing\r\r            Guidelines required the federal sentence to run consecutively\r\r            to  the state  sentence imposed  after the  parole violation.\r\r            Gondek has now  appealed the federal sentence, arguing that a\r\r            consecutive sentence  was not  mandatory and should  not have\r\r            been  ordered.   His only  substantial argument  involves the\r\r            interpretation of U.S.S.G.   5G1.3, a  set of provisions that\r\r            are less than a model of clarity.\r\r                 Section  5G1.3 governs  the imposition  of sentences  on\r\r            defendants who are convicted  of a crime while subject  to an\r\r            undischarged term of imprisonment for a  previous conviction.\r\r            Under subsection (a), the new sentence must be consecutive if\r                                                           ___________\r\r            a defendant is convicted for a crime committed while \"serving\r\r\r\r                                         -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r            a term of imprisonment  (including work release, furlough, or\r\r            escape   status),  or  after   sentencing  for,   but  before\r\r            commencing   service   of,   such  term   of   imprisonment.\"\r\r            Subsection (b)  provides for a concurrent  sentence where the\r                                           __________\r\r            undischarged  term  resulted  from offenses  \"that  have been\r\r            fully  taken  into  account\"  (e.g.,  as  an  adjustment)  in\r                                           ____\r\r            determining  the  offense  level  for  the  present  offense.\r\r            Finally, under  subsection  (c) in  all other  cases the  new\r\r            sentence  is to  be consecutive  \"to the extent  necessary to\r\r            achieve a  reasonable incremental punishment  for the instant\r\r            offense.\"  \r\r                 The commentary  for subsection (c) gives  the court some\r\r            latitude  in determining  what is  a \"reasonable  incremental\r\r            punishment,\"  although  it  offers  one  generalization  that\r\r            covers a good  many cases:   application note 3 says  that to\r\r            the extent  practicable, the  court should achieve  the total\r\r            punishment that  would  have been  imposed  \"had all  of  the\r\r            offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being\r\r            imposed at the  same time.\"   The  commentary concludes  with\r\r            application note 4, added in 1993, which reads as follows:\r\r                 If the defendant was on federal or state probation,\r                 parole, or  supervised release  at the time  of the\r                 instant   offense,  and  has  had  such  probation,\r                 parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence\r                 for  the instant  offense should  be imposed  to be\r                 served consecutively  to the  term imposed  for the\r                 violation  of  probation,  parole,   or  supervised\r                 release in order to  provide an incremental penalty\r                 for   the  violation   of  probation,   parole,  or\r\r\r\r                                         -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r                 supervised  release  (in  accord  with  the  policy\r                 expressed in   7B1.3 and 7B1.4).\r\r                 The language  of application note 4  applies directly to\r\r            this  case.  Gondek  was on state  parole at the  time of the\r\r            present firearms possession  offense, and the district  court\r\r            followed the directive that the sentence  for the new offense\r\r            \"should be  imposed to  be served consecutively  to the  term\r\r            imposed for the violation of . . . parole . . . .\"   The only\r\r            question  is whether  the district  court erred  in believing\r\r            that  this result  was  mandated by  the  guidelines; if  the\r\r            commentary were  only a  suggestion, then the  district court\r\r            would  be obliged to decide whether as a matter of discretion\r\r            it wished to make the term consecutive or concurrent.\r\r                 There is an argument  for reading application note 4  to\r\r            reserve discretion to  the district court.   The note,  after\r\r            all,  is  appended to  a  subsection  that  does confer  some\r\r            discretion and  is explicitly  labeled a  \"policy statement,\"\r\r            although  commentary policy  is  also binding.   Williams  v.\r                                                             ________\r\r            United  States, 503 U.S. 193, 200-01 (1992).  Some might also\r            ______________\r\r            attach  weight to the note's use of the word \"should,\" rather\r\r            than  \"shall,\" see United States v. Whiteley, 54 F.3d 85, 89,\r                           ___ _____________    ________\r\r            91 (2d Cir. 1995), but  these shadings in guideline  language\r\r            do not appear to be very reliable guides.\r\r                 However,  the greater  weight of  the evidence  suggests\r\r            that, departure to one side, application note 4 is mandatory.\r\r            First, the simple and straightforward language of application\r\r\r                                         -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r            note 4 says that if the defendant committed the offense while\r\r            on parole,  the  sentence should  be  made consecutive.    No\r\r            qualification  is  stated  or  suggested.   In  other  words,\r\r            application  note 4 represents the Commission's determination\r\r            as to  what is a  \"reasonable incremental punishment\"  in the\r\r            narrow situation described in the note.  \r\r                 Second,  the rationale  for  this  special treatment  is\r\r            entirely  understandable.    Unlike  many cases  governed  by\r\r            subsection  (c), where  the two  offenses arise  from related\r\r            events,  the  parole  case  covered  by  application  note  4\r\r            involves  a new  offense normally  unrelated to  the original\r\r            offense  that led to the  parole.  Instead,  the situation is\r\r            closely akin to the case  of the defendant who commits  a new\r\r            offense while  still in prison,  the very situation  in which\r\r            subsection  (a) instructs  that  the new  sentence  is to  be\r\r            served consecutively.\r\r                 Third,  the guidelines  elsewhere  provide that  where a\r\r            federal  court  imposes  a  term of  imprisonment  \"upon  the\r\r            revocation of probation or  supervised release,\" it is  to be\r\r            served  consecutively to  any sentence  of imprisonment  then\r\r            being served.  U.S.S.G.   7B1.3(f).  This section does not in\r\r            terms  apply to Gondek's case because his revocation was by a\r\r            state  court and was prior  to the federal  sentence; but the\r\r            policy  of   this  provision,  which   is  explicitly  cross-\r\r            referenced  in  application  note  4,  makes  irrelevant  the\r\r\r\r                                         -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r            sequence  of events.    Reading the  two provisions  together\r\r            reenforces our view that application note 4 is mandatory.\r\r                 Fourth, one  circuit has agreed that  application note 4\r\r            is mandatory, United States v. Bernard, 48 F.3d 427, 432 (9th\r                          _____________    _______\r\r            Cir. 1995); two others reached the same result, for sentences\r\r            imposed  prior to  application  note 4,  based  in part  upon\r\r            U.S.S.G.   7B1.3(f), United States v. Glasener, 981 F.2d 973,\r                                 _____________    ________\r\r            975 (8th Cir. 1992);  United States v. Flowers, 13  F.3d 395,\r                                  _____________    _______\r\r            397  (11th Cir.  1994); and  apparently no other  circuit has\r\r            agreed with Gondek's view.   Although we are obliged  to make\r\r            our own judgment, our  confidence in it is reenforced  by the\r\r            reaction of other circuits.\r\r                 There  are  three  loose   ends  that  deserve  separate\r\r            treatment.    On a  technical level,  one  might ask  why the\r\r            Commission, in  adding application note  4 in  1993, did  not\r\r            simplify the  matter by expanding the  language of subsection\r\r            (a) to embrace parole.  It is probably enough to observe that\r\r            subsection  (a) is  addressed primarily  to cases in  which a\r\r            defendant commits the  new offense while  \"serving a term  of\r\r            imprisonment\"; and  it would have required  some reworking of\r\r            subsection  (a) as a whole--not merely the insertion of a few\r\r            words--to  allow  it   to  include   parole,  probation   and\r\r            supervised release.\r\r                 The broader  question is whether  there is  a clash,  in\r\r            spirit if  not in  language, between the  apparently generous\r\r\r\r                                         -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r            grant  of  discretion  conveyed  by subsection  (c)  and  the\r\r            specific,  restrictive  directive  of  application   note  4.\r\r            Subsection (c)  had to  be generally  phrased because  it was\r\r            designed as a  catch-all for all  situations not embraced  by\r\r            subsections (a)  and (b), including ones  that the Commission\r\r            might not be  able to envision in advance.   It does not seem\r\r            to us inconsistent  for the Commission  to identify one  such\r\r            situation  and treat  it expressly  in commentary,  a pattern\r\r            common throughout the guidelines.\r\r                 Indeed,  in subsection  (c)  itself application  note  3\r\r            reflects the same technique  and suggests that it is  easy to\r\r            overstate the  amount of  discretion conferred by  subsection\r\r            (c)  as  a  whole.   As  already  noted,  application note  3\r\r            contains  a formula  that governs  a good  many of  the cases\r\r            likely to  arise under subsection  (c).  That  formula, which\r\r            calls  on the court to  compute the overall  punishment as if\r\r            both sentences were imposed  by a federal court in  one case,\r\r            involves  a  regime that  is  virtually  mathematical in  its\r\r            application.

Newman, 982 F.2d\r                                        _____________    ______\r\r            665, 673 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 59 (1993),\r                                      ____________\r\r            as we think is the case here.\r\r                 In an  entirely independent argument, Gondek  says that,\r\r            if the guidelines make a consecutive sentence mandatory, then\r\r            they  violate   18  U.S.C.      3584(a),  a   provision  that\r\r            contemplates  a   choice  by  the   district  court   between\r\r            consecutive and  concurrent sentences.    We have  previously\r\r            held  that the  court's discretion  under section  3584(a) is\r\r            constrained where the Commission  has promulgated a governing\r\r            guideline.   United States v.  Flowers, 995 F.2d  315, 316-17\r                         _____________     _______\r\r            (1st  Cir.  1993).    Indeed,  the  statute  authorizing  the\r\r            guidelines specifically provides for them to include rules to\r\r            be used  in determining \"whether multiple  sentences to terms\r\r            of  imprisonment should  be  ordered to  run concurrently  or\r\r            consecutively . . . .\"  28 U.S.C.   994(a)(1)(D).\r\r                 Gondek's  final argument  is a  claim that  the district\r\r            court  should  have  applied   subsection  (b),  rather  than\r\r            subsection  (c), of U.S.S.G.   5G1.3.  The former, as already\r\r            noted, provides for concurrent sentences subsection where (a)\r\r            does  not apply  and  the undischarged  term of  imprisonment\r\r            \"resulted  from offense(s)  that have  been fully  taken into\r\r\r\r                                         -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r            account\"  in determining  the offense  level for  the instant\r\r            offense.   U.S.S.G.    5G1.3(b).    Gondek argues  that  this\r\r            quoted   language  governs,   primarily  because   the  prior\r\r            convictions were what made  him a felon subject to  the felon\r\r            in possession statute.\r\r                 The critical phase--\"fully  taken into  account\"--refers\r\r            to a case in which the prior criminal conduct is also offense\r                                                                  _______\r\r            conduct  in  the present  case;  examples,  indicated by  the\r\r            commentary, would  be state and federal  prosecutions for the\r\r            same conduct or a federal prosecution  that treated the state\r\r            offense  as  relevant  conduct  in  determining  the  federal\r\r            offense  level.  U.S.S.G.   5G1.3, comment. (n.2).  The prior\r\r            felony conviction  that makes it unlawful to  carry a firearm\r\r            is not \"taken  into account\"  in this manner  in the  federal\r\r            sentencing,  and the  rationale  of subsection  (b) does  not\r\r            apply.
