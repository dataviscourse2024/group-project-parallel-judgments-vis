Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986). We have\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.\n\n      *\n        This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent\nexcept as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.\n      **\n        The Honorable Jeremy Fogel, United States District Judge for the\nNorthern District of California, sitting by designation.\n\f      During voir dire in Crespin\u2019s retrial, the prosecutor used a peremptory\n\nchallenge to strike prospective juror Obregon, a Hispanic female. Crespin\u2019s\n\ncounsel objected under People v. Wheeler, 22 Cal. 3d 258, 148 Cal. Rptr. 890, 583\n\nP.2d 748 (1978)1, contending that the prosecutor had excused Obregon because of\n\nher race. The prosecutor stated that she had excused Obregon because Obregon\n\nhad indicated on her juror questionnaire that her nephew had been arrested for or\n\ncharged with armed robbery.\n\n      The trial court denied Crespin\u2019s Wheeler motion. The trial court\u2019s\n\ndetermination as to whether the prosecutor's explanation for dismissing a member\n\nof the venire is credible must be accorded substantial deference. Rice v. Collins,\n\n546 U.S. 333, 338-39, 126 S. Ct. 969, 163 L. Ed. 2d 824 (2006). As long as the\n\nprosecutor presents a \"comprehensible reason\" and her motive is not inherently\n\ndiscriminatory, her explanation need not be \"persuasive, or even plausible\" to\n\nsuffice. Id. at 338, 126 S. Ct. 969. The state appellate court based its decision on\n\nthe trial court's factual finding that the prosecutor was motivated by her belief that\n\nObregon would be sympathetic to Crespin because she had a nephew who likely\n\nwas approximately the same age as Crespin who had been arrested for or charged\n\nwith armed robbery. That decision was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable\n\n\n\n      1\n          Wheeler is the California state law equivalent of Batson.\n\n                                           2\n\fapplication of federal law.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                              3\n\f",
