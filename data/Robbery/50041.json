C-20-0630-CR, C-20-0631-CR, & C-20-0729-CR\n\n\n                    MEMORANDUM OPINION\n      Patrick Shawn Elizondo, Appellant, appeals his convictions for five counts of\naggravated robbery by threat. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 29.03(a)(2) (West\n2019). The jury found Appellant guilty as charged and assessed punishment for each\ncount at imprisonment for fifteen years in the Institutional Division of the Texas\nDepartment of Criminal Justice, and the trial court sentenced Appellant\n\faccordingly\u2014with each sentence running concurrently.           On appeal, Appellant\npresents three issues: (1) that the exclusion of relevant conduct elements from the\ndefinitions in the abstract portion of the trial court\u2019s charge was egregious error;\n(2) that the inclusion of the definition of \u201crecklessly\u201d in the abstract portion of the\ncharge was egregious error; and (3) that the trial court abused its discretion in\ndenying a motion for mistrial. We affirm.\n                          Factual and Procedural History\n      The charges arose out of a series of robberies that took place from March 23,\n2020, to March 27, 2020, when Appellant and his accomplice, Joe Ortiz, robbed\nthree stores. After robbing the third store, Appellant stole a vehicle from one of the\nstore employees and used it to flee the scene. Officer Alejandro Munoz from the\nOdessa Police Department responded to the third robbery and issued an \u201cattempt to\nlocate\u201d on the stolen vehicle. Later that night, after Appellant had dropped off Ortiz,\nanother officer identified a vehicle that matched the \u201cattempt to locate\u201d and activated\nhis emergency lights. Appellant fled, reaching speeds of over 110 miles per hour,\nbut eventually drove into a field and crashed. A subject was seen fleeing from the\nvehicle, so officers formed a perimeter and began to search the surrounding area.\nPolice eventually found Appellant hiding within the search area.\n      Appellant was brought in and questioned by Detective Donaciano Rocha of\nthe Odessa Police Department. Appellant provided Detective Rocha with an alibi,\nand Detective Rocha decided not to arrest Appellant at that time. Detective Rocha\nsubsequently discovered that Appellant\u2019s alibi was inconsistent with the stories from\nother witnesses that he interviewed, and Detective Rocha \u201cpicked up\u201d Appellant\nagain. This time, Appellant refused to answer questions and asked for a lawyer.\nAppellant was arrested and ultimately charged with five counts of aggravated\nrobbery by threat.\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f      I. Trial Court Charge Errors\n      Appellant\u2019s first two issues complain of charge error. In Appellant\u2019s first\nissue he contends, and the State concedes, that in the definitions of \u201cintentionally\u201d\nand \u201cknowingly\u201d as given in the charge, the trial court failed to include all of the\nrelevant conduct elements for aggravated robbery. In his second issue, Appellant\nclaims that providing a definition for \u201crecklessly\u201d in the charge was error because\n\u201crecklessly\u201d is not a culpable mental state for aggravated robbery by threat.\nAppellant argues that these errors, separately and combined, egregiously harmed\nAppellant.\n      A review of alleged jury charge error involves two steps. Ngo v. State, 175\nS.W.3d 738, 743\u201344 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005); Abdnor v. State, 871 S.W.2d 726,\n731\u201332 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994). First, we determine if there is any error; second, if\nthere is error, we must determine if the error resulted in sufficient harm to require\nreversal. Ngo, 175 S.W.3d at 743\u201344; Abdnor, 871 S.W.2d at 731\u201332.\n      Not all charge errors require reversal on appeal. Reeves v. State, 420 S.W.3d\n812, 816 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). If the charge is erroneous, then on appeal we must\nfirst determine if the defendant objected to the erroneous charge. Id. If the defendant\nobjected to the erroneous charge, we will reverse if the record shows that the error\ncaused \u201csome harm.\u201d Id. Conversely, if the defendant failed to object, an appellate\ncourt may only reverse upon a finding of \u201cegregious harm.\u201d Id. Egregious harm is\nharm that denies the defendant a fair and impartial trial. Nava v. State, 415 S.W.3d\n289, 298 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). This is a difficult standard to meet, and the harm\nmust be shown in the record. Reeves, 420 S.W.3d at 816. To assess harm, the\nappellate court reviews the Almanza factors: (1) the jury charge itself; (2) the state\nof the evidence, including weight and probative value; (3) counsel\u2019s arguments; and\n(4) any other relevant information in the trial record. Vega v. State, 394 S.W.3d 514,\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f521 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013); Almanza v. State, 686 S.W.2d 157, 171 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 1985).\n      The relevant portion of the charge defining the culpable mental states is:\n\n             You are instructed that a person acts \u201cintentionally\u201d, or with\n      intent, with respect to a result of his conduct when it is his conscious\n      objective or desire to cause the result.\n\n             You are instructed that a person acts \u201cknowingly\u201d, or with\n      knowledge, with respect to the result of his conduct when he is aware\n      that his conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.\n\n             A person acts \u201crecklessly,\u201d or is reckless, with respect to the\n      result of his conduct when he is aware of but consciously disregards a\n      substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur. The risk\n      must be of such a nature and degree that its disregard constitutes a gross\n      deviation from the standard of care that an ordinary person would\n      exercise . . . .\n\n      There are three conduct elements that may be involved in an offense: the\nnature of the conduct, the result of the conduct, and the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct. Young v. State, 341 S.W.3d 417, 423 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). An\noffense may contain any one or more of these conduct elements that alone or in\ncombination form the overall behavior that the legislature has intended to\ncriminalize, and it is these essential conduct elements to which a culpable mental\nstate must apply. McQueen v. State, 781 S.W.2d 600, 603 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989).\nAn offense involving multiple conduct elements requires a charge that includes all\nrelevant conduct elements in the definitions of the culpable mental states. See\nHughes v. State, 897 S.W.2d 285, 295\u201396 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994).\n      Aggravated robbery by threat is an offense that implicates all three \u201cconduct\nelements.\u201d Gutierrez v. State, 446 S.W.3d 36, 40\u201341 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2014, pet.\nref\u2019d). In the charge of the present case, only the \u201cresult of the conduct\u201d element\nwas included in the definitions.       The other two, \u201cnature of conduct\u201d and\n\n                                          4\n\f\u201ccircumstances of the conduct,\u201d were erroneously omitted from the definitions. See\nServin v. State, 582 S.W.3d 629, 632 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 2019, no pet.); see\nalso Garfias v. State, 424 S.W.3d 54, 60 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014); Gutierrez, 446\nS.W.3d at 39\u201341.\n      Further, inclusion of a culpable mental state that is not pertinent to the charged\nconduct is error. See Patrick v. State, 906 S.W.2d 481, 491\u201392 (Tex. Crim. App.\n1995). As set out above, the abstract portion of the charge in this case contained a\ndefinition of \u201crecklessly,\u201d which is not an applicable culpable mental state for the\noffense of aggravated robbery by threat. A person commits aggravated robbery by\nthreat (as charged in this case) if, (1) while in the course of committing theft, (2) he\nintentionally or knowingly threatens or places another in fear of imminent bodily\ninjury or death, and (3) he uses or exhibits a deadly weapon.              See PENAL\n\u00a7\u00a7 29.02(a)(2), 29.03(a)(2). Robbery or aggravated robbery by threat cannot be\ncommitted \u201crecklessly.\u201d Compare PENAL \u00a7 29.02(a)(1) (robbery by injury, which\nincludes \u201crecklessly\u201d), with PENAL \u00a7 29.02(a)(2) (robbery by threat, which does not\ninclude \u201crecklessly\u201d). Thus, the definition of \u201crecklessly\u201d was not applicable to the\noffenses as indicted in this case and should not have been included in the charge.\nThe charge omissions and addition of which Appellant complains are indeed error.\n      Because Appellant did not object to these errors at trial, we must next\ndetermine if they caused egregious harm such that Appellant was deprived of a fair\nand impartial trial. See Almanza, 686 S.W.2d at 171. To do so, we must examine\nall of the Almanza factors: (1) the jury charge itself; (2) the state of the evidence,\nincluding weight and probative value; (3) counsel\u2019s arguments; and (4) any other\nrelevant information in the trial record.\n\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\f        First, it is significant that the application paragraphs of the charge properly\ntracked the language for aggravated robbery by threat. 1 The Court of Criminal\nAppeals has held that where the abstract portion of a charge indiscriminately set\nforth incorrect conduct elements, but the application paragraph correctly stated the\noffense and pointed the jury to the appropriate definitions, no harm resulted.\nHughes, 897 S.W.2d at 296\u201397; see also Patrick v. State, 906 S.W.2d 481, 493 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 1995) (\u201cWe conclude that because the facts, as applied to the law in the\napplication paragraph, pointed the jury to the appropriate portion of the definitions,\nno harm resulted from the court\u2019s failure to limit the definitions of culpable mental\nstates\u201d). Here, the abstract portion of the charge incorrectly omitted conduct\nelements and added an unnecessary culpable mental state. However, the application\nportion of the charge precisely tracked the indictment, as well as the language for\naggravated robbery by threat found in the Penal Code. This factor weighs against a\nfinding of egregious harm.\n        Second, the content and probative value of the evidence weighs against a\nfinding of harm. The focus of the evidence at trial was not on Appellant\u2019s mental\nstate, but rather on his identity, i.e., whether he was there in the first place. At trial,\nAppellant testified that he was not the person at the scene of the crimes. The\nevidence offered at trial that tied Appellant to the crime scenes was primarily\ncircumstantial. There was no testimony that reflected a dispute about whether\nAppellant intended to cause the result of his conduct, engage in the nature of his\n\n\n        1\n         The trial court charged the jury as follows:\n                \u201cNow if you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that . . . [Appellant],\n        did then and there, while in the course of committing theft of property and with intent to\n        obtain or maintain control of the property, intentionally or knowingly threaten or place\n        Megan Young in fear of imminent bodily injury or death, and the Defendant did then and\n        there use or exhibit a deadly weapon . . . .\u201d\nEach of the five counts used identical language, but with a different victim\u2019s name each time and differing\ndeadly weapons\u2014including a handgun, a firearm, and a knife.\n\n                                                        6\n\fconduct, or the circumstances surrounding his conduct. Likewise, the State offered\nno evidence that Appellant was merely reckless. The only testimony regarding\nintent was from Ortiz\u2014that he and Appellant intended to place their victims in fear.\n      Third, counsel\u2019s arguments, similar to the evidence, weighs against a finding\nof harm. Appellant\u2019s defensive theory did not hinge on distinctions within the\nconduct elements. At trial, Appellant testified that he was not the person at the scene\nof the crimes. The State\u2019s arguments focused on tying Appellant to the scene of the\ncrimes. The State never argued improper conduct elements, nor did it argue that\nAppellant merely recklessly placed the victims in fear of bodily injury.\n      Fourth, the remainder of the record does not show harm. During voir dire, the\nState correctly differentiates between aggravated robbery by causing bodily injury\nand aggravated robbery by threat, omitting the culpable mental state of \u201crecklessly\u201d\nfor the latter. The record is otherwise bereft of any mention of conduct elements or\nwhether Appellant\u2019s mental state was reckless, as opposed to intentional or knowing.\n      Accordingly, the record does not reflect that the charge errors in this case\nvitally affected Appellant\u2019s defense or deprived him of a fair and impartial trial. See\nWright v. State, No. 02-15-00399-CR, 2016 WL 6520189 at *4 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort\nWorth Nov. 3, 2016, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication). We\noverrule Appellant\u2019s first and second issues.\n      II. Comment on Appellant\u2019s Post-Arrest Silence\n      In Appellant\u2019s third issue, he claims that the trial court abused its discretion\nin denying his motion for a mistrial after a State witness made an improper comment\non Appellant\u2019s post-arrest silence. We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for\nmistrial under an abuse of discretion standard. Hawkins v. State, 135 S.W.3d 72,\n76\u201377 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). Only highly prejudicial and incurable errors will\nnecessitate a mistrial. Simpson v. State, 119 S.W.3d 262, 272 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2003). Where evidence has been improperly admitted, such error is presumably\n\n                                          7\n\fcorrected by a withdrawal and an instruction to disregard. Waldo v. State, 746\nS.W.2d 750, 752 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988). The curative effect of an instruction to\nthe jury will suffice \u201cexcept in extreme cases where it appears that the evidence is\nclearly calculated to inflame the minds of the jury and is of such character as to\nsuggest the impossibility of withdrawing the impression produced on their minds.\u201d\nId. (quoting Harris v. State, 375 S.W.2d 310 (Tex. Crim. App. 1964)). To determine\nwhether an instruction is effective, we look to the record, focusing our attention on:\n(1) the nature of the error; (2) the persistence of the prosecution in committing it; (3)\nthe flagrancy of the violation; (4) the particular instruction given; and (5) the weight\nof the incriminating evidence. See id. at 754; see also Hardin v. State, 20 S.W.3d\n84, 93\u201394 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2000, pet. ref\u2019d).\n      One of the basic constitutional protections in a criminal trial is that a defendant\nwho remains silent after his arrest cannot have that silence used against him.\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 468 n.37 (1966); Hardie v. State, 807 S.W.2d\n319, 322 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991). Despite this, Detective Rocha, a witness for the\nState, testified to the following.\n            [STATE]: Were there any other agencies that cooperated with\n      you in this investigation?\n             [DETECTIVE ROCHA]: Yes, ma\u2019am. At the very end, once\n      we had enough probable cause to arrest both [Ortiz] and [Appellant],\n      it was brought up that they did more than what we had uncovered.\n      There was one aggravated robbery that they did at a liquor store,\n      which we could not identify in our agency. Where [Appellant] lives\n      is in the county, so we notified county when we went to go pick up\n      [Appellant]. When we picked up [Appellant], I gave him a second\n      time to tell me the truth about what happened, and he refused. He\n      lawyered up right then and there, which is typical for someone who\u2019s\n      basically been caught. So --\n      At this point, Appellant objected to the comment and moved for a mistrial.\nThe trial court denied the motion but gave an instruction to disregard. After the\n\n                                           8\n\fwitness was excused, the trial court gave a second, lengthier instruction regarding\nFifth Amendment privileges. As discussed below, we conclude that the witness\u2019s\nerror was curable and that these two instructions were effective in withdrawing\nimproper impressions from the minds of the jury.\n       We start our review with the comment itself. If it is improper for a witness to\ntestify about the defendant\u2019s silence when questioned by police, then it is even more\nimproper for a witness to testify not only about the defendant\u2019s silence but also his\nrequest for legal representation. See Waldo, 746 S.W.2d at 752.2 Thus, Detective\nRocha\u2019s comment itself weighs in favor of finding egregious harm.\n       However, Detective Rocha\u2019s improper comment was a nonresponsive answer\nto an otherwise permissible question. Courts have said that when an improper\ncomment was not solicited by the State, and the State did not capitalize on the\ncomment, the trial court\u2019s instruction is still presumed effective. Waldo, 746 S.W.2d\nat 755; Fletcher v. State, 852 S.W.2d 271, 275 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 1993, pet. ref\u2019d).\nHere, the prosecution did not solicit this evidence. The State did not attempt to\nrevisit Detective Rocha\u2019s improper comment through additional testimony or\nquestions.     The State refrained from mentioning this comment or arguing an\nadmission of guilt from silence in its closing arguments. This weighs strongly\nagainst finding harm. See Fletcher, 852 S.W.2d at 275 (finding that \u201cany harm was\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        The following exchange in Waldo was held to be an improper comment on the defendant\u2019s silence:\n               Q. At which point what did you do?\n                A. By this time, Bonny had come out of the restroom, we sat her down on the bed\n       next to [the defendant], Detective Thomas removes the rights card, reads them their rights,\n       asks them if they have any statements to make, which there was no response.\n\n746 S.W. 2d at 752.\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\fmitigated\u201d where the State made no further mention of the defendant\u2019s silence and\ndid not pursue any further questioning).\n      The trial court gave not one, but two instructions to disregard. First, the trial\ncourt gave an instruction to disregard immediately following the comment, saying,\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, you are instructed to disregard the statement just\nmade by the witness and don\u2019t consider it for any reason or purpose whatsoever.\u201d\nSecond, upon request of Appellant, the trial court gave an additional Fifth\nAmendment instruction after the offending witness was excused.\n      THE COURT: All right. Have a seat. Ladies and gentlemen, you\n      are reminded that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case\n      to be a witness against himself. . . .\n      We note that, prior to this second instruction, Appellant chose to cross-\nexamine Detective Rocha regarding his improper comment. These questions were\npresumably intended to explain the impropriety of Detective Rocha\u2019s statement and\nimpeach his credibility by showing his tendency to assume guilt based on the\nexercise of basic constitutional rights. This testimony, solicited voluntarily by\nAppellant, effectively supplemented the trial court\u2019s instruction to disregard by\npointing out why the improper comment should be disregarded.               Therefore,\nAppellant\u2019s cross-examination of Detective Rocha weighs in favor of presuming the\ncourt\u2019s instructions were effective.\n      The weight of evidence presented at trial is helpful to our review. The jury\ndid not need to rely upon Appellant\u2019s silence to find guilt. The weight of the\nincriminating evidence presented was strong. The State called Joe Ortiz, who\ntestified that he robbed these three stores with the help of Appellant. The evidence\nat trial corroborated Ortiz\u2019s story. The second robber wore a distinct pair of $300\nshoes to these robberies\u2014the same type of shoes Appellant was wearing when he\nwas arrested. Video footage showed that the second robber exhibited a knife with a\n\n\n                                           10\n\fbrown handle and black blade\u2014the same kind of knife that Appellant owned and\nalways carried. Appellant admitted that the person who robbed these stores would\nhave to have been \u201csomebody else\u201d who had the same kind of knife and shoes.\nFurther, there were multiple inconsistencies in Appellant\u2019s testimony. Appellant\ntestified he was the passenger and not the driver of the stolen vehicle. However, the\npolice only saw one person flee the crashed vehicle and only caught one person after\nestablishing a perimeter around the crashed vehicle. Further, the crashed vehicle did\nnot show signs of a passenger; the passenger door was closed, while the driver\u2019s side\nwas open. The weight of the evidence minimizes the likelihood that Detective\nRocha\u2019s comment was a significantly motivating factor for the jury\u2019s verdict and\nsupports a finding that the trial court\u2019s instructions to disregard cured the error.\n       Viewing the record as a whole, the only factor weighing in favor of Appellant\nis the initial comment itself. The other factors reviewed evince a careful response\nby the State, defense counsel, and the trial court that cured the error and effectively\nstruck the improper testimony from juror consideration.
