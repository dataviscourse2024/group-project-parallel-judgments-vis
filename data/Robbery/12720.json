Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 3023, subd. (b)), validation of an inmate as a\ngang member or associate can result in the inmate\u201fs placement in a security\nhousing unit (SHU).\n        The current dispute arose when the CDCR validated petitioner Elvin\nCabrera as a gang associate\u2014i.e., \u201can inmate . . . who is involved periodically or\nregularly with members or associates of a gang.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 3378,\nsubd. (c)(4) (hereafter section 3378)). Under section 3378, validation of an inmate\nas an \u201cassociate\u201d requires at least three \u201cindependent source items of\ndocumentation indicative of association\u201d with persons who have been classified as\ngang members or associates. (Ibid.) At least one of the source items must be a\n\u201cdirect link\u201d to a current or former gang member or associate. (Ibid.)\n        The question presented for our review, which involves the meaning of this\nprison regulation, is very narrow. In essence, the CDCR contends that the Court\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\fof Appeal erred by independently interpreting the scope of the regulation\u201fs\nrequirement of a \u201cdirect link\u201d between the inmate and a gang member or associate\nwith respect to one category of source items\u2014a category called \u201cAssociation\u201d\n(\u00a7 3378, subd. (c)(8)(G))\u2014instead of deferring to the CDCR\u201fs interpretation of its\nown regulation.1 For the reasons that follow, we agree the Court of Appeal failed\nto accord due deference to the CDCR\u201fs interpretation of its own regulations, and\ntherefore reverse the judgment awarding habeas corpus relief and remand the\nmatter to the Court of Appeal for further proceedings.\n                                       BACKGROUND\n         In 2003, Cabrera was convicted of robbery, burglary, receiving stolen\nproperty, and possession of drug paraphernalia. He was sentenced to prison for 62\nyears to life. He is incarcerated at the California Correctional Institution at\nTehachapi.\n         On May 13, 2008, Cabrera was officially identified\u2014or \u201cvalidated,\u201d in the\nwords of the CDCR regulation (\u00a7 3378, subd. (c)(4))\u2014as an associate of the\nMexican Mafia prison gang. The validation was based on the discovery in his\nprison cell of several photocopied drawings containing symbols distinctive to the\ngang. Two of the drawings were signed by validated affiliates2 of the Mexican\nMafia.\n\n\n\n1       Section 3378 uses the term \u201cassociation\u201d in two different contexts: first in\nsubdivision (c)(4) to explain that \u201cidentification\u201d as an \u201cassociate\u201d requires at least\nthree independent source items of documentation \u201cindicative of association,\u201d and\nlater in subdivision (c)(8)(G) as the label (\u201cAssociation\u201d) for one category of\nsource items. In this opinion, we address the term\u201fs meaning only in the latter\ncontext.\n2       Like the parties, we use the term \u201caffiliate\u201d to refer collectively to gang\nmembers and associates.\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\f       Cabrera challenged his validation through the CDCR administrative appeal\nprocess, but his appeal was denied. Cabrera then filed a petition for writ of habeas\ncorpus in Kern County Superior Court. The superior court denied the petition,\nfinding that his validation as a gang associate was supported by three source items\nof gang validation with two direct links to gang affiliates.\n       Cabrera filed an original petition in the Court of Appeal, which issued an\norder to show cause and then granted relief in a published opinion. The Court of\nAppeal\u201fs decision to grant relief rested on a disagreement with the CDCR over the\ninterpretation of the CDCR\u201fs own regulation. In the view of the Court of Appeal,\nthe regulation providing that at least one source item indicative of association with\nvalidated gang affiliates be a \u201cdirect link\u201d to a current or former validated gang\naffiliate (\u00a7 3378, subd. (c)(4)) required in these circumstances a \u201creciprocal (i.e.,\nmutual or two-way) interaction between the two individuals forming the\nrelationship.\u201d Having found insufficient evidence of such a reciprocal\nrelationship, the Court of Appeal granted the writ and ordered the CDCR to\nexpunge Cabrera\u201fs validation as an associate of the Mexican Mafia gang and to\ncease housing Cabrera in the SHU to the extent the assignment had been based on\nthe gang validation. In light of its disposition, the Court of Appeal found it\nunnecessary to consider Cabrera\u201fs other challenges to the validation order.\n       We granted review to resolve a question of law concerning the deference\nowed to the CDCR in interpreting its own regulations governing the identification\nof inmates as prison-gang affiliates.\n                                        DISCUSSION\n       It is a \u201c \u201eblack letter\u201f proposition\u201d that there are two categories of\nadministrative rules\u2014quasi-legislative rules and interpretive rules\u2014and that the\ndistinction between them derives from their different legal foundations and\nultimately from the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers. (Yamaha\n\n                                           3\n\fCorp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization (1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 10 (Yamaha).)\nQuasi-legislative rules are those that the agency promulgates as part of the\nlawmaking power the Legislature has delegated to it, and are subject to \u201cvery\nlimited\u201d review. (Sara M. v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 998, 1012.) \u201c \u201eThe\ncourts exercise limited review of legislative acts by administrative bodies out of\ndeference to the separation of powers between the Legislature and the judiciary, to\nthe legislative delegation of administrative authority to the agency, and to the\npresumed expertise of the agency within its scope of authority.\u201f \u201d (San Francisco\nFire Fighters Local 798 v. City and County of San Francisco (2006) 38 Cal.4th\n653, 667.) Rules that interpret a statute, on the other hand, receive less judicial\ndeference. (Sara M., supra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 1012.)\n       The Legislature has \u201cprovided no specific guidance regarding how\nprisoners should be classified\u201d (In re Jenkins (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1167, 1173), but\nhas instead delegated lawmaking power to the CDCR to \u201cprescribe and amend\nrules and regulations for the administration of the prisons.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 5058;\nsee also id., \u00a7 5068.) \u201cBy enacting these statutes, \u201e[t]he Legislature has given the\n[secretary] broad authority for the discipline and classification of persons confined\nin state prisons. [Citations.] This authority includes the mandate to promulgate\nregulations governing administration, classification, and discipline.\u201f\u201d (In re\nJenkins, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 1173.)\n       Section 3378 (the regulation at issue here) is a quasi-legislative rule\npromulgated by the CDCR to identify and manage inmates with a prison-gang\naffiliation. Because the CDCR, like any agency granted this sort of substantive\nlawmaking power, is \u201ctruly \u201emaking law,\u201f [its] quasi-legislative rules have the\ndignity of statutes. When a court assesses the validity of such rules, the scope of\nits review is narrow. If satisfied that the rule in question lay within the lawmaking\nauthority delegated by the Legislature, and that it is reasonably necessary to\n\n                                          4\n\fimplement the purpose of the statute, judicial review is at an end.\u201d (Yamaha,\nsupra, 19 Cal.4th at pp. 10-11.) \u201cThe substitution of the judgment of a court for\nthat of the administrator in quasi-legislative matters would effectuate neither the\nlegislative mandate nor sound social policy.\u201d (Pitts v. Perluss (1962) 58 Cal.2d\n824, 835.)\n       No party disputes that section 3378 is within the scope of the authority\nconferred by the Legislature on the CDCR. Rather, the question here is how to\ninterpret one of the provisions in section 3378 governing validation of an associate\nof a prison gang. The Court of Appeal and the CDCR have differing views as to\nthe interpretation of this provision of section 3378. But resolution of their dispute\nmust acknowledge one simple observation: \u201cwe defer to an agency\u201fs\ninterpretation of its own regulations, particularly when the interpretation\nimplicates areas of the agency\u201fs expertise.\u201d (Environmental Protection\nInformation Center v. California Dept. of Forestry & Fire Protection (2008) 44\nCal.4th 459, 505.)\n       The text of section 3378, subdivision (c)(4) provides: \u201cAn associate is an\ninmate/parolee or any person who is involved periodically or regularly with\nmembers or associates of a gang. This identification requires at least three (3)\nindependent source items of documentation indicative of association with\nvalidated gang members or associates. Validation of an inmate/parolee or any\nperson as an associate of a prison gang shall require at least one (1) source item be\na direct link to a current or former validated member or associate of the gang, or to\nan inmate/parolee or any person who is validated by the department within six (6)\nmonths of the established or estimated date of activity identified in the evidence\nconsidered.\u201d Section 3378 lists 13 different categories of source items indicative\nof association with validated gang affiliates, including an inmate\u201fs admission of\ninvolvement with the gang, tattoos and symbols distinctive to the gang, written\n\n                                          5\n\fmaterial or communications evidencing gang activity, the inmate\u201fs association\nwith validated gang affiliates, and offenses reflecting gang affiliation. (\u00a7 3378,\nsubd. (c)(8).)\n       In this case, the source items underlying the CDCR\u201fs validation of Cabrera\nas a gang associate consisted of several photocopied drawings containing symbols\nassertedly distinctive to the Mexican Mafia. Two drawings depict armed women\n(one with a spear, one with a revolver) and contain a \u201cMatlactomei\u201d symbol (the\nMayan symbol for 13), which consists of two vertical lines and a vertical column\nof three dots. The number 13 refers to \u201cM,\u201d the 13th letter in the alphabet, and is\nused as a designation for the Mexican Mafia gang. (See People v. Gonzalez\n(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1544.) One of these drawings is signed by a\nvalidated associate of the Mexican Mafia. Another drawing depicts a female\nMesoamerican warrior armed with a sword and shield as well as a bow and quiver\nof arrows. An \u201ceternal war shield,\u201d which demonstrates loyalty to the Mexican\nMafia, is on her chest. A fourth drawing, which features Mesoamerican and\nimprisonment themes, is signed by a validated member of the Mexican Mafia.\nThe prison\u201fs institutional classification committee concluded that the drawings\ndepicting the gang symbols qualified as source items under the \u201cTattoos and\nsymbols\u201d category of the regulation (\u00a7 3378, subd. (c)(8)(B))3 and that the signed\ndrawings qualified as source items under the \u201cAssociation\u201d category (id., subd.\n\n\n3       \u201cTattoos and symbols. Body markings, hand signs, distinctive clothing,\ngraffiti, etc., which have been identified by gang investigators as being used by\nand distinctive to specific gangs. Staff shall describe the tattoo or symbol and\narticulate why it is believed that the tattoo or symbol is used by and distinctive of\ngang association or membership. Staff shall document and disclose this\ninformation to the inmate/parolee in a written form that would not jeopardize the\nsafety of any person or the security of the institution.\u201d (\u00a7 3378, subd. (c)(8)(B).)\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f(c)(8)(G)).4 The committee further found that Cabrera\u201fs possession of two\ndrawings signed by validated Mexican Mafia affiliates directly linked him to those\ngang affiliates.\n       The Court of Appeal accepted the CDCR\u201fs definition of \u201cdirect link\u201d\n(\u00a7 3378, subd. (c)(4)) as encompassing a connection that is \u201c \u201ewithout interruption\nor diversion\u201f and \u201ewithout any intervening agency or step.\u201f \u201d The Court of Appeal\nalso accepted the CDCR\u201fs definition of \u201cassociation with validated gang affiliates\u201d\n(\u00a7 3378, subd. (c)(8)) to mean \u201ca \u201eloose relationship as a partner, . . . colleague,\nfriend, companion, or ally\u201f with a validated gang affiliate.\u201d This connection could\nbe established, according to the Court of Appeal, by \u201cinformation related to the\ninmate\u201fs loose relationship with a gang affiliate.\u201d\n       But the Court of Appeal departed from the CDCR\u201fs construction of the\nregulation when the court purported to \u201ccombine the definitions and reach a\nconclusion as to what is meant by \u201edirect link\u201f when the source item used is the\ninmate\u201fs \u201eassociation with validated gang affiliates\u201f \u201d: \u201cThe relationship, whether\ncharacterized as one of partners, colleagues, friends, companions, or allies, must\ninvolve reciprocal (i.e., mutual or two-way) interaction between the two\nindividuals forming the relationship. In other words, the requisite relationship\ncannot be created solely by one party\u201fs action; there must be some assent or\nmutuality from the other party.\u201d The Court of Appeal then relied on the lack of\nevidence of \u201ca mutual relationship, even a loose one,\u201d to conclude that the CDCR\n\n\n4       \u201cAssociation. Information related to the inmate/parolee\u201fs association with\nvalidated gang affiliates. Information including addresses, names, identities and\nreasons why such information is indicative of association with a prison gang or\ndisruptive group. Staff shall document and disclose this information to the\ninmate/parolee in a written form that would not jeopardize the safety of any person\nor the security of the institution.\u201d (\u00a7 3378, subd. (c)(8)(G).)\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fhad failed to establish a direct link between Cabrera and any validated gang\naffiliate and, on that basis, granted relief.\n       In announcing its interpretation of the CDCR regulation, the Court of\nAppeal acknowledged that the CDCR had construed the regulation to have a\nbroader scope. In the CDCR\u201fs view, the regulation\u201fs requirement of a direct link\ndoes not require evidence of a reciprocal or two-way interaction between the\ninmate and the validated gang affiliate in these circumstances. Yet, in rejecting\nthe CDCR\u201fs interpretation, the Court of Appeal offered neither deference to the\nagency\u201fs view nor acknowledgement of the agency\u201fs expertise in prison\nmanagement. This was error.\n       \u201cAs a general matter, courts will be deferential to government agency\ninterpretations of their own regulations, particularly when the interpretation\ninvolves matters within the agency\u201fs expertise and does not plainly conflict with a\nstatutory mandate.\u201d (Environmental Protection Information Center v. California\nDept. of Forestry & Fire Protection, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 490.) The question of\nhow best to identify gang affiliates in the prison setting \u201cis a judgment call, and we\nwill not disturb the agency\u201fs determination without a demonstration that it is\nclearly unreasonable.\u201d (Ibid.)\n       The Court of Appeal never contended that the CDCR\u201fs interpretation of\nsection 3378 was clearly unreasonable. It instead chided the CDCR for appearing\nto rely \u201con an overly broad interpretation of our opinion in In re Furnace [(2010)\n185 Cal.App.4th 649],\u201d which, the Court of Appeal contended, did not address\n\u201cwhether mutuality or reciprocity was inherent in the concept of \u201eassociation.\u201f \u201d\nBecause that issue had not been decided in Furnace, the Court of Appeal\nconcluded that \u201cthe Furnace decision does not prevent us from interpreting\n\u201eassociation\u201f to mean a mutual relationship\u201d when a direct link is sought to be\nestablished through the source item category of \u201cassociation.\u201d\n\n                                            8\n\f       The issue before the Court of Appeal, though, was not whether a prior\njudicial decision had compelled the CDCR\u201fs interpretation of the regulation, but\n(rather) whether the construction offered by the CDCR, the agency that had\npromulgated the regulation and was charged with enforcing it, was clearly\nunreasonable.\n       Cabrera, by contrast, does argue that the CDCR\u201fs proffered interpretation is\nclearly unreasonable. He relies on In re Andrade (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 807, but\nthe case is clearly distinguishable. In that case, the Court of Appeal relied on the\n\u201cplain language\u201d of the regulation to determine that the interpretation proffered by\nthe Board of Prison Terms (now the Board of Parole Hearings) was \u201cclearly\nerroneous.\u201d (Andrade, supra, 141 Cal.App.4th at pp. 815, 817.) The regulation at\nissue directed the Board to consider \u201cwhether \u201e[t]he prisoner has made realistic\nplans for release or has developed marketable skills that can be put to use upon\nrelease.\u201f \u201d (Id. at p. 815, quoting Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 2402, subd. (d)(8).)\nThe Board had required the prisoner (Andrade) to prepare California parole plans,\neven though Andrade conceded he had entered the country illegally, planned to\nreturn to his native country, and there was a \u201cgreat probability\u201d he would be\nexpeditiously deported once released. (Andrade, at p. 816.) After consulting\ndictionary definitions of \u201crealistic,\u201d the Court of Appeal concluded that the\ncontingency of Andrade\u201fs remaining in the United States could not reasonably be\ndeemed realistic, given that he could not remain here legally and no employer\ncould legally employ him. (Id. at pp. 816-817.) In short, the Court of Appeal\nfound it could not be realistic to \u201crequire the prisoner to plan for the contingency\nthat the government might fail to do its job of deporting him. . . . It is self-evident\nthat the government may not require as a condition of parole that someone arrange\nto violate the law.\u201d (Id. at p. 817.)\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f       Here, by contrast, nothing in the plain language of section 3378 requires\nproof the inmate formed a reciprocal or mutual relationship with a validated gang\naffiliate in order to establish a direct link, via the source item category of\nassociation, with that gang affiliate. The Court of Appeal appears to suggest that\nsuch a requirement would nonetheless be necessary as a matter of policy, for\n\u201c[o]therwise, a validated gang affiliate could create such a relationship with an\ninmate unilaterally, without any assent or mutuality on the part of the inmate.\u201d\nBut the CDCR has not claimed the requisite connection could be formed by\nunilateral conduct by the validated gang affiliate. Rather, as the Court of Appeal\nacknowledges in the very next sentence of its opinion, the connection\ncontemplated by the CDCR is \u201cunilateral action by an inmate.\u201d\n       Moreover, the CDCR\u201fs policy of relying on unilateral inmate conduct to\nsatisfy the direct link to a validated gang affiliate is not clearly unreasonable.\nGangs \u201cpresent a serious threat to the safety and security of California prisons.\u201d\n(Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, \u00a7 3023, subd. (b).) \u201c \u201ePrison gangs are criminal\norganizations that must communicate with their affiliates to conduct gang\nbusiness, ensure group solidarity, and recruit and train new affiliates. Indeed, one\nof the primary duties of a gang affiliate is to establish a line of communication\nbetween himself and other gang affiliates.\u201f \u201d (In re Furnace, supra, 185\nCal.App.4th at p. 660.) Even though prison officials \u201crestrict correspondence\nbetween inmates, and are especially restrictive of the correspondence of validated\ngang affiliates housed in a security housing unit\u201d (ibid.), the declaration of Everett\nW. Fischer, an expert in the Mexican Mafia prison gang, explained that gang\naffiliates attempt to evade detection by using coded and hidden messages in\ndrawings and photos. Moreover, a gang affiliate may collect or keep a copy of\nsuch artwork to demonstrate his association with that validated gang member or\nassociate. \u201cAs a result,\u201d the expert declared, \u201csomething seemingly innocuous as\n\n                                           10\n\fa drawing can promote gang activity among inmates, which undermines the order\nand security of the institution.\u201d A requirement that prison officials demonstrate\nreciprocal interaction to establish a direct link between the inmate and a validated\ngang affiliate thus could seriously impair efforts to detect and prevent gang\nactivity in prisons.\n       Because the Court of Appeal\u201fs grant of habeas relief rested on the\nerroneous assumption that a direct link in this context required proof Cabrera had\na mutual relationship with a validated gang affiliate, we reverse the judgment.\nWhether the evidence is sufficient, under the regulation as properly construed, to\nuphold the validation of Cabrera as a gang associate, and whether the validation\nand placement in the SHU otherwise violates any of Cabrera\u201fs rights, is for the\nCourt of Appeal to decide on remand in the first instance.\n\n\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed, and the matter is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                                         BAXTER, J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.J.\nKENNARD, J.\nWERDEGAR, J.\nCHIN, J.\nCORRIGAN, J.\nLIU, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\fSee next page for addresses and telephone numbers for counsel who argued in Supreme Court.\n\nName of Opinion In re Cabrera\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nUnpublished Opinion\nOriginal Appeal\nOriginal Proceeding\nReview Granted XXX 198 Cal.App.4th 1548\nRehearing Granted\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOpinion No. S197283\nDate Filed: October 29, 2012\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCourt:\nCounty:\nJudge:\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCounsel:\n\nElvin Cabrera, in pro. per.; Michael Satris, under appointment by the Supreme Court, and Melanie K.\nDorian, under appointment by the Court of Appeal, for Petitioner Elvin Cabrera.\n\nEdmund G.
