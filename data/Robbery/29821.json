Before the Court is the question of whether DHS established sufficient\n\nprobable cause for the trial court to issue the order permitting entry into the home\n\nwithout consent. We conclude that DHS did not establish probable cause and thus\n\nreverse the order of the Superior Court.\n\n                          I. Factual and Procedural History\n\n       Mother, who is politically active, lives with her two young children (\u201cY.W.-B\u201d and\n\n\u201cN.W.-B\u201d) and the children\u2019s father (\u201cFather\u201d) in Philadelphia. On May 22, 2019, DHS\n\nallegedly received a general protective services report (\u201cGPS report\u201d) from an\n\nunidentified source alleging possible neglect by Mother. Although DHS referenced this\n\nGPS report several times at the evidentiary hearing and used it to refresh its sole\n\nwitness\u2019s recollection, it inexplicably never introduced it into evidence.     The only\n\ninformation of record regarding the contents of the GPS report are set forth in the\n\n\u201cPetitions to Compel Cooperation\u201d (the \u201cPetitions to Compel\u201d) subsequently filed by\n\nDHS.    In paragraph \u201cJ\u201d of the Petitions to Compel, DHS summarized the relevant\n\nallegations in the GPS report against Mother as follows:\n\n             J. On May 22, 2019, DHS received a GPS report alleging\n             that three weeks earlier, the family had been observed\n             sleeping outside of a Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA)\n             office located at 2103 Ridge Avenue; that on May 21, 2019,\n             [Mother] had been observed outside of the PHA office from\n             12:00 P.M. until 8:00 P.M. with one of the children in her\n             care; that Project Home dispatched an outreach worker to\n             assess the family; that [Mother] stated that she was not\n             homeless and that her previous residence had burned down;\n             and that it was unknown if [Mother] was feeding the children\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 2\n\f              [sic] she stood outside of the PHA office for extended\n              periods of time.[1] This report is pending determination.\n\nPetitions to Compel, 5/31/2019, \u00b6 J.\n\n       In summary, and as set forth in paragraph \u201cJ,\u201d two allegations were made in the\n\nreport: first, around three weeks prior to May 21, 2019 (or on approximately May 1,\n\n2019), the unidentified reporter claimed to have observed Mother\u2019s family sleeping\n\noutside of the Philadelphia Housing Authority. Project Home pursued this allegation\n\nwith Mother, who denied the family was homeless. Second, on May 21, 2019, the\n\nunidentified source apparently indicated that he or she had also observed Mother, with\n\none of her children, protesting outside of the office of the Philadelphia Housing Authority\n\nfrom noon until eight in the evening, and that it was \u201cunknown\u201d if Mother had fed the\n\nchild during that eight-hour time period. Mother does not challenge that these were the\n\nclaims of possible neglect in the GPS report, and we thus rely on the allegations in\n\nparagraph J in our analysis and disposition.\n\n       The same source provided DHS with the address of the family home. Project\n\nHome, a Philadelphia organization that attempts to alleviate homelessness, dispatched\n\na worker on May 22, 2019 to approach Mother. 2 In response to the Project Home\n\n\n\n1  It is not entirely clear whether this allegation relates to the family sleeping outside of\nthe Philadelphia Housing Authority three weeks earlier or on May 21st while Mother was\nprotesting for eight hours. Because this allegation regarding a failure to feed the\nchildren as she \u201cstood outside of the PHA office\u201d (rather than sleeping outside of the\nPHA office), herein we will assume that this allegation refers to Mother\u2019s protesting\nactivities on May 21st. The trial court made no finding of fact on the issue and the\nSuperior Court did not reference it in its opinion. In any event, this assumption has no\neffect on our disposition of the appeal before us.\n2 The Project Home representative did not testify at the evidentiary hearing and offered\nno evidence regarding whether or not the family was homeless. The record merely\n(Continued\u2026)\n\n                                    [J-39A&B-2021] - 3\n\fworker\u2019s questions, Mother stated that she was at the Philadelphia Housing Authority to\n\nprotest and that she was not homeless, although she indicated that a previous home\n\nhad been involved in a fire.\n\n       Later that same day, Tamisha Richardson, a DHS caseworker, verified the\n\naddress of the family\u2019s home via a search of the Department of Welfare\u2019s records.\n\nWhen she arrived at this address later in the day after the Project Home worker\u2019s visit,\n\nshe encountered Father, who denied Richardson entry into the residence and called\n\nMother, who then spoke with her over the phone. Trial Court Opinion, 9/9/2019, at 6-7.\n\nMother reiterated that she was protesting at the Philadelphia Housing Authority on May\n\n21st and denied that she had either of the children with her on that date.      Shortly\n\nthereafter, Mother arrived at the family home with the children and ushered them into\n\nthe house. Mother informed Richardson that she would not allow her into the home\n\nabsent a court order. Id. Richardson left but returned later the same day accompanied\n\nby police officers, again seeking entry into the home. Mother and Father continued to\n\nrefuse entry. Id.\n\n       On May 31, 2019, without conducting any additional investigation or making any\n\neffort to corroborate the allegations of the unidentified author of the GPS report, DHS\n\nfiled two Petitions to Compel the parents\u2019 cooperation with an in-home visit, one for\n\neach of the children. In the Petitions to Compel, DHS set forth the events of May 22,\n\n2019 and detailed the family\u2019s prior involvement with DHS, which consisted of a\n\ndependency matter that began in 2013 when DHS received a GPS report indicating that\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\nindicates that the representative asked Mother if her family was homeless and Mother\nresponded that they were not. Petitions to Compel, 5/31/2019, \u00b6 J.\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 4\n\fthe family home \u201cwas in deplorable condition; that there were holes in the walls; that the\n\nhome was infested with fleas; that the home lacked numerous interior walls; that the\n\ninterior structure of the home was exposed; that the home lacked hot water service and\n\nheat; and that the home appeared to be structurally unsound.\u201d Petitions to Compel,\n\n5/31/2019, \u00b6 C.      On October 29, 2013, Y.W.-B was adjudicated dependent and\n\ncommitted to DHS 3 until July 20, 2015, at which time DHS transferred legal and physical\n\ncustody back to Mother and Father. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 E-F. The family received in-home services\n\nthrough local community agencies and treatment centers through November 10, 2015,\n\nat which time DHS ceased its protective supervision of Y.W.-B and discharged the\n\ndependency matter. 4 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 H-I.\n\n        On June 11, 2019, the trial court held a hearing on the Petitions to Compel, at\n\nwhich Mother and Father appeared with counsel. DHS called Richardson as its single\n\nwitness. Richardson testified to the events of May 22nd and explained that because of\n\nthe allegations in the GPS report, she was required to assess the inside of the home to\n\ncomplete her investigation. N.T., 6/11/2019, at 11. She did not state or offer any\n\nevidence to support any belief that the conditions inside the home were deficient in any\n\nrespect (as had been the case in 2013). The trial court then questioned Mother from\n\nthe bench as to the status of her housing, the operability of her utilities, her employment\n\nstatus and whether the children were up-to-date with their medical and dental exams.\n\n\n3   N.W.-B was born in January 2015. Petitions to Compel, 5/31/19, \u00b6 G.\n4  The Petitions to Compel also noted Father\u2019s two criminal convictions in 1993 and\n1994, the first for drug offenses and the second for rape. Petitions to Compel,\n5/31/2019, \u00b6 O. The Petitions to Compel indicated that Mother\u2019s criminal history\nincluded convictions for theft and trespassing, but provided no timeframes. Id. \u00b6 N.\n\n\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 5\n\fMother responded by verifying her address and affirming that the utilities were\n\nfunctioning in her home, that she was employed, and that the children were current with\n\ntheir medical and dental exams. Id. at 12-14. During this inquiry, Mother asked the\n\npresiding judge why he was asking these questions of her and voiced her opinion that\n\nhis inquiries did not relate to the allegations in the GPS report. See id. at 13, 19.\n\n       Mother also stated her view that the GPS report was made in retaliation for her\n\nprotests of the Philadelphia Housing Authority. Id. at 15. She insisted that this was the\n\nthird time 5 that DHS had \u201ccom[e] after me. Every time the reports were proven to be\n\nfalse. This is retaliation. I\u2019m in the news. I\u2019m engaging in an ongoing protest at the\n\n[Philadelphia Housing Authority] headquarters and I\u2019m being retaliated against.\u201d Id.\n\n       After the close of testimony, the trial court stated that the probable cause\n\nrequirement had been met and that it was going to grant the Petitions to Compel. Id. at\n\n18. In this regard, the trial court stated that \u201c[i]f there\u2019s a report, that\u2019s their duty to\n\ninvestigate. You don\u2019t cooperate then I have to force you to cooperate.\u201d Id. at 16. The\n\norder stated in full:\n\n               AND NOW, this 11th day of June 2019, after conducting a\n               Motion to Compel Cooperation Hearing the court enters the\n               following order: Motion to Compel is Granted.\n\n5  A review of the lower court record reveals one such encounter. While not referenced\nin the trial court\u2019s opinion or in the briefs of Mother or DHS, the record reflects that in\n2016, the trial court granted a DHS petition to compel Mother and Father to cooperate\nwith a home visit based on numerous allegations of neglect, including that the family\nhome did not have water service, that Mother and Father had a history of domestic\nviolence and drug use, and that the neighbors were providing food and clothing to the\nchildren. Motion to Compel Cooperation, 10/27/2016, \u00b6 B. The trial court\u2019s order\nstated: \u201cView to Discharge at the next listing if parents are compliant.\u201d Cooperation\nOrder, 11/23/2016. After DHS conducted its home visit on November 30, 2016, the trial\ncourt dismissed DHS\u2019s motion to compel the next day (December 1, 2016). We were\nunable to locate any further records involving this encounter.\n\n\n\n                                    [J-39A&B-2021] - 6\n\f             Further Findings: Child resides with mother and father.\n\n             Further Order: Mother is to allow two DHS social workers in\n             the home to assess the home to verify if mother\u2019s home is\n             safe and appropriate on Friday, June 14, 2019 at 5:00pm.\n             Ms. Allison McDowell is to be present in mother\u2019s home as a\n             witness to the home assessment. Mother is NOT to record\n             or video, nor post on social media. Mother is to remove\n             current videos regarding DHS works from social media.\n             Parents or third parties are NOT to intimidate, harass or\n             threaten any social workers.\n\nPetitions to Compel Cooperation Order, 6/11/2019. 6          In its order, the trial court\n\ncontinued the evidentiary hearing until June 18, 2019.\n\n      Mother immediately filed a motion to stay the home inspection pending the\n\nresolution of her appeal. The trial court denied Mother\u2019s motion for a stay and the\n\ninspection occurred on June 14, 2019. When the hearing reconvened on June 18,\n\n2019, one of the DHS caseworkers who performed the inspection testified that although\n\nMother and Father did not permit the caseworkers to have access to the basement or\n\nthe living room (which was under renovation), the rest of the home, which they did\n\ninspect, was safe and suitable for the children. N.T., 6/18/2019, at 12-13, 18. The trial\n\ncourt then dismissed the motion to compel. Id. at 20.\n\n      Mother filed a timely notice of appeal of the trial court\u2019s June 11th order. 7   8   In her\n\nstatement of matters complained of on appeal pursuant to Rule 1925(b) of the\n\n6 Before the Superior Court, Mother challenged the trial court\u2019s prohibition of filming the\nDHS social workers during the home visit on the ground that it violated her First\nAmendment right to freedom of speech, which necessarily incorporates the act of\nrecording. The Superior Court agreed and reversed this portion of the trial court\u2019s order,\nindicating that \u201cunder the specific circumstances of this case, and in light of Mother\u2019s\nand DHS\u2019s arguments, we conclude that DHS failed to establish that its request for a\nno-recording provision was reasonable.\u201d In Interest of Y.W.-B, 241 A.3d 375, 395 (Pa.\nSuper. 2020), appeal granted, 243 A.3d 969 (Pa. 2021).\n\n\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 7\n\fPennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, Mother argued, inter alia, that the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s determination that DHS had established probable cause to allow the home\n\ninspection violated her rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States\n\nConstitution and Article 1, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In its written\n\nopinion pursuant to Rule 1925(a), the trial court recognized that a home inspection is\n\nsubject to \u201cthe limitations of state and federal search and seizure jurisprudence[,]\u201d Trial\n\nCourt Opinion, 9/9/2019, at 6, and that to compel cooperation with a home inspection,\n\nDHS must establish probable cause that an act of child abuse or neglect has occurred\n\nand that evidence relating to the abuse or neglect will be found in the home. Id. at 5-8.\n\nThe trial court relied on the concurrence in In re Petition to Compel Cooperation with\n\nChild Abuse Investigation, 875 A.2d 365 (Pa. Super. 2005)9 (Beck, J., concurring)\n\n(hereinafter the \u201cBeck Concurrence\u201d), for the proposition that \u201cthe standard notion of\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\n7 An order compelling cooperation with the scheduling and completion of an in-home\n\ninspection by a government agency is a final order for purposes of appeal. In re Petition\nto Compel Cooperation with Child Abuse Investigation, 875 A.2d 365, 369 (Pa. Super.\n2005).\n8  We agree with the Superior Court\u2019s determination that Mother\u2019s constitutional claims\nare not moot. In Interest of Y.W.-B, 241 A.3d at 381. In general, the mootness doctrine\nrequires that an actual case or controversy must be extant at all stages of review. See,\ne.g., Slice of Life, LLC v. Hamilton Twp. Zoning Hearing Bd., 207 A.3d 886, 897 (Pa.\n2019). This Court has recognized that issues \u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d\nfall within a limited exception to the mootness doctrine. Reuther v. Delaware Cty.\nBureau of Elections, 205 A.3d 302, 306 n.6 (Pa. 2019) (citing Nutter v. Dougherty, 938\nA.2d 401, 405 n.8 (Pa. 2007)). We have likewise recognized an exception for issues\nthat are of great and immediate public importance. Chester Water Auth. v. Pa. Dep't of\nCmty. & Econ. Dev., 249 A.3d 1106, 1115 (Pa. 2021) (citing Com., Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot.\nv. Cromwell Twp., Huntingdon Cty., 32 A.3d 639, 652 (Pa. 2011)). In our view, both\nexceptions apply here.\n9 Given the prominence of this opinion and, in particular, the concurring opinion, the\nopinions are later addressed in detail at pages 27-30.\n\n\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 8\n\fprobable cause in criminal cases\u201d does not apply to matters involving child protective\n\nservices agencies and that \u201c[w]hat an agency knows and how it acquired that\n\ninformation should not be subject to the same restrictions facing police seeking to\n\nsecure a search warrant in a criminal matter.\u201d      Trial Court Opinion, 9/9/2019, at 6\n\n(quoting Petition to Compel Cooperation, 875 A.2d at 380) (Beck, J., concurring)).\n\n      Operating under this principle, the trial court explained that it considered not only\n\nthe allegations contained in the Petitions to Compel, 10 but also the testimony presented\n\nby DHS at the hearing and the consternation Mother expressed when questioned by the\n\ntrial court regarding her ability to care for the children, her source of income, and her\n\nemployment status. Id. at 7. The trial court explained that \u201cone of the main factors of\n\nthe DHS investigation [was] the matter of homelessness and if the alleged address of\n\nthe family was suitable\u201d for the children, and that the home inspection would determine\n\nif the claims of homelessness and inadequate care had merit. Id. Because of DHS\u2019s\n\nallegations of homelessness and inadequate care, the trial court found that \u201cit was\n\nreasonable to ascertain whether the parents had stable housing; therefore, parents\n\nneeded to allow a home assessment.\u201d Id.\n\n      The Superior Court affirmed. In Interest of Y.W.-B, 241 A.3d 375 (Pa. Super.\n\n2020), appeal granted, 243 A.3d 969 (Pa. 2021). Relying on its prior decision in Petition\n\nto Compel Cooperation, it first found that both the Fourth Amendment and Article I,\n\n\n10  As discussed, this included averments regarding Mother\u2019s previous involvement with\nDHS in 2013, which involved allegations of physical abuse against the older child,\nMother\u2019s employment status, whether the child\u2019s basic needs were being met, and\ninadequate housing. Trial Court Opinion, 9/9/2019, at 1-2. In connection with those\nallegations, the child was adjudicated dependent for a period of time. In November\n2015, the trial court discharged the dependency. Id. at 2.\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 9\n\fSection 8 11 apply to regulations promulgated pursuant to Pennsylvania\u2019s Child\n\nProtective Services Law (\u201cCPSL\u201d), 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6301-6386, that govern an agency\u2019s\n\nduty to investigate allegations of abuse or neglect within a home. As such, to compel\n\ncooperation with a home inspection, an agency must establish probable cause before it\n\nwill be permitted to enter a private residence to conduct an investigation. In Interest of\n\nY.W.-B, 241 A.3d at 384 (citing Petition to Compel Cooperation, 875 A.2d at 377-78).\n\nDrawing on the Beck Concurrence, the Superior Court considered the different\n\npurposes of child protective laws and criminal laws as reflected in the procedural\n\ndifferences for obtaining a warrant in a criminal case and a motion to compel in a child\n\nwelfare case. For instance, in criminal law, the procedure to obtain a search warrant is\n\nentirely ex parte such that the target of the search has no opportunity to challenge the\n\nallegations contained in the warrant application or affidavit before the warrant issues.\n\nId. at 385 (citing Commonwealth v. Milliken, 300 A.2d 78, 80 (Pa. 1973); Pa.R.Crim.P.\n\n203(B)). In contrast, under the CPSL, trial courts may conduct an evidentiary hearing\n\nbefore the issuance of an order granting a search of the home, at which time the\n\nparents may cross-examine witnesses, testify on their own behalf, and otherwise\n\nchallenge the evidence put forth in support of the motion to compel. Id. Moreover, the\n\nSuperior Court noted, there are no statutory provisions or procedural rules that cabin a\n\n\n11  In the \u201cCounter-Statement of the Issues Involved\u201d\u2019 in its brief filed with this Court,\nDHS contends that Mother failed to preserve a claim under Article I, Section 8 of the\nPennsylvania Constitution in either the trial court or the Superior Court. Because\nMother asserted violations of Article I, Section 8 before the trial court, the Superior\nCourt and now in this Court, we conclude that Mother has preserved this constitutional\nclaim. For present purposes, we take no position, one way or the other, with respect to\nMother\u2019s contention that Article I, Section 8 provides greater constitutional protections\nthan does the Fourth Amendment. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 42.\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 10\n\ftrial court\u2019s consideration of a motion to compel to the contents within the four corners of\n\nthat motion, and so trial courts are free to consider additional evidence relevant to its\n\ninquiry, including any prior experiences they have had with the parents that would be\n\nrelevant to a probable cause determination. Id. at 385-86. The court ultimately held\n\nthat\n\n              an agency may obtain a court order compelling a parent's\n              cooperation with a home visit upon a showing of a fair\n              probability that a child is in need of services, and that\n              evidence relating to that need will be found inside the home.\n              In making a probable cause determination, however, the trial\n              court may consider evidence presented at a hearing on the\n              petition, as well as the court's and the agency's prior history\n              to the extent it is relevant.\n\nId. at 386 (internal citations omitted).\n\n       Applying this standard, the Superior Court pointed to the testimony of the DHS\n\ncaseworker, who corroborated that DHS received a GPS report on May 22, 2019\n\nalleging \u201chomelessness and inadequate basic care,\u201d and that the home visit was\n\nintended to make sure the home was appropriate, the utilities were working, and that\n\nthere was food in the house. Thus, the Superior Court found no error in the trial court\u2019s\n\nprobable cause determination, as the averments in DHS\u2019s petition, supported by\n\nevidence at the hearing, corroborated the initial report and established a \u201clink\u201d between\n\nthe initial allegations of homelessness and inadequate care and DHS\u2019s motion seeking\n\nto enter the home. Id. at 390.\n\n       This Court granted Mother\u2019s petition seeking allowance of appeal to consider the\n\nfollowing issues:\n\n       (1)    Did the Superior Court err in creating a rule of law that\n              violates Article 1, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution,\n              when it ruled that where a Pennsylvania Child Protective\n\n\n\n                                     [J-39A&B-2021] - 11\n\f              Services agency receives a report that alleges that a child is\n              in need of services, and that there is a fair probability that\n              there is evidence that would substantiate that allegation in a\n              private home, where the record does not display a link\n              between the allegations in the report and anything in that\n              private home, then that government agency shall have\n              sweeping authority to enter and search a private home?\n       (2)    Did the Superior Court err in creating a rule of law that\n              violates the Fourth Amendment of the United States\n              Constitution, when it ruled that where a Pennsylvania Child\n              Protective Services agency receives a report that alleges\n              that a child is in need of services, and that there is a fair\n              probability that there is evidence that would substantiate that\n              allegation in a private home, where the record does not\n              display a link between the allegations in the report and\n              anything in that private home, and there was no showing of\n              particularity, then that government agency shall have\n              sweeping authority to enter and search a private home?\nIn Interest of Y.W.-B, 243 A.3d 969 (Pa. 2021) (per curiam).              The constitutional\n\nchallenges before us present questions of law over which our review is plenary. See,\n\ne.g., Washington v. Dep't of Pub. Welfare, 188 A.3d 1135, 1149 (Pa. 2018). With\n\nrespect to findings of fact and credibility determinations of the trial court, the standard of\n\nreview in dependency cases requires an appellate court to accept them \u201cif they are\n\nsupported by the record, but does not require the appellate court to accept the lower\n\ncourt's inferences or conclusions of law.\u201d In re L.Z., 111 A.3d 1164, 1174 (Pa. 2015)\n\n(quoting In re R.J.T., 9 A.3d 1179, 1190 (Pa. 2010)).\n\n\n                             II.     The Parties\u2019 Arguments\n\n       Mother argues that the Superior Court\u2019s decision created an unconstitutionally\n\ndiluted version of the probable cause standard to be applied when a government\n\nagency is seeking to compel cooperation with a home inspection based on allegations\n\nof child neglect. In her view, the Superior Court\u2019s adoption of the sentiment, derived\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-39A&B-2021] - 12\n\ffrom the Beck Concurrence, that child welfare agencies should not be held to the same\n\nrestrictions as police in criminal investigations in the acquisition of information to\n\ndevelop probable cause vitiates the protections against unreasonable searches\n\nguaranteed by the Fourth Amendment and Article 1, Section 8.\n\n       Mother believes that the Superior Court eliminated three aspects of constitutional\n\nprotection. The first is the requirement that the order indicate with particularity the area\n\nand items targeted by the search. Mother claims that the trial court\u2019s order granting\n\nentry into her home completely failed to set forth the parameters of the search to be\n\nconducted. Mother\u2019s Brief at 26-27. 12 Second, she maintains that the Superior Court\u2019s\n\nruling eliminates the need for an assessment of the reliability of the source of the\n\ninformation upon which probable cause is based. Noting that this Court has upheld this\n\n\u201creliability factor\u201d as a critical part of a probable cause determination, she argues that\n\nthe standard established by the Superior Court fails to incorporate an assessment of the\n\nreliability of the reporting source. Id. at 28-30 (citing Commonwealth v. Clark, 28 A.3d\n\n1284 (Pa. 2011)). Third, probable cause requires a nexus between the allegations of\n\nneglect and the individual\u2019s home. Mother argues that the Superior Court eliminated\n\nthis requirement by permitting a home assessment upon no more than the vague\n\nallegation that a child is in need of services. Id. at 32-33. 13 This case, Mother asserts,\n\n\n\n12  Given our conclusion that DHS failed to offer sufficient evidence to establish\nprobable cause to enter and search Mother\u2019s home, we do not reach Mother\u2019s\ncontention that the trial court\u2019s order lacked sufficient particularity.\n\n13  Highlighting the impact of the greatly relaxed probable cause standard, Mother\nargues that DHS\u2019s regulations require child protective agencies to make a home visit in\nthe case of every GPS report. Mother\u2019s Brief at 32 (citing 55 Pa. Code \u00a7 3490.232(f)).\nIn her brief filed with this Court, Mother cites to the Pennsylvania Department of Human\n(Continued\u2026)\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 13\n\fexhibits a complete lack of nexus between the allegations in the GPS report and\n\nanything that could be found within the home, and this lack of nexus by itself renders\n\nthe search unconstitutional. Id. at 32-34.\n\n       Mother argues that before cooperation with a home inspection may be\n\ncompelled, the trial court\u2019s probable cause determination should require consideration\n\nof not only the particularity, reliability and nexus requirements, but also the\n\ngovernment\u2019s interest or justification for the search; the extent of the government\n\nintrusion being requested; and whether there are acceptable alternatives to a\n\ngovernment intrusion that would address the government\u2019s interests. Id. at 55.\n\n       DHS agrees that probable cause must be established before a family may be\n\ncompelled to cooperate with a home inspection, but it rejects the notion that the\n\nconsiderations identified by Mother must be strictly enforced. DHS\u2019s Brief at 16-17.\n\nDHS echoes the sentiment expressed in the Beck Concurrence that probable cause \u201cin\n\nthe child protective arena is far different from what constitutes probable cause in the\n\ncriminal law.\u201d Id. at 19 (quoting Petition to Compel Cooperation, 875 A.2d at 380 (Beck,\n\nJ., concurring)).\n\n       With these considerations in mind, DHS argues that there is no need for a\n\nparticularity requirement in the context of probable cause for a home inspection for\n\nneglect because there is no particular \u201cthing\u201d that is the subject of such a search,\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\nServices 2019 annual report, which reflects that in that year it received 178,124 GPS\nreports statewide. Of those, 95,671 were screened out, leaving county agencies to\ninvestigate 82,427 GPS reports \u2013 with 41,937 deemed valid and 40,490\nunsubstantiated. Thus, according to Mother, this reflects that there are \u201cnearly 100,000\npotential searches into Pennsylvania homes each year.\u201d Id. at 17.\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 14\n\fsuggesting that neglect is a permeating condition found throughout the home. Id. at 24\n\n(\u201c[W]here the allegation in a GPS report is a lack of care in the home, an order to\n\ninspect the general conditions of the home is sufficiently particular.\u201d) (emphasis in\n\noriginal). In a similar manner, DHS contends that \u201cthere is almost always a nexus\n\nbetween the home and potential allegations of neglect\u201d and that \u201c[w]ithout searching the\n\nhome, DHS has no way to ensure\u201d that adequate care is being provided. Id. (emphasis\n\nin original). In this instance, in DHS\u2019s view, when assessing probable cause, it would\n\nhave been more salient for the trial court to focus on the need for the search, the\n\nminimal intrusiveness of the requested search, Mother\u2019s prior involvement with DHS,\n\nand her evasive demeanor at the hearing. Id. at 20. 14 DHS also rejects Mother\u2019s\n\ncontention that the Superior Court\u2019s standard is too vague, arguing that \u201ctwo layers of\n\nprotection\u201d prevent this standard from being applied improperly \u2013 specifically, the\n\ncounties\u2019 screening processes to weed out unfounded reports and the due process\n\nprotections provided by the hearing on a motion to compel. Id. at 43-44. DHS argues\n\nthat United States Supreme Court precedent supports less stringent probable cause\n\nrequirements for the home inspections it performs, a contention we address in our\n\nanalysis.\n\n\n14  DHS characterizes the assessment here as minimally intrusive and not designed to\nuncover criminal activity. DHS\u2019s Brief at 25-31. Because the search here was not for\nevidence of a crime and did not involve the police, DHS contends that \u201cMother had less\nprivacy interests at stake.\u201d Id. at 29-30. Also weighing in favor of allowing the search,\naccording to DHS, is the fact that the trial court found Mother evasive when it\nquestioned her and that Mother had a history of involvement with DHS related to the\nconditions of her home. Id. at 32-35. Regarding the role of anonymous reports, DHS\nemphasizes that anonymous reports are crucial for child protective investigations, as\nanonymity often provides cover that allows reporters to feel comfortable making a\nreport. Id. at 35-36.\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 15\n\f                                     III.   Analysis\n\nA.     Constitutional Limitations on Home Entry\n\n       Pennsylvania\u2019s CPSL defines two types of reports received by county agencies.\n\nA general protective service report (a GPS report) is \u201c[a] verbal or written statement to\n\nthe county agency from someone alleging that a child is in need of general protective\n\nservices[,]\u201d which are in turn defined as, inter alia, services to prevent the potential for\n\nharm to a child who \u201c[i]s without proper parental care or control, subsistence, education\n\nas required by law, or other care or control necessary for his physical, mental, or\n\nemotional health, or morals.\u201d 55 Pa. Code \u00a7 3490.223(i). In contrast, a child protective\n\nreport (\u201cCPS\u201d) is made by someone who has \u201creasonable cause to suspect that a child\n\nhas been abused.\u201d 55 Pa. Code \u00a7 3490.11(a).\n\n       When a county agency receives a GPS report indicating that a child is not\n\nreceiving proper care, the agency must within sixty days conduct an \u201cassessment,\u201d\n\nwhich is defined as \u201c[a]n evaluation \u2026 to determine whether or not a child is in need of\n\ngeneral protective services.\u201d 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6375(c)(1); 55 Pa. Code \u00a7 3490.232(e). As\n\npart of its assessment, the CPSL and its regulations provide that the county agency\n\nmust perform \u201cat least one home visit[.]\u201d 55 Pa. Code \u00a7 3490.232(f); 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n\n6375(g) (\u201cThe county agency shall \u2026 conduct in-home visits.\u201d). The CPSL and its\n\nregulations further state that the county agency may initiate court proceedings if \u201ca\n\nhome visit \u2026 is refused by the parent.\u201d 55 Pa. Code \u00a7 3490.232(j); see also 23 Pa.C.S.\n\n\u00a7 6375(j). On the two prior occasions in which the Superior Court has addressed the\n\nissue, it has held that trial courts may grant an order requiring parents to cooperate with\n\na home visit only when it is entered in accordance with the requirement of probable\n\n\n\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 16\n\fcause pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I,\n\nSection 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.

The parties to the present appeal both agree that an order permitting a home\n\nvisit must comport with federal and state constitutional limitations. Mother\u2019s Brief at 13;\n\nDHS\u2019s Brief at 14.\n\n       The Fourth Amendment establishes the \u201cright of the people to be secure in their\n\npersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d\n\nand that \u201cno [w]arrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or\n\naffirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or\n\nthings to be seized.\u201d U.S. CONST. amend. IV. \u201c[P]hysical entry of the home is the chief\n\nevil against which the ... Fourth Amendment is directed[.]\u201d United States v. United\n\nStates Dist. Court, 407 U.S. 297, 313 (1972).         \u201cAt the very core [of the Fourth\n\nAmendment] stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free\n\nfrom unreasonable governmental intrusion.\u201d Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505,\n\n511 (1961); see also Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 586 (1980) (\u201cIt is a \u2018basic\n\nprinciple of Fourth Amendment law\u2019 that searches and seizures inside a home without a\n\nwarrant are presumptively unreasonable.\u201d). As the Supreme Court recently reiterated:\n\n              When it comes to the Fourth Amendment, the home is first\n              among equals. At the Amendment's very core, we have\n              said, stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home\n              and there be free from unreasonable government intrusion.\n              Or again: [f]reedom in one's own dwelling is the archetype of\n              the privacy protection secured by the Fourth Amendment;\n              conversely, physical entry of the home is the chief evil\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 17\n\f             against which it is directed. The Amendment thus draws a\n             firm line at the entrance to the house.\n\nLange v. California, __ U.S.__; 141 S. Ct. 2011, 2018 (2021) (internal citations and\n\nquotations omitted).\n\n      Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides:\n\n      \u00a7 8. Security from searches and seizures\n\n            The people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers\n            and possessions from unreasonable searches and seizures,\n            and no warrant to search any place or to seize any person or\n            things shall issue without describing them as nearly as may\n            be, nor without probable cause, supported by oath or\n            affirmation subscribed to by the affiant.\n\nPA. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 8. Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution protects all\n\ncitizens in this Commonwealth against unreasonable searches by requiring a high level\n\nof particularity, i.e., that warrants (or here, an order to compel) describe \u201cas nearly as\n\nmay be\u201d the place to be searched and the items to be seized with specificity. Article I,\n\nSection 8 also requires that a warrant be supported by probable cause to believe that\n\nthe items sought will provide evidence of a crime. Commonwealth v. Waltson, 724 A.2d\n\n289, 292 (Pa. 1998).\n\n      It is well established that \u201c[p]robable cause exists where the facts and\n\ncircumstances within the affiant's knowledge and of which he [or she] has reasonably\n\ntrustworthy information are sufficient in and of themselves to warrant a person of\n\nreasonable caution in the belief that a search should be conducted.\u201d Commonwealth v.\n\nJacoby, 170 A.3d 1065, 1081-82 (Pa. 2017). To assess whether probable cause has\n\nbeen established, the issuing authority makes a \u201cpractical, common-sense decision\u201d\n\nbased on the totality of the circumstances and the information in the affidavit (or here,\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 18\n\fthe Petitions to Compel), whether, given the relative veracity and basis of knowledge of\n\npersons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that relevant evidence\n\nwill be found in a particular place. Id. at 1082.\n\nB.     Standards for Assessing the Existence of Probable Cause with Respect to\n       a Petition to Compel Entry into a Home in a Case Initiated by the Filing of a\n       GPS Report\n\n       While the parties to the present appeal agree that an order permitting a home\n\nvisit must be supported by probable cause, they do not agree on what constitutes\n\nprobable cause in a civil proceeding initiated by the filing of a GPS report.        DHS\n\ndisagrees that probable cause with respect to home visits by social workers should be\n\nassessed based upon the fundamental principles developed primarily in the criminal law\n\ncontext, including that there be a nexus between the areas to be searched and the\n\nsuspected crime committed, an assessment of the veracity and reliability of anonymous\n\nsources of evidence, and facts that are closely related in time to the date of issuance of\n\nthe warrant. DHS\u2019s Brief at 19. DHS contends that social service agencies \u201cshould not\n\nbe hampered from performing their duties because they have not satisfied search and\n\nseizure jurisprudence developed in the context of purely criminal law.\u201d Id. Relying upon\n\nWyman v. James, 400 U.S. 309 (1971) and Camara v. Municipal Court of the City and\n\nCounty of San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523 (1967), DHS contends that the protection of\n\nchildren is an essential societal value and thus the interests it serves through home\n\nvisits are more worthy of the public\u2019s concern than are Mother\u2019s interests in the\n\nprotection of the sanctity of her home. DHS\u2019s Brief at 21. Finally, DHS further insists\n\nthat unlike an entry into a home to search for evidence of a crime, a child protective\n\nhome assessment is nothing more than a \u201cminimally invasive spot-check\u201d for evidence\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-39A&B-2021] - 19\n\fof neglect (e.g., like confirmation that the home had basic utilities, food and beds). Id. at\n\n25-26.\n\n         We disagree with DHS\u2019s position. The evidentiary principles used to guide an\n\nanalysis of whether sufficient evidence exists to establish probable cause has\n\ndeveloped over many years in a wide variety of contexts. In this regard, while we are\n\nnot bound by the decisions of federal circuit courts, we find persuasive the opinion of\n\nthe Third Circuit in Good v. Dauphin County Social Services for Children and Youth, 891\n\nF.2d 1087 (3d Cir. 1989). In Good, members of the Harrisburg Police and two social\n\nworkers entered and searched a home without a warrant or other legal justification (e.g.,\n\nconsent or exigency). The social workers argued that they were entitled to sovereign\n\nimmunity because the law had not been developed to make clear that because this was\n\na child abuse case, their actions would not be governed \u201cby the well-established legal\n\nprinciples developed in the context of residential intrusions motivated by less pressing\n\nconcerns.\u201d Id. at 1094. The Third Circuit disagreed, ruling that the controlling standards\n\nfor determining whether probable cause exists in cases involving possible harm to\n\nchildren are the same as those developed in criminal cases and that no perceived\n\nincrease in the societal interest involved alters these standards.\n\n               It evidences no lack of concern for the victims of child abuse\n               or lack of respect for the problems associated with its\n               prevention to observe that child abuse is not sui generis in\n               this context. The Fourth Amendment caselaw has been\n               developed in a myriad of situations involving very serious\n               threats to individuals and society, and we find no suggestion\n               there that the governing principles should vary depending on\n               the court's assessment of the gravity of the societal risk\n               involved. We find no indication that the principles developed\n               in the emergency situation cases we have heretofore\n               discussed will be ill suited for addressing cases like the one\n               before us.\n\n\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 20\n\fId. (footnotes omitted)\n\n       This basic principle, namely that the requirement of probable cause to permit\n\nentry into a private home is not excused based upon any relative perceived societal\n\nimportance, was further articulated by the United States Supreme Court in Mincey v.\n\nArizona, 437 U.S. 385 (1978).        In Mincey, the police argued that the extreme\n\nimportance of the immediate investigation of murders justified a warrantless search of a\n\nmurder scene. The Supreme Court emphatically disagreed:\n\n              [T]he State points to the vital public interest in the prompt\n              investigation of the extremely serious crime of murder. No\n              one can doubt the importance of this goal. But the public\n              interest in the investigation of other serious crimes is\n              comparable. If the warrantless search of a homicide scene\n              is reasonable, why not the warrantless search of the scene\n              of a rape, a robbery, or a burglary? \u2018No consideration\n              relevant to the Fourth Amendment suggests any point of\n              rational limitation\u2019 of such a doctrine.\n\nId. at 393 (quoting Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 766 (1969)).\n\n       The Wyman and Camara cases relied on by DHS do not support its position. At\n\nissue in Wyman was a New York regulation that was part of a program to provide aid to\n\ndependent children (i.e., children in families who qualified for welfare). The regulation\n\nrequired social workers to make an initial home visit and subsequent periodic visits for\n\npublic financial aid to begin and thereafter to continue. The Supreme Court concluded\n\nthat the home visits in this circumstance did not violate the Fourth Amendment. In so\n\nruling, the Court focused on the public interest in insuring that state tax monies are\n\nspent on their proper objects and encouraging welfare recipients to return to self-\n\nsufficiency; the limited scope of the entry and its consensual nature; the fact that the\n\nrecipients were entitled to advance notice; and the fact that all welfare recipients were\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 21\n\fsubjected to the entries, which thus were not based on individualized suspicion of\n\nwrongdoing. Wyman, 400 U.S. at 318-23; see also Walsh v. Erie Cty. Dep\u2019t of Job and\n\nFamily Servs., 240 F. Supp. 2d 731, 745 (N.D. Ohio 2003).\n\n       The circumstances of the recipients of financial aid in Wyman differ significantly\n\nand substantially from those of Mother in this case. In Wyman, the persons at issue\n\naffirmatively sought financial benefits to which they were not automatically entitled to\n\nreceive. The Court ruled that a state can lawfully condition the receipt of benefits on\n\nvarious conditions, including comprehensive disclosure of the applicant's financial\n\nstatus. In addition, the state can lawfully take steps, such as periodic inspections of\n\nrecipients\u2019 homes, to ensure that fraud is not occurring and that the recipients remain\n\nentitled to continued benefits.    Under Wyman, the diminishment of privacy of the\n\nrecipients of the benefits was a quid pro quo for receiving the welfare payments. The\n\nrecipients consented to the inspections in exchange for the receipt of benefits. In the\n\npresent case, by contrast, Mother sought nothing from DHS other than her basic right to\n\nbe left alone. The government cannot condition a parent\u2019s right to raise her children on\n\nperiodic home inspection unsupported by probable cause.\n\n       In Camara, the Supreme Court addressed a circumstance where a San\n\nFrancisco tenant challenged a city code provision that allowed health and safety\n\ninspectors to conduct warrantless searches of apartments to check for possible code\n\nviolations.   The Court began by emphasizing that an administrative inspection for\n\npossible violations of a city's housing code was a \u201csignificant intrusion upon the interests\n\nprotected by the Fourth Amendment[.]\u201d Camara, 387 U.S. at 534.

For instance, even the most law-abiding citizen\n              has a very tangible interest in limiting the circumstances\n              under which the sanctity of his home may be broken by\n              official authority, for the possibility of criminal entry under the\n              guise of official sanction is a serious threat to personal and\n              family security.\n\nId. at 530-31 (footnote omitted); see also Michigan v.

While certain of these cases cite to Camara, that fact\nis coincidental to the reasons for which we cite them. Concurring and Dissenting\nOpinion (Dougherty, J.) at 22 n.12 In connection with Tyler, for instance, we note only\nthat administrative searches are governed by the Fourth Amendment. See supra p. 23.\nTyler has no specific connection to searches in the child protective context; as it instead\ndeals with firefighters entering private property to fight a fire, Tyler, 436 U.S. at 511, and\nit cites to Camara for the unremarkable proposition that once the firefighters leave,\n\u201cadditional entries to investigate the cause of the fire must be made pursuant to the\nwarrant procedures governing administrative searches[,]\u201d as set forth in Camara. Id.\nNew Jersey v. T.L.O, 469 U.S. 325 (1985) reaffirms that the Fourth Amendment\nsafeguards privacy against invasion by government officials generally (not just the\npolice). It involved searches of school students by school officials.\u201d Camara was cited\nsolely for the proposition that the Fourth Amendment applies outside the criminal\ncontext. Id. at 335 (\u201cBecause the individual's interest in privacy and personal security\n\u2018suffers whether the government's motivation is to investigate violations of criminal laws\nor breaches of other statutory or regulatory standards\u201d it would be anomalous to say\nthat the individual and his private property are fully protected by the Fourth Amendment\nonly when the individual is suspected of criminal behavior.\u201d) (citations omitted). The\nTenth Circuit in Roska ex rel. Roska v. Peterson, 328 F.3d 1230 (10th Cir. 2003)\nrejected the existence of a social worker exception to the Fourth Amendment. The\ncourt cited to Camara for the limited purpose of comparing Camara\u2019s warrant\nrequirement in the administrative context to a case in which the \u201cspecial needs\u201d doctrine\npermitted a warrantless search of someone\u2019s home.

Camara, 387 U.S. at\n\n535. Accordingly, given this distinctive circumstance, the Court concluded that probable\n\ncause to issue a warrant to inspect exists \u201cif reasonable legislative or administrative\n\nstandards for conducting an area inspection are satisfied with respect to a particular\n\ndwelling.\u201d Id. at 538\n\n\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\nWisconsin, 483 U.S. 868 (1987)). Finally, in Walsh v. Erie County, 240 F. Supp. 2d 731\n(N.D. Ohio 2003), the federal district court declined to recognize a social worker\nexception to the Fourth Amendment and cited to Camara as an example of Fourth\nAmendment protections extending beyond the criminal context. Id. at 744-45.\n\nDHS does not contend that \u201cspecial needs, beyond the normal need for law\nenforcement,\u201d Commonwealth v. Hicks, 208 A.3d 916, 938 (Pa. 2019), dispense with\nthe requirement of probable cause in child neglect investigations. To the contrary, as\nindicated above, DHS agrees that probable cause must be established before a court\nmay order a home visit. DHS\u2019s Brief at 14. See, e.g., Gates v. Texas Dep't of\nProtective & Regulatory Servs., 537 F.3d 404, 424 (5th Cir. 2008) (\u201cThe purpose of\nTDPRS's entry into the Gateses' home \u2013 the investigation of possible child abuse \u2013 was\nclosely tied with law enforcement \u2026 [and because] the need to enter the Gateses' home\nwas not divorced from the state's general interest in law enforcement, there was no\nspecial need that justified the entry.\u201d).\n\nIn sum, these cases do not contradict the conclusion that no social worker exception to\nthe Fourth Amendment exists or that traditional probable cause requirements apply in\nthe context of home visits in connection with child neglect circumstances.\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 24\n\f      Camara has no application with respect to home visits to investigate allegations\n\nof child neglect. Unlike in Camara, which involved an agency\u2019s decision to conduct an\n\narea inspection based upon its appraisal of the conditions in the area as a whole to\n\nprotect the public, probable cause to conduct a home visit depends upon whether\n\nprobable cause exists to justify the entry into a particular home based upon credible\n\nevidence that child neglect may be occurring in that particular home. Moreover, and\n\nimportantly, the scope of the search in the present case was in no respect limited to\n\nensuring compliance with certain identified housing code violations. The search here\n\nallowed DHS investigators to search the home, including every room, closet and drawer\n\nin the home, based entirely upon their own discretion. In short, while the search here\n\nwas not conducted by law enforcement, its scope bore little or no relation to a traditional\n\nadministrative search.      As such, the contention that Camara\u2019s holding that\n\nadministrative searches on an area basis are permitted where \u201creasonable legislative\n\nand administrative standards are satisfied\u201d16 is insufficient to allow the exhaustive\n\n\n\n16  In Camara, the Supreme Court held that given the unique and limited nature of the\nadministrative searches at issue there, compliance with \u201creasonable legislative and\nadministrative standards,\u201d in and of itself, satisfied the probable cause requirement.\nCamara, 387 U.S. at 535. No similar result may maintain for child protection home\nvisits. The legislative and administrative standards in the CPSL and the regulations\npromulgated thereunder provide that at least one home visit must be conducted in every\ncase in which a GPS report, 55 Pa. Code. \u00a7 3490.232(f), or a CPS report, 55 Pa. Code\n\u00a7 3490.55(i), is received, without a requirement that any constitutional requirements be\nsatisfied. In Petition to Compel, the Superior Court held that despite the mandatory\nnature of the need for a home visit in every instance, home visits are permitted only\nwhere the agency files \u201ca verified petition alleging facts amounting to probable cause to\nbelieve that an act of child abuse or neglect has occurred and evidence relating to such\nabuse will be found in the home.\u201d Petition to Compel, 875 A.2d at 377. DHS in this\ncase does not contest that Pennsylvania law requires that home visits, despite the\nmandatory nature of Sections 3490.232(f) or 3490.55(i), must be supported by a\nseparate showing of the existence of probable cause. DHS\u2019s Brief at 8.\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 25\n\fsearch of the entirety of family\u2019s home without a clear showing, based upon competent\n\nand, as necessary, corroborated, evidence establishing individualized suspicion exists\n\nallowing entry into a private home.\n\n      The Concurring and Dissenting Opinion nevertheless urges application of\n\nCamara with respect to child protection home visits. We decline to do so. Decided in\n\n1967, Camara was the Supreme Court\u2019s first blessing of what has come to be known as\n\na \u201cdragnet search,\u201d namely one in which the government searches every person, place,\n\nor thing in a specific location or involved in a specific activity.   See generally Eve\n\nBrensike Primus, Disentangling Administrative Searches, 111 Colum. L. Rev. 254, 263\n\n(2011). Dragnet searches are not predicated on individualized showings of probable\n\ncause, nor indeed on any kind of individualized suspicion. See City of Golden Valley v.\n\nWiebesick, 899 N.W.2d 152, 161 (Minn. 2017) (\u201cAdministrative search warrants must be\n\nsupported by probable cause; not individualized suspicion but \u2018reasonable legislative or\n\nadministrative standards for conducting an area inspection.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Camara, 387\n\nU.S. at 538); Christopher Slobogin, The Liberal Assault on the Fourth Amendment, 4\n\nOhio St. J. Crim. L. 603, 611 (2007) (noting the individualized suspicion requirement\n\ncannot be honored when large groups of people are subjected to searches or seizures).\n\nOn the contrary, the hallmark of a dragnet search is its generality, as it reaches\n\neveryone in a category rather than only a chosen few. In addition to the safety-related\n\ninspection of every home in a given area in Camara, other dragnets include checkpoints\n\nwhere government officials stop, for example, every car or every third car driving on a\n\nparticular roadway, see also United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 550 (1976)\n\n(upholding checkpoint stops for illegal aliens near the border); and drug testing\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 26\n\fprograms that require every person involved in a given activity to submit to urinalysis.\n\nSee, e.g., Bd. of Educ. v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822, 837 (2002) (permitting random drug\n\ntesting of students involved in extracurricular activities).\n\n       Dragnet searches are justified if they satisfy a balance of interests and are\n\nnecessary because a regime of individualized suspicion could not effectively serve the\n\ngovernment's interest. In Camara, the Court suggested that if the legislative standards\n\nwere reasonable, probable cause existed because \u201cthe only effective way to seek\n\nuniversal compliance with the minimum standards required by municipal codes is\n\nthrough routine periodic inspections of all structures.\u201d Camara, 387 U.S. at 535-36,\n\n538. Based on this rationale, there could not reasonably be an individual suspicion\n\nbecause the inspections are routine and periodic. The Court has subsequently found\n\nthat the traditional probable cause standard \u201cmay be unhelpful in analyzing the\n\nreasonableness of routine administrative functions.\u201d Nat\u2019l Treasury Emps. Union v.\n\nVon Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 668 (1989) (emphasis added) (constitutionality of drug-testing\n\nprogram analyzing urine specimens of employees who applied for promotion to\n\npositions involving interdiction of illegal drugs). In Von Raab, a case involving a routine\n\nsearch that set out to prevent hazardous conditions from developing, the Court found\n\nthat such searches can be conducted \u201cwithout any measure of individualized suspicion.\u201d\n\nId.\n\n       In the 1980s, the Court recognized a separate category of administrative\n\nsearches for groups of people shown to possess reduced expectations of privacy,\n\nincluding students, New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 340 (1985), government\n\nemployees, O'Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.S. 709, 725 (1987), probationers, Griffin v.\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-39A&B-2021] - 27\n\fWisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 879 (1987), and parolees, Samson v. California, 547 U.S.\n\n843, 847 (2006). These types of searches typically carry stigmatic burdens imposed by\n\nsuggestions of wrongdoing, as they target those who are generally more likely to be\n\nlikely to engage in wrongdoing, e.g., probationers and paroles, than other individuals.\n\nEve Brensike Primus, Disentangling Administrative Searches, 111 Colum. L. Rev.at\n\n272. While these cases did not require the same level of individualized suspicion\n\ntypically required to authorize a Fourth Amendment search because of the person\u2019s\n\nreduced expectation of privacy, the requirement of individualized suspicion was not\n\nentirely eliminated. In Griffin, for instance, the probationer had a reduced expectation of\n\nprivacy because a refusal to permit a home visit to search for weapons was a violation\n\nof the terms of his or her probation, and because possession of a weapon without\n\npermission was a violation of law. Griffin, 483 U.S. at 871. Even given the reduced\n\nexpectation of privacy, however, a relatively high degree of individualized suspicion was\n\nrequired, as the probation officer, before entering the home, had to consider \u201cthe\n\nreliability and specificity of [the informant\u2019s] information, the reliability of the informant\n\n(including whether the informant has any incentive to supply inaccurate information), the\n\nofficer's own experience with the probationer, and the need to verify compliance with\n\nrules of supervision and state and federal law.\u201d Id. (internal quotations omitted).\n\n       A child protection home inspection order like the one at issue here is neither a\n\ndragnet search nor a search of an individual with a reduced expectation of privacy. It is\n\nnot a dragnet-type search because it does not involve home visits of all homes in an\n\narea for a limited purpose as in Camara to inspect wiring. Home visits by DHS are in no\n\nsense \u201croutine and periodic,\u201d but rather must be based upon credible allegations of\n\n\n\n\n                                    [J-39A&B-2021] - 28\n\fevidence of neglect occurring in the specified home. Mother likewise has no reduced\n\nexpectation of privacy in the sanctity of her home based upon any suspicion of potential\n\nwrongdoing (like with, e.g., probationers and paroles), and DHS does not rely on the\n\nGriffin or Samson line of cases. As a result, while home visits in the child neglect\n\ncontext are conducted by civil government officials rather than members of law\n\nenforcement, they do not fit within the two categories of \u201cadministrative searches\u201d\n\nentitled to reduced Fourth Amendment and Article 1, Section 8 protections.\n\n      Moreover, DHS\u2019s entry into Mother\u2019s home cannot remotely be characterized as\n\na \u201cminimally intrusive\u201d spot check. DHS argued in its brief filed with this Court that the\n\ntrial court informed Mother that DHS would only check for working utilities, windows, a\n\nstove, food and beds.     DHS\u2019s Brief at 26.    Although it is hard to fathom how the\n\noperability of windows could be determined without entering every room to determine\n\nthe existence of a window, in its order granting DHS permission to enter Mother\u2019s home,\n\nthe trial court imposed no limitations and provided only that the search would \u201cassess\n\nthe home to verify if mother\u2019s home is safe and appropriate.\u201d Petitions to Compel\n\nCooperation Order, 6/11/2019. The order thus placed no limitations on the scope of the\n\nsearch, leaving it entirely in DHS\u2019s discretion as to the thoroughness of the search,\n\nincluding, if it so chose, a general rummaging of all of the home\u2019s rooms and the\n\nfamily\u2019s belongings.\n\n      In Wyman, a refusal to allow a home inspection would have the limited\n\nconsequence of termination of the conditional governmental financial assistance. In the\n\ncase of any court ordered entry by a child protective service agent, depending upon the\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 29\n\ffindings in the home, the inspection could result in criminal charges for child abuse 17 or\n\nfor any criminal activity discovered during the search. More significantly, the home visit\n\ncould result in the parents\u2019 loss of their children, either temporarily or permanently. The\n\nUnited States Supreme Court has held that natural parents have a fundamental liberty\n\ninterest in the \u201ccare, custody, and management\u201d of their children and that a natural\n\nparent's \u201cdesire for and right to the companionship, care, custody, and management of\n\nhis or her children is a [liberty] interest far more precious than any property right.\u201d\n\nSantosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753, 758-59 (1982) (citations omitted). Likewise,\n\nthis Court has affirmed that the right to make decisions concerning the care, custody,\n\nand control of one's children is one of the oldest fundamental liberty interests protected\n\nby due process.     Hiller v. Fausey, 904 A.2d 875, 885 (Pa. 2006) (citing Troxel v.\n\nGranville, 530 U.S. 57, 67 (2000); see also Lassiter v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. of Durham\n\nCty, N.C., 452 U.S. 18, 27 (1981) (observing that \u201ca parent's desire for and right to the\n\ncompanionship, care, custody and management of his or her children is an important\n\ninterest that undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing\n\ninterest, protection\u201d). Accordingly, while state agencies have an interest in investigating\n\ncredible allegations of child neglect, nothing short of probable cause, guided by the\n\ntraditional principles that govern its federal and state constitutional limitations, will\n\n\n\n\n17  Child neglect could in some cases result in criminal charges. The CPSL defines\n\u201cchild abuse\u201d to include intentionally, knowingly or recklessly \u201c[c]ausing serious physical\nneglect of a child.\u201d 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303. In turn, \u201cserious physical neglect\u201d can include\nthe \u201cfailure to provide a child with adequate essentials of life, including food, shelter or\nmedical care.\u201d Id. If CPS makes a finding of abuse, they can initiate the proceedings to\ntake a child into protective custody. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6315(a)(4).\n\n\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 30\n\fsuffice when a trial court makes a determination as to whether or not to authorize a\n\nhome visit.\n\n      The trial court and Superior Court here both cited the Beck Concurrence for the\n\nproposition that \u201c[w]hat constitutes probable cause in the child protective arena is far\n\ndifferent from what constitutes probable cause in the criminal law[,]\u201d Petition to Compel\n\nCooperation, 875 A.2d at 380 (Beck, J., concurring), and that as a result a distinct or\n\nlesser standard of probable cause is sufficient for a home inspection in a child neglect\n\ninvestigation. In Petition to Compel, the Susquehanna County Services for Children\n\nand Youth (\u201cC & Y\u201d) filed a petition to compel cooperation to permit a caseworker to\n\nmake a home visit of the family residence as part of a child abuse investigation. In its\n\npetition, C & Y averred that it had received a referral of possible child abuse at the\n\nresidence and that the parents had refused to allow the visit. The trial court, without\n\nconducting a hearing, signed an order directing the parents to comply with a home visit,\n\nand subsequently denied their motion for a temporary stay \u2013 stating in his order that 55\n\nPa. Code \u00a7 3490.55(i) provides that a home visit is mandatory.\n\n      Parents filed a notice of appeal, arguing that, inter alia, the order was\n\nunsupported by probable cause and therefore violated their state and federal\n\nconstitutional rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. The majority opinion,\n\nauthored by then-Judge Kate Ford Elliott, unanimously held first that 55 Pa. Code \u00a7\n\n3490.55(i), despite its mandatory requirement of a home visit, was subject to the limits\n\nof Fourth Amendment and Article I, Section 8 jurisprudence. In so holding, the majority\n\ndecision rejected C & Y\u2019s contention that Section 3490.55(i) may be enforced without\n\nregard to constitutional limitations on entry into a private residence. Petition to Compel\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 31\n\fCooperation, 875 A.2d at 374. To the contrary, the court, relying in substantial part on\n\nthe Third Circuit\u2019s decision in Good discussed earlier, held that a request for a home\n\nvisit could be enforced only upon a showing of probable cause or an exception thereto\n\n(e.g., exigency).   The court likewise rejected C & Y\u2019s contention, based upon the\n\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision in Wyman, that because social workers played an important\n\nrole in protecting children, constitutional protections did not apply to them.\n\n              To accept the defendants\u2019 claims about the reach of Wyman\n              would give the state unfettered and absolute authority to\n              enter private homes and disrupt the tranquility of family life\n              on nothing more than an anonymous rumor that something\n              might be amiss.\n\n              Despite the defendants' exaggerated view of their powers,\n              the Fourth Amendment applies to them, as it does to all\n              other officers and agents of the state whose requests to\n              enter, however benign or well-intentioned, are met by a\n              closed door. There is, the defendants' understanding and\n              assertions to the contrary notwithstanding, no social worker\n              exception to the strictures of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nId. at 376 (quoting Walsh, 240 F. Supp. 2d 731, 746-47 (citations omitted)).\n\n       Having rejected C & Y\u2019s contention that no showing of probable cause was\n\nrequired before the trial court could order a home visit, the panel in Petition to Compel\n\nCooperation easily concluded that in its petition C & Y had not presented sufficient facts\n\nto establish probable cause in its petition. The petition was based solely on C & Y\u2019s\n\nbelief that a home inspection was statutorily mandated. The petition cited only to a\n\nChildline referral for possible \u201cmedical neglect,\u201d with no explanation or description of the\n\nalleged neglect. It did not contend that an emergency situation existed or that the\n\nchild\u2019s life was in imminent danger. Id. at 378. There were no allegations supporting a\n\nnexus between the family home and the factual allegations of child abuse (i.e., \u201cmedical\n\n\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 32\n\fneglect\u201d). Id. In the absence of probable cause, the court reversed the trial court\u2019s\n\norder permitting entry into the family home.\n\n       The Beck Concurrence was joined by the two other members of the panel.\n\nDespite unanimous acceptance, the Beck Concurrence was dicta, as its discussion of\n\nthe probable cause standard was entirely irrelevant to the disposition of the case where\n\nthere were no allegations to support probable cause because the agency did not believe\n\nthat any were necessary given the statutory mandate. Moreover, aside from saying the\n\nstandard is different when a child protective services home inspection is at issue rather\n\nthan a criminal investigation, it does not explain how that is so. The Beck Concurrence\n\ninstead more generally provides that \u201c[s]ocial services agencies should be held\n\naccountable for presenting sufficient reasons to warrant a home visit.\u201d         Petition to\n\nCompel Cooperation, 875 A.2d at 380 (Beck, J., concurring).\n\n       Contrary to DHS and the lower courts here, we do not read the Beck\n\nConcurrence to advocate for a lesser standard of proof, or a lesser quantum of\n\nevidence, to establish probable cause in the child neglect context. After all, the court in\n\nPetition to Compel Cooperation (including Judge Beck) reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of\n\nauthority to enter the family home based upon a lack of evidence to demonstrate\n\nprobable cause and criticized C & Y for its \u201cexaggerated view\u201d of its powers to do so\n\nwithout first satisfying constitutional requirements. In context, the Beck Concurrence\n\nmerely recognizes that because the context of a child service home inspection is\n\ndifferent from a criminal investigation, the facts supporting probable cause to enter the\n\nhome will likewise be different.\n\n\n\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 33\n\f       We agree that the evidence necessary to establish probable cause in the child\n\nneglect context will sometimes be \u201cdifferent\u201d than is typically presented in a criminal\n\ncase. For example, a disinterested magistrate in an application for a criminal search\n\nwarrant cannot consider prior knowledge of the subject of the search. In contrast, as\n\ndiscussed later at page 43 note 19, in a child protective service petition to compel a\n\nhome visit, the judge presented with the petition oftentimes, by design, may have been\n\nassigned continuing oversight over matters involving the family whose home is the\n\nsubject of the inspection. The judge\u2019s prior knowledge of the family circumstances will\n\nbe part of the probable cause analysis. But what is not \u201cdifferent\u201d is that the evidence\n\nnecessary to establish probable cause in both settings must be evaluated pursuant to\n\ncertain basic principles developed primarily in search and seizure jurisprudence (given\n\nthe abundance of caselaw in this area) \u2013 including the existence of a nexus between the\n\nareas to be searched and the suspected wrongdoing at issue, an assessment of the\n\nveracity and reliability of anonymous sources of evidence, and consideration of the age\n\nof the facts in relation to the facts presented to establish probable cause.           These\n\nfundamental principles are critical to ensure that a court\u2019s finding of probable cause is\n\nfirmly rooted in facts that that support a constitutional intrusion into a private home.\n\n       We expressly hold that there is no \u201csocial worker exception\u201d to compliance with\n\nconstitutional limitations on an entry into a home without consent or exigent\n\ncircumstances. 18 While most often applied with respect to the police, the United States\n\n\n\n\n18 Our holding is in agreement with the binding panel decision in Petition to Compel\nCooperation, 875 A.2d at 375-76.\n\n(Continued\u2026)\n\n                                    [J-39A&B-2021] - 34\n\fSupreme Court has ruled that \u201c[t]he basic purpose of [the Fourth] Amendment ... is to\n\nsafeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by\n\ngovernmental officials.\u201d New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 335 (1985) (emphasis\n\nadded). As a result, the Fourth Amendment applies equally whether the government\n\nofficial is a police officer conducting a criminal investigation or a caseworker conducting\n\na civil child welfare investigation. Dubbs v. Head Start, Inc., 336 F.3d 1194, 1205 (10th\n\nCir. 2003) (\u201c[T]he defendants\u2019 contention that the Fourth Amendment does not apply in\n\nthe \u2018noncriminal\u2019 and \u2018noninvestigatory\u2019 context is without foundation.\u201d).\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\nThe Concurring and Dissenting Opinion insists that it does not favor implementation of a\n\u201csocial workers exception\u201d to permit DHS caseworkers to obtain home visit orders\nwithout a showing of probable cause. Concurring and Dissenting Op. (Dougherty, J.) at\n6. Other than to describe the type of evidence that is not required to establish probable\ncause in the child welfare context (i.e., the type or quantum of evidence necessary in\nthe criminal context), the Concurring and Dissenting Opinion does not identify what type\nor quantum of evidence is required to establish probable case in the child welfare\nmilieu. The Concurring and Dissenting Opinion references the \u201cindividualized and fact-\nsensitive civil administration\u201d of the CPSL, id. at 7. but offers no indication of any\nevidence of individualized suspicion or fact-sensitive information\u201d actually discovered or\ndeveloped by DHS in this case. Likewise, the Concurring and Dissenting Opinion\nindicates that in accordance with its \u201crisk assessment model,\u201d DHS must have \u201csome\ndiscretion in translating the information supplied by a reporter, along with any other\ninformation revealed through its own screening and assessment processes, into risk\nassessment categories such as \u2019homelessness\u2019 and \u2018inadequate basic care.\u2019 \u201c Id.at 13.\nAs presented in this case, such \u201cdiscretion,\u201d however, is not really discretion at all, but\nrather a license to translate simple allegations of an unidentified reporter (without any\ncorroboration whatsoever) into serious contentions that might threaten the removal of\nthe children from the home. At the evidentiary hearing, caseworker Richardson\ntranslated a contention that the family slept outside of the Philadelphia Housing\nAuthority as part of Mother\u2019s protesting activities into a claim that the family was\nhomeless. Likewise, an apparent observation by the unidentified reporter that he or she\nhad not seen Mother feed one of the children during an eight-hour period mushroomed\ninto a serious contention of neglect, not just on the night in question (again, during\nMother\u2019s protesting activities) but also in the family home necessitating a DHS home\nvisit. This bald translation of the information provided by the reporter in the guise of\nevidence presented at the hearing cannot, under any type or quantum of evidence,\nestablish probable cause.\n\n\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 35\n\f       We thus join the vast majority of other federal and state courts in explicitly\n\nrecognizing that the Fourth Amendment (and our own Article I, Section 8) applies to\n\nsearches conducted in civil child neglect proceedings, which have the same potential for\n\nunreasonable government intrusion into the sanctity of the home.

The Absence of Probable Cause in the Present Case\n\n       In criminal matters, when presented with an application for a search warrant, the\n\nissuing authority considers only the information contained in the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the\n\napplication and the supporting affidavit. Commonwealth v. Housman, 986 A.2d 822,\n\n843 (Pa. 2009); Pa.R.Crim.P. 203(B). In contrast, here both the trial court and the\n\nSuperior Court also took into consideration the testimony presented at the evidentiary\n\nhearing on the Petitions to Compel. We take no issue with this approach in connection\n\n\n\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 36\n\fwith efforts to establish probable cause to compel a home visit as long as the testimony\n\nis cabined by the allegations in the petition.      We note that the CPSL contains no\n\nprovision requiring the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing in connection with\n\nthe filing of a petition to compel cooperation with a home visit in a proceeding initiated\n\nby the filing of a GPS report.     At its discretion, the trial court may either hold an\n\nevidentiary hearing or issue a ruling on the averments of fact set forth in the petition to\n\ncompel. In either case, a probable cause finding must be supported by the allegations\n\nin the petition and supporting testimony, if any.\n\n       In this regard, we note that the two dissenting opinions both disagree that the\n\nevidence at the hearing must be limited to the averments set forth in the Petitions to\n\nCompel, and even take no issue with DHS\u2019s decision to amend the content of the\n\nPetitions to Compel by presenting testimony in direct contradiction to the allegations\n\nthat it had set forth in those Petitions to Compel. Concurring and Dissenting Opinion\n\n(Dougherty, J.) at 12-13; Dissenting Opinion (Mundy, J.) at 4. We disagree, as parents,\n\nin order to protect the sanctity of their homes, are entitled, at a minimum, to the basic\n\ntenets of due process, which include, fundamentally, the key principles underpinning\n\ndue process \u2013 notice and an opportunity to be heard. Pa. Bankers Ass\u2019n v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of\n\nBanking, 956 A.2d 956, 965 (Pa. 2008). DHS may not, consistent with the fundamental\n\nprinciples of due process, set forth its allegations of alleged wrongdoing in a verified\n\npetition to compel a home visit, but then at the evidentiary hearing on the petition\n\npresent entirely contrary evidence. The Petitions to Compel in this case were verified\n\nby a representative of DHS, but as both of the dissenting opinions acknowledge, DHS\u2019s\n\nsole witness (caseworker Richardson) took the stand and disavowed key evidence in\n\n\n\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 37\n\fthe Petitions to Compel regarding the family\u2019s alleged homelessness (namely that she\n\nsaw Mother and her children enter the home).         Concurring and Dissenting Opinion\n\n(Dougherty, J.) at 12-13; Dissenting Opinion (Mundy, J.) at .4 What had not been an\n\nissue even mentioned in the Petitions to Compel (homelessness) suddenly became a\n\nsignificant issue, at least in the eyes of the trial court. The Petitions to Compel thus not\n\nonly failed to provide Mother with notice of an important issue, but also misled her with\n\nregard to the evidence that DHS intended to introduce at the evidentiary hearing. If\n\nMother had been on notice of a need to prove that her family lived in the home, she\n\ncould have introduced any of numerous forms of proof (e.g., recent bills, rental or\n\nmortgage documents, etc.) The trial court ordered the home visit, at least in part, to\n\ndetermine whether DHS's allegation of homelessness \"had merit.\u201d Trial Court Opinion,\n\n9/9/2019, at 7 Adequate notice for due process purposes includes the \u201cright to notice of\n\nthe issues and an opportunity to offer evidence in furtherance of such issues.\u201d Id. at\n\n965. When the allegations of wrongdoing and the evidence to support them may be\n\nchanged during the course of the hearing itself, parents have little or no opportunity\n\neither to prepare or respond to any contentions of alleged neglect directed against\n\nthem.\n\n        As recounted above, DHS\u2019s involvement in this case began with an anonymous\n\nGPS report.    At the hearing, caseworker Richardson testified that the GPS report\n\ncontained allegations of \u201chomelessness and inadequate basic care\u201d of Mother\u2019s\n\nchildren. N.T., 6/11/2019, at 5. The Petitions to Compel do not state that Mother was\n\nhomeless, but rather only that on one occasion three weeks prior to the filing of the GPS\n\nreport Mother and her family had been seen sleeping outside of the Philadelphia\n\n\n\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 38\n\fHousing Authority and on a more recent occasion Mother had been observed protesting\n\noutside of the Philadelphia Housing Authority from noon until eight in the evening. See\n\nPetitions to Compel, 5/31/2019, \u00b6 J. The Petitions to Compel likewise do not describe\n\nany generalized \u201cinadequate basic care,\u201d but rather allege only that during the eight\n\nhours she was protesting at the Philadelphia Housing Authority on May 21, 2019, it was\n\n\u201cunknown\u201d whether she had fed her children. Id.\n\n      To the extent that the contention that the family slept outside of the Philadelphia\n\nHousing Authority on one occasion could be construed as evidence of homelessness\n\n(rather than just part of her protesting activities), DHS disproved this contention during\n\nits limited investigation. First, the anonymous source of the GPS report provided DHS\n\nwith the family\u2019s address, and DHS then promptly sent a representative of Project Home\n\nto approach Mother. Mother informed the representative of her protesting activities at\n\nthe Philadelphia Housing Authority but denied that she or her family was homeless.\n\nCaseworker Richardson then verified Mother\u2019s address in DHS\u2019s files and proceeded to\n\nthe residence, where she confronted Father and later observed the arrival of Mother\n\nand the children. Id. \u00b6 L. Caseworker Richardson left but returned later in the day,\n\nwhen she again found Mother and Father at the home. Having located the family\u2019s\n\nhome and repeatedly finding Mother and Father there, any allegation of homelessness\n\nwas rendered moot. If all of this was not sufficient evidence of a lack of homelessness,\n\nby the end of the evidentiary hearing DHS unmistakably confirmed that it no longer\n\nconsidered the family to be homeless, as it requested an order to conduct a home visit\n\nat the very house where caseworker Richardson had visited twice on the day in\n\nquestion.\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 39\n\f       At that juncture, the only remaining allegation in the Petitions to Compel was that\n\nthe anonymous reporter had not observed Mother feed one of the children on a single\n\nday for approximately eight hours.       The DHS caseworker\u2019s characterization of this\n\nallegation as \u201cinadequate basic care\u201d was hyperbole. At the hearing, DHS did not offer\n\nany evidence to corroborate this specific allegation or of any other instance of current\n\nneglect of the children of any kind that it discovered in its investigation prior to filing the\n\nPetitions to Compel.\n\n       Without reference to the claims in the Petitions to Compel, or recognition of the\n\nlack of evidence to support them, the trial court questioned Mother regarding the status\n\nof the utility service to the home, the presence of food in the home, whether there was\n\nadequate bedding and clothing, whether the children had treating physicians and\n\ndentist, and whether Mother was employed. See N.T., 6/11/2019, at 12-14. Although\n\nMother answered these questions appropriately by denying any general neglect of her\n\nchildren (and without any allegation or evidence to the contrary), the trial court\n\nnevertheless concluded that the evidence presented formed the basis for a finding of\n\nprobable cause to grant DHS a home visit:\n\n              The Motion to Compel and the hearing confirmed that one of\n              the main factors of the DHS investigation is the matter of\n              homelessness and if the alleged address of the family was\n              suitable for Children. The home assessment by DHS would\n              be able to determine the claims for both homelessness and\n              inadequate care of Children have merit. The trial court\n              determined that the Motion to Compel provided probable\n              cause to complete the assessment of the family home.\n\nTrial Court Opinion 9/9/2019, at 7-8.\n\n       This analysis reveals a decision and fact-finding untethered to the allegations or\n\nevidence before the trial court. Richardson\u2019s testimony confirmed that the family was\n\n\n\n                                    [J-39A&B-2021] - 40\n\fnot homeless, 19 and there were no allegations in the Petitions to Compel, and no\n\nevidence presented at the hearing, to substantiate any issues with the children\u2019s health\n\nor that the home was lacking in any respect. We reiterate: the only potentially viable\n\nallegation of any current or ongoing neglect before the trial court at the hearing on the\n\nPetitions to Compel was an anonymous report of a possible failure to feed one of the\n\nchildren for a portion of one day. DHS offered no evidence to corroborate this allegation\n\nor to support the more general contention that the children were malnourished or\n\notherwise not regularly being fed. Without any evidence to substantiate the allegations\n\nof neglect of the children, no probable cause existed to order DHS to conduct a home\n\nvisit.\n\n         To the extent that the trial court was suspicious that the home conditions of prior\n\nyears could possibly have returned despite the lack of evidence to even support a\n\nsuspicion, this was a fundamental error. Respectfully, reasoning of this sort appears to\n\nrest on an unsupportable presumption that once neglectful parents will always be\n\ndeficient in the care of their children. Mother and Father had resolved the home-related\n\nissues in prior years, resulting in DHS lifting Y.W.-B.\u2019s protective supervision in 2015.\n\nAt the time of the events at issue here, there was no evidence of any reoccurrence of\n\nthose prior shortfalls. While it was not inappropriate for the trial judge to view any\n\ncurrent allegations through the prism of prior experiences with the family, it was entirely\n\n\n\n\n19 The Dissenting Opinion contends that as \u201cthe allegations of homelessness remained\nan issue, along with the allegations of inadequate basic care, there was a clear\nconnection between the allegations in the petition and the requested investigative home\nvisit.\u201d Dissenting Opinion (Mundy, J.) at 6. For all of the reasons set forth here, we\nrespectfully disagree that the record supports such a contention.\n\n\n\n                                    [J-39A&B-2021] - 41\n\finappropriate to order a home visit based solely on prior events without any evidence of\n\na reoccurrence.\n\n      As a reviewing court, the Superior Court\u2019s inquiry was limited to determining\n\nwhether there was a substantial basis in the record for the trial court to find probable\n\ncause. Jacoby, 170 A.3d at 1082. As we outlined in connection with the trial court\u2019s\n\nruling, the paucity of evidence offered in this proceeding does not provide a substantial\n\nbasis for a finding of probable cause. The Superior Court erred in reaching a contrary\n\nconclusion.\n\n              The averments in DHS's petition, supported by evidence at\n              the hearing, corroborated the initial report that Mother was\n              outside the [Philadelphia Housing Authority] office and the\n              allegation that there was a fire at Mother's current residence.\n              Although Mother asserted her previous residence was\n              damaged by fire, the trial court was under no obligation to\n              credit Mother's alleged explanation, particularly since DHS\n              workers ultimately observed at least some damage to\n              Mother's current residence, namely the boarded-up window,\n              which was consistent with damage from a fire.

See D.R., 216 A.3d at\n\n\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 42\n\f             295. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's conclusion that\n             that there was a fair probability that Children could have\n             been in need of services, and that evidence relating to the\n             need for services could have been found inside the home.\n\nIn Interest of Y.W.-B, 241 A.3d at 390.\n\n      The Superior Court\u2019s probable cause analysis fails in several respects. First,\n\nwhile the court indicated that there was a \u201clink\u201d between the allegations and DHS's\n\npetition to enter the home, it did not explain what that link was between the home\n\ninspection and the allegation that Mother may have failed to feed one of the children for\n\neight hours. To establish probable cause, there must be a specific \u201cnexus between the\n\nitems to be [searched] and the suspected crime committed[.]\u201d           Commonwealth v.\n\nJohnson, 240 A.3d 575, 587 (Pa. 2020) (plurality) (quoting Commonwealth v. Butler,\n\n291 A.2d 89, 90 (Pa. 1972)); see also Commonwealth. v. Kline, 335 A.2d 361, 364 (Pa.\n\nSuper. 1975) (\u201cProbable cause to believe that a man has committed a crime on the\n\nstreet does not necessarily give rise to probable cause to search his home.\u201d). In the\n\ncase that the Superior Court cited to support the necessity of a nexus, In Interest of\n\nD.R., 216 A.3d 286 (Pa. Super 2019), affirmed, 232 A.3d 547 (Pa. 2020), 20 the Fayette\n\nCounty child protective services agency filed a motion seeking to compel cooperation\n\nwith a home inspection, alleging that it had received three reports of incidents in which a\n\nfather was observed to be under the influence of an unspecified substance, and that\n\nduring one of those instances, he was in the company of one of his five children. The\n\n\n20  This Court\u2019s review was limited to addressing the agency\u2019s authority to compel a\nparent to submit to an observed urine sample for analysis as part of its investigation. In\nInterest of D.R., 232 A.3d at 558. We affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s ruling that under the\nunambiguous provisions of the CPSL, the agency lacked any such authority. Id. at 559.\nWe did not grant allocatur to consider the issues raised in the current appeal.\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 43\n\fSuperior Court reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of the motion, concluding, inter alia, that\n\nthe agency had wholly failed to allege a connection between the alleged misconduct\n\nand the family\u2019s home. Id. at 294-95 (\u201c[C]ritically, Fayette CYS did not allege a link\n\nbetween the alleged abuse/neglect and the parents\u2019 home.\u201d).\n\n      Based upon our review of the record, no nexus existed between the allegations\n\nin the Petitions to Compel and Mother\u2019s home. The Petitions to Compel state that\n\nduring an eight-hour period, while protesting before the Philadelphia Housing Authority,\n\nit was \u201cunknown\u201d whether Mother fed her child who was with her. This allegation has no\n\nconnection whatsoever to the family\u2019s home. Even assuming a lack of food in the home\n\non the day of the inspection, that would not be evidence to support the contention that\n\nMother failed to feed one of her children during her eight-hour protest on May 21, 2019\n\nin front of the Philadelphia Housing Authority. We reiterate that there was no evidence,\n\nor even an allegation, that the children exhibited signs of malnourishment or even that\n\nDHS uncovered other days in which the children appeared to go without food.\n\n      Second, the Superior Court also erred in considering Mother\u2019s prior experiences\n\nwith DHS in its probable cause analysis because the trial court placed no express\n\nreliance on it. Y.W.-B\u2019s dependency ended in 2015 when DHS ceased its protective\n\nsupervision and discharged the dependency matter.         The GPS report contained no\n\nallegations that any of the prior deficiencies in the home (e.g., flea infestation, lack of\n\ninterior walls) had reoccurred or was currently occurring. The current child protective\n\nservices investigation is not a continuation of the prior proceeding, but rather is wholly\n\nunrelated to the prior proceeding that DHS itself terminated in 2015 after concluding that\n\nthe then-existing issues with the family home had been satisfactorily rectified. The fact\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 44\n\fthat Mother earned the discharge of the dependency petition four years prior to this\n\nproceeding, with no proof of any intervening episodes, made the prior experience totally\n\nirrelevant. 21\n\n        Moreover, according to the Petitions to Compel, the current allegations against\n\nMother were related solely to her presence near the Philadelphia Housing Authority and\n\nnot to any conditions existing inside her current residence.        Again, Mother\u2019s prior\n\nexperiences with DHS that ended in 2015 were four years old and there was no\n\nevidence of any reoccurrence of prior problems.         They were therefore stale and\n\nprovided no evidentiary basis to establish probable cause to enter the home. Stale\n\nevidence may not be used to establish the probable cause to issue a search warrant;\n\ninstead, the conclusion that probable cause exists must be \u201cbased on facts which are\n\nclosely related in time to the date the warrant is issued.\u201d Commonwealth v. Jones, 484\n\nA.2d 1383, 1389 (Pa. 1984) (Zappala, J., dissenting). \u201cIf too old, the information is\n\nstale, and probable cause may no longer exist.\u201d Commonwealth v. Leed, 186 A.3d 405,\n\n21  Although not discussed in the proceedings in this case, we recognize that the trial\njudge who issued the order in question presided over the 2013 dependency matter for\none year prior to its termination. As such, he was aware of the discharge of that petition\nand the fact that the conditions giving rise to those proceedings has been ameliorated\nwell in advance of the current matter. In addition, the same trial judge granted a petition\nto compel an inspection of Mother\u2019s home in 2016 and the petition was discharged the\nday after the inspection. See supra note 4. This interaction between Mother and the\nagency was not contained in the current petitions to compel or referenced in the\nproceedings in this case.\nIn many counties, repeat incidents involving child welfare are assigned to the same\njudge for purposes of continuity with the family. When a petition to compel compliance\nwith a home inspection is presented to a judge with prior case involvement with the\nparents, the judge will be making a probable cause determination with knowledge of the\nprevious proceedings and dispositions. To the extent relevant, the judge may take into\naccount these prior encounters. Here, in issuing the order, the trial judge did not invoke\nreliance of Mother\u2019s history in his courtroom.\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 45\n\f413 (Pa. 2018); In re Smith Children, 891 N.Y.S.2d 628, 635 (N.Y. Fam. Ct. 2009)\n\n(\u201c[W]hile the statute requires the court to consider the child protective or criminal history\n\nof a family, such history cannot be proffered as the sole basis for seeking a pre-petition\n\norder to gain entry into their home in connection with a new investigation commenced\n\nby an anonymous report \u2026 three years later.\u201d); see also Commonwealth v. Tolbert, 424\n\nA.2d 1342, 1344 (Pa. 1981) (\u201cIf the issuing officer is presented with evidence of criminal\n\nactivity at some prior time, this will not support a finding of probable cause as of the\n\ndate the warrant issues, unless it is also shown that the criminal activity continued up to\n\nor about that time\u201d.).\n\n       Next, the Superior Court failed to address the reliability of the information\n\ncontained in the Petitions to Compel, which were provided exclusively by the\n\nunidentified source that filed the GPS report.         DHS offered no evidence at the\n\nevidentiary hearing to establish the credibility and reliability of the source or to\n\ncorroborate any of the information provided by the source. This Court has ruled that\n\nwhere probable cause is \u201calmost entirely based on information gleaned from\n\nanonymous sources \u2026 [and] there is no attempt made to establish either the basis of\n\nknowledge of the anonymous sources or their general veracity, a strong showing of the\n\nreliability of the information that they have relayed\u201d is required to support a finding of\n\nprobable cause.

Children\n\nand Youth Servs., 103 F.3d 1123, 1127 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding that in connection with\n\nsearches in the child protective services context, \u201c[the investigator] was not \u2026 entitled\n\nto rely on the unknown credibility of an anonymous informant unless she could\n\ncorroborate the information through other sources which would have reduced the\n\nchance that the informant was recklessly relating incorrect information or had purposely\n\ndistorted information.\u201d); In re Smith Children, 891 N.Y.S.2d. at 634 (\u201cIn the absence of\n\nother reliable information, this Court finds that an anonymous SCR report alone is\n\ninsufficient to establish \u2018probable cause\u2019 for the issuance of an order of entry in a child\n\nprotective investigation[.]\u201d).\n\n       In the present case, the identity of the individual who provided the allegations of\n\nneglect summarized in the Petitions to Compel was never identified and did not testify at\n\nthe evidentiary hearing. The failure to testify was significant in at least four respects.\n\nFirst, there was no evidence to corroborate the anonymous report.             In fact, the\n\nconjecture as to homelessness was specifically rebutted by Mother to the Project Home\n\nrepresentative and by DHS\u2019s own investigation and its request for an order to enter the\n\nsame home that Caseworker Richardson twice visited. Second, the trial court lacked\n\nany opportunity to observe the individual\u2019s testimony to assess his or her credibility.\n\nThird, Mother had no opportunity to provide support for her contention that the GPS\n\nreport had been filed in retaliation for her protests of the policies of the Philadelphia\n\nHousing Authority, which she could have done if, for example, the source of the GPS\n\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 47\n\freport had any affiliation with that governmental body. Fourth, the lack of testimony left\n\nunclear the foundation for the statement in the Petitions to Compel that it was\n\n\u201cunknown\u201d whether Mother fed her children during the time she was protesting. Did the\n\nsource observe Mother continually throughout the eight hours of protest on May 21st\n\nwithout seeing Mother provide food to the child? 22 Or, conversely, did the source of this\n\nallegation observe Mother with child only sporadically during the eight hour period, such\n\nthat Mother could have fed the child on many (unobserved) occasions throughout that\n\ntime period?\n\n       Finally, and significantly, DHS had no obligation to keep the identity of the source\n\nof the GPS report confidential or to shield him or her from testifying at the evidentiary\n\nhearing. The trial court mistakenly believed that DHS was legally required to keep the\n\nname of the anonymous source confidential and, accordingly, citing 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n\n6340(c), sustained DHS\u2019s objections when Mother\u2019s counsel asked Richardson to\n\nidentify the anonymous source of the GPS report. Trial Court Opinion, 9/9/2019, at 8.\n\nSection 6340(c) of the CPSL, however, only requires DHS to keep confidential the\n\nname of an anonymous reporter of a CPS report, i.e., a report alleging child abuse. 23\n\nPa.C.S. \u00a7 6340(c). No similar provision in the CPSL protects the source of a GPS\n\nreport, i.e., a report of, inter alia, child neglect. 23\n\n\n22 Mother has consistently denied that she had either of her children with her during her\nprotests on May 21st, a contention contradicted only by the anonymous source of the\nGPS report.\n23  The Concurring and Dissenting Opinion disagrees with this statutory analysis on the\ngrounds that there is some overlap in the definitions of \u201cchild abuse\u201d and \u201cchild neglect.\u201d\nConcurring and Dissenting Opinion (Dougherty, J.), at 10. While there is some overlap,\nit is minimal and clearly not implicated in this case. The definition of \u201cchild abuse\u201d\nincludes, inter alia, \u201c[s]erious physical neglect by a perpetrator constituting prolonged or\n(Continued\u2026)\n\n                                       [J-39A&B-2021] - 48\n\f      Our General Assembly has drawn a clear distinction between an individual who\n\nmakes an anonymous report of child abuse as opposed to one of child neglect \u2013 DHS\n\nmust guard the confidentiality of an individual making allegations of child abuse in a\n\nCPS report, but has no similar obligations in cases involving GPS reports alleging child\n\nneglect. While DHS could have called the source of the GPS report in this case to\n\nprovide testimony to corroborate the claims against Mother, it chose not to do so and,\n\naccordingly, the allegations set forth in the Petitions to Compel, based solely on this\n\nsingle uncorroborated anonymous source, were insufficient to establish probable cause\n\nto justify entry into Mother\u2019s home. See, e.g., Torres, 764 A.2d at 540.\n\n      In its probable cause analysis, the Superior Court placed heavy weight on\n\nMother\u2019s perceived demeanor at the evidentiary hearing. While her demeanor may well\n\nhave had some effect on the trial court\u2019s evaluation of her credibility, we are aware of no\n\nlegal authority to support the proposition that the demeanor of a witness, without more,\n\nconstitutes a basis for a finding of probable cause to permit entry into that individual\u2019s\n\nhome. In this regard, and without condoning disrespect for the court or the proceeding,\n\nwe note that Mother\u2019s demeanor may well have been, in whole or in part, a reflection of\n\n\n\n\n(\u2026continued)\nrepeated lack of supervision or the failure to provide the essentials of life, including\nadequate medical care, which endangers a child's life or development or impairs the\nchild's functioning. \u201d 55 Pa. Code \u00a7 3490.4. The alleged child neglect in this case,\ninvolving an uncorroborated allegation of a single instance of potentially failing to feed\none of the children for one eight hour period is not the type of serious prolonged and\nrepeated physical neglect necessary to constitute child abuse under the definition of\nthat term in 55 Pa. Code \u00a7 3490.4. In the overlap case hypothesized by the Concurring\nand Dissenting Opinion, the trial court judge would make the call on the appropriate\ncategorization and treat the identity of the reporter accordingly. Here however, we\napply the CPSL to the case before us.\n\n\n\n                                  [J-39A&B-2021] - 49\n\fher frustration based on her view that the entire episode was in retaliation for her\n\nprotesting activities.\n\n         The Superior Court\u2019s reference to fire damage in Mother\u2019s current home in its\n\nprobable cause analysis is dehors the record in this case. The trial court made no\n\nfinding of fact that Mother\u2019s current home had suffered any fire damage. While the\n\nPetitions to Compel did indicate that Mother had advised the Project Home worker that\n\na fire had destroyed a prior residence, the trial court did not, based upon a boarded\n\nwindow or otherwise, conclude that the present home had suffered fire damage. 24 Fire\n\ndamage in the current home was not even mentioned at the evidentiary hearing or in\n\nthe trial court\u2019s subsequent Rule 1925(a) written opinion. In short, the trial court did not,\n\nas did the Superior Court, take the leap from the existence of a boarded window to fire\n\ndamage inside the home in the absence of any evidence in support.\n\n         For these reasons, Mother\u2019s constitutional rights were violated.        The order\n\ncompelling her cooperation with a governmental intrusion into her home was deficient\n\nfor want of probable cause. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court.\n\n         Order reversed.\n\n         Chief Justice Baer and Justices Saylor and Wecht join the opinion.\n\n         Justice Dougherty files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which Justice Todd\n\njoins.\n\n24  It is not clear how the trial court could have made such a finding of fact. The\nSuperior Court rightly notes that the trial court had no obligation to find Mother\u2019s\ntestimony regarding a fire at a previous home to be credible. In Interest of Y.W.-B., 241\nA.3d at 390. The result, however, would merely be to disbelieve that the previous home\nhad been destroyed by fire. Absent any evidence that a fire had damaged Mother\u2019s\ncurrent home, her testimony regarding her prior home could not be \u201ctransferred\u201d to her\ncurrent home.\n\n\n\n                                   [J-39A&B-2021] - 50\n\fJustice Mundy files a dissenting opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                           [J-39A&B-2021] - 51\n\f",
