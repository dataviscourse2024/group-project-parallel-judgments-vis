Pelayo in cause 0919128D); $500,000 (capital murder for hire of Cecil and\n Geraldine Lancaster\n by employing E. Harris in cause 0919129D); and $250,000 (conspiracy to commit the murder of Cecil Lancaster\n in cause 0919139D). \u00a0Appellant challenged the amount of the bonds at a habeas corpus hearing. \u00a0\n\nAt the hearing, appellant\u2019s sister, Judy Davis, testified on his behalf. \u00a0Davis testified that appellant was in poor health and suffered from a tail bone injury, high blood pressure and an erratic heartbeat. \u00a0She stated that appellant lives in Hobbs, New Mexico and works as a truck driver for her husband\u2019s business. \u00a0Appellant did not have the money to pay the current bonds himself, nor would he be able to pay a reduced bond. \u00a0Davis and her husband could post the bonds if they were reduced to $10,000 in each case. \u00a0The trial court denied bail reduction in all cases. \u00a0Appellant remains confined in the Tarrant County Jail pending this appeal.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\u201c\u2018Bail\u2019 is the security given by the accused that he will appear and answer before the proper court the accusation brought against him, and includes a bail bond or a personal bond.\u201d \u00a0\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann\n. art. 17.01 (Vernon 1977). \u00a0\u201cA \u2018bail bond\u2019 is a written undertaking entered into by the defendant and his sureties for the appearance of the principal therein before some court or magistrate to answer a criminal accusation.\u201d \u00a0\nId. \nart. 17.02. \u00a0Article 17.15 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides a statutory framework for setting a defendant's bond: \n\n1. \u00a0The bail shall be sufficiently high to give reasonable assurance that the undertaking will be complied with. \n\n2. \u00a0The power to require bail is not to be so used as to make it an instrument of oppression. \n\n3. \u00a0The nature of the offense and the circumstances under which it was committed are to be considered. \n\n4. \u00a0The ability to make bail is to be regarded, and proof may be taken upon this point. \n\n5. \u00a0The future safety of a victim of the alleged offense and the community shall be considered. \n\n\n\nId. \nart. 17.15 (Vernon Supp. 2004). \u00a0\n\nWe review the trial court's denial of a bond reduction request under an abuse of discretion standard. \u00a0\nSee Ex parte Rubac\n, 611 S.W.2d 848, 850 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1981); \nEx parte Brown\n, 959 S.W.2d 369, 372 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 1998, no pet.); \nsee also \nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann\n. art. 17.15 (giving trial court discretion to set amount of bond); \nShort v. State\n, 923 S.W.2d 168, 168-69 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 1996, no pet.) (applying abuse of discretion standard to review of trial court\u2019s decision to deny bail under former code of criminal procedure article\n 44.04(g) (now 44.04(c)). To determine whether a trial court abused its discretion, we must decide whether the trial court acted without reference to any guiding rules or principles; in other words, whether the act was arbitrary or unreasonable. \n Montgomery v. State\n, 810 S.W.2d 372, 380 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990). \u00a0Merely because a trial court may decide a matter within its discretion in a different manner than an appellate court would in a similar circumstance does not demonstrate that an abuse of discretion has occurred. \u00a0\nId.\n \n\nThe primary purpose of an appearance bond is to secure the presence of the defendant at trial on the offense charged. \u00a0\nEx parte Vasquez\n, 558 S.W.2d 477, 479 (Tex. Crim. App. 1977); \nEx parte Scott\n, 122 S.W.3d 866, 868 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2003, no pet.). \u00a0Bail should be set high enough to give reasonable assurance that the defendant will appear at trial, but it should not operate as an instrument of oppression. \u00a0\nScott\n, \n122 S.W.3d 868. \n In a habeas proceeding, appellant bears the burden of proof to show that the bail, as set, is excessive. \u00a0\nRubac\n, 611 S.W.2d at 849. \u00a0\n\nAdditionally, in determining the amount of the bond, the court should also consider factors such as the accused's work record, family ties, length of residency, prior criminal record, conformity with the conditions of any previous bond, the existence of outstanding bonds, and any aggravating circumstances alleged to have been involved in the charged offense. \u00a0\nId.\n at 849-50; \nBrown\n, 959 S.W.2d at 372. \u00a0The accused\u2019s potential sentence and the nature of the crime are also primary factors to be considered. \u00a0\nHughes v. State\n, 843 S.W.2d 236, 237 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14\nth\n Dist.] 1992, no pet.)\n\nNature of the Offense\n\nThe nature of the offense and the circumstances surrounding the offense are significant factors in determining what constitutes reasonable bond. \u00a0\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.\n art. 17.15(3); \nsee Ex parte Davila\n, 623 S.W.2d 408, 410 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1981). \u00a0In considering the nature of the offense, it is proper to consider the possible punishment. \u00a0\nVasquez\n, 558 S.W.2d at 479-80. \u00a0\n\nHere, appellant is charged with four different capital murder offenses and the separate offense of conspiracy to commit murder. \u00a0\nSee \nTex. Penal Code Ann.\n \u00a7 15.02 (Vernon 2003), \u00a7 19.03 (Vernon Supp. 2004). \u00a0Although the circumstances surrounding the offenses were not developed at the habeas hearing, capital murder during the commission of a robbery, capital murder for hire, and conspiracy to commit murder are all violent crimes. \u00a0Capital murder is punishable by death or imprisonment for life.\n \u00a0Id.\n \u00a7 19.03(b). \u00a0When such severe punishment is a possibility, bail must be sufficient to secure the presence of the defendant at trial. \u00a0\nEx parte Hulin\n, 31 S.W.3d 754, 760 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1\nst\n Dist.] 2000, no pet.). \u00a0Given the serious nature of the offenses and the potential for a lengthy sentence, the trial court could properly have concluded that the amounts of the bonds were reasonable. \u00a0\nSee Scott\n, \n122 S.W.3d at 869-70.\n\nAbility to Make Bond\n\nWhen determining the appropriate amount of bond, the trial court may also consider the accused\u2019s ability to make bond. \u00a0\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.\n art. 17.15(4); \nScott\n, \n122 S.W.3d at 870.\n \u00a0At the bond hearing, Davis was the only witness to testify and she testified about appellant\u2019s inability to make bond. \u00a0She stated that she and her husband had the ability to pay a reduced bond on behalf of appellant. \u00a0However, appellant introduced no evidence supporting Davis\u2019s claim that appellant was unable to make the bonds or that he had made any efforts himself to secure any bonds that were denied. \u00a0\n\nThe ability or inability of an accused to make bail does not alone control in determining the amount of bail. \u00a0\nEx parte Branch\n, 553 S.W.2d 380, 382 (Tex. Crim. App. 1977). \u00a0If the ability to make bond in a specified amount controlled, then the role of the trial court in setting bond would be completely eliminated, and the accused would be in the position to determine what his bond should be. \u00a0\nId.\n; \nEx parte Miller\n, 631 S.W.2d 825, 827\n (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 1982, pet. ref\u2019d). \u00a0Because appellant demonstrated no evidence supporting his inability to make bond himself or efforts to secure bond himself, the trial court could properly have concluded that the amounts of the bonds were reasonable under the circumstances.\n \u00a0See Scott\n, \n122 S.W.3d at 870.\n\nCommunity Ties\n\nCourts may also consider an accused's work record, family ties, and length of residency to determine what constitutes reasonable bond. \n Rubac\n, 611 S.W.2d at 849. \u00a0Appellant does not reside in this jurisdiction. \u00a0He is a resident of Hobbs, New Mexico and has lived there for the last twenty-five years. \u00a0Appellant has few ties to the area other than one brother who lives in Rockport, Texas. \u00a0Additionally, appellant\u2019s work as a truck driver causes him to often travel from place to place. \u00a0Based on the lack of evidence regarding appellant's ties to the community, the trial court could have concluded that his community ties were insufficient to assure his appearance at trial. \u00a0\nSee, e.g.,\n \nBrown\n, 959 S.W.2d at 373 (holding that bail of $500,000 for alleged capital murder was not excessive, where defendant faced life imprisonment or death penalty, and defendant did not have any close ties to community to assure his appearance at trial). \u00a0\n\nConclusion\n\nIn light of the serious and violent nature of the alleged crimes, appellant\u2019s failure to attempt to secure the bonds for himself, and the fact that appellant is not a resident of this jurisdiction and has few ties to the community, we hold that the trial court did not act arbitrarily or unreasonably by denying a reduction in the amounts of appellant\u2019s bonds. \u00a0Additionally, appellant has failed to show that the bonds were excessive in relation to the crimes alleged. \u00a0\nSee id.\n \u00a0Because we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s request for bond reduction, we overrule both of appellant\u2019s points and affirm the trial court\u2019s orders denying habeas corpus relief.\n\n\n\nTERRIE LIVINGSTON\n\nJUSTICE\n\n\n\nPANEL A:\tCAYCE, C.J.; LIVINGSTON and WALKER, JJ.\n\n\n\nPUBLISH\n\n\n\nDELIVERED: \u00a0May 27, 2004\n\n\n",
