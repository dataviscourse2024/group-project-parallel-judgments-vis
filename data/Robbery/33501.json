The judgment convicted defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of burglary in the first degree and criminal sexual act in the first degree.\nIt is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.\nMemorandum: On appeal from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of guilty of burglary in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 140.30 [2]) and criminal sexual act in the first degree (\u00a7 130.50 [1]), defendant contends that the waiver of the right to appeal is not valid, and he challenges the severity of the sentence. Although we agree with defendant that the waiver of the right to appeal is invalid because the perfunctory inquiry made by County Court was \u201cinsufficient to establish that the court \u2018 engage [d] the defendant in an adequate colloquy to ensure that the waiver of the right to appeal was a knowing and voluntary choice\u2019 \u201d (People v Brown, 296 AD2d 860, 860 [2002], lv denied 98 NY2d 767 [2002]; see People v Hamilton, 49 AD3d 1163, 1164 [2008]), we nevertheless conclude that the sentence is not unduly harsh or severe.
