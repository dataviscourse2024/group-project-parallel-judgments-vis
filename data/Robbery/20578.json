O.\n\n\n     FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF TRAVIS COUNTY, 98TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n         NO. J28,994, HONORABLE W. JEANNE MEURER, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                             MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n               On May 7, 2012, appellant M.O. admitted in open court to committing robbery on\n\nNovember 14, 2011, and was found by the juvenile court to be a child who had engaged in delinquent\n\nconduct. The juvenile court also took notice that appellant had previously been adjudicated delinquent\n\nfor robbery on August 25, 2009, and for attempted burglary of a habitation on May 6, 2008, and\n\nthat therefore, appellant was a habitual offender. See Tex. Fam. Code \u00a7 51.031. The juvenile court\n\nordered a disposition of a twenty-year determinate sentence.\n\n               Appellant\u2019s court-appointed attorney has filed a motion to withdraw as counsel\n\nsupported by a brief concluding that the appeal is frivolous and without merit. The brief meets the\n\nrequirements of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 743-744 (1967), by presenting a professional\n\nevaluation of the record demonstrating why there are no arguable grounds to be advanced. See\n\nPenson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 80 (1988); Anders, 386 U.S. at 743-44; High v. State, 573 S.W.2d 807,\n\n811-13 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978); Currie v. State, 516 S.W.2d 684, 684 (Tex. Crim. App. 1974);\n\nGainous v. State, 436 S.W.2d 137, 138 (Tex. Crim. App. 1969). Appellant\u2019s attorney sent appellant\n\fa copy of the brief and advised him that he had the right to examine the record and file a pro se brief.\n\nSee Anders, 386 U.S. at 744; Jackson v. State, 485 S.W.2d 553, 553 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972). No\n\npro se brief has been filed.\n\n                We have conducted our own review of the evidence and the procedures that were\n\nobserved, and we agree with counsel that the appeal is frivolous and without merit. We grant counsel\u2019s\n\nmotion to withdraw and affirm the adjudication of the juvenile court.1\n\n\n\n                                                __________________________________________\n\n                                                David Puryear, Justice\n\nBefore Justices Puryear, Pemberton and Rose\n\nAffirmed\n\nFiled: August 13, 2013\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          No substitute counsel will be appointed. Should appellant wish to seek further review of\nhis case by the supreme court, he must either retain an attorney to file a petition for discretionary\nreview or file a pro se petition for discretionary review. See generally Tex. R. App. P. 53-56\n(governing proceedings in the Texas Supreme Court); see also Ex parte Valle, 104 S.W.3d 888, 890\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2003). Any petition for discretionary review must be filed within forty-five days\nfrom the date of either this opinion or the date this Court overrules the last timely motion for\nrehearing filed. See Tex. R. App. P. 53.7. Any petition for discretionary review should comply with\nthe rules of appellate procedure. See Tex. R. App. P.53.1, 53.2, 53.7.\n\n                                                   2\n\f",
