The appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing (Demakos, J.), of that branch of the defendant\u2019s omnibus motion which was to suppress identification evidence.\nOrdered that the judgment is modified, as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, by providing that the terms of imprisonment imposed on the convictions of robbery in the first degree shall run concurrently with each other; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.\nContrary to defendant\u2019s contention, his showup identification was not unduly suggestive merely because the two complainants were together (see, People v Love, 57 NY2d 1023). Although simultaneous showup procedures are generally disfavored (see, People v Adams, 53 NY2d 241), they are permissible when, as here, they are conducted in close spatial and temporal proximity to the commission of the crime for the purpose of securing a prompt and reliable identification (see, People v Laing, 221 AD2d 662).\nThe sentence imposed was excessive to the extent indicated. Bracken, P. J., Ritter, Goldstein and Feuerstein, JJ., concur.\n",
