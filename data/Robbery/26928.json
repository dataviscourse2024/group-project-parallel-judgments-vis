No. 5:17-CR-00106-HE-1)\n\n\nLynn C. Hartfield, Law Office of Lynn C. Hartfield, LLC, Denver, Colorado, for\nDefendant-Appellant.\n\nSteven W. Creager, Assistant United States Attorney (Robert J. Troester, Acting\nUnited States Attorney, and Jacquelyn M. Hutzell, Assistant United States\nAttorney, with him on the brief), Office of the United States Attorney, Western\nDistrict of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for Plaintiff-Appellee.\n\n\nBefore HARTZ, HOLMES, and CARSON, Circuit Judges.\n\n\nHOLMES, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n      Jason Davon Garcia seeks review of a sentence of ninety-six months\u2019\n\nimprisonment imposed after he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a\n\ffirearm. He claims that the district court erred in considering his earlier\n\npossession of two handguns as relevant conduct and that the sentence the court\n\nimposed on him is substantively unreasonable.\n\n      Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), we\n\nreject Mr. Garcia\u2019s challenges. We review Mr. Garcia\u2019s relevant-conduct\n\nargument for plain error and conclude that the district court did not plainly err in\n\ntreating his prior incident of handgun possession as relevant conduct as to his\n\noffense of conviction. We also conclude that the district court\u2019s sentence is not\n\nsubstantively unreasonable. We therefore affirm. More specifically, Judge Hartz\n\nconcurs in the judgment and joins the following opinion except for Part II.\n\n                                          I\n\n      In May 2017, a federal grand jury sitting in the Western District of\n\nOklahoma returned an indictment alleging that, on or about April 21, 2017, in\n\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma, Mr. Garcia violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) by\n\npossessing a firearm after having previously been convicted of a felony. Mr.\n\nGarcia pleaded guilty to the Indictment\u2019s sole count without a plea agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f      The Probation Office then prepared a Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). 1 In\n\ndescribing Mr. Garcia\u2019s offense conduct, the PSR observed that, on April 24,\n\n2016\u2014nearly a year before the April 2017 firearm possession, which formed the\n\nbasis of his offense of conviction\u2014officers from the Oklahoma City Police\n\nDepartment (\u201cOCPD\u201d) encountered Mr. Garcia and his girlfriend at a gas station\n\nin a high-crime area, started talking to him, requested his identification, and asked\n\nwhether he was carrying any weapons. Mr. Garcia disclosed that he was carrying\n\na gun, and an officer found two loaded handguns in Mr. Garcia\u2019s waistband. The\n\nofficer arrested Mr. Garcia on an outstanding warrant, and he was later charged in\n\nstate court with being a felon in possession of a firearm.\n\n      The PSR also described the events directly giving rise to Mr. Garcia\u2019s\n\ncurrent conviction: Specifically, in April 2017, OCPD officers were called to a\n\nhigh school and spoke to the daughter of Mr. Garcia\u2019s girlfriend. The daughter\n\nreported that her mother (i.e., Mr. Garcia\u2019s girlfriend) had locked herself in a\n\nbedroom to \u201cget away from\u201d Mr. Garcia, who \u201cwas agitated\u201d and \u201chad his rifle\n\nout.\u201d R., Vol. II, \u00b6 8, at 6 (PSR, originally filed Nov. 22, 2017, revised Dec. 18,\n\n2017). Other officers went to the house where Mr. Garcia\u2019s girlfriend was\n\n\n\n      1\n             The Probation Office used the 2016 edition of the United States\nSentencing Guidelines Manual in preparing the PSR. That decision is not\nchallenged here. Accordingly, we also use that edition when resolving the issues\nin this appeal.\n\n                                          3\n\flocated and convinced her to leave with them. Officers later interviewed her, and\n\nshe stated that Mr. Garcia \u201csuddenly became upset with her and hit her with an\n\nunknown object\u201d and \u201cpunched her in the leg.\u201d Id. Officers saw a \u201cfresh wound\n\nwith blood\u201d on her leg. Id.\n\n      Mr. Garcia\u2019s girlfriend had told officers that he \u201chad his rifle out\u201d during\n\nthe incident at the house, but she later told them that she had not seen him \u201cget\n\nthe rifle out in six months.\u201d Id. Officers noted that she seemed frightened about\n\nwhat Mr. Garcia might do to her and seemed reluctant to tell them \u201cthe whole\n\ntruth.\u201d Id. She also expressed concern that Mr. Garcia would commit \u201csuicide by\n\ncop\u201d rather than go back to jail. Id. The girlfriend gave consent to search the\n\nhouse, and officers discovered a loaded rifle under Mr. Garcia\u2019s bed and 108\n\nrounds of ammunition throughout the house.\n\n      The PSR calculated a total offense level of twenty-one. In doing so, it\n\napplied a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1)(A) of the United States\n\nSentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d) for an offense\n\ninvolving three or more firearms; the number comprises the rifle forming the\n\nbasis for the conviction and the two handguns discovered in the April 2016\n\nfirearms incident. The PSR observed that the April 2016 incident and the April\n\n2017 offense of conviction occurred a little less than a year apart.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f       The PSR then set forth Mr. Garcia\u2019s criminal history. Mr. Garcia has a\n\nlong criminal record, consisting of mostly state offenses that date back to when he\n\nwas a juvenile. His record includes a 1993 juvenile adjudication for possessing a\n\nweapon (i.e., an unloaded pistol) on school property when Mr. Garcia was sixteen\n\nyears old. His record also includes subsequent adult convictions for, inter alia,\n\nburglary and attempted automobile burglary, as well as discharging a firearm from\n\na motor vehicle (in 1994, when he was seventeen years old); pointing a firearm at\n\nanother (in 1996, when he was nineteen years old); domestic abuse (in 2002,\n\nwhen he was twenty-five years old); and unlawful possession of marijuana,\n\nmethamphetamine, and drug paraphernalia, as well as unlawful shipment, transfer,\n\nreceipt, or possession of stolen firearms (in 2008, when he was thirty-one years\n\nold). Notably, the PSR did not assign criminal-history points to over a dozen of\n\nMr. Garcia\u2019s prior convictions because they were not countable, for various\n\nreasons, under the Guidelines\u2014a majority of them merely because they were too\n\nold.\n\n       According to the PSR, Mr. Garcia\u2019s subtotal criminal history score was\n\nthree, and one of those criminal-history points stemmed from a 2007 conviction\n\nfor possession of methamphetamine for which he received a five-year suspended\n\nsentence in June 2011. The PSR added two points to his subtotal criminal-history\n\nscore, pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.1(d), because Mr. Garcia \u201ccommitted the\n\n\n                                          5\n\finstant offense while under a criminal justice sentence\u201d resulting from the 2007\n\nconviction. Id., \u00b6 52, at 19. This calculation yielded a total of five criminal-\n\nhistory points, placing Mr. Garcia in criminal-history category III. Based on a\n\ntotal offense level of twenty-one and a criminal-history category of III, the PSR\n\nfound that the Guidelines range was forty-six to fifty-seven months\u2019\n\nimprisonment. Id., \u00b6 96, at 28.\n\n      The PSR also identified factors that might warrant a non-Guidelines\n\nsentence. In particular, when discussing whether an upward variance would be\n\njustified, the PSR generally stated the following:\n\n             Based on the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history\n             and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence\n             imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, the need to\n             afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and the need to\n             protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, an\n             upward variance may be warranted.\n\nId., \u00b6 119, at 31. In particular, the PSR commented as follows:\n\n            The defendant sustained his first felony conviction shortly after\n            he turned 18; for essentially his entire adult life it has been\n            unlawful for him to possess firearms. However, he has repeatedly\n            continued to disregard the law both with respect to firearms and\n            other criminal activity. . . . The defendant\u2019s possession of a\n            firearm is particularly concerning \u2013 more so than the \u201caverage\u201d\n            felon in possession case \u2013 because of his history involving\n            pointing and discharging firearms. This concern is further\n            increased because of the defendant\u2019s apparently unstable mental\n            state and his ongoing involvement in domestic violence.\n\nId., \u00b6 120, at 31\u201332.\n\n\n                                          6\n\f       In urging the court to consider imposing an upward variance, the Probation\n\nOffice stressed that the Guidelines range did not adequately take into account the\n\nseriousness and longstanding nature of Mr. Garcia\u2019s criminal conduct.\n\nUnderscoring the seriousness of his criminal record, the PSR noted that Mr.\n\nGarcia was only one qualifying conviction short of the three required to subject\n\nhim to a sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), which\n\nrequires courts to impose a fifteen-year mandatory-minimum prison term on\n\neligible offenders. 2\n\n       And, regarding the concern posed by Mr. Garcia\u2019s mental state, the PSR\n\nreported, among other indicators of significant mental instability, that Mr. Garcia\n\nhad been diagnosed on two prior occasions as suffering from \u201cAntisocial\n\nPersonality Disorder,\u201d that he had previously noted \u201chis own weaknesses as\n\nhurting those he cares about and feeling no pain,\u201d and that currently he \u201creported\n\nexperiencing visual and auditory hallucinations.\u201d Id., \u00b6\u00b6 72\u201373, at 24.\n\n       Mr. Garcia filed objections to the PSR\u2019s Guidelines computations, arguing\n\nin pertinent part that the two additional criminal-history points had been\n\n\n       2\n              The PSR informed the court that, as a matter of law, Mr. Garcia was\nnot eligible for the ACCA\u2019s fifteen-year mandatory-minimum sentence because\nour court had determined that the crime forming the basis for one of his prior\nconvictions\u2014the 1996 Oklahoma offense for pointing a firearm\u2014did not qualify\nas a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. See R., Vol. II, \u00b6121, at 32 (citing United\nStates v. Titties, 852 F.3d 1257 (10th Cir. 2017), in which we held that\nOklahoma\u2019s offense for pointing a firearm was not a violent felony).\n\n                                         7\n\fimproperly assessed, pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.1(d), because his five-year\n\nsuspended sentence for methamphetamine possession expired in June 2016, \u201cprior\n\nto the allegations in the case before the [district] [c]ourt\u201d\u2014that is, the April 2017\n\nunlawful firearm-possession offense. Id. at 33 (Addendum to PSR, filed Dec. 18,\n\n2017).\n\n         The Probation Office responded that, in April 2016, prior to the expiration\n\nof his suspended sentence, Mr. Garcia had unlawfully possessed two handguns,\n\nand this possession was relevant conduct with respect to his subsequent April\n\n2017 offense of conviction. Therefore, it reasoned that adding the two points for\n\ncommitting \u201cthe instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence\u201d was\n\nappropriate. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(d). More specifically, referencing the Guidelines\n\ncommentary, the Probation Office explained that the \u201cinstant offense,\u201d which\n\n\u00a7 4A1.1(d) contemplates, is not limited to just the crime of conviction\u2014which\n\nadmittedly occurred in April 2017, after his suspended sentence expired. Rather,\n\nthis term, said the Office, encompasses relevant conduct, such as his April 2016\n\nincident involving the unlawful possession of firearms. R., Vol. II, 34. Thus, at\n\nthe time of that incident (i.e., in April 2016) Mr. Garcia was still under a\n\n\u201ccriminal justice sentence\u201d and thus two additional criminal-history points were\n\nproperly attributed to him.\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f      The district court considered Mr. Garcia\u2019s objections during a sentencing\n\nhearing. Defense counsel initially said that he would stand on his written\n\nobjections, while the government stated that it agreed with the Probation Office\u2019s\n\nassessment. As relevant here, defense counsel subsequently reiterated that Mr.\n\nGarcia was not \u201csubject to any criminal indictment, supervision, or probation at\n\nthe time this offense occurred,\u201d such that \u201cthat [\u00a7 4A1.1(d)] enhancement would\n\nnot apply.\u201d Id., Vol. III, at 56 (Sentencing Tr., filed Apr. 6, 2018). Notably, Mr.\n\nGarcia did not specifically object to the Probation Office\u2019s predicate finding that\n\nthe April 2016 incident was relevant conduct as to the April 2017 offense of\n\nconviction.\n\n      However, the government agreed with this relevant-conduct finding and\n\nmade it the centerpiece of its argument. It emphasized that the April 2016\n\nincident was relevant conduct because Mr. Garcia\u2019s actions were \u201cjust a\n\ncontinuing set of circumstances where [he] was repeatedly and continuously\n\npossessing firearms as a felon.\u201d Id. at 57. The district court asked whether\n\ndefense counsel had \u201c[a]nything . . . to add to\u201d the government\u2019s analysis, and\n\ndefense counsel responded, \u201c[n]o.\u201d Id. at 57\u201358.\n\n      The district court stated that the relevant-conduct question was \u201cclose\u201d due\n\nto the \u201cthe amount of time that elapsed between\u201d the April 2016 incident and the\n\nApril 2017 offense of conviction, but it ultimately overruled Mr. Garcia\u2019s\n\n\n                                         9\n\fobjection because there was \u201ca more or less continuous course of conduct over an\n\nextended period of time involving possession of firearms by [Mr. Garcia] in\n\nvarious contexts.\u201d Id. at 58. The district court ultimately adopted the PSR\u2019s\n\nGuidelines computations.\n\n      Mr. Garcia and counsel made statements prior to sentencing. Defense\n\ncounsel contended that Mr. Garcia had \u201cmade it as painless as can be for the\n\n[g]overnment\u201d by pleading guilty, and counsel urged the court to consider that\n\nMr. Garcia had been in custody \u201cfor in excess of eight months\u201d based on the\n\ninstant offense with \u201cno misconducts.\u201d Id. at 59. Mr. Garcia stated that he had\n\n\u201ctime to think about a lot of things\u201d while in custody and would not exercise\n\nsimilar \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in the future. Id. at 59\u201360. The government requested a\n\nsentence at the high end of the Guidelines range. Specifically, the government\n\nnoted Mr. Garcia\u2019s \u201clifetime of criminal activity,\u201d which had been \u201cvirtually\n\nnonstop\u201d since he was sixteen. Id. at 60\u201362.\n\n      The district court, however, elected to vary upward instead from the\n\nGuidelines sentencing range and imposed a term of ninety-six months\u2019\n\nimprisonment. After noting its duty to consider the Guidelines and relevant\n\nstatutory factors, it offered a rationale for its decision:\n\n             The things that the statute requires me to consider include the\n             nature and circumstances of the offense.\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f             Here, of course, I\u2019ve considered the fact that [Mr. Garcia] was\n             picked up apparently during a relatively violent episode where\n             the rifle was present.\n\n             There was at least some suggestion in the [PSR] that he had\n             access to it in connection with this dispute with his wife [3] that\n             triggered the immediate inquiry from law enforcement.\n\n             It appears that -- from the condition and circumstances of the\n             house, that [Mr. Garcia] was, if not planning for a shootout,\n             at least equipped for one.\n\n             And so that, coupled with the fact that we have had multiple\n             instances of [Mr. Garcia] dealing with guns over an extended\n             period of time and all subsequent to an early felony\n             conviction many years ago, suggests to me that we have a\n             very serious set of circumstances here because, as counsel for\n             the [g]overnment has suggested, there has been a long, more\n             or less continuous history of law-breaking by [Mr. Garcia].\n\n             But it appears that throughout virtually the entire period of his\n             adult life, when he\u2019s committed these other crimes, he\u2019s also\n             had guns around. So this circumstance here is, in my view, a\n             very serious offense.\n\n             I\u2019m required to consider [Mr. Garcia\u2019s history]. The most\n             pertinent thing, of course, is that he does have a long, pretty\n             much continuous history of breaking the law, criminal\n             convictions for one thing or another.\n\n\n\n      3\n             The district court apparently misspoke in referring to the female\ninvolved in the April 2017 incident, which gave rise to Mr. Garcia\u2019s offense of\nconviction, as his \u201cwife\u201d; the PSR consistently refers to the woman as Mr.\nGarcia\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d See, e.g., R., Vol. II, \u00b6 7, at 3. Mr. Garcia does not refer to\nthis seemingly minor mistake in his appellate briefing, much less contend that it\nhas any material bearing on his appellate challenges. Therefore, we do not\nconsider the matter further.\n\n\n                                           11\n\fAt least some of those convictions are for violent conduct,\nboth in terms of the domestic abuse, and I recall one, I think,\nwas a drive-by shooting or something equivalent to that.\n\nSo we have a very serious streak of violent conduct as a part\nof the broader range of criminal activity he\u2019s been involved\nin.\n\n[Mr. Garcia] appears to have mental health issues of some\nsort, at least in the sense of anger management -- maybe more\nserious than that -- that also, I think, contributes to the\nseriousness of what we\u2019re dealing with here.\n\n[The government] has mentioned the factor that I think is\nprobably the most important of the statutory factors. In some\ncases, it\u2019s not the most important, but here I think it probably\nis. That\u2019s the need to protect the public from further crimes\nof [Mr. Garcia].\n\nI appreciate what [Mr. Garcia] said here today, in terms of\nlearning his lesson, and I hope that\u2019s true, but the history that\nI am looking at here over the last 15 or 20 years suggests to\nme that there were a lot of opportunities to learn that lesson\nand it didn\u2019t get learned.\n\nSo I think there is a substantial need to protect the public\nfrom the risk of further criminal activity of [Mr. Garcia],\npartly reflected by the repetitive nature of his criminal\nactivity generally, but also from the repetitive nature of these\nsituations where he\u2019s illegally possessing a firearm and, in\nsome cases, it appears, using it. So all of that adds to the\nseriousness here.\n\nI think that, in my view, this is simply a situation where the\n[G]uideline[s] range does not reach an adequate sentence.\n\n      ....\n\nIt just seems to me that when you consider, in this case, the\nlengthy history of criminal conduct, as [the government] has\n\n                             12\n\f             pointed out, running more or less continuously from the age\n             of 16 or 17, the fact that much of it was violent in terms of\n             these battery situations, the drive-by incident, the\n             amm[unition] in the house, the various aspects of that, the\n             repeated possession of the guns, and I think, as I say, the\n             anger management/mental-health-type issues that appear to be\n             part of it, this is simply a situation where the risk to the public\n             from the defendant is very significant, and I think there is a\n             need to protect the public from the risk of further crimes.\n             And the [G]uideline[s] sentence, in my view, does not get\n             there.\n\n             So it\u2019s going to be the judgment of the Court that [Mr.\n             Garcia] be committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons\n             for a term of 96 months.\n\nId. at 62\u201366 (emphases added).\n\n      The district court entered judgment consistent with this ruling, and Mr.\n\nGarcia timely appealed.\n\n                                                II\n\n                                                A\n\n      Mr. Garcia challenges the district court\u2019s relevant-conduct finding. Before\n\nwe turn to the merits of this issue, however, we consider the appropriate standard\n\nof review, as we have only \u201climited power\u201d to correct errors that were forfeited in\n\nthe district court. United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731 (1993); see also\n\nUnited States v. Rosales-Miranda, 755 F.3d 1253, 1258 (10th Cir. 2014)\n\n(applying \u201crigorous\u201d plain-error standard of review to forfeited errors); accord\n\nF ED . R. C RIM . P. 52(b). Mr. Garcia acknowledges that the district court\u2019s\n\n\n                                           13\n\frelevant-conduct finding is reviewable only for plain error because he did not\n\nobject to this finding. See Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 8. 4\n\n\n      4\n              Curiously, in connection with discussing the standard of review, Mr.\nGarcia notes that he \u201cdid object to the addition of two criminal history points for\ncommitting the instant offense while under a criminal justice sentence,\u201d and the\npropriety of applying those points \u201cinvolves a legal question of guideline\ninterpretation,\u201d which \u201cis reviewed de novo.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 8\u20139.\nRelatedly, he purports to concede that he is subject to the plain-error standard of\nreview concerning the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-level enhancement\npursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1)(A) for an offense involving three or more\nfirearms\u2014which was based on the district court\u2019s determination that the two\nhandguns discovered in Mr. Garcia\u2019s possession in April 2016 were relevant\nconduct\u2014because he did not object to this enhancement. But as clearly evident\nfrom Mr. Garcia\u2019s framing in his opening brief of his issues on appeal and his\ncomments at oral argument, Mr. Garcia fully understands that, with respect to the\ndistrict court\u2019s Guidelines rulings, the sole issue before us is whether the court\nerred in its relevant-conduct determination, and our review of that issue is for\nplain error because Mr. Garcia did not object to this determination. See, e.g., id.\nat 2 (describing the Guidelines issue for appeal as \u201cwhether the district court\nplainly erred in finding that a 2016 arrest for felon in possession of a firearm . . .\nconstituted relevant conduct\u201d (capitalization omitted)).\n\n       To be sure, that relevant-conduct ruling \u201cwas used [by the court] to\nsupport,\u201d inter alia, its application of two criminal-history points under\n\u00a7 4A1.1(d) and the two offense levels under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1)(A), for an offense\ninvolving three or more firearms. Id. at 15. But, notably, before the district court\nand on appeal, the court\u2019s determination of that relevant-conduct predicate for\nthese two enhancements has been the exclusive basis for Mr. Garcia\u2019s objection to\nthem. In other words, the gravamen of his objection to these two Guidelines\nenhancements is that they are based on an ostensibly flawed relevant-conduct\ndetermination. Thus, it is not surprising that Mr. Garcia has not argued that the\ncourt\u2019s addition of these enhancements was improper for an independent, non-\nrelevant-conduct reason. More specifically, no such arguments adequate for our\nreview appear in his opening brief with respect to the addition of these\nenhancements. See, e.g., Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d 664, 679 (10th\nCir. 1998) (\u201cArguments inadequately briefed in the opening brief are waived . . .\n                                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                          14\n\f      Because we review only for plain error, Mr. Garcia must show \u201c(1) an\n\nerror, (2) that is plain, which means clear or obvious under current law, and (3)\n\nthat affects substantial rights.\u201d United States v. McGehee, 672 F.3d 860, 876\n\n(10th Cir. 2012) (quoting United States v. Cooper, 654 F.3d 1104, 1117 (10th Cir.\n\n2011)). If Mr. Garcia satisfies these criteria, then under the fourth element of the\n\nplain-error test, we may exercise our discretion to correct the error if it \u201cseriously\n\naffects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d Id.\n\n(quoting Cooper, 654 F.3d at 1117); see also United States v. Gonzalez-Huerta,\n\n403 F.3d 727, 736 (10th Cir. 2005) (en banc) (underscoring that the party seeking\n\nrelief under the plain-error rubric bears the burden of satisfying its elements).\n\n      With regard to the standard\u2019s first inquiry\u2014whether there was error at\n\nall\u2014the parties dispute the question of whether relevant conduct is an issue of\n\nlaw, reviewed de novo, or an issue of fact, reviewed for clear error. See Aplt.\u2019s\n\n\n\n      4\n        (...continued)\n.\u201d). Put another way, his objections to these two enhancements are entirely\nsubsidiary to, and derivative of, his objection on appeal to the court\u2019s relevant-\nconduct determination. As his counsel candidly acknowledged at oral argument,\nMr. Garcia\u2019s objections to these enhancements will \u201cstand or fall\u201d with his\nobjection to the court\u2019s relevant-conduct ruling. Oral Arg. 3:05\u20133:07. Therefore,\nwe need not conduct an independent, standard-of-review analysis with respect to\nthe district court\u2019s rulings concerning these two enhancements. The only\nGuidelines ruling truly before us relates to the district court\u2019s determination that\nthe April 2016 incident is relevant conduct with respect to the April 2017\nincident, which formed the basis for Mr. Garcia\u2019s felon-in-possession conviction.\nAnd the standard of review for that issue is plain error.\n\n                                          15\n\fOpening Br. at 9 (arguing for de novo review); Aplee\u2019s Resp. Br. at 13 n.2\n\n(\u201c[T]he proper standard for reviewing whether a district court\u2019s relevant conduct\n\ndetermination was valid is normally clear error, as such a determination is a\n\nfactual finding.\u201d). Unfortunately, \u201c[t]he answer to this question has perplexed\n\nthis Court. . . . [and] [w]e have been inconsistent in our decisions\u201d concerning it.\n\nUnited States v. Craig, 808 F.3d 1249, 1255 (10th Cir. 2015). We need not delve\n\ninto this matter further, however. Instead, we are content to \u201cgive [Mr. Garcia]\n\nthe benefit of the doubt and assume for the purposes of this appeal that a district\n\ncourt\u2019s ultimate determination of relevant conduct is a legal conclusion we review\n\nde novo.\u201d Id. This is so because, irrespective of the character of this ultimate\n\nrelevant-conduct determination, Mr. Garcia\u2019s challenge here turns on whether the\n\nrecord provides a proper foundation for certain subsidiary \u201cfactual findings in\n\nsupport of a determination of relevant conduct.\u201d United States v. Griffith, 584\n\nF.3d 1004, 1012 (10th Cir. 2009). And it is undisputed that ordinarily (absent\n\nforfeiture) we must review those findings only for clear error. Id.; accord United\n\nStates v. Smith, 705 F.3d 1268, 1274 (10th Cir. 2013); see Craig, 808 F.3d at\n\n1255 (\u201cEven under this assumption [that relevant conduct is a question of law],\n\nwe must still review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings supporting\n\nits determination of relevant conduct.\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\f      As to the plain-error rubric\u2019s second inquiry, we have held that an error is\n\nclear or obvious if \u201cit is contrary to well-settled law.\u201d United States v. Whitney,\n\n229 F.3d 1296, 1309 (10th Cir. 2000); accord United States v. DeChristopher,\n\n695 F.3d 1082, 1091 (10th Cir. 2012). And \u201c[i]n general, for an error to be\n\ncontrary to well-settled law, either the Supreme Court or this court must have\n\naddressed the issue.\u201d United States v. Ruiz-Gea, 340 F.3d 1181, 1187 (10th Cir.\n\n2003); accord United States v. Thornburgh, 645 F.3d 1197, 1208 (10th Cir.\n\n2011). Lastly, as to the third inquiry, ordinarily when we say that \u201cthe error\n\naffects substantial rights . . . [that] \u2018usually means that the error must have\n\naffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019\u201d Gonzalez-Huerta, 403\n\nF.3d at 732\u201333 (quoting United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 632 (2002));\n\naccord United States v. Pablo, 696 F.3d 1280, 1293 (10th Cir. 2012).\n\n                                           B\n\n      We now turn to the merits of Mr. Garcia\u2019s relevant-conduct argument. Mr.\n\nGarcia\u2019s argument concerns the application of Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.3, entitled\n\n\u201cRelevant Conduct,\u201d and particularly its instruction that, as to \u201coffenses of a\n\ncharacter for which [Guidelines] \u00a7 3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple\n\ncounts,\u201d relevant conduct includes \u201call acts or omissions . . . that were part of the\n\nsame course of conduct . . . as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2)\n\n(emphasis added). Significantly, \u00a7 3D1.2(d) requires the grouping of multiple\n\n\n                                           17\n\fcounts of offenses that \u00a7 2K2.1 covers. And \u00a7 2K2.1 is applicable to Mr.\n\nGarcia\u2019s offense of conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). See id. \u00a7 3D1.2(d).\n\nTherefore, the court was obliged to apply the same-course-of-conduct standard\n\nhere. This standard is a factual one, and, consequently, a court\u2019s same-course-of-\n\nconduct determination ordinarily (absent forfeiture) would be reviewed only for\n\nclear error. See, e.g., United States v. Svacina, 137 F.3d 1179, 1185 (10th Cir.\n\n1998) (\u201cWe hold that the court\u2019s factual finding that Defendant\u2019s possession of\n\nmethamphetamine in August 1995 was part of the same course of conduct as the\n\noffense of conviction is not clearly erroneous.\u201d); United States v. McKneely, 69\n\nF.3d 1067, 1079 (10th Cir. 1995) (\u201cThe district court\u2019s determination that the\n\ncocaine seized in Utah was involved in the same course of conduct as the offense\n\nof conviction was not clearly erroneous.\u201d).\n\n      According to an application note to \u00a7 1B1.3, offenses are part of the same\n\ncourse of conduct if they \u201care sufficiently connected or related to each other as to\n\nwarrant the conclusion that they are part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing\n\nseries of offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. n.5(B)(ii). The note continues as\n\nfollows:\n\n             Factors that are appropriate to the determination of whether\n             offenses are sufficiently connected or related to each other to\n             be considered as part of the same course of conduct include\n             the degree of similarity of the offenses, the regularity\n             (repetitions) of the offenses, and the time interval between the\n             offenses. When one of the above factors is absent, a stronger\n\n                                          18\n\f             presence of at least one of the other factors is required. For\n             example, where the conduct alleged to be relevant is relatively\n             remote to the offense of conviction, a stronger showing of\n             similarity or regularity is necessary to compensate for the\n             absence of temporal proximity. The nature of the offenses\n             may also be a relevant consideration (e.g., a defendant\u2019s\n             failure to file tax returns in three consecutive years\n             appropriately would be considered as part of the same course\n             of conduct because such returns are only required at yearly\n             intervals).\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n      We have opined that this same-course-of-conduct standard \u201clooks to\n\nwhether the defendant repeats the same type of criminal activity over time,\u201d but\n\n\u201cdoes not require that acts be \u2018connected together\u2019 by common participants or by\n\nan overall scheme.\u201d United States v. Roederer, 11 F.3d 973, 979 (10th Cir. 1993)\n\n(quoting United States v. Perdomo, 927 F.2d 111, 115 (2d Cir. 1991)). 5 \u201cIt\n\n      5\n              Mr. Garcia observes that both Roederer and United States v.\nRichards, 27 F.3d 465 (10th Cir. 1994), were decided prior to a 1994 amendment\nto the Guidelines commentary which \u201cspecifically directed courts to consider\nsimilarity, regularity and time interval separately, and to require a stronger\npresence of one when another factor is absent.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s Reply Br. at 10 n.1. He\ndoes not argue, however, that these cases are inapposite as to all matters arising in\nthe relevant-conduct context. Indeed, he relies on Roederer\u2019s analysis of one of\nthe three factors. See Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 13. Moreover, our cases after 1994\nhave continued to cite Roederer and Richards for other relevant-conduct\nprinciples. See, e.g., United States v. Caldwell, 585 F.3d 1347, 1350\u201351 (10th\nCir. 2009); see also United States v. Niles, 708 F. App\u2019x 496, 504 (10th Cir.\n2017) (unpublished). Therefore, although we do not rely on Roederer and\nRichards for principles directly relating to the existence of an obligation of\nsentencing courts to consider the three factors and the specified methodology for\nweighing the factors, we rely on the cases for other, more general principles\n                                                                         (continued...)\n\n                                          19\n\ffocuses instead on whether [a] defendant has engaged in an identifiable \u2018behavior\n\npattern\u2019 . . . of specified criminal activity.\u201d Id. (emphasis added) (quoting\n\nPerdomo, 927 F.2d at 115). Morever, \u201ceach case depends largely on its own\n\nfacts.\u201d Id. (quoting United States v. Santiago, 906 F.2d 867, 872 (2d Cir. 1990)).\n\n      Here, the parties dispute the presence and strength of each of the three\n\napplication-note factors\u2014that is, the degree of similarity of the offenses, the\n\nregularity or repetition of the offenses, and the temporal proximity of the\n\noffenses. For the reasons explicated below, we conclude that, with respect to the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s relevant-conduct determination, Mr. Garcia cannot establish\n\nreversible error under the plain-error standard. 6\n\n                                           1\n\n      Mr. Garcia first argues that the two instances of possession were \u201cfactually\n\ndissimilar.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 12. That is, during the April 2016 incident,\n\nhe possessed handguns on his person and outside his home, there was no evidence\n\nthat he was \u201cusing\u201d the guns when he was apprehended, and he was compliant\n\n      5\n      (...continued)\ngermane to the relevant-conduct determination.\n      6\n               Mr. Garcia is correct that the district court did not individually\naddress the three factors and expressly balance them against each other. See\nAplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 11\u201312. Under similar circumstances, however, we have\nruled that a district court\u2019s failure to make \u201cspecific findings\u201d on the factors is\nnot fatal in light of our ability to affirm on any ground supported by the record.\nSee Richards, 27 F.3d at 468 (citing Roederer, 11 F.3d at 977).\n\n                                          20\n\fwhen officers asked to speak with him. Id. On the other hand, during the April\n\n2017 incident, the firearm was found at Mr. Garcia\u2019s home and his girlfriend\n\n\u201cgave inconsistent stories about whether Mr. Garcia actually had his rifle out, or\n\nwhether it had always been under the bed.\u201d Id.; see also Aplt.\u2019s Reply Br. at 4\n\n(arguing that \u201cthe only similarity\u201d between the incidents was \u201cthe name of the\n\ncharge and the name of the defendant\u201d).\n\n      The government argues otherwise, relying principally on United States v.\n\nWindle, 74 F.3d 997 (10th Cir. 1996). There, we rejected a defendant\u2019s argument\n\nthat possession of other firearms was not relevant conduct to a felon-in-\n\npossession charge, observing succinctly that \u201cthe offenses were not merely similar\n\nbut identical.\u201d Id. at 1000. The government also notes that both offenses\n\noccurred in Oklahoma City, see, e.g., United States v. Caldwell, 585 F.3d 1347,\n\n1353 (10th Cir. 2009) (finding similarity present for producing and selling crack\n\ncocaine where, inter alia, \u201call three instances of Mr. Caldwell\u2019s conduct of\n\nconviction and all three instances of his relevant conduct took place in the same\n\ncity in Kansas\u201d), and that in both instances the guns were \u201cloaded and ready to be\n\nfired,\u201d Aplee.\u2019s Resp. Br. at 16.\n\n      Having considered the parties\u2019 arguments here, we conclude that Mr.\n\nGarcia has failed to establish the \u201cfactual dissimilarity\u201d that he alleges. More\n\nspecifically, we conclude that he has not established error\u2014much less clear or\n\n                                          21\n\fobvious error\u2014concerning a judicial finding of similarity. Notably, he has not\n\noffered us any legal authority that indicates that the fine distinctions that he draws\n\nbetween the precise location where the firearms were possessed, his use of the\n\nfirearms, and his compliance with law enforcement are distinctions with a\n\nmaterial difference on the question of similarity. On the other hand, our decision\n\nin Windle appears to forcefully undercut Mr. Garcia\u2019s similarity argument.\n\nWindle may be reasonably read as holding that, in connection with a felon-in-\n\npossession crime, a defendant\u2019s additional instances of illegal firearm possession\n\nmay be found to be \u201cnot merely similar but identical,\u201d 74 F.3d at 1000, to the\n\noffense of conviction\u2014without the need for a sentencing court to engage in a\n\ndetailed analysis of the factual circumstances of each possession.\n\n      Mr. Garcia\u2019s attempts to diminish the potency of Windle are unpersuasive.\n\nIn this regard, Mr. Garcia contends that Windle engaged in \u201clittle analysis\u201d and\n\nfailed to discuss \u201cthe circumstances under which the individual guns were\n\npossessed\u201d or to expressly weigh the three factors. 7 See Aplt.\u2019s Reply Br. at 5.\n\n      7\n             Mr. Garcia also states that \u201cthe only objection the defendant [in\nWindle] appeared to lodge was to the sufficiency of the proof of his previous\nfirearms possessions, a point he later conceded.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s Reply Br. at 5.\nThis is an untenably narrow reading of Windle. To be sure, the court there\nfirst addressed whether the government had adequately proven that the\noffense \u201cinvolved five firearms,\u201d noting that defense counsel had basically\nconceded this issue at argument. 74 F.3d at 1000. But then the court went\non to analyze the defendant\u2019s contention that \u201cthe possession of the firearms\n                                                                   (continued...)\n\n                                          22\n\fBut, as noted, Windle is reasonably read as not requiring sentencing courts to\n\nparse the factual circumstances under which individual guns are possessed in\n\nreaching similarity determinations, and the mere fact that Windle\u2019s analysis is\n\nbrief does not mean that it is not cogent and entirely congruent with the concerns\n\nof \u00a7 1B1.3, and we conclude that it is.\n\n      Furthermore, stepping beyond Windle, several of our cases have ruled that\n\nallegedly relevant conduct can differ in meaningful respects from the conduct\n\ngiving rise to a conviction without rendering the respective sets of conduct\n\n\u201cfactually dissimilar\u201d from one another. See Caldwell, 585 F.3d at 1353 (\u201cTo be\n\nsure, there were also some differences between Mr. Caldwell\u2019s conduct of\n\nconviction and his relevant conduct. For example, Mr. Caldwell\u2019s role in the\n\nconduct of conviction (distributor) differed from his role in the relevant conduct\n\n(producer). Further, the amount involved in the relevant conduct was greater than\n\nthe amount involved in the conduct of conviction. . . . These differences do not\n\nundercut the substantial similarities between his conduct of conviction and his\n\nadditional relevant conduct.\u201d); see also United States v. Moore, 130 F.3d 1414,\n\n1418 (10th Cir. 1997) (\u201cIn Moore\u2019s case, the record shows substantial similarity\n\n      7\n       (...continued)\n[was] not relevant conduct.\u201d Id. Significantly, the Windle defendant had not\nspecifically conceded the issue of similarity. Therefore, his objection to a\nfinding of relevant-conduct would necessarily have put the issue of similarity\nin play and required the court to resolve it.\n\n                                          23\n\fbetween his nine-ounce crack deal in September 1992 and the smaller deals that\n\ncomprised the earlier conspiracy[.] . . . Although the amount of crack in the\n\nSeptember 1992 [deal] was larger than ever before, this difference does not\n\noutweigh the rest of the similarities with the earlier activities.\u201d). Therefore, the\n\nfine distinctions that Mr. Garcia draws between the April 2016 event and the\n\nApril 2017 offense of conviction do not avail him.\n\n      We thus conclude that Mr. Garcia\u2019s arguments do not permit him to cross\n\nthe threshold of showing that a similarity determination would constitute error.\n\nBut, even if he had succeeded in crossing the error threshold, given the absence of\n\nany controlling, on-point caselaw favorable to his cause, Mr. Garcia could not\n\nestablish that any similarity finding was clear or obvious error. 8 Therefore, the\n\n      8\n              Mr. Garcia\u2019s relevant-conduct argument relies in substantial part on\nthe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in United States v. Amerson, 886 F.3d 568 (6th Cir.\n2018), which found that the relevant-conduct test not satisfied where, inter alia,\nthe guns that were the subject of a felon-in-possession conviction and the guns\nthat were possessed as allegedly relevant conduct were possessed at different\ntimes and under different factual circumstances. Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 14\u201315.\nHowever, as Ruiz-Gea\u2019s holding makes clear, 340 F.3d at 1187, a single decision\nfrom one of our sister circuits ordinarily is no moment on the question of whether\nthe district court clearly or obviously erred, see, e.g., United States v. Schneider,\n704 F.3d 1287, 1304 (10th Cir. 2013) (Holmes, J., concurring, joined by\nMartinez, J., to constitute a majority) (noting that \u201c[g]enerally\u201d the absence of\nSupreme Court or Tenth Circuit authority \u201cwill close the door on a claim that the\nerror at issue is clear or obvious\u201d). Furthermore, Amerson is distinguishable at\nleast on the question of whether the district court clearly or obviously erred here\nbecause it was not decided under the plain-error rubric. See 886 F.3d at 573\n(reviewing the district court\u2019s relevant-conduct determination de novo and\n                                                                          (continued...)\n\n                                          24\n\fsimilarity factor does not support his challenge to the district court\u2019s relevant-\n\nconduct determination.\n\n                                           2\n\n      \u201c\u2018To determine whether \u201cregularity\u201d is present, we inquire whether there is\n\nevidence of a regular, i.e., repeated, pattern of similar unlawful conduct\u2019 between\n\n\u2018the purported relevant conduct and the offense of conviction.\u2019\u201d United States v.\n\nDamato, 672 F.3d 832, 841 (10th Cir. 2012) (emphasis added) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Rhine, 583 F.3d 878, 889\u201390 (5th Cir. 2009)).\n\n      Mr. Garcia argues that \u201c[t]he only two incidents occurred 362 days apart,\n\nand there were no intervening instances of firearms possession on which the\n\n[district] court relied.\u201d 9 Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 12. According to Mr. Garcia,\n\n\u201c[c]ourts have found that where only two separate incidents are at issue, there is\n\nnot a significant degree of regularity.\u201d Id. at 12\u201313. But, citing our decision in\n\nSvacina, the government argues that two incidents are enough to demonstrate\n\n\n\n      8\n       (...continued)\nobserving that it was the government\u2019s burden to prove that another offense was\nrelevant conduct).\n      9\n             Mr. Garcia acknowledges that the PSR identified other instances of\nfirearm possession, but he contends that these occurred in the mid-1990s and in\n2008\u2014many years prior to the events of this case. See Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 12\nn.3; Aplt.\u2019s Reply Br. at 8. The government does not advance these instances in\nsupport of a showing of regularity, see Aplee.\u2019s Resp. Br. at 16\u201317, and we do not\nrely on them in our analysis.\n\n                                          25\n\fregularity. See Aplee\u2019s Resp. Br. at 16. Svacina\u2019s discussion of the regularity\n\nissue is brief. See 137 F.3d at 1183. However, in considering there whether a\n\ndismissed drug count qualified as relevant conduct to the drug offense of\n\nconviction, we stated, \u201c[a] comparison of the dismissed count with the count of\n\nconviction also shows that some regularity of conduct exists\u2014the minimum\n\nrequirement of two instances of conduct.\u201d Id. Quite apart from Svacina,\n\nmoreover, the government challenges the factual premise of Mr. Garcia\u2019s\n\nargument\u2014specifically, the belief that there are only two incidents at issue in the\n\nregularity analysis\u2014i.e., the firearm incidents of April 2016 and April 2017. The\n\ngovernment points out that Mr. Garcia\u2019s girlfriend told law enforcement that he\n\nhad \u201cthe rifle out\u201d six months prior to the April 2017 incident, R., Vol. II, \u00b6 8, at\n\n6, and that a plausible inference from her statement was that Mr. Garcia\n\ncontinuously possessed the rifle on each and every day during the six-month\n\nperiod preceding the April 2017 incident\u2014that is, for a six-month period falling\n\nbetween the alleged relevant conduct and the crime of conviction\u2014even if he did\n\nnot bring the rifle out, see Aplee.\u2019s Resp. Br. at 17; see id. at 10 (noting that the\n\ngirlfriend \u201creported seeing Mr. Garcia with the rifle six months earlier, indicating\n\nthat Mr. Garcia had continuously been possessing illegal firearms for at least half\n\nof the previous year\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\f      In our view, the government has the better position. We would be hard\n\npressed on these facts to conclude that a finding of regularity constitutes error, let\n\nalone clear or obvious error. We need not opine on whether Svacina\u2019s language\n\nactually stands for the proposition that two incidents of unlawful conduct,\n\nstanding alone, can display sufficient regularity. This is so because we conclude\n\nthat the district court would not have erred in rejecting Mr. Garcia\u2019s reading of\n\nthe record with respect to the regularity factor, which limited the universe of\n\nunlawful incidents to two\u2014i.e., the two instances of unlawful possession of\n\nfirearms occurring in April 2016 and April 2017. In particular, as the government\n\nsuggests, the district court would not have erred in finding based on the\n\nstatements of Mr. Garcia\u2019s girlfriend that he unlawfully possessed a firearm each\n\nand every day for a six-month period \u201cbetween \u2018the purported relevant conduct\n\nand the offense of conviction.\u2019\u201d Damato, 672 F.3d at 841 (quoting Rhine, 583\n\nF.3d at 890). And, given that \u201crepeated, pattern of similar unlawful conduct,\u201d id.,\n\nwe think it beyond dispute that the district court would not have erred in\n\ndetermining that there was ample evidence to support a finding of regularity.\n\n      To be sure, Mr. Garcia vigorously objects to our consideration of the\n\ngirlfriend\u2019s statement. Specifically, Mr. Garcia urges us to disregard his\n\ngirlfriend\u2019s statement because the district court did not refer to it at sentencing,\n\nmaking only a \u201cgeneral reference\u201d to Mr. Garcia\u2019s \u201ccontinuous course of\n\n                                           27\n\fconduct.\u201d See Aplt.\u2019s Reply Br. at 8. Further, Mr. Garcia contends that his\n\ngirlfriend\u2019s six-months-prior statement concerning his purported display of the\n\nrifle was made at the same approximate time she was \u201cdirectly contradicting her\n\nearlier statement that Mr. Garcia had his gun out on the date of the charged\n\nincident\u201d\u2014a retraction that \u201claw enforcement disbelieved.\u201d Id. We do not find\n\nthese arguments offer a cogent basis for disregarding the girlfriend\u2019s statement.\n\n      First, the fact that the district court did not specifically reference the\n\ngirlfriend\u2019s statement stands as no obstacle to our considering it in affirming the\n\ncourt\u2019s ultimate relevant-conduct determination. In this regard, it is axiomatic\n\nthat ordinarily we may affirm on \u201cany ground that finds support in the record.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Richards, 27 F.3d 465, 468 (10th Cir. 1994); accord Richison v.\n\nErnest Grp., 634 F.3d 1123, 1130 (10th Cir. 2011). Furthermore, it would be\n\nparticularly imprudent to infer from the absence of a discussion by the court\n\nconcerning the girlfriend\u2019s statement that the court did not rely on it, where it is\n\nundisputed that Mr. Garcia did not challenge the court\u2019s relevant-conduct\n\ndetermination and, consequently, did not give the court any reason to develop a\n\nrecord with some particularity regarding the variables underlying its\n\ndetermination. Cf. United States v. Howard, 784 F.3d 745, 749 (10th Cir. 2015)\n\n(\u201c[F]actual disputes regarding sentencing not brought to the attention of the\n\n\n\n\n                                           28\n\fdistrict court do not rise to the level of plain error.\u201d) (quoting United States v.\n\nLewis, 594 F.3d 1270, 1288 (10th Cir. 2010)); accord Svacina, 137 F.3d at 1187.\n\n      Second, Mr. Garcia\u2019s attack on his girlfriend\u2019s credibility does not advance\n\nhis cause. He reasons that, if the police did not believe the girlfriend\u2019s retraction\n\nregarding Mr. Garcia\u2019s having the firearm visible on the day of the April 2017\n\nincident, there was not a proper factual basis for the district court to find that her\n\nrelated statement about his possession of the firearm six months prior was\n\ncredible. However, although Mr. Garcia\u2019s girlfriend retracted her statement about\n\nthe rifle being visible during the April 2017 incident, officers believed she was\n\n\u201creluctant to tell them the whole truth\u201d because she was \u201cfrightened about what\n\n[Mr. Garcia] might do to her.\u201d R., Vol. II, \u00b6 8, at 6. One might reasonably infer\n\nfrom this that the girlfriend was motivated by a desire to downplay Mr. Garcia\u2019s\n\ncriminal conduct when she spoke to the police and that her retraction was a\n\nproduct of this motivation.\n\n      As such, it would be inconsistent with this motivation for the girlfriend to\n\nfabricate a story involving Mr. Garcia\u2019s possession of the rifle six months prior in\n\norder to inculpate him. Such a reading of the record would be questionable at the\n\nvery least. It seems much more likely that when the girlfriend told the police\n\nabout Mr. Garcia\u2019s prior possession of the rifle, she was offering them, as she\n\nperceived it, the most benign version of the facts concerning his possession of a\n\n                                           29\n\ffirearm\u2014one suggesting that he had not displayed a firearm during a domestic-\n\nviolence incident. Thus, the district court would not have erred in deeming the\n\ngirlfriend\u2019s statement credible and crediting it in assessing the regularity factor.\n\n      We underscore that we need not decide that the only plausible reading of\n\nthe record would involve crediting the girlfriend\u2019s statement. It is enough that\n\ncrediting this statement is consistent with a plausible reading of the record. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Piper, 839 F.3d 1261, 1271 (10th Cir. 2016) (\u201cIf the \u2018court\u2019s\n\naccount of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,\u2019\n\nwe may not reverse it even if we might have weighed the evidence differently.\u201d\n\n(quoting Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985))); see also\n\nUnited States v. Cortes-Gomez, 926 F.3d 699, 708 (10th Cir. 2019) (\u201cWhere there\n\nare two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them\n\ncannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d (quoting Anderson, 470 U.S. at 574)). And we\n\nconclude that this reading is plausible. Consequently, the district court\u2014based on\n\nthe girlfriend\u2019s statement\u2014would not have erred in finding that Mr. Garcia\n\nunlawfully possessed a firearm each and every day for a six-month period\n\n\u201cbetween \u2018the purported relevant conduct and the offense of conviction.\u2019\u201d\n\nDamato, 672 F.3d at 841 (emphasis added) (quoting Rhine, 583 F.3d at 890).\n\nAnd this finding would have provided ample evidence for a regularity\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\fdetermination. Therefore, the district court did not commit error here, let alone\n\nclear or obvious error. 10\n\n                                          3\n\n       Finally, Mr. Garcia argues that the time interval between the events of\n\nApril 2016 and April 2017 was too great to support a finding of relevant conduct.\n\n\n       10\n         It bears noting that even were we to accept Mr. Garcia\u2019s reading of the\nrecord\u2014wherein there are only two unlawful firearms incidents that are separated\nby a little less than one year (i.e., in April 2016 and April 2017)\u2014and even were\nwe to conclude that the district court erred in its regularity determination, Mr.\nGarcia\u2019s showing of clear or obvious error would come up short. Mr. Garcia does\nnot direct us to any controlling authority that has refused to find regularity under\nsimilar circumstances because there were only two unlawful incidents. Instead,\nhe relies on (1) a Sixth Circuit case, (2) an unpublished District of New Mexico\ncase, and (3) two Tenth Circuit cases, i.e., Windle and Roederer, where regularity\nwas present based on five or eight instances of conduct, respectively. This\nauthority does not establish that the district court would have clearly or obviously\nerred on the regularity question. First of all, the cited Tenth Circuit cases lend\nMr. Garcia no succor. The fact that more than two instances of unlawful conduct\nwere sufficient in Windle and Roederer to establish regularity says virtually\nnothing about whether more than two instances would be necessary to show\nregularity. See, e.g., United States v. Burkholder, 816 F.3d 607, 620 n.10 (10th\nCir. 2016) (\u201cAn event or condition is sufficient if its existence means that another\nevent or condition will occur. An event or condition is necessary if, in its\nabsence, another event or condition could not occur.\u201d). Neither by their express\nterms nor, as a matter of simple logic, do these cases stand for the latter\nproposition (i.e., that more than two instances is necessary). Moreover, as set\nforth previously, ordinarily only Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit precedent can\ndefine well-settled law for purposes of the clear-or-obvious standard of the plain-\nerror test, so Mr. Garcia\u2019s reliance on cases from the Sixth Circuit and the New\nMexico district court do not avail him. In sum, even were we to accept Mr.\nGarcia\u2019s view of the record, and conclude that the district court\u2019s decision reflects\nan erroneous finding regarding the regularity factor, Mr. Garcia would not be able\nto make a showing of clear or obvious error.\n\n                                         31\n\fAplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 13. The government argues that this court has not set a\n\nbright-line rule to follow in evaluating this factor but the \u201cgeneral rule appears to\n\nbe that offenses occurring within six months of each other have a strong temporal\n\nlink and temporal proximity is sufficient for offenses occurring up to five years\n\napart if evidence of the other two factors is also present.\u201d See Aplee.\u2019s Resp. Br.\n\nat 18\u201320.\n\n      Our most in-depth analysis of temporality came in Damato, where we\n\nconsidered allegedly relevant conduct that predated the offense conduct by over\n\nthirteen years:\n\n             None of the cases cited by the government contain such a\n             lengthy gap between potentially relevant conduct and the\n             crime of conviction, nor have we discovered any in our\n             independent research. In fact, we have been unable to uncover\n             a case holding that conduct even half as temporally distant\n             qualifies as relevant conduct. The largest time difference we\n             have observed in the case law is the five-year interval at issue\n             in Roederer, 11 F.3d 973.\n\n             Further, the five-year delay in Roederer appears to be an\n             outlier. We have described a \u201cfifteen month interval\u201d as\n             \u201ctemporally distant.\u201d United States v. Clark, 415 F.3d 1234,\n             1242 (10th Cir. 2005). Other circuits have held that temporal\n             gaps as brief as five months cut against a finding that an\n             activity was part of the same course of conduct as the offense\n             of conviction. See United States v. Hahn, 960 F.2d 903,\n             910\u201311 (9th Cir. 1992) (five-month gap is \u201crelatively\n             remote\u201d); See also United States v.

With this consensus in mind,\n            it clearly follows that the thirteen-year interval between the\n            1990 transaction and Damato\u2019s offense of conviction is\n            extraordinary. Given this extreme lack of temporal proximity,\n            the 1990 transaction may not be treated as relevant conduct\n            unless one of the other factors\u2014regularity or similarity\u2014is\n            \u201cauthoritatively present.\u201d United States v. Miller, 179 F.3d\n            961, 967 n. 10 (5th Cir. 1999); See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 app.\n            n.9(B) (\u201cWhen one of the above factors is absent, a stronger\n            presence of at least one of the other factors is required.\u201d).\n\n672 F.3d at 840\u201341 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).\n\n      Even under the reading of the record most favorable to Mr. Garcia\u2014which\n\nwe accept for purposes of analyzing the temporal-proximity factor\u2014the operative\n\n                                         33\n\fgap of time is a little less than one year, specifically, the period between the April\n\n2016 incident and the April 2017 offense of conviction. 11 Guided by Damato, we\n\nhave no difficulty concluding that, at the very least, the district court would not\n\nhave clearly or obviously erred in finding that this gap was not too remote. In\n\nother words, it would not have been clear or obvious error for the court to find\n\nthat the temporal gap between the two events was sufficiently close to support a\n\nsame-course-of-conduct determination.\n\n      In particular, Mr. Garcia has cited no controlling precedent from the\n\nSupreme Court or the Tenth Circuit that establishes that a temporal gap of nearly\n\none year would eviscerate, as a matter of law, a showing of temporal proximity.\n\nAnd we are not aware of any. This effectively sounds the death knell for his\n\ntemporal-proximity challenge on plain-error review. See Ruiz-Gea, 340 F.3d at\n\n      11\n              The government briefly suggests that the relevant temporal gap may\nbe less than one year because the \u201cevidence indicates that [Mr. Garcia] continued\nto illegally possess firearms less than six months after his 2016 arrest.\u201d Aplee.\u2019s\nResp. Br. at 20. Presumably, the government is alluding to the testimony of Mr.\nGarcia\u2019s girlfriend that Mr. Garcia had \u201cthe rifle out\u201d six months prior to the\nApril 2017 incident. R., Vol. II, \u00b6 8, at 6. However, the government does not\ndevelop this argument, and it would be improper for us to flesh it out.\nAccordingly, we are disinclined to comment on the merits of it. Cf. United States\nv. Ray, 899 F.3d 852, 858 (10th Cir. 2018) (ruling that party who \u201cfails to develop\nor provide any authority\u201d in support of his argument \u201cwaived\u201d it), cert. denied,\n139 S.

In any event, for reasons explicated infra, even under the\nview of the record most favorable to him, Mr. Garcia cannot prevail under the\napplicable plain-error standard.\n\n                                          34\n\f1187; accord Thornburgh, 645 F.3d at 1208. But, making matters worse for Mr.\n\nGarcia, the federal circuit courts have no uniform view that is favorable to him\n\nconcerning when the temporal gap is too wide to support a same-course-of-\n\nconduct determination. See United States v. Wolfname, 835 F.3d 1214, 1221\n\n(10th Cir. 2006) (\u201c[W]e agree that if neither this court nor the Supreme Court has\n\ndirectly addressed a particular issue, then a circuit split on that issue weighs\n\nagainst a finding of plain error.\u201d (emphasis added)); United States v. Teague, 443\n\nF.3d 1310, 1319 (10th Cir. 2006) (\u201cIf neither the Supreme Court nor the Tenth\n\nCircuit has ruled on the subject, we cannot find plain error if the authority in\n\nother circuits is split.\u201d (emphasis added)). To the contrary, as Damato indicates,\n\nthe \u201cconsensus\u201d among our sister circuits actually undercuts Mr. Garcia\u2019s position\n\nbecause it only deems impermissible temporal gaps that exceed one year. 672\n\nF.3d at 841. And, of course, under Mr. Garcia\u2019s reading of the record, the\n\ntemporal gap here is a little less than one year.\n\n      We recognize that Mr. Garcia marshals our decision in United States v.\n\nCuthbertson, 138 F.3d 1325 (10th Cir. 1998). There, we affirmed a district\n\ncourt\u2019s finding that a 1995 state sexual-battery offense was not relevant conduct\n\nto a 1994 federal conviction of transporting a juvenile in interstate commerce\n\nwith intent to engage in criminal sexual activity because \u201cthese two acts occurred\n\non different occasions, separated by a temporal gap of almost a year, and involved\n\n                                          35\n\f\u2018multiple, separate instances of fear and harm.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1327 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7\n\n3D1.2 cmt. n.4). However, the Cuthbertson panel expressly ruled that the same-\n\ncourse-of-conduct framework was not applicable in that case because the\n\ndefendant\u2019s federal offense was not groupable and, thus, took a different\n\nanalytical route through the relevant-conduct rubric than we do here. Id.\n\nTherefore, Cuthbertson is inapposite.\n\n      In sum, even under his view of the record, Mr. Garcia cannot demonstrate\n\nthat a finding of temporal proximity would constitute clear or obvious error.\n\n                                         4\n\n      Based on the foregoing analysis, we conclude that the district court did not\n\ncommit reversible error under the plain-error rubric in determining that the April\n\n2016 incident was relevant conduct with regard to the April 2017 incident\u2014i.e.,\n\nthe incident giving rise to Mr. Garcia\u2019s felon-in-possession conviction. The\n\nGuidelines commentary contemplates that, if one of the three factors that it\n\nspecifies is \u201cabsent\u201d that courts may nevertheless determine that the conduct at\n\nissue is relevant conduct under the same-course-of-conduct standard, if there is \u201ca\n\nstronger presence of at least one of the other factors.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt.\n\nn.5(B)(ii); see Damato, 672 F.3d at 841 (\u201cGiven this extreme lack of temporal\n\nproximity, the 1990 transaction may not be treated as relevant conduct unless one\n\nof the other factors\u2014regularity or similarity\u2014is \u2018authoritatively present.\u2019\u201d\n\n                                         36\n\f(emphasis added) (quoting Miller, 179 F.3d at 967 n.10)). However, we have no\n\nneed to conduct such a strong-presence assessment here because, at the very least,\n\nthe district court would not have clearly or obviously erred in finding that all\n\nthree factors were present.\n\n      In sum, concerning the district court\u2019s relevant-conduct determination, Mr.\n\nGarcia cannot demonstrate, as he must, that the court erred under the plain-error\n\nrubric. Therefore, we reject this challenge to the court\u2019s sentence. We now turn\n\nto Mr. Garcia\u2019s remaining sentencing challenge.\n\n                                         III\n\n      Mr. Garcia also argues that his ninety-six-month sentence is substantively\n\nunreasonable.

However, this assessment is not supported by the\n\nrecord. As Mr. Garcia reasons, his \u201ctroubling violent criminal episodes\u201d were\n\nlimited to his teenage years, and, within the fifteen years preceding his instant\n\noffense, his only non-traffic-related convictions were for drug possession and\n\npossession of stolen firearms.

He contends that, in taking into\n\nconsideration the crimes from Mr. Garcia\u2019s \u201cteenaged years\u201d and early adulthood,\n\nin formulating its characterization of his history as \u201cviolent,\u201d the district court\n\n      11\n              Because we have rejected Mr. Garcia\u2019s arguments concerning the\ncalculation of the Guidelines range, then the range that the court calculated and\nthe actual sentence that the court ultimately imposed are the relevant comparators.\nWe also observe that, although Mr. Garcia characterizes his actual sentence as\n\u201cmore than twice\u201d or \u201cmore than double\u201d a low-end Guidelines sentence, Aplt.\u2019s\nOpening Br. at 18, 21, we typically compare the high end of the Guidelines range\nto the actual sentence imposed in doing our substantive-reasonableness analysis,\nsee United States v.

Here, the\ndistrict court\u2019s sentence exceeded the high end of the Guidelines range by thirty-\nnine months\u2014that is, an increase of approximately sixty-eight percent over the\nhigh end of Guidelines range.\n\n                                          39\n\feffectively expressed \u201ca policy disagreement\u201d with the Guidelines, which limit\n\nhow far back a sentencing court can go in assigning criminal-history points to\n\n\u201cconvictions for purposes of recidivist enhancements.\u201d Id. at 20. Consequently,\n\nhe contends that the court\u2019s variance\u2014which ostensibly is \u201cgrounded in\u201d this\n\ndisagreement\u2014\u201cshould be subject to a heightened level of review.\u201d 12 Id.

Indeed, the\n\ncourt did not have to rely on remote events to validate its concern that Mr. Garcia\n\nwas prone to violence and, on this basis, a danger to the public.

R., Vol. III, at\n\n62\u201363.\n\n      Moreover, the true central focus of the court\u2019s analysis was Mr. Garcia\u2019s\n\nlongstanding, flagrant, and serious disregard for the law and, more specifically,\n\nthe fact that this lawlessness posed a particular danger to the public. As to that\n\ndanger, the court noted Mr. Garcia\u2019s repeated, unlawful possession of inherently\n\ndangerous firearms and apparent mental-health problems. A brief excerpt of the\n\ncourt\u2019s remarks makes the point:\n\n             [W]e have had multiple instances of [Mr. Garcia] dealing with\n             guns over an extended period of time and all subsequent to an\n             early felony conviction many years ago, [which] suggests to me\n             that we have a very serious set of circumstances here because, as\n             counsel for the [g]overnment has suggested, there has been a\n             long, more or less continuous history of law-breaking by [Mr.\n             Garcia].\n\n                   But it appears that throughout virtually the entire period of\n             his adult life, when he\u2019s committed these other crimes, he\u2019s also\n             had guns around. So this circumstance here is, in my view, a\n             very serious offense.\n\n                   I\u2019m required to consider [Mr. Garcia\u2019s history]. The most\n             pertinent thing, of course, is that he does have a long, pretty\n             much continuous history of breaking the law, criminal\n             convictions for one thing or another.\n\n                    ....\n\n\n\n\n                                             41\n\f                    [Mr. Garcia] appears to have mental health issues of some\n             sort, at least in the sense of anger management -- maybe more\n             serious than that -- that also, I think, contributes to the\n             seriousness of what we\u2019re dealing with here.\n\n                    [The government] has mentioned the factor that I think is\n             probably the most important of the statutory factors. In some\n             cases, it\u2019s not the most important, but here I think it probably is.\n             That\u2019s the need to protect the public from further crimes of [Mr.\n             Garcia].\n\nId. at 63\u201364 (emphases added).\n\n      Thus, as this quotation illustrates, the court\u2019s central focus was not Mr.\n\nGarcia\u2019s remote crimes of violence per se, but rather his longstanding pattern of\n\nflagrant and serious disregard for the law of which those crimes were a part. In\n\nthat vein, although the court did expressly note that Mr. Garcia\u2019s criminal history\n\nindicated that \u201csome of [his] convictions [were] for violent conduct,\u201d reflecting\n\n\u201ca very serious streak of violent conduct,\u201d the court did not lose sight of the fact\n\nthat these violent episodes were \u201ca part of the broader range of criminal activity\u201d\n\nthat Mr. Garcia perpetrated over many years. Id.\n\n      Taking into consideration Mr. Garcia\u2019s longstanding pattern of flagrant and\n\nserious disregard for the law\u2014frequently including his unlawful possession of\n\nfirearms\u2014and the record evidence (recounted supra) concerning his seemingly\n\nserious mental-health problems, we find that the district was not unreasonable in\n\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\freaching the conclusion that the public needed to be protected from Mr. Garcia by\n\na lengthy term of imprisonment:\n\n                    So I think there is a substantial need to protect the public\n             from the risk of further criminal activity of [Mr. Garcia], partly\n             reflected by the repetitive nature of his criminal activity\n             generally, but also from the repetitive nature of these situations\n             where he\u2019s illegally possessing a firearm and, in some cases, it\n             appears, using it. So all of that adds to the seriousness here.\n\nId. at 64\u201365 (emphasis added).\n\n      Furthermore, insofar as the district court did take into account, in imposing\n\nits upward variance, the fact that Mr. Garcia\u2019s Guidelines criminal-history score\n\ndid not fully reflect the length and severity of his youthful criminal record, the\n\ncourt would not have been expressing a policy disagreement with the Guidelines.\n\nIndeed, the drafters of the Guidelines themselves have recognized that their\n\ncriminal-history computation scheme may not always fully reflect the seriousness\n\nof an offender\u2019s criminal background and that, in such circumstances, action to\n\nelevate sentences above the otherwise applicable Guidelines range may be\n\nappropriate. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 (\u201cIf reliable information indicates that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the\n\nseriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the\n\ndefendant will commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.\u201d\n\n(emphases added)). Instead of disagreeing with the Guidelines, the court would\n\n\n                                          43\n\fhave been endeavoring to faithfully discharge its statutory responsibility to\n\nensure, among other things, that Mr. Garcia\u2019s sentence has the effect of\n\n\u201cprotect[ing] the public from further crimes.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C); see\n\nUnited States v. Shaw, 471 F.3d 1136, 1141 (10th Cir. 2006) (\u201c[W]here the court\n\nconcludes that the Guidelines inadequately reflect a defendant\u2019s criminal history\n\nor the seriousness of the offense, a deviation may be appropriate.\u201d); see also\n\nUnited States v. Adams, 751 F.3d 1175, 1183 (10th Cir. 2014) (\u201c[I]nsofar as\n\nDefendant is contending that the district court improperly varied upward in\n\nincreasing his sentence, our response can be brief. For the reasons expressed by\n\nthe district court\u2014particularly Defendant\u2019s history of repeated criminal\n\noffenses\u2014his sentence satisfied the reasonableness standard for substantive\n\nreview of a sentence.\u201d). Thus, Mr. Garcia\u2019s assertion that the district court\n\neffectively acted on a policy disagreement with the Guidelines is without merit,\n\nand we reject his related call for the application of a heightened level of review of\n\nthe court\u2019s upward variance. In sum, for the foregoing reasons, we find Mr.\n\nGarcia\u2019s first argument unpersuasive.\n\n      His second argument fares no better. Relying on statistics from the United\n\nStates Sentencing Commission, Mr. Garcia asserts that his sentence was \u201cfar\n\noutside the norm\u201d and suggests that it creates an unwarranted disparity with\n\nnationwide sentences of offenders convicted of similar firearms offenses.

Specifically, referencing fiscal year 2017, Mr. Garcia\n\nhighlights the following: (1) the median sentence for firearms offenders in the\n\nTenth Circuit was forty months, with a mean sentence of fifty-nine months; (2)\n\nonly sixty offenders, or one percent of all defendants sentenced in the Tenth\n\nCircuit, received any upward variance; and (3) nationally, the median sentencing\n\nincrease above the Guidelines range for firearms defendants receiving a variance\n\nunder \u00a7 3553 was twenty-one months, or 31.6 percent above the Guidelines range.\n\nId. at 22.\n\n       It is unquestionably true that under \u00a7 3553(a)(6), a sentencing court must\n\nconsider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants\n\nwith similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C.\n\n3553(a)(6) (emphasis added). And we have specifically noted that \u201c[t]he need to\n\navoid unwarranted disparities is a critical sentencing factor.\u201d United States v.\n\nLente, 647 F.3d 1021, 1039 (10th Cir. 2011) However, Mr. Garcia\u2019s statistics do\n\nnot advance his cause.\n\n       Insofar as he relies on statistics stemming only from Tenth Circuit\n\nsentences, his argument plainly does not implicate the kind of disparities that\n\n\u00a7 3553(a)(6) seeks to avoid\u2014that is, nationwide disparities. See United States v.\n\n                                         45\n\fFranklin, 785 F.3d 1365, 1371 (10th Cir. 2015) (\u201cThe purpose of the sentencing\n\nguidelines is \u2018to eliminate disparities among sentences nationwide.\u2019\u201d (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Zapata, 546 F.3d 1179, 1194 (10th Cir. 2008))); accord Adams,\n\n751 F.3d at 1183; Damato, 672 F.3d at 848.\n\n      And, to the extent that he offers nationwide statistics, as the government\n\nrightly suggests, Mr. Garcia does not place them in a meaningful \u201ccontext.\u201d\n\nAplee.\u2019s Resp. Br. at 27. Specifically, as its plain terms indicate, the pertinent\n\ncomparators under \u00a7 3553(a)(6) are similarly situated defendants, and Mr.\n\nGarcia\u2019s bare national statistics do not shed light on the extent to which the\n\nsentences that the statistics pertain to involve defendants that are similarly\n\nsituated to Mr. Garcia. See, e.g., United States v. Joubert, 778 F.3d 247, 256 (1st\n\nCir. 2015) (\u201cBy pointing to national statistics, Joubert compares the sentence for\n\nhis unique offense to the average sentence for others convicted under the same\n\nfederal statute. A range of conduct is covered under criminal statutes like 18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251(a) [and] 2252A(a)(5)(B). This comparison is thus unhelpful for\n\ndetermining the substantive reasonableness of Joubert\u2019s sentence for his unique\n\ncrime.\u201d). In particular, his national statistics do not reveal what percentage of\n\nthose defendants have a similar criminal background to Mr. Garcia\u2019s\u2014notably,\n\nwhether those defendants have been involved in a similar longstanding pattern of\n\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\fflagrant and serious lawbreaking, which not infrequently involved unlawful\n\npossession of inherently dangerous firearms.\n\n      Here, the district court correctly computed and carefully considered the\n\nGuidelines range and, in doing so, \u201cnecessarily gave significant weight and\n\nconsideration to the need to avoid unwarranted disparities.\u201d Franklin, 785 F.3d at\n\n1371 (quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at 59); accord United States v. Gantt, 679 F.3d\n\n1240, 1249 (10th Cir. 2012). And, in light of Mr. Garcia\u2019s extensive and\n\ntroubling criminal history, we conclude that the court \u201creasonably believed that\n\nDefendant\u2019s criminal history was more serious than his guidelines range would\n\nindicate.\u201d Adams, 751 F.3d at 1183. Moreover, the court\u2019s explanation leaves us\n\nwith no doubt that the length of the non-Guidelines sentence that it imposed on\n\nMr. Garcia was reasonably calculated to be \u201csufficient, but not greater than\n\nnecessary\u201d to satisfy the sentencing considerations embodied in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), see\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u2014notably, the need \u201cto protect the public from further crimes\n\nof [Mr. Garcia],\u201d id. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). In other words, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Mr. Garcia and that his\n\nsentence is substantively reasonable.\n\n                                          IV\n\n      In light of the foregoing, we reject Mr. Garcia\u2019s challenges and AFFIRM\n\nhis sentence.\n\n                                          47\n\f",
