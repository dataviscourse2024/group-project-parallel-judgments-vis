BOYLE, District Judge:\n\n      Juan Carlos Ortega-Calderon appeals his sentence, arguing that the\ndistrict court erred by relying on a docket sheet and a Disposition of Arrest and\nCourt Action to impose a sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.\nBecause the evidence bears \u201csufficient indicia of reliability,\u201d we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n      *   District Judge of the Northern District of Texas, sitting by designation.\n\f    Case: 14-40889    Document: 00513397853     Page: 2   Date Filed: 02/26/2016\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-40889\n                                       I.\n\n      In March 2014, a federal grand jury indicted Defendant-Appellant Juan\nCarlos Ortega-Calderon for unlawful presence in the United States after\nprevious deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)\u2013(b). Without the benefit\nof a plea agreement, Ortega-Calderon pleaded guilty to the sole count of the\nindictment.\n\n      The probation office\u2019s presentence report (PSR) recommended, inter alia,\na twelve-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), based on a\n2003 California felony conviction for assault with a deadly weapon. Ortega-\nCalderon objected to this proposed enhancement and requested that the\nprobation office produce a charging instrument, judgment, and any other\ndocuments relevant to the 2003 conviction. The probation office did not produce\nthe charging instrument or a judgment, but it did attach two documents as an\naddendum to the PSR: a \u201cDisposition of Arrest and Court Action\u201d and a twenty-\npage docket sheet, both of which indicated that, in 2003, an individual named\nJuan Ortega Calderon pleaded nolo contendere to violating Cal. Penal Code\n\u00a7 245(a)(1) (assault with a deadly weapon) and was convicted.\n\n      At sentencing, Ortega-Calderon again objected to the enhancement,\ninsinuating that these two documents were not sufficiently reliable to justify\nthe enhancement. He nonetheless conceded that the information contained in\nthe PSR was accurate. After a colloquy with the probation officer regarding the\ndocuments, the district court found that they proved the existence of the 2003\nconviction by a preponderance of the evidence, and the court applied the\ntwelve-level enhancement. All told, Ortega-Calderon was sentenced to thirty\nmonths\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 14-40889     Document: 00513397853      Page: 3    Date Filed: 02/26/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-40889\n                                        II.\n\n      At the outset, we must determine what standard of review applies in this\ncase. The parties disagree on this point. Ortega-Calderon proposes that we\nreview the district court\u2019s reliability determination de novo, while the\nGovernment suggests a clear error standard. Finding that our precedents do\nnot plainly answer this question, we hold that a district court\u2019s conclusion that\nevidence submitted to prove the fact of a prior conviction bears \u201csufficient\nindicia of reliability,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a), is reviewed for clear error.\n\n      To support his position, Ortega-Calderon relies on United States v.\nMartinez-Cortez, 988 F.2d 1408 (5th Cir. 1993), which states that \u201cwhether\nprior convictions have been proved sufficiently for purposes of sentence\nenhancement is a question of law; thus, review is de novo.\u201d Id. at 1410, 1415.\nAt first blush, this language appears to favor Ortega-Calderon. Martinez-\nCortez, however, involved a very different question: whether the evidence used\nto prove the defendant\u2019s prior state burglary conviction passed muster under\nTaylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990).\n\n      In Taylor, the Supreme Court addressed a sentencing enhancement\nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), which applies when a defendant \u201chas three\nprevious convictions by any court . . . for a violent felony or a serious drug\noffense, or both.\u201d \u201cViolent felony\u201d includes burglary, but the statute does not\ndefine the latter term. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Noting that the elements of\nburglary varied by state, the Court first defined \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d as relevant\nfor sentencing enhancements under \u00a7 924(e); it then concluded that a state\nburglary conviction would justify the enhancement \u201cif either its statutory\ndefinition substantially corresponds to \u2018generic\u2019 burglary, or the charging\npaper and jury instructions actually required the jury to find all the elements\n\n                                         3\n\f     Case: 14-40889       Document: 00513397853         Page: 4     Date Filed: 02/26/2016\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-40889\nof generic burglary in order to convict the defendant.\u201d Taylor, 495 U.S. at 599\u2013\n602. A Taylor inquiry, then, turns on the legal question of whether a\ndefendant\u2019s state conviction qualifies as a \u201cgeneric burglary,\u201d which is\namenable to de novo review.\n\n       Martinez-Cortez itself supports this conclusion. There, a panel of this\nCourt considered whether the Government\u2019s proof of the defendant\u2019s burglary\nconviction    comported       with    Taylor\u2019s    requirements\u2014namely,            that    the\nGovernment either introduce \u201c(1) the fact of the prior conviction (presumably\nby introducing a certified or validated copy of the judgment) and (2) a true copy\nof the state statute under which the conviction was attained,\u201d or show that the\nelements of defendant\u2019s conviction matched those of \u201cgeneric burglary.\u201d\nMartinez-Cortez, 988 F.2d at 1411\u201312. Thus, this Court was reviewing the\nsufficiency of the evidence supporting the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that\nthe defendant\u2019s conviction was a \u201cgeneric burglary.\u201d\n\n       We have recognized the distinction between the legal inquiry at the heart\nof Taylor and the factual question of whether a defendant has been convicted\u2014\nperiod. See United States v. Neri-Hernandes, 504 F.3d 587, 591 (5th Cir. 2007).\nWhen seeking only to prove the mere fact of a conviction, rather than its\nelements or underlying facts, the Government need not adhere to the stringent\nrequirements of Taylor or Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005). Neri-\nHernandes, 504 F.3d at 591. The strict standard of review that applies in those\ncases is likewise inapposite here. In short, Martinez-Cortez is not controlling. 1\n\n\n       1Ortega-Calderon\u2019s other arguments\u2014first, that factual conclusions based on written\nevidence must be reviewed de novo, and second, that Neri-Hernandes and United States v.\nZuniga-Chavez, 464 F.3d 1199 (10th Cir. 2006), support de novo review here\u2014are similarly\nunavailing. Factual determinations based on written evidence have received clear error\nreview since Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S. 564, 574\u201375 (1985), and neither\nNeri-Hernandes nor Zuniga-Chavez identifies the applicable standard of review.\n                                              4\n\f     Case: 14-40889        Document: 00513397853          Page: 5     Date Filed: 02/26/2016\n\n\n\n                                        No. 14-40889\n         Clear error review, on the other hand, finds support in our case law. In\nUnited States v. Taylor, 277 F.3d 721 (5th Cir. 2001), we declared that a\n\u201cdistrict court\u2019s reliance on a PSR for the quantity of drugs is based . . . on a\nfinding of fact that the PSR\u2019s information contains an indicia of reliability and\nshould be reviewed for clear error.\u201d Id. at 724. In other words, the\ndetermination that evidence supporting a disputed fact bears \u201csufficient\nindicia of reliability\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a) is a factual one, subject to clear\nerror review. 2 Other cases bear out this reading: in United States v. Gomez-\nAlvarez, 781 F.3d 787 (5th Cir. 2015), for instance, we reviewed for clear error\na conclusion that the defendant was in fact the person named in a state court\ncomplaint and abstract of judgment. Id. at 796.\n\n         We find this appeal to be materially indistinguishable from those cases.\nOrtega-Calderon contests the reliability of the evidence\u2014the two documents\u2014\nused to prove the fact of his 2003 conviction and, as a result, enhance his\nsentence. This is analogous to the defendant\u2019s challenge in Taylor\u2014that the\nPSR used to support his sentence enhancement was unreliable. In both cases,\nthe district court credited contested evidence to support a factual finding upon\nwhich it relied to impose a particular sentence. There is no principled reason\nto impose a different standard of review in one case than the other.\nAccordingly, we review the district court\u2019s determination of reliability for clear\nerror.\n\n\n\n         Although a PSR is entitled to a presumption of reliability, see United States v. Alaniz,\n         2\n\n726 F.3d 586, 619 (5th Cir. 2013), this fact is relevant only to the weight of different types of\nevidence supporting a disputed fact; it does not affect whether the determination of the\nevidence\u2019s reliability is a factual or legal one. Clear error review is therefore not limited to\nfactual findings made in reliance on a PSR. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a) (\u201cIn resolving any dispute\nconcerning a factor important to the sentencing determination, the court may consider\nrelevant information . . . provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to\nsupport its probable accuracy.\u201d (emphasis added)).\n                                               5\n\f     Case: 14-40889      Document: 00513397853        Page: 6     Date Filed: 02/26/2016\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-40889\n                                           III.\n\n      Moving to the merits of the appeal, Ortega-Calderon contends that the\ndistrict court clearly erred by relying on the docket sheet and Disposition of\nArrest and Court Action to find that he had previously been convicted of a\ncrime of violence, 3 and then to enhance his sentence. We disagree, and\ntherefore affirm his sentence.\n\n                                            A.\n\n      Ortega-Calderon points to our decision in Neri-Hernandes for the\nproposition that records offered to prove the existence of a prior conviction\nmust, at a minimum, be \u201cobtained from a state court and prepared by a clerk.\u201d\nNeri-Hernandes, 504 F.3d at 591 (quoting Zuniga-Chavez, 464 F.3d at 1205).\nSince the documents in this case were not shown to fulfill either requirement,\nhe continues, his sentence should be overturned. But such a restrictive rule is\nat odds with both Neri-Hernandes itself and the Sentencing Guidelines. We\ntherefore decline to adopt it.\n\n                                            1.\n\n      In Neri-Hernandes, we affirmed a crime of violence enhancement based\non a previous conviction, which the Government proved using Certificates of\nDisposition from New York. The Certificates bore sufficient indicia of\nreliability, in part because they \u201cconstitute[d] presumptive evidence of the\nfacts stated in such certificate\u201d in New York. Id. at 592 (quoting United States\nv. Green, 480 F.3d 627, 632 (2d Cir. 2007)). In reaching this conclusion, we cited\n\n\n      3   Ortega-Calderon concedes that assault with a deadly weapon under Cal. Penal Code\n\u00a7 245(a)(1) qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines. He challenges only the\nreliability of the evidence used to prove the conviction exists.\n                                            6\n\f    Case: 14-40889     Document: 00513397853     Page: 7   Date Filed: 02/26/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-40889\nthe language from Zuniga-Chavez upon which Ortega-Calderon now relies. Id.\nat 591. But our approval of that case was a far cry from establishing a rule for\ndetermining when evidence of a prior conviction is reliable. Rather, Zuniga-\nChavez illustrated the distinction between a Shepard inquiry, where the\nGovernment must prove the facts underlying a conviction, versus merely\nproving that a conviction exists. Id. at 591\u201392. This distinction helped the\nCourt focus on the operative question: \u201cwhether the New York Certificates of\nDisposition ha[d] sufficient indicia of reliability to support their probable\naccuracy such that the documents c[ould] be used as evidence of [the\ndefendant\u2019s] prior conviction.\u201d Id. In other words, the issue in Neri-Herndandes\nwas whether the Certificates were reliable, and not whether they had been\nprepared by a clerk and obtained from a state court.\n\n      Zuniga-Chavez, upon which Ortega-Calderon also relies, helps him even\nless. There, the Tenth Circuit stated that \u201c[a] case summary obtained from a\nstate court and prepared by a clerk\u2014even if not certified by that court\u2014may\nbe sufficiently reliable evidence of conviction for purposes of enhancing a\nfederal sentence where the defendant fails to put forward any persuasive\ncontradictory evidence.\u201d 464 F.3d at 1205. But the court was simply addressing\nthe specific situation before it, where the Government had presented\nuncertified case summaries, obtained from a California state court, to prove\nthe defendant\u2019s convictions. Id. at 1204. In fact, the court acknowledged that\n\u201creliability\u2014not certification\u2014is the key for determining the sufficiency of\nevidence of a prior conviction.\u201d Id. In both cases, then, the \u201ccase summary\nobtained from a state court and prepared by a clerk\u201d was simply an example of\na document with sufficient indicia of reliability, rather than a baseline. Neither\ncase requires the Government to provide the proof Ortega-Calderon seeks.\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\f    Case: 14-40889     Document: 00513397853      Page: 8    Date Filed: 02/26/2016\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-40889\n                                         2.\n\n      Limiting the Government to presenting only state court documents\nprepared by court clerks would also go against the requirements of the\nSentencing Guidelines. In cases with disputed facts, the Guidelines require\nonly that the evidence considered by the sentencing court have \u201csufficient\nindicia of reliability\u201d; they do not require that these indicia come in a particular\nform. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a); see also United States v. Bermea, 30 F.3d 1539, 1576\n(5th Cir. 1994) (\u201cReasonable reliability is all that is required by \u00a7 6A1.3(a).\u201d).\nTo adopt Ortega-Calderon\u2019s rule would thus impose a standard of proof above\nand beyond what the statute requires.\n\n      Furthermore, the Sentencing Guidelines explicitly disavow applying\n\u201cthe rules of evidence applicable at trial.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a). Here, Ortega-\nCalderon essentially brings an authentication challenge\u2014he argues that the\ndocuments in question are not sufficiently reliable to determine that they are\nwhat they purport to be: records of his conviction. See Fed. R. Evid. 901(a). The\nFederal Rules of Evidence, however, permit authentication by any \u201cevidence\nsufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\u201d\nId. Included in Rule 901\u2019s non-exhaustive list of authentication examples is\none for public records, which can be authenticated by evidence that either \u201ca\ndocument was recorded or filed in a public office as authorized by law; or . . . a\npurported public record or statement is from the office where items of this kind\nare kept.\u201d Fed.

Restricting the acceptable \u201cindicia of\nreliability\u201d to proof that the records were \u201cobtained from a state court and\nprepared by a clerk\u201d would therefore be even less permissive than the Federal\n\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f     Case: 14-40889      Document: 00513397853        Page: 9    Date Filed: 02/26/2016\n\n\n\n                                     No. 14-40889\nRules of Evidence. 4 We cannot accept such an incongruous result, and\naccordingly reject Ortega-Calderon\u2019s argument.\n\n                                           B.\n\n      Turning to the district court\u2019s determination in this case\u2014that the\ndocket sheet and Disposition of Arrest and Court Action were sufficiently\nreliable to justify the enhancement\u2014we find no clear error. As the district\ncourt found, the docket report contains a significant amount of detail regarding\nthe proceedings in the 2003 case, and the two documents strongly corroborate\none another. Both identify the defendant as \u201cJuan Ortega Calderon,\u201d indicate\nthat he pleaded nolo contendere to a single charge of assault with a deadly\nweapon, and show he was sentenced to 180 days in jail and thirty-six months\u2019\nprobation. This evidence is sufficient to withstand our scrutiny.\n\n      This result aligns with our unpublished decision in United States v.\nMazarego-Salazar, 590 F. App\u2019x 345 (5th Cir. 2014), which also affirmed a\nsentencing enhancement based on a crime of violence. In that case, the district\ncourt had relied on \u201ca two-page printed form\u201d with the heading \u201cSupreme Court\nof the State of New York.\u201d Id. at 348. An unidentified individual had filled in\nthe form to indicate that the defendant had pleaded guilty to second degree\nassault, and a trial court judge had signed it. Id. Recognizing that we had\npreviously approved the use of \u201cclerical-type documents\u201d to \u201cprove the basis of\nthe underlying conviction,\u201d this Court upheld the district court\u2019s sentencing\nenhancement. Id. at 348\u201349. The documents in this case are at least as reliable\nas the one approved in Mazarego-Salazar, so the district court\u2019s decision to rely\n\n\n      4 We emphasize that our decision does not suggest incorporating the Federal Rules of\nEvidence into sentencing proceedings. Both the Guidelines and the Rules flatly contradict\nsuch a result. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a); Fed. R.

In\nfact, when questioned about the PSR, he admitted it was accurate. We have\npreviously refused to find evidence of a prior conviction to be unreliable when\nthe defendant has not come forward with contrary proof, and we do so again\nhere.
