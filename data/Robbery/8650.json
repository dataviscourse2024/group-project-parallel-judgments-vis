BOBBY GARNER\n\n            Appeal as of Right from the Criminal Court for Montgomery County\n                         No. 40078    Robert W. Wedemeyer, Judge\n\n\n\n                   No. M1999-01427-CCA-R3-CD - Filed November 9, 2000\n\n\nFollowing a Montgomery County Grand Jury indictment, Bobby Garner, the defendant and appellant,\npled guilty to one count of aggravated burglary and one count of theft of property over one-thousand\ndollars. After a sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced the defendant to serve five years for\naggravated burglary and three years for theft. The trial court ordered the defendant to serve the\nsentences consecutively. On appeal, the defendant argues (1) that the sentences imposed were\nexcessive, (2) that he should have been sentenced alternatively, and (3) that consecutive sentences\nwere inappropriate. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n  Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Criminal Court of Montgomery\n                                    County is Affirmed\n\nJERRY L. SMITH, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which DAVID H. WELLES, and JOHN\nEVERETT WILLIAMS, JJ., joined.\n\nCharles S. Bloodworth, Assistant Public Defender, Clarksville, Tennessee, for the appellant, Bobby\nGarner.\n\nPaul G. Summers, Attorney General & Reporter, Jennifer L. Bledsoe, Assistant Attorney General\nand John Carney, District Attorney General, James B. Crenshaw, Assistant District Attorney,\nattorneys for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                            OPINION\n\n                                       Factual Background\n\n       The defendant broke into a house belonging to his parents-in-law where he stole jewelry and\ncash. The defendant was indicted for one count each of aggravated burglary and theft over one-\nthousand dollars. After the defendant pled guilty to the charges, the trial court held a sentencing\nhearing. A presentence report, prepared by a probation officer, was made an exhibit to that hearing.\nThe presentence report contained excerpts from a written victim impact statement prepared by Hella\nLindsay, the victim. The presentence report quotes the victim impact statement as follows:\n\f       According to Ms. Hella Lindsay[,] Defendant was fired from Trane Company due to\n       not passing a drug test. She also stated \u201cthe drugs have taken over his life to the\n       extent that he put his two small sons in danger while he made a pick-up. Drugs are\n       his life. He will not change. His only thought is to get more drugs, no matter what\n       it takes.\u201d\n\nMs. Lindsay\u2019s written statement also contained the following recommendation: \u201cI request that [the\ndefendant] be given the maximum prison sentences the crimes . . . allow. That should be at least\nthirty years without the possibility of parole.\u201d The presentence report also contained a factual\nsummary of the defendant\u2019s history of drug use. The summary, taken verbatim from a letter written\nby the defendant\u2019s wife, reads as follows:\n\n       Army sent him to Cumberland Hall. Few days later on drugs again. Army sent [him]\n       to Clarksville Memorial then on to Eisenhower RTF program. When completed was\n       on drugs within one month. Sent back to Eisenhower after attempted overdose. Was\n       returned from Eisenhower with diagnosis of no hope to ever get off drugs.\n       ....\n       October \u2013 Life Center for six months. Five days into he admitted to doing drugs,\n       received five days suspension, and re-entered. December \u2013 admitted to drug use\n       again, was in direct violation. Instead of being sent to jail [, the defendant] was sent\n       by Life Center to Florida. Stayed on the run and evaded authorities until twenty-sixth\n       of January. The Public Defender made a deal and got him into mission acres.\n\n       At the sentencing hearing, Ms. Lindsay was the state\u2019s only witness. Ms. Lindsay\u2019s\ntestimony was similar to her victim impact statement:\n\n       I\u2019d like to see Mr. Garner to go to jail for the rest of his life. Because he has put us\n       through so much misery. Not just myself. Also my daughter. My daughter has two\n       children from him. He has not paid a penny since he\u2019s out of rehab or anything.\n       He\u2019s a free loafer. He is no good. As far as I care, he can rot in jail.\n\n\n        The defendant also testified at the hearing. He explained that he had been convicted of two\nmisdemeanors before committing the crimes in this case, and that he received probation for the prior\ncrimes. He also admitted that he did not successfully complete that probation, and that the probation\nwas extended in order to give him more \u201ctime to pay.\u201d The defendant testified that he was still\nserving probation when he committed the crimes in this case. The defendant claimed that all of his\ncriminal history, including the present case, were due to his drug problems. He also testified that,\nafter he was arrested for the present charges, he successfully completed a drug rehabilitation\nprogram. Following his release from the drug rehabilitation program, the defendant pled guilty to\nthese charges. After his guilty plea, however, the defendant failed to appear at his sentencing\nhearing, and he was arrested. The defendant told the court that his failure to appear was merely an\noversight.\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\f         In imposing the defendant\u2019s sentence, the trial court found the existence of three statutory\nenhancement factors: (1) that the defendant had a previous history of criminal convictions or\ncriminal behavior in addition to those necessary to establish the appropriate range, Tenn. Code Ann.\n\u00a7 40-35-114(1); (2) that the defendant had a previous history of unwillingness to comply with the\nconditions of release into the community, Id. \u00a7 40-35-114(8); and (3) that the defendant abused a\nposition of private trust. Id. \u00a7 40-35-114(15). The trial court then found the following mitigating\nfactors: (1) that the defendant\u2019s conduct neither caused nor threatened serious bodily injury, Id. \u00a7\n40-35-113(1); (2) that the defendant completed a drug rehabilitation program, Id., \u00a7 40-35-113(13);\nand (3) that the defendant entered an open guilty plea, saving the time and expense of a trial. Id. As\na result, the trial court sentenced the defendant to serve five years for aggravated burglary and three\nyears for theft.\n         The trial court further determined that consecutive sentencing was appropriate under Tenn.\nCode Ann. \u00a7 40-35-115. Specifically, the court found that the appellant committed the present\noffenses while on probation. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-115(b)(6). Thus, the trial court imposed an\neffective eight-year sentence. Finally, the trial court denied the defendant alternative sentencing and\nordered the defendant to serve his sentence in the Tennessee Department of Corrections.\n\n                                          Standard of Review\n         When an appellant challenges the length, range, or manner of service of a sentence, this Court\nconducts a de novo review with a presumption that the determination of the trial court was correct.\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-401(d). However, this presumption of correctness is \"conditioned upon\nthe affirmative showing that the trial court in the record considered the sentencing principles and all\nrelevant facts and circumstances.\" State v. Ashby, 823 S.W.2d 166, 169 (Tenn. 1991).\n         If appellate review reflects that the trial court properly considered all relevant factors and its\nfindings of fact are adequately supported by the record, this Court must affirm the sentence. State\nv. Fletcher, 805 S.W.2d 785, 789 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991). In conducting a review, this Court must\nconsider the evidence, the presentence report, the sentencing principles, the arguments of counsel,\nthe nature and character of the offense, mitigating and enhancement factors, any statements made\nby the defendant, and the potential for rehabilitation or treatment. State v. Holland, 860 S.W.2d 53,\n60 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993). The defendant bears the burden of showing the impropriety of the\nsentence imposed. State v. Gregory, 862 S.W.2d 574, 578 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993).\n\n                                         Length of Sentences\n         First, the defendant complains that the trial court erroneously found that the defendant abused\na position of private trust.1 He argues that the evidence used to establish this enhancement factor,\ni.e., the victim impact statement and the victim\u2019s testimony, were irrelevant and prejudicial. He\nfurther claims that the evidence did not establish any position of private trust.\n\n\n\n         1\n           Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-114(15) states: \"The defendant abused a position of public or private trust, or used\na special skill in a mann er that signific antly facilitated the com mission o r the fulfillm ent of the o ffense.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                         -3-\n\f                                                   A.\n        Initially, we note that the trial court\u2019s consideration of the victim impact statements was\nappropriate. The Tennessee Code specifically allows trial courts to consider a statement from a\nvictim or an immediate family member of a crime victim; such statements are subject only to the\nlimitations that the statement must be reliable and that the defendant has a fair opportunity to rebut\nthe statement. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 40-35-209(b); 40-38-203(1); State v. Moss, 13 S.W.3d 374, 386\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1999). Furthermore, the Legislature has clearly expressed a desire that those\nstatements be as comprehensive as possible; the statement should address \"financial, emotional, and\nphysical effects of the crime . . . and specific information about the victim, the circumstances\nsurrounding the crime, and the manner in which it was perpetrated.\" Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\n40-38-203(2). In this case, the statements were made by the defendant\u2019s ex-wife and his ex-mother-\nin-law. Although the trial court did not specifically find the statements to be reliable, we have no\nreason to doubt their veracity, because the sentencing report, prepared by a probation officer, verified\ntheir source. Compare Moss, 13 S.W.3d at 386 (finding that numerous unsigned letters were\nimproperly considered by the trial court). Especially where, as here, the sentencing hearing was in\nfront of a judge, not a jury, we are disinclined to find that the evidence should have been excluded.\n\n                                               B.\n       We cannot agree, however, that the defendant abused a position of private trust. Tenn. Code\nAnn. \u00a7 40-35-114(15). The Tennessee Supreme Court has held\n\n        [t]he determination of the existence of a position of trust does not depend on the\n        length or formality of the relationship, but upon the nature of the relationship. Thus,\n        the court should look to see whether the offender formally or informally stood in a\n        relationship to the victim that promoted confidence, reliability, or faith. If the\n        evidence supports that finding, then the court must determine whether the position\n        occupied was abused by the commission of the offense.\n\nState v. Kissinger, 922 S.W.2d 482, 488 (Tenn. 1996). Recently addressing this issue, the Tennessee\nSupreme Court held that the enhancement factor was only appropriate where the evidence showed\n\u201c[a] relationship which promotes confidence, reliability, or faith usually includes a degree of\nvulnerability. It is the exploitation of this vulnerability to achieve criminal purposes which is\ndeemed more blameworthy and thus justifies application of the enhancement factor . . . .\u201c State v.\nGutierrez, 5 S.W.3d 641, 646 (Tenn. 1999); see also State v. Blackstock, \u2014 S.W.3d \u2014 (Tenn.\n2000).\n        Here, the defendant was married to the victims\u2019 daughter at the time of the burglary. Beyond\nthe familial relation, however, there is no evidence in this small record that shows a relationship that\npromotes confidence, reliability, or faith that created a vulnerability on the part of the victims. To\nthe contrary, the victim testified that she completely lacked any confidence or faith in the defendant.\nIndeed, she thought that the defendant was no good and was a drug addict. Furthermore, the only\nevidence that the defendant exploited the relationship was the victim\u2019s testimony that \u201che knew we\nwere out of town\u201d and the defendant\u2019s testimony that he knew where the jewels were. We do not\nfind this sufficient to support the imposition of this factor.\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f                                                   C.\n        Nonetheless, we find the length of the defendant\u2019s sentences appropriate. If no mitigating\nor enhancement factors for sentencing are present, the presumptive sentence shall be the minimum\nsentence within the applicable range. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-210(c). However, if such factors\ndo exist, a trial court should start at the minimum sentence, enhance the minimum sentence within\nthe range for enhancement factors and then reduce the sentence within the range for the mitigating\nfactors. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-210(e). No particular weight for each factor is prescribed by the\nstatute. State v. Moss, 727 S.W.2d 229, 238 (Tenn. 1986).\n        In this case, the defendant pled guilty to aggravated burglary and theft of property over one-\nthousand dollars. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 39-14-403, 39-14-103. The sentencing range for aggravated\nrobbery was between three and six years, and the presumptive sentence was three years. Id. \u00a7 40-35-\n112(a)(3). The sentencing range for theft over one-thousand dollars was between two and four years,\nand the presumptive sentence was two years. Id. \u00a7 40-35-112(a)(4). Thus, the trial court\u2019s sentence\nof five years for the aggravated burglary was slightly greater than the midpoint of the range, while\nthe three-year sentence for theft was exactly the midpoint in the range. After giving due\nconsideration to the mitigating factors and to the enhancement factors which were properly applied,\nwe find the length of the defendant\u2019s sentences appropriate.\n\n                                       Alternative Sentencing\n         Next, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of alternative sentencing. He argues\nthat the state did not overcome the presumption that the defendant was entitled to alternative\nsentencing. The Tennessee Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989 recognizes the limited capacity\nof state prisons and mandates that \"convicted felons committing the most severe offenses, possessing\ncriminal histories evincing a clear disregard for the laws and morals of society, and evincing failure\nof past efforts of rehabilitation shall be given first priority regarding sentencing involving\nincarceration.\" Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-102(5). A defendant who does not qualify as such and\nwho is an especially mitigated or standard offender of a Class C, D, or E felony is \"presumed to be\na favorable candidate for sentencing options in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\" Id. \u00a7\n40-35-102(6); Ashby, 823 S.W.2d at 169. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence\nto the contrary. Such evidence may include the following sentencing considerations:\n\n       (A) Confinement is necessary to protect society by restraining a defendant who has\n       a long history of criminal conduct;\n\n       (B) Confinement is necessary to avoid depreciating the seriousness of the offense or\n       confinement is particularly suited to provide an effective deterrence to others likely\n       to commit similar offenses; or\n\n       (C) Measures less restrictive than confinement have frequently or recently been\n       applied unsuccessfully to the defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-103(1). In this case, the defendant was convicted of theft of property over\none-thousand dollars, a Class D felony, and aggravated burglary, a Class C felony, and sentenced as\na standard, Range I offender.\n        Even assuming that the defendant was entitled to the presumption in favor of alternative\nsentencing, however, we find that the presumption was rebutted. As the trial court noted,\n\u201c[m]easures less restrictive than confinement have recently been applied unsuccessfully to this\ndefendant.\u201d See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-103(1)(C). The evidence adduced at the sentencing\nhearing proved that the defendant was on probation when he committed the instant offenses, and that\nhe had violated probation in the past. We find this sufficient to support a sentence of confinement.2\nSee State v. Elam, 7 S.W.3d 103, 107-108 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999).\nThis issue is without merit.\n\n                                       Consecutive Sentences\n        Next, the defendant complains that the trial court erred by ordering consecutive sentences.\nConsecutive sentencing is governed by Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-115. A trial court may order\nsentences to run consecutively if it finds that one or more of the statutory criteria exists by a\npreponderance of the evidence. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-115(b); State v. Black, 924 S.W.2d 912,\n917 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995). Under Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-115(b)(6), a trial court may impose\nconsecutive sentences after determining that the appellant committed the offenses while on probation\nfor another offense. It is undisputed that the appellant committed the present offenses while he was\non probation. Thus, the trial court's imposition of consecutive sentences was proper.\nThis issue is without merit.\n        Accordingly, The judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED.\n\n                                                                    ___________________________________\n                                                                    JERRY L. SMITH, JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n         2\n           The trial court also he ld that a sentence of confinement was ne cessary to avoid depre ciating the seriousness\nof the offense, and that the sentence wa s particularly suited to provide an effective de terrence to o thers likely to com mit\nsimilar crimes. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-103(1 )(B). Although the record does not support a denial of alternative\nsentencing based so lely on a need for deterren ce, see State v. Hooper, --- S.W.3d --- (Tenn. 2000), this is of no\nconsequence, because m easures less re strictive than confinement had recently been applied unsuccessfully to the\ndefendan t, as noted ab ove.\n\n                                                             -6-\n\f",
