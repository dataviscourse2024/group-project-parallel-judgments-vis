Cruz,\n\n                                                  Defendant - Appellant\n\n\n                   Appeal from the United States District Court\n                        for the Southern District of Texas\n                             USDC No. 5:12-CR-236-1\n\n\nBefore JOLLY, JONES, and BARKSDALE, Circuit Judges.\nPER CURIAM:*\n       Blas Cruz Urbina (Cruz) appeals the 60-month sentence imposed following\nhis guilty-plea conviction for attempted illegal reentry after deportation, in\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. He contends his sentence above the advisory\nSentencing Guidelines range of eight to 14 months was both procedurally and\nsubstantively unreasonable.\n       Although post-Booker, the Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly\npreserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f    Case: 12-40893     Document: 00512415193       Page: 2   Date Filed: 10/21/2013\n\n                                   No. 12-40893\n\nan abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate\nthe Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose.\nGall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007). In that respect, for issues\npreserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo;\nits factual findings, only for clear error.         See, e.g., United States v.\nCisneros-Gutierrez, 517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir. 2008); United States v. Villegas,\n404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir. 2005).\n      Along that line, because Cruz did not preserve his objection that the court\nerred procedurally by basing his sentence on claimed erroneous factual findings,\ninferences, and speculation, the objection is reviewed only for plain error. Under\nthat standard of review, Cruz must show a clear or obvious forfeited error that\naffected his substantial rights. See Puckett v. United States, 556 U.S. 129, 135\n(2009). Even if he shows such reversible plain error, we have the discretion to\ncorrect the error, but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness,\nintegrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. See id.\n      In plain-error review, \u201cquestions of fact capable of resolution by the district\ncourt can never constitute plain error\u201d. See United States v. Chung, 261 F.3d\n536, 539 (5th Cir. 2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nAccordingly, Cruz\u2019 challenges to the factual findings and inferences by the court,\nnot objected to at sentencing, cannot constitute plain error. See id.\n      Even assuming arguendo the court\u2019s findings and inferences merit\nanalysis, there was no reversible plain error. The court was within its wide\ndiscretion in rejecting Cruz\u2019 assertions he was supportive of his wife and family,\nsee United States v. Cantu-Ramirez, 669 F.3d 619, 628 (5th Cir.), cert. denied,\n133 S. Ct. 247 (2012), and its inference Cruz\u2019 family may not want to have\ncontact with him was plausible in the light of the record as a whole. See United\nStates v. Coleman, 609 F.3d 699, 708 (5th Cir. 2010). Finally, given the court\u2019s\nstated concerns regarding the seriousness of Cruz\u2019 prior unscored convictions,\nthe light sentences he received for his previous crimes, repeated reentry into the\n\n                                         2\n\f    Case: 12-40893     Document: 00512415193     Page: 3   Date Filed: 10/21/2013\n\n                                  No. 12-40893\n\nUnited States following prior deportations, and recent convictions for theft and\ndriving while intoxicated (DWI), there is nothing in the record to suggest, absent\nthe court\u2019s erroneous determination his prior Texas DWI offense constituted a\ncrime of violence, see United States v. Chapa-Garza, 243 F.3d 921, 927 (5th Cir.\n2001) (holding Texas felony DWI is not a crime of violence), that he would have\nreceived a lesser sentence. See Puckett, 556 U.S. at 135; cf. United States v.\nChandler, __ F.3d __, 2013 WL 5508139, at *4 (5th Cir. 4 Oct. 2013) (vacating\nand remanding 127-month variance where \u201cwe [could not] confidently say that\nthe district court would have imposed the same sentence without reliance on [an\nimproper] factor\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n      We need not consider the propriety of the sentence as an upward\ndeparture, pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 4A1.3, because the sentence may be affirmed\non the court\u2019s alternate basis as an upward variance justified by the 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. See United States v. Bonilla, 524 F.3d 647, 656-59\n(5th Cir. 2008). On that point, Cruz maintains the court erred procedurally by\nfailing to adequately explain the extent of the variance. In the light of this\nrecord, the court relied on proper factors and provided a sufficient explanation\nfor the extent of the variance. See United States v. Smith, 440 F.3d 704, 707-08\n(5th Cir. 2006). In stating its reasons for a non-Guidelines sentence, the court\nnoted the need to afford adequate deterrence and to promote respect for the law,\nand considered Cruz\u2019 history and characteristics.\n      Cruz also contends the sentence was substantively unreasonable given the\nabove-noted, alleged procedural errors and because the court allegedly failed to\ngive appropriate mitigating weight to his alcohol addiction, his family-related\nreasons for repeatedly returning to the United States, and his need for alcohol\nrehabilitation. He further asserts the court exaggerated the seriousness of his\ntheft and DWI convictions and the likelihood of recidivism based upon his three\nprior deportations.\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f    Case: 12-40893      Document: 00512415193       Page: 4    Date Filed: 10/21/2013\n\n                                    No. 12-40893\n\n      The sentence is substantively reasonable. The court tied the above-noted\nreasons for it to specific facts and particular \u00a7 3553(a) factors sufficient to justify\nthe variance. See Gall, 552 U.S. at 49-53. Although significant, it was not\nunreasonable. See United States v. McElwee, 646 F.3d 328, 344-45 (5th Cir.\n2011); see also United States v. Saldana, 427 F.3d 298, 315-16 (5th Cir. 2005)\n(affirming upward departure six times maximum advisory Guidelines range\nwhere court stated valid reasons for doing so).\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f",
