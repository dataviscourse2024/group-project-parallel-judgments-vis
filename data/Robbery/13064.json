The trial court found that the Defendant had three previous DUI convictions and sentenced him\nfor DUI, fourth offense, a Class E felony. The Defendant now appeals, contending that: (1) that the\nevidence contained in the record is insufficient to sustain his convictions for DUI and DUI per se;\n(2) the trial court erred when it allowed a police officer to testify about \u201cclues\u201d he gleaned from field\nsobriety tests because that was improper scientific testimony; (3) the trial court erred when it allowed\nthe State to impeach the Defendant with his prior conviction for \u201ca felony involving theft\u201d; and (4)\nthe trial court erred when it instructed the jury that it could infer that the Defendant was intoxicated\nbased solely on his blood alcohol level. Finding no reversible error, we affirm the judgments of the\ntrial court.\n\n     Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgments of the Criminal Court Affirmed\n\nROBERT W.

Facts\n\n      This case arises from the Defendant\u2019s conviction for DUI and DUI per se. At the\nDefendant\u2019s trial, the following evidence was presented: Phillip Martin testified that he was driving\n\fon Dickerson Road in Nashville during the evening of November 27, 2002, when he was struck from\nbehind by another car as he was slowing down approaching a red traffic light. Martin stated that the\nDefendant rear-ended a car, causing it to rear-end Martin\u2019s car. He said that the Defendant\u2019s car\nappeared to have swerved in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid rear-ending the car directly in front\nof the Defendant\u2019s car. Martin noted that the front end of the Defendant\u2019s car was damaged, and that\nthe Defendant\u2019s car had come to a stop on the sidewalk. He testified that the Defendant then got out\nof his car and ran down the street, \u201cwith a bunch of beer in his hand,\u201d without speaking to either of\nthe other drivers involved in the accident. Martin added that there was a young girl in the car with\nthe Defendant at the time of the incident, and she initially stayed in the car after the Defendant left\nbut eventually went down the street after him. He testified that the Defendant and the girl returned\nafter about five minutes, and the Defendant was no longer carrying the beer.\n\n        On cross-examination, Martin testified that he did not observe the Defendant having trouble\nwalking or running at any point during the course of the incident. He further testified that, although\nhe recalled seeing the Defendant running down the street with a six-pack of beer, he was uncertain\nwhether he informed the police that the Defendant was carrying beer when Martin gave his statement\nto the officer at the scene.\n\n         Officer Michael Wilson of the Metro-Nashville Police Department testified that, when he\narrived at the scene of the accident, he smelled alcohol on the Defendant, and the Defendant admitted\ndrinking two beers earlier in the afternoon. Officer Wilson further stated that the Defendant\u2019s eyes\nwere bloodshot and watery, leading him to believe that the Defendant may have been intoxicated.\nFurthermore, Officer Wilson testified that the Defendant was \u201cquiet,\u201d which he attributed to the\nDefendant not wanting to speak with him, because the Defendant may have been afraid that the\nofficer would smell alcohol on his breath. The officer also said that he administered a field sobriety\ntest, in which the Defendant was asked to walk in a straight line, touching his heel to his toe on each\nstep for a specified number of steps. According to Officer Wilson, the Defendant was able to walk\nin a straight line and took the appropriate number of steps, but was unable to consistently touch his\nheel to his toes.\n\n        Officer Wilson testified that he administered a second field sobriety test in which he\ninstructed the Defendant to stand on one leg, with his other leg raised so that his foot was six inches\noff the ground, while keeping his arms at his sides and counting to thirty. He stated that the\nDefendant successfully counted to thirty and was able to keep his arms at his sides, but he was\nunable to keep his raised foot from touching the ground. Officer Wilson said that he then placed the\nDefendant under arrest for DUI, based upon the Defendant\u2019s inability to pass the field sobriety tests.\nOfficer Wilson testified that he then brought the Defendant to the police station for booking and\ncalled for a technician to administer a breath alcohol test (\u201cBAT\u201d).\n\n        On cross-examination, Officer Wilson testified that his police report did not note that the\nDefendant had blood-shot, watery eyes, or that the Defendant was quiet. Officer Wilson testified\nthat on his police report he marked a box labeled \u201cslight\u201d referring to the effect that the alcohol was\nhaving upon the Defendant. The officer then testified that, although both of the other drivers\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\finvolved in the incident mentioned seeing the Defendant leave the scene with a six-pack of beer\nimmediately following the accident, the officer neither marked this down in his police report nor did\nhe question the Defendant about the beer. The officer also stated that the Defendant was cooperative\nduring the incident.\n\n        Veronica Mayes, a civilian employee with the Metro-Nashville Police Department, testified\nthat on November 27, 2002, she administered a BAT to the Defendant. Mayes stated that the test\nshowed that the Defendant had a blood alcohol level of .12.\n\n         The Defendant testified on his own behalf, stating that, although he had consumed two beers\nearlier in the afternoon on the day of this accident, between three-thirty and four p.m., he was in fact\nsober at the time of the incident, which took place around five-thirty p.m. The Defendant further\ntestified that, in the afternoon, his sister called him and asked him to watch her daughter while she\nwent to her boyfriend\u2019s house to pick up some personal property. The Defendant stated that, while\nwatching his niece, his sister called him, said she was arguing with her boyfriend, and asked the\nDefendant to pick her up. The Defendant said that he brought his niece with him because she knew\nhow to get to the boyfriend\u2019s house, and the Defendant did not. The Defendant testified that,\nalthough he did leave the scene of the accident, he had no beer with him, and he left to call his\nniece\u2019s father because she was upset. The Defendant further stated that he was never confronted by\nany of the witnesses or by Officer Wilson regarding the assertions that he had left his niece behind\nat the scene of the accident and that he had left the scene with a six-pack of beer.\n\n       Based on this evidence, the jury found the Defendant guilty of DUI and DUI per se.\n\n                                             II. Analysis\n\n         On appeal, the Defendant asserts that: (1) the evidence contained in the record was\ninsufficient to sustain his convictions of DUI and DUI per se; (2) the trial court erred when it allowed\na police officer to testify about \u201cclues\u201d he gleaned from field sobriety tests because that was\nimproper scientific testimony; (3) the trial court erred when it allowed the State to impeach the\nDefendant with his prior conviction for \u201ca felony involving theft\u201d; and (4) the trial court erred when\nit instructed the jury that it could infer that the Defendant was intoxicated based solely on his blood\nalcohol level.\n\n                                  A. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n        The Defendant alleges that there is insufficient evidence in the record to support his DUI\nconviction. When an accused challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court\u2019s standard of\nreview is whether, after considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\nTenn. R. App. P. 13(e); State v. Goodwin, 143 S.W.3d 771, 775 (Tenn. 2004) (citing State v. Reid,\n91 S.W.3d 247, 276 (Tenn. 2002)). This rule applies to findings of guilt based upon direct evidence,\ncircumstantial evidence, or a combination of both direct and circumstantial evidence. State v.\n\n\n                                                  -3-\n\fPendergrass, 13 S.W.3d 389, 392-93 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999).\n\n        In determining the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court should not re-weigh or re-evaluate\nthe evidence. State v. Matthews, 805 S.W.2d 776, 779 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1990). Nor may this\nCourt substitute its inferences for those drawn by the trier of fact from the evidence. State v. Buggs,\n995 S.W.2d 102, 105 (Tenn. 1999); Liakas v. State, 286 S.W.2d 856, 859 (Tenn. 1956). Questions\nconcerning the credibility of the witnesses, the weight and value of the evidence, and all factual\nissues raised by the evidence are resolved by the trier of fact. Liakas, 286 S.W.2d at 859. This Court\nmust afford the State of Tennessee the strongest legitimate view of the evidence contained in the\nrecord, as well as all reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the evidence. Goodwin, 143\nS.W.3d at 775 (quoting State v. Smith, 24 S.W.3d 274, 279 (Tenn. 2000)). Because a verdict of guilt\nagainst a defendant removes the presumption of innocence and raises a presumption of guilt, the\nconvicted criminal defendant bears the burden of showing that the evidence was legally insufficient\nto sustain a guilty verdict. Id.; see State v. Carruthers, 35 S.W.3d 516, 557-58 (Tenn. 2000).\n\n         Under Tennessee law, to support a conviction for DUI, the State is required to prove, beyond\na reasonable doubt, that the Defendant was driving or \u201cin physical control of any automobile or other\nmotor driven vehicle on any of the public roads and highways of the state, or on any streets or alleys\n. . . while . . . [u]nder the influence of any intoxicant . . . .\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 55-10-401(a)(1)\n(2004); State v. Butler, 108 S.W.3d 845 (Tenn. 2003). DUI per se is established when the State\nproves beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant was driving or \u201cin physical control of any\nautomobile or other motor driven vehicle on any of the public roads and highways of the state, or\non any streets or alleys . . . while . . . [t]he alcohol concentration in such person\u2019s blood or breath is\neight-hundredths of one percent (.08 %) or more.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 55-10-401(a)(2). A criminal\noffense may be established exclusively by circumstantial evidence. State v. Raines, 882 S.W.2d 376,\n380 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994) (citing State v. Hailey, 658 S.W.2d 547, 552 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n1983)). However, before an accused can be convicted of a criminal offense based on circumstantial\nevidence alone, the facts and circumstances \u201cmust be so strong and cogent as to exclude every other\nreasonable hypothesis save the guilt of the defendant . . . .\u201d Id. (citing State v. Crawford, 470 S.W.2d\n610, 612 (Tenn. 1971)). In other words, \u201c[a] web of guilt must be woven around the defendant from\nwhich he cannot escape and from which facts and circumstances the jury could draw no other\nreasonable inference save the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. (citing\nCrawford, 470 S.W.2d at 613). We note that this Court has often found that an arresting officer\u2019s\ntestimony alone is sufficient to support a defendant\u2019s conviction for DUI. See, e.g. State v. Vasser,\n870 S.W.2d 543, 544 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993).\n\n         In the case under submission, elements one and two, that the Defendant was driving a motor\nvehicle, and on a public road, are uncontroverted. The Defendant contends in his brief that there was\ninsufficient evidence presented to prove element three, that he was under the influence of an\nintoxicant. We disagree. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, it established\nthat the police responded to an accident involving the Defendant, and upon arriving at the scene the\npolice questioned the Defendant, who smelled of alcohol and admitted that he had been drinking\nearlier in the day. The police officer on the scene subsequently administered two separate field\n\n\n                                                   -4-\n\fsobriety tests, neither of which the Defendant completed successfully. Thereafter, the Defendant was\nplaced under arrest and given a BAT, which BAT showed that his blood alcohol content was .12,\nabove the legal limit. We conclude that this evidence is sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find\nthe essential elements of DUI and DUI per se beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n                                    B. Expert Witness Testimony\n\n        The Defendant next claims that the trial court erred when it allowed Officer Wilson to testify\nabout \u201cclues\u201d that he gleaned from the field sobriety tests that he administered to the Defendant.\nSpecifically, the Defendant asserts that Officer Wilson\u2019s testimony about \u201cclues\u201d exceeded the\nbounds of what a layperson may testify about and constituted improper expert testimony. The record\nevinces that, at trial, the State called Officer Wilson to testify about his observations during the field\nsobriety tests that he administered to the Defendant. His testimony included the following exchange:\n\n        Prosecutor: Have you had a moment to look at [the DUI test report] and refresh your\n        recollection?\n        Officer Wilson: Yes, ma\u2019am.\n        Prosecutor: Okay. What kind of clues, if any, did you see when he performed that\n        test?\n        Officer Wilson: He missed touching his toe to his heel on the first nine steps, as well\n        as the second nine steps. And he stepped off the line on both paths, both paths of\n        travel, both forwards and back.\n        Prosecutor: Okay. Let me ask you this question: Do you have to touch your heel to\n        toe all nine times to do it correctly?\n        Officer Wilson: Yes. That\u2019s required.\n        Prosecutor: Do you have to do it - - if you don\u2019t touch your toes, one, two, three, four,\n        five times on your first pass, how many clues is that?\n        Officer Wilson: That\u2019s one clue.\n        Prosecutor: You don\u2019t get a clue for every time you miss your heel to toe?\n        Officer Wilson: No.\n        Prosecutor: If you don\u2019t touch your heel to toe on the second nine steps, no matter\n        how many times you don\u2019t do it, how many clues is that?\n        Officer Wilson: That\u2019s another clue. So, that would be clue two.\n        Prosecutor: How may clues all together did you see - -\n\n         At this point the Defendant objected to the testimony as being improper expert testimony.\nThe Defendant contended that allowing Officer Wilson to testify about the \u201cclues\u201d he saw gave the\njury the impression that the field sobriety tests were being \u201cscored\u201d and that the officer should only\nbe allowed to testify about what he observed. In pertinent part, defense counsel stated that \u201cI thought\nthe proper thing was just to say what [the Defendant] did and leave it up to the jury to draw their\nown conclusions. But, talking about clues sounds like we\u2019re getting into him having a score, and\nI think that\u2019s not proper.\u201d The trial court ruled that the officer could testify about his observations\nbut not to any scientific opinions or conclusions. When testimony resumed, the State continued to\n\n\n                                                   -5-\n\fprobe Officer Wilson about the \u201cclues\u201d he gathered:\n\n       Prosecutor: And based on his demonstration, or his exhibition of those clues, what\n       then, in your training are you required to do?\n       Officer Wilson: With those clues?\n       Prosecutor: Yes.\n       Officer Wilson: Well, with those, I place him under arrest, believing that he was\n       under the influence of an intoxicant, namely alcohol.\n\n         According to the Tennessee Rules of Evidence, if scientific, technical, or other specialized\nknowledge will substantially assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact\nin issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may\ntestify in the form of an opinion or otherwise. Tenn. R. Evid. 702. Evidence constitutes \u201cscientific,\ntechnical, or other specialized knowledge\u201d if it concerns a matter that \u201cthe average juror would not\nknow, as a matter of course . . . .\u201d State v. Bolin, 922 S.W.2d 870, 874 (Tenn. 1996).\n\n         With the exception of the horizontal gaze nystagmus (\u201cHGN\u201d) sobriety test, field sobriety\ntests are not scientific tests requiring testimony of a qualified expert pursuant to Tennessee Rule of\nEvidence 702. See State v. Murphy, 953 S.W.2d 200, 202-03 (Tenn. 1997); State v. Gilbert, 751\nS.W.2d 454, 459 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1988) (holding that \u201cfield sobriety tests are not \u2018scientific tests;,\nand the admissibility of the results is not to be governed by rules pertaining to the admission of\nscientific evidence\u201d). In Murphy, the Tennessee Supreme Court addressed wither the HGN sobriety\ntest constitutes \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\u201d under evidentiary Rule 702.\nMurphy, 953 S.W.2d at 202. The defendant in that case had been convicted based primarily on the\nresults of a HGN test, which were described to the jury by the arresting officer. Id. The trial court\nheld that the HGN test results did not constitute scientific results. Id. The Murphy Court reversed,\nconcluding that the \u201cHGN test does differ fundamentally from other field sobriety tests because the\nwitness must necessarily explain the underlying scientific basis of the test in order for the testimony\nto be meaningful to a jury.\u201d Id. at 202. The Court went on to say in dicta that:\n\n       Other tests, in marked contrast, carry no such requirement. For example, if a police\n       officer testifies that the defendant was unable to walk a straight line or stand on one\n       foot or count backwards, a jury needs no further explanation of why such testimony\n       is relevant to or probative on the issue of the defendant\u2019s condition. A juror can rely\n       upon his or her personal experience or otherwise obtained knowledge of the effects\n       of alcohol upon one\u2019s motor and mental skills to evaluate and weigh the officer\u2019s\n       testimony.\n\nId. at 202-03.\n\n        This Court addressed whether an officer\u2019s testimony that the presence of three or more\n\u201cclues\u201d indicates a blood alcohol content of .10% or higher crossed the line into scientific testimony\nin State v. William Thomas Jankowski, No. 03C01-9503-CR-00100, 1995 WL 686121 (Tenn. Crim.\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fApp., at Knoxville, Nov. 15, 1995), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Apr. 1, 1996). In Jankowski, two\npolice officers testified about \u201cclues\u201d gleaned from field sobriety tests and how those clues\ncontributed to a determination that the appellant\u2019s blood alcohol content was .10 or higher. The\nCourt summarized the facts before it stating:\n\n       Officer Lilley testified that on the first test, the Walk and Turn test, he looked for 13\n       clues, that the presence of two or more clues indicates that the appellant\u2019s blood\n       alcohol content is .10 or higher, and that the appellant exhibited seven clues. He only\n       described one of these clues: the appellant overstepped \u201con the turn-around place,\u201d\n       and the officer had to \u201cgrab\u201d him. He further testified that the presence of three or\n       more clues on the second test, the One Leg Stand, indicates a blood alcohol content\n       of .10 or higher, and the appellant exhibited six clues.\n\nId. at *1. The Jankowski Court held, \u201cWhen Officers Lilley and Ottinger went beyond observations\nof the appellant\u2019s performance and drew conclusions from their observations that the appellant\u2019s\nblood alcohol content was.10 or higher, this testimony took us into the area of scientific evidence.\u201d\nId. at *2.\n\n         Unlike Jankowski, the officer in this case did not testify that any specific number of \u201cclues\u201d\nindicated the blood alcohol content of the Defendant, and, rather, his testimony was limited to the\n\u201cclues\u201d that he observed while the Defendant was performing the field sobriety tests. We have found\nmultiple other cases where the facts indicated that a police officer testified about \u201cclues\u201d in the\ncontext of a field sobriety test, see e.g., State v. Danny Joe Wright, No. W2003-01025-CCA-R3-CD,\n2004 WL 1813220, at *1 (Tenn. Crim. App., at Jackson, Aug. 12, 2004), no Tenn. R. App. P. 11\napplication filed, and some cases that indicated that the National Highway Transportation & Safety\nAdministration has determined that a suspect who evinces two or more clues for either filed sobriety\ntest can be considered too intoxicated to lawfully drive, see e.g., State v. Zane Allen Davis, Jr., No.\nM2000-00737-CCA-R3-CD, 2000WL 1879518, at * 2 (Tenn. Crim. App., at Nashville, Dec. 28,\n2000), no. Tenn. R. App. P. 11 application filed. However, none of those cases addressed whether\nthis testimony was proper. In fact, we have found no case in this state that has addressed whether\ntestimony by an officer about \u201cclues\u201d alone takes us into the area of scientific evidence. Therefore,\nas this is a case of first impression, we turn to decide whether Officer Wilson\u2019s testimony about\n\u201cclues\u201d was improper.\n\n        The word \u201cclue\u201d is a layman\u2019s term, and not a term of art with special significance in the\nscientific community. To the contrary, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary gives a very general and rather\nequivocated definition of the word \u201cclue,\u201d defining it as \u201cSuggestion or piece of evidence which may\nor may not lead to solution of crime or puzzle.\u201d BLACK \u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 256 (6th ed. 1990).\nNothing in our understanding of the word \u201cclue\u201d suggests to us that its unqualified use in a police\nofficer\u2019s testimony will be seen as positing a scientific or technical explanation for what the officer\nobserved or how it may correlate with blood alcohol content. Accordingly, we conclude in this case\nthat Officer Wilson\u2019s testimony did not put forth any scientific or quantitative analysis. Unlike the\ntestimony offered by the officers in Jankowski, Officer Wilson did not set a specific number of clues\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\frequired to determine intoxication, and additionally, he made no statement regarding the correlation\nbetween the clues he observed and the Defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level. The fact that Officer Wilson\nused the word \u201cclue\u201d in describing the observed behavior does not make the testimony scientific in\nnature. While it may be a better practice for an officer to refrain from using the word \u201cclues\u201d when\ntestifying about field sobriety tests, we hold that, in this case, Officer Wilson\u2019s testimony did not\ncross into the area of scientific evidence.\n\n        Further, even if Officer Wilson\u2019s testimony had been improper, review of this issue is\ngoverned by Rule 52 of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure, which states that, \u201cNo judgment\nof conviction shall be reversed on appeal except for errors which affirmatively appear to have\naffected the result of the trial on the merits.\u201d Further, Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 36\nprovides, \u201c(b) Effect of Error. A final judgment from which relief is available or otherwise\nappropriate shall not be set aside unless, considering the whole record, error involving a substantial\nright more probably than not affected the judgment or would result in prejudice to the judicial\nprocess.\u201d Applying this standard and in light of the strength of the evidence presented against the\nDefendant, we conclude that he suffered no prejudice from the officer\u2019s testimony regarding \u201cclues\u201d\nobserved in the course of administering the field sobriety tests. Thus, the Defendant\u2019s conviction\ncannot be overturned on the ground that the trial court erred in allowing the State to portray a\nprosecution witness as an expert in the interpretation of field sobriety tests.\n\n                     C. Impeachment with a \u201cPrior Felony Involving Theft\u201d\n                                1. Prior Felony Convictions\n\n         The Defendant asserts that the trial court erred when it allowed the State to impeach him\nusing his prior conviction for aggravated robbery. Prior to trial, the Defendant filed a motion in\nlimine to prohibit the State from questioning him about his prior conviction. The trial court\nconsidered the motion and held that because aggravated robbery is primarily a crime of violence, its\nprobative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Before the Defendant testified, the State\nasked the trial court to reconsider the matter, and the trial court, reversing its earlier decision, ruled\nthat the State could impeach the Defendant with his prior aggravated robbery conviction by referring\nto that conviction as \u201ca felony involving theft.\u201d The Defendant asserts on appeal that this ruling by\nthe trial court constitutes reversible error.\n\n        As a preliminary matter, we note that the admissibility of evidence is a question generally\nwithin the trial court\u2019s discretion. Otis v. Cambridge Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 850 S.W.2d 439, 442 (Tenn.\n1992). \u201cWhen arriving at a determination to admit or exclude even that evidence which is\nconsidered relevant trial courts are generally accorded a wide degree of latitude and will only be\noverturned on appeal where there is a showing of abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. A trial court\u2019s ruling\nunder Tennessee Rule of Evidence 609 will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. Johnson\nv. State, 596 S.W.2d 97, 104 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1979). A trial court abuses its discretion in this\nregard only when it \u201c\u2018applie[s] an incorrect legal standard, or reache[s] a decision which is against\nlogic or reasoning that cause[s] an injustice to the party complaining.\u2019\u201d State v. Shirley, 6 S.W.3d\n243, 247 (Tenn. 1999) (quoting State v. Shuck, 953 S.W.2d 662, 669 (Tenn. 1997)).\n\n\n                                                   -8-\n\f        Pursuant to Rule 609, Tennessee Rules of Evidence, the credibility of the defendant may be\nattacked by presenting evidence of prior convictions if certain conditions are met. First, the State\nmust give reasonable pretrial notice of the impeaching convictions. Tenn. R. Evid. 609(a)(3).\nSecond, the convictions must be punishable by death or imprisonment over one year or must involve\na crime of dishonesty or a false statement. Tenn. R. Evid. 609(a)(2). Third, less than ten years must\nhave elapsed between the defendant\u2019s release from confinement on the prior conviction and the\ncommencement of the instant prosecution. Tenn. R. Evid. 609(b). Finally, the impeaching\nconviction\u2019s probative value on credibility must outweigh its unfair prejudice. Tenn. R. Evid.\n609(a)(3).\n\n        In determining whether the probative value of a prior conviction on the issue of credibility\noutweighs its unfair prejudicial effect on the substantive issues, a trial court should consider the\nsimilarity between the crime in question and the underlying impeaching conviction, as well as the\nrelevance of the impeaching conviction with respect to credibility. State v. Waller, 118 S.W.3d 368,\n371 (Tenn. 2003). The fact that a prior conviction involves the same or similar crime for which the\ndefendant is being tried does not automatically require its exclusion. State v. Baker, 956 S.W.2d 8,\n15 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997); State v. Miller, 737 S.W.2d 556, 560 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1987).\nHowever, if \u201cthe prior conviction and instant offense are similar in nature the possible prejudicial\neffect increases greatly and should be more carefully scrutinized.\u201d Long v. State, 607 S.W.2d 482,\n486 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1980). A trial court should first analyze whether the impeaching conviction\nis relevant to the issue of credibility. Waller, 118 S.W.3d at 371. Rule 609 of the Tennessee Rules\nof Evidence suggests that the commission of any felony is \u201cgenerally probative\u201d of a criminal\ndefendant\u2019s credibility. Id. However, the Tennessee Supreme Court has rejected a per se rule that\npermits impeachment by any and all felony convictions. State v. Mixon, 983 S.W.2d 661, 674\n(Tenn. 1999). A prior felony conviction still must be analyzed to determine whether it is sufficiently\nprobative of credibility to outweigh any unfair prejudicial effect it may have on the substantive issues\nof the case. Waller, 118 S.W.3d at 371. To determine how probative a felony conviction is to the\nissue of credibility, the trial court must assess whether the felony offense involves dishonesty or a\nfalse statement. Id.\n\n        Robbery and theft offenses are crimes of dishonesty. See State v. Galmore, 994 S.W.2d 120,\n122 (Tenn. 1999) (providing that robbery is a crime of dishonesty); Baker, 956 S.W.2d at 15\n(providing that theft is a crime of dishonesty). Therefore, they are highly probative as to credibility.\nState v. Tune, 872 S.W.2d 922, 927 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993).\n\n       In this case, the Defendant asserts that the trial court improperly allowed the State to impeach\nhim with an \u201cunnamed\u201d felony. This Court has previously held that the practice of allowing\nimpeachment via an unnamed felony conviction is unfairly prejudicial, because it allows the jury to\nunnecessarily speculate as to the type of felony actually committed. See State v. Barnard, 899\nS.W.2d 617, 622 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994). Subsequently, the Tennessee Supreme Court has cited\nBarnard approvingly, adding that \u201cthe proper application of the balancing test under Tennessee Rule\nof Evidence 609(a)(3) requires identification of the prior conviction.\u201d Galmore, 994 S.W.2d at 122.\nThe Galmore Court went on to state, \u201cinstructing the jury on an unnamed felony would provide\n\n\n                                                  -9-\n\finadequate information for a jury to properly weigh the conviction\u2019s probative value as impeaching\nevidence.\u201d Id.\n\n        The State asserts that by referring to the aggravated robbery conviction as a \u201cfelony involving\ntheft,\u201d any prejudice resulting from the jury speculating as to the nature of the crime was greatly\nreduced. In support of this contention, the State argues that the case under submission is\ndistinguishable from State v. Taylor, 993 S.W.2d 33, 35 (Tenn. 1999), in which the trial court\nallowed the State to impeach the defendant with a prior \u201cfelony involving dishonesty.\u201d The Taylor\nCourt held that \u201c[i]dentifying the nature of the prior conviction avoids confusion and speculation\non the part of the jury and permits the jury to properly evaluate the conviction\u2019s probative value on\nthe issue of credibility.\u201d (emphasis added). The Court concluded that \u201c[t]he degree to which\nimpeaching conviction is probative of untruthfulness can vary with the nature of the offense, even\nwith felonies involving dishonesty\u201d and went on to hold \u201cthat the offense must be identified to the\nfinder of fact when a prior conviction is used for impeachment purposes pursuant to Rule 609(a)(3).\u201d\nId. at 35.\n\n         We conclude that the case under submission is distinguishable from Taylor in that the trial\ncourt required the State to refer to the Defendant\u2019s prior conviction as a \u201cfelony involving theft.\u201d\nAggravated robbery is a theft offense, and robbery is clearly probative of credibility. Galmore, 994\nS.W.2d at 122. Further, a conviction for theft is clearly one that involves dishonesty and is highly\nprobative of credibility. Baker, 956 S.W.2d at 15. The trial court expressed its concern that the\naspect of violence of an aggravated robbery conviction might prejudice the jury against the\nDefendant, and, to mitigate the prejudice, the trial court ordered the State to refer to the crime merely\nas theft. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this regard. The Defendant\nis, therefore, not entitled to relief on this issue.\n\n                     2. Adequacy of the Trial Court\u2019s Limiting Instruction\n\n        The Defendant next contends that the trial court did not provide an adequate limiting\ninstruction about how the jury should consider his prior conviction. During the jury instructions, the\ntrial court failed to give a limiting instruction that a prior conviction could only be used to impeach\nthe Defendant and not as proof that he committed the crime in question. The Defendant contends\nthat the trial court committed reversible error by failing to provide the jury a limiting instruction.\nThe State counters that, although the trial court did not single out the issue of the Defendant\u2019s prior\nconvictions in the instructions dealing with impeachment, the trial court did provide a general\nimpeachment instruction, and that the Defendant suffered no prejudice from the trial court\u2019s failure\nto give a limiting instruction specifically addressing the Defendant\u2019s prior conviction. The State\nfurther asserts that, because the Defendant did not request a specific limiting instruction and did not\nraise this issue in his motion for a new trial, the issue is waived.\n\n       Issues not raised before the trial court or in a motion for new trial are deemed waived. See\nTenn. R. App. P. 36(a). In State v. Howell, 868 S.W.2d 238 (Tenn. 1993), the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt addressed the issue squarely before us. In that case, the defendant claimed that the trial court\n\n\n                                                  -10-\n\fdid not adequately instruct the jury about how it could consider proof that the defendant had\ncommitted other crimes. Id. at 254-55. The Court noted that the defendant failed to object to the\ncourt\u2019s omission of such instructions and failed to raise the issue in his motion for new trial. Id. It\nwent on to discuss the \u201cfundamental error\u201d rule set out in the previous decision of State v. Reece,\n637 S.W.2d 858 (Tenn. 1982), stating:\n\n                In State v. Reece, . . . this Court held that where the State\u2019s case is weak and\n       prior inconsistent statements admitted for impeachment are extremely damaging, the\n       failure to give a limiting instruction that the statements are only to be considered on\n       the issue of credibility may amount to fundamental error constituting grounds for\n       reversal, even in the absence of a special request. Reece, 637 S.W.2d at 861. This\n       holding, however, was \u201climited to those exceptional cases in which the impeaching\n       testimony is extremely damaging, the need for a limiting instruction is apparent, and\n       the failure to give it results in substantial prejudice to the rights of the accused.\u201d Id.\n\nId. The Court continued:\n\n               Our review of the record convinces us that the \u201cfundamental error\u201d rule of\n       State v. Reece, . . . is not applicable to this case. See id. An important factor for the\n       court in Reece, was the fact that the prior inconsistent statements used to impeach\n       were so damaging that the failure to give a limiting instruction, in essence, allowed\n       the jury to consider the impeachment evidence as substantive evidence, and thereby\n       allowed inadmissible hearsay evidence to take precedence over testimony given\n       under oath by the witness on the stand. In this case, the testimony about the\n       defendant\u2019s other crimes was relevant to his guilt, and no hearsay problems were\n       involved.\n\n       Accordingly, although there is a significant possibility of misuse with testimony\n       about a defendant\u2019s commission of other crimes, and limiting instructions are critical\n       in preventing improper and prejudicial use of proof of other crimes, see, e.g., State\n       v. Fisher, 670 S.W.2d 232, 237 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1983), we conclude that the trial\n       court did not commit reversible error in failing to give limiting instructions with\n       respect to the proof of other crimes.\n\nId. The Court then held that the defendant \u201cwaived this issue by not requesting a limiting instruction\nand by not raising the issue in his motion for a new trial, Tenn. R. App. P. 3(e), and the failure to\ngive limiting instructions was neither fundamental nor prejudicial error.\u201d Id. (citing State v. West,\n767 S.W.2d 387, 396 (Tenn. 1989)). The Court determined that \u201cthe blame for the failure to give\nlimiting instructions \u2018must be laid at the defendant\u2019s feet.\u2019\u201d Id. (citing Laird v. State, 565 S.W.2d\n38, 40 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1978)).\n\n       In the case under submission, we conclude that \u201cfundamental error\u201d rule of Reece, is not\napplicable. As noted by the Howell Court, an important factor in Reece was the fact that the\n\n\n                                                 -11-\n\fimpeachment evidence was so damaging that the failure to give the instruction allowed the jury to\nconsider the evidence as substantive evidence. In this case, the Defendant was being tried for DUI\nand DUI per se, and he chose to testify on his own behalf. The trial court ruled that his credibility\ncould be impeached with his prior conviction for a \u201cfelony involving theft.\u201d The testimony about\nthe Defendant\u2019s prior felony theft conviction was relevant to the issue of his credibility, and the\nadmission of this evidence did not, in essence, allow the jury to consider the evidence as substantive\nevidence of the Defendant\u2019s guilt of DUI and DUI per se. Accordingly, we conclude that the\n\u201cfundamental error\u201d rule in Reece is inapplicable and that the Defendant waived this issue by not\nrequesting a limiting instruction or raising this issue in his motion for new trial. Further, we hold\nthat the failure to give a limiting instruction was neither fundamental nor prejudicial error. The\nDefendant is, therefore, not entitled to relief on this issue.\n\n                       D. Instruction Regarding Inference of Intoxication\n\n         The Defendant next asserts that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could infer\nthat the Defendant was intoxicated based upon his breath alcohol level. It is the Defendant\u2019s\ncontention that when the jury instructions for the Defendant\u2019s DUI and DUI per se charges are read\nas a whole, they create an unconstitutional mandatory inference of guilt and that the jury could not\nhave found the Defendant guilty of one charge without also finding the Defendant guilty of the other\ncharge. The State contends that the case law does not support the Defendant\u2019s contention and that\nthe trial court\u2019s instructions were entirely proper.\n\n       In addressing circumstantial evidence of intoxication based on a .10 blood alcohol level,\n(now .08) this Court has previously stated that:\n\n        [W]e interpret this state\u2019s per se DUI statute, Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7\n        55-10-401(a)(2) [2003], to mean that the subsequently obtained test results are\n        presumptive evidence of the blood alcohol concentration at the time of driving\n        without the necessity of extrapolation. Reliable test results obtained within a\n        reasonable time after the accused motorist is stopped, reflecting a .10% blood alcohol\n        level, standing alone, constitute circumstantial evidence upon which the fact finder\n        may, but is not required to, convict of per se DUI.\n\nState v. Wilmore Hatfield, No. M2002-00939-CCA-R3-CD, 2003 WL 535930, *7 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. 2003), rev\u2019d on other grounds State v. Hatfield, 130 S.W.3d 40 (Tenn. 2004). Thus, it is clear\nthat a jury may interpret a .10 blood alcohol level as proof of intoxication, however, it is also free\nto conclude otherwise.\n\n        In the case under submission, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:\n\n                 If you find from the proof that the defendant was found by means of a blood\n        test to have ten-hundredths of one percent, point one-o percent or more by weight of\n        alcohol in the defendant\u2019s blood, you, the jury, are permitted to infer that the\n\n\n                                                  -12-\n\f        defendant was under the influence of such intoxicant, and that the defendant\u2019s ability\n        to drive was therefore impaired sufficiently to constitute a violation of the law against\n        driving under the influence of alcohol.\n\n                However, you are never required to make this inference.\n\n         The jury instruction was entirely in accord with this Court\u2019s ruling in Hatfield, stating that\nif the jury found the Defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level to be .10, the jury was at liberty to find that the\nDefendant was under the influence of an intoxicant, but that they were not required to do so.\nTherefore, we conclude that the jury instructions were not erroneous.\n\n        With regard to the Defendant\u2019s contention that, pursuant to the instructions given, if the jury\nconvicted on one count they had no choice but to convict on the other, we note that DUI and DUI\nper se contain different elements. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 55-10-401(a)(1) & 401(a)(2). This Court\nhas held that an acquittal of either would not necessarily mean that the state could not establish the\nelements of the other. State v. Conway, 77 S.W.3d 213, 218 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2001).\n\n        In Conway, the defendant was charged with DUI and DUI per se. Id. Ultimately, the jury\nacquitted the defendant of DUI, while finding him guilty of DUI per se. Id. In the case under\nsubmission, while it is true that the jury could have inferred that the Defendant was in fact\nintoxicated, based on his .12 blood alcohol level, thus, satisfying the third element of DUI per se,\nthe jury could also have discredited the State\u2019s evidence that the Defendant had a blood alcohol level\nof .12 and still found the Defendant guilty of DUI based upon the testimony of Officer Wilson and\nPhillip Martin. Alternatively, the jury could have found the State\u2019s evidence that the Defendant had\na blood alcohol level of .12 credible and found him guilty of DUI per se, without finding that the\ndefendant was under the influence of the intoxicant and thus, could have found the Defendant not\nguilty of DUI. As such, we conclude that the jury instructions did not create an unconstitutional\nmandatory inference of guilt, and we affirm the Defendant\u2019s convictions.\n\n                                           III. Conclusion\n\n      In accordance with the foregoing, we conclude that there exists no reversible error in the\njudgments of the trial court. Therefore, the judgments of the trial court are affirmed.\n\n\n                                                         ____________________________________\n                                                         ROBERT W.
