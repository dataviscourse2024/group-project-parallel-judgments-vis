The aggravated assault conviction was merged with the aggravated\nrobbery conviction. The trial court imposed an effective nineteen-year sentence. On appeal,\nthe Defendant argues that the successor judge erroneously determined that he was qualified\nto act as thirteenth juror in this case.

On February 9, 2010, a Knox County grand jury returned a\nnine-count indictment against the Defendant, charging him with two counts of aggravated\nburglary, one count of employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony,\n\ftwo counts of especially aggravated kidnapping, and four counts of aggravated robbery. See\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 39-13-305, -13-402, -14-403, -17-1324. Prior to trial, the State\ndismissed one count of aggravated burglary and two counts of aggravated robbery. Trial\nproceeded on the remaining six charges.\n\n        Twenty-one-year-old Isiah Cobb testified that he was working at Little Caesars in\nDecember 2009 and living on Chickamauga Ave in Knoxville. He lived there with his\ngirlfriend Jessica Greene and a roommate, Justin Woodruff. Mr. Cobb testified that he knew\nthe Defendant prior to the home invasion, that Mr. Woodruff and the Defendant were friends,\nand that he later learned that Mr. Woodruff and the Defendant were related.\n\n        Mr. Cobb stated that he had previously tried to help the Defendant get a job. Mr.\nCobb testified that, about a week before the home invasion, the Defendant, along with Mr.\nWoodruff, came by Mr. Cobb\u2019s workplace, and the Defendant obtained an application for\nemployment. Mr. Cobb told the Defendant to fill out the application, and Mr. Cobb would\ntalk to his managers and \u201csee what [he could] do about getting [the Defendant] a job[.]\u201d\n\n       Mr. Cobb provided a list of the items that he had received or bought as Christmas\npresents that year: an \u201cin-dash TV, iPod touch, Nintendo DS, little electronics\u201d; a purse and\nbracelet he had purchased for Ms. Greene; and clothes he had bought for his one-year-old\nson. He stated that he drove a 1998 Grand Marquis, which had recently been involved in a\nwreck and an insurance claim was pending at the time of the home invasion.\n\n        Mr. Cobb then provided that the following events occurred on December 29, 2009.\nJust after midnight, he returned home from work. He recalled that the \u201cbottom door handle\u201d\non the back door was locked but that he \u201cdidn\u2019t make sure the dead bolt was locked.\u201d Mr.\nCobb and Ms. Greene had brought some food home. He went to his bedroom in the back of\nthe house, and while he was on the phone, \u201c[a]ll of a sudden [he] heard a loud commotion\nbust through the back door[.]\u201d Ms. Greene ran inside the bedroom, followed by an armed\ngunman, who he identified as the Defendant. The gunman ordered Mr. Cobb \u201cto put the\nphone down and drop everything\u201d and proceeded to \u201ctell [them] to give all of [their]\nbelongings\u201d to him. The couple started putting their things inside a bag. According to Mr.\nCobb, the gunman was wearing gloves and had on a \u201cblack hoodie[,]\u201d so Mr. Cobb believed\n\u201che was there to kill [them].\u201d Mr. Cobb described the gun as a black 9mm \u201cwith chrome on\nit[.]\u201d\n\n       Mr. Cobb testified that the gunman pointed the weapon at his chest and face, ordering\nhim not to move or he would kill him. According to Mr. Cobb, the gunman proceeded to\nconfront Ms. Greene with the weapon, pointing it at her chest and asking, \u201cWhat you got in\nyour bra? Where is the money at?\u201d He then instructed the couple to take off their clothes.\n\n                                             -2-\n\fMr. Cobb stated that he did not move \u201cat all\u201d because he \u201cwas scared [he] was going to get\nshot.\u201d His back was against the wall, and he was \u201ccrouched\u201d down, \u201cbasically begging\u201d for\n\u201c[his] life.\u201d The gunman continued packing items into the bag.\n\n       According to Mr. Cobb, the gunman obtained items from \u201cthe room, closets, jewelry\nbox on top of [the] TV stand, [and] change inside a Mason jar.\u201d Mr. Cobb stated that\n\u201c[t]here were several items spread all across the room\u201d because it was \u201cthe holiday season\u201d\nand he had been \u201cmessing with [his] gadgets[.]\u201d Mr. Cobb also testified that the gunman\ntook his \u201cbill money[,]\u201d which was approximately $1,100 in cash for the rent, utilities, and\nphones. Mr. Cobb noticed that some of his son\u2019s clothes were missing, along with several\ntoys.\n\n        After the gunman gathered everything, he ordered the couple to give him their car\nkeys. He then took Ms. Greene\u2019s purse and started \u201cstuffing stuff in it.\u201d He ordered them\nnot to move and then left the bedroom for few seconds. He returned and said, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\nI told you stay where you are. Do not move at all[.]\u201d Mr. Cobb continued to \u201ctoss[] him\neverything\u201d in an effort to get the gunman to leave. Mr. Cobb believed that the gunman tried\nto start their other vehicle but that it did not start because there was \u201csomething wrong with\nthe ignition and starter[.]\u201d Mr. Cobb opined that this required the gunman to move the stolen\nitems to the Grand Marquis. The gunman again returned to the bedroom and ordered them\nnot to move, \u201c[s]till just taking nicknack things.\u201d The gunman went outside again for a\nsecond time and tried \u201cto start a car up.\u201d\n\n       He returned again to the bedroom and began arguing with the couple: \u201cTelling us,\n\u2018Where\u2019s the rest of the money? I know you hiding something in here. If you don\u2019t give it\nup, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u2019\u201d He was still pointing the weapon at their faces and ordering them\nto \u201cstay on the ground.\u201d The gunman pretended like he was going to leave but again\nreturned, acting \u201clike he\u2019s going to shoot.\u201d Mr. Cobb described this behavior as \u201cplaying\ngames.\u201d Mr. Cobb assured the gunman that he \u201cgot everything\u201d and begged him to leave.\n\n       The gunman finally left, and still afraid, they waited in the bedroom. Thereafter, Ms.\nGreene\u2019s brother, Arnold Greene, arrived. Mr. Greene came to the house because he was the\nperson on the phone with Mr. Cobb at the time the gunman entered the house and he heard\nthe commotion. They then used Mr. Greene\u2019s phone to call 911.\n\n       Mr. Cobb testified that he did not give the Defendant permission to enter his house\non December 29, 2009. According to Mr. Cobb, Mr. Woodruff had moved out of the house\n\u201cthe same day\u201d as the home invasion. Before Mr. Cobb left for work, no one was at his\nhouse; Ms. Greene had also left to go to work.\n\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\f        Mr. Cobb\u2019s car was returned to him in May 2010. The car had been titled in someone\nelse\u2019s name. None of the other stolen items were ever recovered.\n\n         On cross-examination, Mr. Cobb confirmed that he originally reported \u201cthe total value\nof all this stuff was about $9,000[.]\u201d He stated that he either bought all of the items with his\nsalary or that they were Christmas gifts.\n\n       Mr. Cobb also confirmed that he and Ms. Greene refused to take off their clothing,\nalthough instructed by the gunman to do so. Mr. Cobb did remove his \u201cchain\u201d and wallet\nfrom his person and gave them to the gunman. Mr. Cobb agreed that the gunman \u201cdidn\u2019t gag\n[him] with anything, tape over [his] mouth or any of that[.]\u201d Mr. Cobb was forced to stay\nin the bedroom due to the gunman\u2019s display of force. According to Mr. Cobb, he was\n\u201cheaded towards the door, and [he] was forced back inside the room by a man holding a gun,\nwith gloves on his hands.\u201d Mr. Cobb agreed that the gunman never fired his weapon.\n\n       Mr. Cobb stated that the Defendant \u201chad never been at [his] house before.\u201d If the\nDefendant had come to the house with Mr. Woodruff while Mr. Cobb was out, Mr. Cobb\nbelieved Mr. Woodruff would have informed him of the visit.\n\n       Ms. Greene testified that she was nineteen years old and that Mr. Cobb was her\nboyfriend. She worked as an assistant manager at Little Caesars; she worked at a different\nlocation from Mr. Cobb.\n\n        Ms. Greene testified to several items she received for Christmas that year: \u201c[c]lothes,\njewelry[,] . . . a iPod DS and an iPod touch, an Nintendo DS.\u201d She received a Juicy Couture\npurse from Mr. Cobb, and she also had a Coach purse and a Coach wallet. She also testified\nthat they had two cell phones, one for each of them, and that they owned two vehicles, a 1995\nCadillac Deville and a Grand Marquis. Both vehicles were parked in the driveway on the\nevening of the home invasion. She was asked if she knew the Defendant prior to the home\ninvasion, to which she responded: \u201cFar as knowing him, no. I knew his face. I had seen him\nbefore, probably two or three times, maybe, not in a row. I had seen him in the past.\u201d\n\n      Ms. Greene gave a similar recount of the events as Mr. Cobb. According to Ms.\nGreene, they had just gotten home after getting some food at Wendy\u2019s. They shut the door\nand went to the bedroom to eat when she heard a \u201cbig commotion.\u201d The gunman entered the\nbedroom, pointed the weapon at her, and said, \u201cGet on the ground. I need everything. I need\nmoney, purses, everything y\u2019all have.\u201d She complied and got down on her knees. She began\nthrowing items of value towards him, and he was \u201cshoving everything down\u201d in her Coach\nbackpack; this backpack was different from the Coach purse she previously described. The\ngunman approached her and \u201cstarted tugging on [her] shirt, telling [her] to take [her] shirt\n\n                                              -4-\n\foff[.]\u201d Ms. Greene refused. The gunman took her purse, her phone, both sets of car keys,\nthe \u201cchange jar and stuff like that[.]\u201d The gunman then ordered them not to move or he\nwould shoot. The gunman kept leaving the house and returning to the room several times,\n\u201c[l]ike it was a joke or something, just making [them lie] on the ground, making [them] stay\ndown.\u201d The gunman left the house in their Grand Marquis. She described the gun used as\n\u201cblack and chrome\u201d and said \u201c[i]t looked like a 9-millimiter [sic].\u201d She did not give the\nDefendant permission to enter her house that evening.\n\n        When her brother arrived \u201c[a] couple of minutes\u201d later, she borrowed his phone and\ncalled 911. She said that she was \u201creal scared\u201d when talking on the phone with the 911\noperator but that she tried to remain calm and relay the information to the operator. The 911\ncall was played for the jury. She acknowledged that, during the call, she asked Mr. Cobb a\nlot of questions about the gunman, stating that this was because she \u201cdidn\u2019t know anything\nabout him.\u201d Ms. Greene admitted that she initially replied that the gloves worn by the\ngunman were yellow but that Mr. Cobb corrected her that they were red. Ms. Greene also\ntestified that, initially, she \u201cwas unsure\u201d of how the gunman entered the house. She was not\nsure if Mr. Cobb had left the door unlocked or if the gunman had kicked it in, but she later\nrealized that the door had been kicked in \u201cbecause the bottom lock was broke[.]\u201d She\nshowed the door to the responding officer.\n\n       On cross-examination, Ms. Greene acknowledged that in the 911 call, she told the\nresponding officer that they had spoken with Samantha Ellis, the Defendant\u2019s cousin,\nfollowing the home invasion and that Ms. Ellis said the Defendant was \u201cprobably going to\u201d\nGreen Hills Apartments. Ms. Greene then clarified that Mr. Cobb had spoken with Mr.\nWoodruff, who had spoken to Samantha Ellis. This conversation between Mr. Cobb and Mr.\nWoodruff occurred prior to the call to 911.\n\n        She also admitted that she told the 911 operator that the gunman did not force his way\ninside, but Mr. Cobb again corrected her. Ms. Greene stated that she had not seen the door\nat the time she was speaking with the operator. She also asked Mr. Cobb to provide a\ndescription of the gunman\u2019s clothing, which she relayed.\n\n       Ms. Greene confirmed that she refused to remove her clothing and that she did not\npick up the change off the floor as instructed.\n\n       Officer John David Lawson of the Knoxville Police Department was the responding\nofficer on the scene. After receiving the call, he went to the victims\u2019 home, where he met\nthem in the front yard. He \u201chad to calm them down and speak with them.\u201d They said that\nthey had been robbed. Officer Lawson took down the information they reported.\n\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\f        Officer Lawson went inside the house to investigate. \u201cIt seemed in disarray. The\nbedroom was kind of tossed around, the belongings in the bedroom, and just little things\nseemed out of place.\u201d He recorded the items they reported as stolen. He then went to look\nat the door, where the gunman had allegedly entered. According to Officer Lawson, the door\n\u201cwas damaged and didn\u2019t have a very good lock on it[.]\u201d His observations of the door were\nconsistent with the version of the events given by the victims. After speaking with the\nvictims, officers attempted to located the Defendant that evening, but they were unsuccessful.\n\n       Officer Lawson confirmed that his vehicle was equipped with an audio and video\nrecording device. He wore a device that recorded his interactions on his vehicle\u2019s equipment.\nHis conversation with the victims was recorded on this equipment.\n\n        On cross-examination, Officer Lawson agreed that the victims had stated the gunman\ntook approximately $650 in cash. He was again asked about the condition of the door.\nOfficer Lawson stated that \u201cthe strike plate . . . looked old and worn, and it looked like it had\nbeen knocked around a little bit, and it was cracked.\u201d He further described that it was\n\u201ccracked\u201d around \u201cthe strike plate[.]\u201d The frame was \u201c[c]racked and splintered a little bit[,]\u201d\nbut it \u201cwasn\u2019t knocked out or knocked on the ground[.]\u201d Officer Lawson agreed that the\ndoor had \u201cseen a lot of hard days[.]\u201d\n\n       On redirect, the officer elaborated as to more of the items reported missing: \u201c$650\ncash with miscellaneous bills, two cell phones, jewelry, more jewelry, keys to the . . .\nMercury. Some coins and miscellaneous assorted in a coin jar, kid\u2019s clothing and shoes.\u201d\nIt was also reported that the gunman took a wallet and a purse. The recording of Officer\nLawson\u2019s conversation with the victims was then played for the jury.\n\n       Over the recording, the victims can be heard telling Officer Lawson the details of the\nhome invasion, providing much of the same details as given in their trial testimony.\nHowever, Mr. Cobb can be heard saying that the Defendant had previously visited their\nhouse.\n\n        Following the presentation of proof, the jury found the Defendant guilty of one count\nof each of the following\u2014aggravated burglary, employing a firearm during the commission\nof a dangerous felony, and aggravated robbery. The jury also found the Defendant guilty of\naggravated assault as a lesser-included offense of aggravated robbery, but acquitted the\nDefendant of the especially aggravated kidnapping charges. Judge Richard Baumgartner was\nthe presiding judge over the Defendant\u2019s trial. After the verdict, Judge Baumgartner simply\nstated, \u201creal mixed verdict[,] . . . [v]ery interesting.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f       Thereafter, the original trial judge, Judge Baumgartner, pled guilty to one count of\nofficial misconduct and resigned from the bench. At that time, he had not expressly\napproved the verdict as thirteenth juror in this case.\n\n       Senior Judge Jon Kerry Blackwood conducted the Defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing on\nFebruary 18, 2011. The trial court merged the aggravated assault and aggravated robbery\nconvictions. After hearing the evidence, the judge sentenced the Defendant as follows: five\nyears for the aggravated burglary conviction; nine years for the employing a firearm during\nthe commission of a dangerous felony conviction; and ten years for the aggravated robbery\nconviction.1 The five-year sentence was ordered to run concurrently with the ten-year\nsentence but consecutively to the nine-year sentence, for a total sentence of nineteen years\nin the Department of Correction.\n\n       On March 17, 2011, the Defendant filed his motion for new trial and a renewed\nmotion for judgment of acquittal. He later amended his motion, rasing the issue, among\nothers, of whether the successor judge could properly act as thirteenth juror in this case.\nJudge Bob McGee was designated to hear the Defendant\u2019s motion for new trial. Therefore,\nJudge McGee, as the successor judge, was required to consider whether he could perform the\nthirteenth-juror review.\n\n      After a hearing, Judge McGee denied the motion for new trial and motion for\njudgment of acquittal, approving the verdict. Judge McGee reasoned as follows:\n\n        [I]t does appear that the [State v.] Biggs[, 218 S.W.3d 643 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n        2006),] case is limited to where, not just where [credibility] is overriding. I\n        think that\u2019s the word they use, but it\u2019s actually a situation where [credibility]\n        is the whole case.\n\n               It is limited pretty much to situations that we sometimes call he said,\n        she said, where the only evidence of the crime is the testimony, the victim, and\n        the only evidence rebutting that -- is the testimony of the defendant. And we\n        are post-trial now, the defendant\u2019s right to testify or not to testify was\n        protected at the trial and he made his decision. In judging retrospectively,\n\n1\n   We note that the original judgment form for the Defendant\u2019s employing a firearm during the commission\nof a dangerous felony conviction, a Class C felony, reflects that he was a sentenced as a Range I, standard\noffender. However, the Defendant received a nine-year sentence for this conviction, which is outside of the\nstandard offender range for a Class C felony. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-112(a)(3) (A Range I sentence\nfor a Class C felony is not less than three nor more than six years). The judgment form for the employing\na firearm conviction was later \u201ccorrected to a multiple offender status and a multiple 35% release eligibility.\u201d\nHowever, nothing in the record supports the decision to enhance the Defendant to Range II.\n\n                                                      -7-\n\f       what the quality of the verdict was. Certainly we are -- we have to take into\n       consideration what the testimony was and the fact is in this case there was no\n       testimony contradicting the testimony of the victims. None.\n\n               We don\u2019t have witness versus witness here. We have witness versus\n       argument and that\u2019s not what the Biggs case is about. Also, I did read the\n       transcript. The tenor of the testimony of the victim\u2019s was not that they refused\n       to take their clothes off because they were standing up to the guy. They both\n       testified they were scared to death that if they moved at all he would shoot\n       them. The jury apparently accepted that testimony.\n\n               Also, there was never any real dispute that the defendant was present\n       in the premises and that he stole things from them. So, it\u2019s not even by -- you\n       can\u2019t even say that the idea was floated to the jury that none of this ever\n       happened. That wasn\u2019t in any way presented to the jury. And there was\n       evidence to support the proposition that there was a breaking and entering,\n       damage to the back door. Particularly the witness, I think Jessica Greene, Ms.\n       Greene at least testified that the bottom lock, she called it, was broken. So,\n       this is not a situation where the case hangs entirely on [credibility]. The\n       [credibility] of the victims was not rebutted. There was nothing for the jury to\n       weigh in opposition to the [credibility] of the witnesses. They found the\n       witnesses to be credible and they also apparently gave considerable attention\n       to the case and reflected upon it because they found him not guilty of the\n       kidnapping charges. And it would appear to this [c]ourt that the jury did what\n       they were supposed to. They did a good job and this [c]ourt does accept their\n       vedict.\n\nThis timely appeal followed.\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\n       On appeal, the Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for\nnew trial \u201cwhere the credibility of the witnesses was the sole issue at trial and the trial judge\ndid not fulfill his obligation as thirteenth juror prior to being replaced by a successor judge.\u201d\nSpecifically, the Defendant submits that\n\n                [i]t is error for a judge, sitting as thirteenth juror, to assume that there\n       is no issue of witness credibility merely because there was not evidence\n       presented by the defense. . . . [T]he jury and the judge as thirteenth juror are\n       still tasked with the role of determining whether they believe the testimony of\n\n                                                -8-\n\f       the State\u2019s witnesses and whether the State\u2019s proof is sufficient to convict,\n       both in terms of quantity and reliability.\n\n       The State responds that the successor judge did not err or abuse his discretion in\ndetermining that he could act as thirteenth juror because witness credibility was not the\noverriding issue in this case. The State explains that the successor judge correctly\ndetermined that credibility was not an overriding issue because the witnesses\u2019 testimony was\nnot rebutted, and defense counsel stated the theory of defense was that the Defendant was\nthere by invitation and simply stole some things while the victims were not looking.\n\n        Rule 33(d) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that \u201c[t]he trial court may\ngrant a new trial following a verdict of guilty if it disagrees with the jury about the weight\nof the evidence.\u201d This rule \u201cis the modern equivalent to the \u2018thirteenth juror rule,\u2019 whereby\nthe trial court must weigh the evidence and grant a new trial if the evidence preponderates\nagainst the weight of the verdict.\u201d State v. Blanton, 926 S.W.2d 953, 958 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n1996)). In State v. Carter, the supreme court interpreted this rule as \u201cimpos[ing] upon a trial\ncourt judge the mandatory duty to serve as the thirteenth juror in every criminal case[.]\u201d 896\nS.W.2d 119, 122 (Tenn. 1995). The supreme court also held that \u201capproval by the trial judge\nof the jury\u2019s verdict as the thirteenth juror is a necessary prerequisite to imposition of a valid\njudgment.\u201d Id.\n\n        In situations when a trial judge is unable to perform post-verdict duties, Rule 25(b)(1)\nof the Rules of Criminal Procedure provides: \u201cAfter a verdict of guilty, any judge regularly\npresiding in or who is assigned to a court may complete the court\u2019s duties if the judge before\nwhom the trial began cannot proceed because of absence, death sickness, or other disability.\u201d\nRule 25(b)(2) elaborates that \u201c[t]he successor judge may grant a new trial when that judge\nconcludes that he or she cannot perform those duties because of the failure to preside at the\ntrial or for any other reason.\u201d This court has held that a successor judge\u2019s consideration,\npursuant to Rule 25(b) of whether the duties of the original judge with regard to a motion for\nnew trial can be met in a particular case \u201cmust include an assessment of his or her ability to\nact as a thirteenth juror, including witness credibility.\u201d State v. Nail, 963 S.W.2d 761, 765\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1997); see also State v. Biggs, 218 S.W.3d 643, 653-54 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n2006); State v. Brown, 53 S.W.3d 264, 275 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000). This assessment in\nturn requires the successor judge to determine \u201cthe extent to which witness credibility was\na factor in the case and the extent to which he [or she] had sufficient knowledge or records\nbefore him [or her] in order to decide whether the credible evidence, as viewed by the judge,\nadequately supported the verdict.\u201d Nail, 963 S.W.2d at 766; see also Biggs, 218 S.W.3d at\n654; Brown, 53 S.W.3d at 275. If these determinations cannot be made by the successor\njudge, then the verdict cannot be approved and a new trial must be granted. See Biggs, 218\nS.W.3d at 654; Brown, 53 S.W.3d at 275; Nail, 963 S.W.2d at 766.\n\n                                               -9-\n\f       The Defendant relies on State v. Biggs, wherein this court ruled that the successor\njudge was required to grant a new trial because the presiding judge did not rule as the\nthirteenth juror and unresolved credibility issues remained. 218 S.W.3d at 654. Just as in\nBiggs, the statements by the presiding judge in this case, \u201creal mixed verdict[,] . . . [v]ery\ninteresting[,]\u201d were ambiguous as to whether he approved the jury\u2019s verdict. See id.\nTherefore, we must address whether the successor judge erroneously concluded that he could\nsufficiently familiarize himself with the written record in order to act as the thirteenth juror\nand approve the jury\u2019s verdict. See id. at 654-55.\n\n        \u201cGiven the statement made by our supreme court regarding the purpose of the\nthirteenth juror rule, it is difficult to see how a trial judge who has not heard the evidence and\nwho has not seen the witnesses can act as the thirteenth juror when weight and credibility are\nissues.\u201d Brown, 53 S.W.3d at 275. \u201cWhen a trial judge is asked to review the weight and\ncredibility of the evidence as the thirteenth juror based upon a written record, the trial judge\n\u2018is in no better position to evaluate the weight of the evidence than an appellate court.\u2019\u201d Id.\n(quoting State v. Moats, 906 S.W.2d 431, 435 (Tenn. 1995)). The appellate courts have no\nindependent authority to act as thirteenth juror. See State v. Burlison, 868 S.W.2d 713, 719\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1993).\n\n       In Biggs, the jury convicted the defendant of aggravated sexual battery. 218 S.W.3d\nat 652. The Biggs court found that the successor judge was required to grant a new trial\nbecause the presiding judge did not rule as the thirteenth juror, as there were unresolved\ncredibility issues, reasoning as follows:\n\n              This case involved accusations by the victim and her parents and a\n       denial of any wrongdoing by the defendant, with no physical evidence present.\n       Witness credibility was an overriding issue in this case. The jury chose to\n       accredit the testimony of the victim and her parents. However, the successor\n       judge was not at the trial to see any of the witnesses testify and would have\n       been unable to make a credibility determination from the written record. A\n       successor judge cannot rule on a motion for a new trial if witness credibility\n       is an overriding issue.\n\nId. at 655.\n\n       The present case is indistinguishable from Biggs. The fact that the Defendant did not\nput on any proof to rebut the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses does not, by itself, mean that\ncredibility was not an overriding issue. The validity of the Defendant\u2019s convictions depends\nupon the jury\u2019s and ultimately the judge\u2019s, acting as thirteenth juror, determinations of the\ncredibility and weight of the victims\u2019 testimony. Even if the Defendant conceded his\n\n                                              -10-\n\fpresence at the scene, there were still credibility determinations to be made regarding the\nelements of the offenses, i.e., whether he entered the house forcefully and wielded a gun\nwhile stealing the victims\u2019 possessions. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 39-13-102 (under the facts\nof this case, \u201c[a] person commits aggravated assault who . . . [i]ntentionally or knowingly\ncommits an assault as defined in \u00a7 39-13-101, and . . . [u]ses or displays a deadly weapon\u201d);\n39-13-402 (aggravated robbery, as relevant here, is \u201crobbery as defined in \u00a7 39-13-401 [and\na]ccomplished with a deadly weapon or by display of any article used or fashioned to lead\nthe victim to reasonably believe it to be a deadly weapon\u201d); 39-14-403(as charged here,\naggravated burglary is entry of a habitation without the effective consent of the property\nowner and with the intent to commit a theft); 39-17-1324 (possession of a firearm offense).\nThe victims testified that the Defendant kicked in their back door, entered their home, held\nthem at gunpoint, and stole their things, including their car. Only the car was later recovered,\nand no evidence presented during the trial connected the Defendant to the car other than the\nvictims\u2019 testimony.2 No gun was ever found. Officer Lawson testified that the strike plate\non the door was \u201cold and worn\u201d and \u201clooked like it had been knocked around a little bit, and\nit was cracked.\u201d He agreed on cross-examination that the door had \u201cseen a lot of hard\ndays[.]\u201d Other than the victims\u2019 own statements, no one provided any independent\nknowledge of what was taken from the victims, that it was taken at gunpoint, or that the\nDefendant entered the residence forcibly. The recordings of the 911 call and from Officer\nLawson\u2019s vehicle serve simply to bolster the victims\u2019 credibility; they do not provide\nindependent evidence that the statements made in the recordings or that the victims\u2019 trial\ntestimony are true. Upon review, we conclude that witness credibility was an overriding\nissue and that a new trial is therefore required.\n\n\n\n\n2\n We note that opening and closing statements were not transcribed and included in the record on appeal.\nOutside the presence of the jury, defense counsel summarized the theory of defense as follows:\n\n        [I]t will be our position today that [the Defendant] was there by invitation, having spent\n        several days there at the invitation of the roommate, his cousin, and that he did take some\n        items from them, but that he did not do so by force. He waited until they were basically not\n        paying attention, grabbed their marijuana and their car keys and took off in their car.\n\nThe trial court asked, \u201cAnd you claim there was no weapon, and that he just stole certain items while they\nweren\u2019t looking--watching.\u201d Defense counsel replied, \u201cThat\u2019s what my client tells me, your Honor, yes sir.\u201d\nHowever, the statements of counsel are not evidence. At trial, neither victim testified that the Defendant was\nat their house that evening by invitation. Additionally, Mr. Cobb testified that the Defendant had never been\ninside the residence. Defense counsel\u2019s statement that the Defendant was there by invitation and\nsubsequently stole the car was not evidence and was not supported by the evidence adduced at trial.\n\n                                                    -11-\n\f                                      CONCLUSION\n\n       Based upon the foregoing reasoning and authorities, we conclude that the successor\njudge could not properly act as thirteenth juror in this case because credibility was an\noverriding issue. The judgments of the trial court are reversed, and this case is remanded for\na new trial.\n\n\n                                                    _________________________________\n                                                    D.
