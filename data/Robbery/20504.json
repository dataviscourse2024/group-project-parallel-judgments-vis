Proc. Ann. art. 1.051(g) (Vernon 2005).[1]\u00a0\r\nThe Court of Criminal Appeals has expressly held otherwise.\u00a0 See Burgess v.\r\nState, 816 S.W.2d 424, 429-31 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991) (A[W]e hold that\r\nwhen an accused affirmatively asserts his right to self\u2011representation .\r\n. . , a written waiver of the right to counsel is not required under [article\r\n1.051].@); see also 42\r\nGeorge E. Dix &amp; Robert O. Dawson, Texas Practice: Criminal Practice and\r\nProcedure, ' 24.26 (2d ed. 2001) (discussing Burgess).\u00a0\r\nAppellant here waived counsel in conjunction with an affirmative assertion of\r\nhis right to self-representation.\u00a0 Accordingly, under Burgess, we\r\noverrule appellant=s first issue.\r\n\r\nAdmonishments\r\n\r\nIn his second issue, appellant contends that the trial\r\ncourt erred in failing to provide adequate admonishments on the dangers and\r\ndisadvantages of self-representation.\u00a0 Before a defendant invokes the right to\r\nself\u2011representation, he or she should be made aware of the dangers and\r\ndisadvantages of self\u2011representation such that the record establishes a\r\nchoice Amade with his eyes\r\nopen.@\u00a0 Faretta v.\r\nCalifornia, 422 U.S. 806, 835 (1975).\u00a0 Faretta does not mandate a\r\nformulaic inquiry concerning a defendant=s age, education,\r\nbackground, or previous mental health history.\u00a0 Blankenship v. State,\r\n673 S.W.2d 578, 583 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984).\u00a0 The trial court must make,\r\nhowever, proper admonishments concerning pro se representation and sufficient\r\ninquiries to assess whether the defendant is making a knowing exercise of the\r\nright to defend himself.\u00a0 Id.\u00a0 Viewed from the appellate standpoint, the\r\nrecord must reflect that the defendant was made aware of the dangers and\r\ndisadvantages of self\u2011representation and, thus, that he intelligently and\r\nunderstandingly rejected the assistance of counsel.\u00a0 Goffney v. State,\r\n843 S.W.2d 583, 584-85 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992).\r\n\r\nIn his brief, appellant states that\r\n\r\n[t]he trial court only asked the\r\nAppellant whether he had any formal legal training (which Appellant had not),\r\nwhether he had any experience in self representation in any criminal cases\r\n(which Appellant had only once), why Appellant did not want an appointed\r\nlawyer, and if Appellant felt he had Asufficient\r\nknowledge@ to represent himself, and then announced that he\r\n[sic] would allow Appellant to go forward and represent himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an incomplete representation of the trial court=s inquiry and\r\nadmonishments.\u00a0 After appellant indicated a desire to represent himself, the\r\ncourt queried appellant and admonished him at some length.\u00a0 The judge began by\r\ntelling appellant that she did not think it was smart for a defendant to\r\nrepresent him or herself.\u00a0 She inquired of appellant exactly why he wanted to\r\nrepresent himself.\u00a0 She explained at length that while sometimes defendants don=t like hearing\r\nwhat appointed counsel has to say, counsel may just be truthfully analyzing the\r\nstrength of the case against the defendant.\u00a0 She also informed appellant that\r\nin her experience, defendants who are represented by counsel have a better\r\nchance of being found not guilty or of getting a lesser sentence than\r\ndefendants who represent themselves.\r\n\r\nThe judge asked appellant his age (35), his level of\r\neducation (graduated from New York University with a business degree), his\r\nprior employment (included seven years with Citibank), whether he had ever been\r\ntreated for mental illness (no), whether he had ever represented himself (yes,\r\nin a month-and-a-half-long federal fraud trial), and whether he had\r\nparticipated in any other trials with counsel (yes, a two-and-a-half-week-long\r\nstate fraud trial in which the jury found him not guilty).\u00a0 She also asked him\r\nwhether he had learned anything about the Federal Rules of Evidence and whether\r\nhe understood that there were differences between the Federal Rules and Texas\r\nRules; he answered Ayes@ to both\r\nquestions.\u00a0 She asked him whether he was familiar with the level and punishment\r\nranges of the charged offenses, and he indicated that he was.\u00a0 He also showed a\r\nknowledge regarding possible enhancement of the punishment range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe told him several times that he would receive no favors\r\nfrom the court by choosing self-representation and that the prosecution might\r\nattempt to exploit his lack of knowledge.\u00a0 She further grilled him at length\r\nregarding various nuances of the evidentiary rules.\u00a0 She told him that he could\r\nconceivably be found guilty simply because he did not know how to ask a\r\nquestion properly or because he did not know the correct objection to make.\u00a0\r\nShe told him that he would not be able to complain on appeal that he had\r\nreceived ineffective representation.\u00a0 Lastly, she asked him if he was familiar\r\nwith various rules, procedures, and strategies relating to picking a jury.\u00a0 At\r\nthe conclusion of this exchange, appellant asserted his right to\r\nself-representation.\r\n\r\nAppellant does not suggest any additional questions that\r\nthe judge should have asked or any additional information the judge should have\r\nimparted.\u00a0 On this record, we find that the judge thoroughly questioned and\r\nadmonished appellant regarding his knowledge and experience and the pitfalls of\r\nself-representation.\u00a0 Accordingly, we overrule appellant=s second issue.\r\n\r\nWaiver of Self-Representation\r\n\r\nIn his third issue, appellant contends that the trial court\r\nerred in refusing to provide him with counsel when he attempted to revoke his\r\nwaiver of counsel at the beginning of voir dire.\u00a0 Appellant waived counsel and\r\nasserted his right to self-representation on July 26, 2005.\u00a0 On January 30,\r\n2006, a venire panel was seated, and the judge began talking to them.\u00a0 At that\r\npoint, appellant expressed confusion regarding who would determine punishment\r\nif he was found guilty.\u00a0 Ultimately, during a bench conference, appellant asked\r\nthe judge to Akick [him] out of court@ and stated AI give up my right\r\nto represent myself.\u00a0 I can=t do this.@\u00a0 The judge told\r\nappellant that she was not going to do that, instructed him to take a seat, and\r\ncontinued with voir dire.\u00a0 Appellant contends that in refusing to grant his\r\nrequest to withdraw his waiver of the right to counsel, the trial judge\r\nviolated his United States and Texas constitutional rights to counsel.\u00a0 U.S. Const. amend. VI; Tex. Const. art. I, ' 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Medley v. State, 47 S.W.3d 17 (Tex. App.CAmarillo 2000,\r\npet. ref=d), cert.\r\ndenied, 126 S. Ct. 621 (2005), the Amarillo Court of appeals dealt with a\r\nsimilar request made on the day that trial was to begin.\u00a0 In analyzing the\r\nissue, the court looked to the Court of Criminal Appeals= opinion in Marquez\r\nv. State, 921 S.W.2d 217 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (plurality op.).\u00a0 Although Marquez\r\nspecifically involved a last-minute assertion of a defendant=s right to a jury\r\ntrial, the Medley court found its analysis applicable to last minute\r\nassertions of the right to counsel. \u00a0Medley, 47 S.W.3d at 24.\u00a0 We\r\nagree.\u00a0 In Marquez, the Court first noted that even for constitutional\r\nclaims, the party seeking to change the status quo bears the burden of showing\r\nfacts entitling him to relief.\u00a0 921 S.W.2d at 222.\u00a0 Consequently, a criminal\r\ndefendant who has waived a right but then seeks to reclaim that right must show\r\nthat he or she revoked the waiver sufficiently in advance of trial so that it\r\nwould not (1) interfere with the orderly administration of court business, (2)\r\nresult in unnecessary delay or inconvenience to witnesses, or (3) prejudice the\r\nState.\u00a0 Id. at 223; Medley 47 S.W.2d at 24.\u00a0 Any showing by the\r\ndefendant may be rebutted by the State, the trial court, or the record\r\nitself.\u00a0\u00a0 Marquez, 921 S.W.2d at 223; Medley, 47 S.W.3d at 24.\u00a0\r\nThe trial court=s ruling on the reclamation of a waived\r\nright is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.\u00a0 Marquez, 921\r\nS.W.2d at 223.\r\n\r\nThe record in Medley demonstrated that (1) the\r\ndefendant had not caused or sought any delays in the proceedings prior to his\r\nwaiver of his right to self-representation; in fact, the defendant had\r\nindicated a desire to speed the process along[2];\r\n(2) the defendant=s standby counsel had been his trial\r\ncounsel prior to the defendant=s waiver of his right to counsel and had\r\nbeen actively involved in the case throughout; and (3) the defendant did not\r\nrequest any postponement related to his request to reclaim his right to\r\ncounsel, and there was no indication standby counsel was unwilling or\r\nunprepared to try the case immediately. \u00a0Medley, 47 S.W.3d at 24-25.\u00a0\r\nBased on these facts, the court reversed the conviction and ordered a new\r\ntrial.\u00a0 Id. at 25-26.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, the record demonstrates that appellant requested\r\nremoval of his original standby counsel (and former trial counsel) on November\r\n8, 2005.\u00a0 Appellant then did not request new standby counsel, and new standby\r\ncounsel was not appointed, until the start of trial on January 30, 2006.\u00a0 Thus,\r\nit is very unlikely that standby counsel would have been willing or prepared to\r\ntry the case immediately.\u00a0 See id. at 25; see also United States v.\r\nTaylor, 933 F.2d 307, 311 (5th Cir. 1991) (holding that trial court erred\r\nin refusing defendant=s request for counsel during sentencing\r\nphase where standby counsel was present and had participated in guilt/innocence\r\nphase).\u00a0 The evidence regarding earlier delays is not very revealing.\u00a0 The\r\nrecord shows that in a letter to the judge, appellant requested more time to\r\nprepare for trial, but he objected in a separate letter to the fact that trial\r\nhad been rescheduled.\u00a0 Although the case was reset numerous times, there is\r\nlittle explanation in the record.\u00a0 At the beginning of voir dire, when\r\nappellant indicated his desire for counsel, the judge explained to him that the\r\ncase had been set for trial for seven months and that she had told him the week\r\nbefore that they were going to pick a jury and proceed to trial on that date.\u00a0\r\nAlthough appellant did not explicitly request a continuance on the day of\r\ntrial, he did ask the judge to Akick [him] out of court@ and providing\r\ncounsel at that point certainly would have resulted in a delay in order for new\r\ncounsel to become acquainted with the case.\u00a0 Accordingly, this case is\r\ndistinguishable from the facts in Medley.\r\n\r\nIn short, unlike the defendant in Medley, appellant\r\nhere did not overcome his burden of showing that his reassertion of the right\r\nto counsel would not have (1) interfered with the orderly administration of the\r\ncourt=s business, (2)\r\nresulted in unnecessary delay or inconvenience to witnesses, or (3) prejudiced\r\nthe State.\u00a0 Therefore, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion\r\nin refusing to grant appellant=s request for counsel.\u00a0 We overrule\r\nappellant=s third issue.\r\n\r\nMotion to Recuse\r\n\r\nIn his fourth issue, appellant contends that his motion to\r\nrecuse the trial judge should have been granted because the judge was partial,\r\nbiased, and prejudiced against him.\u00a0 Specifically, appellant asserts that the\r\ntrial judge refused to allow him medical treatment for a Asevere left eye\r\ninfection@ impacting his ability to observe witnesses during\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe record reflects that during trial, before the first\r\nwitness took the stand on February 1, 2006, appellant asked if he could\r\napproach the bench.\u00a0 When permitted to do so, appellant told the judge that he\r\ncould not see out of his left eye.\u00a0 He said that he thought it was caused by\r\npollen but was not sure.\u00a0 The judge suggested that appellant use some water and\r\na tissue on the eye and sit closer to the witnesses in order to see them\r\nbetter.\u00a0 Appellant agreed.\u00a0 When the prosecutor passed the witness, after the\r\nequivalent of 36 record pages of testimony, appellant again asked to approach\r\nthe bench.\u00a0 Appellant then told the judge that his eye problem was getting\r\nworse and that he could not see the witness out of his left eye.\u00a0 Appellant\r\nstated Aso that the record\r\nis clear, my eye is obviously continuing to water and it=s red.@\u00a0 He requested\r\nthat the judge Alet [him] get something for it.@\u00a0 The judge told\r\nappellant that he could move to where he could see the witness better but that\r\nthey were not going to take a break at that point.\u00a0 She said that maybe he\r\ncould get some drops for it during the lunch break.\u00a0 She also said A[f]or purposes of\r\nthe record, it looks like you have allergies.@\r\n\r\nAppellant cross-examined the witness for the equivalent of\r\neleven record pages before the proceedings recessed for lunch.\u00a0 After lunch,\r\nthe judge dismissed the jury for the remainder of the day so that appellant\r\ncould seek medical attention.\u00a0 When trial began again the next day, nothing was\r\nsaid on the record about appellant=s eye condition,\r\nand appellant continued his cross-examination of the witness.\r\n\r\nThat same day, a hearing was held before a different\r\npresiding judge on appellant=s motion to recuse the trial judge.\u00a0\r\nDuring this hearing, the court reporter and prosecutor testified to events in\r\nsimilar detail to those described above.\u00a0 Stand-by counsel for appellant,\r\nhowever, testified that appellant may have requested medical attention as early\r\nas the first bench conference and that the judge refused to stop the\r\nproceedings so he could be taken to the jail for treatment.\u00a0 During\r\ncross-examination by the prosecutor, counsel acknowledged that prior to the day\r\non which appellant had the eye problem, he had been wearing glasses, but on\r\nthat day he was wearing contact lenses.\u00a0 He also remembered appellant=s saying at one\r\npoint that his problem might be related to the contact lenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant also testified, stating that he had difficulty\r\nwith his eye from the time he woke up that morning, before he put in his\r\ncontact lenses.\u00a0 He said that it may have been due to a pollen allergy.\u00a0 He\r\nsaid that the eye began to hurt and at some point he realized that he could not\r\nsee out of the eye at all.\u00a0 Once in court, he informed the judge and requested\r\nthat she allow him to return to the jail to seek medical attention, but she\r\nrefused.\u00a0 He said that it might have interfered with the way he questioned the\r\nwitness, but he could not be sure.\u00a0 He was taken to see a doctor by the\r\nbailiff, and the doctor initially diagnosed him with acute vision loss in his\r\nleft eye.\u00a0 According to appellant, the trial judge then called the doctor and\r\ntold the doctor that appellant had been trying to delay the proceedings.\u00a0 He\r\ntestified that he was subsequently taken to an emergency room and then released\r\nwithout a diagnosis.\u00a0 He said that at the time of the hearing, he was still\r\nhaving problems with the eye but could now see out of it.\r\n\r\nIn both criminal and civil cases, motions to recuse the\r\ntrial judge are governed by rules 18a and 18b of the Texas Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure.\u00a0 Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a,\r\n18b; see also Wesbrook v. State, 29 S.W.3d 103, 120 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n2000).\u00a0 We review the denial of a motion to recuse under an abuse of discretion\r\nstandard.\u00a0 Tex. R. Civ. P. 18a(f).\u00a0\r\nThus, we will not reverse a ruling on the motion if it is within the zone of\r\nreasonable disagreement.\u00a0 Wesbrook, 29 S.W.3d at 120-21.\u00a0 The impartiality\r\nof a trial judge is presumed, and the defendant has the burden of rebutting\r\nthis presumption.\u00a0 Id. at 121.\u00a0 The grounds upon which recusal may be\r\nbased include, among others:\u00a0 (1) when the judge=s impartiality\r\nmight reasonably be questioned, and (2) when the judge has a personal bias or\r\nprejudice concerning the subject matter of the case or a party.\u00a0 Tex. R. Civ. P. 18b(2)(a), (b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, to merit recusal, partiality or bias must stem\r\nfrom an extrajudicial source and affect the judge=s opinion on the\r\nmerits of the case.\u00a0 See Roman v. State, 145 S.W.3d 316, 321\r\n(Tex. App.CHouston [14th Dist.] 2004, pet. ref=d) (citing United\r\nStates v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 583 (1966), and Kemp v. State,\r\n846 S.W.2d 289, 305\u201106 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992)).\u00a0 Absent proof of an extra\u2011judicial\r\nsource, the only proper basis for recusal on grounds of partiality or bias is\r\nan indication of a high degree of favoritism or antagonism.\u00a0 Id. at\r\n322.\u00a0 Furthermore, partiality or bias may only be a ground for recusal when it\r\nis of such a nature and extent as to deny the movant due process of law.\u00a0 See\r\nKemp, 846 S.W.2d at 305.\u00a0 The test is whether a reasonable person, knowing\r\nall of the circumstances involved, would have a reasonable doubt as to the\r\nimpartiality of the trial judge.\u00a0 Id.; Burkett v. State, 196\r\nS.W.3d 892, 896 (Tex. App.CTexarkana 2006, no pet.).\r\n\r\nHere, the record demonstrates that when appellant first\r\napproached the bench regarding his eye condition, the judge attempted to help\r\nappellant by providing water and a tissue and by allowing him to move closer.[3]\u00a0\r\nWhen appellant approached the second time, the trial judge refused to halt the\r\nproceedings to allow him to seek medical attention.\u00a0 Appellant then\r\ncross-examined a witness for the equivalent of eleven record pages before the\r\njudge recessed for lunch and permitted appellant to seek medical attention. The\r\njudge subsequently recessed the trial until the next morning, at which time\r\nappellant appeared and made no mention of his eye condition on the record.\u00a0\r\nAppellant does not cite to any evidence demonstrating that any actions by the\r\njudge stemmed from an extra-judicial source.\u00a0 The judge stated on the record\r\nthat appellant=s eye condition appeared to result from allergies.\u00a0\r\nAppellant testified at the recusal hearing that he could not see out of his\r\nleft eye on the day in question.\u00a0 However, as fact-finder, the judge presiding\r\nover the recusal hearing was not required to accept as true appellant=s own testimony\r\nregarding the severity of the eye condition.\u00a0 See Dishner v. Huitt\u2011Zollars,\r\nInc., 162 S.W.3d 370, 375 (Tex. App.CDallas 2005, no\r\npet.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from appellant=s assertions,\r\nthere is no evidence in the record that he was unable to see out of his eye or\r\nthat the condition affected his ability to view the witnesses.\u00a0 Given the lack\r\nof evidence concerning the nature of appellant=s eye condition\r\nand the fact that the trial judge only required appellant to examine a witness\r\nfor a relatively brief period of time before allowing him to seek medical\r\nattention and recessing trial for the day,\u00a0 we find that appellant failed to\r\ndemonstrate that any bias, prejudice, or partiality on the part of the trial\r\njudge stemmed from an extrajudicial source, demonstrated a high degree of\r\nfavoritism or antagonism, or was of such a nature and extent as to deny the\r\nmovant due process of law.\u00a0 Accordingly, we cannot say that the judge ruling on\r\nthe motion to recuse abused her discretion in denying the motion.\u00a0 We overrule\r\nappellant=s fourth issue.\r\n\r\nImpeachment Evidence\r\n\r\nIn his fifth issue, appellant complains that a prosecution\r\nwitness testified during cross-examination that appellant was on probation.\u00a0 He\r\nasserts that the nonresponsive testimony\u00a0 impeached him by attacking his\r\ncharacter before he even testified.\u00a0 See generally Tex.

Code Crim. Proc.

State,\r\n203 S.W.3d 581, 590 (Tex. App.CHouston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet. h.).\u00a0\r\nThe rule against such comments is grounded in the fact that A[j]urors are prone\r\nto seize with alacrity upon any conduct or language of the trial judge which\r\nthey may interpret as shedding light upon his view of the weight of the evidence,\r\nor the merits of the issues involved.@\u00a0 Brown v.\r\nState, 122 S.W.3d 794, 798 (Tex.
