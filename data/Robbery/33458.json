Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt of burglary in the third degree beyond a reasonable doubt and that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence (see, CPL 470.15 [5]). The propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s comments on summation have not been preserved for appellate review (see, People v Medina, 53 NY2d 951, 953) and, in any event, under the circumstances of this case, any error *298was harmless. Brown, J. P., Rubin, Kooper and Sullivan, JJ., concur.\n",
