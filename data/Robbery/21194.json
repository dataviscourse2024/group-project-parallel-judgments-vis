Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 22.011(a)(2),\r\n(f), 22.021(a)(1)(B)(i), (2)(A)(ii), (e) (Vernon Supp. 2010).\u00a0 Jasso was\r\nsentenced to ninety-nine years\u2019 incarceration plus a $10,000 fine for each count\r\nof aggravated sexual assault and twenty years\u2019 incarceration plus a $10,000\r\nfine for the sexual assault count.\u00a0 The trial court ordered that the sentences\r\nfor four of the aggravated sexual assault convictions (counts 1, 4, 8, and 9)\r\nbe served concurrently after the completion of a prior sentence in an unrelated\r\ncase and that the remaining convictions (counts 7, 10, and 11) be served\r\nconsecutively upon the completion of the concurrent sentences in counts 1, 4,\r\n8, and 9.[1]\u00a0\r\nBy six issues, Jasso contends that:\u00a0 (1) the evidence is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient \u201cto support the conclusion that appellant is the \u2018Joe Richard\u2019 the\r\nsubject of the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt in counts [1 and 4]\u201d; (2) the evidence\r\nis legally and factually insufficient \u201cto support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt\r\nregarding counts [1 and 4]\u201d; (3) the trial court\u2019s cumulation of the sentences\r\nimposed for counts 7, 10, and 11 constitutes cruel and unusual punishment; and\r\n(4) the trial court erred in cumulating the sentences with a prior sentence.\u00a0 We\r\naffirm.\r\n\r\nI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nIn this case, the State alleged that Jasso sexually\r\nassaulted three girls:\u00a0 A.L., S.K., and S.S.\u00a0 At the time of the alleged\r\nincidents, the girls were four, thirteen, and fourteen years old,\r\nrespectively.\u00a0 The investigation into Jasso\u2019s involvement began when Leo\r\nCampos, the stepfather of A.L., wrote the Bee County District Attorney\u2019s Office\r\n(the \u201cDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office\u201d) describing a conversation he had with A.L.\r\nwhen she visited him in jail.[2]\u00a0\r\nIn several letters written to the District Attorney\u2019s Office, Campos stated\r\nthat A.L. had told him that \u201cJoe\u201d had touched her private parts and that \u201cJoe\u201d\r\ntold her that he would hurt her if she told anyone.\u00a0 At trial, Campos testified\r\nthat when A.L. told him what had happened with \u201cJoe,\u201d he noticed \u201cthat\r\nsomething was wrong with her\u201d and that she appeared to be upset.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the letters from Campos, the District\r\nAttorney\u2019s Office forwarded the letters to the police, and the police began\r\ninvestigating A.L.\u2019s living situation.\u00a0 The police later discovered that A.L.\r\nlived with several other individuals in a house in Bee County, Texas.\u00a0 Among\r\nthose living with A.L. was S.S., a girl whom A.L. refers to as her sister even\r\nthough the girls are not related.\u00a0 S.S. testified that she was fourteen years\r\nold when she first began dating Jasso in May 2004.\u00a0 Jasso was twenty-two years\r\nold at the time he and S.S. began their relationship.\u00a0 S.S. had recently\r\nattempted to commit suicide by ingesting numerous medications found in the\r\nhouse, and she admitted that she had low self-esteem and enjoyed smoking\r\nmarihuana.\u00a0 Jasso provided S.S. with marihuana regularly, and the two began having\r\nsexual intercourse shortly after meeting one another in a park.\u00a0 S.S. and Jasso\r\nadmitted at trial that Jasso penetrated S.S.\u2019s sexual organ with his fingers\r\nand penis two or three times each day that they were dating.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nS.S. noted that she had problems with her mother; that\r\nher mother had \u201cstopped paying attention to [her]\u201d; and that her mother, D.S.,\r\ndid not initially approve of her dating Jasso.\u00a0 Despite D.S.\u2019s disapproval of\r\nJasso, he regularly stayed overnight with S.S. and woke in the morning to make\r\nA.L. breakfast.\u00a0 S.S. slept in very late each day, not waking until 3:00 or\r\n4:00 in the afternoon.\u00a0 S.S. also recalled that A.L. would often accompany S.S.\r\nand Jasso when they would run errands for S.S.\u2019s mother.\u00a0 S.S. admitted to\r\nsmoking marihuana with Jasso while in front of A.L. and that she and Jasso\r\nwould buy A.L. candy and make her promise to keep S.S. and Jasso\u2019s smoking\r\nhabits a secret.\u00a0 S.S. testified that A.L. and Jasso \u201calways played together\u201d;\r\nhowever, S.S. testified that shortly after she and Jasso broke up, A.L. told\r\nher mother that Jasso had molested her.\u00a0 S.S. noticed that A.L. would\r\nmasturbate when her mother was asleep and that she would play \u201cdirty\u201d with her\r\ndolls.[3]\u00a0\r\nS.S. recounted that her relationship with Jasso ended when he began dating\r\nS.K., a girl who was several years younger than S.S.\u00a0 S.S. stated that at the\r\ntime A.L. described the alleged molestation incident to Campos in September\r\n2008, S.S. was dating Joe Richard Estrada and that A.L. was not living with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nD.S., S.S.\u2019s mother and the foster mother of A.L.,\r\ntestified that she was aware of Jasso sneaking into the house to have sex with\r\nS.S. and that she allowed it because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to lose [S.S. after her\r\nsuicide attempt] so I just let her do it.\u201d\u00a0 D.S. stated that A.L. always slept\r\nin D.S.\u2019s bedroom and that she did not suspect that anything had happened to\r\nA.L. until A.L. made her outcry.\u00a0 D.S. recalled that A.L. first told her about\r\nthe molestation incident after S.S. had told A.L. that she had seen Jasso at\r\nthe jail.\u00a0 A.L. told D.S. that she did not say anything about the incident for\r\nseveral years because Jasso had threatened to hurt A.L. or her family if she\r\nsaid anything.\u00a0 D.S. then testified to the following:\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n[S.S.] had said that she seen [sic] Joe [at the jail], a few days later [A.L.]\r\nsaid that when she was living in Navy housing Joe Jasso had touched her or\r\ntouched her private area.\u00a0 She said that he made her breakfast and took her to\r\nthe garage and told her to lay [sic] down and take her pants down.\u00a0 Then he\r\nstarted touching her around her vagina area.\u00a0 Another time she said that he put\r\nhis fingers inside her vagina.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAfter\r\ntelling D.S. about the incident, A.L. became very afraid.\u00a0 A.L. did not want to\r\ngo to the bathroom by herself or sleep by herself.\u00a0 She also began to have\r\nnightmares about Jasso.\u00a0 D.S. stated that she was very upset about the incident\r\nbut that she did not have an opportunity to file a complaint with police before\r\nCampos did.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 S.K.,\r\na young girl who also had previously attempted to commit suicide, testified\r\nthat she and Jasso began dating when she was thirteen years old and was in the\r\nseventh grade.\u00a0 Their relationship began shortly after Jasso left S.S.\u00a0 S.K.\r\nacknowledged that she and Jasso drank alcohol and smoked marihuana together and\r\nthat Jasso would provide her with the alcohol and marihuana.\u00a0 S.K. and Jasso\r\ndated for approximately two months and had vaginal and/or oral sex between two\r\nand four times a day.\u00a0 S.K. noted that Jasso penetrated her sexual organ with\r\nhis fingers and penis when she was thirteen years old.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Carol\r\nAnne McLaughlin, a forensic nurse with the Driscoll Children\u2019s Hospital,\r\nexamined A.L. after A.L. made her outcry.\u00a0 McLaughlin testified that A.L. told\r\nher the following during their interview:\r\n\r\nThe\r\nhistory that I received from [A.L.] stated whenever we were at Capeheart\r\nthat was when it happened.\u00a0 Those are her words.\u00a0 Then she stated\u2014and these are\r\nher words, not mine\u2014my mom was asleep.\u00a0 I was getting up and he, Joe, made\r\nme pancakes.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 .\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHe took\r\nme to the garage and then he pulled my pants down.\u00a0 I told him no.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t\r\nlisten.\u00a0 He started playing with\u2014he started rubbing me on my middle,\r\nand she indicated her female sexual organ by pointing.\u00a0 He sticked [sic] his\r\nfingers inside me.\u00a0 That\u2019s when I yelled ow [sic].\u00a0 He told me to shut up or he\r\nwould hit me.\u00a0 He did this a lot of times.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n(Emphasis\r\nin original).\u00a0 McLaughlin noted that A.L. appeared to be truthful and acted\r\n\u201cvery age appropriate.\u201d\u00a0 A.L. \u201clooked [McLaughlin] in the eye.\u00a0 She [A.L.]\r\ndidn\u2019t look at the floor.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t look past [McLaughlin], and she talked\r\nwell with [McLaughlin].\u201d\u00a0 McLaughlin then conducted an examination of A.L.\u2019s\r\nbody and found no trauma.\u00a0 However, McLaughlin noted that the area surrounding\r\nthe female sexual organ is membrane that heals very quickly and that the\r\nincident had occurred about four years prior to her meeting with A.L.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Steve\r\nLiman, an investigator with the Bee County Sheriff\u2019s Office, testified that he\r\nreceived Campos\u2019s letters that were forwarded along by the District Attorney\u2019s\r\nOffice.\u00a0 After receiving the letters, Liman visited Campos and took a statement\r\nfrom him.\u00a0 Liman also spoke to D.S. about A.L.\u2019s outcry.\u00a0 Liman acknowledged\r\nthat there were two individuals involved in this case that are named \u201cJoe\r\nRichard.\u201d \u00a0Liman determined that Jasso is the \u201cJoe Richard\u201d who dated S.S. and\r\nlived at the Capeheart house when the alleged incidents took place and that\r\nEstrada is S.S.\u2019s current boyfriend.\u00a0 Estrada was ruled out as the \u201cJoe\r\nRichard\u201d who allegedly molested A.L. because during 2004, when the alleged\r\nincidents took place, Estrada was incarcerated.\u00a0 Because of Estrada\u2019s\r\nincarceration at the time of the alleged incidents, Liman concluded that Jasso\r\nwas the perpetrator of these crimes.\u00a0 Liman also interviewed S.S. and S.K.,\r\nboth of whom admitted to having sexual intercourse with Jasso.\u00a0 These\r\nadmissions led to additional charges filed against Jasso.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Liman\r\nlater recounted the arrest of Jasso for the alleged crimes.\u00a0 Liman discovered\r\nthat Jasso fled Texas shortly after finding out that he had been indicted.\u00a0\r\nJasso was eventually apprehended in Nebraska for stealing liquor from a grocery\r\nstore, and he was extradited to Texas.\u00a0 During an interview with Liman, Jasso\r\nadmitted to having sexual intercourse with S.S. but denied molesting A.L.\u00a0\r\nLiman also testified that he was present during A.L.\u2019s interview with\r\nMcLaughlin.\u00a0 He recalled that A.L. \u201cwas worried or seemed worried that she was\r\ngoing to have to confront Mr. Jasso. . . .\u00a0 She didn\u2019t want to see him. . . .\u00a0\r\nBecause I got the impression she is afraid of him from the threats he made.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\nA.L., nine years old at the time of trial, testified that\r\nshe lived in a house located in the Capeheart subdivision with several people,\r\nincluding D.S., S.S., and, for a time, Jasso.\u00a0 A.L. noted that she would wake\r\nup early in the morning, while D.S. was still asleep.\u00a0 A.L. recalled that at\r\nthe time of the incidents, she usually went into the living room to watch\r\ncartoons when she awoke.\u00a0 A.L. noted that Jasso would awake at about the same\r\ntime as she and would go to the restroom.\u00a0 He would then call for her to follow\r\nhim, and he would make her pancakes for breakfast.\u00a0 A.L. remembered that after\r\nbreakfast, Jasso would take her into the garage and \u201cpull up [her] nightgown .\r\n. . take down [her] underwears [sic]\u201d and then \u201clay [her] down\u201d on the sofa in\r\nthe garage.\u00a0 Jasso would then \u201cstart rubbing\u201d A.L. with his fingers on the\r\noutside of A.L.\u2019s sexual organ.\u00a0 A.L. then testified that Jasso stuck his\r\nfinger inside her sexual organ one time, which caused her to scream.\u00a0 When A.L.\r\nscreamed, Jasso put his hand over A.L.\u2019s mouth and told her to shut up.\u00a0 A.L.\r\nlater noted that Jasso took her into the garage and molested her \u201cmore than\r\nonce\u201d and that he stuck his finger inside her \u201c[p]robably two or three\r\n[times].\u201d\u00a0 A.L. testified that Jasso threatened her and told her that \u201che would\r\nkill my family and my sister and me\u201d if she told anyone about what was\r\nhappening.\u00a0 A.L. explained that she did not tell anyone about the incident for\r\na long time because she was scared that Jasso would \u201cwatch\u201d her and kill her\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nA.L. finally told her family about the incidents when\r\nS.S. mentioned that she had seen Jasso in jail.\u00a0 When she first told her story,\r\nA.L. identified the perpetrator as \u201cJoe,\u201d not \u201cJoe Richard\u201d or \u201cJoe Jasso.\u201d\u00a0 On\r\ncross-examination, A.L. admitted that she learned the word, \u201cJasso,\u201d from S.S.\r\nand D.S. and that she did not know Jasso\u2019s full name.\u00a0 However, in open court,\r\nA.L. identified Jasso as the man who molested her.\u00a0 A.L. testified that when\r\nshe told Campos that she was molested by S.S.\u2019s boyfriend, she did not mean Estrada.\u00a0\r\nA.L. further testified that Estrada had not made her breakfast or pancakes, nor\r\nhad he touched her inappropriately.\u00a0 A.L. stated that Estrada never lived with\r\nthe family in the Capeheart subdivision; that Jasso did, for a time, live with\r\nthe family in the Capeheart subdivision; and that the molestation occurred when\r\nthe family lived in the Capeheart subdivision.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nJasso testified in his own defense.\u00a0 Jasso noted that he\r\nwas previously employed as a breakfast \u201cchef\u201d at the \u201cMy Country Kitchen\r\nRestaurant.\u201d\u00a0 Jasso denied ever living at the house in the Capeheart\r\nsubdivision and, instead, noted that he \u201cvisited every once in a while.\u201d\u00a0 Jasso\r\nadmitted to having sexual intercourse with S.S. three or four times; however,\r\nhe denied touching A.L. inappropriately or having sexual intercourse with S.K.\u00a0\r\nJasso acknowledged that he had been arrested several times before and that he\r\n\u201cabsconded\u201d shortly after being indicted because he had a \u201cdirty UA\u201d that would\r\nhave resulted in a probation violation.\u00a0 Jasso testified that he only made A.L.\r\npancakes once and that after making the pancakes, he had to leave quickly\r\nbecause he was running late for work. \r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, Jasso admitted that he was\r\ntwenty-two years old when the alleged incidents transpired, even though he told\r\npolice that he was nineteen.\u00a0 Jasso did not believe that there was anything\r\nwrong with having sex with S.S. because he was allegedly told by D.S. that S.S.\r\nwas seventeen years old.\u00a0 Also on cross-examination, Jasso acknowledged several\r\nother inconsistencies between his trial testimony and statements made to\r\npolice, including the description of incidents where Jasso stole money and\r\nproperty from the families of the girls he was dating and how often he made\r\npancakes for S.S.\u2019s family.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter hearing all of the above-mentioned evidence, the\r\njury convicted Jasso of six counts of aggravated sexual assault, and Jasso\r\npleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault.\u00a0 Jasso received ninety-nine-year\r\nsentences for each of the aggravated sexual assault counts and a twenty-year\r\nsentence for the sexual assault count.\u00a0 The trial court ordered some of the\r\ncounts to run concurrently, while other counts were ordered to run\r\nconsecutively.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nOn August 25, 2009, Jasso filed a pro se motion for new\r\ntrial arguing that he did not receive a fair trial and that his trial counsel\r\nwas ineffective.\u00a0 Because the trial court did not rule on Jasso\u2019s pro se motion\r\nfor new trial, it is deemed overruled by operation of law.\u00a0 See Tex. R. App. P. 21.8(a), (c); see\r\nalso State v. Gutierrez, 143 S.W.3d 829, 831 (Tex.

State,\r\n919 S.W.2d 422, 424 (Tex. Crim.

Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a022.011(e).\u00a0\r\nIn the present case, no such defenses were asserted.\u00a0 Thus, Jasso\u2019s assertion\r\nthat his sexual relationships with A.L., S.K., or S.S. were consensual is\r\nunfounded.\u00a0 See id.; see also May, 919 S.W.2d at 424.\r\n\r\nAs previously discussed, the evidence at trial was\r\nsufficient to prove that, on more than one occasion, Jasso penetrated A.L.\u2019s\r\nsexual organ with his fingers.\u00a0 Further, Jasso does not argue that the evidence\r\nis insufficient to support his four convictions for the aggravated sexual\r\nassault of S.K., and Jasso pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting S.S.\u00a0 Neither\r\naggravated sexual assault nor sexual assault requires physical abuse,\r\ndomination, or intimidation.\u00a0 See Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 22.011(a)(2),\r\n22.021(a)(2)(B).\u00a0 Moreover, we judge the gravity of the offense\r\nin light of the harm caused or threatened to society and the offender\u2019s\r\nculpability.\u00a0 Moore v.
