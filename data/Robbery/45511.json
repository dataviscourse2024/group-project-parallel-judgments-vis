Carey\u2019s predicate felony is a 1995 Missouri conviction for Second Degree Burglary. Carey argues that because Missouri law permits him to carry a firearm, his civil rights have been substantially restored under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20), and he does not fall within the terms of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm the district court.1\nSection 921(a)(20) sets forth a two-step inquiry. First, we determine whether the defendant\u2019s civil rights were substantially restored under the law of the jurisdiction of conviction. See Beecham v. United States, 511 U.S. 368, 371, 114 S.Ct. 1669, 128 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); United States v. *823Gomez, 911 F.2d 219, 220 (9th Cir.1990). If we conclude that the civil rights of the defendant were substantially restored, we then conduct a second inquiry into whether state law expressly prohibits the defendant from possessing firearms, notwithstanding the substantial restoration of his or her civil rights. United States v. Collins, 61 F.3d 1379, 1382 (9th Cir.1995).\nMissouri law prohibits Carey from sitting on a jury, Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 561.026(3), serving as a sheriff, Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 57.010(1), and working as a highway patrol officer, Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 43.060(1). We considered these same civil rights disabilities in United States v. Meeks, a case also involving Missouri law and a defendant whose predicate conviction was for Second Degree Burglary. 987 F.2d 575 (9th Cir. 1993). In Meeks, we held that because Missouri law prohibits a felon from serving on a jury, holding office as a sheriff and working as a highway patrol officer, the state has not substantially restored civil rights, despite permitting felons to vote and hold public office after the termination of their sentences. Id. at 578 (citing Presley v. United States, 851 F.2d 1052, 1053 (8th Cir.1988)).\nCarey contends that the Meeks substantial restoration analysis no longer applies because, since that case was decided, Missouri has changed its laws so that persons convicted of Second Degree Burglary are no longer prohibited from possessing firearms. We reject this argument. It is questionable whether state-law restoration of the right to bear firearms is relevant in determining whether the civil rights of a felon have been substantially restored. See Meeks, 987 F.2d at 578 (\u2018We first ascertain whether a felon\u2019s civil rights are substantially restored under state law; if they are, only then do we determine whether state law expressly restricts his light to possess firearms.\u201d); United States v. Horodner, 91 F.3d 1317, 1318-19 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam). We need not reach this question here, however, because, even if the right to bear firearms were among the civil rights we consider, \u201cthe restoration of this single right does not prevent prosecution under \u00a7 922(g)(1).\u201d United States v. Andaverde, 64 F.3d 1305, 1309 (9th Cir.1995). The Meeks analysis controls this appeal and, accordingly, Missouri law has not substantially restored Carey\u2019s civil rights.\nCarey finally argues that the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 927 implies that Congress intended that state law would govern whether a felon may possess a firearm under federal law. We disagree. State laws that allow felons to possess firearms are not dispositive in determining whether a felon has violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922. Caron v. United States, 524 U.S. 308, 315, 118 S.Ct. 2007, 141 L.Ed.2d 303 (1998); Andaverde, 64 F.3d at 1310 (\u201cSection 922(g)(1) rests on state law governing convictions, not on state law regulating felons\u2019 possession of firearms.\u201d).\nAFFIRMED.\n\n This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n\n\n. We review de novo whether a state has substantially restored the civil rights of a convicted felon, thereby precluding use of the underlying conviction as a predicate offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). United States v. Oman, 91 F.3d 1320, 1321 (9th Cir.1996).\n\n",
