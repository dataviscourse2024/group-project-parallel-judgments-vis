ARNOLD,\n                                               JUDGE\n\nSTATE OF ARKANSAS\n                                APPELLEE       APPEAL DISMISSED\n\n\n\n                        ROBERT J. GLADWIN, Chief Judge\n\n      Appellant Earl Mangum, III\u2019s probationary sentence, which was the result of an\n\nOctober 11, 2010 guilty plea to charges of commercial burglary and first-degree criminal\n\nmischief, was revoked by the Saline County Circuit Court. The State filed a petition to\n\nrevoke Mangum\u2019s probation on February 2, 2012. On April 9, 2012, Mangum changed his\n\nplea to guilty in the probation-revocation petition. After conducting a plea hearing, the\n\ncircuit court accepted Mangum\u2019s plea of guilty to the probation-revocation petition, and\n\nafter a subsequent sentencing hearing on May 29, 2013, sentenced him to three years in the\n\nRegional Correctional Facility. The circuit court entered a sentencing order on June 13,\n\n2013, and an amended sentencing order on June 19, 2013. Mangum timely filed a notice\n\nof appeal on July 11, 2013.\n\f                                 Cite as 2014 Ark. App. 372\n\n       Appellant\u2019s counsel has now filed a motion to withdraw and a brief pursuant to Anders\n\nv. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), and Arkansas Supreme Court Rule 4-3(k) (2013). The\n\nclerk of this court provided Mangum with a copy of his counsel\u2019s brief and notified him of\n\nhis right to file a pro se statement of points for reversal within thirty days. Mangum did not\n\nfile pro se points; as a consequence, the attorney general did not file a brief in response.\n\n       Mangum is not permitted to bring an appeal. Except as provided by Arkansas Rule\n\nof Criminal Procedure 24.3(b) (2013), there shall be no appeal from a plea of guilty or nolo\n\ncontendere. Ark. R. App. P.\u2013Crim. 1(a) (2013). Rule 24.3(b) allows a defendant to enter\n\na conditional guilty plea under certain specified circumstances, but Mangum did not enter\n\na conditional plea under Rule 24.3(b).\n\n       Our supreme court has recognized two other exceptions to Rule 1(a). An appeal may\n\nbe taken after a guilty plea when the issue on appeal is one of evidentiary errors that arose\n\nafter the plea but during the sentencing phase of the trial, regardless of whether a jury was\n\nimpaneled or the trial judge sat as the trier of fact during that phase. Johnson v. State, 2010\n\nArk. 63. An appeal may also be taken from the denial of a postjudgment motion to amend\n\nan incorrect or illegal sentence following a guilty plea. Reeves v. State, 339 Ark. 304, 5\n\nS.W.3d 41 (1999). Neither of those exceptions applies here\u2014our review of the entire record\n\nindicates that there is no challenge to the evidence presented during the sentencing portion\n\nof Mangum\u2019s probation-revocation plea hearing, and there is no challenge to the validity of\n\nthe sentence itself. Mangum\u2019s appeal is therefore dismissed. See Hubbard v. State, 2012 Ark.\n\nApp. 443.\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                          Cite as 2014 Ark.

Parker Jones III, for appellant.\n\nNo response.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f",
