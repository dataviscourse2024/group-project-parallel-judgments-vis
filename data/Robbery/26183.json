Holmes, III, Chief Judge, United States District Court for\nthe Western District of Arkansas, sitting by designation.\n\fCOLLOTON, Circuit Judge.\n\n       WireCo WorldGroup, Inc. brought a five-count action against its workers\u2019\ncompensation insurance carriers, Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company and The\nFirst Liberty Insurance Corporation (collectively, \u201cLiberty\u201d). The lawsuit sought\ndamages for excess premiums that WireCo allegedly paid on three of Liberty\u2019s\ninsurance policies.\n\n       The district court,2 at the pleading stage, dismissed a claim for vexatious\nrefusal to pay under Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 375.420. The district court then granted\nsummary judgment for Liberty on WireCo\u2019s remaining breach of contract claims.\nWireCo appeals the dismissal of all counts. Although our reasoning differs from that\nof the district court in some respects, we ultimately affirm the judgment.\n\n                                         I.\n\n      WireCo is a wire and cable company that operates in many States, including\nTexas and Missouri. In 2009, WireCo purchased a workers\u2019 compensation insurance\npolicy from Liberty. The 2009 policy was in effect from June 30, 2009, to June 30,\n2010. WireCo purchased renewal policies from Liberty in 2010, 2011, and 2012,\nrespectively. Each policy contained an \u201cInformation Page,\u201d endorsements, and terms\nand conditions.\n\n      The policies specified that Liberty would calculate the premium for each policy\ntwice. Before the policy went into effect, Liberty would calculate an estimated\npremium, and WireCo agreed to pay this amount before the policy expired. After the\npolicy expired, Liberty would calculate an actual premium in light of developments\n\n\n      2\n      The Honorable Roseann A. Ketchmark, United States District Judge for the\nWestern District of Missouri.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fduring the term. If the actual premium differed from the estimate, then the policy\nprovided that WireCo would make an additional payment or receive a refund, as the\ncase may be.\n\n       Each policy had two sections that explained how premiums would be\ncalculated. Both sections identified \u201crating plans\u201d as an element in the calculation.\nItem 4 of each policy\u2019s Information Page read: \u201cPremium: The premium for this\npolicy will be determined by our Manuals of Rules, Classifications, Rates and Rating\nPlans.\u201d (Emphasis added). Part Five of each policy\u2019s \u201cGeneral Section\u201d read: \u201cAll\npremium for this policy will be determined by our manuals of rules, rates, rating\nplans and classifications.\u201d (Emphasis added). According to WireCo, the references\nto \u201crating plans\u201d meant the \u201cschedule rating plans\u201d that Liberty had filed with each\nState. One point of dispute is whether two particular schedule rating plans from\nMissouri and Texas were incorporated by reference into the renewal policies.\n\n      Schedule rating is a method of adjusting the premium on workers\u2019\ncompensation insurance to account for risk characteristics that affect the probability\nor severity of future losses. When an insurance policy covers the insured company\u2019s\noperations in multiple States, the carrier must calculate a schedule rating factor for\neach State in accordance with the schedule rating plan it filed with the State. A\nschedule rating factor can take the form of a credit, which lowers the premium on the\npolicy, or a debit, which increases the premium on the policy.\n\n       In its complaint, WireCo alleged that Liberty breached the 2010, 2011, and\n2012 renewal policies because it modified the Missouri and Texas schedule rating\nfactors without complying with the procedures laid out in the Missouri and Texas\nschedule rating plans. In relevant part, the Missouri Schedule Rating Plan stated:\n\n      2. No Schedule debit or credit can take effect until the evidence\n      supporting the modification is in our files.\n\n                                         -3-\n\f      ....\n\n      5. The customer will be informed in writing within ninety (90) days of\n      the policy inception or renewal date, of the basis for any schedule debit\n      or credit applied. If the policy is subject to any changes in its schedule\n      debits or credits upon renewal, we will notify the customer.\n\nThe Texas Schedule Rating Plan included the following provisions:\n\n      4. At the time that the schedule rating factor is applied, the carrier must\n      have documentation on file detailing the basis for the credit or debit.\n\n      5. The effective date of the schedule rating factor must be on or after the\n      date of the carrier\u2019s receipt of the documentation supporting the basis\n      for the schedule rating factor.\n\n      In the initial 2009 policy, Liberty calculated WireCo\u2019s premium using a\nMissouri schedule rating credit of 4.2%, but then adjusted the rating each year as\nfollows: 2010 (1.3% credit), 2011 (15% debit), 2012 (25% debit). In advance of\neach renewal, Liberty provided WireCo with a policy proposal that included the\nmodified Missouri schedule rating factors. WireCo alleged in Counts I, II, and III,\nhowever, that Liberty failed to give WireCo notice of these modifications in the\nmanner required by the Missouri Schedule Rating Plan, and thereby breached the\n2010, 2011, and 2012 renewal policies, respectively. WireCo contends that it was\ndamaged by the increased premiums it paid as a \u201cdirect and proximate result\u201d of\nLiberty\u2019s breaches of contract.\n\n       WireCo also objects to Liberty\u2019s modification of the Texas schedule rating\nfactor in the 2012 renewal policy. In the 2011 renewal policy, Liberty calculated\nWireCo\u2019s premium without applying a Texas schedule rating factor, but then applied\na 40% debit in 2012. Liberty included this modified schedule rating factor in the\n2012 renewal policy proposal that it provided to WireCo. But WireCo alleged in\n\n                                         -4-\n\fCount IV that Liberty did not have sufficient documentation in its file to support the\nschedule rating modification as required by the Texas Schedule Rating Plan, and thus\nbreached the 2012 renewal policy by modifying the rating factor. WireCo contends\nthat it was damaged by the increased premiums that resulted from this breach.\n\n       As an alternative theory, WireCo alleged in Count V that \u201c[t]he excess\npremiums paid by WireCo that Liberty Mutual has refused to refund is \u2018loss\u2019 as\ncontemplated by Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 375.420.\u201d This statute provides for the recovery\nof a \u201closs under a policy\u201d that the insurer refuses to pay \u201cwithout reasonable cause or\nexcuse.\u201d Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 375.420. In total, WireCo contends that Liberty\novercharged on premiums by $545,561.00.\n\n       The district court dismissed WireCo\u2019s statutory claim, concluding that WireCo\nfailed to state a claim on which relief can be granted. The court then granted\nsummary judgment for Liberty on WireCo\u2019s breach of contract claims. The court\nreasoned that the Missouri and Texas schedule rating plans were not incorporated into\nthe renewal policies, so that Liberty\u2019s alleged violations of the rating plans\u2019 notice\nand documentation requirements did not constitute breach of contract.\n\n\n\n\n                                          II.\n\n      We review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss de novo. In re\nCanadian Imp. Antitrust Litig., 470 F.3d 785, 788 (8th Cir. 2006). Dismissal is\nproper where the plaintiff\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim on which relief can be\ngranted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\n      We first address WireCo\u2019s claim that Liberty\u2019s refusal to refund premium\noverpayments constituted a \u201closs\u201d that is recoverable under Missouri\u2019s vexatious\n\n                                         -5-\n\frefusal to pay statute, Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 375.420. The district court dismissed this\nclaim, reasoning that \u201c[t]he plain language and established purpose of the statute\nindicate that it applies to claims filed under a policy that relate to a covered loss,\u201d and\nthat \u201c[a] breach of contract claim of overcharging or of failure to refund premium\u201d\nis not a loss contemplated by the statute. We agree with this interpretation of the\nstatute.\n\n       Missouri law permits an insured to recover damages and attorney\u2019s fees when\nan insurance company refuses to pay for a \u201closs under a policy\u201d if the company \u201chas\nrefused to pay such loss without reasonable cause or excuse.\u201d Mo. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7 375.420.3 WireCo contends that \u201cany loss\u201d includes not only an insurer\u2019s\nunreasonable failure to pay claims under the insurance policy, but also an insurer\u2019s\nunreasonable refusal to refund excess premiums. WireCo argues that the statute\u2019s use\nof the term \u201closs\u201d rather than \u201cclaim\u201d suggests a broader meaning. We agree with the\ndistrict court, however, that a \u201closs\u201d under \u00a7 375.420 does not include excess\npremium payments.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n          The statute provides in full:\n\n       In any action against any insurance company to recover the amount of\n       any loss under a policy of automobile, fire, cyclone, lightning, life,\n       health, accident, employers\u2019 liability, burglary, theft, embezzlement,\n       fidelity, indemnity, marine or other insurance except automobile liability\n       insurance, if it appears from the evidence that such company has refused\n       to pay such loss without reasonable cause or excuse, the court or jury\n       may, in addition to the amount thereof and interest, allow the plaintiff\n       damages not to exceed twenty percent of the first fifteen hundred dollars\n       of the loss, and ten percent of the amount of the loss in excess of fifteen\n       hundred dollars and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee; and the court shall enter\n       judgment for the aggregate sum found in the verdict.\n\n                                           -6-\n\f       When \u201c[i]nterpreting state statutes, this court applies that state\u2019s rules of\nstatutory construction.\u201d Behlmann v. Century Sur. Co., 794 F.3d 960, 963 (8th Cir.\n2015). Missouri\u2019s rules provide that where, as here, \u201cstatutory language is not\ndefined expressly, it is given its plain and ordinary meaning, as typically found in the\ndictionary.\u201d Derousse v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 298 S.W.3d 891, 895 (Mo.\n2009). Where a dictionary provides multiple definitions, Missouri courts look to the\ncontext in which the term appears to ascertain which definition applies. See, e.g.,\nEstate of Williams v. Williams, 12 S.W.3d 302, 306 (Mo. 2000); In re A.S.O., 75\nS.W.3d 905, 910 (Mo. Ct. App. 2002); L.C. Dev. Co., Inc. v. Lincoln County, 26\nS.W.3d 336, 340 (Mo. Ct. App. 2000). \u201cMost common English words have a number\nof dictionary definitions,\u201d but \u201c[o]ne should assume the contextually appropriate\nordinary meaning unless there is reason to think otherwise.\u201d Antonin Scalia & Bryan\nA. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 70 (2012).\n\n       Section 375.420 is an insurance provision. When \u201closs\u201d is defined in the\ninsurance context, the term ordinarily means \u201cthe amount of an insured\u2019s financial\ndetriment due to the occurrence of a stipulated contingent event (as death, injury,\ndestruction, or damage) in such a manner as to charge the insurer with a liability\nunder the terms of the policy.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1338\n(2002); see also American Heritage Dictionary 1037 (5th ed. 2016) (defining \u201closs\u201d\nas \u201c[t]he amount of a claim on an insurer by an insured\u201d); Random House Webster\u2019s\nUnabridged Dictionary 1137 (2d ed. 1997) (defining \u201closs\u201d as the \u201coccurrence of an\nevent, as death or damage of property, for which the insurer makes indemnity under\nthe terms of a policy\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \u201closs\u201d as\n\u201c[t]he amount of financial detriment caused by an insured person\u2019s death or an\ninsured property\u2019s damage, for which the insurer becomes liable\u201d). When considered\nin proper context, the statutory term \u201closs\u201d includes claims under an insurance policy,\nbut does not include financial detriment suffered as a result of excess premium\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fpayments. We therefore affirm the dismissal of WireCo\u2019s claim under Mo. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7 375.420 for alleged vexatious refusal to pay.4\n\n                                          III.\n\n       The parties dispute which of WireCo\u2019s breach of contract theories were\nproperly before the district court at summary judgment. In its summary judgment\npapers, WireCo presented two additional grounds for breach of contract that it had\nnot pleaded in its complaint: (1) that Liberty breached the renewal policies by failing\nto obtain documentation as required by Missouri\u2019s schedule rating plan, and (2) that\nLiberty breached the renewal policies by improperly relying on WireCo\u2019s loss\nexperience in its calculation of the schedule rating factors. The district court declined\nto consider these additional theories, reasoning that \u201c[t]he liberal pleading standard\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) does not afford a plaintiff with an\nopportunity to raise new claims at the summary judgment stage.\u201d WireCo disputes\nthe district court\u2019s ruling, arguing that it did not raise new claims but rather new\ngrounds for breach of contract, and that Rule 8(a) does not require a plaintiff to plead\neach separate ground for breach of contract in its complaint.\n\n       We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it\ndetermined that only those theories of breach that WireCo pleaded in its complaint\nwere before the court. Although the pleading requirements under Rule 8(a) are\nrelatively permissive, the essential function of notice pleading is to \u201cgive the\ndefendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d\nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (alteration in original)\n\n      4\n       Because the meaning of \u201closs\u201d is clear in context, we need not consider\nLiberty\u2019s contention that \u00a7 375.420 should be construed \u201cstrictly\u201d against the plaintiff\nbecause the statute is penal in nature. See Missouri ex rel. Pemiscot County v. W. Sur.\nCo., 51 F.3d 170, 174 (8th Cir. 1995); Morris v. J.C. Penney Life Ins. Co., 895\nS.W.2d 73, 78 (Mo. Ct. App. 1995).\n\n                                          -8-\n\f(emphasis added) (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)); see N. States\nPower Co. v. Fed. Transit Admin., 358 F.3d 1050, 1056-57 (8th Cir. 2004); cf.\nSatcher v. Univ. of Ark. at Pine Bluff Bd. of Trustees, 558 F.3d 731, 735 (8th Cir.\n2009).\n\n        WireCo\u2019s complaint was specific as to the nature, bases, and grounds of\nLiberty\u2019s alleged breaches of contract. Counts I, II, and III of WireCo\u2019s complaint\nalleged that Liberty breached the 2010, 2011, and 2012 renewal policies, respectively,\nby failing to comply with the notice requirements of the Missouri Schedule Rating\nPlan. Count IV alleged that Liberty breached the 2012 renewal policy by failing to\nobtain proper documentation as required by the Texas Schedule Rating Plan. Liberty\nhad notice of these alleged grounds for the breach of contract claims and was entitled\nto tailor its defense accordingly; it was not required to intuit additional theories of\nliability that were not apparent from WireCo\u2019s complaint. WireCo contends that\nLiberty learned of its new grounds for breach over the course of discovery, but the\nmaterials to which WireCo refers are insufficient to demonstrate new grounds for\nrelief that were not alleged in the complaint.5\n\n       We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when\nit declined to consider WireCo\u2019s unpleaded grounds for breach on the eve of\n\n\n\n      5\n       WireCo cites interrogatories asking Liberty to specify documents in its files\non which the insurer based the rating factors for Missouri in the 2010 and 2011\nrenewals. But merely asking about these documents did not notify Liberty that\nWireCo intended to pursue a new ground asserting that Liberty breached the renewal\npolicies by failing to have adequate documentation in its file with respect to Missouri\noperations. WireCo also cites the deposition testimony of one of its executives, but\nthe record citation points to a cover page and fails to specify any testimony. Even if\nwe were required to search through the excerpts that follow the cover page, none of\nthem properly placed Liberty on notice that WireCo was asserting a breach on the\nground that the insurer improperly relied on WireCo\u2019s loss experience.\n\n                                         -9-\n\fsummary judgment. Like the district court, we limit our review to those grounds and\ntheories that WireCo properly pleaded in its complaint.\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment for WireCo because it concluded\nthat the Missouri and Texas schedule rating plans were not incorporated into the\nrenewal policies. As such, the court concluded that Liberty\u2019s alleged incompliance\nwith the notice and documentation requirements did not constitute breach of contract.\nWe review this ruling de novo, viewing the record in the light most favorable to\nWireCo. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986).\n\n        We have doubt about the district court\u2019s conclusion on incorporation of the\npolicies. Liberty filed schedule rating plans with both Missouri and Texas that set\nforth its procedure for schedule rating in each State. The renewal policies in question\ndictate that premiums be determined in accordance with \u201crating plans.\u201d And in line\nwith this dictate, each renewal policy contains pages of estimated premium\ncalculations in which each State\u2019s \u201cSchedule Rating\u201d is one input that goes into the\nestimated premium. The renewal policies do not merely mention the rating plans;\nthey memorialize an agreement between the parties that the premium for each policy\nwill be determined in part by these rating plans. WireCo thus argues with some force\nthat the schedule rating plans are incorporated into the policies, and that Liberty was\nrequired to comply with the terms of the plans before changing the rating factors.\n\n       Even so, we may affirm on any ground supported by the record, and Liberty\nargues alternatively that WireCo failed to present evidence that it suffered damages\nfrom the alleged breaches of contract. In Missouri, \u201c[a] breach of contract action\nincludes the following essential elements: (1) the existence and terms of a contract;\n(2) that plaintiff performed or tendered performance pursuant to the contract; (3)\nbreach of the contract by the defendant; and (4) damages suffered by the plaintiff.\u201d\nKeveney v. Mo. Military Acad., 304 S.W.3d 98, 104 (Mo. 2010). Thus, even\nassuming the rating plans were incorporated into the policies, and that Liberty\n\n                                         -10-\n\fbreached the contracts, WireCo must present evidence that Liberty\u2019s alleged breaches\ncaused WireCo to suffer damages.\n\n      The alleged breaches are that Liberty failed to meet the procedural\nrequirements of the Missouri and Texas schedule rating plans. Specifically, WireCo\nclaimed that Liberty did not give proper notice before modifying the Missouri\nschedule rating factor, and that Liberty did not have proper documentation in its files\nwhen it modified the Texas schedule rating factor.\n\n       \u201cThe goal in awarding damages is to put the non-breaching party in the same\nposition as if the contract would have been performed.\u201d Fire Sprinklers, Inc. v. Icon\nContracting, Inc., 279 S.W.3d 230, 235 (Mo. Ct. App. 2009) (quoting Guidry v.\nCharter Commc\u2019ns, Inc., 269 S.W.3d 520, 532 (Mo. Ct. App. 2008)). Therefore, the\nproper measure of damages in this scenario is the difference between the premiums\nthat WireCo actually paid under the renewal policies and the premiums that WireCo\nwould have paid if Liberty had given proper notice of the modification and\nmaintained proper documentation in its files. That relief would place WireCo in the\nsame position that it would have enjoyed if Liberty had performed on the contract.\n\n       WireCo, however, did not present evidence that proper notice from Liberty of\nschedule rating modifications or proper documentation in Liberty\u2019s files would have\nresulted in lower insurance premiums for WireCo\u2019s insurance coverage. WireCo\nconcedes that it is required by law to purchase workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Yet\nWireCo submitted no evidence that it could have obtained a less expensive policy\nfrom Liberty or any other insurer in 2010, 2011, or 2012. WireCo\u2019s chief accounting\nofficer testified that WireCo does not have any proposals or bids from other insurers\nfor the 2010, 2011, or 2012 calendar years, and he does not know whether WireCo\nreceived any such bids. This officer further testified that he does not know whether\nWireCo had an opportunity to purchase workers\u2019 compensation for less than what\nLiberty was offering for the years in question. Without evidence that WireCo could\n\n                                         -11-\n\fhave obtained workers\u2019 compensation insurance for less than what it actually paid to\nLiberty, WireCo has not created a genuine dispute about whether it suffered damages.\n\n       WireCo argues that its damages are the difference between (1) the premiums\nthat WireCo actually paid and (2) the premiums that WireCo would have paid on the\n2010, 2011, and 2012 renewal policies if the premiums had been calculated using the\nschedule rating factors from prior years. The company argues that its damages can\nbe calculated by substituting the 4.2% Missouri schedule rating credit from 2009 into\nthe 2010, 2011, and 2012 renewal policies, and the 0.0% Texas schedule rating factor\nfrom 2011 into the 2012 renewal policy. Under this calculation, WireCo claims it is\nentitled to $545,561.00 in damages.\n\n      WireCo\u2019s damages theory is flawed, because there is no evidence that WireCo\nwould have been able to obtain premiums in the disputed years based on the Missouri\n2009 schedule rating factor and the Texas 2011 schedule rating factor. Even\nassuming WireCo is correct that Liberty failed to provide adequate notice or to\nmaintain adequate documentation, these failures do not establish that Liberty was\nrequired to offer renewal policies based on outdated rating factors. Liberty\u2019s\nunderwriting manager averred that the insurer would not have offered the 2011 and\n2012 policies based on the rating factors from previous years, and WireCo mustered\nno evidence to the contrary.\n\n       Proof of damages is an essential element of WireCo\u2019s breach of contract\nclaims. Because WireCo failed to present evidence that it would have paid lower\npremiums if Liberty had complied with the notice and documentation requirements\nof the Missouri and Texas schedule rating plans, we conclude that Liberty was\nentitled to summary judgment on WireCo\u2019s breach of contract claims.\n\n                                  *      *       *\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n               ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                            -13-\n\f",
