For the reasons that follow, we\n\nwill summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.\n\n                                             I.\n\n       Because we write primarily for the parties, who are familiar with the background\n\nof this case, we discuss that background only briefly. In 2016, Easterling filed a pro se\n\ncivil rights complaint in the District Court against the City of Newark, New Jersey, the\n\nNewark Police Department (\u201cthe NPD\u201d), four Newark police officers, and two detectives\n\nfrom the Essex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The complaint raised numerous claims, all\n\nof which concerned alleged events related to Easterling\u2019s armed robbery of a dollar store\n\nin Newark in 2014. 1 The District Court dismissed all but two of Easterling\u2019s claims at\n\nthe screening stage pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). His two surviving claims,\n\nwhich alleged excessive force and the delay of medical care, related to the gunshot\n\nwound that he sustained when the police arrived at the scene of the robbery. These two\n\nclaims proceeded against the following three defendants, all of whom worked for the\n\nNPD: Officer Barry Baker, Officer Joao Oliveira, and Captain Richard Perez (hereinafter\n\ncollectively referred to as \u201cthe Newark Officers\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n1\n In 2017, the New Jersey Superior Court convicted Easterling of several offenses in\nconnection with that robbery. He is serving a lengthy prison sentence for those offenses.\n\n                                             2\n\f       After the close of discovery, the Newark Officers moved for summary judgment.\n\nEasterling opposed that motion, but that opposition \u201cconsist[ed] entirely of unsworn,\n\nunsupported factual allegations.\u201d (Dist. Ct. Op. entered Jan. 24, 2019, at 5 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).) On January 24, 2019, the District Court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of the Newark Officers, concluding that Easterling\u2019s excessive-force\n\nand delay-of-medical-care claims lacked merit. This timely appeal followed.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. 2 We exercise\n\nplenary review over the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. See Lomando v.\n\nUnited States, 667 F.3d 363, 371 (3d Cir. 2011). Summary judgment is appropriate when\n\nthe movants \u201cshow[] that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the\n\nmovant[s] [are] entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). We may\n\nsummarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment if this appeal does not present a\n\nsubstantial question. See 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.\n\n\n\n\n2\n  The District Court\u2019s summary-judgment order did not specifically address the cross-\nclaims set forth in the Newark Officers\u2019 answer to Easterling\u2019s complaint, which initially\nput our appellate jurisdiction in question. See Owens v. Aetna Life & Cas. Co., 654 F.2d\n218, 220 n.2 (3d Cir. 1981) (indicating that a district court order that did not resolve an\noutstanding cross-claim was not final and appealable). However, the Newark Officers\nhave since elected to withdraw those claims with prejudice. Because those claims are no\nlonger pending, and no other claims remain, the District Court\u2019s summary-judgment\norder is properly before us. See Bethel v. McAllister Bros., Inc., 81 F.3d 376, 382 (3d\nCir. 1996) (\u201c[A]n otherwise non-appealable order may become final for the purposes of\nappeal where a [party] voluntarily and finally abandons the other claims in the\nlitigation.\u201d).\n                                             3\n\f       As we have previously explained, \u201ca plaintiff alleging that one or more officers\n\nengaged in unconstitutional conduct must establish the \u2018personal involvement\u2019 of each\n\nnamed defendant to survive summary judgment and take that defendant to trial.\u201d\n\nJutrowski v. Township of Riverdale, 904 F.3d 280, 285 (3d Cir. 2018). We find no error\n\nin the District Court\u2019s determination that Officer Oliveira had no role in the events\n\nunderlying Easterling\u2019s excessive-force and delay-of-medical-care claims, and that\n\nCaptain Perez\u2019s role was limited to the events underlying the excessive-force claim.\n\nAccordingly, our analysis of the excessive-force claim examines the conduct of Captain\n\nPerez and Officer Baker only, while our analysis of the delay-of-medical-care claim\n\nfocuses solely on the conduct of Officer Baker.\n\n       Easterling\u2019s excessive-force claim is governed by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s\n\nobjective reasonableness test. See Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395, 397 (1989).\n\nWe evaluate the objective reasonableness of an officer\u2019s use of force \u201cfrom the\n\nperspective of the officer at the time of the incident and not with the benefit of\n\nhindsight.\u201d Santini v. Fuentes, 795 F.3d 410, 417 (3d Cir. 2015). This is a \u201chighly\n\nindividualized and fact specific\u201d inquiry, in which we examine the totality of the\n\ncircumstances. Id. \u201cThe calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact\n\nthat police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments\u2014in circumstances\n\nthat are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving\u2014about the amount of force that is\n\nnecessary in a particular situation.\u201d Graham, 490 U.S. at 396-97.\n\n       We find no error in the District Court\u2019s disposition of Easterling\u2019s excessive-force\n\nclaim. As the District Court explained, the undisputed facts in this case show that, while\n\n                                              4\n\fthe robbery was taking place, a man named James Harris escaped from the store and\n\nalerted Captain Perez, who was nearby. When Captain Perez arrived at the scene, he\n\nobserved, through a plexiglass door, that Easterling was brandishing a gun and appeared\n\nto be pointing the gun in his and Harris\u2019s direction. Captain Perez responded by firing\n\ntwo shots at Easterling in quick succession, and a piece of the second bullet hit Easterling\n\nin the back as he turned away. When Officer Baker arrived at the scene shortly\n\nthereafter, Easterling was lying on the ground while Captain Perez stood over him with a\n\ngun trained on him. Officer Baker, who was unaware that Easterling had been shot,\n\nproceeded to handcuff Easterling. It was only when Officer Baker took Easterling to a\n\npatrol car that he (Officer Baker) noticed that Easterling was bleeding from his back and\n\nlearned that Easterling had been shot. We agree with the District Court that the force\n\nused by Captain Perez and Officer Baker was reasonable under the totality of the\n\ncircumstances.\n\n       We now turn to Easterling\u2019s delay-of-medical-care claim. To prevail on this\n\nclaim, he must show that Officer Baker was deliberately indifferent to his need for\n\nmedical care for his gunshot wound. See Groman v. Township of Manalapan, 47 F.3d\n\n628, 636-37 (3d Cir. 1995). We agree with the District Court that Easterling cannot make\n\nthis showing as a matter of law. The undisputed facts demonstrate that, upon learning\n\nthat Easterling had been shot, Officer Baker immediately decided to drive Easterling to\n\nthe hospital. Officer Baker started driving at 3:10 p.m., which was, at most, only ten\n\nminutes after Easterling had been shot. At 3:13 p.m., Officer Baker flagged down an\n\nambulance. Easterling was then transferred to the ambulance and began receiving\n\n                                             5\n\fmedical care. Officer Baker ensured that the ambulance arrived promptly at the hospital\n\nby arranging for a police escort and blocking traffic. The ambulance arrived at the\n\nhospital at 3:28 p.m., and Easterling was discharged less than four hours later. As the\n\nDistrict Court explained, the undisputed facts of record show that Officer Baker\n\n\u201cresponded promptly and appropriately upon learning that [Easterling] was shot.\u201d (Dist.\n\nCt. Op. entered Jan. 24, 2019, at 22.) Accordingly, the District Court correctly granted\n\nsummary judgment against Easterling on his delay-of-medical-care claim.\n\n       Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, 3 we will summarily\n\naffirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  The District Court correctly concluded that, because Easterling\u2019s excessive-force and\ndelay-of-medical-care claims failed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, they also failed under the\nNew Jersey Civil Rights Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 10:6-1 et seq. See Estate of Roman v.\nCity of Newark, 914 F.3d 789, 796 n.5 (3d Cir. 2019) (noting that this New Jersey statute\n\u201cis interpreted analogously to . . . \u00a7 1983\u201d (quoting Coles v. Carlini, 162 F. Supp. 3d 380,\n404 (D.N.J. 2015))). To the extent that Easterling also intended to appeal from the\nDistrict Court\u2019s screening-stage dismissal of his other claims, such a challenge lacks\nmerit for substantially the reasons provided by the District Court in its opinion entered\nNovember 15, 2016.\n                                             6\n\f",
