He also\npleaded \u201ctrue\u201d to the allegation that, during the commission of the offense, he used\nor exhibited a deadly weapon. After the jury found Appellant guilty and found the\ndeadly weapon allegation to be true, the trial proceeded into the punishment phase.\nAppellant had elected to have the jury assess his punishment. Although Appellant\n\fhad pleaded \u201ctrue\u2019 to two enhancement paragraphs (subject to objections not\nrelevant to this appeal), the jury found only one of them to be true and assessed\nAppellant\u2019s punishment at confinement for life and a $5,000 fine. We affirm.\n      Appellant urges reversible error in three separate issues on appeal. In his first\nissue on appeal, Appellant complains that the trial court reversibly erred when it\ndenied him the right to voir dire a witness that he considered to be an expert witness.\nAn overruled hearsay objection is the subject of Appellant\u2019s second issue on appeal.\nFinally, in his third issue on appeal, Appellant finds fault with the trial court\u2019s ruling\non an objection that he made to the State\u2019s final jury argument.\n      At the time of this offense, Heather Conner was a fourth grade teacher at\nCompass Academy in Abilene. She testified that on August 1, 2013, she had been\nto a work-related training session. After she left the session, she went home to pick\nup her daughters, Alexa and Macayla. Five-year-old Macayla\u2019s birthday was the\nfollowing day. They had planned a birthday party for later that evening ahead of her\nactual birthday. Their plan was to stop at HEB on the way to the party to pick up\ndrinks, other refreshments, and a birthday cake that Heather had previously ordered.\n      Things did not work out the way that they had planned. When they arrived at\nHEB, Heather parked her car in the parking lot, and she and her daughters walked\ntoward the store. About the time that the three reached the crosswalk that extended\nfrom the parking lot to the store, she noticed a vehicle coming toward them. When\nthe vehicle reached Heather and her daughters, Appellant, a passenger in the vehicle,\nasked Heather for directions. As Heather gave directions to Appellant, he reached\nback into the car, held out a white piece of paper, and pointed at it. Heather stepped\nforward to see the paper. When she stepped forward, Appellant grabbed her purse,\nand the driver \u201cgassed it\u201d and took off through the parking lot. Heather got tangled\nin her purse, and as it came off, she tried to hold on to it as the driver sped through\nthe parking lot. She ultimately held onto the window until Appellant shoved her\n                                            2\n\faway. When Appellant shoved her away from the vehicle, Heather \u201cflew\u201d off and\nlanded in the parking lot. Her young daughters screamed and cried as they ran to\nhelp her.\n      Shortly after the incident, personnel from HEB and others helped tend to\nHeather\u2019s daughters, and an HEB employee began to clean and bandage Heather\u2019s\nwounds. Dr. James Adams, a physician who later treated Heather, testified at trial.\nThe injuries that Heather received in the assault turned out to be very serious, and\neven with surgery, she will not recover the normal use of her injured arm.\n      While Heather was still at HEB, she began to receive calls from credit card\ncompanies and was told that her credit cards were being used.            Police later\napprehended Appellant and the driver of the car.\n      We will first address Appellant\u2019s complaint that Brenda Hardin was an expert\nwitness and that the trial court committed reversible error when it did not allow him\nto voir dire the witness under Rule 705(b) of the Texas Rules of Evidence.\nRule 705(b) provides that, before an expert states an opinion or discloses the\nunderlying facts or data, the trial court must allow a defendant in a criminal case to\nvoir dire the witness about the underlying facts or data. TEX. R. EVID. 705(b).\n      Brenda Hardin was not an expert witness. Hardin had retired after twenty\nyears of employment with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Parole\nDivision. She began her employment as a parole officer who supervised offenders\nand later worked as a unit supervisor, and in that capacity, she supervised other\nofficers.\n      During direct examination by the State, the prosecutor asked Hardin to\ndescribe the parole process, including the process applicable to out-of-state parolees\nsuch as Appellant. Hardin had supervised Appellant; he had been placed on parole\nfrom the State of Missouri for unlawfully carrying a weapon and possession and\nconcealment of a controlled substance in a jail facility. The State also asked Hardin\n                                          3\n\fwhether, as far as Texas was concerned, she had \u201cever supervised somebody on\nparole for possession of a controlled substance in a jail facility.\u201d She answered that\nshe had. The prosecutor then asked, \u201cWhat level offense is that?\u201d As Hardin began\nto answer, Appellant\u2019s counsel told the court, \u201cObjection, Your Honor. May I take\n[the witness] on Voir Dire?\u201d The trial court responded, \u201cNo, sir. You can cross-\nexamine her when the time comes.\u201d Hardin testified that the offense was a third-\ndegree felony in Texas. Although Appellant\u2019s attorney did cross-examine Hardin,\ncounsel made no further objection.\n      Hardin never testified to her opinion about anything; she merely stated the\nfacts as she knew them. Hardin\u2019s testimony that possession of a controlled substance\nin a jail facility was a third-degree felony was not an opinion. When she did not\nknow a particular fact\u2014for instance, whether the law was the same in Missouri\u2014\nshe testified that she did not know. Because Hardin did not testify as an expert, the\ntrial court did not err when it refused to allow Appellant to engage her in voir dire\nunder Rule 705(b). We overrule Appellant\u2019s first issue.\n      Greg Conner, Heather\u2019s husband, was a police officer for about twenty years\nbefore he obtained his law license.           Greg subsequently served in several\nprosecutorial positions. He was in his office in the Ector County Courthouse when\nHeather called him. When Heather told Greg about the robbery, he went to the HEB.\nGreg testified that \u201cyou can never quit being a cop,\u201d and he immediately began to\ngather ideas and evidence to provide to the police when they arrived.\n      The events surrounding the robbery were captured on video surveillance\nequipment. At some point in time, Greg viewed the entire surveillance video. Only\na portion of the video was introduced into evidence at trial. Over Appellant\u2019s\nhearsay objection, the trial court allowed Greg to testify as to the contents of the\nportion of the video that was not introduced into evidence. In his second issue on\nappeal, Appellant claims that the trial court thereby reversibly erred.\n                                          4\n\f      The State does not expend many words in defense of the introduction of the\ntestimony. See TEX. R. EVID. 1001\u20131009. Rather, the State claims that any error\ndid not result in such harm as would require that we reverse this case. We agree\nthat, even if we were to assume that the trial court abused its discretion when it\nadmitted Greg\u2019s testimony, the error is not reversible.\n      If a trial court commits error when it erroneously admits hearsay evidence, the\nerror is nonconstitutional. Render v. State, 347 S.W.3d 905, 920 (Tex. App.\u2014\nEastland 2011, pet. ref\u2019d). We must disregard a nonconstitutional error if it does not\naffect substantial rights. \u201cA substantial right is affected when the error had a\nsubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d\nSchmutz v. State, 440 S.W.3d 29, 39 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014). \u201c[S]ubstantial rights\nare not affected by the erroneous admission of evidence \u2018if the appellate court, after\nexamining the record as a whole, has fair assurance that the error did not influence\nthe jury, or had but a slight effect.\u2019\u201d Motilla v. State, 78 S.W.3d 352, 355 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2002) (quoting Solomon v. State, 49 S.W.3d 356, 365 (Tex. Crim. Ap.\n2001)). \u201cIn assessing the likelihood that the jury\u2019s decision was adversely affected\nby the error, the appellate court should consider everything in the record, including\nany testimony or physical evidence admitted for the jury\u2019s consideration, the nature\nof the evidence supporting the verdict, the character of the alleged error and how it\nmight be considered in connection with other evidence in the case.\u201d Id. We may\nalso consider the jury instructions, the State\u2019s theory and any defensive theories,\nclosing arguments, voir dire, whether the State emphasized the error, and whether\nthere was \u201coverwhelming evidence of guilt.\u201d Id. at 357.\n      Here, Heather testified that she and her daughters were in the crosswalk in the\nparking lot about to enter HEB when she saw the car in which Appellant was riding\ncoming toward her.      The \u201cwindow rolled down\u201d and the car stopped.           After\nAppellant asked for directions, he got a piece of paper from inside the car and held\n                                          5\n\fit out toward Heather. When she leaned in, \u201c[Appellant] came out of the car, like,\njust his upper body,\u201d and grabbed the purse, and the driver took off as Heather held\non until Appellant shoved her loose and sent her flying in the parking lot. The jury\nalso heard how Heather\u2019s daughters were screaming and crying as they watched the\nevents unfold. Further, the jury heard testimony that described the severity of the\ninjuries suffered by Heather. The jury also heard that, as Heather was being treated\nfor her injuries, Appellant and the driver were already using the credit cards at places\nsuch as Stripes, 7-Eleven, Game Stop, Sally Beauty Supply, and Bealls.\n      The jury also heard testimony regarding Appellant\u2019s criminal record. In\nMissouri, he had been convicted of unlawful use of a weapon and possession of a\ncontrolled substance in a jail facility. He had also had his deferred adjudication\nrevoked in connection with a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon,\nand he had convictions for trespassing, evading arrest, two cases of driving while\nintoxicated, and false identification. Additionally, law enforcement officers testified\nas to Appellant\u2019s propensity, while in jail, to exhibit his penis to female officers, to\nask female officers whether they were wearing thong underwear or no underwear\u2014\nso that he could have sex with them, to \u201cflip [them] off,\u201d and to do and say many\nother lewd and disrespectful things while in custody.\n      Heather testified that her recitation of the facts is fairly and accurately\nrepresented by the portion of the surveillance video that was admitted at trial. Greg\ntestified that the portion of the unadmitted video that he watched showed that\nAppellant and the driver stalked Heather before they attacked her, that they were\npredators, and that the attack was planned and premeditated. We agree with the State\nthat the jury could reasonably infer those matters from Heather\u2019s testimony, from\nthe video that was admitted into evidence, and from the other evidence in the case.\nWe also note that the State only briefly referred to Greg\u2019s testimony about the video.\n\n\n                                           6\n\f      When we review the record as a whole, we have fair assurance that any error\nin the admission of Greg\u2019s testimony did not influence the jury in its assessment of\npunishment, or had but a slight effect. Appellant\u2019s substantial rights were not\naffected by the admission of Greg\u2019s testimony about the portion of the video that\nwas not in evidence. We overrule Appellant\u2019s second issue on appeal.\n      In his third issue on appeal, Appellant maintains that the trial court erred when\nit failed to sustain certain objections to the State\u2019s jury argument. Proper jury\nargument generally falls within four areas: (1) summation of the evidence;\n(2) reasonable deduction from the evidence; (3) answer to argument of opposing\ncounsel; or (4) plea for law enforcement. Brown v. State, 270 S.W.3d 564, 570 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2008); Esquivel v. State, 180 S.W.3d 689, 692 (Tex. App.\u2014Eastland\n2005, no pet.). Counsel is allowed wide latitude to draw inferences from the record\nas long as the inferences are reasonable, fair, legitimate, and offered in good faith.\nShannon v. State, 942 S.W.2d 591, 597 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).\n      Specifically, Appellant first complains of the State\u2019s jury argument wherein\nthe State argued, \u201c[Appellant is] sitting there like this, going through credit cards.\nUsing coupons. Even trying to return the PlayStation 3 so he can get cash.\u201d\nAppellant objected that the prosecutor was \u201c[a]rguing outside the evidence.\u201d The\ntrial court overruled the objection and commented, \u201cThe jury will recall the\nevidence.\u201d Appellant argues that there was no evidence to show what Appellant\u2019s\nmotive was for returning the PlayStation 3 to Game Stop and that the State\u2019s\ncomment was \u201ccomplete speculation\u201d and \u201csimply served to inflame the prejudices\nof jury members against [Appellant].\u201d We hold that the argument was a logical\ninference from the record. As the State argues, there could be few, if any, reasons\nto return an item paid for with a stolen credit card except to acquire cash. We agree\nwith the State that Appellant certainly was not seeking to return the PlayStation 3 so\n\n\n                                          7\n\fthat Heather could receive proper credit on her credit card bill. The argument was\nnot improper.\n      Appellant next finds fault with that part of the State\u2019s jury argument in which\nthe prosecutor told the jury, \u201cWhat kind of message do you send if you even think\nabout 15 or 20 or 30 years on this thing? Why don\u2019t they do something about it?\nToday, they are you. You are the only ones, and I am counting on you to send this\nmessage.\u201d\n      An argument by the State is improper if it induces the jury to reach a particular\nverdict based upon the demands, desires, or expectations of the community. See\nCortez v. State, 683 S.W.2d 419, 421 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984) (the argument, \u201cNow,\nthe only punishment that you can assess that would be any satisfaction at all to the\npeople of [this] county would be life,\u201d is improper); Mata v. State, 952 S.W.2d 30,\n33 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 1997, no pet.) (improper to argue, \u201cSo I ask you, this\nis a hard decision that you have to make, but I will tell you on behalf of the State of\nTexas, an aggravated sexual assault such as this, probation is not what this\ncommunity and what the State would want.\u201d). On the other hand, an argument\nconstitutes a proper plea for law enforcement if it urges the jury to be the voice of\nthe community, rather than asking the jury to lend its ear to the community. Cortez,\n683 S.W.2d at 421. Therefore, a prosecutor\u2019s request that the jury \u201crepresent the\ncommunity\u201d and \u201csend a message\u201d is within the bounds of proper argument as a plea\nfor law enforcement. See Goocher v. State, 633 S.W.2d 860, 864 (Tex. Crim. App.\n[Panel Op.] 1982) (it was proper for the State to argue, \u201cI am asking you to enforce\nit. I\u2019m asking you to do what needs to be done to send these type of people a message\nto tell them we\u2019re not tolerating this type of behavior in our county.\u201d); Caballero v.\nState, 919 S.W.2d 919, 924 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, pet. ref\u2019d)\n(holding proper the argument, \u201c[J]urors are sick and tired of this. Jurors are tired of\n\n\n                                          8\n\fcrime because jurors such as yourself are members of the community you represent.\nYou represent the community.\u201d)\n      Here, the State did not pressure the jury to reach a particular verdict based\nupon the demands, desires, or expectations of the community. Rather, the prosecutor\nargued that the jury represented the community and asked the jury to send a message\nby its verdict. The complained-of argument effectively asks the jury to act as the\nvoice of the community, not to lend its ear to the community. The argument\nconstitutes a proper plea for law enforcement. Accordingly, we hold that the trial\ncourt did not err by overruling Appellant\u2019s objection to the argument. We overrule\nAppellant\u2019s third issue on appeal.\n      We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                               JIM R.
