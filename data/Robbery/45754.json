Case No. 22-cr-63 (RCL)\n\n SAEVE EVANS,\n\n                Defendant.\n\n\n                                 MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       Defendant Saeve Evans is charged with one count of kidnapping resulting in death, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a). Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot., ECF No. 45, at 1 n.1. He entered a plea of not\n\nguilty and is scheduled to stand trial on November 14, 2022. See Minute Entry (March 10, 2022);\n\nMinute Entry (Oct. 14, 2022). Before the Court are Mr. Evans\u2019s two motions to dismiss the\n\nindictment. Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot.; Def.\u2019s R. 16 Mot., ECF No. 23. Upon consideration of the parties\u2019\n\nfilings, the record therein, and the applicable law, the Court will DENY both of those motions.\n\n                                    I.      BACKGROUND\n\n       The charge against Mr. Evans relates to the May 2, 2009 death of Kareem Ware. Def.\u2019s R.\n\n16 Mot. at 2. Mr. Ware died of three gunshot wounds to the head while riding in the front seat of\n\na Chrysler Pacifica sport utility vehicle (\u201cSUV\u201d). Id. at 3. The SUV\u2019s journey began in Maryland\n\nand ended in Washington, D.C. Id. at 2\u20133.\n\n       In May 2019, the government filed a criminal complaint against Mr. Evans in D.C.\n\nSuperior Court, charging him with first-degree murder while armed and felony murder, in violation\n\nof D.C. law. Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot., ECF No. 52, at 6. In August 2019, Mr. Evans\n\nmoved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the D.C. Superior Court lacked subject-matter\n\njurisdiction over the case because the alleged crime took place entirely in Maryland. Def.\u2019s R. 48\n\n                                                1\n\fMot. at 3; Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 6\u20137. In October 2019, the Honorable Danya A.\n\nDayson, the first D.C. Superior Court judge to preside over the case, ruled that the court properly\n\npossessed subject-matter jurisdiction. Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 7. Mr. Evans\u2019s trial was\n\nscheduled for June 2020. Id. In the meantime, a grand jury returned an indictment charging him\n\nwith several counts, including first-degree premeditated murder while armed, felony murder,\n\nrobbery while armed, and kidnapping while armed. Id. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr.\n\nEvans\u2019s trial was continued and in March 2021, his trial was rescheduled for January 2022. Id.\n\n        In August 2021, Mr. Evans moved to dismiss the D.C. Superior Court indictment, again\n\nchallenging that court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction. Id. at 7\u20138. In October 2021, the Honorable\n\nNeal E. Kravitz, to whom the case had been reassigned, suggested that the jurisdictional issue\n\ncould only be resolved at trial, where the government would have the burden of proving where the\n\nfatal shot occurred. Id. at 8. Judge Kravitz acquiesced to the defense\u2019s request to submit\n\nsupplemental briefing. Id. at 8\u20139. The trial was again rescheduled to February or March 2022. Id.\n\n        By January 2022, Mr. Evans\u2019s D.C. Superior Court case had again been reassigned, this\n\ntime to the Honorable Maribeth Raffinan. Id. at 9. After a status conference, the defense presented\n\nsupplemental briefing and petitioned the court to decide the jurisdictional issue before trial. Id.\n\nThe government urged Judge Raffinan to delay ruling until trial, but on January 25, 2022, Judge\n\nRaffinan announced that she intended to rule on the jurisdictional issue before trial and directed\n\nthe parties to file additional briefing on that issue. Id. at 9\u201310. The parties filed that briefing, but\n\non February 21, 2022, before Judge Raffinan ruled on the jurisdictional issue, the government filed\n\nthe present charges against Mr. Evans in this Court. Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 3\u20134; Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to\n\nDef.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 10\u201311; Compl., ECF No. 1. The next day, the government informed Judge\n\nRaffinan of that development at a D.C. Superior Court hearing and then moved to dismiss the D.C.\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fSuperior Court indictment against Mr. Evans without prejudice under D.C. Superior Court Rule\n\n48\u2014the local equivalent of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(a). Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R.\n\n48 Mot. at 11 & n.3. In July 2022, Judge Raffinan denied the government\u2019s request to dismiss the\n\nD.C. Superior Court indictment without prejudice, determining that the government had engaged\n\nin prosecutorial harassment.1 Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 4.\n\n         Mr. Evans has moved in this Court to dismiss his indictment on two grounds. First, he\n\nalleges that dismissal is warranted because the government violated Federal Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure 16 and the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause when it failed to preserve the SUV\n\nand provided allegedly insufficient photographic evidence of the SUV. See Def.\u2019s R. 16 Mot.;\n\nDef.\u2019s Suppl. R. 16 Mot., ECF No. 48; Def.\u2019s 2d Suppl. R. 16 Mot., ECF No. 61. In the alternative,\n\nMr. Evans urges this Court to sanction the government for its failure to preserve the SUV by\n\nprecluding expert testimony about it. See Def.\u2019s R. 16 Mot. at 2. The government opposes Mr.\n\nEvans\u2019s motion, arguing that law enforcement extensively documented the SUV before returning\n\nit to its owner2 and the government has made all photographic and documentary evidence available\n\nto the defense. See Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 16 Mot., ECF No. 31; Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s Suppl.\n\nR. 16 Mot., ECF No. 57.\n\n         Mr. Evans also moves to dismiss his indictment pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure 48(a) and the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause because of the government\u2019s\n\ncharging practices in this case.3 Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot.; Def.\u2019s Reply to Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48\n\n\n1\n  The government appealed Judge Raffinan\u2019s ruling, arguing that she applied the incorrect legal standard for\nprosecutorial harassment under D.C. law. See Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 13\u201314; Not. (Oct. 21, 2022), ECF\nNo. 64.\n2\n  The vehicle\u2019s owner, Ms. Kimberly Wright-Stoddard, testified at a November 7, 2022 motions hearing before the\nundersigned that the government released the SUV back to her but that she never regained physical possession of the\nvehicle due to the significant damage it sustained during the incident. See Gov\u2019t Ex. 13.\n3\n  Mr. Evans moves to dismiss under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 12, which requires that the defense of\n\u201cdefect in instituting the prosecution, including . . . preindictment delay\u201d be raised prior to trial. Fed. R. Crim. P.\n12(b)(3)(A)(ii).\n\n                                                          3\n\fMot., ECF No. 59. Specifically, Mr. Evans argues that the government engaged in prosecutorial\n\nharassment by initially charging him in D.C. Superior court and then, when the court seemed\n\npoised to dismiss the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, charging Mr. Evans in federal\n\ncourt but moving to dismiss the original indictment without prejudice. Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 4\u20135.\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Evans insists that this Court must dismiss the instant indictment based on Judge\n\nRaffinan\u2019s determination that the government had engaged in prosecutorial harassment. Id. at 5.\n\nFinally, he contends that the ten-year delay between the alleged crime and his indictment violated\n\nhis due process rights. Id. The government opposes this motion as well, denying the allegations of\n\nprosecutorial harassment, contending that this Court is not bound by Judge Raffinan\u2019s\n\ndetermination, and asserting that Mr. Evans has not met his burden to establish a Due Process\n\nviolation based on a pre-indictment delay. Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. Mr. Evans\u2019s motions\n\nare ripe for review.\n\n                                 II.    LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n       A. Due Process Clause\n\n       The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o person shall . . . be\n\ndeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V.\n\n       \u201c[T]o establish a due process violation [for failure to preserve evidence], the defendant\n\nbears the burden of proving that the government failed in bad faith to preserve material and\n\npotentially exculpatory evidence.\u201d United States v. McKie, 951 F.2d 399, 403 (D.C. Cir. 1991)\n\n(emphases in original) (citing Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 58 (1988)). When evaluating\n\na situation of whether the failure \u201cto preserve evidentiary material of which no more can be said\n\nthan that it could have been subjected to tests, the results of which might have exonerated the\n\ndefendant,\u201d the defendant must show \u201cbad faith.\u201d Youngblood, 488 U.S. at 57\u201358. In these\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fsituations, \u201cbad faith cannot be inferred from the mere act of nonpreservation itself.\u201d United States\n\nv. Taylor, 312 F. Supp. 3d 170, 177 (D.D.C. 2018). In sum, \u201cneither negligence nor incompleteness\n\nviolates the Due Process Clause\u201d\u2014only bad faith. Id. at 179.\n\n       To establish a due process violation for pre-indictment delay, \u201ca defendant must establish\n\nthat the delay resulted in \u2018actual prejudice to the conduct of the defense\u2019 and that the government\n\n\u2018intentionally delayed to gain some tactical advantage\u2019 over the defendant.\u201d United States v.\n\nBrodie, 326 F. Supp. 2d 83, 87 (D.D.C. 2004) (quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 325\n\n(1971)). The proof of prejudice must \u201cbe definite and not speculative. Courts apply the actual\n\nprejudice test stringently.\u201d United States v. Manning, 56 F.3d 1188, 1194 (9th Cir. 1995) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Butz, 982 F.2d 1378, 1380 (9th Cir. 1993)). Not only must the prejudice be actual,\n\nit must be substantial. Marion, 404 U.S. at 325. \u201cA mere loss of potential witnesses is insufficient\n\nabsent a showing that their testimony would have actually aided the defense.\u201d United States v.\n\nCrouch, 84 F.3d 1497, 1515 (5th Cir. 1996) (internal citation omitted) (collecting cases).\n\n       B. Federal of Criminal Procedure 16\n\n       Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 requires that the government:\n\n               permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or photograph books,\n               papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or\n               places, or copies or portions of any of these items, if the item is\n               within the government\u2019s possession, custody, or control and:\n                   (i) the item is material to preparing the defense;\n                   (ii) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at\n                   trial; or\n                   (iii) the item was obtained from or belongs to the defendant.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. (16)(a)(1)(E). Evidence is material \u201cas long as there is a strong indication that it\n\nwill play an important role in uncovering admissible evidence, aiding witness preparation,\n\ncorroborating testimony, or assisting impeachment or rebuttal.\u201d United States v. Lloyd, 992 F.2d\n\n348, 351 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Circuit has held\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fthat \u201cduty of disclosure is operative as a duty of preservation.\u201d United States v. Bryant, 439 F.2d\n\n642, 651 (D.C. Cir. 1971). While the holding in Bryant is somewhat suspect post-Youngblood\n\nbecause it also relied on the Due Process Clause, the Circuit has never \u201cdisavowed the Rule 16\n\nanalysis contained in Bryant.\u201d Taylor, 312 F. Supp. at 181. \u201cThe district court has wide discretion\n\nin imposing a sanction if it finds that Rule 16 has been violated.\u201d United States v. Marshall, 132\n\nF.3d 63, 69 (D.C. Cir. 1998).\n\n       C. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(a)\n\n       Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(a), \u201c[t]he government may, with leave of\n\ncourt, dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(a) (emphasis added).\n\nIt is well-settled that prosecutors are agents of the executive branch and that decisions to \u201cdismiss\n\ncharges once brought, lie[] at the core of the Executive\u2019s duty to see the faithful execution of the\n\nlaws.\u201d United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 818 F.3d 733, 741 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted) (alteration in original). As a result, \u201cfew subjects are less adapted to\n\njudicial review than the exercise by the Executive of [its] discretion in deciding when and whether\n\nto institute criminal proceedings, or what precise charges shall be made, or whether to dismiss a\n\nproceeding once brought.\u201d Newman v. United States, 382 F.2d 479, 480 (D.C. Cir. 1967).\n\nNevertheless, a district court has some supervisory authority over prosecutorial decisions through\n\nRule 48(a), which requires the government to ask for \u201cleave of court\u201d to dismiss an indictment.\n\nSee United States v. Flynn, 507 F. Supp. 3d 116, 126\u201328 (D.D.C. 2020).\n\n       That said, the \u201cprincipal object of the \u2018leave of court\u2019 requirement has been understood to\n\nbe a narrow one\u2014\u2018to protect a defendant against prosecutorial harassment.\u2019\u201d Fokker, 818 F.3d at\n\n742 (citing Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 29 n.15 (1977)). Such \u201cprosecutorial harassment\u201d\n\noccurs when prosecutors exhibit \u201crepeated efforts to bring\u2014and then dismiss\u2014charges.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f\u201cNumerous courts have held that the presence or absence of good faith is important in determining\n\nwhether dismissal without prejudice and prosecution on a new indictment are permissible.\u201d\n\nWorkman v. United States, 255 A.3d 971, 977\u201378 (D.C. 2021) (collecting cases); see Rinaldi, 434\n\nU.S. at 30.\n\n       D. Collateral Estoppel\n\n       \u201cThe collateral estoppel doctrine, which has its roots in the civil law, \u2018prevent[s] repetitious\n\nlitigation of the same issue by the same parties.\u2019\u201d United States v. McMillian, 898 A.2d 922, 931\n\n(D.C. 2006) (citing Laughlin v. United States, 344 F.2d 187, 189 (D.C. Cir. 1965) (alteration in\n\noriginal)). Collateral estoppel is \u201can established rule of federal criminal law.\u201d Ashe v. Swenson,\n\n397 U.S. 436, 444 (1970). Under the Full Faith and Credit Act, federal courts must give preclusive\n\neffect to qualifying state court judgments. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738; Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90,\n\n105 (1980). State law determines the requirements for issue preclusion to apply. See Kremer v.\n\nChemical Construction Co., 456 U.S. 461, 481\u201382 (1982).\n\n                                      III.    DISCUSSION\n\n       A. Mr. Evans Has Not Established That the Government Violated the Due Process\n          Clause or Federal of Criminal Procedure Rule 16 When Failing to Preserve the\n          SUV\n\n       Mr. Evans first moves to dismiss his indictment because the government did not \u201cpreserve\n\nmaterial and potentially exculpatory evidence\u201d in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n\n16 and the Due Process Clause. See Def.\u2019s R. 16 Mot. at 1. Mr. Evans raises two related arguments:\n\n(1) that the government failed to preserve the SUV in which Mr. Ware was killed for the defense\n\nto inspect and (2) the photographs of the SUV taken by the government after the incident and\n\nbefore the SUV was returned to its owner are \u201cinsufficient in scope and, many of them, of unusable\n\nquality.\u201d Def.\u2019s 2d Suppl. R. 16 Mot. at 1. In support of his claims, Mr. Evans retained LeeAnn\n\nSingley, a forensic scientist and blood spatter expert, who concluded that \u201cthere were insufficient\n                                                  7\n\foverall photographs received (i.e., photographs that depict the entire rear interior of the vehicle) to\n\ndetermine the extent of the bloodstain patterns\u201d and \u201csome of the photographs\u201d \u201cwere of\n\ninsufficient quality to evaluate for the presence or absence of blood or bloodstain patterns.\u201d Singley\n\n1st Aff., Ex 1 to Def.\u2019s Suppl. R. 16 Mot., ECF No. 48-1, at 2\u20133; see also Singley 2d Aff., Ex 1 to\n\nDef.\u2019s 2d Suppl. R. 16 Mot., ECF No. 61-1, at 1 (\u201cUpon review and examination of these original\n\nphotographs, the determinations and conclusions drawn in the previous declaration remain\n\nunchanged\u201d). Additionally, Mr. Kenneth Martin, an expert in crime scene processing, testified at\n\na November 7, 2022 motions hearing before the undersigned that, in his opinion, the existing\n\nphotographs of the SUV\u2019s interior are insufficient in both quality and quantity for Mr. Evans\u2019s\n\ndefense to contest certain conclusions drawn by the government\u2019s expert. The government argues\n\nthat the SUV was extensively photographed, swabbed for DNA, tested, and its condition\n\ndocumented in the days after the incident. Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s Suppl. R. 16 Mot. at 3. The\n\ngovernment further notes that it had no obligation to indefinitely preserve the SUV. Id.\n\n       The government did not violate the Mr. Evans\u2019s rights under the Due Process Clause\n\nthrough its handling of the SUV. The government immediately took possession of the vehicle after\n\nfinding Mr. Ware\u2019s body on May 2, 2009. Def.\u2019s R. 16 Mot. at 3. One expert\u2014Lt. Richard Hinds\u2014\n\nconducted a visual examination of the SUV on May 7, 2009 and issued a report on May 20, 2009.\n\nId. During that examination, 38 photographs of the SUV were taken. Id. Other law enforcement\n\nofficers photographed and processed the SUV on May 10, 2009. Id. at 4. The processing included\n\nswabbing for blood and other biological evidence and conducting a \u201ctrajectory analysis.\u201d Gov\u2019t\n\nOpp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 16 Mot. at 2. Finally, a second expert\u2014Officer William Greene\u2014conducted a\n\nvisual examination of the SUV on May 18, 2009, took approximately 16 photographs, and issued\n\na report on May 19, 2009. Def.\u2019s R. 16 Mot. at 4. On June 23, 2009, the government released the\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fvehicle back to its owner because no suspects had been identified. Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s Suppl.\n\nR. 16 Mot. at 1.\n\n         Mr. Evans alleges that the officers \u201chad to have known that the SUV could have potentially\n\nexculpatory value.\u201d Def.\u2019s R. 16 Mot. at 11. Even if this is true, he has not fulfilled his burden of\n\nshowing bad faith. The officers formally processed the SUV, including conducting multiple expert\n\nexaminations, performing biological and forensic swabbing, and taking numerous photographs.\n\nThe SUV was then released back to its owner because, at the time, law enforcement did not have\n\nany suspects. The Court is aware of no authority for the proposition that the Due Process Clause\n\nrequires law enforcement officials to maintain possession of a private vehicle involved in a\n\ncriminal act, indefinitely, in case a suspect is eventually identified. The police did not destroy the\n\nSUV or attempt to eliminate its use for trial and the government has made the evidence that it\n\ngathered, and relies upon, available to the defense. These circumstances do not constitute bad faith.\n\n         Similarly, the failure to retain possession of the SUV does not violate Federal of Criminal\n\nProcedure Rule 16. The government has provided the defense at least 74 photographs of the vehicle\n\nas well as expert reports on blood spatter analysis, firearms, and trajectory. Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s\n\nR. 16 Mot. at 3. This is a \u201csubstantial and meaningful production.\u201d United States v. Slough, 22 F.\n\nSupp. 3d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2014). If the defense\u2019s experts are of the opinion that the photographs do\n\nnot make it possible to draw certain conclusions, the remedy is for them to say so in their trial\n\ntestimony. And if the government intends to rely on \u201calleged observations [by experts] that are not\n\ncaptured by the photographic evidence,\u201d Def.\u2019s R. 16 Mot. at 9, the defense can cross-examine the\n\nexperts with the numerous contemporaneous photographs. Because the Court does not find that\n\nRule 16 was violated, the Court will not grant Mr. Evans\u2019s request for sanctions.4\n\n\n4\n Even if the Court were to have found a Rule 16 violation, the cases Mr. Evans cites to justify the imposition of\nsanctions without a bad faith finding are non-binding on this Court and clearly distinguishable. Mr. Evans first cites\n\n                                                          9\n\f         B. The Court Is Not Required\u2014and Declines\u2014to Dismiss the Indictment Against\n            Mr. Evans Under Federal of Criminal Procedure Rule 48(a)\n\n         Mr. Evans next moves to dismiss the indictment under Federal Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure 48(a). He argues that this Court must give preclusive effect to Judge Raffinan\u2019s\n\nfinding of prosecutorial harassment and, because of that finding, dismiss the federal case with\n\nprejudice. The Court disagrees.\n\n         As a threshold matter, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(a) requires the government\n\nto seek leave of court before voluntarily dismissing an indictment without prejudice, which the\n\ngovernment has not sought leave to do in this Court. See Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 17.\n\nThe Rule itself does not empower the Court to dismiss a second indictment against a defendant\n\non that defendant\u2019s motion because another court has denied leave to dismiss the first one\n\nwithout prejudice. Mr. Evans cites three cases in which the government\u2019s Rule 48(a) motion to\n\ndismiss the first indictment without prejudice was granted and then a court dismissed the second\n\nindictment (or reversed a conviction based on the second indictment), effectively converting the\n\nfirst dismissal to one with prejudice, as a remedy for taking the government at its word the first\n\ntime around. See Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 9\u201310 (citing United States v. Derr, 726 F.2d 617, 618 (10th\n\nCir. 1984); United States v. Salinas, 693 F.2d 348, 350 (5th Cir. 1982); United States v. Fields,\n\n\n\nto United States v. Sivilla, which found that a sanction was appropriate when \u201c[t]he prosecutor promised to protect\nthe evidence but failed to take any affirmative action to that end[, t]he government attorney prosecuting the case\nparticipated in the events leading to the failure to preserve[, and i]n total, the quality of the government\u2019s conduct\nwas poor.\u201d Def.\u2019s R. 16 Mot. at 10; 714 F.3d 1168, 1173 (9th Cir. 2013). Here, there is no allegation of similar\nlevels of negligence or misconduct by government investigators when processing and returning the vehicle or in the\nyears leading up to the indictment. Mr. Evans\u2019s invocation of United States v. Macken, No. 2:20-cr-23 (KJM), 2021\nWL 3738897, at *1 (E.D. Ca. 2021), is similarly unavailing. He cites this case for the proposition that \u201cin cases\nwhere there is a failure to preserve useful evidence but the government did not act in bad faith, a district court may\nstill impose sanctions including suppression of secondary evidence.\u201d Def.\u2019s R. 16 Mot. at 10; 2021 WL 3738897, at\n*5 (internal quotations and citation omitted). In that case, the court determined that sanctions were appropriate after\nthe police failed to conduct fingerprint or DNA testing on a paintball gun, which was the single most critical piece of\npotentially exculpatory evidence for the defendant. Id. at *1\u20132. As the government in this case points out, the SUV\nwas \u201cfully processed\u201d through the gathering of photographic, DNA, and fingerprint evidence before it was returned\nto its owner. Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 16 Mot. at 7\u20138.\n\n                                                          10\n\f475 F. Supp. 903, 904 (D.D.C. 1979)). But Mr. Evans does not cite any authority for the\n\nproposition that where, as here, one court denies the local equivalent of a Rule 48(a) motion and\n\ndeclines to dismiss the first indictment without prejudice, another court is then required to\n\nexercise its supervisory power to dismiss the second indictment with prejudice. In other words,\n\nregardless of what preclusive effect Judge Raffinan\u2019s finding is due, Rule 48(a) is not an\n\nappropriate mechanism for seeking a dismissal with prejudice on the defendant\u2019s motion in the\n\npresent procedural posture.5\n\n         Additionally, Mr. Evans looks to the wrong legal standard in attempting to convince this\n\nCourt to independently find that the government\u2019s actions amount to prosecutorial harassment.\n\nHe insists that the \u201cprimary concern\u201d of Rule 48(a) is \u201cprotecting a defendant from harassment,\n\nthrough a prosecutor\u2019s charging, dismissing without having placed a defendant in jeopardy, and\n\ncommencing another prosecution at a different time or place deemed more favorable to the\n\nprosecution.\u201d Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 5 (quoting United States v. Ammidown, 497 F.2d 615, 620\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1973)). However, the government is correct that the later decisions of Rinaldi\n\n(Supreme Court) and Fokker (Circuit) abandoned the \u201cmore favorable to the prosecution\u201d\n\nrequirement. See Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 24 n.14 (citing Rinaldi, 434 U.S. at 29\n\nn.15; Fokker, 818 F.3d at 742). And as the D.C. Court of Appeals and several federal circuit\n\ncourts\u2014including this Circuit\u2014agree, \u201ca flat rule that the government engages in impermissible\n\nharassment any time it dismisses an indictment in the hope of later reindicting the defendant\n\n\n\n\n5\n Even if this Court had the discretion to dismiss the second indictment, this Court would not, because Judge\nRaffinan\u2019s dismissal of the first indictment with prejudice is sufficient to vindicate the purpose of Rule 48(a) and its\nD.C. local equivalent. And the government has represented both to D.C. Superior Court and to Mr. Evans that it\ndoes not intend to bring the same case against him there. Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 25. Indeed, unless the\ngovernment succeeds on appeal of Judge Raffinan\u2019s order, it cannot bring the case there again.\n\n                                                           11\n\funder more favorable circumstances\u201d is \u201cboth unwarranted and contrary to the weight of\n\nauthority.\u201d Workman, 255 A.3d at 975 (referencing Fokker, 818 F.3d at 742).\n\n         Furthermore, even if the Court were required or permitted to dismiss a second indictment\n\nwith prejudice based on another court\u2019s finding of prosecutorial harassment for purposes of Rule\n\n48 or its local equivalent, Judge Raffinan\u2019s finding would not have preclusive effect in this case\n\nbased on principles of collateral estoppel. Mr. Evans argues that \u201ca combination of federal and\n\nDistrict of Columbia law requires this Court to give preclusive effect\u201d to Judge Raffinan\u2019s\n\nfinding of prosecutorial harassment. Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 12. Specifically, he insists that her\n\nruling meets the procedural criteria for collateral estoppel under D.C. law, and thus the Full Faith\n\nand Credit Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738, requires this Court to give preclusive effect to her ruling. See\n\nid. at 12\u201313. The government argues that the ruling is not subject to issue preclusion because\n\njeopardy had not attached. See Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 27\u201330.6 Mr. Evans opposes\n\nthe government\u2019s argument that jeopardy must attach for issue preclusion to apply, relying\n\nprimarily on two cases: United States v. Oppenheimer, 242 U.S. 85 (1916) and Laughlin v.\n\nUnited States, 344 F.2d 187 (D.C. Cir. 1965). See Def.\u2019s Reply to Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48\n\nMot. at 2\u20134.\n\n         Mr. Evans\u2019s reliance on Oppenheimer and Laughlin is misplaced. In Oppenheimer, the\n\nSupreme Court affirmed the lower court\u2019s bar on a second indictment against the same defendant\n\nfor the same offense when the earlier indictment was dismissed as time-barred. See 242 U.S. at\n\n87\u201388. In Laughlin, which relied in part on Oppenheimer, the Circuit held that the district court\u2019s\n\ndecision to exclude illegal evidence in the defendant\u2019s first prosecution, which resulted in a\n\n\n\n6\n  The government also argues that Judge Raffinan\u2019s ruling was not a \u201cqualifying final ruling\u201d under D.C. law and\nthus need not be given preclusive effect on this basis either. See Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 30. Because the\nCourt agrees with the government\u2019s first argument, it need not address the second.\n\n                                                         12\n\fmistrial and the dismissal of the first indictment, must be given preclusive effect in a later\n\nprosecution of the same defendant on a different charge. See 344 F.2d at 191\u201392.\n\n       Though this Circuit has not opined on the precise holding of Oppenheimer, the Second\n\nCircuit noted that \u201c[s]ince Oppenheimer, there has been much debate on whether that case was\n\ngrounded in the Double Jeopardy Clause or in broader Due Process arguments.\u201d United States v.\n\nDionisio, 503 F.3d 78, 85 (2d Cir. 2007) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit went on to say that\n\n\u201cthat discussion is neither here nor there\u201d because the Supreme Court more recently clarified that\n\nres judicata and collateral estoppel are \u201cingredient[s] of the Fifth Amendment guarantee against\n\ndouble jeopardy.\u201d Id. (citing Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 442 (1970) (alteration in original)).\n\nThis reading of collateral estoppel as connected to jeopardy comports with our Circuit\u2019s\n\nunderstanding. United States v. Burroughs, 810 F.3d 833, 838\u201339 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting Harris\n\nv. Washington, 404 U.S. 55, 56 (1971) (per curiam) (\u201cCriminal collateral estoppel is generally \u2018an\n\nintegral part of the protection against double jeopardy guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments.\u2019\u201d)).\n\n       The Court is also persuaded by the government\u2019s argument that the proper characterization\n\nof D.C. preclusion law in the criminal context, which requires jeopardy to attach, is embodied in\n\nUnited States v. McMillian, 898 A.2d 922 (D.C. 2006). See Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at\n\n27\u201328. In that case, the D.C. Court of Appeals emphasized that \u201c[c]onsistent with our view of [the]\n\nlimited applicability\u201d of issue preclusion in criminal cases, \u201cwe have applied the collateral estoppel\n\ndoctrine in criminal cases where constitutional double jeopardy has been implicated.\u201d McMillian,\n\n898 A.2d at 931 (citations omitted). Furthermore, the McMillian court carefully distinguished and\n\ncabined Laughlin, calling it \u201can unusual case, decided prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\n\nAshe.\u201d Id. at 932. But most importantly, the district court decision at issue in Laughlin\u2014the\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fexclusion of illegal evidence\u2014occurred in the context of the court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s\n\nmotion for a mistrial, and thus jeopardy had already attached. Id. In other words, Laughlin actually\n\nundermines, rather than supports, Mr. Evans\u2019s position.\n\n         No jury had been sworn nor had any evidence been presented in Mr. Evans\u2019s case in D.C.\n\nSuperior Court, therefore jeopardy had not attached when Judge Raffinan made her ruling. See\n\nColey v. United States, 267 A.3d 1065, 1067 (D.C. 2022). Because jeopardy had not attached, this\n\nCourt will follow the long-established practice of declining to apply collateral estoppel in a\n\ncriminal case absent a jeopardy attachment.\n\n         C. Mr. Evans Has Not Established That the Government Violated the Due Process\n            Clause Based on A Pre-Indictment Delay\n\n         Finally, Mr. Evans moves to dismiss the indictment under the Due Process Clause for\n\npre-indictment delay. The Court concludes that Mr. Evans has not meet his burden to establish a\n\ndue process violation based on any pre-indictment delay, and therefore the Court is not required\n\nto dismiss the indictment on this basis. First, Mr. Evans has not shown that any pre-indictment\n\ndelay was intentional on the part of the government. He faults the government for not advancing\n\nany reasons for its delay in charging Mr. Evans. See Def.\u2019s Reply to Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to R. 48 Mot.\n\nat 4\u20135. But that burden rests on Mr. Evans, not the government. See United States v. Pollack, 534\n\nF.2d 964, 969 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (defendant must show that the \u201cgovernment acted with\n\nimpropriety\u201d).7 Mr. Evans does not meet this standard because he does not cite any evidence that\n\nthe government intentionally or recklessly delayed charging him.\n\n         Furthermore, Mr. Evans has not established that the pre-indictment delay resulted in the\n\nloss of any key exculpatory evidence. In insisting that he has, in fact, suffered actual prejudice,\n\n\n7\n  The defense urges the Court that the due process inquiry requires only the lesser standard laid out by the Eleventh\nCircuit in United States v. Foxman, 87 F.3d 1220, 1223 n.2 (11th Cir. 1996) (\u201cintentional government acts designed\nto obtain a tactical advantage which only incidentally cause delay have never been ruled out as a potential basis for\n\n                                                         14\n\fhe points to three pieces of evidence no longer available to him allegedly due to the delay: (1) the\n\nSUV, (2) an \u201cexculpatory witness\u201d whose memory has since faded, and (3) another \u201cexculpatory\n\nwitness\u201d who died prior to the government bringing charges. Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 2. In his reply,\n\nMr. Evans avers more allegedly exculpatory evidence that is no longer available, such as bank\n\nrecords, another witness, and a phone.8 Def.\u2019s Reply to Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to R. 48 Mot. at 6\u20137.\n\n         Mr. Evans\u2019s objections about the lost physical evidence do not establish actual prejudice.\n\nAs discussed above, returning the SUV to its rightful owner did not deprive Mr. Evans of the\n\nopportunity to interrogate the government\u2019s reports, photographs, and testing of the SUV. And\n\nhe has not explained how the other physical evidence identified in his reply actually prejudiced\n\nhis defense beyond mere\u2014impermissible\u2014speculation. See United States v. Burnett, 827 F.3d\n\n1108, 1116 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (\u201cNot only ha[s] the defendant[] failed to prove bad faith, [he] also\n\nha[s] advanced no credible argument that the [lost] evidence was potentially exculpatory, which\n\nis a separate requirement to succeed on this kind of due process claim.\u201d) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).\n\n         His arguments with respect to the witnesses are similarly unavailing. Mr. Evans argues\n\nthat he was prejudiced because Witness-3, who in 2009 gave law enforcement a physical\n\ndescription of an individual fleeing the SUV that \u201cdiffered from Mr. Evans in significant\n\nrespects,\u201d now can no longer recall what the suspect looked like. Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 17. As the\n\nCircuit has made clear, \u201c[m]emories inevitably dim with the passage of time\u201d and thus faded\n\n\ndue process violations\u201d). See Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 21. Mr. Evans counsels that this Court ought to follow that\nstandard because \u201c[t]he Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion has since been cited by a trial court in this circuit.\u201d Id. at 20.\nWhile it is true that United States v. Brodie, 326 F. Supp. 2d 83, 87 (D.D.C. 2004), cited Foxman, the court did so\nafter laying out the correct standard\u2014intentional delay and actual prejudice\u2014and declined to endorse the language\nin Foxman leaving open the possibility that incidental delays could create due process violations.\n8\n  At the November 7 motions hearing, counsel for Mr. Evans argued that more potentially exculpatory evidence\u2014in\nthe form of cell site records\u2014is similarly unavailable. Because this argument was not raised in Mr. Evans\u2019s filings,\nit will not be considered. See United States ex rel. Davis v. District of Columbia, 793 F.3d 120, 127 (D.C. Cir.\n2015).\n\n                                                         15\n\fmemories, standing alone, are not sufficient to show prejudice. United States v. Bridgeman, 523\n\nF.2d 1099, 1112 (D.C. Cir. 1975). Even so, as the government points out, Witness-3 spoke with\n\nlaw enforcement several times during the course of the investigation and those statements may\n\nvery well be admissible.9 See Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 37\u201338.\n\n         In addition, the Court is skeptical that the purportedly exculpatory witness who is now\n\ndeceased, Scorpio Phillips, would actually have been an exculpatory witness. Phillips, the\n\nsuspected driver of the SUV, spoke to law enforcement in 2014 but denied knowledge of or\n\ninvolvement in Mr. Ware\u2019s death. See id. at 39. This is a far cry from exculpatory statements for\n\nMr. Evans. Mr. Evans replies that Phillips may still have helped his defense by contradicting\n\ntestimony of Witness-8, a key government witness. See Def.\u2019s Reply to Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R.\n\n48 Mot. at 5\u20136. But, as the government correctly notes, had Phillips survived until the time that\n\nthe government brought charges related to Mr. Ware\u2019s death, Phillips could very well have faced\n\npotential charges of his own. Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 39\u201340. Furthermore, Mr.\n\nEvans\u2019s assumption that Phillips would have testified on his behalf ignores both the significant\n\nself-incrimination risk Phillips would have faced by testifying and his ability to exercise his Fifth\n\nAmendment right against self-incrimination. Id. Regardless, \u201c[t]he death of a witness, however,\n\nis not an occasion to dismiss [indictments] on the basis of speculation about what the lost\n\nevidence might have suggested.\u201d In Re Sealed Case, 494 F.3d 139, 151 (D.C. Cir. 2007).\n\n\n\n\n9\n  Similarly, Mr. Evans\u2019s case citations finding a due process violation based on witness unavailability miss the mark.\nAll of the cases he cites involved situations where the defendant was unable to produce any witness in his defense,\nwhich is plainly not the case here. See Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot. at 17, 19; United States v. Santiago, 987 F. Supp. 2d 465,\n485 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (one of the other two alleged shooters (besides the defendant) was unavailable to testify and\nthe other shooter had invoked their right not testify); United States v. Sabath, 990 F. Supp. 1007, 1012 (N.D. Il.\n1998) (\u201csole witness\u201d no longer had an independent recollection of the key events of the night); United States v.\nBarket, 530 F.2d 189, 196 (8th Cir. 1976) (all potentially exculpatory witnesses were \u201cdead or unable to recall\ncircumstances that existed more than five years ago\u201d).\n\n                                                         16\n\f       Finally, the inability to locate Witness-4, who Mr. Evans argues would contradict\n\ntestimony from key government witnesses, see Def.\u2019s Reply to Gov\u2019t Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s R. 48 Mot.\n\nat 7, does not establish prejudice. See United States v. Jones, 524 F.2d 834, 844 (D.C. Cir. 1975)\n\n(\u201cprejudice is not satisfied by\u201d \u201cthe slender hope that a witness, now unavailable, might have\n\nbeen able to come forth with testimony favorable to the defense\u201d) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).\n\n                                                   * **\n\n       Mr. Evans has not met his burdens to convince this Court that the government violated\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 or his rights under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process\n\nClause.
