Section 1983 lawsuits can raise\nhard questions about whether misconduct constitutes state or\nprivate action. While the wrongdoing alleged here is plenty\ndisturbing, we \ufb01nd the line drawing more straightforward.\nKylie DiDonato was seriously injured when she fell and hit\nher head in Tim Panatera\u2019s bathroom. DiDonato later invoked\n\u00a7 1983 and alleged that Panatera\u2014a City of Chicago para-\nmedic\u2014shirked his responsibility to treat her and instead saw\n\f2                                                 No. 20-1692\n\nher weakened state as an opportunity to sexually assault her.\nShe contended that this inaction by someone acting under\n\u201ccolor of state law\u201d violated her rights under the U.S. Consti-\ntution. The district court recognized the gravity of Panatera\u2019s\nalleged misconduct, but rightly concluded that DiDonato\nfailed to plead facts showing that Panatera was acting in his\ncapacity as a City paramedic for purposes of a \u00a7 1983 claim.\nWe a\ufb03rm.\n                               I\n    Kylie DiDonato slipped, fell, and seriously injured her\nhead on a bathtub in Tim Panatera\u2019s home in March 2018. Pan-\natera found DiDonato disoriented and badly bleeding on the\nbathroom \ufb02oor. But rather than calling 911, driving DiDonato\nto the hospital himself, or drawing upon his training as a par-\namedic to treat her, Panatera allegedly did no more than rinse\nthe blood from DiDonato\u2019s head and wrap it in a towel. From\nthere, DiDonato contends, Panatera moved her to his bed and\nsexually assaulted her as she drifted in and out of conscious-\nness. When DiDonato regained consciousness the next after-\nnoon, Panatera drove her home and then reported to work.\n   With the help of a friend, DiDonato made her way to an\nemergency room later that day. The ER team sutured her head\nwounds and informed her that she had sustained head\ntrauma and a concussion.\n   A few months later DiDonato \ufb01led this lawsuit and, in an\namended complaint, added a \u00a7 1983 claim against Panatera.\nShe alleged that Panatera, as a licensed paramedic, violated\nher rights under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process\nClause by failing to provide medical care after her fall. She\n\fNo. 20-1692                                                    3\n\nalso brought a host of state law claims, including for assault,\nbattery, and negligence.\n    The district court dismissed DiDonato\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim for\ntwo interrelated reasons. First, the court explained that, under\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in DeShaney v. Winnebago\nCounty Department of Social Services and related cases, Di-\nDonato had to allege that a state actor failed to adhere to a\nduty to protect and care for a person with whom the state had\na \u201cspecial relationship.\u201d 489 U.S. 189, 200\u201302 (1989). The clas-\nsic example is a prisoner: the state owes those in its custody\nphysical protection and medical care. See, e.g., Estelle v. Gam-\nble, 429 U.S. 97, 103\u201304 (1976). But, the district court contin-\nued, states (and municipalities like the City of Chicago here)\nare not in a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with all residents and thus\ndo not shoulder a constitutional duty to provide medical care\nto anyone needing help. Applying those principles led the dis-\ntrict court to conclude that DiDonato failed to allege facts nec-\nessary to show the City\u2014through one of its o\ufb00-duty para-\nmedics\u2014had a constitutional obligation to protect and care\nfor her following her fall. What was lacking, the district court\nemphasized, was any allegation that DiDonato, as a func-\ntional matter, was ever in the City\u2019s care or custody.\n   Second, and relatedly, the district court concluded that Di-\nDonato failed to plausibly allege that Panatera acted \u201cunder\ncolor of state law\u201d on the night in question. Section 1983, the\ncourt explained, does not cover disputes between private cit-\nizens, and an individual\u2019s employment by the state does not\nrender any and all action by that person state action. To be\nsure, the district court acknowledged that some steps Pan-\natera took may have amounted to medical care, such as wrap-\nping DiDonato\u2019s head in a towel. But the district court\n\f4                                                    No. 20-1692\n\ndetermined that the necessary state action inquiry could not\nproceed at that level of generality. Instead, the analysis\nneeded to account for the context in which DiDonato\u2019s need\nfor help and medical care arose\u2014an entirely private interac-\ntion between Panatera and DiDonato within his home. The al-\nleged facts, in short, did not permit a plausible \ufb01nding that\nPanatera failed to perform any o\ufb03cial duty as a licensed par-\namedic.\n   Having dismissed DiDonato\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim, the district\ncourt then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\nthe remaining state law claims.\n    DiDonato now appeals.\n                                II\n                                A\n    A plainti\ufb00 may hold a public o\ufb03cial personally liable for\nmisconduct under \u00a7 1983 upon satisfying two \u201cessential ele-\nments.\u201d Yang v. Hardin, 37 F.3d 282, 284 (7th Cir. 1994). First,\nthe challenged conduct must have been \u201ccommitted by a per-\nson acting under color of state law\u201d\u2014a requirement coming\ndirectly from \u00a7 1983\u2019s text. Id. Second, the state actor\u2019s conduct\nmust have deprived the plainti\ufb00 of \u201crights, privileges, or im-\nmunities secured by the Constitution\u201d or federal law. 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1983; see also Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U.S. 158, 161 (1992)\n(\u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 1983 is to deter state actors from using the\nbadge of their authority to deprive individuals of their feder-\nally guaranteed rights and to provide relief to victims if such\ndeterrence fails.\u201d).\n   The traditional understanding of what it means for an of-\n\ufb01cial to act \u201cunder color of state law\u201d encompasses miscon-\nduct by o\ufb03cials exercising power \u201cpossessed by virtue of\n\fNo. 20-1692                                                       5\n\nstate law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is\nclothed with the authority of state law.\u201d West v. Atkins, 487\nU.S. 42, 49 (1988) (citation omitted). Indeed, it is \u201c\ufb01rmly estab-\nlished\u201d that a \u00a7 1983 defendant acts \u201cunder color of state law\nwhen he abuses the position given to him by the State.\u201d Id. at\n49\u201350.\n    But it is equally well settled that a \u201cmere assertion that one\nis a state o\ufb03cer does not necessarily mean that one acts under\ncolor of state law.\u201d Gibson v. City of Chicago, 910 F.2d 1510,\n1516 (7th Cir. 1990); see also Wilson v. Price, 624 F.3d 389, 392\n(7th Cir. 2010) (\u201cNot every action by a state o\ufb03cial or em-\nployee is to be deemed as occurring \u2018under color\u2019 of state\nlaw.\u201d) (citation omitted). Nor is it dispositive whether the\nstate employee was on- or o\ufb00-duty at the time the incident\noccurred. See, e.g., Briscoe v. LaHue, 663 F.2d 713, 721 n.4 (7th\nCir. 1981) (\u201c[A]cts committed by a police o\ufb03cer even while on\nduty and in uniform are not under color of state law unless\nthey are in some way \u2018related to the performance of police du-\nties.\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); see also Pickrel v. City of Spring\ufb01eld,\n45 F.3d 1115, 1118\u201319 (7th Cir. 1995) (collecting cases conclud-\ning that o\ufb00-duty o\ufb03cers were nonetheless acting under color\nof state law in particular circumstances). Whether an individ-\nual is acting under color of state law \u201cturn[s] largely on the\nnature of the speci\ufb01c acts\u201d the o\ufb03cial performed, \u201crather than\non merely whether he was actively assigned at the moment\u201d\nto the performance of his o\ufb03cial duties. Pickrel, 45 F.3d at\n1118.\n   Our case law illustrates the necessity of a rigorous fact-\nbound inquiry. Take, for example, our decision in Pickrel.\nCrystal Pickrel alleged that an o\ufb00-duty o\ufb03cer acted under\ncolor of state law by informing her she was under arrest,\n\f6                                                 No. 20-1692\n\nthrowing her to the ground, and putting her in handcu\ufb00s. See\nid. at 1117. We concluded Pickrel had pled enough to survive\na motion to dismiss based on her allegations that the o\ufb03cer\nwas wearing his police uniform, complete with badge and\ngun, and driving his marked squad car at the time of their en-\ncounter. See id. at 1116\u201318 (emphasizing that the uniform and\nbadge were both \u201csigns of state authority,\u201d the gun enabled\nthe o\ufb03cer to \u201cenforce his authority,\u201d and the squad car \u201cad-\nvertis[ed] the presence of a police o\ufb03cer\u201d to those present).\n    We adhered to similar reasoning in Lopez v. Vanderwater,\n620 F.2d 1229 (7th Cir. 1980). Flor Lopez brought a \u00a7 1983 suit\nagainst a state court judge who detained him at gunpoint, in-\nitiated charges for petty theft, convicted him on an allegedly\nforged guilty plea, and sentenced him to eight months in jail.\nSee id. at 1231\u201333. Though then-Judge Vanderwater over-\nstepped the bounds of his state-granted authority, we con-\ncluded his actions were taken under color of state law. \u201cAction\ntaken by a state o\ufb03cial who is cloaked with o\ufb03cial power and\nwho purports to be acting under color of o\ufb03cial right is state\naction,\u201d and the judge was only able to take the constitution-\nally o\ufb00ensive actions he did \u201cbecause he was cloaked with the\no\ufb03ce of the judge.\u201d Id. at 1236\u201337.\n    Where, on the other hand, a plainti\ufb00 does not allege that a\npublic o\ufb03cial\u2019s actions involved some inappropriate invoca-\ntion or exercise of state authority, there is no \u00a7 1983 claim.\nAnd that is so, our cases demonstrate, even if the alleged con-\nduct resembles job-related tasks the o\ufb03cial performs at the\nstate\u2019s behest. We saw this in Barnes v. City of Centralia. 943\nF.3d 826 (7th Cir. 2019). A police o\ufb03cer reported credible\nthreats made against him and his family to a state prosecutor,\nand the prosecutor decided to press charges against the\n\fNo. 20-1692                                                       7\n\nindividual involved. See id. at 829\u201330. After the charges were\ndropped, the individual brought a \u00a7 1983 case against the of-\n\ufb01cer. We explained that although the interaction that led to\nthe plainti\ufb00\u2019s arrest \u201coccurred during [the defendant\u2019s] em-\nployment\u201d as a police o\ufb03cer, the o\ufb03cer acted as a private cit-\nizen when he lodged his complaint with the prosecutor, \u201cnot\nas an investigating o\ufb03cer.\u201d Id. at 831. His report was therefore\n\u201ca private act that did not involve any exercise of state author-\nity.\u201d Id.\n    Similarly, in Hughes v. Meyer, we concluded that a Wiscon-\nsin game warden who reported threatening conduct to law\nenforcement was \u201cfunctionally equivalent to . . . any private\ncitizen\u201d making a police report\u2014and, critically, his \u201cstatus as\na DNR o\ufb03cial did not clothe him with greater authority\u201d in\nthat act \u201cthan any other citizen would possess.\u201d 880 F.2d 967,\n972 (7th Cir. 1989).\n    Considered together, these cases supply the principles\nthat resolve this appeal. To plead that a defendant acted un-\nder color of state law, a \u00a7 1983 plainti\ufb00 must allege that a de-\nfendant\u2019s invocation of state authority in one way or another\nfacilitated or enabled the alleged misconduct. That the de-\nfendant is a state employee is not enough. \u201c[S]tate o\ufb03cials or\nemployees who act without the cloth of state authority do not\nsubject themselves to \u00a7 1983 suits.\u201d Id. at 971; see also, e.g., La-\ntuszkin v. City of Chicago, 250 F.3d 502, 506 (7th Cir. 2001) (af-\n\ufb01rming dismissal of a \u00a7 1983 claim brought against an intoxi-\ncated o\ufb00-duty police o\ufb03cer who struck and killed a pedes-\ntrian in his private vehicle because the plainti\ufb00 did not allege\nthat the o\ufb03cer was \u201cengaged in police activity, that he dis-\nplayed any police power, or that he possessed any indicia of\nhis o\ufb03ce at the time of the accident\u201d).\n\f8                                                  No. 20-1692\n\n                               B\n    The district court applied these exact principles and deter-\nmined that DiDonato failed to allege that Panatera acted un-\nder color of state law. We reach the same conclusion after tak-\ning our own independent look at the allegations in Di-\nDonato\u2019s second amended complaint. See, e.g., Bilek v. Fed. Ins.\nCo., 8 F.4th 581, 586 (7th Cir. 2021) (applying de novo review\nto a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal).\n    DiDonato alleged Panatera was acting \u201c[i]n performance\nof his o\ufb03cial duties\u201d as a trained paramedic when he \u201cpicked\n[her] o\ufb00 the \ufb02oor, placed her in his bathtub,\u201d \u201crinsed blood\nfrom her head and body\u201d and \u201cwrapped [her] head with a\nnon-sterile bathroom towel.\u201d But what the rest of the com-\nplaint makes clear is fatal to DiDonato\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim: the\nevents in question all occurred in the privacy of Panatera\u2019s\nhome and, more importantly, in the context of DiDonato and\nPanatera\u2019s personal relationship.\n    Panatera\u2019s alleged attempts to slow or stem DiDonato\u2019s\nbleeding certainly relate to the duties he performs as a para-\nmedic\u2014no doubt he routinely treats head and other super\ufb01-\ncial wounds while responding to 911 calls. And Panatera was\nmore able to respond to DiDonato\u2019s injuries than someone\nwithout medical training. His professional background leaves\nmore room for criticism of the adequacy of Panatera\u2019s re-\nsponse and the wisdom of his decision making, and perhaps\nleaves him exposed to liability for negligence under state law.\n   But the mere overlap between Panatera\u2019s routine job re-\nsponsibilities and the conduct DiDonato complained of does\nnot mean that Panatera acted under color of state law when\nhe decided not to take DiDonato to the emergency room or to\n\fNo. 20-1692                                                    9\n\nprovide other medical help. What is missing from DiDonato\u2019s\ncomplaint is any plausible allegation either that Panatera\u2019s ac-\ntion or inaction was a misuse of the City\u2019s power or that his\nwrongdoing was made possible because he was \u201cclothed with\nthe authority of state law.\u201d Barnes, 943 F.3d at 831 (citation\nomitted). Panatera was not dispatched to the scene to tend to\nDiDonato\u2019s injuries in his role as a City paramedic. Nor did\nhe invoke his authority to interfere with someone else\u2019s at-\ntempt to treat her wounds. Common decency, not his employ-\nment status, demanded Panatera take some steps to stop Di-\nDonato\u2019s bleeding. And it was Panatera\u2019s alleged self-serving\nopportunism, not an exercise of state authority, that pre-\nvented DiDonato from leaving his home and seeking further\ncare.\n    DiDonato urges a di\ufb00erent conclusion by focusing on a\nparticular detail alleged in her complaint\u2014that Panatera was\n\u201con call\u201d as a paramedic on March 19 and took at least one\nphone call from a work colleague before he drove her home.\nBut that contention, which we accept as true, does not change\nour analysis. DiDonato\u2019s complaint still lacks any allegation\nthat Panatera\u2019s alleged misconduct toward her was facilitated\nby a misuse of state power or involved an invocation of state\nauthority. See, e.g., Luce v. Town of Campbell, 872 F.3d 512, 514\n(7th Cir. 2017) (concluding that a public o\ufb03cial who made de-\nfamatory posts about the plainti\ufb00 and who \u201cdid some of the\ndirty work while on duty\u201d using o\ufb03ce equipment did not act\nunder color of state law).\n    DiDonato\u2019s complaint describes behavior that, while ab-\nhorrent, was \u201cwholly unconnected\u201d to Panatera\u2019s employ-\nment. First Midwest Bank v. City of Chicago, 988 F.3d 978, 987\n(7th Cir. 2021). DiDonato and Panatera did not encounter each\n\f10                                                  No. 20-1692\n\nother as paramedic and patient, but as private persons to-\ngether in Panatera\u2019s home. Panatera\u2019s \u201cactions were those of\na private citizen in the course of a purely private social inter-\naction.\u201d Id. Any action or inaction was not under color of state\nlaw.\n    Because we agree with the district court that DiDonato\nfailed to allege that Panatera acted under color of state law,\nwe need not immerse ourselves in any aspect of the court\u2019s\nreasoning under DeShaney. We instead stop on the state action\npoint and AFFIRM the dismissal of DiDonato\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim.\n\f",
