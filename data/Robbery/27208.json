Elders,\n\n192 N.J. 224, 243 (2007) (quoting State v. Elders, 386 N.J. Super. 208, 228\n\n(App. Div. 2006)). Those facts found credible by the motion judge from the\n\n\n\n2\n  Defendant was sentenced to a concurrent five-year term for third-degree theft,\nN.J.S.A. 2C:20-3(a), charged in a separate indictment, after pleading guilty to a\nviolation of probation (VOP).\n                                                                         A-5799-17T4\n                                       3\n\ftestimony of the officer at the suppression hearing reveal the officer was on\n\npatrol at approximately 9:20 p.m. on a mid-August evening when he heard \"two\n\nloud pops\" which he \"immediately recognized\" as gunshots. About thirty to\n\nsixty seconds after he heard the shots, as he proceeded in his unmarked police\n\ncar to the area approximately two blocks west of his position from whence the\n\nsound of the shots came, he saw defendant walking out of a backyard and cross\n\ndirectly in front of the officer's vehicle.\n\n      Defendant was immediately recognizable to the officer from previous\n\ninvestigations, and from encounters with defendant who had been previously\n\nfired upon thrice. The officer knew defendant to be affiliated with the Bloods\n\nand that his street name was \"Balie.\" The officer \"slowed his vehicle and called\n\n. . . defendant by [his given] name,\" whereupon defendant looked at the officer\n\n\"and immediately began to flee while clutching at his waistband.\"\n\n      The officer exited his vehicle and gave serpentine chase to defendant,\n\n\"repeatedly shout[ing] out commands to . . . defendant, by name, . . . directing\n\nhim to [']stop, police['], in a loud, clear voice.\" As defendant ran, the officer\n\nobserved from a distance of five to ten yards in a \"lightly illuminated\" backyard,\n\nthe silhouette of defendant's right hand motioning toward the ground and \"heard\n\na thud, consistent with something heavy landing on the ground.\"\n\n\n                                                                          A-5799-17T4\n                                          4\n\f      Within five minutes, the officer lost sight of defendant and returned to the\n\narea where he heard the thud; there he located the handgun which defendant was\n\ncharged with possessing.\n\n      We defer to the motion judge's findings, especially because they \"are\n\nsubstantially influenced by [the judge's] opportunity to hear and see the\n\nwitnesses and to have the 'feel' of the case, which a reviewing court cannot\n\nenjoy.\" State v. Locurto, 157 N.J. 463, 471 (1999) (quoting State v. Johnson,\n\n42 N.J. 146, 161 (1964)). The motion judge's application of his factual findings\n\nto the law, however, is subject to plenary review. State v. Cryan, 320 N.J. Super.\n\n325, 328 (App. Div. 1999).\n\n      Defendant's present contention that the motion judge \"incorrectly assumed\n\nthat the stop and seizure of [defendant] did not occur until after the police officer\n\nbegan to chase him on foot rather than when the police officer first confronted\n\n[defendant] from his motor vehicle\" is at odds with the motion judge's\n\nperception, \"[b]ased on the submissions of both parties['] counsel . . . that the\n\nseizure occurred when [the officer] began chasing . . . defendant.\" We were not\n\nprovided with those submissions. See R. 2:6-1(a)(2). As such, we do not know\n\nwhat defendant contended therein. But if the motion judge correctly explained\n\ndefendant's position\u2014and we have no reason to doubt he did, especially\n\n\n                                                                             A-5799-17T4\n                                         5\n\fconsidering defendant did not deny that position in his merits brief\u2014the\n\nconcession that the stop did not occur until the officer gave chase amounts to\n\ninvited error which bars a party from taking a position on appeal contrary to a\n\nposition advanced to the motion judge. See State v. Pontery, 19 N.J. 457, 471\n\n(1955). \"Elementary justice in reviewing the action of a [motion judge] requires\n\nthat [the judge] should not be reversed for an error committed at the instance of\n\n[the] party alleging it.\" State v. Scioscia, 200 N.J. Super. 28, 47 (App. Div.\n\n1985) (third alteration in original) (quoting Bahrey v. Poniatishin, 95 N.J.L. 128,\n\n133 (E. & A. 1920)).\n\n      Nonetheless, we find no such error was committed by the motion judge.\n\n\"A 'field inquiry' is the least intrusive\" form of police encounter, occurring\n\n\"when a police officer approaches an individual and asks 'if [the person] is\n\nwilling to answer some questions.'\" State v. Pineiro, 181 N.J. 13, 20 (2004)\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting State v. Nishina, 175 N.J. 502, 510 (2003)). \"[A]\n\nfield [inquiry] is not a Fourth Amendment event 'so long as the officer does not\n\ndeny the individual the right to move.'\" State v. Egan, 325 N.J. Super. 402, 409\n\n(Law Div. 1999) (quoting State v. Sheffield, 62 N.J. 441, 447 (1973)); see also\n\nState v. Rosario, 229 N.J. 263, 273-74 (2017) (citing Egan favorably). The\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           A-5799-17T4\n                                        6\n\fofficer is permitted to ask questions during the field inquiry as long as they are\n\nnot \"harassing, overbearing, or accusatory in nature.\" Nishina, 175 N.J. at 510.\n\n      By contrast, an investigatory stop, familiarly known as a Terry stop,\n\noccurs when police detain a person who would not reasonably feel free to leave,\n\neven though the encounter falls short of a formal arrest. State v. Stovall, 170\n\nN.J. 346, 355-56 (2002); see also Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968). Under\n\nTerry, a police officer can detain an individual for a brief period, if the stop \"is\n\nbased on 'specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational\n\ninferences from those facts,' give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal\n\nactivity.\" State v. Rodriguez, 172 N.J. 117, 126-27 (2002) (quoting Terry, 392\n\nU.S. at 21). Under this standard, \"[a]n investigatory stop is valid only if the\n\nofficer has a 'particularized suspicion' based upon an objective observation that\n\nthe person stopped has been [engaged] or is about to engage in criminal\n\nwrongdoing.\" State v. Davis, 104 N.J. 490, 504 (1986).\n\n      Applying these principles and our standard of review, we discern no basis\n\nfor disturbing the motion judge's determination that the stop and subsequent\n\nsearch were valid. By calling defendant's name, the officer did not conduct an\n\ninvestigatory stop. Indeed, although his clear purpose was to inquire about\n\ndefendant's knowledge, if any, about the gunshots, the officer did not even have\n\n\n                                                                            A-5799-17T4\n                                         7\n\fan opportunity to pose a question to defendant before he ran.        Obviously,\n\ndefendant did not feel compelled to remain at the location. See Rosario, 229\n\nN.J. at 271-72 (\"The test of a field inquiry is 'whether [a] defendant, under all\n\nof the attendant circumstances, reasonably believed he [or she] could walk away\n\nwithout answering any of [the officer's] questions.\" (first and third alterations\n\nin original) (quoting State v. Maryland, 167 N.J. 471, 483 (2001))). To that\n\npoint in time, the encounter was no more than a field inquiry.\n\n      That inquiry quickly escalated to a Terry stop when the officer gave chase,\n\nannounced he was a police officer\u2014a status evidenced by the officer's neck-\n\nworn badge and top with \"police\" emblazoned in large silver lettering on front\n\nand back\u2014and commanded him to stop. See State v. Tucker, 136 N.J. 158, 166\n\n(1994) (holding an investigatory stop occurs when police officers chase a\n\nsuspect and, under the totality of the circumstances, \"the police conduct would\n\nhave communicated to a reasonable person that the person was not free to\n\ndecline the officers' requests or otherwise terminate the encounter\" (quoting\n\nFlorida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 439 (1991))). We agree that defendant's flight\n\nalone did not justify a Terry stop. State v. Williams, 410 N.J. Super. 549, 555\n\n(App. Div. 2009).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         A-5799-17T4\n                                       8\n\f      \"However, flight 'in combination with other circumstances . . . may\n\nsupport [the] reasonable and articulable suspicion' required to justify a stop.\"\n\nIbid. (alterations in original) (quoting Pineiro, 181 N.J. at 26); see also State v.\n\nCitarella, 154 N.J. 272, 281 (1998) (recognizing flight as one factor justifying\n\npolice chase of a bike rider who was a known narcotics offender acting\n\nsuspiciously); State v. Morrison, 322 N.J. Super. 147, 155-56 (App. Div. 1999)\n\n(upholding the stop of a fleeing suspect based upon high-narcotics area and\n\nresident complaints of his involvement in drug sales); State v. Ruiz, 286 N.J.\n\nSuper. 155, 163 (App. Div. 1995) (holding the stop of a fleeing suspect was\n\njustified based upon prior arrests and suspicious conduct).\n\n      Unlike the defendant in Tucker, who was observed by police simply\n\nsitting on a curb before he fled, was chased and stopped, 136 N.J. at 161-62, the\n\ntotality of the circumstances justified the officer's pursuit of defendant. The stop\n\nbegan only after defendant ran and immediately clutched at his waistband,\n\nsignaling to the officer that defendant was armed with a weapon. As the officer\n\ntestified, based on his training and experience, \"[s]ubjects who carry firearms\n\ntypically keep them in their waistband area or conceal them in their waistband\n\narea rather.\" That the clutching may have been unrelated to defendant's attempt\n\nto retain a firearm does not discount the officer's reasonable suspicion.\n\n\n                                                                            A-5799-17T4\n                                         9\n\f             In evaluating the facts giving rise to the officer's\n             suspicion of criminal activity, courts are to give weight\n             to \"the officer's knowledge and experience\" as well as\n             \"rational inferences that could be drawn from the facts\n             objectively and reasonably viewed in light of the\n             officer's expertise.\" The fact that purely innocent\n             connotations can be ascribed to a person's actions does\n             not mean that an officer cannot base a finding of\n             reasonable suspicion on those actions as long as \"a\n             reasonable person would find the actions are consistent\n             with guilt.\"\n\n             [Citarella, 154 N.J. at 279-80 (quoting State v. Arthur,\n             149 N.J. 1, 10-11 (1997)).]\n\nDefendant's actions, combined with his proximity to the area in which the\n\ngunshots were heard shortly after the gunfire, and his prior involvement as the\n\ntarget of shootings, justified the investigatory stop. 3\n\n      The motion judge likened the circumstances of this stop to those in State\n\nv. Dunbar, 434 N.J. Super. 522 (App. Div. 2014), where we determined an\n\ninvestigatory stop was justified when officers, who \"arrived within moments of\n\nthe report of shots being fired,\" observed a nervous defendant duck into an alley,\n\n\n\n3\n    Defendant contends the motion judge incorrectly found defendant was a\n\"defendant in . . . weapon and shooting investigations,\" and not the target of\nsame. We do not agree with that interpretation. Viewing the entirety of the\njudge's oral opinion, we understand the judge meant the officer knew defendant\nas a victim of prior shootings and as a defendant in cases relating to drugs and\ncriminal trespass. In any event, we consider only that the officer knew defendant\nin that light, not as a person who had been previously arrested on gun charges.\n                                                                          A-5799-17T4\n                                        10\n\fbegan to walk away \"while looking over his shoulder at\" police, did not respond\n\nwhen an officer attempted to speak to him and, instead, ran, id. at 527-28. We\n\nagree that the circumstances here similarly justified the stop. And, as we did in\n\nDunbar, we observe defendant discarded the handgun as he \"ignored the police\n\ndirective to stop and was attempting to flee the scene,\" and that the police \"had\n\nreason to fear that the suspect might be armed.\"          Id. at 528.    To those\n\ncircumstances, we add defendant in this case had a known gang affiliation and\n\nconcomitant reputation for carrying handguns.\n\n       Inasmuch as both the officer's attempted initial inquiry and investigatory\n\nstop fell within the delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement, Maryland,\n\n167 N.J. at 482; Pineiro, 181 N.J. at 19-21, the seizure of the handgun was\n\nconstitutionally permissible, and the motion to suppress was properly denied. 4\n\n                                        II.\n\n       Defendant argues the officer's lay opinion linking the thud he heard to the\n\nhandgun he found did not meet the requirements of N.J.R.E. 701 and should\n\nhave also been excluded under N.J.R.E. 403(a). He adds, the officer's testimony\n\nthat defendant's extension of his right arm as he ran suggested to the officer that\n\ndefendant \"was discarding something in a discrete manner,\" was also\n\n\n4\n    The issue of abandonment of the handgun was not raised on appeal.\n                                                                           A-5799-17T4\n                                       11\n\finadmissible lay opinion. Defendant also avers the officer's testimony that\n\nnothing else on the ground in the area where the handgun was found could have\n\nmade that sound was, likewise, inadmissible lay opinion.\n\n      The officer described to the jury his observation of defendant's arm motion\n\nas he ran, extending \"to the side of his body towards the ground, so his right arm\n\nbasically just went into a straight extension\" \"at which point [the officer] heard\n\na loud thud on the ground as if a heavy object just fell into the ground.\" He\n\nexplained that arm angle was different from the angle defendant had otherwise\n\nassumed as he ran\u2014with his arms \"slightly bent at the elbow\"\u2014and provided\n\nthe jury with a demonstration of the difference between that angle and the\n\ndefendant's arm \"fully extended facing the direction of the ground.\"\n\n      The officer later testified that other items\u2014small branches, small rocks,\n\nleaves, small shreds of wood and an empty fifteen- or twenty-gallon plastic\n\nbin\u2014he observed on the ground near the handgun, and which were depicted in\n\nphotographs of that area posted to the jury could not have made the \"thud\" he\n\nheard.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          A-5799-17T4\n                                       12\n\f      Defendant did not interpose an objection under either N.J.R.E. 701 or\n\nN.J.R.E. 403(a). 5 Unless defendant timely made the \"objection to admission\n\nknown to the trial court, the reviewing court will review for plain error, only\n\nreversing if the error is 'clearly capable of producing an unjust result.'\" State v.\n\nRose, 206 N.J. 141, 157 (2011) (quoting R. 2:10-2). \"Under that standard,\n\ndefendant has the burden of proving that the error was clear and obvious and\n\nthat it affected his substantial rights.\" State v. Morton, 155 N.J. 383, 421 (1998).\n\n      Most of the officer's testimony centered on his perceptions; those were not\n\nlay opinions. The description of defendant's arm motion described defendant's\n\nactions at the point the officer heard the \"thud\" that caused him to return to the\n\narea where he found the handgun. His description that it was \"a loud thud\" and\n\nthat \"[i]t was a heavy object that hit the ground\" cannot be viewed as anything\n\n\n\n\n5\n  When the assistant prosecutor asked, \"What if anything did [defendant's arm]\nmotion suggest to you?\" defendant objected that it \"calls for speculation\"; the\nobjection was overruled. Defendant also objected twice that the assistant\nprosecutor asked questions calling for an expert opinion. The first objection\nwas followed by a sidebar, whereafter the assistant prosecutor rephrased the\nquestion and asked the officer if \"there [was] anything else on the ground in that\narea that could have made the ['thud'] noise\" the officer heard; no objection was\nmade to that question and answer. Defendant made the same objection when the\nassistant prosecutor asked if any other items on the ground could have made the\n\"thud\"; that objection was overruled.\n                                                                            A-5799-17T4\n                                        13\n\fbut the officer's recount of what his senses perceived. The same holds true for\n\nthe officer's description of the defendant's arm movement.\n\n      Even if the descriptions included lay opinion, they were admissible, as\n\nwas the officer's testimony that there was nothing else on the ground that could\n\nhave made the \"thud.\" Lay opinion is admissible under N.J.R.E. 701 which\n\nprovides:\n\n\n            If a witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness'\n            testimony in the form of opinions or inferences may be\n            admitted if it (a) is rationally based on the perception\n            of the witness and (b) will assist in understanding the\n            witness' testimony or in determining a fact in issue.\n\n\n\n      \"Lay opinion testimony, therefore, when offered . . . in criminal\n\nprosecutions, can only be admitted if it falls within the narrow bounds of\n\ntestimony that is based on the perception of the witness and that will assist the\n\njury in performing its function.\" State v. McLean, 205 N.J. 438, 456\n\n(2011). \"The witness's perception must 'rest[] on the acquisition of knowledge\n\nthrough use of one's sense of touch, taste, sight, smell or hearing.'\" State v.\n\nHyman, 451 N.J. Super. 429, 442 (App. Div. 2017) (alteration in original)\n\n(quoting McLean, 205 N.J. at 457). Further, lay opinions \"may not intrude on\n\nthe province of the jury by offering, in the guise of opinions, views on the\n\n                                                                         A-5799-17T4\n                                      14\n\fmeaning of facts that the jury is fully able to sort out . . . [or] express a view on\n\nthe ultimate question of guilt or innocence.\" McLean, 205 N.J. at 461. Police\n\nofficers are allowed \"to testify as lay witnesses, based on their personal\n\nobservations and their long experience in areas where expert testimony might\n\notherwise be deemed necessary.\" State v. LaBrutto, 114 N.J. 187, 198 (1989).\n\n       The officer had extensive experience in firearms. He testified that he had\n\nbeen a police officer in two municipal departments for about seven years, and\n\nwas previously \"in the military security forces, Air Force.\" He not only received\n\nfirearms training at the police academy and was required to requalify biannually,\n\nhe had participated in over 100 firearms-related investigations and had made\n\ndozens of firearms-related arrests as a police officer. He was thus familiar with\n\nthe heft of handguns. His description of the sound he heard obviously related\n\nto his perception as he chased defendant, satisfying the first prong of N.J.R.E.\n\n701.\n\n       His testimony also assisted the jury in understanding the \"thud\" he heard.\n\nNotwithstanding the photographs of the area, including the other objects on the\n\nground near the handgun, the jury was not present at the scene to visualize the\n\nother debris. The officer's description of the \"thud\" did not impart to the jury\n\nthe volume or timbre of that noise. We see nothing improper about the officer\n\n\n                                                                             A-5799-17T4\n                                        15\n\fdistinguishing the sound he heard from sounds that could be made from the other\n\nitems. The determination that defendant possessed the handgun was left entirely\n\nto the jury which could have rejected the inference that defendant possessed the\n\nhandgun and discarded it during the chase. Thus, the testimony did not intrude\n\non the jury's province or express the officer's view of defendant's guilt. McLean,\n\n205 N.J. at 461.\n\n      The balance of defendant's arguments about the officer's testimony and\n\nthe assistant prosecutor's comments thereon are without sufficient merit to\n\nwarrant discussion. R. 2:11-3(e)(2). Again, defendant did not object that the\n\nevidence should have been excluded on the grounds the probative value of\n\nrelevant evidence was \"substantially outweighed by the risk of (a) undue\n\nprejudice, confusion of issues, or misleading the jury or (b) undue delay, waste\n\nof time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\" N.J.R.E. 403(a).\n\nIndeed, such an objection would have been baseless. The evidence was relevant\n\nand admissible; the assistant prosecutor's comments were within the\n\n\"considerable leeway\" the State's attorney is afforded in opening and closing\n\nstatements. State v. Echols, 199 N.J. 344, 359-60 (2009) (quoting State v.\n\nWilliams, 113 N.J. 393, 447 (1988)). And, neither the admission of the officer's\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          A-5799-17T4\n                                       16\n\ftestimony, nor the assistant prosecutor's comments were \"clearly capable of\n\nproducing an unjust result.\" See Rose, 206 N.J. at 157 (quoting R. 2:10-2).\n\n\n                                           III.\n\n\n      Defendant also contends the trial judge erred in denying his April\n\napplication to:   preclude the State from introducing a conversation among\n\ndefendant, his father and girlfriend recorded when defendant was in the county\n\njail because the State \"flagrantly violated\" the discovery Rule; and, once\n\nadmitted, to redact that recording.\n\n      In denying the motion, the trial judge considered that, when defendant was\n\narraigned in November 2017, the State demanded, pursuant to Rule 3:12-2(a),\n\nthat defendant file a notice of alibi within ten days. Defendant, however, did\n\nnot serve the signed notice until February 2018, after plea cutoff on January 30,\n\n2018; the State received an unsigned notice \"[a]bout a week prior to that[.]\" At\n\noral argument on the motion, defense counsel claimed the tardy service was\n\nunintentional; he was not \"confident providing . . . a[n] alibi defense\" until he\n\ntalked to witnesses, some of which he \"had trouble tracking down[.]\" Upon\n\nreceiving the notice, the State \"launched an investigation\" that led to what the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         A-5799-17T4\n                                      17\n\fState at oral argument termed a \"request\" to the county jail on March 14, 2018; 6\n\nthe State noticed defense counsel of that request. The State forwarded what\n\ndefense counsel described at oral argument as \"697 jail calls . . . rang[ing] from\n\none minute to [fifteen] minutes and, on average, they were ten minutes\" which\n\ncounsel received on April 2, 2018 \"at the earliest[.]\" The State, however,\n\nadvised defense counsel in an email of a narrower focus, and later provided a\n\ntranscript of just one fifteen-minute call that it intended to use.\n\n      The trial judge observed that defendant's notice of alibi was served after\n\nthe plea cutoff, and the State, instead of moving for preclusion of defendant's\n\nalibi proofs, see R. 3:12-2(b), \"conducted an additional investigation,\"\n\nsubpoenaed the phone records \"and provided [them] to the defense as soon as\n\npracticable.\" The judge found \"the State did not sit on this information or . . .\n\nsit on conducting any investigation. [It] acted . . . reasonably promptly as soon\n\nas [it] received the notice of alibi.\"\n\n      The trial judge permitted defendant to interpose an alibi defense despite\n\nhis \"untimely notice to the State\" and permitted the State to introduce the\n\n\n\n\n6\n  In its merits brief, the State averred it sent a grand jury subpoena \"seeking\ndefendant's jail calls to the [county jail].\" The subpoena is not part of the record.\n                                                                             A-5799-17T4\n                                         18\n\frecording of the single phone call \"which the defense . . . had an opportunity to\n\nhear and to review[.]\" The judge found the call\n\n\n            certainly relevant to refute the alibi defense insofar as\n            it appears that the phone call indicates first that --\n            defendant first advises his father that he's at his\n            mother's home and then later on he says, [\"]well, I was\n            actually at the scene but I was running.[\"] That\n            statement coming from . . . defendant's own mouth is\n            probative on the issue of whether or not the defense can\n            sustain its burden on the alibi defense.\n\n\n      We see no abuse of discretion in the trial judge's ruling. State v. Brown,\n\n236 N.J. 497, 522 (2019). Although Rule 3:13-3(b)(1) requires that the State\n\nprovide post-indictment discovery \"upon the return or unsealing of the\n\nindictment,\" the duty to disclose discovery is continuing, R. 3:13-3(f). Trial\n\njudges are invested with broad discretion in determining appropriate sanctions\n\nfor discovery violations. State v. Marshall, 123 N.J. 1, 130 (1991).     When a\n\ntrial judge perceives\n\n\n            that a party has failed to comply with [Rule 3:13-3(f)]\n            or with an order issued pursuant to this [R]ule, [the\n            judge] may order such party to permit the discovery of\n            materials not previously disclosed, grant a continuance\n            or delay during trial, or prohibit the party from\n            introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or\n            [the judge] may enter such other order as [the judge]\n            deems appropriate.\n\n                                                                         A-5799-17T4\n                                      19\n\f            [R. 3:13-3(f).]\n\n\"An adjournment or continuance is a preferred remedy where circumstances\n\npermit.\" State v. Clark, 347 N.J. Super. 497, 509 (App. Div. 2002).\n\n      We defer to such determinations unless that are \"wide of the mark\" or\n\n\"based on a mistaken understanding of the applicable law.\" State v. Washington,\n\n453 N.J. Super. 164, 180 (App. Div. 2018) (quoting State v. Hernandez, 225 N.J.\n\n451, 461 (2016)). That, certainly, is not the case here where the trial judge's\n\nruling accomplished the goal of the discovery rules: \"to accomplish fairness,\"\n\nState v. Bellamy, 329 N.J. Super. 371, 376 (App. Div. 2000) (quoting State v.\n\nKearney, 109 N.J. Super. 502, 505 (Law Div. 1970)), and their principal\n\npurpose: \"to assure the parties every legitimate avenue of inquiry prior to trial to\n\nenhance the search for the truth,\" State v. Burnett, 198 N.J. Super. 53, 58 (App.\n\nDiv. 1984). Obviously, defendant was aware of the call and its contents; he was\n\na participant. He did not claim surprise or request a continuance; there is no\n\nevidence he suffered any prejudice from the timing of the recording's delivery\n\nto his counsel.   The trial judge properly applied his discretion in denying\n\ndefendant's preclusion application.\n\n      Likewise, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying\n\ndefendant's application to redact that portion of the recording which he now\n\n                                                                            A-5799-17T4\n                                        20\n\fcontends could have led the jury to \"conclude[] that the reference to [a judge\n\nother than the trial court judge] related to an earlier case\" involving defendant.\n\nDefendant avers he appeared before the other judge for a detention hearing\n\nrelating to this case and on an unrelated theft charge.      The portion of the\n\nrecording, as related in defendant's merits brief, is a conversation defendant had\n\nwith his father: 7\n\n\n             [DEFENDANT'S FATHER]:                Wednesday and\n             Thursday I gotta work right now. (inaudible) You have\n             court Thursday. What time is court on Thursday?\n\n             [DEFENDANT]: I think court is in the morning, early\n             morning. It's in front of the same judge that I went to.\n\n             [DEFENDANT'S FATHER]: Where?\n\n             [DEFENDANT]: In Freehold.\n\n             [DEFENDANT'S FATHER]: Where, [defendant]?\n\n             [DEFENDANT]: In Freehold.\n\n             [DEFENDANT'S FATHER]:           In the Freehold court\n             house?\n\n             [DEFENDANT]: Yes, in front of [a judge other than\n             the trial judge].\n\n             [DEFENDANT'S FATHER]: The same judge?\n\n7\n   The transcript of the call is largely \"[i]ndicernible,\" but the State does not\ndispute defendant's version of the call.\n                                                                          A-5799-17T4\n                                       21\n\f            [DEFENDANT]: Yeah, [a judge other than the trial\n            judge].\n\n            [DEFENDANT'S FATHER]: You sayin . . . [s]ame\n            judge?\n\n            [DEFENDANT]: Yes, dad.\n\n            [DEFENDANT'S FATHER]: Same lady that said\n            [\"]hey listen, you know you (inaudible) fuckin[']\n            problem.[\"]\n\n\n      We note the call does not reference the nature of the proceedings before\n\nthe other judge. No mention of any other crime is made, including the prior\n\ntheft. As the trial judge recognized, the jury knew defendant had criminal\n\ncharges. No inference to another crime or bad act could have reasonably been\n\ndrawn from that portion of the recording. Defendant's father's reference to\n\n\"[s]ame lady that said [']hey listen, you know you (inaudible) fuckin[']\n\nproblem['],\" contains neither context of the judge's alleged remark or the subject\n\nof same. Although it may have been ordered redacted in an abundance of\n\ncaution, we discern no abuse of discretion by the judge's admission. And, even\n\nif error, the fleeting, ambiguous statement was not \"clearly capable of producing\n\nan unjust result[.]\" R. 2:10-2.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          A-5799-17T4\n                                       22\n\f                                             IV.\n\n      Following the commencement of jury deliberations, the trial judge advised\n\nthe collective jury, including alternates, \"it has come to my attention that during\n\nthe lunch recess one or two of the jurors, either the [twelve] jurors that were\n\nselected or the two alternates or some combination of the two, were discussing\n\nthe case in contravention of my instructions not to do so.\" The record does not\n\nreveal who advised the judge of the juror transgression or what was disclosed to\n\nhim. Defense counsel, in arguing for a mistrial after each of the jurors was\n\nquestioned by the court out of the presence of any other juror, told the judge\n\n\n             based on the information I received from the deputy,\n             stated (sic) someone must be guilty because it was on\n             video, something along those nature of the lines (sic),\n             he clearly states he doesn't recall the statements that he\n             made. And I don't know the extent if it was just the jury\n             members or they (sic) received any input from anybody\n             else that was in line, or if it was just tailored to just\n             those four jurors\n\nwho had admitted having discussions in the lunch line. The record does not\n\nreveal the source of the information imparted to the judge by defense counsel.\n\n      The trial judge appropriately took \"action to assure that the jurors ha[d]\n\nnot become prejudiced as a result of facts which 'could have a tendency to\n\ninfluence the jury in arriving at its verdict in a manner inconsistent with the legal\n\n\n                                                                             A-5799-17T4\n                                        23\n\fproofs and the court's charge.'\" State v. Bisaccia, 319 N.J. Super. 1, 12 (App.\n\nDiv. 1999) (quoting State v. Scherzer, 301 N.J. Super. 363, 486 (App. Div.\n\n1997)). \"[W]here . . . there is the possibility of actual juror taint or exposure to\n\nextraneous influences (including jury misconduct and 'comments made to jurors\n\nby outside sources'), the judge must voir dire that juror and, in appropriate\n\ncircumstances, the remaining jurors.\" Id. at 13 (quoting Scherzer, 301 N.J.\n\nSuper. at 486).\n\n      The judge asked each juror if they discussed the case with anyone during\n\nthe lunch recess. Juror number two admitted discussing her \"past experience as\n\na juror[; j]ust about the process itself,\" but denied discussing \"the case at all.\"\n\nEight jurors denied having or overhearing any conversation. Juror number four\n\ndenied having any conversations but was not asked if she overheard any\n\ndiscussions; she, however, ate lunch in her car and saw her fellow jurors \"[j]ust\n\nat the end in front of the elevator\" so she was not present in the room in which\n\nfour of the jurors admitted having discussions.\n\n      Juror number one admitted overhearing a discussion in the lunch line\n\nabout \"[h]ow do we get things read back and things like that,\" but did not\n\nremember \"exactly what was said[.]\" The juror said the discussion \"wasn't\n\npertinent to any of the facts or anything like that. We were basically trying to\n\n\n                                                                            A-5799-17T4\n                                        24\n\ffigure out . . . if we could ask questions and stuff like that.\" Juror number one\n\nsaid the discussion \"took place [for] like maybe a minute and then we shut up.\"\n\nJuror number six also said she overheard a discussion in the lunch line between\n\ntwo jurors \"about process . . . like when can you ask questions and filling out\n\nthe piece of paper.\"\n\n      Juror thirteen said she was in the cafe \"just kind of talking about what we\n\ncould ask and not [ask,] but nothing, no evidence or names or anything like that\n\nwas brought up. And then we just - - you know, we were, like, it's not the place.\"\n\nFurther questioning by the judge elicited that there were a few jurors behind her,\n\nbut \"it wasn't like a discussion. It was just a couple, few words\" but reiterated\n\n\"nobody brought anything up of . . . any names or evidence[.]\"\n\n      Juror fourteen admitted he \"probably did say one or two things\" while in\n\nline but did not \"remember what they were.\"            He responded to further\n\nquestioning that he believed they were comments, not questions. Pressed by the\n\njudge, he said he thought the comments were prompted by questions the jurors\n\ncould ask. During continued colloquy, he said the communication took twenty-\n\nfive to fifty seconds and took place only in the lunch line.\n\n      From our review of the trial judge's voir dire, we see no abuse of\n\ndiscretion. State v. R.D., 169 N.J. 551, 559-60 (2001). The judge ascertained\n\n\n                                                                          A-5799-17T4\n                                       25\n\ffrom each juror what was discussed or what was overheard.           The judge's\n\nquestioning was not cursory. He did not simply accept a juror's brief answers.\n\n      We are unpersuaded by defendant's contention that the judge should have\n\nexplicitly asked each juror if they said or heard that \"someone must be guilty\n\nbecause it was on video.\" The judge's initial comments to the jury reveal he was\n\nadvised that one or two jurors had a discussion about the case. Only defense\n\ncounsel stated that there was a discussion about defendant's guilt based on a\n\nvideo. Unless one of the jurors admitted saying or hearing that comment, or if\n\na reliable source for that information was before the judge\u2014and we see no\n\nevidence that it was 8\u2014it would have been imprudent for the trial judge to impart\n\nsuch information, claimed now by defendant to be so prejudicial so as to warrant\n\na mistrial, to the jury. There was no evidence the jury was tainted. The trial\n\njudge sagely maintained that status and did not unnecessarily highlight a portion\n\nof the evidence\u2014the video.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  The \"deputy\" who purportedly revealed the comment to defense counsel is not\nidentified in the record. Moreover, the source of the deputy's information is\nunknown.\n                                                                         A-5799-17T4\n                                      26\n\f                                       V.\n\n\n      Defendant argues the trial judge erred by: (1) failing to take into account\n\ndefendant's rehabilitative efforts to address his drug addiction after arrest and\n\nbefore sentencing; (2) \"plac[ing] weight on [defendant's] failure to show\n\nremorse\"; and (3) \"impos[ing] the maximum possible sentence for [defendant's\n\nVOP] without fully explaining how a sentence of that duration was warranted.\"\n\n      We \"review sentencing determinations in accordance with a deferential\n\nstandard,\" and \"must not substitute [our] judgment for that of the sentencing\n\ncourt.\" State v. Fuentes, 217 N.J. 57, 70 (2014). We will affirm a sentence,\n\nunless:\n\n\n            (1) the sentencing guidelines were violated; (2) the\n            aggravating and mitigating factors found by the\n            sentencing court were not based upon competent and\n            credible evidence in the record; or (3) \"the application\n            of the guidelines to the facts of [the] case makes the\n            sentence clearly unreasonable so as to shock the\n            judicial conscience.\"\n\n            [Ibid. (alteration in original) (quoting State v. Roth, 95\n            N.J. 334, 364-65 (1984)).]\n\n\n      At the June 2018 sentencing, the trial judge properly exercised his\n\ndiscretion when he based his finding of aggravating three, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-\n\n\n\n                                                                         A-5799-17T4\n                                       27\n\f1(a)(3) (risk of reoffense), on defendant's \"daily ingestion of marijuana and\n\nPercocet\" through August 2017, and defendant's failure to complete an intensive\n\noutpatient treatment program, noting defendant's failure to attend a group\n\nsession on February 27, 2018. The judge also recognized defendant's ingestion\n\nof Xanax on five occasions. Defendant also pleaded guilty on the sentencing\n\ndate to violating probation, in part, by testing positive for drugs, thereby failing\n\nto comply completely with the substance abuse treatment condition of probation.\n\nAgainst this history, the judge was warranted in rejecting defendant's claim that\n\nhis efforts at post-arrest rehabilitation negated aggravating factor three. We also\n\nnote defendant received jail credits from August 31, 2017 to September 7, 2017\n\nand November 3, 2017 through the day prior to sentencing; and gap time from\n\nSeptember 8, 2017 through November 2, 2017. He was thus incarcerated during\n\nhis purported \"clean time,\" the period during which he claims he was drug-free.\n\n      We determine defendant's remaining arguments to be without sufficient\n\nmerit to warrant discussion in this opinion. R. 2:11-3(e)(2). We add only that\n\nthe judge recognized defendant's lack of remorse as one of the many reasons he\n\nfound aggravating factor nine, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(9) (need to deter), a practice\n\nwe sanctioned in State v. Rivers, 252 N.J. Super. 142, 153-54 (App. Div. 1991).\n\nFurther, defendant's notice of appeal does not list or reference the indictment on\n\n\n                                                                            A-5799-17T4\n                                        28\n\fwhich he was sentenced for third-degree theft after the VOP; and his criminal\n\ncase information statement merely references his guilty plea on that VOP\n\nwithout challenging it. We, therefore, need not address the arguments relating\n\nto the VOP sentence because we have made clear \"it is only the judgment or\n\norders designated in the notice of appeal which are subject to the appeal process\n\nand review[.]\" 1266 Apartment Corp. v. New Horizon Deli, Inc., 368 N.J.\n\nSuper. 456, 459 (App. Div. 2004). We will not review an order if the appellant\n\n\"did not indicate in his notice of appeal or case information statement that he\n\nwas appealing from the order[.]\" Fusco v. Bd. of Educ. of Newark, 349 N.J.\n\nSuper. 455, 460 (App. Div. 2002).\n\n      Nevertheless, our review of the presentence reports for both indictments\n\nleaves us unpersuaded that the five-year sentence the trial judge imposed on the\n\ntheft\u2014concurrent to defendant's sentence on the weapons conviction\u2014was not\n\nsupported by the same aggravating factors\u2014three, six, (extent of prior criminal\n\nrecord and seriousness of offenses), and nine, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(3), (6), and\n\n(9)\u2014found by the original sentencing judge; and that the mitigating factors, six,\n\n(defendant has or will compensate the victim of his or her conduct for the\n\ndamage or injury that he or she sustained, or will participate in a program of\n\ncommunity service), ten, (defendant is likely to respond positively to\n\n\n                                                                         A-5799-17T4\n                                      29\n\fprobationary treatment), and eleven, (excessive hardship that imprisonment\n\nwould bring to defendant or his or her dependents), N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(b)(6), (10)\n\nand (11), none of which were requested of or found by the trial judge in\n\nconnection with either sentence, still applied. The latest presentence report\n\nindicates: defendant has never held a job \"on the books\" and there is no evidence\n\nhe ever paid restitution; he violated probation; and no evidence was proffered\n\nregarding excessive hardship.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         A-5799-17T4\n                                      30\n\f",
