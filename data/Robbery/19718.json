The Court of\n\nSpecial Appeals held that imposing restitution under the circumstances of the present case\n\nviolated Maryland Code (1957, 2008 Repl. Vol.), Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a711-603\n\n(\u201cCP\u201d). We shall reverse.\n\nI.     The Circumstances.\n\n       In 2003 and 2004, Kenneth Stachowski violated Maryland\u2019s home improvement\n\nregulations codified in Maryland Code (1957, 2008 Repl. Vol.), Business Regulation\n\nArticle, \u00a78-101 et. seq. (\u201cBR\u201d). Stachowski entered into three separate home\n\nimprovement contracts with different Somerset County residents. When he failed to\n\nperform the agreed upon work, the aggrieved parties filed complaints with the Maryland\n\nHome Improvement Commission. The result was that Stachowski was charged criminally\n\nin the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Somerset County, with failing to perform\n\nhome improvement contracts (in violation of BR \u00a7 8-605) and acting as a contractor\n\nwithout a license (in violation of BR \u00a7 8-601). As there were three contracts, three\n\nseparate criminal proceedings were docketed as the units of prosecution.\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n This is our third encounter with Stachowski and the questions presented here. In Stachowski\nv. State, 403 Md. 1, 939 A.2d 158 (2008), and Stachowski v. State, 416 Md. 276, 6 A.3d 907\n(2010), we failed to reach the merits of the questions because of procedural and jurisdictional\nobstacles, respectively.\n\f       The charges were resolved through a plea agreement. Stachowski pleaded guilty to\n\nfailing to perform a home improvement contract in two of the cases and acting as a\n\ncontractor without a license in the third. The State nolle prossed the remaining charge in\n\neach case. The District Court imposed a suspended sentence of incarceration, a suspended\n\nfine, and supervised probation. As a condition of his probation, the District Court ordered\n\nStachowski to pay restitution to each of the three victims. Stachowski was ordered to pay\n\neach victim $250 a month, until they were compensated for their respective losses of\n\n$2,142.85, $4,140, and $8,997.\n\n       When Stachowski failed to make his restitution payments, the State sought to\n\nrevoke his probation. The District Court determined, after a hearing, that Stachowski\n\nviolated his probation in each of the three cases. The Court ordered Stachowski to serve\n\nconsecutively his suspended sentences of incarceration and pay a fine of $1,000 in each\n\ncase, which would be \u201cserved off\u201d at a rate of $10 per day of confinement. Stachowski\n\nappealed to the Circuit Court for Somerset County.\n\n       Meanwhile, in an unrelated case, Stachowski was charged with obtaining property\n\nor services by issuing a bad check, as well as theft. It was asserted that, in June 2005,\n\nStachowski passed a check of $182.86, drawn on a closed account, to Somerset Well\n\nDrilling to obtain services from the company. The case was transferred by the District\n\nCourt to the Circuit Court, upon Stachowski\u2019s request for a jury trial.2\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nWhile the case was pending, Stachowski\u2019s spouse made full restitution to Somerset Well\nDrilling.\n                                              2\n\f      On 11 October 2006, the bad check / theft case and the three probation violation\n\nhome improvement cases were called for trial in the Circuit Court. At the beginning of the\n\nproceeding, the State informed the judge that the parties had reached plea agreements to\n\nresolve the four cases and announced the terms:\n\n             THE COURT: Is there anything I need to know about these cases\n      before we proceed?\n\n              [THE STATE]: Your Honor, I believe we\u2019ve worked out a plea\n      agreement although I had not stated that on the record. My understanding of\n      the plea agreement, Your Honor, three of these are an appeal for violation\n      of probation from District Court. I think that we\u2019re in agreement and the\n      State would consent to the fact that Judge Hayman had imposed all of the\n      backup time for the cases. And in addition to that he had imposed a\n      thousand dollar fine per case and ordered that the Defendant serve that off\n      at ten dollars a day.\n\n              Your Honor, the portion that we\u2019re in agreement with is that the\n      thousand dollar fine that he would serve off at ten dollars a day was an\n      illegal sentence. My understanding as part of the plea agreement the\n      Defendant will agree to serve the suspended portion of the sentence which\n      was six months, six months and thirty days. If you need to know for each\n      case it will take me a minute to find that out.\n\n             THE COURT: I\u2019ll look at it in a minute. Go ahead and finish up and\n      we\u2019ll make sure the numbers are right.\n\n             [THE STATE]: Your Honor, as well the Defendant has agreed to\n      plead guilty in [the bad check case] to the only count, single count of bad\n      check. Your Honor, the State would recommend an active portion of five\n      months incarceration which would be consecutive to the three other\n      sentences as well. Those would be six months consecutive, consecutive to\n      six months, consecutive to thirty days.\n\n                                                ***\n\n              Consecutive to five months. In this case the suspended portion, Your\n      Honor, we would leave up to you, but we would recommend some sort of a\n      split sentence with an active period of incarceration.\n\n\n                                            3\n\f             As well, Your Honor, restitution has already been paid in this case.\n       His wife provided documentation this morning \u2013\n\n              THE COURT: So all restitution is paid?\n\n              [THE STATE]: In [the bad check case] a hundred and eighty-two\n       dollars and fifty cents has been paid by cash to the victim.[3 ]\n\n                                                  ***\n\n               Your Honor, as well, the State is not opposed to work release for\n       those active incarcerations as well as local time contingent on the fact that if\n       he is granted work release that he would pay restitution to the victims in the\n       violation of probation cases. Your Honor, he will agree to pay three\n       hundred dollars a month that would be a hundred dollars per victim. Your\n       Honor, that\u2019s not going to be enough to cover all of the restitution but at\n       least they\u2019ll be able to recover some portion of it. And then either sue him\n       civilly or you know \u2013\n\n              THE COURT: Central Collection.\n\n             [THE STATE]: Central Collection or put a lien on his house or\n       something of that nature.\n             And, Your Honor, I believe that would be the nature of the plea\n       agreement.\n\n              [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would like to add that the three hundred\n       dollars a month starts at the end of the first full calendar months he\u2019s out.\n\n              [STATE]: Your Honor, that would be contingent on work release.\n\n              [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yeah, if he is out on work release.\n\nStachowski pleaded guilty to the charge of passing a bad check to Somerset Well Drilling\n\nand the State nolle prossed the related theft charge. When the Circuit Court turned to the\n\n\n3\n\n When providing the factual basis for the guilty plea, the State asserted that the bad check\npassed by Stachowski to Somerset Well Drilling was for $182.86. The $0.36 difference\nbetween the amount of the bad check and the restitution paid on Stachowski\u2019s behalf appears\nto have been treated as immaterial.\n                                              4\n\fthree violation of probation cases, Stachowski pled guilty again. The judge found\n\nexpressly that Stachowski\u2019s guilty pleas were valid.\n\n       For passing the bad check, the Circuit Court sentenced Stachowski to eighteen\n\nmonths of incarceration, with all but five months suspended, and five years of probation\n\ncontingent on Stachowski making restitution payments to the victims of the three home\n\nimprovement cases. For violating his probation in the home improvement cases,\n\nStachowski was sentenced to a total of one year and thirty days incarceration. The\n\nsentences were to be served consecutively at the Somerset County Detention Center, with\n\nthe sentence for writing the bad check as the last to expire of all outstanding sentences.4\n\nThe Circuit Court approved work release, subject to Stachowski clearing up an\n\noutstanding detainer in Delaware. In short, the Circuit Court implemented the terms of the\n\nplea agreement. Neither Stachowski nor his attorney objected at the time to the\n\nrequirement of restitution.5\n\n       In November 2006, Stachowski applied for leave to appeal the four cases to the\n\nCourt of Special Appeals. The applications with regard to the three probation violation\n\ncases were transferred to this Court by order of the Court of Special Appeals.\n\nStachowski\u2019s application for leave to appeal in the bad check case was denied by the\n\n\n\n4\n\n In addition to the sentences for writing the bad check and the home improvement violations,\nStachowski had outstanding sentences for unrelated theft and for driving with a suspended\nlicense which were to run consecutively.\n5\n\n Stachowski expressed some concern about his ability to pay restitution in light of his other\nfinancial obligations, but agreed to the terms nonetheless.\n                                             5\n\fCourt of Special Appeals. He filed a motion for reconsideration with the intermediate\n\nappellate court, which motion remained pending for some time.\n\n       On 22 August 2007, we issued a writ of certiorari as to the home improvement\n\ncases to consider the same questions that are before this Court now. We dismissed,\n\nhowever, the writ. Stachowski v. State, 403 Md. 1, 939 A.2d 158 (2008) (Stachowski I).\n\nWe held that we could not consider the lawfulness of the Circuit Court\u2019s order for\n\nrestitution to the home improvement victims because it was imposed as a condition of\n\nprobation in the bad check case, not the violation of probation stemming from\n\nStachowski\u2019s home improvement charges. Thus, the issue was not before us properly at\n\nthat time in the context of the home improvement cases.\n\n       Stachowski supplemented subsequently his motion for reconsideration in the bad\n\ncheck case that remained pending before the Court of Special Appeals. The motion was\n\ngranted on 28 May 2008. The intermediate appellate court directed the parties to brief\n\nwhether the trial judge had authority to require restitution for the injuries arising from the\n\nunrelated home improvement cases as a condition for probation in the bad check case.\n\n       After Stachowski filed his initial brief with the Court of Special Appeals, this\n\nCourt issued a writ of certiorari, on its initiative, to consider the question. We dismissed\n\nthis writ for lack of jurisdiction as well because the intermediate appellate court had not\n\nruled on the merits of the application. Stachowski v. State, 416 Md. 276, 6 A.3d 907\n\n(2010) (Stachowski II). On remand, the Court of Special Appeals decided Stachowski\u2019s\n\nappeal on the merits in Stachowski v. State, 213 Md. App. 1, 73 A.3d 290 (2013).\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f       The Court of Special Appeals, interpreting the language of Maryland\u2019s restitution\n\nstatute and relevant common law jurisprudence, held that the Circuit Court was without\n\nauthority to condition probation in the bad check case on the payment of restitution to the\n\nvictims in the home improvement cases because the latter were unrelated directly to the\n\nformer, either factually or legally. The Court of Special Appeals struck the restitution\n\nrequirement of Stachowski\u2019s probation, but upheld otherwise the sentence.\n\n       We issued a writ of certiorari to the Court of Special Appeals, at the behest of the\n\nState, State v. Stachowski, 436 Md. 327, 81 A.3d 457 (2013), to consider the following\n\nquestions:\n\n\n              1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that a court\n              may not order restitution as part of a plea agreement on a\n              charge as a condition of a probation in another matter before\n              the court, creating uncertainty in conflict with this Court\u2019s\n              holdings in Walczak and Lee?\n\n              2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in vacating only the\n              negotiated and accepted restitution condition required of\n              Stachowski, which was part of the plea agreement, rather than\n              rescinding the entire plea agreement, thus allowing\n              Stachowski the full benefit of his bargain with the State\n              without assuming any of his negotiated burden?\n\n\n\nII.    Third Time a Charm.\n\nA. Maryland\u2019s Restitution Scheme.\n\n       Restitution may be ordered as part of a sentence, according to CP \u00a7\n\n11-603(a), or as condition of probation, according to CP \u00a7 2-221. Pete v.\n\nState, 384 Md. 47, 55, 862 A.2d 419, 423 (2004). In both instances,\n\n\n                                            7\n\frestitution is a criminal sanction, not a civil remedy. Grey v. Allstate Ins.\n\nCo., 363 Md. 445, 451, 769 A.2d 891, 895 (2001). Although restitution\n\nserves to recompense the victim, it aims also to punish and rehabilitate the\n\ncriminal. Pete, 384 Md. at 55, 862 A.2d at 423.\n\n       A trial court may order restitution, in the sound exercise of its\n\ndiscretion, when, \u201cas a direct result of the crime or delinquent act, property\n\nof the victim was stolen, damaged, destroyed, converted, or unlawfully\n\nobtained, or its value substantially decreased. . . .\u201d CP \u00a7 11-603(a)(1)\n\n(emphasis added).6 Medical and funeral expenses, direct out-of-pocket loss,\n\nloss of earnings, and certain government expenses may provide the basis for\n\nrestitution. See CP \u00a7 11-603(a). The term \u201cvictim\u201d is defined as \u201ca person\n\nwho suffered death, personal injury, or property damage or loss as a direct\n\nresult of a crime or delinquent act; or, if the person is deceased, the personal\n\nrepresentative the estate of the person.\u201d CP \u00a7 11-601(j).\n\n       Determining whether an injury is a \u201cdirect result\u201d of the criminal\n\nconduct is central traditionally to mapping the outer limits of a trial court\u2019s\n\ndiscretion in ordering restitution in most cases. Our cases are clear that\n\nrestitution may be compelled only where the injury results from the actions\n\nthat made the defendant\u2019s conduct criminal. See Goff v. State, 387 Md. 327,\n\n6\n\n Whether restitution is ordered as condition of probation or as a sentence, the trial court\u2019s\norder must meet the \u201cdirect result\u201d requirement of Maryland Code (1957, 2008 Repl. Vol.),\nCriminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 11-603. Silver v. State, 420 Md. 415 n.16, 427, 23 A.3d 867,\n874 (2011); see also Pete v. State, 384 Md. 47, 65-66, 862 A.2d 419, 429-30 (2004).\n                                               8\n\f344, 875 A.2d 132, 142 (2005) (finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct was a\n\ndirect result of the injury for which restitution was ordered because the\n\nproperty damage was caused \u201cduring and because of\u201d the crime, without\n\nany intervening cause); Pete, 384 Md. at 60-61, 862 A.2d at 426-27\n\n(rejecting proximate causation, mere nexus, or single charging document\n\ntheories of defining the direct result of the crime and, instead, requiring \u201ca\n\ndirect result between the qualifying crime committed and the damages\n\ninflicted\u201d in order for restitution to authorized). Further, as we announced in\n\nWalczak v. State, restitution may be compelled ordinarily only for the\n\ncriminal conduct for which the defendant was convicted. 302 Md. 422, 429,\n\n488 A.2d 949, 952 (1985).\n\n       We acknowledged a narrow exception to these principles in Lee v.\n\nState. 307 Md. 74, 512 A.2d 372 (1986).7 Lee was charged in the Circuit\n7\n\nThe pertinent statute in effect when we decided Lee v. State was the same essentially as the\ncurrent statute:\n               On conviction of a crime, the court may order the defendant to\n               make restitution in addition to any other penalty for the\n               commission of the crime, if:\n               (i) Property of the victim was stolen, converted, unlawfully\n               obtained, or its value substantially decreased as a direct result of\n               the crime;\n               (ii) The victim suffered actual medical expenses, direct out-\n               of-pocket losses, or loss of earnings as a direct result of the\n               crime;\n               (iii) The victim incurred medical expenses that were paid for\n               by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene or any other\n               governmental entity; or\n               (iv) A governmental entity incurred expenses in the removal,\n               towing, transporting, preserving, storage, sale, or destruction\n               of an abandoned vehicle.\n                                              9\n\fCourt for Montgomery County with forging a check and theft. Id., 307 Md.\n\nat 76, 512 A.2d at 373. Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to a\n\nsingle count of forgery. The State nolle prossed the theft count. Id. As part\n\nof the agreement, Lee admitted to the facts underlying the theft charge and\n\ntold the Circuit Court that he wanted to make restitution for the theft. Id.\n\nThe trial judge sentenced Lee for the forgery conviction to seven years of\n\nincarceration, with all but six months suspended, upon the expiration of\n\nwhich the defendant would be placed on probation for three years. Id. Lee\n\nsigned an order of probation in which he agreed to pay restitution in the\n\namount of the loss charged in the theft count. Id.\n\n       Lee failed to pay the restitution as required. The State filed a petition\n\nto revoke his probation. At the probation revocation hearing, Lee argued\n\nthat the court lacked authority to order restitution for theft because he had\n\nnot been convicted of that charge. The Circuit Court reviewed the terms of\n\nthe plea agreement, noting that Lee had agreed expressly to make restitution\n\nto the victims of the nolle prossed theft charge, and revoked the probation.\n\nId., 307 Md. at 76-77, 512 A.2d at 373. The Court of Special Appeals\n\naffirmed, in a reported opinion, the judgment of the Circuit Court. Lee v.\n\nState, 65 Md. App. 149, 499 A.2d 969 (1985).\n\nMaryland Code (1957, 1982 Rep. Vol., 1986 Cum. Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 640(b)(1). The\nstatute authorized directing payment of restitution to the victims of crime, government entity\nthat suffered loss, and third party payors (including insurers). See Art. 27, \u00a7 640 (b)(2). The\nprior iteration of Maryland\u2019s restitution statute, the version at issue in Walczak v. State, was\nalso essentially the same. Lee v. State, 307 Md. 74, 78, 512 A.2d 372, 374 (1986).\n                                              10\n\f       On certiorari, we held that a trial court has the authority, under these\n\ncircumstances, to order restitution for charged crimes for which no\n\nconviction ensued, if it is ordered as the result of a plea agreement as to the\n\ncrime for which a conviction was entered. See id., 307 Md. at 81, 512 A.2d\n\nat 376. Like the Court of Special Appeals, we found that this exception was\n\ncontemplated by Walczak. Id. (citing Walczak, 302 Md. at 426 n.1, 488\n\nA.2d 949).\n\n       In Silver v. State, we clarified that, for the exception in Lee to apply,\n\nthe defendant must agree expressly to pay restitution as part of the plea\n\nbargain.8 420 Md. 415, 432, 23 A.3d 867, 877 (2011). In Silver, the\n\ndefendants, a husband and wife, were each charged with three counts of\n\nanimal cruelty for neglecting three horses. Id., 420 Md. at 424, 23 A.3d at\n\n874. Pursuant to a plea agreement, the defendants each pleaded guilty to\n\none charge of animal cruelty for their treatment of the euthanized horse.\n\nThe State nolle prossed the two remaining counts against each defendant\n\nwhich charged them with mistreatment of the surviving horses. Id. After\n\nhearing a stipulated statement of facts, the District Court judge sentenced\n\nthe defendants to six days imprisonment, to be served over three weekends,\n\nand ordered restitution to the veterinarians who euthanized the one horse\n\nand provided rehabilitation for the other two. Id., 420 Md. at 424-25, n.6, 23\n8\n\nSilver v. State was interpreting the current iteration of Maryland\u2019s restitution statute. See 420\nMd. 415, 427 n.15, 23 A.3d 867, 873 (2011).\n\n\n                                               11\n\fA.3d at 874. The Circuit Court, on appeal, also ordered restitution for the\n\ncare given the three horses. Id., 420 Md. at 426, 23 A.3d at 873.\n\n       We vacated the judgment that ordered the defendants to pay\n\nrestitution for the rehabilitation of the surviving horses. Id., 420 Md. at 437,\n\n23 A.3d at 880. The determinative factor in Silver was that, unlike in Lee,\n\nthe defendants had not agreed expressly to pay restitution for the fall-out of\n\nthe nolle prossed charges as part of the valid plea agreement.9 See id, 420\n\nMd. at 432, 23 A.3d at 876-77.\n\nB. The Circuit Court Was Authorized to Condition Stachowski\u2019s Probation\n   in the Bad Check Conviction on the Payment of Restitution to the\n   Victims in the Home Improvement Cases.\n\n       In the instant case, Stachowski agreed voluntarily and expressly to\n\npay restitution to the victims in his home improvement fraud cases as a\n\ncondition of probation entered on his bad check conviction.10 The\n9\n\n A defendant need not agree expressly to pay restitution of a specified amount for a trial court\nto order restitution for crimes other than the one or ones representing the conviction for\nwhich probation is entered. In Lee, we found valid an order of restitution where the defendant\nagreed \u201cto make restitution in the full amount\u201d for the nolle prossed charges as part of a plea\nagreement. 307 Md. at 81, 512 A.2d at 376.\n10\n\n Stachowski argues to us that he did not agree voluntarily to make restitution to the victims\nof the home improvement cases because he was incarcerated at the time restitution was\nordered and was in a difficult financial situation. Although there was clear incentive for\nStachowski to accept a plea agreement\u2014namely, to limit incarceration and provide support\nfor his family through work release\u2014these pressures do not diminish the knowing and\nvoluntary nature of his plea. Stachowski indicated on the record that he understood the\nnature of the charges and had discussed them with his attorney. Further, the trial judge\nquestioned Stachowski regarding his understanding of the ramifications of his plea. Such\ncircumstances, absent other indications negating voluntariness, are strong evidence that the\nplea was knowing and voluntary. State v. Daughtry, 419 Md. 35, 75, 18 A.3d 60, 84 (2011).\n                                              12\n\fagreement was announced to the Circuit Court judge and acknowledged as\n\ncorrect by Stachowski\u2019s attorney. In exchange for the State (1) not\n\nprosecuting the theft charge, (2) recommending a sentence of five months\n\nincarceration for the bad check case, and (3) suggesting work release,\n\nStachowski agreed to plead guilty to the bad check charge and pay\n\nrestitution to the victims of his fraudulent home improvement scheme.\n\nThere were respective quid pro quos for what Stachowski and the State\n\nagreed to (and the Court implemented) that fell squarely within the narrow\n\nexception announced in Lee.\n\n       The Court of Special Appeals, in reaching the opposite conclusion,\n\nfocused on dicta in Silver that it construed as suggesting that the Lee\n\nexception applies only when the other charges or crimes for which\n\nrestitution is ordered are related to the crime for which the defendant was\n\nconvicted and probation entered. The relevant language of Silver states:\n\n\u201c[a]s Walzcak and Lee have long since established, the State may request, in\n\nplea negotiations, that a criminal defendant agree to pay restitution for\n\nrelated, though uncharged, crimes.\u201d 420 Md. at 432, 23 A.3d at 876-77\n\n(emphasis added). Although, as a matter of formal logic, this statement does\n\nnot frustrate the State from requesting restitution for unrelated crimes,\n\noftentimes, in typical usage, the express mention of one thing is the\n\nexclusion of the other. Thus, the intermediate appellate court\u2019s view is not\n\nwithout basis.\n\n                                             13\n\f       We make clear here, therefore, that the Lee exception is not limited\n\nonly to related charges or crimes. Our analysis in Walzack and Lee did not\n\nturn on whether the crimes were related and neither case mentioned\n\nrelatedness when discussing the authority of a trial judge to order restitution\n\nfor crimes for which the defendant was not convicted, but agreed\n\nnonetheless to make restitution. The allowance of restitution for other\n\ncriminal conduct as the result of a plea bargain is just as rational for\n\nunrelated crimes as related crimes, provided a defendant gives his or her\n\nvoluntary and express agreement to the restitution. As U.S. v. McLaughlin,\n\na case we relied upon in Lee, noted:\n\n              First, plea-bargaining in situations involving multicount\n              indictments would be severely restricted. If a defendant could\n              not consent to make restitution for the actual loss caused by\n              his or her conduct relating to the indictment, and have such be\n              a condition of any probation he or she might receive, then the\n              government would have little reason to dismiss indictment\n              counts in order to limit a defendant's potential period of\n              incarceration. More importantly, however, it would frustrate\n              the rehabilitation goals of the probation system. . . . To permit\n              a defendant who freely admits his or her guilt, and the amount\n              of loss caused thereby, to avoid making the aggrieved party at\n              least economically whole is intolerable from a societal\n              perspective.\n\n512 F. Supp. 907, 912 (D. Md. 1981) (quoted in Lee, 307 Md. at 80-81, 512 A.2d at 375).\n\nPlea agreements are useful equally to realize the punitive, rehabilitative, and\n\ncompensatory goals of Maryland\u2019s restitution statute in the context of unrelated crimes.\n\nEnforcing the reasonable expectations of the parties to plea agreements benefits\n\ndefendants, the State, and victims. The Maryland General Assembly did not aim to limit\n\n                                              14\n\fthe State\u2019s use of plea agreements to resolve efficiently cases involving multiple,\n\nunrelated charged crimes pursuant to CP \u00a7 11-603(a), or its statutory predecessor that was\n\nat issue in Lee.\n\n       Other jurisdictions with restitution regulatory regimes similar to Maryland\u2019s do not\n\nrequire the other criminal conduct, for which restitution is ordered, to be related to the\n\nconviction associated with the probation in order for trial courts to impose restitution,\n\nprovided the defendant consents to it through a valid plea agreement. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 3663 (authorizing in federal courts restitution to persons other than the victim of an\n\noffense, if agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement); Ex parte Killough, 434 So. 2d\n\n852, 853 (Ala. 1983); Kimbrell v.

Kinneman, 119 P.3d 350, 357 (Wash. 2005); Graham v.\n\nState, 261 P.3d 239, 242 (Wyo. 2011).\n\n       Our reference to \u201crelated cases\u201d in Silver does not erode the plea agreement\n\nexception described in Walzack and Lee, which mirrors, as noted above, the rule in many\n\nof our sister states and the Federal courts. Rather, Silver recognized merely that, as was\n\nthe case in Lee, plea agreements including restitution for uncharged crimes or convictions\n\nwill often involve related charges.11\n\n11\n\n Even in the context of a plea agreement, the amount of restitution the defendant agrees to\npay the victim of the uncharged crimes must be certain and there must be no factual dispute\nthat the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct caused or was responsible for the aggrieved party\u2019s\nloss. See Lee, 307 Md. at 80, 82, 512 A.2d at 375, 376 (1986). In Stachowski\u2019s case, the\nprevious convictions supplied the factual basis for the amount of restitution ordered and\nStachowski\u2019s responsibility for it.\n                                             16\n\fC. We Decline to Abrogate Lee.\n\n       In the end, Stachowski asks us to revisit Lee, pointing to alternative interpretations\n\nof CP \u00a7 11-603(a) and invoking the noted ambiguous dicta from Silver. He points\n\nparticularly to the statutory requirement that restitution ordered be the \u201cdirect result\u201d of\n\nthe crime. Before engaging Stachowski\u2019s arguments, we pause to reflect on the\n\nimplications of the doctrine of stare decisis.\n\n       The crux of the doctrine of stare decisis is that courts should reaffirm, follow, and\n\napply ordinarily the published decisional holdings of our appellate courts even though, if\n\nafforded a blank slate, the court might decide the matter differently. Coleman v. Soccer\n\nAss'n of Columbia, 432 Md. 679, 689, 69 A.3d 1149, 1154-55 (2013). The doctrine of\n\nstare decisis encourages the consistent development of legal principles, public reliance on\n\nour judicial decisions, and the perceived integrity of the courts. Livesay v. Baltimore\n\nCnty., 384 Md. 1, 14, 862 A.2d 33, 40 (2004).\n\n       Our devotion to stare decisis, however, is not absolute. We may decline to follow\n\nthe doctrine when persuaded the prior decision is clearly wrong, Townsend v. Bethlehem-\n\nFairfield Shipyard, 186 Md. 406, 417, 47 A.2d 365, 370 (1946), or when the precedent\n\nhas been rendered archaic and inapplicable to modern society through the passage of time\n\nand evolving events, Harrison v. Montgomery Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 295 Md. 442, 459-60,\n\n456 A.2d 894, 903 (1983). Neither of these \u201couts\u201d release us from honoring Lee in the\n\npresent case.\n\n       As noted above, allowing a defendant to consent to pay restitution for his or her\n\nother crimes in addition to the crime for which he or she stands convicted, as the result of\n\n                                                 17\n\fa plea agreement, is consistent with the goals and purposes of Maryland\u2019s restitution\n\nstatute. The General Assembly contemplated restitution to serve compensatory,\n\nrehabilitative, and punitive goals. Pete, 384 Md. at 55, 862 A.2d at 423. If courts could\n\nnot order a defendant who admits freely to wrongdoing and accepts the responsibility to\n\npay restitution as part of a plea agreement, prosecutors would have less incentive to\n\nrefrain from prosecuting to the fullest all charges and seeking the maximum allowable\n\nsentence. Contrary to the goals of the statute, the reading of CP \u00a7 11-603(a) urged by\n\nStachowski would limit compensation of the victim and the commencement of the\n\nvoluntary rehabilitation of the defendant. There was, and remains, strong support for our\n\ninterpretation in Lee of Maryland\u2019s restitution statute.\n\n       The Lee approach is accepted widely, as noted supra at 14-16. Thus, Lee is not an\n\naberration or an outlier from a bygone era inapplicable to modern society12 : several states\n\nand the Federal courts, as noted earlier, follow a similar rule.13 Further, the Maryland\n12\n\n Indeed, this line of reasoning continues to gain new adherents. In 2012, the Supreme Court\nof Kentucky considered for the first time whether a trial court could order restitution for\ncrimes for which the defendant had not been convicted if the defendant agreed to restitution\npursuant to a plea agreement. Commonwealth. v. Morseman, 379 S.W.3d 144 (Ky. 2012).\nThe Court noted that the Kentucky restitution statutes, strictly construed, would only allow\na court to order restitution for crimes for which the defendant had been convicted. Id. at 148-\n49. After considering, however, the nature and aims of the statute and the interpretation of\nsimilar statutes by the courts of other states, including Maryland, the Kentucky Court held\n\u201cthat a trial court is authorized to order restitution for damages not suffered as a direct result\nof the criminal act(s) for which the defendant has been convicted when, as part of a plea\nagreement, the defendant freely and voluntarily agrees to the restitution condition.\u201d Id. at\n152.\n13\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court interpreted narrowly the federal statute authorizing restitution in\nHugey v. U. S., 495 U.S. 411 (1990). The Supreme Court held that the relevant federal statute\ndid not authorize the federal courts to order restitution for crimes for which the defendant had\n                                               18\n\fGeneral Assembly, in the twenty-eight years since Lee, not only has failed to abrogate\n\nLee, but also has broadened the scope of restitution. See 2006 Md. Laws Ch. 428 (adding\n\nto courts\u2019 authority to order restitution the performance of services); 2006 Md. Laws Ch.\n\n429 (broadening the class of persons and entities to which a court may order criminal\n\nrestitution paid).\n\n       We stand by our decision in Lee.\n\nIII.   C ONCLUSION\n\n   Under Walzack, Lee, and Silver, the Circuit Court for Somerset County had authority\n\nto condition Stachowski\u2019s probation on the bad check conviction on his payment of\n\nrestitution to the victims of his home improvement fraud. Stachowski agreed voluntarily\n\nand expressly to pay restitution to the victims of his home improvement fraud in\n\nexchange for the State\u2019s agreement to: (1) refrain from prosecuting the theft count in the\n\nbad check case; (2) recommend that Stachowski be allowed work release; and (3)\n\nencourage the court to impose a sentence of incarceration less than the maximum\n\nallowable. It was clear on this record that the ordered restitution was attributed properly\n\nto Stachowski in the proper amount.\n\n                                            JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF\n                                            SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED. CASE\n                                            REMANDED TO THE COURT OF\n                                            SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS\n\nnot been convicted, even if the defendant consented expressly to pay the restitution as part\nof a plea agreement. Id. at 413, 422. That same year, however, Congress responded to Hugey\nby passing the Crime Control Act of 1990, which broadened the class of \u201cvictims\u201d under the\nfederal restitution statute and allowed courts to order restitution \u201c\u2018to the extent agreed to by\nthe parties in a plea agreement.\u2019\u201d U.S. v.
