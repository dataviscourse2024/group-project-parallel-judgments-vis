STATE OF TENNESSEE\n\n                  Appeal from the Circuit Court for Madison County\n                      No. C13358     Roy B. Morgan, Jr., Judge\n\n\n\n\n                 No. W2014-00867-CCA-R3-PC - Filed March 4, 2015\n\n\nPetitioner, William Newson, pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of an intoxicant\n(DUI) with an agreed sentence of eleven months twenty nine days, with forty-eight hours to\nserve and the remainder on probation. The sentence was to be served concurrently with a\nparole violation and a violation of an order of protection in unrelated cases. Petitioner filed\na timely petition for post-conviction relief alleging that trial counsel promised him that his\nDUI guilty plea would result in his release from jail after serving the forty-eight hours as\ndescribed in the guilty plea agreement and that he would return to probation. Petitioner now\nappeals the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition for post-conviction relief, in which he alleged\nthat his guilty plea was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered due to the\nineffective assistance of trial counsel. Having reviewed the record before us, we affirm the\njudgment of trial court.\n\n Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Criminal Court Affirmed\n\nT HOMAS T. W OODALL, P.J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which A LAN E. G LENN and\nR OBERT L. H OLLOWAY, J R., JJ., joined.\n\nJoshua B. Dougan, Jackson, Tennessee, for the appellant, William Newson.\n\nHerbert H. Slatery, III, Attorney General and Reporter; David H. Findley, Senior Counsel;\nJerry Woodall, District Attorney General; and Matthew Floyd, Assistant District Attorney\nGeneral, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\f                                          OPINION\n\nBackground\n\n       The transcript of the guilty plea submission hearing was not introduced at the post-\nconviction hearing and was not included in the record on appeal. Also, the judgment of the\nDUI conviction is not in the record. The guilty plea agreement was the only exhibit entered\nat the post-conviction hearing. Therefore, we rely on the guilty plea agreement, the\ntestimony presented at the post-conviction hearing, the trial court\u2019s findings at the post-\nconviction hearing, and trial court\u2019s order denying post-conviction relief for the relevant\nfacts.\n\nPost-conviction hearing\n\n        Petitioner testified that he met with trial counsel, and they discussed the charges\nagainst him of DUI and driving on a suspended license. They met and prepared for the case\nand then proceeded to trial. The result was an acquittal on the suspended license charge and\na hung jury on the DUI charge. Petitioner testified that he and trial counsel then prepared for\na second trial on the DUI charge. On the day of the second trial, Petitioner decided to enter\na plea of guilty to DUI. When asked why he accepted the plea agreement, Petitioner\ntestified:\n\n       Because I was told that it was gonna be ran [sic] in [sic] concurrent with my\n       parole, and after I do 48 hours in jail, that I was gonna be released on 11/29\n       probation suspended. The 11/29 was suspended and the rest was gonna be on\n       probation, and then I was gonna have a parole officer and a probation officer.\n\n       Petitioner completed a \u201cRequest for Acceptance of Plea of Guilty and Petition to\nWaive Trial by Jury and to Waive Appeal\u201d form. The \u201cOther Conditions\u201d portion of the\nagreement contained the following handwritten notation: \u201c1 year loss of license, concurrent\n[with] parole violation [and] violation of order of protection.\u201d Petitioner testified that he was\n\u201cunder the impression,\u201d based on trial counsel\u2019s assertions, that he had an additional twelve\nhours to serve of the forty-eight hour sentence for DUI, and he would then be released on\nprobation. However, he was instead sent to the West Tennessee State Penitentiary.\nPetitioner testified that he would not have entered the plea agreement if he had known that\nhe would be sent back to the Department of Correction after serving the remainder of the\nforty-eight hour period of incarceration. Petitioner claimed that at the guilty plea acceptance\nhearing he asked \u201call kinds of questions\u201d to make sure that he would \u201cbe released in 48\nhours.\u201d He said: \u201cSee, I didn\u2019t know if I could be on parole and be on probation at the same\n\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\ftime, and I asked Your Honor and I asked my lawyer, and the understanding that I received\nis that I could be on parole and probation at the same time.\u201d\n\n       On cross-examination, Petitioner agreed that at the time of the plea agreement he was\nalready in custody for violating his parole in another case and for violating an order of\nprotection. He admitted that the parole violation resulted from the order of protection charge,\nbut he asserted that he had not been found guilty of the charge. Petitioner claimed that the\nparole violation was also based on the DUI charge. However, Petitioner admitted that the\nplea agreement form specified that his DUI sentence would run concurrent with his parole\nviolation on a thirty-year sentence and therefore, the plea agreement form showed that\nPetitioner\u2019s parole violation sentence had already begun prior to the plea to DUI. Petitioner\nasserted that he was informed that he could simultaneously be on probation and parole.\nPetitioner denied that trial counsel told him that trial counsel had no control over the parole\nboard\u2019s decision with regard to Petitioner\u2019s existing sentence.\n\n       Trial counsel testified that after Petitioner\u2019s first trial that ended in a hung jury for the\nDUI charge, he later learned that the jury was hung 10-2 for conviction. At the time,\nPetitioner was already in custody for a pending parole violation on a thirty-year sentence for\nmultiple aggravated robbery convictions and for violating an order of protection. The parole\nviolation was a result of the pending violation of an order of protection.\n\n        Trial counsel testified that on the day of Petitioner\u2019s second trial, the State agreed to\na plea offer of \u201c[e]ssentially, the mandatory minimum and fines and jail time and community\nservice.\u201d Trial counsel explained the offer to Petitioner and told him that the charge would\n\u201crun concurrent with the parole violation as well as the violation of [the] order of protection.\u201d\nTrial counsel advised Petitioner that trial counsel had \u201cno control or no say-so over what the\nparole board may do\u201d with respect to the parole violation. Trial counsel testified: \u201cOnly\nthing I could say is this case would be run concurrent with that.\u201d\n\n       On cross-examination, trial counsel testified that the plea agreement in Petitioner\u2019s\ncase occurred after the jury was excused on the day of Petitioner\u2019s trial. He testified that he\nhad also discussed the proposal with Petitioner \u201cfairly soon after the first jury trial.\u201d\nConcerning Petitioner\u2019s sentence, trial counsel testified:\n\n       I explained what this case - - how it would be run, that it could be run\n       concurrent or consecutive to his parole violation. I couldn\u2019t tell him what the\n       outcome of the parole violation was going to be, but I could tell him what the\n       outcome of this case was going to be, and that\u2019s what I did.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fAnalysis\n\n        Petitioner argues that his guilty plea was not knowingly or intelligently entered\nbecause he was told and understood that he would be released from custody after serving the\nagreed upon forty-eight hours in jail for his DUI sentence. He claims that \u201ctrial counsel did\nnot adequately explain the relationship between this plea agreement and the parole violation.\u201d\nPetitioner contends that Trial Counsel\u2019s failure to explain the relationship resulted in\nPetitioner\u2019s \u201centrance into a plea bargain on a charge that he otherwise would have taken to\na jury trial for a second time.\u201d Additionally, Petitioner asserts that he was prejudiced by trial\ncounsel\u2019s deficient performance because of \u201cthe fact that the first trial on this charge resulted\nin a hung jury demonstrates a reasonable probability that [Petitioner] may have been\nacquitted had this case proceeded to a second trial.\u201d We disagree.\n\n       The post-conviction petitioner bears the burden of proving his allegations by clear and\nconvincing evidence. See Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-110(f). On appeal, the appellate court\naccords to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact the weight of a jury verdict, and these findings are\nconclusive on appeal unless the evidence preponderates against them. Henley v. State, 960\nS.W.2d 572, 578-79 (Tenn. 1997); Bates v. State, 973 S.W.2d 615, 631 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n1997). By contrast, the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law receive no deference or presumption\nof correctness on appeal. Fields v. State, 40 S.W.3d 450, 453 (Tenn. 2001).\n\n        To establish entitlement to post-conviction relief via a claim of ineffective assistance\nof counsel, the post-conviction petitioner must affirmatively establish first that \u201cthe advice\ngiven, or the services rendered by the attorney, are [not] within the range of competence\ndemanded of attorneys in criminal cases[,]\u201d see Baxter v. Rose, 523 S.W.2d 930, 936 (Tenn.\n1975), and second that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance \u201cactually had an adverse effect\non the defense[,]\u201d Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 693, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed.\n2d 674 (1984). In other words, the petitioner must \u201cshow that there is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different.\u201d Id. at 694. Should the petitioner fail to establish either deficient\nperformance or prejudice, he is not entitled to relief. Id. at 697; Goad v. State, 938 S.W.2d\n363, 370 (Tenn. 1996). Indeed, \u201c[i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the\nground of lack of sufficient prejudice, that course should be followed.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 697.\n\n        When reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we will not grant the\npetitioner the benefit of hindsight, second-guess a reasonably based trial strategy, or provide\nrelief on the basis of a sound, but unsuccessful, tactical decision made during the course of\nthe proceedings. Adkins v. State, 911 S.W.2d 334, 347 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994). Such\ndeference to the tactical decisions of counsel, however, applies only if the choices are made\n\n                                               -4-\n\fafter adequate preparation for the case. Cooper v. State, 847 S.W.2d 521, 528 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. 1992).\n\n        Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact. State\nv. Honeycutt, 54 S.W.3d 762, 766-67 (Tenn. 2001); State v. Burns, 6 S.W.3d 453, 461 (Tenn.\n1999). When reviewing the application of law to the trial court\u2019s factual findings, our review\nis de novo, and the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law are given no presumption of correctness.\nFields, 40 S.W.3d at 457-58; see also State v. England, 19 S.W.3d 762, 766 (Tenn. 2000).\n\n        As to guilty pleas, the petitioner must establish a reasonable probability that, but for\nthe errors of his counsel, he would not have entered the guilty plea. Hill v. Lockhart, 474\nU.S. 52, 59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985). When determining the knowing and\nvoluntary nature of a guilty plea, the standard is \u201cwhether the plea represents a voluntary and\nintelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.\u201d North\nCarolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970); see also State v.\nPettis, 986 S.W.2d 540, 542 (Tenn. 1999).\n\n        In order for a guilty plea to be voluntary, the petitioner must have an understanding\nof the charges against him and the consequences of pleading guilty, including \u201cthe sentence\nthat he will be forced to serve as a result of his guilty plea and conviction.\u201d Blankenship v.\nState, 858 S.W.2d 897, 905 (Tenn. 1993). A petitioner\u2019s solemn declaration in open court\nthat his or her plea is knowing and voluntary creates a formidable barrier in any subsequent\ncollateral proceeding because these declarations \u201ccarry a strong presumption of verity.\u201d\nBlackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S. Ct. 1621, 52 L. Ed. 2d 136 (1977).\n\n       Concerning Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea, the trial court made the following extensive\nfindings at the post-conviction hearing:\n\n       When I look at the plea form, [Petitioner], the Court so notes, got what he\n       bargained for. He got 11/29, 48 hours to serve, and he got it along with other\n       things, concurrent with parole violation and violation of order of protection.\n       So whatever happened on those, this was to be concurrent with it. That\u2019s clear\n       in the plea form from the completed signed document that I went over that day\n       in open court with the Petitioner, [ ], under oath.\n\n       [Trial counsel has] testified today that he had discussed the plea offer after the\n       first jury trial. [Trial counsel] on his own investigation evidently had found\n       out the status of the 12 jurors, 10 to 2 in favor of the State on the first trial.\n       [Trial counsel has] testified that he explained to Defendant what concurrent\n       sentencing meant in this case, and I\u2019m sure the Defendant already knew based\n\n                                              -5-\n\f       on his substantial criminal history of aggravated robberies. But he also said\n       he did not at any point make any promises as to an outcome of a parole\n       violation. And [trial counsel] has given sworn testimony, and it certainly does\n       not show in the plea form as to any promises being made. The only thing that\n       was promised was that the case that I had, that [Petitioner] pled to, would be\n       concurrent with that violation, whatever it ended up being, and the order of\n       protection violation, and [trial counsel] is very clear in his testimony. The\n       written documentation backs up [trial counsel\u2019s] position on the case.\n\n       And then I\u2019ve got to point out that I tried to be very thorough. [Petitioner]\n       ultimately has to make the decision whether he wants to plead guilty or not, but\n       this Court would not tell a defendant anything about a parole violation because\n       that\u2019s not in my jurisdiction. I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen on a\n       parole violation, and there\u2019s no way I could have promised anything to the\n       Defendant at the time of his plea regarding a parole violation that I have no\n       control over. I don\u2019t have the written verbatim transcript in front of me, but\n       I know the Court\u2019s normal procedure and policy. I don\u2019t even promise\n       defendants anything on federal pending charges when they\u2019re pleading here\n       because I cannot. Those are not the cases that I control. So the Court notes\n       that for the record, too. It\u2019s not certainly been established that the Court would\n       have in any way misled this Defendant as to what would happen on a parole\n       violation.\n\n       The bottom line is, the Court finds that based on all the sworn testimony and\n       the documentation today, that the Petitioner has not carried by clear and\n       convincing evidence the burden of proof as to the claim of ineffective\n       assistance of counsel, and the Court specifically finds that this Defendant did\n       knowingly, voluntarily, personally and intelligently make the decision to enter\n       his plea that day. It was his own personal decision of his own violation, and\n       he got everything he bargained for in the plea agreement. It\u2019s just a personal\n       problem that he\u2019s got that he got violated, and again, nobody in this room\n       could control what the parole board would do.\n\n        We conclude that the evidence does not preponderate against the trial court\u2019s findings.\nThe trial court accredited trial counsel\u2019s testimony that he made no promises to petitioner\nwith regard to the actions of the parole board or that Petitioner would be released from\ncustody after serving his forty-eight hour sentence for DUI. At the post-conviction hearing\ntrial counsel testified that he explained the offer to Petitioner and told him that the charge\nwould \u201crun concurrent with the parole violation as well as the violation of [the] order of\nprotection.\u201d Trial counsel advised Petitioner that trial counsel had \u201cno control or no say-so\n\n                                              -6-\n\fover what the parole board may do\u201d with respect to the parole violation. Trial counsel\ntestified: \u201cOnly thing I could say is this case would be run concurrent with that.\u201d The guilty\nplea agreement clearly stated that Petitioner would serve his DUI sentence concurrently with\n\u201cparole violation [and] violation of order of protection.\u201d Based upon what is included in the\nappellate record submitted by Petitioner, with no other evidence to the contrary, we find that\nPetitioner\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made with the effective\nassistance of trial counsel.\n\n       For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n                                           _______________________________________\n                                           THOMAS T.
