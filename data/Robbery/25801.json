We affirm.\n____________________________________________\n\n\n*\n    Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n1\n  Appellant filed his December 29, 2016 Notice of Appeal from the December\n12, 2016 Notice of Intent to Dismiss his PCRA Petition. Appellant\u2019s appeal,\ntherefore, was technically premature as this is not a final, appealable order.\nSee Pa.R.A.P. 301; Commonwealth v. Swartzfager, 59 A.3d 616 (Pa.\nSper. 2012). However, on January 20, 2017, the PCRA court entered an\nOrder dismissing Appellant\u2019s PCRA Petition. Accordingly, this appeal was\nperfected by entry of a final order and its merits are properly before this\nCourt. See Commonwealth v. Cooper, 27 A.3d 994, 1004 (Pa. 2011)\n(\u201cThe appeal may have been premature when filed; but the subsequent\nactions of counsel and the trial court fully ripened it.\u201d).\n\fJ-S55002-17\n\n\n\n        On September 19, 2013, a jury convicted Appellant of Robbery,\n\nAggravated      Assault,    Simple     Assault,   Terroristic    Threats,   Recklessly\n\nEndangering Another Person, Burglary, Theft by Unlawful Taking, and\n\nCriminal Conspiracy.2 The jury found that Appellant possessed and used a\n\nfirearm while committing these crimes.3 On November 26, 2013, the court\n\nsentenced     Appellant    to   an    aggregate   term   of     84   to   168   months\u2019\n\nincarceration. Appellant did not file a direct appeal; however, following the\n\nfiling of a PCRA Petition, on February 10, 2015, the PCRA court reinstated\n\nhis direct appeal rights nunc pro tunc.\n\n        On direct appeal, Appellant challenged only the trial court having\n\ndeclined to order a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether Appellant\n\nwas competent to stand trial.         After review, this Court concluded that this\n\nclaim lacked merit and affirmed Appellant\u2019s Judgment of Sentence on\n\nSeptember 22, 2015.          Commonwealth v. Hairston, No. 444 MDA 2015\n\n(Pa. Super. filed Sept. 22, 2015) (unpublished memorandum).                        The\n\nPennsylvania Supreme Court denied Appellant\u2019s Petition for Allowance of\n\nAppeal. Commonwealth v. Hairston, 136 A.3d 979 (Pa. filed March 29,\n\n2016).\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2\n 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3701(a)(1)(i); 2702(a)(4); 2701(a)(3); 2706(a)(1); 2705;\n3502(a); 3921(a); and 903, respectively.\n3\n    N.T., 3/13/15, at 172-173.\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S55002-17\n\n\n\n       On July 18, 2016, Appellant filed a Post-Sentence Motion to Modify\n\nSentence. The court treated this Motion as a PCRA Petition, and appointed\n\nPCRA counsel.       On August 15, 2016, and September 1, 2016, the PCRA\n\ncourt docketed letters that Appellant sent to his appointed counsel informing\n\nher of the issues he wanted her to raise in an amended PCRA Petition.\n\n       However, in lieu of filing an amended PCRA Petition, on November 4,\n\n2016, PCRA counsel filed a Motion to Withdraw as Counsel and a\n\nTurner/Finley4 no-merit letter, further developing the issues raised by\n\nAppellant in his PCRA Petition and subsequent letters to her, and concluding\n\nthat those issues were frivolous.\n\n       Specifically, counsel notified the court that Appellant sought to raise\n\nthe following issues in his PCRA Petition: (1) that his due process rights were\n\nviolated when he was charged as an adult, even though he was under the\n\nage of 18 at the time of the offense and no hearing was held to transfer the\n\ncase; (2) he was sentenced as a repeat felony offender, even though he\n\nnever had an adult conviction prior to this case; (3) he was sentenced under\n\na deadly weapon enhancement, even though he was never found guilty of\n\nusing or possessing a deadly weapon; and (4) he received an illegal\n\nsentence, as he was sentenced to a mandatory minimum.            See Mot. to\n\nWithdraw, 11/14/26, at \u00b6 11.\n____________________________________________\n\n\n\n4\n  See Commonwealth v. Turner, 544 A.2d 927 (Pa. 1988);\nCommonwealth v. Finley, 550 A.2d 213 (Pa. Super. 1988) (en banc).\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S55002-17\n\n\n\n      Appellant   did   not   file   a   response   to   counsel\u2019s   Motion   and\n\nTurner/Finley no-merit letter.\n\n      On December 12, 2016, the PCRA court granted counsel\u2019s Motion to\n\nWithdraw and filed a Pa.R.Crim.P. 907 Notice advising Appellant of its intent\n\nto dismiss his Petition without a hearing.      The PCRA court\u2019s Order gave\n\nAppellant 30 days in which to file a response.           Appellant did not file a\n\nresponse to the Notice; instead, on December 29, 2016, he filed a pro se\n\nNotice of Appeal. On January 13, 2017, Appellant filed a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)\n\nStatement, although not ordered to do so by the PCRA court.\n\n      On January 20, 2017, the PCRA court filed a Statement in Lieu of\n\nMemorandum Opinion in which it dismissed Appellant\u2019s Petition and adopted\n\nits December 12, 2016 Memorandum Order for purposes of compliance with\n\nRule 1925(a).\n\n      Appellant raises the following five issues on appeal, which we have\n\nreordered for ease of disposition:\n\n      [1.]   W[ere] [Appellant\u2019s] procedural and substantive due\n             process rights violated when the Commonwealth failed to\n             conduct a Pre-Sentence Investigation Report to determine\n             if a Decertification Hearing was warranted.\n\n      [2.]   Was [Appellant] given notice of accusations as it relates to\n             [the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]\n             and 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 104(3)-(4), to insure [Appellant] was\n             provided adequate and sufficient notice of the nature\n             and cause in this case.\n\n      [3.]    Were the sentences imposed upon [Appellant] illegal\n             sentences lacking statutory authorization[] when imposed\n             outside of the Sentencing Code pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n             9721(a)(a.1)(1-7)[sic].\n\n                                         -4-\n\fJ-S55002-17\n\n\n      [4.]    Does Title (18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1104 and 1301 et seq.)\n              [sic] possess any statutory authority.\n\n      [5.]    Was the Judgment of Sentencing Order completed in error\n              constituting an illegal sentence.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 3 (some capitalization omitted).\n\n      We review the denial of a PCRA Petition to determine whether the\n\nrecord supports the PCRA court\u2019s findings and whether its Order is otherwise\n\nfree of legal error.       Commonwealth v. Fears, 86 A.3d 795, 803 (Pa.\n\n2014). \u201cThe scope of review is limited to the findings of the PCRA court and\n\nthe evidence of record, viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing\n\nparty at the trial level.\u201d Commonwealth v. Spotz, 84 A.3d 294, 311 (Pa.\n\n2014) (citation omitted).\n\n      In his first issue, Appellant claims that the Commonwealth violated his\n\ndue process rights by not conducting a \u201cPre-Sentence Investigation Report\n\nto determine if a Decertification Hearing was warranted to determine\n\nwhether      this   case   should   have      been   Transfer[r]ed   From   Criminal\n\nProceedings.\u201d       Appellant\u2019s Brief at 6.   Subsumed within this claim are two\n\nalternative arguments: (1) that the trial court erred in not considering\n\ndecertification; and (2) that the trial court should have ordered a Pre-\n\nSentence Investigation Report. Id. at 6, 8, 12.\n\n      Under the PCRA, an issue is waived \u201cif the petitioner could have raised\n\nit but failed to do so before trial, at trial, during unitary review, on appeal[,]\n\nor in a prior state post[-]conviction proceeding.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b). Our\n\nreview of the record indicates that Appellant could have raised the claims of\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fJ-S55002-17\n\n\n\nerror presented in his first issue either before the trial court in a Post-\n\nSentence Motion or on direct appeal; rather he has raised them for the first\n\ntime in the instant appeal.        Accordingly, we find that Appellant has waived\n\nthis claim.5\n\n       In his second issue, Appellant avers the Commonwealth violated his\n\ndue process rights by not presenting him with \u201cFormal or Specific Notice of\n\nthe charges\u201d against him. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 14. Consequently, he argues,\n\nit was impossible for him to defend himself.6         Id. at 14-16.   Our review\n\nconfirms that that the PCRA court did not err in finding this issue meritless.\n\n       The filing of a criminal information satisfies the federal and state\n\nconstitutional requirements that a defendant be given formal, specific notice\n\nof the charged crimes.        Commonwealth v. Nischan, 928 A.2d 349, 356\n\n(Pa. Super. 2007).        Here, on January 20, 2012, Appellant signed a Notice\n\nof Arraignment, which listed the charges against him as \u201cRobbery; Agg.\n\nAssault, et al.[,]\u201d and on which he indicated his intention to plead not guilty.\n\nArraignment Notice, 1/20/12.             In addition, the Commonwealth filed a\n____________________________________________\n\n\n5\n  Moreover, Appellant\u2019s allegation that the trial court erred by not ordering a\nPre-Sentence Investigation Report is also factually inaccurate as the record\nreflects that the trial court ordered a Pre-Sentence Investigation on\nSeptember 19, 2013.\n6\n  Within this argument, Appellant also claims for the first time that his\ncounsel provided ineffective assistance. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 16. Appellant\ndoes not, however, set forth any argument in support of this sub-claim.\nAccordingly, we find it waived.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fJ-S55002-17\n\n\n\nCriminal Information on February 10, 2012, and an Amended Information on\n\nMarch 7, 2012. Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth provided\n\nAppellant with formal and specific notice of the crimes charged.\n\n     Appellant\u2019s third and fourth issues seem to be interrelated; thus, we\n\naddress them together. Although his arguments are difficult to decipher, a\n\ngenerous reading indicates Appellant is alternately claiming       that (1) his\n\nsentence is illegal because the court sentenced him outside of the\n\nSentencing Code; and, (2) because the legislature separated the Sentencing\n\nCode from the Crimes Code, the court lacked authority to impose a\n\nsentence.   Appellant\u2019s Brief at 22-28.     Appellant also seems to argue,\n\nwithout citing to any relevant authority, that only mandatory minimum\n\nsentences are enforceable. Id. at 23, 27.\n\n     Appellant\u2019s argument is heavily reliant on his belief that \u201c[t]he most\n\nimportant matter that needs to be understood is that almost all of the\n\nSentencing Authority that Courts or Judges possessed before 1980 was\n\nstripped from the Courts when the Sentencing Code was [s]eparated from\n\nthe Crimes Code.\u201d Id. at 22, 27. Appellant avers that his sentence \u201ccame\n\nfrom the Crimes Code (Title 18 Pa.C.S.), which is an illegal sentencing\n\nscheme that lacks \u2018Statutory Authorization.\u2019\u201d Id. at 24.\n\n     Appellant\u2019s argument demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding\n\nof the purpose and function of, and the distinction between, the Sentencing\n\nand Crimes Codes. The trial court derives its sentencing authority from the\n\nSentencing Code, while the Crimes Code sets forth the acts that the\n\n                                    -7-\n\fJ-S55002-17\n\n\n\nlegislature has deemed criminal and defines the elements of those offenses.\n\nThe jury convicted Appellant under the Crimes Code, and the judge\n\nsentenced him to a term of incarceration under the Sentencing Code, as the\n\nlegislature has authorized it to do pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721(a)\n\n(delineating    sentencing     alternatives    available     to    the   trial     court).\n\nAccordingly, the PCRA court did not err in concluding that Appellant\u2019s claim\n\nthat the trial court lacked authority to sentence him was without merit.\n\n      In his last issue, Appellant alleges that his sentence is illegal both\n\nbecause the trial court failed to adequately indicate on the Judgment of\n\nSentence the statutes pursuant to which it was sentencing him, and because\n\nthis failure violated his due process rights. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 18-21.\n\n      Generally,    illegal   sentence   claims   are      not    waivable;      however,\n\nconstitutional due process sentencing claims are waived if they are raised for\n\nthe first time on appeal.      Commonwealth v. Stultz, 114 A.3d 865, 885\n\n(Pa. Super. 2015) (citing Commonwealth v. Wallace, 533 A.2d 1051,\n\n1054 (Pa. Super. 1987) (explaining that constitutional challenges, even\n\nsentencing challenges based on the constitution, are waived if they are not\n\n\u201craised and preserved at each level of the criminal proceeding in order that\n\nthe reviewing court will have the benefit of the lower court record on these\n\nissues.\u201d)).    Our review of the record indicates that Appellant raised this\n\nconstitutional sentencing claim for the first time in his Rule 1925(b)\n\nStatement, and not in a Post-Sentence Motion.              Thus, we find this issue\n\nwaived. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b).\n\n                                         -8-\n\fJ-S55002-17\n\n\n\n         Even if Appellant had not waived this issue, it would not merit relief.\n\nThis Court has held that, where a court has the authority to impose a\n\nsentence, its failure to cite a statute in the Sentencing Order does not result\n\nin an illegal sentence.     Stultz, supra at 885.     Here, the trial court had\n\nauthority pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721 (\u201cSentencing generally\u201d) and 42\n\nPa.C.S. \u00a7 9756 (\u201cSentence of total confinement\u201d) to impose a prison\n\nsentence following Appellant\u2019s convictions.      Accordingly, Appellant\u2019s claim\n\nfails.\n\n         Order affirmed.\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
