            "opinion_text": "        SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK\n           Appellate Division, Fourth Judicial Department\n\n1291\nKA 11-01988\nPRESENT: SMITH, J.P., PERADOTTO, LINDLEY, VALENTINO, AND WHALEN, JJ.\n\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, RESPONDENT,\n\n                    V                               MEMORANDUM AND ORDER\n\nERIC BLACKSHEAR, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.\n\n\nDONALD R. GERACE, UTICA, FOR DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.\n\nSCOTT D. MCNAMARA, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, UTICA (STEVEN G. COX OF\nCOUNSEL), FOR RESPONDENT.\n\n\n     Appeal from a judgment of the Oneida County Court (Barry M.\nDonalty, J.), rendered May 5, 2011. The judgment convicted defendant,\nupon a jury verdict, of murder in the second degree (three counts),\nrobbery in the first degree (two counts), burglary in the first degree\n(two counts), burglary in the second degree and criminal possession of\na weapon in the second degree.\n\n     It is hereby ORDERED that the judgment so appealed from is\nunanimously modified on the law by directing that the sentence imposed\nunder count eight of the indictment for criminal possession of a\nweapon in the second degree shall run concurrently with the sentences\nimposed under counts five and six for burglary in the first degree,\nand as modified the judgment is affirmed.\n\n     Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him\nfollowing a jury verdict of three counts of murder in the second\ndegree (Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 [1], [3]), two counts of robbery in the\nfirst degree (\u00a7 160.15 [2], [4]), two counts of burglary in the first\ndegree (\u00a7 140.30 [1], [4]), burglary in the second degree (\u00a7 140.25\n[2]), and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree (\u00a7\n265.03 [1] [b]). The charges stemmed from an incident in which\ndefendant and two others broke into the residence of the victim, shot\nthe victim, and stole both money and personal items from the\nresidence. One of the others (codefendant) was tried jointly with\ndefendant; the other (accomplice) testified, pursuant to a plea\nagreement, for the People at defendant\u2019s and codefendant\u2019s trial.\n\n     Defendant contends that County Court improperly received in\nevidence items other than cash that the accomplice stole during the\nincident because the charges in the indictment were limited to cash.\nThat contention is not preserved for our review (see CPL 470.05 [2]).\nIn any event, the contention is without merit inasmuch as admission of\nthe other items in evidence did not allow the People to amend the\n\f                                 -2-                          1291\n                                                         KA 11-01988\n\nindictment improperly (see People v Dawson, 79 AD3d 1610, 1611, lv\ndenied 16 NY3d 894; see generally People v Grega, 72 NY2d 489, 497-\n498).\n\n     Defendant contends that the testimony of the accomplice is not\nsupported by sufficient corroborative evidence (see CPL 60.22 [1]).\nWe reject that contention. One of the victims testified that the man\nwho held her captive in her bedroom during the incident was wearing\nthe same type of clothing and shoes as the accomplice testified to\nwearing. Another witness testified that the accomplice displayed to\nhim items stolen during the crime. A third witness testified that the\naccomplice told her, when he appeared at her house with defendant and\ncodefendant after the incident, that he needed to get rid of phones\nthat were stolen during the crime. The testimony of those witnesses,\namong others, \u201ctended to connect [defendant] to the crime and\nharmonized with the narrative provided by the accomplice[] . . . ,\nsuch that the jury [could have been] reasonably satisfied that the\naccomplice[] w[as] telling the truth\u201d (People v Davis, 114 AD3d 1287,\n1287 [internal quotation marks omitted]).\n\n     In addition to the evidence described above, a witness testified\nthat defendant came to her apartment shortly after the incident\ncarrying a .44 caliber revolver, the same caliber as the weapon used\nin the murder, according to the trial testimony of a firearms\nexaminer. Furthermore, the witness heard defendant say that he had\nshot the victim and \u201cc[ouldn\u2019t] believe what [he] did today.\u201d The\nPeople also presented evidence, which the jury reasonably could have\ncredited, that defendant\u2019s DNA was found on a $100 bill that they\nalleged was stolen from the murder victim. Thus, contrary to\ndefendant\u2019s contention, the evidence, viewed in the light most\nfavorable to the People (see People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620, 621), is\nlegally sufficient to support the conviction (see generally People v\nBleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495). Viewing the evidence in light of the\nelements of the crimes as charged to the jury (see People v Danielson,\n9 NY3d 342, 349), we conclude that the verdict is not against the\nweight of the evidence (see generally Bleakley, 69 NY2d at 495).\n\n     Defendant failed to preserve for our review his contention that\nthe court was required to instruct the jury on the People\u2019s heightened\nburden of proof in cases based entirely on circumstantial evidence,\ninasmuch as defendant did not request that instruction or object to\nthe court\u2019s failure to give it (see People v Recore, 56 AD3d 1233,\n1234, lv denied 12 NY3d 761; People v Ponder, 19 AD3d 1041, 1042-1043,\nlv denied 5 NY3d 809). In any event, the contention is without merit.\nThe instruction is not warranted where the charges \u201care supported by\nboth circumstantial and direct evidence\u201d (People v Stanford, 87 AD3d\n1367, 1369, lv denied 18 NY3d 886; see People v Daddona, 81 NY2d 990,\n992). Here, defendant\u2019s guilt was supported by some direct evidence,\ni.e., eyewitness testimony and admissions made by defendant.\n\n     Defendant also failed to preserve for our review his contention\nthat the court improperly failed to discharge a sworn juror as\n\u201cgrossly unqualified\u201d (CPL 270.35 [1]; see People v Buford, 69 NY2d\n290, 298). In any event, when the court was made aware during the\n\f                                 -3-                          1291\n                                                         KA 11-01988\n\ntrial that one of the jurors might have failed to disclose that she\nhad previously been convicted of a misdemeanor and that she might have\nbeen familiar with the murder victim\u2019s family, the court conducted\n\u201c \u2018a probing and tactful inquiry\u2019 into the facts of the situation\u201d\n(People v Harris, 99 NY2d 202, 213, quoting Buford, 69 NY2d at 299).\nDefense counsel thereafter stated that he was satisfied with the\ncourt\u2019s inquiry and did not ask that the juror be disqualified.\nMoreover, there is nothing in the record establishing that the court,\nwhich had the opportunity of observing and speaking with the juror\nfirsthand, did not properly conclude that the juror was qualified to\nserve.\n\n     Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that all the terms of\nimprisonment should run concurrently (see People v Yong Yun Lee, 92\nNY2d 987, 988-989), but we agree with defendant that the court erred\nin ordering the term of imprisonment imposed for criminal possession\nof a weapon in the second degree to run consecutively with the terms\nof imprisonment imposed for burglary in the first degree (see People v\nHamilton, 4 NY3d 654, 659; see generally People v Laureano, 87 NY2d\n640, 643). We therefore modify the sentence accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nEntered:   February 6, 2015                     Frances E. Cafarell\n                                                Clerk of the Court\n\f",
