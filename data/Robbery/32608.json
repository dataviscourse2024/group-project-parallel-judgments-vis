The application was made on the ground that defendant was not advised of his right to counsel. Order affirmed. Defendant\u2019s claim that he was not advised of his right to counsel is clearly rebutted by positive testimony in this record to the contrary. Nolan, P. J., Beldock, Kleinfeld, Pette and Brennan, JJ., concur.\n",
