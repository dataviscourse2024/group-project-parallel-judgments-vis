him guilty and\r\npunishment was assessed at 30 years=\r\nimprisonment by the court.\u00a0 He raises two\r\nissues on appeal:\u00a0 that the evidence is\r\nlegally and factually insufficient to sustain his conviction in that it failed\r\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant used or exhibited a deadly\r\nweapon.\u00a0 We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 21, 2002,\r\nAnita Perez was robbed while working at the City Public Service Electric.\u00a0 She was alone in the office between 10 and\r\n10:30 in the morning when somebody knocked on the door.\u00a0 She looked out the window and saw a man\r\nstanding outside with his back to her.\u00a0\r\nThinking he was a company employee, she opened the door and asked what\r\nhe was doing.\u00a0 At first, she could not see\r\nhis face because he was looking down, going through a Guess paper shopping bag.\u00a0 When he looked up, she saw that his face was\r\nmasked with a black bandana, and she began to scream and tried to push the door\r\nclosed.\u00a0 He pushed back on the door, and\r\nat some point in the struggle, pulled something out of the bag and told her to AShut up and stop screaming.@\u00a0\r\nMrs. Perez testified that he pulled a silver and black handgun out of\r\nthe bag.\r\n\r\nThe robber pushed\r\nMrs. Perez away from the door, entered the office, and locked the door behind\r\nhim.\u00a0 He told her to lay flat on the\r\nfloor and warned her not to look up or he would shoot her.\u00a0 He tied her hands and ankles together and\r\nasked her where the company checks were located.\u00a0 She told him they were no longer kept in the\r\noffice, and were with her boss.\u00a0 He\r\nlooked around the office for the checks for several minutes, and when he was\r\nsatisfied that they were not there, he decided to take her purse containing her\r\npersonal checks, her husband=s\r\npersonal checks, and her credit cards instead.\u00a0\r\nShe told him, she banked at Compass Bank several minutes away.\r\n\r\nAt that point,\r\nMrs. Perez=s sister\r\narrived at the office and began knocking on the door and calling to her.\u00a0 Appellant picked up Mrs. Perez and moved her\r\nto a back room, paced nervously for a little while, then ran out the back\r\ndoor.\u00a0 Mrs. Perez managed to free herself\r\nand opened the door for her sister but not before the sister saw Appellant\r\nrunning away around the side of the building.\u00a0\r\nShe then called the police to report the robbery, and called the bank to\r\nwarn them that Appellant might try to cash a check with her account.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral hours\r\nlater, Appellant went in the Compass Bank and tried to cash one of the stolen\r\nchecks with Candace Korinek, a senior teller.\u00a0\r\nShe noticed immediately that he was acting strangely, and that there was\r\nsomething wrong with the check.\u00a0 She\r\ndescribed him as being Akind\r\nof fidgety with his hand@\r\nand noticed that he would not make eye contact with her.\u00a0 There were inconsistencies between the number\r\nand written amounts on the check, and other things on the check were\r\nmisspelled.\u00a0 She went into a back room\r\nand spoke with her manager who informed her of the phone call the bank had\r\nreceived several hours before from Mrs. Perez.\u00a0\r\nThe bank contacted Mrs. Perez and the police, and stalled Appellant in\r\nthe lobby.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nOfficer Julie\r\nWilliams approached Appellant in the lobby of the bank, placed handcuffs on\r\nhim, and walked him toward her car.\u00a0 He\r\nbroke free and ran from Officer Williams who followed him in her car and\r\neventually took him into custody again.\u00a0\r\nShe collected the check and the false identification he had given the\r\nbank and sent someone to pick up Mrs. Perez so she could identify\r\nAppellant.\u00a0 Mrs. Perez made a positive\r\nidentification, and Appellant was fingerprinted and arrested.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\nOF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the\r\nlegal sufficiency of the evidence, the court must consider all the evidence,\r\nstate and defense, in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine\r\nwhether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 Jackson v.\r\nVirginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 2788-89, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560\r\n(1979).\u00a0 This standard gives deference to\r\nthe trier of fact to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence,\r\nand to draw reasonable inferences from basic to ultimate facts.\u00a0 Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. At\r\n2789.\u00a0 We do not resolve any conflict of\r\nfact or assign credibility to the witnesses, as it was the function of the\r\ntrier of fact to do so.\u00a0 Adelman v.\r\nState, 828 S.W.2d 418, 421 (Tex.Crim.App. 1992).\u00a0 Instead, our duty is only to determine if\r\nboth the explicit and implicit findings of the trier of fact are rational by\r\nviewing all of the evidence admitted at trial in a light most favorable to the\r\nverdict.\u00a0 Adelman, 828 S.W.2d at\r\n421-22.\u00a0 As such, any inconsistencies in\r\nthe evidence are resolved in favor of the verdict.\u00a0 Matson v. State, 819 S.W.2d 839, 843\r\n(Tex.Crim.App. 1991).\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the\r\nfactual sufficiency of the evidence, we must consider all the evidence, but we\r\ndo not view it in the light most favorable to the verdict.\u00a0 Clewis v. State, 922 S.W.2d 126, 129\r\n(Tex.Crim.App. 1996).\u00a0 Instead, we review\r\nthe evidence weighed by the fact finder that tends to prove the existence of\r\nthe elemental fact in dispute and compare it with the evidence that tends to\r\ndisprove the fact.\u00a0 Johnson v. State,\r\n23 S.W.3d 1, 7 (Tex.Crim.App. 2000).\u00a0 A\r\ndefendant may raise a factual sufficiency challenge in one of two ways.\u00a0 He may allege the evidence is so weak as to\r\nbe clearly wrong or manifestly unjust or, in a case where the defendant has\r\noffered contrary evidence, he may argue that the finding of guilt is against\r\nthe great weight of the evidence.\u00a0 Johnson,\r\n23 S.W.3d at 11.\u00a0 We are not free to\r\nreweigh the evidence and set aside the verdict merely because we feel that a\r\ndifferent result is more reasonable.\u00a0 Cain\r\nv. State, 958 S.W.2d 404, 407 (Tex.Crim.App. 1997).\u00a0 What weight to give contradictory testimonial\r\nevidence is within the sole province of the jury because it turns on an\r\nevaluation of credibility and demeanor.\u00a0 Id.\r\n\r\nAppellant does not\r\ndispute that he committed a robbery by stealing the checks from Mrs.\u00a0Perez\r\nand threatening her with serious bodily injury.\u00a0\r\nHe contends merely that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt that he used or exhibited a deadly weapon, and thus the evidence was\r\nlegally and factually insufficient to convict him of aggravated robbery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the\r\nrecord, we find the following evidence relevant to a legal sufficiency\r\nreview.\u00a0 The victim testified that she\r\nsaw Appellant pull a gun out from the paper bag.\u00a0 She testified that it was silver and black,\r\nand that Appellant repeatedly threatened her, suggesting that if she did not do\r\nas he said, he would shoot her.\u00a0 When\r\nasked to identify the type of weapon to a police officer, the victim described\r\nthe gun as a semi-automatic weapon Alike\r\nthe police carry@ as\r\nopposed to a pistol used in Western movies.\u00a0\r\nThe victim repeatedly insisted that she saw a handgun in relaying her\r\nstory to the police on the phone, to her sister, to the police officer who\r\nresponded to her call, and in court.\u00a0\r\nPolice found a bullet in the bag Appellant left at the scene.\u00a0 Finally, approximately two hours passed between\r\nthe time the victim called the police, and the time that Appellant arrived at\r\nCompass Bank to cash a check.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nAppellant argues\r\nessentially that Mrs. Perez=s\r\ntestimony lacked detail, and was insufficient without more support to warrant\r\nthe verdict.\u00a0 However, the trier of fact\r\nwas free to accept or reject any portion of the witness=s\r\ntestimony, and could have rejected Mrs. Perez=s\r\nassertion that Appellant used a gun.\u00a0 See\r\nAdelman v. State, 828 S.W.2d 418, 422 (Tex.Crim.App. 1992).\u00a0 Further, Texas law insists that direct\r\ntestimony of a fact is always legally sufficient to support a finding of that\r\nfact.\u00a0 See Goodman v. State, 66\r\nS.W.3d 283, 286 (Tex.Crim.App. 2001).\u00a0\r\nThe Goodman case offers a hypothetical example.\u00a0 A witness testifies, AI\r\nsaw the defendant put the baggie of cocaine down on the sidewalk.@\u00a0\r\nThe jury is free to accept or reject the witness=s\r\ntestimony, but if the jury believes him, then the witness=s testimony conclusively proves that\r\nspecific point.\u00a0 Id.\u00a0 In the instant case, Mrs. Perez testified\r\nthat she saw Appellant pull a gun out of his bag.\u00a0 The jury believed her, and the point was\r\ntherefore conclusively proven.\u00a0 Viewing\r\nthis evidence in a light favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could\r\nreasonably have concluded that Appellant exhibited a firearm during the\r\ncommission of the robbery.\u00a0 We overrule\r\nIssue One.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn evaluating the\r\nfactual sufficiency of the evidence, we must weigh all the evidence balancing\r\nthat which supports the verdict with that which contradicts it.\u00a0 In this case, however, Appellant offered no\r\nevidence to contradict Mrs. Perez=s\r\nclaim.\u00a0 Mrs. Perez insisted that\r\nAppellant exhibited a gun and she repeated this in her testimony before the\r\njury.\u00a0 Appellant argues several points\r\nclaiming to rebut this testimony.\u00a0 First,\r\nhe alleges that she could not adequately describe the gun.\u00a0 He points out further that she did not see\r\nthe gun again after the initial brief sighting, that no other witnesses\r\nobserved Appellant with the weapon, and that no gun was ever found.\u00a0 However, none of this evidence directly\r\ncontradicts Mrs. Perez=s\r\nassertion that he pulled a gun from the bag immediately before entering the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nThe evidence also\r\noffers rational explanations for each of the assertions Appellant makes.\u00a0 Mrs. Perez testified that she did not look up\r\nfrom her position face-down on the floor after he threatened to shoot her if\r\nshe did.\u00a0 This would account for her not\r\nseeing the gun again during the commission of the offense.\u00a0 The fact that no other witnesses saw him with\r\na gun, and that no gun was found does not contradict her assertion.\u00a0 Mrs. Perez=s\r\nsister testified that she could not see his hands as he was running from the\r\nscene, so she did not know whether he was carrying a gun or not.\u00a0 She certainly did not rule out the\r\npossibility that he could have been carrying a gun at the time.\u00a0 It is true that he displayed no weapon at\r\nCompass Bank and none was ever recovered.\u00a0\r\nHowever, he had ample time and opportunity to discard the gun in the two\r\nhours between the robbery and his appearance at the bank, so these facts are\r\nnot conclusive.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven all the\r\nevidence, a rational jury could have concluded that Appellant exhibited a gun\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 A verdict is\r\nnot manifestly unjust merely because the jury resolved conflicting views of the\r\nevidence in favor of the state.\u00a0 Cain,\r\n958 S.W.2d at 410.\u00a0 Absent contradictory\r\nevidence, the jury was free to infer from Mrs. Perez=s\r\ntestimony that a gun was exhibited during the robbery.\u00a0 The evidence to support the jury=s finding that Appellant used a deadly\r\nweapon is not so weak as to be clearly wrong or manifestly unjust, nor is it\r\ncontrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence.\u00a0 Issue Two is overruled.\r\n\r\nThe trial court=s judgment is affirmed.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nJuly\r\n22, 2004\r\n\r\nDAVID WELLINGTON\r\nCHEW, Justice\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nBefore Panel No. 3\r\n\r\nBarajas, C.J., Larsen, and Chew, JJ.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n(Do Not Publish)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
