The circuit court\n        of Peoria County entered judgment on the felony murder count, as well as the unlawful\n        possession of a firearm by a felon count, sentencing him to natural life for the former and 14\n        years in prison for the latter. Defendant appeals, claiming the trial court erred: (1) in refusing\n        to instruct the jury as to self-defense; (2) in allowing the State to impeach defendant with a\n        prior conviction; and (3) in assessing $2,444.50 in fees. We affirm defendant\u2019s convictions,\n        but modify the assessment of certain fines and fees.\n\n\u00b62                                        BACKGROUND\n\u00b63          Defendant shot and killed Johnny Whitehead on December 1, 2009. When police officers\n        arrived on the scene, he shot at the officers and attempted to flee. Following his\n        apprehension, the State indicted defendant for numerous crimes associated with the incident.\n\u00b64          The seven-count indictment, filed December 8, 2009, accuses defendant of: (1) felony\n        murder (720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(3) (West 2008)) for killing Johnny Whitehead without legal\n        justification during the commission of armed robbery (720 ILCS 5/18-2(a)(2) (West 2008));\n        (2) first degree murder for shooting Johnny Whitehead with the intent to kill (720 ILCS 5/9-\n        1(a)(1) (West 2008)); (3) aggravated discharge of a firearm (720 ILCS 5/24-1.2(a)(3) (West\n        2008)) for discharging a firearm in the direction of a peace officer; (4) armed robbery (720\n        ILCS 5/18-2(a)(2) (West 2008)) for taking currency from Johnny Whitehead by threatening\n        the imminent use of force while armed with a handgun; (5) armed robbery (720 ILCS 5/18-\n        2(a)(2) (West 2008)) for taking currency from Daisy Whitehead by threatening the imminent\n        use of force while armed with a handgun; (6) home invasion (720 ILCS 5/12-11(a)(3) (West\n        2008)) for intentionally using force, which caused great bodily harm against Johnny\n        Whitehead after entering his dwelling while armed with a handgun and having reason to\n\n\n                                                   -2-\n\f       know someone was present; and (7) unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon (720 ILCS\n       5/24-1.1(a) (West 2008)).\n\u00b65          Prior to trial, defendant indicated that he wanted to represent himself. The trial court\n       granted defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se and the trial commenced.\n\u00b66          Daisy Whitehead testified that on December 1, 2009, she lived with her son, Johnny, and\n       grandson. She left their apartment around 8 a.m., but realized she forgot her phone in the\n       apartment. Walking out of her apartment after retrieving her phone, she was struck in the\n       stomach and told to go back into the apartment by defendant. She took defendant into a\n       bedroom where Johnny was talking on the phone. Defendant, armed with a handgun, ordered\n       Johnny to hang up the phone and demanded money while threatening to kill Daisy.\n       Defendant then took an unspecified amount of money from Johnny, as well as Daisy\u2019s coin\n       purse, which contained approximately $100. Someone knocked on the door. Johnny told\n       defendant it was the police knocking. Defendant went to answer the door. Once he left the\n       bedroom, Johnny closed the door and told Daisy to get a phone, but she could not find one.\n       Daisy then heard six gunshots. Johnny then fell through the bedroom door, knocking it off\n       its hinges. Daisy then heard four more gunshots, followed by defendant\u2019s reentry into the\n       bedroom. Defendant ran across the bedroom and jumped out the window. Daisy walked out\n       the front door, passing Johnny, who was facedown, bleeding and unresponsive. Once outside,\n       Daisy observed defendant come around a corner of the building and she heard more\n       gunshots.\n\u00b67          The defendant began his cross-examination of Daisy by informing her that he \u201ccan\u2019t\n       begin to express the amount of regret\u201d he has for the incident. During cross-examination,\n       Daisy reiterated that the shots, which killed her son, came through the closed bedroom door.\n\u00b68          Angela Blue testified that she was Johnny\u2019s fianc\u00e9e; she was on the phone with him when\n       she heard a male\u2019s voice tell Johnny to put his hands up. She heard Johnny tell the man not\n       to shoot and to take whatever he wanted. She asked Johnny to tell her whom he was talking\n       to, but Johnny did not answer. She then called 911 and rushed over to the apartment with her\n       son. She knocked on the door to the apartment, but received no response.\n\u00b69          Angela stated that she witnessed two officers approach, so she explained what she knew.\n       One of the officers knocked on the door and stepped up a short flight of stairs to one side.\n       A voice answered \u201cWho is it?\u201d then defendant opened the door holding a gun. Defendant\n       pointed the gun at Angela and ordered her into the apartment. The officer told defendant to\n       \u201cFreeze, don\u2019t move,\u201d but defendant lifted his gun. The officer fired shots at defendant.\n       Defendant fired shots back at the officer. Angela, her son, and a second officer ran back into\n       the parking lot. While running, she heard four more shots.\n\u00b6 10        Angela then called 911 for a second time from the parking lot to tell the operator about\n       the shooting. More police arrived shortly and she observed defendant come around the side\n       of the apartment building. She yelled, \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d Nearby officers ordered defendant to\n       freeze, but defendant fired at them.\n\u00b6 11        Officer Calvin Jones testified that he was dispatched to the apartment complex for a\n       suspected home invasion in progress. The original address given was incorrect. Upon arrival,\n       he made contact with Angela, who led him to the correct apartment. When defendant\n\n                                                -3-\n\f       answered the door, Jones yelled \u201cGun.\u201d Defendant fired twice filling the breezeway with\n       smoke.\n\u00b6 12       Officer Jones then alerted Officer Hill to the scenario, after which time Hill took a\n       defensive position atop the breezeway stairs. Jones heard two to three more shots inside the\n       apartment, then he witnessed defendant come around the side of the building with gun still\n       in hand. Defendant raised his gun; Jones fired at defendant; defendant retreated around the\n       side of the building.\n\u00b6 13       Officer Hill testified that he and Officer Jones were dispatched to the building for a home\n       invasion in progress. Hill\u2019s testimony substantially mirrored Jones\u2019s testimony. Hill also\n       observed defendant making a \u201cshh\u2019ing\u201d gesture toward Angela and her son.\n\u00b6 14       Lieutenant Mike White testified that he responded to the apartment complex as\n       commander of the special response team. Dispatch informed White that it was in contact\n       with someone inside the apartment named David, who wanted to come out. White talked to\n       David, who claimed he was bleeding from the jaw. White led a team into the apartment,\n       where they found a man unresponsive on the floor. Blood pooled underneath the man and\n       a gun lay nearby.\n\u00b6 15       Detective Matt Ray testified regarding a videotaped \u201cwalk-through\u201d of the area. The State\n       played the videotape for the jury. Ray noted the videotape failed to show any shell casings\n       outside the front door of the apartment.\n\u00b6 16       Officer Javier Grow testified that he helped secure the apartment. He immediately saw\n       the decedent lying facedown with a gun next to the decedent\u2019s head. Grow kicked the gun\n       away. One of the bedroom doors was off its hinges and on the ground. Grow used a pair of\n       diagrams to show the layout of the apartment and describe where he found certain forensic\n       evidence. Five shell casings were found in the apartment, including two underneath the\n       victim\u2019s body.\n\u00b6 17       Eric Ellis testified that he is a member of the crime scene unit. He gathered physical\n       evidence from the scene. He collected Officer Jones\u2019s service weapon and the handgun from\n       inside the apartment. Ellis described: a .40-caliber shell casing found outside the apartment\n       building; blood on the outside of the ground floor window; a scuff mark in the dirt outside\n       the apartment; .380-caliber shell casings found inside the apartment; damage to the fallen\n       bedroom door; copper jacketing of a bullet that fell out of a bloody sweatshirt inside the\n       apartment; and the lead core of a bullet found inside the apartment. Ellis acknowledged that\n       a substance found inside a shoe in the apartment appeared to be crack cocaine, but he was\n       not involved in the testing of that substance.\n\u00b6 18       Other evidence admitted during trial indicated that four bullets recovered from the\n       decedent\u2019s body were fired from the CZ Makarov handgun recovered at the scene. The\n       .40-caliber shell casing found outside the building came from Officer Jones\u2019s service\n       weapon.\n\u00b6 19       Officer Steve Garner testified that he rode in the ambulance transporting defendant\n       following the incident. Paramedics retrieved a purse containing money from defendant\u2019s\n       pocket. The money from defendant\u2019s pocket and from the purse totaled $729.14. Garner took\n       a picture of Daisy holding the coin purse later at the police department.\n\n                                                -4-\n\f\u00b6 20       Yohni Brown testified that she and defendant have a son together. On the day of the\n       incident, she called defendant to ask him to take her to work to pick up a check and then\n       watch their son. When defendant arrived, he told Yohni to drive and directed her to the\n       Timberlane Apartments. Yohni noted the two went there to buy marijuana. Defendant went\n       inside, then called her a few minutes later asking her to come inside as well. Once inside,\n       Yohni saw that defendant had a gun and thought that he was committing a robbery.\n\u00b6 21       Once inside the apartment, Yohni witnessed a woman praying while a man said, \u201cYou\n       want to take something, take it and go.\u201d Defendant waived the gun at the two in the\n       apartment and instructed Yohni to go through the clothes, which she did. Yohni subsequently\n       pled guilty to armed robbery and received an 18-year sentence.\n\u00b6 22       Defendant testified in his own defense, claiming that two days prior to the incident, he\n       gave Johnny money for cocaine and marijuana. Normally, defendant would give Johnny\n       money for a drug transaction, then receive a call in a few days to come retrieve the drugs.\n       Since he received no call this time, he went to the apartment to inquire about the transaction.\n\u00b6 23       Defendant claimed that when arriving at the apartment, he encountered Daisy exiting and\n       informed her he was there to discuss money that Johnny owed him. Daisy then led defendant\n       into Johnny\u2019s bedroom, where the three argued over money until Johnny pulled a gun. Upon\n       seeing Johnny\u2019s gun, defendant ran, closing the bedroom door behind him. The door came\n       off the hinges as Johnny and the defendant struggled.\n\u00b6 24       Defendant further testified that he managed to grab the gun from Johnny\u2019s hand, which\n       changed Johnny\u2019s demeanor. Johnny offered defendant a television and other items, yet\n       defendant was only interested in drugs or money. He instructed Yohni to come into the house\n       to search for either. The argument continued until Johnny instructed Daisy to give defendant\n       her coin purse.\n\u00b6 25       Defendant stated that he next heard a knock at the door so he opened it to find Angela.\n       He knew Angela participated in Johnny\u2019s drug dealing so he invited her into the apartment.\n       When Angela stepped back from the door, defendant saw a police officer with a gun.\n       Realizing that he was also holding a gun, defendant jumped back and slammed the door.\n       Defendant\u2019s gun discharged toward the ceiling when the door slammed. Upon turning\n       around, defendant observed Johnny charging at him. Thinking it odd that someone would\n       charge an armed man, defendant surmised that Johnny must also be armed so he pointed the\n       gun at Johnny and instructed Johnny to cease the attack. Johnny continued advancing, which\n       defendant stated scared him.\n\u00b6 26       Defendant noted that he did not want to shoot Johnny. The two made contact and\n       struggled, during which time Johnny pushed defendant into a glass table. Believing he was\n       about to be overpowered, defendant closed his eyes and started firing. Thereafter, he\n       panicked and fled out the bedroom window where he encountered officers with guns drawn.\n       One officer fired, hitting defendant. Defendant retreated, reentering the apartment through\n       the same bedroom window.\n\u00b6 27       Defendant testified that when he reentered the apartment, his face was numb so he\n       searched for something to stop the bleeding. Still in a panic, he made several phone calls to\n       family and 911. Eventually, since police assured him he would not be harmed again, he\n\n                                                -5-\n\f       exited the apartment and was placed in an ambulance.\n\u00b6 28       During cross-examination, defendant indicated that he had no weapon upon arrival at the\n       apartment. The sole purpose for his visit was to seek a refund or, in the alternative, the drugs\n       for which he paid two days prior. Even after disarming Johnny and coming into possession\n       of the handgun, defendant repeated his pleas for either the drugs or a return of his advance.\n       Defendant claimed that at no time did he ever demand Johnny\u2019s money, a television set, or\n       other items. He did not seek law enforcement assistance given his status as a known felon.\n       Moreover, immediately after the shooting, he did not contemplate relinquishing possession\n       of the gun, as he was consumed with thoughts of fleeing.\n\u00b6 29       Defendant called Officer Garner back to the stand. The officer testified that ballistics\n       matched the gun used to kill Johnny with a July of 2009 homicide. Officer Garner noted that\n       defendant was incarcerated in July of 2009. The defense rested after Garner\u2019s testimony.\n\u00b6 30       In rebuttal, the State asked to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction to\n       impeach his credibility. Over defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court allowed the State to\n       introduce the evidence. The trial court also allowed defendant to introduce evidence of\n       Yohni\u2019s two prior convictions.\n\u00b6 31       At the instructions conference, defendant asked for a mitigating instruction, as well as\n       a lesser-included-offense instruction. Specifically, the defendant requested an instruction on\n       self-defense and second degree murder. The trial court refused defendant\u2019s requests.\n\u00b6 32       The jury returned guilty verdicts for armed robbery, unlawful possession of a firearm by\n       a felon, and both intentional first degree murder and first degree felony murder. The jury\n       acquitted defendant of home invasion and aggravated discharge of a firearm.\n\u00b6 33       The trial court entered judgment only on the felony murder conviction and the unlawful\n       possession of a firearm by a felon conviction, sentencing defendant, respectively, to natural\n       life in prison and 14 years\u2019 incarceration. The trial court also ordered defendant to pay\n       $2,444.50 in fees. Defendant made an oral motion to reconsider that was denied. This appeal\n       followed.\n\n\u00b6 34                                           ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 35        Defendant raises three issues on appeal. Initially the defendant contends that the trial\n       court erred when refusing to instruct the jury on self-defense and second degree murder.\n       Next, defendant asserts that the trial court erred by allowing the State to introduce evidence\n       of defendant\u2019s prior conviction for impeachment purposes. Finally, defendant asserts that the\n       trial court erred in assessing certain fees against him, namely: the $200 deoxyribonucleic acid\n       (DNA) analysis fee; the $100 public defender fee; the $530 State\u2019s Attorney fee; and the\n       Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund fee. Defendant takes no issue with other fees\n       assessed against him.\n\n\u00b6 36                                  I. Jury Instructions\n\u00b6 37      Noting that the State charged him with intentional first degree murder, as well as first\n       degree felony murder, defendant argues that given the evidence adduced at trial, he was\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f       entitled to have the jury instructed on both self-defense and second degree murder. Defendant\n       claims his testimony indicated that he was in fear for his life when he shot Johnny\n       Whitehead. As such, defendant argues he is entitled to both a self-defense instruction and a\n       lesser-included-offense instruction; that being second degree murder.\n\u00b6 38       The State correctly notes this issue is forfeited. A defendant must make a timely\n       objection and address the alleged error in a written posttrial motion to preserve the issue for\n       review. People v. Enoch, 122 Ill. 2d 176, 190 (1988). Defendant acknowledges that he failed\n       to properly preserve this issue, yet asks us to review the matter for plain error. We find we\n       need not review this matter under plain error, as there is no relief we can grant defendant\n       even if we were to find that the trial court committed plain error when refusing the\n       instruction.\n\u00b6 39       The trial court entered judgment of conviction for only first degree felony murder (720\n       ILCS 5/9-1(a)(3) (West 2008)) and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon (720 ILCS\n       5/24-1.1(a) (West 2008)). As our supreme court has made clear, to \u201cbe convicted of murder\n       under the felony-murder doctrine, the accused need not have intended to kill. [Citations.]\n       Too, self-defense cannot be used as a defense to a charge of felony murder.\u201d People v.\n       Moore, 95 Ill. 2d 404, 411 (1983).\n\u00b6 40       Moore is strikingly similar to the case at bar. In Moore, the State\u2019s witnesses offered\n       overwhelming testimony indicating the defendant committed an armed robbery of the\n       victim\u2019s business. Id. at 406. Defendant testified that he went to the business with an\n       innocent purpose, to have a lighter engraved, when one of the store\u2019s owners approached him\n       with gun drawn. Id. at 408. The Moore defendant continued that in an ensuing struggle, the\n       gun discharged killing someone in the store. Id. The appellate court reversed the Moore\n       defendant\u2019s conviction \u201con the ground that the trial court erred in refusing to give the\n       voluntary-manslaughter instruction.\u201d Id. at 409.\n\u00b6 41       The Moore court reversed the appellate court, noting that the defendant\u2019s intent to kill\n       is not relevant to a felony murder charge and further that \u201cself-defense cannot be used as a\n       defense to a charge of felony murder.\u201d Id. at 411. The court concluded, \u201cThe jury, acting on\n       the overwhelming weight of the evidence, found the defendant guilty of armed robbery, a\n       forcible felony. Under those circumstances it made no difference whether the defendant\n       killed the victim knowingly or intentionally but with an unreasonable belief that the killing\n       was justified as self-defense. *** Any possible error in failing to give the instruction on the\n       offense of voluntary manslaughter, therefore, was not a ground for reversing the conviction.\u201d\n       Id. at 411-12.\n\u00b6 42       Similarly, we hold that even if the trial court committed error in refusing to give the\n       self-defense or second degree murder instruction, such error is not grounds for reversing\n       defendant\u2019s conviction for felony murder. Self-defense cannot be used as a defense to a\n       charge of felony murder. Id. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s intent to kill is irrelevant to the\n       charge of felony murder. Therefore, any error in refusing the instructions, plain or otherwise,\n       is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\f\u00b6 43                                      II. Prior Convictions\n\u00b6 44        Defendant also argues that the trial court erred when allowing the State to admit evidence\n       of his prior conviction for aggravated battery with a firearm for impeachment purposes.\n       Again, the State argues defendant has forfeited this issue as he failed to raise it in a written\n       posttrial motion. Defendant acknowledges that he failed to properly preserve the issue, but\n       asks that we review the matter for plain error.\n\u00b6 45        Where \u201ca defendant fails to object to an error at trial and include the error in a posttrial\n       motion, he forfeits ordinary appellate review of that error.\u201d People v. Johnson, 238 Ill. 2d\n       478, 484 (2010). Under the plain-error doctrine, a reviewing court may consider a forfeited\n       error when:\n            \u201c(1) a clear or obvious error occurred and the evidence is so closely balanced that the\n            error alone threatened to tip the scales of justice against the defendant, regardless of the\n            seriousness of the error, or (2) a clear or obvious error occurred and that error is so\n            serious that it affected the fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial and challenged the integrity\n            of the judicial process, regardless of the closeness of the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation\n            marks omitted.) Id. at 484 (quoting People v. Piatkowski, 225 Ill. 2d 551, 565 (2007)).\n\u00b6 46        Rather than operating as a general savings clause, the doctrine is construed as a narrow\n       and limited exception to the typical forfeiture rule applicable to unpreserved claims. Id. The\n       first step in plain-error analysis is to determine if any error occurred at all in the trial below.\n       People v. Sargent, 239 Ill. 2d 166,189-90 (2010). The burden of persuasion rests with the\n       defendant under both prongs of plain-error analysis. Id. The ultimate issue of whether a\n       forfeited claim is reviewable as plain error is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.\n       Johnson, 238 Ill. 2d at 485.\n\u00b6 47        Defendant notes that our supreme court set forth factors in People v. Montgomery, 47 Ill.\n       2d 510 (1971), to be used by a trial court contemplating the introduction of a prior conviction\n       for impeachment purposes. The Montgomery court noted that evidence of a prior conviction\n       is relevant to attack the credibility of a witness if: the crime was punishable by death or more\n       than one year in prison, or the crime involved dishonesty or false statement regardless of the\n       punishment; less than 10 years elapsed since either the conviction or the release from\n       confinement; the probative value of the conviction outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice.\n       Id. at 518. This last factor requires a trial court to balance the nature of the prior conviction,\n       the temporal relation of the prior crime to the current charge, the subsequent career of the\n       witness, the length of the witness\u2019s criminal record, and whether the crime was similar to the\n       one charged. People v. Mullins, 242 Ill. 2d 1, 14-15 (2011).\n\u00b6 48        Defendant asserts the record is devoid of any indication that the trial court actually\n       engaged in this balancing analysis. Therefore, defendant posits that he is entitled to have his\n       conviction reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. No.\n\u00b6 49        The record reveals that defendant asked the trial judge how his prior conviction was\n       relevant. The trial judge explained to defendant that \u201cwhen you testify, when anybody\n       testifies, they have a right to ask the court to admit certain convictions that may bear on a\n       person\u2019s credibility.\u201d The trial judge stated that he was going to admit the prior conviction\n       over defendant\u2019s objection. The trial judge further stated that the jury would be given an\n\n                                                  -8-\n\f       instruction informing the jury to consider the prior conviction only with regard to the issue\n       of defendant\u2019s credibility. The record further indicates that the State argued that defendant\u2019s\n       prior conviction satisfies the factors set out in Montgomery.\n\u00b6 50       Defendant acknowledges that a trial court need not explicitly state that it is conducting\n       the Montgomery balancing test. Id. at 16-19; People v. Atkinson, 186 Ill. 2d 450, 463 (1999).\n       A trial judge is presumed to have understood the law and properly applied it. People v.\n       Howery, 178 Ill. 2d 1, 32 (1997).\n\u00b6 51       Again, the plain-error doctrine places the burden on the defendant to show that an error\n       occurred. Sargent, 239 Ill. 2d at 189-90. Defendant has clearly failed to meet this burden.\n       Defendant\u2019s sole argument \u201cthat balancing did not happen here\u201d is based upon his belief that\n       the record fails to specifically identify the trial court\u2019s acknowledgment of \u201ceither the need\n       to conduct the balancing test or the actual application of the test.\u201d The trial court is under no\n       duty to state its specific application of the test for the record. Mullins, 242 Ill. 2d at 14-15.\n\u00b6 52       Here, even assuming error, defendant could not prevail on a plain-error argument. The\n       evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt is overwhelming. No reasonable person could conclude that\n       evidence of a prior conviction was outcome determinative. Defendant testified himself that\n       he did not ask the police for help because of his prior felony convictions.\n\n\u00b6 53                                            III. Fees\n\u00b6 54        Finally, defendant claims that the trial court erred in calculating the amount of fees\n       attributable to his convictions. Defendant argues that certain fees charged against him are not\n       authorized by statute. The question of whether the trial court has authority to order a\n       defendant to pay fees under any given statute is a question of statutory interpretation which\n       we review de novo. People v. Marshall, 242 Ill. 2d 285, 292 (2011).\n\u00b6 55        Defendant correctly notes, and the State acknowledges, that defendant\u2019s DNA was\n       already on file due to a previous felony conviction and, as such, the trial court erred in\n       ordering he be charged the $200 DNA analysis fee. People v. Anthony, 2011 IL App (1st)\n       091528-B. We agree and, therefore, vacate the part of the sentencing order imposing this fee.\n\u00b6 56        Next, defendant asserts the trial court was without authority to order him to pay the $100\n       public defender fee. Defendant correctly notes that this fee is only authorized after a\n       defendant has been given notice and has been afforded a hearing on his ability to pay. People\n       v. Gutierrez, 2012 IL 111590; 725 ILCS 5/113-3.1(a) (West 2010). The record indicates the\n       circuit clerk imposed this fee and that neither the State nor the trial court moved for the fee.\n       In case anyone missed it, the supreme court has taken a strong stand against this practice:\n       \u201cWe admonish the circuit clerks in general, and the Lake County circuit clerk in particular,\n       that they may not impose public defender fees on their own. Pursuant to statute, a public\n       defender fee may be imposed only by the circuit court after notice and a hearing on the\n       defendant\u2019s ability to pay. We again remind the trial courts of their duty to hold such a\n       hearing before imposing these fees, and we trust that we will not have to speak on this issue\n       again.\u201d Gutierrez, 2012 IL 111590, \u00b6 26. We vacate the public defender fee.\n\u00b6 57        Defendant also argues that the State\u2019s Attorney fee authorized by section 4-2002(a) of\n       the Counties Code (55 ILCS 5/4-2002(a) (West 2010)) should be reduced from $530 to $140.\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f       The State concedes this argument as well. We agree. Section 4-2002 of the Counties Code\n       entitles a State\u2019s Attorney to fees in certain designated amounts based upon specific\n       characteristics of a given case. 55 ILCS 5/4-2002(a) (West 2010). The statute includes a per\n       diem, but mandates that the trial court \u201cshall make an order specifying the number of days\n       for which said per diem shall be allowed.\u201d Id. We find no order in the record authorizing the\n       per diem and, therefore, it may not be assessed. People v. Nicholls, 71 Ill. 2d 166, 179\n       (1978). The remaining assessments authorized under section 4-2002(a) of the Counties Code\n       equate to $140. 55 ILCS 5/4-2002(a) (West 2010).\n\u00b6 58       Finally, the defendant acknowledges that the trial court miscalculated the Violent Crime\n       Victims Assistance Fund fine. Section 10 of the Violent Crime Victims Assistance Act\n       authorizes a fine of $4 for every $40 of other fines imposed. 725 ILCS 240/10(b) (West\n       2010). The only fines, as compared to fees, assessed by the trial court total $14.75. Therefore,\n       the Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund fee should be increased to $4.\n\u00b6 59       Again, defendant takes no issue with the majority of the fees and fines assessed. After\n       vacating the $200 DNA analysis fee and $100 public defender fee, reducing the State\u2019s\n       Attorney fee from $530 to $140, and increasing the Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund\n       fee from $3 to $4, the total fees and fines owed by defendant equates to $1,755.50.\n\n\u00b6 60                                    CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 61      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction entered by the circuit court of\n       Peoria County is affirmed and the fines and fees assessed are modified.\n\n\u00b6 62      Affirmed as modified.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -10-\n\f",
