Record No. 2987-97-4           JUDGE RUDOLPH BUMGARDNER, III\n                                         FEBRUARY 16, 1999\nCOMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA\n\n\n         FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE CITY OF ALEXANDRIA\n                       John E. Kloch, Judge\n\n          Paul E. Pepper, Assistant Public Defender\n          (Susan L. Korfanty, Senior Assistant Public\n          Defender, on brief), for appellant.\n\n          Linwood T. Wells, Jr., Assistant Attorney\n          General (Mark L. Earley, Attorney General, on\n          brief), for appellee.\n\n\n     Gary Stephen Diaz appeals his conviction of receiving stolen\n\nproperty in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-108.   He argues that the\n\nevidence presented during his bench trial was insufficient to\n\nsustain the trial court's finding of guilt.   Concluding the\n\nevidence did support that finding, we affirm the conviction.\n\n     On appeal we view the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto the Commonwealth with all reasonable inferences fairly\n\ndeducible therefrom.   See Archer v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 1,\n\n11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997).   In so doing, we must discard the\n\nevidence of the accused in conflict with that of the\n\nCommonwealth, see Cirios v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 292, 295,\n\n373 S.E.2d 164, 165 (1988), and not substitute our judgment for\n\n     *\n      Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-413, recodifying Code \u00a7 17-116.010,\nthis opinion is not designated for publication.\n\fthat of the fact finder.    See Cable v. Commonwealth, 243 Va. 236,\n\n239, 415 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1992).   The trial court's ruling will\n\nnot be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without\n\nevidence to support it.    See George v. Commonwealth, 242 Va. 264,\n\n278, 411 S.E.2d 12, 20 (1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 973 (1992);\n\nSmith v. Commonwealth, 17 Va. App. 68, 71, 435 S.E.2d 414, 416\n\n(1993).\n\n     So viewed, the evidence established that Jeffrey Robertson\n\nstole a bracelet and diamond ring from his grandmother.    He and a\n\nfriend, also an underage teenager, took the jewelry to the Gold\n\nStar Pawn Shop and pawned it to the defendant, who worked there.\n\nThe items were worth $2,950, but they received only $120.     Both\n\nRobertson and his friend identified the defendant as the person\n\nto whom they pawned the jewelry.   They said that he did not ask\n\nfor identification, did not ask who owned the bracelet, and did\n\nnot ask them to complete any paperwork.\n\n     As soon as Robertson's grandmother discovered the jewelry\n\nwas missing, she suspected him of taking it.    He admitted\n\nstealing the jewelry and returned to the pawn shop with her where\n\nhe identified the defendant to her.     The defendant returned the\n\nbracelet to her without charge and without completing any\n\npaperwork.    An attorney for the pawn shop returned the ring a\n\nweek later.\n\n     Pawn shop regulations required verified identification of\n\nanyone who pawned property.   The required information included\n\nthe name, address, phone number, height, weight, and birth date.\n\n\n\n                                - 2 -\n\fThe regulations also required the pawn shop to make a detailed\n\ndescription of the property received and to file it in writing\n\nwith the police.    The detective who maintained these records\n\ntestified that he never received any form describing the jewelry\n\nRobertson pawned.    When asked for the pawn ticket for the\n\njewelry, the defendant gave the detective a pawn ticket, but it\n\nwas for a bracelet pawned by another person, Martha Jones, and\n\nthe description on the ticket did not match the jewelry Robertson\n\npawned.\n\n        The defendant said that he had been in the store all day on\n\nthe day in question, but he did not know if \"two kids\" had come\n\ninto the store.    He acknowledged being in the store when the\n\ngrandmother claimed her bracelet, but he said that it had been in\n\nthe store \"for a while.\"    The defendant also claimed that he had\n\ngiven the detective the correct ticket for the transaction with\n\nRobertson, but later stated that the \"constant bombardment\" by\n\nthe detectives caused him to give them the wrong ticket.\n\n        Three other witnesses testified for the defendant.    The shop\n\nowner, his half-brother and his wife all testified that they had\n\nbeen in the store on the day in question but had not seen the two\n\nboys.    The defendant argues that the trial court erred by\n\ndisregarding the three defense witnesses and in believing\n\nRobertson and his friend.    He asserts that accepting the\n\ntestimony of the two teenagers over that of the three adults was\n\narbitrary.    However, the credibility of witnesses, the weight\n\naccorded their testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from\n\n\n\n                                 - 3 -\n\fproven facts are matters solely for the fact finder's\n\ndetermination.   See Sandoval v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 133,\n\n138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995).\n\n     We conclude that the evidence is sufficient to affirm the\n\ndefendant's conviction for receiving stolen property.     Robertson\n\nand his friend pawned stolen jewelry to the defendant.     He paid\n\nthem $120 for two items worth much more and asked for no\n\nidentification from the teenagers.      He prepared no paperwork and\n\ndid not file the required information with the police.     The\n\ndefendant returned the bracelet to the grandmother but charged\n\nher nothing.   From this evidence the trial court could find that\n\nthe defendant received the property and could infer that he knew\n\nit was stolen when he did so.\n\n     Finally, the defendant gave conflicting explanations for his\n\nactions.   He first said that Jones's ticket was the correct\n\nticket for the grandmother's jewelry but later stated that the\n\ndetectives pressured him into providing the wrong pawn ticket.\n\nWhere a fact finder concludes a defendant's testimony is\n\nincredible, it can infer the defendant lied to conceal his guilt.\nSee Speight v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. App. 83, 88, 354 S.E.2d 95, 98\n\n(1987).\n\n     The evidence is sufficient to affirm the defendant's\n\nconviction, and we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n                                                           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                - 4 -\n\f",
