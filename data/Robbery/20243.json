JONES III, JUDGE PRESIDING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM E M O R A N D U M   O P I N I O N\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMelvin Dean Marshall seeks to appeal judgments of conviction for securities fraud\r\nand theft.  We dismiss the appeals for want of jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe indictment in cause number 32521 (our cause number 03-07-00452-CR) accused\r\nMarshall of engaging in fraud in the offer and sale of securities in an amount exceeding $100,000. \r\nSee Tex. Rev. Civ. Stats. Ann. art. 581-29 (West Supp. 2007).  The indictment in cause number\r\n32522 (our cause number 03-07-00457-CR) accused Marshall of unlawfully appropriating more than\r\n$200,000.  See Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 31.03 (West Supp. 2007).  The two indictments were jointly\r\ntried in November 2006.  On November 16, having found Marshall guilty of both offenses, the jury\r\nreturned verdicts assessing punishment in cause number 32521 (securities fraud) at ten years'\r\nimprisonment and a $10,000 fine, with a recommendation that the prison term be probated, and at\r\neleven years' imprisonment and a $10,000 fine in cause number 32522 (theft).\r\n\r\nThe trial court orally suspended (in cause number 32521) and imposed (in cause\r\nnumber 32522) sentence in open court on November 16, 2006, in accordance with the jury's verdicts. \r\nHowever, the court's written judgments, which were also signed and filed on November 16,\r\ndid\u00a0not\u00a0conform to the jury's verdicts or to the court's oral pronouncements.  In cause number\r\n32521,\u00a0the written judgment recited that the punishment was eleven years' imprisonment (not the\r\nten years\u00a0assessed by the jury) and a $10,000 fine.  The judgment recited that the \"sentence\r\nof\u00a0confinement [is] suspended,\" but it elsewhere ordered Marshall's imprisonment (the jury had\r\nrecommended probation).  In cause number 32522, the written judgment imposed a sentence of ten\r\nyears' imprisonment (not the eleven years assessed by the jury) and a $10,000 fine.  Like the other\r\njudgment, it recited that the \"sentence of confinement [is] suspended,\" but ordered Marshall's\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nOn November 22, 2006, the State filed a motion for judgment nunc pro tunc in cause\r\nnumber 32521, complaining that the written judgment did not state the offense for which Marshall\r\nwas convicted.  On November 27, the district court granted the State's motion and signed a judgment\r\nnunc pro tunc in cause number 32521 reciting that Marshall had been convicted of securities fraud. \r\nLike the original written judgment, the judgment nunc pro tunc in cause number 32521 did not\r\nconform to the jury's verdict and imposed a sentence of eleven years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nOn December 18, 2006, Marshall filed timely motions for new trial in both causes.\r\nSee Tex. R. App. P. 4.1(a), 21.4(a).  The motions, which were identical, complained that Marshall\r\nhad been absent for part of the trial and that the punishments had been decided by lot.  The\r\nmotions\u00a0for new trial were overruled by operation of law effective January 30, 2007.  See Tex. R.\r\nApp. P. 21.8(c).\r\n\r\nOn May 11, 2007, the district court held a brief \"restitution hearing.\"  The court stated\r\nthat the purpose of the hearing was \"to memorialize on the record the agreement about restitution.\" \r\nMarshall was sworn and testified that he concurred in a written agreement between his attorney\r\nand\u00a0the prosecutor showing that he owed five named individuals a total of $382,477.49 in\r\nrestitution. (1)  Following the hearing and on the same day, the court signed an \"amended judgment of\r\nconviction\" in each cause reciting that it \"is reformed after restitution hearing and to correct certain\r\nclerical errors, and is signed and entered within the Court's 180 day period of plenary power.\" (2)  In\r\nconformity to the jury verdict, the \"amended judgment\" in cause number 32521 (securities fraud)\r\nreflects a punishment of ten years' imprisonment and a $10,000 fine, suspends imposition of\r\nsentence, and places Marshall on community supervision. (3)  The judgment also contains an order that\r\nMarshall pay $382,477.49 in restitution.  The \"amended judgment\" in cause number 32522 (theft)\r\nalso conforms to the jury verdict, imposing a sentence of eleven years' imprisonment and a $10,000\r\nfine; there is no restitution order.\r\n\r\nMarshall filed notices of appeal in both causes on August 3, 2007.  Both notices\r\nexpress Marshall's desire to appeal \"from the judgment of conviction and sentence herein\r\nrendered.\" (4)\r\n\r\nThe time limit for perfecting an appeal from a judgment of conviction begins to\r\nrun\u00a0on the day sentence is imposed or suspended in open court.  Tex. R. App. P. 26.2(a); see Rodarte\r\nv. State, 860 S.W.2d 108, 109 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (written judgment of conviction is not\r\n\"appealable order\" within meaning of rule; the defendant does not have option of calculating\r\ntime\u00a0limit from day written judgment is signed and entered by trial court) (construing predecessor\r\nrule).  In these causes, sentence was imposed and suspended in open court on November 16, 2006. \r\nBecause there were timely motions for new trial, appellant had ninety days from November 16 or\r\nto February 14, 2007, to perfect an appeal.  Tex. R. App. P. 26.2(a)(2).  Marshall's notices of appeal\r\nwere filed almost six months after that deadline.\r\n\r\nMarshall argues, however, that the time for perfecting appeal did not begin to run on\r\nNovember 16, 2006.  Citing Bailey v. State, 160 S.W.3d 11 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004), Marshall urges\r\nthat sentencing in these causes was not completed until May 11, 2007, the day of the restitution\r\nhearing.  Marshall contends that his notices of appeal were timely because they were filed less than\r\nninety days after May 11.  See Tex. R. App. P. 21.4(a) (motion for new trial may be filed before date\r\nsentence imposed or suspended); Cortez v. State, 735 S.W.2d 294, 301 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1987,\r\nno pet.) (motion for new trial filed after verdict of guilt but before determination of punishment and\r\nimposition of sentence was timely).\r\n\r\nIn Bailey, the defendant pleaded guilty on February 12, whereupon the trial court\r\nadjudged him guilty of the charged offense, assessed punishment at five years' imprisonment,\r\nsuspended imposition of sentence, and ordered general conditions of probation.  160 S.W.3d at 12. \r\nThe court then reset the case for a hearing on March 12 to consider the State's request for restitution\r\nas a further condition of probation.  Id.  The record reflected that in pleading guilty, the defendant\r\nhad reserved the right to appeal any restitution order.  Id.  After hearing evidence at the March 12\r\nhearing, the court ordered the defendant to pay restitution in the amount of $49,000.  Id.  The\r\ndefendant filed his notice of appeal on April 4.  Id.  The court of appeals dismissed the appeal\r\nbecause the notice of appeal had been filed more than thirty days after sentence was suspended in\r\nopen court.  Id. at 13.  The court of criminal appeals concluded, however, that \"[i]n the unique\r\nfacts\u00a0of this case, the parties considered the sentencing to be incomplete until the amount of\r\nrestitution, if any, was set.\"  Id. at 16.  Thus, for the purposes of rule 26.2(a), sentence had not been\r\nsuspended in open court until the last condition of probation was decided and the notice of appeal\r\nwas timely.  Id. (5)\r\n\r\nThe record in the instant causes does not reflect any agreement between the parties\r\nto consider sentencing to be incomplete pending resolution of the restitution issue.  Although\r\nMarshall testified, at the punishment stage, that he intended to make restitution, there was no\r\nmention of restitution by the court when it suspended (in cause number 32521) and imposed (in\r\ncause number 32522) sentence in open court on November 16, 2006.  Moreover, the trial court did\r\nnot indicate in any manner that the question of restitution had been left open for determination at a\r\nlater date.  To the contrary, the court announced, \"This concludes the trial.\"\r\n\r\nWe note that the original written judgment in cause number 32522 (theft) contained\r\na notation that restitution was \"to be determined.\"  While this is some indication that the parties\r\nconsidered restitution to be an open issue, it does not reflect an understanding between the parties\r\nand the trial court that the sentencing process was incomplete.  In any event, the trial court did\r\nnot\u00a0order restitution in cause number 32522.  The restitution order was added to the \"amended\r\njudgment\" in cause number 32521 (securities fraud).  The original written judgment in cause number\r\n32521 stated that restitution was \"n/a.\"\r\n\r\nWe conclude that the causes now before us do not contain the \"unique facts\" found\r\nin Bailey.  See id.  Imposition of sentence was complete in these causes on November 16, 2006, and\r\nMarshall's notices of appeal filed on August 3, 2007, were too late to perfect appeals from his\r\nconvictions for securities fraud and theft.  Alternatively, if the district court's May 11 decision to\r\n\"amend\" the judgments was an independently appealable order separate from the judgments of\r\nconviction, a matter we do not decide, Marshall did not file his notice of appeal within thirty\r\ndays\u00a0after the order was entered. (6)  Under the circumstances, we lack jurisdiction to dispose of the\r\npurported appeals in any manner other than by dismissing them for want of jurisdiction.  See Slaton\r\nv. State, 981 S.W.2d 208 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998); Olivo v. State, 918 S.W.2d 519, 522-23\r\n(Tex.\u00a0Crim. App. 1996).\r\n\r\nThe appeals are dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t__________________________________________\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tJan P. Patterson, Justice\r\n\r\nBefore Justices Patterson, Puryear and Henson\r\n\r\nDismissed for Want of Jurisdiction\r\n\r\nFiled:   May 9, 2008\r\n\r\nDo Not Publish\r\n1.   Three of these individuals were named complainants in both indictments.  The other two\r\nindividuals were named complainants in the theft indictment only.\r\n2.   We infer that the district court was referring to the 180-period during which a trial court\r\nmay suspend further execution of a prison sentence previously imposed.  See Tex. Code Crim. Proc.\r\nAnn. art. 42.12, \u00a7 6(a) (West Supp. 2007) (\"shock probation\").  Marshall was eligible for probation\r\nonly in cause number 32521, and his sentence in that cause had already been suspended by the court\r\non November 16, 2006.\r\n3.   Insofar as the record reflects, the conditions of probation have not been determined.\r\n4.   In cause number 03-07-00452-CR, the securities fraud case, Marshall's appointed counsel\r\non appeal has filed a brief stating that the appeal is frivolous.  See Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738\r\n(1967).  In cause number 03-07-00457-CR, the theft case, counsel contends that the evidence is\r\nlegally and factually insufficient to sustain the guilty verdict.\r\n5.   The court of criminal appeals was careful to point out that the case did not involve a\r\nmodification of the conditions of Bailey's probation.  See Bailey v. State, 160 S.W.3d 11, 14 &amp; 16\r\nn.4 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).  Orders modifying the terms and conditions of probation are not\r\nappealable.  Basaldua v. State, 558 S.W.2d 2, 6 (Tex. Crim. App. 1977).\r\n6.   Moreover, Marshall brings forward no issue challenging the court's decision to enter the\r\n\"amended judgments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n",
