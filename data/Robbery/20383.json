A jury found Appellant\r\nguilty and assessed punishment at imprisonment for a term of seventy-five years.  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\n\tOn December 7, 2003, the complainant, Maria Ruiz, returned to her apartment at\r\napproximately 9:00 in the evening.  She had been gone most of the day visiting her mother.  Ruiz\r\nlived in the apartment with her son, who was about one year old at the time.  Although she had\r\nlocked the door when she left, it was unlocked and pushed open when she placed her key in the door. \r\nRuiz walked cautiously into the apartment and turned on the light in her bedroom.  Having left the\r\nroom tidy, she noticed immediately that her bedroom was a mess.  A piggy bank had been broken\r\nopen and the cash inside had been taken.  Her jewelry box had been opened and earrings were strewn\r\nall over her dresser.  She found her necklaces on the floor by the bedroom window.  Ruiz went into\r\nthe living room and saw that her VCR and some tapes were missing.  A tote bag was missing but the\r\nclothes that had been inside the bag were thrown on the floor.  Ruiz then called the police.\r\n\r\n\tOfficer Mark Fernandez was dispatched to the scene and fingerprinted various areas and\r\nitems in the apartment.  He lifted only one print from the exterior kitchen window where it appeared\r\nentry had been made.  He also lifted a shoe print on the tile kitchen floor.  Fernandez removed the\r\npiggy bank and jewelry box for additional fingerprint processing.  He found prints on both items and\r\nturned them over to the fingerprint specialist for comparison.  Bruce Orndorf is the El Paso Police\r\nDepartment's senior fingerprint examiner.  He compared the latent prints received from Fernandez\r\nto the known prints of Appellant, who was a suspect in the case, (1) and determined that Appellant's\r\nfingerprints matched one latent print found on the piggy bank and one latent print found on the\r\njewelry box.  Ruiz did not know Appellant and did not give him consent to be in her apartment.\r\n\r\n\tAppellant testified at trial that he had been in the apartment on several occasions because he\r\nwas having an affair with Ruiz.  A friend introduced the couple when she purchased cocaine from\r\nRuiz at the apartment.  The relationship ended when Ruiz saw him with another woman.  He had\r\nhidden some cocaine in the piggy bank and removed it before leaving the apartment.  When asked\r\non cross-examination to explain how his fingerprint was found on the jewelry box, Appellant\r\nclaimed that they knocked over some things while having sex and he might have picked it up and\r\nput it back on the dresser.  Appellant admitted that he never told the police about his relationship\r\nwith the complainant or that he had been in the apartment with her consent even though the officer\r\ninterrogating him confronted him with the evidence that his fingerprints had been found in the\r\napartment.  Appellant also admitted that he had been convicted of  attempted burglary of a habitation\r\nin 1992; he had been arrested for burglary of a habitation in 2000, but it was reduced to theft; and\r\nhe was arrested for burglary of a habitation in 2003, but it was reduced to criminal trespass.  \tDuring rebuttal, Ruiz testified that she had never seen Appellant before that day in court and\r\nshe expressly denied having an affair with him or using cocaine with him.  Ruiz also denied being\r\na drug dealer.  Ruiz's landlord, Gwen Hopkins, testified that she knew Ruiz personally and none of\r\nher tenants ever complained that suspicious persons were seen going to Ruiz's apartment or that Ruiz\r\nwas dealing drugs out of the apartment.  Hopkins never saw Appellant visiting Ruiz at the apartment. \r\nShe recalled that she had allowed Appellant to live in the apartment for about two weeks when his\r\nmother had \"put him out\" but this occurred before Ruiz lived there.  Hopkins, who knew Appellant\r\nwell and was familiar with his reputation for truthfulness, testified she would not believe anything\r\nhe said.  The jury rejected Appellant's defense and found him guilty of burglary of a habitation and\r\nassessed his punishment at imprisonment for a term of seventy-five years.\r\n\r\nVOIR DIRE COMMENT ON\r\n\r\n\r\nFAILURE TO TESTIFY\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn his first point of error, Appellant contends that during voir dire the prosecutor\r\nimpermissibly commented on his failure to testify in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  Appellant\r\ncomplains about the highlighted portion:\r\n\r\n\t\tThe Defense has no burden to prove him or herself innocent.  Again, the idea,\r\nthe concept is based on fairness.  If I were to say that Ms. Stevens keyed my car, and\r\nI drag her in a courtroom, I'd better be able to prove it, okay, with substantial\r\nevidence, and she doesn't have to get on the stand or do anything at her trial to prove\r\nthat she did not do it.  It's an idea based on fairness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tOne of the principles behind that is called the 5th Amendment right. \r\nBasically that's a constitutional right that every single one of us is afforded that says\r\nthat we do not have to do that.  We do not have to speak at our trial or provide any\r\nevidence against ourselves.  We can choose to remain silent.  Every single one of us\r\nhas that constitutional right.  All right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tLet's talk about this concept for a second.  Outside these courtroom doors in\r\nthe real world, it works differently, right?  Especially when you as a juror -- you're\r\ngoing to be asked to be the fact finder.  Human nature says that we always want to\r\nhear both sides of the story.  We always do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tIf I were to go home one day and my -- I get home and my five-year-old and\r\nmy six-year-old are at home, let's say with a babysitter, and I get home and I say --\r\nI see that a lamp has been broken on the floor of the living room.  So I call the kids\r\nin and I ask them, Who broke the lamp, what happened while I was gone?\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tIn the real world, my five-year-old is not going to be able to say, Mommy, I'm\r\ngoing to choose to invoke my 5th Amendment right at this point.  It doesn't work that\r\nway out there, but you can bet it works that way here, because we're dealing with\r\nvery serious issues.  We're dealing with somebody's liberty and we are veiled and\r\nprotected by constitutional rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tEvery single one of us have these rights.  So one of them is, you do not have\r\nto testify if you're on trial.  You can choose to remain silent and make the State prove\r\ntheir case without your help.  I cannot, as a prosecutor, call a criminal defendant to\r\nthe stand and ask him or her questions.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant's counsel then requested a bench conference and the following discussion occurred:  \r\n\r\n\t\t[Defense counsel]:  We move for a mistrial.  They keep referring to the\r\nDefendant as a criminal.  They keep referring to the right to -- the 5th Amendment\r\nright as a cover screen.  They are impugning a cover-up by the Defendant by the use\r\nof the language.  It's gone beyond the discussion of the 5th Amendment to a direct\r\nattack on the Defendant using such words as 'criminal' and I move for a mistrial. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n.          .          .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t[Prosecutor]:  Your Honor, I'm talking about any criminal defendant.  I'm not\r\nusing any terms specifically to the Defendant.  I'm solely talking to the 5th\r\nAmendment right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t[Defense counsel]:  I'd like the record to reflect that when she said 'criminal,'\r\nshe turned around and slightly leaned to Defense counsel's table and moved her right\r\narm slightly to Defense counsel's table.  I saw it personally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t[The Court]:  Your objection is overruled.  \r\n\r\n\tOn appeal, Appellant argues that the prosecutor gave the jury panel the impression that even\r\na child does not have a right to claim this right and that the Constitution is valid only in a court of\r\nlaw.  The State responds that the argument made on appeal is waived because it does not comport\r\nwith the objection raised and ruled on at trial.  We agree.  To preserve error for review on appeal,\r\na defendant's complaint on appeal must comport with the objection raised at trial.  Santellan v. State,\r\n939 S.W.2d 155, 171 (Tex.Crim.App. 1997).  Appellant did not raise any objection in the trial court\r\nsufficient to preserve the issue raised on appeal.  Consequently, it is waived.  We overrule Point of\r\nError One.\r\n\r\nSUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn Point of Error Two, Appellant challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence\r\nsupporting his conviction.  More specifically, he argues that the evidence is insufficient to prove\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that he is the person who committed the offense.\r\n\r\nLegal Sufficiency\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction, we must\r\nreview all the evidence, both State and defense, in the light most favorable to the verdict to\r\ndetermine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.  Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 2789, 61\r\nL. Ed. 2d 560 (1979); Geesa v. State, 820 S.W.2d 154, 159 (Tex.Crim.App. 1991).  We consider all\r\nof the evidence, whether admissible or inadmissible.  Wilson v. State, 7 S.W.3d 136, 141\r\n(Tex.Crim.App. 1999); Johnson v. State, 967 S.W.2d 410, 412 (Tex.Crim.App. 1998).  We do not\r\nresolve any conflict of fact or assign credibility to the witnesses, as it was the function of the trier\r\nof fact to do so.  See Adelman v. State, 828 S.W.2d 418, 421 (Tex.Crim.App. 1992); Matson v. State,\r\n819 S.W.2d 839, 843 (Tex.Crim.App. 1991).  Instead, our duty is only to determine if both the\r\nexplicit and implicit findings of the trier of fact are rational by viewing all of the evidence admitted\r\nat trial in a light most favorable to the verdict.  Adelman, 828 S.W.2d at 422.  In so doing, any\r\ninconsistencies in the evidence are resolved in favor of the verdict.  Matson, 819 S.W.2d at 843.\r\nFurther, the standard of review is the same for both direct evidence and circumstantial evidence\r\ncases.  Geesa, 820 S.W.2d at 158.\r\n\r\n\tThe essential elements of burglary of a habitation are:  (1) a person; (2) without effective\r\nconsent of the owner; (3) enters a habitation; (4) with intent to commit theft.  Tex.Penal Code Ann.\r\n\u00a7 30.02(a)(Vernon  2003).  Appellant argues generally that no witness or evidence placed him in the\r\napartment on the day of the burglary.  Generally, fingerprint evidence alone will be sufficient to\r\nsustain a conviction if the evidence shows that the prints were necessarily made at the time of the\r\nburglary.  Mathew v. State, 839 S.W.2d 110, 112-13 (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi 1992, no pet.), citing \r\nBowen v. State, 460 S.W.2d 421, 423 (Tex.Crim.App. 1970) and Nieto v. State, 767 S.W.2d 905,\r\n908 (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi 1989, no pet.).  Here, the evidence showed that when Ruiz left the\r\napartment, it was tidy and her belongings were undisturbed.  When she returned, she discovered that\r\nsomeone had entered the apartment without her consent and had gone through her belongings,\r\nincluding the piggy bank and her jewelry contained in the jewelry box.  Appellant's fingerprints were\r\nfound on both the piggy bank and jewelry box.  The person who entered the apartment broke into\r\nthe piggy bank and removed the cash and took other items from the apartment including a video\r\ncassette recorder.  He also took a ring from the jewelry box.  Other evidence revealed that Appellant\r\nwas often seen in the area because he lived nearby.  Although Appellant claimed he had a\r\nrelationship with Ruiz and had been in the apartment by invitation, Ruiz expressly denied knowing\r\nAppellant or ever consenting for him to be in her apartment.  The jury resolved this conflict in the\r\nevidence in favor of the State and found Appellant guilty.  When taken in the light most favorable\r\nto the verdict, the foregoing evidence is legally sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to find\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant entered Ruiz's apartment without her consent with the\r\nintent to commit theft.\r\n\r\nFactual Sufficiency\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn reviewing the factual sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we are to view\r\nall the evidence in a neutral light, favoring neither party.  Johnson v. State, 23 S.W.3d 1, 7\r\n(Tex.Crim.App. 2000); Clewis v. State, 922 S.W.2d 126, 129 (Tex.Crim.App. 1996).  In performing\r\nour review, we are to give due deference to the fact finder's determinations.  See id. at 8-9; Clewis,\r\n922 S.W.2d at 136.  The fact finder is the judge of the credibility of the witnesses and may \"believe\r\nall, some, or none of the testimony.\"  Chambers v. State, 805 S.W.2d 459, 461 (Tex.Crim.App.\r\n1991).  Evidence is factually insufficient if it is so weak that it would be clearly wrong and\r\nmanifestly unjust to allow the verdict to stand, or the finding of guilt is against the great weight and\r\npreponderance of the available evidence.  Johnson, 23 S.W.3d at 11.  Therefore, the question we\r\nmust consider in conducting a factual sufficiency review is whether a neutral review of all the\r\nevidence, both for and against the finding, demonstrates that the proof of guilt is so obviously weak\r\nas to undermine confidence in the fact finder's determination, or the proof of guilt, although\r\nadequate if taken alone, is greatly outweighed by contrary proof.  See id.  Under the first prong of\r\nJohnson, we cannot conclude that a conviction is \"clearly wrong\" or \"manifestly unjust\" simply\r\nbecause, on the quantum of evidence admitted, we would have voted to acquit had we been on the\r\njury.  Watson v. State, 204 S.W.3d 404, 417 (Tex.Crim.App. 2006).  Under the second prong of\r\nJohnson, we cannot declare that a conflict in the evidence justifies a new trial simply because we\r\ndisagree with the jury's resolution of that conflict.  Id.  Before finding that evidence is factually\r\ninsufficient to support a verdict under the second prong of Johnson, we must be able to say, with\r\nsome objective basis in the record, that the great weight and preponderance of the evidence\r\ncontradicts the jury's verdict.  Id. \r\n\r\n\tAppellant argues that the State failed to overcome his testimony that he had been invited to\r\nthe apartment by Ruiz for social purposes.  The State is not required to \"overcome\" or rebut\r\nAppellant's testimony.  The jury had before it competing evidence and it was required to weigh that\r\nevidence and judge the credibility of the witnesses.  It was the jury's task to determine whether it\r\nbelieved the State's witnesses or Appellant.  The evidence is not factually insufficient simply\r\nbecause the jury resolved the conflicting views of the evidence in favor of the State.  Cain v. State,\r\n958 S.W.2d 404, 410 (Tex.Crim.App. 1997).  Having given appropriate deference to the jury's\r\nassessment of the evidence and its resolution of the evidentiary conflicts, and after considering all\r\nof the evidence in a neutral light, we conclude the evidence is factually sufficient to support\r\nAppellant's conviction.  We overrule Point of Error Two.\r\n\r\nINEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn Point of Error Three, Appellant asserts that he was denied the effective assistance of\r\ncounsel at trial because he did not ask proper questions of individual venirepersons during voir dire;\r\nhe did not object to photos of the crime scene; he did not object when the State called a witness who\r\nwas not on the witness list; he did not prepare Appellant to testify; he failed to investigate the crime\r\nscene; he did not request an instruction on the lesser-included offense of theft; he waived an opening\r\nstatement during the punishment phase; he did not present any punishment or mitigation evidence;\r\nand counsel's punishment argument was too brief.  The State initially responds that Appellant's\r\nineffective assistance of counsel claim is inadequately briefed because the argument consists\r\nprimarily of a laundry list of claimed deficiencies.  The State is correct that Appellant has failed to\r\nprovide adequate argument or citation to authority for several of his complaints about trial counsel,\r\nand we have, where appropriate refused to address the arguments.  Rather than refusing to review\r\nthe entire point of error, however, we will review as much of it as is permitted by the state of the\r\nrecord and the briefing.\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe proper standard for determining claims of ineffective assistance under the Sixth\r\nAmendment is the two-step analysis adopted by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v.\r\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984).  See Hernandez v. State, 988\r\nS.W.2d 770, 771-72 (Tex.Crim.App. 1999). Under the first prong, the defendant must show that\r\ncounsel's performance was deficient, to the extent that counsel failed to function as the \"counsel\"\r\nguaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.  Jackson v. State, 877 S.W.2d 768, 771 (Tex.Crim.App. 1994).\r\nUnder the second prong, the defendant must establish that counsel's deficient performance\r\nprejudiced the defense.  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693; Jackson,\r\n877 S.W.2d at 771.  Prejudice is established by a showing that there is a reasonable probability that\r\nbut for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\r\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698; Jackson, 877 S.W.2d at 771.\r\nFailure to make the required showing of deficient performance defeats the ineffectiveness claim.\r\nJackson, 877 S.W.2d at 771.\r\n\r\n\tWhen we review a claim of ineffective assistance, we must indulge a strong presumption that\r\ncounsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable, professional assistance, and the\r\nappellant must overcome the presumption that the challenged conduct can be considered sound trial\r\nstrategy.  Jackson, 877 S.W .2d at 771.  Allegations of ineffectiveness of counsel must be firmly\r\nfounded in the record.  Mallett v. State, 65 S.W.3d 59, 63 (Tex.Crim.App. 2001). The record on\r\ndirect appeal will generally be insufficient to show that counsel's representation was so deficient as\r\nto meet the first prong of the Strickland standard because the reasonableness of counsel's choices\r\noften involve facts that do not appear in the appellate record.  Rylander v. State, 101 S.W.3d 107,\r\n110 (Tex.Crim.App. 2003); Mallett, 65 S.W.3d at 63.  An appellant challenging trial counsel's\r\nperformance therefore faces a difficult burden and a substantial risk of failure.  Thompson v. State,\r\n9 S.W.3d 808, 813 (Tex.Crim.App. 1999). \r\n\r\nVoir Dire\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAppellant argues that counsel failed to engage in individual voir dire of potential jurors.  He\r\ndoes not identify the jurors but simply cites to one page in the record where counsel said he did not\r\nneed to individually question a woman who was married to a U.S. Customs agent.  Appellant later\r\nutilized a peremptory strike against this potential juror.  Appellant makes only conclusory assertions\r\nin his brief and does not establish why trial counsel's decision to not question this potential juror\r\ncould not be considered reasonable trial strategy, how it constituted deficient performance or how\r\nit prejudiced him.  Appellant's argument is inadequately briefed and we decline to make his\r\nargument for him.  See Tex.R.App.P. 38.1(h).  Furthermore, Appellant did not file a motion for new\r\ntrial.  In the absence of a record indicating trial counsel's strategy, we are left to speculate about the\r\nreasons for counsel's actions.  Under these circumstances, we conclude that Appellant has failed to\r\nrebut the presumption that his attorney's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable,\r\nprofessional assistance and can be considered sound trial strategy.\r\n\r\nCrime Scene Photos\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAppellant next complains that counsel failed to object to photographs of the crime scene. \r\nHe argues in conclusory fashion that the State failed to lay a proper foundation for their introduction,\r\nfailed to establish a chain of custody, and failed to authenticate them.  He does not provide any\r\nadditional argument or cite any authority indicating that these objections, if made by counsel, should\r\nhave been sustained by the trial court.  In order to show ineffectiveness in failing to object, Appellant\r\nmust demonstrate that if counsel had objected on the indicated grounds, the trial court would have\r\nerred in overruling the objection.  See Vaughn v. State, 931 S.W.2d 564, 566 (Tex.Crim.App. 1996). \r\nA photograph may be authenticated by the testimony of any witness who has personal knowledge\r\nthat the particular item accurately represents the scene or event it purports to portray.  Tex.R.Evid.\r\n901(a).  Ruiz testified that the each of the three photographs in question accurately represented the\r\nscene it was intended to portray.  Thus, Appellant's complaint that the photographs were not\r\nauthenticated is entirely without merit.  Because Appellant has not established that the judge would\r\nhave erred by overruling the other objections he claims should have been made, he has not shown\r\nineffective assistance of counsel.  \r\n\r\nWitness List\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAppellant also contends that trial counsel erred by failing to object when the State called\r\nGwen Hopkins to testify because she was not included on the witness list.  Contrary to Appellant's\r\nassertions, Gwen Hopkins was included on the State's witness list filed on June 18, 2004.  Appellant\r\ngenerally suggests that Hopkins' testimony was objectionable but he does not identify what portions\r\nof her testimony should have been objected to or the grounds of the objection.  This portion of\r\nAppellant's argument is inadequately briefed and presents nothing for our review.  See Tex.R.App.P.\r\n38.1(h).\r\n\r\nAppellant's Testimony\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAppellant also accuses his attorney of failing to prepare him to testify.  As evidence of this\r\nlack of preparation, he points to his testimony that he had not gone over his drawing of Ruiz's\r\napartment with any of his attorneys and that he committed an extraneous offense, possession of\r\ncocaine.  The record reflects that counsel discussed with Appellant prior to trial his decision to testify\r\nand the consequences of waiving his right to remain silent. (2)  There is no affirmative evidence in the\r\nrecord that counsel did not prepare Appellant to testify and we are unable to conclude from the\r\nsubstance of Appellant's testimony that trial counsel failed to do so.  We will not assume from a\r\nsilent record that trial counsel did not discuss Appellant's testimony with him, including the\r\ntestimony about the extraneous offense.  See Hubbard v. State, 770 S.W.2d 31, 43 (Tex.App.--Dallas\r\n1989, pet. ref'd)(where record was silent as to whether defendant's attorney explicitly told him that\r\ndenying the delivery offenses would preclude him from raising an entrapment defense as to those\r\noffenses, court refused to assume that counsel did not discuss this aspect of defendant's testimony\r\nwith him).  Appellant has failed to rebut the presumption that his attorney's conduct falls within the\r\nwide range of reasonable, professional assistance.\r\n\r\nFailure to Investigate\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAppellant alleges that trial counsel failed to investigate the case.  To support a claim of\r\nineffective assistance for failure to investigate, an appellant must show that he had a viable defense\r\nthat his attorney failed to discover.  Butler v. State, 716 S.W.2d 48, 55 (Tex.Crim.App. 1986); King\r\nv. State, 649 S.W.2d 42, 43 (Tex.Crim.App. 1983).   Because Appellant did not file a motion for new\r\ntrial on this issue, there is no evidence in the appellate record regarding the steps counsel took to\r\ninvestigate.  Further, Appellant does not indicate what viable defense trial counsel failed to discover. \r\nAppellant has failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\n\r\nLesser-Included Offense\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAppellant next argues that counsel failed to request an instruction on the lesser-included\r\noffense of theft.  His argument in this regard does not include any citations to authority or\r\ndiscussions of relevant case law and how it applies to this case.  A defense attorney's failure to\r\nrequest a jury instruction can render his assistance ineffective only if the trial judge would have erred\r\nin refusing the instruction had counsel requested it.  See Wood v. State, 4 S.W.3d 85, 87 (Tex.App.--Fort Worth 1999, pet. ref'd).  It may be reasonable trial strategy not to request a charge on a\r\nlesser-included offense.  See Lynn v. State, 860 S.W.2d 599, 603 (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi 1993,\r\npet. ref'd).  Appellant does not point to any evidence in the record establishing that if he is guilty,\r\nhe is guilty only of the lesser offense.  See Arevalo v. State, 943 S.W.2d 887, 889 (Tex.Crim.App.\r\n1997).  Appellant denied entering the apartment without Ruiz's consent and denied taking any of her\r\nproperty.  He testified that fingerprints were on the piggy bank and  the jewelry box because he had\r\nbeen in the apartment by invitation.  Because there was no evidence showing that if Appellant was\r\nguilty, he was guilty only of theft, he was not entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included offense. \r\nSee McKinney v. State, 627 S.W.2d 731, 732 (Tex.Crim.App. 1982)(where defendant denied\r\ncommitting the offense, there was no evidence that he was guilty only of lesser-offense).  Counsel\r\ndid not render ineffective assistance by failing to request an instruction to which Appellant was not\r\nentitled.  See Wood, 4 S.W.3d at 87.\r\n\r\nPunishment Phase\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAppellant offers three allegations related to counsel's conduct at the punishment phase: \r\ncounsel did not make an opening statement; he did not present any punishment or mitigation\r\nevidence; and his final argument was too brief.  There is no evidence in the record that any\r\nadmissible punishment evidence existed.  Further, as we have noted in discussing the other\r\nallegations of deficient performance, the record is silent regarding counsel's trial strategy.  Under\r\nthese circumstances, Appellant has not rebutted the presumption that counsel's performance at the\r\npunishment phase falls within the range of reasonable, professional assistance or that the challenged\r\nconduct is sound trial strategy.  See Bone v. State, 77 S.W.3d 828, 834-35 (Tex.Crim.App. 2002);\r\nThompson, 9 S.W.3d at 813-14.  Because Appellant has failed to carry his burden under Strickland,\r\nwe overrule Point of Error Three.  The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 22, 2007\t\t\t\t\t                                                                         \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tANN CRAWFORD McCLURE, Justice\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Chew, C.J., McClure, and Carr, JJ.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Do Not Publish)\r\n1.   The apartment complex owner, Gwen Hopkins, knew Appellant and told the police that she had seen\r\nAppellant at the apartment complex.  \r\n2.   Prior to Appellant's testimony, counsel put Appellant on the stand and questioned him regarding his decision\r\nto testify.  Appellant indicated that he knew he had a right to remain silent but wished to waive it and testify even though\r\ncounsel had advised him of the consequences of doing so.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
