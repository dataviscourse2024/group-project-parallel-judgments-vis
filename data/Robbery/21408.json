The charges arose out of an incident where Lawson threatened\n\fthe family of Lawson\u2019s daughter\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Matthew Joseph, and damaged\n\ntheir home.\n\n       (2)     Lawson claims on appeal that the trial judge improperly interrupted\n\nLawson\u2019s counsel during his closing arguments, when defense counsel told the\n\njury that each juror could apply an individualized \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\n\nstandard,\u201d and a \u201chigher burden and a higher standard.\u201d 1                      The trial judge\n\ninterrupted defense counsel and referred the jurors to the court\u2019s instructions\n\ninstead of counsel\u2019s argument on the meaning of reasonable doubt.2 Lawson\n\nargues that the interruption during closing was improper and caused prejudice to\n\nthe defense, denying Lawson his constitutional right to a fair trial.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Defense counsel argued:\n        Now, as jurors, you have rights. And one of those rights is your standard of\n        beyond a reasonable doubt. You have taken an oath to stand together as a\n        member of the community to decide this case. And if your definition of\n        \u201creasonable doubt\u201d is different than some of your other fellow jurors and you\n        have a higher burden and a higher standard, it is your obligation as a juror to the\n        State, to the constitution and to Mr. Lawson to stand firm and hold to your\n        convictions and say, You know what? That standard for you may be enough; the\n        evidence the State\u2019s presented may be enough; but for me, it just doesn\u2019t cut it.\n        App. to Opening Br. at 26-27 (Trial Tr. Aug. 14, 2014).\n2\n  The trial judge stated:\n        The standard is as I have instructed them. It is not an individual standard of the\n        jurors. They are to follow the law as instructed by the Court. The standard is\n        beyond a reasonable doubt. They must be firmly convinced. It is no higher\n        standard than that. That is the standard. I\u2019m sorry to interrupt you. But that is a\n        misstatement of the law.\n        Id.\n                                                2\n\f       (3)    Ordinarily, when the court finds it necessary to reprimand counsel, the\n\nreprimand should be done outside the jury\u2019s presence.3 In this case, however, the\n\ntrial judge was justifiably concerned that defense counsel\u2019s argument was\n\nconfusing and contradicted the jury instructions.             The trial judge interrupted\n\ndefense counsel a single time to refer the jury to the definition of \u201creasonable\n\ndoubt\u201d in the instructions. 4 The court did so respectfully and in a limited manner.5\n\nWe therefore find no violation of Lawson\u2019s right to a fair trial.\n\n       NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the judgment of the Superior\n\nCourt is AFFIRMED. Lawson\u2019s motion for oral argument is denied.\n\n                                                   BY THE COURT:\n\n                                                   /s/ Collins J. Seitz, Jr.\n                                                          Justice\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Keyser v. State, 893 A.2d 956, 963 (Del. 2006).\n4\n  See Brown v. State, 49 A.3d 1158, 1161 (Del. 2012) (trial judge properly interrupted defense\ncounsel during closing when reading a potentially misleading dictionary definition inconsistent\nwith the jury instructions).\n5\n  See Keyser, 893 A.2d at 961-63 (trial judge had an \u201capparent antipathy to defense counsel\u201d\nwhich he manifested by making sarcastic and demeaning comments and reprimands throughout\nthe trial).\n                                              3\n\f",
