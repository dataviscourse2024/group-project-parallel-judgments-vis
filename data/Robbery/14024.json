The trial court found defendant to be a prior and persistent offender and sentenced him to twelve years imprisonment.\nNo error of law appears and no jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum opinion for their information only, setting forth the reasons for this order.\nThe judgment is affirmed in accordance with Rule 30.25(b).\n",
