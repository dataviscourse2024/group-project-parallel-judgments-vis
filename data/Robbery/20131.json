R. App. P.\n 33.1(a)(1); \nMosley v. State\n, 983 S.W.2d 249, 265 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998) (op. on reh\u2019g), \ncert. denied, \n526 U.S. 1070 (1999); \nsee also \ngenerally\n \nDavis v. State\n, Nos. 02-05-00094-CR, 02-05-00106-CR, 2006 WL 413148, at *1-2 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth Feb. 23, 2006, no pet.) (mem. op.) (not designated for publication). \u00a0Because Bettis, who was represented by counsel, did not object to the trial court\u2019s consideration of the affidavit of indigence or to the trial court\u2019s questions in regard to the affidavit, the present allegations that the affidavit and the trial court\u2019s consideration of it violated her Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and \nArticle 38.22 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure are not properly before us. \u00a0\nSee Davis\n, 2006 WL 413148, at *2;\n Esparza v. State\n, No. 11-00-00175-CR, 2001 WL 34373316, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Eastland June 7, 2001, no pet.) (not designated for publication).\n\nAdditionally, the State alternatively asserts in its brief\u2014and we agree\u2014that the type of information sought from Bettis in the affidavit of indigence did not constitute a custodial interrogation. \u00a0\nSee Rhode Island v. Innis\n, 446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 1689 (1980) (defining interrogation as words or conduct by the police that they should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response). \u00a0Police questioning to obtain basic identifying, biographical data necessary to complete booking or pretrial services is not generally considered \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d that will trigger \nMiranda\n. \u00a0\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gotchis\n, 803 F.2d 74, 79 (2d Cir. 1986).\n\nWe overrule Bettis\u2019s sole point and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n\n\nPANEL F: WALKER, DAUPHINOT and HOLMAN, JJ.\n\n\n\nDO NOT PUBLISH\n\nTex. R. App. P.\n 47.2(b)\n\n\n\nDELIVERED: February 8, 2007\n\nFOOTNOTES\n1:See\n \nTex. R. App. P.\n 47.4.\n\n\n\n\n",
