Finding the evidence sufficient to support appellant's\r\npleas, the trial court deferred findings of guilt and placed him on community supervision for a\r\nperiod of five years for the burglary charge and eight years for the robbery offense.  At a\r\nhearing on the State's amended motions to proceed with adjudication of guilt on August 22,\r\n2002, appellant pled true to a number of violations of the terms of his community supervision,\r\nand the trial court adjudicated him guilty and sentenced him to concurrent sixteen year\r\nsentences.  In presenting these appeals, counsel for appellant filed an Anders brief in support\r\nof motions to withdraw.  See Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493\r\n(1967).  Based upon the rationale expressed herein, we affirm.  \r\n\r\n\tIn support of the motions to withdraw, counsel certifies she performed a conscientious\r\nexamination of the records and, in her opinion, they reflect no reversible error or grounds upon\r\nwhich an appeal can be predicated.  Thus, she concludes the appeals are frivolous.  In the\r\nbrief, counsel candidly discusses why, under the controlling authorities, there is no error in the\r\ncourt's judgments.  See High v. State, 573 S.W.2d 807, 813 (Tex.Cr.App. 1978).  By the brief,\r\ncounsel also certifies she provided appellant with a copy of the brief and advised him of his\r\nrights to review the records and to file a pro se response.  On March 13, 2003, appellant filed\r\na response claiming his trial attorney failed to convey a ten year plea offer. (2)\r\n\r\n\tAt the outset, we note the Code of Criminal Procedure expressly denies a criminal\r\ndefendant the right to appeal from a trial court's determination to adjudicate guilt.  Tex. Code\r\nCrim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, \u00a7 (5)(b) (Vernon Supp. 2003); Connolly v. State, 983 S.W.2d 738,\r\n741 (Tex.Cr.App. 1999).  Thus, we have no jurisdiction to review the trial court's order\r\nadjudicating appellant guilty.  However, we may review all of the proceedings conducted after\r\nthe adjudication of guilt on the original charge.  See Olowosuko v. State, 826 S.W.2d 940, 942\r\n(Tex.Cr.App. 1992).  Therefore, an appeal may be had to challenge the assessment of\r\npunishment and pronouncement of sentence.  Art. 42.12, \u00a7 (5)(b).  \r\n\r\n\tGenerally, a penalty imposed within the range of punishment established by the\r\nLegislature will not be disturbed on appeal.  Flores v. State, 936 S.W.2d 478, 478-79 (Tex.App.--Eastland 1996, pet. ref'd).  Appellant was adjudicated guilty on one charge of robbery and\r\nanother of burglary of a habitation, each of which is a second degree felony with a range of\r\npunishment from two to twenty years.  Tex. Pen. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 12.33(a), 29.02(a)(2),\r\n30.02(a)(1) (Vernon 2003).  We find the trial court did not err in assessing as punishment\r\nconcurrent 16 year sentences. \r\n\r\n\tWe have also made an independent examination of the entire record to determine\r\nwhether there are any arguable grounds which might support the appeals.  See  Penson v.\r\nOhio, 488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 ( 1988); see also Stafford v. State, 813\r\nS.W.2d 503, 511 (Tex.Cr.App. 1991).  We have found no such grounds and agree with counsel\r\nthat the appeals are without merit.  Currie v. State, 516 S.W.2d 684 (Tex.Cr.App. 1974). \r\n\r\n\tAccordingly, counsel's motions to withdraw are granted, and the judgments of the trial\r\ncourt are affirmed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tDon H. Reavis\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t     Justice\r\n\r\nDo not publish.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n1. Tex.  R.  App.  P.  47.2(a).\r\n2. Failure of defense counsel to inform a criminal defendant of plea offers made by the\r\nState is an omission that falls below an objective standard of professional reasonableness.  Ex\r\nparte Lemke, 13 S.W.3d 791, 795 (Tex.Cr.App. 2000).  Consequently, we deem appellant's\r\ncomplaint to be one of ineffective assistance of counsel.  We recognize ineffective assistance\r\nclaims may be raised for the first time on direct appeal.  See Robinson v. State, 16 S.W.3d\r\n808, 813 (Tex.Cr.App. 2000).  However, in the context of an adjudication proceeding, we may\r\nonly review ineffective assistance claims as they pertain to post-adjudication matters.  See\r\nOlowosuko v. State, 826 S.W.2d 940, 942 (Tex.Cr.App. 1992).  Appellant makes no such\r\ncomplaints; therefore, he presents no arguable ground for appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
