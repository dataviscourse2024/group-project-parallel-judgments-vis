Moreover, after the court\u2019s initial ruling, defendant failed to renew his motion on the grounds now asserted on appeal and, therefore, failed to preserve the issue for this Court\u2019s review (see, People v Clarke, 81 NY2d 777).\nViewed as a whole, the court\u2019s charge was balanced and sufficiently conveyed the applicable principles of law to the jury (People v Russell, 266 NY 147,153). Concur\u2014Kupferman, J. P., Ross, Asch, Nardelli and Tom, JJ.\n",
