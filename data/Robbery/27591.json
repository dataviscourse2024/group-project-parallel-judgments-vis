Smith, Deputy Attorney General,\nfor Plaintiff and Respondent.\n                       ____________________\n\f       Christopher Williams requests a remand for resentencing\nunder Senate Bill No. 1393 (2017\u20132018 Reg. Sess.), which we call\nSB 1393. In July 2019, we dismissed his appeal because he\nlacked a certificate of probable cause. The Supreme Court\ntransferred the matter back to us to vacate our decision and\nreconsider the case in light of People v. Stamps (2020) 9 Cal.5th\n685 (Stamps). Williams and the People submitted supplemental\nbriefs. Under Stamps, we remand for the trial court to determine\nwhether to exercise its discretion under SB 1393. All statutory\ncitations are to the Penal Code.\n                                   I\n       We summarize some factual background.\n       As part of a plea deal, Williams pleaded no contest to two\nfelony counts of robbery. Williams admitted a strike offense\nconviction. In May 2018, the trial court sentenced Williams to 30\nyears and four months in prison. Five of these years were due to\na prior serious felony conviction enhancement under section 667,\nsubdivision (a)(1). Without requesting or receiving a certificate of\nprobable cause, Williams filed a notice of appeal on May 31, 2018.\n       The law changed later in 2018. At the time of sentencing,\nsection 1385, subdivision (b) prohibited the court from striking\nany prior conviction of a serious felony for enhancement purposes\nunder section 667. On September 30, 2018, the Governor signed\nSB 1393 into law. Effective January 1, 2019, this bill amended\nsection 1385 to grant courts discretion either to impose or to\nstrike section 667, subdivision (a)(1) enhancements.\n                                  II\n       Both parties correctly agree Stamps controls this case.\n       Williams may proceed without a certificate of probable\ncause. (Stamps, supra, 9 Cal.5th at p. 698.)\n\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\f       SB 1393 applies retroactively to Williams, whose judgment\nwas not final when the law took effect. (Stamps, supra, 9 Cal.5th\nat p. 699.)\n       The appropriate remedy is a remand to allow Williams to\nask the trial court to strike the section 667 enhancement. If the\ntrial court declines to exercise its discretion, that ends the matter\nand Williams\u2019s sentence stands. (Stamps, supra, 9 Cal.5th at p.\n707.) If the court is inclined to exercise its discretion, the court\nmust permit the People to choose whether to accept the sentence\nmodification or to withdraw assent to the plea agreement. (Ibid.)\nFurther, the court may withdraw its prior approval of the\nagreement. (Id. at p. 708.)\n                           DISPOSITION\n       We remand so Williams may ask the trial court to strike\nhis section 667 enhancement. If he does and the court is inclined\nto exercise its discretion, the court must permit the People to\nchoose whether to accept the sentence modification or to\nwithdraw assent to the plea agreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                            WILEY, J.\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n\n             BIGELOW, P. J.                 GRIMES, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\f",
