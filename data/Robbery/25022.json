Vincent N. Creppel appeals the Jackson County Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of his\n\nmotion for postconviction relief (PCR). Upon review, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s\n\njudgment, and we therefore affirm.\n\n                                        FACTS\n\n\u00b62.   This case addresses the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Creppel\u2019s second PCR motion. The\n\nunderlying facts show that on October 4, 2003, Creppel and his wife, Melissa Creppel, went\n\nto the home of Darrell Davis in Jackson County, Mississippi, to retrieve money from Davis.\n\fAccording to Creppel and the record below, Melissa knew where Davis lived because Davis\n\nhad allowed Melissa to stay at his house on several occasions in an attempt to help her with\n\nher drug-addiction problems. Creppel testified that while at Davis\u2019s home, he drank alcohol\n\nand consumed various prescription and illegal drugs. Melissa informed Creppel that she had\n\nengaged in a sexual relationship with Davis in exchange for drugs. Creppel stated that in\n\nresponse to this information, he started to drink heavily. Later, as Creppel and Melissa began\n\nto exit Davis\u2019s home, Creppel grabbed a knife from Davis and stabbed Davis forty-two times.\n\nMelissa then searched Davis\u2019s body and found $21 on his person, which she stole. Davis\u2019s\n\nsevere injuries left him wheelchair-bound.\n\n\u00b63.    In July 2005, the grand jury indicted Creppel for armed robbery and aggravated\n\nassault.1 On August 2, 2005, Creppel pleaded guilty in the Jackson County Circuit Court to\n\nboth of these charges. The trial court sentenced Creppel to thirty years to be served day for\n\nday for armed robbery, and twenty years for aggravated assault, all in the custody of the\n\nMississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), with the sentences ordered to run\n\nconcurrently. Creppel filed no direct appeal after the entry of the judgments.\n\n\u00b64.    On November 24, 2010, over five years after entering his guilty pleas, Creppel filed\n\na PCR motion. The trial court denied the PCR motion as time-barred, having been filed\n\noutside of the three-year statute of limitations without any evidence of meeting an exception\n\nto the statutory time-bar. The trial court also reviewed the record and Creppel\u2019s claims, and\n\nconcluded that Creppel\u2019s PCR motion also lacked merit.\n\n       1\n           The grand jury indicted both Creppel and Melissa for armed robbery and aggravated\nassault.\n\n                                              2\n\f\u00b65.    Creppel then appealed the trial court\u2019s denial of his PCR motion, asserting that \u201chis\n\nindictment was invalid; his guilty plea was involuntarily and unknowingly made; he received\n\nineffective assistance of counsel; and he was never properly convicted.\u201d Creppel v. State,\n\n75 So. 3d 1127, 1129 (\u00b67) (Miss. Ct. App. 2011). On appeal, this Court affirmed the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s denial of Creppel\u2019s PCR motion, explaining\n\n       Creppel pleaded guilty on August 2, 2005. He filed his PCR motion on\n       November 24, 2010\u2014over five years after he had entered his guilty plea.\n       Having reviewed his PCR motion and the record, it appears Creppel has failed\n       to acknowledge the three-year statute of limitations. His brief neither\n       addresses the question of the statutory bar, nor does it provide any argument\n       or evidence that his PCR motion should be exempted from the statutory bar.\n       Likewise, we see nothing in the record that would negate application of the\n       statute of limitations to Creppel\u2019s PCR motion. As such, we cannot find error\n       in the circuit court\u2019s determination that Creppel\u2019s PCR motion is time-barred.\n       Because the statutory bar to Creppel\u2019s PCR motion is dispositive to his\n       arguments on appeal, we decline to address his claims on the merits.\n\nId. at (\u00b69).\n\n\u00b66.    On August 27, 2015, Creppel filed a second PCR motion.2 The trial court dismissed\n\nit, finding the motion time-barred. The trial court\u2019s order of dismissal reflected that\n\n       more than three years have elapsed [since the guilty plea;] therefore, the court\n       is without jurisdiction to entertain this petition. However, having reviewed the\n       record and petition, it is clear to the court that no relief would be afforded the\n       petitioner. The record is void of any mistake that would cause the court to\n       revisit this conviction or sentence.\n\nSee also Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 99-39-5(2) (Rev. 2015).\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        In his PCR motion, Creppel asserted that he also filed a PCR motion on February\n13, 2012; however, that PCR motion does not appear in the record before us.\n\n                                               3\n\f\u00b67.    Creppel then filed a notice of appeal of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his PCR motion.3\n\nOn appeal, Creppel raises the following assignments of error: (1) the trial court possessed\n\nno factual basis to accept Creppel\u2019s guilty plea; (2) the trial court erred in informing Creppel\n\nthat he could receive the maximum sentence for the charges against him; (3) the indictment\n\nfailed to charge Creppel with an essential element of the crime of armed robbery; (4) the\n\nState failed to show that Creppel was guilty of armed robbery; (5) the trial court erred in\n\nfailing to conduct an evidentiary hearing before denying his PCR motion.\n\n                                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\u00b68.    \u201cWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial or dismissal of a PCR motion, we will only\n\ndisturb the trial court\u2019s factual findings if they are clearly erroneous; however, we review the\n\ntrial court\u2019s legal conclusions under a de novo standard of review.\u201d Jackson v. State, 178 So.\n\n3d 807, 809 (\u00b68) (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n\u00b69.    The record reflects that Creppel filed the PCR motion at issue (his second PCR\n\n\n\n       3\n          The record reflects that on July 31, 2015, Creppel filed a motion for leave to\nproceed on appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court. The record does not contain an order\nfrom the supreme court ruling on this motion. Regardless, the supreme court has held that\nwhen \u201cthere has been no direct appeal of his conviction or sentence, [the petitioner] must\nfile his PCR motions in the trial court.\u201d See Jackson v. State, 67 So. 3d 725, 730 (\u00b618)\n(Miss. 2011); see also Payton v. State, 89 So. 3d 73, 75-76 (\u00b617) (Miss. Ct. App. 2011).\nThe supreme court explained that \u201cabsent either (1) a direct appeal of a conviction that is\naffirmed or dismissed followed by a [Mississippi Code Annotated] section 99-39-7 [(Rev.\n2015)] application or (2) an appeal from a circuit court's judgment denying or dismissing a\nPCR motion, it is without jurisdiction to entertain PCR matters.\u201d Lewis v. State, 181 So. 3d\n310, 314 (\u00b614) (Miss. Ct. App. 2015) (citing Jackson, 67 So. 3d at 731 (\u00b6\u00b620-22)). As a\nresult, Creppel did not need to obtain permission from the supreme court to bring another\nPCR action. See Payton, 89 So. 3d at 75-77 (\u00b6\u00b617-21).\n\n                                               4\n\fmotion) on August 27, 2015, just over ten years after being convicted upon his plea of guilty\n\nto armed robbery and aggravated assault on August 2, 2005. In dismissing this PCR motion\n\nas time-barred, the trial court explained that \u201cmore than three years have elapsed [since the\n\nguilty plea;] therefore, the court is without jurisdiction to entertain this petition.\u201d\n\n\u00b610.   Section 99-39-5(2) requires that \u201c[a] motion for relief under this article shall be made\n\n. . . in case of guilty plea, within three (3) years after entry of the judgment of conviction.\u201d\n\nThe failure to file a PCR motion within this three-year statute of limitations acts as a\n\nprocedural bar. Brandon v. State, 108 So. 3d 999, 1004 (\u00b612) (Miss. Ct. App. 2012).4\n\nHowever, several statutory and judicially created exceptions to the legislatively imposed\n\ntime-bar exist. Section 99-39-5(2)(a)-(b) exempts from the time-bar cases in which the\n\nmovant can demonstrate:\n\n       (a)(i) That there has been an intervening decision of the Supreme Court of\n              either the State of Mississippi or the United States which would have\n              actually adversely affected the outcome of his conviction or sentence\n              or that he has evidence, not reasonably discoverable at the time of trial,\n              which is of such nature that it would be practically conclusive that had\n              such been introduced at trial it would have caused a different result in\n              the conviction or sentence; or\n\n           (ii) That, even if the petitioner pled guilty or nolo contendere, or confessed\n                or admitted to a crime, there exists biological evidence not tested, or,\n                if previously tested, that can be subjected to additional DNA testing\n                that would provide a reasonable likelihood of more probative results,\n                and that testing would demonstrate by reasonable probability that the\n                petitioner would not have been convicted or would have received a\n                lesser sentence if favorable results had been obtained through such\n                forensic DNA testing at the time of the original prosecution.\n\n       (b)      Likewise excepted are those cases in which the petitioner claims that\n\n       4\n           See also Stokes v. State, 145 So. 3d 1238, 1240 (\u00b610) (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).\n\n                                                5\n\f                his sentence has expired or his probation, parole or conditional release\n                has been unlawfully revoked. Likewise excepted are filings for\n                post-conviction relief in capital cases which shall be made within one\n                (1) year after conviction.\n\n\u00b611.     \u201cIn addition to the statutory exceptions afforded by the [Uniform Postconviction\n\nCollateral Relief Act], we have provided that an exception to the procedural bars exists for\n\nerrors affecting certain constitutional rights.\u201d Rowland v. State, 98 So. 3d 1032, 1036 (\u00b66)\n\n(Miss. 2012). The movant possesses the burden to prove an exception to the three-year\n\nstatute of limitation applies. Blount v. State, 126 So. 3d 927, 931 (\u00b614) (Miss. Ct. App.\n\n2013).\n\n\u00b612.     Upon review of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Creppel\u2019s PCR motion, we find that\n\nCreppel fails to assert that any statutory exemption to the three-year statute of limitations for\n\nfiling a PCR motion applies to his case. As a result, the trial court properly found that\n\nCreppel\u2019s PCR motion was time-barred.\n\n\u00b613.     The trial court also determined, after reviewing the record and Creppel\u2019s PCR motion,\n\nthat \u201cit is clear to the court that no relief would be afforded the petitioner. The record is void\n\nof any mistake that would cause the court to revisit this conviction or sentence.\u201d Regarding\n\nCreppel\u2019s assignments of error on appeal before us, we recognize that \u201ca knowing and\n\nvoluntary guilty plea waives certain constitutional rights, among them[,] the privilege against\n\nself-incrimination, the right to confront and cross-examine the State\u2019s witnesses, the right to\n\na jury trial, and the right to have the State prove each element of the offense beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\u201d Joiner v. State, 61 So. 3d 156, 158 (\u00b67) (Miss. 2011). This Court\n\npreviously found in Creppel, 75 So. 3d at 1128 (\u00b65), that at the guilty-plea hearing the trial\n\n                                                6\n\fcourt throughly questioned Creppel \u201cabout the events of the crimes and his understanding of\n\nthe consequences of pleading guilty to the crimes.\u201d We further recognize that \u201c[a]\n\ndefendant\u2019s valid guilty plea also waives all nonjurisdictional defects or insufficiencies in\n\nthe indictment.\u201d Scurlock v. State, 147 So. 3d 894, 896 (\u00b69) (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).5\n\n\u00b614.   Additionally, a trial court \u201cmay dismiss a [PCR] motion . . . without an evidentiary\n\nhearing where it plainly appears from the face of the motion, any annexed exhibits and the\n\nprior proceedings in the case that the movant is not entitled to any relief.\u201d Pickle v. State,\n\n115 So. 3d 896, 899 (\u00b612) (Miss. Ct. App. 2013); see Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 99-39-11(2) (Rev.\n\n2015). We also acknowledge that the record reflects that in the present case, it appears that\n\nCreppel failed to request an evidentiary hearing until after the trial court dismissed his PCR\n\nmotion.\n\n\u00b615.   The record reflects that in his November 2010 PCR motion, Creppel asserted \u201chis\n\nindictment was invalid; his guilty plea was involuntarily and unknowingly made; he received\n\nineffective assistance of counsel; and he was never properly convicted.\u201d Creppel, 75 So. 3d\n\nat 1129 (\u00b67). In that case, this Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Creppel\u2019s PCR\n\nmotion as time-barred. Id. at (\u00b69). The Creppel court explained that Creppel filed his PCR\n\nmotion over five years after he had entered his guilty plea, and on appeal, his brief failed to\n\n\u201cprovide any argument or evidence that his PCR motion should be exempted from the\n\nstatutory bar. Likewise, we see nothing in the record that would negate application of the\n\n\n\n       5\n         See also Graham v. State, 151 So. 3d 242, 246 (\u00b68) (Miss. Ct. App. 2014) (Claims\nof ineffective assistance of counsel and involuntary guilty pleas are subject to the procedural\nbars.).\n\n                                              7\n\fstatute of limitations to Creppel\u2019s PCR motion.\u201d Id. This Court further held that \u201c[b]ecause\n\nthe statutory bar to Creppel\u2019s PCR motion is dispositive to his arguments on appeal, we\n\ndecline to address his claims on the merits.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b616.   Similarly, because we find that the trial court properly dismissed Creppel\u2019s present\n\nPCR motion as time-barred, we decline to address the issues Creppel raises in his brief. See\n\nMcGriggs v. State, 117 So. 3d 626, 629 (\u00b611) (Miss. Ct. App. 2012); Taylor v. State, 102 So.\n\n3d 324, 326 (\u00b69) (Miss. Ct. App. 2012). After our review of the record and claims in\n\nCreppel\u2019s PCR motion, we find that the trial court did not err in dismissing Creppel\u2019s motion.\n\n\u00b617.
