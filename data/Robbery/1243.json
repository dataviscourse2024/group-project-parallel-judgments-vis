We have examined the transcript of the proceedings and determined that it is manifest that the questions sought to he reviewed based on this record are so unsubstantial as to need no argument or formal submission. The trial judge informed the defendant of his right to jury trial and trial without a jury. Moreover, he informed the defendant that he may be sentenced to prison for life or for any term of years. Furthermore, the record obviates any concern as to whether the defendant understood the charge against him or whether his plea was understandingly made.\nWe, therefore, affirm.\n\n MCLA \u00a7 750.529 (Stat Ann 1969 Cum Supp \u00a7 28.797).\n\n",
