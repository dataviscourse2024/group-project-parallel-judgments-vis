Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\r\n1.15 (Vernon Supp. 2005).\u00a0 However, the State is not required to introduce such\r\nevidence when a guilty plea is taken before a jury.\u00a0\u00a0 Ex parte Martin,\r\n747 S.W.2d 789, 792 (Tex. Crim. App.1988); Ex Parte Taylor, 480 S.W.2d\r\n692, 693 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972).\u00a0 When the accused enters a plea of guilty\r\nbefore the jury in a felony case, he admits the existence of all necessary\r\nelements to establish guilt; the State then introduces evidence to enable the\r\njury to intelligently exercise its discretion to determine the penalty to be\r\nassessed.\u00a0 Compare Burkett v. State, 196 S.W.3d 892, 895 (Tex. App.CTexarkana 2006, no\r\npet.) with Dinnery v. State, 592 S.W.2d 343, 352 (Tex. Crim. App.\u00a0 1979)\r\n(concluding that a plea of guilty does not authorize conviction in a bench\r\ntrial unless there is evidence offered to support the plea and the judgment to\r\nbe entered).\u00a0 In such cases there is no question as to the sufficiency of the\r\nevidence on appeal, or on collateral attack.\u00a0 Ex parte Williams, 703\r\nS.W.2d 674, 678 (Tex. Crim. App.1986).\u00a0 In this case, appellant retained his\r\nright to trial by jury and voluntarily entered his guilty plea.\u00a0 Appellant\r\nmakes no claim in this appeal that his guilty plea was made involuntarily or\r\nwithout knowledge.\u00a0 Accordingly, appellant=s challenges to\r\nthe legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence are without merit.\u00a0 See Ex\r\nparte Williams, 703 S.W.2d at 678; Burkett, 196 S.W.3d at 894B95 (concluding\r\nappellant could not complain about\u00a0 the legal and factual sufficiency of the\r\nevidence because he had voluntarily pleaded guilty before the jury).\u00a0 We\r\noverrule appellant=s two issues and affirm the trial court=s judgment.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n/s/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Kem Thompson Frost\r\n\r\nJustice\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nJudgment rendered\r\nand Memorandum Opinion filed June 7, 2007.\r\n\r\nPanel consists of\r\nChief Justice Hedges, and Justices Frost and Seymore.\r\n\r\nDo Not Publish C Tex.
