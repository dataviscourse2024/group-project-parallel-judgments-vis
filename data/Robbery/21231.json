Leax, 305 S.W.3d 22, 28 (Tex.App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied).\u00a0 When a complete reporter\u2019s record is filed,\r\nthe trial court\u2019s factual findings are reviewable for legal and factual sufficiency\r\nunder the same standards that are applied in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence\r\nsupporting jury findings. \u00a0Dupree,\r\n219 S.W.3d at 616; In re C.R.O., 96 S.W.3d at\r\n447.\r\n\r\nWhen an appellant challenges the\r\nfactual sufficiency of an adverse finding upon which he had the burden of proof,\r\nhe must show that the finding was against the great weight and preponderance of\r\nthe evidence. \u00a0See Dupree, 219 S.W.3d at 616. \u00a0The\r\nreviewing court must consider and weigh all the evidence and may set aside the\r\nfinding only if the evidence is so weak or the finding is so against the great\r\nweight and preponderance of the evidence that it is clearly wrong and\r\nunjust.\u00a0 Id.\u00a0 In conducting this review, we may not\r\nsubstitute our judgment for that of the finder of fact, even if we would have\r\nreached a different conclusion when reviewing the evidence.\u00a0 Id.\r\n\r\nA trial court\u2019s conclusions of law\r\nmay not be challenged for factual sufficiency,\r\nhowever, a reviewing court may review the conclusions drawn from the facts to\r\ndetermine their correctness.\u00a0 See id.\r\n(citing BMC Software Belgium, N.V. v. Marchand, 83 S.W.3d 789, 794 (Tex. 2002)).\u00a0 If a finding that is supported by the\r\nevidence and necessary to support a conclusion is omitted, we may imply the\r\nfinding and that it supports the judgment.\u00a0\r\nSee id.\r\n\r\nThe appellees\r\ncontend that Neufeld failed to preserve any error because his factual\r\nsufficiency challenge does not challenge any specific finding of fact made by\r\nthe trial court.\u00a0 Generally, while findings\r\nof fact are reviewable for legal and factual sufficiency, an attack on the sufficiency\r\nof the evidence must be directed at specific findings of fact rather than at\r\nthe judgment as a whole. \u00a0In re an Unborn Child, 153 S.W.3d 559, 560 (Tex.App.--Amarillo 2004, pet. denied). \u00a0If the trial court's findings of fact are not\r\nchallenged by an issue on appeal, they are binding upon the appellate court. \u00a0See Nw. Park\r\nHomeowners Ass'n, Inc. v. Brundrett,\r\n970 S.W.2d 700, 704 (Tex.App.--Amarillo 1998, pet.\r\ndenied). \u00a0However, a challenge to\r\nan unidentified finding of fact may be sufficient for review if we can fairly\r\ndetermine from the argument the specific finding of fact which is being\r\nchallenged. \u00a0Shaw v. County of Dallas,\r\n251 S.W.3d 165, 169 (Tex.App.\u2014Dallas 2008, pet.\r\ndenied).\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe present case, Neufeld\u2019s issue contends that the judgment as a whole was\r\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.\u00a0 However, a review of Neufeld\u2019s argument\r\nallows this Court to fairly determine that Neufeld is challenging the factual\r\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings that \u201cHudnall was not negligent on the occasion in question and\r\ndid not proximately cause any damage to Neufeld in that Hudnall\r\nexperienced an episode which was an intervening cause [which] was unexpected,\r\nunanticipated[,] and unforeseeable;\u201d \u201cLone Star was not negligent on the\r\noccasion in question and did not proximately cause any damage to Neufeld;\u201d[1]\r\nand \u201cNo dangerous condition existed on the premises operated by Lone Star, and\r\nNeufeld was not injured as a result of any condition on the premises at the\r\ntime the accident in question occurred.\u201d[2]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Neufeld\u2019s\r\nchallenge to the trial court\u2019s finding that Hudnall\r\ndid not proximately cause Neufeld\u2019s injuries because of an unexpected,\r\nunanticipated, and unforeseen intervening cause is premised on Neufeld\u2019s\r\ncontention that the expert medical opinion evidence offered to prove the\r\nintervening cause was too speculative to constitute probative evidence.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An\r\nindependent and intervening cause destroys the causal link between a claimed\r\nact of negligence and the resulting damage.\u00a0\r\nSee Tarry Warehouse &amp; Storage Co. v. Duvall, 131 Tex.\r\n466, 115 S.W.2d 401, 405 (1938) (bright lights that blinded driver were\r\nintervening cause that broke the causal chain); Cook v.

Am. v. Myers, 411 S.W.2d 710, 713 (Tex.\r\n1966).\u00a0 Expert medical opinion evidence\r\nrelating to issues of causation \u201cmust rest in reasonable probabilities;\r\notherwise, the inference that such actually did occur can be no more than\r\nspeculation and conjecture.\u201d \u00a0Id.\u00a0 The determination of whether expert opinion\r\nevidence is based on reasonable probability depends on consideration of the\r\nsubstance of the evidence and does not turn on semantics or the use of any\r\nparticular term or phrase.\u00a0 Id.\u00a0 Expert opinion evidence regarding causation\r\nthat is not based on reasonable probability, but is rather based on speculation\r\nand surmise, is no evidence.\u00a0 See Onwuteaka v. Gill,\r\n908 S.W.2d 276, 283 (Tex.App.\u2014Houston [1st\r\nDist.] 1995, no writ).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\nthe present case, the expert medical opinion evidence offered by Lone Star\r\nconcluded that Hudnall suffered a pre-syncopal episode which led to confusion and loss of control\r\nof his vehicle.\u00a0 The expert, Kevin Funk,\r\nM.D., chronicled a number of different potential causes of this pre-syncopal episode that are consistent with Hudnall\u2019s medical history.\u00a0\r\nWhile Dr. Funk does indicate that he will \u201cassume\u201d that Hudnall suffered a pre-syncopal\r\nepisode, the context of this statement indicates that it was intended only to\r\nconvey Dr. Funk\u2019s starting hypothesis.\u00a0\r\nThe remainder of the report then identifies a number of different causes\r\nof pre-syncopal episodes that are present in Hudnall\u2019s medical history.\u00a0\r\nIt is only after discussion of Hudnall\u2019s\r\nmedical history and its correspondence to many potential causes of pre-syncopal episodes that Dr. Funk concludes that, \u201cin all\r\nreasonable medical probability, Mr. Hudnall suffered\r\na pre-syncopal episode.\u201d\u00a0 While Dr. Funk does not definitively identify\r\nwhat caused Hudnall to experience this pre-syncopal episode, he does conclude, within a reasonable\r\ndegree of medical probability, that Hudnall\r\nexperienced a pre-syncopal episode.\u00a0 Having determined that Dr. Funk\u2019s expert\r\nopinion was based on a reasonable medical probability and, therefore, probative\r\nevidence that supports the trial court\u2019s intervening cause finding, we cannot\r\nsay that the trial court\u2019s determination that this pre-syncopal\r\nepisode was an intervening cause of Neufeld\u2019s injuries was so against the great\r\nweight and preponderance of the evidence as to be clearly wrong or unjust.\u00a0 As such, we find the evidence supporting the\r\ntrial court\u2019s finding that Hudnall was not negligent\r\nbecause Hudnall\u2019s pre-syncopal\r\nepisode was an intervening cause of Neufeld\u2019s injuries is factually sufficient.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Review\r\nof Neufeld\u2019s challenge to the factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting\r\nthe trial court\u2019s finding that Lone Star was not negligent depends on the type\r\nof claim Neufeld asserted against Lone Star.\u00a0\r\nA liberal construction of Neufeld\u2019s petition reveals that Neufeld asserted\r\na claim that Lone Star was liable for its negligent hiring and retention of its\r\nemployee, Hudnall.\u00a0\r\nAccording to Neufeld, Lone Star was directly negligent because it hired\r\nand retained Hudnall in a position that required that\r\nhe operate motor vehicles near the public with knowledge that Hudnall had a history of low blood pressure and\r\ndiabetes.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An\r\nemployer who negligently hires an incompetent or unfit individual may be\r\ndirectly liable to a third party whose injury was proximately caused by the employee's\r\nnegligent or intentional act.\u00a0 See Verinakis v. Med.\r\nProfiles, Inc., 987 S.W.2d 90, 97 (Tex.App.--Houston\r\n[14th Dist.] 1998, pet. denied).\u00a0\r\nA claim of negligent hiring and retention is based on an employer's\r\ndirect negligence instead of the employer's vicarious liability for the torts\r\nof its employees.\u00a0 Id.\u00a0 To prevail in a negligence action, the\r\nplaintiff must prove: (1) a legal duty owed to the plaintiff, (2) a breach of\r\nthat duty by the defendant, and (3) damages proximately caused by the\r\nbreach.\u00a0 Greater\r\nHouston Transp. Co. v. Phillips, 801 S.W.2d 523, 525 (Tex. 1990).\u00a0 Both the duty and proximate cause elements\r\nrequired to establish a claim of negligent hiring or retention are premised on foreseeability.\u00a0 See Mellon Mortgage Co. v. Holder, 5 S.W.3d 654, 659\r\n(Tex. 1999); CoTemp, Inc. v. Houston West\r\nCorp., 222 S.W.3d 487, 492 (Tex.App.--Houston\r\n[14th Dist.] 2007, no pet.).\u00a0\r\nThus, liability under the doctrine of negligent hiring or retention is based\r\non the employer's negligence in hiring or retaining an incompetent servant whom\r\nthe master knows, or by the exercise of reasonable care should have known, was\r\nincompetent or unfit, thereby creating an unreasonable risk of harm to\r\nothers.\u00a0 See Houser v. Smith,\r\n968 S.W.2d 542, 546 (Tex.App.--Austin\r\n1998, no pet.).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There\r\nis no dispute that, at the time of the accident, Hudnall\r\nwas acting in the course and scope of his employment with Lone Star.\u00a0 The key factual issue in establishing Lone\r\nStar\u2019s liability for negligently hiring and retaining Hudnall\r\nis whether the accident was foreseeable.\u00a0\r\nThe record reflects that, when it hired Hudnall,\r\nHudnall informed Lone Star that he was on medication\r\nfor diabetes and low blood pressure.\u00a0\r\nFrom this fact, Neufeld contends that Lone Star should have foreseen\r\nthat Hudnall could experience dizziness or loss of\r\nconsciousness while operating a motor vehicle in the course and scope of his\r\nemployment.[3]\u00a0 However, the General Manager of Lone Star\r\ntestified that, at the time of Hudnall\u2019s hiring, Hudnall indicated that he did not think that his medical\r\ncondition would impact his ability to drive nor endanger customers, and, in the\r\napproximate year and a half that Hudnall worked for\r\nLone Star, Hudnall had not notified Lone Star of any\r\nhealth problems or any loss of consciousness or blackouts.\u00a0 In addition, Hudnall\r\ntestified that the only time he had experienced fainting spells or weakness was\r\nbefore he was diagnosed with diabetes and started on medication, and that those\r\nissues would have occurred sometime in 2001 or 2002, which would have been five\r\nto six years before the accident in the present case.\u00a0 Thus, considering all the evidence, we do not\r\nfind the evidence to be so weak or the finding that Lone Star was not negligent\r\nin hiring and retaining Hudnall to be so against the\r\ngreat weight and preponderance of the evidence that it is clearly wrong and\r\nunjust.\u00a0 See Dupree, 219 S.W.3d at 616.\u00a0\r\nThus, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial\r\ncourt\u2019s finding that Lone Star was not negligent and did not proximately cause\r\nNeufeld\u2019s injuries.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nother finding that Neufeld\u2019s argument fairly challenges is the sufficiency of\r\nthe evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s determination that Lone Star is not\r\nliable under the theory of premises liability.\u00a0\r\nNeufeld points to evidence that Lone Star posted no warning signs on its\r\npremises, failed to warn patrons of any unsafe areas, and Hudnall\u2019s\r\ntestimony that the auction lot was \u201ccontrolled chaos\u201d as evidence that Lone\r\nStar was aware of a dangerous condition on the premises of which it failed to\r\nwarn business invitees.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To\r\nsucceed in a premises liability suit, an invitee plaintiff must prove that (1)\r\nthe defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of some condition on the\r\npremises, (2) the condition posed an unreasonable risk of harm, (3) the\r\ndefendant failed to exercise reasonable care to eliminate or reduce the risk of\r\nthat harm, and (4) the defendant\u2019s failure to use such care proximately caused\r\nthe invitee\u2019s injury.\u00a0 Wal-Mart\r\nStores, Inc. v. Gonzalez, 968 S.W.2d 934, 936 (Tex. 1998).\u00a0 The mere fact that an injury occurred on the\r\npremises is not of itself evidence of negligence because almost any activity\r\ninvolves some risk of harm.\u00a0 Thoreson\r\nv.
