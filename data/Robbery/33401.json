The evidence, although circumstantial, was inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence and excluded to a moral certainty every other reasonable hypothesis but his guilt (see, People v Way, 59 NY2d 361, 365; People v Milea, 112 AD2d 1011, lv denied 66 NY2d 921).\nThe People\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant with respect to a prior burglary conviction did not deprive him of a fair trial (see, People v Pavao, 59 NY2d 282, 292). The fact that a defendant may specialize in one type of criminal activity should not shield him from impeachment with prior similar convictions (see, People v Rahman, 62 AD2d 968, affd 46 NY2d 882; People v Cherry, 106 AD2d 458). Mangano, J. P., Weinstein, Lawrence and Kooper, JJ., concur.\n",
