We do not find that the People were required to inform the defendant of the existence of unidentifiable smudges found at the scene (see, People v Murray, 140 AD2d 949, lv denied 72 NY2d 960).\nWe have examined the defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Rubin, J. P., Sullivan, Harwood and Balletta, JJ., concur.\n",
