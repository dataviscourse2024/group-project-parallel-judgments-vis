Fox in Orange County Superior Court. Heard in the Court of Appeals 6\n\n     October 2021.\n\n\n           Attorney General Joshua H. Stein, by Special Deputy Attorney General Brenda\n           Menard, for the State.\n\n           Appellate Defender Glenn Gerding, by Assistant Appellate Defender Sterling\n           Rozear, for defendant.\n\n\n           DIETZ, Judge.\n\n\n\u00b61         Defendant Daniel Crew appeals his convictions for dogfighting, felony cruelty\n\n     to animals, misdemeanor cruelty to animals, and restraining dogs in a cruel manner.\n\n     Crew also challenges the trial court\u2019s restitution orders totaling $70,000, which the\n\n     trial court immediately converted to civil judgments.\n\n\u00b62         As explained below, the State presented sufficient evidence to support the\n\n     dogfighting charges, and Crew\u2019s unpreserved challenge to a leading question posed\n\f                                        STATE V. CREW\n\n                                        2022-NCCOA-35\n\n                                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n     by the prosecutor at trial is meritless. We therefore find no error in Crew\u2019s criminal\n\n     convictions. We also find no error in the trial court\u2019s restitution orders, which were\n\n     supported by sufficient evidence at trial. But we hold that the trial court lacked the\n\n     authority to immediately convert those restitution orders into civil judgments. We\n\n     therefore vacate those civil judgments.\n\n                               Facts and Procedural History\n\n\u00b63         Defendant Daniel Crew ran Crew Kennels on property owned by his parents\n\n     in Rougemont. Most of the dogs he kept in his kennel were pit bulls, which he bred\n\n     and sold primarily for hunting and pulling competitions.\n\n\u00b64         In 2018, law enforcement officers arrived at the property and found 30 pit\n\n     bulls. The officers contacted Orange County Animal Services, who arrived and took\n\n     over the investigation. Animal Control Manager Irene Phipps went to the property\n\n     during the search. She found some of the dogs chained and others in \u201cabove ground\n\n     box housing.\u201d Phipps was concerned because some of the dogs had injuries, which\n\n     were \u201csimilar to injuries a dog would sustain through dogfighting.\u201d Some of the dogs\n\n     had what appeared to be topical medication applied to the skin to attempt to heal the\n\n     wounds. Phipps testified that she saw twenty dogs with no water and ten dogs with\n\n     inadequate water. Phipps also testified that some of the animals appeared unhealthy\n\n     and underweight.\n\n\u00b65         Officers also found dogfighting publications and \u201ckeep notes\u201d for preparing a\n\f                                        STATE V. CREW\n\n                                         2022-NCCOA-35\n\n                                       Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n     dog for a fight at the property. Officers took five dogs that appeared to need\n\n     immediate care to a veterinary facility and the rest to the Orange County Animal\n\n     Services shelter.\n\n\u00b66         The equipment found at the site included a device called a \u201cJenny,\u201d to which a\n\n     dog is harnessed, a spring pole, two flirt poles, heavy chains, and a treadmill with\n\n     two weighted dog collars. These items are used for exercise and conditioning to build\n\n     up a dog\u2019s strength. The site also contained areas that appeared to be staging and\n\n     dogfighting pit areas and weight scales used in organized dogfighting operations to\n\n     weigh dogs before a fight.\n\n\u00b67         Many of the dogs had injuries or significant scarring from past wounds. A\n\n     number of dogs ultimately were euthanized.\n\n\u00b68         The State charged Crew with fifteen counts of engaging in dogfighting, one\n\n     count of allowing property to be used for dogfighting, five counts of felony cruelty to\n\n     animals, twenty-five counts of misdemeanor cruelty to animals, and sixteen counts of\n\n     restraining dogs in a cruel manner.\n\n\u00b69         Dr. Clarissa Noureddine conducted two forensic examinations of the dogs. Dr.\n\n     Noureddine is the chief veterinarian at the Guilford County Animal Shelter. She was\n\n     admitted as an expert in forensic veterinary medicine. Dr. Noureddine reviewed\n\n     photos and evidence found on site, exam findings from the emergency veterinary\n\n     hospital and its veterinarian, and results of testing performed on the dogs.\n\f                                           STATE V. CREW\n\n                                           2022-NCCOA-35\n\n                                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n\u00b6 10         At trial, Dr. Noureddine described the secluded environment in which the dogs\n\n       were kept, and the items located at the site, as consistent with those found at\n\n       dogfighting operations. Dr. Noureddine also testified that the injuries the dogs\n\n       sustained indicated that the animals were engaged in trained, organized fighting, not\n\n       spontaneous fighting.\n\n\u00b6 11         Andi Morgan, Assistant Director of Orange County Animal Services, testified\n\n       that the agency incurred $92,500 in costs to house the seized dogs and provide\n\n       necessary medical care and other services. According to Morgan, the cost to house the\n\n       dogs alone was \u201ca little over 80,000.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 12         Crew moved to dismiss the dogfighting charges. The trial court granted the\n\n       motion to dismiss the charge of allowing property to be used for dogfighting. The trial\n\n       court denied the motion to dismiss as to the other dogfighting charges.\n\n\u00b6 13         The jury found Crew guilty of eleven counts of dogfighting, three counts of\n\n       felony cruelty to animals, fourteen counts of misdemeanor cruelty to animals, and\n\n       two counts of restraining dogs in a cruel manner. The trial court imposed six\n\n       consecutive active sentences of 10 to 21 months each along with several suspended\n\n       sentences. The trial court also ordered Crew to pay Orange County Animal Services\n\n       $10,000 in seven separate restitution orders that were then entered as civil\n\n       judgments, totaling $70,000 in restitution.\n\n\u00b6 14         Crew timely appealed the criminal judgments. He later petitioned for a writ of\n\f                                           STATE V. CREW\n\n                                            2022-NCCOA-35\n\n                                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       certiorari seeking review of the restitution awards entered as civil judgments.\n\n       Because, as explained below, Crew\u2019s challenge to those civil judgments has merit, in\n\n       our discretion, we allow the petition and issue of a writ of certiorari to review that\n\n       issue. N.C. R. App. P. 21.\n\n                                              Analysis\n\n          I.      Denial of motion to dismiss\n\n\u00b6 15           Crew first argues the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the\n\n       dogfighting charges. He contends that the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient to show\n\n       that he intended to use the dogs for fighting purposes.\n\n\u00b6 16           \u201cThis Court reviews the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss de novo.\u201d\n\n       State v. Smith, 186 N.C. App. 57, 62, 650 S.E.2d 29, 33 (2007). When a criminal\n\n       defendant moves to dismiss, \u201cthe trial court is to determine whether there is\n\n       substantial evidence (a) of each essential element of the offense charged, or of a lesser\n\n       offense included therein, and (b) of defendant's being the perpetrator of the offense.\u201d\n\n       State v. Earnhardt, 307 N.C. 62, 65\u201366, 296 S.E.2d 649, 651 (1982). \u201cSubstantial\n\n       evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\n\n       support a conclusion.\u201d State v. Smith, 300 N.C. 71, 78, 265 S.E.2d 164, 169 (1980). \u201cIn\n\n       making its determination, the trial court must consider all evidence admitted,\n\n       whether competent or incompetent, in the light most favorable to the State, giving\n\n       the State the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving any contradictions\n\f                                              STATE V. CREW\n\n                                              2022-NCCOA-35\n\n                                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       in its favor.\u201d State v. Rose, 339 N.C. 172, 192, 451 S.E.2d 211, 223 (1994).\n\n\u00b6 17         The crime of possession of a dog for the purpose of dogfighting is a specific\n\n       intent crime; it applies to a person \u201cwho owns, possesses, or trains a dog with the\n\n       intent that the dog be used in an exhibition featuring the baiting of that dog or the\n\n       fighting of that dog with another dog or with another animal.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-\n\n       362.2(b). Crew argues that the State did not present sufficient evidence of his intent\n\n       to commit that crime.\n\n\u00b6 18         We reject this argument. The State presented evidence that the property at\n\n       which they found the dogs contained equipment designed to increase the dogs\u2019\n\n       strength and endurance. They also recovered medication commonly used in\n\n       dogfighting operations that could be used for wound care without involving a\n\n       veterinarian. The property also contained an area that appeared to be a dogfighting\n\n       pit or training area. Finally, the officers recovered dogfighting publications and \u201ckeep\n\n       notes\u201d for preparing a dog to fight.\n\n\u00b6 19         In addition, the State presented expert testimony that many of the dogs had\n\n       scarring and parasite infections consistent with dogs who were trained and used for\n\n       dogfighting.\n\n\u00b6 20         This evidence was sufficient for a reasonable juror to find that Crew intended\n\n       to engage in dogfighting. Accordingly, the trial court did not err by denying the motion\n\n       to dismiss.\n\f                                            STATE V. CREW\n\n                                            2022-NCCOA-35\n\n                                           Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n          II.      The State\u2019s leading question during direct examination\n\n\u00b6 21            Crew next argues that the trial court plainly erred by allowing the prosecutor\n\n       to ask a leading question to Dr. Noureddine, the expert who testified about the use of\n\n       the dogs for fighting purposes.\n\n\u00b6 22            As an initial matter, Crew acknowledges that the trial court\u2019s decision to\n\n       permit this leading question was a discretionary one and that our Supreme Court and\n\n       this Court repeatedly have held that plain error review does not apply to\n\n       discretionary decisions. See, e.g., State v. Steen, 352 N.C. 227, 256, 536 S.E.2d 1, 18\n\n       (2000) (\u201c[T]his Court has not applied the plain error rule to issues which fall within\n\n       the realm of the trial court\u2019s discretion, and we decline to do so now.\u201d); State v. Smith,\n\n       194 N.C. App. 120, 126\u201327, 669 S.E.2d 8, 13 (2008) (\u201cOur Supreme Court has held,\n\n       however, that discretionary decisions by the trial court are not subject to plain error\n\n       review.\u201d). Crew thus asks this Court to invoke Rule 2 of the Rules of Appellate\n\n       Procedure to excuse his failure to preserve this issue for appellate review. We reject\n\n       this request. We can invoke Rule 2 only \u201cin exceptional circumstances\u201d that present\n\n       a manifest injustice or issues of importance in the public interest. State v. Ricks, 378\n\n       N.C. 737, 2021-NCSC-116, \u00b6 5. This case does not remotely approach that high bar.\n\n\u00b6 23            Indeed, even if we were to apply the plain error standard\u2014which, itself, is an\n\n       exceedingly high standard of review\u2014we could not find any error, much less any plain\n\n       error. Leading questions generally are not permitted during direct examination. N.C.\n\f                                              STATE V. CREW\n\n                                              2022-NCCOA-35\n\n                                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       Gen. Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 611(c). But trial courts have discretion to permit a leading\n\n       question that elicits \u201ctestimony already received into evidence without objection.\u201d\n\n       State v. Stafford, 150 N.C. App. 566, 569, 564 S.E.2d 60, 62 (2002). Here, the\n\n       prosecutor posed the following non-leading questions to Dr. Noureddine concerning\n\n       the use of the dogs for dogfighting:\n\n                    Q. Dr. Noureddine, based on your observations and\n                    examinations in this case, did you form an opinion as to\n                    whether these dogs had been or were intended to be used\n                    in organized dogfighting?\n\n                    A. Yes.\n\n                    Q. And what was that opinion?\n\n                    A. It\u2019s my opinion that the 30 dogs in this case that we have\n                    described either have been, are, or are intended to be used\n                    in organized dogfighting.\n\n       After Dr. Noureddine further described the basis for her opinion, the prosecutor then\n\n       asked the leading question that Crew challenges on appeal:\n\n                    Q. But it \u2013 it\u2019s your opinion that all of them were, in your\n                    opinion, being kept for that purpose?\n\n                    A. Yes.\n\n\u00b6 24         The trial court\u2019s decision to permit this question was well within its sound\n\n       discretion and not error, certainly not plain error, and not even remotely close to the\n\n       sort of exceptional circumstances that would justify the use of Rule 2. We therefore\n\n       reject Crew\u2019s argument.\n\f                                           STATE V. CREW\n\n                                           2022-NCCOA-35\n\n                                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n          III.   Restitution\n\n\u00b6 25         Finally, Crew challenges the trial court\u2019s seven restitution orders, which the\n\n       court converted into seven civil judgments. Those restitution orders require Crew to\n\n       pay Orange County Animal Services a total of $70,000 in restitution.\n\n\u00b6 26         This Court reviews \u201cde novo whether the restitution order was supported by\n\n       evidence at trial or sentencing.\u201d State v. Hardy, 242 N.C. App. 146, 159, 774 S.E.2d\n\n       410, 419 (2015).\n\n\u00b6 27         Crew first argues that, although the State charged him with offenses related\n\n       to thirty dogs, he was convicted only of offenses related to seventeen of those dogs.\n\n       Thus, he argues, the trial court\u2019s restitution orders impermissibly impose restitution\n\n       based on offenses for which he was not convicted, because they were based on\n\n       evidence of costs associated with all thirty of the seized animals.\n\n\u00b6 28         We reject this argument. The trial court may impose restitution for \u201cany\n\n       injuries or damages arising directly and proximately out of the offense committed by\n\n       the defendant.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.34(c). Crew\u2019s acts of engaging in\n\n       dogfighting, cruelty to animals, and restraining dogs in a cruel manner led directly\n\n       to the need to remove all thirty dogs from his possession and place them with animal\n\n       services. Employees of Orange County Animal Services testified that the shelter\n\n       spent $92,500 on care and housing of those dogs, including $80,000 solely for housing\n\n       of the animals. This evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s seven separate\n\f                                           STATE V. CREW\n\n                                           2022-NCCOA-35\n\n                                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       restitution orders, amounting to $70,000 in total restitution.\n\n\u00b6 29         Crew next argues that the trial court failed to adequately consider his ability\n\n       to pay the restitution judgments. Again, we disagree. \u201cWhether the trial court\n\n       properly considered a defendant\u2019s ability to pay when awarding restitution is\n\n       reviewed by this Court for abuse of discretion.\u201d State v. Hillard, 258 N.C. App. 94, 98,\n\n       811 S.E.2d 702, 705 (2018). \u201cAn abuse of discretion results when the court\u2019s ruling is\n\n       manifestly unsupported by reason or is so arbitrary that it could not have been the\n\n       result of a reasoned decision.\u201d State v. Triplett, 368 N.C. 172, 178, 775 S.E.2d 805,\n\n       809 (2015).\n\n\u00b6 30         Under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.36(a), a trial court determining the amount\n\n       of restitution must consider factors pertaining \u201cto the defendant\u2019s ability to make\n\n       restitution.\u201d These factors include, but are not limited to, the defendant\u2019s resources\n\n       \u201cincluding all real and personal property owned by the defendant and the income\n\n       derived from the property\u201d and \u201cthe defendant\u2019s ability to earn.\u201d Id. The trial court\n\n       need not make \u201cfindings of fact or conclusions of law on these matters.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 31         Here, there was evidence concerning Crew\u2019s ability to pay, including evidence\n\n       that the kennel Crew operated \u201cgenerate[s] good money\u201d; that a \u201cgood puppy\u201d could\n\n       sell for a thousand dollars; and that the kennel generated $15,927 of income in 2017.\n\n       There also was evidence that, although Crew has four minor dependents, he lives\n\n       with his fianc\u00e9e who has a job outside the kennel. Based on this evidence, the trial\n\f                                          STATE V. CREW\n\n                                           2022-NCCOA-35\n\n                                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       court\u2019s determination that Crew had the ability to pay the restitution award was\n\n       within the court\u2019s sound discretion and certainly not manifestly arbitrary or outside\n\n       the realm of reason.\n\n\u00b6 32         Crew responds that, although this evidence might support the trial court\u2019s\n\n       discretionary decision concerning ability to pay, the court never expressly stated that\n\n       it considered this evidence. But the law does not require the court to expressly make\n\n       this sort of statement. To be sure, if there was evidence indicating that the court did\n\n       not consider this evidence of ability to pay, or misapprehended the requirement to\n\n       consider it, we could find an abuse of discretion. But absent that indication, we\n\n       presume that the trial court knew the law and followed it. See Hillard, 258 N.C. App.\n\n       at 98, 811 S.E.2d at 705; State v. Tate, 187 N.C. App. 593, 597\u201399, 653 S.E.2d 892,\n\n       896\u201397 (2007) (holding that restitution orders will be overturned only when the trial\n\n       court \u201cdid not consider any evidence of defendant\u2019s financial condition\u201d) (emphasis in\n\n       original). We thus reject Crew\u2019s argument.\n\n\u00b6 33         Finally, Crew argues that the trial court erred by immediately converting the\n\n       restitution awards into civil judgments. The restitution statutes distinguish between\n\n       two categories of offenses: (1) those for which the victim is entitled to restitution\n\n       under the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act (VRA), and (2) those not covered by the VRA.\n\n       N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.34(b), (c). For VRA offenses falling in the first category,\n\n       the restitution statutes provide a procedure through which a trial court may convert\n\f                                            STATE V. CREW\n\n                                            2022-NCCOA-35\n\n                                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       the restitution award into a civil judgment and a corresponding procedure to enforce\n\n       that civil judgment. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.38. The restitution statutes do not\n\n       expressly address whether a restitution award for an offense in the second category\u2014\n\n       offenses not covered by the VRA\u2014can be converted into a civil judgment.\n\n\u00b6 34         In a series of unpublished cases, this Court reasoned that restitution awards\n\n       for some offenses in this second category can be converted to civil judgments based\n\n       on other, separate statutory authority. For example, in State v. Batchelor, the Court\n\n       held that although \u201cthe offense for which [the defendant] was convicted, larceny, is\n\n       not one to which the VRA applies,\u201d a separate statute, \u201cN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15-8 grants\n\n       the trial court authority to award restitution where a defendant is convicted of\n\n       stealing goods, and to \u2018make all such orders and issue such writs of restitution or\n\n       otherwise as may be necessary for that purpose.\u2019\u201d 267 N.C. App. 691, 833 S.E.2d 255,\n\n       2019 WL 4803703, at *2 (2019) (unpublished). The Court then held that \u201cgiven the\n\n       trial court\u2019s broad authorization under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15-8 to \u2018make all such orders\n\n       and issue such writs of restitution or otherwise as may be necessary,\u2019 it had the\n\n       authority to enforce, ab initio, restitution by civil judgment.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 35         We are persuaded by the reasoning of Batchelor, but unable to extend it to\n\n       justify the civil judgments in this case. Unlike Batchelor, a larceny case subject to\n\n       N.C. Gen. Stat \u00a7 15-8, there is no corresponding statute authorizing the trial court to\n\n       \u201cmake all such orders and issue such writs\u201d as are necessary to enforce the restitution\n\f                                          STATE V. CREW\n\n                                           2022-NCCOA-35\n\n                                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n       awards in this case\u2014which provide restitution to an animal services agency in a\n\n       criminal case involving charges of dogfighting and animal cruelty.\n\n\u00b6 36         The State contends that the trial court does not need any separate statutory\n\n       authority because courts have the \u201cinherent authority\u201d to convert any restitution\n\n       award to a civil judgment. But we agree with Crew that, if this were so, it would\n\n       render the language in N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.38 superfluous, counter to long-\n\n       standing principles of statutory construction. State v. Morgan, 372 N.C. 609, 614, 831\n\n       S.E.2d 254, 258 (2019). Moreover, the General Statutes contain a separate provision\n\n       that can compel a defendant charged with the offenses at issue in this case to pay the\n\n       reasonable expenses of the animal shelter that took custody of the dogs. N.C. Gen.\n\n       Stat. \u00a7 19A-70. There is no indication in the record that the animal services agency\n\n       availed itself of this statutory provision. Because there is no statutory provision\n\n       authorizing the immediate entry of civil judgments for the restitution in this case, we\n\n       vacate those civil judgments.\n\n                                           Conclusion\n\n\u00b6 37         For the reasons explained above, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s criminal\n\n       judgments but vacate the civil judgments concerning the awards of restitution.\n\n             NO ERROR IN PART; VACATED IN PART.\n\n             Judges ARROWOOD and HAMPSON concur.\n\f",
