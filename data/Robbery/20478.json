the failure of the trial court to instruct the jury on the\r\nlesser-included offense of robbery; and the entry of an affirmative deadly\r\nweapon finding.\u00a0 Finding only the latter\r\ncomplaint to have merit, we reform the judgment and affirm.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the\r\nmorning of June 29, 1999, Pedro Nistal was getting out of his car in the\r\nparking lot of the jewelry store he owned in Houston, when he heard a car\r\napproaching him at high speed.\u00a0 Turning,\r\nhe saw a woman driving, and then two men getting out of the car, one or both\r\nwearing wigs.\u00a0 The man from the front\r\nseat held an automatic pistol, and the man from the back seat held a revolver.\u00a0 Nistal recognized the former as appellant,\r\nwho had approached him in the same parking lot several weeks earlier around the\r\nsame time of the morning, accompanied at that time by the woman driving the\r\ncar. \r\n\r\nNistal\r\nreached for a gun he kept in his car, but was shot several times (he did not\r\nknow by whom) before he could take aim.\u00a0\r\nHe saw appellant=s accomplice reach over him and take his briefcase from his\r\ncar.\u00a0 Nistal suffered injuries to his\r\nright elbow, right lower leg, jaw, and abdomen; he lost the ability to walk and\r\nthe normal function of his right arm. \r\n\r\nOne of\r\nNistal=s employees, Nelly Miranda, and her\r\nhusband, Salvador Arcilla, were stopped at a red light in front of the\r\nstore.\u00a0 They saw two people running from\r\nthe parking lot, a man with short hair and a person with long hair they thought\r\nwas a woman.\r\n\r\nRosa\r\nFlores was driving nearby when she heard the gunshots, and saw a car coming out\r\nof a parking lot in reverse, driven by a woman, with a Hispanic man in the\r\nfront passenger seat.\u00a0 She saw another\r\nHispanic man with long, black hair running toward the car with a briefcase and\r\ngun.\u00a0 She drove to a nearby bank to find\r\na police officer.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nOfficer\r\nRobert Manzo, who had also heard the gunshots, returned with Ms. Flores to the\r\nparking lot, and broadcasted a description of the car and the suspects on\r\npolice radio.\u00a0 About five minutes later,\r\nOfficer Gerardo Rodriguez stopped a car matching the description with three\r\noccupants inside.\u00a0 When the officers\r\nstopped the car, the appellant was in the front passenger seat and his sister\r\nwas in the driver=s seat.\u00a0 In the\r\nbackseat, they found Walter Flores with bullets for a .357 revolver in his\r\npockets, as well as a long, black wig, a .357 Ruger revolver, a long kitchen\r\nknife, a taser or stun gun, and a black tote bag containing four bank\r\nbags.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRosa\r\nFlores identified Walter Flores as the man she saw wearing a wig and running\r\ntoward the maroon car.\u00a0 She could not\r\nidentify appellant.\u00a0 Only Pedro Nistal\r\nidentified appellant as one of the participants. \r\n\r\nIn his\r\ninterview with police, appellant admitted he and Walter Flores purchased a .357\r\nblack handgun for $50 two months earlier.\u00a0\r\nHe admitted Flores told him about the planned robbery and where it would\r\nhappen.\u00a0 His answers were inconsistent\r\nabout whether he knew the robbery was going to take place on the day it did,\r\nbut he admitted he knew Flores was carrying a bag containing a wig and the gun\r\non June 29th.\u00a0 He also said Flores\r\npromised to help him and his sister with some money for giving him a ride to the\r\nparking lot that day.\u00a0 He denied ever\r\nholding a weapon, stating Flores fired the gun, grabbed the man=s black bag, returned to the car, and\r\ntold him ALet=s go.@\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nAt\r\ntrial, appellant denied knowing the robbery was to happen, and denied knowing\r\nFlores had a gun or a wig, admitting only that he saw something Asmooth@ that was like a wig.\u00a0 He testified he gave Flores a ride only to be\r\nnice and not because he was expecting any money.\u00a0 In addition, he said he was only going to\r\ndrop Flores off and not wait for him, and denied ever getting out of the\r\ncar.\u00a0 Appellant said he had not\r\nunderstood some questions during the police interview and was nervous, as he\r\nwas from Honduras, had only a first-grade education, and could not read either\r\nEnglish or Spanish.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Legal\r\nand Factual Sufficiency\r\n\r\nIn his\r\nfirst point of error, appellant argues the evidence was legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to convict him of aggravated robbery, either as a principal or as\r\na party.\u00a0 We follow the usual standards\r\nof review.\u00a0 See Vasquez v. State,\r\n67 S.W.3d 229, 236 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002).\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\nwas charged in the indictment with threatening Pedro Nistal and placing him in\r\nfear of imminent bodily injury while in the course of committing theft and of\r\nusing or exhibiting a deadly weapon.\u00a0 See Tex. Pen. Code ' 29.03 (a)(2).\u00a0 The charge allowed the jury to convict him\r\nfor his own conduct or the conduct of another if, acting with the intent to\r\npromote or assist the commission of the offense, he solicited, encouraged,\r\ndirected, aided, or attempted to aid the other person to commit the\r\noffense.\u00a0 See Tex. Pen. Code ' 7.02(a)(2).\u00a0 Because the jury returned a general verdict,\r\nthe evidence is sufficient if it supports a finding of liability under either\r\ntheory.\u00a0 See Ladd v. State,\r\n3 S.W.3d 547, 557 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\npoints to the conflicting testimony of the eyewitnesses, the inability of some\r\nof them to identify him, and that all of the physical evidence was found by the\r\npolice in the back seat of the car near Walter Flores.\u00a0 But appellant acknowledged in his police\r\ninterview that he helped buy the gun used in the shooting, was aware of Flores=s plan and where it would take place,\r\nknew Flores had the gun and wig with him, and consented to give Flores a ride\r\nto the jewelry store parking lot on the day of the offense.\u00a0 Furthermore, Nistal identified him from their\r\nprevious encounter in the parking lot (supporting an inference that he engaged\r\nin reconnaissance in preparation for the offense), and testified that appellant\r\npointed what looked like an automatic handgun at him.\u00a0 This evidence is legally and factually\r\nsufficient to support the jury=s verdict of aggravated robbery.\u00a0 We overrule appellant=s first point of error.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lesser-Included-Offense\r\nInstruction\r\n\r\nIn his\r\nsecond point, appellant argues the trial court erred in refusing to submit an\r\ninstruction on the lesser-included offense of robbery.\u00a0 A charge on a lesser-included offense is\r\nrequired if (1) the elements of the lesser offense are included within the\r\nproof necessary to establish the greater, and (2) some evidence exists in the record to permit a jury rationally to find the\r\ndefendant guilty only of the lesser offense. Lofton v. State, 45 S.W.3d\r\n649, 651 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). The State does not contest the first prong,\r\nthat robbery can constitute a lesser-included offense of aggravated robbery.\u00a0 See Castillo v. State, 944 S.W.2d 440,\r\n442 (Tex. App.CHouston [14th Dist.] 1997, no\r\npet.).\u00a0 But the State does contest\r\nwhether there was some evidence that appellant was guilty only of the lesser\r\noffense.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a defendant presents no evidence or\r\nevidence that he did not commit any offense, he is not entitled to a\r\nlesser-included offense instruction.\u00a0 Jones\r\nv. State, 984 S.W.2d 254, 257 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998) (quoting Bignall v.\r\nState, 887 S.W.2d 21, 22 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994)).\u00a0 But if there is evidence in his testimony\r\nthat would support conviction of the lesser-included offense, it is not\r\ndispositive that this evidence conflicts with other parts or the larger theme\r\nof his testimony.\u00a0 Id.\u00a0 The jury is free to believe or disbelieve any\r\npart of a witness=s\r\ntestimony, but its verdict must be rational.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be\r\nguilty of robbery but not aggravated robbery, an accused must intend to\r\ncommit theft by threatening another with imminent bodily injury or death without\r\nthe use of a deadly weapon.\u00a0 See Tex. Pen. Code '' 29.02 &amp; 29.03.\u00a0 Appellant testified at trial this was not his\r\nintent:\r\n\r\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Y]ou planned the robbery, you wanted to\r\nrob the man, I mean, it wasn=t part of your plan that somebody would get shot, but it\r\nhappened; isn=t that true, sir?\r\n\r\nA:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I didn=t plan anything.\r\n\r\nIn fact, during his\r\ntestimony appellant denied everything C helping Flores buy a gun, planning a\r\nrobbery with him, meeting Nistal on an earlier occasion in the parking lot, or\r\neven seeing Flores with a wig, stun gun, or revolver on June 29th.\u00a0\u00a0 He testified he had never seen the revolver\r\nat issue until trial, asserting it was a Acoincidence@ that he correctly described it in\r\nhis statement as a black .357 revolver.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,\r\nhe argues on appeal that a jury could have been persuaded he was guilty only of\r\nrobbery based on the following evidence: (1) his testimony that he did not know\r\nFlores had a gun with him, (2) the stun gun found in the car shows he Amay have@ approached Nistal with it (rather\r\nthan a deadly weapon), and (3) Rosa Flores=s testimony that she only saw one man\r\nafter hearing the shots might mean he was not present when the shots were\r\nfired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold\r\nthese facts are no evidence that appellant committed the lesser crime but not\r\nthe greater.\u00a0 First, assuming a jury\r\nbelieved that appellant did not know about the deadly weapon, we do not see how\r\nthey could find he intended to rob Nistal nonetheless.\u00a0 But for the deadly weapon, there was no\r\nevidence to suggest how appellant intended that he or Flores would threaten\r\nNistal C a jewelry store owner likely to be\r\narmed[1]\r\nC with imminent bodily injury in broad\r\ndaylight in a public place.\r\n\r\nSecond,\r\nno one testified that the stun gun found in the car (or the knife, for that\r\nmatter) was used during the robbery, or that appellant and Flores intended to\r\nthreaten Nistal with it alone.[2]\u00a0 While Nistal testified that both men held\r\nguns, he described the one held by appellant as an Aautomatic pistol.@\u00a0\r\nThere was no evidence to the contrary.\u00a0\r\nWe do not think a jury could speculate from the mere existence of\r\nvarious implements somewhere in the car that Nistal was wrong and some other\r\nimplement must have been used.\r\n\r\nFinally,\r\nwe do not think a witness=s testimony that she saw one man running toward the getaway\r\ncar is evidence that only one man participated in the robbery. \u00a0Consequently, the appellant was not entitled\r\nto an instruction on the lesser-included offense of robbery, and we overrule\r\nappellant=s second point of error.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deadly\r\nWeapon Finding \r\n\r\nIn his\r\nthird point, appellant argues that because he was charged as a party and there\r\nwas no affirmative jury finding establishing that he used or exhibited the\r\nweapon himself or that he knew a deadly weapon would be used or exhibited, the\r\njudgment must be reformed to delete the finding.\u00a0 See Tex.\r\nCode Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12 ' 3g (a)(2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury\r\nfound appellant guilty of aggravated robbery, impliedly finding that as a\r\nprincipal or party he used or exhibited a deadly weapon. The trial court\r\nentered an affirmative finding of a deadly weapon by circling AYes@ on a pre\u2011printed form.\u00a0 The form did not indicate that appellant was\r\nconvicted as a party.\u00a0 The jury was the\r\ntrier of fact for guilt-innocence and punishment.\u00a0 Consequently, the jury was the proper fact\r\nfinder to decide the deadly weapon issue.\u00a0\r\nDavis v. State, 897 S.W.2d 791, 793 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995).\r\n\r\nOur\r\nsister court has held that to find a person guilty of aggravated robbery as a\r\nparty, a jury must find the defendant intended the use or exhibition of the\r\ndeadly weapon, and thus a separate deadly-weapon finding by the jury is not\r\nnecessary.\u00a0 Johnson v. State, 6\r\nS.W.3d 709 (Tex. App.CHouston [1st Dist.] 1999, pet. ref=d). \u00a0However, this Court has repeatedly held to\r\nthe contrary.\u00a0 See, e.g., Taylor v.\r\nState, 7 S.W.3d 732, 740B41 (Tex. App.CHouston [14th Dist.] 1999, no pet.); Tate v. State,\r\n939 S.W.2d 738, 753B54 (Tex. App.CHouston [14th Dist.] 1997, pet. ref=d); Pritchett v. State, 874\r\nS.W.2d 168, 172 (Tex. App.CHouston [14th Dist.] 1994, pet. ref=d).\u00a0\r\nOther courts of appeals appear to agree with our previous opinions. \u00a0Barnes v. State, 62 S.W.3d 288, 303B04 (Tex. App.CAustin 2002, pet. ref=d); Enlow v. State, 46 S.W.3d\r\n340, 345 (Tex. App.CTexarkana 2001, pet. ref=d).\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nShort of\r\nen banc consideration, we must follow our previous cases.\u00a0 See\r\nO=Connor\r\nv. First Court of Appeals, 837\r\nS.W.2d 94, 96 (Tex. 1992) (stating decision of panel constitutes decision of\r\nthe whole court unless court chooses to hear case en banc).\u00a0\r\nThus, we\r\nsustain appellant=s third point of error and order that the affirmative deadly\r\nweapon finding be deleted from the judgment.\r\n\r\nAs\r\nreformed, we affirm the trial court=s judgment.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n/s/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scott\r\nBrister\r\n\r\nChief Justice\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nJudgment rendered and\r\nOpinion filed June 27, 2002.\r\n\r\nPanel consists of Chief\r\nJustice Brister and Justices Fowler and Seymore.\r\n\r\nDo Not Publish C Tex.\r\nR.
