J.:\n\n              This is an appeal from the November 7, 2016, order denying Michael Keith\n\nAllman\u2019s (hereinafter \u201cpetitioner\u201d) motion for a new trial on his convictions of felony\n\nescape, destruction of property, and petit larceny and resultant November 9, 2016,\n\nsentencing order. Petitioner argues that his sentence on the felony escape conviction is\n\n\u201cdisproportionate\u201d to the offense because he was ultimately found guilty only of a\n\nmisdemeanor, rather than a felony, on the underlying charge from which he escaped.\n\nPetitioner further argues as to both the felony escape and related destruction of property\n\nconvictions that the circuit court erred in failing to grant a new trial on the basis of newly-\n\ndiscovered, exculpatory evidence. Finally, as to the underlying petit larceny conviction,\n\npetitioner asserts that the circuit court erred in permitting the State to elect to prosecute the\n\nfelony escape and destruction of property charges prior to the underlying grand larceny\n\ncharge.\n\n\n\n              Upon careful review of the briefs, the appendix record, the arguments of the\n\nparties, and the applicable legal authority, we find that the circuit court committed no\n\nreversible error and therefore affirm petitioner\u2019s conviction and the circuit court\u2019s denial\n\nof a new trial.\n\n\n\n                      I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n              Petitioner was charged with grand larceny after he was discovered on\n\nsurveillance video removing a purse from a vehicle in the parking lot of a laundromat. The\n\n                                               1\n\n\fpurse allegedly contained $225 in cash, a ring valued at $1,992, two additional rings, a\n\ncheckbook, and other miscellaneous items. Petitioner was placed on home confinement as\n\na condition of his bond; he was ordered while on home confinement to remain at his\n\nresidence, not consume or have in his presence any illegal substance or alcohol, and to\n\nwear a GPS monitoring bracelet.\n\n\n\n              While he was on home confinement, the Wood County Sheriff\u2019s Office\n\nreceived an electronic alert that petitioner had cut his monitoring bracelet strap. Upon\n\ninvestigation, petitioner was discovered several blocks from his residence and his cut\n\nbracelet was found on the mantle at his home. Upon being apprehended and transported\n\nto the Wood County Holding Center, petitioner stated that he had \u201ctaken some nerve pills\n\nand heroin earlier.\u201d He was taken to Camden-Clark Medical Center for medical clearance\n\nwhere he again indicated that he had \u201cdone heroin before he went to bed last night and\n\ntaken some klonopin that was not prescribed to him.\u201d\n\n\n\n              Thereafter, petitioner was indicted in Wood County on one count of grand\n\nlarceny arising out of the laundromat theft, one count of destruction of property as a result\n\nof destroying his monitoring bracelet, and felony escape. In advance of trial, petitioner\n\nmoved to sever the grand larceny charge from the escape and destruction of property\n\ncharges. In his motion, petitioner asked the circuit court to \u201csever the charges as requested\n\nin this motion and require the State of West Virginia to elect which particular count[s] that\n\nthe State wishes to try in the first trial.\u201d The circuit court granted the motion and the State\n\n                                              2\n\n\felected to try the escape and destruction of property charges first. Petitioner was thereafter\n\nconvicted of escape and destruction of property.\n\n\n\n              Subsequent to the first trial, petitioner moved for a new trial on the basis that\n\nnew evidence had been discovered.         Specifically, petitioner argued that his counsel\n\nobtained his medical records from Camden-Clark Medical Center demonstrating that he\n\nwas intoxicated on the day of the escape and destruction of property. Petitioner argued this\n\nwould tend to negate specific intent and therefore required a new trial. The circuit court\n\ndenied the motion, finding that the evidence was not new and was well-known to petitioner\n\nand his counsel at the time of trial. The circuit court further found that escape and\n\ndestruction of property are general intent crimes, neither of which is susceptible to an\n\nintoxication defense.\n\n\n\n              Petitioner was then tried on the grand larceny charge. However, the jury\n\nreturned a verdict of guilty as to petit larceny, a lesser-included charge and misdemeanor.\n\nPetitioner was then sentenced to one year on the petit larceny, three years for escape, and\n\nsix months for destruction of property. The misdemeanor petit larceny and destruction of\n\nproperty sentences were ordered to be served concurrently, with the escape sentence to be\n\nserved consecutively thereto. This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\n\f                            II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n             Generally,\n\n                    [i]n reviewing challenges to findings and rulings made\n             by a circuit court, we apply a two-pronged deferential standard\n             of review. We review the rulings of the circuit court concerning\n             a new trial and its conclusion as to the existence of reversible\n             error under an abuse of discretion standard, and we review the\n             circuit court\u2019s underlying factual findings under a clearly\n             erroneous standard. Questions of law are subject to a de novo\n             review.\n\nSyl. Pt. 3, State v. Vance, 207 W. Va. 640, 535 S.E.2d 484 (2000). More specifically,\n\n\u201c\u2018[w]here the issue on an appeal from the circuit court is clearly a question of law or\n\ninvolving an interpretation of a statute, we apply a de novo standard of review.\u2019 Syllabus\n\npoint 1, Chrystal R.M. v. Charlie A.L., 194 W. Va. 138, 459 S.E.2d 415 (1995).\u201d Syl. Pt.\n\n1, State v. Paynter, 206 W. Va. 521, 526 S.E.2d 43 (1999). Finally, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court\n\nof Appeals reviews sentencing orders, including orders of restitution made in connection\n\nwith a defendant\u2019s sentencing, under a deferential abuse of discretion standard, unless the\n\norder violates statutory or constitutional commands.\u201d Syl. Pt. 1, State v. Lucas, 201 W.\n\nVa. 271, 496 S.E.2d 221 (1997). With these standards in mind, we proceed to petitioner\u2019s\n\nassignments of error.\n\n\n\n                                   III. DISCUSSION\n\n             Petitioner asserts three assignments of error.     First, petitioner makes a\n\nconstitutional challenge to his felony escape sentence contending that it was\n\n\u201cdisproportionate\u201d inasmuch as he was ultimately only convicted of a misdemeanor on the\n\n\n                                            4\n\n\funderlying charge from which he escaped. Secondly, as to the escape and destruction of\n\nproperty charges, petitioner asserts that he is entitled to a new trial on the basis of newly\n\ndiscovered evidence, i.e. medical records demonstrating his intoxication at the time of the\n\nescape. Finally, petitioner asserts that the circuit court erred in permitting the State to elect\n\nto try the escape and destruction of property charges first, rather than the underlying grand\n\nlarceny offense.\n\n\n\nA.     FELONY ESCAPE UPON MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION ON UNDERLYING OFFENSE\n\n              We begin with petitioner\u2019s most substantive assignment of error, which\n\npresents an issue of first impression: whether an individual can be convicted of felony\n\nescape when he or she is ultimately convicted only of a misdemeanor on the charge from\n\nwhich he or she was \u201cescaping.\u201d\n\n\n\n              We note first that although petitioner frames this challenge as one of\n\nconstitutionality, i.e. a disproportionate sentence in violation of Article III, Section 5 of the\n\nWest Virginia Constitution, it is plain that petitioner is attacking the conviction on its\n\nmerits. Petitioner alleges nothing substantively \u201cdisproportionate\u201d about the sentence he\n\nreceived under the statute. The statute provides for one to five years in the penitentiary\n\nand petitioner received a sentence of three years on this charge. \u201cSentences imposed by\n\nthe trial court, if within statutory limits and if not based on some [im]permissible factor,\n\nare not subject to appellate review.\u201d Syl. Pt. 4, State v. Goodnight, 169 W.Va. 366, 287\n\nS.E.2d 504 (1982). Clearly, petitioner\u2019s sentence was within statutory limits and petitioner\n\n\n                                               5\n\n\fidentifies no \u201cimpermissible factor\u201d utilized by the circuit court. Despite the absence of\n\nconstitutional magnitude as framed by petitioner, however, it is clear that he has raised an\n\nissue of statutory construction requiring this Court\u2019s de novo review.\n\n\n\n              Accordingly, we begin with an analysis of our escape statute. West Virginia\n\nCode \u00a7 61-5-10 (2000) provides:\n\n                      Whoever escapes or attempts to escape by any means\n              from the custody of a county sheriff, the director of the regional\n              jail authority, an authorized representative of said persons, a\n              law-enforcement officer, probation officer, employee of the\n              division of corrections, court bailiff, or from any institution,\n              facility, or any alternative sentence confinement, by which he\n              or she is lawfully confined, if the custody or confinement is by\n              virtue of a charge or conviction for a felony, is guilty of a felony\n              and, upon conviction thereof, shall be confined in a\n              correctional facility for not more than five years; and if the\n              custody or confinement is by virtue of a charge or conviction\n              for a misdemeanor, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon\n              conviction thereof, he or she shall be confined in a county or\n              regional jail for not more than one year.\n\n(emphasis added).1 Petitioner argues that because he was ultimately convicted only of a\n\nmisdemeanor, he cannot be guilty of having escaped from custody or confinement arising\n\nout of a felony. Respondent counters that the plain language of the statute provides that\n\none can be guilty of felony escape if he or she escapes from custody or confinement arising\n\nfrom a \u201ccharge or conviction for a felony[.]\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Indisputably,\n\npetitioner was on home confinement as the result of a felony charge. Respondent urges\n\n\n\n       1\n        The federal escape statute is worded similarly, providing for a felony charge of\nescape \u201cif the custody or confinement is by virtue of an arrest on a charge of felony, or\nconviction of any offense . . . .\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 751 (1994) (emphasis added).\n                                               6\n\n\fthat it is of no moment, therefore, that he was not ultimately convicted of a felony under\n\nthe wording of the statute. Respondent further notes that other courts have likewise held\n\nthat where a statute provides for escape charges based upon pre-conviction detention,\n\ncourts must look to the nature of the charges at the time of the escape.\n\n\n\n              In support of his position, petitioner cites to two purportedly analogous cases\n\nin which this Court held that if a conviction underlying an escape charge is ultimately found\n\nto be void or voidable on appeal, a conviction of escape will not lie. In Syllabus Point 1 of\n\nState v. Pishner, 73 W. Va. 744, 81 S.E. 1046 (1914), the Court held:\n\n                     A prisoner who escapes from jail by force and violence,\n              pending the determination of a writ of error to a judgment of\n              conviction for a felony resulting in a reversal thereof and a\n              discharge of the prisoner, does not thereby violate Sec. 11, Ch.\n              147, serial section 5239, Code 1913.\n\nOver fifty years later, this Court reiterated this holding in State ex rel. Robison v. Boles,\n\n149 W. Va. 516, 142 S.E.2d 55 (1965) finding that \u201c\u2018[t]he escape from custody, of a person\n\nconfined in the penitentiary under a void judgment and sentence, does not constitute a\n\ncrime and a conviction therefore is likewise void.\u2019\u201d (quoting Syl. Pt. 3, State ex rel.\n\nMcGilton v. Adams, 143 W. Va. 325, 102 S.E.2d 145 (1958)).2 Petitioner argues that he\n\n\n       2\n         We observe that Pishner was a 3-2 decision subject to a strong dissent astutely\nnoting that this holding effectively stood for the proposition that \u201cone erroneously\nconvicted of a felony and sentenced therefor, though lawfully imprisoned by the judgment\nof a court of competent jurisdiction, may break jail without violating the [law].\u201d Id. at 748,\n81 S.E. at 1048 (Robinson, J., dissenting). As such, the opinion \u201ctells one convicted and\nsentenced for felony that he may be his own judge of the soundness of his conviction and\nsentence and take chances on its being reversed as against the penitentiary penalty for jail\n\n                                              7\n\n\fmerely violated a condition of his pre-trial bond by removing his electronic bracelet and\n\nleaving his home and that he was never found guilty of a felony arising from his custody\n\nor confinement.\n\n\n\n              However, petitioner fails to recognize a critical difference in the wording of\n\nthe statute at the time these cases were decided and the one under which he stands\n\nconvicted. The escape statutes in effect at the time the Court decided Pishner and Robison\n\nprovided that \u201c\u2018[a] person confined in jail on conviction of a criminal offence, who escapes\n\nthence by force or violence, shall be confined in the penitentiary one year . . . .\u2019\u201d Pishner,\n\n73 W. Va. at 745, 81 S.E. at 1047 (emphasis added). A \u201cconviction,\u201d therefore was a\n\nnecessary element of the crime. The statutes at that time did not make provision for escape\n\nwhile confined on an as-yet unprosecuted criminal charge.\n\n\n\n              The unambiguous language of the current statute unequivocally forecasts the\n\nresolution of this issue. \u201c[I]f the legislative intent is clearly expressed in the statute, this\n\nCourt is not at liberty to construe the statutory provision, but is obligated to apply its plain\n\nlanguage.\u201d Dan\u2019s Carworld, LLC v. Serian, 223 W. Va. 478, 484, 677 S.E.2d 914, 920\n\n(2009). See also Syl. Pt. 2, Crockett v. Andrews, 153 W.Va. 714, 172 S.E.2d 384 (1970)\n\n(\u201cWhere the language of a statute is free from ambiguity, its plain meaning is to be accepted\n\nand applied without resort to interpretation.\u201d); Syl. Pt. 5, State v. General Daniel Morgan\n\n\nbreaking.\u201d Id. at 748-749, 81 S.E. at 1048. See also McGilton, 143 W. Va. at 331, 102\nS.E.2d at 148 (noting Pishner as \u201capparently representing the minority view on this\nquestion\u201d).\n                                               8\n\n\fPost No. 548, V.F.W., 144 W. Va. 137, 107 S.E.2d 353 (1959) (\u201cWhen a statute is clear\n\nand unambiguous and the legislative intent is plain, the statute should not be interpreted by\n\nthe courts, and in such case it is the duty of the courts not to construe but to apply the\n\nstatute.\u201d). West Virginia Code \u00a7 61-5-10 clearly provides that one who escapes from\n\nlawful confinement is guilty of the felony offense of escape, if the custody or confinement\n\nfrom which he or she escapes \u201cis by virtue of a charge or conviction for a felony[.]\u201d\n\nAccordingly, when being prosecuted for felony escape \u201cby virtue of a charge . . . for a\n\nfelony,\u201d the focus is on the nature of the charges from which the individual escaped lawful\n\ncustody. It is therefore irrelevant whether he or she is ultimately convicted only of a\n\nmisdemeanor offense stemming from the underlying charge.\n\n\n\n              The Legislature\u2019s wisdom in this regard is apparent. The offense of escape\n\nis clearly designed to serve as deterrent to escape from lawful custody, regardless of the\n\nstatus of the underlying proceedings. Escape statutes are \u201cintended to protect our jails from\n\nforce and violence, and further to secure a holding of those convicted of crimes until the\n\nday of their punishment.\u201d Pishner, 73 W. Va. at 748, 81 S.E. at 1048 (Robinson, J.,\n\ndissenting). That purpose is not lessened by virtue of the nature or timing of the custody,\n\nwhether it be pre-conviction or post-conviction. Neither guilt nor innocence have been\n\nadduced at the \u201ccharge\u201d juncture, but one cannot deny the equal necessity of protecting\n\nthose charged with confining such individuals pending trial and providing a strong\n\ndisincentive to those in custody to breach that custody. The statute\u2019s intended breadth to\n\nencompass escape on a pre-conviction charge is made patent by the litany of individuals\n\n                                             9\n\n\fand facilities from which one may be guilty of escape\u2014many of whom maintain lawful\n\ncustody prior to conviction: \u201ca county sheriff, the director of the regional jail authority, an\n\nauthorized representative of said persons, a law-enforcement officer, probation officer,\n\nemployee of the Division of Corrections, court bailiff, or [] any institution, facility, or any\n\nalternative sentence confinement[.]\u201d W. Va. Code \u00a7 61-5-10.           Moreover, the ultimate\n\noutcome of the charge is immaterial to the fact that the escape in fact occurred while under\n\ncustody or confinement due to a pending felony charge. See Com v. Stoppard, 103 A.3d\n\n120, 124 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2014) (upholding felony escape conviction where \u201cat the time\n\nAppellant fled\u201d he had been charged with felonies which were later withdrawn).\n\n\n\n              We therefore hold that an individual charged with a felony who escapes from\n\nlawful confinement as prescribed in West Virginia Code \u00a7 61-5-10 may be convicted of\n\nthe offense of felony escape irrespective of the ultimate outcome of the charge for which\n\nhe or she was in lawful custody or confinement. Accordingly, contrary to his assertion,\n\npetitioner did not merely violate a condition of his home confinement; he breached the very\n\nconfinement to which he was subject and, commensurately, the provisions of West Virginia\n\nCode \u00a7 61-5-10. Accordingly, we find no error in petitioner\u2019s conviction of the crime of\n\nfelony escape.\n\n\n\nB.     NEWLY-DISCOVERED EVIDENCE\n\n              Petitioner next asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a\n\nnew trial as to the escape and destruction of property charges on the basis of newly-\n\n\n                                              10 \n\n\fdiscovered evidence. Petitioner argues that his second counsel (appointed after the first\n\nattorney tried the escape and destruction of property case) obtained medical records\n\ndemonstrating his intoxication at the time of the escape and destruction of property that\n\nwould have been relevant in his escape trial. This Court has held:\n\n                    \u201cA new trial will not be granted on the ground of newly-\n             discovered evidence unless the case comes within the\n             following rules: (1) The evidence must appear to have been\n             discovered since the trial, and, from the affidavit of the new\n             witness, what such evidence will be, or its absence\n             satisfactorily explained. (2) It must appear from facts stated in\n             his affidavit that plaintiff was diligent in ascertaining and\n             securing his evidence, and that the new evidence is such that\n             due diligence would not have secured it before the verdict. (3)\n             Such evidence must be new and material, and not merely\n             cumulative; and cumulative evidence is additional evidence of\n             the same kind to the same point. (4) The evidence must be such\n             as ought to produce an opposite result at a second trial on the\n             merits. (5) And the new trial will generally be refused when the\n             sole object of the new evidence is to discredit or impeach a\n             witness on the opposite side.\u201d Syllabus Point 1, Halstead v.\n             Horton, 38 W.Va. 727, 18 S.E. 953 (1894).\n\nSyl., State v. Frazier, 162 W. Va. 935, 253 S.E.2d 534 (1979).\n\n\n\n             We find that there is no reasonable basis upon which this information may\n\nbe characterized as \u201cnewly-discovered.\u201d Petitioner reported to the officers and medical\n\npersonnel upon being apprehended after his escape that he had used heroin and non-\n\nprescribed Klonopin. The only \u201cnew\u201d evidence according to petitioner\u2019s counsel is the\n\n\n\n\n                                            11 \n\n\factual medical records demonstrating the level of his intoxication. 3 Medical records\n\ndemonstrating petitioner\u2019s intoxication\u2014which were known and available to petitioner and\n\nhis counsel during trial\u2014satisfy none of the Frazier requirements.4 Accordingly, we find\n\nno error in the circuit court\u2019s denial of a new trial.\n\n\n\nC.     SEVERANCE/ELECTION OF ORDER OF TRIALS\n\n              Finally, petitioner claims that the circuit court erred by allowing the State to\n\nprosecute the escape and destruction of property charges first. Petitioner maintains that if\n\nthe grand larceny were tried first, he would have then been in a position to introduce\n\nevidence of his misdemeanor petit larceny conviction in the escape trial.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         Moreover, we note that general intent crimes\u2014such as escape and destruction of\nproperty\u2014are not susceptible to intoxication defense; accordingly this information would\nhave been ultimately inadmissible. See State v. Skidmore, 228 W. Va. 166, 171, 718 S.E.2d\n516, 521 (2011) (\u201cThis Court has recognized that voluntary intoxication does not ordinarily\nexcuse a crime. Voluntary intoxication may, however, reduce the degree of the crime or\nnegate a specific intent.\u201d (citations omitted)); R. W. Gascoyne, Annotation, Modern Status\nof the Rules as to Voluntary Intoxication as Defense to Criminal Charge, 8 A.L.R. 3d 1236\n\u00a74(a) (1966) (\u201cThe definitions of certain offenses include a specific intent to do certain\nthings for a specific purpose, while as to ordinary offenses, the general criminal intent\nnecessary to conviction is deduced from the doing of the criminal act.\u201d (emphasis added)).\n       4\n         Further, as the circuit court noted, petitioner\u2019s first attorney may not have\nintroduced that evidence for tactical reasons. During oral argument before this Court,\npetitioner\u2019s counsel conceded that any assertion that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel should have\nobtained such information is better suited for habeas review under an ineffective assistance\nof counsel claim.\n\n\n                                               12 \n\n\f              We find that this error, if any, was invited by petitioner. In his motion to\n\nsever the charges, petitioner stated: \u201cTherefore, the Defendant requests that the Honorable\n\nCourt sever the charges as requested in this motion and require the State of West Virginia\n\nto elect which particular count[s] that the State wishes to try in the first trial.\u201d (emphasis\n\nadded). It is well-established that \u201c[a] litigant may not silently acquiesce to an alleged\n\nerror, or actively contribute to such error, and then raise that error as a reason for reversal\n\non appeal.\u201d Syl. Pt. 1, Maples v. W. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Commerce, Div. of Parks &\n\nRecreation, 197 W. Va. 318, 475 S.E.2d 410 (1996).5 We therefore likewise find that the\n\ncircuit court committed no reversible error in permitting the escape and destruction of\n\nproperty charges to be tried first.\n\n\n\n                                      IV. CONCLUSION\n\n              Based upon the foregoing, the November 7, 2016, and November 9, 2016,\n\norders of the Circuit Court of Wood County are hereby affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                                                Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         Moreover, given our conclusion hereinabove that felony escape may be founded\non a felony charge or conviction, evidence of the misdemeanor conviction would have\nlikely been immaterial.\n                                              13 \n\n\f",
