Braman CA1/4\n                      NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN OFFICIAL REPORTS\nCalifornia Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for\npublication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). This opinion has not been certified for publication\nor ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115.\n\n\n              IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA\n\n                                       FIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\n                                                 DIVISION FOUR\n\n\nTHE PEOPLE,\n         Plaintiff and Respondent,\n                                                                     A135345\nv.\nROBERT LEE BRAMAN,                                                   (Napa County\n                                                                     Super. Ct. No. CR158559)\n         Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         Appellant, Robert Lee Braman, was charged with possessing methamphetamine\n(Health & Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377, subd. (a)), and possessing a syringe (Bus. & Prof. Code,\n\u00a7 4140, a misdemeanor). It was also alleged that appellant suffered a prior strike (Pen.\nCode, \u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i)), and a prior prison term (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).\n         Pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant pled no contest to the possession of\nmethamphetamine charge and admitted the prior strike. The misdemeanor and the prior\nprison were dismissed.\n         At sentencing, appellant\u2019s motion to strike the strike was denied, as was probation.\nOn the possession of methamphetamine conviction, appellant was sentenced to the low\nterm of 1 year and 4 months, doubled for the strike, for a total of 32 months.\n         Appellant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the trial court abused its discretion in\nfailing to strike appellant\u2019s prior \u201cstrike\u201d conviction. The prior was a 1984 robbery\nconviction. In exercising its discretion, the court stated: \u201c. . . I looked at this very closely\nbut I just simply don\u2019t see it in the interests of justice under [Penal Code] section 1385 to\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\fgrant the Romero1 motion. In particular in light of what we have over the last 10 years\nwhere we have a repeated sentence to state prison, and the motion under Romero is\ndenied.\u201d\n        The trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to strike the prior\n        conviction\n        A Romero motion is subject to review for abuse of discretion. (People v. Williams\n(1998) 17 Cal.4th 148.) The appellant bears the burden of showing that the decision to\ndecline to strike a \u201cstrike\u201d was arbitrary and irrational. (People v. Carmony (2004) 33\nCal.4th 367, 374, 376.) Appellant has not carried that burden.\n        The present conviction was appellant\u2019s 20th felony conviction. Since his \u201cstrike\u201d\nconviction, appellant has committed 14 felonies, including the present offense. During\nthat time, appellant has been sentenced to state prison nine times. As counsel for\nappellant candidly concedes, appellant is \u201cclearly a recidivist.\u201d Not surprisingly,\nappellant was evaluated in the probation report as a \u201chigh risk to reoffend.\u201d\n        In short, there is nothing in appellant\u2019s record to recommend the striking of the\nstrike, and certainly no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in denying the\ninvitation to do so.\n        The judgment is affirmed.\n\n                                                   _________________________\n                                                   REARDON, J.\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nRUVOLO, P.
