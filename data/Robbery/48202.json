            "opinion_text": "\nOPINION OF THE COURT\nSCIRICA, Circuit Judge.\nJoseph Wise seeks habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. His habeas corpus petition raises various procedural and constitutional objections to his conviction for robbery and related offenses. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania challenged Wise\u2019s petition on the ground that it constitutes an abuse of the writ. The district court dismissed the petition for failure to exhaust state remedies. Because we believe that the abuse of the writ inquiry should have been undertaken before exhaustion was addressed, we will vacate and remand for consideration whether Wise\u2019s habeas corpus petition is barred under McCleskey v. Zant, \u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991).\nI.\nOn June 11, 1979, Wise was arrested and charged with robbery, conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime in connection with the armed robbery of a Philadelphia Savings Fund Society Bank. He was convicted by a jury in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas of all three charges. On October 23, 1980, the court sentenced Wise to seven and one-half to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment on the robbery conviction only.\nWise appealed to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. The Superior Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment of sentence on April 30, 1982, and Wise filed a pro se petition for allowance of appeal (allocatur petition) with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. This petition was denied on March *324,1983.1 Wise then turned to federal court and filed the first of six petitions for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.\nOn December 7, 1983, the district court dismissed Wise\u2019s first habeas corpus petition for failure to exhaust state remedies. Shortly thereafter, Wise filed a second petition, which was dismissed for the same reason on January 9, 1984. Later that month, Wise filed a third habeas corpus petition, this time alleging only that his Miranda rights had been violated. This claim was deemed exhausted, and was denied on the merits by the district court on May 9, 1985.\nOn August 13, 1985, Wise returned to state court and filed a Post Conviction Hearing Act, 42 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 9541 et seq. (1982) (superseded), petition and request for appointment of counsel with the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. Wise\u2019s court-appointed counsel filed an amended petition. Meanwhile, Wise filed two additional habeas corpus petitions in federal court, both of which were dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies. On February 3, 1988, the Court of Common Pleas denied Wise\u2019s PCHA petition, including both the pro se and counselled claims.\nWise appealed to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. Both pro se and counselled briefs were filed. The Superior Court, 391 Pa.Super. 643, 563 A.2d 196, affirmed the trial court\u2019s order denying relief on May 30, 1989, and Wise filed an allocatur petition with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Wise\u2019s court-appointed counsel also filed a petition. Both petitions were denied on November 6, 1989, prompting Wise to return to federal court and file the instant habeas corpus petition on January 23,1990.\nWise\u2019s latest habeas corpus petition alleges a full and fair hearing claim and the six constitutional claims raised in his alloca-tur petition to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.2 The Commonwealth challenged this petition on the ground that it constitutes an abuse of the writ in violation of Rule 9(b) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, Rule 9(b). The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that Wise\u2019s habeas corpus petition be dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies, which was approved and adopted by the district court on October 31, 1990. Wise v. Fulcomer, No. 90-0487, 1990 WL 69059 (E.D.Pa.1990).3 This appeal followed.\nII.\nWe granted a certificate of probable cause to appeal and appointed counsel to represent Wise. On appeal Wise contends that the district court erred in dismissing his habeas corpus petition for failure to exhaust state remedies. The Commonwealth renews its contention that Wise\u2019s *33petition constitutes an abuse of the writ.4 The question before us is whether the district court should have addressed the Commonwealth\u2019s abuse of the writ argument before reaching the exhaustion issue. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is plenary. Hankins v. Fulcomer, 941 F.2d 246, 249 (3d Cir.1991).\nA.\n\u201cThe writ of habeas corpus is the fundamental instrument for safeguarding individual freedom against arbitrary and lawless state action.\u201d Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 290-91, 89 S.Ct. 1082, 1086, 22 L.Ed.2d 281 (1969). Federal courts may grant habeas corpus relief on behalf of any person held in custody pursuant to a judgment of a state court in violation of the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a).\nThe Supreme Court has long recognized that habeas corpus jurisprudence is governed by equitable principles, and \u201cthat a suitor\u2019s conduct ... may disentitle him to the relief he seeks.\u201d Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 17, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 1078, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963). These principles have spawned certain procedural prerequisites.\nFor example, as a general rule, federal courts may not grant habeas corpus relief \u201cunless it appears the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b). A claim is not exhausted until it has been \u201cfairly presented to the state courts.\u201d Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351, 109 S.Ct. 1056, 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 380 (1989); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(c).5 As we have explained, the exhaustion requirement \u201crests upon the principles of comity and judicial economy. The requirement provides state courts with an initial opportunity to consider and correct alleged violations of prisoners\u2019 rights without disruption from the federal courts.\u201d Hankins, 941 F.2d at 249.\nAlthough the exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional, \u201cwe have held that the requirement should be strictly adhered to because it expresses respect for our dual judicial system.\u201d Landano v. Rafferty, 897 F.2d 661, 668 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 46, 112 L.Ed.2d 23 (1990); see also Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 515, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 1201, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1981). In certain instances, however, lack of exhaustion may be excused. United States ex. rel. Trantino v. Hatrack, 563 F.2d 86, 95 (3d Cir.1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 928, 98 S.Ct. 1499, 55 L.Ed.2d 524 (1978).6\nWhen a state prisoner files successive petitions for habeas corpus relief he may also be subject to the abuse writ doctrine. Under this doctrine, a federal court need not entertain a subsequent habeas corpus petition\nunless [it] alleges and is predicated on a factual or other ground not adjudicated on the hearing of the earlier application for the writ, and unless the [federal] court ... is satisfied that the applicant has not on the earlier application deliberately withheld the newly asserted ground or otherwise abused the writ.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b);\n*34see also id. \u00a7 2254, Rule 9(b).7\nAs set forth by the Supreme Court in McCleskey v. Zant, the abuse of the writ doctrine bars claims which could have been raised in an earlier habeas corpus petition except upon a showing of \u201ccause and prejudice.\u201d 111 S.Ct. at 1470. A further exception exists where \u201ca fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from a failure to entertain the claim.\u201d Id.8\nThe cause and prejudice analysis originated in the Court\u2019s procedural default jurisprudence. See Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). To show cause, a petitioner must establish that \u201csome external impediment\u201d prevented him from raising the claim in an earlier habeas corpus petition. McCleskey, 111 S.Ct. at 1472.9 Prejudice exists where \u201cerrors at trial ... worked to [petitioner\u2019s] actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.\u201d Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 494, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 2648, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986) (quoting United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 170, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1595, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982) (emphasis in original)).\nEven where cause and prejudice are absent, federal courts may entertain successive claims if necessary to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice. McCleskey, 111 S.Ct. at 1470. This situation may arise where \u201ca petitioner supplements a constitutional claim with a \u2018colorable showing of factual innocence.\u2019 \u201d See id. (quoting Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436, 454, 106 S.Ct. 2616, 2627, 91 L.Ed.2d 364 (1986)).\nThe abuse of the writ doctrine is founded upon \u201cconcerns flowing from the significant costs of federal habeas corpus review.\u201d Id. Ill S.Ct. at 1468. In particular, the doctrine is aimed at (1) promoting the finality of state court judgments; (2) preserving the capacity of the federal courts to resolve primary disputes; and (3) encouraging petitioners to bring their claims when the evidence is fresh. Id. at 1468-69. These concerns, although present in other contexts, are magnified in the case of successive habeas corpus petitions. Id. at 1469.\nB.\nThe question here is whether the district court properly dismissed Wise\u2019s habeas corpus petition for failure to exhaust state remedies before considering whether it constitutes an abuse of the writ. As we have noted, Wise\u2019s third habeas corpus petition, containing only his Miranda claim, was denied on the merits, and the Commonwealth properly raised abuse of the writ below.\nIn McCleskey the Supreme Court characterized the abuse of the writ question as a \u201cthreshold\" matter. Id. 111 S.Ct. at 1471.10 Moreover, in discussing the statutory framework underlying the abuse of *35the writ inquiry, the Court stated that \u201c[i]f the petitioner meets these conditions, the court must consider the subsequent petition as long as other habeas errors, such as nonexhaustion, ... are not present.\u201d Id. at 1466. Accordingly, we read McCleskey to suggest that, when properly raised, the abuse of the writ question should be considered before exhaustion.\nThis interpretation comports with the policies upon which the exhaustion requirement and the abuse of the writ doctrine are founded. Judicial economy is furthered by enabling courts to weed out abusive habeas corpus petitions without having to consider whether state remedies have been exhausted. Whereas the exhaustion inquiry often requires federal courts to interpret state procedural schemes, the abuse of the writ doctrine permits focus on whether there is cause and prejudice. As the Court noted in McCleskey, this \u201cstandard is an objective one, and can be applied in a manner that comports with the threshold nature of the abuse of the writ inquiry.\u201d 111 S.Ct. at 1471; see also Rosenberg, Kaddish for Federal Habeas Corpus, 59 Geo. Wash.L.Rev. 362, 372 &amp; n. 68 (1991) (discussing the application of the cause and prejudice standard in the procedural default context). An evidentiary hearing is not required if the district court determines that, as a matter of law, the petitioner cannot meet the cause and prejudice standard. McCleskey, 111 S.Ct. at 1470; see Woods v. Whitley, 933 F.2d 321, 323 (5th Cir.1991). Of course, even where cause and prejudice are absent, federal courts may entertain otherwise barred claims if necessary to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice. Id. Ill S.Ct. at 1470.\nAt the same time that judicial economy is furthered, comity and federalism are respected. Even where a successive habeas corpus petition contains unexhausted claims, the determination whether there is cause and prejudice will seldom require reaching the merits of these claims. As the Supreme Court has recognized in the procedural default context, \u201c[t]he question whether there is cause ... does not pose any occasion for applying the exhaustion doctrine when the federal habeas court can adjudicate the question of cause \u2014 a question of federal law \u2014 without deciding an independent and unexhausted constitutional claim on the merits.\u201d Murray, 477 U.S. at 488-89, 106 S.Ct. at 2646. Nevertheless, where the district court would be required to adjudicate an unexhausted constitutional claim in determining whether there is an abuse of the writ, the better practice would be to dismiss the successive habeas corpus petition on exhaustion grounds. See id.11\nAs we have explained, if it is determined that a successive habeas corpus petition does not abuse the writ, it is necessary to consider whether the petition suffers from other procedural defects, including lack of exhaustion, which may preclude federal ha-beas corpus review on the merits. See McCleskey, 111 S.Ct. at 1466.12\n*36III.\nBecause the district court dismissed Wise\u2019s habeas corpus petition for failure to exhaust state remedies without first considering the Commonwealth\u2019s abuse of the writ argument, we will vacate and remand. On remand the district court should determine whether Wise\u2019s petition constitutes an abuse of the writ under McCleskey v. Zant, unless applying the abuse of the writ doctrine first would require the district court to adjudicate an unexhausted constitutional claim.\n\n, Under Pennsylvania law, allocatur review \"is not a matter of right, but of sound judicial discretion, and an appeal will be allowed only when there are special and important reasons therefor.\" Pa.Rule App.Proc. 1114.\n\n\n. Wise\u2019s petition asserts that: (1) he was denied a full and fair hearing on his constitutional claims in state court; (2) the trial counsel\u2019s testimony for the Commonwealth at a second suppression hearing created a conflict of interest; (3) the prosecutor\u2019s reference to photographs of Wise in his closing argument was prejudicial; (4) evidence obtained pursuant to an unlawful arrest was wrongfully introduced; (5) his confession was obtained in violation of his Miranda rights; (6) evidence introduced was obtained pursuant to an unlawful search and seizure; and (7) the trial court erred in conducting a second limited suppression hearing based on newly discovered evidence. The full and fair hearing claim was presented for the first time. With the exception of the Miranda claim, which was raised in Wise\u2019s third habeas corpus petition, the remaining constitutional claims were presented for the first time in his pro se alloca-tur petition to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\n\n\n.The district court ruled that, with the exception of the Miranda claim, Wise\u2019s constitutional claims were not exhausted. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied principally on Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S. 346, 351, 109 S.Ct. 1056, 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 380 (1989), which held that raising a claim for the first time in an allocatur petition to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court does not exhaust the claim. According to the district court, although the Pennsylvania Superi- or Court rejected the constitutional claims here as ineffective assistance of counsel claims, \u201cthe underlying constitutional merits of these claims were never raised before [that] Court.\u201d The court dismissed Wise\u2019s Miranda claim as an abuse of the writ.\n\n\n. The Commonwealth asserted below that Wise\u2019s constitutional claims were exhausted on the ground that they were defaulted in state court, but does not address exhaustion in its appellate brief. At oral argument, however, the Commonwealth contended that we should address the abuse of the writ question before considering whether Wise\u2019s claims have been exhausted.\n\n\n. Section 2254(c) provides that \u201c[a]n applicant [for a writ of habeas corpus] shall not be deemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State ... if he has the right under the law of the State to raise, by any available procedure, the question presented.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(c).\n\n\n.For example, we have not required exhaustion where (1) \u201cthe state corrective process is so deficient as to render any effort to obtain relief futile,\u201d Gibson v. Scheidemantel, 805 F.2d 135, 138 (3d Cir.1986); (2) \u201cthe activities of the state authorities made the prisoner\u2019s resort to the state procedures in effect unavailable,\u201d Mayberry v. Petsock, 821 F.2d 179, 184 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 946, 108 S.Ct. 336, 98 L.Ed.2d 362 (1987); and (3) an \"inordinate delay in state procedures ... render[s] state process ineffective,\u201d Hankins, 941 F.2d at 250.\n\n\n. Rule 9(b) provides, in part, that\n[a] second or successive petition may be dismissed if the judge finds that it fails to allege new or different grounds for relief and the prior determination was on the merits or, if new and different grounds are alleged, the judge finds that the failure of the petitioner to assert those grounds in a prior petition constitutes an abuse of the writ.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, Rule 9(b).\n\n\n. The government bears the burden of pleading an abuse of the writ. To satisfy this burden, it must set forth the petitioner\u2019s prior writ history and identify the claims appearing for the first time in the successive habeas corpus petition. Upon such a showing, the burden shifts to the petitioner to disprove abuse by showing cause and prejudice. If the district court determines that, as a matter of law, the petitioner cannot meet this standard, it may dismiss the habeas corpus petition without an evidentiary hearing. Even where cause and prejudice are absent, however, the court may entertain a claim if necessary to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See McCleskey, 111 S.Ct. at 1470.\n\n\n. Examples of external impediments which have been found to constitute cause in the procedural default context include \"interference by officials,\u201d \"a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel,\" and \"ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d McCleskey, 111 S.Ct. at 1470.\n\n\n. The Court cited Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 287, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 1061, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948), which noted that the \"abuse of the writ is \u2018preliminary as well as collateral to a decision as to the sufficiency or merits of the allegation itself.\u2019\" McCleskey, 111 S.Ct. at 1471.\n\n\n. In Murray, a procedural default case, the Court rejected petitioner\u2019s argument that counsel\u2019s failure to raise an issue on direct appeal constituted cause. According to the Court, to constitute cause, the attorney error must amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. 477 U.S. at 488, 106 S.Ct. at 2645. Furthermore, \"a claim of ineffective assistance [must] be presented to the state courts as an independent claim before it may be used to establish cause for a procedural default.\u201d Id. at 488-89, 106 S.Ct. at 2646.\nIf a petitioner could raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim for the first time on federal habeas in order to show cause for a procedural default, the federal habeas court would find itself in the anomalous position of adjudicating an unexhausted claim for which state court review might still be available. The principle of comity that underlies the exhaustion doctrine would be ill served by a rule that allowed a federal district court \"to upset a state court conviction without an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional violation,\u201d ... and that holds true whether an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is asserted as cause for a procedural default or denominated as an independent ground for habeas relief.\nId. at 489, 106 S.Ct. at 2646 (citation omitted). Although the Court has yet to address the applicability of Murray in the abuse of the writ context, the proposition that federal courts should not adjudicate unexhausted claims in determining whether there is cause would seem to hold true.\n\n\n. United States ex. rel. Trantino v. Hatrack is not to the contrary. In Hatrack we held that the exhaustion requirement cannot be waived or *36conceded by state prosecutors. 563 F.2d at 96. Whether a claim is exhausted is a decision for the district court. For, as we observed in Ha-track, \"[e]xhaustion ... serves an interest not of state prosecutors but of state courts.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original).\nOne might argue that, by urging us to affirm the district court on abuse of the writ grounds alone, the Commonwealth has conceded exhaustion in contravention of Hatrack. However, our discussion here is limited to the question whether, in the case of a successive habeas corpus petition, abuse of the writ concerns should be addressed before exhaustion \u2014 not whether abuse of the writ concerns should be addressed instead of exhaustion.\n\n",
