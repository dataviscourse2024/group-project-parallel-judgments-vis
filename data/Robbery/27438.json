Sess.) (Senate\nBill 136). The People concede the enhancements should be stricken. We strike the prior\nprison term enhancements and affirm in all other respects.\n                              PROCEDURAL SUMMARY\n       On September 5, 2019,2 the Kern County District Attorney charged defendant in\nan amended information with unlawful driving or taking a motor vehicle (Veh. Code,\n\u00a7 10851, subd. (a); count 1) and misdemeanor possession of a known stolen motor\nvehicle (\u00a7 496d, subd. (a); count 3).3 As to both counts, the amended information alleged\ndefendant had suffered a prior conviction for possession of a known stolen vehicle\n(\u00a7 666.5, subd. (a)), committed the offense for the benefit of a criminal street gang\n(\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)), had suffered a prior felony \u201cstrike\u201d conviction within the\nmeaning of the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)\u2013(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)\u2013(d)), had\nsuffered a serious felony conviction (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)), and had served five prior prison\nterms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).\n       On September 11, the jury found defendant guilty on both counts but could not\ncome to a unanimous finding on the gang allegations. The trial court declared a mistrial\non the gang allegations. On the same date, in a bifurcated trial, the court struck the prior\n\n\n\n\n1      All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n2      All further dates refer to the year 2019 unless otherwise stated.\n3      Defendant was originally charged in count 2 with felony possession of a known\nstolen motor vehicle as a felony. Defendant moved to reduce count 2 to a misdemeanor.\nThe prosecutor agreed and moved to file an amended information. The trial court granted\nboth motions. The amended information contained only counts 1 and 3.\n\n                                              2\n\fserious felony allegation,4 but found all other prior conviction and prior prison term\nallegations to be true. Defendant\u2019s prior prison terms were served for a 2015 conviction\nfor second degree burglary (\u00a7 460, subd. (b)), a 2010 conviction for attempted first\ndegree burglary (\u00a7\u00a7 460, subd. (a), 664), a 2008 conviction for possession of a stolen\nmotor vehicle (\u00a7 496d, subd. (a)), a 2007 conviction for receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496,\nsubd. (a)), and a 2004 conviction for grand theft (\u00a7 487, subd. (a)).\n       On October 16, the court imposed a sentence of 13 years as follows: on count 1,\neight years (the upper term of four years doubled due to defendant\u2019s prior strike\nconviction), plus five one-year prior prison term enhancements; on count 3, one year in\ncounty jail to be served concurrently with count 1, stayed pursuant to section 654.\n       On October 21, defendant filed a notice of appeal.\n                                 FACTUAL SUMMARY\n       One evening in February, Wilmar Ortiz-Arias parked his blue 1995 Honda Accord\n(the car) on the street in front of his apartment complex. The following morning, he\nnoticed that the car was gone, and he reported it stolen to law enforcement.\n       On February 17, Bakersfield Police Officer Colton Blankenship was on patrol and\nnoticed the car. He ran a record check on the license plate and found that the car had\nbeen reported stolen. Blankenship and his partner attempted to conduct a vehicle stop by\nturning on the overhead lights and siren. Defendant, who was the driver of the car,\ncontinued to drive away from the officers at about 15 miles per hour. The car emitted an\nunusual sound and then it rolled to a stop. Defendant was then taken into custody.\n       Defendant told Blankenship, \u201c \u2018I didn\u2019t steal [the car]. My friend let me borrow\nit.\u2019 \u201d But defendant told Blankenship he knew the car was stolen. Blankenship noticed\n\n4      The gang allegations, if found true, would have elevated the driving a stolen\nvehicle offense to a serious felony. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (a), 1192.7, subd. (c)(1).) Because the\njury found the gang allegations not true, the trial court was required to strike the serious\nfelony allegation. (See ibid.)\n\n                                              3\n\ftattoos of the letters CB and BKS on defendant\u2019s body. CB and BKS were tattoos\nassociated with the Colonia Bakers gang. Blankenship asked defendant about the\nColonia Bakers and defendant responded, \u201c \u2018Yeah, I still run with them.\u2019 \u201d Defendant\nacknowledged to Blankenship that gang members use stolen cars to commit crimes but\nrefused to answer whether he intended to use the car to commit a crime for the benefit of\nthe gang.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Defendant argues his prior prison term enhancements must be stricken based on\nthe retroactive application of Senate Bill 136. The People agree, as do we.\n       Effective January 1, 2020, Senate Bill 136 amended section 667.5, subdivision (b)\nto limit application of prior prison term enhancements to only prior prison terms that\nwere served for sexually violent offenses as defined by Welfare and Institutions Code\nsection 6600, subdivision (b). (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b).) (Stats. 2019, ch. 590, \u00a7 1.) That\namendment applies retroactively to all cases not yet final on Senate Bill 136\u2019s effective\ndate. (People v. Lopez (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 337, 341\u2013342 (Lopez), citing In re Estrada\n(1965) 63 Cal.2d 740, 742.)\n       Here, the trial court imposed five one-year section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior\nprison term enhancements for terms served for convictions of burglary and theft offenses,\nnone of which is a sexually violent offense as defined in Welfare and Institutions Code\nsection 6600, subdivision (b). On January 1, 2020, defendant\u2019s case was not yet final.\nTherefore, as the parties agree, defendant is entitled to the ameliorative benefit of Senate\nBill 136\u2019s amendment to section 667.5, subdivision (b). We therefore strike defendant\u2019s\nprior prison term enhancements.\n       Where an appellate court strikes a portion of a sentence, remand for \u201c \u2018a full\nresentencing as to all counts is [generally] appropriate, so the trial court can exercise its\nsentencing discretion in light of the changed circumstances.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Buycks (2018)\n\n                                               4\n\f5 Cal.5th 857, 893.) However, where a trial court imposed the maximum possible\nsentence, remand for the court to consider alternative sentencing options is unnecessary.\n(Lopez, supra, 42 Cal.App.5th at p. 342.)\n       Here, the trial court imposed the maximum possible sentence and therefore\nremand is unnecessary. Accordingly, we strike the five prior prison term enhancements\nand direct the trial court to amend the abstract of judgment. (Lopez, supra, 42\nCal.App.5th at p. 342.)\n                                     DISPOSITION\n       All five prior prison term enhancements (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)) are stricken. The trial\ncourt is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment. The court shall forward a\ncopy of the amended abstract of judgment to the appropriate entities. As so modified, the\njudgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f",
