            "opinion_text": "\nMEMORANDUM**\nCalifornia state prisoner Ray A. Johnson appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus, challenging his sentence for first degree residential burglary and petty theft with a prior, in violation of CaLPenal Code \u00a7\u00a7 459 and 688/488. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm.\nJohnson contends that his 25 years to life plus ten years sentence under California\u2019s three strikes law, CaLPenal Code Ann. \u00a7 667 (West 1999), constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. This contention was recently foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Lockyer v. Andrade, \u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1175, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003) (holding that a state court\u2019s affirmance of two consecutive 25-years-to-life sentences for petty theft was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law), and Ewing v. California, \u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 1190, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (holding that petitioner\u2019s 25 years to life sentence under the California three strikes law did not violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment).\nTherefore, it was not an unreasonable application of Federal law for the California courts to affirm Johnson\u2019s sentence, and the district court properly denied his petition. See \u00a7 2254(d); Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 123 S.Ct. 357, 361, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002) (per curiam) (deciding that the federal habeas scheme \u201cauthorizes federal-court intervention only when a state-court decision is objectively unreasonable\u201d), reh\u2019g denied, \u2014 U.S. --, 123 S.Ct. 957, 154 L.Ed.2d 855 (2003).\nAFFIRMED.\n\n This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n\n",
