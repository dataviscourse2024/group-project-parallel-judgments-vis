Much aggrieved by his\n\nconvictions and resultant sentences, the appellant appeals from the judgment of\n\nthe trial court pursuant to Rule 3, Tenn. R. App. P.\n\n\n\n       On appeal, the appellant does not contest his convictions, but instead\n\nchallenges the appropriateness of the sentences imposed. He presents two\n\ndistinct issues for review by this Court: (a) whether the trial court erred in\n\nenhancing the appellant's sentence to the maximum sentence within the\n\nstatutory range and (b) whether the trial court erred in ordering the sentences of\n\nthe appellant to be served consecutively. As to both issues, we find no error.\n\n\n\n       At approximately 8:40 p.m. on February 11, 1993, the appellant\n\nproceeded through a red light at the intersection of Donelson Pike and Lakeland\n\nDrive in Nashville, resulting in a fatal collision. Eyewitnesses testified that the\n\nappellant, travelling in excess of the speed limit, failed to stop for the red light\n\nand continued into the intersection without decelerating. The appellant's vehicle\n\nstruck the side of a vehicle driven by Pamela Tidwell and also occupied by her\n\nseventeen year-old son, Blake Tidwell, and his fifteen year-old girlfriend, Keri\n\nScheib. The Tidwell vehicle was struck with sufficient momentum to propel it\n\ninto a third vehicle before coming to rest against a telephone pole. As a result of\n\nthe crash, Ms. Tidwell, her son, and his girlfriend sustained fatal injuries. After\n\nstriking the Tidwell vehicle, the appellant's vehicle spun into two additional\n\nvehicles before coming to a rest. The appellant received only minor injuries as a\n\nresult of the collision.\n\n\n1\nThe offense of vehicular homicide by intoxication is codified at Tenn. Code\nAnn. \u00a739-13-213(a)(2).\n\n                                           2\n\f                                  DISCUSSION\n\n      In examining the propriety of a sentence rendered against a criminal\n\ndefendant, this court must conduct a de novo review based on the record. Tenn.\n\nCode Ann. \u00a7 40-35-401(d). However, this court must presume that the\n\ndeterminations made by the trial court are correct. Id. Therefore, if our review\n\nreveals that the trial court imposed a lawful sentence pursuant to the Tennessee\n\nCriminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989 after having given proper consideration\n\nand weight to the relevant sentencing factors under the Act and the sentence is\n\nbased on findings of fact which are adequately supported by the record, then we\n\nmay not disturb the sentence imposed by the trial court. State v. Fletcher, 805\n\nS.W.2d 785, 789 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991). Furthermore, the appellant has the\n\nburden of establishing that the sentence rendered by the trial court was\n\nerroneous. Sentencing Commission Comments to Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-\n\n401(d); State v. Ashby, 823 S.W.2d 166, 169 (Tenn. 1991); State v. Anderson,\n\n880 S.W.2d 720, 727 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994).\n\n\n\n      Concerning what constitutes an appropriate punishment, the Sentencing\n\nReform Act provides that the sentence imposed shall be one that is \"justly\n\ndeserved in relation to the seriousness of the offense.\" Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-\n\n35-102(2). The Act also mandates that the sentence be the least severe\n\nmeasure necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act and that inequalities\n\nshould be avoided. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-103(3),(4); see Ashby, 823 S.W.2d\n\nat 168.\n\n\n\n      The portion of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1989 codified at Tenn. Code\n\nAnn. \u00a7 40-35-210 established several specific procedures to be followed in the\n\nsentencing process. This section mandates the trial court's consideration of the\n\nfollowing: (1) The evidence, if any, received at the trial and the sentencing\n\nhearing; (2) the presentence report; (3) the principles of sentencing and\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\farguments as to sentencing alternatives; (4) the nature and characteristics of the\n\ncriminal conduct involved; (5) evidence and information offered by the parties on\n\nthe enhancement and mitigating factors in \u00a7\u00a7 40-35-113 and 40-35-114; and (6)\n\nany statement the defendant wishes to make in his own behalf about\n\nsentencing. See Manning v. State, 883 S.W.2d 635, 638 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1994).\n\n\n\n         Establishing an appropriate sentence is a two-step process. Initially, the\n\ntrial court must determine the appropriate range of punishment for the offense.\n\nThen the court must fix a particular sentence within the appropriate range. The\n\npresumptive sentence shall be the minimum sentence in the range if no\n\nenhancement or mitigating factors exist. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-210(c). If\n\nenhancement factors exist but there are no mitigating factors, which is the\n\nsituation in the present case, then the trial court may set the sentence above the\n\nminimum in that range but still within the range. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-\n\n210(d).\n\n\n\n         Vehicular homicide by intoxication is a Class C felony, punishable by a\n\nsentence \"not less than three (3) nor more than six (6) years.\" Tenn. Code Ann.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 39-l3-2l3(b), 40-35-112(a)(3). In setting the appellant's sentence at the\n\nmaximum sentence, the trial court found three enhancement factors were\n\napplicable: (a) the appellant has a previous history of criminal behavior in\n\naddition to those necessary to establish the appropriate range, Tenn. Code Ann.\n\n\u00a7 40-35-ll4(l); (b) the offense involved more than one victim, Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\n\n40-35-ll4(3); and (c) the appellant had no hesitation about committing a crime\n\nwhen the risk to human life was high. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-114 (10). The\n\nappellant challenges the trial court's findings concerning each of those factors.\n\n\n\n         The first enhancement factor applied by the trial court was that the\n\nappellant \"has a previous history of criminal convictions or criminal behavior in\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\faddition to those necessary to establish the appropriate range.\" Tenn. Code\n\nAnn. \u00a7 40-35-114(1). The record reveals that the appellant began drinking when\n\nhe was approximately fourteen years old. By age sixteen, he was getting drunk\n\nthree to four times per week. From the time of his mother's death until the night\n\nof the offense, the appellant abused alcohol almost every night. The appellant\n\nhimself testified that he had operated a motor vehicle while intoxicated on\n\nseveral occasions prior to the date of the fatal collision, and that he was arrested\n\nfor such an offense eight days prior to the collision. He further admitted that he\n\nhad experimented with marijuana, cocaine, and LSD beginning at the age of\n\nfifteen. The appellant also stated that he knew that such conduct was illegal at\n\nthe time each offense transpired.\n\n\n\n       In his brief, the appellant states that the trial court's finding of this factor\n\nbased on his history of alcohol and drug abuse was \"far fetched.\" We cannot\n\nagree. Instead, we believe that if anything is far fetched, it is for one to argue,\n\nafter even a cursory review of the law of this State and the record in this case,\n\nthat the appellant's conduct did not constitute criminal behavior. In State v.\n\nMassey, 757 S.W.2d 350, 352 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1988), this Court made it clear\n\nthat a trial court, in applying this enhancement factor, may consider not only prior\n\nconvictions, but also all prior criminal behavior, regardless of whether it resulted\n\nin legal entanglements. See State v. Little, 854 S.W.2d 643, 652 (Tenn. Crim.\n\nApp. 1992)(trial court properly applied the enhancement factor where the record\n\ncontained evidence that the defendant had been involved in a number of prior\n\ndrug transactions). Moreover, it is of no consequence that the appellant was a\n\nminor during the majority of his prior criminal behavior. See State v. Adams, 864\n\nS.W.2d 31, 34 (Tenn. 1993)(where our Supreme Court noted that a previous\n\nhistory of criminal conduct by a defendant while still a juvenile \"may be\n\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\ftaken into account in fashioning a proper sentence.\"). The record is replete with\n\nevidence justifying application of this factor.\n\n\n\n       Another enhancement factor applied by the trial court is that the offense\n\ninvolved more than one victim. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-114(3). Relying on\n\nState v. Lambert, 741 S.W.2d 127, 134 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1987), the appellant\n\ncontends that this factor may not be used because he was convicted on a\n\nseparate count for each victim. Although we acknowledge the validity of\n\nLambert, it is distinguishable from the present case and, thus, not controlling.\n\n\n\n       In the recent case of State v. Raines, 882 S.W.2d 376, 384\n\n(Tenn.Crim.App. l994), this Court defined \"the word 'victim,' as used in Tenn.\n\nCode Ann. \u00a7 40-35-114(3), [as] a person or entity that is injured, killed, had\n\nproperty stolen, or had property destroyed by the perpetrator of the crime.\"\n\n(footnote omitted). Several additional cases, although not specifically\n\ndelineating a definition of a victim, are relevant to a resolution of this issue. E.g.,\n\nState v. Norris, 874 S.W.2d 590, 601 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993)(factor applied\n\nwhere defendant was convicted on separate counts of aggravated assault\n\nconcerning injuries inflicted upon passengers in the front seat of a vehicle, but\n\ntwo passengers in the rear seat of the vehicle were also injured); State v.\n\nWilliamson, No. 03C01-9210-CR-00371, 1993 WL 335433, at *1 (Tenn. Crim.\n\nApp. Sept. 1, 1993)(factor applied in robbery conviction where, in the process of\n\nstealing a purse, the defendant knocked the elderly lady carrying the purse into a\n\nlady walking with her); Register v. State, No. 01C01-9210-CC-00329, 1993 WL\n\n311529, at *4 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug. 12, 1993)(factor applied to an aggravated\n\nburglary conviction where the defendant forced a woman to surrender her\n\nmoney and remove her panties while in the presence of her two-year-old son).\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f       The record reflects that the appellant's running of the red light resulted in\n\na five car accident.2 One of the motorists involved in the accident testified at the\n\nsentencing hearing concerning the nature and extent of the damage to her\n\nautomobile, as well as to an injury to her knee. Clearly, under Raines, the\n\nowners of the three other vehicles, as well as the driver whose knee was injured,\n\ncould properly be considered victims.\n\n\n\n       The third enhancement factor employed by the trial court was that the\n\ndefendant had no hesitation about committing a crime when the risk to human\n\nlife was high. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-114(10). Prior to the Sentencing Reform\n\nAct of 1989, this Court found that the factor was properly applied in sentencing a\n\ndefendant who recklessly drove through streets crowded with motorists and\n\npedestrians prior to killing the particular victims for whose death he was charged.\n\nState v. Lambert, 741 S.W.2d at 134. Recently, our Supreme Court, in\n\ndiscussing the applicability of Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-114(10), cited\n\nLambert with approval. State v. Jones, 883 S.W.2d 597, 603 (Tenn. 1994).\n\n\n\n       In Jones, our Supreme Court, in discussing the proper usage of the\n\nenhancement factor, explained: \"as a practical matter, hesitation or lack of\n\nhesitation does not submit readily to proof because of its subjective nature. The\n\nmore logical interpretation of this enhancement factor places the emphasis on\n\n'risk to human life was high.'\" 883 S.W.2d at 602. In an unpublished opinion,\n\nState v. Bingham, No. 03C01-9404-CR-00127, 1995 WL 60003, at *2 (Tenn.\n\nCrim. App. Feb. 14, 1995), this Court relied on Jones in finding:\n\n       Little, if any, emphasis is to be placed on whether the defendant\n       \"hesitated\" before committing the crime. [Jones, 883 S.W.2d at\n       602.] . . . [W]here a high risk to human life is established with facts\n       separate from those necessary to establish an element of the\n       offense, the enhancement factor is not an essential element of the\n       offense and may be applied if supported by the facts. In a\n       vehicular homicide by recklessness case, if the proof that\n       establishes a \"high risk to human life\" can be separated from the\n       proof necessary to establish that the defendant's conduct \"created\n\n2\nAccording to an investigating officer, excluding the vehicles of the appellant and\nMs. Tidwell, three other vehicles were damaged in the crash.\n\n                                          7\n\f       a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to a person,\" then\n       enhancement factor (10) is not an essential element of the offense.\n       Therefore, enhancement factor (10) may be applied where the\n       defendant creates a high risk to the life of a person other than the\n       [deceased] victim, because the facts establishing the enhancement\n       factor would be separate from the facts necessary to establish a\n       high risk of death to a person.\n\nId. (citations omitted)(emphasis in original).\n\n\n\n       Turning to the facts of this case, which are quite similar to the facts in\n\nLambert, the trial court found that the proof adduced at trial was more than\n\nample to justify application of enhancement factor (10). We agree. The record\n\nsupports the finding that the appellant consumed alcohol intermittently\n\nthroughout most of the day on the date of the offense. Less than an hour before\n\nthe fatal collision, the appellant, while leaving a bowling alley where he was\n\ninvolved in an altercation, stated, \"I'm loaded and I ain't through yet.\" He then\n\nproceeded to drive his vehicle out of the parking lot of the bowling alley at a\n\ndangerously high rate of speed which was estimated to be forty miles per hour\n\nby one witness. About ten minutes later and approximately seven miles from the\n\nbowling alley, the fatal accident occurred when the appellant ran a red light and\n\nbegan a chain of collisions. Witnesses testified that the appellant was travelling\n\nfar in excess of the speed limit and did not brake or otherwise appear to\n\ndecelerate as he entered the intersection. Moreover, the appellant admitted that\n\nhe was intoxicated that evening. The severity of the risk to human life posed by\n\nthe appellant's conduct is demonstrated by the fact that the lives of three people\n\nwere extinguished3 and another person was injured; the widespread nature of\n\nthe risk is demonstrated by the fact that five automobiles, including the\n\nappellant's, sustained damage.\n\n\n\n\n3\n We do not utilize the fact that three deaths occurred as any sort of justification\nfor applying enhancement factor (10), but instead reference the deaths to\nillustrate the extreme force with which the appellant's car entered the\nintersection, as well as the resultant dangers for all motorists who happened to\nbe in and around the intersection.\n\n                                          8\n\f       In short, the appellant drove his vehicle through a red light into a crowded\n\nintersection at an excessive rate of speed. The risks inherent in such conduct\n\nwere compounded by his diminished driving capacity due to his intoxication.\n\nClearly, the appellant's conduct posed a grave risk to the lives of all of the\n\nmotorists who were involved in the crash, as well as others who were in the\n\nvicinity. Although the consequences which befell Ms. Tidwell, her son, and his\n\ngirlfriend cannot be properly employed to support application of the\n\nenhancement factor, the extreme risks to the lives of the other motorists are\n\nsufficient to justify the trial court's finding.\n\n\n\n       We find no error in the trial court's application of the three enhancement\n\nfactors or in the sentences imposed. The issue is without merit.\n\n\n\n       In his second issue on appeal, the appellant contends that the trial court\n\nerred by finding that he is a \"dangerous offender\" and thus imposing consecutive\n\nsentencing. Our review of the record indicates that the ruling of the trial court\n\nwas proper.\n\n\n\n       Subsection (a) of Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-115 provides that \"[i]f a\n\ndefendant is convicted of more than one (1) criminal offense, the court shall\n\norder sentences to run consecutively or concurrently as provided by the criteria\n\nin this section.\" Subsection (b) delineates seven categories of multiple offenders\n\nwho can be ordered to serve consecutive sentences, one of which is the\n\n\"dangerous offender.\" Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-115(b)(4). In State v. Woods,\n\n8l4 S.W.2d 378, 380 (Tenn.Crim.App. l99l), this Court explained the standard for\n\nimposing consecutive sentencing on grounds that a defendant is a dangerous\n\noffender, holding that the record must establish:\n\n       (a) the defendant's behavior indicates \"little or no regard for human\n       life,\" and he did not hesitate \"about committing a crime in which the\n       risk to human life is high,\" Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a740-35-115(b)(4) . . .;\n\n       (b) the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense\n       are aggravated, Gray v. State, 538 S.W.2d at 393;\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       (c) confinement for an extended period of time is necessary to\n       protect society from the defendant's unwillingness to \"lead a\n       productive life and [his] resort to criminal activity in furtherance of\n       [his] anti-societal lifestyle,\" Gray v. State, 538 S.W.2d at 393; and\n\n       (d) the aggregate length of the sentences, if consecutive\n       sentencing is ordered, reasonably relates to the offenses of which\n       the defendant stands convicted. State v. Taylor, 739 S.W.2d [227,\n       230 (Tenn. 1987)].\n\nsee also State v. Norris, 874 S.W.2d 590, 601 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993).\n\n\n\n       Concerning the first Woods factor, the trial court found that shortly before\n\nthe fatal collision, the appellant, referring to his alcohol consumption, made a\n\nstatement to the effect that \"he was loaded and was not through yet.\" The trial\n\ncourt found that the appellant was driving his vehicle at a very high speed, as\n\nevidenced by the widespread damage to the automobiles in this case. The court\n\nalso relied on the fact that the appellant had been arrested for driving while\n\nintoxicated the week prior to this offense, and was out on bond for that arrest\n\nwhen this crime was committed. Moreover, we believe that the appellant's\n\nadmission that he was intoxicated that evening, his failing to stop for a red light,\n\nand the number of individuals involved in and endangered by the crash, are\n\nrelevant.\n\n\n\n       The court found that the circumstances surrounding the offense were\n\naggravated in that the appellant was out on bond for a driving while intoxicated\n\narrest. The judge determined that at the time of the offense the appellant's state\n\nof intoxication was advanced. Finally, the court emphasized that the conduct of\n\nthe appellant resulted in the termination of three innocent lives. The court\n\nconcluded by stating that it could hardly imagine circumstances which would be\n\nmore aggravating than those of this case.\n\n\n\n       With regard to the third Woods' factor, the trial court found that the\n\nappellant has shown no remorse concerning his conduct or the deaths of three\n\ninnocent people. After the accident, the appellant denied being involved in the\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f       collision, and later cursed the deceased victims. The court further determined\n\n       that the appellant has shown no potential for rehabilitation, specifically noting\n\n       that the appellant had not availed himself of the extensive alcohol-abuse\n\n       treatment program in the Metro jail.4\n\n\n\n              The final criterion or factor, that the aggregate length of the sentences\n\n       reasonably relate to the offenses of the appellant, was not specifically addressed\n\n       by the trial court in the record. Under certain circumstances, such as where the\n\n       evidence suggests some doubt as to what the outcome of the ruling would be or\n\n       where this omission was but one of a larger body of errors, justice would dictate\n\n       a remand to the trial court for further findings. Here, however, it is manifest to\n\n       this Court that the aggregate length of the sentences, eighteen years,5 is\n\n       reasonably related to the appellant's egregious conduct which resulted in the\n\n       senseless slaying of three people, including two teenagers.\n\n\n\n\n              In the recent case of State v. Timothy Michael Wilkerson, No. 02S01-\n\n       9406-CC-00033 (Tenn., Jackson, Aug. 21, 1995) (for publication), our Supreme\n\n\n\n       4\n        Our review of the record reveals that a Department of Correction employee\n       testified at the sentencing hearing to the effect that the appellant failed to\ncomplete an alcohol treatment program that he was ordered to complete as a\ncondition of his release on bond concerning his D.U.I. arrest which occurred          eight\ndays prior to the offenses involved sub judice. The employee stated that the director\nof the program requested the appellant to leave the program            because the\nappellant was not sincerely interested in being rehabilitated or       dealing with his\nalcohol problem. However, the appellant testified at the               sentencing hearing\nthat he was enrolled in a drug and alcohol treatment             program at the prison.\n\n       In addition to the grounds stated by the trial court, careful review of the record\n       discloses that the appellant has a history of displaying an unproductive and anti-\n       societal lifestyle. The appellant testified that he began drinking alcohol at age\n       fourteen or fifteen, and that by age fifteen he began experimenting with\n       marijuana, cocaine, and LSD. According to his testimony, by age sixteen he was\n       getting drunk three to four times per week. At the time of the offense, the\n       appellant was drinking heavily almost every day. He testified that since age\n       sixteen, he had driven on numerous occasions while under the influence of\n       alcohol. Moreover, prior to the offense, the appellant dropped out of high school\n       and moved in with a dancer who financially supported him.\n       5\n        As a Range I, Standard Offender, the appellant will be eligible for parole in\n       approximately five and one-half years.\n\n                                                11\n\fCourt approved this Court's Woods opinion \"only to the extent it applied the\n\nprinciples set forth in (the Wilkerson) opinion.\" Slip Opinion at 12. Although our\n\nexamination of Wilkerson and Woods reveals nothing of significance in Woods\n\nthat actually conflicts with Wilkerson, we recognize that Wilkerson provides the\n\nstandards for Tennessee courts to follow in assessing the need for consecutive\n\nsentencing.\n\n\n\n       In Wilkerson, our Supreme Court set forth two specific findings which the\n\ncourt must make in imposing consecutive sentences, in addition to the general\n\nprinciples of sentencing. The court must find that (l) \"an extended sentence is\n\nnecessary to protect the public against further criminal conduct by the\n\ndefendant,\" and (2) that \"the consecutive sentences must reasonably relate to\n\nthe severity of the offenses committed.\" Slip Opinion at l4.\n\n\n\n       Both of these criteria are met in this case. It is manifest that an extended\n\nperiod of incarceration is necessary to protect the public from this drunken killer\n\nand the consecutive sentences which aggregate eighteen years as a Range I\n\nstandard offender reasonably relate to the severity of the offenses - the\n\nsenseless killing of three innocent victims.\n\n\n\n       After a thorough review of the trial court's findings, as well as our\n\nindependent examination of the record, we cannot say the appellant has met his\n\nburden of showing that the trial court erred in ordering his sentences to be\n\nserved consecutively.\n\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\f     Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                               ___________________________________\n                               JERRY SCOTT, PRESIDING JUDGE\n\n\nCONCUR:\n\n\n\n______________________________\nJOSEPH M.
