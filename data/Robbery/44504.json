PUTMAN,\n                                    APPELLEE JUDGE\n\n\n                                                  AFFIRMED\n\n\n                                    MIKE MURPHY, Judge\n\n         On November 13, 2019, a Baxter County jury found the appellant, Joshua Miller,\n\n   guilty of the following: obstructing governmental operations, theft of property,\n\n   commercial burglary, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of Suboxone, possession\n\n   of methamphetamine, and possession of marijuana. These charges were brought in three\n\n   separate cases: 03CR-18-155, 03CR-19-129, and 03CR-19-127. At Miller\u2019s insistence, they\n\n   were all tried together in a two-day jury trial. The records were separated for appeal. We\n\n   affirmed the underlying conviction of case number 03CR-18-155 in Miller v. State, 2021 Ark.\n\n   App. 414. This appeal concerns the underlying case number 03CR-19-127 wherein Miller\n\n   was charged with the offenses of commercial burglary, theft of property, and obstructing\n\fgovernmental operations.1 On appeal, Miller argues that substantial evidence did not\n\nsupport his convictions of commercial burglary and obstructing governmental operations.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n       Pertinent to this appeal, the jury heard testimony from Christopher Constantine, a\n\nfinancial-aid officer in the admissions office at Arkansas State University-Mountain Home.\n\nHe explained that he has a private office with a door that is not open to the public without\n\ninvitation. He testified that on March 27, 2019, he left for lunch, turned his office lights off,\n\nand left his door only slightly ajar. He explained that when he came back, he noticed some\n\nfinancial-aid files were missing from his desk. These files contained the personal information\n\nnecessary to process financial-aid applications. Constantine testified that he and others in\n\nthe office spent several hours trying to locate the files. Eventually, he notified campus police.\n\n       Jessica Wood, an assistant in the admissions office, testified that she identified Miller\n\nfrom the surveillance video recording of the office. She recalled that Miller came into the\n\nadmissions building wanting to apply for college and leave with an admissions letter that day.\n\nWood stated that Miller would have had no reason to go into Constantine\u2019s office. She\n\ntestified that Miller had something in his arm when he left that he did not have when he\n\narrived.\n\n       Testimony established that after Miller had been identified as a suspect, Officers\n\nMatthew Garcia and George Eddings with the Baxter County Sheriff\u2019s Office searched\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           The theft-of-property charge was nolle prossed.\n\n\n                                                   2\n\fMiller\u2019s residence. Upon arriving, Garcia noticed that the vehicle in the driveway was the\n\nsame vehicle that Miller got into on the surveillance video. In the vehicle, Garcia found a\n\nfolder with the name of one of the missing files, and upon a search of the home, he found\n\nthe four missing files. Miller was subsequently arrested and taken to the sheriff\u2019s office for\n\nquestioning. During questioning, Miller told Garcia that he was going back to prison soon\n\nbut that if he could get a letter stating that he was going to be a student at ASU, his sentence\n\nwould be shortened. Miller\u2019s recorded statement was admitted without objection at trial and\n\nplayed for the jury.\n\n       At the close of the State\u2019s case, Miller moved for a directed verdict. Miller\u2019s directed-\n\nverdict motions were denied. When the defense rested, Miller renewed his directed-verdict\n\nmotions, which again were denied.\n\n       Motions for directed verdict are treated as challenges to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence. Brown v. State, 2020 Ark. App. 198, at 3\u20134, 595 S.W.3d 456, 459. When reviewing\n\nthe denial of a directed-verdict motion, the appellate court will look at the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the State, considering only the evidence that supports the judgment\n\nor verdict and will affirm if there is substantial evidence to support the verdict. Id. Substantial\n\nevidence is evidence of sufficient force and character that it will, with reasonable certainty,\n\ncompel a conclusion without resorting to speculation or conjecture. Id. Evidence is sufficient\n\nto support a verdict if it is forceful enough to compel a conclusion one way or the other. Id.\n\n       A person commits commercial burglary if he or she enters or remains unlawfully in a\n\ncommercial occupiable structure of another person with the purpose of committing in the\n\n\n                                                3\n\fcommercial occupiable structure any offense punishable by imprisonment. Ark. Code Ann.\n\n\u00a7 5-39-201(b)(1) (Repl. 2013). \u201cEnter or remain unlawfully\u201d means to enter or remain in or\n\nupon premises when not licensed or privileged to enter or remain in or upon the premises.\n\nArk. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-39-101(4)(A) (Supp. 2021).\n\n       Miller argues that the trial court erred by denying his directed-verdict motion\n\nconcerning the commercial-burglary charge because the State failed to meet its burden as to\n\nthe element of \u201center or remain unlawfully.\u201d However, Constantine testified that he has a\n\nprivate office, and the public at large is not allowed to enter it without invitation.\n\nConstantine did not invite Miller in. Constantine was not present when the files were taken\n\nfrom his office. The lights were off, and the door was only slightly open. Accordingly, Miller\n\nwas not authorized to go into Constantine\u2019s office. See Sims v. State, 272 Ark. 308, 613\n\nS.W.2d 820 (1981) (defendant did not have privilege or license to enter a closed door which\n\nhad \u201cemployees only\u201d sign on it); LeFlore v. State, 17 Ark. App. 117, 704 S.W.2d 641 (1986)\n\n(a defendant\u2019s license or privilege to go into one section of the courthouse for the purpose\n\nof retrieving his tools did not authorize him to go into other unauthorized areas for the\n\npurpose of committing theft).\n\n       Miller argues that the public is free to enter the university\u2019s financial-aid office. To\n\nsupport his argument, he directs us to Todd v. State, 2016 Ark. App. 280, 494 S.W.3d 444,\n\nwherein appellant was charged with commercial burglary after he had entered a Walmart\n\nstore and shoplifted. Our court reversed, holding that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport appellant\u2019s conviction for commercial burglary because Walmart is open to the\n\n\n                                              4\n\fpublic, appellant\u2019s purpose in entering the store was not determinative, and there was no\n\nevidence that appellant had been banned from the premises. Id.\n\n       Here, Constantine\u2019s office was a distinct, separate area from the general financial-aid\n\noffice, and it was not open to the public. Miller was not licensed or privileged to enter\n\nConstantine\u2019s office. Further, Miller\u2019s legitimate business in the financial-aid office was\n\nconcluded before he entered Constantine\u2019s private office. Given this, substantial evidence\n\nestablished that Miller entered a private office without permission and did so with the\n\npurpose of committing a crime.\n\n       Next, Miller challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his obstruction-of-\n\ngovernmental-operations convictions. A person commits the offense of obstructing\n\ngovernmental operations if the person knowingly obstructs, impairs, or hinders the\n\nperformance of any governmental function. Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-54-102(a)(1) (Repl. 2016).\n\n\u201cGovernmental function\u201d means any activity that a public servant is legally authorized to\n\nundertake on behalf of any governmental unit he serves. Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-54-101(6)\n\n(Supp. 2021).\n\n       Miller contends that Constantine was not working in the capacity of a \u201cpublic\n\nservant,\u201d and even if he were, he was not working on behalf of a \u201cgovernmental unit.\u201d\n\nAlternatively, he argues that there was no impairment of the function of the financial-aid\n\noffice due to his actions because there was no evidence presented by the State that anyone\n\nwas adversely affected by the theft of the files.\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f       At trial, Miller\u2019s directed-verdict motions focused on lack of proof that his acts\n\nhindered operation of the financial-aid office. His argument that the element of\n\n\u201cgovernmental function\u201d was not met is not preserved because he did not raise the issue\n\nbelow, and the circuit court was never given an opportunity to rule on this issue. See Porchay\n\nv. State, 2021 Ark. App. 64, 616 S.W.3d 699.\n\n       Nor do we agree with the preserved portion of Miller\u2019s argument that his actions did\n\nnot impair the function of the office. The testimony at trial established that Constantine,\n\nalong with other employees, spent hours searching for the missing financial-aid files before\n\nit was discovered that Miller had taken them. The missing files contained the private\n\ninformation of four students for whom Constantine was working to process financial aid.\n\nInstead of doing that work as he intended, Constantine and others spent time searching and\n\neventually had to report the issue to the campus police when the files could not be located.\n\nConstantine could not complete processing the files until they were recovered days later.\n\nThis is substantial evidence to support Miller\u2019s convictions for obstructing governmental\n\noperations.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n       VAUGHT and BROWN, JJ., agree.\n\n       Potts Law Office, by: Gary W.
