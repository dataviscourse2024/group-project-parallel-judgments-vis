            "opinion_text": "\nOPINION\nCONNOLLY, Judge.\nIn this pretrial appeal, the state argues that the district court erred by finding a lack of nexus between the alleged criminal activity and respondent\u2019s residence, where the signed search warrant included evidence of drug dealing and evidence that respondent possessed and used a gun in committing a crime a few days before the search was executed. Because it was common sense and reasonable to infer that respondent would keep the gun at his residence, we reverse and remand.\nFACTS\nOn May 10, 2012, law enforcement requested a search warrant to search a residential address in St. Paul (the address). The affidavit in support of the search warrant application stated that respondent La-Dream Hampton Yarbrough was allegedly involved in a terroristic-threats situation on May 7, 2012. According to the affidavit, respondent (1) accused the victim of stealing a \u201clarge amount of crack cocaine from him,\u201d (2) punched the victim, (3) brandished a .22 caliber handgun, and (4) fled in a maroon Chevrolet Caprice. The affidavit also alleged that the Caprice was driven by a black female and that the vehicle was registered to the address. The affidavit further alleged that \u201c[ujsing the police data bases,\u201d law enforcement found documentation that respondent lives at the address. Finally, the affidavit alleged that (1) respondent had been arrested in February 2012, for possession of a controlled substance with intent; (2) crack cocaine and marijuana were recovered in the arrest; and (3) a confidential reliable *491informant (CRI) \u201cknew [respondent] to deal in crack cocaine.\u201d\nThe search warrant was signed and, upon execution of the search warrant, law enforcement found drugs, a .22 caliber handgun, money, and other incriminating evidence. Respondent was subsequently charged with first- and fifth-degree possession of a controlled substance, and receiving stolen property.\nRespondent moved to suppress the evidence on the basis that no nexus existed between the place to be searched and the alleged criminal activity. The district court found that \u201ceven when the facts in this affidavit are considered as a whole, there is still no nexus between [respondent\u2019s] alleged drug activities, a gun, and the apartment searched.\u201d Thus, the court concluded that \u201cthe warrant was not supported by probable cause and that evidence found as a result of the search warrant of [the address] is suppressed.\u201d This appeal followed.\nISSUE\nDid the district court err by granting respondent\u2019s motion to suppress because the search warrant lacked a nexus between the alleged criminal activity and the place to be searched?\nANALYSIS\nThe state is permitted to appeal a district court\u2019s pretrial order under Minn. R.Crim. P. 28.04, subd. 1(1). If the state appeals a pretrial suppression order, it \u201cmust clearly and unequivocally show both that the [district] court\u2019s order will have a critical impact on the state\u2019s ability to prosecute the defendant successfully and that the order constituted error.\u201d State v. Scott, 584 N.W.2d 412, 416 (Minn.1998) (quotations omitted). It is undisputed that the district court\u2019s order here will have a critical impact on the state\u2019s ability to prosecute respondent.\nNo search warrant may be issued except upon probable cause. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 626.08 (2010); see U.S. Const, amend. IV; Minn. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10. The warrant-issuing judge must determine, based on the totality of the circumstances set forth in an affidavit, whether there is a \u201cfair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983); State v. Harris, 589 N.W.2d 782, 788 (Minn.1999). The affidavit must provide enough details for the issuing judge to independently discern whether probable 'cause exists. State v. Souto, 578 N.W.2d 744, 749 (Minn.1998).\nWhen reviewing whether a search warrant is supported by probable cause, this court affords great deference to the issuing judge. Harris, 589 N.W.2d at 787. The reviewing court recognizes that the issuing judge may \u201cdraw common-sense and reasonable inferences from the facts and circumstances set forth in an affidavit.\u201d State v. Brennan, 674 N.W.2d 200, 204 (Minn.App.2004) (quotation omitted), review denied (Minn. Apr. 20, 2004). An. appellate court inquiry is limited to whether, viewing the- affidavit as a whole, State v. McCloskey, 453 N.W.2d 700, 703 (Minn.1990), the issuing judge \u201chad a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.\u201d Harris, 589 N.W.2d at 788 (quotations omitted).\n The state challenges the district court\u2019s determination that the affidavit submitted by the officers failed to establish a nexus between respondent\u2019s drug activities, a gun, and the address to be searched. To be valid, a warrant must establish \u201ca direct connection, or nexus, between the alleged crime and the particular place to *492be searched....\u201d Souto, 578 N.W.2d at 747. The factors the issuing judge must consider in determining whether such a nexus exists include the nature of the crime, \u201cthe nature of the items sought, the extent of the suspect\u2019s opportunity for concealment, and the normal inferences as to where the suspect would normally keep the items.\u201d Harris, 589 N.W.2d at 788. \u201c[information linking the crime to the place to be searched and the freshness of the information\u201d are also relevant. Souto, 578 N.W.2d at 747 (citing 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.7(d), at 372 (3d ed.1996)). But an issuing judge may not base a finding of probable cause on an investigator\u2019s \u201cwholly eonclusory statement.\u201d Gates, 462 U.S. at 239, 103 S.Ct. at 2332-33.\nHere, the search-warrant affidavit contained the following information: (1) respondent was allegedly involved in a ter-roristic-threats situation in which he brandished a .22 caliber handgun, accused the victim of stealing a \u201clarge\u201d amount of cocaine from him, and fled in a maroon Chevrolet Caprice driven by a black female; (2) the registered owner of the Caprice resides at the address, which is also the same address at which respondent resides according to \u201cpolice data bases\u201d; (3) respondent had been arrested three months prior for possession of a controlled substance with intent, and crack cocaine and marijuana were recovered at the time of the arrest; and (4) a \u201crecent[ ]\u201d statement from a CRI that \u201che/she knew [respondent] to deal in crack cocaine\u201d and had seen respondent \u201cwith a handgun on his person in the past.\u201d\nThe state argues that the evidence in the search-warrant affidavit establishes respondent\u2019s status as a drug dealer, demonstrates that he possessed a .22 caliber handgun, and links him to the address referenced in the search-warrant affidavit. The state also contends that, because it was established that respondent is a drug dealer and that he possessed a gun, it was reasonable to infer that respondent would keep the gun and contraband at his residence. Thus, the state argues that the district court erred by concluding that the search-warrant affidavit failed to establish a sufficient nexus between the alleged criminal activity and the place to be searched.\nIn deciding respondent\u2019s motion to suppress, the district court focused largely on the alleged drug activities to determine that the search-warrant affidavit lacked probable cause because there was an insufficient nexus between respondent\u2019s alleged drug activities and his residence. Respondent contends that under Souto and Kahn, the district court properly decided the issue. But Souto and Kahn, pertained to search warrants that sought the recovery of only drugs. See Souto, 578 N.W.2d at 749 (concluding that information in the affidavit failed to establish a sufficient nexus between any purported drug dealing in the area and the defendant\u2019s home); see also State v. Kahn, 555 N.W.2d 15, 19 (Minn.App.1996) (holding that there was not probable cause for the search of the defendant\u2019s residence because the warrant application lacked any \u201cevidence linking [defendant\u2019s] alleged possession in Minneapolis and the likelihood of evidence or contraband being found at his residence 75 to 85 miles away\u201d). In contrast, the search warrant here sought both drugs and a gun. Although we agree that the issue is close as to whether the search-warrant affidavit established a sufficient nexus between respondent\u2019s alleged drug activities and the place to be searched, we need not determine the outcome of that issue on the merits. Rather, we conclude that evidence that respondent possessed the gun is dispositive of the issue of whether the search warrant established a suffi*493cient nexus between the place to be searched and the alleged crime of terroristic threats.1\nRespondent argues that the search-warrant affidavit failed to establish probable cause because, without some evidence linking the gun to his residence, a reasonable inference that he would keep the gun at his residence was not sufficient to establish a nexus between the alleged criminal activity and the place to be searched. We disagree. It is well settled that the issuing judge may \u201cdraw common-sense and reasonable inferences from the facts and circumstances set forth in an affidavit.\u201d Brennan, 674 N.W.2d at 204. For example, this court has reasoned that because of the nature of drug trafficking, it is reasonable to assume that persons who buy and sell drugs would maintain evidence of their crime in their residence. State v. Ruoho, 685 N.W.2d 451, 457 (Minn.App.2004), review denied (Minn. Nov. 16, 2004). And the supreme court has recognized that \u201cthe normal place one would keep extra bullets for his gun ... would ... be at his residence.\u201d State v. Pierce, 358 N.W.2d 672, 674 (Minn.1984). Further, in State v. Gail, the supreme court affirmed the issuance of a warrant on the basis that it was reasonable to infer that a murder weapon would be located in the apartment where defendant was arrested. 713 N.W.2d 851, 858-59 (Minn.2006). Therefore, in light of existing precedent, we conclude that where the evidence in the search-warrant affidavit establishes that a defendant possessed a gun, it is common sense and reasonable to infer that the defendant would keep that gun at his residence. See Harris, 589 N.W.2d at 788 (stating that for purposes of issuing a search warrant, \u201c[cjommon sense permits an inference\u201d that documents showing that a suspect resided in a certain place would normally be found in a person\u2019s home).\nOur conclusion that it is common sense and reasonable to infer that a criminal would keep a gun at his residence is also supported by federal caselaw. As the state points out, the United States Third Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated that an issuing judge may infer that a criminal suspect keeps the instrumentalities and fruits of his crime at his residence. United States v. Jones, 994 F.2d 1051, 1056 (3d Cir.1993) (opining that firearms used in a robbery are \u201clikely to be kept in a suspect\u2019s residence\u201d). And the federal courts, including the United States Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, have concluded that the reasonable inferences involving \u201cinstru-mentalities\u201d include guns. See United States v. Cowling, 648 F.3d 690, 696 (8th Cir.2011) (concluding that because the warrant affidavit established probable cause that the defendant possessed stolen firearms, it follows that probable cause existed to search the defendant\u2019s residence \u201cbecause people generally keep firearms at home or on their persons\u201d), cert. denied, - U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1905, 182 L.Ed.2d 776 (2012); United States v. Steeves, 525 F.2d 33, 38 (8th Cir.1975) (noting in a bank robbery case that there *494is \u201clittle reason to believe that any of the bank\u2019s money ... would still be in the home,\u201d but \u201cthe same concession cannot be made with respect to the revolver\u201d); see also United States v. Williams, 544 F.3d 683, 688 (6th Cir.2008) (denying defendant\u2019s suppression motion because it was reasonable to infer that a defendant known to possess firearms would keep a gun at his residence and, therefore, the warrant contained a nexus between residence and the firearms that were the target of the warrant); United States v. Anderson, 851 F.2d 727, 729 (4th Cir.1988) (holding, in a case involving the illegal sale of a gun silencer, that \u201c[i]t was reasonable for the magistrate to believe that the defendant\u2019s gun and the silencer would be found in his x-esidence. Therefore, even though the affidavit contained no facts that the weapons were located in defendant\u2019s trailer, we re-jeet his argument that the warrant was defective.\u201d), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1031, 109 S.Ct. 841, 102 L.Ed.2d 973 (1989).\nHere, the evidence in the search-warrant affidavit established that respondent possessed the handgun. The logical place respondent would keep this gun is at his residence. Because it is both common sense and reasonable to infer that respondent would keep his gun at his residence, there was a nexus between the alleged criminal activity and the place to be seai'ched. Accordingly, the district court erred by granting respondent\u2019s motion to suppress.\nDECISION\nWhere the evidence in the search-warrant affidavit established that respondent possessed a gun, it was common sense and reasonable to infer that respondent would keep that gun at his residence. Therefoi\u2019e, because a nexus existed between the alleged criminal activity and the place to be searched, the district court erred by suppressing the evidence.\nReversed and remanded.\n\n. Because the \"Receipt, Inventory and Return\u201d document indicates that the controlled substances were discovered in plain view or in places that law enforcement would generally search when searching for a gun, a conclusion that there was probable cause to issue a search warrant for the gun allows for the admissibility of the controlled substances under the plain view doctrine. See State v. Zanter, 535 N.W.2d 624, 631 (Minn.1995) (stating that under the plain view doctrine, the law enforcement can, without a valid search warrant, \"seize an object they believe to be the fruit or instrumentality of a crime, provided: (1) the police are legitimately in the position from which they view the object; (2) they have a lawful right of access to the object; and (3) the object\u2019s incriminating nature is immediately apparent\u201d).\n\n",

U.S. Const, amend. IV; Minn. Const, art. I, \u00a7 10. To determine whether probable cause exists, a judge must look at the totality of the circumstances and \u201c \u2018make a practical, common sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him ... there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u2019 \u201d State v. Wiley, 366 N.W.2d 265, 268 (Minn.1985) (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). \u201cWhen the request of the court is for the issuance of a warrant to search a particular location, there must be specific facts to establish a direct connection between the alleged criminal activity and the site to be searched.\u201d State v. Souto, 578 N.W.2d 744, 749 (Minn.1998) (emphasis added). The nexus between the crime and the place to be searched is clear where direct information connects an item to a location. See State v. Cavegn, 356 N.W.2d 671, 674 (Minn.1984) (stating that nexus is clearer that drugs would be found in apartment where there is direct infoi'mation that a di\u2019ug sale occurred there).\nHex-e, the seai'ch-warrant affidavit established that respondent was allegedly making terroiistic threats and that he flashed a handgun. The search-warrant affidavit also established that a CRI saw i'espondent with a handgun in the past. Finally, the affidavit established an address at which respondent resides. There *495is, however, nothing linking the gun to that address. There is no evidence that anyone either saw a gun at the address or that respondent went to that address immediately after the alleged terroristic threats incident occurred. Moreover, there is no evidence that respondent told anyone that he kept a gun at the residence. There is simply no evidence directly connecting the gun to respondent\u2019s residence.\nThe majority concludes that the connection or \u201cnexus\u201d is established by a reasonable and common sense inference that respondent would keep the gun at his residence. I agree that a judge may \u201cdraw common-sense and reasonable inferences from the facts and circumstances set forth in the affidavit.\u201d State v. Brennan, 674 N.W.2d 200, 204 (Minn.App.2004) (quotation omitted), review denied (Minn. Apr. 20, 2004). But, the law requires more than an inference to support a nexus between the alleged crime and the place to be searched. In other words, there must be something significant \u201cconnecting\u201d the alleged criminal activity and the site to be searched. See Souto, 578 N.W.2d at 749 (stating that there must be a \u201cdirect connection\u201d between the alleged criminal activity and the site to be searched). If all that is needed to search a location is a reasonable inference, we defeat the probable cause requirement of the search warrant. Law enforcement would simply need to establish that an offender possessed a particular item, identify his or her residence, and conclude that it is \u201ccommon sense and reasonable\u201d to infer that the offender would keep that item at his or her residence. While it may be reasonable to infer that people keep many things at their residence, such an inference is not a \u201cdirect connection,\u201d which is what the law requires to issue a search warrant. See id. It is just as easy to infer that a person, particularly a person not authorized to possess a weapon, would not keep a weapon at his or her home. Therefore, because this direct connection, or nexus, between the alleged crime and the place to be searched is missing from this search-warrant affidavit, I would affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the search warrant lacked probable cause.\n",
