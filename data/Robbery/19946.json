CHRISTOPHER DEWAYNE HENSON\n\n                       Appeal from the Circuit Court for Maury County\n                         No. 21745     Stella L. Hargrove, Judge\n\n\n\n                    No. M2013-01285-CCA-R3-CD \u2013 Filed June 2, 2015\n\n\n\nThe Defendant-Appellant, Christopher Dewayne Henson, was convicted by a Maury\nCounty jury of reckless endangerment. The trial court sentenced the Defendant to 11\nmonths and 29 days and ordered that he serve 45 days in confinement, with the remainder\nof his sentence to be served on supervised probation. On appeal, the Defendant argues\nthat (1) the evidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction; (2) the trial court erred in\nadmitting color photographs of the victim\u201fs injuries; and (3) the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in sentencing the Defendant. Discerning no error, we affirm the judgment of\nthe trial court.\n\n   Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment of the Circuit Court Affirmed\n\nCAMILLE R. MCMULLEN, J., delivered the opinion of the court, in which JAMES\nCURWOOD WITT, JR. and ROGER A. PAGE, JJ., joined.\n\nWilliam C. Barnes, Cordova, Tennessee, for the Defendant-Appellant, Christopher\nDewayne Henson.\n\nRobert E. Cooper, Jr., Attorney General and Reporter; Renee W. Turner, Senior Counsel;\nMike Bottoms, District Attorney General; and Dan Runde, Assistant District Attorney\nGeneral, for the Appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                              OPINION\n\n       On April 1, 2012, the victim, Jeff Roberts, became involved in an altercation with\nhis nephew, Dylan Henson.1 The altercation began as a verbal dispute between Dylan\n        1\n         Because several witnesses share the same last name, we will refer to them by their first names.\nWe intend no disrespect in doing so.\n\fand the victim, but it eventually turned physical and involved several other family\nmembers, including the Defendant. During this altercation, the victim was struck on the\nhead with an metal bar and had to receive stitches and staples in the top and side of his\nhead.\n\n        At trial, the victim testified that on the evening of April 1, 2012, he and his\ngirlfriend, Yolanda Hill, were sitting on the front porch of her house when he saw Dylan\nand several of his friends arrive in a pickup truck. The group of teenagers parked in a\nfield across the street from Ms. Hill\u201fs home and began throwing rocks in the field. The\nvictim did not want the teenagers to throw rocks in the field because he mowed the field\nand feared the rocks would damage his lawn mower. When he asked Dylan to stop\nthrowing rocks, Dylan and his friends walked into the road and began cursing at and\nthreatening the victim. The victim\u201fs mother, Annie Spears, lived next door to Ms. Hill\nalong with the victim\u201fs sister, Kelly Henson; Kelly\u201fs husband, the Defendant; and the\nHensons\u201f two children, Dylan and Casey. Upon hearing the verbal dispute between\nDylan and the victim, Ms. Spears came onto her porch and told Dylan to come home.\nWhen he refused, Ms. Spears went inside her home and asked Kelly and the Defendant to\nbreak up the dispute. Kelly tried to persuade Dylan to come home, and the victim left\nMs. Hill\u201fs porch and walked Dylan and Kelly back towards the road. When the victim\nturned to walk back to Ms. Hill\u201fs porch, he saw Ms. Hill run past him and attack Kelly.\nWhile the victim tried to break up the fight between the two women, Dylan hit him in the\nface with a walking cane three or four times. The victim stumbled a few steps back and\nsaw the Defendant holding a metal bar in his hand. The Defendant told the victim to \u201cget\n[his] hands off his kid\u201d and then hit the victim on the head twice.\n\n        The victim identified the Defendant in court as the person who hit him with the\nmetal bar. He denied that he pulled out a knife during the altercation and insisted that he\ndid not threaten Dylan, Kelly, or the Defendant in any way before the Defendant hit him.\nHe agreed that after being hit by the Defendant, he retrieved a \u201cshepherd\u201fs cane\u201d from his\nyard and swung it at the Defendant and Dylan to get them to leave Ms. Hill\u201fs property.\nHe was uncertain whether he hit the Defendant, although he acknowledged that it was\npossible. The victim and Ms. Hill called 911 after the altercation. The police responded\nto the scene that night, and the victim and Ms. Hill went to the police station the next day\nto give a statement.\n\n       Annie Spears, the victim\u201fs mother and the Defendant\u201fs mother-in-law, testified on\nbehalf of the Defendant. She agreed that a verbal altercation broke out between Dylan\nand the victim because Dylan refused to stop throwing rocks in the field across the street.\nAccording to Ms. Spears, the victim pulled a knife out of his pocket and Dylan retrieved\nMs. Spears\u201fs walking cane out of her car. She told the victim, \u201c[Y]ou better not cut . . .\n                                            -2-\n\fone of my grandkids,\u201d and he put the knife back in his pocket; however, Dylan continued\n\u201cbacking [the victim] up\u201d towards Ms. Hill\u201fs house so the victim retrieved a shepherd\u201fs\ncane out of the yard. Ms. Spears observed Dylan hit the victim with the walking cane.\nShe testified that she sent Kelly and the Defendant to break up the altercation, and when\nthe Defendant walked into Ms. Hill\u201fs yard to make Dylan come home, \u201cit just went\ncrazy.\u201d Ms. Hill retrieved a metal bar from her house and walked into the yard, and the\nvictim continued to swing the shepherd\u201fs cane at Dylan and the Defendant. Ms. Spears\ntestified that a physical fight broke out between the Defendant and the victim after the\nvictim hit the Defendant with the shepherd\u201fs cane. Ms. Spears agreed that the Defendant\nand the victim were \u201cknuckling it out,\u201d but she testified that she never saw the Defendant\nhit the victim with a metal bar.\n\n        On cross-examination, Ms. Spears acknowledged that the Defendant could have\nhit the victim with a metal bar, but she did not see it happen. She agreed that she \u201creally\n[did not] know what the circumstances were, at the time, when [the victim] got hit with\nthe bar . . . [b]ecause there was so much confusion\u201d and added, \u201cIt could have been\nanybody that hit [the victim].\u201d She also agreed that the victim showed her his head\ninjuries that night after the altercation.\n\n       Joshua Braden, a police officer with the Mount Pleasant Police Department,\nresponded to the scene on April 1, 2012. According to Officer Braden\u201fs incident report,\nDylan reported that the victim had a knife in his hand at some point during the\naltercation, but no other witnesses reported seeing a knife. He confirmed that Ms. Spears\nnever told him that she saw the victim with a knife that night. Officer Braden testified\nthat he observed several injuries to the victim\u201fs head and face, including a swollen eye\nand a \u201cbig cut\u201d on the top of his head. Officer Braden recovered a walking cane from\nMs. Spears after being informed by witnesses that it was used to hit the victim. The\nvictim told Officer Braden that the Defendant also hit him with a metal bar, which\nOfficer Braden found in a trailer attached to the Defendant\u201fs car. On cross-examination,\nOfficer Braden stated that the Defendant reported that the victim initially attacked him\nwith the metal bar and that he took it away and hit the victim with it. He conceded that\nhe could not recall whether he asked Ms. Spears if the victim had a knife during the\naltercation.\n\n       Following deliberations, the jury convicted the Defendant of reckless\nendangerment as a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault. A sentencing hearing\nwas held on April 11, 2013, after which the trial court sentenced the Defendant to 11\nmonths and 29 days and ordered him to serve 45 days in confinement with the remainder\nof his sentence to be served on supervised probation. On April 18, 2013, the Defendant\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\ffiled a timely motion for new trial, which was denied by the trial court on May 16, 2013.\nSubsequently, the Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n                                               ANALYSIS\n\n        On appeal, the Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the convicting evidence.\nHe also argues that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting color photographs of\nthe victim\u201fs injuries and in sentencing the Defendant. The State responds that the\nevidence is sufficient to sustain the Defendant\u201fs conviction for reckless endangerment\nand maintains that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in the admission of evidence\nor in sentencing the Defendant. We agree with the State.\n\n        I. Sufficiency of the Evidence. The Defendant argues that the evidence is\ninsufficient to sustain his conviction for reckless endangerment. He asserts that the\nevidence establishes that the altercation was \u201cmutual combat,\u201d and given that he did not\nstart the altercation and was the last person involved in the fight, he is \u201cclearly . . . the\nleast culpable.\u201d The State responds that the evidence is sufficient to sustain the\nDefendant\u201fs conviction.2\n\n        When considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, the State is entitled to\nthe strongest legitimate view of the evidence and all reasonable inferences which may be\ndrawn from that evidence. State v. Davis, 354 S.W.3d 718, 729 (Tenn. 2011) (citing\nState v. Majors, 318 S.W.3d 850, 857 (Tenn. 2010)). When a defendant challenges the\nsufficiency of the evidence, the standard of review applied by this court is \u201cwhether, after\nreviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of\nfact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979). Similarly, Rule 13(e) of the Tennessee\nRules of Appellate Procedure states, \u201cFindings of guilt in criminal actions whether by the\ntrial court or jury shall be set aside if the evidence is insufficient to support the finding by\nthe trier of fact of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \u201cBecause a verdict of guilt removes\nthe presumption of innocence and raises a presumption of guilt, the criminal defendant\n\n        2\n           In addition to addressing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the Defendant\u201fs conviction,\nthe State\u201fs brief also thoroughly addresses the trial court\u201fs role as the thirteenth juror. See Tenn. R. Crim.\nPro 33(d) (providing that the trial court \u201cmay grant a new trial following a verdict of guilty if it disagrees\nwith the jury about the weight of the evidence\u201d). The Defendant\u201fs brief does not clearly challenge the\ntrial court\u201fs actions as thirteenth juror, although his argument appears to suggest that the jury\u201fs verdict is\nagainst the weight of the evidence. In any event, the trial court properly fulfilled its role as the thirteenth\njuror in this case, stating on the record, \u201cAs Thirteenth Juror, the [c]ourt accepts and approves the verdict\nof this Jury.\u201d Accordingly, this issue is not subject to appellate review, and our review is limited to the\nsufficiency of the evidence. See State v. Moats, 906 S.W.2d 431, 435 (Tenn. 1995) (citing State v.\nBurlison, 868 S.W.2d 713, 719 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993)).\n                                                       -4-\n\fbears the burden on appeal of showing that the evidence was legally insufficient to\nsustain a guilty verdict.\u201d State v. Hanson, 279 S.W.3d 265, 275 (Tenn. 2009).\n\n       Guilt may be found beyond a reasonable doubt where there is direct evidence,\ncircumstantial evidence, or a combination of the two. State v. Matthews, 805 S.W.2d\n776, 779 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1990) (citing State v. Brown, 551 S.W.2d 329, 331 (Tenn.\n1977); Farmer v. State, 343 S.W.2d 895, 897 (Tenn. 1961)). The standard of review for\nsufficiency of the evidence \u201c\u201eis the same whether the conviction is based upon direct or\ncircumstantial evidence.\u201f\u201d State v. Dorantes, 331 S.W.3d 370, 379 (Tenn. 2011) (quoting\nHanson, 279 S.W.3d at 275). The jury as the trier of fact must evaluate the credibility of\nthe witnesses, determine the weight given to witnesses\u201f testimony, and reconcile all\nconflicts in the evidence. State v. Campbell, 245 S.W.3d 331, 335 (Tenn. 2008) (citing\nByrge v. State, 575 S.W.2d 292, 295 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1978)). Moreover, the jury\ndetermines the weight to be given to circumstantial evidence and the inferences to be\ndrawn from this evidence, and the extent to which the circumstances are consistent with\nguilt and inconsistent with innocence are questions primarily for the jury. Dorantes, 331\nS.W.3d at 379 (citing State v. Rice, 184 S.W.3d 646, 662 (Tenn. 2006)). When\nconsidering the sufficiency of the evidence, this court shall not reweigh the evidence or\nsubstitute its inferences for those drawn by the trier of fact. Id.\n\n        Here, the Defendant was charged with aggravated assault but was convicted of the\nlesser-included offense of misdemeanor reckless endangerment. A person commits\nreckless endangerment \u201cwho recklessly engages in conduct that places or may place\nanother person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 39-13-\n103(a). A person acts recklessly \u201cwhen the person is aware of but consciously disregards\na substantial and unjustifiable risk that the circumstances exist or the result will occur.\u201d\nId. \u00a7 39-11-302(c). This \u201crisk must be of such a nature and degree that its disregard\nconstitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that an ordinary person would\nexercise under all the circumstances as viewed from the accused person\u201fs standpoint.\u201d\nId. Serious bodily injury includes bodily injury that involves a substantial risk of death,\nprotracted unconsciousness, extreme physical pain, or protracted or obvious\ndisfigurement. Id. \u00a7 39-11-106(34).\n\n       In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, the Defendant does not specifically\ncontest any elements of the offense of reckless endangerment; rather, he simply claims\nthat as the last person involved in the altercation, he was the \u201cleast culpable.\u201d Even if\ntrue, however, this fact has no bearing on the jury\u201fs finding that the Defendant\u201fs reckless\nconduct placed the victim in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury. Viewed\nin the light most favorable to the State, the evidence at trial established that during an\naltercation involving several family members, the Defendant struck the victim at least\n                                            -5-\n\ftwo times in the head with a metal bar. As a result, the victim sustained two large cuts to\nhis head that required stitches and staples. Although witnesses provided somewhat\nconflicting accounts about the altercation, the jury\u201fs verdict of guilt resolved all conflicts\nin the evidence in favor of the State\u201fs theory. See State v. Bland, 958 S.W.2d 651, 659\n(Tenn. 1997) (citing State v. Grace, 493 S.W.2d 474, 476 (Tenn. 1973)). We will not\nreweigh or reevaluate this evidence on appeal. See Dorantes, 331 S.W.3d at 379. Based\nupon the record, we conclude that a rational juror could find beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the Defendant\u201fs reckless conduct placed the victim in imminent danger of death or\nserious bodily injury. He is not entitled to relief on this issue.\n\n       II. Admission of Color Photographs. The Defendant next asserts that the trial\ncourt erred in admitting eight color photographs of the victim\u201fs injuries because they\nwere unfairly prejudicial. He argues that the color photographs were cumulative in\nnature given that three black and white photographs of the victim\u201fs injuries had already\nbeen introduced, and the only purpose in admitting the color photographs was to inflame\nthe jury. The State responds that the photographs were relevant to show the victim\u201fs\ninjuries and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing their admission.\n\n        The admissibility of photographs lies within the sound discretion of the trial court,\nand the court\u201fs ruling on admissibility will not be overturned on appeal absent a showing\nthat the trial court abused that discretion. State v. Odom, 336 S.W.3d 541, 565 (Tenn.\n2011) (citing State v. Banks, 564 S.W.2d 947, 949 (Tenn. 1978)). To be admissible, a\nphotograph must be relevant to an issue in dispute. State v. Vann, 976 S.W.2d 93, 102\n(Tenn. 1998) (citing State v. Stephenson, 878 S.W.2d 530, 542 (Tenn. 1994); Banks, 564\nS.W.2d at 951). Relevant evidence is \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the\nexistence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more\nprobable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Tenn. R. Evid. 401.\nHowever, a relevant photograph \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the\njury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\ncumulative evidence.\u201d Tenn. R. Evid. 403. Unfair prejudice has been defined by the\nTennessee Supreme Court as \u201can undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper\nbasis, commonly, though not necessarily an emotional one.\u201d Banks, 564 S.W.2d at 951.\nPhotographs must never be used \u201csolely to inflame the jury and prejudice them against\nthe defendant.\u201d Id.\n\n       After reviewing the photographs in the instant case, we conclude that they were\nrelevant to show the extent of the victim\u201fs injuries, and the probative value of the\nphotographs was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Initially\nwe note that \u201ca relevant photograph is not rendered inadmissible merely because it is\n                                             -6-\n\fcumulative.\u201d State v. Morris, 24 S.W.2d 788, 811 (Tenn. 2000); see also State v. Van\nTran, 864 S.W.2d 465, 477 (Tenn. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1046 (1994) (color\nphotographs of deceased victims at crime scene were not unnecessarily cumulative or\nprejudicial despite admission of color videotape showing victims\u201f bodies as they were\nfound); State v. Brown, 836 S.W.2d 530, 551 (Tenn. 1992) (photographs of the victim\u201fs\nbody were admissible despite oral testimony graphically describing the victim\u201fs injuries).\nAlthough three black and white photographs also showing the victim\u201fs injuries were\nintroduced, the color photographs more clearly depicted the extent of the victim\u201fs\ninjuries, which was essential to the State\u201fs case.3 See State v. Melissa J. Pewitt, No.\n01C01-9706-CR-00229, 1998 WL 410883, at *5 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 23, 1998)\n(photographs of victim\u201fs injuries were relevant in prosecution for especially aggravated\nburglary because the State was required to prove the victim suffered \u201cserious bodily\ninjury\u201d and were not unnecessarily cumulative despite victim\u201fs display of the scars on her\nbody to the jury). Further, the photographs were not particularly gruesome or\ninflamatory. Accordingly, we discern no abuse of discretion by the trial court in allowing\nthe photographs\u201f admission.\n\n        III. Sentencing. In his final issue on appeal, the Defendant argues that the trial\ncourt imposed an excessive sentence. The Defendant again emphasizes that he \u201cwas the\nlast person to join into this fight\u201d and maintains that \u201c[j]ustice requires a different\noutcome.\u201d However, the Defendant failed to support this issue with sufficient argument\nor citations to authority. As such, this issue is technically waived. See Tenn. Ct. Crim.\nApp. R. 10(b) (\u201cIssues which are not supported by argument, citation to authorities, or\nappropriate references to the record will be treated as waived in this court.\u201d); see also\nTenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7) (A brief shall contain \u201c[a]n argument . . . setting forth the\ncontentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor,\nincluding the reasons why the contentions require appellate relief, with citations to the\nauthorities and appropriate references to the record . . . relied on.\u201d). Waiver\nnotwithstanding, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing\nthe Defendant.\n\n       Recently, the Tennessee Supreme Court concluded that a trial court\u201fs sentencing\ndeterminations in felony cases should be reviewed under \u201can abuse of discretion standard\nof review, granting a presumption of reasonableness to within-range sentencing decisions\nthat reflect a proper application of the purposes and principles of our Sentencing Act.\u201d\nState v. Bise, 380 S.W.3d 682, 707 (Tenn. 2012). Shortly thereafter, the Tennessee\nSupreme Court applied the abuse of discretion standard, accompanied by a presumption\n\n        3\n          Although the Defendant was convicted of reckless endangerment, which does not require proof\nof bodily injury, the Defendant was indicted and tried for aggravated assault, which required the State to\nprove that the victim suffered serious bodily injury. See T.C.A. \u00a7 39-13-102.\n                                                     -7-\n\fof reasonableness, to \u201cquestions related to probation or any other alternative sentence.\u201d\nState v. Caudle, 388 S.W.3d 273, 278-79 (Tenn. 2012). To date, the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt has not addressed whether the abuse of discretion standard with a presumption of\nreasonableness applies to misdemeanor sentencing. Notwithstanding, the reasoning\nespoused in State v. King, that Bise applies to \u201call sentencing decisions,\u201d suggests that it\nis the appropriate standard of review to apply to misdemeanor sentencing cases as well.\nSee King, 432 S.W.3d 316, 324 (Tenn. 2014) (emphasis added). Moreover, this court has\nrecently applied the Bise standard of review to misdemeanor sentencing cases. See State\nv. Michael Glen Walsh, No. E2012-00805-CCA-R3-CD, 2013 WL 1636661, at *4 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Apr. 17, 2013); State v. Sue Ann Christopher, No. E2012-01090-CCA-R3-\nCD, 2013 WL 1088341, at *7 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 14, 2013). Therefore, we will do\nthe same in this case.\n\n       Pursuant to the 2005 amendments to the sentencing act, a trial court must consider\nthe following when determining a defendant's specific sentence and the appropriate\ncombination of sentencing alternatives:\n\n       (1) The evidence, if any, received at the trial and the sentencing hearing;\n       (2) The presentence report;\n       (3) The principles of sentencing and arguments as to sentencing\n       alternatives;\n       (4) The nature and characteristics of the criminal conduct involved;\n       (5) Evidence and information offered by the parties on the mitigating and\n       enhancement factors set out in \u00a7\u00a7 40-35-113 and 40-35-114;\n       (6) Any statistical information provided by the administrative office of the\n       courts as to sentencing practices for similar offenses in Tennessee; and\n       (7) Any statement the defendant wishes to make in the defendant\u201fs own\n       behalf about sentencing.\n\nT.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-210(b) (2012). The defendant has the burden of showing the impropriety\nof the sentence on appeal. Id. \u00a7 40-35-401(d) (2012), Sentencing Comm\u201fn Comments.\n\n       Misdemeanor sentencing is governed by Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-\n35-302, which provides, in part, that the trial court shall impose a specific sentence that is\nconsistent with the purposes and principles of the 1989 Sentencing Reform Act. See\nT.C.A. \u00a7 40-25-302(b). The sentencing court is granted considerable latitude in\nmisdemeanor sentencing. State v. Johnson, 15 S.W.3d 515, 518 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999)\n(citing State v. Troutman, 979 S.W.2d 271, 273 (Tenn. 1998)). The trial court must\nconsider the purposes and principles of sentencing and the appropriate enhancement and\nmitigating factors, but the court is not required to place specific findings on the record.\n                                             -8-\n\fT.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-302(d); Troutman, 979 S.W.2d at 274. \u201cRather, the court must only\navoid arbitrarily imposing incarceration.\u201d State v. Heath Baldwin, No. W2005-02906-\nCCA-R3-CD, 2007 WL 845911, at *4 (Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 21, 2007) (citing\nTroutman, 979 S.W.2d at 274).\n\n       Unlike felons, \u201cmisdemeanants are not given the presumption of a minimum\nsentence.\u201d State v. Creasy, 885 S.W.2d 829, 832 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994). Further,\nthose convicted of a misdemeanor are not presumed eligible for alternative sentencing.\nState v. Williams, 914 S.W.2d 940, 949 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995) (citing Creasy, 885\nS.W.2d at 832-33). The misdemeanor sentencing statute requires that the trial court\nconsider the purposes and principles of sentencing when calculating the percentage of the\nsentence to be served in confinement prior to \u201cconsideration for work release, furlough,\ntrusty status and related rehabilitative programs.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 40-35-302(b), (d) (2012).\nHowever, there is no strict requirement that the trial court make findings on the record\nregarding the percentage of the defendant\u201fs sentence to be served in confinement.\nTroutman, 979 S.W.2d at 274.\n\n        In the instant case, the trial court\u201fs oral sentencing findings show that it considered\nthe purposes and principles of the sentencing act and complied with the misdemeanor\nsentencing statute in imposing the Defendant\u201fs sentence. The record establishes that the\ncourt reviewed the presentence report and considered the victim\u201fs testimony and the\nnature of the offense when determining the manner and length of the Defendant\u201fs\nsentence. The court noted that the Defendant refused to take responsibility for his\nconduct, and it emphasized the serious injuries suffered by the victim. Although the\ncourt did not place its findings regarding its consideration of the applicable enhancement\nand mitigating factors on the record, it was not required to do so in a misdemeanor\nsentencing case. See Troutman, 979 S.W.2d at 274. The record reflects that the trial\ncourt properly considered the sentencing principles and imposed a sentence that was not\narbitrary. Accordingly, we discern no abuse of discretion. The Defendant is not entitled\nto relief.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       Based on the foregoing authorities and analysis, the judgment of the trial court is\naffirmed.\n\n                                                    _________________________________\n                                                    CAMILLE R.
