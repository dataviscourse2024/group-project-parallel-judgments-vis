The government argues that the district court incorrectly categorized the\n\n23   informant as anonymous and therefore required too high a level of corroboration. Defendant\n\n24   cross-appeals from the district court\u2019s ruling that evidence found pursuant to a search warrant\n\n25   issued based on the fruits of the stop should not be excluded under the good faith exception to\n\n26   the warrant requirement. The government also contends that the district court erred in ruling that\n\n27   the defendant had Fourth Amendment \u201cstanding\u201d to challenge the search warrant.\n\n28\n\n\n29                                             Background\n\n30   I. Facts\n\n\n\n     2\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1           On June 22, 2003, Detective Thomas Roncinske of the Norwalk Police Department\n\n 2   received a telephone call from a woman claiming to be a close friend of the defendant Vamond\n\n 3   Elmore. The caller identified herself as \u201cDorothy\u201d and provided Roncinske with her home and\n\n 4   cell phone numbers. She told Roncinske that Elmore was in possession of some weapons and\n\n 5   expressed concern that he might \u201cdo harm to somebody.\u201d Roncinske had not previously used the\n\n 6   caller as a confidential informant and had never spoken to her before. Roncinske spoke with the\n\n 7   caller approximately four times throughout the course of the day, gradually obtaining more\n\n 8   information from her about herself and the defendant. He was able to communicate with her\n\n 9   several times by calling the cell phone number that she had given him.\n\n10           During the course of these calls, the caller eventually told Roncinske that her full name\n\n11   was Dorothy Mazza and that she had been Elmore\u2019s girlfriend, but she had recently kicked him\n\n12   out of her house. Roncinske used a Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) database to obtain an\n\n13   address and birthdate for a Dorothy Mazza, but he did not go to the address that he found.1 In an\n\n14   attempt to verify her identity, Roncinske asked Mazza about an incident in 2002 in which\n\n15   Elmore had been shot. Mazza knew about the incident and described the specific injuries that\n\n16   Elmore had sustained. She said she was the one who nursed him back to health. She also said\n\n17   that Elmore had been shot in retaliation for having pistol-whipped a man named Demark Bond.\n\n18   This information matched police reports on Elmore\u2019s injuries and the police\u2019s theory on a\n\n19   possible motive for the shooting. Details about the shooting and Elmore\u2019s injuries had been\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The record d oes not reflect whether Roncinske quizzed Maz za on the information he was able to obtain from the\n     DM V reco rds.\n     3\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   reported in several local newspaper articles, but the police\u2019s theory about the motive was not\n\n 2   public information.\n\n 3          Roncinske did not meet face-to-face with Mazza because she said she was afraid of what\n\n 4   would happen to her if she was seen working with the police. Mazza also insisted that her name\n\n 5   be left out of any police reports because she knew that the defendant had weapons and was afraid\n\n 6   that he would retaliate against her. Roncinske did not go to the address he had obtained from the\n\n 7   DMV, nor did he attempt to call Mazza on the home telephone number she had given him.\n\n 8   There is no evidence that Roncinske checked whether the phone numbers she gave him were\n\n 9   registered to Dorothy Mazza.\n\n10          Mazza told Roncinske that she had seen Elmore in possession of several firearms at her\n\n11   residence as recently as June 19, 2003 (three days earlier) and that was why she kicked him out.\n\n12   These weapons included a .38 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver loaded with hollow point\n\n13   bullets, a .22 caliber pistol, a .38 caliber revolver, a \u201criot pump\u201d shotgun, and an AK-47 assault\n\n14   rifle. She said that Elmore kept the Smith & Wesson in his car, which she described as a black\n\n15   two-door Acura with tinted windows and new Connecticut license plates that recently had been\n\n16   switched over from temporary plates. She said that she had seen the gun hidden under an altered\n\n17   piece of carpet on the passenger\u2019s side of Elmore\u2019s car.\n\n18          Mazza said that Elmore told her that he now kept the rest of the weapons with a woman\n\n19   named Tanea and in the car of one Dwayne Sherman. She told Roncinske that Tanea lived in\n\n20   Building 14 at 133 Monterey Place, in the apartment directly upstairs from Dwayne Sherman\n\n21   and his wife, in an area of Norwalk, Connecticut known as Carlton Court. She said that Elmore\n\n\n     4\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   frequented the Carlton Court and Round Tree Motel areas of Norwalk. Mazza also told\n\n 2   Roncinske that Dwayne Sherman\u2019s BMW was parked outside Building 14.\n\n 3           Roncinske took several steps to attempt to corroborate the information that he got from\n\n 4   Mazza. He went to 133 Monterey Place and found a BMW registered to Dwayne Sherman\n\n 5   parked in front of Building 13, which shares a parking lot with Building 14. He learned that\n\n 6   Dwayne Sherman\u2019s wife, Denita Sherman, leased an apartment in Building 14 and that a Myra\n\n 7   Humphrey leased the apartment above the Shermans.2 Finally, Roncinske checked Elmore and\n\n 8   Sherman\u2019s criminal histories and discovered that they had been arrested together for armed\n\n 9   robbery.\n\n10           Based on the information he obtained from Mazza and his independent investigation,\n\n11   Roncinske drafted a memo to all Norwalk police officers indicating that he had received\n\n12   information that Elmore was in possession of a handgun. The memo stated that Elmore drove a\n\n13   black, two-door 1992 Acura whose last known registration was temporary, but now had regular\n\n14   Connecticut plates and that he frequents the Carlton Court and Round Tree Motel areas. The\n\n15   memo also warned that the weapon may be hidden under the carpet on the passenger side. A\n\n16   photograph of Elmore was attached to the memo.\n\n17           Sergeant Kenneth King received Roncinske\u2019s memo at the start of his late night shift on\n\n18   June 24, 2003. Sometime shortly after 11:30 p.m. on June 24, Sergeant King and Officer Mark\n\n19   Suda, driving in separate cars, saw a black two-door Acura with tinted windows driving in the\n\n20   vicinity of Carlton Court. The officers, who knew Elmore from prior encounters, identified him\n\n\n     2\n      Myra H umphrey turned out to be Tanea H umphrey\u2019s mother. Tanea also lived in the apartment, but Roncinske\n     was not aware of this prior to the stop in question.\n     5\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   as the driver by looking through the untinted front windshield of the car as it passed. The\n\n 2   officers turned their cars around, followed Elmore\u2019s car and then pulled it over. They\n\n 3   approached the car and asked the occupants, Elmore and a woman Suda identified as Tanea\n\n 4   Humphrey, to step out of the car. King examined the passenger compartment and found a .38\n\n 5   caliber Smith & Wesson underneath the driver\u2019s seat. The police placed Elmore under arrest and\n\n 6   then took Tanea Humphrey to her residence at 133 Monterey Place.\n\n 7           Following the arrest, Roncinske applied for a search warrant for Tanea Humphrey\u2019s\n\n 8   apartment and Dwayne Sherman\u2019s car based on the information he had received from Mazza, his\n\n 9   own investigation, and the results of the stop that led to Elmore\u2019s arrest. A search warrant issued\n\n10   and the Norwalk police went to Humphrey\u2019s apartment on June 27, 2003. Upon entering, they\n\n11   read Humphrey Miranda warnings and asked her where the weapons were located. She told\n\n12   them the weapons were in two bags in her bedroom closet, which Elmore had asked her to keep\n\n13   for him. The police retrieved and opened the bags which contained an AK-47 assault rifle with\n\n14   an accompanying loaded magazine, a .22 caliber pistol, a shotgun, and a box of 500 rounds of\n\n15   .22 caliber ammunition. The police also found a .38 caliber revolver, loose ammunition, and\n\n16   some crack cocaine in Dwayne Sherman\u2019s car, but none of that contraband was charged in this\n\n17   case.\n\n18           Elmore had a limited connection with Humphrey\u2019s apartment. He and Humphrey had\n\n19   been friends for one to two years. He did not reside at her apartment, nor had he ever been an\n\n20   overnight guest or even stayed for dinner. He did not have unfettered access to the apartment\n\n21   and had only been there approximately seven to ten times, each time only for about five minutes.\n\n22   His main link to the apartment was that Humphrey allowed him to store his bags in her closet.\n     6\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   II. The District Court\u2019s Decision\n\n 2           Defendant was charged with two counts of being a felon in possession of firearms: Count\n\n 3   One for the weapons found in Tanea Humphrey\u2019s apartment and Count Two for the weapon\n\n 4   found in his car. Elmore moved to suppress the evidence in both counts, arguing that the police\n\n 5   lacked sufficient, reliable information to form a reasonable suspicion to justify an investigatory\n\n 6   stop under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), and without the evidence they obtained during the\n\n 7   stop, the police lacked probable cause to support the search warrant for Tanea Humphrey\u2019s\n\n 8   apartment.\n\n 9           The district court held that, because the police did not do enough to confirm Mazza\u2019s\n\n10   identity and therefore \u201cRoncinske did not really know with whom he was speaking,\u201d she should\n\n11   be treated as an anonymous informant. United States v. Elmore, 359 F. Supp. 2d 105, 114 (D.\n\n12   Conn. 2005). Analyzing Mazza\u2019s tip under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions on anonymous\n\n13   informants in Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325 (1990) and Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266 (2000),\n\n14   the district court found that the tip lacked the necessary indicia of reliability to establish\n\n15   reasonable suspicion because Roncinske was not able to corroborate sufficiently the information\n\n16   she gave. Specifically, the district court noted Roncinske\u2019s failure to corroborate, with any\n\n17   specificity, predictive information about the future actions of third parties. Roncinske was only\n\n18   able to corroborate easily obtained information.\n\n19           The district court found, and the government does not contest, that without the evidence\n\n20   they obtained when they stopped Elmore\u2019s car, the police lacked probable cause to support the\n\n21   search warrant for Tanea Humphrey\u2019s apartment and therefore the warrant was invalid. The\n\n22   district court further held that although Elmore lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in\n     7\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   Tanea Humphrey\u2019s apartment, he had Fourth Amendment \u201cstanding\u201d to challenge the validity of\n\n 2   the search warrant because he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his closed bags within\n\n 3   the apartment. But the court went on to find that the \u201cgood faith exception\u201d to the exclusionary\n\n 4   rule, set forth in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 913-15 (1984), applied. Because the\n\n 5   officers reasonably relied on the search warrant issued by a neutral magistrate, whom they had\n\n 6   not knowingly misled, the evidence they found by searching Humprey\u2019s apartment should not be\n\n 7   excluded.\n\n 8          The government took an interlocutory appeal from the decision on Count Two to\n\n 9   suppress the evidence found in Elmore\u2019s car. The defendant pleaded guilty to Count One\n\n10   charging the weapons found in Humphrey\u2019s apartment, subject to this appeal from the district\n\n11   court\u2019s application of the good faith exception, and was sentenced to 92 months imprisonment.\n\n12   The government also challenges the district court\u2019s finding that Elmore had \u201cstanding\u201d to\n\n13   challenge the warrant.\n\n14\n\n\n15                                               Discussion\n\n16   I. The Terry Stop\n\n17          A. Standard of Review and Law Governing Terry Stops\n\n18          On appeal from a ruling on a motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s ultimate\n\n19   determinations of reasonable suspicion or probable cause de novo, but of course review findings\n\n20   of fact for clear error. Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996).\n\n21          Under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), police may briefly detain an individual for\n\n22   questioning if they have a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot, and may frisk him\n     8\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   if they reasonably believe he is armed and dangerous. United States v. Colon, 250 F.3d 130, 134\n\n 2   (2d Cir. 2001). When a suspect is stopped in a car, the police may perform a limited search of\n\n 3   the passenger compartment if they reasonably believe that he is dangerous and may gain\n\n 4   immediate control of a weapon. Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1049-50 (1983). A Terry\n\n 5   stop represents an intermediate response allowing police to pursue a limited investigation when\n\n 6   they lack the precise level of information necessary for probable cause to arrest. Adams v.\n\n 7   Williams, 407 U.S.143, 145-46 (1972). Reasonable suspicion requires more than an \u201cinchoate\n\n 8   and unparticularized suspicion or hunch.\u201d White, 496 U.S. at 329-30 (internal quotation marks\n\n 9   omitted). Police \u201cmust be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together\n\n10   with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant [the] intrusion [on a citizen\u2019s\n\n11   liberty interest].\u201d Terry, 392 U.S. at 21. Like probable cause, reasonable suspicion is\n\n12   determined based on the totality of the circumstances but \u201cthe likelihood of criminal activity\n\n13   need not rise to the level required for probable cause, and it falls considerably short of satisfying\n\n14   a preponderance of the evidence standard.\u201d United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 273-74\n\n15   (2002).\n\n16\n\n\n17             B. Forming Reasonable Suspicion from Informants\u2019 Tips\n\n18             Reasonable suspicion may be based upon information from a confidential informant so\n\n19   long as the tip bears sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d Williams, 407 U.S. at 147. As in the\n\n20   probable cause context, courts must assess whether an informant\u2019s tip establishes reasonable\n\n21   suspicion under the totality of the circumstances approach set forth in Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S.\n\n22   213 (1983), though obviously a lesser showing is required. See White, 496 U.S. at 328-29.\n     9\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   Although in Gates the Supreme Court abandoned the rigid two-pronged test of Aguilar v. Texas,\n\n 2   378 U.S. 108 (1964), and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410 (1969), the informant\u2019s \u201cbasis\n\n 3   of knowledge\u201d and \u201cveracity\u201d (i.e., how he knows and why we should believe him) remain\n\n 4   highly relevant to a determination of either probable cause or reasonable suspicion. See White,\n\n 5   496 U.S. at 328-29.\n\n 6          When the informant\u2019s tip, standing alone, lacks sufficient indicia of reliability because it\n\n 7   does not do enough to establish the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge and veracity, it may still\n\n 8   support a finding of reasonable suspicion if sufficiently corroborated through independent police\n\n 9   investigation. Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307 (1959), provides the classic example. In\n\n10   Draper, a known and previously accurate informant told the police that Draper would arrive in\n\n11   Denver on a train from Chicago on one of two days carrying heroin. Id. at 309. He would be\n\n12   wearing a light colored raincoat, brown slacks, and black shoes, and he habitually \u201cwalked real\n\n13   fast.\u201d Id. at 309 & n.2. The informant gave no indication of the basis for his information. On\n\n14   one of the appointed days, the police in Denver observed a man matching Draper\u2019s description\n\n15   and wearing the predicted clothes get off a train from Chicago and begin walking quickly; they\n\n16   arrested him. Id. at 309-10. The Supreme Court held that the police had probable cause to arrest\n\n17   Draper because they had corroborated \u201cevery other bit\u201d of the informant\u2019s tip and therefore had\n\n18   reasonable grounds to believe that the remaining unverified bit\u2014that Draper was carrying\n\n19   heroin\u2014was true. Id. at 313.\n\n20          Even a tip from a completely anonymous informant\u2014though it will seldom demonstrate\n\n21   basis of knowledge and the veracity of an anonymous informant is largely unknowable, see\n\n22   White, 496 U.S. at 329\u2014can form the basis of reasonable suspicion or probable cause if it is\n     10\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   sufficiently corroborated. In Spinelli, the Supreme Court cited Draper for the proposition that if\n\n 2   an informant provided sufficient details, including predictions about the future actions of third\n\n 3   parties, and those details are independently corroborated, the police could infer that the\n\n 4   informant had some sort of inside information as his basis of knowledge. 393 U.S. at 416-17.\n\n 5   Justice White, in his concurrence, stressed that Draper should not stand for the proposition that\n\n 6   because some of the informant\u2019s tip proved to be true that the police could infer that the final\n\n 7   critical fact was also true. In Justice White\u2019s view, corroboration did little to bolster veracity.\n\n 8   Id. at 426-27 (White, J., concurring). In Gates, however, the Court reinterpreted Draper,\n\n 9   implicitly disavowing Justice White\u2019s limitation. Stressing the importance of predictive\n\n10   information, the Court held that corroboration of some of the information in the tip allows the\n\n11   police to reasonably infer that the remaining, unverified information is also true. Gates, 462\n\n12   U.S. at 243-45. Under the totality of the circumstances approach mandated by Gates, even a\n\n13   completely anonymous tip could support a finding of probable cause with a sufficient degree of\n\n14   corroboration. The degree of corroboration required for a finding of reasonable suspicion is\n\n15   obviously less. White, 496 U.S. at 330-31.\n\n16          The Supreme Court discussed reasonable suspicion based on tips by anonymous\n\n17   informants in two cases: Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325 (1990) and Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S.\n\n18   266 (2000). Theses cases represent two poles on the spectrum of the degree of corroboration\n\n19   needed and formed the framework for the district court\u2019s analysis. The district court in the\n\n20   instant case followed J.L., in which the police received a completely anonymous tip that a young\n\n21   black man in a plaid shirt at a particular bus stop had a gun. 529 U.S. at 268. There the Supreme\n\n22   Court held that the anonymous tip, plus corroboration of the fact that a black man with a plaid\n     11\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   shirt was at the bus stop, did not constitute reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk the man. Id. at\n\n 2   271-72. In White, on the other hand, a completely anonymous informant told the police that the\n\n 3   suspect would leave a particular apartment at a particular time and drive to a particular\n\n 4   destination in a particular car carrying drugs. 496 U.S. at 327. The police observed that the\n\n 5   suspect leave the apartment building, get in the car and drive in the direction of the destination\n\n 6   before stopping her. Id. The Court called it a close case, but held that because the tip predicted\n\n 7   with specificity the future movements of a third party, there was reasonable suspicion. Id. at\n\n 8   332. In this case the district court distinguished White because here the police did not\n\n 9   corroborate any predictive information that might make an anonymous tip sufficiently reliable to\n\n10   support reasonable suspicion.\n\n11          Where informants are known, however, a lesser degree of corroboration is required.\n\n12   Compare Williams, 407 U.S. at 146-47 (upholding a Terry stop based on an uncorroborated tip\n\n13   from a known and previously reliable informant), with White, 496 U.S. at 331-32 (holding that\n\n14   an anonymous tip justified a Terry stop because both innocent details and predictive information\n\n15   were corroborated). A known informant\u2019s reputation may be assessed and he may be held\n\n16   accountable if his allegations turn out to be fabricated. J.L., 529 U.S. at 270. While a proven\n\n17   track record of providing reliable tips may serve to bolster an informant\u2019s veracity, past\n\n18   performance is not the only way to show veracity. See United States v. Canfield, 212 F.3d 713,\n\n19   719-20 (2d Cir. 2000). The veracity of identified private citizen informants (as opposed to paid\n\n20   or professional criminal informants) is generally presumed in the absence of special\n\n21   circumstances suggesting that they should not be trusted. See Caldarola v. Calabrese, 298 F.3d\n\n22   156, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2002); United States v. Rollins, 522 F.2d 160, 164 (2d Cir. 1975) (noting\n     12\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   the \u201cpeculiar likelihood of accuracy\u201d of a citizen informant\u2019s report). Likewise, we have held\n\n 2   that an informant is more reliable if he meets with the police face-to-face because he runs a\n\n 3   greater risk that he will be held accountable if his information proves false. United States v.\n\n 4   Salazar, 945 F.2d 47, 50-51 (2d Cir. 1991).\n\n 5          Under the totality of the circumstances approach to assessing probable cause and\n\n 6   reasonable suspicion mandated by Gates and White, informants do not all fall into neat\n\n 7   categories of known or anonymous. Instead, it is useful to think of known reliability and\n\n 8   corroboration as a sliding scale. Where the informant is known from past practice to be reliable,\n\n 9   as in Williams, no corroboration will be required to support reasonable suspicion. Where the\n\n10   informant is completely anonymous, as in White, a significant amount of corroboration will be\n\n11   required. However, when the informant is only partially known (i.e., her identity and reliability\n\n12   are not verified, but neither is she completely anonymous), a lesser degree of corroboration may\n\n13   be sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion. This approach is consistent with the totality of\n\n14   the circumstance inquiry mandated by Gates and White, as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\n15   characterization of Terry as providing an \u201cintermediate response\u201d for investigating criminal\n\n16   activity. Williams, 407 U.S. at 145.\n\n17\n\n\n18          C. Was Dorothy Mazza an Anonymous Informant?\n\n19          The question almost answers itself.\n\n20          The district court considered the question of Mazza\u2019s anonymity as a threshold inquiry\n\n21   and, finding that \u201cthe facts place the caller most appropriately in the category of anonymous\n\n22   informant,\u201d Elmore, 359 F. Supp. 2d at 114, went on to analyze reasonable suspicion under the\n     13\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   White/J.L. framework. While Mazza was unwilling to meet face-to-face and the police did not\n\n 2   definitively confirm her identity, neither was she completely anonymous like the informants in\n\n 3   White and J.L.\n\n 4          The government points to several cases where other circuits have found reasonable\n\n 5   suspicion based on tips from informants who gave their names or other identifying information,\n\n 6   but where the police did not meet them face-to-face or otherwise confirm their identities.\n\n 7   Despite the fact that their identities were not definitively confirmed, the Fourth, Ninth, and Tenth\n\n 8   Circuits did not treat the informants as anonymous and did not require the extensive degree of\n\n 9   corroboration needed to find reasonable suspicion under the White/J.L. framework.\n\n10          For example, in United States v. Terry-Crespo, 356 F.3d 1170, 1172 (9th Cir. 2004), an\n\n11   informant called 911 saying he had just been threatened with a handgun by a suspect whom he\n\n12   described. The caller gave his name, but not his location or contact information because he said\n\n13   he was calling from someone else\u2019s cell phone. Id. at 1172. The Ninth Circuit found that there\n\n14   was reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk the suspect because the caller was no longer\n\n15   anonymous once he had given his name, even though it was unconfirmed. Id. at 1174-75. The\n\n16   court also held that emergency calls should be treated as inherently more reliable than\n\n17   anonymous tips concerning general criminality. Id. at 1176.\n\n18          In United States v. Quarles, 330 F.3d 650, 652 (4th Cir. 2003), a 911 caller said that a\n\n19   man walking down a particular street had a gun in his bag. The caller gave his name and\n\n20   location and said that the suspect had killed his brother and there was a warrant out for his arrest.\n\n21   Id. He stayed on the phone until the police made the stop. Id. The Fourth Circuit held that even\n\n22   though the police did not confirm the caller\u2019s identity or corroborate his assertion about the\n     14\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   warrant until after the stop, there was reasonable suspicion because the caller gave enough\n\n 2   information to be identified later. Id. at 655.\n\n 3            In United States v. Harris, 313 F.3d 1228, 1231 (10th Cir. 2002), a Dairy Queen\n\n 4   employee called the sheriff\u2019s office, gave her name, and said that two men were smoking\n\n 5   marijuana in the parking lot. She called back a few minutes later to say that they were leaving\n\n 6   and heading towards a car wash. Id. The police made no attempt to confirm her identity. The\n\n 7   Tenth Circuit stated that the call was not anonymous and therefore could provide reasonable\n\n 8   suspicion for a Terry stop, even absent any significant corroboration.3 Id. at 1235-36.\n\n 9            Finally, in United States v. Browning, 252 F.3d 1153, 1155-56 (10th Cir. 2001), a woman\n\n10   called 911 and said that she had just been assaulted in a car. She described the car and her\n\n11   assailant and gave his name. Id. at 1156. She also gave her name and the location and phone\n\n12   number of the payphone from which she was calling. Id. The dispatcher called the payphone\n\n13   several times to get more information including the caller\u2019s date of birth, but the police made no\n\n14   attempt to verify her identity or corroborate any of the information she gave. Id. The Tenth\n\n15   Circuit found that there was reasonable suspicion for the police to pull over a car matching the\n\n16   description the caller gave. Id. at 1157.\n\n17            Like the informants in these cases, Mazza gave the police enough information about\n\n18   herself to allow them to identify her and track her down later to hold her accountable if her tip\n\n19   proved false. She gave them her name, her relationship with the defendant, and two phone\n\n20   numbers at which she could be contacted. Defendant argues that Terry-Crespo, Quarles, Harris,\n\n\n     3\n      An alternative basis for this holding was that upon approaching the defendants before a stop took place, the officer\n     smelled burnt marijuana . Ha rris, 313 F.3d at 1236.\n     15\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   and Browning are distinguishable because other factors, such as whether the call was made\n\n 2   contemporaneously with the criminal activity or whether the call was an emergency 911 call,\n\n 3   established reliability that is not present here. Yet Detective Roncinske went far beyond what\n\n 4   the police did in those cases in his attempt to confirm Mazza\u2019s identity. He confirmed from\n\n 5   DMV records that the name she gave belonged to a real person and learned her address and date\n\n 6   of birth. He confirmed that he could reach her at one of the phone numbers she gave him and\n\n 7   that she was willing to speak with him several times. He confirmed that she knew where Elmore\n\n 8   was wounded and the motive for the shooting. Although the injuries were reported, the motive\n\n 9   matched the police\u2019s theory, which was not publicly known. While she was unwilling to meet\n\n10   with Roncinske face-to-face, she had a good reason for her reluctance\u2014she was afraid the\n\n11   defendant would retaliate against her.\n\n12           It is unquestionable that Roncinske could have done more to confirm Mazza\u2019s identity.\n\n13   He could have quizzed her on her address or date of birth. He could have checked telephone\n\n14   records to see if the numbers she gave him were registered to Dorothy Mazza. He could have\n\n15   called the home telephone number that she gave him.4 These things he did not do. It is possible\n\n16   that someone could have pretended to be Dorothy Mazza and made the call, but that person\n\n17   would have had to do a fair amount of research and would expose herself to a real chance of\n\n18   being caught and punished. Reasonable suspicion is a question of probabilities, not possibilities.\n\n19   We have no trouble concluding that the district court erred by placing Mazza in the same\n\n20   category as the completely anonymous informants in J.L. and White.\n     4\n      The district court noted that Roncinske only contacted Mazza on the cell phone number she gave him and that\n     \u201csuch calls could be answered by anyone, anywhere in the United States that had cell phone service.\u201d Elmore, 359\n     F. Supp. 2d at 114 n.7 Presumably, by calling her home phone number, Roncinske could have at least associated her\n     with a specific location.\n     16\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1\n\n\n 2\n\n\n 3\n\n\n 4          D. Analysis Under the Totality of the Circumstances\n\n 5          Having determined that the district court erred by categorically treating Mazza as an\n\n 6   anonymous informant because the police did not definitively confirm her identity, we now\n\n 7   analyze whether the police had reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant under the totality of\n\n 8   the circumstances.\n\n 9          We note first that Mazza\u2019s basis of knowledge is well established. She told Roncinske\n\n10   that she knew that Elmore kept the Smith & Wesson revolver in his car because she had\n\n11   personally seen it there. She knew that he possessed the rest of the weapons because she had\n\n12   seen them at her residence and he told her where he subsequently kept them. Her status as an\n\n13   insider who would have access to that type of information is not in question. She told Roncinske\n\n14   that she had been Elmore\u2019s girlfriend and that he had lived with her. This is not a case like\n\n15   Draper or Spinelli where the police needed to infer that the informant was an insider from the\n\n16   detail and predictive information in the tip. Mazza told Roncinske exactly how she knew about\n\n17   Elmore\u2019s criminal activities.\n\n18          The only thing at issue is Mazza\u2019s veracity\u2014that is, whether she was telling the truth.\n\n19   Because the informant was not completely anonymous (though her identity was not confirmed to\n\n20   a certainty), we find it inappropriate to require the same level of corroboration that the Supreme\n\n21   Court required in White and J.L. Mazza was a citizen informant whose veracity is generally\n\n22   presumed. Her veracity is further bolstered because she gave the police enough information\n     17\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   about her identity (which was corroborated to some degree) that she should have reasonably\n\n 2   believed that the police could track her down and hold her accountable if her tip turned out to be\n\n 3   a malicious falsehood.\n\n 4          Although they were not able to corroborate the sort of predictive information that the\n\n 5   Supreme Court found compelling in White, the police did corroborate a significant portion of the\n\n 6   information in Mazza\u2019s tip. Roncinske confirmed that the Dwayne Sherman lived in Building 14\n\n 7   at 133 Monterey Place and that his car was parked outside. He also confirmed that Elmore and\n\n 8   Sherman had been accomplices in a previous criminal endeavor. Sergeant King and Officer\n\n 9   Suda confirmed that Elmore drove the black Acura that Mazza described in the area of Norwalk\n\n10   that she said he frequents.\n\n11          A tip from a citizen informant whose identity is disclosed (though not confirmed to a\n\n12   certainty) that is corroborated to a significant degree can support a finding of reasonable\n\n13   suspicion. We hold that, under the totality of the circumstances, Mazza\u2019s tip plus the\n\n14   corroboration from the police investigation were enough to give the police reasonable suspicion\n\n15   to stop Elmore. The evidence in Count Two should not have been suppressed.\n\n16\n\n\n17   II. The Search Warrant\n\n18          Defendant challenges the district court\u2019s decision on Count One not to suppress evidence\n\n19   found in Tanea Humphrey\u2019s apartment because the police relied in good faith on a warrant\n\n20   issued by a neutral magistrate. The government argues that the district court erred in even\n\n21   reaching this question because Elmore lacked Fourth Amendment \u201cstanding\u201d to challenge the\n\n\n     18\n\f     05-1734\n     USA v. Elmore\n 1   search warrant because he had no reasonable expectation of privacy in Humphrey\u2019s apartment or\n\n 2   the bags he stored there.\n\n 3          Because we find that the Terry stop was supported by reasonable suspicion, the evidence\n\n 4   seized from Elmore\u2019s car would not be excluded in considering whether the search warrant was\n\n 5   supported by probable cause. We find that Mazza\u2019s tip, corroborated by the weapon found in\n\n 6   Elmore\u2019s car and other police investigation, gives rise to probable cause to support the search\n\n 7   warrant. See, e.g., Gates, 462 U.S. at 243-44. Therefore we need not reach the questions of\n\n 8   whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the premises or containers\n\n 9   searched and whether the search fell under the good faith exception to the warrant requirement.\n\n10\n\n\n11                                              Conclusion\n\n12          The portion of the district court\u2019s order suppressing evidence found in Elmore\u2019s car is\n\n13   reversed. Count Two is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The\n\n14   portion of the district court\u2019s order on Count One denying the motion to suppress evidence found\n\n15   in Tanea Humphrey\u2019s apartment is affirmed because we find that the search warrant was\n\n16   supported by probable cause.\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n     19\n\f",
