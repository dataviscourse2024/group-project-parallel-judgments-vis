PRYCE, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.\n(APPEAL NO. 2.)\n\n\nLEANNE LAPP, PUBLIC DEFENDER, CANANDAIGUA, D.J. & J.A. CIRANDO, ESQS.,\nSYRACUSE (BRADLEY E. KEEM OF COUNSEL), FOR DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.\n\nR. MICHAEL TANTILLO, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, CANANDAIGUA (CHRIS EAGGLESTON\nOF COUNSEL), FOR RESPONDENT.\n\n\n     Appeal from a judgment of the Ontario County Court (William F.\nKocher, J.), rendered January 11, 2012. The judgment convicted\ndefendant, upon his plea of guilty, of attempted burglary in the\nsecond degree.\n\n     It is hereby ORDERED that the judgment so appealed from is\nunanimously affirmed.\n\n     Memorandum: On appeal from a judgment convicting him, upon his\nplea of guilty, of attempted burglary in the second degree (Penal Law\n\u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 140.25 [2]), we reject defendant\u2019s challenge to County\nCourt\u2019s acceptance of the guilty plea. Defendant\u2019s contention that\nhis plea was not knowingly, voluntarily, or intelligently entered\nbecause he did not personally recite the elements of the crime to\nwhich he pleaded guilty is actually a challenge to the factual\nsufficiency of the plea allocution, and that contention is not\npreserved for our review inasmuch as defendant did not move to\nwithdraw his plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction (see People\nv Loper, 118 AD3d 1394, 1395, lv denied 25 NY3d 1204; see also People\nv Rinker, 141 AD3d 1177, 1177, lv denied 28 NY3d 1030). Contrary to\ndefendant\u2019s contention, we conclude that this case does not fall\nwithin the narrow exception to the preservation requirement (see\nPeople v Bonacci, 119 AD3d 1348, 1349, lv denied 24 NY3d 1042; see\ngenerally People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 665, 666-667). In any event, the\ncourt was not required to have defendant personally recite the facts\nunderlying the crime during the plea colloquy where, as here, the\nrecord establishes that defendant confirmed the accuracy of the\ncourt\u2019s recitation of the facts underlying the crime (see People v\nGordon, 98 AD3d 1230, 1230, lv denied 20 NY3d 932). Moreover, the\nfact that defendant gave \u201c \u2018monosyllabic responses to [the court\u2019s]\nquestions did not render the plea invalid\u2019 \u201d (id. at 1230).\n\f                                 -2-                           250\n                                                         KA 14-00990\n\n     Defendant additionally contends that the court erred in imposing\nan enhanced sentence based on his failure to appear at sentencing\nwithout affording him an opportunity to withdraw his plea. That\ncontention is not preserved for our review inasmuch as defendant did\nnot object to the enhanced sentence, and he did not move to withdraw\nthe plea or to vacate the judgment of conviction on that ground (see\nPeople v Sprague, 82 AD3d 1649, 1649, lv denied 17 NY3d 801; see also\nPeople v Blake, 126 AD3d 1375, 1375-1376, lv denied 26 NY3d 1143). In\nany event, the record establishes that the court informed defendant\nduring the plea proceeding that it could and would impose an enhanced\nsentence in the event that he failed to appear at sentencing. Thus,\n\u201c[b]y failing to appear at the scheduled sentencing, defendant\nviolated the terms of the plea agreement[,] and the court was no\nlonger bound by the agreed-upon sentence\u201d (People v Goodman, 79 AD3d\n1285, 1286; see Blake, 126 AD3d at 1376).\n\n     We have considered defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of his\nsentence and conclude that it is without merit.\n\n\n\n\nEntered:   March 24, 2017                       Frances E.
