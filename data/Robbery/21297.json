On appeal, he argues that he was improperly subject to extended-term\n     sentencing under section 5-5-3.2(b)(1) of the Unified Code of Corrections (Code) (730 ILCS\n     5/5-5-3.2(b)(1) (West 2010)) based on a prior California conviction. Defendant also contends\n     that he is entitled to a $5-per-day credit against his fines for the time he spent in presentence\n     custody. We remand for a new sentencing hearing.\n\u00b62       Defendant was charged with aggravated domestic battery (720 ILCS 5/12-3.3(a-5) (West\n     2010)), domestic battery (720 ILCS 5/12-3.2(a)(1) (West 2010)) and interfering with reporting\n     of domestic violence (720 ILCS 5/12-6.3(a) (West 2010)). At a pretrial hearing, the State noted\n     that defendant was eligible for an extended-term sentence under section 5-5-3.2(b)(1) of the\n     Code (730 ILCS 5/5-5-3.2(b)(1) (West 2010)) based on a 2005 California conviction. Defense\n     counsel argued that he did not believe defendant was eligible for an extended term but was\n     unable to confirm his belief because he had not yet received a copy of the 2005 conviction.\n\u00b63       Defendant subsequently entered a guilty plea to the charge of aggravated domestic battery\n     in exchange for the State\u2019s agreement to drop the two remaining charges. Prior to entry of the\n     plea, the trial court questioned defendant to determine if his plea was voluntary and\n     admonished defendant pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402 (eff. July 1, 1997).\n     Because the parties disagreed as to whether defendant was eligible for an extended-term\n     sentence, the trial court admonished defendant under the assumption that defendant was\n     eligible for an extended term, telling defendant that he could be sentenced to a prison term of\n     up to 14 years. After admonishing defendant, the court found that the plea was knowing and\n     voluntary and ordered a presentencing investigation report (PSI).\n\u00b64       The PSI listed a number of prior convictions, including five felonies. Four of the felonies\n     occurred in California, and one was charged in Illinois. The State argued that defendant\u2019s 2005\n     California conviction for unlawful taking or driving of a vehicle under section 10851 of the\n     California Vehicle Code (Cal. Veh. Code \u00a7 10851 (West 2004)) made him eligible for an\n     extended-term sentence because the conviction was equivalent to a Class 2 felony offense of\n     possession of a stolen or converted vehicle under section 4-103 of the Illinois Vehicle Code\n     (625 ILCS 5/4-103 (West 2004)). The State submitted to the court a certified copy of\n     defendant\u2019s prior conviction, along with copies of section 10851 of the California Vehicle\n     Code and section 4-103 of the Illinois Vehicle Code. The order entered in the California\n     conviction provided that the maximum sentence for a section 10851 violation was three years\n     in prison, a $10,000 fine and four years of parole.\n\u00b65       The trial court found that defendant\u2019s prior conviction for unlawful taking or driving of a\n     vehicle was equivalent to the Illinois Class 2 felony of possession of a stolen vehicle because\n     the elements of the offenses were nearly identical. It then concluded that defendant was\n     eligible for an enhanced sentence and ordered him to serve an extended term of 12 years in\n     prison, with 4 years of mandatory supervised release. The court ordered restitution in the\n     agreed amount of $14,253.35, plus costs and fees, including a $5,000 fine. The sentencing\n     order also provided that defendant was entitled to credit for 108 days spent in custody prior to\n     sentencing.\n\u00b66       Defendant filed a postplea motion to reduce his sentence or, alternatively, to withdraw his\n     guilty plea. The trial court denied the motion.\n\n                                                 -2-\n\f\u00b67                                                ANALYSIS\n\u00b68                                                     I\n\u00b69          In sentencing defendant, the trial court relied on section 5-5-3.2(b)(1) of the sentencing\n       code. That section provides:\n                    \u201c(b) The following factors *** may be considered by the court as reasons to impose\n                an extended term sentence under Section 5-8-2 upon any offender:\n                        (1) When a defendant is convicted of any felony, after having been previously\n                    convicted in Illinois or any other jurisdiction of the same or similar class felony or\n                    greater class felony, when such conviction has occurred within 10 years after the\n                    previous conviction, excluding time spent in custody, and such charges are\n                    separately brought and tried and arise out of different series of acts[.]\u201d 730 ILCS\n                    5/5-5-3.2(b)(1) (West 2010).\n\u00b6 10        Defendant contends that his prior California conviction does not constitute the \u201csame or\n       similar class felony\u201d required to trigger application of section 5-5-3.2(b)(1) because \u201csimilar\n       class\u201d means comparing offenses by analyzing the sentencing ranges, not the elements of the\n       offense. Defendant argues that since the maximum sentence for the 2005 California conviction\n       was three years, it is not a \u201csimilar class felony\u201d when compared to a Class 2 felony in Illinois,\n       which carries a sentencing range of three to seven years. Whether the statutory reference to a\n       \u201csimilar class\u201d requires consideration of the offenses\u2019 sentencing ranges is a question of\n       statutory interpretation that we review de novo. See People v. Robinson, 172 Ill. 2d 452, 457\n       (1996).\n\u00b6 11        The prime consideration in construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the\n       legislative intent. People v. Jones, 223 Ill. 2d 569, 580 (2006). Where the statutory language is\n       clear and unambiguous, the statute must be given effect without resorting to extrinsic aids for\n       construction. Id. at 581. Where, however, the language is ambiguous and susceptible to more\n       than one reasonable interpretation, a court may look beyond the express words and consider\n       other interpretive tools to determine the statute\u2019s meaning. In re Antoine B., 2014 IL App (3d)\n       110467-B, \u00b6 6. In the event the legislature has provided reasonable definitions of terms within\n       the statute, such definitions should be maintained. People v. Harman, 125 Ill. App. 3d 338, 345\n       (1984). In construing the meaning of the words used in a particular statute, the court may\n       consider the reason for the law, problems sought to be remedied, purposes to be achieved, and\n       consequences of construing the statute one way or another. People v. Brown, 2013 IL 114196,\n       \u00b6 36. \u201cAn elementary canon of statutory construction teaches us that where the legislature uses\n       certain words in one instance, and different words in another, different results were intended.\u201d\n       Aurora Pizza Hut, Inc. v. Hayter, 79 Ill. App. 3d 1102, 1105-06 (1979); see also Condell\n       Hospital v. Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board, 124 Ill. 2d 341, 366 (1988) (the mention\n       of one thing implies the exclusion of the other).\n\u00b6 12        Section 5-5-3.2(b)(1) permits the trial court to impose an extended-term sentence when the\n       defendant has been convicted of a felony in any jurisdiction within the past ten years if the\n       prior conviction is for \u201cthe same or similar class felony or greater class felony.\u201d 730 ILCS\n       5/5-5-3.2(b)(1) (West 2010). \u201cSame or similar class\u201d is not defined in the statute. Although\n       Illinois has a distinct classification scheme, offenses in other states are classified differently or\n       not at all. Moreover, the relevant legislative history contains no mention of \u201cclass\u201d comparison\n\n\n                                                     -3-\n\f       between Illinois offenses and convictions in other jurisdictions. The State interprets the statute\n       as meaning the elements of the crime, which furthers the reasonable goal of uniformity.\n       Defendant believes that the statute means the measure of the range of the sentence, assuming a\n       different sentencing range is not a \u201csimilar\u201d class. Given that the language is open to more than\n       one reasonable interpretation, it is appropriate to look to extrinsic aids and tools of\n       interpretation to determine its meaning.\n\u00b6 13        Different extended-term sentencing provisions in the Code define exactly what standard to\n       apply; that is, the court should evaluate only the elements of the similar offense. Under section\n       5-4.5-95(b) of the Code, a defendant must be sentenced as a Class X felon if the defendant has\n       \u201cbeen twice convicted in any state or federal court of an offense that contains the same\n       elements as an offense now *** classified in Illinois as a Class 2 or greater Class felony.\u201d\n       (Emphasis added.) 730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-95(b) (West 2012). Under section 5-5-3(c)(2)(F) of the\n       Code, a defendant is subject to a mandatory sentence of imprisonment if he or she has been\n       convicted of \u201ca Class 2 or greater felony, including any state or federal conviction for an\n       offense that contained, at the time it was committed, the same elements as an offense now\n       classified *** as a Class 2 or greater felony.\u201d 730 ILCS 5/5-5-3(c)(2)(F) (West 2012). When\n       the legislature decides to authorize certain sentencing enhancement provisions in some cases,\n       while declining to impose similar limits in other provisions within the same sentencing code, it\n       indicates that different results were intended. See Condell Hospital, 124 Ill. 2d at 366. When\n       the legislature intends to limit sentencing considerations to an analysis of only the elements of\n       an offense, it will expressly do so. Section 5-5-3.2(b)(1) of the Code does not limit the courts\u2019\n       consideration to the elements of the offense. Thus, consideration of the elements, while\n       appropriate, is not the only mode of analysis.\n\u00b6 14        After reviewing the statute and applying the rules of statutory construction, we believe the\n       legislative intent was to consider both the sentencing range and the elements in determining\n       whether a conviction in another jurisdiction is of \u201cthe same or similar class felony.\u201d In making\n       a section 5-5-3.2(b)(1) determination, a comparison should also include the sentencing range\n       of the prior conviction with the sentencing range of an equivalent Illinois offense. Illinois\n       utilizes a distinct and comprehensive scheme of classification of felonies in that all felony\n       offenses in the same class have the same sentencing range. Thus, an implicit factor in\n       determining whether an offense is a similar class offense is a comparison of the sentencing\n       ranges that apply.\n\u00b6 15        Moreover, Illinois courts have upheld the imposition of extended-term sentences where the\n       trial court has found that the prior out-of-state conviction constituted the same or similar class\n       felony based on a comparison of sentencing ranges. See People v. Cavins, 288 Ill. App. 3d 173,\n       184-85 (1997) (appellate court affirmed trial court\u2019s finding that Iowa kidnapping charge,\n       which carries an indeterminate sentence of not more than 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, was a\n       similar class felony to a Class 2 felony in Illinois); People v. Daniels, 194 Ill. App. 3d 648, 652\n       (1990) (appellate court noted that defendant\u2019s prior Mississippi burglary, which carried a\n       possible penalty ranging from 5 to 40 years, qualified as \u201ca Class 2 felony or greater\u201d under\n       section 5-5-3(c)(2)(F)). Thus, in using the term \u201csame or similar class felony,\u201d trial courts\n       should consider both the sentencing range and the elements of the offense in determining\n       whether the defendant is eligible for an extended-term sentence under section 5-5-3.2(b)(1).\n\u00b6 16        Here, the record demonstrates that the trial court considered only the elements of the\n       offense and did not compare the California offense to the equivalent Illinois Class 2 offense in\n\n                                                    -4-\n\f       light of the different sentencing range. We therefore remand the cause to the trial court for a\n       new sentencing hearing in order to compare the sentencing ranges, as well as the elements of\n       the offenses, to determine whether the California conviction is the \u201csame or similar class\n       felony\u201d to the Class 2 offense for which defendant was sentenced.\n\n\u00b6 17                                                  II\n\u00b6 18       Defendant argues that he is entitled to a $5-per-day credit for each of the 108 days he spent\n       in presentence custody, for a total of $540. The State agrees.\n\u00b6 19       An incarcerated person against whom a fine is levied is entitled to a credit of $5 per day for\n       every day served in custody prior to sentencing. 725 ILCS 5/110-14(a) (West 2010). The right\n       to receive the statutorily mandated credit \u201cis not waived despite any failure to raise the \u2018issue\u2019\n       at the trial level\u201d and \u201cis cognizable on appeal as a matter of course subject to a defendant\u2019s\n       application for it.\u201d People v. Woodard, 175 Ill. 2d 435, 456-57 (1997).\n\u00b6 20       The trial court noted in the sentencing order that defendant served 108 days in presentence\n       custody. The order also indicates that defendant was assessed a $5,000 fine. However, the\n       order does not show that defendant received a $5-per-day credit against that fine. On remand,\n       defendant is entitled to receive a $540 credit against any assessed fines.\n\n\u00b6 21                                        CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 22      The judgment of the circuit court of Tazewell County is reversed and remanded for further\n       proceedings.\n\n\u00b6 23      Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   -5-\n\f",
