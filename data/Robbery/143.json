The State concedes that even with bump-ups for violation of community control, appellant\u2019s sentence in that case exceeded the maximum permitted by statute. See Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.701(d)(10) (1991). Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sentence in Case No. 91-16683 is reversed and remanded for resentencing.\nFULMER and NORTHCUTT, JJ., concur.\n",
