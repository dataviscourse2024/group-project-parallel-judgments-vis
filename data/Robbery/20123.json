Lochridge noted the man\u2019s face, specifically his \u201cprotruding eyes.\u201d \u00a0Lochridge grabbed the barrel of the gun, pushed it out of the car window, and drove away. \n\nTwo days after the robbery, a detective showed Lochridge a photospread. Lochridge did not positively identify Davis as the robber, but he circled Davis\u2019s photo as the \u201cmost familiar looking person\u201d in the photospread \u201cbecause of his eyes.\u201d \u00a0The police were able to match Davis\u2019s thumb and palm prints to those found on Lochridge\u2019s car. \u00a0\n\nAt a pretrial hearing, Lochridge was unable to positively identify Davis as the robber. \u00a0When Lochridge was testifying in front of the jury the next day, however, he positively identified Davis as the robber. \n\nTwo days before the attempted robbery of Lochridge, both Brian Hodges and Doug Ketcham were robbed while using ATM machines during two different incidents. \u00a0Four days later, each identified Davis from a photographic array as the person who had robbed them. \u00a0During the punishment phase of the trial, the State offered evidence of Hodges\u2019s and Ketcham\u2019s pretrial identifications of Davis as the person who had robbed them. \n\nIII. \u00a0\nPretrial Identification\n\nIn his sole point, Davis complains that the in-court identification evidence of him by the three witnesses should have been suppressed because their \u00a0ability to make an accurate identification was tainted, which violated his due process rights. \u00a0Davis argues that this taint was the result of impermissibly suggestive out-of-court identification procedures that created a substantial likelihood of mistaken identification. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn considering the scope of due process rights afforded a defendant with regard to the admission of identification evidence, the court of criminal appeals \u00a0has held that a pretrial identification procedure may be so suggestive and conducive to mistaken identification that subsequent use of that identification at trial would deny the accused due process of law. \u00a0\nWebb v. State\n, 760 S.W.2d 263, 269 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988), \ncert. denied\n, 491 U.S. 910 (1989). \u00a0Hence, the court has formulated a two-step analysis to determine the admissibility of an in-court identification: (1) whether the out-of-court identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive, and (2) whether that suggestive procedure gave rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. \u00a0\nCantu v. State\n, 738 S.W.2d 249, 251 (Tex. Crim. App.), \ncert. denied\n, 484 U.S. 872 (1987). \u00a0An analysis under these steps requires an examination of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d surrounding the particular case and a determination of the reliability of the identification. \u00a0\nId\n. \u00a0The appellant bears the burden to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the out-of-court identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive and that the suggestive procedure gave rise to a very substantial likelihood of misidentification. \u00a0\nBarley v. State\n, 906 S.W.2d 27, 32-33 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995), \ncert. denied\n, 516 U.S. 1176 (1996). \u00a0A criminal defendant who contends on appeal that the trial court erred by allowing in-court identification of him by a witness has a heavy burden to sustain. \u00a0\nJackson v. State\n, 628 S.W.2d 446, 448 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1982).\n\nTurning to the first step of the analysis, suggestiveness may be created by the manner in which the pretrial identification procedure is conducted, for example, by police pointing out the suspect or suggesting that a suspect is included in the line-up or photo array. \u00a0\nBarley\n, 906 S.W.2d at 33\n.\n \u00a0It may also be created by the content of the line-up or photo array itself if the suspect is the only individual closely resembling the pre-procedure description. \u00a0\nId.\n\t\nA. \u00a0Witness Identification at Guilt/Innocence Phase of Trial\n\nLochridge gave the police a description of the robber, mentioning that the robber had bulging eyes and was wearing a hooded jacket. \u00a0Two days after the robbery, Detective Jim Ford contacted Lochridge and arranged a meeting because Detective Ford had some photographs for Lochridge to view. \u00a0Detective Ford did not tell Lochridge that the police had a suspect in mind. \u00a0At the meeting, Detective Ford handed Lochridge a set of six photographs and asked Lochridge to look at them and to determine if he recognized anyone. \u00a0The detective told Lochridge that the suspect may or may not be among the photographs. \u00a0Detective Ford gave Lochridge no further instructions and made no verbal or nonverbal suggestions. Lochridge stated that he felt no compulsion to select a particular photograph. After reviewing the photographs, Lochridge stated that the photograph of Davis looked like the robber, but that he could not be absolutely positive. Detective Ford did not confirm or comment on Lochridge\u2019s choice. \u00a0During the guilt/innocence phase of the trial, the State admitted evidence of Lochridge\u2019s pretrial identification of Davis as the person who robbed him. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nInitially, Davis argues that the identification was tainted because Detective Ford did not follow the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s guidelines that recommend a double-blind presentation of the lineup and a sequential presentation of the photographs. \u00a0However, as the State points out, Davis presents no authority showing that such techniques are required, not merely suggestions. \u00a0\nThis contention is simply inadequately briefed and consequently presents nothing for our review. \u00a0\nSee\n \nTex. R. App. P. \n38.1(h); \nLong v. State\n, 137 S.W.3d 726, 737 (Tex. App.\u2014Waco 2004, pet. ref\u2019d).\n\nSecondly\n, \nDavis argues that there were three significant differences in the individual photographs that added to the photospread\u2019s suggestibility. \u00a0Davis points to (1) the difference in the skin tones of the individuals depicted, (2) the fact that his face appears larger than any of the other men\u2019s faces in the array, and (3) the different colored background in his and one other individual\u2019s photograph. \u00a0He argues that these differences added to the suggestability of the photospread and caused Lochridge to be drawn to his photograph. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe record contains a copy of State\u2019s Exhibit 1 (the photographic array), and although the reproduction is of poor quality, it is nonetheless undermines Davis\u2019s contentions. \u00a0The photographs appear similar enough to provide a reasonable test for Lochridge to reliably identify the robber. \u00a0\nSee Ford v. State\n, 794 S.W.2d 863, 866 (Tex. App.\u2014El Paso 1990, pet. ref\u2019d).\n \u00a0The photographs of Davis and of the others in the array reflect great similarity in size and facial features. \u00a0In addition, all six men are African-American. \u00a0Viewing each photograph separately, we conclude that Davis has not demonstrated an impermissibly suggestive array. \u00a0We hold that the differences are less than suggestive. \u00a0\nSee\n \nid. \n(holding appellant did not demonstrate impermissibly suggestive array when some subjects in photographic array had longer hair than others in array). \u00a0\n\nAdditionally, the testimony was consistent that the detective at no time indicated that a suspect was included in the photographic array or suggested which individual to choose. \u00a0\nSee\n \nHerrera v. State\n, 682 S.W.2d 313, 318-19 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984), \ncert. denied\n, 471 U.S. 1131 (1985). \u00a0We hold that neither the manner in which the pretrial identification procedure was conducted, nor the content of the photo array itself, was suggestive. \u00a0\nSee Barley\n, 906 S.W.2d at 33-34 (holding photo array not suggestive when array consisted of photos of six black males of similar features and similar heights and officer at no time indicated suspect was included in array or suggested which individual to choose).\n\nB. \u00a0Witness Identification at Punishment Phase of Trial\n\nHodges and Ketcham were each robbed while using ATM machines just two days before Lochridge was robbed. \u00a0During the punishment phase of the trial, the State introduced evidence of Hodges\u2019s and Ketcham\u2019s identifications of Davis as the actor who robbed them. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBoth Hodges and Ketcham gave the police descriptions of the robber, including height and weight estimates as well as descriptions of the robber\u2019s clothing. \u00a0Four days after the robberies, Detective Manny Reyes and Detective David Sears separately showed Hodges and Ketcham the same photographic array. \u00a0Neither detective suggested that the suspect was included in the array. \u00a0And neither Hodges nor Ketcham felt compelled to choose a photo from the line-up. \n\nWhen shown the array, Ketcham immediately identified Davis as the person who robbed him. \u00a0Hodges also identified Davis as the person who robbed him but stated that the person in the picture looked heavier than the person who had robbed him. \u00a0However, he stated that he was ninety-nine percent certain that the individual he selected was the man who had robbed him. \u00a0Shortly thereafter, Detective Reyes showed Hodges the array with a recent photograph of Davis. \u00a0Hodges immediately identified Davis as the robber.\n\nDavis argues that these photospreads also were tainted because the detectives did not follow the recommendations of the U.S. Department of Justice when they obtained Hodges\u2019s and Ketcham\u2019s photographic identifications. \u00a0But again, Davis presents no authority that such techniques are more than guidelines or that the failure to follow them automatically taints a photospread. \u00a0\nConsequently, this argument is inadequately briefed and presents nothing for our review. \u00a0\nSee\n \nTex. R. App. P. \n38.1(h); \nLong, \n137 S.W.3d at 737.\n\nDavis also argues that the content of the photospread itself tainted the identifications because there were two significant differences in the individuals\u2019 photos that added to the suggestability of the identification. \u00a0Davis claims that his skin tone appears darker and his head appears larger than the other individuals in the photospread. \u00a0He contends that these differences caused Hodges and Ketcham to be drawn to his photo and added to the suggestability of the photospread. \n\nThe record contains a copy of State\u2019s Exhibit 3 (the photographic array), and although this reproduction is also of poor quality, it is nonetheless adequate to disprove Davis\u2019s contentions. \u00a0The similarities in appearance are adequate to provide a reasonable test for Hodges and Ketcham to reliably identify the robber. \u00a0\nSee Ford, \n794 S.W.2d at 866. \u00a0Like the photographic array shown to Lochridge, the photographs of Davis and the others in this photographic line-up reflect great similarity. \u00a0All six men are African-American and of similar size, build, and hair color. \u00a0Viewing each photograph separately, we conclude that Davis has not demonstrated an impermissibly suggestive array. \u00a0We hold that the differences are less than suggestive. \u00a0\nId. \n \n\nAnd finally, Davis argues that Hodges\u2019s viewing of the two photospreads tainted the identification because there was no way to discern whether Hodges \u00a0identified Davis because he believed that Davis was the person who robbed him or because Davis\u2019s photograph was familiar to him due to its presence in the prior photospread. \u00a0However at trial, Hodges testified that he recognized Davis from the second photospread based on his memory from the robbery and not on his previous observation of the first photospread. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe hold that neither the manner in which the pretrial identification procedures were conducted nor the content of the photo arrays themselves \u00a0was suggestive. \u00a0\nSee Herrera, \n682 S.W.2d at 318-19; \nWilliams v. State, \n675 S.W.2d 754, 757 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984). \u00a0\n\nBecause we hold that Davis has failed to show that any of the out-of-court identifications were impermissibly suggestive, we need not address Davis\u2019s contention that the pretrial procedures resulted in a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. \n See Williams, \n675 S.W.2d at 757. \n We overrule his sole point.\n\nIV. \u00a0\nConclusion\n\nHaving overruled Davis\u2019s sole point, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n\nSUE WALKER\n\nJUSTICE\n\n\n\nPANEL A:\tCAYCE, C.J.; GARDNER and WALKER, JJ.\n\n\n\nDO NOT PUBLISH\n\nTex.
