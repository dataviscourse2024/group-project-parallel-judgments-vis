            "opinion_text": "        SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK\n           Appellate Division, Fourth Judicial Department\n\n863\nKA 10-01429\nPRESENT: WHALEN, P.J., SMITH, LINDLEY, TROUTMAN, AND SCUDDER, JJ.\n\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, RESPONDENT,\n\n                    V                              MEMORANDUM AND ORDER\n\nKEITH BRYANT, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.\n(APPEAL NO. 1.)\n\n\nCHARLES T. NOCE, CONFLICT DEFENDER, ROCHESTER (KATHLEEN P. REARDON OF\nCOUNSEL), FOR DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.\n\nSANDRA DOORLEY, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ROCHESTER (ROBERT J. SHOEMAKER OF\nCOUNSEL), FOR RESPONDENT.\n\n\n     Appeal from a judgment of the Monroe County Court (Robert B.\nWiggins, A.J.), rendered May 3, 2010. The judgment convicted\ndefendant, upon a jury verdict, of burglary in the third degree, petit\nlarceny and criminal mischief in the third degree.\n\n     It is hereby ORDERED that the judgment so appealed from is\nunanimously affirmed.\n\n     Memorandum: In appeal No. 1, defendant appeals from a judgment\nconvicting him following a jury trial of, inter alia, burglary in the\nthird degree (Penal Law \u00a7 140.20). Contrary to defendant\u2019s\ncontention, the verdict is not against the weight of the evidence. An\neyewitness testified that he observed a man fitting defendant\u2019s\ngeneral description leave a children\u2019s clothing store after 9:00 p.m.\nthrough the broken front door, carrying several coats. Shortly\nthereafter, the police received a tip from an identified informant\nthat a man was selling children\u2019s coats at a \u201cdrug house\u201d\napproximately one block from the store and, when the police arrived at\nthat location, they found defendant in a room with several children\u2019s\ncoats with tags from the store. The store owner testified that she\nasked the police if she could speak to the suspect seated in the\npatrol car and, when she did so, the person apologized to her. Thus,\nviewing the evidence in light of the elements of the crime as charged\nto the jury (see People v Danielson, 9 NY3d 342, 349), we conclude\nthat a different verdict would have been unreasonable and thus that\nthe verdict is not against the weight of the evidence (see generally\nPeople v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495).\n\n     Contrary to defendant\u2019s further contention, County Court properly\nrefused to suppress the statement defendant made to the owner of the\nstore based on the People\u2019s failure to provide a CPL 710.30 notice\n\f                                 -2-                           863\n                                                         KA 10-01429\n\nwith respect to that statement. The store owner was not acting as an\nagent of the police and therefore no notice pursuant to CPL 710.30 was\nrequired (see People v Jones, 292 AD2d 792, 792, lv denied 98 NY2d\n652; see generally People v Ray, 65 NY2d 282, 286). The court also\nproperly denied defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict pursuant\nto CPL 330.30 on the ground that the court erred in admitting that\nstatement. \u201cIt is well settled that \u2018[t]he basis for vacating a jury\nverdict prior to sentencing is strictly circumscribed by CPL 330.30 to\nallow vacatur only if reversal would have been mandated on appeal as a\nmatter of law\u2019 \u201d (People v Shelton, 111 AD3d 1334, 1334, lv denied 23\nNY3d 1025), and that is not the case here.\n\n     Although the People correctly concede that the police were\nrequired to retain the stolen coats until they had given notice to\ndefendant that the coats were being returned to the store owner and\nhad afforded him an opportunity to examine, test or photograph them\n(see Penal Law \u00a7 450.10 [1], [2]), we reject defendant\u2019s contention\nthat the court abused its discretion in refusing to dismiss the\nindictment or preclude any evidence regarding the coats. It is well\nestablished that the determination of a sanction for a violation of\nsection 450.10 is left to the sound discretion of the court (see\nPeople v Riley, 19 NY3d 944, 946, adhered to on rearg 20 NY3d 980;\nPeople v Kelly, 62 NY2d 516, 520-521), and that those sanctions are\nnot to be used \u201cif less severe measures can rectify the harm done\u201d by\nthe failure of the police to retain the evidence (Kelly, 62 NY2d at\n521; see People v Jenkins, 98 NY2d 280, 284). Inasmuch as the court\ndetermined that there was no bad faith on the part of the police in\nreturning the coats to the store owner and defense counsel argued that\nthere was no forensic evidence connecting defendant to the crime, the\ncourt\u2019s determination to instruct the jury to infer that there was no\nfingerprint or DNA evidence on the coats or the hangers was\nappropriate (see People v Perkins, 56 AD3d 944, 945-946, lv denied 12\nNY3d 786; see generally People v McCall, 289 AD2d 1074, 1074, lv\ndenied 97 NY2d 757). Defendant\u2019s contention that there may have been\nevidence that exonerated him is entirely speculative. The store owner\ntestified that she did not observe any blood on the coats, and an\nevidence technician testified that fingerprints could not be obtained\nfrom fabric and that it was unlikely that a clear print could be\nobtained from the hangers based upon their shape and the number of\npeople who would have handled them.\n\n     Even assuming, arguendo, that the court erred in admitting in\nevidence a security video of poor quality that depicted a man walking\nnear the store, we conclude that any error is harmless. The evidence\nof defendant\u2019s guilt is overwhelming, and there is no reasonable\nprobability that defendant would have been acquitted if that evidence\nwas not admitted (see generally People v Crimmins, 36 NY2d 230, 241-\n242). Defendant failed to preserve for our review his contention that\nthe court erred in permitting a police investigator to testify with\nrespect to the contents of the video (see CPL 470.05 [2]), and we\ndecline to exercise our power to review the contention as a matter of\ndiscretion in the interest of justice (see CPL 470.15 [6] [a]).\n\n     Finally, as defendant correctly concedes, reversal of the\n\f                                 -3-                           863\n                                                         KA 10-01429\n\njudgment in appeal No. 2, convicting him upon his plea of guilty of\ngrand larceny in the fourth degree (Penal Law \u00a7 155.30 [1]), is\nwarranted only in the event that the judgment in appeal No. 1 is\nreversed (see People v Monroe, 39 AD3d 1276, 1277, lv denied 9 NY3d\n867; see generally People v Pichardo, 1 NY3d 126, 129), and here we\nare affirming the judgment in appeal No. 1.\n\n\n\n\nEntered:   November 10, 2016                   Frances E.
