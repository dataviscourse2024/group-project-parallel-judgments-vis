The defendant pleaded guilty to attempted having weapons while under disability with a one-year firearm specification. The trial court sentenced her to one year in prison on the firearm specification and two years of community control on the underlying felony. The state appealed, arguing that the trial court was required to impose a mandatory prison term on the underlying felony as a result of the specification, that community control was not an authorized sentence and that the sentence violated the split-sentence doctrine. The plain and unambiguous language of R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) requires that a trial court, when crafting a sentence for a felony (other than a violation of R.C. 2923.12) that is enhanced with a firearm specification, impose the definite prison term prescribed by R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(a) as a mandatory prison term. The statute does not require the imposition of a mandatory prison term with respect to the felony underlying the firearm specification. Where a trial court is not required to impose a prison sentence on an underlying felony, as here, a trial court may impose community-control sanctions on the underlying felony even where prison is mandatory for the accompanying specification. This does not constitute an unlawful \"split sentence\" because a specification is not part of the underlying offense but merely a sentencing enhancement to that offense. As the trial court was not required to impose a prison term, mandatory prison term or term of life imprisonment on the defendant on the underlying felony here, R.C. 2929.15(A)(1) authorized the court to impose community-control sanctions on that offense. Sentence affirmed.",

GALLAGHER, J.:\n\nIntroduction\n\n                 Jadyn Logan pleaded guilty to attempted having weapons while under\n\ndisability, a fourth-degree felony.             The charge carried a one-year firearm\n\fspecification, to which Logan also pleaded guilty. The trial court sentenced Logan\n\nto a mandatory prison term of one year, attributed to the firearm specification, to be\n\nfollowed by a two-year term of community control for the underlying felony. The\n\nstate appealed that sentence and argued that the trial court was required to impose\n\na mandatory prison term on both the underlying felony and the specification.\n\n             The state made three arguments:         first, that R.C. 2929.13(F)(8)\n\nrequires the imposition of a mandatory prison term on an underlying felony when\n\nthe felony carries a corresponding firearm specification; second, that community\n\ncontrol is not an authorized sentence on an underlying felony under R.C.\n\n2929.15(A)(1) when the felony carries a firearm specification that requires\n\nimprisonment and third, that the imposition of a term of community control on an\n\nunderlying felony consecutive to a prison term imposed on a corresponding\n\nspecification is an improper split sentence.\n\n             A panel of this court rejected these arguments and affirmed Logan\u2019s\n\nsentence in State v. Logan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 111533, 2023-Ohio-1135. In\n\ndoing so, a majority of the panel concluded that its resolution of the state\u2019s first\n\nargument \u2014 holding that R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) does not preclude community control\n\non an underlying felony where the defendant pleaded guilty to a firearm\n\nspecification \u2014 conflicted with the holding of a previous decision of this court and\n\na statement this court made in another decision. See Logan at \u00b6 32\u201335, 55.\n\f              After the panel decision was journalized, the state requested en banc\n\nconsideration.1 Logan did not oppose the request.\n\n              The en banc court reviewed the identified conflict and, pursuant to\n\nApp.R. 26(A)(2), Loc.App.R. 26 and McFadden v. Cleveland State Univ., 120 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 54, 2008-Ohio-4914, 896 N.E.2d 672, determined that a conflict exists\n\nrequiring en banc consideration. Specifically, the court found that a conflict exists\n\nbetween the panel\u2019s opinion in Logan and two previous opinions of the court \u2014 State\n\nv. Sharpley, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106616, 2018-Ohio-4326, and State v. Galvan,\n\n8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108658, 2020-Ohio-1285 \u2014 and that consideration en banc\n\nis necessary to establish uniformity of decisions within the district on an issue that\n\nis dispositive in this case.\n\n              The opinions conflict on the following dispositive question of law:\n\n       Does R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) require a mandatory prison term and preclude\n       the imposition of community control sanctions on an underlying felony\n       when a defendant is found guilty on a corresponding firearm\n       specification?\n\n              This opinion is divided into two parts: (1) the decision of the en banc\n\ncourt and (2) the decision of the merit panel. The decision of the en banc court is\n\nlimited to an analysis and resolution of the question identified above. The decision\n\nof the merit panel reissues the original panel decision on the state\u2019s second and third\n\narguments which are outside the scope of this en banc review.\n\n\n       1 The state requested that the en banc court resolve \u201cwhether R.C. 2929.13(F)(8)\n\nrequires a mandatory prison term, precluding community control, on an underlying\nfelony when the defendant pleaded guilty to a corresponding firearm specification.\u201d\n\fEn Banc Decision\n\n               After careful consideration of the detailed briefing and en banc\n\nargument presented by the parties on this question before rendering this opinion\n\nand for the reasons that follow, we answer the conflict question in the negative.\n\nWhen a trial court crafts a sentence for a felony that carries a firearm specification,\n\nR.C. 2929.13(F)(8) requires the court to impose the definite prison term prescribed\n\nby R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(a) as a mandatory prison term with respect to the\n\nspecification; it does not also require the court to impose a mandatory prison term\n\nwith respect to the underlying felony.\n\n   I.      The Statute\n\n               R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) states in relevant part:\n\n        [T]he court shall impose a prison term * * * for any of the following\n        offenses:\n\n        Any offense, other than [carrying concealed weapons], that is a felony,\n        if the offender had a firearm on or about the offender\u2019s person or under\n        the offender\u2019s control while committing the felony, with respect to a\n        portion of the sentence imposed pursuant to division (B)(1)(a) of\n        section 2929.14 of the Revised Code for having a firearm.\n\n                The state reads this statute to require that a mandatory prison term\n\nbe imposed on an offender for an underlying felony when the offender is found guilty\n\nof an accompanying firearm specification. Logan argues that the statute only\n\nrequires a mandatory prison term on the portion of the sentence imposed for the\n\nfirearm specification.\n\f   II.    Relevant Decisions From This District\n\n               Logan directed the merit panel to three cases from this court that she\n\nsaid are in conflict with each other on whether community control is authorized for\n\nan underlying felony when a specification requires the imposition of a mandatory\n\nprison term: State v. Moore, State v. Sharpley and State v. Galvan. The cases are\n\nnot in direct conflict.\n\n               In Moore, this court considered a defendant\u2019s argument that the trial\n\ncourt had failed to conduct an adequate Crim.R. 11(C) plea colloquy before the\n\ndefendant entered his guilty plea to a charge of attempted felonious assault with a\n\nthree-year firearm specification. State v. Moore, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101658,\n\n2015-Ohio-1026, \u00b6 1. The defendant argued, among other things, that the trial court\n\nfailed to inform him that he was not eligible for community-control on the\n\nunderlying felony. This court found that the trial court substantially complied with\n\nCrim.R. 11(C)(2) when it \u201ctold [the defendant] that he was ineligible for \u2018probation\u2019\n\nwith respect to a portion of his sentence [for the firearm specification], but eligible\n\nwith respect to the underlying offense.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 16. This court held that this\n\ninformation \u201ccan be described only as reasonably intelligible because [the\n\ndefendant] expressed no confusion.\u201d Id. Because the trial court had sentenced the\n\ndefendant to one year in prison on the underlying offense, id. at \u00b6 4, this court did\n\nnot have occasion to consider the issue presented by this appeal. This court found\n\nsubstantial compliance with Crim.R. 11(C) under similar circumstances in State v.\n\nTaylor, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101609, 2015-Ohio-1643 (defendant argued that the\n\ftrial court should have advised him that he was ineligible for community control in\n\nlight of a firearm specification and the trial court had sentenced the defendant to\n\nprison on the underlying felony). The reasoning of Moore implies support for\n\nLogan\u2019s position. See Moore at \u00b6 14 (applying emphasis to portions of R.C. 2929.13\n\nthat suggests a trial court has discretion to sentence an offender to community\n\ncontrol except \u201cwith respect to a portion of the sentence imposed pursuant to [a\n\nfirearm specification]\u201d).\n\n              In Sharpley, this court considered a similar fact pattern. State v.\n\nSharpley, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106616, 2018-Ohio-4326. The defendant pleaded\n\nguilty to an underlying felony and a firearm specification and the trial court imposed\n\nprison sentences for both the felony and the firearm specification. Id. at \u00b6 4, 18. The\n\ndefendant argued on appeal that his guilty plea was induced by the false promise\n\nthat he would receive a one-year sentence of imprisonment. Id. at \u00b6 5. The trial\n\ncourt had advised the defendant during the plea colloquy that he \u201cfaced a mandatory\n\none-year term for the one-year firearm specification, and that the [underlying\n\nfelony] robbery offense carried the presumption of imprisonment but community\n\ncontrol was also possible.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 13. As in Moore, this court concluded that the\n\ntrial court substantially complied with its duties under Crim.R. 11(C) in the colloquy.\n\nId. Therefore, the holdings of Moore and Sharpley are not in conflict with each\n\nother.\n\n               The second issue presented in Sharpley, though, is directly applicable\n\nto the question presented by this appeal. The defendant in Sharpley argued on\n\fappeal that he should have been sentenced to community control on the underlying\n\nfelony. This court held that the defendant was not eligible for community control\n\non the underlying felony by application of R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) because he had\n\npleaded guilty to a firearm specification that required imprisonment. Id. at \u00b6 17. We\n\nnote, however, that neither party in Sharpley raised R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) or argued\n\nthat the defendant was ineligible for community control in their briefing. So, while\n\nSharpley\u2019s holding is directly applicable to the matter at hand, we are mindful that\n\nthe Sharpley panel did not benefit from the extensive briefing that is now before this\n\ncourt on the application of R.C. 2929.13(F)(8).\n\n               In Galvan, a panel of this court again considered a challenge to a trial\n\ncourt\u2019s Crim.R. 11(C) plea colloquy. State v. Galvan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.\n\n108658, 2020-Ohio-1285. The defendant argued that the trial court should have\n\ninformed him that he was not eligible for judicial release. Id. at \u00b6 10. This court held\n\nthat the trial court did not violate Crim.R. 11 when it did not discuss judicial release\n\nat the plea hearing; the panel reasoned that judicial release was not part of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s plea. Id. at \u00b6 18. The defendant also challenged his plea based on his\n\ncounsel\u2019s statements at the sentencing hearing that suggested his counsel believed\n\njudicial release was possible. Id. at \u00b6 19. In agreeing with the parties that defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s statements were inaccurate, this court stated that \u201c[u]nder R.C.\n\n2929.13(F)(8), the aggravated robbery conviction requires a mandatory prison term\n\nwhere, as here, the defendant had a firearm on his person while committing the\n\nfelony. * * * A mandatory sentence renders a defendant ineligible for judicial release.\n\fTherefore, [the defendant\u2019s] sentence was mandatory, and he was not eligible for\n\njudicial release.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. at \u00b6 20\u201321. This court upheld the plea\n\nbecause the defense counsel\u2019s \u201cerroneous statements\u201d about judicial release were\n\nmade at sentencing, not at the defendant\u2019s plea hearing. Id. at \u00b6 22. Notably,\n\nwhether the defendant was eligible for judicial release was not at issue in Galvan;\n\nthe parties agreed with each other that he was not. Moreover, neither party in\n\nGalvan cited or discussed Moore, Sharpley or R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) in their briefing.\n\nTherefore, while the panel\u2019s discussion of R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) in Galvan supported\n\nthe state\u2019s position in this appeal, the Galvan Court did not have the opportunity to\n\nconsider the issue presented by this appeal because of the parties\u2019 positions and the\n\nprocedural posture of the case.\n\n              These three opinions are not in conflict. The reasoning of Moore\n\nsuggests a disagreement with the Sharpley holding and Galvan\u2019s statement about\n\nthe effect of R.C. 2929.13(F)(8), but the court in Moore did not consider whether a\n\ntrial court can sentence a defendant to community control on an underlying felony\n\nwhere the defendant is subject to a mandatory prison term for a firearm\n\nspecification. The actual holdings of Moore and Galvan \u2014 regarding whether a trial\n\ncourt substantially complies with Crim.R. 11 when it does not inform the defendant\n\nthat the defendant is not eligible for judicial release during a plea colloquy \u2014 are\n\nfully consistent with Sharpley\u2019s holding on that issue.\n\n              Therefore, the state of the law in this district prior to the merit panel\u2019s\n\nopinion in Logan was that a defendant is not eligible for community control on an\n\funderlying felony by application of R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) where the defendant pleaded\n\nguilty to a firearm specification that requires imprisonment. Sharpley at \u00b6 17; cf.\n\nGalvan at \u00b6 20\u201321.\n\n               The merit panel in this appeal came to the contrary conclusion, a\n\nmajority of that panel holding as follows:\n\n      After careful consideration, we conclude that R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) only\n      requires that a trial court impose the prison term set forth in R.C.\n      2929.14(B)(1)(a) when crafting a sentence for a felony offense (other\n      than a violation of R.C. 2923.12) that carries a firearm specification; it\n      does not require a trial court to impose a prison term on the felony\n      offense underlying a firearm specification.\n\nLogan, 2023-Ohio-1135, at \u00b6 46.\n\n   III.   Analysis and Conclusion\n\n               The state emphasizes that R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) refers to \u201coffenses\u201d; the\n\nstatute requires a mandatory prison term \u201cfor any of the following offenses: * * *\n\n[a]ny offense * * * that is a felony, if the offender had a firearm on or about the\n\noffender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control while committing the felony * * *.\u201d\n\n(Emphasis added.) The state says that the only offense in this case is the underlying\n\nfelony because a firearm specification is not an offense and asserts that the statute\n\nthus requires a prison term for that \u201coffense.\u201d2 The state argues that the legislature\n\nwould have written the statute to specifically refer to specifications if it had intended\n\n\n\n\n      2 The state has advocated for the contrary position in other matters.  In State v.\nCulp, for instance, the state recommended that the trial court impose a prison sentence\non a firearm specification, followed by a term of community control on the underlying\nfelony. Culp, 2020-Ohio-5287, 162 N.E.3d 194, \u00b6 3.\n\fto make only the sentence attributable to the specification mandatory and not the\n\nunderlying felony.\n\n               Logan\u2019s argument rests on the final few words of R.C. 2929.13(F)(8);\n\nthe statute requires a mandatory prison term \u201cfor any of the following offenses:\n\n* * * any offense that is a felony, if the offender had a firearm on or about the\n\noffender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control while committing the felony, with\n\nrespect to a portion of the sentence imposed pursuant to [R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(a)]\n\nfor having the firearm.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Logan contends that the state\u2019s\n\nargument inexplicably reads this phrase out of the statute. We agree.\n\n               The state offers us no real explanation about what this phrase means,\n\nif not that a mandatory prison term is only required for the portion of the sentence\n\nattributable to the specification. The opinions rendered by other appellate districts\n\nthat come to the state\u2019s preferred conclusion, in our view, similarly do not\n\nsufficiently consider the last phrase of the statute.3\n\n\n\n      3 See State v. Wofford, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180411, 2019-Ohio-2815, \u00b6 10\n\n(\u201c[The defendant] admitted to committing a felony while having a firearm on his person\nor under his control.

The statute requires that a trial court, when crafting a sentence for a\n\nfelony (other than a violation of R.C. 2923.12) that is enhanced with a firearm\n\nspecification, impose the definite prison term prescribed by R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(a)\n\nas a mandatory prison term. The statute does not require the imposition of a\n\nmandatory prison term with respect to the felony underlying the firearm\n\nspecification. See also Ohio Criminal Sentencing Commission, Felony Sentencing\n\nQuick          Reference           Guide           (Dec.2019),           p.         4,\n\nhttps://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/Boards/Sentencing/resources/judPractition\n\ner/felonyQuickRef.pdf (accessed Aug. 1, 2023) (identifying that under R.C.\n\n2929.13(F)(8), among other statutory sections, \u201cTime for specification is\n\nmandatory; Term for the underlying offense may or may not be.\u201d); State v. Webb,\n\n8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 73974, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 5460, 11\u201312 (Nov. 19, 1998)\n\n(reading a former version of R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) with substantially similar language\n\nto \u201cmake[] a prison sentence mandatory only for the firearm specification, but not\n\nfor the underlying felony\u201d) (Karpinski, J., concurring in judgment only).\n\n               To read the statute in the way that the state suggests would be to read\n\nthe last phrase out of the statute. The statutory reference to \u201coffenses,\u201d as opposed\n\nto \u201cspecifications,\u201d is logical; a specification is merely \u201ca sentence enhancement that\n\fattaches to a predicate offense.\u201d State v. Ford, 128 Ohio St.3d 398, 2011-Ohio-765,\n\n945 N.E.2d 498, at \u00b6 16.4\n\n               A consideration of the former version of R.C. 2929.14 supports this\n\nconclusion. While the statute required a prison sentence on the underlying felony\n\nconviction, only the \u201cadditional prison term\u201d attributable to the firearm\n\nspecification was prohibited from being reduced through judicial release, earned\n\ncredit or other provisions of R.C. Chapter 2967. That fact supports a conclusion that\n\nR.C. 2929.13(F)(8) similarly provides for a mandatory prison term only for the\n\nportion of a felony sentence imposed pursuant to a firearm specification.\n\n                We, therefore, hold that R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) does not require the\n\nimposition of a mandatory prison term or preclude the imposition of community-\n\ncontrol penalties on an underlying felony when a defendant is found guilty on a\n\ncorresponding firearm specification. In our view, R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) cannot be read\n\nin any other way than we do here. Even if there were some ambiguity, \u201csections of\n\nthe Revised Code defining offenses or penalties shall be strictly construed against\n\nthe state, and liberally construed in favor of the accused.\u201d R.C. 2901.04(A).\n\n\n\n\n       4 While the Supreme Court found that an offender can be sentenced on a firearm\n\nspecification that accompanied a merged count, Bollar at \u00b6 18, it did so relying on the\nplain language of R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g), a statute that specifically addressed that issue.\nSee id. at \u00b6 19\u201321. That the legislature required a sentence for a specification even in the\nabsence of an underlying felony sentence under specific enumerated circumstances does\nnot convince us that we should disregard the final phrase of R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) solely\nbecause the statute uses the word \u201coffenses.\u201d\n\f               Sharpley, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106616, 2018-Ohio-4326, and\n\nGalvan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108658, 2020-Ohio-1285, are overruled to the\n\nextent that they are inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________\nEILEEN A. GALLAGHER, JUDGE\n\nANITA LASTER MAYS, A.J.; LISA B. FORBES, EMANUELLA D. GROVES,\nKATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, MARY EILEEN KILBANE, MICHAEL JOHN RYAN,\nand MICHELLE J. SHEEHAN, JJ., CONCUR;\n\nSEAN C.

GALLAGHER\u2019S OPINION CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT\nONLY.\n\n\nSEAN C. GALLAGHER, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT ONLY:\n\n               I concur in judgment only with the majority opinion. I do so because\n\na plain reading of the (F)(8) subsection does not leave room for an alternative\n\ndecision. The en banc holding is narrow: \u201cWhen a trial court crafts a sentence for a\n\nfelony that carries a firearm specification, R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) requires the court to\n\nimpose the definite prison term prescribed by R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(a) as a mandatory\n\nprison term with respect to the specification; it does not also require the court to\n\nimpose a mandatory prison term with respect to the underlying felony.\u201d (Emphasis\n\nadded.)\n\f                That is a true statement but, for the most part, that is because R.C.\n\n2929.13(F) is not a provision authorizing the imposition of sentences.             R.C.\n\n2929.13(F) establishes the nature of how a sentence is to be served after it was\n\nimposed, and it requires mandatory service of certain prison sentences imposed\n\nthrough other provisions of the Revised Code. This distinction was overlooked in\n\nSharpley.\n\n                While this is not a criticism, the state asked this court to review an\n\noverly narrow question that could not lead to a decision in its favor. This oversight\n\nis understandable given the confusion created from the single sentence from\n\nSharpley, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106616, 2018-Ohio-4326, concluding that an\n\noffender is not eligible for community control under R.C. 2929.13(F)(8).\n\n                The gist of the state\u2019s disagreement with the panel\u2019s conclusion\n\nleading to this en banc proceeding focuses on the fact that a community control\n\nsanction was imposed on the underlying offense in lieu of a prison term. The panel\n\ndetermined that the trial court was authorized to impose a term of community\n\ncontrol despite the attendant firearm specification requiring a prison term.\n\n                Whether a community control sanction can be imposed on the\n\nunderlying offense that includes an attendant firearm specification is not controlled\n\nthrough R.C. 2929.13(F)(8). R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) does not authorize the imposition\n\nof sentences.    That provision merely recognizes the mandatory nature of the\n\noffender\u2019s service of that sentence. The real question, at least the one the state would\n\nlike to have addressed, is whether a court is authorized to impose a community\n\fcontrol sanction at the sentencing hearing after determining that prison is required\n\nfor the attendant firearm specification. See State v. Hitchcock, 157 Ohio St.3d 215,\n\n2019-Ohio-3246, 134 N.E.3d 164, \u00b6 24 (absent a statutory basis for the imposition\n\nof the sentence, the trial court is without authority to impose such a sentence).\n\n                The answer to that real question likely lies elsewhere within the\n\nRevised Code,5 but no other provision was cited in favor of the state\u2019s position at any\n\ntime during this appeal. This limits the impact of the decision entered en banc and\n\nby the panel. The panel\u2019s conclusion with respect to determining that a community\n\ncontrol sanction may be imposed despite the fact that a prison term is required\n\narising from the same offense is not an issue that can be resolved within the en banc\n\nproceeding given the arguments presented. The only conclusion that can be reached\n\nis that R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) does not require the imposition of a prison term on the\n\nunderlying offense and the statement to the contrary in Sharpley, 8th Dist.\n\nCuyahoga No. 106616, 2018-Ohio-4326, must be overruled.                  Although R.C.\n\n2929.13(F)(8) does not require imposition of a prison term on the underlying\n\noffense, that is not to say that the requirement does not exist elsewhere in the\n\nRevised Code.\n\n\n\n\n      5 See State v. Chandler, 2017-Ohio-8573, 99 N.E.3d 1255, \u00b6 10 (8th Dist.) (the\n\ndefendant was convicted of two counts of felonious assault, each with a three-year firearm\nspecification under R.C. 2941.145 that must be served consecutive to each other under\nR.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g) and the underlying prison sentence under R.C. 2929.14(C)(1)(a)).\n\fHow could we get this wrong for so many years?\n\n               Notwithstanding, if the majority view and analysis on the community\n\ncontrol sanction question is correct, one must ask: How could we, and other panels\n\nfrom across the state, get this wrong for so many years? See Majority En Banc\n\nOpinion at fn. 3.\n\n               The applicable sentencing statutes have been amended so many times\n\nthat they are now virtually unreadable and, at times, indecipherable. Specifically,\n\nthe amendments to R.C. 2929.14 since the statute\u2019s enactment in July 1996 are at\n\nthe root of today\u2019s confusion. At one time, R.C. 2929.14 said exactly what the state\n\nproposes regarding the requirement to impose a prison sentence on the underlying\n\noffense for which a firearm specification applies:\n\n      if an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony is also\n      convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type described in\n      * * * section 2941.145 of the Revised Code that charges the offender\n      with having a firearm on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the\n      offender\u2019s control while committing the offense * * * and using it to\n      facilitate the offense, * * * the court, after imposing a prison term on\n      the offender for the felony * * * shall impose an additional prison term,\n      determined pursuant to this division.\n\n(Emphasis added.) R.C. 2929.14(D)(1)(a)(i), effective 10-29-99.\n\n               That passage is no longer in the statute. That express language was\n\nwinnowed down to two different firearm specifications starting with the version of\n\nR.C. 2929.14 effective 3-22-2001.6 Through the various versions of R.C. 2929.14,\n\n\n      6 R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) has existed in its current form through both versions of the\n\nstatute, although it has been renumbered. Thus, even under the older version in which a\nprison term on the underlying offense was required, the statute was drafted so that only\n\fhowever, the legislature codified what is now located in R.C. 2929.14(C)(1)(a), which\n\nprovides in pertinent part, \u201cif a mandatory prison term is imposed upon an offender\n\npursuant to division (B)(1)(a) (firearm specifications) * * * the offender shall serve\n\nany mandatory prison term imposed\u201d thereunder \u201cconsecutively to and prior to any\n\nprison term imposed for the underlying felony pursuant to division (A)\u201d of R.C.\n\n2929.14 (all degrees of felony offenses). This provision arguably touches on the\n\nstate\u2019s concern.\n\nAmenability\n\n               One of the first considerations a trial judge makes in sentencing is\n\ndetermining if an offender is, or is not, amenable to community control. State v.\n\nSobel, Sixth Dist. Fulton No. F-22-010, 2023-Ohio-2247; State v. Vlad, 153 Ohio\n\nApp.3d 74, 2003-Ohio-2930, 790 N.E.2d 1246 (7th Dist.).            With all of those\n\ndecisions, the primary question is whether the legislature authorized that particular\n\nsentence. State v. Anderson, 143 Ohio St.3d 173, 2015-Ohio-2089, 35 N.E.3d 512,\n\n\u00b6 10. \u201cBefore imposing sentence\u201d for multiple offenses, \u201cif the sentencing court\n\ndetermines at the sentencing hearing that a prison term is necessary or required, the\n\ncourt shall * * * [i]mpose a stated prison term.\u201d R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(a). Nothing\n\nwithin that provision or anything under subdivision (B)(2)(b) requires the court to\n\ndetermine whether prison was necessary on each individual felony or each\n\n\n\n\nthe prison term on the specification was mandatory. Yet the statute has been amended\nand portions renumbered on over 40 occasions since 1996. The provisions in the statute\nare a challenge to even the most experienced statute constructionist.\n\findividual offense before requiring the court to impose a prison sentence. That\n\nprovision states in broad terms that before imposing sentence for the case, even if\n\nthat case involves multiple offenses, once the court determines that prison is\n\nnecessary, a prison sentence must be imposed.\n\n                This interpretation stems from the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion\n\nthat \u201ca court cannot impose a prison term and a community-control sanction for the\n\nsame offense.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 32. \u201c[T]he sentencing statute does not allow a trial court to\n\nimpose both a prison sentence and community control for the same offense.\u201d\n\n(Emphasis added.) State v. Jacobs, 189 Ohio App.3d 283, 2010-Ohio-4010, 938\n\nN.E.2d 79, \u00b6 5 (8th Dist.). Instead, the trial court must \u201c\u2018decide which sentence is\n\nmost appropriate \u2014 prison or community control sanctions \u2014 and impose\n\nwhichever option is deemed to be necessary.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting Vlad at \u00b6 16; see also\n\nState v. Martin, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100723, 2014-Ohio-3913.\n\n               There is a strong precedent in our jurisprudence that an offender is\n\neither amenable to community control, or not. There\u2019s no middle ground. It is not\n\nlike anyone can say they are a \u201clittle pregnant.\u201d Thus, where R.C. 2929.14 (B)(1)(a)\n\nand 2929.13(F)(8) makes the specification mandatory time, R.C. 2929.14(C)(1)(a)\n\nmakes the prison term imposed on that specification consecutive to the prison term\n\nimposed for the underlying felony offenses. The statute presumes a prison term has\n\nbeen imposed on the underlying felony offense when a firearm specification is\n\ninvolved, regardless of the level of that offense, and is silent as to any possibility of\n\fcommunity control sanctions. See, e.g., Chandler, 2017-Ohio-8573, 99 N.E.3d 1255,\n\nat \u00b6 10.\n\n               Consideration of R.C. 2929.14(C)(1)(a) could arguably lead to the\n\nconclusion that if a defendant must serve a prison term for the specification,\n\nimposing community control on the underlying term is inherently inconsistent with\n\nany amenability analysis.     But that is a question left unanswered given the\n\narguments presented to the panel and this court sitting en banc. It might very well\n\nbe one in need of an answer moving forward.\n\nConclusion\n\n               The legislature has not provided the model of clarity for sentencing\n\nconsiderations. It may well be time to revisit a thorough review and simplification\n\nof the bloated sentencing statutes.\n\n               Nevertheless, I believe we should certify a conflict between this case\n\nand one of the conflicting cases from other districts outlined in footnote 3 of the\n\nmajority en banc opinion. I also believe the Supreme Court of Ohio should take this\n\nissue to better address the relationship between mandatory prison terms on\n\nspecifications and the underlying offenses in the context of the overriding principles\n\nof felony sentencing under R.C. 2929.11 and other relevant provisions in Title 29.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing considerations, I concur in judgment only with the\n\nmajority\u2019s decision.\n\fMerit Panel Decision\n\nEILEEN A. GALLAGHER, J.:\n\n   I.      Factual Background and Procedural History\n\n                A Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted Logan in October 2021 for\n\nseveral firearm-related offenses. Logan pleaded guilty in April 2022 to one count of\n\nattempted having weapons while under disability, a fourth-degree felony. See R.C.\n\n2923.02, 2923.13(A)(2), 2923.13(B).       The charge included a one-year firearm\n\nspecification under R.C. 2941.141(A) and a forfeiture specification.       The state\n\ndismissed the remaining counts in the indictment.\n\n                During Logan\u2019s change-of-plea hearing, the trial court described the\n\npossible penalties for the proposed plea as follows, in relevant part:\n\n        Amended Count 1, attempted having weapons under disability, a felony\n        of the fourth degree, punishable by a maximum of 18 months of\n        incarceration and up to a $5,000 fine. There is also a one-year firearm\n        specification, which is mandatory time, and that must be served prior\n        to and consecutive to any time that may be imposed on the underlying\n        charge.\n\n        ***\n\n        With regards to a felony of the fourth degree, it is a rebuttable\n        presumption with regards to community control, and if you were to be\n        placed on community control, there could be sanctions for up to five\n        years instead of prison.\n\n        ***\n\n        The firearm specification for which you are pleading is regarded by law\n        as an enhancement, and so therefore, the Court could consider, as well,\n        placing you on community control on the felony of the fourth degree\n        and still imposing that mandatory one-year firearm specification.\n\f              The assistant prosecuting attorney then confirmed that she was\n\nsatisfied that the trial court had complied with Crim.R. 11 in conducting its plea\n\ncolloquy.\n\n               On May 12, 2022, the trial court held a sentencing hearing. The\n\nparties made arguments to the court, with each agreeing that Logan \u201chas turned her\n\nlife around\u201d since her last criminal case, taking steps to better her life by \u2014 among\n\nother things \u2014 attending a career-training program. At the hearing, the assistant\n\nprosecuting attorney said the following about the state\u2019s recommended sentence:\n\n      I don\u2019t have to belabor her history. You have that in front of you in the\n      [presentence-investigation report]. We have a one-year firearm\n      specification in this case. I think we all know how this is going to end\n      here today. The State of Ohio would defer to the Court when it comes\n      to the underlying charge, the having weapons under disability.\n\n               The trial court sentenced Logan to one year in prison on the firearm\n\nspecification and to two years of community control for the underlying felony. The\n\ntrial court imposed the mandatory prison term on the firearm specification prior\n\nand consecutive to the two years of community control, ordering that Logan be\n\nreturned to the Cuyahoga County Corrections Center after she is released from\n\nprison for the court to hold a hearing to advise her of her community-control\n\nobligations \u201cand make sure that she reports there and there are no lapses with\n\nregards to time.\u201d\n\n               After announcing its sentence, the trial court engaged in the following\n\nexchange with the assistant prosecuting attorney:\n\n      THE COURT: Anything further, [assistant prosecuting attorney]?\n\f         [ASSISTANT PROSECUTING ATTORNEY]: No, your Honor. Thank\n         you.\n\n                 The court published a sentencing journal entry. The original journal\n\nentry did not specify that the mandatory prison term is to be served prior and\n\nconsecutive to the community-control term, an omission that was corrected through\n\na nunc pro tunc entry based on the original announcement of decision in this matter.\n\nThe state appealed the sentence under R.C. 2953.08(B)(2). The state raises one\n\nassignment of error for review:\n\n         The Trial Court erred by not imposing a prison sentence for\n         [a]ttempted [h]aving weapons while under disability where the\n         offender had a firearm on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the\n         offender\u2019s control while committing the felony.7\n\n   II.      Law and Analysis\n\n         A. Standard of Review\n\n                 We review felony sentences under the standard of review set forth in\n\nR.C. 2953.08(G)(2). State v. Marcum, 146 Ohio St.3d 516, 2016-Ohio-1002, 59\n\nN.E.3d 1231, \u00b6 22\u201323. Under R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), an appellate court may increase,\n\nreduce or otherwise modify a sentence or vacate a sentence and remand for\n\nresentencing if it \u201cclearly and convincingly\u201d finds that (1) the record does not\n\nsupport certain of the sentencing court\u2019s findings or (2) the sentence is \u201cotherwise\n\ncontrary to law.\u201d \u201c\u2018Clear and convincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof\n\n* * * which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as\n\n\n         7 The original announcement of decision, State v. Logan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.\n\n111533, 2023-Ohio-1135, released April 6, 2023, is hereby vacated. This opinion is the\ncourt\u2019s journalized decision in this appeal.\n\fto the facts sought to be established.\u2019\u201d State v. Franklin, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.\n\n107482, 2019-Ohio-3760, \u00b6 29, quoting Cross v. Ledford, 161 Ohio St. 469, 120\n\nN.E.2d 118 (1954), paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\n               The state did not object to Logan\u2019s sentence in the trial court, so we\n\nreview the sentence only for plain error. See, e.g., State v. Dowdell, 8th Dist.\n\nCuyahoga No. 111026, 2022-Ohio-2956, \u00b6 8\u20139. That said, a sentence that fails to\n\nimpose a mandatory provision is contrary to law and a sentence that is imposed\n\ncontrary to law constitutes plain error. Id.\n\n               Before turning to the parties\u2019 arguments specific to this case, we\n\nconsider the statutes and caselaw relevant to the question presented by this appeal.\n\n      B. Relevant Legal Background\n\n             1. Criminal Offenses and Firearms Specifications\n\n               First, we contrast criminal offenses from specifications that enhance\n\nthe penalty for those offenses.\n\n               Attempting to have weapons while under disability is a criminal\n\noffense, since doing so violates statutes of the Revised Code that \u201cstate a positive\n\nprohibition * * * and provide a penalty for violation of such prohibition\u201d \u2014 namely\n\nR.C. 2923.02 and 2923.13(A)(2). See R.C. 2901.03(A) (\u201cNo conduct constitutes a\n\ncriminal offense against the state unless it is defined as an offense in the Revised\n\nCode.\u201d); R.C. 2901.03(B) (\u201cAn offense is defined when one or more sections of the\n\nRevised Code state a positive prohibition or enjoin a specific duty, and provide a\n\fpenalty for violation of such prohibition or failure to meet such duty.\u201d); see also\n\nState v. Ford, 128 Ohio St.3d 398, 2011-Ohio-765, 945 N.E.2d 498, \u00b6 10.\n\n               A firearm specification, on the other hand, is not a criminal offense.\n\nThe statutes setting forth the specification and its punitive effect \u2014 R.C.\n\n2929.14(B)(1)(a) and 2941.141(A) \u2014 do not contain a positive prohibition of\n\nconduct. R.C. 2901.03(B), 2929.14(B)(1)(a) and 2941.141(A); see also Ford at \u00b6 16\n\n(analyzing the firearm specification and its punitive effect set forth in R.C. 2941.145\n\nand 2929.14(D)). Instead, the specification provides that if a defendant pleads guilty\n\nto a felony offense and, during the commission of that offense, if the defendant had\n\na firearm on or about her person or under her control, the defendant\u2019s underlying\n\nfelony sentence will be increased by one year in prison. R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(a); R.C.\n\n2941.141(A); see Ford at \u00b6 16. \u201cThus, the firearm specification is merely a sentencing\n\nprovision that requires an enhanced penalty upon certain findings.\u201d Ford at \u00b6 16.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of a firearm specification is to enhance the punishment of criminals\n\nwho voluntarily introduce a firearm while committing an offense and to deter\n\ncriminals from using firearms.\u201d State v. White, 142 Ohio St.3d 277, 2015-Ohio-492,\n\n29 N.E.3d 939, \u00b6 31.\n\n               With this distinction in mind, we now consider the trial court\u2019s\n\ndiscretion to craft felony sentences.\n\n             2. The Trial Court\u2019s Discretion to Craft Felony Sentences\n\n               A trial court has the statutory authority, in crafting a felony sentence,\n\nto impose \u201cany sanction or combination of sanctions on the offender that are\n\fprovided in sections 2929.14 to 2929.18 of the Revised Code\u201d unless a specific\n\npenalty is required to be imposed or is precluded from being imposed pursuant to\n\nlaw, including in the circumstances described by R.C. 2929.13(E), (F) or (G). R.C.\n\n2929.13(A).\n\n               Attempted having weapons while under disability is a fourth-degree\n\nfelony. See R.C. 2923.02(E)(1), 2923.13(A)(2) and 2923.13(B). A fourth-degree\n\nfelony is punishable, under most circumstances, by a definite prison term of six,\n\nseven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen\n\nor eighteen months. R.C. 2929.14(A)(4). A trial court may also \u201cdirectly impose a\n\nsentence that consists of one or more community control sanctions authorized\n\npursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code\u201d in lieu of\n\nimprisonment for a fourth-degree felony unless the court is required to impose a\n\nprison term, a mandatory prison term or a term of life imprisonment on the\n\noffender. R.C. 2929.15(A)(1).\n\n               A trial court generally cannot, however, impose a term of\n\nimprisonment and a term of community control on an offender for the same offense,\n\neven when both types of penalty are authorized. State v. Anderson, 143 Ohio St.3d\n\n173, 2015-Ohio-2089, 35 N.E.3d 512, \u00b6 31 (\u201c[W]hen a prison term and community\n\ncontrol are possible sentences for a particular felony offense, absent an express\n\nexception, the court must impose either a prison term or a community-control\n\nsanction or sanctions.\u201d).\n\f                Under many circumstances,8 a trial court must impose a prison term\n\non an offender who pleads guilty to a firearm specification described by R.C.\n\n2941.141, 2941.144 or 2941.145. R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(a). Here, Logan pleaded guilty\n\nto a specification that she had a firearm on or about her person or under her control\n\nwhile committing the offense of attempted having weapons while under disability.\n\nR.C. 2929.141(A). Therefore, the presence of the firearm specification required the\n\ntrial court to impose a mandatory one-year prison term. R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(a)(iii).9\n\n                Having set forth the relevant legal background, we turn to the parties\u2019\n\npositions on the legality of Logan\u2019s sentence.\n\n       C. Analysis\n\n                The state argues that the trial court was required to sentence Logan\n\nto some term of imprisonment on the offense of attempted having weapons while\n\nunder disability. It asks us to find that the trial court\u2019s community-control sentence\n\non that offense is contrary to law, vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the\n\ntrial court for resentencing on that offense.\n\n                The state argues that R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) required that a mandatory\n\nprison term be imposed on Logan for the underlying felony because Logan pleaded\n\n\n       8 R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(e), for example, describes circumstances in which the trial\n\ncourt is not permitted to impose the mandatory prison sentences provided for firearms\nspecifications.\n       9 The offense of having weapons while under disability is not enhanceable with a\n\nsentence from a firearm specification unless \u201cthe offender previously has been convicted\nof * * * any felony of the first * * * or second degree\u201d and \u201c[l]ess than five years have passed\nsince the offender was released from prison or post-release control, whichever is later, for\nthe prior offense.\u201d R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(e). Here, those circumstances were met.\n\fguilty to a firearm specification. The state further asserts that community control\n\nwas not an authorized sentence for the underlying felony pursuant to R.C.\n\n2929.15(A)(1), because the trial court was required to impose a term of\n\nimprisonment on the offense.      Finally, the state argues that the trial court\u2019s\n\nsentence \u2014 which imposed a two-year term of community control for the underlying\n\nfelony consecutive and subsequent to a one-year term of imprisonment for the\n\nspecification \u2014 is an unlawful \u201csplit sentence\u201d following Anderson, 143 Ohio St.3d\n\n173, 2015-Ohio-2089, 35 N.E.3d 512, at \u00b6 31.\n\n              To answer the question presented by this appeal, we must first\n\nconsider whether R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) required the trial court to sentence Logan to a\n\nmandatory prison term on the underlying felony. Based on the decision of the en\n\nbanc court discussed above, we conclude that R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) did not require the\n\ntrial court to sentence Logan to a mandatory prison term on the offense of attempted\n\nhaving weapons while under disability.\n\n              We must now consider whether the Revised Code authorized the trial\n\ncourt to sentence Logan to community control on the underlying offense while\n\nimposing a mandatory prison term for the specification. The latter inquiry, in turn,\n\ninvolves a consideration of whether Logan received an unlawful split sentence.\n\n              The state argues that the trial court\u2019s imposition of community\n\ncontrol on the underlying felony, to be served after a mandatory term of\n\nimprisonment for the firearm specification, was an unlawful split sentence. It also\n\fargues that community control was not available under R.C. 2929.15(A)(1) because\n\nthe court was required to impose a prison term on the offense.\n\n               There is some support for the state\u2019s argument. In State v. Ervin, a\n\npanel of the Twelfth District considered a sentence imposed on a defendant for two\n\nsecond-degree felonies, one of which carried a firearm specification. State v. Ervin,\n\n2017-Ohio-1491, 89 N.E.3d 1, \u00b6 2 (12th Dist.).        The trial court sentenced the\n\ndefendant to a mandatory three-year prison term for the gun specification and five-\n\nyear terms of community control on each of the underlying felony counts. Id. The\n\ncommunity-control penalties were to be served consecutively to and after the prison\n\nterm. Id. The defendant successfully completed her prison sentence but she\n\nsubsequently violated her community control; the trial court then imposed prison\n\nterms on each of the underlying felony convictions and the defendant appealed. Id.\n\nat \u00b6 3. The appeals court reversed, holding that the trial court\u2019s initial sentence was\n\nan unlawful \u201cblended sentence\u201d and that a trial court has no authority to impose\n\nconsecutive community-control penalties following a prison term, with limited\n\nexceptions. Id. at \u00b6 23. In reaching this conclusion, the panel relied on this court\u2019s\n\nen banc decision in State v. Anderson, 2016-Ohio-7044, 62 N.E.3d 229 (8th Dist.)\n\nand the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Anderson, 143 Ohio St.3d 173, 2015-Ohio-\n\n2089, 35 N.E.3d 512.\n\n               Logan defends the sentence by arguing that the legislature\n\nspecifically authorized the sentence imposed on her by only requiring mandatory\n\nprison time for the \u201cportion\u201d of a sentence attributable to a firearm specification.\n\fLogan\u2019s argument is essentially that the reference to a \u201cportion\u201d of a sentence in R.C.\n\n2929.13(F)(8) presupposes that a trial court\u2019s sentence on a felony enhanced by a\n\nfirearm specification can properly be divided into \u201cportions,\u201d with one portion\n\nserved in prison and the other on community control.\n\n              This court has previously held that a trial court may impose\n\ncommunity-control sanctions on an underlying offense that does not require\n\nimprisonment while imposing prison on an accompanying specification that does\n\nrequire imprisonment. See State v. Hamm, 2016-Ohio-2938, 65 N.E.3d 143, \u00b6 17\n\n(8th Dist.) (underlying third-degree felony with a gang-activity specification under\n\nR.C. 2929.14(G)).\n\n               The panel in Hamm, which included then-Judge Melody J. Stewart,\n\ndisagreed with the exact argument put forth by the state here: because a trial court\n\nmust impose \u201ceither a prison term or community control sanctions on each\n\ncount\u201d \u2014 (emphasis added) Anderson, 143 Ohio St.3d 173, 2015-Ohio-2089, 35\n\nN.E.3d 512, at \u00b6 23 \u2014 and because a specification is completely dependent on the\n\nexistence of an underlying offense, \u201cthe offense plus the specification constitute \u2018the\n\nentire count\u2019\u201d and the trial court cannot impose both community control and\n\nimprisonment for the same offense. Hamm at \u00b6 6\u20138. In rejecting this argument,\n\nthe panel concluded that \u201cimposing community control on an underlying offense\n\nand prison on an accompanying specification does not implicate the \u2018split sentence\u2019\n\nprohibition precisely because a specification is not part of the underlying offense but\n\nmerely a sentencing enhancement to that offense.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 9. Thus, \u201cwhere a trial\n\fcourt is not required to impose a prison sentence on the underlying felony, even\n\nwhere prison is mandatory for the accompanying specification, a trial court may\n\nimpose community control sanctions on the underlying felony.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 16.\n\n              The state acknowledges Hamm but argues that it is distinguishable\n\nbecause it did not involve an offense for which a mandatory term was required under\n\nR.C. 2929.13(F)(8), a reading of that statute which this court, sitting en banc,\n\nrejected above. The state also asks us to reconsider Hamm, asserting that a sentence\n\nof community control on a felony underlying a specification that mandates\n\nimprisonment violates the split-sentence doctrine. We are persuaded to follow\n\nHamm\u2019s reasoning and hold that community control was an authorized sentence on\n\nthe fourth-degree felony at issue here.\n\n              The Supreme Court in Anderson noted that in the mid-1990s the\n\nlegislature ended the \u201cregular practice\u201d among trial courts of imposing and then\n\nsuspending prison sentences in favor of probation; since that legislative overhaul of\n\nthe sentencing statutes, prison terms and community-control penalties are now\n\n\u201calternative sanctions.\u201d See Anderson at \u00b6 21\u201323, 28. Therefore, \u201cas a general rule,\n\nwhen a prison term and community control are possible sentences for a particular\n\nfelony offense, absent an express exception, the court must impose either a prison\n\nterm or a community-control sanction or sanctions.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 31. This court\n\ndescribed the line of Supreme Court cases addressing the \u201csplit-sentence doctrine\u201d\n\nsince Anderson as follows:\n\f      A court may also not impose a community-control sanction on one\n      count consecutive to a prison term on another count absent statutory\n      authority. State v. Hitchcock, 175 Ohio St.3d 215, 2019-Ohio-3246, 134\n      N.E.3d 164, \u00b6 25. However, the Supreme Court of Ohio has held that a\n      court may impose both a prison term for one offense and a community-\n      control term for another offense in the same case. State v. Paige, 153\n      Ohio St.3d 214, 2018-Ohio-813, 103 N.E.3d 800, \u00b6 9. The Paige Court\n      went on to hold that the trial court could not impose what amounted to\n      a consecutive term of commitment to a community-based correctional\n      facility after release from prison. Id. at \u00b6 13.\n\nState v. Robinson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 110467, 2022-Ohio-3033, \u00b6 12.\n\n              We do not read these authorities to prohibit what the trial court did\n\nhere. The trial court, when sentencing Logan for the fourth-degree felony offense to\n\nwhich she pleaded guilty, had the choice between imposing an authorized prison\n\nterm or imposing community-control sanctions; it chose community-control\n\nsanctions. By virtue of the firearm specification, that sanction was enhanced by the\n\naddition of one year in prison. We follow Hamm and hold that a trial court does not\n\nviolate the split-sentence doctrine by imposing a mandatory prison term for a\n\nfirearm specification prior and consecutive to community-control penalties on the\n\nfelony offense underlying the specification. See Hamm, 2016-Ohio-2938, 65 N.E.3d\n\n143, at \u00b6 16; Moore, 2015-Ohio-1026, at \u00b6 18 (E.T. Gallagher, J., concurring in\n\njudgment only) (stating the opinion that the imposition of a mandatory prison term\n\nfor a firearm specification and community-control penalties on the underlying\n\nfelony does not constitute an improper \u201csplit sentence\u201d).\n\n              The final question we must address in this appeal is whether\n\ncommunity control is authorized under R.C. 2929.15(A)(1). \u201c\u2018[T]he only sentence\n\fwhich a trial judge may impose is that provided for by statute * * *.\u2019\u201d Anderson, 143\n\nOhio St.3d 173, 2015-Ohio-2089, 35 N.E.3d 512, at \u00b6 12, quoting State v. Beasley, 14\n\nOhio St.3d 74, 75, 471 N.E.2d 774 (1984). Our resolution of this question flows\n\nnaturally from this court\u2019s resolution of the two issues previously addressed.\n\n              R.C. 2929.15(A)(1) states as follows, in relevant part:\n\n      If in sentencing an offender for a felony the court is not required to\n      impose a prison term, a mandatory prison term, or a term of life\n      imprisonment upon the offender, the court may directly impose a\n      sentence that consists of one or more community control sanctions\n      authorized pursuant to [R.C. 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18].\n\n              As discussed above, the trial court was not required to impose a\n\nprison term or a term of life imprisonment for the underlying fourth-degree felony\n\nin this case and R.C. 2929.13(F)(8) does not require the imposition of a mandatory\n\nprison term for the underlying offense either. The mandatory prison term for the\n\nfirearm specification was merely a sentencing enhancement. Therefore, the trial\n\ncourt was authorized to impose community-control sanctions under R.C.\n\n2929.15(A)(1). See Hamm at \u00b6 16\u201317; Webb, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 5460, at 12\u201314\n\n(Karpinski, J., concurring in judgment only).\n\n              Having found that (1) based on the decision of this en banc court, R.C.\n\n2929.13(F)(8) did not require the trial court to impose a mandatory prison term on\n\nthe offense of attempted having weapons while under disability; (2) the imposition\n\nof community-control sanctions on that offense was not an unlawful split sentence,\n\nnotwithstanding that the trial court also imposed the mandatory term of\n\nimprisonment required because of the firearm specification and (3) R.C.\n\f2929.15(A)(1) authorized the trial court to impose community-control sanctions on\n\nthe underlying offense, we overrule the state\u2019s assignment of error.\n\n   III.     Conclusion\n\n                 Having overruled the state\u2019s sole assignment of error for the reasons\n\nstated above, we affirm the judgment.\n\n          It is ordered that the appellee recover from the appellant the costs herein\n\ntaxed.\n\n          The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n          It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the\n\nCuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas to carry this judgment into execution.\n\n          A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule\n\n27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n\n\n_________________________\nEILEEN A.
