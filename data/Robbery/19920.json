In this gang-related and procedurally complicated stabbing case\u2500which\n\freturns to this court following a nonpublished opinion in Vizcarra's prior appeal in People\n\nv. Vizcarra (May 22, 2013, D061878) (Vizcarra I) and the resulting remand to the trial\n\ncourt with directions to conduct a limited resentencing\u2500a jury convicted Vizcarra, who\n\nwas a member of the Chicali Brazas (Chicali) criminal street gang in Brawley, of two\n\nfelonies: (1) assaulting Jesus Zermeno with a deadly weapon, a knife (count 2: Pen.\n\nCode, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)) (undesignated statutory references will be to the Penal Code);\n\nand (2) attempting to dissuade a witness, Zermeno (count 3: \u00a7 136.1, subd. (a)(2),\n\nhereafter \u00a7 136.1(a)(2)). The jury found Vizcarra not guilty of attempting to willfully,\n\ndeliberately, and with premeditation murder Zermeno (\u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 664) as charged\n\nin count 1.\n\n       In addition, the jury found to be true a count 2 allegation that Vizcarra committed\n\nthe assault with a deadly weapon for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association\n\nwith a criminal street gang (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)). In a bifurcated proceeding, the court\n\nfound to be true a count 2 allegation that Vizcarra had suffered a strike prior (\u00a7 667,\n\nsubds. (b)-(i)).\n\n       The court originally sentenced Vizcarra in this case to an aggregate prison term of\n\n15 years consisting of (1) the upper term of four years for his count 2 conviction of\n\nassault with a deadly weapon, doubled to eight years under the Three Strikes law as a\n\nresult of the court's true finding on the count 2 strike prior allegation; plus (2) a\n\nconsecutive term of two years for his count 3 conviction of attempting to dissuade a\n\nvictim or witness, which the court did not double under the Three Strikes law; plus (3) a\n\nconsecutive five-year term for the gang enhancement.\n\n                                               2\n\f       Before we set forth Vizcarra's contentions in this new appeal, and in order to\n\nprovide necessary procedural context, we must briefly discuss his first appeal and the\n\nlimited resentencing hearing that we directed the trial court to conduct on remand.\n\n       A. Vizcarra's First Appeal (Vizcarra I, D061878)1\n\n       In Vizcarra I, Vizcarra challenged on various grounds his count 3 conviction\n\n(dissuading a witness) and his sentence. As pertinent here, the Attorney General\n\nresponded by arguing that Vizcarra's total prison term sentence should be increased by\n\nseven years\u2014from 15 years to 22 years\u2014because (1) the court was required, but failed,\n\nto double to four years under the Three Strikes law the two-year sentence it imposed for\n\nVizcarra's count 3 conviction of attempting to dissuade a victim or witness, and (2) the\n\ncourt also was required, but failed, to impose a consecutive five-year prior serious felony\n\nconviction enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a)(1) (hereafter section\n\n667(a)(1)) (discussed, post).\n\n       In his reply brief, Vizcarra acknowledged that the court erroneously failed to\n\ndouble under the Three Strikes law the two-year sentence it imposed for his count 3\n\nconviction. However, relying on People v. Henderson (1963) 60 Cal. 2d 482 (Henderson)\n\n(and other legal authorities), Vizcarra asserted that, \"[u]nder California law, after appeal a\n\ndefendant may not receive a greater sentence on [the] charges for which he was tried in\n\nthe first trial.\" He also asserted that \"California double jeopardy and due process\n\n\n1      We take judicial notice of the record on appeal filed in this court in Vizcarra I, as\nwell as of this court's unpublished opinion in that matter. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 451, subd. (a),\n452, subd. (d), 459, subd. (a).)\n\n                                              3\n\fprinciples generally forbid such an increased sentence.\" Thus, Vizcarra claimed, his\n\nsentence could not be increased lawfully following his appeal because his original 15-\n\nyear aggregate sentence was \"within the range of permissible sentences\" the trial court\n\nwas legally authorized to impose, and the court \"could have reached a legal sentence of\n\n[15] years, even with the correction of the alleged errors.\"\n\n       In this court's unpublished opinion in Vizcarra I, rejecting Vizcarra's claims, we\n\nconcluded that the trial court erred and rendered an unauthorized sentence by (1) failing\n\nto impose a mandatory five-year enhancement under section 667(a)(1), and (2) failing to\n\ndouble under the Three Strikes law the two-year sentence it imposed for Vizcarra's count\n\n3 conviction. Accordingly, we modified the judgment by ordering imposition of a\n\nconsecutive five-year enhancement under section 667(a)(1), reversed the sentence as to\n\ncount 3, and remanded this case \"for resentencing subject to the court's exercise of its\n\nsection 1385, subdivision (a) power to strike the prior conviction finding.\" In all other\n\nrespects, we affirmed the judgment as modified.\n\n       This court thereafter denied Vizcarra's petition for rehearing. On August 21, 2013,\n\nthe California Supreme Court denied his petition for review (People v. Vizcarra,\n\nS211630).\n\n       B. Resentencing on Remand\n\n       On remand in mid-January 2014, the trial court conducted a limited resentencing\n\nhearing in accordance with this court's directions in Vizcarra I. In the exercise of its\n\ndiscretion, the court denied Vizcarra's motion under section 1385, subdivision (a)\n\n(hereafter section 1385(a)) and People v. Superior Court (Romero) (1996) 13 Cal. 4th 497\n\n                                              4\n\f(Romero) to strike his prior strike conviction, and it then imposed the new sentence. As\n\nto count 3, the court imposed the term of two years, doubled to four years under the\n\nThree Strikes law as a result of Vizcarra's strike prior. The court sentenced Vizcarra to\n\nan aggregate prison term of 22 years, consisting of his original 15-year sentence, plus the\n\nmandatory five-year enhancement under section 667(a)(1) that this court in Vizcarra I\n\nordered imposed for his serious felony prior, plus the additional two years resulting from\n\nthe doubling under the Three Strikes law of the original two-year term imposed as to\n\ncount 3.\n\n       C. Vizcarra's Contentions\n\n       Vizcarra again appeals, raising two main contentions. First, he contends the\n\nseven-year increase in his aggregate prison sentence\u2500from 15 to 22 years\u2500following his\n\nfirst appeal is illegal as a matter of law, and he asserts his 22-year sentence must be\n\nreduced to 15 years. Second, he contends the court abused its discretion in resentencing\n\nhim on remand \"by failing to complete a full sentencing analysis and by relying on\n\nimproper sentencing considerations.\"\n\n       For reasons we shall explain, we reject these contentions and affirm the judgment.\n\nHowever, we remand the matter with directions to amend the new abstract of judgment to\n\ncorrect two clerical errors (discussed, post) the Attorney General has correctly pointed\n\nout.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f                              FACTUAL BACKGROUND2\n\n       Vizcarra, whose Chicali gang moniker was \"Shorty,\" stabbed Zermeno\u2500who was\n\naffiliated with a rival street gang\u2500twice in the ribs with a knife, causing him to suffer a\n\ncollapsed lung. Zermeno was hospitalized for about two weeks. At the time of the\n\nassault, Vizcarra was accompanied by Jeffrey Ruiz, whose Chicali gang moniker was\n\n\"Speedy\" and who testified at trial that he saw Vizcarra stab Zermeno.\n\n       While in custody, Vizcarra made three phone calls: one to his fellow Chicali gang\n\nmember, Fernando Flores, and the others to Chicali gang associates Carlos Angulo and\n\nWalter Lopez. Specifically, in the first phone call, Vizcarra called Angulo. Vizcarra told\n\nAngulo: \"Ask for [Zermeno], man. Find him, man. Do that favor for me, man, and tell\n\nhim that when he goes to court to say, 'No.' You know what I mean?\" Angulo replied,\n\n\"Yes.\" After briefly discussing something else, Vizcarra told Angulo: \"Hey, but\u2014try to\n\nfind that damn Jesus Zermeno, man. All right?\" Angulo responded, \"All right, then.\"\n\n       In the second phone call, Vizcarra called Lopez and asked him for a \"favor.\"\n\nVizcarra asked Lopez whether he knew Zermeno, and Lopez indicated he did not.\n\nVizcarra explained, \"Uh, well the fucker is saying . . . Supposedly, that he is snitching,\n\nman.\" Lopez said, \"Really?\" Lopez then told Vizcarra, \"Wait, hold on, I'm going to\n\nwrite that shit down, man.\" Vizcarra spelled Zermeno's name for Lopez, who then said\n\nhe would \"see what's up.\" After informing Lopez that he (Vizcarra) was being charged\n\nwith attempted murder, Vizcarra told Lopez: \"That's why I want you to [stutters] do that\n\n\n2       The following summary of the underlying facts in this case is taken from this\ncourt's unpublished opinion in Vizcarra I.\n                                              6\n\ffavor for me, man.\" Lopez responded affirmatively. Vizcarra then said, \"Find that\n\nfucker, man,\" adding, \"We got court on Monday, fool.\" Lopez replied, \"All right, fool.\"\n\nVizcarra then gave instructions to Lopez about what Zermeno should say in court:\n\n            \"And then, well, if you can get a hold of him before Monday it\n            would be great, man. And just tell him that if he is going to go to\n            court, man, to just say that it wasn't us. You know what I mean?\n            That he should say, 'No\u2014.'\"\n\n       Interrupting Vizcarra, Lopez replied, \"Yeah.\" Vizcarra added that Zermeno\n\nshould say, \"[I]t's the wrong people.'\" Lopez indicated he would do this favor for\n\nVizcarra.\n\n       In the third phone call, Vizcarra called Flores, whom he called \"Flako.\" Vizcarra\n\nasked Flores whether he knew Zermeno, and Flores replied he did not. Vizcarra told\n\nFlores, \"[I]f [Zermeno] goes to court he should say, 'No.' You know what I mean, man?\"\n\nFlores replied, \"Yes.\" Vizcarra added, \"That it wasn't us, dog.\" Flores responded, \"Yeah,\n\nI know. I know.\" Vizcarra further explained that he \"already told [Lopez]\" and that\n\nLopez had written down Zermeno's name. Flores confirmed Zermeno's name and told\n\nVizcarra he had written down Zermeno's name. Vizcarra then told Flores: \"All right,\n\ndog. Just figure that shit out, dog. All right? . . . Do that favor for me, man.\" Flores\n\nreassured Vizcarra, saying, \"Yeah, don't trip.\" (1CT 226)!\n\n       Zermeno, the victim in this case, testified for the prosecution that, on the night in\n\nquestion, two Hispanic men speaking in Spanish and brandishing knives ran towards him\n\nand one stabbed him twice in the ribs. At trial, Zermeno indicated that he did not know\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fthe identity of the men, and he could not identify Vizcarra as the person who stabbed\n\nhim.\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n           I. SEVEN-YEAR INCREASE IN VIZCARRA'S PRISON SENTENCE\n\n       Vizcarra claims the seven-year increase in his aggregate prison sentence\u2500from 15\n\nto 22 years\u2500following his first appeal in Vizcarra I is illegal as a matter of law, and his\n\n22-year sentence must be reduced to 15 years. The Attorney General argues that\n\nVizcarra's claim is barred by the doctrines of collateral estoppel and law of the case. We\n\nconclude those doctrines bar relitigation of Vizcarra's claim in this new appeal but\n\nexpound the reasons why we rejected the claim in Vizcarra I.\n\n       A. Doctrines of collateral estoppel and law of the case\n\n       The California Supreme Court has explained that \"[c]ollateral estoppel precludes\n\nrelitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings. [Citation.] Traditionally,\n\nwe have applied the doctrine only if several threshold requirements are fulfilled. First,\n\nthe issue sought to be precluded from relitigation must be identical to that decided in a\n\nformer proceeding. Second, this issue must have been actually litigated in the former\n\nproceeding. Third, it must have been necessarily decided in the former proceeding.\n\nFourth, the decision in the former proceeding must be final and on the merits. Finally,\n\nthe party against whom preclusion is sought must be the same as, or in privity with, the\n\nparty to the former proceeding. [Citations.] The party asserting collateral estoppel bears\n\nthe burden of establishing these requirements.\" (Lucido v. Superior Court (1990) 51\n\nCal. 3d 335, 341 (Lucido), fn. omitted.)\n\n                                              8\n\f       \"[T]he law-of-the-case doctrine 'prevents the parties from seeking appellate\n\nreconsideration of an already decided issue in the same case absent some significant\n\nchange in circumstances.' [Citation.] The doctrine is one of procedure, not jurisdiction,\n\nand it will not be applied 'where its application will result in an unjust decision, e.g.,\n\nwhere there has been a \"manifest misapplication of existing principles resulting in\n\nsubstantial injustice' [citation].\" (People v. Boyer (2006) 38 Cal. 4th 412, 441 (Boyer).)\n\n       B. Analysis\n\n       Relying principally on People v. Henderson, supra, 60 Cal. 2d 482, People v.\n\nMustafaa (1994) 22 Cal. 4th 1305 (Mustafaa), and People v. Torres (2008) 163\n\nCal. App. 4th 1420 (Torres) as he did in Vizcarra I, Vizcarra renews in this second appeal\n\nthe same claim he asserted in Vizcarra I that his sentence could not lawfully be increased\n\nfollowing his first appeal because his original 15-year aggregate sentence was within the\n\nrange of sentences the trial court was legally authorized to impose and a 15-year sentence\n\n\"could have been imposed in a legal manner on remand\" even with correction of the\n\nsentencing errors. Vizcarra acknowledges he \"raised this issue in the prior appeal in his\n\nreply brief and at oral argument.\" The Attorney General asserts, and Vizcarra does not\n\ndispute, that \"[t]his identical claim was also raised in [Vizcarra's]\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fpetition for rehearing in this court,[3] and in his petition for review in the California\n\nSupreme Court,[4] both of which were denied.\"\n\n       In Vizcarra I, rejecting Vizcarra's claim, this court concluded that the trial court\n\nerred and rendered an unauthorized sentence by (1) failing to impose a mandatory and\n\nnondiscretionary five-year enhancement under section 667(a)(1), and (2) failing to double\n\nunder the Three Strikes law the two-year sentence it imposed for Vizcarra's count 3\n\nconviction. As Vizcarra's claim was necessarily rejected in Vizcarra I, and our decision\n\nin that case is final, the doctrines of collateral estoppel and law of the case bar him from\n\nrelitigating this claim in this new appeal. (Lucido, supra, 51 Cal.3d at p. 341; Boyer,\n\nsupra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 441.)\n\n       Although this court did not expound its reasons for rejecting Vizcarra's claim in\n\nVizcarra I, application of the law-of-the-case doctrine does not lead to an unjust result.\n\n(See Boyer, supra, 38 Cal.4th at p. 441 [law-of-the-case doctrine will not be applied\n\nwhere its application will result in an unjust decision].) As noted, Vizcarra asserted his\n\nclaim in Vizcarra I in his reply brief, at oral argument, and in his petition for rehearing.\n\nVizcarra was afforded ample opportunity to argue this issue in his prior appeal and, as he\n\n\n\n\n3      The record in Vizcarra I, of which we take judicial notice, shows Vizcarra raised\nthis same claim in his petition for rehearing.\n\n4     As noted, ante, the California Supreme Court denied Vizcarra's petition for review\n(People v. Vizcarra, S211630) on August 21, 2013.\n                                              10\n\fhas not shown any significant change in circumstances, adherence to the law of the case\n\nin Vizcarra I will not result in an unjust decision.\n\n       Application of the law-of-the-case doctrine (like application of the doctrine of\n\ncollateral estoppel) does not lead to an unjust result for the additional reason that, under\n\nwell-established law, Vizcarra's claim is unavailing on the merits. (See Boyer, supra, 38\n\nCal.4th at p. 441 [law-of-the-case doctrine will not be applied where there has been a\n\nmanifest misapplication of existing principles resulting in substantial injustice].)\n\n       \"Section 1238 'governs the People's appeals from orders or judgments of the\n\nsuperior courts. [Citation.] Subdivision (a)(10) of section 1238 provides that the People\n\nmay appeal from '[t]he imposition of an unlawful sentence,' and defines an 'unlawful\n\nsentence' as 'the imposition of a sentence not authorized by law or the imposition of a\n\nsentence based upon an unlawful order of the court which strikes or otherwise modifies\n\nthe effect of an enhancement or prior conviction.'\" (People v. Trujillo (2006) 40 Cal. 4th\n\n165, 172, fn. omitted, italics added.) When a trial court pronounces a sentence that is\n\nunauthorized by law, the People may raise the point on defendant's appeal as they did\n\nhere. (See People v. Benton (1979) 100 Cal. App. 3d 92, 102 (Benton); People v. Cabral\n\n(1975) 51 Cal. App. 3d 707, 718 (Cabral).)\n\n       Under the general rule of state constitutional law that the California Supreme\n\nCourt has referred to as the Henderson rule, \"[w]hen a defendant successfully appeals a\n\ncriminal conviction, California's constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy\n\nprecludes the imposition of more severe punishment on resentencing.\" (People v.\n\nHanson (2000) 23 Cal. 4th 355, 357 (Hanson), citing Henderson, supra, 60 Cal.2d at pp.\n\n                                              11\n\f495-497, italics added;5 see People v. Sol\u00f3rzano (2007) 153 Cal. App. 4th 1026, 1040\n\n(Sol\u00f3rzano) [\"If a defendant successfully challenges his or her conviction on appeal and\n\nsecures a new trial, the due process and double jeopardy clauses of the California\n\nConstitution generally prohibit the imposition of a harsher sentence after retrial.\" (Italics\n\nadded.)].) The Henderson court explained that the rationale for this general rule is two-\n\nfold: \"[T]he state has no interest in preserving erroneous judgments\" (Henderson, at p.\n\n497), and \"[a] defendant's right of appeal from an erroneous judgment is unreasonably\n\nimpaired\" (ibid.) if he or she risks \"more severe sentence on retrial.\" (Id. at p. 497, italics\n\nadded; see People v. Collins (1978) 21 Cal. 3d 208, 216 [\"'a defendant should not be\n\nrequired to risk being given greater punishment on a retrial for the privilege of exercising\n\nhis right to appeal'\" (italics added)].)\n\n       However, in People v. Serrato (1973) 9 Cal. 3d 753, 764 (Serrato), disapproved on\n\nanother point in People v. Fosselman (1983) 33 Cal. 3d 572, 583, the California Supreme\n\nCourt \"set out an exception to this general [Henderson] rule.\" (People v. Price (1986)\n\n184 Cal. App. 3d 1405, 1409.) In Serrato, after discussing the Henderson rule, the\n\nSupreme Court explained that \"[t]he rule is otherwise when a trial court pronounces an\n\nunauthorized sentence. Such a sentence is subject to being set aside judicially and is no\n\n\n\n5       In Hanson the Supreme Court explained that the Henderson defendant \"secured\nreversal of his murder conviction for which he had been sentenced to life in prison.\nFollowing retrial, he was again convicted of murder but was sentenced to receive the\ndeath penalty. On appeal, he argued the increased punishment violated the state's\nprohibition against double jeopardy, and this court agreed.\" (Hanson, supra, 23 Cal.4th\nat p. 358, fn. omitted.)\n\n                                              12\n\fbar to the imposition of a proper judgment thereafter, even though it is more severe than\n\nthe original unauthorized pronouncement.\" (Serrato, at p. 764, italics added.) In\n\nreaffirming the Serrato exception to the Henderson rule, our high state court stated in In\n\nre Ricky H. (1981) 30 Cal. 3d 176, that \"[a]uthority exists for an appellate court to correct\n\na sentence that is not authorized by law whenever the error comes to the attention of the\n\ncourt, even if the correction creates the possibility of a more severe punishment.\" (Id. at\n\np. 191, italics added.)\n\n       In People v. Massengale (1970) 10 Cal. App. 3d 689 (Massengale), the Court of\n\nAppeal explained that \"such a correction of the judgment is not a penalty imposed upon\n\nappellants because of their appeals. The rationale of [Henderson, supra], 60 Cal. 2d 482,\n\nforbidding increased punishment after a reversal and second trial, does not apply. The\n\ncorrection in the judgment[] . . . would be required whenever the mistake was discovered,\n\nregardless of whether . . . [the] defendant[] had appealed.\" (Id. at p. 693, italics added;\n\naccord, Cabral, supra, 51 Cal.App.3d at p. 718.)\n\n       It is well-established in California by a long line of decisional authority\n\n(discussed, post) that a trial court's failure either (1) to pronounce sentence on a statutory\n\nsentence enhancement allegation based upon a finding by the trier of fact or an admission\n\nby the defendant that the allegation is true, or (2) to exercise its discretion\u2500to the extent\n\nimposition of the enhancement is discretionary\u2500to either strike the enhancement\n\nallegation or impose the enhancement, results in an unauthorized sentence. Under the\n\nSerrato exception to the Henderson rule, as already explained, such an unauthorized\n\nsentence is subject to correction by an appellate court \"whenever the error comes to the\n\n                                              13\n\fattention of the court, even if the correction creates the possibility of a more severe\n\npunishment.\" (In re Ricky H., supra, 30 Cal.3d at p. 191.)\n\n       For example in Benton, supra, 100 Cal. App. 3d 92, which was decided in 1979, the\n\nCourt of Appeal held that the defendant's aggregate four-year state prison sentence was\n\n\"unauthorized by law\" because the defendant had admitted five charged prior felony\n\nconvictions and the trial court was required to impose an additional consecutive one-year\n\nprison term for each prior conviction pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b) (hereafter\n\nsection 667.5(b)), but the trial court erroneously \"(1) failed to pronounce judgment on all\n\nfive priors and (2) stayed all but two years of [the defendant's] prison term, without\n\njustification.\" (Id. at pp. 100-101.) Concluding that \"[t]he record [did] not support\n\n[defendant's] contention that it was the trial court's intent to mitigate the additional\n\npunishment\" (id. at p. 102), the Benton court remanded the cause to the trial court with\n\ndirections to either \"strike the additional punishment upon finding circumstances in\n\nmitigation and stating on the record its reasons therefor [or] impose sentence on the priors\n\nin the manner provided by law.\" (Id. at p. 103.)\n\n       In People v. Price, supra, 184 Cal. App. 3d 1405, decided in 1986, the defendant\n\nwas convicted of four sex offenses and two robberies, and sentence enhancement\n\nallegations that he personally used a weapon in committing all of the crimes were found\n\nto be true. (Id. at p. 1407.) At the original sentencing, the trial court imposed an\n\naggregate prison term of 35 years. (Id. at p. 1407.) On defendant's first appeal, the Court\n\nof Appeal affirmed his convictions but remanded the cause for resentencing because the\n\ntrial court had erroneously stayed imposition of the weapon enhancement as to two of the\n\n                                              14\n\fcounts and failed to even mention the weapon enhancement as to another count. (Id. at p.\n\n1411.) The trial court at resentencing imposed a more severe 50-year aggregate prison\n\nterm. (Id. at p. 1407.) The defendant appealed again, claiming the double jeopardy\n\nclause of the California Constitution barred the trial court at resentencing from imposing\n\na greater prison term than he originally received. (Id. at p. 1408.) Rejecting that claim\n\nbut reducing the new sentence to a 47-year prison term for reasons not pertinent here, the\n\nPrice court\u2500citing Serrato, supra, 9 Cal. 3d 753 and Benton, supra, 100 Cal. App. 3d\n\n92\u2500concluded that the original sentencing court's erroneous \"failure . . . to impose [the]\n\nweapon enhancements\" (Price, at p. 1409) as to two counts and its failure to pronounce\n\nsentence regarding the enhancement as to another count \"produced an unauthorized\n\nsentence\" (id. at p. 1412) that \"[could] be rectified on remand.\" (Price, at p. 1411, italics\n\nadded.) \"Consequently,\" the Price court explained, \"the sentencing court on remand had\n\nthe power to impose a harsher term and was correct in doing so.\" (Id. at p. 1412, italics\n\nadded.)\n\n       In People v. Irvin (1991) 230 Cal. App. 3d 180 (Irvin), the trial court sentenced the\n\ndefendant to an aggregate prison term of 16 years, which the defendant challenged on\n\nappeal. (Id. at p. 188.) The Court of Appeal\u2500agreeing with the Attorney General and\n\nciting Benton, supra, 100 Cal. App. 3d 92 and Price, supra, 184 Cal. App. 3d\n\n1405\u2500concluded that the trial court had erroneously failed to either impose a one-year\n\nprior prison term enhancement (\u00a7 667.5(b)) or strike it pursuant to cited statutory\n\nauthority not pertinent here. (Irvin, at pp. 188-189.) The Irvin court held that \"the failure\n\nto impose the one-year enhancement or to strike it . . . resulted in a sentence unauthorized\n\n                                             15\n\fby law and . . . the case should be remanded so that the court may make a proper\n\nsentencing choice.\" (Id. at p. 190, italics added.) In a limited remand, the Irvin court\n\nordered the trial court \"to determine whether to impose a one-year enhancement sentence\n\npursuant to section 667.5[(b)], or to strike the enhancement finding pursuant . . . .\" (Id. at\n\np. 193.)\n\n       In People v. Dotson (1997) 16 Cal. 4th 547, 550 (Dotson), which is of particular\n\nrelevance here, the trial court found to be true an allegation that the defendant had\n\nsuffered four prior serious felony convictions within the meaning of section 667(a)(1),\n\nthe five-year sentence enhancement statute at issue in the present appeal.6 At sentencing\n\nthe trial court did not impose a separate determinate term of 20 years for the four five-\n\nyear enhancements and sentenced the defendant to an aggregate prison term of 26 years\n\nto life. (Dotson at p. 551.) The Court of Appeal modified the judgment in certain\n\nrespects not pertinent here, and the California Supreme Court granted the Attorney\n\nGeneral's petition for review in which the Attorney General argued for the first time that\n\n\n\n6      Section 667(a)(1) then provided in part, as it does today: \"[A]ny person convicted\nof a serious felony who previously has been convicted of a serious felony . . . shall\nreceive, in addition to the sentence imposed by the court for the present offense, a five-\nyear enhancement for each such prior conviction on charges brought and tried separately.\nThe terms of the present offense and each enhancement shall run consecutively.\"\n       As this court explained in Vizcarra I, \"[u]nder section 667(a)(1)], when the\ndefendant is convicted of a current serious felony . . . and has been previously convicted\nof a serious felony, the trial court must impose a five-year enhancement for each such\nprior conviction that was brought and tried separately. The terms of the present offense\nand each section 667(a)[(1)] enhancement must run consecutively.\" (Dotson, supra, 16\nCal.4th at p. 553, italics added, fn. omitted.) \"The trial court has no discretion and the\nsentence is mandatory.\" (People v. Purata (1996) 42 Cal. App. 4th 489, 498.)\" (Italics\nadded.)\n                                             16\n\fthe four five-year section 667(a)(1) enhancements should be imposed as a separate\n\ndeterminate term. (Dotson at pp. 551, 554 & fn. 6.) The Supreme Court agreed, citing In\n\nre Ricky H. (supra, 30 Cal. 3d 176) and Serrato (supra, 9 Cal. 3d 753) for the proposition\n\nthat \"[a] claim that a sentence is unauthorized . . . may be raised for the first time on\n\nappeal, and is subject to judicial correction whenever the error comes to the attention of\n\nthe reviewing court.\" (Dotson, at p. 554, fn. 6, italics added.) The Dotson court reversed\n\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeal and directed that court to remand the case to the trial\n\ncourt for resentencing. (Id. at p. 560.)\n\n       In People v. Bradley (1998) 64 Cal. App. 4th 386 (Bradley), a jury convicted the\n\ndefendant of forgery and a related offense, and found he had previously served four prior\n\nprison terms within the meaning of section 667.5(b), the applicable sentence enhancing\n\nstatute. (Bradley, at p. 390.) In sentencing the defendant to an aggregate prison term (the\n\ntotal years of which is not discussed in the published portion of the Court of Appeal's\n\nopinion), the trial court imposed three of the four one-year prior prison term\n\nenhancements but did not indicate the disposition as to the fourth enhancement. (Ibid.)\n\nOn defendant's appeal, the Attorney General argued the trial court erred in failing to\n\nimpose the fourth one-year section 667.5(b) enhancement. (Ibid.) Citing Irvin, supra,\n\n230 Cal. App. 3d 180 and Mustafaa, supra, 22 Cal. App. 4th 1305\u2500and noting that \"section\n\n667.5[(b)] enhancements are subject to the exercise of the trial court's discretion to strike\n\npursuant to section 1385[(a)]\"\u2500the Court of Appeal explained in Bradley that \"[t]he\n\nfailure to impose or strike an enhancement is a legally unauthorized sentence subject to\n\ncorrection for the first time on appeal.\" (Bradley, at p. 391, italics added.) Citing the\n\n                                              17\n\fSupreme Court's decision in Dotson, supra, 16 Cal. 4th 547, the Bradley court concluded\n\nthat the trial court's \"refusal to sentence was legally unauthorized.\" (Bradley, at p. 392,\n\nitalics added.) Again citing Irvin, supra, 230 Cal.App.3d at page 193, the Court of\n\nAppeal remanded the cause to the trial court for what it referred to as a \"limited\n\nresentencing\" (Bradley, at p. 391) and directed the trial court to \"either impose or strike\n\nthe prior prison term enhancement . . . in compliance with California law.\" (Id. at p.\n\n401.)\n\n        Two other more recent cases are relevant here. In People v. Morales (2003) 106\n\nCal. App. 4th 445 (Morales), which is directly on point (as we explained in Vizcarra I), a\n\njury convicted the defendant of committing three felony counts of annoying or molesting\n\na child, as charged in the amended information. (Id. at p. 447.) The jury found the\n\ndefendant had suffered two prior violent felony convictions of child molestation that were\n\nstrikes under the Three Strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12). (Morales, at p.\n\n447.) The trial court struck one of the two prior strike findings in the interest of justice\n\n(\u00a7 1385(a)) and, in sentencing the defendant, doubled under the Three Strikes law the\n\nprison term it imposed for the count 2 conviction, as required by sections 667,\n\nsubdivision (e)(1) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1). (Morales, at p. 447.) However,\n\nbecause the information did not allege the prosecution was seeking enhanced recidivist\n\nsentencing under the Three Strikes law as to counts 1 and 3, the trial court did not double\n\nthe sentences it imposed as to those two remaining counts. (Id. at pp. 447, 455.) The\n\nCourt of Appeal reversed the sentence as to those counts and remanded the matter for\n\nresentencing, holding that \"once the jury found defendant had previously been convicted\n\n                                              18\n\fof a violent felony, the sentence as to all counts should have been doubled pursuant to\n\nsections 667, subdivision (e)(1) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(1), subject to the trial\n\ncourt's exercise of its section 1385, subdivision (a) power to strike the prior conviction\n\nfinding.\" (Morales, at pp. 447-448, italics added.)\n\n       In Sol\u00f3rzano, supra, 153 Cal. App. 4th 1026, which was decided in 2007 and is also\n\non point, a jury convicted the defendant at his first trial of four counts of second degree\n\nrobbery and found true all but one of numerous sentencing enhancement allegations. (Id.\n\nat p. 1029.) As pertinent here, the jury found true an allegation in each of the four counts\n\nthat the defendant had suffered a prior serious felony conviction within the meaning of\n\nsection 667(a)(1). (Sol\u00f3rzano, at p. 1029.) At the original sentencing, the trial court\n\nimposed an aggregate sentence consisting of four consecutive indeterminate prison terms\n\nof 25 years to life plus a determinate term of six years eight months. (Id. at p. 1040.) In\n\nimposing that aggregate sentence, the trial court imposed only one of the four five-year\n\nsection 667(a)(1) enhancements. (Sol\u00f3rzano, at pp. 1040, 1041.) On the defendant's first\n\nappeal, the Court of Appeal reversed his convictions and remanded the cause for a new\n\ntrial. (Id. at p. 1029.) At the second trial, a jury again convicted the defendant of four\n\ncounts of second degree robbery and found to be true all of the sentence enhancement\n\nallegations, including the four section 667(a)(1) allegations. (Sol\u00f3rzano, at p. 1029.) At\n\nresentencing the trial court imposed a harsher aggregate sentence consisting of four\n\nconsecutive indeterminate prison terms of 25 years to life plus a determinate term of 23\n\nyears, which included a 20-year determinate term for the four mandatory and consecutive\n\nfive-year prior-serious-felony-conviction enhancements under section 667(a)(1).\n\n                                             19\n\f(Sol\u00f3rzano, at p. 1040.) The defendant again appealed, claiming the due process and\n\ndouble jeopardy clauses of the California Constitution prohibited the imposition of a\n\nsentence harsher than his original sentence. (Id. at p. 1039.) Rejecting that claim, the\n\nSol\u00f3rzano court held that the trial court's error at the original sentencing in failing to\n\nimpose three of the four five-year enhancements under section 667(a) \"created a sentence\n\nthat was not legally authorized\" (Sol\u00f3rzano, at p. 1041) and, thus, the Serrato exception\n\nto the Henderson rule \"applie[d], allowing the imposition of a harsher sentence after\n\nretrial.\" (Ibid.)\n\n       Here, under the Serrato exception to the Henderson rule and the foregoing\n\ndecisional authorities, the trial court's two errors at the original sentencing\u2500i.e., failing to\n\nimpose the mandatory, consecutive and nondiscretionary five-year enhancement under\n\nsection 667(a)(1) and failing to either double to four years Vizcarra's two-year count 3\n\nsentence or let the two-year sentence stand after exercising its discretion under section\n\n1385(a) to strike the strike prior on remand as to that count\u2500resulted in a sentence that\n\nwas not authorized by law and thus was subject to correction in Vizcarra I even though at\n\nresentencing on remand \"the correction create[d] the possibility of a more severe\n\npunishment\" (In re Ricky H., supra, 30 Cal.3d at p. 191). Such correction of the\n\njudgment was not, as Vizcarra contends it was, a penalty imposed upon him because of\n\nhis first appeal. The correction would have been required by law \"whenever the mistake\n\nwas discovered, regardless of whether . . . [Vizcarra] had appealed\" and, thus, \"[t]he\n\nrationale of [Henderson, supra], 60 Cal. 2d 482, forbidding increased punishment after a\n\nreversal and second trial, does not apply.\" (Massengale, supra, 10 Cal.App.3d at p. 693,\n\n                                               20\n\fitalics added; accord, Cabral, supra, 51 Cal.App.3d at p. 718.) The Henderson rule does\n\nnot apply for the additional reason that none of the verdicts in this case was reversed in\n\nVizcarra I. (See Hanson, supra, 23 Cal.4th at p. 357 [\"When a defendant successfully\n\nappeals a criminal conviction, California's constitutional prohibition against double\n\njeopardy precludes the imposition of more severe punishment on resentencing.\"], citing\n\nHenderson, supra, 60 Cal.2d at pp. 495-497; People v. Burbine (2003) 106 Cal. App. 4th\n\n1250, 1258-1259 [\"[C]ase law holds that, based on double jeopardy and due process, the\n\naggregate prison term imposed for all of the surviving counts cannot be increased on\n\nremand after a partial reversal, a circumstance appellant does not contend occurred\n\nhere.\"].)\n\n       Vizcarra's reliance on Torres, supra, 163 Cal. App. 4th 1420 and this court's\n\ndecision in Mustafaa, supra, 22 Cal. App. 4th 1305 is unavailing. Torres is legally and\n\nfactually distinguishable and has no application here. In that case a jury convicted the\n\ndefendant of one count of attempting to dissuade a witness and one count of issuing a\n\ncriminal threat, and as to each count it found a gang enhancement allegation to be true.\n\n(Torres, at p. 1421.) At sentencing the trial court struck the gang enhancement\n\nallegations, imposed what it believed was the upper state prison term of seven years for\n\nthe criminal threat conviction after relying on the People's claim that seven years was the\n\naggravated term, and imposed but stayed the middle term for the conviction of attempting\n\nto dissuade a witness. (Id. at p. 1427.) Neither the defendant nor the People appealed.\n\n(Id. at pp. 1421-1422.) More than a year later, \"the Department of Corrections and\n\nRehabilitation sent a letter to the trial court asking for clarification of the defendant's\n\n                                               21\n\fsentence because the sentence imposed was higher than that allowed by the sentencing\n\ntriad applicable to the underlying conviction.\" (Id. at pp. 1422, 1427.) The trial court\n\nrecalled the sentence under section 1170, subdivision (d) (hereafter section 1170(d)),\n\nordered that the defendant be brought back to court, and\u2500at resentencing\u2500refused to\n\nstrike the gang enhancements and then imposed a harsher indeterminate sentence of life\n\nin prison with the minimum term of seven years. (Torres, at pp. 1421, 1428.) The\n\ndefendant appealed. (Id. at p. 1422.) The Court of Appeal affirmed the defendant's\n\nconvictions but remanded the cause for resentencing, concluding that the trial court\n\n\"erred in imposing a sentence of seven years to life after it recalled defendant's sentence\n\nof seven years in prison\" (id. at p. 1433, italics added) and stating that \"[o]n remand, the\n\ntrial court may not impose a total sentence greater than seven years in prison.\" (Ibid.)\n\nThe Torres court explained that \"when a sentence is recalled [under section 1170(d)], the\n\ncourt may resentence the defendant as if he or she had not previously been sentenced,\n\nwith the limitation that the new sentence may not exceed the initial sentence.\" (Torres, at\n\npp. 1428-1429, italics added.) Explaining that \"[t]he one unauthorized component of the\n\nsentence originally imposed by the court was not lenient\u2500it was in fact more severe than\n\nthat authorized (the correct upper term for count 3 being three years rather than seven)\"\n\n(id. at p. 1432), the Torres court concluded that the aggregate sentence of seven years\n\nimposed at the original sentencing hearing was \"not a legally unauthorized lenient\n\nsentence.\" (Ibid.)\n\n       Torres is distinguishable in that, unlike the present case, it involved a recall by the\n\ntrial court of the original sentence under section 1170(d), which provides for resentencing\n\n                                             22\n\fsubject to \"the limitation that the new sentence may not exceed the initial sentence.\"\n\n(Torres, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1428-1429.) Torres is also distinguishable in that\n\nthe original aggregate sentence included an unauthorized component\u2500the seven-year\n\nterm that exceeded the statutory upper term of three years\u2500whereas, here, the original\n\naggregate sentence was unauthorized because it did not include a mandatory,\n\nnondiscretionary, consecutive five-year enhancement (\u00a7 667(a)(1)) and the trial court\n\nfailed to either double an imposed prison term (i.e., the count 3 two-year term) under the\n\nThree Strikes law or strike the defendant's strike prior and allow that punishment to stand.\n\nThus, unlike the original sentence in the present case, the original sentence in Torres was\n\nnot unauthorized within the meaning of the Serrato exception to the Henderson rule.\n\n       Mustafaa is distinguishable because in that case, as this court explained, the trial\n\ncourt \"imposed a legal aggregate sentence, only fashioning it in an unauthorized manner\"\n\n(Mustafaa, supra, 22 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1311-1312) by separating the defendant's three\n\nrobbery convictions from their attached personal gun-use enhancements and imposing\n\nconsecutive sentences for the enhancements but imposing concurrent sentences for the\n\nrobbery convictions to which they were attached. (Ibid.) Thus, the Serrata exception to\n\nthe Henderson rule did not apply in Mustafaa. (Ibid.)\n\n       In the present case, the fact that the trial court at the original sentencing\n\ntheoretically could have imposed an aggregate 15-year sentence as an authorized\n\nsentence does not mean that the 15-year sentence the court actually imposed at the\n\noriginal sentencing was an authorized sentence. For reasons we have explained, the 15-\n\nyear sentence the court imposed at the original sentencing was an unauthorized sentence\n\n                                              23\n\fwithin the meaning of the Serrato exception to the Henderson rule because (1) the court\n\nerroneously failed to impose a mandatory, consecutive, and nondiscretionary five-year\n\nenhancement under section 667(a)(1) based upon the finding that Vizcarra had suffered a\n\nprior serious felony conviction; and (2) the court also erroneously failed to either double\n\nthe count 3 two-year prison term under the Three Strikes law or strike Vizcarra's strike\n\nprior and allow that punishment to stand.\n\n       For all of the foregoing reasons, we reject Vizcarra's claim that the seven-year\n\nincrease in his aggregate prison sentence\u2500from 15 to 22 years\u2500following his first appeal\n\nin Vizcarra I is illegal as a matter of law.\n\nII. CLAIM THAT THE COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION DURING RESENTENCING\n\n       Vizcarra also contends the court abused its discretion in resentencing him on\n\nremand \"by failing to complete a full sentencing analysis and by relying on improper\n\nsentencing considerations.\" Specifically, he complains that, \"[o]n remand, the trial court\n\nwas singularly focused on the decision of whether to double [his] Count 3 sentence\" and\n\nthat \"[t]he court did not consider whether to modify any other aspect of the sentence.\"\n\nVizcarra's contention is unavailing.\n\n       A. Background\n\n       1. Remand for resentencing\n\n       In Vizcarra I, as already discussed, we affirmed Vizcarra's convictions of counts 2\n\nand 3 and the true findings on various enhancement allegations, but we found the original\n\n15-year aggregate sentence was unauthorized for reasons we explained, corrected the\n\njudgment to impose the mandatory, nondiscretionary and consecutive five-year prior\n\n                                               24\n\fserious felony enhancement (\u00a7 667(a)(1)), reversed his consecutive count 3 two-year\n\nsentence, and remanded this case for resentencing. As pertinent here, the remand\n\nlanguage in the disposition portion of our opinion directed the court, as follows, to\n\nconduct a resentencing \"subject to the court's exercise of its section 1385[(a)] power to\n\nstrike the prior conviction finding\" as to count 3:\n\n          \"As a result of the trial court's erroneous failure to double under the\n          Three Strikes law the two-year sentence it imposed for Vizcarra's\n          count 3 conviction (\u00a7 136.1(a)(2)), his count 3 sentence is reversed,\n          and the matter is remanded to the trial court for resentencing subject\n          to the court's exercise of its section 1385[(a)] power to strike the\n          prior conviction finding. The judgment is also modified to impose\n          under section 667, subdivision (a)(1), a five-year consecutive term\n          for Vizcarra's serious felony prior conviction.\" (Italics added.)\n\n       On remand the trial court conducted a new sentencing hearing on January 17,\n\n2014. Defense counsel argued that the court in the exercise of its discretion should strike\n\nVizcarra's prior strike conviction \"as to Count 3 [(dissuading a witness)] only\" in the\n\ninterest of justice pursuant to section 1385(a) and Romero, supra, 13 Cal. 4th 497.\n\nDefense counsel asserted that when Vizcarra \"was originally sentenced,\" the court and\n\nthe prosecutor \"thought that a 15-year sentence was fair and just.\" Asking the court not\n\nto \"pile on\" by doubling the original count 3 sentence (to four years) under the Three\n\nStrikes law, defense counsel also asserted that Vizcarra was \"stuck with the additional\n\nfive years [under section 667(a)(1)] on top of what we all thought was a fair and just\n\nsentence,\" and thus dismissal of the strike prior would be in the furtherance of justice.\n\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\f       Noting it understood that Vizcarra \"would be looking at 15 years right now\" had\n\nhe not appealed, the court responded, \"I know I have Romero discretion,\" and added, \"I'm\n\nvery familiar with what the discretion is and what criteria I should look at.\"\n\n       In opposing Vizcarra's Romero motion to strike his prior strike, the prosecutor\n\nargued that in the statement in aggravation that the People filed for the initial sentencing,\n\n\"they were very specific and clear . . . that [Vizcarra] deserves the maximum sentence\n\nallowed by law, and we gave reasons.\" She then summarized the reasons why Vizcarra\n\n\"falls within the intent and purpose behind the [Three Strikes] law.\" First, she argued,\n\n\"he had a prior strike conviction for robbery in 2009, which is what was found by the\n\nCourt to be true.\" Next, she argued, Vizcarra \"was convicted [in another specified case\n\nof] assault with a deadly weapon, which is the case he picked up . . . while he was in\n\ncustody on this case.\" Then, she asserted, \"[y]ou have this current case that happened in\n\n2010, a stabbing with a knife.\" The prosecutor told the court, \"So you have three very\n\nviolent crimes within a very short period of time, which demonstrates the fact that\n\n[Vizcarra] does not have any regard for human life, is not remorseful, [and] continues to\n\nact out in a very violent nature.\" She then argued that, \"[f]or the safety and protection of\n\nthe public, this Court should follow the [L]egislature's lead and double the term as to\n\nCount 3.\"\n\n       Reminding the court that Vizcarra was convicted in count 3 of attempting to\n\ndissuade a witness, the prosecutor also argued there was \"a collateral impact of\n\n[Vizcarra's] conduct as to Count 3.\" She stated \"[t]here was evidence at trial that\n\ndemonstrated that [Vizcarra] made calls while in the jail to dissuade the victim\" and \"the\n\n                                             26\n\fvictim actually was in fear.\" She further explained that the victim attempted to commit\n\nsuicide \"just prior to his testimony at trial\" as a result of Vizcarra's conduct. The\n\nprosecutor urged the court to \"exercise your discretion under [section 1385(a)] to double\n\n[the two-year] Count 3 [sentence].\"\n\n       Defense counsel argued in rebuttal that the \"lack of notice\" regarding a doubling\n\nof the count 3 sentence under the Three Strikes law violated Vizcarra's constitutional\n\nrights, and this factor should be considered in determining whether to dismiss the strike\n\nprior in the interest of justice under section 1385(a) and Romero.\n\n       The court responded that it could not consider the notice issue \"because the Court\n\nof Appeal has essentially already done that.\" The court stated that \"the case ha[d] been\n\nremanded by the Court of Appeal to exercise my discretion under Romero whether to\n\ndouble Count 3\" and indicated it was required to follow certain criteria in exercising its\n\ndiscretion.\n\n       In exercising its discretion under section 1385(a) and making its resentencing\n\ndecision, the court stated, \"I looked at everything.\" Specifically, the court stated it\n\n\"looked at the probation report,\" recalled the details of the trial and Vizcarra's conduct\n\nand the circumstances regarding his current offenses, and reviewed this court's Vizcarra I\n\nopinion that \"brought to light all of the facts and circumstances\" surrounding count 3.\n\n       Referring to Vizcarra's strike prior as it related to his count 3 conviction of\n\nattempting to dissuade a witness, the court stated that, \"had it been alleged at the time, I\n\nwould have doubled the sentence. There is no doubt about that.\" (Italics added.)\n\n\n\n                                              27\n\f       On the issue of whether it should double the two-year term it originally imposed\n\nfor Vizcarra's count 3 conviction, the court considered the nature and circumstances\n\nsurrounding the offense, noting it \"still remember[ed] the details of the intimidation,\"\n\nwhich was \"persistent\" in that Vizcarra had made \"several different calls\" in \"trying to get\n\nout from this very serious stabbing where the victim could have very easily been killed.\"\n\nRecalling the trial evidence pertaining to the attempted murder charge alleged in count 1,\n\nof which Vizcarra was acquitted, the court observed that Vizcarra was \"very fortunate he\n\ndidn't get convicted\" of attempted murder, and stated, \"I think that the reason for that was\n\nthat this [multiple stabbing of the victim] was a rash and impulsive act on his part.\"7\n\n       The court also considered Vizcarra's prior record, noting that he had \"a number of\n\nvery serious charges in his life.\" The record showed that Vizcarra \"was in custody when\n\nthis occurred\" and \"[h]e was still entrenched and significantly in gang activity while he\n\nwas in custody.\"\n\n       The court denied Vizcarra's Romero motion to strike the prior strike, stating, \"I\n\ndon't see any basis to not impose the doubling of the sentence under [the Three Strikes\n\nlaw].\" The court doubled the count 3 two-year prison term to four years and imposed an\n\naggregate sentence of 22 years in prison.\n\n\n\n\n7      As we explained in Vizcarra I, the evidence showed that Vizcarra stabbed the\nvictim twice in the ribs with a knife, causing him to suffer a collapsed lung and to be\nhospitalized for about two weeks.\n\n                                             28\n\f       B. Analysis\n\n       \"On remand with directions, after a judgment on appeal, the trial court has\n\njurisdiction only to follow the directions of the appellate court; it cannot modify, or add\n\nto, those directions.\" (People v. Oppenheimer (1965) 236 Cal. App. 2d 863, 865-866 [on\n\nremand, trial court had jurisdiction only to entertain a new application for probation].)\n\n       Here, in Vizcarra I we reversed the sentence as to count 3 and remanded this case\n\n\"for resentencing subject to the court's exercise of its section 1385, subdivision (a) power\n\nto strike the prior conviction finding.\"8 On remand, the trial court recognized the limited\n\nscope of the new sentencing hearing. It correctly determined that the limited scope of its\n\njurisdiction on remand precluded it from modifying other aspects of Vizcarra's sentence\n\nbeyond count 3.\n\n       As noted, Vizcarra contends the court abused its discretion in resentencing him on\n\nremand \"by failing to complete a full sentencing analysis and by relying on improper\n\nsentencing considerations.\" Relying principally on Torres, supra, 163 Cal. App. 4th 1420,\n\nPeople v. Hill (1986) 185 Cal. App. 4th 831, and Burbine, supra, 106 Cal. App. 4th 1250,\n\n\n\n8      In a footnote we explained that \"[a] trial court may dismiss prior felony conviction\nallegations in cases prosecuted under the Three Strikes law when dismissal is 'in\nfurtherance of justice.' (\u00a7 1385, subd. (a); see [Romero, supra,] 13 Cal.4th [at pp.] 529-\n530.) In deciding whether to dismiss prior conviction allegations, the court 'must\nconsider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies and\nprior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background,\ncharacter, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the scheme's spirit, in\nwhole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been\nconvicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies.' (People v. Williams (1998) 17\nCal. 4th 148, 161.)\"\n\n                                             29\n\fhe complains that, \"[o]n remand, the trial court was singularly focused on the decision of\n\nwhether to double [his] Count 3 sentence\" and that \"[t]he court did not consider whether\n\nto modify any other aspect of the sentence.\" We reject Vizcarra's contention. Torres and\n\nHill are distinguishable because in each of those cases, unlike in the present case, the trial\n\ncourt recalled the defendant's sentence under section 1170(d). As Torres explained,\n\n\"when a sentence is recalled [under section 1170(d)], the court may resentence the\n\ndefendant as if he or she had not previously been sentenced, with the limitation that the\n\nnew sentence may not exceed the initial sentence.\" (Torres, at pp. 1428-1429, italics\n\nadded.)\n\n       Vizcarra's reliance on Burbine is also misplaced. In Burbine the Court of Appeal\n\nstated: \"[W]e endorse the notion that trial courts are, and should be, afforded discretion\n\nby rule and statute to reconsider an entire sentencing structure in multicount cases where\n\na portion of the original verdict . . . has been vacated by a higher court.\" (Burbine,\n\nsupra, 106 Cal.App.4th at p. 1258, italics added.) Here, no portion of the original verdict\n\nhas been vacated by a higher court. Furthermore, as already discussed, the courts in\n\nCalifornia have long approved limited remands for the correction of unauthorized\n\nsentences. (Bradley, supra, 64 Cal.App.4th at pp. 392, 401; Irvin, supra, 230 Cal.App.3d\n\nat p. 193; Benton, supra, 100 Cal.App.3d at pp. 102-103.)\n\n       We conclude Vizcarra has failed to show that the court on remand abused its\n\ndiscretion by by failing to complete a full sentencing analysis. Having reviewed the\n\nrecord we also conclude he has failed to demonstrate the court prejudicially abused its\n\ndiscretion by relying on impermissible factors. We note that during the hearing on\n\n                                             30\n\fVizcarra's Romero motion to strike the strike prior during resentencing, the\n\ncourt\u2500referring to the strike prior as it related to his count 3 conviction of attempting to\n\ndissuade a witness\u2500stated that, \"had it been alleged at the time, I would have doubled the\n\nsentence. There is no doubt about that.\" (Italics added.) For all of the foregoing\n\nreasons, we affirm the judgment.\n\n                             III. ABSTRACT OF JUDGMENT\n\n       Once again we find errors in the abstract of judgment. The Attorney General\n\nrequests that this court correct two errors in the new abstract of judgment. Specifically,\n\nthe Attorney General asserts that, \"[a]lthough the abstract of judgment indicates a total\n\nterm of 22 years, it fails to reflect the doubled terms in counts 2 and 3. Accordingly, this\n\ncourt should correct the clerical errors in the abstract of judgment to accurately reflect the\n\ntrial court's oral pronouncement.\"\n\n       We agree the new abstract of judgment should be corrected. The abstract correctly\n\nreflects that the court on remand resentenced Vizcarra to an aggregate prison term of 22\n\nyears. However, the court originally sentenced Vizcarra to the term of four years for his\n\ncount 2 conviction of assault with a deadly weapon, doubled to eight years under the\n\nThree Strikes law as a result of the court's true finding on the count 2 strike prior\n\nallegation. On remand Vizcarra's eight-year count 2 sentence did not change, and, thus,\n\nthe new abstract of judgment should reflect this count 2 sentence. Section \"1.\" of the\n\nabstract, however, incorrectly reflects that Vizcarra was sentenced to a four-year prison\n\nterm for his count 2 conviction. Accordingly, this portion of the abstract should be\n\n\n\n                                              31\n\fcorrected to reflect that Vizcarra was sentenced to a prison term of eight years for his\n\ncount 2 conviction.\n\n       During resentencing the court imposed the consecutive term of two years for\n\nVizcarra's count 3 conviction of attempting to dissuade a victim or witness, and doubled\n\nthat term to four years under the Three Strikes law. Section \"1.\" of the abstract, however,\n\nincorrectly reflects that Vizcarra was sentenced to a consecutive two-year prison term for\n\nhis count 3 conviction. Accordingly, this portion of the abstract should be corrected to\n\nreflect that Vizcarra was sentenced to a prison term of four years for his count 3\n\nconviction.\n\n                                      DISPOSITION\n\n       The judgment is affirmed. The matter is remanded to the superior court with\n\ndirections that it prepare a corrected abstract of judgment to reflect that (1) Vizcarra was\n\nsentenced to a prison term of eight years for his count 2 conviction, and (2) he was\n\nsentenced to a consecutive prison term of four years for his count 3 conviction. The\n\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\fsuperior court is also directed to forward a certified copy of the corrected abstract of\n\njudgment to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n\n\n\n                                                                                  NARES, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\nBENKE, Acting P.
