Theft\u2014Confessions in Arrest.\u2014In a trial for horse-theft, the proof showed that a sheriff\u2019s posse found and arrested the accused in a county distant from the county where the horse was stolen, and that, when arrested, he made disclosures which led to the discovery of the horse. Held, on his trial as a principal offender, that such disclosures, though made in arrest, were competent evidence for the State, although his complicity in the original taking was not directly in proof.</p> <p>6.

    "summary": "Appeal from the District Court of Williamson. Tried below before the Hon. E. B. Turner. The indictment impleaded Jeff Ake, William Ake, William Bybee, and the appellant, Silas Berry, and charged them jointly with the theft of a certain gelding belonging to W. C. McDougle, on May 30, 1876. McDougle proved the fact and time of the theft as alleged in the indictment, and that the animal was returned to him by L. F. Hurt, about a month after it was stolen. He did not know who took it, and had never seen the appellant in possession of it. S. E. Holland testified that in June, 1876, he was one of a sheriff\u2019s posse in pursuit of horse-thieves, and in the forks of the Llano River, near Bob Hinds\u2019, they learned that the Akes were on top of the mountain. The next morning, seeing two men on the mountain, they surrounded it. In their search of the mountain, witness got a glimpse of a gun, and, following that hint, discovered two men hid under the brush and among the rocks. Witness threw his gun down on them, and they cried, \u201c Don\u2019t shoot,\u201d and then came out. In each other\u2019s presence they told witness their names were \u25a0Silas Berry and William Bybee, and that they had been riding about forty yards behind the wagon of Bill and Jeff Ake, about a mile from where they then were, when the wagon had been fired into, on the Fredricksburg road; that they left the road, unsaddled their horses, and hid the saddles, and hobbled the horses in a mesquite flat, and then went to the mountains, and were watching the men below, with the intention of coming down in case they recognized any of them. Witness asked them where their horses were, and they replied, \u201cOur horses are down the mountain, in the mesquite flat;\u201d and on witness pressing them further about their horses, they said they were the Akes horses. Being taken down to the camp of the posse, at the foot of the mountain, they there repeated the same statement, and some of the posse went and brought the horses in, when Berry and Bybee recognized them as the horses they had been riding the night before. One of these horses, as appears by other witnesses, was McDougle\u2019s stolen gelding. John Clymer, testifying for the State, said he was with the posse, and was near the Akes wagon when some sixteen shots were fired into it. The next morning witness was at camp when Berry and Bybee were brought in, and his account of their statements accorded with that given by the previous witness. This witness went in search of the horses in the mesquite flat, and, at first, could not find the saddles, and Berry or Bybee, or both of them, went back with witness to find them. Bybee\u2019s was in an open space, and Berry\u2019s hidden in the brush. Berry said he hid his saddle because it was a fine one. He also stated that he moved Mrs. Ake from Williamson County to Kimble County, and that Bybee came along with them. L. F. Hurt testified that he was one of the posse, and was present when Berry and Bybee were brought into camp. His account of their statements concurs with that already given, but he added that before the horses were brought in he inquired of Berry and Bybee about McDougle\u2019s gelding, describing it to them, and they replied, \u201c That is one of the horses we were riding, and left down in the mesquite flat.\u201d Witness brought the gelding back to McDougle. On this testimony the prosecution rested. For the defense, John Parsons swore that about the last of May, 1876, he and Joe Hunt traveled for a day and a-half along with two men who called themselves Bob Thompson and George Campbell. Witness and Hunt were moving some cows from San Saba to Kimble County, and the others said they were going to Bob Hinds\u2019, in Kimble County. Thompson and Campbell were driving six or seven horses, and among them the animal which witness had since learned is McDougle\u2019s gelding. Witness had seen the animal in McDougle\u2019s possession the day of this trial, and knows it to be one of the horses he saw in the possession of Thompson and Campbell. Witness was along with the State\u2019s witness, Clymer, when this gelding and another horse were brought into the camp of the posse, and witness then recognized it as one of those he had seen with Thompson and Campbell. Witness never saw Berry, the accused, until the day he was arrested by the posse. Joe Hunt, for the defense, testified to the same effect as Parsons. Jack Hoover, for the defense, stated that about June 5 or 6, 1876, he met Thompson and Campbell near Bob Hinds\u2019, and saw in their possession the gelding described by the preceding witnesses. Witness was frequently about their camp, and saw the animal there. Jeff Ake, his wife, mother, and niece came to the camp four or five days before the sheriff\u2019s posse attacked them. Jeff Ake went by the name of Ben Thompson, his wife by the name of Mrs. Thompson, and his mother by the name of the widow Thompson, and Jeff claimed Bob Thompson as his brother. Witness did not see either Berry or Bybee in that camp. Bob Harris, for the defense, stated that he was with the sheriff\u2019s posse, and saw Berry and Bybee after they were arrested. Witness heard Berry say he had moved Mrs. Ake up to Kimble County, and saw Mrs. Ake\u2019s \u201c plunder \u201d thrown out of the wagon, the morning the posse started back to Williamson County with Berry and Bybee in custody. Witness heard Mrs. Ake say that Silas Ake would make Berry a deed to some land for moving them. The wagon and team were brought back to Williamson County and turned over to Berry\u2019s wife. The jury found the appellant guilty, and awarded him ten years- in the penitentiary. The court below refused a new trial, and this appeal ensued.",

            "opinion_text": "\nWinkler, J.\nThe. appellant and three others were indicted for theft of a gelding. On the trial all the defendants claimed a severance, which being granted, the appellant was tried separately and convicted, and a new trial having been refused him in the court below, he prosecutes this appeal from the judgment.\nSeveral errors are complained of in the motion for a new trial, and in an assignment of errors set out in the transcript, though there is but one bill of exceptions embraced in the record. It is proposed to consider the errors complained of, in so far as they are deemed to have a controlling influence upon the verdict and judgment appealed from. On the trial the judge presiding instructed the jury as follows : \u201c All persons are principals who are guilty of acting together in the commission of an offense. When an offense is actually committed by one or more persons, but others *501are present, and, knowing the unlawful intent, aid by acts, or encourage by words or gestures, those actually engaged in the commission of the unlawful act, such persons, so aiding or encouraging, are principal offenders, and may be prosecuted and convicted as such.\u201d To this portion of the charge a bill of exceptions was taken, on the ground, as stated in the bill of exceptions, \u201c that it was not warranted by the evidence in the case, as the evidence did not show Berry present when the offense was committed, or that he knew of it when committed, or that he either encouraged by words or gestures those who committed the offense.\u201d\nIt is not contended that, abstractly considered, the charge was not a correct enunciation of law; and, in fact, such position could not well be maintained, as it is in almost the exact language of the Penal Code, articles 214, 215. Pasc. Dig., arts. 1809, 1810. But it is insisted that the charge was erroneous because not applicable to the facts proved on the trial. It is conceded that if the charge did not apply to the proofs adduced it ought not to have been given, because, if on no other account, it would have tended to divert the minds of the jury from the true issues involved. In order, then, to determine whether the instruction was applicable to the facts proved or not, it will be necessary to notice briefly the evidence adduced.\nAgreeably to the statement of facts, the theft was committed in Williamson County, on the night of May 30, 1876. On June 17, 1876, the appellant and another party charged in the indictment with the theft were arrested in Kimble County, a distance of 150 miles from where it is alleged the theft was committed. When arrested, they made disclosures which led to the discovery, in the vicinity, of the stolen animal. On the way from Williamson County to Kimble County the animal was seen, with others, in charge of two other persons not named in the indictment, and the appellant, after his arrest, stated that he and his companion had, on the night before, been *502riding a short distance behind the wagon of another one of the persons charged in the indictment with the theft, and took alarm and secreted themselves on the mountain where they were arrested, and that they were riding the stolen animal .and another. The proofs do not disclose whether the appellant or his companion had been riding the animal in question. Under these circumstances, we are of opinion the charge complained of was proper. Article 214 of the Penal Code (Pasc. Dig., art. 1809) declares that \u201c all persons are principals who are guilty of acting together in the commission of an offense.\u201d The following articles afford examples as to what relation to the crime committed would create the relation of principal.\nWe do not understand that it is necessary, in order to constitute this relation to the crime, that all should be actually present and acting at one and the same time, but that the whole be in pursuance of a plan in which the minds, not the hands, of all concur. \u201cWhen there are several acts, constituting together one crime, if each act is separately performed by a different individual, in the absence of the rest, all are jointly principals as to the whole.\u201d 1 Bishop\u2019s Cr. Law, sec. 598; Welsh v. The State, 3 Texas Ct. App. 413.\nThe charge certainly submitted to the jury the question of the guilt or innocence of the accused, together with the presumption of innocence, and the reasonable doubt, and as to the credibility of the witnesses, in a fair and impartial manner, and in which we find nothing of which the appellant can complain.\nIn the original and amended motion for a new\" trial the appellant complains that the court erred in permitting the State to prove the declarations of the defendant while under arrest, and \u2018 \u2018 that the court erred in permitting the State to sever the defendants, Berry, Bybee, and Ake, who were all joined in the indictment and indicted together, and in permitting the county attorney to elect and put Berry on trial first, without the consent of Berry.\u201d\n*503Under the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, article 661, the confession of a defendant may be used against him, if it appears that the same was freely made, without compulsion or persuasion. But by the succeeding article, 662, it is further provided that the confession shall not be used if, at the time it was made, \u201c the defendant was in jail or other place of confinement, or while he is in custody of an officer, * * * unless, in connection with such confession, he made statement of facts or of circumstances that are found to be true, which conduce to establish his guilt, such as the finding of secreted or stolen property,\u201d etc. In the present instance the testimony appears to have been admitted without objection by the accused, and on that account he cannot now be heard to complain. But the proof shows that the confessions of the appellant and his companion did tend to establish his guilt, in that they led to. the discovery of the stolen property, and were, therefore, not within the statutory inhibition against the admission of confessions made by one under arrest.\nWith regard to the severance, the record does not sustain the position taken in the motion; on the contrary, the judgment of the court recites, and is not contradicted, that the severance was granted at the instance of all the defendants. The entry on the face of the record is as follows :\n\u201cAnd now, on this the 15th day of April, A. D. 1878, this cause being regularly reached and called for trial, comes the State of Texas, by her county attorney, and announced ready for trial, and came the defendants, in person and by attorneys, and claim a severance for each defendant in this cause, which is accordingly granted by the court; and said severance being granted by the court, the defendant Silas Berry announced ready for trial,\u201d etc. The appellant, having participated in procuring a severance, cannot now be heard to complain. The fact that he was jointly indicted *504with others did not prevent the court from granting a separate trial to each defendant, on a proper showing.\nIt is contended, on behalf of the appellant, that the testimony of guilt is not of a sufficiently conclusive and convincing character. Cases of this nature often involve the right of the jury to infer from facts proved the existence of other facts, and to determine the intent existing at the time from the facts proved. And by our system of criminal procedure it is the peculiar province of the juries to deal with the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses. After verdict, the sufficiency of the evidence becomes a question for the judge to whom a motion for a new trial is addressed.\nSo, when the jury, under proper instructions, finds sufficient evidence to convict, and when the judge, with his means of judging of the evidence by having the witnesses before him, and having an opportunity to observe their manner of testifying and how they stand the test of cross-examination, deems the testimony sufficient to warrant a conviction, this court would not feel warranted in interposing, unless, upon examination of the record, it should appear that the finding is against the testimony, or without sufficient legal evidence to support it. This is not such a case. On the contrary, there was, in our opinion, a sufficient amount of legal evidence connecting the defendant with the commission of the offense to warrant the jury in the conclusion that the appellant was a principal in the theft, under the law given in charge by the judge.\nAfter carefully considering the whole case as presented by the record, in the light of able and exhaustive oral and written argument, we fail to discover any just ground to question the correctness of the verdict and judgment; and, therefore, the judgment of the District Court of Williamson County is affirmed.\n\nAffirmed.\n\n",
