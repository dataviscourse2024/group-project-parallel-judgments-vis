Reggie Golden pleaded guilty\nto possessing a firearm as a felon in violation of 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and was sentenced to 200 months\nimprisonment. On appeal, Golden challenges the district\ncourt\u2019s enhancement of his sentence pursuant to the armed-\ncriminal career statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Golden argues\nthat the district court erred in determining that Golden had\ncommitted three prior violent felony offenses for the\npurpose of the \u00a7 924(e) enhancement. Specifically, Golden\ncontends that the court erred in classifying as \u201cviolent\nfelonies\u201d his two prior convictions for failure to report to\ncounty jail. We affirm.\n\f2                                                  No. 06-1326\n\n                        I. Background\n  On November 10, 2005, Golden pleaded guilty pursuant\nto a written plea agreement to count II of a superceding\nindictment, possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).\n  At the sentencing hearing, Golden objected to the Pre-\nSentence Investigation Report\u2019s recommendation that he\nwas subject to the sentencing enhancement provision of\n\u00a7 924(e). Golden had been convicted previously of possession\nof a short-barreled shotgun, false imprisonment, and, on\ntwo separate occasions, failure to report to county\njail in violation of the Wisconsin Criminal Code, WIS.\nSTAT. \u00a7 946.425(1m)(b). Golden conceded that his convic-\ntions for possession of a short-barreled shotgun and false\nimprisonment were violent felonies. Golden argued, how-\never, that failure to report to jail did not constitute a violent\nfelony pursuant to \u00a7 924(e).\n  The district court accepted the plea agreement and, over\nGolden\u2019s objection, found that the provisions of \u00a7 924(e)\napplied to Golden\u2019s sentence because Golden had at\nleast three previous convictions for violent felony offenses,\nincluding the two convictions for failure to report to\ncounty jail. The district court then determined that the\napplicable guideline sentence was 188 to 235 months and\nsentenced Golden to 200 months of imprisonment, followed\nby five years of supervised release. This timely appeal\nfollowed.\n\n\n                        II. Discussion\n  Under \u00a7 924(e), a defendant who violates 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 922(g) and who has at least three prior convictions for\nviolent felonies or serious drug offenses is subject to a\nmandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years imprison-\nment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Golden concedes that he has\n\fNo. 06-1326                                                        3\n\ntwo prior convictions for violent felonies, possession of a\nshort-barreled shotgun and false imprisonment, but\nargues that the district court erred in determining that\nhis prior convictions for failure to report to jail con-\nstitute violent felonies pursuant to \u00a7 924(e). He contends\nthat the failure to report to jail does not contain as an\nelement the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\nphysical force against another person or otherwise pre-\nsent serious potential risk of physical injury to another\nperson. Whether a prior offense constitutes a \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d for purposes of sentencing is a question of law\nthat we review de novo. United States v. Wallace, 326 F.3d\n881, 886 (7th Cir. 2003).\n  Section 924(e)(2)(B) defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as any crime\npunishable by imprisonment exceeding one year that\u2014\n    (1) has an element the use, attempted use, or threat-\n    ened use of physical force against the person of another,\n    or\n    (2) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of\n    explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents\n    a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\nId. (emphasis added).\n  Golden\u2019s prior convictions for felony failure to report to\njail were pursuant to WIS. STAT. \u00a7 946.425(1m)(b).1 There is\nno dispute that the use or threatened use of physical force\nare not elements of an offense under WIS. STAT.\n\u00a7 946.425(1m)(b). The Court therefore must consider\nwhether the failure to report to jail \u201cotherwise involves\n\n\n1\n   Under this statute, \u201c[a]ny person who receives a stay of\nexecution of a sentence of imprisonment of 10 or more days to\na county jail under s. 973.15(8)(a) and who intentionally fails\nto report to the county jail as required under the sentence is guilty\nof a Class H felony.\u201d WIS. STAT. \u00a7 946.425(1m)(b) (2005).\n\f4                                                No. 06-1326\n\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n   In making a risk determination, \u201cthe benchmark should\nbe the possibility of violent confrontation, not whether one\ncan postulate nonconfrontational hypothetical scenario.\u201d\nUnited States v. Franklin, 302 F.3d 722 at 723 (7th Cir.\n2002) (quoting United States v. Davis, 16 F.3d 212, 217 (7th\nCir. 1994)). Rather than examining the specific facts of each\ndefendant\u2019s offense to determine whether that offense\nconstitutes a violent felony, \u201csentencing courts take a\ncategorical approach, looking to the statutory elements of\nthe crime . . . .\u201d Id. at 725 (holding that the crime of escape\nis a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 924(e) because escape\ninvolves a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother\u201d). See also Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575,\n600-01, 110 S. Ct. 2143, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1990) (adopting\na formal, categorical approach for determining whether a\nparticular offense constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under\n\u00a7 924(e)).\n   Under this categorical approach, the Court sees no\nprincipled distinction between the failure to report to\njail and the failure to report back to a halfway house\nafter being absent on a work release. See United States\nv. Bryant, 310 F.3d 550 at 553-54 (7th Cir. 2002). In Bryant,\nthis Court held that the crime of escape, as a category, is a\ncrime of violence for purposes of the federal sentencing\nguidelines. Id. at 554. After pleading guilty to four counts\nof making false statements in connection with the transfers\nof firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6), the defen-\ndant received an elevated base offense level under the\nsentencing guidelines because of his previous conviction for\na \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The defendant had been convicted of\nthe crime of \u201cescape\u201d for failing to return to a halfway house\nafter receiving permission to be absent temporarily for work\npurposes. Id. The defendant was on the lam for ten days\nbefore being re-apprehended. He was charged with and\n\fNo. 06-1326                                                    5\n\npleaded guilty to violating the federal scape statute, 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 751(a). Id.\n   On appeal, this Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argu-\nment that the Court should adopt a fact-specific approach\nto determine whether a particular offense constitutes a\ncrime of violence under the sentencing guidelines, reasoning\nthat this Court\u2019s decision in Franklin and the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Taylor foreclosed that argument. Id.\nat 553-54 (citing Franklin, 302 F.3d at 724, Taylor, 495 U.S.\nat 601). Moreover, the Court explained, the defendant\u2019s\n\u201capproach risks opening the courts to countless arguments\nas to whether a crime is actually an \u2018escape\u2019 or merely a\n\u2018failure to return.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 554.\n  The same reasoning holds true in the instant matter.\nWhile Golden attempts to distinguish the failure to report\nto jail from escape by arguing that the failure to report\nto jail is a passive inaction rather than the deliberate action\nof escaping from jail, both offenses involve the\nsame potential for a violent confrontation. In failing to\nreport to jail, the potential for a violent confrontation arises\nbetween the defendant and law enforcement during the\nattempted capture. In escaping from jail or in failing to\nreport back to a halfway house, the potential for a violent\nconfrontation arises during the attempted recapture.\nDifferentiating between capture and recapture serves no\nuseful purpose. Both offenses also involve a defendant\nwhose guilt has been adjudicated, who has received a\nsentence, and who knows what the future\nholds: incarceration. Following the required categorical\napproach for determining whether an offense is a \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(e), we find that the offense\nof failing to report to jail constitutes such a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d\nThe district court properly applied the sentenc-\ning enhancement to Golden.\n\f6                                                No. 06-1326\n\n                      III. Conclusion\n  For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the sentence\nimposed by the district court.\n\n\n\n\n  ROVNER, Circuit Judge, concurring. I concur in my\nbrother\u2019s very fine opinion. I agree that treating failure\nto report to jail as a violent felony is a logical extension\nof our earlier decision treating failure to return to a halfway\nhouse as a violent felony. See United States v. Bryant, 310\nF.3d 550 (7th Cir. 2002). The risk to law enforcement is\nlikely the same in capture as it is in recapture. Defense\ncounsel relied largely on the difference between an active\nescape and a passive failure to report to demonstrate that\nthe risks are not the same. There are many differences\nbetween those who escape and those who fail to report, but\nthere are also many similarities. We assume for the pur-\nposes of this opinion that the similarities are greater than\nthe differences and that both situations present a serious\npotential risk of physical injury to law enforcement or the\npublic.\n  I write separately because, as a practical matter, we do\nnot know the actual risks to law enforcement officers\nin recaptures following escapes (and in escapes, I include\nfailures to return to halfway house custody) versus captures\nfollowing failure to report to jail. The statute characterizes\nas a violent felony a crime that \u201cis burglary of a dwelling,\narson, or extortion, involves explosives, or otherwise\ninvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B) (empha-\nsis added). I doubt that the failure to report for incarcera-\ntion by its nature presents the same danger that escape\n\fNo. 06-1326                                                 7\n\nfrom custody does. In Bryant, we declined the defendant\u2019s\ninvitation to reclassify his failure to return to halfway\nhouse custody as a \u201cfailure to return\u201d rather than escape.\nBryant was charged under an escape statute, which was\nappropriate because he was in a type of custody in the\nhalfway house. We applied a categorical approach to\nBryant\u2019s escape conviction and concluded that it posed the\nsame risks as any other escape.\n  The failure to report reflects deliberate disregard of an\norder, but it is not clear to me that a defendant who fails to\nreport on schedule is any more likely to resist attempts to\ntake him into custody than someone who commits contempt\nof court, for example. Escape is in that regard different: the\ndefendant has demonstrated not only a willingness to\ndisobey an order, but also a specific inclination to resist or\nevade restraint, making it likely that the authorities will\nhave to employ force in order to recapture him. The mere\nfailure to report to custody in the first instance does not\nreflect that extra element. No doubt the defendant who\nchooses not to report for jail as ordered appreciates that the\nauthorities will come looking for him; but that decision,\nunlawful as it is, does not necessarily or even probably\nsignal the defendant\u2019s willingness to run or resist when a\nsheriff\u2019s deputy comes knocking on his door. There may well\nbe some defendants in this situation who have no intention\nof going quietly, but we have no way of knowing how\nrepresentative those individuals would be. The government\nhas given us no statistics to support a conclusion that\nfailure to report to jail presents a serious potential risk to\nthe public or to the officers involved in the subsequent\ncapture.\n  Because we use a categorical approach in making this\ndetermination, our decision will have a wide-ranging effect.\nAs counsel for Golden pointed out, a person who has never\ncommitted a violent crime in her life but has failed to report\nto jail in Wisconsin for three shoplifting sentences exceed-\n\f8                                                No. 06-1326\n\ning ten days each would face this enhancement as a violent\nfelon. No other appellate court has considered whether\nfailure to report to jail is a violent felony. Most circuits\nagree that all escapes, even those by stealth or those from\nhalfway houses, are violent felonies, mainly because of the\nrisks inherent in recapture. The Ninth Circuit has declined\nto apply our categorical approach to a failure to return to a\nhalfway house. See United States v. Piccolo, 441 F.3d 1084\n(9th Cir. 2006). Now that we have found that failure to\nreport constitutes a violent felony, we are on the path to\ndetermining that comparable crimes, a probation violation,\nfor example, might qualify as well. If statistics do not bear\nout the assumption that persons who fail to report pose a\nserious potential risk of physical harm to others, we may\nhave to reconsider our approach.\n\n\n\n\n  WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, dissenting. Because I do not\nbelieve that \u201cfailure to report to jail\u201d constitutes a \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), I respectfully\ndissent.\n  The panel\u2019s decision in this case is an outgrowth of our\nholding in United States v. Franklin, 302 F.3d 722, 724 (7th\nCir. 2002), that all escapes constitute violent felonies\nbecause \u201c[e]ven the most peaceful escape cannot eliminate\nthe potential for violent conflict when the authorities\nattempt to recapture an escapee.\u201d Here, the panel opinion\nconcludes that there can be no logical difference between\ncapture and recapture. While it is a close question, I believe\nthat we must draw a line between capture and recapture or\nrisk exposing defendants to enhanced punishment under\nsection 924 on the basis of virtually any felony. My view\n\fNo. 06-1326                                                  9\n\nthat Wisconsin\u2019s \u201cfailure to report to jail\u201d crime is not a\nviolent felony under section 924 is supported by a close\nreading of the statute.\n  As Judge Bauer\u2019s opinion observes, the relevant portion\nof section 924 defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as one which \u201cis\nburglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives,\nor otherwise involves conduct that presents a seri-\nous potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The meaning of the final clause in sec-\ntion 924, beginning with \u201cotherwise,\u201d is far from clear.\nHowever, we can deduce its meaning by calling upon an\nage-old canon of statutory construction, ejusdem generis,\nwhich instructs that the scope of an ambiguous term in a\nstatute is limited by more precise terms with which it\nis listed. See Tourdot v. Rockford Health Plans, 439 F.3d\n351, 353 (7th Cir. 2006) (\u201cEjusdem generis provides guid-\nance on how to interpret language where meaning is not\nplain. This Latin phrase confines the scope of a general\nterm to the nature of the preceding class or thing, unless a\ncontrary intent is clearly shown.\u201d); see also McBoyle v.\nUnited States, 283 U.S. 25, 26 (1931) (Holmes, J.) (\u201c[A]fter\nincluding automobile truck, automobile wagon and motor\ncycle, the words \u2018any other self-propelled vehicle not\ndesigned for running on rails\u2019 still indicate that a vehicle in\nthe popular sense, that is a vehicle running on land is the\ntheme. It is a vehicle that runs, not something, not com-\nmonly called a vehicle, that flies.\u201d). In McBoyle, Justice\nHolmes famously concluded that the words \u201cany other\nself-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails\u201d did\nnot include airplanes where the more specific words in\nthe statute referred only to vehicles that ran on land.\nSee id.\n  Here, it is worth asking if \u201cfailure to return to jail,\u201d as\nthat crime is defined in Wisconsin, is like burglary, arson,\nextortion, or crimes involving the use of explosives. The\n\f10                                                No. 06-1326\n\ncommon thread between these crimes is that they all\ninvolve a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to an-\nother.\u201d See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). To\nadd failure to return to jail to the list would contort the will\nof Congress into enhanced punishment when there is any\nrisk of physical injury.\n  In Davis, we stated that \u201cin determining whether an\noffense falls under the \u2018otherwise\u2019 clause, the benchmark\nshould be the possibility of violent confrontation, not\nwhether one can postulate a nonconfrontational hypo-\nthetical scenario.\u201d United States v. Davis, 16 F.3d 212, 217\n(7th Cir. 1994). Although we used the word \u201cpossibility,\u201d the\nmore appropriate term would have been \u201cprobability\u201d\u2014 the\nprobability of violent confrontation is the benchmark that\nbest conforms with logic and Congressional intent.\nAll crimes carry the possibility of violent confronta-\ntion\u2014even the feeblest episode of shoplifting triggers the\npossibility that violent confrontation will ensue when\na police officer attempts to apprehend the shoplifter. It\nseems unlikely, however, that Congress would have gone to\nthe trouble of delimiting the reach of section 924 to \u201cviolent\nfelonies\u201d if it intended to subject even this crime to en-\nhanced punishment for recidivism. Moreover, if Congress\nintended for the courts to examine the risk of physical\ninjury in the abstract, it could have simply instructed the\ncourts that \u201cviolent felonies\u201d are all those involving \u201ccon-\nduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury\nto another,\u201d but it did not. Instead, the legislature chose to\nprovide a list of crimes that presumably pose a comparable\nrisk of physical injury to others. The dissimilarity between\ncrimes involving the use of explosives and failure to report\nto jail could not be more extreme.\n  Our prior opinions on the classification of escape crimes\nunder section 924 do not constrain our decision here. The\nWisconsin law that Golden was previously convicted of\nviolating provides: \u201cAny person who receives a stay of\n\fNo. 06-1326                                                11\n\nexecution of a sentence of imprisonment of 10 or more\ndays to a county jail under s. 973.15(8)(a) and who inten-\ntionally fails to report to the county jail as required under\nthe sentence is guilty of a Class H felony.\u201d Wis. Stat.\n\u00a7 946.425(1m)(b). As we explained in Franklin, the categori-\ncal approach mandated by Taylor1 requires us to \u201clook[ ] to\nthe statutory elements of the crime, rather than the\nparticular facts underlying the conviction.\u201d See Franklin,\n302 F.3d at 723. In Franklin, the statutory elements of the\nescape crime at issue were \u201c(a) the knowing and voluntary\ndeparture of a person (b) from lawful custody and (c) with\nintent to evade due course of justice.\u201d Id. (quoting Miller v.\nState, 492 So. 2d 978, 981 (Miss. 1986)). While these were\nthe only elements necessary to secure a conviction under\nthe Mississippi escape statute, the first subsection of that\nstatute gives a glimpse into the minds of the drafters, as it\npunishes \u201c[w]hoever escapes or attempts by force or violence\nto escape from any jail in which he is confined . . . .\u201d See\nMiss. Code Ann. \u00a7 97-9-49. The important point is that the\nescape crime in Franklin punished intentional departure\nfrom custody, an act that usually requires physical force.\nThis is likely the reason that the Mississippi legislature\nchose to punish first and foremost those who use force or\nviolence to escape under \u00a7 97-9-49. Our other cases also\ninvolved statutes that punished active crimes posing a high\nrisk of physical injury to another. See, e.g., United States v.\nHowze, 343 F.3d 919, 921 (7th Cir. 2003) (finding that\nstatute which proscribed \u201cknowingly flee[ing] or\nattempt[ing] to elude any traffic officer by willful or wanton\ndisregard of such signal so as to interfere with or endanger\nthe operation of the police vehicle, or the traffic officer or\nother vehicles or pedestrians\u201d was properly classified as a\nviolent felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)) (quoting\nWis.

United States, 495 U.S. 575, 601 (1990).\n\f12                                               No. 06-1326\n\n550, 553 (7th Cir. 2002) (applying categorical approach to\ndefendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to return\u201d-type escape and finding that\nit constituted a crime of violence where the statute pun-\nished \u201cescapes or attempts to escape from the custody of the\nAttorney General or his authorized representative, or from\nany institution or facility\u201d).\n  By contrast, Golden\u2019s prior offense, failure to report to\njail, is largely a crime of omission. Cf. United States v.\nPiccolo, 441 F.3d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir. 2006) (\u201cThose\nwho leave without returning do not pose an automatic\nrisk of danger and therefore do not categorically raise a\nserious potential risk of physical harm.\u201d); United States v.\nAdkins, 196 F.3d 1112, 1119 (10th Cir. 1999) (McKay, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cThere is a quantum difference between the\nassumptions about the intrinsic danger of unauthorized\ndeparture from actual custody, as in this case, and of failure\nto return from authorized departure from actual custody.\u201d).\nNo element of the Wisconsin statute at issue involves force\nor violence, or suggests the likelihood of physical injury.\nWhile it is possible that, eventually, some physical alterca-\ntion could occur, as Judge Rovner points out in her concur-\nrence, the government has not introduced any evidence\nindicating that failure to report is typically a violent crime.\nRegardless, if a failure to report ultimately results in a\nviolent confrontation, the violator\u2019s record will likely\ncontain a crime more appropriately suited to section 924\u2019s\nviolent crime definition, such as assault or battery. Thus, I\nwould not find that Section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s definition of\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d includes Golden\u2019s failure to report to jail\nfelony.\n  By extending our violent felony jurisprudence to crimes\nsuch as failure to report to jail, we run the risk of com-\npromising the very due process concerns that the Supreme\nCourt addressed in McBoyle, where Justice Holmes wrote:\n     Although it is not likely that a criminal will carefully\n     consider the text of the law before he murders or steals,\n\fNo. 06-1326                                               13\n\n    it is reasonable that a fair warning should be\n    given to the world in language that the common\n    world will understand, of what the law intends to do\n    if a certain line is passed. To make the warning fair, so\n    far as possible the line should be clear. When a rule of\n    conduct is laid down in words that evoke in the common\n    mind only the picture of vehicles moving on land, the\n    statute should not be extended to aircraft simply\n    because it may seem to us that a similar policy applies,\n    or upon the speculation that if the legislature had\n    thought of it, very likely broader words would have\n    been used.\nMcBoyle, 283 U.S. at 27 (emphasis added); see also United\nStates v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 265 (1997) (citing McBoyle\nfor principle that due process requires fair warning \u201cin\nlanguage that the common world will understand\u201d). No\nlayman would anticipate that \u201cfailure to report to jail,\u201d as\nthat crime is defined in Wisconsin, would trigger a recidi-\nvist statute that punishes those guilty of committing\nmultiple violent felonies. While that fact is not dispositive\nin our inquiry, it should trigger some alarm with regard\nto the distance our interpretation of section 924 has trav-\neled from \u201clanguage that the common world\u201d would under-\nstand.

On appeal, Golden challenges the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence pursuant to the armed-criminal career statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Golden argues that the district court erred in determining that Golden had committed three prior violent felony offenses for the purpose of the \u00a7 924(e) enhancement. Specifically, Golden contends that the court erred in classifying as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d his two prior convictions for failure to report to county jail. We affirm.\n*613I. Background\nOn November 10, 2005, Golden pleaded guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement to count II of a superceding indictment, possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).\nAt the sentencing hearing, Golden objected to the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report\u2019s recommendation that he was subject to the sentencing enhancement provision of \u00a7 924(e). Golden had been convicted previously of possession of a short-barreled shotgun, false imprisonment, and, on two separate occasions, failure to report to county jail in violation of the Wisconsin Criminal Code, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 946.425(lm)(b). Golden conceded that his convictions for possession of a short-barreled shotgun and false imprisonment were violent felonies. Golden argued, however, that failure to report to jail did not constitute a violent felony pursuant to \u00a7 924(e).\nThe district court accepted the plea agreement and, over Golden\u2019s objection, found that the provisions of \u00a7 924(e) applied to Golden\u2019s sentence because Golden had at least three previous convictions for violent felony offenses, including the two convictions for failure to report to county jail. The district court then determined that the applicable guideline sentence was 188 to 235 months and sentenced Golden to 200 months of imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release. This timely appeal followed.\nII. Discussion\nUnder \u00a7 924(e), a defendant who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and who has at least three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Golden concedes that he has two prior convictions for violent felonies, possession of a short-barreled shotgun and false imprisonment, but argues that the district court erred in determining that his prior convictions for failure to report to jail constitute violent felonies pursuant to \u00a7 924(e). He contends that the failure to report to jail does not contain as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another person or otherwise present serious potential risk of physical injury to another person. Whether a prior offense constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of sentencing is a question of law that we review de novo. United States v. Wallace, 326 F.3d 881, 886 (7th Cir.2003).\nSection 924(e)(2)(B) defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as any crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year that\u2014\n(1) has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or\n(2) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\nId. (emphasis added).\nGolden\u2019s prior convictions for felony failure to report to jail were pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 946.425(lm)(b).1 There is no dispute that the use or threatened use of physical force are not elements of an offense under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 946.425(lm)(b). The Court therefore must consider whether the failure to report to jail \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious *614potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\nIn making a risk determination, \u201cthe benchmark should be the possibility of violent confrontation, not whether one can postulate nonconfrontational hypothetical scenario.\u201d United States v. Franklin, 302 F.3d 722 at 723 (7th Cir.2002) (quoting United States v. Davis, 16 F.3d 212, 217 (7th Cir.1994)). Rather than examining the specific facts of each defendant\u2019s offense to determine whether that offense constitutes a violent felony, \u201csentencing courts take a categorical approach, looking to the statutory elements of the crime.... \u201d Id. at 725 (holding that the crime of escape is a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 924(e) because escape involves a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d). See also Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600-01, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (adopting a formal, categorical approach for determining whether a particular offense constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)).\nUnder this categorical approach, the Court sees no principled distinction between the failure to report to jail and the failure to report back to a halfway house after being absent on a work release. See United States v. Bryant, 310 F.3d 550 at 553-54 (7th Cir.2002). In Bryant, this Court held that the crime of escape, as a category, is a crime of violence for purposes of the federal sentencing guidelines. Id. at 554. After pleading guilty to four counts of making false statements in connection with the transfers of firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6), the defendant received an elevated base offense level under the sentencing guidelines because of his previous conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The defendant had been convicted of the crime of \u201cescape\u201d for failing to return to a halfway house after receiving permission to be absent temporarily for work purposes. Id. The defendant was on the lam for ten days before being re-apprehended. He was charged with and pleaded guilty to violating the federal scape statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a). Id.\nOn appeal, this Court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the Court should adopt a fact-specific approach to determine whether a particular offense constitutes a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines, reasoning that this Court\u2019s decision in Franklin and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Taylor foreclosed that argument. Id. at 553-54 (citing Franklin, 302 F.3d at 724, Taylor, 495 U.S. at 601, 110 S.Ct. 2143). Moreover, the Court explained, the defendant\u2019s \u201capproach risks opening the courts to countless arguments as to whether a crime is actually an \u2018escape\u2019 or merely a \u2018failure to return.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 554.\nThe same reasoning holds true in the instant matter. While Golden attempts to distinguish the failure to report to jail from escape by arguing that the failure to report to jail is a passive inaction rather than the deliberate action of escaping from jail, both offenses involve the same potential for a violent confrontation. In failing to report to jail, the potential for a violent confrontation arises between the defendant and law enforcement during the attempted capture. In escaping from jail or in failing to report back to a halfway house, the potential for a violent confrontation arises during the attempted recapture. Differentiating between capture and recapture serves no useful purpose. Both offenses also involve a defendant whose guilt has been adjudicated, who has received a sentence, and who knows what the future holds: incarceration. Following the required categorical approach for determining whether an offense is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d *615for purposes of \u00a7 924(e), we find that the offense of failing to report to jail constitutes such a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d The district court properly applied the sentencing enhancement to Golden.\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, we Affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.\n\n. Under this statute, \"[a]ny person who receives a stay of execution of a sentence of imprisonment of 10 or more days to a county jail under s. 973.15(8)(a) and who intentionally fails to report to the county jail as required under the sentence is guilty of a Class H felony.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 946.425(lm)(b) (2005).\n\n",

            "opinion_text": "\nROVNER, Circuit Judge,\nconcurring.\nI concur in my brother\u2019s very fine opinion. I agree that treating failure to report to jail as a violent felony is a logical extension of our earlier decision treating failure to return to a halfway house as a violent felony. See United States v. Bryant, 310 F.3d 550 (7th Cir.2002). The risk to law enforcement is likely the same in capture as it is in recapture. Defense counsel relied largely on the difference between an active escape and a passive failure to report to demonstrate that the risks are not the same. There are many differences between those who escape and those who fail to report, but there are also many similarities. We assume for the purposes of this opinion that the similarities are greater than the differences and that both situations present a serious potential risk of physical injury to law enforcement or the public.\nI write separately because, as a practical matter, we do not know the actual risks to law enforcement officers in recaptures following escapes (and in escapes, I include failures to return to halfway house custody) versus captures following failure to report to jail. The statute characterizes as a violent felony a crime that \u201cis burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added). I doubt that the failure to report for incarceration by its nature presents the same danger that escape from custody does. In Bryant, we declined the defendant\u2019s invitation to reclassify his failure to return to halfway house custody as a \u201cfailure to return\u201d rather than escape. Bryant was charged under an escape statute, which was appropriate because he was in a type of custody in the halfway house. We applied a categorical approach to Bryant\u2019s escape conviction and concluded that it posed the same risks as any other escape.\nThe failure to report reflects deliberate disregard of an order, but it is not clear to me that a defendant who fails to report on schedule is any more likely to resist attempts to take him into custody than someone who commits contempt of court, for example. Escape is in that regard different: the defendant has demonstrated not only a willingness to disobey an order, but also a specific inclination to resist or evade restraint, making it likely that the authorities will have to employ force in order to recapture him. The mere failure to report to custody in the first instance does not reflect that extra element. No doubt the defendant who chooses not to report for jail as ordered appreciates that the authorities will come looking for him; but that decision, unlawful as it is, does not necessarily or even probably signal the defendant\u2019s willingness to run or resist when a sheriffs deputy comes knocking on his door. There may well be some defendants in this situation who have no intention of going quietly, but we have no way of knowing how representative those individuals would be. The government has given us no statistics to support a conclusion that failure to report to jail presents a serious potential risk to the public or to the officers involved in the subsequent capture.\nBecause we use a categorical approach in making this determination, our decision *616will have a wide-ranging effect. As counsel for Golden pointed out, a person who has never committed a violent crime in her life but has failed to report to jail in Wisconsin for three shoplifting sentences exceeding ten days each would face this enhancement as a violent felon. No other appellate court has considered whether failure to report to jail is a violent felony. Most circuits agree that all escapes, even those by stealth or those from halfway houses, are violent felonies, mainly because of the risks inherent in recapture. The Ninth Circuit has declined to apply our categorical approach to a failure to return to a halfway house. See United States v. Piccolo, 441 F.3d 1084 (9th Cir.2006). Now that we have found that failure to report constitutes a violent felony, we are on the path to determining that comparable crimes, a probation violation, for example, might qualify as well. If statistics do not bear out the assumption that persons who fail to report pose a serious potential risk of physical harm to others, we may have to reconsider our approach.\n",

Franklin, 302 F.3d 722, 724 (7th Cir.2002), that all escapes constitute violent felonies because \u201c[e]ven the most peaceful escape cannot eliminate the potential for violent conflict when the authorities attempt to recapture an escapee.\u201d Here, the panel opinion concludes that there can be no logical difference between capture and recapture. While it is a close question, I believe that we must draw a line between capture and recapture or risk exposing defendants to enhanced punishment under section 924 on the basis of virtually any felony. My view that Wisconsin\u2019s \u201cfailure to report to jail\u201d crime is not a violent felony under section 924 is supported by a close reading of the statute.\nAs Judge Bauer\u2019s opinion observes, the relevant portion of section 924 defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as one which \u201cis burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The meaning of the final clause in section 924, beginning with \u201cotherwise,\u201d is far from clear. However, we can deduce its meaning by calling upon an age-old canon of statutory construction, ejusdem generis, which instructs that the scope of an ambiguous term in a statute is limited by more precise terms with which it is listed. See Tourdot v. Rockford Health Plans, 439 F.3d 351, 353 (7th Cir.2006) (\u201cEjusdem generis provides guidance on how to interpret language where meaning is not plain. This Latin phrase confines the scope of a general term to the nature of the preceding class or thing, unless a contrary intent is clearly shown.\u201d); see also McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 26, 51 S.Ct. 340, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931) (Holmes, J.) (\u201c[Ajfter including automobile truck, automobile wagon and motor cycle, the words \u2018any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails\u2019 still indicate that a vehicle in the popular sense, that is a vehicle running on land is the theme. It is a vehicle that runs, not something, not commonly called a vehicle, that flies.\u201d). In McBoyle, Justice Holmes famously concluded that the words \u201cany other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails\u201d did not include airplanes where the more specific words in the statute referred only to vehicles that ran on land. See id.\n*617Here, it is worth asking if \u201cfailure to return to jail,\u201d as that crime is defined in Wisconsin, is like burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explosives. The common thread between these crimes is that they all involve a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). To add failure to return to jail to the list would contort the will of Congress into enhanced punishment when there is any risk of physical injury.\nIn Davis, we stated that \u201cin determining whether an offense falls under the \u2018otherwise\u2019 clause, the benchmark should be the possibility of violent confrontation, not whether one can postulate a nonconfrontational hypothetical scenario.\u201d United States v. Davis, 16 F.3d 212, 217 (7th Cir.1994). Although we used the word \u201cpossibility,\u201d the more appropriate term would have been \u201cprobability\u201d \u2014 the probability of violent confrontation is the benchmark that best conforms with logic and Congressional intent. All crimes carry the possibility of violent confrontation \u2014 even the feeblest episode of shoplifting triggers the possibility that violent confrontation will ensue when a police officer attempts to apprehend the shoplifter. It seems unlikely, however, that Congress would have gone to the trouble of delimiting the reach of section 924 to \u201cviolent felonies\u201d if it intended to subject even this crime to enhanced punishment for recidivism. Moreover, if Congress intended for the courts to examine the risk of physical injury in the abstract, it could have simply instructed the courts that \u201cviolent felonies\u201d are all those involving \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d but it did not. Instead, the legislature chose to provide a list of crimes that presumably pose a comparable risk of physical injury to others. The dissimilarity between crimes involving the use of explosives and failure to report to jail could not be more extreme.\nOur prior opinions on the classification of escape crimes under section 924 do not constrain our decision here. The Wisconsin law that Golden was previously convicted of violating provides: \u201cAny person who receives a stay of execution of a sentence of imprisonment of 10 or more days to a county jail under s. 973.15(8)(a) and who intentionally fails to report to the county jail as required under the sentence is guilty of a Class H felony.\u201d Wis. Stat. \u00a7 946.425(lm)(b). As we explained in Franklin, the categorical approach mandated by Taylor1 requires us to \u201clook[ ] to the statutory elements of the crime, rather than the particular facts underlying the conviction.\u201d See Franklin, 302 F.3d at 723. In Franklin, the statutory elements of the escape crime at issue were \u201c(a) the knowing and voluntary departure of a person (b) from lawful custody and (c) with intent to evade due course of justice.\u201d Id. (quoting Miller v. State, 492 So.2d 978, 981 (Miss.1986)). While these were the only elements necessary to secure a conviction under the Mississippi escape statute, the first subsection of that statute gives a glimpse into the minds of the drafters, as it punishes \u201c[wjhoever escapes or attempts by force or violence to escape from any jail in which he is confined.... \u201d See Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 97-9-49. The important point is that the escape crime in Franklin punished intentional departure from custody, an act that usually requires physical force. This is likely the reason that the Mississippi legislature chose to punish first and foremost those who use force or violence to escape under \u00a7 97-9-49. Our other cases also involved statutes that punished active crimes posing a high risk of *618physical injury to another. See, e.g., United States v. Howze, 343 F.3d 919, 921 (7th Cir.2003) (finding that statute which proscribed \u201cknowingly flee[ing] or attempt[ing] to elude any traffic officer by willful or wanton disregard of such signal so as to interfere with or endanger the operation of the police vehicle, or the traffic officer or other vehicles or pedestrians\u201d was properly classified as a violent felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)) (quoting Wis. Stat. \u00a7 346.04(3)); United States v. Bryant, 310 F.3d 550, 553 (7th Cir.2002) (applying categorical approach to defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to return\u201d-type escape and finding that it constituted a crime of violence where the statute punished \u201cescapes or attempts to escape from the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative, or from any institution or facility\u201d).\nBy contrast, Golden\u2019s prior offense, failure to report to jail, is largely a crime of omission. Cf. United States v. Piccolo, 441 F.3d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201cThose who leave without returning do not pose an automatic risk of danger and therefore do not categorically raise a serious potential risk of physical harm.\u201d); United States v. Adkins, 196 F.3d 1112, 1119 (10th Cir.1999) (McKay, J., concurring) (\u201cThere is a quantum difference between the assumptions about the intrinsic danger of unauthorized departure from actual custody, as in this case, and of failure to return from authorized departure from actual custody.\u201d). No element of the Wisconsin statute at issue involves force or violence, or suggests the likelihood of physical injury. While it is possible that, eventually, some physical altercation could occur, as Judge Rovner points out in her concurrence, the government has not introduced any evidence indicating that failure to report is typically a violent crime. Regardless, if a failure to report ultimately results in a violent confrontation, the violator\u2019s record will likely contain a crime more appropriately suited to section 924\u2019s violent crime definition, such as assault or battery. Thus, I would not find that Section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d includes Golden\u2019s failure to report to jail felony.\nBy extending our violent felony jurisprudence to crimes such as failure to report to jail, we run the risk of compromising the very due process concerns that the Supreme Court addressed in McBoyle, where Justice Holmes wrote:\nAlthough it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the text of the law before he murders or steals, it is reasonable that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear. When a rule of conduct is laid down in words that evoke in the common mind only the picture of vehicles moving on land, the statute should not be extended to aircraft simply because it may seem to us that a similar policy applies, or upon the speculation that if the legislature had thought of it, very likely broader words would have been used.\nMcBoyle, 283 U.S. at 27, 51 S.Ct. 340 (emphasis added); see also United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 265, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997) (citing McBoyle for principle that due process requires fair warning \u201cin language that the common world will understand\u201d). No layman would anticipate that \u201cfailure to report to jail,\u201d as that crime is defined in Wisconsin, would trigger a recidivist statute that punishes those guilty of committing multiple violent felonies. While that fact is not dispositive in our inquiry, it should trigger some alarm with regard to the distance our interpretation of section *619924 has traveled from \u201clanguage that the common world\u201d would understand. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 601, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).\n\n",
