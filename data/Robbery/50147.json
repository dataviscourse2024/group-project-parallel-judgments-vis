COVEY, Judge\n                HONORABLE MICHAEL H. WOJCIK, Judge\n                HONORABLE STACY WALLACE, Judge\n\nOPINION NOT REPORTED\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION BY\nJUDGE COVEY                                                    FILED: August 25, 2023\n\n                Derrick Wright-Wilson (Wright-Wilson) petitions this Court for review\nof the Pennsylvania Parole Board\u2019s (Board) September 9, 2022 order denying his\nrequest for administrative relief. Wright-Wilson is represented in this matter by\ncourt-appointed counsel, Kent D. Watkins, Esquire (Counsel), who has filed an\nApplication to Withdraw Appearance (Application) and submitted a no-merit letter\nin support thereof. After review, we grant Counsel\u2019s Application and affirm the\nBoard\u2019s order.\n                Wright-Wilson is an inmate at the State Correctional Institution (SCI)\nat Frackville.1 On November 11, 2015, the Dauphin County Common Pleas Court\n(trial court) sentenced Wright-Wilson to serve three concurrent three- to six-year\nsentences for three counts of robbery and one count of criminal conspiracy (Original\nSentence). See Certified Record (C.R.) at 1. His Original Sentence maximum\n\n\n      1\n          See http://inmatelocator.cor.pa.gov (last visited August 24, 2023).\n\frelease date was February 6, 2021. See id. By December 3, 2018 order, the Board\ngranted Wright-Wilson parole from his Original Sentence. See C.R. at 10. The\nBoard released him on parole on May 9, 2019. See id.\n             On August 28, 2020, Swatara Township police arrested Wright-Wilson\nand charged him with fleeing and attempting to elude the police, driving under\nsuspension, failing to have required financial responsibility, and accidents involving\ndamage to unattended vehicle or property (New Charges). On August 28, 2020, the\nBoard issued a warrant to commit and detain Wright-Wilson. See C.R. at 38. Also\non August 28, 2020, the trial court set Wright-Wilson\u2019s bail at $25,000.00 which he\ndid not post. See C.R. at 84. On September 17, 2020, Wright-Wilson waived legal\nrepresentation and his detention hearing. See C.R. at 41. On October 5, 2020, the\nBoard directed that Wright-Wilson be detained pending disposition of the New\nCharges. See C.R. at 59. On February 6, 2021, the Board cancelled the August 28,\n2020 warrant to commit and detain. See C.R. at 60.\n             On November 1, 2021, Wright-Wilson pled guilty to the New Charges\nand the trial court sentenced him to 18 to 36 months of confinement in an SCI (New\nSentence). See C.R. at 65. The trial court gave Wright-Wilson credit toward his\nNew Sentence for the 431 days he served between August 28, 2020 and November\n1, 2021. On November 10, 2021, the Board issued a warrant to commit and detain.\nSee C.R. at 61. On January 10, 2022, the Board issued a Notice of Charges based\non Wright-Wilson\u2019s new conviction on the New Charges, see C.R. at 65, and on the\nsame date, Wright-Wilson waived his revocation hearing and legal representation\nand admitted to the new conviction. See C.R. at 67.\n             On January 24, 2022, the Board recommitted Wright-Wilson to an SCI\nas a convicted parole violator (CPV) based on his conviction for the New Charges.\nThe Board awarded 477 days of credit (or 1 year, 3 months, and 19 days) from May\n9, 2019 to August 28, 2020, for the time he spent in good standing at liberty on\n                                          2\n\fparole. See C.R. at 121. The Board calculated that Wright-Wilson owed 162 days\n(or 5 months and 9 days) of backtime. See id. The Board recomputed Wright-\nWilson\u2019s Original Sentence maximum release date as July 1, 2022. See id.\n               Wright-Wilson, pro se, filed an administrative remedies form alleging\ntherein:\n\n               I was recommitted to a[n SCI on] November 10[,] 2021[,]\n               as a parole violat[o]r. My backtime was suppose[d] to\n               start November 10[,] 2021[,] but instead it started January\n               24[,] 2022. So that\u2019s 75 days uncounted for towards the\n               backtime of 162 days that is presumed that I owe. That 75\n               days of uncounted time will take my [Original Sentence]\n               maximum [release] date in the system from July 1[,]\n               2022[,] to April 21[,] 2022. Another correction I will [sic]\n               like to be made is the additional 14 days that was added on\n               my [O]riginal [Sentence] maxi[mum release] date. My\n               [O]riginal [Sentence] maxi[mum release] date is\n               suppose[d] to be January 23[,] 2021[,] but in the system\n               it\u2019s February 6[,] 2021. That is an extra 14 days I\n               shouldn\u2019t be doing. So[,] deduct the 14 days from my\n               April 21[] date which would be April 7[,] 2022.\n\nC.R. at 126.\n               On September 9, 2022, construing Wright-Wilson\u2019s request for relief\nas a Petition for Administrative Review, the Board affirmed its decision. Wright-\nWilson appealed to this Court.2            On December 21, 2022, Counsel filed the\nApplication and no-merit letter. On January 4, 2023, this Court ordered that\nCounsel\u2019s Application would be considered along with the merits of Wright-\nWilson\u2019s appeal.\n               This Court must first review Counsel\u2019s no-merit letter.\n\n\n       2\n         \u201cThis Court\u2019s review determines whether the Parole Board\u2019s adjudication is supported by\nsubstantial evidence, whether an error of law has been committed, or whether constitutional rights\nhave been violated.

Pa. Bd. of Prob. &amp; Parole], 996 A.2d [40,] 43 [(Pa.\n             Cmwlth. 2010)] (quoting [Commonwealth v.] Turner, 544\n             A.2d [927,] 928 [(Pa. 1988)]) (some alterations omitted).\n             As long as a [no-merit] letter satisfies these basic\n             requirements, we may then review the soundness of a\n             petitioner\u2019s request for relief. However, if the [no-merit]\n             letter fails on technical grounds, we must deny the request\n             for leave to withdraw, without delving into the substance\n             of the underlying petition for review, and may direct\n             counsel to file either an amended request for leave to\n             withdraw or a brief on behalf of [his/her] client.\n\nAnderson v. Pa. Bd. of Prob. &amp; Parole, 237 A.3d 1203, 1207 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2020)\n(citation omitted). \u201c[C]ounsel must fully comply with the procedures outlined in\nTurner to ensure that each of the petitioner\u2019s claims has been considered and that\ncounsel has [] substantive reason[s] for concluding that those claims are meritless.\u201d\nHont v. Pa. Bd. of Prob. &amp; Parole, 680 A.2d 47, 48 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1996). Counsel\nis also required to \u201cnotify the parolee of his request to withdraw, furnish the parolee\nwith [] a copy of . . . [the] no-merit letter satisfying the requirements of Turner, and\ninform the parolee of his right to retain new counsel or submit a brief on his own\nbehalf.\u201d Reavis v. Pa. Bd. of Prob. &amp; Parole, 909 A.2d 28, 33 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2006).\nThis Court must then \u201cconduct its own independent review of the petition to\nwithdraw and must concur in counsel\u2019s assessment before [it] may grant counsel\nleave to withdraw.\u201d Hont, 680 A.2d at 48.\n             Here, Counsel\u2019s no-merit letter contains the procedural history of\nWright-Wilson\u2019s case, describes the issues raised in Wright-Wilson\u2019s Petition for\nAdministrative Review, and provides Counsel\u2019s review of the record and relevant\nlaw. Counsel represents therein that Wright-Wilson\u2019s chief challenge is that the\nBoard used incorrect dates to calculate his Original Sentence maximum release date.\n\n\n                                           4\n\fCounsel served Wright-Wilson with the no-merit letter and his Application, and\nnotified Wright-Wilson that he may either obtain substitute counsel or file a brief on\nhis own behalf.3 Further, Counsel provides sufficient reasons why Wright-Wilson\u2019s\nissues are without merit. See Counsel No-Merit Letter at 6-9. Accordingly, this\nCourt concludes that Counsel complied with Turner\u2019s technical requirements and\nwill now independently review the merits of Wright-Wilson\u2019s appeal to determine\nwhether to grant or deny Counsel\u2019s Application.\n                In accordance with Section 6138(a)(4) of the Prisons and Parole Code\n(Code), 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(a)(4), \u201c[t]he period for which the offender is required to\nserve shall be computed by the board and shall begin on the date that the parole\nviolator is taken into custody to be returned to the institution as an offender.\u201d In\naddition, Section 6138(a)(5) of the Code provides:\n\n                If a new sentence is imposed on the offender, the service\n                of the balance of the term originally imposed by a\n                Pennsylvania court shall precede the commencement of\n                the new term imposed in the following cases: (i) If a\n                person is paroled from a State correctional institution and\n                the new sentence imposed on the person is to be served in\n                the State correctional institution.\n\n61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(a)(5).\n\n\n                However, it is well established that the requirement that a\n                CPV serve the balance of his original sentence is\n                only operative once \u201cparole has been revoked and the\n                remainder of the original sentence becomes due and\n                owing.\u201d Campbell v. P[a.] B[d.] of Prob[. &amp;] Parole, . . .\n                409 A.2d 980, 982 ([Pa. Cmwlth.] 1980); see also Hill v.\n                P[a.] B[d.] of Prob[. &amp;] Parole, 683 A.2d 699, 702 (Pa.\n                Cmwlth. 1996) (holding that where the Board recommits\n                a CPV to serve the balance of the original sentence before\n                beginning service of a new term, the prisoner\u2019s service of\n\n      3\n          Wright-Wilson did not obtain substitute counsel or file a brief.\n                                                  5\n\f             backtime on the original sentence must be computed from\n             the date the Board revokes the prisoner\u2019s parole).\n             Therefore, \u201ccredit for time a CPV spends in custody\n             between imposition of a new sentence and revocation of\n             parole must be applied to the new sentence.\u201d Williams v.\n             P[a.] B[d.] of Prob[. &amp;] Parole, 654 A.2d 235, 237 (Pa.\n             Cmwlth. 1995). Parole revocation occurs once a hearing\n             examiner and Board member or two Board members sign\n             a hearing report recommitting a prisoner as a CPV. Wilson\n             v. P[a.] B[d.] of Prob[. &amp;] Parole, 124 A.3d 767, 770 (Pa.\n             Cmwlth. 2015); see also Palmer v. P[a.] B[d.] of Prob[.\n             &amp;] Parole, 134 A.3d 160, 166 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016) (same).\n\nBarnes v. Pa. Bd. of Prob. &amp; Parole, 203 A.3d 382, 391-92 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2019).\n             Here, the trial court credited Wright-Wilson with 431 days on his New\nSentence for the time he served between his arrest on August 28, 2020, and his\nNovember 1, 2021 conviction on the New Charges.\n             By September 9, 2022 decision, the Board affirmed its January 24, 2022\norder, explaining:\n\n             The Board paroled Wright-Wilson from a[n SCI] on May\n             9, 2019[,] with a maximum date of February 6, 2021[,] on\n             his [O]riginal [S]entence . . . . This means that Wright-\n             Wilson was left with 639 days remaining on his [O]riginal\n             [S]entence the day he was released. The Board in its\n             discretion awarded Wright-Wilson credit for the time\n             spent at liberty on parole based on his recommitment as a\n             [CPV]. 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(a)(2.1). This means the Board\n             applied credit for 477 days from May 9, 2019, the day\n             Wright-Wilson was released on parole, to August 28,\n             2020, the day that he was arrested for [N]ew [Charges] and\n             the day the Board\u2019s detainer was lodged against him. This\n             means that Wright-Wilson owed 639 - 477 = 162 days on\n             his [O]riginal [S]entence based on the recommitment.\n             Because Wright-Wilson failed to post bail on the [N]ew\n             [Charges], he is therefore not entitled to any pre-sentence\n             credit toward his [O]riginal [S]entence, pursuant to Gaito\n             v. Pennsylvania Board of Probation [&amp;] Parole, 412 A.2d\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f              568 (Pa. 1980).[4] Because he was sentenced to a new term\n              of state incarceration, the . . . Code provides that Wright-\n              Wilson must serve the balance of the [O]riginal [S]entence\n              first. 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(a)(5). However, that provision\n              did not take effect until the Board revoked [Wright-\n              Wilson\u2019s] parole. [See] Campbell . . . . This means that\n              Wright-Wilson became available[] to commence service\n              of his [O]riginal [S]entence on January 20, 2022, because\n              that is the day the Board obtained enough signatures to\n              declare him a parole violator. Adding 162 days to January\n              20, 2022[,] yields a recalculated maximum date of July 1,\n              2022. Thus, the Board properly recalculated [Wright-\n              Wilson\u2019s Original Sentence] maximum [release] date.\n\nC.R. at 130-131.\n              Wright-Wilson\u2019s Original Sentence maximum release date was\nFebruary 6, 2021. See C.R. at 2. The Board released Wright-Wilson on parole on\nMay 9, 2019. See C.R. at 10, 121. The police arrested Wright-Wilson on the New\nCharges on August 28, 2020, see C.R. at 39, and the Board\u2019s Warrant to Commit\nand Detain was issued on the same date. See C.R. at 38. Because he did not post\nbail, his detention time was credited to the New Sentence. Finally, the Board\u2019s\nRevocation Hearing Report reflects that the Board executed it on January 20, 2022.\nSee C.R. at 97-104. Accordingly, the Board properly determined it used the correct\ndates to calculate Wright-Wilson\u2019s Original Sentence maximum release date.\n              Based on the foregoing, this Court concludes that Counsel complied\nwith Turner\u2019s technical no-merit letter requirements, and confirms based upon an\n\n\n\n\n       4\n              Under Gaito, if a CPV satisfies bail requirements prior to sentencing\n              and is incarcerated solely on the Board\u2019s detainer, this period of\n              incarceration is credited to his original sentence. However, when\n              bail is not posted, the time incarcerated on both the new criminal\n              charges and the Board\u2019s detainer must apply to the new sentence.\nWhite v. Pa. Parole Bd., 276 A.3d 1247, 1256 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2022) (citation omitted).\n                                               7\n\findependent record review, that Wright-Wilson\u2019s appeal lacks merit. Accordingly,\nCounsel\u2019s Application is granted, and the Board\u2019s order is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                      _________________________________\n                                      ANNE E.
