'\r\n30.02(a)(3) (West 2003).\u00a0 The trial court assessed punishment at fifteen years\r\nin the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Institutional Division.\u00a0 By one\r\nissue, Torres contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to\r\nsuppress.\u00a0 We affirm.\r\n\r\nI.\u00a0 Standard of Review\r\n\r\nGenerally, we review the trial court's\r\nruling on a motion to suppress evidence for an abuse of discretion, using a\r\nbifurcated standard.\u00a0 Oles v.

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.21 (West 2005) (\"A\r\nstatement of an accused may be used in evidence against him if it appears that\r\nthe same was freely and voluntarily made without compulsion or persuasion . . .\r\n.\").\u00a0 However, the only evidence that supports Torres's claims is his own\r\ntestimony, all of which conflicts with testimony provided by Detective Sergio\r\nPerez, the investigator who took Torres's confession.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing, Detective Perez\r\ntestified that he told Torres that he was investigating a burglary in which\r\nTorres was implicated.\u00a0 After Detective Perez informed Torres of his Miranda\r\nrights, Torres confessed.\u00a0 And although Torres testified that he was promised\r\nhe would not be arrested in exchange for his statement implicating other\r\nindividuals and that \"[t]hey threatened to take [his] wife and stepdad and\r\ncall [Child Protective Services] and take [his] little daughter\" unless he\r\ncooperated, Detective Perez testified that the only \"inducement\" he\r\noffered Torres for his confession was that he would inform the District\r\nAttorney of Torres's cooperation in the case.\u00a0 See Garcia v. State, 919\r\nS.W.2d 370, 388 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (citing Sorola v. State, 674\r\nS.W.2d 809, 812 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 1984), aff'd, 693 S.W.2d 417\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1985)) (relying on the Sorola holding that the mere\r\nfact that the police officer told appellant he would inform the district\r\nattorney as to his cooperation or lack of same was not a promise so as to\r\nrender appellant's confession inadmissible).\r\n\r\nAfter judging the credibility and\r\ndemeanor of Torres and Detective Perez and the weight to be given their testimony,\r\nthe trial court determined that Torres's confession was voluntary and denied\r\nhis motion to suppress.\u00a0 See Garza, 213 S.W.3d at 346.\u00a0 Because the\r\ntrial court's decision turned on its evaluation of the credibility and demeanor\r\nof the witnesses in this case, we defer to the trial court's decision to give\r\ncredence to Detective Perez's testimony.\u00a0 See Amador, 221 S.W.3d at\r\n673.\u00a0 In this case, the record supports the trial court's implied findings that\r\nTorres was neither promised anything nor threatened with anything in exchange\r\nfor his confession and that he gave it voluntarily.[1]\u00a0\r\nSee Kelly, 204 S.W.3d at 818-19.\r\n\r\nViewing the record in the light most\r\nfavorable to the trial court's conclusion, we conclude that the trial court's\r\ndecision to deny the motion to suppress is within the zone of reasonable\r\ndisagreement.\u00a0 See Dixon, 206 S.W.3d at 590.\u00a0 The trial court did not\r\nabuse its discretion when it denied Torres's motion to suppress.\u00a0 See id.\u00a0\r\nWe overrule Torres's sole issue.\r\n\r\nIII.\u00a0\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWe affirm the judgment of the trial\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NELDA\r\nV.
