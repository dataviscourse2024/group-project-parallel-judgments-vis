Lucky\u201d is one and the same person, and that the difference in the name is a mere variance in the description of but one person, who was the owner of the property stolen, then the variance is immaterial, and the evidence sustains the charge of the indictment as to the ownership of the property.</p>",

Lucky,\u201d whereas the proof showed it to he the property of \u201c G. C. Lucky.\u201d Upon this point the court very properly and very correctly gave the law to the jury in the charge, and the jury passed upon the facts to which the charge was applicable, and settled the fact of the ownership of the property; and this court can see no sufficient reason to disturb the verdict. The judgment of the court below is affirmed, and the sentence of the law ordered to he pronounced.\nAffirmed.\n",
