Nez argues that his statements made to police at his parents\u2019 house should have been suppressed, because he was \u201cin custody\u201d once he admitted to police that he was involved in the murder, but was not advised of his Miranda rights. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, review the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress de novo, see United States v. Hayden, 260 F.3d 1062, 1066 (9th Cir.2001), and affirm.\nWe conclude that Nez was not subjected to a custodial interrogation in light of the totality of the circumstances: Nez, who was twenty-two at the time, was questioned at his home with his father present for approximately 90 minutes; the agents were not accusatory, did not apply pressure on Nez, did not have their weapons drawn, did not present Nez with any evidence of his guilt, did not tell Nez he was *581not free to leave or that he had to answer their questions; Nez was not handcuffed during the questioning; and Nez rode unhandcuffed in the front seat of the agents\u2019 car while voluntarily showing the agents the locations of the murders and burials. See Hayden, 260 F.3d at 1066 (outlining relevant factors for \u201cin custody\u2019 determination and stating the test as \u201cwhether a reasonable person in such circumstances would conclude after brief questioning that he or she would not be free to leave\u201d (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)); see also Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 2147-49, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004) (explaining the clearly established Supreme Court precedent on custodial interrogations); Stansbury v. California, 511 U.S. 318, 319, 114 S.Ct. 1526,128 L.Ed.2d 293 (1994) (emphasizing that officer\u2019s subjective and undisclosed view whether person is a suspect is irrelevant to \u201cin custody\u201d assessment).\nAFFIRMED.\n\n This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n\n",
