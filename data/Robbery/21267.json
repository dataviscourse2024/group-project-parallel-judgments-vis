See Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 19.03(a)(2) (Vernon Supp. 2010). We will\n\naffirm.\n\n      On October 14, 2007, Franklin and Sammie Lee Hicks Jr. were driving in\n\nFranklin\u2019s blue Cadillac when they noticed a white Suburban that looked like it\n\nwas being driven by a drunk driver. Franklin and Hicks decided to follow the\n\n      1\n          See Tex. R. App. P. 47.4.\n\fSuburban and rob the individuals who were inside\u2014Pedro Mendoza and\n\nAnastacio Zavala. Once the Suburban parked at the apartment complex where\n\nMendoza lived, Franklin and Hicks, who were carrying loaded guns, approached\n\nthe vehicle and robbed Mendoza and Zavala. During the course of the robbery,\n\nFranklin shot Mendoza twice, killing him. A jury convicted Franklin of capital\n\nmurder, and the trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment without parole. 2\n\nHicks entered into a plea agreement with the State and testified against Franklin\n\nat his trial.3\n\n       In a single point, Franklin argues that the State did not present sufficient\n\nevidence to corroborate Hicks\u2019s accomplice-witness testimony.4 He contends\n\nthat the State\u2019s case against Franklin \u2015indispensably rests on\u2016 Hicks\u2019s testimony,\n\nwhich \u2015establishes only that the offense occurred\u2016 and that Franklin \u2015might have\n\nbeen present at the scene.\u2016\n\n       Code of criminal procedure article 38.14 provides that a defendant cannot\n\nbe convicted of an offense upon the testimony of an accomplice without other\n\ncorroborating evidence \u2015tending to connect\u2016 the defendant to the offense. Tex.\n\n       2\n        The State did not seek the death penalty.\n       3\n       Under the plea agreement, the State agreed to recommend a term of\nimprisonment for Hicks of thirty-five years.\n       4\n        There is no dispute that Hicks was an accomplice. See Medina v. State,\n7 S.W.3d 633, 641 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1102 (2000)\n(defining accomplice as a person who participates before, during, or after the\ncommission of the crime and can be prosecuted for the same offense as the\ndefendant or for a lesser-included offense).\n\n\n                                         2\n\fCode Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.14 (Vernon 2005); see Simmons v. State, 282\n\nS.W.3d 504, 505 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009).       The accomplice-witness rule is a\n\nstatutorily imposed sufficiency review and is not derived from federal or state\n\nconstitutional principles that define the legal and factual sufficiency standards.\n\nCathey v. State, 992 S.W.2d 460, 462\u201363 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999), cert. denied,\n\n528 U.S. 1082 (2000).       When evaluating the sufficiency of corroboration\n\nevidence under the accomplice-witness rule, we \u2015eliminate the accomplice\n\ntestimony from consideration and then examine the remaining portions of the\n\nrecord to see if there is any evidence that tends to connect the accused with the\n\ncommission of the crime.\u2016 Clark v. State, 324 S.W.3d 620, 629 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort\n\nWorth 2010, pet. ref\u2019d) (quoting Solomon v. State, 49 S.W.3d 356, 361 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2001)). The corroborating evidence need not prove the defendant\u2019s\n\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt by itself.     Id.   Nor is it necessary for the\n\ncorroborating evidence to directly link the accused to the commission of the\n\noffense. Id. Rather, the evidence must simply link the accused in some way to\n\nthe commission of the crime and show that rational jurors could conclude that\n\nthis evidence sufficiently tended to connect the accused to the offense.\n\nSimmons, 282 S.W.3d at 508; see Malone v. State, 253 S.W.3d 253, 257 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2008) (stating that while mere presence at the scene of a crime is\n\ninsufficient to corroborate accomplice testimony, \u2015[p]roof that the accused was at\n\nor near the scene of the crime at or about the time of its commission, when\n\ncoupled with other suspicious circumstances, may tend to connect the accused\n\n\n                                        3\n\fto the crime so as to furnish sufficient corroboration to support a conviction\u2016). We\n\nreview the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict. Brown v.\n\nState, 270 S.W.3d 564, 567 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 2075\n\n(2009).\n\n      Hicks testified that on October 14, 2007, he and Franklin hung out at\n\nHicks\u2019s apartment for a while before leaving in Franklin\u2019s blue Cadillac. They\n\ncame across a white Suburban that looked like it was being driven by a drunk\n\ndriver and decided to follow it and rob its passengers.       According to Hicks,\n\nFranklin told him, \u2015Those are the kind of people I rob.\u2016 Hicks testified that once\n\nthe Suburban parked at an apartment complex, he and Franklin \u2015[g]ot [their] guns\n\nready\u2016 before exiting the Cadillac; Franklin had a .357 revolver that he kept in a\n\nwhite work glove in the pocket behind the passenger\u2019s seat and Hicks had a two-\n\nshot Derringer.   Hicks approached the passenger side of the Suburban and\n\nFranklin approached the driver\u2019s side, and Hicks noticed that both Mendoza and\n\nZavala were asleep.5      Hicks testified that he reached into Zavala\u2019s pocket\n\nthrough the open window and that he heard a gunshot after Franklin opened the\n\ndriver\u2019s side door and struck Mendoza with the gun. Franklin then came around\n\nto the passenger side of the vehicle, struck Zavala with the gun, and went\n\n\n      5\n        Mendoza and Zavala may have been passed out\u2014Zavala told a police\nofficer that he and Mendoza had been at a bar earlier in the night. Officer Matt\nJohnson testified that Zavala\u2019s breath smelled of alcohol, and Dr. Marc Krouse\ntestified that Mendoza\u2019s blood alcohol figure was .324, approximately four times\nthe legal limit for driving.\n\n\n                                         4\n\fthrough his pockets. As Hicks returned to the Cadillac, he saw Franklin move\n\nback around to the other side of the Suburban, stand over Mendoza, and shoot\n\nhim in the head. Later that night, Hicks told Princess Harris, the mother of his\n\ntwo children, some of the details about the incident.\n\n      Eliminating Hicks\u2019s accomplice testimony from consideration, the record\n\ncontains ample evidence to meet article 38.14\u2019s corroboration requirement.\n\nSpecifically,   Officer   Matt   Johnson   testified   that   he   interviewed   Maria\n\nMonegecarmona on October 14, 2007.             Monegecarmona, a resident of the\n\napartment complex where the murder occurred, told Johnson that she had\n\nobserved a disturbance involving two black males who were driving a black\n\nCadillac or Impala sedan.6 Authorities later located and seized a blue Cadillac\n\nsedan that was parked in the parking lot of the business where Franklin worked.\n\nInside of the vehicle, investigators discovered a driver\u2019s license and a Social\n\nSecurity card belonging to Franklin, a .357 revolver inside of a white glove in the\n\npocket behind the passenger\u2019s seat, and a partial cigar attached to a plastic tip in\n\nthe ashtray.\n\n      Jamie Becker, a firearm and tool mark examiner for the Tarrant County\n\nMedical Examiner\u2019s office, testified that she examined the .357 found in\n\nFranklin\u2019s Cadillac and the bullets recovered during Mendoza\u2019s autopsy. Based\n\n\n\n\n      6\n       Monegecarmona observed the vehicle at nighttime.\n\n\n                                           5\n\fon her test results, Becker opined that the .357 fired the bullets that were\n\nretrieved from Mendoza\u2019s body.\n\n      Investigators discovered a white work or garden glove lying on the ground\n\nnear the Suburban. Carolyn Van Winkle, an employee of the DNA Section of the\n\ncrime laboratory of the Tarrant County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, testified that\n\nshe compared a DNA sample belonging to Franklin with a DNA sample that had\n\nbeen collected from the white glove that was found on the ground near the crime\n\nscene and that the probability that the DNA from the glove belonged to someone\n\nother than Franklin was one in eleven quadrillion (11,000,000,000,000,000). 7\n\nMoreover, the glove looked similar to the glove that concealed the .357 inside of\n\nFranklin\u2019s Cadillac.\n\n      Investigators also discovered a small cigar attached to a plastic tip on the\n\nground near the crime scene. Visually, the cigar appears to be similar to the\n\npartial cigar discovered in Franklin\u2019s Cadillac.\n\n      Harris testified that Franklin came over to the apartment that she shared\n\nwith Hicks on October 14, 2007; that Franklin and Hicks later left the apartment in\n\nFranklin\u2019s blue Cadillac; and that Hicks was crying, shaking, and nervous after he\n\nreturned a few hours later. She also testified that Franklin kept two guns in his\n\ncar (a revolver and an automatic) and that Hicks had told her that he and Franklin\n\nhad robbed two Hispanic men and that Franklin had shot one of them in the\n\n      7\n      Van Winkle testified that there are only between six and seven billion\npeople on earth, a significantly smaller figure than eleven quadrillion.\n\n\n                                          6\n\fhead.    Marc Krouse, the chief deputy medical examiner for Tarrant County,\n\ntestified that the secondary cause of Mendoza\u2019s death was a gunshot wound to\n\nthe face.\n\n        Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we hold that\n\na rational factfinder could have concluded that the evidence detailed above\n\nsufficiently tended to connect Franklin to Mendoza\u2019s murder. See Tex. Code\n\nCrim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.14; Simmons, 282 S.W.3d at 508\u201309; Cathey, 992\n\nS.W.2d at 462\u201363. Accordingly, Hicks\u2019s accomplice testimony was sufficiently\n\ncorroborated under the requirement of article 38.14. We overrule Franklin\u2019s only\n\npoint and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    BILL MEIER\n                                                    JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: DAUPHINOT, GARDNER, and MEIER, JJ.\n\nDO NOT PUBLISH\nTex.
