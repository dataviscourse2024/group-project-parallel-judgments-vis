(Super. Ct. No. SCD277673)\n\n FERNANDO L. COTA,\n\n          Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n        APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County,\n\nEsteban Hernandez, Judge. Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.\n\n        Justin A. Behravesh, under appointment by the Court of Appeal, for Defendant\n\nand Appellant.\n\n        Xavier Becerra, Attorney General, Gerald A. Engler and Lance E. Winters, Chief\n\nAssistant Attorneys General, Julie L. Garland, Assistant Attorney General, Steven T.\n\nOetting and Anthony Da Silva, Deputy Attorneys General, for Plaintiff and Respondent.\n\f       Fernando L. Cota pled guilty to the felony offense of carrying a concealed dirk or\n\ndagger in exchange for three years of probation and the possibility that the charge might\n\nbe reduced to a misdemeanor at the end of one year. The trial court imposed various\n\nprobation conditions that Cota objected to in the trial court and challenges on appeal.\n\nBased on the Supreme Court's recent decision in In re Ricardo P. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1113,\n\n1122 (Ricardo P.), we conclude that the electronics search condition that the court\n\nimposed is unreasonable, but remand for further consideration of a potentially appropriate\n\nelectronics search condition. We uphold the remaining challenged conditions. Cota also\n\nchallenges the trial court's imposition of various fees and a restitution fine, arguing that\n\ndue process requires a finding of ability to pay before such charges may be imposed. He\n\nrequests remand to the trial court for a hearing to consider his ability to pay the fines and\n\nfees assessed at sentencing. We conclude that due process does not bar the imposition of\n\nthe assessments and fine that Cota challenges and that remand on this issue is therefore\n\nnot required. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.\n\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       Cota was seen swinging a machete attached to a long stick in a San Diego public\n\npark. His clothes were visibly soiled. Someone who observed his behavior called the\n\npolice, describing Cota as a violent mentally ill man. When police arrived, they found\n\nCota standing near a water fountain with the machete balanced on top of the fountain. In\n\nview of the officers, Cota sat down and pulled a six-inch drywall knife from his\n\nwaistband, placing it next to him. The officers arrested Cota for an outstanding\n\nmisdemeanor warrant after running a records check.\n\n                                              2\n\f       Cota was charged with a felony for unlawfully carrying a concealed weapon (dirk\n\nor dagger). (Pen. Code, \u00a7 21310.)1 He pled guilty to the charge in exchange for a\n\nrecommendation of three years formal probation and the anticipated reduction of his\n\nfelony conviction to a misdemeanor once he completed drug treatment and mental health\n\ncounseling.\n\n       The trial court accepted the recommendation and sentenced Cota to three years of\n\nprobation with several conditions. Cota objected to a condition compelling him to submit\n\nelectronic devices for search at any time when required by a probation or law\n\nenforcement officer. He also objected to conditions that he attend anger management\n\ncounseling and refrain from alcohol use if directed by his probation officer. The trial\n\ncourt imposed these conditions over Cota's objections.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n       Cota argues that we should strike the electronics search condition, the anger\n\nmanagement condition, and the alcohol use condition as unreasonable. We agree that\n\npermitting warrantless searches of Cota's electronic devices was an abuse of discretion\n\nbased on the Supreme Court's recent Ricardo P. decision. We uphold the remaining\n\nconditions as reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\n                                             3\n\f              1. Electronics Search Condition\n\n       Cota challenges the electronics search condition as unreasonable because it is\n\nunrelated to future criminal conduct. We review probation conditions for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. (People v. Olguin (2008) 45 Cal.4th 375, 379 (Olguin).)\n\n       Trial courts have wide latitude to impose conditions consistent with the twin aims\n\nof probation: rehabilitation of the defendant with minimal risk to the community.\n\n(\u00a7 1202.7; People v. Carbajal (1995) 10 Cal.4th 1114, 1120.) Nonetheless, any\n\nconditions must be reasonable. (\u00a7 1203.1; see also People v. Beal (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th\n\n84, 86 (Beal).) A condition of probation will be upheld as reasonable unless it meets all\n\nthree criteria outlined in People v. Lent (1975) 15 Cal.3d 481 (Lent): the condition\n\n\" ' \"(1) has no relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted, (2) relates to\n\nconduct which is not in itself criminal, and (3) requires or forbids conduct which is not\n\nreasonably related to future criminality.\" ' \" (Ricardo P., supra, 7 Cal.5th at p. 1118;\n\nOlguin, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 379.)\n\n       The electronics search condition satisfies the first two Lent criteria. There was no\n\nrelationship between electronic devices and the crime Cota pleaded guilty to\u2014possession\n\nof a concealed weapon, and using electronic devices is not inherently criminal. Since the\n\ncondition meets the first two prongs, it can survive review for abuse of discretion only if\n\nit regulates conduct that is reasonably related to future criminality.\n\n       The California Supreme Court recently clarified that the reasonableness inquiry of\n\nLent's third prong \"contemplates a degree of proportionality between the burden imposed\n\nby a probation condition and the legitimate interests served by the condition.\" (Ricardo\n\n                                              4\n\fP., supra, 7 Cal.5th at p. 1122.)2 When significant privacy interests are implicated by a\n\nprobation condition (such as sweeping electronics searches without a warrant), the burden\n\nimposed on a defendant is a heavy one. Such a condition is unreasonable unless it is\n\n\"proportional to achieving some legitimate end of probation.\" (Id. at p. 1127.)\n\nReasonableness necessitates \"more than just an abstract or hypothetical relationship\n\nbetween the probation condition and preventing future criminality.\" (Id. at p. 1121.) In\n\nother words, to justify a burdensome condition, there must be a specific relationship\u2014\n\ngrounded in the facts of the case\u2014between the condition and preventing future\n\ncriminality.\n\n       Ricardo P. involved a juvenile who admitted having committed a felony burglary\n\nand subsequently challenged a probation condition allowing warrantless searches of his\n\nelectronic devices and accounts. (Ricardo P., supra, 7 Cal.5th at p. 1115.) The trial\n\ncourt justified the search condition as useful in monitoring Ricardo's compliance with the\n\nterms of his probation because it allowed officers to look for electronic communications\n\nabout drugs. Nothing on the record showed that the juvenile had in fact used his phone to\n\npurchase drugs. The trial court's reasoning was based on a generalization that juveniles\n\nuse their phones to buy drugs and brag about drug use online. (Id. at p. 1119.) The\n\nSupreme Court struck the condition under Lent, finding that the condition was not\n\n\n\n\n2       Ricardo P. was decided after the initial briefing in this case was complete. We\nlater requested supplemental briefing from the parties on this issue in light of Ricardo P.\n\n                                             5\n\freasonably related to Ricardo's future criminality because it disproportionately burdened\n\nhis privacy interest without specific and substantial justification. (Id. at p. 1126.)\n\n       The same issues that were of concern to the Supreme Court in Ricardo P. are\n\npresent in this case. Under the terms of his probation, Cota's electronic devices can be\n\nsearched at any time without a warrant. This implicates a significant privacy interest. As\n\nin Ricardo P., the trial court imposed the condition to make it easier to monitor Cota's\n\ncompliance with other probation terms.3 In both cases, the condition was premised on a\n\ngeneral assumption that drug users routinely negotiate drug purchases with their phones.\n\nThere was no reference to Cota's specific actions.4 A case-specific rationale that would\n\nmake this burden proportional is no more present here than it was in Ricardo P. Mere\n\nconvenience in monitoring a parolee's conduct, coupled with generic descriptions of how\n\nsome people use cell phones, are not sufficient to render this burden on Cota's privacy\n\ninterests reasonable.\n\n       The Supreme Court made it clear that \"requiring a probationer to surrender\n\nelectronic devices and passwords to search at any time is . . . burdensome and intrusive,\n\nand requires a correspondingly substantial and particularized justification.\" (Ricardo P.,\n\n\n\n3      At sentencing, the People explained they were asking for the electronics search\ncondition because \"he's got to be successful for a year, and the People feel it's appropriate\nto have the appropriate tools to monitor him for that year to make sure he's successful.\"\n\n4       At sentencing, the prosecutor remarked that \"the People think [the electronics\nsearch condition is] absolutely appropriate especially in a case in which he's currently\ninvolved in drug treatment. . . . [C]ertainly people acquire drugs usually by the means of\na cell phone or some other electronic device . . . .\"\n\n                                              6\n\fsupra, 7 Cal.5th at p. 1126.) There is no substantial and particularized justification in the\n\nrecord in this case. The electronics search condition thus meets all three Lent criteria and\n\nis therefore unreasonable.5\n\n       Indeed, the People concede in supplemental briefing that the electronics search\n\ncondition is overly burdensome and request that we remand to permit the trial court to\n\ncraft a more narrowly tailored search condition. We do not foreclose the possibility that a\n\nnarrower electronics search condition might be appropriate in this case based on facts that\n\nare not reflected in the current record. We strike the condition, but do so without\n\nprejudice to the People, who may demonstrate to the trial court with additional facts that\n\na more narrowly drawn electronics search condition is proportionate to the burden on\n\nCota's privacy interest.\n\n              2. Other Challenged Probation Conditions\n\n       Cota argues that the imposition of alcohol-related probation conditions is\n\nunreasonable under Lent because it is not reasonably related to future criminality. We\n\ndisagree.\n\n       Defense counsel challenged only one of four alcohol-related conditions at\n\nsentencing\u20148.b.\u2014which requires that Cota not knowingly use or possess alcohol if so\n\ndirected by his probation officer. As Cota concedes, any challenge to alcohol-related\n\n\n\n\n5     Because we find the electronics search condition unreasonable under Lent, we\nneed not reach Cota's assertion that the condition is unconstitutionally overbroad.\n\n                                              7\n\fconditions other than 8.b. is forfeited. (People v. Welch (1993) 5 Cal.4th 228, 230.) We\n\ntherefore proceed to address Cota's challenge to 8.b.\n\n       As with Cota's challenge to the electronics search condition, the first two Lent\n\ncriteria are met. Possessing or using alcohol is unrelated to Cota's offense and is legal for\n\nsomeone his age.6 This leaves the third criterion for our consideration\u2014whether\n\nrestricting Cota's use and possession of alcohol is reasonably related to his future\n\ncriminality.\n\n       Cota relies on People v. Kiddoo (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 922, in which the\n\nappellate court struck a probation condition restricting alcohol use because it was not\n\nrelated to the defendant's offense of possessing methamphetamine. (Id. at pp. 927\u2013928.)\n\nHowever, alcohol is a drug\u2014albeit a legal one. This court has previously made clear that\n\n\"we disagree with the fundamental assumptions in Kiddoo that alcohol and drug abuse\n\nare not reasonably related and that alcohol use is unrelated to future criminality where the\n\ndefendant has a history of substance abuse.\" (Beal, supra, 60 Cal.App.4th at p. 87;\n\naccord People v. Balestra (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 57, 69.)\n\n       Cota disclosed to the probation department that he is a habitual user of\n\nmethamphetamine and a daily user of marijuana. He has prior convictions for being\n\nunder the influence of a controlled substance, possession of marijuana for sale,\n\npossession of a controlled substance, and possession of drug paraphernalia. His history\n\n\n\n6     We do not find support in the record for the People's speculation that Cota may\nhave been under the influence of alcohol when he was arrested in the park.\n\n                                              8\n\fof substance abuse is well documented. In the past, in upholding alcohol conditions like\n\nthe condition that the trial court imposed on Cota, we have noted that there is an\n\nempirical nexus between drugs and alcohol. (Beal, supra, 60 Cal.App.4th at p. 87.) It\n\nwould make little sense to deprive Cota's probation officer of the power to direct Cota\n\naway from alcohol as a substitute mind-altering substance when his substance abuse\n\nhistory is so clearly demonstrated.\n\n       The Beal court noted that \"alcohol use may lead to future criminality where the\n\ndefendant has a history of substance abuse.\"7 (Beal, supra, 60 Cal.App.4th at p. 87.) We\n\ntherefore conclude that the trial court's imposition of alcohol-related probation conditions\n\nwas reasonably related to preventing future crimes, given Cota's history of drug use.\n\n       Cota next challenges the anger management condition as unreasonable under the\n\nthird prong of Lent. We conclude that it, too, is reasonable under the circumstances.\n\n       Cota cites his lack of convictions for violent crimes and an unclear connection\n\nbetween his crime and displays of anger. But a history of violent crime and overt\n\ndisplays of anger are not necessary preconditions for giving a probation officer discretion\n\n\n\n\n7       Cota asks us to distinguish his case from Beal because Beal was charged with a\ndrug crime (Beal, supra, 60 Cal.App.4th at p. 85), whereas Cota was charged with\nillegally possessing a weapon. While we recognize that Cota's case differs factually from\nBeal's in this respect, review of a probation restriction on alcohol use is a fact-specific\ninquiry. (People v. Lindsay (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1642, 1644.) The fact that Cota was\nnot, in this instance, convicted of a drug-related offense would clearly be relevant to\nLent's first prong, but it does not mean that the reasoning in Beal with respect to an\nalcohol condition being reasonably related to future criminality is inapplicable to Cota's\nsituation.\n\n                                             9\n\fto direct a probationer to an anger management program. Several facts in the record\n\nmake the condition reasonable. Cota encountered the police because he was swinging a\n\nmachete in a public park, and he frightened someone enough to prompt a call to law\n\nenforcement. The caller described Cota as violent and mentally ill. When the police\n\narrived, Cota revealed another weapon\u2014the six-inch knife that led to the charge of which\n\nhe was ultimately convicted. He has a prior conviction for the manufacture of weapons\n\nand has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.8 These facts could reasonably\n\nlead the trial court to conclude that Cota might benefit from anger management and that\n\nsuch a tool could help prevent future criminal activity.9\n\n              3. The trial court did not violate Cota's right to due process in\n                 imposing various fees and a restitution fine without first\n                 determining his ability to pay\n\n       At his sentencing in November 2018, Cota was assessed a $40 court operations fee\n\n(\u00a7 1465.8), a $30 criminal conviction fee (Gov. Code, \u00a7 70373), a $300 minimum\n\nrestitution fine (\u00a71202.4, subd. (b)), and a $30 county collection fee (id., \u00a71202.4, subd.\n\n\n\n\n8      Clinical evidence links schizophrenic conditions with violence. This correlation is\nexacerbated with comorbid substance abuse. (Walsh et al., Violence and schizophrenia:\nexamining the evidence (June 2002) British Journal of Psychiatry, Vol. 180, pp. 490\u2013\n495.) We do not intend to imply that all people with schizophrenic conditions are prone\nto violence. Rather, we merely observe that it is not irrational to consider Cota's mental\nhealth in determining the reasonableness of an anger management program.\n\n9       The court's imposition of anger management was qualified; the court invested\nCota's probation officer with the authority to direct Cota to a program if the officer deems\nit a helpful supplement to his other mental health treatment. Creating this option seems\nmanifestly reasonable to us given the facts of the case.\n\n                                             10\n\f(l)). Cota did not challenge the fine or fees and the trial court did not conduct a hearing\n\nto determine his ability to pay.\n\n       Two months after Cota's sentencing hearing, the Court of Appeal decided People\n\nv. Due\u00f1as (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 1157 (Due\u00f1as), holding that criminal defendants have a\n\ndue process right to an ability to pay hearing before fines and fees are imposed. (Id. at p.\n\n1172.) Cota relies on Due\u00f1as to argue that he is entitled to such a hearing.\n\n       The People's primary response to Cota's argument is that any ability to pay\n\nargument was forfeited because he did not object to the fines and fees at sentencing. We\n\nexercise our discretion to consider Cota's claim on the merits, notwithstanding any\n\npossible forfeiture. (See People v. Williams (1998) 17 Cal.4th 148, 161, fn. 6 [reviewing\n\ncourts have discretion to excuse forfeiture].)\n\n       In Due\u00f1as, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th 1157 at page 1167, the court held that due\n\nprocess precludes a trial court from \"impos[ing]\" certain assessments and fines when\n\nsentencing a criminal defendant in the absence of determination that the defendant has a\n\n\"present ability to pay\" those assessments and fines. Specifically, Due\u00f1as held that \"due\n\nprocess of law requires [a] trial court to . . . ascertain a defendant's present ability to pay\n\nbefore it imposes\" (1) \"court facilities and court operations assessments\" (under \u00a7 1465.8\n\nand Gov. Code, \u00a7 70373, respectively), or (2) a restitution fine (under \u00a7 1202.4).\n\n(Due\u00f1as, supra, at pp. 1164, 1167, 1172.)\n\n       More recently, however, another Court of Appeal opinion questioned whether\n\n\"Due\u00f1as's expansion of the boundaries of due process\" to provide an additional\n\n\"protection not conferred by either [of Due\u00f1as's] foundational pillars\" is a \"correct\n\n                                               11\n\finterpretation,\" and ultimately concluded that it is not. (People v. Hicks (2019) 40\n\nCal.App.5th 320, 327, review granted Nov. 26, 2019, S258946 (Hicks).) In considering\n\nthe issue, the Hicks court noted that Due\u00f1as rests on \"two strands of due process\n\nprecedent,\" the first of which \"secures a due process-based right of access to the courts\"\n\n(italics omitted), and the second of which \"erects a due process-based bar to incarceration\n\nbased on the failure to pay criminal penalties when that failure is due to a criminal\n\ndefendant's indigence rather than contumaciousness.\" (Id. at p. 325\u2013326.) Hicks\n\nexplains, neither of these strands \"dictate[s]\" Due\u00f1as's result. (Id. at p. 326.) For this\n\nreason, and because Due\u00f1as \"is inconsistent with the purposes and operation of\n\nprobation\" (id. at p. 327), the court in Hicks concluded that \"due process does not speak\n\nto [the] issue [of how best to balance the competing interests of indigent defendants and\n\nan operable court and victim restitution system] and . . . Due\u00f1as was wrong to conclude\n\notherwise.\" (Id. at p. 329, first italics added.)\n\n       We find the Hicks court's analysis of the due process issue to be persuasive, and\n\nadopt the holding in Hicks that \"[n]either strand [of due process precedent] bars the\n\nimposition of [the] assessments and the . . . restitution fine\" even as to a defendant who is\n\nunable to pay. (Hicks, supra, 40 Cal.App.5th at p. 329.) Like the defendant in Hicks,\n\nCota has not, to date, been denied access to the courts or been incarcerated as a result of\n\nthe imposition of these financial obligations. No remand for an ability to pay hearing is\n\ntherefore necessary.\n\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f                                        DISPOSITION\n\n       We strike the electronics search condition and remand to the trial court to permit\n\nthe court to attempt to fashion a more narrowly drawn electronics search condition,\n\nconsistent with this opinion. We uphold all other probation conditions and the fine and\n\nfees that the trial court imposed. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                                       AARON, J.\n\nI CONCUR:\n\nHALLER, Acting P.

Due\u00f1as (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th 1157 (Due\u00f1as), Velia Due\u00f1as sought\n\nrelief from a poverty-driven cycle of debt-to-incarceration. As a teenager, she incurred\n\nthree citations and over $1000 in assessments. When she could not pay, the state\n\nsuspended her driver's license. She could not afford the fees for reinstatement and\n\naccumulated misdemeanor convictions and further debt from driving on the suspended\n\nlicense. When given the choice, she opted for incarceration over incurring further debt\n\nfor nonpayment. The court of appeal agreed with Due\u00f1as that imposing fines and fees1\n\non defendants without consideration of their ability to pay violates due process. (Id. at\n\npp. 1161, 1164.)\n\n       That Due\u00f1as was a homeless mother of two with cerebral palsy undoubtedly\n\nhighlighted the unfairness of her situation. But her appeal called attention to issues of\n\nbroad and increasing significance: whether and to what extent is it appropriate to finance\n\ngovernment services\u2014in particular, the judicial system\u2014with fines and fees assessed\n\nagainst convicted criminal defendants? And what recourse does an indigent defendant\n\nhave to challenge the imposition of fines and fees on the basis that he or she lacks the\n\nability to pay?\n\n\n\n\n1     Specifically, Due\u00f1as addressed the imposition of a restitution fine (Pen. Code,\n\u00a7 1202.4), court operations fee (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1465.8), and court facilities fee (Gov. Code,\n\u00a7 70373).\n\f       Fines have long been a part of criminal sentencing.2 But fees are a relatively\n\nrecent addition, coinciding with the exponential growth of the American correctional\n\npopulation in the last 40 years.3 As criminal justice costs skyrocketed,4 states\n\nincreasingly sought to offset expenditures without raising taxes.5 Between the early-\n\n1980's and the mid-2000's, the national percentage of prisoners who were assessed fees\n\nand fines rose from about 12 percent to over 65 percent,6 making monetary sanctions a\n\nfixture of the criminal justice system. California has been no exception to this national\n\n\n\n2      See Gorod & Frazelle, Timbs v. Indiana: Mere Constitutional Housekeeping or\nthe Timely Revival of A Critical Safeguard?

But is it a constitutional problem? In summary fashion,\n\nand relying exclusively on People v. Hicks (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 320, review granted\n\nNovember 26, 2019, S258946 (Hicks), the majority dismiss Cota's arguments as devoid\n\nof any legitimate constitutional concerns. Hicks, we are told, persuasively concluded that\n\nDue\u00f1as got it wrong when it comes to a due process analysis. Cota wasn't denied access\n\nto the courts, and he wasn't incarcerated for failing to pay any fines or fees. That's the\n\nsum and substance of the due process guarantee. If there is a problem, it's the\n\nLegislature's to address.\n\n       But is there more to it?\n\n       In the year since its filing, the Due\u00f1as decision has generated abundant discussion\n\nand debate. Outside of Hicks, however, the bulk of that discussion has not concerned\n\nwhether a criminal defendant's ability to pay has any role to play in defining a\n\nconstitutional threshold for the assessment of fines and fees. Rather, the principal debate\n\nhas focused on how to frame and analyze a constitutional challenge, and specifically\n\nwhether due process principles or the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause\n\nprovide the most appropriate vehicle for the analysis.\n\n\n\n13      <https://judicature.duke.edu/articles/fixing-fees-fines-bail-toward-a-fairer-system-\nof-justice/> [as of February 25, 2020], archived at .\n\n                                              6\n\f       The essence of Cota's argument is that certain fines and fees, even though they are\n\n\"mandatory\" by terms of the applicable statute, cannot be constitutionally imposed on\n\nhim because he has no ability to pay them. Cota requests a hearing at which he can\n\npresent evidence of his inability to pay. Because his opening brief was filed less than\n\nthree months after Due\u00f1as was decided, Cota's counsel understandably relied on a due\n\nprocess analysis, but the particular constitutional label he attaches to his argument is\n\nunimportant. (See City of Revere v. Massachusetts General Hosp. (1983) 463 U.S. 239,\n\n243\u2212244 [plaintiff's claim, mislabeled as an Eighth Amendment issue, properly found to\n\nbe a violation of due process].) The critical question is whether a defendant's ability to\n\npay is appropriately considered in determining whether there are constitutional\n\nlimitations on the amounts of fines and fees imposed. If it is, Cota should be afforded a\n\nhearing at which he can attempt to make his case.\n\n       The United States Supreme Court \"has long been sensitive to the treatment of\n\nindigents in our criminal justice system.\" (Bearden v. Georgia (1983) 461 U.S. 660,\n\n664.) The Due Process Clause provides a general framework to \"analyze the fairness of\n\nrelations between the criminal defendant and the State.\" (Id. at p. 665; see id. at\n\npp. 672\u2212673 [revoking probation based on a failure to pay without finding such failure\n\nwas willful \"would be contrary to the fundamental fairness required by the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment\"].) Although Due\u00f1as applied a due process framework, another approach\n\ninvokes the Eighth Amendment, which aims \"to limit the government's power to punish.\"\n\n(Austin v. United States (1993) 509 U.S. 602, 609 (Austin).) Tracing its roots to Magna\n\nCarta, the Excessive Fines Clause restricts the government's power to extract payments as\n\n\n                                              7\n\fpunishment for some offense. (Timbs v. Indiana (2019) ___ U.S. ___, [139 S.Ct. 682,\n\n687] (Timbs).) Sanctions fall within the scope of this clause if they are at least partly\n\npunitive. (Austin, at p. 621 [rejecting argument that civil in rem forfeiture was not\n\npunitive simply because \"the forfeited assets serve to compensate the Government for the\n\nexpense of law enforcement activity and for its expenditure on societal problems\"].)\n\n       One of the flaws in Hicks, supra, 40 Cal.App.5th 320, review granted\u2014and in the\n\nmajority's reliance on it here\u2014is its failure to even consider an alternative Eighth\n\nAmendment analysis, applicable to some or all of the fines and fees, that would include\n\nan evaluation of the defendant's ability to pay.14 Even as they have questioned aspects\n\nof its due process reasoning, several post-Due\u00f1as opinions have recognized that a\n\ndefendant's ability to pay is an appropriate and sometimes critical factor in applying the\n\nEighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause. Indeed, the California Supreme Court has\n\nacknowledged that both due process and Eighth Amendment analyses incorporate similar\n\nconcepts\u2014including ability to pay\u2014and that it often \"makes no difference whether we\n\nexamine the issue as an excessive fine or a violation of due process.\" (People ex rel.\n\nLockyer v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (2005) 37 Cal.4th 707, 728.) Due\u00f1as made the\n\n\n\n\n14     In People v. Caceres (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 917, the court rejected a Due\u00f1as due\nprocess challenge and declined to discuss an Eighth Amendment approach suggested by\nthe Attorney General, citing a case for the generic proposition that an appellate court can\nrefuse to consider issues not properly raised in the opening brief. (Id. at p. 923.) But the\nissue here has been properly raised\u2014whether criminal defendants may be\nconstitutionally assessed fines and fees in an amount they have no ability to pay. The\nonly defect, if there is one here or in Caceres, is defense counsel's failure to attach the\nright constitutional label to the argument. A mistake in labeling is an insufficient basis to\nrefuse even to consider an otherwise proper and potentially meritorious argument.\n                                              8\n\fsame observation in charting its course. (Due\u00f1as, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p. 1171, fn. 8;\n\nsee also People v. Belloso (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 647, 660.)\n\n       Given the procedural posture of this case\u2014Cota has never had a hearing at which\n\nhe could present evidence of his financial condition\u2014it is unnecessary at this juncture to\n\nextensively analyze or definitively resolve how a defendant's ability to pay should affect\n\nthe imposition of fines and fees. I am inclined to agree with those courts, including ours,\n\nthat have preferred an Eighth Amendment analysis at least as to fines such as the\n\nrestitution fine in this case. (See, e.g., People v. Kopp (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 47, 96,\n\nrev.gr. Nov. 13, 2019, S257844; People v. Aviles (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1071.)\n\nFines are clearly punitive, and given an available Eighth Amendment analysis that\n\nconsiders ability to pay (along with other factors), the safety net provided by broader\n\nprinciples of due process seems unnecessary.15 Whether fees and assessments imposed\n\non convicted defendants are sufficiently punitive to invoke the Eighth Amendment\n\npresents a closer question, but we must keep in mind that the standard asks merely\n\nwhether they are partially punitive.
