Jones,\n\nDefendant-Appellant.\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Central District of Illinois.\nNo. 00-CR-30016--Richard Mills, Judge.\n\nArgued May 17, 2001--Decided January 28, 2002\n\n\n\n  Before Harlington Wood, Jr., Kanne, and\nRovner, Circuit Judges.\n\n  Kanne, Circuit Judge. Defendant Shawn W.\nJones pleaded guilty to three counts of\ncriminal contempt in violation of 18\nU.S.C. sec. 401 on August 29, 2000. On\nJanuary 4, 2001, the district court\nentered an order sentencing Jones to 76\nmonths imprisonment, three years of\nsupervised release, and a $300 special\nassessment. In imposing the imprisonment\nterm, the district court applied an\nupward departure from the Sentencing\nGuidelines because of Jones\u2019 failure to\ncomply with a cooperation agreement that\nhe entered into with the government on\nJune 8, 1995. On appeal, Jones argues\nthat: 1) the district court\u2019s grounds for\napplying the upward departure were\nimproper and 2) the extent of the upward\ndeparture in this case was unreasonable.\nWe affirm.\n\nI.   History\n\n  On March 3, 1995, Jones was convicted of\nconspiracy to distribute cocaine and\nmarijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. sec.\n846 and of possession of cocaine and\nmarijuana with the intent to distribute\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. sec. 841(a)(1)\n(\"drug convictions\"). Prior to sentencing\nfor the drug convictions, Jones entered\ninto a cooperation agreement\n\f(\"Agreement\") with the government on June\n8, 1995. The Agreement stated, in\nrelevant part, that Jones would \"provide\ncomplete and truthful testimony to any\ngrand jury, trial jury, judge, or\nmagistrate in any proceeding in which he\nmay be called to testify by the\ngovernment.\" In exchange, the Agreement\nprovided, among other things, that the\ngovernment would recommend that the\ndistrict court apply a downward departure\nto Jones\u2019 sentence for the drug\nconvictions based on the \"government\u2019s\nevaluation of the nature, extent, value\nand timeliness of [Jones\u2019] assistance.\"\nFurther, it provided that \"[a]ny material\nbreach of any provision\" of the Agreement\nby Jones \"would void [the Agreement] in\nits entirety.\"\n\n  Pursuant to the Agreement, on December\n27, 1995, Jones testified in front of a\ngrand jury investigating Robert Scott\nabout his and Scott\u2019s involvement in the\nactivities that gave rise to the drug\nconvictions. As a result, on April 1,\n1996, the government moved for a downward\ndeparture to Jones\u2019 drug sentence\npursuant to United States Sentencing\nGuideline sec. 5K1.1./1 In that motion,\nthe government noted that the sentencing\nrange applicable to Jones\u2019 drug\nconvictions was 188 to 235 months\nimprisonment and asked the district court\nto reduce Jones\u2019 sentence to 162 months\nimprisonment. The district court entered\nan order granting the government\u2019s\ndownward departure motion, stating that\n\"it accepted the Government\u2019s sec. 5K1.1\nmotion proposing a downward departure to\n162 months,\" but that it \"concluded that\na sentence of 144 months was\nappropriate.\"\n\n  In late 1998, the government requested\nthat Jones provide further grand jury\ntestimony about the activities underlying\nthe drug convictions. To that end, on\nJanuary 7, 1999, the government filed a\nmotion to obtain a grant of immunity for\nJones pursuant to 18 U.S.C. sec.sec.\n6002-6003 and for an order compelling\nJones to testify before the grand jury.\nThe district court granted the\ngovernment\u2019s motion in full and ordered\nJones to testify before the grand jury.\nHowever, on January 7, 1999, when brought\nbefore the grand jury, Jones refused to\ntake oath or to provide testimony.\nThereafter, Jones again refused to\n\ftestify before the grand jury, despite\nbeing ordered by the district court to do\nso. The government then filed a motion to\nhold Jones in civil contempt, but the\ndistrict court deferred ruling on the\nmotion in order to provide Jones with\nanother opportunity to testify before the\ngrand jury. On February 3, 1999, Jones\nappeared before the grand jury and for a\nthird time, refused to take oath or\ntestify. That same day, the district\ncourt held Jones in civil contempt. In\nJune, 1999, thegovernment obtained an\nindictment against Scott.\n\n  On December 1, 1999, the government\nfiled a motion to request a grant of\nimmunity for Jones and for an order\ncompelling him to testify at Scott\u2019s\ntrial. After the district court granted\nthis motion, Jones refused to testify at\nScott\u2019s trial and was held in civil\ncontempt for a second time. Scott\u2019s trial\nended in a mistrial after the jury was\nunable to reach a verdict. On April 3,\n2000, the government filed a motion to\nobtain a grant of immunity for Jones and\nfor an order compelling him to testify at\nScott\u2019s second trial. After the district\ncourt granted this motion, Jones refused\nto testify at Scott\u2019s second trial and\nwas held in civil contempt for a third\ntime. Eventually, Jones\u2019 1995 grand jury\ntestimony was read into the record at\nScott\u2019s second trial, and Scott was\nconvicted.\n\n  On May 5, 2000, Jones was charged in a\nsuperseding indictment with three counts\nof criminal contempt pursuant to 18\nU.S.C. sec. 401. Count 1 of the\nindictment charged Jones with criminal\ncontempt due to his three refusals to\nprovide grand jury testimony. Count 2\ncharged Jones with criminal contempt due\nto his refusal to testify at Scott\u2019s\nfirst trial, and Count 3 for his refusal\nto testify at Scott\u2019s second trial. On\nAugust 29, 2000, Jones pleaded guilty to\nall three counts of criminal contempt.\nThereafter, the probation office\ndetermined that Jones should be sentenced\nunder Guideline sec. 2X3.1 (Accessory\nAfter the Fact) rather than under the\nmore lenient Guideline sec. 2J1.5\n(Failure to Appear by Material Witness),\nand recommended a sentencing range of 57\nto 71 months imprisonment.\n\n  At Jones\u2019 sentencing hearing on January\n\f2, 2001, the district court admonished\nJones for refusing to comply with the\nAgreement, but found that because there\nwas no evidence that Jones intended to\nobstruct justice, Guideline sec. 2X3.1\ndid not apply./2 Applying Guideline sec.\n2J1.5, the district court determined that\nJones\u2019 offense level was 7, resulting in\na sentencing range of 4 to 10 months\nimprisonment.\n\n  The government then moved for an upward\ndeparture pursuant to Guideline sec.\n5K2.0./3 Under that Guideline, an upward\ndeparture would be appropriate if Jones\u2019\nrefusal to testify distinguished his\n\"case from the \u2019heartland\u2019 cases covered\nby\" Guideline sec. 2J1.5. U.S.S.G. sec.\n5K2.0. The government requested that the\ndistrict court apply a 17-level upward\ndeparture and sentence Jones to 71 months\nimprisonment. The district court granted\nthe government\u2019s departure motion and\nstated that its decision to apply an\nupward departure to Jones\u2019 sentence was\nbased on Jones\u2019 repeated refusals to\ntestify and on this court\u2019s decision in\nUnited States v. Simmons, 215 F.3d 737,\n743 (7th Cir. 2000) (upholding upward\ndeparture based on Guideline sec. 5K2.0\nfor defendant\u2019s failure to comply with\nplea agreement requiring him to testify\nin future proceedings).\n\n  On January 4, 2001, the district court\nentered an order stating that as in\nSimmons, 215 F.3d at 743, Jones\u2019 actions\nwarranted an upward departure in the\namount necessary to take away the benefit\nconferred upon Jones in 1996. The\ndistrict court calculated that the\nbenefit of the1996 downward departure was\n66 months,/4 and it added this amount to\nthe 10 month sentence that was the upper\nend of the applicable range. Thus, the\ndistrict court sentenced Jones to 76\nmonths imprisonment on each of the three\ncriminal contempt counts, to be served\nconcurrently.\n\nII.    Analysis\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n  On appeal, Jones alleges that: 1) the\ndistrict court\u2019s grounds for applying the\nupward departure were improper and 2) the\nextent of the upward departure in this\ncase was unreasonable. We review a\ndistrict court\u2019s decision to depart from\n\fthe Sentencing Guidelines for abuse of\ndiscretion and accept the findings of\nfact underlying the departure unless they\nare clearly erroneous. See id. at 741.\nJones does not contend that the district\ncourt\u2019s findings of fact were in error.\nFurther, we review the district court\u2019s\ndetermination of the extent of the\ndeparture for abuse of discretion, and\n\"will uphold the extent of the departure\ntaken as long as it is reasonable and\nadequately reflects the structure of the\nGuidelines.\" Id. (quotation omitted).\n\nB. Appropriateness of Grounds for\nDeparture\n\n  The Sentencing Guidelines direct\ndistrict courts to apply Guideline sec.\n2X5.1 when sentencing defendants for\ncriminal contempt. See U.S.S.G. sec.\n2J1.1. In turn, Guideline sec. 2X5.1\ndirects courts to apply the \"most\nanalogous guideline,\" U.S.S.G. sec.\n2X5.1, because \"misconduct constituting\ncontempt varies significantly.\" U.S.S.G.\nsec. 2J1.1. In this case, the district\ncourt chose to sentence Jones under\nGuideline sec. 2J1.5 (Failure to Appear\nby Material Witness) because Jones\u2019\ncriminal contempt consisted of failing to\ntestify before Scott\u2019s grand jury and at\nScott\u2019s trials, as he was required to do\nunder the Agreement. We conclude that the\ndistrict court correctly chose the most\nanalogous Guideline. See Simmons, 215\nF.3d at 742 (stating that Guideline sec.\n2J1.5 defines the \"most closely analogous\n[behavior] to [a] refusal to comply with\nan order to testify\"). The district court\nthen noted that the applicable sentencing\nrange under Guideline sec. 2J1.5 was 4 to\n10 months imprisonment.\n\n  After choosing the applicable sentencing\nrange, the district court could apply an\nupward departure if it found that Jones\u2019\nbehavior was outside of the \"heartland\"\nof conduct embodied by Guideline sec.\n2J1.5. See Simmons, 215 F.3d at 742. In\nother words, if Jones\u2019 behavior was more\negregious than the behavior normally\npunished under Guideline sec. 2J1.5, then\nthe district court was permitted to apply\nan upward departure. See id. Here, the\ndistrict court applied an upward\ndeparture because Jones\u2019 refusals to tes\ntify amounted to a breach of the\nAgreement. Further, the benefit of the\nAgreement had already been conferred to\n\fJones in the form of a downward departure\napplied to his drug sentence.\n\n  We addressed the application of an\nupward departure based on this exact type\nof behavior in Simmons, 215 F.3d at 742-\n43. In that case, the defendant pleaded\nguilty to bank robbery pursuant to a plea\nagreement with the government, which\nrequired the defendant to testify at the\ntrial of Dwayne Reed. See id. at 739.\nAfter the defendant testified at Reed\u2019s\nfirst trial, which ended in a mistrial,\nthe government moved for the application\nof a downward departure for the\ndefendant\u2019s bank robbery sentence, and\nthe district court granted the motion.\nSee id. At Reed\u2019s second trial, however,\nthe defendant refused to testify, and the\ndistrict court found him guilty of\ncriminal contempt. See id. at 739-40. In\nsentencing the defendant for criminal\ncontempt, the district court applied an\nupward departure, justifying its decision\nby stating that the defendant had\nreceived a benefit from the plea\nagreement in the form of a reduced bank\nrobbery sentence. See id. at 740.\nFurther, because the defendant had\nbreached that plea agreement by refusing\nto testify at Reed\u2019s second trial, the\nupward departure would take away the\nbenefit conferred upon the defendant with\nrespect to his bank robbery sentence. See\nid. at 742-43. On appeal, this court\nupheld the application of the upward\ndeparture on these grounds because the\ndefendant\u2019s \"outright refusal to testify,\ncoupled with his change of heart as to\nhis decision to testify, served to\ndistinguish [defendant\u2019s] behavior from\nother behavior within the heartland of\nsec. 2J1.5.\" Id. at 742.\n\n  The facts in the present case are\nstrikingly similar, if not more\negregious. After his drug convictions,\nJones entered into an Agreement with the\ngovernment, under which he was obliged to\n\"provide complete and truthful testimony\nto any grand jury, trial jury, judge, or\nmagistrate in any proceeding in which he\nmay be called to testify by the\ngovernment.\" (italicized emphasis added).\nJones testified in front of a grand jury\nthat was investigating Scott, and accord\ningly, the district court applied a\ndownward departure to Jones\u2019 drug\nsentence. Thereafter, Jones refused to\nprovide grand jury testimony three times\n\fand refused to testify at both of Scott\u2019s\ntrials. Because of these five refusals to\ntestify, Jones was convicted of criminal\ncontempt. The district court then applied\nan upward departure to Jones\u2019 criminal\ncontempt sentence, justifying its\ndecision by stating that it found Jones\u2019\n\"refusal to testify [to be] outside of\nthe heartland of conduct contemplated by\nthe Sentencing Commission. As in Simmons,\n[Jones] initially agreed to cooperate,\ntestified, received a benefit for his\ncooperation, and then, refused to\ntestify.\" Further, the district court\nstated that it wanted \"to strip [Jones]\nof the benefit of his sec. 5K1.1\nreduction in his [drug] sentence.\"\nTherefore, as in Simmons, 215 F.3d at\n743, we hold that the district court did\nnot abuse its discretion by applying an\nupward departure based on Jones\u2019 refusals\nto testify.\n\n  Jones\u2019 arguments to the contrary are\nunavailing. First, Jones\u2019 reliance on\nGuideline sec. 5K1.2, which states that a\n\"defendant\u2019s refusal to assist\nauthorities in the investigation of other\npersons may not be considered as an\naggravating sentencing factor,\" is\nmisguided. U.S.S.G. sec. 5K1.2. Jones has\ncited no authority that suggests that\nGuideline sec. 5K1.2 applies to a\nsituation where the defendant received a\nbenefit for agreeing to assist the\ngovernment and thereafter refused to\ncomply with that agreement. In fact,\nthere is precedent holding that this\nexact kind of behavior does warrant an\nupward departure. See Simmons, 215 F.3d\nat 742-43.\n\n  Next, Jones contends that because\n\"generalized dissatisfaction with the\nGuidelines . . . is not a reasonable\nbasis\" for applying an upward departure,\nhis sentence should be reversed. United\nStates v. Scott, 914 F.2d 959, 964 (7th\nCir. 1990) (citations omitted). This\nprinciple is not applicable to the case\nat hand because the district court\nspecifically stated that it was applying\nthe upward departure because \"[Jones]\ninitially agreed to cooperate, testified,\nreceived a benefit for his cooperation,\nand then, refused to testify.\" We reject\nthe contention that the district court\napplied the upward departure because of\nany dissatisfaction with the applicable\nGuideline.\n\f  Finally, Jones contends for the first\ntime in his reply brief that he did not\nbreach the terms of the Agreement. Jones\nbases this claim on the fact that on\nJanuary 7, 1999, when the government\nsought Jones\u2019 grand jury testimony, it\nstated that it was not \"calling [Jones]\nbefore the Grand Jury in any way\nconnected with [the Agreement].\" Jones\ndid not mention this argument in his\nopening brief and did not adequately\ndevelop it in his reply brief because he\ndiscussed no legal authority addressing\nhow the government\u2019s statement affected\nthe continuing validity of the Agreement.\nSee 330 West Hubbard Rest. Corp. v.\nUnited States, 203 F.3d 990, 997 (7th\nCir. 2000) (stating that argument\ninadequately developed when not bolstered\nby legal authority). Therefore, without\npassing judgment on the merits of this\ncontention, we hold that Jones has\nforfeited this argument on appeal. See,\ne.g., United States v. Guy, 174 F.3d 859,\n862 n.1 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\nC.   Reasonableness of Sentence\n\n  Jones also argues that even if it was\nreasonable for the district court to\napply an upward departure, the extent of\nthe departure in this case was\nunreasonable. Sentencing courts need not\nadhere to a mathematical approach in\ndetermining the extent of the departure,\nbut rather need only \"link the degree of\ndeparture to the structure of the\nGuidelines and justify the extent of the\ndeparture taken.\" Simmons, 215 F.3d at\n743 (quotation omitted). In Simmons, the\ndistrict court applied an 8-level upward\ndeparture to the defendant\u2019s criminal\ncontempt sentence, which took the\ndefendant up to an offense level of 23\nand resulted in a sentence of 57 months\nimprisonment. See id. We held that the\nextent of this departure was reasonable\nbecause it accounted for the 55 month\nbenefit that the defendant had received\nas a result of the downward departure\napplied to his bank robbery sentence. See\nid. at 743.\n\n  In the present case, the district court\napplied a 17-level upward departure to\nJones\u2019 criminal contempt sentence,\nresulting in an offense level of 24 and a\nsentence of 76 months imprisonment.\nJones\u2019 applicable range for the drug\n\fconvictions was 188 to 235 months\nimprisonment, and the district court\nstated that it would have sentenced Jones\nto 210 months imprisonment had no\ndownward departure been applied to Jones\u2019\ndrug sentence because it was its normal\npractice to sentence defendants to the\nmiddle of the applicable range. The\ndistrict court then added the 66 months\n(210 months minus 144 months) to the 10\nmonth sentence from the applicable range\nunder Guideline sec. 2J1.5. As Jones\nconcedes in his opening brief, \"the 66\nmonths [were] required to take back Mr.\nJones\u2019 5K1.1 departure.\" Therefore, the\nextent of the upward departure in this\ncase was reasonable \"because it took away\nthe benefit conferred upon\" Jones by the\ndownward departure applied to his drug\nsentence. Simmons, 215 F.3d at 743\n(quotation omitted).\n\n  On appeal, Jones proffers several\narguments urging us to overturn Simmons,\nwhich we decline to do. Jones also argues\nthat even under Simmons, the 17-level\ndeparture in this case was unreasonable\nbecause it increased Jones\u2019 offense level\nby over twice as many levels as the 8-\nlevel departure in Simmons, 215 F.3d at\n743, did. This argument is also\nunavailing. We found Simmons\u2019s upward\ndeparture, which resulted in his offense\nlevel being 23, to be reasonable. See id.\nIn this case, Jones\u2019 upward departure\nresulted in his offense level being 24.\nFurther, Jones\u2019 conduct was more\negregious than Simmons\u2019s because Jones\nrefused to testify five times, whereas\nSimmons only refused to testify once.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n  For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM\nJones\u2019 sentence.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 Guideline sec. 5K1.1 provides that, \"[u]pon\nmotion of the government stating that the defen-\ndant has provided substantial assistance in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of another person\nwho has committed an offense, the court may\ndepart from the guidelines.\"\n\n/2 Judge Mills presided over Jones\u2019 trial for the\ndrug convictions, entered Jones\u2019 drug sentence,\npresided over Scott\u2019s trials, and presided over\nJones\u2019 criminal contempt case and sentencing.\n\f/3 Guideline sec. 5K2.0 provides that \"the sentenc-\ning court may impose a sentence outside the range\nestablished by the applicable guidelines, if the\ncourt finds \u2019that there exists an aggravating or\nmitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a de-\ngree, not adequately taken into consideration by\nthe Sentencing Commission in formulating the\nguidelines that should result in a sentence\ndifferent from that described.\u2019\"\n\n/4 The district court calculated the 66 month bene-\nfit by subtracting the 144 month sentence actual-\nly imposed on Jones from 210 months--the middle\nof the applicable range of 188 to 235 months\nimprisonment.\n\f",
