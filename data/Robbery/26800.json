REECE\n\n\n\n\n             Original Mandamus Proceeding\n\n\n\n\n      Before Morriss, C.J., Burgess and Stevens, JJ.\n       Memorandum Opinion by Justice Burgess\n\f                        MEMORANDUM OPINION\n        Petitioner Reginald Reece has asked this Court to compel the trial court to grant relief in\n\nthe form of jail days served before Reece\u2019s conviction. Reece argues he is entitled to credit for\n\ntime served when he was incarcerated on a Cass County conviction, while a hold was in place for\n\na charge against him in Bowie County. 1 Because we find Reece has received the relief he seeks,\n\nwe dismiss his petition as moot.\n\n        The standard for mandamus relief articulated by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\n\nrequires the relator to establish that (1) there is no adequate remedy at law to redress the alleged\n\nharm and (2) only a ministerial act, not a discretionary or judicial decision, is being sought. State\n\nex. rel. Young v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Appeals at Texarkana, 236 S.W.3d 207, 210 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2007) (orig. proceeding). Due to the nature of this remedy, it is Reece\u2019s burden to\n\nproperly request and show entitlement to mandamus relief. Barnes v. State, 832 S.W.2d 424, 426\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, orig. proceeding) (per curiam) (\u201cEven a pro se applicant\n\nfor a writ of mandamus must show himself entitled to the extraordinary relief he seeks.\u201d).\n\n        In its Third Judgment Nunc Pro Tunc, the trial court credited Reece with 801 days of jail-\n\ntime credits. Reece then filed this petition for writ of mandamus asserting that he is entitled to\n\nanother year of jail-time credits. Subsequent to the filing of Reece\u2019s petition, the trial court entered\n\na Fourth Judgment Nunc Pro Tunc granting Reece credit for 1,170 days served toward his sentence\n\n\n\n1\n Reece was ultimately convicted in Bowie County for theft with prior convictions. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN.\n\u00a7 31.03(E)(4)(d). He pled true to sentencing enhancement allegations and was sentenced to twenty years\u2019\nconfinement. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 12.425(b). This Court affirmed his conviction and sentence. See Reece\nv. State, 474 S.W.3d 483 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2015, no pet.).\n                                                     2\n\fof twenty years. The trial court\u2019s Fourth Judgment Nunc Pro Tunc reflects an increase of 369 days\n\njail-time credits over the amount previously granted in its Third Judgment Nunc Pro Tunc.\n\nAccordingly, the trial court granted Reece the relief he requests in his petition.\n\n       Reece having obtained the relief sought before this Court, we deny the petition as moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                               Ralph K.
