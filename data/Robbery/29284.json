He claims that the sentence does not recite that he waived such right and because of such omission the case should be reversed and remanded.\nWe find no provision of the law which requires that the sentence recite that the appellant waived his right to file a motion for a new trial. Nor do we find an affirmative showing in the record that the appellant failed to waive such right.\nThe indictment and all matters of procedure appear to be regular.\nThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\nOpinion approved by the Court.\n",
