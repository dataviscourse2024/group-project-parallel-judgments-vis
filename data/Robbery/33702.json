However, during the plea proceedings, the court, without any ambiguity, informed the defendant that the minimum sentence it would impose would be 2 to 6 years imprisonment and the maximum sentence would be 5 to 15 years imprisonment. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s contention is without merit. Mangano, P. J., Sullivan, O\u2019Brien, Ritter and Pizzuto, JJ., concur.\n",
