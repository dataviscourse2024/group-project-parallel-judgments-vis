Effectiveness of Counsel. A claim that defense counsel provided inef-\n                    fective assistance presents a mixed question of law and fact.\n                 2. Effectiveness of Counsel: Appeal and Error. When reviewing a\n                    claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an appellate court reviews\n                    the factual findings of the lower court for clear error. With regard to\n                    questions of counsel\u2019s performance or prejudice to the defendant as\n                    part of the two-pronged test articulated in Strickland v.

Ed. 2d 674 (1984), an appellate court\n                    reviews such legal determinations independently of the lower court\u2019s\n                    conclusion.\n                 3. Postconviction: Evidence: Appeal and Error. In an evidentiary hear-\n                    ing on a motion for postconviction relief, the trial judge, as the trier\n                    of fact, resolves conflicts in the evidence and questions of fact. An\n                    appellate court upholds the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are\n                    clearly erroneous.\n                 4. Postconviction: Effectiveness of Counsel: Proof: Appeal and Error.\n                    In order to establish a right to postconviction relief based on a claim\n                    of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant has the burden, in\n                    accord\u00adance with Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct.\n                    2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), to show that counsel\u2019s performance was\n                    deficient; that is, counsel\u2019s performance did not equal that of a lawyer\n                    with ordinary training and skill in criminal law. Next, the defendant\n                    must show that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense\n                    in his or her case.\n                 5.

Trial: Attorney and Client: Testimony. Defense counsel bears the pri-\n    mary responsibility for advising a defendant of his or her right to testify\n    or not to testify, of the strategic implications of each choice, and that the\n    choice is ultimately for the defendant to make.\n 8.

Peterson, Attorney General, and Stacy M. Foust\nfor appellee.\n\n  Heavican, C.J., Miller-Lerman, Cassel, Stacy, Funke,\nand Papik, JJ.\n\n   Papik, J.\n   Nicholas J. Ely appeals from an order denying him post-\nconviction relief. The district court determined, after hold-\ning an evidentiary hearing, that there was no merit to Ely\u2019s\nclaims that his counsel was ineffective at the trial court level\nin failing to advise him of his right to testify and ineffec-\ntive on direct appeal in failing to argue that his right to self-\nrepresentation was violated at trial. We find no reversible error\nand thus affirm.\n\n                       BACKGROUND\nTrial and Direct Appeal.\n   Ely was tried for his role in an attempted robbery in which\nthe target was killed. The details that led to the charges and\ntrial can be found in our opinion on Ely\u2019s direct appeal. See\nState v. Ely, 287 Neb. 147, 841 N.W.2d 216 (2014).\n\f                               - 463 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   306 Nebraska Reports\n                            STATE v. ELY\n                         Cite as 306 Neb. 461\n\n   Ely\u2019s trial was scheduled to commence on October 1, 2012.\nOn August 21, Ely filed a motion styled as \u201cMotion to Dismiss\nCurrent Counsel and Appoint Myself Pro Se.\u201d In it, he asserted\nthat the \u201cissues involved in this case are complex and beyond\nthe scope of [his] legal knowledge.\u201d He then listed various\ncomplaints regarding his attorneys and the amount of time he\nhad been able to review discovery produced in his case. He\nasked the court to \u201cappoint\u201d him as his own counsel, but also\nasked that he \u201chave counsel appointed to me for help/advisory\nfor when I have questions [about] my own counsel.\u201d On the\nsame day, Ely filed a motion to continue the trial. In the motion\nto continue, he referred to his motion to dismiss his counsel\nand represent himself, and he claimed that he needed more\ntime to prepare for trial.\n   On August 28, 2012, the district court held a hearing on\nEly\u2019s motions. When asked about his motion to dismiss his\ncounsel and represent himself, Ely said that he did not feel he\nhad had enough time to prepare for trial and that he believed\nif he represented himself, he would be able to work on the\ncase more. Ely indicated that he wished to spend more time\nreviewing discovery in his case, but that he did not believe\nthere was enough time remaining prior to trial for him to do\nso. \u201cSo,\u201d as he put it, \u201cI feel like I need to go pro se and to get\na continuance.\u201d\n   After Ely\u2019s counsel responded, the district court said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t see any benefit to you proceeding pro se . . . . [T]hese\nare serious charges. And I still think you need the advice of\ncounsel. So I\u2019m going to deny your motion.\u201d\n   The district court then heard argument on Ely\u2019s motion to\ncontinue. In support of this motion, Ely again referred to his\nmotion to dismiss his counsel. He said, \u201cI feel I\u2019m not ready\nto go to trial in 30 days. That\u2019s why I\u2019m in here putting in a\nmotion to dismiss my counsel.\u201d The district court denied the\nmotion to continue.\n   The week before trial was to commence, Ely filed another\nmotion, styled as \u201cMotion to Dismiss Counsel.\u201d In this motion,\n\f                              - 464 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                           STATE v. ELY\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 461\n\nhe asked the district court to dismiss his current counsel and\nreappoint new counsel. He listed numerous reasons why he\nwas not satisfied with his current counsel, but made no men-\ntion of desiring to represent himself. On the same day, Ely filed\nanother motion to continue, in which he referred to his recently\nfiled motion to dismiss counsel and stated that his \u201cnew lawyer\nneeds time to go over [d]iscovery and put in motions.\u201d The\ndistrict court denied both motions.\n   Trial commenced as scheduled, with Ely represented by\ncounsel. Ely did not testify in his own defense.\n   Ely was convicted of first degree murder on a felony mur-\nder theory and use of a deadly weapon to commit a felony. He\nwas sentenced to life in prison on the murder conviction and\nto a consecutive sentence of 5 to 5 years\u2019 imprisonment on the\nuse of a deadly weapon conviction. We affirmed his convic-\ntions on direct appeal. State v. Ely, 287 Neb. 147, 841 N.W.2d\n216 (2014).\n\nInitial Postconviction Appeal.\n   After his convictions were affirmed, Ely filed multiple\nmotions for postconviction relief in which he alleged numer-\nous claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate\ncounsel, as well as several claims of district court error. The\ndistrict court initially denied Ely\u2019s motions without holding an\nevidentiary hearing. Ely appealed, raising 29 different assign-\nments of error.\n   While we found that the district court correctly denied Ely\nrelief without an evidentiary hearing on most of the claims\nasserted, we found that he was entitled to an evidentiary hear-\ning on two of his claims: (1) that his trial counsel was ineffec-\ntive in failing to advise him of his right to testify and (2) that\nhis appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to argue that his\nright to self-representation was violated at trial. Accordingly,\nwe reversed, and remanded, in part, with directions to the\ndistrict court to hold an evidentiary hearing on those claims.\nWe also directed the district court to grant Ely\u2019s motion for\n\f                              - 465 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                           STATE v. ELY\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 461\n\nappointment of counsel. See State v. Ely, 295 Neb. 607, 889\nN.W.2d 377 (2017).\n\nPostconviction Proceedings\non Remand.\n   The district court held an evidentiary hearing following\nremand. At the evidentiary hearing, the district court received\ndepositions of both Ely and an attorney who served as Ely\u2019s\ncounsel at trial and on appeal. After the evidentiary hearing,\nEly successfully moved to reopen the record to introduce a\nmotion he filed asking to dismiss his appellate counsel and\nappoint new counsel. Additional details regarding the evidence\nintroduced at the evidentiary hearing are discussed in the\nanalysis section below.\n   Following the evidentiary hearing, the district court found\nEly was not entitled to relief on either of his two remain-\ning claims. With respect to Ely\u2019s claim that his counsel was\nineffective in failing to advise him of his right to testify, the\ndistrict court found that Ely understood he had a right to tes-\ntify, that his counsel advised him not to do so, and that this\nadvice was reasonable. The district court also found that Ely\u2019s\ncounsel did not render ineffective assistance by not arguing\non appeal that Ely\u2019s right to self-representation was violated\nat trial. The district court reasoned that if that issue had been\nraised on direct appeal, it would not have been successful,\nand that therefore, counsel was not ineffective in failing to\nraise it.\n   Ely appeals.\n\n                  ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Ely assigns two errors on appeal. He claims that the district\ncourt erred (1) in denying relief on his claim that trial counsel\nwas ineffective in failing to advise him of his right to testify\nand (2) in denying relief on his claim that his appellate counsel\nwas ineffective in failing to assert on appeal that his right to\nself-representation was violated at trial.\n\f                                - 466 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   306 Nebraska Reports\n                             STATE v. ELY\n                          Cite as 306 Neb. 461\n\n                     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1,2] A claim that defense counsel provided ineffective\nassistance presents a mixed question of law and fact. State v.\nHuston, 302 Neb. 202, 922 N.W.2d 723 (2019). When review-\ning a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an appellate\ncourt reviews the factual findings of the lower court for clear\nerror. Id. With regard to questions of counsel\u2019s performance\nor prejudice to the defendant as part of the two-pronged test\narticulated in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.\nCt. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), an appellate court reviews\nsuch legal determinations independently of the lower court\u2019s\nconclusion. Huston, supra.\n   [3] In an evidentiary hearing on a motion for postconvic-\ntion relief, the trial judge, as the trier of fact, resolves conflicts\nin the evidence and questions of fact. Id. An appellate court\nupholds the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly\nerroneous. Id.\n\n                          ANALYSIS\nIneffective Assistance of\nCounsel Standards.\n   Both of Ely\u2019s assignments of error pertain to alleged inef-\nfective assistance of counsel. We briefly review the legal\nstandards governing such claims before turning to Ely\u2019s spe-\ncific arguments.\n   [4,5] In order to establish a right to postconviction relief\nbased on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the\ndefendant has the burden, in accordance with Strickland,\nsupra, to show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; that\nis, counsel\u2019s performance did not equal that of a lawyer with\nordinary training and skill in criminal law. State v. Privett,\n303 Neb. 404, 929 N.W.2d 505 (2019). Next, the defendant\nmust show that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the\ndefense in his or her case. Id. To show prejudice, the defend\u00ad\nant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that but for\ncounsel\u2019s deficient performance, the result of the proceeding\n\f                               - 467 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   306 Nebraska Reports\n                            STATE v. ELY\n                         Cite as 306 Neb. 461\n\nwould have been different. State v. Assad, 304 Neb. 979, 938\nN.W.2d 297 (2020).\n\nRight to Testify.\n   [6,7] We now turn to Ely\u2019s argument that the district court\nerred by rejecting Ely\u2019s claim that his trial counsel ineffectively\nfailed to advise him of his right to testify. Here, Ely correctly\npoints out that a defendant has a fundamental constitutional\nright to testify. See State v. Iromuanya, 282 Neb. 798, 806\nN.W.2d 404 (2011). Further, he correctly observes that we have\npreviously stated defense counsel bears the primary responsi-\nbility for advising a defendant of his or her right to testify or\nnot to testify, of the strategic implications of each choice, and\nthat the choice is ultimately for the defendant to make. Id. In\nthis case, however, we do not believe the district court erred by\nconcluding that Ely\u2019s trial counsel met this responsibility and\nthus did not perform deficiently.\n   Although Ely testified in his deposition that he was not\nadvised and did not know he had a right to testify, his counsel\ntestified that this was \u201cabsolutely incorrect\u201d and was a \u201cbogus\nstatement.\u201d She testified that when she met with Ely after he\ndecided he wanted to go to trial, \u201cone of the first things [he]\nsaid to me was, I can\u2019t take the stand because I have seven or\neight felonies.\u201d She testified that she then would have had a\nconversation with Ely on the risks of testifying as a convicted\nfelon. She additionally testified that Ely was the only person\nwho made the decision not to testify and that no one talked\nhim out of it.\n   The district court resolved the conflicts between Ely\u2019s tes-\ntimony and that of his counsel and determined that Ely was\naware of his right to testify, that his counsel provided advice\nregarding his testifying, and that Ely made the decision not\nto do so. The task of resolving such conflicting testimony is\nwithin the province of the district court. See State v. Alarcon-\nChavez, 295 Neb. 1014, 893 N.W.2d 706 (2017). We can dis-\nturb its factual findings only if they are clearly erroneous. See\n\f                              - 468 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                           STATE v. ELY\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 461\n\nid. We find no clear error here and thus see no basis to disturb\nthe district court\u2019s conclusion that Ely\u2019s counsel did not inef-\nfectively fail to advise him of his right to testify.\n\nSelf-Representation.\n   This leaves Ely\u2019s argument that he received ineffective\nassistance of counsel because his counsel failed to argue on\ndirect appeal that his rights to self-representation were violated\nat trial. Ely claims that if his counsel had raised this issue on\nappeal, reversal would have been required. He contends that\nunder the U.S. and Nebraska Constitutions, he had a right to\nrepresent himself and the district court could not preclude him\nfrom doing so based on the fact he faced serious charges or\nbased on its belief that it was in his best interests to be repre-\nsented by counsel. He also emphasizes that the denial of the\nright to self-representation has been held to be structural error,\nnot subject to harmless error review. And, according to Ely, if\nraising this issue would have resulted in his obtaining a new\ntrial, his counsel was deficient for not raising it.\n   [8] Much of what Ely contends regarding the right to self-\nrepresentation is true. He is correct that a criminal defendant\nhas a constitutional right to waive the assistance of counsel and\nconduct his or her own defense under the Sixth Amendment\nand Neb. Const. art. I, \u00a7 11. State v. Ely, 295 Neb. 607, 889\nN.W.2d 377 (2017). He also rightly points out that while the\nwaiver must be made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently,\nit need not be prudent. See id. And we have recognized that\nthe denial of the right to self-representation is not subject to\nharmless error review. See id. Ely says nothing, however, about\nanother crucial aspect of the right to self-representation\u2014the\nrequirement that any assertion of the right be made clearly\nand unequivocally.\n   In Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S. Ct.\n2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975), the case in which the U.S.\nSupreme Court recognized a defendant\u2019s constitutional right\nto self-representation at trial, it noted that the trial court had\n\f                              - 469 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                           STATE v. ELY\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 461\n\nforced the defendant in that case to accept representation\nfrom his appointed attorney after the defendant \u201cclearly and\nunequivocally\u201d communicated his desire to represent himself.\nCourts have thereafter uniformly held that the right to self-\nrepresentation is triggered only when the defendant clearly and\nunequivocally requests self-representation. See, e.g., Williams\nv. Bartlett, 44 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 1994), quoting Faretta,\nsupra (\u201c[t]he right to self-representation does not attach until\nit is asserted \u2018clearly and unequivocally\u2019\u201d). See, also, 3 Wayne\nR. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure \u00a7 11.5(d) (4th ed. 2015)\n(collecting cases).\n    The requirement that a request for self-representation be\nclear and unequivocal has been recognized to serve multiple\npurposes. In one sense, it protects criminal defendants and their\nright to counsel. As one court put it, the requirement\n       acts as a backstop for the defendant\u2019s right to counsel,\n       by ensuring that the defendant does not inadvertently\n       waive that right through occasional musings on the ben-\n       efits of self-representation. . . . Because a defendant\n       normally gives up more than he gains when he elects\n       self-representation, we must be reasonably certain that he\n       in fact wishes to represent himself.\nAdams v. Carroll, 875 F.2d 1441, 1444 (9th Cir. 1989) (cita-\ntion omitted).\n    Not only does the clear and unequivocal requirement benefit\ncriminal defendants, it also protects the criminal justice system\nas a whole. The need for this protection arises out of the fact\nthat the right to counsel and the right to self-representation\nare \u201cmutually exclusive entitlements.\u201d Cain v. Peters, 972\nF.2d 748, 750 (7th Cir. 1992). See, also, U.S. v.

ELY\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 461\n\nand thereby manufacture an argument for appellate reversal\nno matter how the trial court rules. See, e.g., Simpson, 845\nF.3d at 1047 (\u201c[w]ithout a clear and unequivocal request, the\n[trial] court would face a dilemma, for an equivocal demand\ncreates a potential ground for reversal however the trial court\nrules\u201d); Cross v. U.S., 893 F.2d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir. 1990)\n(\u201c[i]n recognition of . . . the knowledge that shrewd litigants\ncan exploit this difficult constitutional area by making ambigu-\nous self-representation claims to inject error into the record,\nthis Court has required an individual to clearly and unequivo-\ncally assert the desire to represent himself\u201d). The clear and\nunequivocal requirement \u201cresolves this dilemma by forcing\nthe defendant to make an explicit choice.\u201d Adams, 875 F.2d\nat 1444. If no such choice is made, the defendant is presumed\nto have invoked the right to counsel and not the right to self-\nrepresentation. Id.\n   We discuss the clear and unequivocal requirement at length\nhere because we do not believe Ely clearly and unequivocally\nasserted that he wished to represent himself. To be sure, Ely\u2019s\nmotion filed August 21, 2012, included a statement that he\nwished to represent himself, a statement he repeated at the\nhearing on that motion. Viewed in context, however, we do\nnot believe these statements constitute an unequivocal asser-\ntion that Ely wished to waive his right to counsel and represent\nhimself at trial. We believe this is the case for multiple reasons\nwe will explain below.\n   First, we believe Ely\u2019s request to represent himself could\nreasonably be understood as expressing a desire to represent\nhimself only if the court also continued his trial. Several facts\nlead us to this conclusion. Ely filed the motion in which he\nasked to represent himself on the same day he filed a motion\nto continue the trial date. The motion to continue referred to\nthe motion asking for self-representation as a reason for a con-\ntinuance. Further, at the hearing on the motions, the primary\nreason Ely identified for wanting to represent himself was\nhis desire to have more time to work on his case. Because of\n\f                               - 471 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   306 Nebraska Reports\n                            STATE v. ELY\n                         Cite as 306 Neb. 461\n\nhis belief that he did not have enough time before trial, Ely\nsaid he felt he \u201cneed[ed] to go pro se and to get a continu-\nance.\u201d Later in the hearing, Ely reiterated that he was seeking\nto dismiss his counsel because he felt he was not ready to go\nto trial as scheduled. Finally, Ely did not request to represent\nhimself again after the district court denied the motion for a\ncontinuance of the October 1, 2012, trial date. Given the fore-\ngoing, we believe it is, at the very least, reasonable to under-\nstand Ely\u2019s request as a request to represent himself only if\nthe trial date was also continued and thus not an unequivocal\nassertion of his right to self-representation.\n   We find support for our determination that Ely did not\nclearly and unequivocally assert the right to self-representation\nin several federal court decisions. Because its facts are so\nsimilar to this case, we believe U.S. v. Simpson, 845 F.3d\n1039 (10th Cir. 2017), bears mention first. In that case, the\ndefendant made two motions on the same day, one to represent\nhimself and the other for a continuance of the trial. As the 10th\nCircuit described the motions, \u201c[r]ead together, [they] stated\nthat [the defendant] wanted to obtain more time for trial and\nto represent himself at the eventual trial.\u201d Id. at 1047. The trial\ncourt denied both motions, and the defendant appealed. The\n10th Circuit explained that the defendant\u2019s motions could be\nunderstood as requesting self-representation even if the motion\nfor continuance was denied, but that they could also be under-\nstood as a request for self-representation only if the defendant\nobtained additional time. Because the defendant never made\nclear that he wished to represent himself even if the continu-\nance was denied (and it was), the court held that the defendant\nhad not clearly and unequivocally asserted a right to self-\nrepresentation. Like the defendant in Simpson, Ely asked to\nrepresent himself, but made the request in conjunction with an\nunsuccessful request for continuance of trial and did not make\nclear that he wished to represent himself if he did not obtain\na continuance.\n\f                              - 472 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                           STATE v. ELY\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 461\n\n   Other recent federal decisions have found a defendant did\nnot clearly and unequivocally request self-representation for\nreasons similar to those identified in Simpson. In U.S. v. Vanga,\n717 Fed. Appx. 726 (9th Cir. 2018), the U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit held that conditions a defendant placed\non his self-representation request, including obtaining a con-\ntinuance, rendered his request equivocal. In U.S. v. Edwards,\n535 Fed. Appx. 285 (4th Cir. 2013), the U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Fourth Circuit held that a defendant did not clearly\nand unequivocally assert the right to self-representation. In\nEdwards, the defendant informed the court that he was \u201c\u2018reluc-\ntantly\u2019\u201d asking the court to represent himself and that he \u201c\u2018just\nfe[lt] like [he had] to represent [him]self,\u2019\u201d 535 Fed. Appx. at\n287 (emphasis omitted), expressions that are similar to Ely\u2019s\nstatement that in light of his belief that he needed more time\nto prepare for trial, \u201cI feel like I need to go pro se and to get\na continuance.\u201d\n   Alternatively, we believe Ely did not clearly and unequivo-\ncally assert that he wished to represent himself for another\nreason: It is not clear that Ely wished to represent himself even\nif the district court did not appoint counsel to assist him in\nsome fashion.\n   The Sixth Amendment has been interpreted to confer a right\nto counsel and a right to self-representation, but there is no\nconstitutional right to \u201chybrid\u201d representation, in which the\ndefendant both acts as his or her own counsel and is repre-\nsented by an attorney. See McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168,\n104 S. Ct. 944, 79 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1984); U.S. v. Callwood,\n66 F.3d 1110 (10th Cir. 1995). While a court has discretion to\nappoint standby counsel to assist a defendant, there is no con-\nstitutional right to such an arrangement. See U.S. v. Webster, 84\nF.3d 1056 (8th Cir. 1996).\n   Because there is no constitutional right to hybrid represen-\ntation, some courts have held that defendants do not clearly\nand unequivocally assert the right to self-representation when\nrequests to serve as their own counsel are accompanied by\n\f                              - 473 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  306 Nebraska Reports\n                           STATE v. ELY\n                        Cite as 306 Neb. 461\n\na request to have appointed counsel serve in an advisory or\nstandby capacity. In U.S. v. Kienenberger, 13 F.3d 1354 (9th\nCir. 1994), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\nheld that a defendant did not clearly and unequivocally assert a\nright to self-representation, because when he asked to serve as\nhis own counsel, he also asked that advisory or standby coun-\nsel be appointed to assist on procedural matters. New York\u2019s\nhighest appellate court recently reached the same conclusion. It\nreasoned that because the defendant had consistently requested\nstandby counsel\u2014to which he had no constitutional right\u2014\nhe had not unequivocally asked to proceed without counsel.\nPeople v. Silburn, 31 N.Y.3d 144, 98 N.E.3d 696, 74 N.Y.S.3d\n781 (2018).\n   In contrast to Kienenberger and Silburn, some courts have\nheld that it is possible for a defendant to request standby\ncounsel and nevertheless unequivocally assert the right to self-\nrepresentation. See, e.g., U.S. v. Baker, 84 F.3d 1263 (10th\nCir. 1996); People v. Hicks, 259 Mich. App. 518, 675 N.W.2d\n599 (2003). But even assuming that is a possibility, we do not\nbelieve Ely did so here.\n   As we have noted, Ely\u2019s motion requesting that he be\nallowed to represent himself also requested that counsel\nbe appointed to assist him when he had questions. On its face\nthen, Ely\u2019s motion sought some type of hybrid arrangement\nin which he served as his own counsel but appointed counsel\nremained to assist him. Ely did not make clear either in his\nmotion or at the hearing that even if his request for such a\nhybrid arrangement was denied, he still wanted to waive his\nright to counsel and represent himself.\n   Furthermore, in Ely\u2019s motion, he admitted that the issues\nin his case were complex and beyond the scope of his\nlegal knowledge. We recognize that the absence of techni-\ncal legal knowledge is not, in itself, a valid reason to deny\na properly asserted request for self-representation. See, e.g.,\nJones v. Norman, 633 F.3d 661 (8th Cir. 2011) (holding that\nit was improper to deny defendant\u2019s request to represent\n\f                               - 474 -\n          Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                   306 Nebraska Reports\n                            STATE v. ELY\n                         Cite as 306 Neb. 461\n\nhimself on grounds that defendant was not familiar with rules\nof criminal procedure). Here, however, we believe Ely\u2019s rec-\nognition that he lacked the legal knowledge to effectively rep-\nresent himself casts considerable doubt on any notion that he\nactually wanted to represent himself in the absence of counsel\nto advise him. Where there is doubt as to whether a defendant\nactually desired to waive his right to counsel and invoke his\nor her right to self-representation, the request cannot be fairly\ndescribed as clear and unequivocal.\n   Because Ely did not clearly and unequivocally assert his\nright to self-representation, we agree with the district court that\nany argument on appeal that his right to self-representation\nwas violated stood no chance of success. Because Ely can-\nnot demonstrate the requisite prejudice, his claim that his\ncounsel should have argued on appeal that his right to self-\nrepresentation was violated at trial was properly rejected.\n\n                        CONCLUSION\n  Because we find that the district court did not err in denying\nEly postconviction relief, we affirm.\n                                                    Affirmed.\n  Freudenberg, J., not participating.\n\f",
