They claim that the accommodation substantially burdens their religious\n\nexercise in violation of RFRA by forcing them to take actions that cause their\n\nhealth plan administrators to provide contraceptive coverage and to maintain a\n\nhealth plan that serves as a conduit for contraceptive coverage. We reject the\n       1\n         We consider in this opinion the following district court orders: Eternal World Television\nNetwork, Inc. v. Burwell, 26 F. Supp. 3d 1228 (S.D. Ala. 2014); Roman Catholic Archdiocese of\nAtlanta v. Sebelius, No. 1:12-cv-03489-WSD, 2014 WL 2441742 (N.D. Ga. May 30, 2014); and\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta v. Sebelius, No. 1:12-cv-03489-WSD, 2014 WL\n1256373 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 26, 2014). The government filed separate appeals from the two orders\nin Roman Catholic Archdiocese, which were consolidated before this Court.\n\n\n                                                3\n\f             Case: 14-12696         Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 4 of 148\n\n\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims because we conclude that the regulations do not substantially\n\nburden their religious exercise and, alternatively, because (1) the government has\n\ncompelling interests to justify the accommodation, and (2) the accommodation is\n\nthe least restrictive means of furthering those interests.\n\n      Eternal Word Television Network (\u201cEWTN\u201d), the plaintiff in the first\n\nappeal, also raises several First Amendment challenges to the accommodation.\n\nBecause the accommodation is a neutral, generally applicable law that does not\n\ndiscriminate based on religious denomination, we reject EWTN\u2019s challenges under\n\nthe Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. We also reject EWTN\u2019s challenge\n\nunder the Free Speech Clause because, as discussed below, any speech restrictions\n\nthat may flow from the accommodation are justified by a compelling governmental\n\ninterest and are thus constitutional.\n\n                               I.       BACKGROUND\n\nA.    The Affordable Care Act and the Contraceptive Mandate\n\n      Enacted in 2010, the ACA requires group health insurance plans to provide a\n\nminimum floor of coverage without imposing cost sharing (such as deductibles,\n\nco-payments, or co-insurance) on plan participants and beneficiaries. 42 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 300gg-13(a). If an employer fails to provide such coverage in its group\n\nemployee health plan, it is subject to penalties in the form of a tax of $100 per day\n\nper affected person. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980D(b)(1). The Women\u2019s Health Amendment\n\n\n                                              4\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 5 of 148\n\n\nto the ACA added to the minimum coverage requirements a mandate that group\n\nhealth plans provide women with coverage for preventive care and screenings.\n\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). The requirement was intended in part to \u201cget[] rid of,\n\nor minimiz[e], high copays and high deductibles that are often overwhelming\n\nhurdles for women to access screening programs.\u201d 155 Cong. Rec. S11987 (Nov.\n\n30, 2009) (statement of Sen. Mikulski). The ACA tasked the Health Resources\n\nand Services Administration (\u201cHRSA\u201d), an agency of the Department of Health\n\nand Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), with promulgating comprehensive guidelines\n\ndetermining which preventive services and screenings would be required.\n\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). HHS commissioned the Institute of Medicine\n\n(\u201cIOM\u201d) to assist with HRSA\u2019s development of the guidelines.\n\n      The IOM released a full report in 2011 detailing its study of various\n\npreventive services and its recommendations for coverage under the mandate. Inst.\n\nof Medicine, Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps (2011)\n\n(\u201cIOM Report\u201d). The IOM Report discussed at length the positive public health\n\noutcomes associated with reducing unintended pregnancies and giving women\n\nmore control over birth spacing. The United States has a much higher rate of\n\nunintended pregnancies\u201449 percent of pregnancies in 2001\u2014than other\n\ndeveloped countries. Id. at 102. Unintended pregnancies correlate with health\n\nproblems both for women who experience such pregnancies and for children born\n\n\n                                         5\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 6 of 148\n\n\nas a result of them. Id. at 103. And because women may not realize immediately\n\nthat they are pregnant, \u201ctheir entry into prenatal care may be delayed[;] they may\n\nnot be motivated to discontinue behaviors that present risks for the developing\n\nfetus; and they may experience depression, anxiety, or other conditions.\u201d Id.\n\nUnintended pregnancies also frequently end in abortion. Id. at 102. 2\n\n       The IOM Report also noted the health consequences of pregnancies\n\noccurring too closely together in time. For infants, \u201c[s]hort interpregnancy\n\nintervals in particular have been associated with low birth weight, prematurity, and\n\nsmall for gestational age births.\u201d Id. at 103. For women, both pregnancy spacing\n\nand the ability to avoid pregnancy may significantly affect their health because,\n\namong other reasons, some \u201cwomen with certain chronic medical conditions (e.g.,\n\ndiabetes and obesity) may need to postpone pregnancy until appropriate weight\n\nloss or glycemic control has been achieved.\u201d Id. Pregnancy is also contraindicated\n\nfor some women with serious medical conditions, for example, pulmonary\n\nhypertension or Marfan syndrome. 3 Id. at 103-04. The IOM Report also found\n\n\n       2\n         A 2013 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 18\npercent of all pregnancies in the United States ended in abortion and noted that \u201cunintended\npregnancy precedes nearly all abortions.\u201d Karen Pazol, et al., Centers for Disease Control &\nPrevention, Abortion Surveillance\u2014United States, 2010 (Nov. 29, 2013),\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6208a1.htm. The IOM Report noted that in\n2001, 42 percent of unintended pregnancies in the United States were terminated by abortion.\nIOM Report at 102.\n       3\n        Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body\u2019s connective tissue.\nPregnancy can be difficult for women with the condition because of the additional strain\n\n\n                                               6\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 7 of 148\n\n\nthat \u201cgreater use of contraception within the population produces lower unintended\n\npregnancy and abortion rates nationally.\u201d Id. at 105.\n\n       Pursuant to its statutory authority, HRSA released binding guidelines, based\n\non the IOM Report, that require coverage for \u201c[a]ll Food and Drug Administration\n\napproved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education\n\nand counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.\u201d U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &\n\nHuman Servs., Health Res. & Servs. Admin., Women\u2019s Preventive Services\n\nGuidelines (\u201cHRSA guidelines\u201d), http://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines (last\n\nvisited Feb. 12, 2016); see also 77 Fed. Reg. 8725, 8725-26 (Feb. 15, 2012)\n\n(quoting the language in the HRSA guidelines regarding coverage). Implementing\n\nregulations developed by the Department of Labor, the Department of the\n\nTreasury, and HHS (collectively, the \u201cDepartments\u201d) reiterate the contraceptive\n\nmandate\u2019s requirement that health plans cover all services listed in the HRSA\n\nguidelines. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv) (Treasury Regulation); 29 C.F.R\n\n\u00a7 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv) (Labor Regulation); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv)\n\n(HHS Regulation). 4\n\n\npregnancy places on the cardiovascular system. Nat\u2019l Heart, Lung, & Blood Inst., What is\nMarfan Syndrome? (Oct. 1, 2010), http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/mar/.\n       4\n          The Departments have jointly developed regulations carrying out the ACA. To be\nconcise, whenever possible we cite only to the regulations issued by HHS, codified at 45 C.F.R.\npt. 147, and not to the corresponding identical regulations issued by the Departments of Labor\nand the Treasury.\n\n\n                                               7\n\f             Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 8 of 148\n\n\n      Mindful of religious freedom and the importance of respect for \u201cthe unique\n\nrelationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial\n\npositions,\u201d the Departments promulgated interim regulations that gave HRSA\n\ndiscretion to exempt from the contraceptive mandate certain group health plans\n\nestablished or maintained by religious employers. See 76 Fed. Reg. 46621, 46623\n\n(Aug. 3, 2011). The Departments defined \u201creligious employer\u201d by incorporating\n\nthe Internal Revenue Service\u2019s definition of a church or integrated auxiliary from\n\n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) and (iii). 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B) (2011).\n\nThe definition also required a religious employer to have a religious purpose and to\n\nboth serve and employ primarily persons who share the religious tenets of the\n\norganization. Id. Exercising the discretion the regulations provided, HRSA\n\namended its guidelines to exempt religious employers from the contraceptive\n\nmandate. The guidelines, issued on August 1, 2011, required compliance\n\nbeginning on August 1, 2012. See id. \u00a7 147.130(b)(1).\n\n      The Departments finalized the implementing regulations in February 2012.\n\nSee 77 Fed. Reg. 8725. At the same time, the Departments established a temporary\n\nsafe harbor from the contraceptive mandate for nonprofit organizations with\n\nreligious objections to providing contraceptive coverage. See Dep\u2019t of Health &\n\nHuman Servs., Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain\n\nEmployers, Health Plans & Group Health Insurance Issuers with Respect to the\n\n\n                                         8\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 9 of 148\n\n\nRequirement to Cover Contraceptive Services Without Cost Sharing (Feb. 10,\n\n2012). The safe harbor remained in effect for the 2012 plan year, ending on\n\nAugust 1, 2013. See id. at 2.\n\n      The Departments intended to use the safe harbor period to \u201cexpeditiously\n\ndevelop and propose changes to the final regulations implementing\u201d the\n\ncontraceptive mandate. 77 Fed. Reg. 16501, 16503 (Mar. 21, 2012). The changes\n\nto the regulations needed to \u201cmeet two goals\u2014accommodating non-exempt, non-\n\nprofit religious organizations\u2019 religious objections to covering contraceptive\n\nservices and assuring that participants and beneficiaries covered under such\n\norganizations\u2019 plans receive contraceptive coverage without cost sharing.\u201d Id. In\n\nMarch 2012, the Departments began the rulemaking process and solicited\n\ncomments on potential regulations that could achieve these two goals. Id. at\n\n16501.\n\n      At the conclusion of the rulemaking process in July 2013, the Departments\n\npromulgated revised regulations that retained HRSA\u2019s authority to exempt\n\nreligious employers. See 78 Fed. Reg. 39870 (July 2, 2013). The same day,\n\nHRSA released revised guidelines that tracked the Departments\u2019 changes to the\n\nreligious employer exemption. The final regulations simplified the definition of a\n\n\u201creligious employer,\u201d making the term coextensive with the IRS\u2019s statutory\n\ndefinition and removing the additional qualifications regarding a religious\n\n\n                                          9\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 10 of 148\n\n\nemployer\u2019s mission, programs, and employees. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(a) (2013); see\n\nalso 78 Fed. Reg. at 39873-74. Religious employers remained categorically\n\nexempt from the contraceptive mandate out of \u201crespect [for] the religious interests\n\nof houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries.\u201d 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. The\n\nDepartments noted that the exemption did not undermine their goal of making\n\ncontraceptive coverage available because religious employers and their integrated\n\nauxiliaries \u201care more likely than other employers to employ people of the same\n\nfaith who share the same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than\n\nother people to use contraceptive services even if such services were covered under\n\ntheir plan.\u201d Id.\n\n      The revised regulations, which took effect on Aug. 1, 2013, added an\n\naccommodation for organizations that do not qualify as religious employers under\n\nthe exemption. See 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(b) (2013). So long as an organization is a\n\nnonprofit entity holding itself out as a religious organization and has a religious\n\nobjection to providing contraceptive coverage (we refer to such entities as \u201celigible\n\norganizations\u201d), it may opt out of the contraceptive mandate. Id. 5\n\n\n      5\n          Under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(b), an organization is eligible for the accommodation if:\n      (1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any\n      contraceptive items or services required to be covered under \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv)\n      on account of religious objections.\n      (2)     (i) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and\n      holds itself out as a religious organization; or\n\n\n                                                10\n\f                 Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 11 of 148\n\n\n        Eligible organizations can take advantage of the accommodation via one of\n\ntwo procedures. The first procedure requires the organization to complete\n\nEmployee Benefits Security Administration Form 700 (\u201cForm 700\u201d). See EBSA\n\nForm 700\u2013Certification (Aug. 2014),\n\nhttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/preventiveserviceseligibleorganizationcertificationform.doc.\n6\n    To complete the two-page form, the eligible organization must provide its name\n\nand the name, title, and contact information of the individual signing the form on\n\nbehalf of the organization. The person signing the form must certify that the\n\norganization \u201chas a religious objection to providing coverage for some or all of any\n\ncontraceptive services that would otherwise be required to be covered.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n\n                (ii) The organization is organized and operates as a closely held for-profit\n        entity, as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and the organization\u2019s\n        highest governing body (such as its board of directors, board of trustees, or\n        owners, if managed directly by its owners) has adopted a resolution or similar\n        action, under the organization\u2019s applicable rules of governance and consistent\n        with state law, establishing that it objects to covering some or all of the\n        contraceptive services on account of the owners\u2019 sincerely held religious beliefs.\n        (3) The organization must self-certify in the form and manner specified by the\n        Secretary of Labor or provide notice to the Secretary of Health and Human\n        Services as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The organization must\n        make such self-certification or notice available for examination upon request by\n        the first day of the first plan year to which the accommodation in paragraph (c) of\n        this section applies. The self-certification or notice must be executed by a person\n        authorized to make the certification or notice on behalf of the organization, and\n        must be maintained in a manner consistent with the record retention requirements\n        under section 107 of ERISA.\n        6\n            Form 700 is included as the appendix to this opinion.\n\n\n                                                  11\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 12 of 148\n\n\n       The form\u2019s recipient depends on the type of health plan the eligible\n\norganization maintains. Employers can provide health benefits either through an\n\ninsured health plan or a self-insured health plan. 7 See Cong. Budget Office, Key\n\nIssues in Analyzing Major Health Insurance Proposals 6 (2008). If the eligible\n\norganization has an insured plan, it gives Form 700 to the insurance company that\n\nprovides its health plan (\u201cplan provider\u201d); if the organization has a self-insured\n\nplan, it gives Form 700 to its third-party administrator (\u201cTPA\u201d). The plaintiffs in\n\nboth cases before us provide health benefits to their employees through self-\n\ninsured group health plans, and all employ TPAs to administer their plans.\n\n       Alternatively, an eligible organization may directly notify HHS of its\n\nreligious objection to complying with the contraceptive mandate. This more\n\nrecently developed method of taking advantage of the accommodation arose from\n\nthe United States Supreme Court\u2019s order granting a preliminary injunction in\n\nWheaton College v. Burwell, 134 S. Ct. 2806 (2014). After the regulations\n\nconcerning the exemption and accommodation procedures were finalized, the\n\nSupreme Court in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2759-60\n\n(2014), extended the accommodation for nonprofit religious organizations to\n       7\n          For insured health plans, the employer contracts with an insurance company that\nadministers the group plan and pays claims. For self-insured plans, the financial risk of\nproviding health insurance lies with the organization itself; the organization directly pays for the\nplan participants\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 claims. Usually, organizations with self-insured plans hire a\nthird party to handle administrative tasks, such as developing provider networks and processing\nclaims.\n\n\n                                                12\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 13 of 148\n\n\nclosely held for-profit corporations whose owners have religious objections to\n\ncomplying with the contraceptive mandate. Three days after the Hobby Lobby\n\ndecision was issued, the Supreme Court in Wheaton College granted a request for a\n\npreliminary injunction pending appellate review to a plaintiff challenging the\n\naccommodation itself under RFRA, the same challenge the plaintiffs mount here.\n\nWheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2807. The Supreme Court\u2019s order enjoined HHS from\n\nenforcing the accommodation procedure against the college, so long as the college\n\n\u201cinform[ed] the Secretary of Health and Human Services in writing that it is a non-\n\nprofit organization that holds itself out as religious and has religious objections to\n\nproviding coverage for contraceptive services.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court warned,\n\nhowever, that the injunction order \u201cshould not be construed as an expression of the\n\nCourt\u2019s views on the merits.\u201d Id. 8\n\n       In response to the order in Wheaton College, the Departments issued interim\n\nfinal regulations in August 2014 to allow an eligible organization to opt out by\n\nsending a letter to HHS, instead of giving Form 700 to its plan provider or TPA.\n\n79 Fed. Reg. 51092, 51094-95 (Aug. 27, 2014); see Ctr. for Medicare & Medicaid\n\nServs., Model Notice, https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations-and-\n\n\n\n       8\n         The Seventh Circuit recently resolved Wheaton College\u2019s appeal, affirming the district\ncourt\u2019s denial of the college\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction. Wheaton Coll. v. Burwell,\n791 F.3d 792 (7th Cir. 2015).\n\n\n                                               13\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 14 of 148\n\n\nGuidance/Downloads/Model-Notice-8-22-14.pdf (last visited Feb. 12, 2016). 9\n\nThere is no prescribed format for the letter, but it must include:\n\n       the name of the eligible organization and the basis on which it\n       qualifies for an accommodation; its objection based on its sincerely\n       held religious beliefs to coverage of some or all contraceptive\n       services, as applicable (including an identification of the subset of\n       contraceptive services to which coverage the eligible organization\n       objects, if applicable); the plan name and type . . . ; and the name and\n       contact information for any of the plan\u2019s third party administrators\n       and health insurance issuers.\n\n45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(c)(1)(ii).\n\n       The regulations became final, without substantial changes, in a set of new\n\nrules effective on September 14, 2015. 80 Fed. Reg. 41318 (July 14, 2015). Under\n\nthe current rules, if an eligible organization directly notifies HHS of its intent to\n\nopt out of the contraceptive mandate, the government then alerts the organization\u2019s\n\nhealth plan provider or TPA that the organization has opted out and describes the\n\nplan provider\u2019s or TPA\u2019s resulting obligations. See 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-\n\n2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B), (c)(1)(ii).\n\n       For insured plans, once an eligible organization avails itself of the\n\naccommodation, the plan provider must (1) \u201c[e]xpressly exclude contraceptive\n\n       9\n          The interim final regulations also removed a provision (known as the non-interference\nprovision) requiring that eligible organizations \u201c\u2018must not, directly or indirectly[,] seek to\ninterfere with a third party administrator\u2019s arrangements to provide or arrange for separate\npayments for contraceptive services,\u2019 and \u2018must not, directly or indirectly, seek to influence a\nthird party administrator\u2019s decision to make any such arrangements.\u2019\u201d 79 Fed. Reg. at 51095\n(quoting 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2713A(b)(1)(iii); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(iii)).\n\n\n                                               14\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 15 of 148\n\n\ncoverage from the group health insurance coverage\u201d and (2) \u201c[p]rovide separate\n\npayments for any contraceptive services required to be covered\u201d for the plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(c)(2)(i).\n\n       For self-insured plans, the regulations provide that when an eligible\n\norganization invokes the accommodation, its TPA is designated as the plan\n\nadministrator under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d),\n\n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(16), with respect to contraceptive services. Under the\n\nregulations, the TPA is designated as the plan administrator in one of two ways. If\n\nthe eligible organization provides a copy of Form 700 to its TPA, then the\n\nregulations treat the form \u201cas a designation of the [TPA] as the plan administrator\u201d\n\nfor ERISA purposes. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-16(b). If the eligible organization\n\ninstead notifies HHS of its intent to opt out, then the Department of Labor notifies\n\nthe TPA that it shall be the plan administrator with respect to contraceptive\n\nservices for ERISA purposes. Id.\n\n       Upon receiving notification, the TPA has the option of terminating its\n\ncontractual relationship with the eligible organization. 10 See 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-\n\n\n       10\n           If the TPA terminates the relationship, the organization must (1) contract with a new\nTPA to administer its self-insured plan, (2) convert to an insured plan by contracting with a plan\nprovider, or (3) administer the plan itself. If the eligible organization contracts with a new TPA,\nthen it remains subject to the mandate and must provide contraceptive coverage, seek an\naccommodation, or pay a penalty. Alternatively, the organization could restructure its plan and\ncontract with a plan provider that would assume the risk of providing health insurance (that is,\nchange from a self-insured to an insured plan). In this scenario, the organization would have to\n\n\n                                                15\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 16 of 148\n\n\n2713A(b)(2). If it remains as the TPA, then it must provide (or arrange for another\n\ninsurer to provide) contraceptive benefits to participants and beneficiaries of the\n\nself-insured plan. Id.; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-16(c). 11\n\n       Significantly, plan providers and TPAs \u201cmay not impose any cost-sharing\n\nrequirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), or impose any\n\npremium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the\n\neligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.\u201d\n\n26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2713A(c)(2)(i); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(c)(2)(ii). 12 Plan\n\nproviders \u201cmust segregate premium revenue collected from the eligible\n\norganization from the monies used to provide payments for contraceptive\n\ncomply with the mandate, seek an accommodation, or pay a penalty. Finally, the organization\ncould continue with its self-insured plan without a TPA, meaning the organization would assume\nresponsibility for administering claims. Although the Departments are unaware of the existence\nof a single self-insured plan without a TPA, they have created a safe harbor that excuses such a\nplan from complying with the contraceptive mandate so long as it annually notifies HHS that it\nhas no TPA and plan participants and beneficiaries that contraceptive coverage is not provided.\nThe Departments will provide this safe harbor while considering an additional accommodation.\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39880-81.\n       11\n          Self-insured plans run by houses of worship and certain organizations controlled by or\nassociated with a house of worship, known as \u201cchurch plans,\u201d are not subject to the provisions of\nERISA unless they elect otherwise. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 410(d), 414(e). The government lacks\nauthority to compel the TPA of a church plan not subject to ERISA to provide contraceptive\ncoverage. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003(b)(2). Nonetheless, the TPA for a church plan may voluntarily\nprovide contraceptive services; the government incentivizes these TPAs to provide the coverage\nby offering larger reimbursements. See 80 Fed. Reg. at 41323 n.22; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 156.50(d).\n       12\n          The government reimburses plan providers and TPAs for providing contraception\nbenefits. Plan providers receive a downward adjustment to the user fees they must pay to the\nfederal government to sell plans on the federally-facilitated health exchanges. The process for\nTPAs can be more complicated. If the TPA is not itself a participating insurer, then it must\ncontract for contraceptive coverage with a participating insurer, and the insurer then passes on\nthe reimbursement to the TPA. See 80 Fed. Reg. at 41328.\n\n\n                                                16\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 17 of 148\n\n\nservices.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(c)(2)(ii). A plan provider or TPA also must notify\n\nplan participants and beneficiaries (contemporaneously with the delivery of other\n\nplan materials, if possible) \u201cthat the eligible organization does not administer or\n\nfund contraceptive benefits,\u201d but that the plan provider or TPA instead \u201cprovides\n\nseparate payments for contraceptive services.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2713A(d);\n\n45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(d).\n\nB.    The Parties and Procedural History\n\n      This opinion addresses two cases: one brought by EWTN and one brought\n\nby two Catholic Dioceses and a group of related persons and entities. Below, we\n\nbriefly discuss the plaintiffs and the procedural history of each case in turn.\n\n      1.     Eternal Word Television Network\n\n      Plaintiff-appellant EWTN is a non-profit worldwide Catholic media network\n\nfounded in 1981 by Mother Mary Angelica, a Catholic nun. EWTN, based in\n\nIrondale, Alabama, has approximately 350 employees. The network consists of 11\n\ntelevision feeds and two radio stations that reach 230 million homes in 144\n\ncountries and territories. Its programming includes daily Mass, Catholic devotions,\n\ncoverage of Catholic Church events, documentaries, children\u2019s programs,\n\neducational series, and other television and radio shows that support EWTN\u2019s\n\nmission of \u201cserv[ing] the orthodox belief and teaching of the Church as proclaimed\n\nby the Supreme Pontiff and his predecessors.\u201d Compl. at 5, No. 1:13-cv-00521-\n\n\n                                          17\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 18 of 148\n\n\nCG-C, Doc. 1. EWTN has a self-insured group health plan to provide health\n\ninsurance benefits to its employees. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama serves as\n\nthe TPA for the plan.\n\n       EWTN, together with the State of Alabama, 13 filed a complaint challenging\n\nthe contraceptive mandate and accompanying regulations under RFRA, the First\n\nAmendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq. The complaint\n\nalleged that \u201cEWTN cannot facilitate access to health care insurance . . . that\n\ncovers artificial contraception, sterilization, or abortion, or related education and\n\ncounseling, without violating its deeply held religious beliefs.\u201d Compl. at 7, No.\n\n1:13-cv-00521-CG-C, Doc. 1. To EWTN, this means that its religious beliefs\n\nprevent it both from providing contraceptive coverage in its health plan and from\n\nusing the accommodation. As a result, EWTN alleged, the contraceptive mandate\n\n\u201cimposes government pressure and coercion on EWTN to change or violate its\n\nreligious beliefs\u201d because if it does not provide coverage or use the\n\naccommodation, it faces fines for non-compliance with the mandate. Id. at 27.\n\n       EWTN and Alabama moved for partial summary judgment on five of the 17\n\ncounts in the complaint, including: Count One, alleging a violation of RFRA\n\n\n       13\n        Alabama was a party throughout the district court proceedings, but the State did not\njoin EWTN in this appeal.\n\n\n                                              18\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 19 of 148\n\n\nbased on the regulations\u2019 burden on religious exercise; Count Two, alleging a\n\nviolation of the Free Exercise Clause based on the same burden; Count Three,\n\nalleging a violation of the Free Exercise Clause based on intentional discrimination\n\namong religious organizations; Count Five, alleging a violation of the\n\nEstablishment Clause based on the selective imposition of a burden on some\n\nreligious organizations; and Count Nine, alleging a violation of the Free Speech\n\nClause based on compelled speech. Alabama joined in EWTN\u2019s motion and\n\nadditionally moved for summary judgment on Count Seventeen, which sought a\n\ndeclaration that the contraceptive mandate does not preempt Alabama law.\n\n      The defendants-appellees\u2014the Departments and their Secretaries\u2014filed a\n\nmotion to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment on all\n\nof the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The district court denied EWTN\u2019s and Alabama\u2019s\n\nmotions for summary judgment and granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary\n\njudgment as to Counts One, Two, Five, and Nine. On a motion by the plaintiffs,\n\nthe district court entered a final judgment on those four counts pursuant to Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 54(b) and stayed litigation of the remaining claims\n\npending appeal.\n\n      EWTN timely appealed. On EWTN\u2019s motion, we issued an injunction\n\npending appeal, preventing the defendants from enforcing the mandate or the\n\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 20 of 148\n\n\naccommodation against EWTN.

Both the Archdiocese of Atlanta and the Diocese of\n\nSavannah (collectively with the Bishop and Archbishop, \u201cthe Dioceses\u201d) are\n\nassociations of Catholic parishes and organizations, including Catholic schools.\n\nCatholic Charities is a nonprofit organization that provides social services,\n\nincluding immigration counseling, mental health counseling, marriage counseling,\n\nand pregnancy support services. The second amended complaint added as a\n\nplaintiff Catholic Education of North Georgia (\u201cCENGI\u201d) and removed Christ the\n\nKing Catholic School. CENGI is a nonprofit organization that oversees five\n\nCatholic schools in the Atlanta area.\n\n      The Atlanta Archdiocese operates a self-insured health plan, which covers\n\nemployees of the Archdiocese, Catholic Charities, and CENGI.

The plaintiffs alleged that the regulations require them\n\n\u201cto provide, pay for, and/or facilitate insurance coverage for abortion-inducing\n\ndrugs, sterilization, and contraception, in violation of their religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nSecond Am.

They alleged that the\n\nregulations further burden religious exercise \u201cby driving a wedge between\n\nreligious organizations, like the Atlanta Archdiocese, and their equally religious\n\ncharitable arms, such as Plaintiffs Catholic Charities and CENGI.\u201d Id. Because\n\nthe charitable arms do not qualify as \u201creligious employers,\u201d the Dioceses alleged\n\n       14\n           The parties disagree over whether these health plans qualify as \u201cchurch plans\u201d for\npurposes of ERISA. We need not decide whether the plans at issue are church plans because\ntheir ERISA status does not impact our conclusion that the accommodation does not\nsubstantially burden religious exercise. If the plans are not church plans, then our analysis as to\nEWTN\u2019s self-insured plan applies, and the accommodation presents no burden on religious\nexercise. See infra Part III.A.2.b. If the plans are church plans, then the government lacks\nauthority to enforce the contraceptive mandate against the plaintiffs\u2019 TPAs, rendering the\nplaintiffs\u2019 assertion that their actions trigger such coverage even weaker. See, e.g., Little Sisters\nof the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell, 794 F.3d 1151, 1188 (10th Cir.) (\u201cThe lack of\nenforcement authority makes any burden on plaintiffs with church plans even less substantial\nthan the burden on plaintiffs with self-insured plans that are subject to ERISA.\u201d), cert. granted\nsub nom., S. Nazarene Univ. v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 445, and cert. granted, 136 S. Ct. 446 (2015).\n       15\n          The non-delegation doctrine is the constitutional principle that prevents Congress from\ndelegating its legislative authority to another body with \u201cunfettered discretion to make whatever\nlaws\u201d the body sees fit. A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 537-38\n(1935).\n\n\n                                                 21\n\f              Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 22 of 148\n\n\nthey must expel the charities\u2019 employees from their health plans if the Dioceses\n\nwish to take advantage of the religious exemption. 16\n\n       The Departments filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint\n\nor, alternatively, for summary judgment on all counts. The plaintiffs cross-moved\n\nfor summary judgment as to seven of their eight counts, which alleged that the\n\nmandate and accompanying regulations: burden religious exercise in violation of\n\nRFRA (Count One); violate the Free Exercise Clause, based on the same burden\n\n(Count Two); compel speech in violation of the Free Speech Clause (Count Three);\n\nprohibit speech in violation of the Free Speech Clause (Count Four); favor certain\n\nreligious groups and entangle the government in religion in violation of the\n\nEstablishment Clause (Count Five); interfere with internal church governance in\n\nviolation of both the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses (Count Six); and\n\ninvolve an impermissible delegation of unchecked legislative authority to the\n\nDepartments (Count Seven).\n\n       The district court granted summary judgment to Catholic Charities and\n\nCENGI on their RFRA claims, holding that the contraceptive mandate and\n\naccommodation substantially burden the organizations\u2019 religious exercise and are\n\nnot the least restrictive means to accomplish a compelling governmental interest.\n\n\n       16\n         We note that there is no dispute that EWTN, CENGI, and Catholic Charities qualify for\nthe accommodation and not for the religious employer exemption.\n\n\n                                             22\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 23 of 148\n\n\nThe court enjoined the Departments from enforcing the mandate or the\n\naccommodation against Catholic Charities and CENGI. In addition, the court\n\ngranted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their claim that the non-\n\ninterference provision created a content-based speech restriction in violation of the\n\nFirst Amendment.\n\n      As to the Dioceses\u2019 RFRA claim, the court granted summary judgment to\n\nthe Departments. The Dioceses had argued first that they might at some point have\n\nto pay more in premiums to help cover their plan providers\u2019 cost of contraceptive\n\ncoverage, in violation of their religious beliefs, and second that the distinction\n\nbetween religious employers and organizations eligible for the accommodation\n\nwould force the Dioceses to remove unaffiliated Catholic schools from their\n\ninsurance plans. Rejecting both arguments, the district court ruled that the first\n\nargument was merely speculative (and the outcome on which the Dioceses\n\nspeculated would, in any event, be prohibited by law) and the second argument\n\nfailed to assert a legitimate religious exercise. The district court granted the\n\nDepartments\u2019 summary judgment motion as to all of the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining\n\nclaims based on the First Amendment, the non-delegation doctrine, and the APA.\n\n      Despite the split judgment, only the Departments appealed the district\n\ncourt\u2019s decision. Because revisions to the regulations have rendered the plaintiffs\u2019\n\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 24 of 148\n\n\ncompelled speech claim based on the non-interference provision moot, 17 the appeal\n\nin this case concerns only the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to\n\nCatholic Charities and CENGI on their RFRA claim.\n\n                            II.     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       \u201cThis court reviews the district court\u2019s disposition of cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standards used by the district\n\ncourt, viewing the evidence and all factual inferences therefrom in the light most\n\nfavorable to the non-movant, and resolving all reasonable doubts about the facts in\n\nfavor of the non-moving party.\u201d Am. Bankers Ins. Group v. United States, 408\n\nF.3d 1328 (11th Cir. 2005). Summary judgment is proper if the movant can show\n\n\u201cthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Where the material facts\n\nare undisputed and all that remains are questions of law, summary judgment may\n\nbe granted. See Saregama India Ltd. v. Mosley, 635 F.3d 1284, 1290 (11th Cir.\n\n2011).\n\n\n\n\n       17\n          As noted above, in 2014 the Departments removed the regulations\u2019 requirement that\norganizations \u201cmust not, directly or indirectly, seek to influence the third party administrator\u2019s\ndecision to\u201d provide contraceptive coverage to the objecting organization\u2019s health plan\nparticipants and beneficiaries. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2713A(b)(1)(iii) (2013); see 79 Fed.

DISCUSSION\n\nA.    RFRA Claims\n\n      1.     Legal Background\n\n             a.     RFRA\n\n      RFRA provides that the federal government \u201cshall not substantially burden a\n\nperson\u2019s exercise of religion\u201d unless it demonstrates that the burden \u201cis in\n\nfurtherance of a compelling governmental interest\u201d and \u201cis the least restrictive\n\nmeans of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-\n\n1(a)-(b). Congress passed RFRA in 1993 in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\ndecision in Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v.\n\nSmith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), which held that \u201ca law that is neutral and of general\n\napplicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if\n\nthe law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.\u201d\n\nChurch of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993)\n\n(characterizing Smith). In Smith, the Supreme Court reasoned that \u201c[t]o make an\n\nindividual\u2019s obligation to obey [a neutral and generally applicable] law contingent\n\nupon the law\u2019s coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State\u2019s\n\ninterest is \u2018compelling[,]\u2019 . . . contradicts both constitutional tradition and common\n\nsense.\u201d Smith, 494 U.S. at 885 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 26 of 148\n\n\n      Congress stated that the purpose of RFRA was \u201cto restore the compelling\n\ninterest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin\n\nv. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972).\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb(b)(1). Congress declared the\n\nstrict scrutiny standard provided \u201ca workable test for striking sensible balances\n\nbetween religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00a7 2000bb(a)(5). Indeed, RFRA \u201cprovide[s] even broader protection for religious\n\nliberty than was available under\u201d Sherbert or Yoder because the government must\n\nalso show that it used the least restrictive means to achieve its compelling interest.\n\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2761 n.3.\n\n             b.     Hobby Lobby\n\n      In Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court held that enforcing the contraceptive\n\nmandate without an accommodation against closely held for-profit corporations\n\nthat objected on religious grounds to providing contraceptive coverage violated\n\nRFRA. The corporations and their owners challenged the mandate as substantially\n\nburdening their religious exercise. Id. at 2764-66. The owners of the corporations\n\nsincerely believed that life begins at conception and that it is a sin to facilitate\n\naccess to contraceptive drugs or devices that could destroy an embryo. Id. It was\n\nundisputed that the mandate required the plaintiffs to provide health insurance that\n\ncovered methods of contraception that could result in the destruction of an embryo.\n\nId. at 2775. The plaintiffs asserted that the mandate left them with only two\n\n\n                                            26\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 27 of 148\n\n\noptions: (1) provide coverage for contraception in violation of their religious\n\nbeliefs or (2) pay significant penalties. Given these choices, the Supreme Court\n\nheld that the mandate \u201cimpose[d] a substantial burden.\u201d Id. at 2779.\n\n      The government argued there was no substantial burden because the\n\nconnection between what the mandate required the plaintiffs to do (provide health\n\ninsurance that covered contraception) and the end that they found morally wrong\n\n(the destruction of an embryo) was too attenuated. Id. at 2777. The premise of the\n\ngovernment\u2019s attenuation argument was that \u201cproviding the coverage would not\n\nitself result in the destruction of an embryo; that would occur only if an employee\n\nchose to take advantage of the coverage and to use one of the four [contraceptive]\n\nmethods at issue.\u201d Id. In other words, the government asserted that the plaintiffs\u2019\n\nbelief\u2014that providing insurance coverage for contraception facilitated the\n\ndestruction of embryos\u2014was unreasonable. The Supreme Court rejected this\n\nargument, which would have required the Court to determine the \u201ccircumstances\n\nunder which it is wrong for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but\n\nthat has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by\n\nanother.\u201d Id. at 2778. The Supreme Court cautioned that \u201cfederal courts have no\n\nbusiness addressing\u201d such questions of religion and moral philosophy. Id. Instead,\n\nthe Supreme Court deferred to the plaintiffs\u2019 religious belief that the coverage \u201cis\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 28 of 148\n\n\nconnected to the destruction of embryo in a way that is sufficient to make it\n\nimmoral for them to provide the coverage.\u201d Id.\n\n       The Court then considered whether the mandate survived strict scrutiny.\n\nThe majority assumed that the mandate furthered a compelling governmental\n\ninterest 18 but held that it was not the least restrictive means of doing so. Id. at\n\n2779-80. The Court pointed to the accommodation, which at the time applied only\n\nto nonprofit organizations with religious objections, as a less restrictive alternative.\n       18\n           The majority opinion assumed without deciding that the government has a compelling\ninterest. In separate opinions, five members of the Court appeared to go further, suggesting that\na majority of the Court would agree that there is, in fact, a compelling interest.\n        The four dissenting justices concluded that the government carried its burden in showing\nthat the mandate \u201cfurthers compelling interests in public health and women\u2019s well being.\u201d\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2799 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Justice Kennedy, who joined the\nmajority, offered a separate concurrence in which he emphasized the importance of the\nmajority\u2019s assumption that there is a compelling interest without explicitly stating that he agreed\nwith that premise: \u201c[it is] important to confirm that a premise of the Court\u2019s opinion is its\nassumption that the HHS regulation here at issue furthers a legitimate and compelling interest in\nthe health of female employees.\u201d Id. at 2786 (Kennedy, J., concurring). He also reiterated the\ngovernment\u2019s position that the mandate \u201cprovid[ed] insurance coverage that is necessary to\nprotect the health of female employees, coverage that is significantly more costly than for a male\nemployee.\u201d Id. at 2785-86.\n        Justice Ginsburg in her dissent and other courts have treated Justice Kennedy\u2019s\nconcurrence as recognizing that the government has a compelling interest. See id. at 2800 n.23\n(Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (writing that Justice Kennedy \u201crecognize[d], without reservation,\u201d the\nexistence of a compelling interest); Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 786 F.3d 606, 624 (7th Cir.\n2015) (Hamilton, J., concurring) (\u201cJustice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion made clear that he\nviewed the governmental interests as compelling.\u201d); Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &\nHuman Servs., 772 F.3d 229, 257 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (explaining why Justice Kennedy\u2019s\nconcurrence was \u201cmore affirmative\u201d than the majority opinion in recognizing a compelling\ninterest), cert. granted sub nom., Roman Catholic Archbishop of Wash. v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct.\n444 (2015), and cert. granted, 136 S. Ct. 446 (2015). We are inclined to agree that Justice\nKennedy\u2019s concurring opinion can be read as recognizing a compelling interest. Nonetheless,\neven if Justice Kennedy merely assumed (but did not decide) there is a compelling interest, such\nthat a majority of the Supreme Court has not reached that conclusion, we conclude that there is a\ncompelling interest here. See infra Part III.B.2.c.(i).\n\n\n                                                28\n\f               Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 29 of 148\n\n\nThe Court explained that after an organization opts out, the plan provider (for\n\ninsured plans) or TPA (for self-insured plans) must exclude contraceptive coverage\n\nfrom the group health plan and provide separate payments for contraceptive\n\ncoverage without imposing cost sharing requirements on the organization, plan, or\n\nplan participants or beneficiaries. Id. at 2782. Although the Court declined to\n\nanswer whether the accommodation complied with RFRA, it lauded the\n\naccommodation as \u201cseek[ing] to respect the religious liberty of religious nonprofit\n\ncorporations while ensuring that the employees of these entities have precisely the\n\nsame access to all FDA-approved contraceptives as employees of companies\n\nwhose owners have no religious objections to providing such coverage.\u201d Id. at\n\n2759. The Court further recognized that \u201c[t]he effect of the HHS-created\n\naccommodation on the women employed by Hobby Lobby and the other\n\ncompanies involved in these cases would be precisely zero.\u201d 19 Id. at 2760.\n\n               c.      Wheaton College\n\n       After Hobby Lobby, the Court considered the accommodation itself in the\n\ncontext of an injunction sought under RFRA in Wheaton College. The Court\n\nenjoined the government from enforcing the mandate but required the plaintiff to\n\n       19\n           Justice Kennedy praised how the accommodation reconciled the competing priorities\nof ensuring that \u201cno person may be restricted or demeaned by government in exercising his or\nher religion\u201d and that the same exercise does not \u201cunduly restrict other persons . . . in protecting\ntheir own interests, interests the law deems compelling.\u201d Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2786-87\n(Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\n\n                                                 29\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 30 of 148\n\n\ninform HHS in writing that it had religious objections to providing coverage for\n\ncontraceptive services. 134 S. Ct. at 2807. The Court explained that the\n\ngovernment could \u201crely[] on this notice . . . to facilitate the provision of full\n\ncontraceptive coverage.\u201d Id. The practical effect of the Wheaton College decision\n\nwas twofold: the plaintiff received an accommodation, and HHS could rely on the\n\nnotification to provide contraceptive coverage to the participants and beneficiaries\n\nof the plaintiff\u2019s plan.\n\n              d.     Other RFRA Challenges to the Accommodation\n\n       After Hobby Lobby and Wheaton College, federal courts around the country\n\nconsidered RFRA challenges to the accommodation. Applying these two Supreme\n\nCourt decisions, seven of the eight circuits to review these cases held that the\n\naccommodation does not violate RFRA. See Mich. Catholic Conf. & Catholic\n\nFamily Servs. v. Burwell, 807 F.3d 738 (6th Cir. 2015); Catholic Health Care Sys.\n\nv. Burwell, 796 F.3d 207 (2d Cir. 2015); Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the\n\nAged v. Burwell, 794 F.3d 1151 (10th Cir.), cert. granted sub nom., S. Nazarene\n\nUniv. v. Burwell, 136 S.

Sec\u2019y U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Human Servs., 778 F.3d 422\n\n(3d Cir.), cert. granted sub nom., Zubik v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 444, and cert.\n\ngranted, 136 S. Ct. 445 (2015); Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Human\n\nServs. (\u201cPriests for Life I\u201d), 772 F.3d 229 (D.C. Cir. 2014), reh\u2019g en banc denied,\n\n(\u201cPriests for Life II\u201d), 808 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2015), cert. granted sub nom., Roman\n\nCatholic Archbishop of Wash. v. Burwell, 136 S. Ct. 444 (2015), and cert. granted,\n\n136 S. Ct. 446 (2015). These circuits concluded that the accommodation does not\n\nsubstantially burden religious exercise. 21 The Eighth Circuit disagreed, holding\n\nthat the accommodation substantially burdens religious exercise and cannot survive\n\nstrict scrutiny. Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health & Human Servs.,\n\n801 F.3d 927 (8th Cir. 2015), petition for cert. filed, 84 U.S.L.W. 3350 (U.S. Dec.\n\n15, 2015) (No. 15-775). Recently, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in several\n\nof these cases.\n\n       The seven circuits that upheld the accommodation recognized that the RFRA\n\nclaim in Hobby Lobby was fundamentally different from challenges to the\n       20\n         Before Hobby Lobby was decided, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the denial of a\npreliminary injunction to enjoin the enforcement of the mandate and accommodation in\nUniversity of Notre Dame v. Sebelius (\u201cNotre Dame I\u201d), 743 F.3d 547 (7th Cir. 2014).\nSubsequently, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the Seventh Circuit\u2019s judgment in\nNotre Dame I, and remanded for consideration in light of Hobby Lobby. Univ. of Notre Dame v.\nBurwell, 135 S. Ct. 1528 (2015). After considering Hobby Lobby, the Seventh Circuit issued\nNotre Dame II again affirming the denial of a preliminary injunction.\n       21\n         Two circuits have held, in the alternative, that even assuming the accommodation\nimposes a substantial burden, it survives strict scrutiny under RFRA. See Notre Dame II,\n786 F.3d at 616-17; Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 256-57.\n\n\n                                              31\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 32 of 148\n\n\naccommodation itself. In Hobby Lobby, the plaintiffs challenged the mandate\u2014\n\nthat is, the requirement that they provide contraceptive coverage\u2014when their only\n\noptions were to provide the coverage or pay significant penalties. But in the\n\naccommodation cases, the plaintiffs have challenged the regulatory scheme that\n\nallows them to opt out of the mandate without penalty. Put another way, the\n\nplaintiffs in the accommodation cases \u201cdo not challenge the general obligation\n\nunder the ACA to provide contraceptive coverage. They instead challenge the\n\nprocess they must follow to get out of complying with that obligation.\u201d Little\n\nSisters of the Poor, 794 F.3d at 1160. Because they assert that \u201cthe exemption\n\nprocess itself imposes a substantial burden on their religious faiths,\u201d their\n\nchallenges are somewhat \u201cparadoxical and virtually unprecedented.\u201d Priests for\n\nLife I, 772 F.3d at 246 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The circuits upholding the accommodation recognized that the question of\n\nwhether there is a substantial burden involves an objective inquiry. After\n\ninterpreting the ACA and its regulations, they held that the act of opting out does\n\nnot trigger contraceptive coverage. See, e.g., Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 614\n\n(explaining that \u201c[i]t is federal law, rather than the religious organization\u2019s signing\n\nand mailing the form, that requires . . . third-party administrators of self-insured\n\nhealth plans[] to cover contraceptive services\u201d). Although the eligible\n\norganizations asserted that the act of opting out makes them complicit in providing\n\n\n                                          32\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 33 of 148\n\n\ncoverage, these courts explained that this objection could not constitute a\n\nsubstantial burden because individuals \u201chave no RFRA right to be free from the\n\nunease, or even anguish, of knowing that third parties are legally privileged or\n\nobligated to act in ways their religion abhors.\u201d Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 246.\n\n       In Sharpe Holdings, the Eighth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion,\n\nholding that the accommodation substantially burdened religious exercise, and\n\nenjoined the government from enforcing the accommodation. Relying on Hobby\n\nLobby, the Eighth Circuit held that it was bound to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cassertion\n\nthat self-certification under the accommodation process\u2014using either Form 700 or\n\nHHS Notice\u2014would violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d22 Sharpe\n\nHoldings, 801 F.3d at 941. Because the plaintiffs faced a substantial penalty if\n\nthey failed to seek an accommodation or provide contraceptive coverage, the\n\nEighth Circuit concluded there was a substantial burden. Id. at 942.\n\n       The Eighth Circuit then applied strict scrutiny. The court assumed that the\n\ngovernment had a compelling interest but held that the government had failed to\n\ncarry its burden to show that it lacked other means to achieve its interest without\n\nimposing a substantial burden on religion. Id. at 943. The Eighth Circuit\n\n\n       22\n         Although the Eighth Circuit deferred to the plaintiffs\u2019 understanding of how the\naccommodation functioned, it agreed that the act of opting out triggered coverage. See Sharpe\nHoldings, 801 F.3d at 942 (TPAs have no \u201cwholly independent obligation\u201d to provide\ncontraceptive coverage).\n\n\n                                              33\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 34 of 148\n\n\nconcluded that less restrictive alternatives included the government: (1) requiring\n\nless information from eligible organizations seeking an accommodation; (2)\n\nassuming the cost of providing contraceptives through subsidies, reimbursements,\n\ntax credits, or tax deductions to employees; (3) paying for distribution of\n\ncontraceptives at community health centers, public clinics, and hospitals; or (4)\n\nmaking contraceptive coverage available through the healthcare exchanges. Id. at\n\n944-45. Given these alternatives, the Eighth Circuit concluded that the\n\naccommodation failed to survive strict scrutiny.\n\n       2.     RFRA Analysis\n\n       With this legal landscape in mind, we now consider the plaintiffs\u2019 RFRA\n\nchallenge. We hold that their challenge fails because (1) the accommodation does\n\nnot substantially burden their religious exercise, and (2) in the alternative, even if\n\nthere is a substantial burden, the accommodation survives strict scrutiny.\n\n              a.     The Plaintiffs Allege a Sincere Religious Belief.\n\n       A threshold question we must ask is whether the plaintiffs\u2019 religious beliefs\n\non which their RFRA claims are based are sincere. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n2774 n.28 (\u201cTo qualify for RFRA\u2019s protection, an asserted belief must be\n\n\u2018sincere\u2019. . . .\u201d). It is well established that we defer to a plaintiff\u2019s statement of its\n\nown belief, so long as the plaintiff actually holds that belief. See id. at 2779 (\u201c[I]t\n\nis not for [courts] to say that [the plaintiffs\u2019] religious beliefs are mistaken or\n\n\n                                            34\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 35 of 148\n\n\ninsubstantial.\u201d); Davila v. Gladden, 777 F.3d 1198, 1204 (11th Cir.) (\u201c[W]e look\n\nonly to see whether the claimant . . . actually holds the beliefs he claims to hold.\u201d\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)), cert. denied sub nom., Davila v. Hayes, 136 S.\n\nCt. 78 (2015).\n\n       Each plaintiff states that its religious beliefs prevent it from paying for,\n\nproviding, or facilitating the distribution of contraceptives. Each plaintiff also\n\nasserts that it cannot be complicit in the provision of contraception. The\n\ngovernment does not contest the sincerity of these religious beliefs, nor is there any\n\nindication whatsoever in the record that the stated beliefs are insincere. We thus\n\nconclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 religious beliefs at issue are sincere.\n\n             b.     The Accommodation Does Not Substantially Burden the\n                    Plaintiffs\u2019 Religious Exercise.\n\n      We now consider whether, accepting the plaintiffs\u2019 sincere religious beliefs,\n\nthe accommodation substantially burdens their religious exercise. The plaintiffs\n\nassert that the act of notifying HHS or their TPAs of their religious objection will\n\neither trigger contraceptive coverage or make them complicit in a system that\n\nprovides such coverage. Due to the significance they attach to opting out, the\n\nplaintiffs contend that the accommodation itself imposes a substantial burden\n\nbecause it puts them to the choice of violating their sincerely held religious beliefs\n\nor paying a substantial penalty. We accept the plaintiffs\u2019 sincere belief that\n\ntriggering coverage or being complicit in coverage violates their religious beliefs\n                                           35\n\f              Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 36 of 148\n\n\nand that the accommodation puts them to a choice between honoring their religious\n\nbeliefs and facing significant penalties. We nonetheless conclude that the\n\naccommodation imposes no substantial burden.\n\n                     (i)     The Substantial Burden Analysis Involves an\n                             Objective Inquiry.\n\n       \u201c[A] \u2018substantial burden\u2019 must place more than an inconvenience on\n\nreligious exercise.\u201d Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside, 366 F.3d 1214,\n\n1227 (11th Cir. 2004). 23 A law is substantially burdensome when it places\n\n\u201csignificant pressure\u201d on an adherent to act contrary to her religious beliefs,\n\nmeaning that it \u201cdirectly coerces the religious adherent to conform . . . her\n\nbehavior.\u201d Id. Thus, the government imposes a substantial burden when it places\n\n\u201cpressure that tends to force adherents to forego religious precepts.\u201d Id.\n\n       This inquiry involves both subjective and objective dimensions. Hobby\n\nLobby made clear that there is a subjective aspect to this inquiry: courts must\n\naccept a religious adherent\u2019s assertion that his religious beliefs require him to take\n\nor abstain from taking a specified action. See 134 S. Ct. at 2779. But the\n\n\n       23\n           Midrash concerned the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\n(\u201cRLUIPA\u201d), which Congress enacted after the Supreme Court struck down RFRA as applied to\nthe states in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997). RLUIPA imposes the same\nrequirement as RFRA\u2014that the government refrain from substantially burdening religious\nexercise unless the burden is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government\ninterest\u2014on programs and activities that receive federal funding. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-1. We\napply the same substantial burden analysis under both RLUIPA and RFRA. See generally\nDavila, 777 F.3d at 1204; Midrash, 366 F.3d at 1237.\n\n\n                                              36\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 37 of 148\n\n\nsubstantial burden analysis does not end there. We agree with our seven sister\n\ncircuits that the question of substantial burden also presents \u201ca question of law for\n\ncourts to decide.\u201d Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 247.\n\n      The objective inquiry requires courts to consider whether the government\n\nactually \u201cputs\u201d the religious adherent to the \u201cchoice\u201d of incurring a \u201cserious\u201d\n\npenalty or \u201cengag[ing] in conduct that seriously violates [his] religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nHolt v. Hobbs, 135 S. Ct. 853, 862 (2015) (second alteration in original and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Put another way, courts must determine what\n\nthe challenged law actually requires of the plaintiff. For example, in Holt, a\n\nMuslim inmate asserted that prison grooming policy substantially burdened his\n\nreligious exercise because it prohibited him from growing a beard, which his\n\nreligion required. The Supreme Court explained that because the \u201cgrooming\n\npolicy requires petitioner to shave his beard,\u201d the policy \u201cput[]\u201d him to the choice\n\nof violating his religious beliefs or facing serious disciplinary action. Id. In Holt,\n\nas in many RFRA cases, this inquiry was straightforward because there was no\n\ndispute about what the government\u2019s policy objectively required of the religious\n\nadherent. But when there is a dispute about what a law or governmental policy\n\nobjectively requires, it is for the courts to construe the law or policy.\n\n      The plaintiffs here contend that under Hobby Lobby no such objective\n\ninquiry is required. In their view, a religious adherent\u2019s mere assertion that she is\n\n\n                                           37\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 38 of 148\n\n\nbeing compelled to violate her sincerely held religious belief means that the\n\ngovernment has put her to such a choice, regardless of what the law objectively\n\nrequires. 24 We disagree. In Hobby Lobby, the plaintiffs challenged the\n\ncontraceptive mandate. It was undisputed that the mandate gave the plaintiffs just\n\ntwo options: provide contraceptive coverage or pay a substantial penalty.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court engaged in no objective analysis about what the\n\nmandate required, such analysis was unnecessary because the parties agreed that\n\nthe government, through the mandate, put the plaintiffs to the choice of providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage or paying a hefty fine. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n2777-79; see also Priests for Life II, 808 F.3d at 2 (Pillard, J.) (concurring in denial\n\nof reh\u2019g en banc) (\u201cThe parties in Hobby Lobby did not dispute what the law\n\nrequired, nor its practical effects . . . .\u201d).\n\n       Here, the parties agree that the plaintiffs have at least three options: provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage, pay a penalty, or use the accommodation to opt out of\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage. 25 But they disagree about whether opting out\n\n\n       24\n          The Eighth Circuit similarly interpreted Hobby Lobby as requiring courts to \u201caccept\n[the plaintiffs\u2019] assertion that self-certification under the accommodation process . . . would\nviolate their sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 941.\n       25\n          We agree with the dissent that the plaintiffs have a fourth option, as well: to terminate\ntheir TPAs and take over the costs and responsibilities of running their self-insured plans. See\nDissent at 109-10. But, the Departments contend there is no evidence of the existence of any\nself-insured plan without a TPA. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39880 (\u201c[T]he Departments continue to\nbelieve that there are no self-insured group health plans in this circumstance.\u201d). If an eligible\norganization elected to become the first self-insured plan without a TPA, it would enjoy at least a\n\n\n                                                 38\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 39 of 148\n\n\nputs the plaintiffs to the choice of violating their religious beliefs or paying a\n\nsubstantial fine. The plaintiffs contend that because an eligible organization\u2019s TPA\n\nonly becomes obligated to provide coverage when the organization opts out, by\n\nopting out they will be triggering coverage. The government argues to the contrary\n\nthat plan participants and beneficiaries are entitled to contraceptive coverage under\n\nthe ACA regardless of any opt out. We conclude that it is for the courts to\n\ndetermine objectively what the regulations require and whether the government\n\nhas, in fact, put plaintiffs to the choice of violating their religious beliefs by\n\nseeking the accommodation or incurring a substantial penalty.\n\n       We reject a framework that takes away from courts the responsibility to\n\ndecide what action the government requires and leaves that answer entirely to the\n\nreligious adherent. Such a framework improperly substitutes religious belief for\n\nlegal analysis regarding the operation of federal law. Indeed, the plaintiffs have\n\nidentified nothing in RFRA or case law that allows a religious adherent to dictate\n\nto the courts what the law requires. The plain language of RFRA simply does not\n\nsupport reducing the role of federal courts to \u201crubber stamps\u201d that automatically\n\n\ntemporary safe harbor so long as the plan notifies (1) HHS that it has no TPA and (2) plan\nparticipants and beneficiaries that the plan provides no benefits for contraceptive services. Id.\n        We assume for purposes of this appeal that if the government forced an eligible\norganization to have a self-insured plan without a TPA, it would be imposing a substantial\nburden. Nonetheless, we conclude there is no substantial burden because eligible organizations\ncan instead select the accommodation.\n\n\n                                                39\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 40 of 148\n\n\nrecognize a substantial burden whenever a religious adherent asserts there is one.\n\nCatholic Health Care Sys., 796 F.3d at 218. If Congress had intended strict\n\nscrutiny to be triggered in all circumstances by a religious adherent\u2019s claim that\n\nthere is a burden, it would have said so. Instead, it required that the federal\n\ngovernment \u201csubstantially burden\u201d the adherent\u2019s religious exercise.\n\n      Our dissenting colleague concedes that the question of substantial burden\n\ninvolves an objective inquiry but asserts that the inquiry should be limited to\n\nwhether the government has imposed a substantial penalty. See Dissent at 113-15.\n\nThis analysis would require courts to defer to a religious adherent\u2019s sincere belief\n\nthat the government is forcing her to choose between her religious belief and\n\npaying a substantial fine, even when the religious adherent is objectively wrong\n\nabout how the law operates and what action the government requires her to take.\n\nThe dissent\u2019s view is flawed because any burden (even an objectively insubstantial\n\none) becomes a substantial burden if the penalty is heavy enough.\n\n      We acknowledge that in Hobby Lobby the Supreme Court cautioned courts\n\nagainst dictating to religious adherents \u201cthe circumstances under which it is\n\nimmoral for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the\n\neffect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another.\u201d\n\n134 S. Ct. at 2778. In some cases, a court\u2019s objective analysis interpreting a statute\n\nor regulation may contradict a religious adherent\u2019s sincerely held belief about what\n\n\n                                          40\n\f               Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 41 of 148\n\n\nthat law requires. But such questions about what a law means are not the type of\n\n\u201cdifficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy\u201d for which\n\ncourts must defer to religious adherents. Id.; see Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 623\n\n(Hamilton, J., concurring) (explaining that the interpretation of the regulations that\n\ngive rise to the accommodation \u201cis an issue not of moral philosophy but of federal\n\nlaw\u201d).\n\n         Deciding how the law functions is not the only objective part of the\n\nsubstantial burden inquiry. The Supreme Court\u2019s free exercise cases (prior to\n\nSmith) distinguished between substantial burdens on religious exercise, which are\n\nprotected, and de minimis burdens, which are not. For example, a religious\n\nadherent may not \u201crequire the Government to conduct its own internal affairs in\n\nways that comport\u201d with the person\u2019s religious beliefs, even if the government\n\naction interferes with that person\u2019s religious exercise. Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693,\n\n699-700 (1986); see Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass\u2019n, 485 U.S. 439,\n\n451 (1988) (recognizing that government\u2019s decision to log and build roads would\n\n\u201chave severe adverse effects\u201d on practice of Native American religion but\n\nconcluding this burden was not \u201cheavy enough\u201d to trigger strict scrutiny under the\n\nFree Exercise Clause).\n\n         In Bowen, Native American parents challenged federal statutes requiring\n\nthem to provide their daughter\u2019s social security number to state welfare agencies as\n\n\n                                           41\n\f             Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 42 of 148\n\n\na condition of seeking benefits on the ground that it impinged upon their free\n\nexercise of religion. They sought an accommodation to keep the government from\n\nusing her social security number in administering benefits, which they believed\n\nwould rob their daughter of her spirit. 476 U.S. at 695-96.\n\n      Even recognizing that the parents had a sincere belief that by using her\n\nsocial security number the government would be stealing their daughter\u2019s spirit,\n\nthe Supreme Court rejected their claim, holding that the government\u2019s \u201cuse of a\n\nSocial Security number . . . does not itself in any degree impair [the parents\u2019]\n\nfreedom to believe, express, and exerc[ise their] religion.\u2019\u201d Id. at 700 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). The Court rejected the parents\u2019 attempt to use the Free\n\nExercise Clause to \u201cdemand that the Government join in their chosen religious\n\npractices.\u201d Id. at 699-700. The Court explained that \u201c[t]he Free Exercise Clause\n\naffords an individual protection from certain forms of governmental compulsion,\u201d\n\nyet does not extend so far to \u201cafford an individual a right to dictate the conduct of\n\nthe Government\u2019s internal procedures.\u201d Id. at 700. The Court acknowledged that\n\nthe parents\u2019 \u201creligious views may not accept\u201d the line that the Court drew\n\n\u201cbetween individual and governmental conduct,\u201d but it drew a line nonetheless.\n\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 43 of 148\n\n\nId. at 701 n.6. Likewise, under RFRA courts must determine whether the burden\n\non a religious adherent is, in fact, substantial. 26\n\n       As we alluded to above, the plain language of RFRA supports our\n\nconclusion that there is a distinction between a burden and a substantial burden.\n\nRFRA requires strict scrutiny only when the government \u201csubstantially burden[s] a\n\nperson\u2019s exercise of religion.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(a). Congress chose to\n\nmodify \u201cburden\u201d with \u201csubstantial[],\u201d27 and we must of course interpret RFRA to\n\ngive full effect to its every word. See TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31\n\n(2001) (recognizing that statutes should be construed whenever possible so that\n\n\u201cno clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant\u201d (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n\n\n\n       26\n           We reiterate that in Hobby Lobby the Supreme Court did not grapple with this aspect of\nthe substantial burden analysis. But it was plain that the action required of the plaintiffs in that\ncase\u2014paying to provide health insurance that included contraceptive coverage\u2014imposed a\nsubstantial burden. Accordingly, the Court had no occasion to address the more difficult\nquestion presented here, where the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of substantial burden rest on their assertion\nthat seeking an accommodation results in another entity (the TPA) providing contraceptive\ncoverage and thus makes them complicit in a system that achieves an end to which they have a\nreligious objection. In other words, Hobby Lobby did not pose the issue whether courts must\ndefer to a religious adherent\u2019s assertion that seeking an accommodation (opting out) itself\nimposes a substantial burden.\n       27\n           Congress used \u201csubstantial burden\u201d instead of \u201cburden\u201d in order \u201cto clarify [that] the\ncompelling interest required by the Religious Freedom [Restoration] Act applies only where\nthere is a substantial burden placed on the individual free exercise of religion.\u201d 139 Cong. Rec.\nS14352 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1993) (statement of Sen. Hatch) (emphasis added). Limiting RFRA\u2019s\napplication to substantial burdens was intended to ensure that the government was not required\n\u201cto justify every action that has some effect on religious exercise.\u201d Id.\n\n\n                                                43\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 44 of 148\n\n\n      We recognize that the distinction between burden and substantial burden is\n\nnot implicated in every RFRA case. Nonetheless, there are cases brought under\n\nRFRA in which the purported burden is too slight to trigger strict scrutiny. For\n\nexample, in Kaemmerling v. Lappin, an inmate challenged under RFRA the Bureau\n\nof Prison\u2019s collection and analysis of his DNA. 553 F.3d 669, 673-74 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2008). He claimed that the government\u2019s sampling, collection, and analysis of his\n\nDNA violated his sincerely held religious beliefs about the proper use of DNA.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit concluded there was no substantial burden. Importantly, the\n\ninmate had no religious objection to the collection of his bodily material; he\n\nchallenged only how the government would subsequently use that specimen to\n\nextract his DNA information. Id. at 678-79. There was no question that the\n\nBureau of Prisons required the inmate to submit a bodily specimen that would be\n\nused for an end to which he had a strong religious objection (that is, the collection\n\nand analysis of his DNA). But the D.C. Circuit held there was no substantial\n\nburden because the inmate \u201csuggest[ed] no way in which these government acts\n\npressure[d] him to modify his own behavior in any way that would violate his\n\nbeliefs.\u201d Id. at 679. Kaemmerling reinforces that a religious adherent cannot use\n\nRFRA to stop the government or third parties from taking subsequent actions to\n\nwhich he objects when the acts required of him impose a de minimis burden. 28\n\n      28\n           Our dissenting colleague worries that our framework creates a \u201cBizarro World\u201d in\n\n\n                                               44\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 45 of 148\n\n\n                      (ii)    No Substantial Burden Exists.\n\n       To determine whether the accommodation objectively puts plaintiffs to the\n\nchoice of violating their religious beliefs or paying a significant fine, we must\n\nunderstand how the accommodation functions and what it requires of these\n\nplaintiffs. The only act that the regulations require the plaintiffs to take is to seek\n\nthe accommodation\u2014that is, filling out and sending Form 700 to their TPAs or\n\nwriting a letter to HHS letting it know of their objections. The plaintiffs do not\n\ncontend that notifying HHS or their TPAs itself constitutes a substantial burden\n\nbecause of the time or effort involved. Rather, their objection is based on the\n\nsignificance they attribute to this act. They contend that the act of opting out\n\ntriggers contraceptive coverage for plan participants and beneficiaries or makes\n\nthem complicit in a system that provides contraceptive coverage. We accept that\n\nthe plaintiffs truly believe that triggering contraceptive coverage or being complicit\n\nin a system providing contraceptive coverage violates their religious beliefs. But\n\nwhich courts determine whether the burden imposed by a law or regulation violates the\nadherent\u2019s beliefs. Dissent at 117-18. The dissent overstates our position. We are not saying\nthat courts may determine that when a prison requires a Muslim inmate to shave his beard or the\ngovernment forces a Seventh-Day Adventist to work on the Sabbath, the religious adherent\u2019s\nclaim that the government is coercing him to forego his religious precepts is wrong. But when a\ndispute exists about whether the challenged governmental policy actually requires an inmate to\nshave his beard or a person to work on Saturday, it is for the courts to determine what the law\nrequires. See, e.g., Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 403-04 (Supreme Court performed its own analysis to\ndetermine whether challenged policy compelled Seventh-Day Adventist to work on Saturdays).\nLikewise, when a religious adherent challenges an accommodation scheme as imposing a\nsubstantial burden on the religious adherent based on subsequent actions taken by the\ngovernment or third parties, it is for the courts to determine whether the burden is substantial.\n\n\n                                               45\n\f              Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 46 of 148\n\n\nour objective inquiry leads us to conclude that the government has not put\n\nplaintiffs to the choice of violating their religious beliefs or facing a significant\n\npenalty. We hold there is no substantial burden.\n\n       Here\u2019s why: the ACA and HRSA guidelines are what entitle plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries to contraceptive coverage. The ACA provides that\n\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 self-insured plans \u201cshall, at a minimum provide coverage for and\n\nshall not impose any cost sharing requirements for . . . with respect to women, such\n\nadditional preventative care and screenings . . . as provided for in\u201d the HRSA\n\nguidelines. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). The HRSA Guidelines, in turn, \u201crequire\n\ncoverage, without cost sharing, for \u2018[a]ll . . . [FDA] approved contraceptive\n\nmethods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all\n\nwomen with reproductive capacity.\u2019\u201d 77 Fed. Reg. at 8725 (alterations in original)\n\n(quoting HRSA guidelines).\n\n       The plaintiffs and the dissent take a different view of the statutory and\n\nregulatory scheme, contending that an eligible organization\u2019s act of opting out\n\ntriggers the TPA\u2019s designation as plan administrator and, without it, plan\n\nparticipants or beneficiaries would not receive contraceptive coverage. 29 Indeed,\n\n\n       29\n       Because the plaintiffs here have only self-insured plans, we consider only the\naccommodation procedures that apply to self-insured health plans.\n      For an eligible organization with a plan insured by a third party, the accommodation\nimposes no new coverage obligation. The eligible organization\u2019s act of opting out simply makes\n\n\n                                              46\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 47 of 148\n\n\nthe dissent asserts that opting out requires an eligible organization\u2019s \u201caffirmative\n\nparticipation\u201d because the act of opting out is the \u201clinchpin on which the\n\ncontraceptive mandate rests.\u201d Dissent at 125. We disagree.\n\n       The ACA and the HRSA guidelines\u2014not the opt out\u2014are, to borrow the\n\ndissent\u2019s term, the \u201clinchpins\u201d of the contraceptive mandate because they entitle\n\nwomen who are plan participants and beneficiaries covered by group health\n\ninsurance plans to contraceptive coverage without cost sharing. In other words,\n\nwomen are entitled to contraceptive coverage regardless of their employers\u2019 action\n\n(or lack of action) with respect to seeking an accommodation. Because a woman\u2019s\n\nentitlement to contraceptive benefits does not turn on whether her eligible\n\norganization employer chooses to comply with the law (by providing contraceptive\n\ncoverage or seeking an accommodation) or pay a substantial penalty (in the form\n\nof a tax) for noncompliance, we cannot say that the act of opting out imposes a\n\nsubstantial burden. 30\n\n\n\nthe coverage the plan provider\u2019s \u201csole responsibility rather than one shared with the group health\nplan itself.\u201d Little Sisters of the Poor, 794 F.3d at 1181.\n       30\n           The dissent complains that our reading renders the act of opting out \u201cmeaningless.\u201d\nDissent at 128 (internal quotation marks omitted). The dissent misses our point. Although plan\nparticipants and beneficiaries are entitled to contraceptive coverage under federal law regardless\nof any opt out, notification of the opt out allows the government to identify the plan participants\nand beneficiaries who will not receive contraceptive coverage from a self-insured eligible\norganization because of that organization\u2019s religious objection to the mandate. In other words,\nthe act of opting out aids the government in identifying these women and making sure that they\nreceive the contraceptive coverage to which they are legally entitled. Thus, the act of opting out\n\n\n                                                47\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 48 of 148\n\n\n       We do not mean to imply that the act of opting out plays no causal role in\n\nthe ultimate provision of contraceptive coverage. We acknowledge that an eligible\n\norganization\u2019s act of notifying HHS or its TPA of its objection results in the TPA\u2019s\n\ndesignation as the plan administrator and gives rise to the TPA\u2019s obligation to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage. 31 See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-16(b). But we view an\n\neligible organization\u2019s act of opting out as, at most, an incidental cause of plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries receiving contraceptive coverage because these\n\nwomen are entitled to contraceptive coverage under the ACA and HRSA\n\nguidelines regardless of whether the eligible organization opts out. Accordingly,\n\neven if the act of opting out in some way leads to women receiving the\n\ncontraceptive coverage to which they were entitled under federal law, the plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to establish that the act of opting out substantially burdens their\n\nreligious exercise. Importantly, the government does not force an eligible\n\norganization to provide contraceptive coverage, pay costs related to contraceptive\n\ncoverage, notify plan participants and beneficiaries of the existence of such\n\ncoverage, or even include the availability of such coverage from a separate source\n\nin information the plan provides to plan participants and beneficiaries. Instead, all\n\nhas significance in the regulatory scheme, but not because it creates a woman\u2019s entitlement to\ncontraceptive coverage.\n       31\n          Indeed, the government has admitted that an eligible organization\u2019s opt out results in a\nTPA\u2019s designation as plan administrator and the TPA providing plan participants and\nbeneficiaries contraceptive benefits.\n\n\n                                                48\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 49 of 148\n\n\nof these responsibilities fall upon the TPA. Rather, the only action required of the\n\neligible organization is opting out: literally, the organization\u2019s notification of its\n\nobjection. Such an opt out requirement is \u201ctypical of religious objection\n\naccommodations that shift responsibility to non-objecting entities only after an\n\nobjector declines to perform a task on religious grounds.\u201d Little Sisters of the\n\nPoor, 794 F.3d at 1183.\n\n       The plaintiffs\u2019 challenge is in substance indistinguishable from an objection\n\nto the government\u2019s requiring another entity to provide coverage in their stead.\n\nSee Catholic Health Care Sys., 796 F.3d at 224 (characterizing an identical\n\nchallenge as seeking a \u201cblanket religious veto over the government\u2019s interactions\n\nwith others\u201d). Put differently, the plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to opting out is an\n\nobjection to their inability to keep the TPA with which they have contracted to\n\nprovide services in connection with healthcare coverage from complying with the\n\nrelevant regulations. The plaintiffs point to a but-for causal relationship between\n\ntheir opting out and the conduct that they find religiously objectionable. But, as\n\nthe Supreme Court has explained, a religious adherent cannot claim a substantial\n\nburden based on the subsequent conduct of another party. 32 See Bowen, 476 U.S.\n\n\n       32\n          The plaintiffs argue that under the accommodation they are facilitating access to\ncontraceptives because their ongoing contractual relationship with their TPA leads the TPA to\ncontinue to provide contraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries. It is true that a\nTPA remains as plan administrator for purposes of contraceptive coverage only so long as the\norganization serves as the plan\u2019s TPA. Nonetheless, the plaintiffs cannot show a substantial\n\n\n                                                 49\n\f               Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 50 of 148\n\n\nat 699-700 (\u201cJust as the government may not insist that appellees engage in any set\n\nform of religious observance, so appellees may not demand that the Government\n\njoin in their chosen religious practices by refraining from using a number to\n\nidentify their daughter.\u201d). 33\n\n       We recognize that the plaintiffs sincerely abhor and object to the subsequent\n\nacts taken by the government and their TPA, which ultimately result in the TPA\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage to their plan participants and beneficiaries. We\n\nacknowledge that they \u201cmay not accept [the] distinction\u201d that we draw here\n\nbetween their conduct and the downstream, separate conduct of HHS and the TPAs\n\nto provide coverage. Id. at 701 n.6. But we simply cannot say that RFRA affords\n\nthe plaintiffs the right to prevent women from obtaining contraceptive coverage to\n\nwhich federal law entitles them based on the de minimis burden that the plaintiffs\n\nface in notifying the government that they have a religious objection.\n\n       As the Seventh Circuit first articulated, an analogy to a conscientious\n\nobjector to the military draft illustrates why the accommodation does not impose a\n\n\nburden because, as explained above, their challenge is an objection to the TPA\u2019s subsequent\nconduct.\n       33\n          The dissent dismisses Bowen as distinguishable because the plaintiffs here object only\nto their own participation in the accommodation, not to any acts taken by the government. See\nDissent at 126-27 n.32. We are not persuaded. The dissent\u2019s position ignores that the plaintiffs\nobject to opting out because it requires them to play a causal role (albeit, a small one) in a system\nin which the government requires contraceptive coverage. Put another way, their religious\nobjection is, at its core, an objection to the government requiring the TPAs to provide coverage\nupon their opting out.\n\n\n                                                 50\n\f             Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 51 of 148\n\n\nsubstantial burden. See Notre Dame I, 743 F.3d at 556. A religious conscientious\n\nobjector to the military draft may opt of military service based on his belief that\n\nwar is immoral. The objector sincerely believes that his act of opting out triggers\n\nthe drafting of another person in his place, and thus renders him complicit in the\n\nvery thing to which he objects. But we would reject the assertion that the\n\ngovernment\u2019s subsequent act of drafting another person in his place\u2014even though\n\nthe drafting was in some sense caused by the objector\u2019s act of opting out\u2014\n\ntransforms the act of lodging a conscientious objection into a substantial burden.\n\nSee id. Likewise, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that opting out imposes a\n\nsubstantial burden because the government requires a third party to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage after an eligible organization opts out.\n\n      Accordingly, we conclude that through the accommodation the government\n\nhas imposed no substantial burden on the plaintiffs. We thus hold that the\n\naccommodation does not violate RFRA.\n\n             c.     The Accommodation Survives Strict Scrutiny.\n\n      Even assuming that the accommodation imposes a substantial burden on\n\nplaintiffs\u2019 religious exercise, RFRA allows the government to impose such a\n\nburden when it demonstrates that the burden \u201cis in furtherance of a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest\u201d and \u201cis the least restrictive means of furthering that\n\ncompelling governmental interest.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(b). Because the\n\n\n                                          51\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 52 of 148\n\n\ngovernment has carried its burden of showing that the accommodation is the least\n\nrestrictive means of furthering its compelling interests, we hold in the alternative\n\nthat the accommodation survives strict scrutiny under RFRA.\n\n                      (i)    Compelling Interests Justify the Accommodation.\n\n       In applying RFRA\u2019s strict scrutiny test, we must first determine whether the\n\naccommodation is \u201cin furtherance of a compelling governmental interest.\u201d Id.\n\nBecause the mandate and accommodation require the provision of cost-free\n\ncontraceptive coverage with little to no administrative burden on women, these\n\nregulations further compelling government interests in avoiding the adverse public\n\nhealth consequences of unintended pregnancies and in assuring women the equal\n\nbenefit of preventative care by requiring coverage for their distinctive health\n\nneeds. 34 See Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 258-59.\n\n\n\n\n       34\n          As we explained above, the majority in Hobby Lobby assumed without deciding that\nthere was a compelling governmental interest. There is, however, an argument that five justices\nconcluded there was a compelling interest. See supra note 18. But even if Justice Kennedy\u2019s\nconcurring opinion in Hobby Lobby did not recognize a compelling governmental interest, we\nwould hold that the compelling interest test is satisfied here.\n        We acknowledge that the majority opinion in Hobby Lobby criticized the government\u2019s\npurported interests in \u201cpromoting public health and gender equality\u201d as \u201cbroadly framed.\u201d 134\nS.

As\n\nexplained above, federal law generally guarantees women contraceptive coverage\n\nwithout cost sharing. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4); 77 Fed. Reg. at 8725\n\n(discussing HRSA guidelines). Importantly, under the mandate and\n\naccommodation, women covered by group health insurance plans generally are\n\nrequired to take no additional action to obtain this contraceptive coverage. This is\n\nbecause the coverage is delivered \u201cthrough the existing employer-based system of\n\nhealth coverage.\u201d 78 Fed. Reg. at 39888. Thus, under the mandate, women need\n\nnot complete extra paperwork or sign up for an additional program because the\n\ncontraceptive coverage is delivered with the health insurance they already have\n\nthrough their employers.\n\n      This is true even when an employer opts out of providing contraceptive\n\ncoverage by seeking an accommodation. Although objecting employers are not\n\nobligated to provide or pay for contraceptives, the women covered by their plans\n\nseamlessly receive contraceptive coverage from the plans\u2019 TPAs. This system was\n                                           56\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 57 of 148\n\n\ncarefully designed to make contraceptive coverage accessible by not requiring\n\nwomen to research plans that offer contraceptive coverage, purchase separate\n\ncontraceptive coverage, or even sign up with a different entity or program.

In\nresearch studies, \u201cwhen out-of-pocket costs for contraceptives were eliminated or reduced,\nwomen were more likely to rely on more effective long-acting contraceptive methods.\u201d IOM\nReport at 109. These methods include intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants, which are\nlong-lasting and have the additional advantage of not being dependent on user compliance.

See IOM Report at 108. Evidence shows that women\u2019s use of long-\nacting contraceptive methods easily can be increased by making the methods cheaper and more\nreadily available. In a study that provided intrauterine devices and implanted contraceptives at\nno cost to study participants, researchers found a significant decrease in unintended pregnancy\nand abortion rates in the study population.

Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2779. \u201cRFRA requires\n\nthe Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through\n\napplication of the challenged law \u2018to the person\u2019\u2014the particular claimant whose\n\nsincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.\u201d Gonzales v. O Centro\n\nEspirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 430-31 (2006) (quoting 42\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(b)); see also Yoder, 406 U.S. at 221 (\u201cWhere fundamental\n\nclaims of religious freedom are at stake, however, we cannot accept such a\n\nsweeping claim [of compelling interest]; despite its admitted validity in the\n\ngenerality of cases, we must searchingly examine the interests that the State seeks\n\nto promote . . . and the impediment to those objectives that would flow from\n\nrecognizing the claimed . . . exemption.\u201d).\n\n        Yoder provides a good example of the application of this principle. There,\n\nthe Amish plaintiffs challenged Wisconsin\u2019s law requiring high school attendance\n\nuntil the age of 16. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 207-08. The government asserted that the\n\nlaw was justified by a general interest in the virtues of universal education.

The Supreme Court was unsatisfied with this interest as it applied to the\n\nplaintiffs. \u201c[T]he evidence adduced by the Amish . . . [was] persuasively to the\n\neffect that an additional one or two years of formal high school for Amish children\n\nin place of their long-established program of informal vocational education would\n\ndo little to serve [the government\u2019s stated] interests.\u201d Id. at 222 (emphasis added).\n\n      Similarly, the government\u2019s argument in O Centro exemplifies an overly\n\ngeneralized interest. The plaintiffs, a religious sect with origins in the Amazon\n\nrainforest, challenged the Controlled Substances Act\u2019s regulation of hoasca, a\n\nhallucinogenic tea they used in religious ceremonies. The federal government\n\nargued that it had \u201ca compelling interest in the uniform application of the\n\nControlled Substances Act, such that no exception to the ban on use of the\n\nhallucinogen can be made to accommodate the sect\u2019s sincere religious practice.\u201d O\n\nCentro, 546 U.S. at 423. The Supreme Court dismissed this slippery slope\n\nargument, which it said \u201ccould be invoked in response to any RFRA claim for an\n\nexception to a generally applicable law,\u201d because it failed to consider the limited\n\neffect of an exception for the particular plaintiffs, and its stated need for universal\n\napplication was undermined by the existence of other exceptions. Id. at 435-36.\n\n      In contrast to Yoder and O Centro, here the government\u2019s stated interests all\n\nconcern the law\u2019s application to these particular plaintiffs. The government argues\n\nthat applying the accommodation procedure to the plaintiffs in these cases furthers\n\n\n                                           60\n\f              Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 61 of 148\n\n\nits interests because the accommodation ensures that the plaintiffs\u2019 female plan\n\nparticipants and beneficiaries\u2014who may or may not share the same religious\n\nbeliefs as their employer\u2014have access to contraception without cost sharing or\n\nadditional administrative burdens as the ACA requires. Unlike the exception made\n\nin Yoder for Amish children, whom the Supreme Court found had an adequate\n\nsubstitute for additional formal education to refute the government\u2019s compelling\n\ninterest, here the IOM Report\u2019s findings of poor health outcomes related to\n\nunintended or poorly timed pregnancies apply to the plaintiffs\u2019 female plan\n\nparticipants or beneficiaries and their children just as they do to the general\n\npopulation.\n\n      Moreover, the accommodation\u2019s requirement that the plaintiffs inform their\n\nTPAs or HHS of their religious objection is essential to achieving the\n\ngovernment\u2019s compelling interests. It ensures that a TPA is aware when it has an\n\nobligation to provide contraceptive coverage so that the women covered by these\n\nplans can receive coverage if they want it, without gaps in such coverage. The\n\nnotification also guarantees that the Departments will be able to identify objecting\n\norganizations, like the plaintiffs, to make sure that the accommodation procedures\n\nwork (that is, to independently ensure that the women covered by the plaintiffs\u2019\n\nplans are receiving the coverage to which they are entitled). Thus, the\n\ngovernment\u2019s interests are sufficiently particular to satisfy the O Centro standard.\n\n\n                                          61\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 62 of 148\n\n\n                           (c)    The Exceptions to the Mandate and\n                                  Accommodation Do Not Undermine the\n                                  Government\u2019s Compelling Interest.\n\n      The plaintiffs argue that the government\u2019s interests in providing broad\n\ncontraceptive coverage cannot be compelling because the ACA provides\n\nexemptions from the mandate for other types of employers\u2014namely, those (1)\n\nwith grandfathered health plans, (2) with fewer than 50 employees, and (3) that\n\nqualify as \u201creligious employers.\u201d We disagree.\n\n      First, the existence of grandfathered plans does not undermine the\n\ngovernment\u2019s compelling interest in providing contraceptive coverage because\n\ngrandfathered plans are only a short-lived, transitional measure intended to ease\n\nthe burden of compliance with the ACA\u2019s sweeping reforms. 78 Fed. Reg. at\n\n39887 n.49 (\u201c[T]he Affordable Care Act\u2019s grandfathering provision is only\n\ntransitional in effect, and it is expected that a majority of plans will lose their\n\ngrandfathered status by the end of 2013.\u201d). To be grandfathered, a plan must\n\ncontinue to provide virtually the same benefits for the same percentage cost\n\nsharing as the plan had in effect on March 23, 2010. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140(g)(1)(ii).\n\nIt becomes difficult to comply with these requirements over time. See, e.g.,\n\nSecond Am. Compl. at 23-24, No. 1:12-cv-03489, Doc. 56 (describing the Atlanta\n\nArchdiocese\u2019s inability to afford to maintain its grandfathered plan past January 1,\n\n2014).\n\n\n                                           62\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 63 of 148\n\n\n       Research by the Kaiser Family Foundation demonstrates that the percentage\n\nof workers covered by grandfathered plans has rapidly declined: 26 percent in\n\n2014, down from 36 percent in 2013, 48 percent in 2012, and 56 percent in 2011.\n\nKaiser Family Found. & Health Research & Ed. Trust, Employer Health Benefits\n\n2015 Annual Survey at 218 (Sept. 22, 2015). 39 In addition, some employees\n\ncovered by grandfathered plans may in fact be receiving contraceptive benefits\n\nwithout cost sharing because, though not required to do so, their plans may include\n\nsuch a benefit.\n\n       As an additional consideration, we do not wish to penalize the government\n\nfor phasing in the ACA\u2019s requirements to help businesses adjust to a new health\n\ncare regulatory landscape. Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 746 (1984)\n\n(\u201cWe have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting\n\nreasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an\n\nunconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time. . . . The\n\nprotection of reasonable reliance interests is . . . a legitimate governmental\n\nobjective.\u201d). Accordingly, even if the mandate and accommodation are phased in\n\n\n\n       39\n          We acknowledge that the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s 2015 data shows that 25% of\ncovered workers are enrolled in a grandfathered plan, which is not much less than the 26% in\n2014. But the Foundation reported that many employers were confused and unsure about\nwhether their plans remained grandfathered, suggesting that employers may have inaccurately\nreported that they had grandfathered plans. Kaiser Family Found., supra, at 214.\n\n\n                                              63\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 64 of 148\n\n\nover time, the gradual implementation is insufficient to undermine the\n\ngovernment\u2019s compelling interest.\n\n      Second, the ACA\u2019s treatment of employers with 50 or fewer employees as\n\nexempt from the \u201cemployer mandate\u201d and therefore not required to provide\n\nemployees with health insurance at all, see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H(a)(c)(2)(A), does\n\nnot undercut the government\u2019s compelling interests. If, on the one hand, smaller\n\nemployers do not provide insurance coverage, then their employees must purchase\n\nhealth plans on the health insurance exchanges or face tax penalties. See id.\n\n\u00a7 5000A(a), (b)(1). And plans purchased on the exchanges will include\n\ncontraceptive coverage. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). If, on the other hand,\n\nsmaller employers choose to provide health insurance, then their plans are subject\n\nto the contraceptive mandate. See id. The employees of small businesses therefore\n\nwill receive contraceptive coverage regardless of whether their employers are\n\nexempt from providing health insurance. This exemption reflects a practical\n\nrecognition that small businesses have different financial realities from larger\n\nbusinesses. It in no way undermines the government\u2019s interest in providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage without cost sharing because small businesses\u2019 employees\n\nend up with health plans subject to the contraceptive mandate whether the\n\nemployers provide health insurance or not.\n\n\n\n\n                                          64\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 65 of 148\n\n\n      Third, the exemption from the contraceptive mandate for religious\n\nemployers does not weaken the government\u2019s stated interests. Under the HRSA\n\nguidelines, the contraceptive mandate does not apply to a group health plan run by\n\na religious employer, defined by the regulations as \u201can organization that is\n\norganized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred to in section\n\n6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\u201d\n\n45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(a). In finalizing the regulations, the Departments declined to\n\nextend the exemption to other organizations that have religious objections to the\n\nmandate because:\n\n      Houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to\n      contraceptive coverage on religious grounds are more likely than\n      other employers to employ people of the same faith who share the\n      same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than other\n      people to use contraceptive services even if such services were\n      covered under their plan.\n\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39874.\n\n       The exemption for religious employers attempts to balance the need for\n\ncontraceptive coverage with our nation\u2019s longstanding history of deferring to a\n\nhouse of worship\u2019s decisions about its internal affairs. See 76 Fed. Reg. at 46623\n\n(\u201c[T]he Departments seek to provide for a religious accommodation that respects\n\nthe unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in\n\nministerial positions.\u201d); see also Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church &\n\nSch. v. EEOC, 132 S. Ct. 694, 704-06 (2012) (describing history of non-\n                                          65\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 66 of 148\n\n\ninterference with internal affairs of houses of worship). The government\n\nundoubtedly has a compelling interest in respecting the values of religious\n\nemployers and their employees, and pursuing that interest does not undermine the\n\ngovernment\u2019s equally compelling interest in improving women\u2019s and the public\u2019s\n\nhealth by making contraceptives easier to obtain. Especially with regard to\n\nsweeping legislation like the ACA, the government is often faced with competing\n\ncompelling interests. Courts may allow the government to balance those interests\n\nwithout undermining any individual compelling interest. See Hobby Lobby,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 2780 (\u201cEven a compelling interest may be outweighed in some\n\ncircumstances by another even weightier consideration.\u201d).\n\n       We also reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Departments\u2019 distinction\n\nbetween houses of worship (which are exempted from the mandate) and other\n\norganizations with religious affiliation (which must seek an accommodation) is\n\nillogical. Although it may not universally hold true, 40 it is a common-sense notion\n\nthat a church\u2019s employees likely share more beliefs with the church than do the\n\nemployees of, for example, a school linked to that church, and therefore the\n\nemployees of a church that objects to contraception are less likely to use\n\ncontraceptive coverage even if it is available. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. Thus,\n\n       40\n         EWTN in particular argues that the Departments\u2019 distinction between houses of\nworship and other religious organizations is illogical and does not hold for EWTN because, like\nemployees of \u201creligious employers,\u201d its employees share its religious convictions.\n\n\n                                               66\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 67 of 148\n\n\nthe Departments distinguished between houses of worship and other religious\n\ngroups using the readily available and well-established IRS tax status test. This\n\ntest is predictable for affected organizations and easy for the Departments to\n\nimplement. See United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 260-61 (1982) (noting it was\n\nreasonable for Congress to exempt self-employed Amish from Social Security\n\ntaxes because the exemption for \u201cthe self-employed provided for a narrow category\n\nwhich was readily identifiable . . . [and] distinguishable from the generality of\n\nwage earners employed by others\u201d). We do not think that the Departments\u2019\n\ndecision to exempt houses of worship based on a bright-line test while\n\naccommodating other religious organizations undercuts the government\u2019s\n\ncompelling interests in enforcing the contraceptive mandate.\n\n      In sum, the mandate and accommodation further the government\u2019s\n\ncompelling interests by ensuring that women have contraceptive coverage without\n\ncost sharing or additional administrative hurdles. Additionally, by requiring\n\norganizations that opt out of the mandate to identify themselves, the government\n\nensures that these organizations\u2019 health plan participants and beneficiaries can\n\nreceive the coverage seamlessly through other channels. Although the government\n\nhas attempted to accommodate religious freedom as well as the needs of\n\nbusinesses, it has not done so in a way that undermines its goal of ensuring access\n\nto contraception.\n\n\n                                          67\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 68 of 148\n\n\n                    (ii)   The Mandate and Accommodation Are the Least\n                           Restrictive Means of Furthering the Government\u2019s\n                           Compelling Interests.\n\n      As a final step, we must determine whether the mandate and accommodation\n\nare \u201cthe least restrictive means of furthering\u201d the government\u2019s compelling\n\ninterests. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(b). This test is \u201cexceptionally demanding.\u201d\n\nHobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2780. The government must show \u201cthat it lacks other\n\nmeans of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the\n\nexercise of religion by the [plaintiffs].\u201d Id. When a less restrictive alternative\n\nserves the government\u2019s compelling interest \u201cequally well,\u201d the government must\n\nuse that alternative. Id. at 2782; see id. at 2786 (Kennedy, J. concurring)\n\n(considering whether alternative \u201cequally furthers the Government\u2019s interest\u201d).\n\n      In determining whether potential alternatives to the mandate and\n\naccommodation equally further the government\u2019s interests, we must consider both\n\nthe cost to the government and the burden the alternatives impose on the affected\n\nwomen. See id. at 2760 (majority opinion) (\u201c[W]e certainly do not hold or suggest\n\nthat RFRA demands accommodation of a for-profit corporation\u2019s religious beliefs\n\nno matter the impact that accommodation may have on thousands of women\n\nemployed by Hobby Lobby.

Because there are no less restrictive means\n\navailable that serve the government\u2019s interests equally well, we hold that the\n\nmandate and accommodation survive strict scrutiny under RFRA.\n\n      Although the plaintiffs and the dissent suggest several potential less\n\nrestrictive alternatives to the mandate and accommodation, their proposals fail to\n\nachieve the government\u2019s interests as effectively. Indeed, their proposals impose\n\nburdens on women that would make contraceptives less accessible than they\n\ncurrently are. Because these proposals cannot be expected to reduce the rate of\n\nunintended pregnancies and thereby improve the health of women and children as\n\neffectively as the mandate and accommodation, they do not qualify as less\n\nrestrictive alternatives under RFRA.\n\n      Previously, the Supreme Court and a member of this Court suggested that a\n\nless restrictive alternative would be to allow eligible organizations to notify HHS\n\nof their opt out, instead of having to provide Form 700 to their plan providers or\n\nTPAs. See Wheaton Coll., 134 S. Ct. at 2807; Eternal Word Television Network,\n\n756 F.3d at 1349 (William Pryor, J., concurring) (\u201cThe United States, for example,\n\ncould require the Network to provide a written notification of its religious\n\n\n                                          69\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 70 of 148\n\n\nobjection to the Department of Health and Human Services, instead of requiring\n\nthe Network to submit Form 700\u2014an instrument under which the health insurance\n\nplan is operated\u2014to the third-party administrator.\u201d). The Departments have\n\nresponded to and addressed this concern by revising the accommodation\n\nprocedures to allow eligible organizations notify HHS directly of their desire to opt\n\nout of the contraceptive mandate. 79 Fed.

With that potential\n\nalternative incorporated into the regulatory scheme, we turn to the alternatives\n\nproposed by the plaintiffs and the dissent.\n\n                             (a)     The Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposals\n\n       The plaintiffs propose two less restrictive alternatives. First, they suggest\n\nthat the government could pay directly for all contraceptive coverage, in effect a\n\nsingle-payer system for contraceptives only, 41 either by creating a new government\n\nprogram or expanding an existing one. 42 Either way Congress would need to pass\n\nlegislation that would fundamentally change how the majority of American women\n\n\n       41\n          In a single-payer system, the government\u2014as opposed to employers, health insurers, or\npatients\u2014pays for healthcare services. See Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 615; Single-Payer,\nMerriam Webster Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/single-payer (last\nvisited Feb. 12, 2016). Although the plaintiffs never call their proposal a \u201csingle-payer\u201d system\nfor contraceptives, the label applies because they propose a system in which the government\nwould be the sole payer for contraceptives and related services. It is important to note that all\nother health care would continue to be provided through our existing system.\n       42\n          The plaintiffs suggest, for example, that Congress could expand Title X, which\ncurrently benefits only low-income families; patients whose income exceeds 250 percent of the\npoverty level must pay for any services they receive through Title X programs. See 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 300a-4(c); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 59.5(a)(8).\n\n\n                                               70\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 71 of 148\n\n\nreceive their healthcare coverage for contraception. 43 See Jessica C. Smith & Carla\n\nMedalia, U.S. Census Bureau, Health Insurance Coverage in the U.S.: 2014 at 3\n\n(2015) (55% of Americans had insurance coverage provided by an employer in\n\n2014). Among other things, adopting a single-payer system for contraception\n\nwould require Congress to squeeze insurance companies out of an entire segment\n\nof the health insurance business.44 Second, the plaintiffs assert that the\n\ngovernment could provide tax credits to reimburse women for purchasing\n\ncontraceptive coverage. 45 Under either the single-payer or tax credit proposals, all\n\ncoverage for contraception and related services would operate outside the existing,\n\nlargely employer-based, insurance system.\n\n\n\n\n       43\n           In Hobby Lobby, the government argued that RFRA does not permit the court to\nconsider proposals that would require the government to create entirely new programs as less\nrestrictive alternatives. The Court rejected this argument, explaining \u201cwe see nothing in RFRA\nthat supports this argument.\u201d Hobby Lobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2781. Accordingly, we consider this\nproposal even though it would require substantial congressional action to expand significantly an\nexisting program or create a new one.\n       44\n          We may, of course, consider the burdens that a proposed alternative places on\nnonbeneficiaries, such as insurance companies. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 720-722\n(2005) (\u201c[A]pplying RLUIPA, courts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested\naccommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries. . . . Our decisions indicate that an\naccommodation must be measured so that it does not override other significant interests.\u201d).\n       45\n         The plaintiffs suggest the government could require women to purchase separate\ncontraceptive coverage on the healthcare exchanges and then offer tax credits to offset the cost of\npurchasing the coverage. This proposal would require Congress to amend the ACA because the\nexchanges are statutorily restricted to selling only full health insurance policies. See 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 18021(a)(1)(B), 18022(a), (b).\n\n\n                                                71\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 72 of 148\n\n\n       Most importantly, these proposals are not less restrictive alternatives\n\nbecause they would not serve the government\u2019s interests \u201cequally well.\u201d 46 Hobby\n\nLobby, 134 S. Ct. at 2782. As the Departments explain, these proposals would\n\ncause all women who have existing contraceptive coverage through group health\n\ninsurance plans to lose such coverage, forcing them instead to \u201ctake steps to learn\n\nabout, and to sign up for, a new health benefit.\u201d 78 Fed. Reg. at 39888. Indeed,\n\nunder these proposals, women would have one employer-provided health insurance\n\nplan covering healthcare other than contraception. Then, they would have to take\n\nadditional, separate steps to secure contraceptives or contraceptive coverage.\n\nUnder a single-payer system for contraceptives, they would have to research the\n\nfederal entitlement for contraceptives and register for the program. Under a tax-\n\ncredit system, they would have to research plans offering separate contraceptive\n\ncoverage, select a plan, purchase coverage, and later file for a tax credit as part of\n\ntheir individual tax returns. 47 The mandate and accommodation present an easier,\n\n\n       46\n           We acknowledge dicta in Hobby Lobby suggesting as a less restrictive alternative that\nthe government pay directly for contraception; however, the Supreme Court did not hold that\nsuch a program was a less restrictive alternative. 134 S. Ct. at 2871-82 (\u201c[W]e need not rely on\nthe option of a new, government-funded program in order to conclude that the HHS regulations\nfail the least-restrictive-means test.\u201d).\n       47\n           The tax-credit proposal is particularly problematic because it forces women to pay up\nfront for contraceptives in exchange for tax credits later. But many women simply would not be\nable to afford to wait a year for a refund from the government in the form of a tax credit and, as\nthe government\u2019s evidence shows, would instead have to forgo using contraceptives. See IOM\nReport at 109 (recognizing that \u201ccost-sharing requirements, such as deductibles and copayments,\ncan pose barriers to care and result in reduced use of preventive . . . services\u201d); see also supra\n\n\n                                                72\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 73 of 148\n\n\nsimpler, and more certain path for women by ensuring that, by obtaining health\n\ninsurance, they also secure contraceptive coverage, even when their employers opt\n\nout.\n\n       Because plaintiffs\u2019 proposals impose greater barriers to contraceptive access\n\nthan exist under the mandate and accommodation, their proposals likely will lead\n\nto lower rates of contraceptive usage (along with use of less effective forms of\n\ncontraception), meaning these proposals will be less effective at preventing\n\nunintended pregnancies and concomitant health consequences. 48 See IOM Report\n\nat 104-09; Foster, supra, at 566 (reflecting that when obtaining contraceptives\n\nbecame less convenient, the rate of unintended pregnancy increased); see also\n\n78 Fed. Reg. at 39888 (recognizing that these proposals would be \u201cless effective\n\nthan the employer-based system of health coverage in advancing the government\u2019s\n\ncompelling interests\u201d).\n\n       Plaintiffs\u2019 proposals would make contraception less accessible not only to\n\nwomen who currently receive contraceptive coverage through a group insurance\n\n\nnote 38. In contrast, the mandate and accommodation require women to pay nothing upfront for\ncontraceptives. Accordingly, contraceptives are significantly more available to women under the\nmandate and accommodation than they would be under the tax-credit proposal.\n       48\n          The two other circuit courts to address this issue have rejected similar alternatives for\nthe same reason. See Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 616-17 (rejecting similar proposed alternatives\nbecause they \u201cwould impede the receipt of [contraceptive] benefits\u201d); Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d\nat 265 (holding that proposed alternatives \u201cwould not serve the government\u2019s compelling interest\nwith anywhere near the efficacy of the challenged accommodation and would instead deter\nwomen from accessing contraception\u201d).\n\n\n                                                73\n\f               Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 74 of 148\n\n\nplan, but also to women who currently purchase health insurance through the\n\nexchanges, including women who work for an employer with fewer than 50 full-\n\ntime employees. Under the current framework, these women must research and\n\ncompare potential health insurance plans sold on the exchanges and then purchase\n\nand sign up for a plan. As a result of their efforts, they receive health insurance\n\nthat includes contraceptive coverage. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). Under the\n\nplaintiffs\u2019 proposals, these women would still have to procure health insurance\n\nfrom the exchanges. But then they would have to take the additional steps\n\ndescribed above to obtain coverage for contraceptives. In other words, women\n\nwho currently purchase insurance through the exchanges would also face greater\n\nburdens accessing contraceptives under a single-payer system. 49\n\n\n       49\n          It is unclear whether our dissenting colleague advocates as a less restrictive alternative\nreplacing our insurance-based system with a single-payer system for contraceptive coverage. On\nthe one hand, the dissent never states that a single-payer system would be a less restrictive\nalternative, instead proposing that the ACA and ERISA need only a \u201cslight[] tweak,\u201d not the\njettisoning of our insurance-based system for contraceptives that a single-payer system would\nentail. Dissent at 137. On the one other hand, the dissent argues that the government should\n\u201cprovid[e] for contraceptive coverage directly without the accommodation\u2019s administrative\nrigmarole\u201d so that the government could \u201coffer cost-free access to each and every woman in the\nUnited States.\u201d Id. at 134. This sounds to us like a single-payer system.\n        Indeed, the dissent suggests that a single-payer system would be as effective or more\neffective than the mandate and accommodation at making contraceptives accessible to women.\nBecause under either system women pay nothing for contraceptives, to compare women\u2019s access\nto contraceptives under the two systems, we must focus on the administrative burdens that\nwomen face under either system.\n        We conclude that, on the whole, women face fewer barriers to obtaining contraceptives\nunder the mandate and accommodation than they would under a single-payer system. Most\nsignificantly, most women covered by group health insurance plans and all who purchase\ninsurance on the exchanges seamlessly receive coverage under the mandate and accommodation.\n\n\n                                                74\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 75 of 148\n\n\n       After careful consideration, we conclude that the government has shown that\n\ncontraceptives would be less accessible\u2014and used less frequently or effectively\u2014\n\nunder the plaintiffs\u2019 proposals then they are under the mandate and\n\n\nNonetheless, the dissent asserts that a single-payer system is a more effective way to improve\naccess to contraceptives because three categories of women whose employers are exempt from\nthe contraceptive mandate\u2014(1) women employed by small businesses, (2) women covered by\ngrandfathered plans, and (3) women employed by churches or church-affiliated organizations\u2014\nwould have greater access to contraceptives under such a system. See id. at 50. After\nconsidering these three categories, we remain convinced that a single-payer system would be less\neffective than the mandate and accommodation.\n        First, the dissent suggests that women whose employers have 50 or fewer full-time\nemployees would receive better access to contraceptives under a single-payer system. But, as we\nexplained above, these women receive contraceptive coverage under the mandate and\naccommodation regardless of whether their employers elect to provide health insurance coverage\nor they purchase a plan on the exchanges. See supra Part III.A.2.c.(i).(c). Given that these\nwomen currently have seamless access to contraceptives, we fail to see how this group supports\nthe dissent\u2019s argument.\n        Second, the dissent asserts that women whose health plans have a grandfathered\nexemption would have better access to contraceptives under a single-payer system. But the\ndissent overlooks that the grandfathered exemption is a temporary measure, meaning the number\nof women covered by plans subject to the exemption has rapidly declined and should continue to\ndecline over time because it becomes more expensive for plans to maintain their grandfathered\nstatus. See 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140(g)(1) (requiring grandfathered plans to provide virtually the\nsame benefits for the same percentage cost sharing that the plan had in effect on March 2010).\nWe cannot say that a single-payer system serves the government\u2019s interest as effectively or more\neffectively simply because in the short term a subset of women may have easier access to\ncontraceptives under a single-payer system.\n         Third, the dissent argues that women employed by churches and church-affiliated\norganizations would have easier access to contraceptives under a single-payer system. Even if\nthat is true for this relatively small group of women, the Departments have explained that these\nemployees are likely to share their employer\u2019s religious objection to contraception, meaning they\nare \u201cless likely than other people to use contraceptive services even if such services were\ncovered under the plan.\u201d 78 Fed. Reg. at 39874. All together, we cannot say that a single-payer\nsystem serves the government\u2019s interest as effectively as the mandate and accommodation when\nwe consider that a single-payer system would impose greater barriers to accessing contraceptives\nfor most women who purchase health insurance from an employer and all women who purchase\nplans on the exchanges. What\u2019s more, the balance tips even further in favor of the mandate and\naccommodation when we consider the impact of imposing on non-beneficiaries a single-payer\nsystem for an entire segment of preventative care. See Cutter, 544 U.S. at 720.\n\n\n                                               75\n\f                Case: 14-12696   Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 76 of 148\n\n\naccommodation. Given the government\u2019s compelling interest in minimizing the\n\nbarriers women face in accessing contraceptives so that they will use\n\ncontraceptives to lower the rate of unintended pregnancies, we conclude that the\n\nplaintiffs\u2019 proposals would not serve the government\u2019s interest equally as well as\n\nthe mandate and accommodation. Thus, they fail to qualify as less restrictive\n\nalternatives.\n\n      The dissent criticizes our position as giving the Departments a \u201cfree pass\u201d on\n\nthe least restrictive means requirement. Dissent at 139. Our dissenting colleague\n\ntakes our analysis to mean that the government can defeat a potential alternative\n\nmerely by showing that the alternative would take away a benefit\u2014any benefit\u2014\n\nthat the government\u2019s existing framework provides to \u201cthird parties\u201d (here, the\n\nwomen who are the intended beneficiaries of the mandate and accommodation).\n\nId. at 138. The dissent overstates our position. We are not saying that the\n\ngovernment can always overcome strict scrutiny by showing that proposed\n\nalternatives would take away a benefit that the current framework provides.\n\nRather, on the facts and record of this case\u2014including the evidence that when\n\nwomen face greater burdens (whether financial or administrative) in accessing\n\ncontraceptives or contraceptive coverage, they are less likely to use\n\ncontraceptives\u2014we must conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 alternatives, which make\n\ncontraceptives less accessible, would be significantly less effective than the\n\n\n                                           76\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 77 of 148\n\n\nmandate and accommodation at reducing the rate of unintended pregnancies and\n\nthus would thwart the government\u2019s interests. 50\n\n                              (b)    The Dissent\u2019s Proposal\n\n       The dissent suggests that Congress could \u201cslightly tweak\u201d the ACA and\n\nERISA to \u201celiminate the need for eligible organizations to affirmatively designate\n\nthe third-party administrators of their health plans.\u201d Dissent at 137. We\n\nunderstand the dissent\u2019s proposal to be that Congress should pass legislation and\n\nthe Departments should enact regulations that would designate the TPA for a self-\n\ninsured eligible organization as plan administrator for purposes of contraceptive\n\ncoverage without requiring the eligible organization to communicate its religious\n\nobjection to anyone.\n\n       The dissent\u2019s proposal fails to serve the government\u2019s interest equally as\n\nwell as the accommodation because the alternative would make contraceptives less\n\naccessible to women covered by eligible organizations\u2019 plans than would the\n\naccommodation. The dissent fails to explain\u2014and we cannot imagine\u2014how a\n\nTPA would know when an employer has a religious objection to providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage under the proposal and thus that the TPA is required to\n\n\n       50\n          The Eighth Circuit\u2019s proposal that \u201cthe government could pay for the distribution of\ncontraceptives at community health centers, public clinics, and hospitals with income-based\nsupport\u201d likewise would impose additional administrative burdens on women and thus in a\nsimilar way fails to satisfy the government\u2019s interests. Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 945.\n\n\n                                               77\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 78 of 148\n\n\nprovide the coverage in the employer\u2019s stead if the employer is not required to\n\nnotify anyone. Like the TPAs, the government must also be able to identify\n\nwomen whose employers object on religious grounds to providing contraceptive\n\ncoverage. Otherwise, the government will be unable to ensure that the participants\n\nand beneficiaries of the abstaining organization\u2019s health insurance plan receive the\n\ncoverage the law mandates. Without an effective way to identify any gaps, the\n\ngovernment would be hamstrung in its ability to accommodate employers\u2019\n\nsincerely held religious beliefs while also pursuing the interests that Congress\n\nintended to achieve in passing the Women\u2019s Health Amendment. 51\n\n\n\n\n       51\n          The Eighth Circuit suggested as a less restrictive alternative that the Departments\nrevise the regulations governing the accommodation to remove the requirement that when\nnotifying HHS of its religious objection, an eligible organization must identify its TPA and\nprovide the TPA\u2019s contact information. Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 944. The Eighth Circuit\nconcluded that this alternative would be \u201cless onerous\u201d than the current regulations yet \u201cpermit[]\nthe government to further its interests.\u201d Id. The Eighth Circuit relied on the fact that when the\nSupreme Court in Wheaton College created an accommodation, the Court required the college\nonly to notify HHS that it had an objection to providing coverage for contraceptive services, and\nnot to identify its TPA. Id.\n        We disagree with the Eighth Circuit that this alternative would serve HHS\u2019s interests\nequally well. As the Departments explained, the information required under the regulations is\n\u201cnecessary for the Departments to determine which entities are covered by the accommodation,\nto administer the accommodation, and to implement the policies in the . . . final regulations.\u201d\n79 Fed. Reg. at 51095. The Eighth Circuit has not explained why this is not so. Although the\nSupreme Court in Wheaton College did not require the college to identify its TPA to HHS to\nreceive an accommodation, the information was unnecessary because HHS already knew the\nidentity of the college\u2019s TPA. See Wheaton College, 134 S. Ct. at 2815 (Sotomayor, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201cHHS is aware of Wheaton\u2019s third-party administrator in this case.\u201d). Thus,\nWheaton College does not suggest that HHS could administer the mandate and accommodation\nin other cases without requiring an eligible organization to identify its TPA.\n\n\n                                                78\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 79 of 148\n\n\n       The dissent\u2019s proposal would create gaps or delays in contraceptive\n\ncoverage for plan participants and beneficiaries of eligible organizations that refuse\n\nto provide contraceptive coverage or tell anyone of their objection. Until the\n\ninsured, the TPA, or HHS learned of the silent omission of contraceptive coverage,\n\nthese women would be denied the contraceptive coverage to which they are\n\nirrefutably entitled. During this period, such eligible organizations would, in\n\neffect, be imposing their religious beliefs on women who wish to take advantage of\n\ntheir rights under federal law. These gaps in contraceptive coverage would\n\nfrustrate the government\u2019s interests. Because the dissent\u2019s proposal substantially\n\nburdens religious exercise and fails to meet the government\u2019s compelling interests,\n\nit cannot constitute a less restrictive alternative. 52\n\n\n\n       52\n          We pause to note that if we assume that the dissent\u2019s substantial burden analysis is\ncorrect\u2014meaning the only objective inquiry for determining whether there is a substantial\nburden is the magnitude of the penalty, see Dissent at 116\u2014then the dissent\u2019s proposal would\nsubstantially burden the plaintiffs\u2019 religious exercise. Presumably the dissent\u2019s position is that\nthe proposal presents a satisfactory alternative because it requires no \u201caffirmative participation\u201d\nby the objecting organization. Id. at 139. In fact, though, a TPA\u2019s obligation to provide\ncontraceptive coverage to a specific plan participant or beneficiary would remain tied to and\u2014in\nsome limited way\u2014\u201ctriggered\u201d by actions taken by the organization. An eligible organization is\nrequired to take two actions before its TPA becomes obligated to provide contraceptive coverage\nto a specific plan participant or beneficiary: the eligible organization must (1) contract with a\nspecific TPA to provide administrative services for its plan and (2) notify the TPA of the\nindividuals covered by its plan. Unless an eligible organization hired a specific TPA and\nprovided a list of its insureds, those insureds would never receive contraceptive coverage from\nthe TPA, even under the dissent\u2019s proposal. See Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 617 (explaining that\nunder a similar proposal when a university hired an unemployed person who \u201cby virtue of\nbecoming employed by [the organization], obtained contraception coverage for the first time,\u201d\nthe university\u2019s acts would \u201c\u2018trigger[]\u2019 the new employee\u2019s access to contraception\u201d).\n\n\n                                                79\n\f               Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 80 of 148\n\n\n       We hold that, even if the accommodation substantially burdens the\n\nplaintiffs\u2019 religious exercise, it does not violate RFRA because it is the least\n\nrestrictive means of furthering the government\u2019s compelling interests in the\n\ncontraceptive mandate.\n\n\n\n\nB.     EWTN\u2019S Free Exercise Claims\n\n       Plaintiff-appellant EWTN additionally claims that the contraceptive mandate\n\nviolates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court\u2019s\n\nSmith decision continues to apply to Free Exercise claims outside of the RFRA\n\ncontext; thus, neutral and generally applicable laws need not be justified by any\n\ncompelling interest even if those laws incidentally burden religious exercise.\n\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 885. A law is neutral unless \u201cthe object of a law is to infringe\n\nupon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation.\u201d Lukumi Babalu\n\n         The plaintiffs\u2019 religious objections to taking acts that \u201ctrigger[]\u201d contraceptive coverage,\n\u201cfacilitat[e]\u201d access to contraceptives, or render them \u201ccomplicit\u201d in a scheme that provides\naccess to contraceptives apply with equal force to the dissent\u2019s proposal. See EWTN Reply Br.\nat 5, 10-11; Catholic Charities and CENGI Appellee Br. at 10, 13, 20. Indeed, Catholic Charities\nand CENGI alleged in their complaint that their \u201creligious beliefs prohibit them from contracting\nwith [a] . . . third-party administrator that will, as a direct result, procure or provide the\nobjectionable coverage to [their] employees.\u201d Second Am. Compl. at 49, No. 1:12-cv-03489-\nWSD, Doc. 56. We acknowledge that the dissent\u2019s proposal does not require an eligible\norganization to tell HHS or its TPA that it has a religious objection to providing contraceptive\ncoverage. But the plaintiffs do not claim that the government imposes a substantial burden by\nforcing them to state that they have a religious objection. Rather, they claim a substantial burden\nbecause, they assert, their objection would cause their TPAs to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\n\n                                                 80\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 81 of 148\n\n\nAye, 508 U.S. at 533. And a law is generally applicable if it does not \u201cin a\n\nselective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief.\u201d\n\nId. at 543. \u201cA law failing to satisfy these requirements must be justified by a\n\ncompelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance that\n\ninterest.\u201d Id. at 531-32. But if a law indeed is neutral and generally applicable,\n\n\u201cthen rational basis scrutiny should be applied, requiring that the plaintiff show\n\nthat there is not a legitimate government interest or that the law is not rationally\n\nrelated to protect that interest.\u201d GeorgiaCarry.Org, Inc v. Georgia, 687 F.3d 1244,\n\n1255 n.21 (11th Cir. 2012).\n\n      Congress included the contraceptive mandate in the ACA to improve\n\nwomen\u2019s health and public health generally. There is no evidence whatsoever that\n\nthe mandate was enacted in an attempt to restrict religious exercise. To the\n\ncontrary, in implementing the contraceptive mandate the Departments have\n\nattempted to accommodate religious interests by granting exceptions for religious\n\nemployers and those organizations with religious objections to providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage. EWTN nonetheless argues that the mandate is non-neutral\n\nbecause the exemption and accommodation \u201cdiscriminate[] among religious\n\nobjectors, creating a three-tiered system.\u201d EWTN Appellant Br. at 54. But the\n\nregulations do not discriminate between religious denominations or infringe upon\n\nor restrict conduct because of its religious motivation. Rather, the procedures\n\n\n                                          81\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 82 of 148\n\n\ndistinguish among organizations on the basis of their tax status. Thus EWTN has\n\nfailed to show that the mandate is non-neutral.\n\n      EWTN also argues that the mandate is not generally applicable because the\n\nACA carves out small employers and grandfathered plans. For the same reasons\n\nwe rejected this argument as it pertains to the plaintiffs\u2019 RFRA claim, we reject it\n\nhere. Just as these exceptions do not undermine the government\u2019s compelling\n\ninterests justifying the contraceptive mandate, they do not prevent the mandate\n\nfrom being generally applicable as defined by Lukumi Babalu Aye. The exceptions\n\nfor small businesses and grandfathered plans apply equally to religious employers\n\nand non-religious employers. The exceptions in no way \u201cimpose burdens only on\n\nconduct motivated by religious belief.\u201d Lukumi Babalu Aye, 508 U.S. at 543.\n\n      Because the contraceptive mandate is neutral and generally applicable, to\n\ninvalidate it the plaintiff must show that is it not rationally related to a legitimate\n\ngovernment interest. See GeorgiaCarry.Org, 687 F.3d at 1255 n.21. EWTN\n\ncannot make such a showing. We have already concluded that the government has\n\na compelling (and therefore legitimate) interest in ensuring women have access to\n\ncontraceptives without cost sharing. See supra Part III.A.2.c.(i). The mandate is\n\nclearly rationally related to that interest and thus passes muster under the Free\n\nExercise Clause.\n\nC.    EWTN\u2019S Establishment Clause Claim\n\n\n                                           82\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 83 of 148\n\n\n      EWTN next argues that the contraceptive mandate violates the\n\nEstablishment Clause by discriminating among religious organizations.\n\nSpecifically, EWTN objects to the way the exemption and accommodation\n\ndistinguish between houses of worship and other types of religious organizations.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Supreme Court \u201chas long recognized that the government\n\nmay (and sometimes must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so\n\nwithout violating the Establishment Clause.\u201d Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals\n\nComm\u2019n of Fla., 480 U.S. 136, 144-145 (1987); see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472\n\nU.S. 38, 83 (1985) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (\u201cIt is disingenuous to look for a\n\npurely secular purpose when the manifest objective of a statute is to facilitate the\n\nfree exercise of religion by lifting a government-imposed burden. Instead, the\n\nCourt should simply acknowledge that the religious purpose of such a statute is\n\nlegitimated by the Free Exercise Clause.\u201d).\n\n      Like its claim based on the Free Exercise Clause, EWTN\u2019s Establishment\n\nClause claim fails because the accommodation does not distinguish among\n\nreligious groups on the basis of denomination, but rather on non-denominational\n\nattributes of an objecting organization. The accommodation relies on tax status,\n\nwhich is a permissible way to distinguish between organizations for the purpose of\n\ndrafting a religious exemption. \u201c[R]eligious employers, defined as in the cited\n\nregulation, have long enjoyed advantages (notably tax advantages) over other\n\n\n                                          83\n\f              Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 84 of 148\n\n\nentities, without these advantages being thought to violate the establishment\n\nclause.\u201d Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 443 (alteration in original and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n of N.Y., 397 U.S. 664,\n\n666, 672-73 (1970) (upholding a tax exemption on social welfare services that\n\nchurches performed and emphasizing that \u201c[t]he limits of permissible state\n\naccommodation to religion are by no means co-extensive with the noninterference\n\nmandated by the Free Exercise Clause.\u201d). We therefore reject EWTN\u2019s\n\nEstablishment Clause challenge.\n\nD.     EWTN\u2019S Free Speech Claim\n\n       Lastly, EWTN contends that the contraceptive mandate violates the Free\n\nSpeech Clause by compelling the organization to speak in order to avail itself of\n\nthe accommodation. 53 \u201c[T]he right of freedom of thought protected by the First\n\nAmendment against state action includes both the right to speak freely and the\n\nright to refrain from speaking at all.\u201d Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714\n\n(1977). In Wooley, the plaintiff objected to the slogan on New Hampshire\u2019s\n\nlicense plate: \u201cLive Free or Die.\u201d Id. at 707-08. He argued that by criminalizing\n\nhis efforts to cover up the slogan, the government forced him to express a message\n\ncontrary to his beliefs. The Supreme Court agreed that the license plate was forced\n\n       53\n          EWTN\u2019s Free Speech claim that the regulations compel silence is moot because the\nDepartment removed the non-interference provisions from the regulations in 2014. 79 Fed. Reg.\nat 51095.\n\n\n                                             84\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 85 of 148\n\n\nspeech. The Court then applied United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968), to\n\nhold that the government\u2019s stated interest in identifying passenger cars was not\n\nsufficiently compelling because passenger cars could be identified in other ways.\n\nId. at 715-17.\n\n      Assuming, arguendo, that the act of filling out Form 700 or notifying HHS\n\nimplicates the Free Speech Clause, this Court must ask whether the government\u2019s\n\n\u201ccountervailing interest is sufficiently compelling to justify\u201d the forced speech. Id.\n\nat 716. Our disposition of the plaintiffs\u2019 RFRA claims decides the issue. Because\n\nthe government has a compelling interest in ensuring that women have access to\n\ncontraceptive care without additional financial or administrative burden, it may\n\nforce the plaintiffs to speak simply to opt out of the mandate.\n\n                               IV.   CONCLUSION\n\n      We hold that the accommodation for the contraceptive mandate does not\n\nviolate RFRA because it does not substantially burden the plaintiffs\u2019 religious\n\nexercise and because the government\u2019s regulatory scheme is the least restrictive\n\nmeans of furthering its compelling interests. The regulations also do not violate\n\nthe Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech Clauses of the First\n\nAmendment. With regard to EWTN, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of\n\nsummary judgment to the government. With regard to CENGI and Catholic\n\nCharities, we vacate the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the\n\n\n                                          85\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 86 of 148\n\n\nplaintiffs\u2019 RFRA claim and remand to the district court with instructions to grant\n\nthe government\u2019s summary judgment motion.\n\n                                        ***\n\n      The question of whether the mandate and accommodation violate RFRA is\n\ncurrently before the Supreme Court in Zubik v. Burwell, Nos. 14- 1376 and 14-\n\n1377, and other consolidated cases. The Supreme Court will hold oral argument in\n\nthese cases on March 23, 2016. Because the Supreme Court will soon render a\n\ndecision addressing this issue, we believe it is appropriate to stay enforcement of\n\nthe mandate and accommodation against the plaintiffs until the Supreme Court\n\nissues a decision. Accordingly, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is\n\nenjoined from enforcing against EWTN, Catholic Charities, and CENGI the\n\nsubstantive requirements set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4) and from\n\nassessing fines or taking other enforcement action against EWTN, Catholic\n\nCharities, or CENGI for non-compliance.

I write\n\nseparately only to emphasize one point already made in the opinion. Plaintiffs\n\nseem to suggest, as a less restrictive means, that a religious employer be allowed to\n\nopt out without notifying anyone \u2013 without requiring even the de minimis notice to\n\nHealth and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) pursuant to the most recent alternative notice\n\nprovided for in the Regulations. However, the necessary consequence of such an\n\nautomatic opt-out would be the imposition of plaintiffs\u2019 religious beliefs on their\n\nfemale employees. In other words, if HHS were not able to identify which\n\nemployers have opted out, the employees of such employers would not receive\n\ncontraceptive coverage, at least until they happened to sua sponte discover that\n\ntheir employer had opted out, and until such employees happened to sua sponte\n\ndiscover their statutory entitlement. Only then would such employees be in\n\nposition to notify HHS, and begin their coverage. Such an automatically exempted\n\nemployer \u2013 notifying no one of its decision to opt out -- would at least temporarily\n\nimpose its own religious beliefs on its employees and deprive them of the coverage\n\nto which they are entitled under the statute and regulations. RFRA does not\n\nrequire that construction of the law. Rather, the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby\n\nrecognized that \u201cRFRA took the position that \u2018the compelling interest test as set\n\nforth in prior Federal rulings is a workable test for striking sensible balances\n\n                                          90\n\f             Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 91 of 148\n\n\nbetween religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.\u2019\u201d Burwell v.\n\nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 537 U.S. __, __, 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2785 (2014)(quoting\n\nfrom the express RFRA provision cited and quoted below). See also Cutter v.\n\nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 720, 125 S. Ct. 2113, 2121 (2005)(\u201cProperly applying\n\nRLUIPA, courts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested\n\naccommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries\u201d); id. at 722, 125 S.

We have no cause to believe that\n\nRLUIPA would not be applied in an appropriately balanced way.\u201d). Indeed, RFRA\n\ncontains an express provision which incorporates the prior Federal case law\n\ncontemplating a \u201csensible balance\u201d between religious liberty and competing\n\ngovernmental interests. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a72000bb(a)(5) (\u201cthe compelling interest test\n\nas set forth in prior Federal court rulings is a workable test for striking sensible\n\nbalances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.\u201d)\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 position \u2013 and its necessary consequence of the imposition of plaintiffs\u2019\n\nreligious views on others \u2013 clearly does not strike a \u201csensible balance\u201d between\n\nreligious liberty and the government\u2019s compelling interests in this case.

Doing so, these parties sincerely believe, would make them complicit in\n\nviolating the sanctity of human life. As I understand RFRA\u2019s plain meaning and\n\nthe controlling precedent, on full display in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\n\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2751, 189 L. Ed. 2d\n\n675 (2014), the answer should be straightforward. Under RFRA\u2019s demanding\n\nscrutiny, the Government cannot put religious believers to the choice of\n\nabandoning the commands of their faith or paying massive penalties unless it can\n\nshow that it has no other way of achieving a compelling interest. Just as in Hobby\n\nLobby, the Government has failed to make this showing. We are therefore bound\n\nto grant Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses the relief they seek.\n\n      \u201cGreat cases, like hard cases, make bad law.\u201d N. Sec. Co. v. United States,\n\n193 U.S. 197, 364, 24 S. Ct. 436, 468, 48 L. Ed. 679 (1904) (Holmes, J.,\n\ndissenting). In such circumstances, practical concerns \u201cexercise a kind of\n\nhydraulic pressure\u201d under which \u201ceven well settled principles of law will bend\u201d as\n\n                                         93\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 94 of 148\n\n\na result of \u201csome accident of immediate overwhelming interest.\u201d Id. at 364, 401,\n\n24 S. Ct. at 468. In the background of this litigation rage many competing\n\ninterests: What sort of legal regime would best preserve the American ideal of\n\nreligious liberty? How can we most effectively expand healthcare access? When\n\nand where should the interests of society trump those of the individual? Who will\n\nbe left holding the check for any newly minted social-welfare programs?\n\n      It is Congress\u2019s responsibility\u2014not the prerogative of courts\u2014to balance\n\nthese interests. And Congress made clear in RFRA how that balance is to be\n\nstruck: the freedom of religious exercise is to be jealously guarded by subjecting,\n\nacross the board, Congress\u2019s own actions to the most rigorous scrutiny.

Therefore, it is\n\ncritical to get the details right. And they are devilish indeed.\n\n                                               A.\n\n       Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (\u201cthe ACA\u201d),\n\ncovered employers, as part of their \u201c[s]hared responsibility\u201d for their employees\u2019\n\nhealthcare needs, are required to provide qualifying employees with health plans\n\nthat meet certain standards of \u201cminimum essential coverage.\u201d 26 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 4980H(a), 5000A(f)(2). Covered employers who fail to do so have to pay a\n\n\u201ctax\u201d1 of $100 per day for each affected employee. Id. \u00a7 4980D(a)\u2013(b). For\n\ncontinued \u201cnoncompliance\u201d after receiving a \u201cnotice of examination,\u201d employers\n\nare subject to a minimum penalty in the amount of $2,500 or $15,000 per affected\n\nemployee, depending on whether the violations \u201care more than de minimis.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00a7 4980D(b)(3).\n\n        Included in the ACA\u2019s definition of \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d are a\n\nnumber of preventive healthcare services. Relevant here is the requirement to\n\nprovide \u201cwith respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings \u2026\n\nas provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources\n\n1\n It is ironic that the ACA refers to an annual penalty for noncompliance of $36,500 per\nemployee as a \u201ctax.\u201d Cf.

To develop these\n\nguidelines, the Health Resources and Services Administration, a subpart of the\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, sought recommendations from the\n\nInstitute of Medicine, a division of the National Academies of Sciences. The\n\nInstitute of Medicine\u2019s recommendations2 were ultimately adopted in identical\n\nregulations promulgated by the Department of Treasury, the Department of Labor,\n\nand the Department of Health and Human Services. See 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-\n\n2713(a)(1)(iv); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv); 45 C.F.R.\n\n\u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv). 3 As a result, nonexempt employers are responsible for\n\nproviding their plan beneficiaries with coverage for \u201c[a]ll Food and Drug\n\nAdministration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and\n\npatient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s Preventive Services Guidelines, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs.,\n\n\n\n2\n  The Institute of Medicine\u2019s recommendations were laid out in its report Clinical Preventive\nServices for Women: Closing the Gaps, which was released on July 19, 2011. Like much of the\nACA, that report and the process used to generate it sparked significant controversy, prompting\npublic backlash and a dissent from one of the committee members.

Because I assume that the Government has a compelling interest in\nproviding the preventive services at issue in this case, I pass no judgment on the Institute of\nMedicine\u2019s report or its contents.\n3\n  As in the majority\u2019s opinion, for convenience when discussing the Departments\u2019 regulations I\nwill cite only those of the Department of Health and Human Services unless otherwise indicated.\n\n                                              96\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 97 of 148\n\n\nHealth Res. and Servs. Admin., http://hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ (last visited\n\nFeb. 10, 2016).\n\n       These regulations, collectively known as the \u201ccontraceptive mandate,\u201d did\n\nnot apply as enacted to several categories of employers. As is true generally of the\n\nACA, the contraceptive mandate does not cover employers with less than fifty full-\n\ntime employees. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4890H(a), (c)(2). These employers are thus\n\nunder no obligation to provide any health plan at all. Similarly, employers who\n\nmaintain \u201cgrandfathered health plans\u201d\u2014health plans that have not undergone\n\nspecified changes in the way they operated before March 23, 2010, see 75 Fed.\n\nReg. 34538, 34540\u201341\u2014are specifically exempted from the contraceptive\n\nmandate. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18011(a), (e). Other changes instituted by the ACA do\n\napply to grandfathered health plans, including extensions of dependent coverage\n\nfor adult children under the age of twenty-six and prohibitions on excessive\n\nwaiting periods, lifetime benefits limits, and rescissions of coverage. Id.\n\n\u00a7 18011(a)(4)(A)(i)\u2013(iv). The ACA does not include a sunset provision for\n\ngrandfathered health plans, which can continue their exempt status indefinitely. 4\n\n\n\n\n4\n The Government does predict that grandfathered health plans will be phased out over time as\npart of a planned \u201ctransition period\u201d designed \u201cto avoid undue disruption.\u201d It is ultimately an\nempirical question how many grandfathered plans are currently in effect and how many will\npersist in the future. The record developed in this case, as in so many other respects, betrays no\nanswer.\n\n                                                97\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 98 of 148\n\n\n       Conscious of the bind in which the contraceptive mandate would place\n\ncertain employers with religious objections, the Departments promulgated a series\n\nof further regulations to exempt these employers as well. 5 What emerged from\n\nseveral years of rulemaking were two distinct regimes for employers with religious\n\nobjections: one for \u201creligious employers\u201d and another for \u201celigible organizations.\u201d\n\n45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(a), (b). \u201cReligious employers\u201d are defined, by reference to\n\nthe Internal Revenue Code, as \u201cchurches, their integrated auxiliaries, and\n\nconventions or associations of churches\u201d and any \u201cnonprofit entit[ies]\u201d engaged in\n\n\u201cthe exclusively religious activities of any religious order.\u201d Id. \u00a7 147.131(a); 26\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii). 6 Employers who object to the contraceptive\n\nmandate but are not considered \u201creligious employers\u201d can still qualify as \u201celigible\n\norganizations\u201d if they meet the following requirements:\n\n       (1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of\n       any contraceptive items or services required to be covered under\n       \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) on account of religious objections.\n\n\n5\n  The development of the current iteration of the contraceptive mandate\u2014which has changed\nmultiple times since these suits was first brought, though not in ways that materially alter the\nRFRA inquiry\u2014has been largely defined by how to treat religiously objecting employers,\ninspiring hundreds of thousands of comments from interested stakeholders.

An eligible organization is an organization that meets the\ncriteria of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.\n         (1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any\n         contraceptive items or services required to be covered under \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv)\n         on account of religious objections.\n         (2)      (i) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and\n         holds itself out as a religious organization; or\n                  (ii) The organization is organized and operates as a closely held for-profit\n         entity, as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and the organization's highest\n         governing body (such as its board of directors, board of trustees, or owners, if\n         managed directly by its owners) has adopted a resolution or similar action, under\n         the organization's applicable rules of governance and consistent with state law,\n         establishing that it objects to covering some or all of the contraceptive services on\n         account of the owners' sincerely held religious beliefs.\n         (3) The organization must self-certify in the form and manner specified by the\n         Secretary of Labor or provide notice to the Secretary of Health and Human\n         Services as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

The self-certification or notice must be executed by a person\n\n                                               99\n\f            Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 100 of 148\n\n\n      Religious employers\u2019 and eligible organizations\u2019 bids to remove themselves\n\nfrom the contraceptive mandate fare differently. Religious employers are simply\n\nexempt; they are not required to participate, directly or indirectly, in providing\n\naccess to contraceptive coverage to their female employees and beneficiaries,\n\nwhether or not these women share their employers\u2019 beliefs. 45 C.F.R.\n\n\u00a7 147.131(a). Eligible organizations, in contrast, are required to affirmatively opt\n\nout of providing contraceptive coverage, if they wish to do so, by complying with a\n\nfurther series of regulations known as \u201cthe accommodation.\u201d Id. \u00a7 147.131(c).\n\n      How the accommodation functions turns on the eligible organization\u2019s type\n\nof health plan. Broadly speaking, employer-sponsored health plans come in two\n\ntypes: insured plans and self-insured plans. Under an insured plan, the employer\n\nenters into a contract with an insurer. The insurer, in exchange for up-front\n\npremiums, becomes responsible for administering the plan and paying out claims.\n\nUnder a self-insured plan, the employer remains responsible for paying its\n\nemployees\u2019 claims itself; in essence, the employer serves as its own insurer. For\n\nemployers with self-insured plans, it is a common practice to contract with a third-\n\nparty administrator\u2014which may also be in the business of providing insured\n\nplans\u2014to administer the self-insured plan, though the employer continues to bear\n\n\n      authorized to make the certification or notice on behalf of the organization, and\n      must be maintained in a manner consistent with the record retention requirements\n      under section 107 of ERISA.\n\n                                             100\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 101 of 148\n\n\nthe cost of paying claims. 8 Eligible organizations that maintain their own self-\n\ninsured plans without a third-party administrator are, like religious employers,\n\nexempt from the contraceptive mandate altogether.\n\n       Eligible organizations may, in line with the regulations currently in force,\n\navail themselves of the accommodation in one of two ways. 9 The first option is to\n\nsend a \u201cself-certification\u201d form, Employee Benefits Security Administration Form\n\n700 (\u201cForm 700\u201d), to the eligible organization\u2019s insurer, if the organization has an\n\ninsured plan, or to the organization\u2019s third-party administrator, if the organization\n\nhas a self-insured plan. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(b)(3), (c)(1). Form 700 requires\n\neligible organizations to identify themselves as qualifying for the accommodation;\n\nlist the name, title, and contact information of the person authorized to make that\n\ncertification; and sign and date the form. 10 The second option is to send to the\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services less-formal notice of the eligible\n\norganization\u2019s intent to opt out. That notice must include \u201cthe name of the eligible\n\norganization and the basis on which it qualifies for an accommodation,\u201d notice of\n\n8\n  For example, Eternal Word Television Network has a self-insured health plan for which Blue\nCross Blue Shield of Alabama serves as third-party administrator. The Dioceses collectively\nmaintain three self-insured health plans, for all of which Meritain Health serves as third-party\nadministrator. Though Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama and Meritain Health may separately\noffer insured plans, they are not responsible for paying the claims of Eternal Word Television\nNetwork\u2019s and the Dioceses\u2019 beneficiaries.\n9\n  In the pre\u2013Wheaton College iteration of the contraceptive mandate, there was only one way to\nopt out under the accommodation: submitting Employee Benefits Security Administration Form\n700 to the relevant insurer or third-party administrator. See infra n.11.\n10\n   A copy of Form 700 is appended to the majority\u2019s opinion.\n\n                                              101\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 102 of 148\n\n\nits objection to the contraceptive mandate \u201cbased on [the eligible organization\u2019s]\n\nsincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d the name and type of the eligible organization\u2019s\n\nhealth plan, and the identity and contact information of the eligible organization\u2019s\n\ninsurer or third-party administrator. Id. \u00a7 147.131(c)(1)(ii).\n\n      Under the first option provided for in the accommodation, whereby Form\n\n700 is sent directly to an eligible organization\u2019s insurer or third-party\n\nadministrator, the recipient insurer or third-party administrator becomes\n\nresponsible for establishing separate contraceptive coverage for the eligible\n\norganization\u2019s female employees and plan beneficiaries. The insurer or third-party\n\nadministrator must, upon receipt of the eligible organization\u2019s Form 700,\n\n\u201c[e]xpressly exclude contraceptive coverage\u201d from the eligible organization\u2019s plan\n\nand \u201c[p]rovide separate payments for any contraceptive services required to be\n\ncovered\u201d pursuant to the contraceptive mandate. Id. \u00a7 147.131(c)(2)(i)(A)\u2013(B).\n\nAmong other requirements, the insurer or third-party administrator must also\n\n\u201csegregate premium revenue \u2026 from the monies used to provide payments for\n\ncontraceptive services\u201d and is forbidden from \u201cimpos[ing] any cost-sharing\n\nrequirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), or impos[ing]\n\nany premium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on\n\nthe eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or\n\nbeneficiaries.\u201d Id. \u00a7 147.131(c)(2)(ii). And the insurer or third-party administrator\n\n                                          102\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 103 of 148\n\n\nmust provide to plan members and beneficiaries written notice outlining how the\n\naccommodation works and \u201cspecify[ing] that the eligible organization does not\n\nadminister or fund contraceptive benefits.\u201d See id. \u00a7 147.131(d) (proposing\n\nsuggested language for this notice).\n\n       Under the second option provided for in the accommodation, whereby less-\n\nformal notice is sent instead to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the\n\nSecretary is then tasked with alerting the eligible organization\u2019s insurer or third-\n\nparty administrator. The Department of Health and Human Services will \u201csend a\n\nseparate notification\u201d to the insurer relaying that the eligible organization\u2019s notice\n\nwas received and \u201cdescribing the [insurer\u2019s or third-party administrator\u2019s]\n\nobligations.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(c)(1)(ii). The insurer\u2019s or third-party\n\nadministrator\u2019s obligations to provide separate coverage pursuant to the\n\ncontraceptive mandate are identical whether it is alerted to the eligible\n\norganization\u2019s objections directly by Form 700 or indirectly by the Government. 11\n\n\n\n\n11\n   The reason that eligible organizations are given two similar-seeming options for opting out of\nthe contraceptive mandate stems from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Wheaton College v.\nBurwell, 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2806, 189 L. Ed. 2d 856 (2014). In Wheaton College, the\nSupreme Court enjoined enforcement of the contraceptive mandate against an eligible\norganization that sent written notice to the Government but objected, based on the organization\u2019s\nreligious beliefs, to sending Form 700 to its insurer and third-party administrator. Id. at __, 134\nS. Ct. 2807. The Court did not address the situation presented here where an eligible\norganization objects, on religious grounds, both to completing Form 700 and to providing less-\nformal notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\n                                               103\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 104 of 148\n\n\n       The regulations require eligible organizations to affirmatively opt out of the\n\ncontraceptive mandate because doing so enables the Government to require the\n\neligible organizations\u2019 insurers and third-party administrators to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage. For eligible organizations with insured plans,12 opting out\n\nunder the accommodation notifies the insurers of their obligations to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(c)(2)(i). For eligible organizations\n\nwith self-insured plans that contract with a third-party administrator, 13 opting out\n\nof the contraceptive mandate under the accommodation makes the third-party\n\nadministrator \u201cthe plan administrator\u201d for purposes of the Employee Retirement\n\nIncome Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq., under regulations\n\npromulgated by the Department of Labor. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-16(b). If the\n\neligible organization submits Form 700, that submission \u201cshall be treated as a\n\ndesignation of the third party administrator as the plan administrator.\u201d Id. If the\n\neligible organization instead provides less-formal notice to the Secretary of Health\n\nand Human Services, \u201cthe Department of Labor, working with the Department of\n\nHealth and Human Services, shall \u2026 provide notification \u2026 that such third party\n\nadministrator shall be the plan administrator\u201d under ERISA. Id. Once a third-\n\nparty administrator becomes a \u201cplan administrator\u201d under ERISA, the relevant\n12\n   Because this case does not involve eligible organizations with insured plans, I pass no\njudgment on the accommodation in that context.\n13\n   As mentioned above, eligible organizations that administer their own self-insured plans are not\nsubject to the contraceptive mandate under the regulations.\n\n                                               104\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 105 of 148\n\n\nadministrative agencies gain the regulatory authority to require the third-party\n\nadministrator to provide contraceptive coverage. 14 Id. \u00a7 2510.3-16(c).\n\n       The Government\u2019s regulatory authority to require third-party administrators\n\nof self-insured plans to provide contraceptive coverage is limited. A third-party\n\nadministrator may always decline to \u201cagree[] to enter into or remain in a\n\ncontractual relationship with the eligible organization.\u201d15 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-\n\n2713A(b)(2). Only if it accepts the terms of the regulations does a third-party\n\nadministrator incur the obligation \u201cto provide or arrange payments for\n\ncontraceptive services.\u201d Id. \u00a7 54.9815-2713A(d). If a third-party administrator\n\nagrees to provide the contraceptive coverage, the costs it incurs to do so will be\n\nreimbursed from \u201cFederally-facilitated Exchange\u201d user fees, which are fees\n\n\n\n\n14\n   Under ERISA, a third-party administrator that is neither the \u201cplan sponsor\u201d nor specifically\ndesignated as such can be considered the \u201cplan administrator\u201d only \u201cas the Secretary [of Labor]\nmay by regulation prescribe.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(16)(A)(iii). The Government contends that, as\ncurrently written, the ACA\u2019s implementing regulations also allow it to independently enforce the\ncontraceptive mandate against third-party administrators of self-insured plans without any further\naction from the eligible organization. The truth of this contention is far from certain. See ante at\n44\u201345 & nn.30\u201331; Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., 801 F.3d\n927, 935 n.8 (8th Cir. 2015) (collecting cases contrary to the Government\u2019s position). In any\nevent, I decline to pass judgment on this question because its resolution is unnecessary to decide\nthis case.\n15\n   If a third-party administrator declines to provide contraceptive coverage, eligible organizations\nwith self-insured plans must select another willing third-party administrator, administer its own\nhealth plan, or become subject to the monetary penalties discussed above.\n\n                                                105\n\f             Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 106 of 148\n\n\nimposed on insurers offering health plans on exchanges established by the\n\nGovernment under the ACA. 16 See 80 Fed. Reg. at 41328.\n\n                                               B.\n\n       Inextricably intertwined with these evolving regulations is a series of cases\n\nchallenging the various iterations of the contraceptive mandate under the Religious\n\nFreedom Restoration Act (\u201cRFRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb et seq. RFRA provides\n\nthat the federal government17 \u201cmay substantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of\n\nreligion\u201d only if it does so \u201cin furtherance of a compelling governmental interest\u201d\n\nand the burden it imposes is \u201cthe least restrictive means of furthering that\n\ncompelling governmental interest.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2000bb-1(b).\n\n       In 1993, Congress enacted RFRA in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s path-\n\nbreaking approach to the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause taken in\n\nEmployment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494\n\n\n16\n   Specifically, the regulations contemplate \u201cadjustments\u201d to the third-party administrator\u2019s own\nuser fees, if the third-party administrator also offers health plans on a Federally-facilitated\nExchange, or the user fees of another participating insurer that the third-party administrator\ncontracts with to receive reimbursement. See 80 Fed. Reg. at 41328. Third-party administrators\nare to be reimbursed for the \u201ctotal dollar amount of the payments for contraceptive services\u201d and\nan \u201callowance for administrative costs and margin\u201d of \u201cno less than 10 percent\u201d for the amount\nspent on contraceptive services. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 156.50(d)(3)(i), (ii). The Government does not\naddress how reimbursement will be made, if at all, should these user fees prove insufficient. Cf.\nKing v. Burwell, 576 U.S. __, __, 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2487, 192 L. Ed. 2d 483 (2015) (noting that\nthe ACA contemplates that each state will create its own exchange).\n17\n   RFRA originally applied to the actions of state governments as well, but the Supreme Court\nheld that extending RFRA\u2019s mandate to the states exceeded Congress\u2019s powers under \u00a7 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment. City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 117 S. Ct. 2157, 138 L.

Ed. 2d 876 (1990) (holding that neutral laws of\n\ngeneral applicability do not burden free exercise whether or not they are supported\n\nby a compelling interest). Congress declared that the standard of strict scrutiny\n\nRFRA imposes creates \u201ca workable test for striking sensible balances between\n\nreligious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.\u201d 42 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 2000bb(a)(5). RFRA\u2019s stated purposes included \u201crestor[ing] the compelling\n\ninterest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin\n\nv. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972)\u201d and \u201cprovid[ing] a claim or defense to persons\n\nwhose religious exercise is substantially burdened by government.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00a7 2000bb(b)(1), (2). To the extent that it imposes a least-restrictive-means\n\nrequirement not present in Sherbert or Yoder, however, RFRA \u201cprovide[s] even\n\nbroader protection for religious liberty than was available under those decisions.\u201d\n\nBurwell v.

Ed. 2d 675 (2014).\n\n        Following the enactment of the ACA and the promulgation of the\n\ncontraceptive mandate, a diverse set of employers brought suit to avoid providing\n\nwhat they viewed as objectionable contraceptive coverage. 18 The Supreme Court\n\n\n18\n  Though the bulk of this litigation has been brought under RFRA, at least one non-religious\nemployer has challenged the contraceptive mandate under the Fifth Amendment. See March for\nLife v. Burwell, No. 14-cv-1149(RJL), 2015 WL 5139099 (D.D.C. Aug. 31, 2015) (concluding\nthat the contraceptive mandate violates equal-protection principles because it lacks a rational\nbasis for discriminating between religious and non-religious objectors).

Hobby Lobby Stores,\n\nInc., 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2751, 189 L. Ed. 2d 675 (2014).19 The Court held in\n\nHobby Lobby that enforcing the contraceptive mandate against a closely held for-\n\nprofit company that had religious objections to providing contraceptive coverage\n\nwould violate RFRA. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2785. The Court began by\n\ndetermining that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, RFRA covers certain for-\n\nprofit companies because the term \u201cperson\u201d was not limited only to natural\n\npersons. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2767\u201375. Moving to RFRA\u2019s threshold inquiry,\n\nthe Court \u201cha[d] little trouble concluding\u201d that the contraceptive mandate imposes\n\na substantial burden on religious exercise. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2775. The\n\nHobby Lobby plaintiffs had an uncontested \u201csincere religious belief that life begins\n\nat conception\u201d and understood that their belief would be violated if they were\n\nrequired to \u201cprovid[e] health insurance that covers methods of birth control\u201d that\n\n\u201cmay result in the destruction of an embryo.\u201d Id. By forcing them to choose\n\nbetween violating their deeply held convictions and \u201cpay[ing] an enormous sum of\n\nmoney,\u201d the contraceptive mandate \u201cclearly imposes a substantial burden on those\n\nbeliefs.\u201d Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2779.\n\ninvolves only employers with religious objections and is resolved by RFRA\u2019s clear dictates, I\ndecline to address the constitutional propriety of applying the contraceptive mandate to non-\nreligious objectors.\n19\n   Justice Alito wrote the majority opinion in Hobby Lobby, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and\nJustices Scalia and Thomas. Justice Kennedy concurred. Justice Ginsburg dissented, joined in\nfull by Justice Sotomayor and in relevant part by Justices Breyer and Kagan.\n\n                                              108\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 109 of 148\n\n\n      The Court specifically and emphatically rejected any argument that the\n\nparticipation of religious objectors, by paying for contraceptive coverage, is\n\n\u201csimply too attenuated\u201d from the objectionable outcome, the destruction of\n\nembryos, to constitute a burden on religious exercise. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2777.\n\nSuch an argument, which \u201cimplicates a difficult and important question of religion\n\nand moral philosophy,\u201d would \u201cin effect tell the plaintiffs that their beliefs are\n\nflawed\u201d\u2014and defining the scope of religious belief is a dangerous line-drawing\n\ninquiry \u201cfederal courts have no business addressing.\u201d See id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at\n\n2778 (\u201cInstead, our \u2018narrow function \u2026 in this context is to determine\u2019 whether the\n\nline drawn reflects \u2018an honest conviction\u2019\u201d (quoting Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind.\n\nEmp\u2019t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 716, 101 S. Ct. 1425, 1431, 67 L. Ed. 2d 624\n\n(1981))). Moreover, the Court noted, if the contraceptive mandate\u2019s burden were\n\nnot substantial, it would \u201cbe hard to understand\u201d and \u201cnot easy to square\u201d with the\n\nexemptions carved out for qualifying \u201creligious employers\u201d facing \u201cexactly the\n\nsame\u201d burden. Id. at __ n.33, 134 S. Ct. at 2777 n.33.\n\n      The Court next declined to address whether the contraceptive mandate\n\nfurthered a compelling interest because, even if it did, the contraceptive mandate\n\nwas not the least restrictive means of doing so. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2779\u201380.\n\nThe Court identified several less-restrictive alternatives that the Government could\n\nhave used to achieve the assumed compelling interest, holding that the\n\n                                          109\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 110 of 148\n\n\ncontraceptive mandate foundered under RFRA\u2019s \u201cexceptionally demanding\u201d\n\nstandard. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2780. The \u201cmost straightforward\u201d alternative\n\n\u201cwould be for the Government to assume the cost\u201d of contraceptive coverage. Id.\n\nat __, 134 S. Ct. at 2780. In response to the Government\u2019s contrary position, the\n\nCourt observed that \u201cit is hard to understand [the] argument that [the Government]\n\ncannot be required under RFRA to pay anything\u201d for \u201ca Government interest of the\n\nhighest order.\u201d Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2781.20 The Court also strongly suggested\n\nthat the Government\u2019s direct provision of contraceptive coverage would still be a\n\nless-restrictive alternative if the Government were required to create \u201can entirely\n\nnew program\u201d rather than \u201cmodif[y] an existing program (which RFRA surely\n\nallows).\u201d Id.\n\n\n       In its analysis the Court decided it \u201cneed not rely on the option of a new,\n\ngovernment-funded program\u201d to identify a less-restrictive alternative because the\n\nregulations already provided one: the then-existing version of the accommodation\n\nfor employers with religious objections. Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2781\u201382. The for-\n20\n   Requiring the Government to, at times, spend additional monies to avoid imposing substantial\nburdens on the free exercise of religious objectors would accord with RFRA\u2019s sister statute, the\nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\u201cRLUIPA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000cc,\n2000cc-1. See id. \u00a7 2000cc-3(c) (\u201c[T]his chapter may require a government to incur expenses in\nits own operations to avoid imposing a substantial burden on religious exercise.\u201d).\nCongress enacted RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending and Commerce Clauses after the Supreme\nCourt in City of Boerne held that RFRA could not be applied to the actions of state governments\nunder \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See supra note 17. The standard of RLUIPA mirrors\nthat of RFRA and applies in two contexts: land-use regulation and the religious exercise of\ninstitutionalized persons.\n\n                                              110\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 111 of 148\n\n\nprofit Hobby Lobby plaintiffs did not object to the accommodation itself, so\n\ngranting them the option for a third party to provide their female employees\u2019\n\ncontraceptive coverage \u201cserves [the Government\u2019s] stated interests equally well.\u201d\n\nId. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2781\u201382. Though derided as \u201c\u2018noncommittal\u2019\u201d by the\n\ndissent for doing so, the Court expressly declined to rule on \u201cwhether an approach\n\nof this type complies with RFRA for purposes of all religious claims.\u201d Id. at __ &\n\nn.40, 134 S. Ct. at 2782 & n.40.\n\n       Three days after it decided Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court again ruled on\n\nthe contraceptive mandate in Wheaton College v. Burwell, 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct.\n\n2806, 189 L. Ed. 2d 856 (2014). 21 In Wheaton College, the Court issued an order\n\nenjoining the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \u201cpending final disposition\n\nof appellate review,\u201d from enforcing the contraceptive mandate against an\n\nemployer that submits \u201cin writing that it is a non-profit organization that holds\n\nitself out as religious and has religious objections to providing coverage for\n\ncontraceptive services.\u201d Id. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2807. The parties disputed whether\n\nthe obligation to provide contraceptive coverage was \u201cdependent\u201d on submitting\n\nForm 700 to an insurer or third-party administrator. Id. The Court concluded in its\n\ntwo-page order that, because notice had already been given to the Government, the\n\n21\n  Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Alito, Thomas, Kennedy, and Breyer joined the Court\u2019s\ndecision in Wheaton College. Justice Scalia concurred without issuing a separate opinion.\nJustice Sotomayor dissented, joined by Justices Ginsburg and Kagan.\n\n                                             111\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 112 of 148\n\n\nGovernment \u201crelying on this notice\u201d could \u201cfacilitate the provision of full\n\ncontraceptive coverage under the [ACA].\u201d Id. The Court ended its order by noting\n\nthat it \u201cshould not be construed as an expression of the Court\u2019s views on the\n\nmerits.\u201d Id.\n\n       After Hobby Lobby and Wheaton College, the federal courts were inundated\n\nwith cases posing the question presented here: whether RFRA provides relief to\n\nemployers with religious objections to the accommodation itself. Our sister\n\ncircuits are deeply divided. Like the majority, most circuits have concluded that,\n\nthough RFRA requires deference to adherents\u2019 sincerely held religious beliefs, \u201can\n\nobjective inquiry\u201d to determine whether a law presents a substantial burden reveals\n\nthat the accommodation does not impose a substantial burden on religious\n\nexercise. 22 Ante at 33\u201341; see also Catholic Health Care Sys. v.

The agencies ultimately determined that the Government had a compelling\n\ninterest in providing women with cost-free access to a wide range of contraceptive\n\nservices. In accordance with that determination, the agencies, through threat of\n\nlarge monetary penalties, mandated that certain employers must provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage to their female employees. Though Congress had already\n\nexempted some types of employers\u2014those with fewer than fifty employees and\n\nthose with grandfathered health plans\u2014the agencies decided that another group of\n\n\n\n\n                                        114\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 115 of 148\n\n\nemployers should be exempt too: churches and church-affiliated organizations, as\n\ndefined by already-existing definitions in the Internal Revenue Code.\n\n      The agencies exempted churches and church-affiliated organizations from\n\nthe contraceptive mandate because the agencies understood that the contraceptive\n\nmandate would impose a substantial burden on many of these organizations\u2019\n\nreligious exercise. As a result, churches and church-affiliated organizations may\n\nchoose what contraceptive coverage, if any, will be available in their female\n\nemployees\u2019 health plans. No such exemption, however, was thought necessary for\n\nother organizations with similar religious objections, whether for-profit or\n\nnonprofit. After much public outcry and litigation, the agencies changed course.\n\nAt first, the agencies began offering an exemption-like option to certain nonprofits\n\nwith religious objections. In response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hobby\n\nLobby, the agencies extended the same to for-profit religious objectors as well.\n\n\n      But the exemption-like option\u2014the accommodation\u2014did not truly exempt\n\nqualifying employers. Rather, it required qualifying employers to affirmatively opt\n\nout of providing contraceptive coverage, shifting the obligation to provide the\n\nrequired contraceptive coverage to the employers\u2019 insurer or third-party\n\nadministrator. Originally, qualifying employers had to opt out by sending Form\n\n700 to the insurer or third-party administrator responsible for the employers\u2019 health\n\nplans, alerting the insurer or third-party administrator to its new obligations. After\n\n                                         115\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 116 of 148\n\n\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s order in Wheaton College, the agencies also made available\n\nan option of providing less-formal notice to the Secretary of Health and Human\n\nServices. Under this option, the notice is rerouted to the insurer or third-party\n\nadministrator, in lieu of the employer submitting Form 700 directly.\n\n      For employers that run self-insured health plans in conjunction with a third-\n\nparty administrator and are eligible for the accommodation, opting out of the\n\ncontraceptive mandate has the effect of designating the employers\u2019 third-party\n\nadministrators as \u201cplan administrators\u201d under ERISA. Once so designated, the\n\nagencies can require a third-party administrator to provide contraceptive coverage.\n\nAbsent any affirmative action from the employer, third-party administrators remain\n\noutside of ERISA\u2019s reach. Likewise outside of ERISA\u2019s reach, and thus\n\neffectively exempt from the contraceptive mandate, are employers that run self-\n\ninsured health plans without a third-party administrator.\n\n      As a result, there are four discrete options facing employers like Eternal\n\nWord Television Network and the Dioceses, which operate self-insured plans and\n\ndo not meet the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s definition for churches or church-\n\naffiliated organizations but nonetheless have religious objections to providing\n\ncontraceptive coverage. First, these employers can provide the objectionable\n\ncoverage in violation of their beliefs. Second, these employers can comply with\n\nthe accommodation and affirmatively opt out of the contraceptive mandate,\n\n                                          116\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 117 of 148\n\n\nshifting the obligation to provide the required coverage to their insurer or third-\n\nparty administrator, also in violation of their beliefs. Third, these employers can\n\ndrop their third-party administrators and assume the costs and responsibilities of\n\nrunning their own health plans. Fourth, these employers can do nothing and\n\nthereby become liable for annual fines of thousands of dollars per employee.\n\n      This case requires two determinations. First, does the regulatory scheme\n\ndiscussed above impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of Eternal\n\nWord Television Network and the Dioceses, which believe that opting out under\n\nthe accommodation would violate the sanctity of human life? If so, does the\n\nregulatory scheme nonetheless survive RFRA\u2019s demanding standard of strict\n\nscrutiny? Because I conclude that the answers to these questions are yes and no,\n\nwhile the majority says no and yes, I dissent.\n\n                                         II.\n\n       The threshold inquiry under RFRA requires a showing that the Government\n\nhas \u201csubstantially burden[ed]\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cexercise of religion.\u201d 42 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 2000bb-1. First, a RFRA plaintiff must identify religious exercise that the\n\nGovernment is burdening. The allegedly burdened exercise \u201cmust be sincerely\n\nbased on a religious belief and not some other motivation.\u201d Holt v. Hobbs, 574\n\n\n\n\n                                         117\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 118 of 148\n\n\nU.S. __, __, 135 S. Ct. 853, 862, 190 L. Ed. 2d 747 (2015).23 When determining\n\nthe content of a religious belief, including how and to what extent its attendant\n\nexercise may be burdened, we defer to the plaintiff\u2019s understanding of what his\n\nfaith requires of him because \u201c[c]ourts are not arbiters of scriptural interpretation.\u201d\n\nThomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp\u2019t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 716, 101 S. Ct. 1425,\n\n1431, 67 L. Ed. 2d 624 (1981). So long as a religious adherent has drawn a line\n\nbased on \u201can honest conviction,\u201d \u201cit is not for us to say that the line he drew was\n\nan unreasonable one.\u201d Id. at 715\u201316, 101 S. Ct. at 1430\u201331.\n\n       Next, we must determine whether, as an objective matter, the identified\n\nburden on religious exercise is substantial. The existence of a substantial burden,\n\nwhich \u201ccan result from pressure that tends to force adherents to forego religious\n\nprecepts or from pressure that mandates religious conduct,\u201d turns on whether the\n\nGovernment\u2019s actions coerce a religious adherent to affirmatively violate his\n\nbeliefs. Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside, 366 F.3d 1214, 1227 (11th\n\nCir. 2004). To be substantial, a burden must be \u201cakin to significant pressure which\n\ndirectly coerces the religious adherent to conform his or her behavior accordingly\u201d\n\nand must be more than \u201can inconvenience on religious exercise.\u201d Id. For example,\n\na zoning ordinance that forces members of an Orthodox Jewish congregation to\n\n23\n  Though Hobbs involved a claim brought under RLUIPA rather than RFRA, both statutes\nimpose the same standard for substantial burdens of religious exercise. See, e.g., Midrash\nSephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside, 366 F.3d 1214, 1227 (11th Cir. 2004).\n\n                                              118\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 119 of 148\n\n\n\u201cwalk[] a few extra blocks\u201d to attend services on the Sabbath is not a substantial\n\nburden when there is no \u201creligious significance\u201d as to a particular synagogue site,\n\nthough \u201cwalking may be burdensome.\u201d Id. at 1221, 1227\u201328. In contrast, if the\n\nGovernment puts a religious adherent to the \u201cchoice\u201d of incurring a \u201cserious\u201d\n\npenalty or \u201c\u2018engag[ing] in conduct that seriously violates [his] religious beliefs,\u2019\u201d\n\nthen the Government \u201csubstantially burdens his religious exercise.\u201d See Hobbs,\n\n574 U.S. at __, 135 S. Ct. at 862 (quoting Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573\n\nU.S. __, __, 134 S. Ct. 2751, 2775, 189 L. Ed. 2d 675 (2014) (second alteration in\n\nthe original)). And a burden is no less substantial if the burdened party \u201cis able to\n\nengage in other forms of religious exercise,\u201d if the exercise in question is not\n\n\u201ccompelled\u201d by the burdened party\u2019s religion, or if the burdened party\u2019s belief is\n\n\u201cidiosyncratic.\u201d Id. at __, 135 S. Ct. 862.\n\n      Here, it is overwhelmingly clear that the contraceptive mandate imposes on\n\nEternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses a burden that the\n\naccommodation does not alleviate. Eternal Word Television Network and the\n\nDioceses assert a religious belief\u2014which the Government does not contest is\n\nsincerely held\u2014that both complying with the contraceptive mandate and opting\n\nout under the accommodation, which requires the third-party administrators of\n\ntheir health plans to provide contraceptive coverage, would make them complicit\n\nin violating the sanctity of human life. The Government burdens that belief by\n\n                                         119\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 120 of 148\n\n\nrequiring Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses to affirmatively\n\nparticipate in its regulatory scheme.\n\n       And it is equally clear that the burden imposed is substantial. The\n\nGovernment puts Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses to the\n\n\u201cchoice\u201d of either (1) complying with the contraceptive mandate, to which they\n\nobject on religious grounds; (2) opting out under the accommodation, to which\n\nthey also object on religious grounds; (3) dropping the third-party administrators of\n\ntheir health plans and becoming de facto insurance companies, incurring\n\nsubstantial costs and diverting the focus of their religiously motivated operations;\n\nor (4) incurring millions of dollars in penalties annually. 24 Besides providing yet\n\nanother way for the eligible organizations to violate their religious beliefs, the\n\naccommodation does nothing to change the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Hobby\n\nLobby that the contraceptive mandate \u201cclearly imposes a substantial burden on\n\nthose beliefs.\u201d 573 U.S. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2779. Eternal Word Television\n\nNetwork and the Dioceses must either violate their beliefs or incur massive\n\n\n\n24\n  Should it fail to comply with the contraceptive mandate, Eternal Word Television Network\nwould face annual penalties of up to $12,775,000 for its 350 full-time employees.

On its face, such a \u201cchoice\u201d is not a choice at all. Rather, it is a\n\nsubstantial burden on religious exercise.\n\n      As I understand it, this straightforward application of RFRA\u2019s substantial-\n\nburden test should end the matter. The majority thinks otherwise, reaching the\n\nwrong conclusion for two reasons. First, the majority fails to give proper\n\ndeference to Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses\u2019 sincerely held\n\nreligious beliefs. Second, the majority mischaracterizes how the contraceptive\n\nmandate works by understating the critical role that the accommodation forces\n\nemployers to play in providing contraceptive coverage.\n\n      Before explaining why the majority fails to give RFRA its proper meaning,\n\nit is helpful to clarify how our understandings of RFRA\u2019s inquiry differ. Exactly\n\nwhere we differ is highlighted below:\n\n\n\n\n                                         121\n\f            Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 122 of 148\n\n\n       THE MAJORITY\u2019S VIEW OF RFRA                THE CORRECT VIEW OF RFRA\nStep 1: Does the plaintiff hold a sincere Step 1: Does the plaintiff hold a sincere\nreligious belief?                         religious belief?\n      \u2014Objective determination                    \u2014Objective determination\n\nWhat are the contents of that belief?

The majority begins by correctly observing that\n\nRFRA\u2019s substantial-burden inquiry \u201cinvolves both subjective and objective\n\ndimensions.\u201d Ante at 34. The majority continues on, also correctly, to observe that\n\n\u201ccourts must accept a religious adherent\u2019s assertion that his religious beliefs\n\nrequire him to take or abstain from taking a specified action.\u201d Id. The majority\n\nfalters, however, when it concludes that \u201cit is for the courts to determine\n\nobjectively . . . whether the government has, in fact, put plaintiffs to the choice of\n\nviolating their religious beliefs . . . or incurring a substantial penalty.\u201d Id. at 36\u2013\n\n37.\n\n      Contrary to the majority\u2019s position, RFRA does require deference to\n\nreligious adherents\u2019 determinations that their sincerely held beliefs are being\n\nburdened. \u201cThe narrow function of a reviewing court in this context\u201d prevents\n\nunnecessary and improper judicial intrusion into highly sensitive matters of moral\n\nphilosophy or theology, Thomas, 450 U.S. at 716, 101 S. Ct. at 1431, and this\n\nunderstanding of the substantial-burden standard is confirmed by the Supreme\n\nCourt\u2019s most recent religious-accommodation decisions. See Hobbs, 574 U.S. at\n\n__, 135 S.

For example, courts must defer to a religious adherent\u2019s belief, if it is\n\nsincerely held, that dancing is morally wrong. 25 And courts must defer to the\n\nreligious adherent\u2019s understanding that this belief would be burdened if she were\n\nrequired to look upon, even if only for a moment, a single masquerade ball or sock\n\nhop. What courts must determine as an objective matter is whether the burden\n\nimposed by any pro-dancing Government action is a substantial one. Imposing\n\nmillions of dollars in fines for failing to perform a Government-mandated jitterbug\n\nwould, obviously, be a substantial burden on religious exercise. In contrast, there\n\nwould be no substantial burden if the Government merely financed public\n\ndancefloors or had a hortatory policy of extolling the virtues of dance. 26\n\n       If the substantial-burden test were as the majority believes it to be, federal\n\njudges would have to decide whether the burden itself substantially violated the\n\nadherent\u2019s beliefs. That is, the majority would necessarily shift the gaze of its\n\n\u201cobjective inquiry\u201d to the merits of religious belief. In this Bizarro World, it\n\n25\n   Many faith traditions proscribe some or all forms dancing, including various denominations of\nChristianity, Islam, and Judaism.\n26\n   Indeed, it appears that Congress has contemplated adopting such a measure.

Here, despite conceding as the\n\nmajority must that \u201cthe act of opting out plays [some] causal role in the ultimate\n\nprovision of contraceptive coverage,\u201d the majority runs roughshod over the\n\nsincerely held religious objections of Eternal Word Television Network and the\n\nDioceses because, in line with the majority\u2019s sense of things, the \u201cde minimis\n\nburden that the plaintiffs face\u201d resulting from their role as \u201can incidental cause of\n\ncontraceptive coverage being provided\u201d does not constitute a substantial burden.\n\nId. at 44-45, 47. The majority through a nifty bit of legalistic legerdemain\n\nmanages to transform the subjective content of religious adherents\u2019 sincerely held\n\nbeliefs into an objective question of federal law, undercutting the very deference to\n\nreligious exercise it purports to extend.\n\n      The majority\u2019s not-so-veiled implication that, if given its full effect, RFRA\n\nwill be refashioned from a shield protecting the faithful into a sword wielded by\n\ncynical opportunists is troubling and at odds with RFRA\u2019s fundamental respect for\n\nthe deeply held convictions that guide the daily lives of hundreds of millions of\n\nAmericans. As an initial matter, whether or not a belief is sincerely held remains\n\nan important part of RFRA\u2019s substantial-burden inquiry. Courts are not, for\n\nexample, compelled to entertain challenges from such obvious farces as a\n\n\n\n\n                                            126\n\f             Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 127 of 148\n\n\nhypothetical \u201cChurch of Marijuana and Pepperoni Pizza\u201d27 or the satirical \u201cOur\n\nLady of Perpetual Exemption.\u201d 28 Separating the faithful sheep from the cynically\n\nopportunistic goats is well within our judicial capabilities.\n\n       Moreover, to the extent that granting exemptions for religious adherents\n\nwould impair the government\u2019s ability to run programs and administer law\n\nefficiently, this is a feature of RFRA, not a bug. Congress made the clear policy\n\nchoice that protecting the individual right of free religious exercise outweighed the\n\ncosts imposed at the expense of administrative efficiency. And this choice\u2014to\n\npreserve individual freedom by fettering the Government\u2019s ability to act as\n\nexpeditiously as possible\u2014is at the core of our foundational notion of limited\n\ngovernment. Permitting demonstrations in public parks, requiring police officers\n\nto secure a warrant before searching homes or seizing persons, and committing the\n\nGovernment to provide just compensation if it wishes to take private property all\n\nsurely hamper the Government\u2019s ability to pursue countless other important ends.\n\nThese tradeoffs are the cost of liberty. And how best to balance these enhanced\n\n\n\n\n27\n   Of course, people can and do sincerely believe that marijuana consumption serves a\nsacramental purpose. See, e.g., Olsen v.

Striking the proper balance between the collective needs of society and\n\nthe individual freedom of religious exercise has been fraught with rancor and\n\nsectarian strife since time immemorial. Unsurprisingly then, the oft-embattled\n\nRFRA has proven a favorite whipping boy from all sides of the legal academy\n\nduring its twenty-three-year existence. See, e.g., Douglas NeJaime & Reva B.\n\nSiegel, Conscience Wars: Complicity-Based Conscience Claims in Religion and\n\nPolitics, 124 Yale L.J. 2516 (2015); Mary Anne Case, Why \u201cLive-And-Let-Live\u201d is\n\nnot a Viable Solution to the Difficult Problems of Religious Accommodation in the\n\nAge of Sexual Civil Rights, 88 S.

Peck, 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 87,\n135, 3 L. Ed. 162 (1810). RFRA\u2019s protections are statutory, not mandated by the Constitution.\nShould it wish to do so, Congress remains free to alter the scrutiny to be applied to any particular\nlaw challenged under RFRA or to repeal RFRA altogether.\n\n                                                128\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 129 of 148\n\n\n      Judicial declarations that the sky will fall if exemptions were granted to\n\nreligious objectors in a pluralistic society as diverse and vibrant as the United\n\nStates are old hat as well. Consider the following statement of Chief Justice\n\nMorrison Waite, written almost one hundred and fifty years ago:\n\n      Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot\n      interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may with\n      practices. \u2026 Can a man excuse his practices to the contrary because\n      of his religious belief? To permit this would be to make the professed\n      doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in\n      effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.\n      Government could exist only in name under such circumstances.\n\nReynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 166\u201367, 25 L. Ed. 244 (1878). After more\n\nthan a century of wrestling with the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause, the\n\nSupreme Court brought constitutional religious-accommodation doctrine full circle\n\nin Smith, upholding without accommodation neutral laws of general applicability.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Scalia echoed Chief Justice Waite\u2019s sentiment:\n\n      If the \u201ccompelling interest\u201d test is to be applied at all, then, it must be\n      applied across the board, to all actions thought to be religiously\n      commanded. Moreover, if \u201ccompelling interests\u201d really means what it\n      says (and watering it down here would subvert its rigor in the other\n      fields where it is applied), many laws will not meet the test. Any\n      society adopting such a system would be courting anarchy, but that\n      danger increases in direct proportion to the society\u2019s diversity of\n      religious beliefs, and its determination to coerce or suppress none of\n      them.\n\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 888, 110 S. Ct. at 1605 (emphasis added). It is hard to fathom a\n\nplainer statement of the risks of reinstituting a policy of religious accommodation.\n\n                                         129\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 130 of 148\n\n\n      Yet it was against this very backdrop that Congress enacted RFRA in 1993.\n\nAnd Congress specifically declared that by adopting the demands of strict scrutiny\n\nit intended to depart from the less-protective constitutional standard announced in\n\nSmith. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb(4). To the extent that the standard RFRA imposes\n\nraises policy concerns, criticisms on this front are best addressed to Congress, and\n\nmay find appropriate shelter in the pages of law reviews. But as federal judges we\n\nare duty-bound to follow and apply the laws Congress actually enacted, not as we\n\nmight wish them to be. \u201cThe wisdom of Congress\u2019s judgment on this matter is not\n\nour concern. Our responsibility is to enforce RFRA as written, and under the\n\nstandard that RFRA prescribes,\u201d Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at __, 134 S. Ct. at 2785,\n\nthe accommodation, no less than the contraceptive mandate itself, imposes a\n\nsubstantial burden on religious exercise.\n\n                                            B.\n\n      Second, the majority fails to appreciate the crucial role in providing\n\nreligiously objectionable contraceptive coverage that the accommodation foists on\n\neligible organizations. The majority believes that the accommodation places no\n\nburden on the beliefs of Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses\n\nbecause the \u201csignificance they attribute to this act [of opting out]\u201d is misguided,\n\nand thus the outcome of this case is not controlled by the otherwise-identical\n\nanalysis in Hobby Lobby. See ante at 42. According to the majority, \u201c[t]he ACA\n\n                                         130\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 131 of 148\n\n\nand HRSA guidelines\u201d are what \u201centitle women who are plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries covered by group health insurance plans to contraceptive coverage\n\nwithout cost sharing\u201d\u2014\u201cnot the opt out.\u201d See id. at 43\u201344 . This is so even though\n\nthe majority \u201cacknowledge[s] that an eligible organization\u2019s act of [opting out]\n\nresults in the TPA\u2019s designation as the plan administrator\u201d under ERISA and \u201cmay\n\nbe an incidental cause of contraceptive coverage being provided.\u201d Id. at 44\u201345.\n\nBoiled down to its bare essentials, the majority\u2019s position is that if the parties really\n\nunderstood what is going on, they would have no basis to object to their role in the\n\ncontraceptive mandate\u2019s regulatory scheme.\n\n       It is the majority, however, that misunderstands the contraceptive mandate.\n\nUnder its regulatory scheme, as bounded by the statutory requirements of the ACA\n\nand ERISA, 30 the Government becomes empowered to require contraceptive\n\ncoverage for an eligible organization\u2019s self-insured health plan only if that\n\norganization affirmatively opts out under the accommodation. A third-party\n\nadministrator of a self-insured health plan \u201cbears the legal obligation to provide\n\n\n30\n  Some doubts have been raised as to the Government\u2019s exact ability to require third-party\nadministrators to comply with the contraceptive mandate within the scope of its regulatory\nauthority. See Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., 801 F.3d 927,\n941\u201342 (8th Cir. 2015). To the extent such doubts linger, they are of no moment here. \u201cWe\nneed look no further than to the government\u2019s own litigation behavior to gauge the importance of\nself-certification in the regulatory scheme. If [third-party administrators] had a wholly\nindependent obligation to provide contraceptive coverage to religious objectors\u2019 employees and\nplan beneficiaries, there would be no need to insist on \u2026 compliance with the accommodation\nprocess.\u201d Id. at 942.\n\n                                              131\n\f              Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016        Page: 132 of 148\n\n\ncontraceptive coverage only upon receipt of a valid self-certification.\u201d31 Wheaton\n\nCollege v. Burwell, 573 U.S. __, __ n.6, 134 S. Ct. 2806, 2814 n.6, 189 L. Ed. 2d\n\n856 (2014) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). The majority is\n\nincorrect, then, to say that the contraceptive mandate \u201cdoes not turn on whether\n\n[an] eligible organization employer chooses to comply with the law.\u201d See ante at\n\n44. Federal law kicks in only after an eligible organization acts; should an eligible\n\norganization decline to do anything, the Government lacks an independent means\n\nto ensure the provision of contraceptive coverage. Because the regulations\n\ncondition the provision of contraceptive coverage on eligible organizations\u2019\n\naffirmative participation, their participation is the linchpin on which the\n\ncontraceptive mandate rests.\n\n       To draw an analogy with which any first-year law student should be well\n\nacquainted, an eligible organization\u2019s opting out under the accommodation is both\n\nan actual and proximate cause of the provision of contraceptive coverage. There\n\ncan be no doubt that opting out under the accommodation is a \u201ccause in fact\u201d of\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage. But for opting out, the Government would lack\n\nthe requisite regulatory authority over the third-party administrators of the\n\norganizations\u2019 health plans. Cf. Stacy v. Knickerbocker Ice Co., 54 N.W. 1091\n\n31\n   Under the regulations currently in force, a valid self-certification is either Form 700 or the\nalternative notice sent to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 45 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 147.131(b)(3), (c).\n\n                                                 132\n\f            Case: 14-12696      Date Filed: 02/18/2016     Page: 133 of 148\n\n\n(Wis. 1893) (noting that without defendant\u2019s cutting and removing of surface ice,\n\nuncontrolled horses would not have fallen through a frozen lake). The majority\n\ncontests whether the act of opting out also meets some standard of \u201clegal\u201d or\n\n\u201cproximate\u201d cause. See Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 162 N.E. 99, 104 (N.Y.\n\n1928) (Andrews, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhat we do mean by the word \u2018proximate\u2019 is\n\nthat, because of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law\n\narbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point. That is not\n\nlogic, it is practical politics.\u201d). According to the majority, because federal law\n\nentails the authorization to require third-party administrators to provide\n\ncontraceptive coverage, opting out is only \u201can incidental cause of contraceptive\n\ncoverage being provided.\u201d See ante at 44\u201345.\n\n      I fail to see, however, how affirmatively opting out of the contraceptive\n\nmandate under the accommodation could be deemed anything other than a\n\n\u201csubstantial factor\u201d or \u201cmaterial concurring cause\u201d directly leading to the provision\n\nof religiously objectionable coverage. Anderson v. Minneapolis, St. Paul & Sault\n\nSte. Marie Ry. Co., 146 Minn. 430, 436\u201337, 439 (1920). Opting out under the\n\naccommodation sets in motion a chain of events leading to the provision of\n\ncontraceptive coverage as inexorably as night follows day. 32 Once an employer\n\n\n32\n Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses object only to their own, government-\nmandated participation under the contraceptive mandate. They do not\u2014and indeed cannot\u2014\n\n                                           133\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 134 of 148\n\n\nopts out, only then does the Government become authorized to regulate third-party\n\nadministrators. See Grace Sch. v. Burwell, 801 F.3d 788, 808 (7th Cir. 2015)\n\n(Manion, J., dissenting) (describing \u201cthe accommodation\u2019s tangled mess\u201d as \u201cthe\n\nlong and winding extension cord the government uses to power its contraceptive\n\nmandate\u201d). So authorized, there can be no doubt that the Government will in turn\n\nflex its newfound regulatory muscle to require the provision of contraceptive\n\ncoverage.\n\n\n\nseek \u201cto require the Government itself to behave\u201d in accordance with their beliefs. See Bowen v.\nRoy, 476 U.S. 693, 696\u2013700, 106 S. Ct. 2147, 2150\u201352, 90 L.

The majority\u2019s reliance on Bowen and its ilk is,\ntherefore, inapposite.\nLikewise inapposite is the Majority\u2019s analogizing the accommodation to the process used by\nconscientious objectors to opt of a military draft. See ante at 46. As Judge Manion puts it in his\nthorough debunking of this familiar trope,\n        This is not like the case of a conscientious objector who objects and the\n        government finds a replacement. Under the regulations, the government does not\n        find the replacement, the nonprofit does. The designation does not take place\n        unless the nonprofit either delivers the self-certification form to its insurer or\n        TPA, or uses the alternative notice to inform the government who its insurer or\n        TPA is and which health plan is at issue. By insisting that the nonprofit deliver\n        the form or supply the plan information for the government's use, the government\n        uses the objecting nonprofit to do its dirty work. The government has not\n        provided an exit\u2014it offers a revolving door with only one opening.\n        ...\n        This is not the case of a conscientious objector walking into the draft board,\n        voicing his objection, being excused, and walking out. For the analogy to fit the\n        HHS accommodation, the draft board must decide that every objector will be\n        replaced by the objector\u2019s friend, and the objector\u2019s objection is only effective if\n        the objector delivers written notice of his objection to his friend or tells the draft\n        board who his friend is and where the board can find him. Then, the objector\n        must send his friend money so that his friend will remain his friend for the\n        purpose of being his replacement.\nGrace Sch. v.

Of\n\ncourse there is. As the Hobby Lobby majority observed: \u201cThe most\n\nstraightforward way of doing this would be for the Government to assume the cost\n\nof providing\u201d the objectionable contraceptive coverage. 573 U.S. at __, 134 S.

Ct. at 2780\u201382, we must do so here. And I fail\n\n                                          138\n\f              Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 139 of 148\n\n\nto see any reason why the Court\u2019s persuasive reasoning should not be adopted.\n\nThe Government has not shown, as it must, that it would be able to provide the\n\nsame access to contraceptive coverage to the same women only if it can force\n\neligible organizations to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.\n\n       Speaking bluntly, RFRA makes the Government put its money where its\n\nmouth is. I see nothing in RFRA\u2019s text or the subsequent case law that would\n\nallow the Government to claim a compelling interest without having to spend a\n\nsingle red cent to do anything about it. Significant here, the Government must\n\nnecessarily agree that RFRA compels it to fund contraceptive coverage otherwise\n\nthe accommodation would not exist at all. Indeed, the entire purpose of the\n\naccommodation is to make the provision of contraceptive coverage independent of\n\nthe eligible organization, including segregating all the costs paid by the eligible\n\norganization from all the expenditures for the objectionable services. Aware of the\n\nfallacy of free-lunch thinking and absent any expectation of third-party\n\nadministrators acting out of purely eleemosynary impulse, the Government\n\ncommitted itself to funding contraceptive coverage for certain religious objectors, 35\n\nalbeit in roundabout fashion.\n\n\n\n35\n  Notably, the Government did not similarly commit itself to fund contraceptive coverage for\nfemale employees of other employers with religious objections\u2014either churches and church-\naffiliated organizations or eligible organizations that maintain self-insured health plans but do\nnot use a third-party administrator. Nor did the Government commit itself to fund contraceptive\n\n                                               139\n\f             Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016       Page: 140 of 148\n\n\n       To be clear, the Government is already committed to fund the contraceptive\n\nmandate under the current regulations. The Government reimburses third-party\n\nadministrators required to fund contraceptive coverage through a reduction in\n\nFederally-facilitated Exchange user fees, the amount of money paid to be able to\n\noffer insurance products on exchanges established by the Government under the\n\nACA. 36 Money is fungible; the Government finds itself in the same financial\n\nposition whether it declines to collect a tax liability of $500 or whether it collects\n\nthe $500 and then immediately refunds the same. By forgoing revenue to fund the\n\ncontraceptive coverage for the female employees of eligible organizations that opt\n\nout under the accommodation, the Government is effectively paying for the\n\nobjectionable coverage. And in contrast to the half-measure of the\n\naccommodation\u2014which covers only a limited set of religiously objecting\n\nemployers and does not provide access to the female employees of churches and\n\nchurch-affiliated organizations, employers with grandfathered health plans, or\n\ncoverage for female employees of employers with grandfathered plans or employers with fewer\nthan fifty full-time employees.\nThough there may be some level of backstop coverage provided by the other provisions of the\nACA and Title X, see infra n.36, the Government\u2019s failure to extend its largesse to these women\nmay also call into question the contraceptive mandate\u2019s asserted compelling interest\u2014which,\nagain, I assume the Government would be able to show\u2014but certainly raises an obvious\nquestion: If the Government is able and willing to pay for some women to receive access to\ncontraceptive coverage, why would it not be a less-restrictive means to do so in a more\nstraightforward manner for all women at risk of being denied such access?\n36\n   As discussed above, third-party administrators may either reduce their own Federally-\nfacilitated Exchange user fees if they are also in the business of selling insurance or they may\nenter into a contractual arrangement with another insurer to recoup that insurer\u2019s user fees. See\n80 Fed. Reg. at 41328.\n\n                                               140\n\f             Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 141 of 148\n\n\nemployers with fewer than fifty full-time employees 37\u2014providing for\n\ncontraceptive coverage directly without the accommodation\u2019s administrative\n\nrigmarole would allow the Government to offer cost-free access to each and every\n\nwoman in the United States should it choose to do so. And the Government has\n\nfailed to shoulder its burden to show that it would be unable to grant women access\n\nto contraceptive coverage without the coerced involvement of Eternal Word\n\nTelevision Network and the Dioceses.\n\n       Again, this straightforward application of well-established legal principles\n\nshould carry the day. But, again, the majority thinks otherwise. Specifically, the\n\nmajority concludes that the current iteration of the contraceptive mandate has\n\nfinally hit upon the least restrictive means of achieving the Government\u2019s\n\ncompelling interest when \u201cthe cost to the government\u201d and \u201cthe burden the\n\nalternatives impose on the affected women\u201d are taken into account. See ante at 63.\n\nThough I do not dispute that these concerns are relevant to the least-restrictive-\n\n\n\n\n37\n  For female employees whose health plans are not subject to the contraceptive mandate, the\nGovernment has stitched together a patchwork safety net under Title X and other provisions of\nthe ACA. The record does not reveal how many women who would otherwise lack access to\ncontraceptive services are eligible for coverage under this makeshift framework. Nor does the\nrecord reveal whether there are hundreds, thousands, or millions of women who will continue to\ngo without such access, with or without the accommodation. Though a less-restrictive means\nneed not be a perfect means, strict scrutiny demands that the Government\u2019s chosen solution must\nbe \u201cneither seriously underinclusive nor seriously overinclusive.\u201d Brown v. Entm\u2019t Merchants\nAss\u2019n, 564 U.S. __, __, 131 S. Ct. 2729, 2741\u201342, 180 L. Ed. 2d 708 (2011).\n\n                                             141\n\f            Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 142 of 148\n\n\nmeans inquiry, I cannot agree with the majority that they save the contraceptive\n\nmandate from RFRA\u2019s exceptionally demanding scrutiny.\n\n      The arguments advanced in the majority\u2019s apology for the contraceptive\n\nmandate seem to rest largely on speculative and overblown logistical problems the\n\nGovernment might face if it were held responsible for furthering its asserted\n\ncompelling interest. According to the majority, if the Government were forced to\n\nprovide contraceptive coverage \u201coutside the existing, largely employer-based,\n\ninsurance system,\u201d whether directly or through tax credits, \u201cCongress would need\n\nto pass legislation that would fundamentally change how the majority of\n\nAmericans receive\u201d contraceptive coverage specifically, if not healthcare\n\ngenerally. See id. at 66\u201367. Likewise, if forced to keep the current model of\n\nproviding contraceptive coverage through eligible organizations\u2019 health plans, \u201cthe\n\ngovernment would be hamstrung\u201d because of the \u201cgaps\u201d in institutional knowledge\n\nthat would spring up regarding which female employees of which employers\n\nwould be covered by the Government and which are not. Id. at 72. As a result,\n\nbecause the majority believes that adopting any of the alternatives it considers\n\nwould incur various administrative and transactions costs, the result would be less\n\naccess to contraceptive coverage, undermining the Government\u2019s asserted\n\ncompelling interest. See id. at 70\u201371, 74.\n\n\n\n\n                                         142\n\f            Case: 14-12696    Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 143 of 148\n\n\n      The majority\u2019s insistence on assuming a virtually immutable regulatory and\n\nstatutory status quo is fundamentally misplaced. RFRA makes clear that it is the\n\n\u201cGovernment\u201d that \u201cshall not substantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion,\u201d\n\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(a) (emphasis added), not just constituent parts acting within\n\ntheir respective spheres of authority. In Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente\n\nUniao do Vegetal, for example, the Supreme Court specifically rejected the\n\nGovernment\u2019s position \u201cthat the Controlled Substances Act is [not] amenable to\n\njudicially crafted exceptions [for the hallucinogen hoasca]\u201d because of \u201cthe\n\nexistence of a congressional exemption for peyote.\u201d 546 U.S. 418, 434, 126 S. Ct.\n\n1211, 1222, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (2006). It would be absurd to say, then, that we\n\ncannot grant a judicially crafted exception here because the relevant administrative\n\nagencies lacked the regulatory authority to promulgate exceptions that would have\n\nbeen equally effective in achieving an allegedly compelling interest had there been\n\ncongressional action allowing them to do so. In short, if the Government as a\n\nwhole has a less-restrictive alternative available, the Government must use it.\n\n      The majority\u2019s radically revisionist account of RFRA, in contrast, would\n\nlimit the universe of less-restrictive means to what the Executive Branch can\n\naccomplish unilaterally by administrative fiat. This is a shocking reversal of our\n\nConstitution\u2019s prime directive: \u201cAll legislative Powers herein granted shall be\n\nvested in a Congress of the United States.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1. To the extent\n\n                                         143\n\f             Case: 14-12696        Date Filed: 02/18/2016      Page: 144 of 148\n\n\nthat the Government claims an interest of the highest order, it is only reasonable\n\nthat Congress be expected to pitch in when freewheeling regulators encounter\n\nstatutory roadblocks. The practical hurdles to providing the access to\n\ncontraceptive coverage the Government seeks would simply disappear if Congress\n\nwere to slightly tweak the contraceptive mandate\u2019s statutory authorization under\n\nERISA and the ACA. By having Congress eliminate the need for eligible\n\norganizations to affirmatively designate the third-party administrators of their\n\nhealth plans\u2014thus becoming directly involved in the provision of the\n\nobjectionable coverage\u2014the Departments of Labor, Treasury, and Health and\n\nHuman Services would no longer need to substantially burden eligible\n\norganizations by putting them to the \u201cchoice\u201d of affirmatively violating their\n\nsincerely held beliefs or paying massive penalties. And the Government has failed\n\nto show why this could be accomplished without imposing any additional burden\n\non female employees only if eligible organizations were required to use the\n\naccommodation. 38\n\n\n\n\n38\n  To the extent that there may be additional administrative costs incurred in crafting an\nappropriately tailored exception to the contraceptive mandate, RFRA contemplates such costs\nand places them squarely on the Government\u2019s shoulders. Even if the Government were to\nrequire female employees of exempt employers to fill out the sort of all-too-familiar paperwork\nassociated with receiving health insurance, such a \u201cburden\u201d\u2014in contrast to being forced to either\nviolate a sincere religious conviction or face steep monetary penalties\u2014would be, at most, \u201cde\nminimis.\u201d Cf. Catholic Health Care Sys. v. Burwell, 796 F.3d 207, 220 (2d Cir. 2015).\n\n                                              144\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 145 of 148\n\n\n      Finally, the fate of the contraceptive mandate under RFRA is complicated by\n\nthe Government\u2019s decision to condition benefits flowing to third parties on actions\n\ntaken by religious objectors in violation of their beliefs. I agree that granting an\n\nexemption that would impose costs on third parties could, under certain\n\ncircumstances, run afoul of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. See\n\nCorp. of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v.\n\nAmos, 483 U.S. 327, 334\u201335, 107 S. Ct. 2862, 2868, 97 L.

But such an eventuality alone\n\ndoes not automatically transform the Government\u2019s chosen means into the least-\n\nrestrictive alternative required by RFRA. As the Supreme Court reiterated in\n\nupholding the constitutionality of RLUIPA, RFRA\u2019s sister statute, \u201c\u2018there is room\n\nfor play in the joints between\u2019 the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses,\n\nallowing the government to accommodate religion beyond free exercise\n\nrequirements, without offense to the Establishment Clause.\u201d Cutter v.

If we were to honor the\n\nGovernment\u2019s request, anytime regulators wanted to immunize their slapdash\n\nefforts, regardless of the potential alternatives, they need only condition a benefit\n\nto third parties on any substantial burden placed on religious exercise. Lest RFRA\n\nis understood to have ushered in the apotheosis of the administrative state, surely\n\nthe rigorous standard of strict scrutiny cannot be so easily evaded.\n\n\n      Without a doubt, there are sundry ways for the Government to provide\n\nwomen with cost-free access to contraceptive coverage. The administrative\n\nagencies tasked with promulgating the regulatory structure that undergirds the\n\ncontraceptive mandate chose, because of convenience and their bounded statutory\n\nauthority, to do so in a manner that substantially burdens religious adherents. We\n\nhave been presented insufficient evidence to hold that the goal of increasing access\n\nto contraceptive coverage could be reached only through the circuitous regulatory\n\npathways that have been cobbled together here. The Government, therefore, has\n\n                                          146\n\f                Case: 14-12696       Date Filed: 02/18/2016   Page: 147 of 148\n\n\nfailed to carry its burden to show that the contraceptive mandate is the least\n\nrestrictive means of furthering any assumed compelling interest.\n\n                                                 V.\n\n          The sweeping protections for religious exercise Congress contemplated\n\nwhen it enacted RFRA should not be denied to Eternal Word Television Network\n\nand the Dioceses. RFRA\u2019s text and purpose, as confirmed by well-established\n\nprecedent, extend these protections to religious adherents forced to choose between\n\naffirmatively participating in a regulatory scheme that they sincerely believe would\n\nmake them complicit in denigrating the sanctity of human life and paying millions\n\nof dollars in noncompliance penalties. Because the Government cannot show that\n\nthe latest iteration of its constantly evolving \u201caccommodation\u201d survives strict\n\nscrutiny, RFRA bars enforcing the contraceptive mandate against those employers\n\nwhose religious exercise it substantially burdens.\n\n          By concluding otherwise, the majority diminishes the full range of religious\n\nliberty that Congress sought to protect when it enacted RFRA. Recasting and\n\nenfeebling RFRA\u2019s standard as nothing more than \u201cgood enough for government\n\nwork\u201d is a far cry from strict scrutiny\u2019s typical charge of fiat justitia ruat caelum. 39\n\nPerhaps the majority\u2019s desire to bring RFRA\u2019s statutory protections for religious\n\nliberty closer in line with the less-demanding constitutional standard represents a\n\n39\n     Let justice be done though the heavens may fall.\n\n                                                 147\n\f            Case: 14-12696     Date Filed: 02/18/2016    Page: 148 of 148\n\n\nsuperior policy judgment.

They claim that the accommodation substantially burdens their religious exercise in violation of RFRA by forcing them to take actions that cause their health plan administrators to provide contraceptive coverage and to maintain a health plan that - serves as a conduit for contraceptive coverage. We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 claims because we conclude that the regulations do not substantially burden their religious exercise and, alternatively, because (1) the government' has compelling interests to justify the accommodation, and (2) the accommodation is the least restrictive means of furthering those interests.\nEternal Word Television Network (\u201cEWTN\u201d), the plaintiff in the first appeal, also raises several First Amendment challenges to the accommodation. Because the accommodation is a neutral, generally applicable law that does not discriminate based on religious denomination, we reject EWTN\u2019s challenges under the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. We also reject EWTN\u2019s challenge1 under the Free Speech Clause because, as' discussed below, any speech restrictions that may flow from the accommodation are justified by a compelling governmental interest and are thus constitutional.\nI.

If an employer fails to provide such coverage in its group employee health plan, it is subject to penalties in the form of a tax of $100 per day per affected person. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980D(b)(1). The Women\u2019s Health Amendment to the ACA added to the minimum coverage requirements a mandate that group health plans provide women with coverage for preventive care and screenings. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4), The requirement was intended in part to \u201cget[ ] rid of, or mini-miz[e], high copays and high deductibles that are often overwhelming hurdles for women to access screening programs.\u201d 155 Cong. Rec. S11987 (Nov. 30, 2009) (statement of Sen. Mikulski). The ACA tasked the Health Resources and Services Administration (\u201cHRSA\u201d), an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), with promulgating comprehensive guidelines determining which preventive services and screenings would be required. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). HHS commissioned the Institute of Medicine (\u201cIOM\u201d) to assist with HRSA\u2019s development of the guidelines.\nThe IOM released a full report in 2011 detailing its study-of various preventive services and its recommendations for coverage under the mandate. Inst, of Medicine, Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps (2011) (\u201cIOM Report\u201d). The IOM Report discussed at length the positive public health outcomes associated with reducing unintended pregnancies and giving women more control over birth spacing. The United States has a much higher rate of unintended pregnancies \u2014 49 percent of pregnancies in 2001\u2014 than other developed countries. Id. at 102. Unintended pregnancies correlate with health problems both for women who experience such pregnancies and for children born as a result of them. Id. at 103. And because women may not realize immediately that they are pregnant, \u201ctheir entry into prenatal care may be delayed[;] they may not be motivated to discontinue behaviors that present risks for the developing fetus; and they may experience depression, anxiety, or other conditions.\u201d Id. Unintended pregnancies also frequently end in abortion. Id. at 102.2\nThe IOM Report also noted the health consequences of pregnancies occurring too closely together in time. For infants, \u201c[sjhort interpregnancy intervals in particular have been associated with low birth weight, prematurity, and small for gestational age births.\u201d Id. at 103. For women, both pregnancy spacing and the ability to avoid pregnancy may significantly affect their health because, among other reasons, some \u201cwomen with certain chronic medical conditions (e.g., diabetes and obesity) may need to postpone pregnancy until appropriate weight loss or glycemic control has been achieved.\u201d Id. Pregnancy is also contraindicated for some women with serious medical conditions, for example, pulmonary hypertension or Marfan syndrome.3 *1131Id. at 103-04. The IOM Report also found that \u201cgreater use of contraception within the population produces lower unintended pregnancy and abortion rates nationally.\u201d Id. at 105.\nPursuant to its statutory authority, HRSA released binding guidelines, based on the IOM Report, that require coverage for \u201c[a]ll Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.\u201d U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., Health Res. &amp; Servs. Admin., Women\u2019s Preventive Services Guidelines (\u201cHRSA guidelines\u201d), http://www.hrsa.gov/ womensguidelines (last visited Feb. 12, 2016); see also 77 Fed.Reg. 8725, 8725-26 (Feb. 15, 2012) (quoting the language in the HRSA guidelines regarding coverage). Implementing regulations developed by the Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury, and HHS (collectively, the \u201cDepartments\u201d) reiterate the contraceptive mandate\u2019s requirement that health plans cover all services listed in the HRSA guidelines. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv) (Treasury Regulation); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv) (Labor Regulation); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) (HHS Regulation).4\nMindful of religious freedom and the importance of respect for \u201cthe unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial positions,\u201d the Departments promulgated interim regulations that gave HRSA discretion to exempt from the contraceptive mandate certain group health plans established or maintained by religious employers. See 76 Fed.Reg. 46621, 46623 (Aug. 3, 2011). The Departments defined \u201creligious employer\u201d by incorporating the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s definition of a church or integrated auxiliary from 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) and (iii). 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B) (2011). The definition also required a religious employer to have a religious purpose and to both serve and employ primarily persons who share the religious tenets of the organization. Id. Exercising the discretion the regulations provided, HRSA amended its guidelines to exempt religious employers from the contraceptive mandate. The guidelines, issued on August 1, 2011, required compliance beginning on August 1, 2012. See id. \u00a7 147.130(b)(1).\nThe Departments finalized the implementing regulations in February 2012. See 77 Fed.Reg. 8725. At the same time, the Departments established a temporary safe harbor from the contraceptive mandate for nonprofit organizations with religious objections to providing contraceptive coverage. See Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., Guidance on the Temporary Enforcement Safe Harbor for Certain Employers, Health Plans &amp; Group Health Insurance Issuers with Respect to the Requirement to Cover Contraceptive Services Without Cost Sharing (Feb., 10, 2012). The safe harbor remained in effect for the 2012 plan year, ending on August 1, 2013. See id. at 2.\nThe Departments intended to use the safe harbor period to \u201cexpeditiously develop and propose changes to the final regulations implementing\u201d the contraceptive mandate. 77 Fed.Reg. 16501, 16503 (Mar. 21, 2012). The changes to the regulations needed to \u201cmeet two goals \u2014 accommodating non-exempt, nonprofit religious organizations\u2019 religious objections to covering contraceptive services and assuring that *1132participants and beneficiaries covered under such organizations\u2019 plans receive contraceptive coverage witbout cost sharing.\u201d Id. In March 2012, the Departments began the rulemaking process and solicited comments on potential regulations that could achieve these, two goals. Id. at 16501.\nAt the - conclusion of the rulemaking process in July 2013, the Departments promulgated revised regulations that'retained HRSA\u2019s authority to exempt religious employers. See 78 Fed.Reg. 39870 (July 2, 2013). The same day, HRSA released revised guidelines that tracked the Departments\u2019 changes to the religious employer. exemption. The final regulations simplified the definition of a \u201creligious employer,\u201d making the term coextensive with the IRS\u2019s statutory definition and removing the additional qualifications regarding a religious employer\u2019s mission, programs, and employees. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(a) (2013); see also 78 Fed.Reg. at 39873-74. Religious employers remained categorically exempt from the contraceptive mandate out' of \u201crespect [for] the religious interests of houses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries.\u201d 78 Fed.Reg. at 39874. The Departments noted that the exemption did not undermine their goal of 'making contraceptive coverage available because religious employers and their integrated auxiliaries \u201care more likely than other employers to employ people of the same faith who share the same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than other people to use contraceptive services even if such services were covered under-their plan.\u201d Id.\nThe revised regulations, which took effect on Aug. 1, 2013, added an accommodation for organizations'that do not qualify as religious employers under the exemption. See 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(b) (2013). So long as an organization is a nonprofit entity holding itself out as a religious organization and has a religious objection to providing contraceptive coverage (we refer to such entities as \u201celigible organizations\u201d), it may opt .out of the contraceptive mandate. Id.5\nEligible organizations can take advantage, of the accommodation via one of two procedures. The first procedure requires the organization to complete Employee Benefits Security Administration Form 700 (\u201cForm: 700\u201d). See EBSA Form 700-Certification (Aug. 2014), http://www.dol. *1133gov/ebsa/preventiveserviceseligi bleorganizationcertificationform'.doc.6 To complete the two-page form, the eligible organization must provide its name and the . name, title, and contact-information of the individual signing the form on.behalf of the organization. The person signing the, form must certify that the organization \u201chas a religious objection to providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive services that would otherwise be required to be covered.\u201d Id.\nThe form\u2019s recipient depends oh the type of health plan the eligible organization maintains. Employers can provide health benefits either through an -insured health plan or a self-insured health plan.7 See Cong. Budget Office/ Key Issues in Analyzing Major Health Insurance Pro-pos\u00e1is 6 (2008). If the eligible organization has an insured plan, it gives Form \"700 to the insurance company that provides its health plan (\u201cplan provider\u201d); \"if the organization has a self-insured plan, it gives Form 700 to its third-party administrator (\u201cTPA\u201d). ' The plaintiffs in both cases before' us provide health benefits to their employees through self-insured group health plans, and- all employ TPAs to administer their plans.\nAlternatively, an eligible organization may directly notify HHS of its religious objection to complying with the contraceptive mandate. This more recently developed method of taking advantage of the accommodation arose from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s order granting, a preliminary injunction in Wheaton College v. Burwell, \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2806, 189 L.Ed.2d 856 (2014). After the regulations concerning the exemption and accommodation- procedures were finalized-, the Supreme Court in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2751, 2759-60, 189 L.Ed.2d 675 (2014), extended the accommodation for nonprofit religious organizations to closely held for-profit corporations whose owners have religious objections to complying with the contraceptive mandate. Three days after the Hobby Lobby decisi\u00f3n was \u00edss\u00faed, the Supreme Court in Wheaton College granted a request for a preliminary injunction pending appellate review to a plaintiff challenging the accommodation itself under RFRA, the same \"challenge the plaintiffs mount here. Wheaton Coll., 134 S.Ct. at 2807. The Supreme' Court\u2019s order enjoined HHS from enforcing the accommodation procedure against the college, so long as the college \u201cinformed] the ; Secretary of Health and Human Services in writing that it is a nonprofit organization that holds itself out as religious and has religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court warned, however, that the injunction order \u201cshould not be construed as an expression of the' Court\u2019s views- on the merits.\u201d Id.8\nIn response to the order in Wheaton College, the Departments issued interim final regulations in August 2014 \"to allow an eligible organization to opt out by sending a letter to HHS, instead \u00f3f giving Form 700. to its plan provider or TPA, 79 Fed. *1134Reg. 51092, 51094-95 (Aug. 27, 2014); see Ctr. for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Servs., Model. Notice, https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/ Resources/Regulations-and-Guidance/ Downloads/Model-Notice-8-22-14.pdf (last visited Feb. 12, 2016).9 There is no prescribed format for the letter, but it must include:\nthe name of the eligible organization \u00e1nd the basis on which it qualifies for an accommodation; its objection based on its sincerely held religious beliefs to coverage of some or all contraceptive services, as applicable (including an identification of the subset of contraceptive services to which coverage the eligible organization objects, if applicable); the plan name and type ...; and the name and contact information for any of the plan\u2019s third party - administrators and health insurance issuers.\n45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(c)(1)(ii).\nThe regulations became final, without substantial changes, in a set of new rules effective, on September 14, 2015. 80 Fed. Reg. 41318. (July 14, 2015). Under the current rules, if an eligible organization directly notifies HHS of its intent to opt out of the contraceptive mandate, the government then alerts the organization\u2019s health plan provider or TPA that the organization has opted out and describes the plan provider\u2019s or TPA\u2019s resulting obligations. See 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2713A(b)(1)(ii)(B), (c)(1)(ii).\nFor insured plans, once an eligible organization avails itself of the accommodation, the plan provider must (1) \u201c[e]xpressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the group health insurance coverage\u201d and (2) \u201c[pjrovide separate payments for any contraceptive services required to be covered\u201d for the plan participants and beneficiaries. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(c)(2)(i).\nFor self-insured plans, the regulations provide that when an eligible organization invokes the accommodation, its TPA is designated as the plan administrator under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(16), with respect to contraceptive services. Under the regulations, the TPA is designated as the- plan administrator in one of two ways. If the eligible organization provides a copy of Form 700 to its TPA, then the regulations treat the form \u201cas a designation of the [TPA] as the plan administrator\u201d for ERISA purposes. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-16(b). If the eligible organization instead notifies HHS of its intent to opt out, then the Department of Labor notifies the TPA that it shall be the plan administrator with respect to contraceptive services for ERISA purposes. Id.\nUpon receiving notification, the TPA has the option of terminating its contractual relationship with the eligible organization.10 See 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-*11352713A(b)(2). If it remains as the TPA, then it must provide (or arrange for another insurer to provide) contraceptive benefits to participants and beneficiaries of the self-insured plan. Id.; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-16(c).11\nSignificantly, plan providers and TPAs \u201cmay not impose any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), or impose any premium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or- indirectly, on the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2713A(c)(2)(i); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(c)(2)(ii).12 Plan providers \u201cmust segregate premium revenue collected from the eligible organization from the monies used to provide payments for contraceptive services:\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(c)(2)(h). A plan provider or TPA also must notify plan participants and beneficiaries (contemporaneously with the delivery of other plan materials, if possible) \u201cthat the eligible organization does not administer or fund contraceptive benefits,\u201d but that the plan provider or TPA instead \u201cprovides separate payments for contraceptive services.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2713A(d); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(d).\nB. The Parties and Procedural History\nThis opinion addresses two cases: one brought by EWTN and one brought by two Catholic Dioceses and a group of related persons and entities.. Below, we briefly discuss the plaintiffs and the procedural history of each case in turn.\n1. Eternal Word Television Network\nPlaintiff-appellant EWTN is a non-profit worldwide Catholic media network founded in 1981 by Mother Mary Angelica, a Catholic -nun. EWTN, based in Irondale, Alabama, has approximately 350 employees. The network consists of 11 television feeds and two radio- stations that reach 230 million homes in 144 countries and territories. Its programming includes daily Mass, Catholic devotions, coverage of Catholic Church events, documentaries, children\u2019s programs, educational series, and other television and radio shows that support EWTN\u2019s mission of \u201cservpng] the orthodox belief and teaching of the Church as proclaimed by the Supreme Pontiff and his *1136predecessors.\u201d Compl. at 5, No. 1:13-cv-00521-CG-C, Doc. 1. EWTN has a self-insured group health plan to provide health insurance benefits to its employees. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama serves as the TPA for the plan.\nEWTN, together with the State of Alabama,13 filed a complaint challenging the contraceptive mandate and accompanying regulations under RFRA, the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act' (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq. The complaint alleged that \u201cEWTN cannot facilitate access to health care insurance ... that covers artificial contraception, sterilization, or abortion, or related education and counseling, without violating its deeply held religious beliefs.\u201d Compl., at 7, No. 1:13-cv-00521-CG-C, Doc. 1. To EWTN, this means that its religious beliefs prevent it both from providing contraceptive coverage in its health plan and from using the accommodation. As a result, EWTN alleged, the contraceptive mandate \u201cimposes government pressure and coercion on EWTN to change or violate its religious beliefs\u201d because,if it does not provide coverage or use the accommodation, it faces fines for non-compliance with the mandate. Id at 27.\n' EWTN and Alabama moved for partial summary judgment on five of the 17 counts in the complaint, including: Count One, alleging a violation of RFRA based on the regulations\u2019 burden on religious exercise; Count Two, alleging a violation of the Free Exercise Clause based oh the same burden; Count Three, alleging a violation of the Free Exercise Clause based on intentional discrimination among religious organizations; Count Five, alleging a violation of the Establishment Clause based on the selective imposition of a burden on some religious organizations; and Count Nine, alleging a violation of the Free Speech Clause based on compelled speech. Alabama joined in EWTN\u2019s motion and additionally moved for summary judgment on Count Seventeen, which sought a. declaration that the contraceptive mandate does not preempt Alabama law.\nThe defendants-appellees \u2014 the Departments and Their Secretaries \u2014 filed a motion to \u25a0 dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment on all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The district court denied EWTN\u2019s and Alabama\u2019s motions for summary judgment and granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to Counts One, Two, Five, and Nine. On a motion by the plaintiffs, the district court entered a final judgment on those four counts pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) and stayed litigation of the remaining claims pending appeal.\nEWTN timely appealed. On EWTN\u2019s motion, we issued an injunction pending appeal, preventing the defendants from enforcing the mandate or the accommodation against EWTN. Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v. Sec\u2019y, U.S. Hep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., 756 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir.2014).\n2. The Diocesan Plaintiffs, CENGI, and Catholic Charities\nA group of Catholic entities \u2014 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta, the Archbishop of Atlanta, Christ the King Catholic School, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Atlanta (\u201cCatholic Charities\u201d), the Roman Catholic Diocese of Savannah, and the Bishop of Savannah \u2014 filed a lawsuit against the Departments and their Secretaries. Both the Archdiocese of Atlanta and the Diocese of Savannah (collectively *1137with the Bishop and' Archbishop, \u25a0 \u201cthe Dioceses\u201d) are associations of Catholic parishes' and organizations, including Catholic schools. Catholic Charities is a nonprofit organization that provides social services, including immigration counseling, mental health counseling, marriage counseling, and pregnancy support services. The second amended complaint added as a plaintiff Catholic Education of North Georgia (\u201cCENGI\u201d) and removed Christ the King Catholic School. - CENGI- is a nonprofit organization that oversees- five Catholic schools-in the Atlanta area. .\nThe Atlanta Archdiocese operates a self-insured health plan, which covers employees of the Archdiocese, Catholic Charities, and CENGI. The Savannah Diocese operates two self-insured health plans for its employees. Meritain Health serves as the TPA for all three plans.14 \u00ab --\nThe second amended complaint alleged that the contraceptive mandate and accompanying regulations violate RFRA, the First Amendment, the non-delegation doctrine,15 and the APA. The plaintiffs alleged that the regulations require them \u201cto provide, pay for, and/or facilitate insurance coverage for abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, 'and contraception, in violation of their religious beliefs.\u201d Second ' Am. Compl. at 6, No. l:12-cv-03489-WSD, Doc. 56. They alleged that the regulations further burden religious exercise \u201cby driving a wedge between religious organizations, like the Atlanta Archdiocese, and their equally religious charitable -arms,- such as Plaintiffs Catholic Charities and CENGI.\u201d Id. Because the charitable arms do not qualify, as \u201creligious employers,\u201d the Dioceses'alleged they must expel the charities\u2019 employees from their health plans if the Dioceses'wish to take advantage of the religious exemption;16\nThe Departments filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint or, alternatively, for surrimary judgment' on all counts. *The plaintiffs cross-moved for summary judgment as to seven of their eight counts, which alleged that the mandate and accompanying regulations: burden religious exercise in violation of RFRA (Count One); violate the Free Exercis\u00e9 Clause, based bn the same burden (Count Two); compel speech in violation of the Free Speech Clause (Count Three); prohibit speech in violation of the Free 'Speech Clause (Count Four); favor certain *1138religious groups and entangle the government in religion in violation of the Establishment Clause (Count Five); interfere with internal church governance in violation of both the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses (Count Six); and involve an impermissible delegation of unchecked legislative authority to the Departments (Count Seven).\nThe district- court granted summary judgment to Catholic Charities and CEN-GI on their RFRA claims, holding that the contraceptive mandate and accommodation substantially burden the organizations\u2019 religious exercise and are not the least restrictive means to accomplish a compelling governmental interest. The court enjoined the Departments from enforcing the mandate or the accommodation against Catholic Charities and CENGI. In addition, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on their claim that the noninterference provision created a content-based speech restriction in violation of the First Amendment.\nAs to the Dioceses\u2019 RFRA claim, the court granted summary judgment to the Departments. The Dioceses had argued first that they might at some point have to pay more in premiums to help cover their plan providers\u2019 cost of contraceptive coverage, in violation of their religious beliefs, and second that the \u2019distinction between religious employers and organizations eligible for the accommodation would force the Dioceses to remove unaffiliated Catholic schools from their insurance plans. Rejecting both arguments, the district court ruled that the'first argument was merely speculative (and the outcome on which the Dioceses speculated would, in any event, be prohibited by law) and the second argument failed to assert a legitimate religious exercise. The district court granted the Departments summary judgment motion as to all of the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims based on the First Amendment, the non-delegation doctrine, and the APA.\nDespite the split judgment, only the Departments appealed the district court\u2019s decision. Because revisions to the regulations have rendered the plaintiffs\u2019 compelled speech- claim based on the non-interference provision moot,17 the appeal in this case concerns only the district court\u2019s grant of summary-judgment to Catholic Charities and CENGI on . their RFRA claim. \u2022 -\nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\u201cThis court reviews the district court\u2019s disposition of cross-motions for summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standards used by the district court, viewing the evidence and all factual inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-movant, and resolving all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d Am. Bankers Ins. Group v. United States, 408 F.3d 1328 (11th Cir.2005). Summary judgment is proper if the movant can show \u201cthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as- a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). Where the material' facts are undisputed and all that remains are questions of law, summary judgment may be granted. See Saregama India Ltd. v. Mosley, 635 F.3d 1284, 1290 (11th Cir.2011).\n*1139III. DISCUSSION\nA. RFRA Claims\n1. Legal Background\na. RFRA\nRFRA provides that the federal government \u201cshall not substantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion\u201d unless it demonstrates that the burden \u201cis in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest\u201d and \u201cis the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental .interest.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(a)-(b). Congress passed RFRA in 1993 in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990), which held that \u201ca law that is' neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.\u201d Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993) (characterizing Smith). In Smith, the Supreme Court reasoned that \u201c[t]o make an individual\u2019s obligation to obey [a neutral'and generally applicable]' law contingent upon the law\u2019s coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State\u2019s interest is \u2018compelling[,]\u2019 ... contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense.\u201d Smith, 494 U.S. at 885, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nCongress' stated that the.purpose of RFRA was \u201cto restore, the compelling interest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972).\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb(b)(1). Congress declared the strict scrutiny standard provided \u201ca workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing pri- or governmental interests.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2000bb(a)(5). Indeed, RFRA \u201cpro-, vide[s] even broader protection for religious liberty than was available under\u201d Sherbert or Yoder because the government must also show that it used the least restrictive means to achieve its compelling interest. Hobby Lobby, 134 S.Ct. at 2761 n. 3.\nb. Hobby Lobby\nIn Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court held that enforcing the contraceptive mandate without an accommodation against closely held for-profit corporations that objected on religious grounds to providing contraceptive coverage violated RFRA. The corporations and their owners challenged the mandate as substantially burdening. their religious exercise. Id. at 2764-66. The owners of the corporations sincerely believed that life begins at conception and that it is a sin to facilitate access to contraceptive drugs or devices that could destroy an embryo. Id. It was undisputed that the mandate required the plaintiffs to provide health insurance that covered methods of contraception that could r\u00e9sult in the destruction of an embryo. Id. at 2775. The plaintiffs asserted that the mandate left them with only two options: (1) provide coverage for contraception in violation of their religious beliefs or (2) pay significant penalties. Given these choices, the Supreme Court held that the mandate \u201cimpose[d] a substantial burden.\u201d Id. at 2779.\nThe government argued there was no substantial burden because the connection between what the mandate required the plaintiffs ,to do (provide health insurance that covered contraception) and the end that they found morally wrong (the destruction of an embryo) was too attenuated. Id. at 2777. The premise of the government\u2019s attenuation argument was that \u201cproviding the coverage would not itself *1140result in the destruction of an embryo; that would occur only if an employee chose to take advantage of the coverage and to use one of the four [contraceptive] methods at issue.\u201d Id. In other words, the government asserted that the plaintiffs\u2019 belief \u2014 that providing insurance coverage for contraception facilitated the destruction of embryos \u2014 was unreasonable. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, which would have required the Court to determine the \u201ccircumstances under which it is wrong for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another.\u201d Id. at 2778. The Supreme Court cautioned that \u201cfederal courts have no business addressing\u201d such questions of religion and moral philosophy. Id. Instead, the Supreme Court deferred to the plaintiffs\u2019 religious belief that the coverage' \u201cis connected to the destruction of embryo in a way that is sufficient to make it immoral for them to provide the coverage.\u201d Id.\nThe Court then considered whether the mandate survived strict scrutiny. The majority assumed that the mandate furthered a compelling governmental interest18 but held that it was not the least restrictive means- of doing so. Id, at 2779-80. The Court pointed to the accommodation, which at the time applied only to nonprofit organizations with religious objections, as a less restrictive alternative. The Court explained that after an organization opts out, the plan provider (for insured plans) or TPA (for self-insured plans) must exclude contraceptive coverage, from the group health plan, and provide separate payments- for. contraceptive coverage without-imposing cost sharing requirements on the organization, plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries. Id. at 2782. Although *1141the Court declined to answer whether the accommodation complied with RFRA, it lauded the accommodation as \u201cseek[ing] to respect the religious liberty of religious nonprofit corporations while ensuring that the employees of these entities have precisely the same access to all FDA-approved contraceptives as employees of companies whose owners have no religious objections to providing such coverage.\u201d Id. at 2759. The Court further recognized that \u201c[t]he effect of the HHS-created accommodation on the women employed by Hobby Lobby and the other companies involved in these cases would be precisely zero.\u201d19 Id. at 2760.\nc. Wheaton College\nAfter Hobby Lobby, the Court considered the accommodation itself in the context of an injunction sought under RFRA in Wheaton College. The Court enjoined the government from enforcing the mandate but required, the. plaintiff to inform HHS in writing that it had religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services. 134 S.Ct. at 2807. The Court explained that the government could \u201crely[ ] on this notice ... to facilitate the provision of full contraceptive coverage.\u201d Id. The practical effect of the Wheaton College decision was twofold: the plaintiff received an accommodation, and HHS could rely on the notification to provide contraceptive coverage to the participants and beneficiaries of the plaintiffs plan.\nd. Other RFRA Challenges to the Accommodation\nAfter Hobby Lobby and' Wheaton College, federal courts around the country considered RFRA challeng\u00e9s to the, accommodation. Applying these two Supreme Court decisions, seven of the eight circuits to review these cases held that the accommodation does not violate RFRA. See Mich. Catholic Conf. &amp; Catholic Family Servs. v. Burwell, 807 F.3d 738 (6th Cir.2015); Catholic Health Care Sys. v. Burwell, 796 F.3d 207 (2d Cir.2015); Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell, 794 F.3d 1151 (10th Cir.), cert. granted sub nom., S. Nazarene Univ. v. Burwell, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 445, 193 L.Ed.2d 346, and cert. granted, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 446, 193 L.Ed.2d 346 (2015); E. Tex. Baptist Univ. v. Burwell, 793 F.3d 449 (5th Cir.), cert. granted, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 444, 193 L.Ed.2d 345 (2015); Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell (\u201cNotre Dame II\u201d), 786 F.3d 606 (7th Cir.2015);20 Geneva Coll. v. Sec\u2019y U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., 778 F.3d 422 (3d Cir.), cert. granted sub nom., Zubik v. Burwell, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 444, 193 L.Ed.2d 345, and cert. granted, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 445, 193 L.Ed.2d 346 (2015); Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs. (\u201cPriests for Life I \u201d), 772 F.3d 229 (D.C.Cir.2014), reh\u2019g en banc denied, (\u201cPriests for Life II\u201d), 808 F.3d 1 *1142(D.C.Cir.2015), cert. granted, sub nom., Roman Catholic Archbishop of Wash. v. Burwell, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 444, 193 L.Ed.2d 345 (2015), and cert. granted, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 446, 193 L.Ed.2d 345 (2015). These circuits concluded that the accommodation does not substantially burden religious exercise.21 The Eighth Circuit disagreed, holding that the accommodation' substantially burdens 'religious exercise arid cannot survive strict scrutiny. Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., 801 F.3d 927 (8th Cir.2015), petition for cert. filed, 84 U.S.L.W. 3350 (U.S. Dec. 15, 2015) (No. 15-775). Recently, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in several of these cases.\nThe seven circuits that upheld the accommodation recognized that the RFRA claim in Hobby Lobby was fundamentally different from challenges to the accommodation itself. In Hobby Lobby, the plaintiffs challenged the mandate \u2014 that is, the requirement that they provide contraceptive coverage \u2014 when their only options were to provide the coverage or pay significant penalties. But in the accommodation cases, the plaintiffs have challenged the regulatory scheme that allows them to opt out of the mandate without penalty. Put another way, the plaintiffs in the accommodation cases \u201cdo not challenge the general obligation under the ACA to provide contraceptive coverage. They instead challenge the process they must follow to get out of complying with that obligation.\u201d Little Sisters of the Poor, 794 F.3d at 1160. Because they assert that \u201cthe exemption process itself imposes a substantial burden on their religious faiths,\u201d their challenges are somewhat \u201cparadoxical and virtually unprecedented.\u201d Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 246 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe circuits upholding the accommodation recognized that the question of whether there is a substantial burden involves an objective inquiry. After interpreting the ACA arid 'its regulations, they held that the act of opting out does not trigger contraceptive coverage. See, e.g., Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 614 (explaining that \u201c[i]t is federal law, rather than the religious organization\u2019s signing and mailing the form, that requires ... third-party administrators of self-insured health plans[ ] to cover contraceptive services\u201d). Although the eligible organizations asserted that the act of opting out makes them complicit in providing coverage, these courts explained that this objection could not constitute a substantial burden because individuals \u201chave no RFRA right to be free from the unease, or even anguish, of knowing that third parties \u00e1re legally privileged or obligated to act in ways their religion abhors.\u201d Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 246.\nIn Sharpe Holdings, the Eighth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion, holding that the accommodation substantially burdened religious exercise, and enjoined the government from enforcing the accommodation. Relying on Hobby Lobby, the Eighth. Circuit held that it was bound to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cassertion that self-certification under the accommodation process \u2014 using either Form 700 or HHS Notice \u2014 -would violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d22 Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 941. Because the plaintiffs faced a *1143substantial penalty if they failed to seek an accommodation or provide contraceptive coverage, the Eighth Circuit concluded there was a .substantial burden. Id. at 942.\nThe Eighth Circuit then applied strict scrutiny. The court assumed that the government had a compelling interest but held that the government, had failed to carry its burden to show that it lacked other means to achieve its interest without imposing a substantial burden on religion. Id. at 943. The Eighth Circuit concluded that less restrictive alternatives included the government: (1) requiring less information from eligible organizations seeking an accommodation; (2) assuming the cost of providing contraceptives through subsidies, reimbursements, tax credits, or tax deductions to employees; (3) paying for distribution of. contraceptives at community health centers, public clinics, and hospitals; or (4) making contraceptive coverage available through the healthcare exchanges. Id. at 944-45. Given these alternatives, the Eighth Circuit concluded that the accommodation failed to survive strict scrutiny.\n2. RFRA Analysis\nWith this legal landscape in mind, we now consider the plaintiffs\u2019 RFRA challenge. We hold that their challenge fails because (1) the accommodation does not substantially burden- their religious exercise, and (2) in the alternative, even if there is a substantial burden, the, accommodation survives strict scrutiny.\na. The Plaintiffs Allege a Sincere Religious Belief.\nA threshold question we must ask is whether the plaintiffs\u2019 religious beliefs on which their RFRA claims are based are sincere. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S.Ct. at 2774 n. 28 (\u201cTo qualify for RFRA\u2019s protection, an asserted belief must be \u2018sincere\u2019 \u2014 \u201d). It is well established that we defer to a plaintiff\u2019s statement of its own belief, so long as the plaintiff actually holds that belief. See id. at 2779 (\u201c[I]t is not for [courts] to say that [the plaintiffs\u2019] religious beliefs are mistaken or insubstantial.\u201d); Davila v. Gladden, 777 F.3d 1198, 1204 (11th Cir.) (\u201c[W]e look pnly to see whether the, claimant ... actually holds the beliefs, he claims ..to hold.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)), cert. denied sub nom., Davila v. Haynes, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 78, 193 L.Ed.2d 32 (2015).\nEach plaintiff states that its religious beliefs prevent it from paying for, providing, or facilitating the distribution of contraceptives. Each plaintiff also asserts that it cannot be complicit in the provision of contraception. The\u00bb government does not contest the sincerity of these religious beliefs, nor is there, any indication whatsoever in the record -that the stated beliefs are insincere. We thus conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 religious beliefs at issue are sincere. ''\nb. The Accommodation Does Not Substantially Burden the Plaintiffs\u2019 Religious Exercise.\nWe now consider whether, accepting the plaintiffs\u2019 sincere religious beliefs, the accommodation substantially burdens their religious exercise. The plaintiffs assert that\u2019 the act of notifying HHS or their TPAs of their religious objection will either trigger contraceptive coverage or make them complicit in a system that provides such coverage. Due to the significance they attach to opting out, the plaintiffs contend that the accommodation itself imposes a substantial burden because it puts them to the choice of violating their sincerely held religious beliefs or paying a substantial penalty. We accept the plaintiffs\u2019 sincere belief that triggering coverage or being complicit in coverage violates their religious beliefs and that the accommodation puts them to a choice between honoring their religious beliefs and facing *1144significant penalties. We nonetheless conclude that the accommodation imposes no substantial burden.\n(i) The Substantial Burden Analysis Involves an Objective Inquiry.\n\u201c[A] \u2018substantial burden\u2019 must place more than an inconvenience on religious exercise.\u201d Midrash Sephardi Inc. v. Town of Surfside, 366 F.3d 1214, 1227 (11th Cir.2004).23 A law is substantially burdensome when it places \u201csignificant pressure\u201d on an adherent to act contrary to her religious beliefs, meaning- that it \u201cdirectly coerces the religious adherent to conform ... her behavior.\u201d Id. Thus, the government imposes a substantial burden when it places \u201cpressure that tends to force- adherents to forego -religious precepts.\u201d Id.\nThis inquiry involves both subjective and objective dimensions. Hobby Lobby made clear that there is a subjective aspect to this inquiry: courts must accept a religious adherent\u2019s assertion that his religious beliefs require him to. take or abstain from taking a ,specified action. See 134 S.Ct. at 2779. But the substantial burden analysis does not end there. We agree with our seven sister circuits that the question of substantial burden also presents \u201ca question of law for courts to decide.\u201d Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 247.\nThe objective inquiry- requires courts to consider whether the government actually \u201cputs\u201d the religious adherent to the \u201cchoice\u201d of incurring a \u201cserious\u201d penalty or \u201cengaging] in conduct that seriously violates [his] religious beliefs.\u201d Holt v. Hobbs, \u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 853, 862, 190 L.Ed.2d 747 (2015) (second alteration in original, and internal quotation marks omitted). Put another way, courts must determine what the challenged law actually requires of the plaintiff. For example, in Holt,- a-Muslim inmate-asserted that prison grooming policy substantially burdened his religious exercise because' it prohibited him from growing a' beard,'which his religion required. The Supreme Court explained that because the \u201cgrooming, policy requires petitioner to shave his beard,\u201d the policy \u201cput['j\u201d him to the choice of violating his religious beliefs or facing serious disciplinary action. Id. In Holt, as in many RFRA cases, this'' inquiry was straightforward because there was no dispute about what the government\u2019s policy objectively requir\u00e9d' of the religious adherent. But when there is a dispute about what a law or governmental policy objectively requires, it is for the courts to construe the law or policy.\nThe plaintiffs here contend that under Hobby Lobby no such objective inquiry is required. In their view, a religious adherent\u2019s mere assertion that she is being compelled to violate her sincerely held religious belief means that - the government has put her to such a choice, regardless of what the law objectively requires.24 We *1145disagree. In Hobby Lobby, the plaintiffs challenged the contraceptive mandate. It was undisputed that the mandate gave the plaintiffs just two options: provide contraceptive coverage or pay a substantial penalty. Although \u2022 the Supreme Court engaged in no objective analysis about what the mandate required, such analysis was unnecessary because the parties agreed that the government, through the mandate, put the plaintiffs to the choice of providing contraceptive coverage or paying a hefty fine. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S.Ct. at 2777-79; see also Priests for Life II, 808 F.3d at 2 (Pillard, J.) (concurring in denial of reh\u2019g en banc) (\u201cThe parties in Hobby Lobby did not dispute what the law required, nor its practical effects...:\u201d).\nHere, the parties agree that the plaintiffs have at least three options: provide contraceptive coverage, pay a penalty,, or use the accommodation to opt- out of providing contraceptive coverage.25 But they disagree about whether opting out puts the plaintiffs to the choice of violating their religious beliefs or paying a substantial fine. The plaintiffs contend that because an eligible organization\u2019s TPA only becomes obligated to provide coverage when the organization opts out, by opting out they will be triggering coverage. The government argues to the contrary that plan participants and beneficiaries are entitled to contraceptive .coverage under the ACA regardless of any opt out. We conclude that it is for the courts to determine objectively what the regulations require \u2022 and whether the government has,' in fact, put plaintiffs to the choice of violating their religious beliefs by seeking the accommodation or incurring a substantial penalty.\nWe reject a framework that takes away from courts the responsibility to decide what action the government requires and leaves that answer entirely to the religious adherent Such \u00e1 framework improperly substitutes religious belief for legal analysis regarding the operation of federal law. Indeed,-the plaintiffs have identified nothing in RFRA or case law that allows a religious adherent to dictate to the courts what the law requires. The plain language of RFRA simply does not support reducing th\u00e9 role of federal' courts to \u201crubber stamps\u201d \u2018 that automatically recognize a substantial burden whenever \u00e1 religious adherent asserts there is one. Catholic Health Care Sys., 796 F.3d at 218. If Congress had intended strict scrutiny to be triggered in all circumstances by a religious adherent\u2019s claim that there is a burden, it would have said so. Instead, it required that the federal government \u201csubstantially burden\u201d the adherent's religious exercise.\nOur, dissenting, colleague concedes that the question of substantial, burden involves \u2022an objective inquiry but asserts that the inquiry should be limited to whether the government .has imposed a substantial penalty. See Dissent at 1179-80. This *1146analysis would require courts to defer to a religious adherent\u2019s sincere belief that the government is forcing her to choose between her .religious belief and paying a substantial fine, even when the religious adherent is objectively wrong about how the law operates and what action the government requires her to take. The dissent\u2019s view is flawed because any burden (even an objectively insubstantial one) becomes a substantial burden if the penalty is heavy enough.\nWe acknowledge that in Hobby Lobby tjie Supreme Court cautioned courts against dictating to religious adherents \u201cthe circumstances under which it is immoral for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the .commission of an immoral act by another.\u201d 134 S.Ct. at 2778. In some cases, a court\u2019s objective analysis interpreting a statute or regulation may contradict a religious adherent\u2019s sincerely held belief about what that law requires. .But such questions about what a law means are not the type of \u201cdifficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy\u201d for which courts must defer to religious adherents. Id; see Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 623 (Hamilton, J., concurring) (explaining that the interpretation of the regulations that give rise to the accommodation' \u201cis an issue not of moral philosophy'but of federal law\u201d).\nDeciding how the law functions is not the only objective part of the substantial burden inquiry. The Supreme Court\u2019s free exercise cases (prior to Smith) distinguished between substantial burdens on religious exercise, which are protected, and de minimis burdens, which are not. For example, a religious adherent may not \u201crequire the Government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport\u201d with the person\u2019s religious beliefs, even if the government action interferes with that person\u2019s religious exercise. Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 699-700, 106 S.Ct. 2147, 90 L.Ed.2d 735 (1986); see Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass\u2019n, 485 U.S. 439, 451, 108 S.Ct. 1319, 99 L.Ed.2d 534 (1988) (recognizing that government\u2019s decision to log and.build roads would \u201chave severe adverse effects\u201d on practice of Native American religion but concluding this burden was not \u201cheavy enough\u201d to trigger strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause).\n\u25a0In Bowen, Nativ\u00e9 American parents challenged federal statutes requiring them to provide- their daughter\u2019s social security number to state welfare agencies as a condition of seeking benefits on the- ground that it impinged upon their free exercise of religion. They sought an accommodation to keep the government from using her social security number in administering benefits, which they believed would rob their daughter of her spirit. 476 U.S. at 695-96, 106 S.Ct. 2147.\nEven recognizing that the parents had a sincere belief that by using'her social security number the government would be stealing their daughter\u2019s spirit, the Supreme Court rejected their claim, holding that the government\u2019s \u201cuse of a Social Security number ... does not itself in any degre\u00e9 impair [the parents\u2019] freedom to believe, express, and exercfise their] religion.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 700,106 S.Ct. 2147 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court rejected the parents\u2019 attempt to use the Free Exercise Clause to \u201cdemand that the Government join in their chosen religious practices.\u201d Id at 699-700, 106 S.Ct. 2147. The Court explained that \u201c[t]he Free Exercise Clause affords an individual protection from certain forms of governmental compulsion,\u201d yet.does not extend so far to \u201cafford an individual a right to dictate the conduct of the Government\u2019s internal procedures.\u201d Id. at 700, 106 S.Ct. 2147. The Court acknowledged that the parents\u2019 \u201creligious views may not accept\u201d the line that *1147the Court drew \u201cbetween individual and governmental conduct,\u201d but it drew a line nonetheless. Id. at 701 n. 6, 106 S.Ct. 2147. Likewise, under RFRA courts must determine whether the burden on a religious adherent is, in fact, substantial.26\nAs we alluded to above, the plain language of RFRA supports our conclusion that there is a distinction between a burden. and a substantial burden. RFRA requires strict scrutiny only when the government \u201csubstantially burden[s] a person\u2019s exercise of religion.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-l(a). Congress chose to modify \u201cburden\u201d with \u201csubstantial[ ],\u201d27 and we must of course interpret RFRA to give full effect to its every word. See TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31, 122 S.Ct. 441, 151 L.Ed.2d 339 (2001) (recognizing that statutes should be construed whenever possible so that \u201cno clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nWe recognize that the distinction between burden and substantial burden is not implicated in every RFRA case. Nonetheless, there are cases brought under RFRA in which the purported burden is too slight to trigger strict scrutiny. For example, in Kaemmerling v. Lappin, an inmate challenged under RFRA the Bureau of Prison\u2019s collection and analysis of his DNA. 553, F.3d 669, 673-74 (D.C.Cir.2008). He claimed that the government\u2019s sampling, collection, and analysis of his DNA violated his sincerely held religious beliefs about the proper use of DNA. The D.C. Circuit concluded there was no substantial burden.. .Importantly, the inmate had no religious objection to the collection of his bodily material; he challenged only how the government would subsequently use that specimen to extract his DNA information. Id. at 678-79, There was-no question that the Bureau, of Prisons required the inmate to submit a bodily specimen that would be used for an end to which he had a strong religious objection (that is, the collection and analysis of his DNA). But the D.C. Circuit held there was no substantial burden because the inmate \u201csuggested] no way in which these government acts pressure[d] him to modify his own behavior in any way that would violate his beliefs.\u201d Id. at 679.. Kaemmer-ling reinforces that a religious adherent cannot use RFRA to stop the government or third parties from taking subsequent actions to which he objects when the acts required of him impose a de minimis burden.28\n*1148(ii) No Substantial Burden Exists.\nTo determine whether the accommodation objectively puts plaintiffs to the choice of violating their religious beliefs or paying a significant fin\u00e9, we must understand how the accommodation functions and what it requires of these plaintiffs. The only act that the regulations require the plaintiffs to take is to seek the accommodation \u2014 that'is, filling out and sending Form 700 to their TPAs or writing a letter to HHS letting it know of their objections; The plaintiffs do not contend that notifying HHS or their TPAs itself constitutes a substantial burden because of- the time or effort involved. ' Rather, them objection is based on the significance they attribute to this act. They contend that the act - of opting out triggers contraceptive coverage-for plan participants and beneficiaries or makes them complicit in a system that provides contraceptive coverage. We accept that the plaintiffs truly believe that triggering contraceptive coverage or being complicit in a system providing contraceptive coverage violates their religious beliefs. But our objective inquiry leads us to conclude that the government has not put plaintiffs to the choice of violating their religious beliefs or facing a significant penalty. We hold there is no substantial burden.\nHere\u2019s why: the ACA and HRSA guidelines are what entitle plan participants and beneficiaries to contraceptive coverage. The ACA provides that the plaintiffs\u2019 self-insured plans \u201cshall, at a minimum provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for ... with respect to women, such additional preventative care and screenings ... as provided for in\u201d the HRSA guidelines. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). The HRSA Guidelines, in turn, \u201crequire coverage, without cost sharing, for *[a]11 ... [FDA] approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.\u2019 \u201d 77 Fed. Reg. at 8725 (alterations in original) (quoting HRSA guidelines).\nThe plaintiffs and the dissent take a different view of the statutory and regulatory scheme, contending that an eligible organization\u2019s act of opting out triggers the TPA\u2019s designation as plan administrator and, without it, plan participants- or-beneficiaries would not receive contraceptive coverage.29 Indeed, the dissent asserts that opting out requires an eligible *1149organization\u2019s \u201caffirmative participation\u201d because the act of opting out is the \u201clinchpin on which the contraceptive mandate rests.\u201d Dissent at 1187. We disagree.\nThe ACA and the HRSA guidelines\u2014 not the opt out \u2014 are, to borrow the dissent\u2019s term, the \u201clinchpins\u201d of the contraceptive mandate because they entitle women who are plan participants and beneficiaries covered by group health insurance plans' t\u00f3 contraceptive coverage without cost sharing. In other words, women are entitled to contraceptive coverage regardless of their employers\u2019 action (or lack of action) with respect to seeking an accommodation. Because a woman\u2019s entitlement to contraceptive benefits does not turn on whether her eligible organization employer chooses , to comply with the law (by providing contraceptive coverage or seeking an accommodation) or pay a substantial penalty (in the form of a tax) for noncompliance, we cannot say that the act of opting out imposes a substantial burden.30\nWe do not mean to imply that the act of opting out plays no causal role in the ultimate provision of contraceptive coverage. We acknowledge that an eligible organization\u2019s act of notifying HHS or its TPA of its objection results in the TPA\u2019s designation as the plan administrator and gives rise to the TPA\u2019s obligation to provide contraceptive coverage.31 See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-16(b). But we view an\u2019 eligible organization\u2019s act of opting out as, at most, an incidental cause of plan participants and beneficiaries receiving contraceptive coverage because these wom\u2019en are-entitled to contraceptive coverage under the ACA and HRSA guidelines regardless of whether the eligible organization opts out: Accordingly, even if the act of opting out in some way leads to \u2019women receiving the contraceptive coverage to which they were entitled under-federal law, the plaintiffs have failed'to establish 'that th\u00e9 act of Opting out substantially burdens their religious exercise. Importantly, the government does not force an eligible organization to provide contraceptive coverage, pay costs related to contfaceptive coverage, notify plan participants and beneficiaries of the existence o\u2019f such coverage, or even include the availability of such coverage from a separate source in information the plan provides to plan participants and beneficiaries. Instead, all of these responsibilities fall' upon the TPA. Rather, the only action required of the eligible organization is opting Out: literally, the organization\u2019s notification of its objection. Such an opt out requirement is \u201ctypical of religious objection accommodations that shift responsibility to non-objecting entities only after an objector declines to perform a task on religious grounds.\u201d Little Sisters of the Poor, 794 F.3d at 1183.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 challenge is in substance indistinguishable from an objection to the government\u2019s requiring another entity to *1150provide coverage in their stead. See Catholic Health Care Sys., 796 F.3d at 224 (characterizing an identical challenge as seeking a \u201cblanket religious veto over the government\u2019s interactions with others\u201d). Put differently, the plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to opting out is an objection to their inability to keep the TPA with which they have contracted to provide services in connection with healthcare coverage from complying with the relevant regulations. The plaintiffs point to a but-for causal .relationship between their opting out and the conduct that they find religiously objectionable. But, as the Supreme Court has explained, a religious adherent cannot claim a substantial burden based on the subsequent conduct of another party.32 See Bowen, 476 U.S. at 699-700, 106 S.Ct. 2147 (\u201cJust as the government may not insist that appellees engage in any set form of religious observance, so appellees may not demand that the Government join in their chosen religious practices by refraining from using a number to identify their daughter.\u201d).33\nWe recognize that the plaintiffs sincerely abhor and object to the subsequent acts taken by the government and their TPA, which ultimately result in the TPA providing contraceptive coverage to their plan participants and beneficiaries. We acknowledge that they \u201cmay not accept [the] distinction\u201d that we draw here between their conduct and the downstream, separate conduct of HHS and the TPAs to provide coverage. Id at 701 n. 6, 106 S.Ct. 2147. But we simply cannot say that RFRA affords the plaintiffs the right to prevent women from obtaining contraceptive coverage to which federal law entitles them based on the de minimis burden that the plaintiffs face in notifying the government that they have a religious objection.\nAs the Seventh Circuit first articulated, an analogy to a conscientious objector to the military, draft illustrates why the accommodation does not impose a substantial burden. See Notre Dame I, 743 F.3d at 556. A religious conscientious objector to the military draft may opt of military ser-vic\u00e9 based on his belief that war is immoral. The objector sincerely believes that his act of opting out triggers the drafting of another person in his place, and thus renders him complicit in the very thing to which he objects. But we would reject the assertion that the government\u2019s subsequent act of drafting another person in his place \u2014 even though the drafting was in some sense caused by the objector\u2019s act of opting out \u2014 transforms the act of lodging a conscientious objection into a substantial burden. See id Likewise, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that opting out imposes a substantial burden because the government requires a third party to provide contraceptive coverage after an eligible organization opts out.\n*1151Accordingly, we conclude that through the accommodation the government has imposed no substantial burden on the plaintiffs. We thus hold that the accommodation does not violate RFRA.\nc. The Accommodation Survives Strict Scrutiny.\nEven assuming that the accommodation imposes a substantial \u25a0 burden on plaintiffs\u2019 religious , exercise, RFRA allows the government to impose such a burden when it demonstrates that the burden \u201cis in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest\u201d and \u201cis the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(b). Because the government has carried its burden of showing that the accommodation is the least restrictive means of, furthering its compelling interests, we hold in the alternative that the accommodation survives strict scrutiny under RFRA.\n(i) Compelling Interests Justify the Accommodation.\nIn applying RFRA\u2019s strict scrutiny test, we must first determine whether the accommodation is \u201cin furtherance of a compelling governmental interest.\u201d Id. Because the mandate and accommodation require the provision of cost-free contraceptive coverage with little to no administrative burden on women, these regulations further compelling government interests in avoiding the adverse public health consequences of unintended pregnancies and in assuring women the equal benefit of preventative care , by requiring' coverage for their, distinctive health needs.34 See Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 258-59.\n(a) The Government\u2019s Interests in Reducing the Rate of Unintended Pregnancies Are Compelling.\nWe begin our analysis with the facts: unintended or poorly spaced pregnancies have a host of negative impacts on women and children. See supra Part I.A. Women who experience unintended pregnancies are often unaware of their condition in the early stages of their pregnancy, which leads them to delay prenatal care and cessation of behaviors such as smoking or alcohol consumption. 78 Fed.Reg. at 39872. Babies born as a result of unintended pregnancies are at a greater risk of premature birth and low birth weight. Id. Short interpregnancy intervals also result in a greater risk of prematurity and low birth weight. Id. Contraceptive use can alleviate these public health problems.35 \u201c[G]reater use of contraception within the *1152population produces lower unintended pregnancy and abortion rates nationally.\u201d IOM Report at 105.\nDuring debate over the ACA, Congress was informed that \u201c[i]n America today, too many women are delaying or skipping pre-v\u00e9nt\u00edve care because of the costs of copays and. limited access.\u201d 155 Cong. Rec. S12027 (Dec. 1, 2009) (statement of Sen. Gillibrand). The IOM Report also found that \u201ccost-sharing requirements, such as deductibles and copayments, can pose barriers to care and result in reduced use of preventive and primary care services, particularly' for low-income populations.\u201d IOM Report at 109. The Women\u2019s Health Amendment, which added to the ACA the requirement that group and individual health plans provide women with coverage for preventative care and screenings, aimed to increase women\u2019s use of preventive care by removing administrative and financial barriers. See 155 Cong. Rec. S12027 (statement of Sen. Shaheen) (\u201cToo often, women forgo their health care needs because they are not affordable. We know cost plays a greater rol\u00e9 in preventing women from accessing health1 care than it does men. In 2007, more than half of all women reported problems accessing needed health care because of costs.\u201d); see also Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 260 (explaining that Congress and the Executive branch determined with the ACA and its regulations that \u201cserving the government\u2019s compelling public health interests depends on overcoming the human behavioral tendencies of denial and delay documented in the legislative and regulatory record\u201d).\nMoreover, the Women\u2019s Health Amendment, which added the contraceptive mandate to the ACA\u2019s minimum coverage requirements, specifically addressed the need to provide preventive care to women to rectify past gender discrimination in health insurance; As the- Departments noted, \u201cthe statute acknowledges that both existing health coverage and existing preventive services recommendations, often did not adequately serve the unique health needs of women. This disparity placed women in the workforce at a disadvantage compared to' their male coworkers.\u201d36 78 Fed.Reg. at 39873; see also 155 Cong. Rec. S12027 (statement of Sen. Gillibrand) (\u201cThe- prevention section of the bill before us must be amended so coverage of preventive services takes into account the unique health care needs of women throughout their lifespan.\u201d). Indeed, before the ACA, \u201cwomen of'childbearing age spent 68 percent more on out-of-pocket health care costs than1 men.\u201d 78 Fed.Reg. at 39887. The Departments explained that this \u201cdisproportionate\u201d financial burden \u201cprevented women from achieving health outcomes on an equal basis with men.\u201d Id. The Departments intended the contraceptive coverage requirement to \u201chelp[ ] to equalize the provision of preventative health care services to women and, as a result, help[ ] women contribute to society to th\u00e9 same degree' as men.\u201d Id. As the Departments explained, \u201c[rjesearch shows that access to contraception improves the social and economic status of women.\u201d Id. at 39873; see generally Claudia Goldin &amp; Lawrence F. Katz, The Power of the Pill: Oral Contraceptives &amp; Women\u2019s Career &amp; Marriage Decisions, 110 J. of Pol. Econ. 731(2002).\nBased on this evidence, we conclude that the government\u2019s interests in the public health of women and children, as well as in *1153assuring wom\u00e9n equal preventative care, are compelling.\n(b) The Mandate and Accommodation Further These Compelling Interests.\n.The mandate : and - accommodation achieve the government\u2019s goals by making contraceptives affordable and otherwise accessible to women. As explained above, federal law generally guarantees women contraceptive coverage without cost sharing. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4); 77 Fed.Reg. at 8725 (discussing HRSA guidelines). Importantly, under the mandate and accommodation, women covered by group health, insurance plans generally are required to take no additional action to obtain this contraceptive coverage. This is because the coverage is delivered \u201cthrough the existing employer-based system, of health coverage.\u201d 78 Fed.Reg. at 39888. Thus, under the mandate, women need not complete extra paperwork or sign up for an additional program because the contraceptive coverage is delivered with the health insurance they already have through their employers. \u2022\nThis is true even wh\u00e9n an employer opts out of providing contraceptive coverage by seeking an accommodation. Although objecting employers are not obligated to provide or pay for contraceptives, the women covered by their plans seamlessly receive contraceptive coverage from the plans\u2019 TPAs. This system was carefully designed to make contraceptive coverage accessible by not requiring women to research plans that offer contraceptive coverage, purchase separate' contraceptive coverage, or even sign up with a different entity or program. See id. As the Supreme Court acknowledged in Hobby Lobby, the' Departments designed the accommodation so that it has \u201cprecisely zero\u201d impact on -female plan participants and beneficiaries. 134 S.Ct. at 2760; see also id. at 2759 (explaining the accommodation \u201censur[es] that the-employees of [eligible organizations] have precisely the same access to all FDA-approved contraceptives as employees of companies whose owners have no religious objections to providing such coverage\u201d).37\n\u25a0Providing women with such - seamless coverage, should result in a lower unintended pregnancy rate. Medical evidence reflects a causal relationship between the accessibility of contraceptives and the unintended pregnancy raje: \u201cprogress in reducing the rate of unintended pregnancy would -be possible by making contraceptives more available, accessible, and acceptable.\u201d, IO.M Report at 104 (internal quotation marks omitted); see. also id. at 109 (\u201c[C]ost-sharing requirements, such as deductibles and. copayments, can pose barriers to care and result in reduced use of preventative and primary care services, particularly for low-income populations.\u201d); Dianne Greene Foster, et.al., Number of Oral Contraceptive Pill Packages Dispensed &amp; Subsequent Unintended Pregnancies, Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, March 201J, at 566 (concluding that when receipt of oral contraceptives was made more convenient by dispensing them annually rather than quarterly the unintended pregnancy rate dropped by 30% and the abortion fate dropped by 46%).38 Because the gov*1154ernment has demonstrated that the mandate and accommodation increase access to contraception, we conclude that the mandate and accommodation are effective ways to reduce the unintended pregnancy.rate. Accordingly, they serve the government\u2019s compelling interests of improving the health of women and children and assuring that women receive health benefits that meet their needs as well as the health care provided to men does.\nOf course, a compelling interest alone is insufficient to satisfy RFRA; we must also assess \u201cthe marginal interest in enforcing\u201d the challenged law against the religious adherents in question. Hobby Lobby, 134 S.Ct. at 2779. \u201cRFRA requires \u2022 the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law \u2018to the person\u2019 \u2014 the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.\u201d Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 430-31, 126 S.Ct. 1211, 163 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2006) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-l(b)); see also Yoder, 406 U.S. at 221, 92 S.Ct. 1526 (\u201cWhere fundamental claims of religious freedom are at stake, however, we cannot accept such a sweeping claim' [of compelling interest]; despite its admitted validity in the generality of cases, we must searchingly examine the interests that the State seeks to promote ... and the impediment to those objectives that would flow from recognizing the claimed ... exemption.\u201d).\nYoder provides a good example of the application of this principle.' There, the Amish plaintiffs challenged Wisconsin\u2019s law requiring high school attendance until the age of 16. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 207-08, 92 S.Ct. 1526. The government asserted that the law was justified by a general interest in the virtues of universal education. Id. at 213-14, 92 S.Ct. 1526. The Supreme Court was unsatisfied with this interest as it applied to the plaintiffs. \u201c[T]he evidence adduced by the Amish ... [was] persuasively to' the effect that an additional one or two years of formal high school for Amish children in place of their long-established program of informal vocational education would do little to serve [the government\u2019s stated] interests.\u201d Id. at 222, 92 S.Ct. 1526 (emphasis added).\nSimilarly, the government\u2019s argument in 0 Centro exemplifies an overly generalized interest. The plaintiffs, a religious sect with origins in the Amazon rainforest, challenged the Controlled Substances Act\u2019s regulation of hoasca, a hallucinogenic tea they used in religious ceremonies. The federal government argued that it had \u201ca compelling interest in the uniform applica*1155tion of the Controlled Substances Act, such that no exception to the ban on use of the hallucinogen can be made to accommodate the sect\u2019s sincere religious, practice.\u201d O Centro, 546 U.S. at 423, 126 S.Ct. 1211. The Supreme Court dismissed this slippery slope argument, which it said \u201ccould be invoked in response to any RFRA claim for an exception to a generally applicable law,\u201d because it failed to consider the limited effect of an exception for the particular plaintiffs, and its stated need for universal application was undermined by the existence of other exceptions. Id. at 435-36, 126 S.Ct. 1211.\nIn contrast to Yoder and 0 Centro, here the government\u2019s stated interests all concern the law\u2019s application to these particular plaintiffs. The government argues that applying the accommodation procedure to the plaintiffs in these cases furthers its interests because the accommodation ensures that the plaintiffs\u2019 female plan participants and beneficiaries \u2014 who may or may not share the same religious beliefs as their employer \u2014 have access to contraception without cost sharing or additional administrative burdens as the ACA requires. Unlike the exception made in Yoder for Amish children, whom the Supreme Court found had an adequate substitute for additional formal education to refute the government\u2019s compelling interest, here the IOM Report\u2019s findings of poor health outcomes related to, unintended or poorly timed pregnancies apply to the plaintiffs\u2019 female plan participants or beneficiaries and their children just as they do to the general population.\nMoreover, the accommodation\u2019s requirement that the plaintiffs inform their TPAs or HHS of their religious objection is essential to achieving the government\u2019s compelling interests. It ensures that a TPA is aware when it has an obligation to provide contraceptive coverage so that the women covered by these plans can receive coverage if they want it, without gaps in such coverage. The notification also guarantees that the Departments will be able to identify objecting organizations, like the plaintiffs, to make sure that the accommodation procedures work (that is, to independently ensure that the women covered by the plaintiffs\u2019 plans are receiving the coverage to\u2019which they are entitled). Thus, the government\u2019s interests are sufficiently particular to satisfy the 0 Centro standard.\n(c) The Exceptions to the Mandate and Accommodation Do Not Undermine the Government\u2019s Compelling Interest.\nThe plaintiffs arg\u00fce that the government\u2019s interests in providing broad contraceptive coverage cannot be compelling because the ACA provides exemptions from the mandate for other types of employers \u2014 namely, those (1) with grandfathered health plans, (2) with fewer than 50 employees, and (3) that qualify as \u201creligious employers.\u201d We disagree.\nFirst, the existence of grandfathered plans does not undermine the government\u2019s compelling interest in providing contraceptive coverage because grandfathered plans are only a short-lived, transitional measure intended to ease the burden of compliance with the ACA\u2019s sweeping reforms. 78 Fed.Reg. at 39887 n. 49 (\u201c[T]he Affordable Care Act\u2019s grandfathering provision is only transitional in effect, and it is expected that a majority of plans will lose their grandfathered status by the end of 2013.\u201d). To be grandfathered, a plan, must continue to provide virtually the same benefits for the same percentage cost sharing as the plan had in effect on March 23, 2010. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140(g)(1)(h). It becomes difficult to comply with' these requirements over time. See, e.g., Second Am. Compl. at 23-24, No. 1:12-cv-03489, Doc. 56 (describing the Atlanta Archdiocese\u2019s inabili*1156ty to afford to maintain its grandfathered plan past January 1, 2014).\nResearch by the Kaiser Family Foundation' demonstrates that the percentage of workers covered by grandfathered plans has rapidly declined: 26 percent in 2014, down from 36 percent in 2013, 48 percent in 2012, and 56 percent in 2011. Kaiser Family Found. &amp; Health Research &amp; Ed. Trust, Employer Health Benefits 2015 Annual Survey at 218 (Sept. 22, 2015).39 In addition, some employees covered by grandfathered plans may in fact be receiving contraceptive benefits without cost sharing because, though not required to do so, their plans may include such a benefit.\nAs an additional consideration, we do not wish to penalize the government for phasing in the ACA\u2019s requirements to help businesses adjust, to a new health care regulatory landscape. Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 746, 104 S.Ct. 1387, 79 L.Ed.2d 646 (1984) (\u201cWe have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting reasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an unconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time____The protection of reasonable reliance interests is ... a legitimate governmental objective.\u201d). Accordingly, even if the mandate and accommodation are phased in. over time, the gradual implementation is insufficient to undermine the government\u2019s compelling interest.\nSecond, the ACA\u2019s treatment of employers with 50 or fewer employees as exempt from the \u201cemployer mandate\u201d and therefore not required to provide employees with health insurance at all, see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H(a)(c)(2)(A), does not undercut' the government\u2019s compelling interests. \u2022 If, on the one hand, smaller employers do' not provide insurance coverage, then their employees'must purchase health plans on the health insurance \"exchanges or face tax penalties. See id. \u00a7 5000A(a), (b)(1). And plans purchased\" on the exchanges will include contraceptive coverage. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). If, on the other hand, smaller employers choose to provide health insurance, then their plans are subject to the contraceptive mandate. See id. The employees of small businesses therefore will receive contraceptive coverage regardless of whether their employers are exempt from providing health insurance. This exemption reflects a practical recognition\" that small businesses have different financial realities from larger businesses. It in no way undermines the government\u2019s interest in providing contraceptive coverage without cost sharing \"because small businesses\u2019 employees end up with health plans subject to the contraceptive mandate whether the employers provide health insurance or not.\nThird, the exemption from the contraceptive mandate for religious employers does not weaken the government\u2019s stated interests. Under the HRSA guidelines, the contraceptive mandate does not apply to a group health plan run by a religious employer, defined by the regulations as \u201can organization that is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(a). In finalizing the regulations, the Departments declined to extend the exemption to other *1157organizations that have religious objections to the mandate because:\nHouses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive coverage on religious grounds are more likely than other employers to employ people of the same faith who share the same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than other people to use contraceptive services even if such services were covered under their plan.\n78 Fed.Reg. at 39874.\nThe exemption for religious employers attempts to balance the need for contraceptive coverage with our nation\u2019s long-, standing-history of deferring to a house.' of worship\u2019s decisions about its internal affairs. See 76 Fed.Reg. at 46623 (\u201c[T]he Departments seek to provide for a religious accommodation that respects the unique relationship between a house of worship and its employees in ministerial positions.\u201d); see also Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church &amp; Sch. v. EEOC, - U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 694, 704-06, 181 L.Ed.2d 650 (2012) (describing history of non-interference with internal affairs of houses of worship). The government undoubtedly has a compelling interest in respecting the val\u00faes of religious employers and their employees, and pursuing that interest does not undermine the government\u2019s equally compelling interest in improving women\u2019s and the public\u2019s health by making contraceptives easier, to obtain. Especially with regard to sweeping legislation like the ACA,, the government is often faced with competing compelling interests. Courts may allow the government to balance those interests without undermining any individual compelling interest. See Hobby Lobby, 134 S.Ct. at 2780 (\u201cEven a compelling interest may be outweighed in some circumstances by another even weightier consideration.\u201d). \u2022 -\nWe also reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Departments\u2019 distinction between houses of worship (which are exempted from the mandate) and other organizations with religious affiliation (which must seek ah accommodation) is illogical. Although it may not universally hold true,40 it is a common-sense notion that a church\u2019s employees likely share more beliefs with the church than do the employees of, for example, a school linked to. that church, and therefore the employees, of a church that objects to contraception are less likely to use contraceptive coverage even if it is available. See 78 Fed.Reg. at 39874. Thus, the Departments distinguished between houses of worship and other religious groups using the readily available and. well-established IRS tax status test. This test is predictable for affected organizations and easy for the Departments to implement. See United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 260-61, 102 S.Ct. 1051, 71 L.Ed.2d 127 (1982) (noting it was reasonable for Congress to exempt self-employed Amish from Social Security taxes because the exemption for \u201cthe self-employed provided for a narrow category which was readily identifiable ... [and] distinguishable from the generality of wage earners employed by others\u201d). We do not think that the Departments\u2019 decision to exempt houses of worship based on a bright-line test while accommodating other religious organizations undercuts the government\u2019s compelling interests in enforcing the contraceptive mandate.\nIn sum, the mandate and accommodation further the government\u2019s compelling interests by ensuring that women have contraceptive coverage without cost, shar*1158ing. or additional administrative. hurdles. Additionally, by requiring organizations that opt out of the mandate to identify themselves, the government ensures that these organizations\u2019 health plan participants and beneficiaries can receive the coverage seamlessly through other channels. Although the government has attempted to accommodate religious freedom as well as the needs of businesses, it has not done so in a way that undermines its goal of ensuring access to contraception.\n(ii) The Mandate and Accommodation Are the Least Restrictive Means of Furthering the Government\u2019s Compelling Interests.\nAs a final step, we must determine whether the mandate and accommodation are \u201cthe least restrictive means of furthering\u201d the government\u2019s compelling interests. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(b). This test is \u201cexceptionally demanding.\u201d Hobby Lobby, 134 S.Ct. at 2780. The government must show \u201cthat it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion by the [plaintiffs].\u201d Id. When a less restrictive alternative serves the government\u2019s compelling interest \u201cequally well,\u201d the government must use that alternative. Id. at 2782; see id. at 2786 (Kennedy, J. concurring) (considering whether alternative \u201cequally furthers the Government\u2019s interest\u201d).\nIn determining whether potential alternatives to the mandate and accommodation equally further the government\u2019s interests, we must consider both the cost to the government and the burden the alternatives impose on the affected women. See id. at 2760 (majority opinion) (\u201c[W]e certainly do not hold or suggest that RFRA demands accommodation of a for-profit corporation\u2019s religious beliefs no matter the impact that accommodation may have on thousands of women employed by Hobby Lobby. The effect of the HHS-created accommodation on the women employed by Hobby Lobby and the other companies involved in these cases would be precisely zero.\u201d (emphasis added) (alteration, footnote, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted)); id. at 2760 (clarifying that the Court did not hold that \u201ccorporations have free rein to take steps that impose disadvantages on others or that require the general public to pick up the tab\u201d (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted)). Because there are no less restrictive means available that serve the government\u2019s interests equally well, we hold that the mandate and accommodation survive strict scrutiny under RFRA.\nAlthough the plaintiffs and the dissent suggest several potential less restrictive alternatives to the mandate and accommodation, their proposals fail to achieve the government\u2019s interests as effectively. Indeed, their proposals impose burdens on women that would make contraceptives less accessible than they currently are. Because these proposals cannot be expected to reduce the rate of unintended pregnancies and thereby improve the health of women and children as effectively as the mandate and accommodation, they do not qualify as less restrictive alternatives under RFRA.\nPreviously, the Supreme Court and a member of this Court suggested that \u00e1 less restrictive alternative would be to allow eligible organizations to notify HHS of their opt out, instead of having to provide Form 700 to their plan providers or TPAs. See Wheaton Coll., 134 S.Ct. at 2807; Eternal Word Television Network, 756 F.3d at 1349 (William Pryor, J., concurring) (\u201cThe United States, for example, could require the Network to provide a written notification of its religious objection to the Department of Health and Human Services, instead of requiring the *1159Network to submit Form 700 \u2014 an instrument under which the health insurance plan is operated \u2014 to the third-party administrator.\u201d). The Departments have responded to and addressed this concern by revising the accommodation procedures to allow eligible organizations notify HHS directly of their desire to opt out of the contraceptive mandate. 79 Fed.Reg. at 51094-95. With that potential alternative incorporated into the regulatory scheme, we turn to the alternatives proposed .by the plaintiffs and the dissent.\n(a) The Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposals\nThe plaintiffs propose two less restrictive, alternatives. First, they suggest that the government could pay directly for all contraceptive coverage, in effect a single-payer system for contraceptives only,41 either by creating a new government program or expanding an existing one.42 Either way Congress would need to pass legislation that would ..fundamentally change how the majority of American women receive their healthcare coverage for contraception.43 See Jessica C. Smith &amp; Carla Medalia, U.S. Census Bureau, Health Insurance. Coverage in the U.S.: 2014 at 3 (2015) (55% of Americans had insurance coverage provided, by an employer in 2014). Among other things, adopting a single-payer system for contraception would require Congress to squeeze insurance companies out of an entire segment of the health insurance business.44 Second, the plaintiffs assert that the government could provide tax credits to reimburse women for purchasing contraceptive coverage.45 Under either the single-payer or tax credit proposals, all coverage for contraception and related services would *1160operate outside the existing, largely employer-based, insurance system.\nMost importantly, these proposals ar\u00e9 not less restrictive alternatives because they, would not serve the government\u2019s interests \u201cequally well.\u201d46 Hobby Lobby, 134 S.Ct. at 2782. As'the Departments explain, these proposals would cause all women who have existing contraceptive coverage through group health insurance plans to lose such coverage, forcingthem instead to \u201ctake steps to learn about, and to sign up for, a new health benefit.\u201d 78 Fed.Reg. at 39888. Indeed, under these proposals, women would have one employer-provided health insurance plan covering healthcare Other than' contraception. Then, they would have to take addition\u00e1l, separate steps to secure- contraceptives or contraceptive coverage. Under a single-payer system for contraceptives, they would have to research the federal entitlement for contraceptives and register for the program. Under a tax-credit system, they would have to research plans offering separate contraceptive coverage, select a plan, purchase coverage, and later file for a tax credit as part of their individual tax returns.47 Th\u00e9 mandate and accommodation present an easier, simpler, and more certain path for women by ensuring that, by obtaining health insurance, they also secure contraceptive coverage, even when their employers opt out.\nBecause plaintiffs\u2019' proposals impose greater barriers \u25a0 to contraceptive access than exist under the mandate and accommodation, their proposals likely will lead to lower rates of contraceptive usage (along with use of less effective forms of contraception), meaning these proposals will be less effective at preventing unintended pregnancies and concomitant health consequences.48 See IOM Report at 104-09; Foster, supra, at 566 (reflecting that when obtaining contraceptives became less convenient, the rate of unintended pregnancy increased); see also 78 Fed.Reg. at 39888 (recognizing that these proposals would be \u201cless effective than the employer-based system of health coverage in advancing the government\u2019s compelling interests\u201d).\nPlaintiffs\u2019 proposals would make contraception less accessible not only to women who currently receive contraceptive coverage through a group insurance plan, but *1161also to women who currently purchase health insurance through the exchanges, including women who work for an employer with fewer than 50 fuE-time employees. Under the current framework, these women must research and compare potential health insurance plans sold on the exchanges and then purchase and sign up for a plan. As a result of their efforts, they receive health insurance that includes contraceptive coverage. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4). Under the. plaintiffs\u2019 proposals, these women would stiE-have to procure health insurance from the exchanges. But then they would have to take the additional steps described above to obtain coverage for contraceptives. In other words, women who currently' purchase insurance through the- exchanges would also face greater burdens accessing contraceptives under a single-payer system.49\n*1162After careful consideration, we conclude that the government has shown that contraceptives would be less accessible \u2014 and used less frequently or effectively \u2014 under the plaintiffs\u2019 proposals then they are under the mandate and- accommodation. Given the government\u2019s compelling interest in minimizing the barriers women face in accessing contraceptives so that they will use contraceptives to lower the rate of unintended pregnancies, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 proposals would not serve the government\u2019s interest equally as well as the mandate and accommodation. Thus, they fail to qualify as less restrictive alternatives. \u25a0\nThe dissent criticizes our position as giving the Departments a \u201cfree pass\u201d on the least restrictive means requirement. Dissent at 1193. ' Our dissenting colleague takes our analysis to mean that the government can defeat a potential alternative merely by showing that the alternative would take away a benefit \u2014 any benefit\u2014 that the government\u2019s existing framework provides to \u201cthird parties\u201d (here, the women who are the intended beneficiaries of the mandate and accommodation). Id. at 1189-90. The dissent overstates our position. We are not saying that the government can.always overcome strict scrutiny by showing that proposed 'alternatives would take away a benefit that the current framework provides. Rather, on the facts and record of this case \u2014 including the evidence that when women face greater burdens (whether financial or administrative) in accessing contraceptives or contraceptive coverage, they are less likely to use contraceptives \u2014 we must conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 alternatives, which make contraceptives less accessible, would 'be significantly less effective than the mandate and accommodation at reducing the rate of unintended pregnancies and thus would thwart the government\u2019s interests.50\n(b) The Dissent\u2019s Proposal\nThe dissent suggests that Congress could \u201cslightly tweak\u201d the ACA and ERISA to \u201celiminate the need for eligible organizations to affirmatively designate the third-party administrators of their health plans.\u201d Dissent at 1192. We understand the dissent\u2019s proposal to be that Congress should pass legislation and the Departments should enact regulations that would designate the TPA for a self-insured eligible organization as plan administrator for purposes of contraceptive coverage without requiring the eligible organization to communicate its .religious objection to anyone.\n*1163The dissent\u2019s proposal fails .to serve the government\u2019s interest equally as well as the accommodation because the alternative would make contraceptives less accessible to women covered by eligible organizations\u2019 plans than would the accommodation. The dissent fails to explain \u2014 and we cannot imagine \u2014 how a TPA would know when an employer has a religious objection to providing contraceptive coverage under the proposal and thus that the' TPA is required to provide the coverage in the employer\u2019s stead if the employer is not required to notify anyone. Like the TPAs, the government must also be able to identify women whose employers object on religious grounds to providing Contraceptive coverage. Otherwise, the government will be unable to ensure that the participants and beneficiaries of the abstaining organization\u2019s health insurance plan receive the coverage the law mandates. Without an effective way to identify any gaps, the government would be hamstrung in. its ability to accommodate employers\u2019 sincerely held religious beliefs while also pursuing the interests that Congress intended to achieve in passing the Women\u2019s Health Amendment.51\nThe dissent\u2019s proposal would create gaps or delays in contraceptive coverage for plan participants and beneficiaries of eligible organizations that refuse to provide contraceptive coverage or tell anyone of their objection. Until the insured, the TPA, or HHS learned of the silent omission of contraceptive coverage, these women would be denied the contraceptive coverage to which they are irrefutably entitled. During this period, such eligible organizations would, in effect, be imposing their religious beliefs on women who wish to take advantage of their rights under federal law. These gaps in contraceptive coverage would frustrate the government\u2019s interests. Because the dissent\u2019s proposal substantially burdens religious exercise and fails to meet the government\u2019s compelling interests, it cannot constitute a less restrictive alternative.52\n*1164We hold that, even if the accommodation substantially burdens the plaintiffs\u2019 religious exercise, it does not violate RFRA because it is the least restrictive means of furthering the government\u2019s compelling interests in the contraceptive mandate.\nB. EWTN\u2019S Free Exercise Claims\nPlaintiff-appellant EWTN additionally claims that the contraceptive mandate violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court\u2019s Smith decision continues to apply to Free Exercise claims outside of the RFRA context; thus, neutral and generally applicable laws need not be justified by any compelling interest even if those laws incidentally burden religious exercise. Smith, 494 U.S. at 885, 110-S.Ct. 1595. A law is neutral unless \u201cthe object of a law is to infringe upon br restrict practices because of their religious motivation.\u201d Lukumi Babalu Aye, 508 U.S. at 533, 113 S.Ct. 2217. And a law is generally applicable if it does not \u201cin a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief.\u201d Id. at 543, 113 S.Ct. 2217. \u201cA law failing to satisfy these requirements must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance that interest.\u201d Id. at 531-32, 113 S.Ct. 2217. But if a law indeed is neutral and generally applicable, \u201cthen rational basis scrutiny should be applied, requiring that the plaintiff show that there.is not a legitimate government, interest or that the-law is not rationally related to protect that interest.\u201d GeorgiaCarry.Org, Inc. v. Georgia, 687 F.3d 1244, 1255 n. 21 (11th Cir.2012).\nCongress, included the contraceptive mandate in the ACA to improve women\u2019s health and public health generally. There is no evidence whatsoever that the mandate was enacted in an attempt to restrict religious exercise. To the contrary, in implementing the contraceptive mandate the Departments have attempted to accommodate religious interests by granting exceptions for' religious employers and those *1165organizations with religious objections to providing contraceptive coverage. EWTN nonetheless argues that the mandate is non-neutral because the exemption and accommodation \u201cdiscriminate! ] among religious objectors, creating a three-tiered system.\u201d EWTN Appellant Br, at 54! But the regulations do not discriminate between religious denominations or infringe upon or restrict conduct because of its religious motivation. Rather, the procedures distinguish among organizations on the basis of their tax status. Thus EWTN has failed to show that the mandate is non-neutral.\nEWTN also argues that the mandate is not generally applicable because the ACA carves out small employers and grandfathered plans. For the same reasons we rejected this argument as it pertains to the plaintiffs\u2019 RFRA claim, we reject it here. Just as these exceptions do not undermine the government\u2019s compelling interests justifying the contraceptive mandate, they do not prevent the mandate from being generally applicable as defined by Lmkumi Bdbalu Aye. The exceptions for small businesses and grandfathered plans apply equally to religious employers and nonreligious employers. The exceptions in no way \u201cimpose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief.\u201d Lukumi Babalu Aye, 508 U.S. at 543, 113 S.Ct. 2217.\nBecause the contraceptive mandate is neutral and generally applicable, to invalidate it the plaintiff must show that is it not rationally related to a legitimate government interest. See GeorgiaCarry.Org, 687 F.3d at 1255 n. 21. EWTN cannot make such a showing. We have already concluded that the government has a compelling (and therefore legitimate) interest in ensuring women have access to contraceptives without cost sharing. See swpra Part III.A.2.c.(i). The mandate is clearly rationally related to that interest and thus passes muster under the Free Exercise Clause.\nC. EWTN\u2019S Establishment Clause Claim\nEWTN next argues that the contraceptive mandate violates the Establishment Clause lay discriminating among religious 'Organizations. Specifically, EWTN objects to .the way the exemption and accommodation -distinguish between houses of worship and other types of religious organizations. As an initial matter, the Supreme Court \u201chas long recognized that the government may (and sometimes must) accommodate .religious practices and that it may do so, without violating the Establishment Clause.\u201d Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm\u2019n of Fla., 480 U.S. 136, 144-145, 107 S.Ct. 1046, 94 L.Ed.2d 190 (1987); see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 83, 105 S.Ct. 2479, 86 L.Ed.2d 29 (1985) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (\u201cIt is disingenuous to look for a purely secular purpose -when the manifest objective of a statute is to facilitate the free exercise of religion by lifting a government-imposed burden. Instead, the Court should simply acknowledge that the religious purpose of such a statute is legitimated by the Free Exercise Clause.\u201d).\nLike its' claim based on the Free Exercise Clause, EWTN\u2019s Establishment Clause claim fails because the accommodation does not distinguish among religious groups on the basis of denomination, but rather on non-denominational attributes of an objecting organization. The accommodation relies on tax status, which is a permissible way to distinguish between organizations for the purpose of drafting a religious exemption. \u201c[R]eligious . \u00e9mployers, defined as in the cited regulation, have long enjoyed advantages (notably tax advantages) over other entities,1 without these advantages being thought to violate the *1166establishment clause.\u201d Geneva Coll., 778 F.3d at 443 (alteration in original and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n of N.Y., 397 U.S. 664, 666, 672-73, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970) (upholding a tax exemption on social welfare services that churches performed and emphasizing that \u201c[t]h\u00e9 limits of permissible state accommodation to religion are by no means co-extensive with the noninterference mandated by the Free Exercise Clause.\u201d). We therefore reject EWTN\u2019s Establishment Clause challenge.\nD. EWTN\u2019S Free Speech Claim\nLastly, EWTN contends that the contraceptive mandate violates the Free Speech Clause by compelling the organization to speak in order'to avail itself of the accommodation.53 \u201c[T]he right of freedom of thought protected by the First Amendment against state action includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.\u201d Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977). In Wooley, the plaintiff objected to the slogan on New Hampshire\u2019s license plate: \u201cLive Free or Die.\u201d Id. at 707-08, 97 S.Ct. 1428. He argued that by criminalizing his efforts to cover up the slogan, the government forced him to express a message contrary to his beliefs. . The Supreme Court agreed that the license plate was forced speech. The Court then applied United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968), to hold that the government\u2019s stated interest in identifying passenger cars was not sufficiently compelling because passenger cars could be identified in other ways. Id. at 715-17, 97 S.Ct. 1428.\nAssuming, arguendo, that the act of filling out Form 700 or notifying HHS implicates the Free Speech Clause, this Court must ask whether the government\u2019s \u201ccountervailing interest is sufficiently compelling to justify\u201d the forced speech. Id. at 716, 97 S.Ct. 1428. Our disposition of the plaintiffs\u2019 RFRA claims decides the issue. Because the government has a compelling interest in ensuring that women have access to contraceptive care without additional financial or administrative burden, it may force the plaintiffs to speak simply to opt out of the mandate.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWe hold that the accommodation for the contraceptive mandate does not violate RFRA because it does not substantially burden the plaintiffs\u2019 religious exercise and because the government\u2019s regulatory scheme is the least restrictive means of furthering its compelling interests. The regulations also do not violate the Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment. With regard to EWTN, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the government. With regard to CENGI and Catholic Charities, we vacate the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 RFRA claim and remand to the district court with instructions to grant the government\u2019s summary judgment motion.\nThe question of whether the mandate and accommodation violate RFRA is currently before the Supreme Court in Zubik v. Burwell, Nos. 14-1376 and 14-1377, and other consolidated cases. The Supreme Court will hold oral argument in these cases on March 23, 2016. Because the Supreme Court will soon render a decision addressing this issue, we believe it is appropriate to stay enforcement of the *1167mandate and accommodation against the plaintiffs until the Supreme Court issues a decision. Accordingly, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is enjoined from enforcing against EWTN, Catholic Charities, and CENGI the substantive requirements set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4) and from assessing fines or taking other enforcement action against EWTN, Catholic Charities, or CENGI for non-compliance. The parties are directed to file a notice with this Court once the Supreme Court has issued its decision in Zubik'.\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\nAPPENDIX: FORM 700\n[[Image here]]\nI certify the organization is an eligible organization (as described in 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A(a), 29 CFR 2590.715-2713A(a); 45 CFR 147.131(b)) that has a religious objection to providing' coverage for some or all of any contraceptive services that would otherwise be required to be covered.\nNote: An organization; that offers coverage through the same group health plan as a religious employer (as defined in 45 CFR 147.131(a)) and/or an eligible organization (as defined in 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A(a); 29 CFR 2590.715-2713 A(a); 45 CFR 147.131(b)), and that is part of the same controlled group of corporations as, or under common control with, such employer and/or organization (within the meaning of section 52(a) or (b) of the Internal Revenue Code), is considered to meet the requirements of 26 CFR 54.9815-2713 A(a)(3), 29 CFR 2590.715-2713 A(a)(3), and 45 CFR 147.131(b)(3).\n\nI declare that I have made this certification, and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, it is true and correct.

To be concise, whenever possible we cite only to the regulations issued by HHS, codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 147, and not to the corresponding identical regulations issued by the Departments of Labor and the Treasury.\n\n\n. Under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(b), an organiz\u00e1tion is eligible for the accommodation if:\n(1) The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive items or services required to be covered under \u00a7 147.130(a)(l)(iv) on account of religious objections.\n(2) (i) The organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and holds itself out as a religious organization; or\n(ii) The organization is organized and operates as a closely held for-profit entity, as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section,' and the 'organization\u2019s highest governing body (such as its board of directors, board of trustees, or owners, if managed directly by its owners) has adopted a resolution or similar action, under the organization\u2019s applicable rules of governance and consistent with state law, establishing that if objects to\ncovering some or all of the contraceptive services oh account'of the owners\u2019 sincerely held religious beliefs.\n(3) The organization must self-certify in the , form and manner specified by the Secretary of Labor or provide notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The organization must make such self-certification or notice available for examination upon request by the first \u25a0\u25a0 day of,the first plan year to which the accommodation in paragraph (c) of this section applies. The self-certification or notice must be executed by a person authorized to make the certification or notice on behalf of the organization, and must be maintained in a manner consistent with the record retention requirements under section 107 of ERISA.\n\n\n. Form 700 is included as the appendix to this opinion.\n\n\n. For insured health plans, the employer contracts with an insurance company that administers the group plan and pays' claims. For self-insured plans, the financial risk of providing health insurance lies with the organization itself; the organization directly pays for the plan participants\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 claims. Usually, organizations with self-insured plans, hire a third -party to handle administrative tasks, such as developing provider networks and processing claims.\n\n\n.The Seventh Circuit recently resolved Whea-ton\" College\u2019s appeal, affirming the district court\u2019s denial of the college's request for a preliminary injunction. Wheaton Coll. v. Burwell, 791 F.3d 792 (7th Cir.2015).\n\n\n. The interim final regulations also removed a provision (known as the non-interference provision) requiring that eligible organizations \" 'must not, directly or indirectly!,] seek to interfere with .a third party administrator's arrangements to provide or arrange for separate payments for contraceptive services,\u2019 and 'must not, directly or indirectly, seek to influence a third party administrator\u2019s decision to make any such arrangements.\u2019 \u201d 79 Fed.Reg. at 51095 (quoting 26, C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2713A(b)(1)(iii); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2590.715-2713A(b)(1)(iii)).\n\n\n. If the TPA terminates the relationship, the organization must (1) contract with a new TPA to administer its self-insured plan, (2) convert to an insured plan by contracting with a plan provider, or (3) administer the plan itself. If the eligible organization contracts with a new TPA, then it remains subject to the mandate and must provide contraceptive coverage, seek an accommodation, or pay a penalty. Alternatively, the organization could restructure its .plan and contract with a plan provider that would assume the risk of providing health insurance (that is, change from a self-insured to an insured plan). In this scenario, the organization would have to comply with the mandate, seek an accommodation, or pay a penalty. Finally, the organization could continue with its self-insured *1135plan without a TPA, meaning the organization would assume responsibility for administering claims. Although the Departments are unaware of the existence of a single self-insured plan without a TPA, they have created a safe harbor that excuses such a plan from complying with the contraceptive mandate so long as it annually notifies HHS that- it has no TPA and plan participants and beneficiaries that contraceptive coverage is not provided. The Departments will' provide this' safe harbor while considering an additional accommodation. 78 Fed.Reg. at 39880-81.\n\n\n. Self-insured plans run by houses of worship and certain organizations controlled by or associated with a house of worship, known as \"church plans,\u201d are not subject to the provisions of ERISA unless they elect otherwise. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 410(d), 414(e). The government lacks authority to compel the TPA of a church plan not subject to ERISA to \u2019 provide contraceptive coverage. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003(b)(2). Nonetheless, the TPA for a church plan may voluntarily provide contraceptive services; the government in-centivizes these TPAs to provide the coverage by offering' larger reimbursements. See 80 Fed.Reg. at 41323 n. 22; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 156.50(d).\n\n\n. The government reimburses plan providers and TPAs for providing contraception benefits. Plan providers receive a downward adjustment to the user fees they must pay to the federal government to sell plans on the federally-facilitated- health exchanges. The process for TPAs can be:more complicated. If.the TPA is not itself a participating insurer, then it must contract for contraceptive coverage with a participating insurer, and the insurer then passes on the reimbursement to the TPA. See 80 Fed.Reg. at 41328.\n\n\n. Alabama was a party throughout the district court proceedings, but the State did not join EWTN in this appeal.\n\n\n. The parties disagree over whether these health plans qualify as \"church plans\" for \u2022purposes of ERISA. We need not decide whether the plans at issue are church plans because their ERISA status does not impact our conclusion that the accommodation does not substantially burden religious exercise.1 If the plans -are not church plans, then our analysis as to EWTN\u2019s self-insured plan applies, and the accommodation presents no burden on religiohs exercise. See infra Part III.A.2.b. If the plans are church plans, then the government lacks authority to enforce the contraceptive mandate against the plaintiffs' TPAs, rendering the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that their actions trigger such coverage even weaker. See, e.g., Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell, 794 F.3d 1151, 1188 (10th Cir.) (\"The lack--of enforcement- authority makes any burden on plaintiffs with church plans even less substantial than the burden on plaintiffs with self-insured plans that are subject to ERISA\"), cert. granted sub nom., S. Nazarene Univ. v. Burwell, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 445, 193 L.Ed.2d 346, and cert. granted, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 446, 193 L.Ed.2d 346 (2015).\n\n\n. The non-delegation doctrine is the constitutional principle that prevents Congress from delegating its legislative authority to another body with \"unfettered discretion to make whatever laws\u201d the body sees fit.\u2019 A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 537-38, 55 S.Ct. 837, 79 L.Ed. 1570 (1935).\n\n\n. We note that there is no dispute that - EWTN, CENGI, and Catholic Charities qualify .for- the accommodation and not for the religious employer exemption.\n\n\n. As noted above, in 2014 the Departments removed the regulations\u2019 requirement that organizations \u201cmust not, directly or indirectly, seek, to influence the third party administrator\u2019s decision to\u201d provide contraceptive coverage to the objecting organization\u2019s health plan participants and beneficiaries. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2713A(b)(1)(iii) (2013); see 79 Fed.Reg. at 51095; supra note 9.\n\n\n. The majority opinion assumed without deciding that the government, has \u00e1 compelling interest. In separate opinions, five members of the Court appeared to- go further, suggesting that a majority of the Court would agree that there is, in 'fact, '- a compelling interest;\nThe four dissenting justices concluded that the government carried its burden in showing that the mandate \"furthers compelling interests in public health and women\u2019s well being.\u201d Hobby Lobby, 134 S.Ct. at 2799 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); Justice Kennedy, who joined the majority, offered a separate concurrence in which he emphasized the importance of the-majority's' assumption that there is a compelling interest without explicitly stating that he agreed with that premise: \u201c[it is] important to confirm that a premise of the Court\u2019s opinion is its assumption that- the HHS regulation here at issue furthers a legitimate \u00e1nd compelling interest in the health of female employees.\u201d Id. at 2786 (Kennedy, j., concurring). He also reiterated the government\u2019s position that the mandate \"provid[ed] insurance coverage that is necessary to protect the health of female employees, coverage that is significantly more costly than for a male employee.\u201d Id at 2785-86.\nJustice Ginsburg in her dissent and other, courts have treated Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurrence as recognizing that, the government has a compelling interest. See id. at 2800 n. 23 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (writing that Justice Kennedy \"rec\u00f3gnize[d], without reservation,\u201d the existence of a compelling interest); Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 786 F.3d 606, 624 (7th Cir.2015). (Hamilton, J., concurring) (\"Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion made clear that he viewed the governmental inter-\u00e9sts as compelling.\u201d); Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., 772 F.3d 229, 257 (D.C.Cir.2014) (explaining why Justice Kennedy\u2019s .concurrence was \u201cmore affirmative\u201d than the majority opinion in recognizing a compelling interest), cert. granted sub nom., Roman Catholic Archbishop of Wash. v. Burwell, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 444, 193 L.Ed.2d 345 (2015), and cert. granted, \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 446, 193 L.Ed.2d 345 (2015). W\u00e9 are inclined to agree that Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion can be read as recognizing a compelling interest. Nonetheless, even if Justice Kennedy merely assumed (but did not decide) there is a compelling interest, such that a majority of the Supreme Court has not reached that conclusion, we conclude that there is a compelling, interest here. See infra,Part III.B.2.c.(i),\n\n\n. Justice Kennedy praised how the accommodation reconciled the competing priorities of ensuring that \"no person may be restricted or demeaned by government in exercising his or her religion\u201d and that the same exercise does not \u201cunduly restrict other persons ... in protecting their own interests, interests the law deems compelling.\u201d Hobby Lobby, 134 S.Ct. at 2786-87 (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\n\n. Before Hobby Lobby was decided, the. Seventh Circuit affirmed the denial .of a preliminary injunction to enjoin the enforcement of the mandate and accommodation in University of Notre Dame v. Sebelius (\u201cNotre Dame I\"), 743 F.3d 547 (7th Cir.2014). Subsequently, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated the Seventh Circuit\u2019s judgment in Notre Dame I, and remanded for consideration in light of Hobby Lobby. Univ. of Notre Dame v. Burwell, \u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1528, 191 L.Ed.2d 557 (2015). After considering Hobby Lobby, the Seventh Circuit issued Notre Dame II again affirming the denial of a preliminary injunction.\n\n\n. Two circuits have held, in the alternative, that even assuming the accommodation imposes a substantial burden, it survives strict scrutiny under RFRA. See Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 616-17; Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 256-57.\n\n\n. Although the Eighth Circuit deferred to the plaintiffs' understanding of how the accommodation functioned, it agreed that the act of opting out triggered coverage. See Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 942 (TPAs have no \u201cwholly independent obligation\u201d to provide contraceptive coverage).\n\n\n., . Midrash concerned the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\"RLUI-PA\u201d), which Congress enacted after the Supreme Court struck down RFRA as applied to the states in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 138 L.Ed.2d 624.(1997). RLUIPA imposes the same requirement as RFRA\u2014that the government refrain from substantially burdening religious exercise unless the burden is the least-restrictive means of achieving a compelling government interest\u2014 on programs and activities that receive federal funding. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-1. We apply the same substantial burden analysis under both RLUIPA and RFRA. See generally Davila, 777 F.3d at 1204; Midrash, 366 F.3d at 1237.\n\n\n. The Eighth' Circuit similarly interpreted Hobby Lobby as requiring courts to \"accept , [the plaintiffs'] assertion that self-certification und,er the accommodation process ... would violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 941.\n\n\n. We agree with the dissent that the plaintiffs have a fourth option,' as well: to terminate their TPAs and take over the costs and responsibilities of .running their. ,s,elf-insured plans. See Dissent at 1177-78. But, the Departments contend there is no evidence of the existence of any self-insured plan without a TPA. See 78 Fed.Reg.' at 39880 [T]he Departments continue to believe that there are no self-insured group health plans in this circumstance.\u201d). If an, eligible organization elected to become the first self-insured plan without a TPA, it would enjoy at least a temporary safe harbor so long as the plan notifies '(1) HHS that it has no TPA and (2) pMn participants arid beneficiaries that the plan provides no. benefits for contraceptive services. Id.\n\u25a0 We assume for purposes of this- appeal that if the government forced an eligible organization to have a self-insured.plan without a TPA, it would be imposing a substantial burden. Nonetheless, we conclude there is no substantial burden because eligible organizations can , instead select the accommodation.\n\n\n.We reiterate that in Hobby Lobby the Supreme Court did not grapple with this aspect of the substantial burden analysis. But it was plain that the action required of the plaintiffs in that case \u2014 paying to provide health insurance that included contraceptive coverage\u2014 imposed a substantial burden.- Accordingly; the Court had no occasion to address the more difficult question presented here, where the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of substantial burden rest on their assertion that seeking an accommodation results in another entity (the TP A) providing contraceptive coverage and thus makes them complicit in a system that achieves an end to which they have a religious objection. In other words, Hobby Lobby did not pose the issue whether courts must defer to a religious adherent\u2019s assertion that seeking an accommodation (opting out) itself imposes \u00e1 substantial burden.\n\n\n. Congress used \u201csubstantial burden\" instead of \"burden\u201d in order \u201cto clarify [that] the compelling interest required by the Religious Freedom [Restoration] Act applies only where there is a substantial burden placed on the individual free exercise of religion.\u201d 139 Cong, Rec. S14352 (daily ed. Oct. 26, 1993) (statement of Sen. Hatch) (emphasis added). Limiting RFRA\u2019s application to substantial , burdens was intended to ensure that the gov- . ernment was not required \u201cto justify every action that has some effect on religious exercise.\u201d Id.\n\n\n. Our dissenting colleague worries that our framework creates a \u201cBizarro World\u201d in *1148which courts determine whether the burden imposed by a law or regulation violates the adherent's beliefs. Dissent at 1180-81. The dissent overstates our position. We are not saying that courts may determine that when a - prison requires a Muslim inmate to shave his beard or the government forces a Seventh-Day Adventist to work on the Sabbath, the religious adherent\u2019s claim that the government is coercing him to forego his religious precepts is wrong. But when a dispute exists about whether the challenged governmental policy actually requires an inmate to shave his beard or a person to work on Saturday, it is for the courts to determine what the law requires. See, e.g., Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 403-04, 83 S.Ct. 1790 (Supreme Court performed its own analysis to determine whether challenged policy compelled Seventh-Day Adventist to work on Saturdays). Likewise, when a religious adherent challenges an accommodation scheme as imposing a substantial burden \u25a0 on the religious adherent based on \u25a0 subsequent actions \u25a0 taken by the government or third parties, it is for the courts to determine whether the burden is substantial.\n\n\n. Because the plaintiffs here have only self-insured plans, we consider only the accommodation procedures that apply to self-insured health plans. .\nFor an eligible organization with a plan insured by a third party, the accommodation imposes no new coverage obligation. The eligible organization\u2019s act of opting out simply makes the coverag\u00e9 the plan provider\u2019s \u201csole responsibility rather than one shared with the group health\" plan itself.\u201d Little Sisters of the Poor, 794 F.3d at 1181.\n\n\n. The dissent complains that our reading renders the act of opting out \"meaningless.\u201d Dissent at 1188 (internal quotation marks omitted). The dissent misses our point, Although plan participants and beneficiaries are entitled to contraceptive coverage under federal law regardless of any opt out, notification of the opt out allows the government to identify the plan participants and beneficiaries who will not receive contraceptive coverage from a self-insured eligible organization because of that organization\u2019s religious objection to the mandate. In other words, the act of opting out aids the government in identifying these women and making sure that' they receive the contraceptive coverage to'which, \u2019they are legally' entitled. 'Thus, the act of opting out has significance in the regulatory ' scheme, but not because it creates a woman\u2019s entitlement to contraceptive coverage.\n\n\n. Indeed, the government has admitted that an eligible organization\u2019s opt out results in a TPA\u2019s designation as plan administrator and the -TPA providing plan participants and beneficiaries contraceptive benefits. - \u25a0 \u25a0\n\n\n. The plaintiffs argue that under the accommodation they are facilitating access to contraceptives because their ongoing contractual relationship with their TPA leads the TPA to continue to provide contraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries. It is true that a TPA remains as plan administrator for purposes of contraceptive coverage only so long as the organization serves as the plan\u2019s TPA. Nonetheless, the plaintiffs cannot show a substantial burden because, as explained above, their challenge is an objection to the TPA\u2019s subsequent conduct.\n\n\n. The dissent dismisses Bowen as distinguishable because the plaintiffs here object only to their own participation in the accommodation, not to any acts taken by the government. See Dissent at 1187-88 n. 32. We are not persuaded. The dissent\u2019s position ignores that the plaintiffs object to opting out because it requires them to play a causal role (albeit, a small one) in a system in which the government requires contraceptive coverage. Put another way, their religious objection is, at its core, an objection to the government requiring the TPAs to provide coverage upon their opting out.\n\n\n. As we explained above, the majority in Hobby Lobby assumed without deciding that there was a compelling governmental interest. There is, however, an argument that five justices concluded there was a compelling interest. See supra note 18. But even if Justice Kennedy\u2019s concurring opinion in Hobby Lobby did not recognize a compelling governmental interest, we would hold that the compelling interest test is satisfied here.\nWe acknowledge that- the majority opinion in Hobby Lobby criticized the government\u2019s purported interests in \"promoting public health and gender equality\u201d as \"broadly framed.\u201d 134 S.Ct. at 2779 (internal quotation marks omitted). But we agree with the D.C. Circuit that the government has now provided a more focused analysis \"by explaining how those larger interests inform and are specifically implicated in its decision to support women's unhindered access to contraceptive coverage.\u201d Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 259.\n\n\n. Many contraceptives also carry significant positive health side effects. \"[T]he non-contraceptive benefits of hormonal contraception include treatment of menstrual disorders, acne of hirsutism, and pelvic pain. Long-term use of oral contraceptives has been shown to reduce a woman\u2019s risk of endome-trial cancer, as well as protect against pelvic inflammatory disease and some benign breast diseases.\u201d IOM Report at 107 (internal citations omitted).\n\n\n. See also 155 Cong. Rec. S11987 (statement of Sen. Mikulski) (\u201cWomen are often faced with the punitive practices of insurance .companies, No. 1 is gender discrimination. Women often pay more and get. less. For many insurance companies, simply being a woman is a preexisting condition.... We pay more because of our gender, anywhere from 2 \u2022percent to over 100 percent.\u201d).\n\n\n. We acknowledge that the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby expressly declined to.decide whether the accommodation violated RFRA. Nonetheless, our analysis is consistent with the Court\u2019s dicta.\n\n\n. The government\u2019s evidence further shows that when contraception is easily accessible, women not only use it more often, they select more effective methods of contraception. In research studies, \"when out-of-pocket costs for contraceptives were eliminated or reduced, women were more likely to rely on . more effective long-acting contraceptive methods.\" IOM Report at 109. These methods include intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants, which are long-lasting and .have the additional advantage of not being dependent on user compliance. See Birth *1154Control Methods Fact Sheet, Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Hum. Servs., Office on Women\u2019s Health, http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/ our-publications/fact-sheet/birth-control-methods.html (July 16, 2012) (showing that implants and intrauterine devices have a failure rate of less than 1 percent, compared to 5 percent for oral contraceptives and 11 to 16 percent for'male condoms).\nThese longer-acting contraceptive methods have been underutilized in the United States compared to other developed countries where unintended pregnancy rates are lower, Jeffrey F. Peipert, et al., Preventing Unintended Pregnancies by Providing No-Cost Contraception, Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, Dec. 2012, at 1291, nt large part because they pose higher upfront costs that discourage use. See IOM Report at 108. \u25a0 Evidence shows that women\u2019s use of long-acting contraceptive methods easily can be increased by making the methods cheaper and more readily available. In a study that provided intrauterine devices and implanted contraceptives at no cost to study participants, researchers found a significant decrease in unintended pregnancy and abortion rates in the study population. The study concluded that \"[u]nintended pregnancies may be reduced by providing no-cost contraception and promoting the most effective contraceptive methods.\u201d See Peipert, supra, at 1291.\n\n\n. We acknowledge that the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s 2015 data shows that 25% of covered workers are enrolled in a grandfathered plan, which is not much less than the 26% in 2014. But the Foundation reported that many employers were confused and unsure about, whether their plans remained grandfathered, suggesting that employers may have inaccurately reported that they had grandfathered plans. Kaiser Family Found., supra, at 214.\n\n\n. EWTN in particular argues that the 'Departments\u2019 distinction between houses of worship and other religious organizations is illog\u2019ical and does not hold for EWTN because, like employees of \"religious employers,\u201d its employees-share its religious convictions.\n\n\n. In a single-payer system, the government\u2014 as opposed to employers, health insurers, or patients \u2014 pays for healthcare services. See Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 615; Single-Payer, Merriam Webster Dictionary, http://www. merriam-webster.com/dictionary/single-payer (last visited Feb. 12, 2016). Although the plaintiffs never call their proposal a' \u201csingle-payer\u201d system for contraceptives, the label applies because they propose a system in which the government would be the sole payer for contraceptives and related services. It is important to note that all other health care would continue to be provided through, our existing system,\n\n\n. The plaintiffs suggest, for \u2019 example, that Congress could \u00e9xpand 'Title X, which currently benefits only low-income families; patients whose income exceeds 250 percent of the poverty level must pay for any services they receive through Title X programs. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300a-4(c); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 59.5(a)(8).\n\n\n. In Hobby Lobby, the government argued that RFRA.does not permit the court to consider proposals that would require the government to create entirely new programs as less restrictive alternatives. The Court rejected this argument, explaining \"we see nothing in RFRA that supports this argument.\u201d Hobby Lobby, 134 S.Ct. at 2781. Accordingly, we consider this proposal even though it would require substantial congressional action to expand significantly an existing program or create a new one.\n\n\n. We may, of cqurse, consider the burdens that a proposed alternative' places on nonbe-neficiaries, such as insurance companies. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 720-722, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005) (\"[Ajpplying RLUIPA, courts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested accommodation may impose on nonbenefici-aries---- Our decisions indicate that an accommodation must be measured so that it does not override other significant interests.\u201d).\n\n\n. The plaintiffs suggest the government could require women to purchase separate contraceptive coverage on the healthcare exchanges and then offer tax credits to offset the cost of purchasing the coverage. This proposal would require Congress to amend the ACA because the exchanges are statutorily restricted to selling only full health insurance policies. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18021(a)(1)(B), 18022(a), (b).\n\n\n. We acknowledge dicta in Hobby Lobby suggesting as a less restrictive, alternative that the government pay directly for contraception; however, the Supreme Court did not hold that such a program was a less restrictive alternative. 134 S.Ct. at 2781-82 (\"[W]e need not rely on the option of a new, government-funded program in order to conclude that the HHS regulations fail the least-restrictive-means test.\u201d).\n\n\n. The tax-credit proposal is particularly problematic because it forces women to pay up front for contraceptives in exchange for tax credits later. But many women simply would not be able to afford to wait a year for a refund from the government in the form of a tax credit and, as the government\u2019s evidence shows, would instead have to forgo using contraceptives. See IOM Report at 109 (recognizing that \u201ccost-sharing requirements, such as deductibles and copayments, can pose barriers to care and result in reduced use of preventive ... services\u201d); see also supra note 38. In contrast, the mandate and accommodation require women to pay nothing upfront for contraceptives. Accordingly, contraceptives are significantly more available to women under the mandate and accommodation than they would be under the tax-credit proposal. ,\n\n\n. The two other circuit courts to address this issue have rejected similar alternatives for the same reason. See Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 616-17 (rejecting similar proposed alternatives because they \u201cwould impede the receipt of [contraceptive] benefits\"); Priests for Life I, 772 F.3d at 265 (holding that proposed alternatives \u201cwould not serve the government\u2019s compelling interest with anywhere near the efficacy of the challenged 1 accommodation and would instead deter women from accessing contraception\u201d).\u2019\n\n\n. It is unclear whether our dissenting colleague \u00e1dvocates as a less restrictive alternative replacing .our insurance-based system with a single-payer system for contraceptive coverage. On the one hand, the dissent never states that a single-payer system would be a less restrictive alternative, instead proposing that the ACA and ERISA need only a \u201cslight[ ] tweak,\u201d not the jettisoning of our insurance-based system for contraceptives that a single-payer system would entail. Dissent at 1189. On the one other hand, the dissent argues that the government should \u201cprovid[e] for contraceptive coverage directly without the accommodation\u2019s administrative rigmarole\u201d so that the government could \"offer cost-free access to each and every woman in the United States.\u201d Id. at 1191. This sounds to us like a single-payer system, -\nIndeed, the dissent suggests that a- single-payer system would be as effective or more effective than the mandate and accommodation at making contraceptives accessible to women. Because under either system-women pay nothing for contraceptives, to compare women\u2019s access to contraceptives under the two systems, we must focus on the administrative burdens that women face under either system.\nWe conclude that, on the whole, women Tace fewer barriers to obtaining contraceptives under the mandate and accommodation than they would under a single-payer system. Most significantly, most women covered by group health insurance plans and all who purchase insurance on the exchanges seamlessly 'receive coverage under the mandate and accommodation, Nonetheless, the dissent asserts that a single-payer system is a more effective-way to improve access to contraceptives because three-categories of women whose employers are exempt from the contraceptive mandate \u2014 (1) women employed by small businesses, (2) women covered by grandfathered plans, and (3) women employed by churches or church-affiliated organizations \u2014 would have greater access to contraceptives under such a system. See id. at 1192, After considering these three categories, we remain convinced that, a single-payer system would be less effective than the mandate and accommodation.\nFirst, the dissent suggests that, women whose employers have 50 or fewer full-time employees would receive better access to contraceptives under a single-payer system. But, as we explained above, these women receive contraceptive' coverage under the mandate and accommodation regardless of whether their employers elect to provide health insurance coverage or they purchase a plan on the exchanges. See supra Part III.A.2.c.(i).(c). Given that these women currently have seamless access to contraceptives, we fail to see how this group supports the dissent\u2019s argument.\nSecond, the dissent\u2019 asserts that women whose health plans have a grandfathered exemption would have better access to contraceptives under a single-payer system. But the dissent overlooks that the grandfathered exemption is a temporary measure, meaning the number of women covered by plans subject to the exemption has rapidly declined and should continue to decline over time because it becomes more expensive for plans to maintain their grandfathered status. See 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.140(g)(1) . (requiring grandfathered plans to .provide virtually the same benefits for the same percentage cost sharing that the plan-had in effect on March 2010). We cannot say that -a single-payer system serves .the government's interest as effectively or more effectively simply because in the short term a subset of women may have easier access to contraceptives under a single-payer system.\n. Third, the dissent argues that women-employed by churches and church-affiliated or*1162ganizations would have easier access to contraceptives under a single-payer system, Even if that is true for this relatively small group of women, the Departments have, explained that these employees are likely to share their employer\u2019s religious objection to contraception, meaning they are \"less likely than other people to use contraceptive services even if such services were covered under the plan.\u201d 78 Fed.Reg. at 39874. All together, we cannot say that' a single-payer system serves the government\u2019s interest as effectively as the mandate and accommodation when we consider that a single-payer system would impose greater barriers to accessing contraceptives for most women who purchase health insurance from an employer and all women who purchase plans on the exchanges. What\u2019s more, the balance tips even further in favor of the mandate and accommodation when we consider the impact of imposing on non-beneficiaries a single-payer system for an entire segment of preventative care. See Cutter, 544 U.S. at 720, 125 S.Ct. 2113.\n\n\n. The Eighth Circuit\u2019s proposal that \"the government could pay for the distribution of contraceptives at community health centers, public clinics,, and hospitals with income-based support\u201d likewise would impose additional administrative burdens on women and thus in a- similar way fails to satisfy the government\u2019s interests. Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 945.\n\n\n. The Eighth Circuit suggested as a less restrictive alternative that the Departments revise the regulations governing the accommodation to remove the requirement that when notifying HHS of its religious objection, an eligible organization must identify its TPA and provide the TPA\u2019s contact information. Sharpe Holdings, 801 F.3d at 944, The Eighth Circuit concluded that this alternative would be \"less onerous\u201d than the current regulations yet permit[] the government to further its interests.\u201d Id. The Eighth Circuit relied on the fact that when the Supreme Court in Wheaton College created an accommodation, the Court required the college only to notify HHS that' it had an objection to providing coverage 'for contraceptive services, and not to identify its TPA. Id.\nWe disagree with the Eighth Circuit that this alternative would serve HHS's interests equally well. As the Departments explained, the information required .under the regulations is \"necessary for the Departments to determine which entities are covered by the accommodation, to administer the accommodation, and to implement the policies in the ... final regulations.\u201d 79 Fed.Reg. at 51095. The Eighth Circuit has not explained why this ' is not so, \u2019 Although the Supreme Court in Wheaton College did not require the college to identify its TPA to HHS to receive an accommodation, the information was unnecessary because HHS already knew the identity of the college\u2019s TPA. See Wheaton College, 134 S.Ct. at 2815 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (\u201cHHS is aware of Wheaton\u2019s third-party administrator in.this case.\u201d). Thus, Wheaton College does not suggest that HHS could administer the mandate and accommodation in other cases without requiring an eligible organization to identify its TPA.\n\n\n. We pause to note that if we assume that the dissent\u2019s substantial burden analysis is correct \u2014 meaning the only objective inquiry for determining whether there is a substantial burden is the magnitude of the penalty, see Dissent at 1180 \u2014 then the dissent\u2019s pro- \u25a0 posal would substantially burden the plain- . tiffs\u2019 religious exercise. Presumably the dissent's position is that the proposal presents a satisfactory alternative because it requires no \"affirmative participation\u201d by the objecting organization. Id. at 1190. In fact, though, a *1164TPA's obligation to provide contraceptive coverage. to a specific plan participant or beneficiary would remain tied to .and \u2014 in some limited way \u2014 \"triggered\u201d by actions taken by the organization. An eligible -organization is required to take two actions before its TPA becomes obligated to provide contraceptive coverage to a specific plan participant or beneficiary: the eligible organization must (1) contract with a specific TPA-to provide administrative services for its plan and (2) notify the TPA of the individuals covered by its plan. Unless an eligible organization hired a specific TPA and provided a. list of its insureds, those insureds would never receive contraceptive coverage from the TPA, even under the dissent\u2019s proposal. See Notre Dame II, 786 F.3d at 617 (explaining that under a similar proposal when a university hired an unemployed person who \"by virtue of becoming employed by [the organization], obtained contraception coverage for the first time,\u201d-the university's acts would \" \u2018trigger!]\u2019 the new employee\u2019s access to contraception\u201d).\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 religious objections to taking acts that \"trigger!]\u201d contraceptive coverage, . .\u201cfacilitat[e]\u201d access .to contraceptives, or render them \u2022 \u201ccqmplicit\u201d in a scheme that provides . access to contraceptives apply with equal, force to the dissent\u2019s proposal. See EWTN-Reply Br. at 5, 10-11; Catholic Charities and CENGI Appellee. Br. at 10, 13, 20. Indeed, Catholic Charities and CENGI alleged . in their complaint that , their \"religious beliefs \u2022 prohibit them from contracting with fy] ... third-party administrator that will, as a direct result, procure or provide the objectionable coverage to [their] employees.\u201d Second Am. Compl. at 49, No. 1:12-cv-03489-WSD, Doc. 56. We acknowledge that the dissent\u2019s proposal does not require an eligible organization to tell HHS or its TPA that it has a religious objection to providing, contraceptive coverage. But the plaintiffs do not claim that .the government imposes a substantial burden by forcing them to state that they have a .religious objection. Rather, they claim a substantial burden because, they assert, their objection would cause their TP As to provide - contraceptive coverage.\n\n\n. EWTN\u2019s Free Speech claim that the regulations compel silence is moot because the Department removed the non-interference provisions from the regulations in 2014. 79 Fed.Reg. at 51095.\n\n\n.

            "opinion_text": "\nANDERSON, Circuit Judge,\nconcurring:\nI join Judge Jill Pryor\u2019s opinion for the court in its entirety. I write' separately only to emphasize one point already made in the opini\u00f3n.' Plaintiffs seem' to suggest, as a less restrictive means, that a religious employer be allowed to opt out without notifying anyone \u2014 without requiring even the de minimis notice to Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) pursuant to the most recent alternative notice provided for in the Regulations. However, the necessary consequence of such an automatic *1169opt-out would be the imposition of plaintiffs\u2019 religious beliefs on- their female employees. In other words, if HHS were not able to identify which employers have opted out, the employees of such\" employers would not receive contraceptive coverage, at least until they happened to sua spont'e discover that their employer had opted out, and until such employees happened to sua sponte discover their statutory entitlement. Only then would such employees be in position to notify HHS, and begin their coverage. Such an automatically exempted employer \u2014 notifying no one of its decision to opt out \u2014 would at least temporarily impose its own religious beliefs on its employees and deprive them of the coverage to which they are entitled under the- statute and regulations'. RFRA does not require that construction of the law. Rather, the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby recognized that \u201cRFRA took the position that \u2018the compelling interest test as set forth in prior Federal rulings is a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests .\u2019\u2019 Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 537 U.S. -, -, 134 S.Ct. 2751, 2785, 189 L.Ed.2d 675 (2014)(quoting from the express RFRA provision cited and quoted below). See also Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 7020, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 2121, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005)(\u201cProperly applying RLUIPA, courts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested accommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries\u201d); id. at 722, 125 S.Ct. at 2122-23 (\u201cOur decisions indicate that an accommodation must be measured so that it does not override other significant interests .... We have no cause to believe that RLUIPA would not be applied in an appropriately balanced way.\u201d). Indeed, RFRA contains an express provision which incorporates the prior Federal case law contemplating a \u201csensible balance\u201d between religious liberty and competing governmental interests. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb(a)(5) (\u201cthe compelling interest test as set forth in prior Federal court rulings is a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental .interests.\u201d) Plaintiffs\u2019 position \u2014 and its necessary consequence of the imposition of plaintiffs\u2019 religious views on others \u2014 clearly does mot strike a \u201csensible balance\u201d between religious liberty and the government\u2019s compelling interests in this case. See Hobby Lobby, 537 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2786-87 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\u201c[N]o person may be restricted or demeaned by government in exercising his or her religion. Yet neither may that same exercise unduly restrict other persons, such as employees, in protecting their own interests, interests the law deems compelling.\u201d).\n",

            "opinion_text": "\nTJOFLAT, Circuit Judge,\ndissenting:\nI diverge from the majority on the question of whether the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\u201cRFRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb et seq., shields Eternal Word Television Network and the Archdiocese of Atlanta, the Diocese of Savannah, and their related schools and charities (the \u201cDioceses\u201d) from the Government\u2019s efforts to force them to participate in a complicated regulatory scheme. Doing so, these parties sincerely believe, would make them complicit in violating the sanctity of human life. \u2019 As I understand RFRA\u2019s plain meaning and the controlling precedent, on full display in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2751, 189 L.Ed.2d 675 (2014), the answer should be straightforward. Under RFRA\u2019s demanding scrutiny, the Government cannot put religious believers to the choice of abandoning the commands of their faith or paying massive penalties unless it can show that it has no other way of achieving a compelling interest. Just as in Hobby Lobby, the Govern*1170ment has failed to make this showing, -We are therefore bound. to grant Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses the relief they seek.\n\u201cGreat cases, like hard cases, make bad law.\u201d N. Sec. Co. v. United States, 193 U.S. 197, 364, 24 S.Ct. 436, 468, 48 L.Ed. 679 (1904) (Holmes, J., dissenting). In such circumstances, practical concerns \u201cexercise a kind of hydraulic pressure\u201d under which \u201ceven well settled principles of law will bend\u201d as a result of \u201csome accident of immediate overwhelming interest.\u201d Id. at 364, 401, 24 S.Ct. at 468. In the background of. this litigation rage many competing interests: What sort of legal regime would best preserve the American ideal of religious liberty? How can we most effectively . expand healthcare access? When and where should the interests of society trump those of the individual? Who will be left holding the check for any newly minted social-welfare programs?\nIt is Congress\u2019s responsibility \u2014 not the prerogative of courts \u2014 to balance these interests. And Congress made clear in RFRA how that balance is to be struck: the freedom of religious exercise is to be jealously guarded by subjecting, across the board, Congress\u2019s own actions to the most rigorous scrutiny. Under that scrutiny, the Government\u2019s attempt here to burden Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses\u2019 religious exercise must give way. Concluding otherwise, the majority makes bad law. For that reason, I dissent.\nI.\nThe devil, as they say, is in the details. Nowhere does this adage ring truer than in the administrative morass of the \u25a0 so-called \u201caccommodation,\u201d the regulatory mechanism by which religiously objecting employers can affirmatively opt out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s so-called \u201ccontraceptive mandate.\u201d The resolution of this case turns on the exact functioning of an evolving set of overlapping and intricate regulations promulgated by three Executive-branch agencies. These regulations overlay a particularly unsettled and murky region of the generally unsettled and murky \u25a0landscape of federal healthcare regulation. Therefore, it is critical to get the details right. And they are devilish indeed.\nA.\nUnder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (\u201cthe ACA\u201d), covered employers, as part of their \u201c[sjhared responsibility\u201d for their employees\u2019 healthcare needs, are required to provide qualifying employees with health plans that meet certain standards of \u201cminimum essential coverage.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4980H(a), 5000A(f)(2). Covered employers who fail to do so have to pay a \u201ctax\u201d1 of $100 per day for each affected employee. Id. \u00a7 4980D(a)-(b). For continued \u201cnoncompliance\u201d after receiving a \u201cnotice of examination,\u201d employers are subject to a minimum penalty in the amount of $2,500 or $15,000 per affected employee, depending on whether the violations \u201care more than de minimis.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4980D(b)(3).\nIncluded in the ACA\u2019s definition of \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d are a number of preventive healthcare services. Relevant here is the requirement to provide \u201cwith respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings ... as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration.\u201d 42\u2019 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(4). To develop these guidelines, the Health Resources and Services Administration, a subpart *1171of the Department, of Health and Human Services, sought recommendations from the Institute of Medicine, a division of the National Academies of Sciences. The Institute of Medicine\u2019s .recommendations2 were \u00a1ultimately adopted in identical regulations promulgated by the Department of Treasury, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Health and Human Services. See 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2590.715 \u2014 2713(a)(1)(iv); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.130(a)(l)(iv).3 As a result, nonexempt employers are responsible for providing their plan beneficiaries with coverage for \u201c[a]ll Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.\u201d Women\u2019s Preventive Services Guidelines, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., Health Res. and S\u00e9rvs. Admin., http:// hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/ (last visited Feb. 10, 2016).\nThese regulations, collectively known as the \u201ccontraceptive mandate,\u201d did not apply as enacted to several categories of employers. As is true generally of the ACA the contraceptive mandate does not cover employers with less than fifty full-time employees.. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H(a), (e)(2). These employers are thus under no obligation to provide any health plan at all. Similarly, employers who maintain \u201cgrandfathered health plans\u201d \u2014 health plans that have not undergone specified changes in the way they operated before March 23, 2010, see 75 ,Fed.Reg. 34538, 34540-41\u2014 are specifically exempted from the contraceptive mandate. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18011(a), (e). Other changes instituted by the ACA do apply to grandfathered health plans, including extensions of dependent coverage for adult children under the age of twenty-six and prohibitions on excessive waiting periods/ lifetime benefits limits, and rescissions of coverage. Id. \u00a7 18011(a)(4)(A)(i)-(iv). The ACA does-not include a sunset provision for grandfathered \u2022 health plans, which can continue their exempt status indefinitely.4\nConscious of the bind in which the contraceptive mandate would place certain employers with religious objections, the Departments promulgated a series of further regulations to exempt these employers as well.5 What emerged from several *1172years' of rulemaking were two distinct regimes for employers with religious objections: one for \u201creligious employers\u201d and another for \u201celigible organizations.\u201d \u201d45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(a), (b). \u201cReligious employers\u201d are defined, by reference to the Internal Revenue Code, as \u201cchurches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of'.churches\u201d and' any \u201cnonprofit entities]\u201d engaged in \u201cthe exclusively religious activities of any religious order.\u201d Id. \u00a7 147.131(a); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii).6 Employers who object to the contraceptive mandate but are not considered \u201creligious employers\u201d can still qualify as \u201celigible organizations\u201d if they meet the following requirements:\n(1)The organization opposes providing coverage for some or all of any contra-\nceptive items or services required to be covered under \u00a7 147.130(a)(l)(iv) on account of religious objections.\n(2) (i) The organization is organized and ' operates as a nonprofit entity and holds itself out as a religious organization; or\n( (ii) The organization is organized and operates as a closely held for-profit entity ... that ... objects to covering some or all of the contraceptive services on account of the owners\u2019 sincerely held religious beliefs.\n(3) The organization must self-certify in the form and manner specified by the , Secretary of Labor or provide notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services as described [elsewhere in the regulations] ...\n45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131.7\n*1173Religious employers\u2019 and eligible organizations\u2019 bids to remove themselves from the contraceptive mandate fare differently. Religious employers .are simply exempt; they are not required to participate, directly or indirectly, in providing access to contraceptive coverage to their female employees and beneficiaries, whether or not these women share their employers\u2019 beliefs. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(a). Eligible organizations, in contrast, are required to affirmatively opt out of providing contraceptive coverage, if they wish to do so, by complying with a further series of regulations known as \u201cthe accommodation.\u201d Id. \u00a7 147.131(c).\nHow the accommodation functions turps on the eligible organization\u2019s type of health plan. Broadly speaking, employer-sponsored health plans come in two types: insured plans and self-insured plans. Under an insured plan, the employer enters into a contract with an insurer. The insurer, in exchange for up-front premiums, becomes responsible for administering the plan and paying out claims., Under a self-insured plan, the employer remains responsible for paying its employees\u2019 claims itself; in essence, the employer serves as its own insurer. For employers with self-insured plans, it is a common practice to contract with a third-party administrator \u2014 -which may also be in the business of providing insured, plans \u2014 to administer the self-insured plany though the employer continues to bear the cost of paying claims.8 Eligible organizations that maintain their own self-insured plans without a third-party administrator are, like religious employers, exempt from the contraceptive mandate altogether. ,\n\" Eligible organizations may, in line with the -regulations currently in force, avail themselves of the accommodation in one of two ways.9 The first option -is to send a \u201cself-certification\u201d form, Employee Benefits Security Administration Form 700 (\u201cForm 700\u201d), to the eligible organization\u2019s insurer, if the organization has- an insured plan, or to the organization\u2019s third-party administrator, if the. organization has a self-insured ' plan. 45 C.F.R, \u00a7 147.131(b)(3), (c)(1), Form 700 requires eligible organizations to identify themselves as qualifying for the accommodation; -list the name, title, and contact information of the p\u00e9rson authorized to make that certification;, and sign and date the form.10 The second option is to send to the Secretary- of Health and Human Services less-formal notice of the eligible organization\u2019s intent &gt;to opt out. That notice must include \u201cthe- name of the eligible organization and -the basis on which it qualifies for an accommodation,\u201d notice of its objection- to the contraceptive mandate *1174\u201cbased on [the eligible organization\u2019s] sincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d the name and type of the eligible organization\u2019s health plan, and the identity and contact information of the eligible organization\u2019s ins\u00farer or third-party administrator. \u25a0 \u25a0 Id. \u00a7 147.131(c)(l)(ii).\nUnder the first option provided for in the accommodation, whereby Form 700 is sent directly to an eligible organization\u2019s insurer or third-party administrator, the recipient insurer or third-party administrator becomes responsible for establishing separate contraceptive coverage for the eligible organization\u2019s female employees and plan beneficiaries. The insurer or third-party administrator must, upon receipt of the eligible organization\u2019s Form 700, \u201c[e]x-pressly exclude contraceptive coverage\u201d from the eligible organization\u2019s plan and \u201c[p]rovide separate payments for any contraceptive services required to be covered\u201d pursuant to the contraceptive mandate. Id. \u00a7 147.131(c)(2)(i)(A)-(B). Among other requirements, the insurer or third-party administrator must also \u201csegregate premium revenue ... from the monies used to provide payments for contraceptive services\u201d and is forbidden from \u201cimposing] any cost-sharing requirements (such as a copayment, coinsurance, or a deductible), or imposing] any .premium, fee, or other charge, or any portion thereof, directly or indirectly, on the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.\u201d Id. \u00a7 147.131(c)(2)(ii). And the insurer or third-party administrator must provide to plan members and beneficiaries written notice outlining how the accommodation works and \u201cspecifying] that the eligible organization does not administer or fund contraceptive benefits.\u201d See id. \u00a7 147.131(d) (proposing suggested language for this notice).\nUnder the second option provided for in the accommodation, whereby less-formal notice is sent instead to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary is then tasked with alerting the eligible organization\u2019s insurer or third-party administrator. The Department of Health and Human Services will \u201csend a separate notification\u201d to the insurer relaying that the eligible organization\u2019s notice was received and \u201cdescribing the [insurer\u2019s or third-party administrator\u2019s] obligations.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(c)(1)(h). The insurer\u2019s or third-party administrator\u2019s obligations to provide separate coverage pursuant to the contraceptive mandate are identical whether it is alerted to the eligible organization\u2019s objections directly by Form 700 or indirectly by the Government.11\nThe regulations require eligible organizations to affirmatively opt out of the contraceptive mandate because .doing so enables the Government to require the eligible organizations\u2019 insurers and third-party administrators to provide contraceptive coverage. For eligible organizations with insured plans,12- opting out under the accommodation notifies the in*1175surers of their obligations to provide contraceptive coverage. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(c)(2)(i). For eligible organizations with self-insured plans that contract with a third-party administrator,13 opting out of the contraceptive mandate under the accommodation makes the third-party administrator \u201cthe plan administrator\u201d ' for purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq., under regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-16(b). If the eligible organization submits Form 700, that submission \u201cshall be treated as a designation' of the third party administrator as the' plan administrator.\u201d Id. If the eligible organization instead provides less-formal notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \u201cthe Department of Labor, working with the Department of Health and Human Services, shall ... provide notification ... that such third party administrator shall be the plan administrator\u201d under ERISA. Id. Once a third-party administrator becomes a \u201cplan administrator\u201d under ERISA, the relevant administrative agencies gain the regulatory authority \u25a0 to . require the third-party administrator to provide contraceptive coverage.14 Id. \u00a7 2510.3-16(c).\nThe Government\u2019s regulatory authority to require \u25a0 third-party administrators of self-insured plans to provide contraceptive coverage is limited. A third-party administrator may always decline to \u201cagree[ ] to enter into or remain in a contractual relationship with the eligible organization.\u201d15 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.9815-2713A(b)(2). Only if it accepts the terms of the regulations does a third-party administrator incur the obligation \u201cto provide or arrange payments for contraceptive services.\u201d Id. \u00a7 54.9815-2713A(d). .If a third-party administrator agrees to provide the. contraceptive coverage, the costs it incurs to do so will be reimbursed from \u201cFederally-facilitated Exchange\u201d user fees, which are fees imposed on insurers offering health plans on exchanges established by the Government under the ACA.16 See 80 Fed. Reg. at 41328.\n*1176B.\nInextricably intertwined with these evolving regulations is - a series of cases challenging the various iterations of the contraceptive mandate under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\u201cRFRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb et seq. RFRA provides that the federal government17 \u201cmay substantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion\u201d only if it does so \u201cin furtherance of a compelling governmental interest\u201d and the burden it imposes is \u201cthe least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2000bb-1(b).\nIn 1993, Congress enacted RFRA in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s path-breaking approach to the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause taken in Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990) (holding that neutral laws of general applicability do not burden free exercise whether or not they are supported by a compelling interest). Congress declared that the standard of strict scrutiny RFRA imposes creates \u201ca workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb(a)(5). RFRA\u2019s stated purposes included \u201crestoring] the compelling interest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, 374. U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972)\u201d and \u201cprovidpng]. a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by government.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2000bb(b)(1), (2). To the extent that it imposes a least-restrictive-means requirement not present in Sherbert or Yoder, however, RFRA \u201cprovide^] even broader protection for religious liberty than was available under those decisions.\u201d Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. -, - n. 3, 134 S.Ct. 2751, 2761 n. 3, 189 L.Ed.2d 675 (2014).\nFollowing the enactment of the ACA and the promulgation .of the contraceptive mandate, a diverse set of employers brought suit to avoid providing what they viewed as objectionable contraceptive coverage.18 The Supreme Court first encountered the contraceptive mandate in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2751, 189 L.Ed.2d 675 (2014).19 The Court held in Hobby Lobby that enforcing the contraceptive mandate *1177against a closely held for-profit company that had religious objections to providing contraceptive 'coverage would violate RFRA. Id. at-, 134 S.Ct. at 2785. The Court began by determining- that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, RFRA covers certain for-profit companies because the term \u201cperson\u201d was not limited only to natural persons. Id. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2767-75. Moving to \u25a0 RFRA\u2019s threshold inquiry, the Court \u201cha[d] little trouble concluding\u201d that the contraceptive mandate imposes a substantial burden on religious exercise. Id. at \u2014, 134 S.Ct. at 2775. The Hobby Lobby plaintiffs had an uncontested \u201csincere religious belief that life begins at conception\u201d and understood that their belief would be violated if they were required to \u201cprovid[e] health insurance that .covers methods of birth control\u201d that \u201cmay result in the destruction of an embryo.\u201d. Id. By forcing them to choose between violating-their deeply held convictions and \u201cpay[ing] an enormous sum of money,\u201d the contraceptive mandate \u201cclearly imposes a substantial burden on those beliefs.\u201d Id. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2779.\nThe Court specifically and emphatically rejected any argument that the participation of religious objectors, by paying for contraceptive coverage, is \u201csimply too attenuated\u201d from the objectionable outcome, the destruction of embryos, to constitute a burden on religious exercise. Id. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2777. Such an \u2018 argument, which \u201cimplicates a difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy,\u201d would \u201cin effect tell the plaintiffs that their beliefs are flawed\u201d \u2014 and defining the scope of religious belief is a dangerous line-drawing inquiry \u201cfederal courts have-no business . addressing.\u201d See id. at \u2014, 134 S.Ct. at 2778 (\u201cInstead, our \u2018narrow function ... in this context is to determine\u2019 whether the line drawn reflects \u2018an honest conviction\u2019\u201d (quoting Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp\u2019t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 716, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 1431, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981))). Moreover, the Court noted, if the contraceptive mandate\u2019s burden were not substantial, it would \u201cbe hard to understand\u201d and \u201cnot easy to square\u201d with the exemptions carved out for qualifying \u201creligious employers\u201d facing \u201cexactly the same\u201d burden. Id. at \u2014\u2014 n. 33, 134 S.Ct. at 2777 n. 33.\nThe Court next declined to address whether the' contraceptive mandate furthered a compelling interest because, even if it did, the contraceptive mandate was not the least restrictive means of doing so. Id. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2779-80. The Court identified several less-restrictive alternatives that the Government could have used to achieve the assumed compelling interest, holding that the contraceptive mandate foundered under RFRA\u2019s \u201cexceptionally demanding\u201d standard. Id. at-, 134. S.Ct. at 2780. The \u201cmost straightforward\u201d alternative \u201cwould be for the Government to assume the cost\u201d of contraceptive coverage. Id. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2780. In response to the Government\u2019s contrary position, the Court observed that \u201cit is hard to understand [the] argument that [the Government] cannot be required under RFRA to pay anything\u201d for \u201ca Government interest of the highest order.\u201d Id. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2781.20 The Court *1178also strongly, suggested that the Government\u2019s direct provision of contraceptive coverage would still be a less-restrictive alternative if the Government were required to create \u201can entirely new program\u201d rather than \u201cmodif[y] an existing program (which RFRA surely allows).\u201d Id.\nIn its analysis the Court decided it \u201cneed not rely on the option of a new, government-funded program\u201d to identify a less-restrictive alternative because the regulations already provided one: the then-existing version of the accommodation for employers with religious objections. Id. at \u2014, 134 S.Ct. at 2781-82. The for-profit Hobby Lobby plaintiffs did not object to the accommodation itself, so granting them the option for a third party to provide their female employees\u2019 contraceptive coverage \u201cserves [the Government\u2019s] stated interests equally well.\u201d Id. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2781-82. Though derided as \u201c \u2018noncommittal\u2019 \u201d by the dissent for doing so, the Court expressly declined to rule on \u201cwhether an approach of this type complies with RFRA for purposes of all religious claims.\u201d Id. at &amp; n. 40, 134 S.Ct. at 2782 &amp; n. 40.\nThree days after it decided Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court again ruled on the contraceptive mandate in Wheaton College v. Burwell, 573 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2806, 189 L.Ed.2d 856 (2014).21 In Wheaton College, the Court issued an order enjoining the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \u201cpending final disposition of appellate review,\u201d from enforcing the contraceptive mandate against an employer that submits \u201cin writing- that it is a non-profit organization that holds itself out as religious and has religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services.\u201d Id. at-, 134 S.Ct. at 2807. The parties disputed whether the obligation to provide contraceptive coverage was \u201cdependent\u201d on submitting Form 700 to an insurer or third-party administrator. Id. The Court concluded in its two-page order that, because notice had already been given to the Government, the Government \u201crelying on this notice\u201d could \u201cfacilitate the provision of full contraceptive coverage under the [ACA].\u201d Id. The Court ended its order by noting that it \u201cshould not be construed as an expression of the Court\u2019s views on the merits.\u201d Id.\nAfter Hobby Lobby and Wheaton College, the federal courts were inundated with cases posing the question presented here: whether RFRA provides relief to employers with religious objections -to the accommodation - itself. Our sister circuits are deeply divided. Like the majority, most circuits have concluded that, though RFRA requires deference to adherents\u2019 sincerely held religious beliefs, \u201can objective inquiry\u201d to determine whether a law presents' a substantial burden reveals that the accommodation does not impose a substantial burden on religious exercise.22 Ante at 1142-46; see also Catholic Health Care Sys. v.

The agencies ultimately determined that the Government had a compelling interest in providing women with cost-free access to a wide range of contraceptive services. In accordance with that determination, the agencies, through threat of large monetary penalties, mandated that certain employers must provide contraceptive coverage to their female employees. Though Congress had already exempted some types of employers \u2014 those with fewer than fifty employees and those with grandfathered health plans \u2014 the agencies decided that another group of employers should be exempt too: churches and church-affiliated organizations, as defined by already-existing definitions in the Internal Revenue Code.\nThe agencies exempted churches and church-affiliated organizations from the contraceptive mandate because the agencies understood that the contraceptive mandate would, impose a substantial burden on many of these organizations\u2019 religious exercise. As a result, churches and church-affiliated organizations may choose *1180what contraceptive coverage, if any, will be available in their female employees\u2019 health plans. No such exemption, however, was thought necessary for other organizations with similar religious objections, whether for-profit or nonprofit. After much public outcry and litigation, the agencies changed course. At first, the agencies, began offering an exemption-like option to certain nonprofits with religious objections. In response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hobby Lobby, the agencies extended the same to for-profit religious objectors as well.\nBut the exemption-like option \u2014 the accommodation \u2014 did not truly exempt qualifying employers. Rather, it required qualifying employers to affirmatively opt out of providing contraceptive coverage, shifting the obligation to provide the required contraceptive coverage to the employers\u2019 insurer or third-party administrator. Originally, qualifying employers had to opt out by sending Form 700 to the insurer or third-party administrator responsible for the employers\u2019 health plans, alerting the insurer or third-party administrator to its new obligations. After the Supreme Court\u2019s order in Wheaton College, the agencies also made available an option of providing less-formal notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Under this option, the notice is rerouted to-the insurer or third-party administrator, in' lieu of the employer submitting Form 700 directly.\nFor employers that run self-insured health plans in conjunction with a third-party administrator and are eligible for the accommodation, opting out of the contraceptive mandate has the effect of designating the employers\u2019 third-party administrators as \u201cplan administrators\u201d under ERISA. Once so designated, the agencies can require a third-party administrator to provide contraceptive- coverage. Absent any affirmative action from the employer, third-party administrators remain outside of ERISA\u2019s reach. Likewise outside of ERISA\u2019s reach, -and thus effectively exempt from the contraceptive mandate, are employers that run self-insured health plans without a third-party administrator.\n\u00c1s a result, there are four discrete options facing employers like Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses, which operate self-insured plans and do not meet the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s definition for churches or church-affiliated organizations but nonetheless have religious objections to providing contraceptive coverage. First, these employers can provide the objectionable coverage in violation of their beliefs. Second, these employers can comply with the accommodation -and affirmatively opt out of the contraceptive mandate, shifting the obligation to provide the required coverage to their insurer or third-party administrator, also in violation of their beliefs. Third, these employers can drop their third-party administrators and assume the costs and responsibilities of running their own health plans. Fourth, these employers can do nothing and thereby become liable for annual fines of thousands of dollars per employee.\nThis case requires two determinations. First, does the regulatory scheme discussed above impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise, of. Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses, which believe that opting out under the accommodation would violate the sanctity of human life? If so, does the regulatory scheme nonetheless survive RFRA\u2019s demanding standard of strict scrutiny? Because I conclude that the answers to these questions are yes and no, while the majority says no and yes, I dissent.\nH.\nThe threshold inquiry under RFRA requires a showing that the Government has *1181\u201csubstantially burden[ed]\u201d the plaintiffs \u201cexercise of religion.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-l; First, a RFRA plaintiff must identify religious exercise that the Government is, burdening. The allegedly burdened exercise \u201cmust be sincerely based on a religious belief and not some other motivation.\u201d Holt v. Hobbs, 574 U.S. -, -, 135 S.Ct. 853, 862, 190 L.Ed.2d 747 (2015).23 When determining the content of a religious belief, including how and to what extent its attendant exercise may be burdened, we defer to the plaintiffs understanding of what his faith requires of him because \u201c[c]ourts are not arbiters of scriptural interpretation.\u201d Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Emp\u2019t Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 716, 101 S.Ct. 1425, 1431, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981). So long as a religious adherent has drawn a line based on \u201can honest conviction,\u201d \u201cit is not for us to say that the line he drew was an unreasonable one.\u201d Id. at 715-16, 101 S.Ct. at 1430-31.\nNext, we must determine whether, as an objective matter, the identified burden on religious exercise is substantial. The existence of a substantial burden, which \u201ccan result from pressure that tends to force adherents to forego religious precepts or from pressure that mandates religious conduct,\u201d turns on whether the Government\u2019s actions coerce a religious adherent to affirmatively violate his beliefs. Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town, of Surfside, 366 F.3d 1214, 1227 (11th Cir.2004). To be substantial, a burden must be \u201cakin to significant pressure which directly coerces the religious adherent to conform his or her behavior accordingly\u201d and must be more than \u201can inconvenience on religious exercise.\u201d Id. For example, a zoning ordinance that forces members of an Orthodox Jewish congregation to \u201cwalk[] a few , extra blocks\u201d to attend services on the Sabbath is not a substantial burden when there is no \u201creligious significance\u201d as to a particular synagogue site, though \u201cwalking may be burdensome.\u201d Id. at 1221, 1227-28. In contrast, if the Government puts a religious adherent to,the \u201cchoice\u201d of incurring a \u201cserious\u201d penalty or \u201c \u2018engaging] in conduct-that seriously violates [his] religious beliefs,\u2019\u201d then the Government \u201csubstantially burdens his religious exercise.\u201d. See Hobbs, 574 U.S. at. -, 135 S.Ct. at 862 (quoting Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. \u2014, -, 134 S.Ct. 2751, 2775, 189 L.Ed.2d 675 (2014) (second alteration in the original)). And a burden is no less substantial if the burdened party \u201cis able to engage in other forms of religious exercise\u2019,\u201d if the exercise ift .question is not \u201ccompelled\u201d by the burdened party\u2019s religion, or if the'burdened party\u2019s belief is \u201cidiosyncratic.\u201d Id. at -, 185 S.Ct. at 862.\nHere, it is overwhelmingly clear that the contraceptive mandate imposes on Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses a burden that the accommodation does not alleviate. Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses assert a religious belief \u2014 which the Government does not contest is sincerely held \u2014 that both complying with the contraceptive mandate and opting out under the accommodation, which requires the third-party administrators of their health plans to provide contraceptive coverage, would make them complicit in violating the sanctity of human life. The Government burdens that belief by requiring Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses to affirmatively participate in its regulatory scheme.\nAnd it is equally clear that the burden imposed is substantial. The Government puts Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses to the \u201cchoice\u201d of either *1182(1) complying with the contraceptive mandate, to which they object on religious grounds; (2) opting out under the accommodation, to which they also object on religious grounds; (3) dropping the third-party administrators of their health plans and becoming de facto insurance companies, -incurring substantial costs and diverting the focus of their religiously motivated operations; or (4) incurring millions of dollars in penalties annually.24 Besides providing yet another way for the eligible organizations to violate their religious beliefs, the accommodation does nothing to change the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Hobby Lobby that the contraceptive mandate \u201cclearly imposes a substantial burden on those beliefs.\u201d 573 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2779. Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses must either violate their beliefs or incur massive monetary costs. On its face, such a \u201cchoice\u201d is not a choice at all. Rather, it is a substantial burden on religious exercise.\nAs I understand it, this straightforward application of RFRA\u2019s- substantial-burden test should end the matter. The majority thinks otherwise, reaching the wrong conclusion for two reasons. First, the majority fails to give proper deference to Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses\u2019 sincerely held religious beliefs. Second, the majority mischaracterizes how the contraceptive mandate works by understating the critical role that' the accommodation forces employers to play in providing contraceptive coverage.\nBefore explaining why the majority fails to give RFRA its proper meaning, it is helpful to clarify how our understandings of RFRA\u2019s inquiry differ. Exactly where we differ is highlighted below:\n[[Image here]]\n*1183A.\nFirst, the majority fails to give the proper deference due Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses\u2019 sincerely held belief that it would violate the sanctity of human life to comply with the Government\u2019s regulatory scheme, either directly through the contraceptive mandate or indirectly through the accommodation. Though the majority purports to defer-to these beliefs, its deference is largely illusory. The majority begins by correctly observing that RFRA\u2019s substantial-burden inquiry \u201cinvolves both subjective and objective dimensions.\u201d Ante at 1144. The majority continues on, also correctly, to observe that \u201ccourts must accept a religious adherent\u2019s assertion that his religious beliefs require him to take or abstain from taking a specified action.\u201d Id. The majority falters, however, when it concludes that \u201cit is for the courts to determine objectively ... whether the government has, in fact, put plaintiffs to the choice of violating their religious beliefs ... or incurring a substantial penalty.\u201d Id. at 1145.\nContrary' to the majority\u2019s position, RFRA does require deference to religious adherents\u2019 determinations that their sincerely held beliefs are being burdened. \u201cThe narrow function of a reviewing court in this context\u201d prevents unnecessary and improper judicial intrusion into highly sensitive matters of moral philosophy or theology, Thomas, 450 U.S. at 716, 101 S.Ct. at 1431, and this understanding of the substantial-burden standard is confirmed by the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent religious-accommodation\u2019 decisions. See Hobbs, 574 U.S. at -, 135 S.Ct. at 861-63 (granting an exemption to a prison\u2019s grooming, policy for a Muslim inmate\u2019s proposed \u201c \u2018compromise\u2019 \u201d that he be allowed to grow a half-inch-long beard); Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2775-79 (rejecting the argument that \u201cthe connection between\u201d providing contraceptive coverage and the \u201cdestruction of an embryo[ ] is simply too attenuated\u201d because this \u201cwould in effect tell the plaintiffs their beliefs are flawed.\u201d).\nThe \u201cobjective inquiry\u201d under RFRA focuses only on whether that burden is substantial: For example, courts must defer to a religious adherent\u2019s belief, if it is sincerely held, that dancing is morally wrong.25 And courts must defer to the religious adherent\u2019s understanding that this belief would be burdened if she were required to look upon, even if only for a moment, a single masquerade ball or sock hop. What courts must determine as an objective matter is whether the burden imposed by any pro-dancing Government action is a substantial one. Imposing millions of dollars in fines for failing to perform a Government-mandated jitterbug would, obviously, be a substantial burden on religious exercise. In contrast, there would be no substantial burden if the Government merely financed public dancefl-oors or had a hortatory policy of extolling the virtues of dance.26\nIf the substantial-burden test were as the majority believes it to be, federal judges would have to decide whether the burden itself substantially violated the adherent\u2019s beliefs. That is, the majority would necessarily shift the gaze of its \u201cobjective inquiry\u201d to the merits of religious *1184belief. In this Bizarro World, it would be secular courts making ex cathedra pronouncements on whether Muslims are truly put out by requirements to shave their beards, Hobbs, 574 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 853; Fraternal Order of Police Newark Lodge No. 12 v. City of Newark, 170 F.3d 359 (3d Cir.1999), whether Seventh-day Adventists are sufficiently deterred from accepting employment by requirements to work on Saturdays, Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963), whether Santer\u00eda priests could just make do without ritual sacrifice or Ache-infused beads and shells, Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993); Davila v. Gladden, 777 F.3d 1198 (11th Cir.2015), and whether the sacramental use of peyote is really that big of a deal to members of the Native American Church, Emp\u2019t Div., Dep\u2019t of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990). But, of course, the Constitution does not vest in the judiciary the authority to declare winners and losers in matters of faith. And for good reason.\nAt bottom, the majority\u2019s reasoning takes aim at the heart of RFRA itself. Implicit in the majority\u2019s rationale is the notion that wily plaintiffs could game the system if religious adherents\u2019 beliefs were given the full extent of the deference demanded by RFRA. In tailoring their stated beliefs, these plaintiffs could engage in strategic litigation unhampered, impairing the government\u2019s ability to function efficiently. By expanding the limited scope of the objective portion of the substantial-burden inquiry, the majority expressly seeks to avoid \u201creducing the ... federal courts to \u2018rubber stamps.\u2019 \u201d Ante at 1145. Here, despite conceding as the majority must that \u201cthe act. of- opting out plays [some] causal role in the ultimate provision of contraceptive coverage,\u201d the majority runs roughshod over the sincerely held religious objections of Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses because, in line with the majority\u2019s sense of things, the \u201cde minimis burden that the plaintiffs face\u201d resulting from their role as \u201can incidental cause of contraceptive coverage being provided\u201d does not constitute a substantial burden; Id. at 1147-48, 1148-49. The majority through a nifty bit of legalistic legerdemain manages to transform the subjective content of religious adherents\u2019 sincerely held beliefs into an objective question of federal law, undercutting the very deference to religious exercise it purports to extend.\nThe majority\u2019s not-so-veiled' implication that, if given its full effect, RFRA will be refashioned from a shield protecting the faithful into a sword wielded by cynical opportunists is troubling and at odds with RFRA\u2019s fundamental respect for the deeply held- convictions that guide the daily lives of hundreds of.millions of Americans. As an initial matter, whether or not a belief is sincerely held remains an important part of RFRA\u2019s substantial-burden inquiry. Courts are not, for example, compelled to entertain challenges from such obvious farces as a hypothetical \u201cChurch of Marijuana and Pepperoni Pizza\u201d27 or the satirical \u201cOur Lady of Perpetual Exemption.\u201d28 Separating the faithful sheep from the cynically opportunistic goats is well within our judicial capabilities.\n*1185Moreover, to the extent that granting exemptions for religious adherents would impair the governnient\u2019s ability to run programs and administer law efficiently, this is a feature of RFRA, not a bug. Congress made the clear policy choice that protecting the individual right of free religious exercise outweighed the costs imposed at the expense of administrative efficiency. And this choice \u2014 to preserve individual freedom by fettering the Government\u2019s ability to act as expeditiously as possible \u2014 is at the core of our foundational notion of limited government. Permitting demonstrations in public parks, requiring police officers to secure a warrant before searching homes or seizing persons, and committing the Government to provide just compensation if it wishes to take private property all surely hamper the Government\u2019s ability to pursue count less other important ends. These tradeoffs are the cost of liberty. And how best to balance these enhanced protections against their added cos.ts is exactly the sort of, thorny policy decision best left to democratically responsive legislators, not unelected judges.29\nThe majority is hardly alone in its implicit rejection .of RFRA\u2019s core purpose. Striking the proper balance between the collective needs of society and the individual freedom of religious exercise has been fraught with rancor and sectarian strife since time immemorial. Unsurprisingly then, the oft-embattled RFRA has proven a favorite whipping boy from all sides of the legal academy during its twenty-three-year existence. See, e.g., Douglas Ne-Jaime &amp; Reva B. Siegel, Conscience Wars: Complicity-Based Conscience Claims in Religion and Politics, 124 Yale L.J. 2516 (2015); Mary Anne Case, Why \u201cLive-And-Let-Live\u201d is not a Viable Solution to the: Difficult Problems of Religious Accommodation in the Age of Sexual Civil Rights, 88 S. Cal. L.Rev. 463 (2015); Douglas Laycock, Religious Liberty and the Culture Wars, 2014 U. Ill. L.Rev. 839; William P. Marshall, Bad Statutes Make Bad Law: Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, 2014 Sup.Ct. Rev. 71; Michael Stokes Paulsen, A RFRA Runs Through It: Religious Freedom and the U.S.Code, 56 Mont. L.Rev. 249 (1995).\nJudicial declaration's that the sky will fall if exemptions were granted to religious objectors in a pluralistic society as diverse and vibrant as the United States are old hat as well. Consider the following statement of Chief Justice Morrison' Waite, written almost one hundred and fifty years ago:\nLaws are made for the \u25a0 government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may with practices.... Can a man excuse his practices to the contrary because of his religious belief? To permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief \"superior to the law of the land, and in effect to perrhit every citizen to become a law unto himself. Government could exist only in name under such circumstances.\nReynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 166-67, 25 L.Ed. 244 (1878). After more than a century of wrestling with the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause, the Supreme Court brought constitutional religious-accommodation doctrine full circle in Smith, upholding without accommodation neutral laws of general applicability. *1186Writing for the majority, Justice Scalia echoed Chief Justice Waite\u2019s sentiment:\nIf the \u201ccompelling interest\u201d test is to be applied at all, then, it must be applied across the board, to all actions thought to be religiously commanded. .Moreover, if \u201ccompelling .interests\u201d really means what it says (and watering it down here would subvert its rigor in the other fields where it is applied), many laws will not meet the test. Any society adopting such a system would be courting anarchy, but that danger increases in direct proportion to the society\u2019s diversity of religious beliefs, and its determination to coerce or suppress none of them.\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 888, 110 S.Ct. at 1605 (emphasis added). It is. hard to fathom a plainer statement of the risks of reinstitut-ing a policy of religious accommodation.\nYet it was against this very backdrop that Congress enacted RFRA in 1993. And Congress specifically declared that by adopting the demands of strict scrutiny it intended to depart, from the less-protective constitutional . standard announced in Smith. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb(4). To .the extent that the standard RFRA imposes raises policy concerns, criticisms on this front are best addressed to Congress, and may find appropriate shelter in the pages of law reviews. But as federal judges we are duty-bound to follow and apply the laws Congress actually enacted, not as we might wish them to be. \u201cThe wisdom of Congress\u2019s judgment on this matter is not our concern. Our responsibility is to enforce RFRA as written, and under the standard that RFRA prescribes,\u201d Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2785, the accommodation, no less than the contraceptive mandate itself, imposes a substantial burden on.religious exercise..\nB.\nSecond, the majority fails to appreciate the crucial role in providing religiously objectionable contraceptive coverage that the accommodation foists on eligible organizations. The majority believes- that the accommodation places no burden on the beliefs of Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses because the \u201csignificance they attribute to this act [of opting out]\u201d is misguided, and thus the outcome of this case is not controlled by the- otherwise-identical analysis in Hobby Lobby. See ante at 1148. According to the majority, \u201c[t]he ACA and HRSA guidelines\u201d are what \u201centitle women who are plan participants and beneficiaries covered by group health insurance plans to contraceptive coverage without cost sharing\u201d \u2014 \u201cnot the opt out.\u201d See id. at 1149. This is so even though the majority \u201cacknowledge[s] that an eligible organization\u2019s act of [opting out] results in the TPA\u2019s designation as the plan administrator\u201d under ERISA and \u201cmay be an incidental cause of contraceptive coverage being provided.\u201d Id. at 1147-48. Boiled down to its bare essentials, the-majority\u2019s position is that if the parties really understood what is going on, they would have no basis to object to their role in the contraceptive mandate\u2019s-regulatory scheme.\nIt is the majority, however, that misunderstands the contraceptive m\u00e1ndate. Under its regulatory scheme, as bounded by the statutory requirements of the ACA and ERISA,30 the Government becomes *1187empowered to require contraceptive coverage for an eligible organization\u2019s self-insured health plan only if that organization affirmatively opts out under the accommodation. A third-party administrator of a self-insured health plan \u201cbears the legal obligation to provide contraceptive coverage only upon receipt of a valid self-certification.\u201d 31 Wheaton College v. Burwell, 573 U.S. \u2014, - n. 6, 134 S.Ct. 2806, 2814 n. 6, 189 L.Ed.2d 856 (2014) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). The majority is incorrect, then, to say that the contraceptive mandate \u201cdoes' not turn on whether [an] eligible organization employer chooses to comply with the law.\u201d See ante at 1149. Federal law kicks in only after an eligible organization acts; should an eligible organization decline to do anything, the Government lacks an independent means to ensure the provision of contraceptive coverage. Because the regulations condition the provision of contraceptive coverage on eligible organizations\u2019 affirmative participation, their participation is the linchpin on which the contraceptive mandate rests.\nTo draw an analogy with which any first-year law student should be well acquainted, an eligible organization\u2019s opting out under the accommodation is both an actual and proximate cause of the provision of contraceptive coverage. There can be. no doubt that opting out under the accommodation is a \u201ccause in fact\u201d of providing contraceptive coverage. But for opting out, the Government would lack the requisite regulatory authority over the third-party administrators of the organizations\u2019 health plans. Cf. Stacy v. Knickerbocker Ice Co., 84 Wis. 614, 54 N.W. 1091 (1893) (noting that without defendant\u2019s cutting and removing of surface ice, uncontrolled horses would not have fallen through a frozen lake). The majority contests whether the act of opting out also meets some standard of \u201clegal\u201d or \u201cproximate\u201d cause. See Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339, 162 N.E. 99, 104 (1928) (Andrews, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhat we do mean by the word \u2018proximate\u2019 is that, because of convenience, of public policy, of \u00e1 rough sense of justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point; That is not logic, it is practical politics.\u201d). According to the majority, because federal law entails the authorization to require third-party administrators to provide contraceptive coverage, opting out is only \u201can incidental cause of contraceptive coverage being provided.\u201d See ante at 1147-48.\nI fail to see, however, how affirmatively opting out \u2019of the contraceptive mandate under the accommodation could be deemed anything other than a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d or \u201cmaterial concurring cause\u201d directly leading to the provision of religiously objectionable coverage. Anderson v. Minneapolis, St. Paul &amp; Sault Ste. Marie Ry. Co., 146 Minn. 430, 436-37, 439, 179 N.W. 45 (1920). Opting out under the accommodation sets in motion a chain of events leading t\u00f3 the provision of contraceptive coverage as inexorably as night follows day.32 Once an employer opts out, only then does the Government become authorized to regulate third-party administrators. *1188See Grace Sch. v. Burwell, 801 F.3d 788, 808 (7th Cir.2015) (Manion, J., dissenting) (describing \u201cthe accommodation\u2019s tangled mess\u201d as \u201cthe long and -winding extension cord the government uses to power its contraceptive mandate\u201d). So authorized, there can be no doubt that the Government will in turn flex its newfound regulatory muscle to require the provision of contraceptive coverage.\nThis clear and uninterrupted causal chain holds whether an employer sends Form 700 directly to its third-party administrator or submits less-formal notice indirectly to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, just as a pilot reaches his destination as certainly flying direct. as with a. layover,. An employer connecting these dots would hardly need the insight of Henry Friendly,to. conclude that its actipns caused, in a direct and material fashion, the religiously objectionable outcome. \u201cAfter all, if the. form were meaningless, why would the Government require it?\u201d Priests for Life v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., 808 F.3d 1, 20 (D.C.Cir.2015) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc)\nBut this analogy can b\u00e9 stretched only so far. Common-law principles of causation, however fundamental to our legal heritage, are simply too unreliable a light to guide RFRA\u2019s substantial-burden analysis.33 Reading into RFRA some sort of proximate-cause limitation would reintroduce the exact same \u201cattenuation]\u201d argu-. ment rejected by the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby for \u2018\u2018dodging] the question that RFRA presents.\u201d 573 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2777-78. To do so would be an illegitimate foray into the realm of personal faith, and federal courts are \u201csingularly ill equipped\u201d to parse the moral reasoning and theological conclusions of religious believers, especially in light of secular judges\u2019 unspecified and almost certainly inconsistent determinations of legal causation. Thomas, 450 U.S. at 715, *1189101 S.Ct. at 1431. No matter how elaborate the Rube Goldberg machine the Government manages to jerry-rig, it is simply not our place to decide for Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses their degree of complicity when forced to topple the initial domino;\nAccordingly, for eligible organizations that object to opting out under the accommodation, the contraceptive mandate burdens their religious exercise to the same impermissible extent as the plaintiffs\u2019 in Hobby'Lobby.\nIII.\nConcluding that the .contraceptive mandate substantially burdens Eternal Word Television Network\u2019s and the Dioceses\u2019 religious exercise does not end the matter. The Government can still prevail if it is able to show that the contraceptive mandate is \u201cin furtherance of a compelling governmental interest\u201d and the accommodation is \u201cthe least restrictive'means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\u201d' 42U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb-1(b).\nThe Government fails to make this showing. For purposes of this opinion, I assume that the accommodation serves \u201ca legitimate and compelling interest in the health, of female employees.\u201d34 See Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. -, -, 134 S.Ct. 2751, 2786, 189 L.Ed.2d 675 (2014) (Kennedy, J., concurring). There is no need to reach the merits of this assumed compelling interest, whatever its exact nature, because the accommodation is not the least-restrictive means capable of achieving any government interest that could conceivably be called compelling. Accord id. at -, 134 S.Ct at 2779-80 (Alito, J.).\nIV.\nIf the notion that the accommodation does not substantially burden religious exercise is \u201c[rjpbbish,\u201d Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v. Sec\u2019y, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., 756 F.3d 1339, 1347 (11th Cir.2014) (William Pryor, J., concurring), then the majority\u2019s further notion that the contraceptive mandate passes RFRA\u2019s \u201cexceptionally demanding\u201d scrutiny is rubbish on stilts. Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. \u2014, -, 134 S.Ct. 2751, 2780, 189 L.Ed.2d 675 (2014); In codifying the familiar language of strict scrutiny \u2014 the \u201cmost demanding test known to constitutional law,\u201d City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 534, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 2171, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997)\u2014 Congress erected RFRA as a mighty bulwark, entrenching against Government incursion the freedom of religious liberty throughout the United States Code. To surmount these protections, the Government has the burden of \u201cshowing] that it lacks other' means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion by the objecting parties.\u201d Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct.at 2780. Carrying this burden is no mean feat. \u201cIf a less restrictive means is available for the Government to achieve its goals, the Government must use it.\u201d Holt v. Hobbs, 574 U.S. \u2014\u2014, -, 135 S.Ct. 853, 864, 190 L.Ed.2d 747 (2015) (Quoting United States v. Playboy Entm\u2019t Grp., Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 815, 120 S.Ct. 1878, 1887, 146 L.Ed.2d 865 (2000)) (alteration omitted).\n*1190So, is there a less-restrictive alternative of ensuring that the female employees of employers with religious objections to the contraceptive mandate nonetheless continue to receive cost-free access to the challenged services? Of course there is. As the Hobby Lobby majority observed: \u201cThe most straightforward way of doing this would be for the Government to assume the cost of providing\u201d the objectionable contraceptive coverage. 573 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2780. Though the Court did not ultimately need to reach the question of whether direct Government provision of contraceptive coverage would constitute a less-restrictive alternative because the plaintiffs did not object to the accommodation, id. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2780-82, we must do so here. And I fail to see any reason why the Court\u2019s persuasive reasoning-should not be adopted. The Government has not shown, as it must, that it would be able to provide the same access to contraceptive coverage to the same women only if it can force eligible organizations to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.\nSpeaking bluntly, RFRA makes the Government put its money where its mouth is. I see nothing in RFRA\u2019s text or the subsequent case law that would allow the Government to claim a compelling interest without having to spend a single red cent to do anything about.it. Significant here, the Government must necessarily agree that RFRA compels it to fund contraceptive coverage-otherwise the accommodation would not exist at all. Indeed, the entire purpose of the accommodation is to make the provision of contraceptive coverage independent of the eligible organization, including segregating all the costs paid by the eligible organization from all the expenditures for the objectionable services. Aware of the fallacy of free-lunch thinking and absent any expectation of third-party administrators acting out of purely eleemosynary impulse, the Government committed itself to funding contraceptive coverage for certain religious objectors,35 albeit in roundabout fashion.\nTo be clear, the Government is already committed to fund the contraceptive mandate under the current regulations. The Government reimburses third-party administrators required to fund contraceptive coverage through a reduction in Federally-facilitated Exchange user fees, the amount of money paid to be able to offer insurance products on exchanges established by' the Government under the ACA.36 Money is fungible; the Govern*1191ment finds itself in the same financial position whether it declines to collect a tax liability of $500 or whether it collects the $500 and then immediately refunds the same. By forgoing revenue to fund the contraceptive coverage for the female employees of eligible organizations that opt out under the accommodation, the Government is effectively paying for the objectionable coverage. And in contrast to the half-measure of the accommodation\u2014 which covers only a limited set of religiously objecting employers and does not provide access to the female employees of churches and church-affiliated organizations, employers with grandfathered health plans, or employers with fewer than fifty full-time employees37 \u2014 providing for contraceptive coverage directly without the accommodation\u2019s administrative: rigmarole would allow the Government to offer cost-free access to each and every-woman in the United States should it choose to do so. And the Government has failed to shoulder its burden to show that it would be unable to grant women access to- contraceptive coverage without the coerced involvement of Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses.\nAgain, this straightforward application of well-established legal principles should carry the day. But, again, the majority thinks otherwise. Specifically, the majority concludes that the current iteration of the contraceptive mandate has finally hit upon the least restrictive means of achieving the Government\u2019s compelling, interest when \u201cthe cost to the government\u201d and \u201cthe burden the alternatives impose on the affected women\u201d are taken into account. See ante at 1158. Though I do not dispute that these concerns are relevant to the least-restrictive-means inquiry, I cannot agree with the majority that they save the contraceptive mandate from RFRA\u2019s exceptionally demanding scrutiny.\nThe arguments advanced in the majority\u2019s apology for the contraceptive mandate seem to rest largely on speculative and overblown logistical problems the Government might face if it were held responsible for furthering its asserted compelling interest. According to the majority, if the Government were forced to provide contraceptive coverage \u201coutside the existing, largely employer-based, insurance system,\u201d whether directly or through tax credits, \u201cCongress would need to pass legislation that would fundamentally change how the majority of Americans receive\u201d contraceptive coverage specifically, if not healthcare generally. See id. at 1159. Likewise, if forced to keep the current model of providing contraceptive coverage through eligible organizations\u2019 health plans, \u201cthe government would be hamstrung\u201d because of the \u201cgaps\u201d in institutional knowledge that would spring up re-g\u00e1rdi\u00f1g which female employees of which employers would be covered by the Government and which are not. Id. at 1160. As a result, because the majority believes that adopting any of the alternatives it considers would incur various administrative and transactions costs, the result would be less access to contraceptive cov*1192erage, undermining the Government\u2019s asserted compelling interest. See id. at 1158-59,1161.\nThe majority\u2019s insistence on assuming a virtually immutable regulatory and statutory status ' quo is fundamentally' misplaced. RFRA makes clear that it is the \u201cGovernment \u201d that \u201cshall not substantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion,\u201d 42 U.S.C., \u00a7 2000bb-1(a) (emphasis added), not just constituent parts acting within their respective spheres of .authority. In Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, for example, the Supreme Court specifically rejected the Government\u2019s position \u201cthat the .Controlled Substances Act is [not] amenable to judicially crafted exceptions [for the hallucinogen hoasca]\u201d because of \u201cthe existence of a congressional exemption for peyote.\u201d 546 U.S. 418, 434, 126 S.Ct. 1211, 1222, 163 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2006). It would be absurd to say, then, that we cannot grant a judicially crafted exception here because the relevant administrative agencies lacked the regulatory authority to promulgate exceptions that would have been equally effective in achieving an allegedly compelling interest had there been congressional action allowing them to do so. In short, if the Government as a whole has a less-restrictive alternative available, the Government must use it.\nThe majority\u2019s radically revisionist account of RFRA, in contrast, would limit the universe of less-restrictive means to what the Executive Branch can accomplish unilaterally by administrative f\u00edat. This is a shocking reversal of our Constitution\u2019s prime directive: \u201cAll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.\u201d U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 1. To the extent that the Government claims an* interest of the highest order, it is only reasonable that Congress be expected to pitch in when freewheeling regulators encounter statutory roadblocks. The practical' hurdles to providing the access to contraceptive coverage the Government seeks would simply disappear if Congress were to slightly tweak the contraceptive mandate\u2019s statutory authorization under ERISA and the ACA. By having Congress eliminate the need for eligible organizations to affirmatively designate the third-party administrators of their'health plans \u2014 thus becoming directly involved in the provision \"of the objectionable coverage \u2014 the Departments of Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services wo\u00fald no longer need to substantially burden eligible organizations by putting them to the \u201cchoice\u201d of affirmatively violating their sincerely held beliefs or paying massive penalties. \u2018 And the Government has failed- to show why this could be accomplished without imposing any additional burden on female employees only if eligible organizations were required to use the accommodation.38\nFinally,' the fate of the contraceptive mandate under RFRA is complicated by the Government\u2019s decision to condition benefits flowing to third parties on actions taken by religious objectors in violation of their beliefs. I agree that granting an exemption that would impose costs on third parties could, under pertain circumstances, run afoul of the Establishment *1193Clause of the First Amendment. See Corp. of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 334-35, 107 S.Ct. 2862, 2868, 97 L.Ed.2d 273 (1987) (\u201cAt some point, accommodation may devolve into \u2018an unlawful fostering of religion.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm\u2019n of Fla., 480 U.S. 136, 145, 107 S.Ct. 1046, 1051, 94 L.Ed.2d 190 (1987))). But such an eventuality alone does not automatically transform the Government\u2019s chosen means into the least-restrictive alternative required by RFRA. As the Supreme Court reiterated in upholding the constitutionality of RLUIPA, RFRA\u2019s sister statute, \u201c \u2018there is room for play in the joints between\u2019 the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses, allowing the government to accommodate religion beyond free exercise requirements, without offense' to the Establishment Clause.\u201d Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 713, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 2117, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005) (quoting Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S. 712, 718, 124 S.Ct. 1307, 1311, 158 L.Ed.2d 1 (2004)). Granting Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses an exemption from the contraceptive mandate falls well within the space allowed for \u201cplay in the joints,\u201d wherever those exact boundaries may lie.\nHere, the Government is essentially asking for a free pass on RFRA\u2019s least-restrictive-means requirement because the administrative agencies responsible' for crafting the contraceptive mandate decided \u2014 for administrative convenience \u2014 to tie the provision of contraceptive coverage to eligible organizations\u2019 affirmative participation in an elaborate regulatory scheme. If we were to honor the Government\u2019s request, anytime regulators wanted to immunize their slapdash efforts, regardless of the potential alternatives, they need only condition a benefit to third parties on any substantial burden placed on religious exercise. Lest RFRA is understood to have ushered in the apotheosis of the administrative state, surely the rigorous standard of\u2018strict scrutiny cannot be so easily evaded. \u2022 \u25a0 \u2022\nWithout a doubt, there are sundry ways for the Government to provide women with cost-free' access to contraceptive coverage. The administrative agencies tasked with promulgating the 'regulatory structure that undergirds the contraceptive mandate chose, because of convenience and their bounded statutory authority, to do so in a manner that substantially burdens' religious adherents. We have been presented insufficient evidence to hold that the goal of increasing access to contraceptive coverage could be reached only \"through the circuitous regulatory pathways that have been cobbled together here. The Government, therefore, has failed to carry its burden to show that the contraceptive mandate is' the least restrictive means of furthering any'assumed compelling interest. '\nv;\nThe sweeping protections for religious exercise Congress contemplated when it enacted RFRA should not be denied- to Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses. RFRA\u2019s text and purpose, as confirmed by well-established precedent, extend these protections to religious adherents forced to choose between affirmatively participating in a regulatory scheme that they sincerely - believe would make them complicit in denigrating the sanctity of human life and paying millions of dollars in noncompliance penalties. Because the Government cannot show that the latest iteration of its constantly evolving \u201caccommodation\u201d survives strict scrutiny, RFRA bars enforcing the contraceptive mandate against those employers whose religious exercise it substantially burdens.\nBy concluding otherwise, the majority diminishes the full range of religious liber*1194ty that Congress sought to protect when it enacted RFRA. Recasting and enfeebling RFRA\u2019s standard as nothing more than \u201cgood enough for government work\u201d is a far cry from strict scrutiny\u2019s typical charge of fiat justitia,mat caelum39 Perhaps the majority\u2019s desire to bring RFRA\u2019s statutory protections for religious liberty closer in line with the less-demanding constitutional standard represents a superior policy judgment. Perhaps not. In any event, the majority\u2019s application of \u201cwater[ed] down\u201d strict scrutiny is exactly the sort of wishy-yrashy treatment likely to \u201csubvert its rigors in the other fields where it applies\u201d that motivated the Supreme Court\u2019s Smith decision in the first place. See Emp\u2019t Div., Dep\u2019t of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 888, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 1605, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990). But by enacting RFRA, Congress confirmed that strict scrutiny \u201creally means what it says.\u201d Id.; see also Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. at - n. 3, 134 S.Ct. at 2761 n. 3. Regardless of individual judges\u2019 views of the wisdom motivating RFRA, that was Congress\u2019s call to make.\nRespectfully, I DISSENT.\n\n.The Institute of Medicine\u2019s recommendations, were laid, out in its report Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps, which was released on July 19, 2011 Like much of the ACA, that report and the process used to generate it sparked significant controversy, prompting public backlash and a dissent from one of the committee members.

The organization must make such self-certification or notice available for examination upon request by the first day of the first plan year to which the accommodation in paragraph (c) of this section applies. The self-certification or notice must be executed by a person authorized to make the- certification or notice on behalf of \u25a0 the organization, and must be maintained in a manner consistent with the record retention requirements under section 107 of BRISA.\n\n\n. For example. Eternal Word Television Network has a self-insured health plan for which Blue bross Blue Shield of Alabama serves as third-party administrator. The Dioceses col- ' lectively maintain three self-insured health plans, for all of which Meritain Health serves as third-party, administrator. Though Blue Cross .Blue Shield of Alabama and Meritain Health m\u00e1y \"separately offer insured plans, they are not responsible for paying the claims of Eternal Word Television Network's and the Dioceses\u2019 beneficiaries. '\u25a0\n\n\n; In the pre-Wheaton College iteration of- the contraceptive mandate, there was only one way to opt out under the accommodation: submitting Employee Benefits \" Security Administration Form 700 to the relevant insurer or third-party administrator. See infra n. 11.\n\n\n. A copy of Form 700 is-appended to the majority\u2019s opinion.\n\n\n. The reason that eligible organizations are given two similar-seeming options for opting out of the contraceptive mandate stems from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Wheaton College v. Burwell, 573 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2806, 189 L.Ed.2d 856 (2014). In Wheaton College, the. Supreme Court enjoined enforcement of the contraceptive mandate against an eligible organization that sent written notice to the Government but objected, based on the organization's religious beliefs, to sending Form 700 to its insurer and third-party administrator. Id. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 2807. The Court did not address the situation presented here where an eligible organization objects, on religious grounds, both to completing Form 700 and to providing less-formal notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\n\n. Because this case does not involve eligible organizations with insured plans, I pass no judgment on the accommodation in that context.\n\n\n. As mentioned above, eligible organizations that administer their own self-insured plans are not subject to the contraceptive mandate under the regulations.\n\n\n. Under ERISA, a third-party administrator that is neither the \u2018\u2018plan sponsor\u201d nor specifically designated as such can be considered the \u201cplan administrator\u201d only \u201cas the Secretary [of Labor] may by regulation prescribe.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(16)(A)(iii). The Government contends that, as currently written, the ACA\u2019s implementing regulations also allow it to independently enforce the contraceptive mandate against third-party administrators of self-insured plans without any further action from the eligible organization. The truth of this contention is far from certain. See ante at 1149 &amp; nn. 30-31; Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., 801 F.3d 927, 935 n. 8 (8th Cir.2015) (collecting cases contrary to the Government's position). In any event, I decline to pass judgment on this question because its resolution is unnecessary to decide this case.\n\n\n. If a third-party administrator declines to provide contraceptive coverage, eligible organizations with self-insured plans must select another willing third-party administrator, administer its own health plan, or become subject to the monetary penalties discussed above.\n\n\n. Specifically, the regulations contemplate \u201cadjustments\u201d to the third-party administrator's own user fees, if the third-parly administrator also offers health plans on a Federally-facilitated Exchange, or the user fees of another participating insurer that the third-party administrator contracts with to receive reimbursement. See 80 Fed.Reg. at 41328. Third-party administrators are to be reimbursed for the \"total dollar amount of the payments for contraceptive services\u201d and an \"allowance for administrative costs and margin\u201d of \u201cno less than 10 percent\u201d for the amount spent on contraceptive services. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 156.50(d)(3)(i), (ii). The Government does not address how reimbursement will be made, if at all, should these user fees *1176prove insufficient. Cf. King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. -, -, 135 S.Ct. 2480, 2487, 192 L.Ed.2d 483 (2015) (noting that the ACA contemplates that each state will create its own exchange),\n\n\n. RFRA originally- applied to the actions of state governments as well, but the Supreme Court held that extending RFRA\u2019s mandate to the states exceeded Congress's powers under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997).\n\n\n. Though the bulk of this litigation has been brought under RFRA, at least one non-religious employer has challenged the contraceptive mandate under the Fifth Amendment. See March for Life v. Burwell, No. 14-cv-1149(RJL), 128 F.Supp.3d 116, 2015 WL 5139099 (D.D.C. Aug. 31, 2015) (concluding that the contraceptive mandate violates equal-protection principles because it lacks a rational basis for discriminating between religious and non-religious objectors). Because this case involves- only employers with religious objections and is resolved by RFRA\u2019s clear dictates, I decline to address the constitutional propriety of applying the contraceptive mandate to nonreligious objectors.\n\n\n.Justice Alito wrote the majority opinion in Hobby Lobby, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia and Thomas. Justice Kennedy - concurred. Justice Ginsburg dissented, joined in full by Justice Sotomayor and in relevant part by Justices Breyer and Kagan.\n\n\n. Requiring the Government to, at times, spend additional monies to avoid imposing substantial burdens, on the free exercise of religious objectors would accord with RFRA\u2019s sister statute, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\u201cRLUIPA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000cc, 2000cc-1. See id. \u00a7 2000cc-3(c) (\u201d[T]his chapter may require a government to incur expenses in its own operations to avoid imposing a substantial burden on religious exercise.\u201d). Congress enact-\u00e9d RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending and Commerce Clauses after the Supreme Court in City of Boerne held that RFRA could not be applied to the actions of state governments under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See supra note 17. The standard of RLUIPA mir*1178rors that of RFRA and applies in two contexts: land-use regulation and the religious exercise of institutionalized persons,\n\n\n. Chief Justice Roberts .and Justices Alito, Thomas, Kennedy, and Breyer joined the Court's decision in Wheaton College. Justice Scalia concurred without issuing a separate opinion. Justice Sotomayor dissented, joined by Justices Ginsburg and Kagan.\n\n\n. Lumping together these decisions in this manner necessarily misses some of their nuance. Again, this case is limited to eligible organizations with self-insured health plans overseen by third-party administrators that object, on religious grounds, to the accommodation.\n\n\n. Though Hobbs involved a claim brought under RLUIPA rather than RFRA, both statutes impose the same standard for substantial burdens of-religious exercise. See, e.g., Midrash Sephardi, Inc. v. Town of Surfside, 366 F.3d 1214, 1227 (11th Cir.2004),\n\n\n. Should it fail to comply with the contraceptive mandate, Eternal Word Television Network would face annual penalties of up to $12,775,000 for its 350 full-time employees. See Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v. Sec'y, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., 756 F.3d 1339, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2014) (William Pryor, J., specially concurring in order granting injunction pending appeal). The Dioceses\u2019 three health plans are collectively responsible for almost 2,000 employees and would be subject to roughly $73,000,000 per year. See Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta v. Sebelius, No. 1:12-cv-03489-WSD, 2014 WL 1256373, at *2 (N.D.Ga. Mar. 26, 2014); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980D(b)(1).\n\n\n. Many faith traditions proscribe some or all forms of dancing, including various denominations of Christianity, islam, and Judaism.\n\n\n. Indeed, it appears that Congress has contemplated adopting such a measure. See H.R. Res. 667, 113th Cong. (2014) (as introduced in the House, July 11, 2014) (\"Expressing support for dancing as a form of valuable exercise and artistic expression, and for the designation of July 26, 2014, as National Dance Day.\u201d).\n\n\n. Of course, people can and do sincerely believe that marijuana consumption serves a sacramental purpose. See, e.g., Olsen v. Drug Enf't Admin., 878 F.2d 1458 (D.C.Cir.1989).\n\n\n. See God bless John Oliver: latenight comedian forms his ' own church, The Guardian (Aug. 17, 2015), http://www.theguardian.com/ tv-and-radio/2015/au\u2019g/l 7/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-mega-church.\n\n\n. \u2018\u2018[T]hat one legislature cannot ,abridge the powers of a succeeding legislature\u201d and, thus, \u201cone legislature is competent to repeal any act which a former legislature was competent to pass\u201d is a foundational principle that \"can never be controverted.\u201d Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 87, 135, 3 L.Ed. 162 (1810). RFRA\u2019s protections are statutory, not mandated by the Constitution. Should it wish to do so, Congress remains free to alter the scrutiny to be applied to any particular law challenged under RFRA or to repeal RFRA altogether.\n\n\n. Some doubts have been raised as to the Government's exact ability to require third-party administrators to comply with the contraceptive mandate within the scope of its regulatory authority. See Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 801 F.3d 927, 941-42 (8th Cir.2015). To the extent such doubts linger, they are of no moment here. \"We need look no further than to the government\u2019s own litigation behavior to gauge the importance of self-certification in the regulatory scheme. If [third-party administrators] had a wholly independent obligation *1187to provide contraceptive coverage to religious objectors\u2019 employees and' plan beneficiaries, there would be no need to insist on ... compliance with the accommodation process.\u201d Id. at 942. .\n\n\n. Under the regulations currently in force, a valid self-certification is either Form 700. or the alternative notice sent to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 147.131(b)(3), (c).\n\n\n. Eternal Word Television Network and the Dioceses object only to their own, gov- . ernment-mandated participation under the contraceptive mandate. They do not \u2014 and indeed cannot \u2014 seek \"to require the Government itself to behave\u201d in accordance \u25a0 with their beliefs. See Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 696-700, 106 S.Ct. 2147, 2150-52, 90 L.Ed.2d 735 (1986) (denying relief to Abenaki man objecting on religious grounds to the Government\u2019s \u201c \u2018use\u2019 \u201d of his daugh*1188ter's already-issued Social Security number). The majority\u2019s reliance on Bowen and its ilk is, therefore; inapposite. '\nLikewise inapposite is the Majority\u2019s analogizing the accommodation to the process used by conscientious objectors to opt of a military draft. See ante at 1148. As Judge Manion puts it in his thorough debunking of this familiar trope,\nThis is not like the case of a- conscientious, objector who objects and the government finds a replacement. Under the regulations, the government does not find the replacement, the nonprofit does. The designation does not take place unless the nonprofit either delivers the self-certification form to its insurer or TP A, or uses the alternative notice to inform the government who its insurer or TPA is and which health plan is at issue. By insisting that the- nonprofit deliver the form or supply the plan information for the government's use, the government uses the objecting nonprofit to do its dirty-work. \u2022 \u25a0 The government has not provided an exit \u2014 it offers a revolving door with only one opening.\nThis is not the case of a conscientious objector walking into the draft board, voicing his objection, being excused, and walking out. For the analogy to fit the HHS accommodation, the draft board must decide that every objector will be replaced by the objector\u2019s friend, and the objector\u2019s objection is only effective if the objector delivers written notice of his objection' to his friend or tells the draft board who his friend is and where the board can find him. Then, the objector must send his friend money so that his friend will remain his friend for the purpose of being his replacement.\nGrace Sch. v. Burwell, 801 F.3d 788, 812 &amp; n. 11 (7th Cir.2015) (Manion, J., dissenting).\n\n\n. \"There is- perhaps nothing in the entire field of law which has called forth more disagreement, or upon which the opinions are in such a welter of confusion [as defining \u2018proximate cause\u2019]. Nor, despite the manifold attempts which have been made to clarify the ' subject, is there yet any general agreement as t\u00f3 the'best approach.\u201d W. Page Keeton, Dan B. Dobbs, Robert E. Keeton &amp; David G, Owen, Prosser and Keeton On Torts \u00a7 41 at 263 (5th ed. 1984).\n\n\n. I pause to note my skepticism of the Government's proposed gloss on the, compelling interest allegedly served by the contraceptive mandate. Providing \"seamless\u201d contraceptive coverage \u2014 that is, providing coverage without cost sharing or additional administrative hurdles \u2014 and identifying organizations that opt out of the contraceptive mandate . appear to me to-be derivative considerations of feasibility arid administrative convenience rather than compelling interests in their own right. As such, these considerations\u2018are better left to the least-restrictive-means prong of the RFRA inquiry.\n\n\n. Notably, the Government did not similarly commit itself to fund contraceptive coverage for female employees of other employers with religious objections \u2014 either churches and church-affiliated organizations or eligible organizations that maintain self-insured-health plans but do not use a third-party administrator. Nor did the Government commit itself to fund contraceptive coverage for female employees of employers with grandfathered plans or employers with fewer than fifty full-time .employees.\nThough there .may be some level of backstop coverage provided by the other provisions of the ACA. and Title X, see infra n. 36,, the Government's failure to extend its largesse to these women may also call into question the contraceptive mandate\u2019s asserted compelling interest \u2014 which, again, I assume the Government would be able to show \u2014 but certainly raises an obvious question: If the Government is able and willing to pay for some women to receive access to contraceptive coverage, why would it not be a less-restrictive means to do .so in a more straightforward manner for all women at risk of being denied such access?\n\n\n. As discussed above, third-party administrators may either reduce their own Federally-facilitated Exchange user fees if they are also in the business of selling insurance or they may enter into a contractual arrangement with another insurer to recoup that insurer\u2019s user fees. See 80 Fed.Reg. at 41328.\n\n\n. For female employees whose health plans are not subject to the contraceptive mandate, the Government has stitched together a patchwork safety net under Title X and other, provisions of the ACA. The record does not reveal how many women who would otherwise lack access to contraceptive services are eligible for coverage under this makeshift framework. Nor does the record reveal whether there are hundreds, thousands, or millions of women who will continue to go without such access, with or without the accommodation. Though a less-restrictive means need not be a perfect means, strict scrutiny demands that the Government\u2019s chosen solution must be \u201cneither seriously underinclusive nor seriously dverin-clusive.\u201d Brown v. Entm't Merchants Ass'n, 564 U.S. 786, 805, 131 S.Ct. 2729, 2741-42, 180 L.Ed.2d 708 (2011).\n\n\n. To the extent that there may. be additional administrative costs incurred in crafting an appropriately tailored exception to the contraceptive mandate, RFRA contemplates such costs and, places them squarely on the Government's shoulders. Even if the Government were to require female employees of exempt employers to fill out the sort of all- ' too-familiar paperwork associated with receiving health, insurance, such a \u201cburden\u201d\u2014 \u25a0 in contrast to being forced to either violate a sincere religious conviction or face steep monetary penalties \u2014 would be, at most, \u201cde minimis.\u201d Cf. Catholic Health Care Sys. v. Burwell, 796 F.3d 207, 220 (2d Cir.2015).\n\n\n. Let justice be done though the heavens may \u2022 fall.\n\n",
