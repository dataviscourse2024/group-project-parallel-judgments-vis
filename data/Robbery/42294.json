This is an appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal and a motion to arrest judgment. Contrary to the appellant\u2019s assertion, we find that the evidence was legally sufficient for the jury to conclude he had entered the subject residence without consent. See Baker v. State, 636 So.2d 1342 (Fla.1994); State v. Law, 559 So.2d 187 (Fla.1989); Downer v. State, 375 So.2d 840, 845 (Fla.1979).\nAffirmed.\n",
