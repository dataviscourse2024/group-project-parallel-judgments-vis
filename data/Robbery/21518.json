Konstantopoulos, Assistant State\u2019s\n                  Attorneys, of counsel), for the People.\n\n\n\nPanel             JUSTICE NEVILLE delivered the judgment of the court, with\n                  opinion.\n                  Presiding Justice Pierce and Justice Hyman concurred in the judgment\n                  and opinion.\n\f                                               OPINION\n\n\u00b61         Following a bench trial, Dejuan Harris, the defendant, was convicted of armed robbery and\n       sentenced to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Harris contends that his conviction for armed\n       robbery should be vacated or reduced to robbery because the evidence was insufficient to\n       establish that he was armed with a dangerous weapon that could be used as a bludgeon.\n\u00b62         We find that the State failed to present evidence that the defendant was armed with a gun\n       that had the weight or composition (metallic nature) of a dangerous weapon. Therefore, we\n       hold that the evidence presented by the State failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that\n       the gun was a dangerous weapon because it could be used as a bludgeon. Accordingly, we\n       reverse Harris\u2019s armed robbery conviction and remand for the trial court to enter a judgment of\n       conviction for robbery.\n\n\u00b63                                           BACKGROUND\n\u00b64         Harris and the codefendant, Deleon Dixon, who has a separate appeal (No. 1-13-3303),\n       were charged with two counts of armed robbery and two counts of aggravated unlawful\n       restraint. Count II, which is pertinent to this appeal, charged both defendants with armed\n       robbery in that they knowingly took property from the person or presence of Abdelaziz\n       Almasri by the use of force or by threatening the imminent use of force, and that they carried,\n       on or about their persons or were otherwise armed with, a dangerous weapon that could be\n       used as a bludgeon.\n\u00b65         At the simultaneous, but severed bench trials of Harris and Dixon, Almasri testified, on\n       direct examination through an interpreter, that he owned a store at 256 West 59th Street in\n       Chicago. Almasri explained that he was in the back of the store when he saw men looking\n       through the windows at about 9 a.m. on September 15, 2012. Almasri became suspicious and\n       walked to the front of the store and locked himself inside the office.\n\u00b66         Dixon and Harris entered the store and Dixon, who was holding what appeared to be a gun\n       in the air, told Almasri not to move. While Dixon stood by the door with the gun, Harris\n       jumped behind the counter and started removing lottery tickets, cigarettes, and medicine.\n       Harris then took the gun from Dixon and stood by the front door while Dixon removed similar\n       items from behind the counter. Both men then fled the store.\n\u00b67         Almasri chased the men, but the defendants got into a car and drove away. Almasri notified\n       the police, and, when they arrived, he viewed the store\u2019s surveillance videotape with an officer.\n\u00b68         During cross-examination by Dixon\u2019s attorney, Almasri testified that he did not see a\n       weapon when the defendants entered the store. When Almasri was asked if he told Sergeant\n       Pagan that he did not see a weapon, he testified that he did not recall exactly what he said.\n       Finally, Almasri testified \u201c[a]ctually, I saw him in the video camera with a gun.\u201d\n\u00b69         When cross-examined by Harris\u2019s attorney, Almasri testified that when the defendants\n       entered the store, he did not see a weapon. But, Almasri testified that when he looked from his\n       office window, he saw the gun when the defendant raised his hand.\n\u00b6 10       Sergeant Dennis Pagan testified that he met with Almasri at his store and viewed the\n       surveillance video. Almasri told Sergeant Pagan that he was not sure that he actually saw a\n       weapon, and only confirmed that he saw a weapon when he looked at the surveillance video.\n\n\n                                                   -2-\n\f\u00b6 11       The surveillance videotape was admitted into evidence. It showed Harris and Dixon\n       holding what appeared to be a handgun.\n\u00b6 12       Harris and Dixon were subsequently arrested in connection with the subject robbery, but\n       no weapon or proceeds were recovered.\n\u00b6 13       After the State rested, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict\n       on all counts, except for count II (armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, i.e., a bludgeon).\n\u00b6 14       Following closing arguments, the trial court found Harris guilty of armed robbery with a\n       dangerous weapon. In making its finding, the court stated:\n                   \u201cWhen you look at the video, there is no mistaking that there is a weapon there, that\n               there is a gun. It is quite a large gun, a handgun and it\u2019s clearly visible on the videotape\n               ***.\n                   ***\n                   The other question is whether or not *** I could find or should find that the weapon\n               that is admitted in *** Dixon\u2019s statement to be a BB gun.\n                   Whether or not that could be a bludgeon and based on its size and what I observed\n               on the tape to be metallic in nature and based on the way that it was manipulated in this\n               event, it is very clear that it was a bludgeon to be used to strike anyone in the store and\n               could have foiled the effort to rob the store and certainly, it was used in a manner to\n               threaten the victim in this case ***.\n                   ***\n                   The images are very clear. And that exist independently of what [the victim] said or\n               didn\u2019t say in the course of his testimony. I want to predicate that by saying that in my\n               view, [the victim] is correctly and independently and accurately identified the\n               defendants here today as to what occurred at the incident.\n                   Certainly, it could be argued it\u2019s not completely on point here. I will indicate that\n               [the victim\u2019s] testimony was more than sufficient when compared to all the other\n               evidence in the case to convict the defendants of armed robbery.\n                   It certainly could be argued that the videotape in and of itself would have been\n               sufficient had it been appropriately marked and entered into evidence with only an\n               indication that this armed robbery had occurred by the victim and had a specific date,\n               time and location to convict the defendants.\n                   But, as I said, [the victim\u2019s] testimony was excellent and I am going to find them\n               guilty of using a\u2013this weapon, the one that I see in the videotape as a bludgeon.\u201d\n\u00b6 15       On appeal, Harris contends that his conviction for armed robbery should be vacated or\n       reduced to robbery because the State failed to establish that the weapon used was dangerous. In\n       particular, defendant points out that the gun was not admitted into evidence, and maintains that\n       the State failed to present evidence that the gun was capable of being used as a bludgeon.\n\n\u00b6 16                                         ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 17                                     Standard of Review\n\u00b6 18      Here, Harris is challenging the trial court\u2019s findings that the defendant\u2019s gun was a\n       dangerous weapon because it was metallic and could be used as a bludgeon. Harris also\n       challenges the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination that he was guilty of armed robbery.\n\n\n                                                    -3-\n\f       Whether an object is sufficiently susceptible to use in a manner likely to cause serious injury so\n       that it qualifies as a dangerous weapon is generally a question of fact. People v. Ross, 229 Ill.\n       2d 255, 275 (2008); People v. Thorne, 352 Ill. App. 3d 1062, 1071 (2004). However, the\n       question becomes one of law where the character of the weapon is such as to admit of only one\n       conclusion. People v. Skelton, 83 Ill. 2d 58, 66 (1980).\n\u00b6 19       A trial court\u2019s findings based on testimonial evidence are entitled to great deference, but its\n       findings based on nontestimonial evidence (exhibits, such surveillance videos, admitted into\n       evidence) are not entitled to any deference. People v. Radojcic, 2013 IL 114197, \u00b6 34.\n\u00b6 20       Finally, a trial court\u2019s factual findings are not reversed unless they are against the manifest\n       weight of the evidence. People v. Absher, 242 Ill. 2d 77, 82 (2011). A trial court\u2019s findings are\n       against the manifest weight of the evidence only when an opposite conclusion is apparent or\n       when the findings appear to be unreasonable, arbitrary, or not based on the evidence. People v.\n       Clark, 2014 IL App (1st) 130222, \u00b6 26. When we consider the trial court\u2019s ultimate finding,\n       that the defendant was guilty of armed robbery, the standard of review is \u201c \u2018whether, after\n       viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact\n       could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis\n       omitted.) People v. Cooper, 194 Ill. 2d 419, 430-31 (2000) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443\n       U.S. 307, 318-19 (1979)).\n\n\u00b6 21                            Elements of the Offense of Armed Robbery\n\u00b6 22       In order to sustain a conviction for armed robbery, the trial court was required to find that\n       defendant, in committing a robbery, was armed with a dangerous weapon other than a firearm.\n       720 ILCS 5/18-2(a)(1) (West 2012).\n\u00b6 23       Dangerous objects are divided into three categories: \u201c(1) objects that are dangerous per se,\n       such as loaded guns; (2) objects that are not necessarily dangerous, but were actually used in a\n       dangerous manner during the robbery; and (3) objects that are not necessarily dangerous, but\n       may become dangerous when used in a dangerous manner.\u201d Ross, 229 Ill. 2d at 275; Thorne,\n       352 Ill. App. 3d at 1070-71.\n\u00b6 24       The three ways for the State to prove that a gun constituted a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d is by\n       presenting evidence that: (1) the gun was operable and loaded; (2) the gun was actually used\n       during the offense as a club or bludgeon; or (3) that due to the gun\u2019s size and weight, it was\n       capable of being used as a club or bludgeon. Ross, 229 Ill. 2d at 276; Thorne, 352 Ill. App. 3d\n       at 1072. The parties agree that only the third prong, whether the gun was capable of being used\n       as a club or bludgeon, is at issue.\n\n\u00b6 25                                   Trial Court\u2019s Factual Findings\n\u00b6 26       The threshold question we must answer in this case is how much deference must a\n       reviewing court give to the trial court\u2019s findings that the gun was metallic and a bludgeon.\n\u00b6 27       In Radojcic, the supreme court instructed reviewing courts on the amount of deference\n       accorded to a trial court\u2019s findings:\n                    \u201cAlthough a trial court\u2019s factual findings are accorded deference on review and will\n               only be reversed if they are against the manifest weight of the evidence, that deference\n               \u2018is grounded in the reality that the circuit court is in a superior position to determine and\n               weigh the credibility of the witnesses, observe the witnesses\u2019 demeanor, and resolve\n\n                                                     -4-\n\f               conflicts in their testimony.\u2019 [Citation.] Here, however, the State offered no live\n               testimony, only transcripts from the grand jury proceedings. Thus, the trial court did\n               not occupy a position superior to the appellate court or this court in evaluating the\n               evidence offered by the State ***.\u201d Radojcic, 2013 IL 114197, \u00b6 34.\n\u00b6 28       Here, the victim was not certain that he saw a weapon until he viewed the surveillance\n       video, and did not testify about the weapon\u2019s weight or composition (metallic). Thus, we find,\n       similarly to Radojcic, that the trial court based its findings, that the weapon was metallic and a\n       bludgeon, on the surveillance videotape and not on witness testimony. Therefore, given the\n       fact that the trial judge\u2019s findings were not based on witness testimony, but on his viewing of\n       the surveillance video, we are not required to be deferential to the trial court\u2019s findings\n       (Radojcic, 2013 IL 114197, \u00b6 34) and we can reverse those findings if they are against the\n       manifest weight of the evidence. Absher, 242 Ill. 2d at 82.\n\u00b6 29       In resolving the issue of whether the gun in this case was capable of being used as a\n       bludgeon, we find Ross instructive. In Ross, the defendant was charged with armed robbery.\n       The evidence showed that the defendant used a small BB gun during the robbery. Ross, 229 Ill.\n       2d at 276-77. The State failed to present the gun or photographs of the gun at trial and any\n       evidence that it was loaded, that it was used or brandished as a bludgeon, or any evidence\n       regarding its weight or composition. Id. at 277. The Ross court held that the evidence was\n       insufficient to prove that the gun was a dangerous weapon, and that the trial court incorrectly\n       based its ruling on the subjective feelings of the victim, rather than the objective nature of the\n       gun. Id. The supreme court then affirmed the decision of the appellate court directing the trial\n       court to enter a judgment of conviction for simple robbery and sentence the defendant\n       accordingly. Id.\n\u00b6 30       The Ross court relied on this court\u2019s decision in Thorne where, similar to Ross, the State\n       did not introduce the gun and proved only that the defendant had a small BB gun and that it was\n       a hard object. Thorne, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1073. The Thorne court held that because in every\n       case finding that an unloaded gun could have been used as a bludgeon, there was evidence\n       presented as to the physical characteristics (weight or metallic nature) of the weapon.\n       Therefore, because the State failed to present evidence concerning the weapon\u2019s physical\n       characteristics, Thorne\u2019s conviction for armed robbery was reduced to simple robbery. Id. at\n       1072-74.\n\u00b6 31       In this case, as in Ross and Thorne, the State failed to proffer the gun or to present evidence\n       that the gun was loaded or that it was used or brandished as a bludgeon. While the surveillance\n       videotape shows what appears to be a gun, there is no evidence regarding its weight or\n       composition. Ross, 229 Ill. 2d at 277; Thorne, 352 Ill. App. 3d at 1073. The victim testified that\n       he saw a \u201cgun,\u201d but (1) he did not testify about the gun\u2019s weight or composition, and (2) his\n       testimony was rebutted by Sergeant Pagan, who testified that the victim only confirmed that\n       the defendants were carrying a gun after viewing the surveillance videotape.\n\u00b6 32       In light of the preceding, we find that the State presented no gun and no evidence that the\n       weapon was a heavy, metal object from which it could be inferred that it was capable of being\n       used as a bludgeon.\n\u00b6 33       Although the trial court found that the gun was metallic and could have been used as a\n       bludgeon, we find the court\u2019s findings were not based on witness testimony about the gun\u2019s\n       physical characteristics, its weight or its composition. Instead, the trial court\u2019s findings were\n       based on nontestimonial evidence, the surveillance video. After examining the surveillance\n\n                                                    -5-\n\f       video, this court is unable to determine the gun\u2019s physical characteristics. Accordingly, we\n       hold that the trial court\u2019s findings were against the manifest weight of the evidence because the\n       findings were not based on the evidence, where there was no testimonial evidence that the\n       weapon had the weight or composition (metallic) of a dangerous weapon (People v. Clark,\n       2014 IL App (1st) 130222, \u00b6 26), and the weapon\u2019s physical characteristics could not be\n       determined from the nontestimonial evidence, the surveillance video.\n\n\u00b6 34                                  Trial Court\u2019s Ultimate Finding\n\u00b6 35       Therefore, we find, following Ross, that the trial court erroneously based its ultimate\n       finding\u2013the armed robbery conviction of Harris\u2013on the subjective feelings of the victim, who\n       believed he saw a gun (Skelton, 83 Ill. 2d at 63 (complainants\u2019 subjective beliefs are\n       insufficient to establish that an object is a dangerous weapon)), rather than the testimonial\n       evidence in the record. Ross, 229 Ill. 2d at 277.\n\u00b6 36       Accordingly, considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the State: (1) the\n       conflicting evidence as to whether the victim saw the offenders with the gun in the store or\n       only saw the offenders with a gun after viewing the surveillance video, and (2) the fact that\n       there is no evidence in the record as to the gun\u2019s weight or composition, or that the gun was\n       loaded or used as a bludgeon, we cannot come to the conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt,\n       that the gun in this case was a dangerous weapon that could be used as a bludgeon. Therefore,\n       Harris\u2019s conviction for armed robbery is reversed and the cause remanded for the trial court to\n       enter a judgment for robbery.\n\u00b6 37       In light of the foregoing, we hereby reverse the judgment of conviction for armed robbery\n       and remand the cause to the circuit court with directions to enter a judgment of conviction for\n       robbery and to impose an appropriate sentence thereon.\n\n\u00b6 38      Reversed and cause remanded with directions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   -6-\n\f",
