Introduction\n\n      A jury convicted Appellant Dedrick D. Thomas, Jr. of two counts of\n\naggravated robbery and assessed punishment at twelve and fifteen years\u2019\n\nimprisonment and a $1,000 fine for each count. Appellant contends in a single\n\npoint that the trial court reversibly erred by refusing to submit a jury instruction on\n\n\n      1\n       See Tex. R. App. P. 47.4.\n\fthe lesser-included offense of robbery by threat in both cases. We affirm.\n\n                   II. Factual and Procedural Background2\n\n      On a Sunday afternoon in 2008, Appellant and another male entered a\n\nMetroPCS store under the pretext of reactivating a wireless phone. The men\n\nappeared to change their minds and wanted a new phone instead, so the clerk\n\nhad them complete the required start-of-service form. When the clerk walked to\n\nthe back of the store, Appellant followed and pointed a gun at her. While the\n\nother man took the money from the cash register, Appellant ordered the clerk\n\nonto the ground, pressing the gun to the clerk\u2019s head. The clerk called the police\n\nafter the men fled the scene.\n\n      Five days later, Appellant entered a different MetroPCS store under the\n\npretext of purchasing a wireless phone as a gift. Appellant began to complete\n\nthe start-of-service paperwork while the clerk helped Appellant\u2019s accomplice, who\n\nwas pretending to be a customer. Appellant requested a different face plate for\n\nthe new phone, but when the clerk returned with the face plate, Appellant pointed\n\na gun at the clerk and threatened to shoot him if he did not comply. After the men\n\nfled, taking merchandise and money, the clerk called the police.\n\n      Appellant eventually became a suspect in both robberies. A search of\n\nAppellant\u2019s room in his mother\u2019s house produced the clothes that Appellant wore\n\n\n      2\n      Because Appellant does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence to\nsupport his conviction, we set out only so much of the evidence as required to\naddress Appellant\u2019s point.\n\n\n                                        2\n\fin the first robbery, but police never found a gun or ammunition. Appellant was\n\nindicted on two separate charges of aggravated robbery with the use or\n\nexhibition of a deadly weapon, and he was convicted of both charges. 3 See Tex.\n\nPenal Code Ann. \u00a7 29.03(a)(2) (Vernon 2003). The jury assessed punishment at\n\ntwelve and fifteen years\u2019 confinement for the two cases and a $1,000 fine in each\n\ncase, and the trial court sentenced Appellant accordingly. This appeal followed.\n\n                                   III. Discussion\n\n      In his sole point, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by refusing to\n\nsubmit an instruction on the lesser-included offense of robbery by threat in both\n\ncases.    He contends that the complainants\u2019 testimony admitting their lack of\n\nexperience with handguns was evidence that \u2015Appellant could have been guilty\n\nonly of two robbery by threat offenses.\u2016\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n      We use a two-step process to determine whether a jury should be\n\ninstructed on a lesser-included offense. Hall v. State, 225 S.W.3d 524, 528 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2007). First, the requested charge must satisfy the requirements of a\n\nlesser-included offense as defined by article 37.09 of the Texas Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure. Id. \u2015An offense is a lesser included offense if . . . it is established by\n\nproof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission\n\nof the offense charged.\u2016 Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.09 (Vernon 2006).\n\n\n      3\n         The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion to join the two cases.\n\n\n                                           3\n\f      Second, there must be evidence in the record that would permit a rational\n\njury to find that if the defendant is guilty, he is guilty only of the lesser offense.\n\nHall, 225 S.W.3d at 528; Salinas v. State, 163 S.W.3d 734, 741 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2005). To make this determination, we review all evidence presented at trial, but\n\nwe do not consider \u2015the credibility of the evidence and whether it conflicts with\n\nother evidence or is controverted.\u2016 Banda v. State, 890 S.W.2d 42, 60 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1994), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1105 (1995) (citing Marras v. State, 741\n\nS.W.2d 395, 405 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987), overruled on other grounds by Garrett v.\n\nState, 851 S.W.2d 853, 860 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993)); see Bignall v. State, 887\n\nS.W.2d 21, 24 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994). There must be evidence \u2015affirmatively\n\nnegating the element present in the greater offense but absent in the lesser\u2016\n\noffense, and \u2015it is not enough to simply rely on the State\u2019s failure to prove the\n\nparticular element.\u2016 Hanson v. State, 269 S.W.3d 130, 133 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo\n\n2008, no pet.). \u2015In this step of the analysis, anything more than a scintilla of\n\nevidence may be sufficient to entitle a defendant to [an instruction on] a lesser\n\ncharge.\u2016 Hall, 225 S.W.3d at 536. Thus, the issue in this case is \u2015whether any\n\nevidence exists in the record that would permit a rational jury to find that\n\n[Appellant] is guilty only of [robbery by threat].\u2016 Bignall, 887 S.W.2d at 23.\n\nB. Analysis\n\n      The State concedes that robbery by threat is a lesser-included offense of\n\naggravated robbery under the circumstances of this case. Therefore, Appellant\n\nwas entitled to submission of the lesser-included offense if there was affirmative\n\n\n                                          4\n\fevidence in the record establishing that Appellant did not use or exhibit a deadly\n\nweapon. See Hall, 225 S.W.3d at 536.\n\n       To support his contention that evidence existed in the record allowing a\n\njury to conclude he was guilty only of robbery by threat, Appellant points to the\n\ntestimony of the two complainants. On cross-examination, both complainants\n\nadmitted that they lack experience with handguns and were unfamiliar with\n\nvarious models and their weight. Appellant\u2019s counsel intimated though questions\n\ndirected to the complainants that the gun could have been a toy, but each\n\ncomplainant affirmatively testified that they believed Appellant exhibited a real\n\ngun.\n\n       In Wilhoit v. State, the court of criminal appeals held that Wilhoit was not\n\nentitled to an instruction on a lesser-included offense even though the\n\ninvestigating officer testified that the victim told him that she \u2015most likely\u2016 thought\n\nWilhoit brandished a \u2015toy type gun\u2016 when committing aggravated rape. See 638\n\nS.W.2d 489, 499 (Tex. Crim. App. 1982). Specifically, the court held that the\n\nofficer\u2019s concession was \u2015more in the nature of impeachment than direct\n\nsubstantive evidence that [the victim] truly believed the pistol was a toy gun.\u2016 Id.\n\n       The San Antonio Court of Appeals also addressed a similar factual\n\nscenario in Covarrubias v. State, No. 04-96-00921-CR, 1998 WL 204911, at *2\u20133\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio Apr. 28, 1998, pet. ref\u2019d) (not designated for\n\npublication).   There, the court held that Covarrubias was not entitled to an\n\ninstruction on robbery because the fact that he was arrested with a toy gun in his\n\n\n                                          5\n\fwaistband did not negate the use of a deadly weapon in the charged offense. Id.\n\nat *2\u20133; see also In re L.J., No. 04-05-00771-CV, 2006 WL 1895466, at *2 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014San Antonio July 12, 2006, pet. ref\u2019d) (mem. op., not designated for\n\npublication) (holding appellant not entitled to instruction on lesser offense\n\nbecause a witness testified that assailant had a gun, appellant did not testify at\n\ntrial, and no evidence existed in the record to suggest the gun used in the\n\nrobbery was not real); Tijerina v. State, No. 04-01-00526-CR, 2003 WL 183686,\n\nat *1\u20132 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio Jan. 29, 2003, no pet.) (mem. op., not\n\ndesignated for publication) (holding appellant not entitled to lesser-included\n\noffense instruction because two witnesses testified that assailant had a gun,\n\nappellant did not testify at trial, and there was no evidence to suggest the gun\n\nused in the charged offense was not real). While the complainant in Covarrubias\n\nadmitted that she was not familiar with guns, she testified that she thought the\n\ngun was real, and the court concluded there was no evidence disputing that the\n\ngun was a deadly weapon. Covarrubias, 1998 WL 204911, at *3; see Wilhoit,\n\n638 S.W.2d at 499 (holding witness\u2019s concession about possibility that toy gun\n\nused was impeachment evidence rather than direct, substantive evidence that\n\nthe pistol was a toy); Hosea v. State, No. 14-08-00337-CV, 2009 WL 6338617, at\n\n*3 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] Oct. 6, 2009, pet. ref\u2019d) (mem. op., not\n\ndesignated for publication) (stating witness\u2019s acknowledgment on cross-\n\nexamination that the gun could have been a toy only operated as impeachment\n\nevidence concerning the witness\u2019s credibility); Briscoe v. State, No. 14-89-00713-\n\n\n                                        6\n\fCR, 1990 WL 79845, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] June 14, 1990, pet.\n\nref\u2019d) (not designated for publication) (stating that rather than establishing that a\n\nfirearm was not used, the evidence only showed that the witness could not tell if\n\nthe gun was real).\n\n         Here, Appellant has similarly failed to point to evidence affirmatively\n\nnegating the deadly weapon element of aggravated robbery. The complainants\u2019\n\ntestimony that they each lacked experience with handguns is not evidence that\n\nAppellant did not use a firearm in the robberies. See Hosea, 2009 WL 6338617,\n\nat *3 (stating that a witness\u2019s acknowledgment that gun could have been a toy\n\nwas not direct, substantive evidence that a gun was not involved) (citing Wilhoit,\n\n638 S.W.2d at 499). Instead of direct evidence negating the use of a deadly\n\nweapon, the complainants\u2019 testimony merely served as impeachment evidence\n\nconcerning their credibility.   See Wilhoit, 638 S.W.2d at 499.        Indeed, both\n\ncomplainants affirmatively testified that they believed Appellant had used a real\n\ngun during the offense. There is no other evidence in the record suggesting that\n\nthe gun was not real, which is required to establish robbery by threat as a valid,\n\nrational alternative to aggravated robbery. See L.J., 2006 WL 1895466, at *2.\n\nThus, Appellant has failed to show that there is affirmative evidence in the record\n\npermitting a rational jury to find him guilty of robbery by threat and not guilty of\n\naggravated robbery, and we hold that the trial court did not err by refusing to\n\ncharge the jury on robbery by threat. We therefore overrule Appellant\u2019s sole\n\npoint.\n\n\n                                         7\n\f                             IV. Conclusion\n\n      Having overruled Appellant\u2019s sole point, we affirm the trial court\u2019s\n\njudgments.\n\n\n\n                                              ANNE GARDNER\n                                              JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: GARDNER, MEIER, and GABRIEL, JJ.\n\nDO NOT PUBLISH\nTex.
