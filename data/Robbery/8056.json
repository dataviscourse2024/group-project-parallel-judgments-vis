Requester sought copies of court records from the Philadelphia Office\nof Judicial Records (OJR), which denied his request on the basis that the records\nwere not public documents. Requester argues that the OJR\u2019s denial of his RTKL\nrequest violated his constitutional rights under the United States and Pennsylvania\nConstitutions. After review, we affirm the OOR.\n\n                                         I. Background\n\n      On August 19, 2022, Requester sent a RTKL request to the OJR seeking\n\u201ccourt commitment sheets\u201d and \u201ccourt disposition[s]\u201d related to the \u201crobbery\n\n      1\n          Act of February 14, 2008, P.L. 6, 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101-67.3104.\n\farrest[s]\u201d of Rhon Duval Parker (Parker) in 1980 and 1981. Certified Record (C.R.),\nEx. 1. The OJR denied the request on August 26, 2022, stating that the records\nrequested were not public documents. Id. Requester appealed to the OOR, which\ndismissed the appeal, noting that it did not have jurisdiction over appeals from\njudicial agencies such as the OJR, and that judicial records could be requested from\na judicial records custodian pursuant to the public access policies of the Unified\nJudicial System of Pennsylvania (UJS).2 C.R., Ex. 2. This appeal followed.3\n\n                                             II. Issue\n\n       Requester argues that, in denying Requester access to the requested records,\nthe OJR violated his rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the\nUnited States Constitution4 and under article I, sections 1 and 11 of the Pennsylvania\nConstitution.5\n\n                                          III.   Analysis\n\n       Section 102 of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a767.102, defines \u201cJudicial agency\u201d as \u201c[a]\ncourt of the Commonwealth or any other entity or office of the [UJS].\u201d Access to\njudicial agency records under the RTKL is limited to financial records, per Section\n304(a) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.304(a). A judicial agency \u201cis not duty-bound to\n\n\n       2\n             See    Case      Records    Public    Access    Policy     of     the    UJS,\nhttps://www.pacourts.us/Storage/media/pdfs/20211230/165101-publicrecordspolicy2022.pdf\n(last viewed September 7, 2023).\n\n       3\n         This Court\u2019s standard of review of a final determination by the OOR is de novo and our\nscope of review is plenary. Wishnefsky v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 144 A.3d 290, 294 n.7 (Pa. Cmwlth.\n2016).\n\n       4\n           U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV.\n\n       5\n           Pa. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 11.\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fdisclose court records under the RTKL[.]\u201d Faulk v. Phila. Clerk of Cts., 116 A.3d\n1183, 1187-88 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015). While Section 503(a) of the RTKL provides\nthat the OOR \u201cshall designate an appeals officer\u201d for decisions by a Commonwealth\nagency or a local agency,6 under Section 503(b),7 a judicial agency designates its\nown appeals officer. Because judicial agencies have their own appeals officers and\nappeal procedures, the OOR does not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal taken from\nthe determination of a judicial agency. Phila. Dist. Att\u2019y\u2019s Off. v. Stover, 176 A.3d\n1024, 1027 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2017).\n\n       Instantly, Requester\u2019s argument focuses on whether the OJR erred in denying\nhis RTKL request on the basis that the requested records were not public documents.\nThat issue is not before this Court, however, as the OOR dismissed Requester\u2019s\nappeal on jurisdictional grounds. In that regard, the OOR did not err. Requester has\nnot disputed that the OJR is a judicial agency or challenged the OOR\u2019s conclusion\nthat it lacks jurisdiction over decisions made by the OJR under the RTKL.\n\n       Furthermore, Requester did not raise any constitutional issues in his appeal to\nthe OOR. Rather, he argued that the records sought were financial records because\nthe information in a \u201ccourt commitment order\u201d includes the amount of any court-\nordered fines, costs, and restitution.8 Section 1101(a) of the RTKL provides that a\n\n       6\n           65 P.S. \u00a7 67.503(a).\n\n       7\n           65 P.S. \u00a7 67.503(b).\n\n       8\n          Requester appears to have abandoned the argument that he sought financial records,\nwhich are defined in Section 102 of the RTKL as: (1) any account, voucher, or contract concerning\nthe receipt or disbursement of funds by an agency, or the agency\u2019s acquisition, use, or disposal of\nservices, supplies, materials, equipment, or property; (2) the salary or other payments or expenses\npaid to an officer or employee of an agency; or (3) a financial audit report. 65 P.S. \u00a767.102.\nInstead, Requester maintains that he seeks \u201cpublic information\u201d contained in \u201cjudicial records\nand/or judicial documents.\u201d Requester\u2019s Br. at 4-5.\n\n\n                                                3\n\frequester\u2019s appeal \u201cshall state the grounds upon which the requester asserts that the\nrecord is a public record.\u201d 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1101(a). Arguments that are not raised in a\nSection 1101 appeal are waived. Crocco v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Health, 214 A.3d 316, 321\n(Pa. Cmwlth. 2019). Thus, to the extent Requester argues that the OJR violated his\nconstitutional rights, those issues are waived, having been raised before this Court\nfor the first time on appeal.\n\n      Accordingly, as the OOR lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a judicial\nagency decision under the RTKL, we affirm the OOR\u2019s Final Determination that\ndismissed Requester\u2019s RTKL appeal on jurisdictional grounds.\n\n                                         ____________________________\n                                         ELLEN CEISLER, Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\f           IN THE COMMONWEALTH COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n\nKevin Silas,                         :\n                  Petitioner         :\n                                     :\n      v.                             : No. 1145 C.D. 2022\n                                     :\nPhiladelphia Office of Judicial      :\nRecords (Office of Open Records),    :\n                   Respondent        :\n\n\n\n                                    ORDER\n\n      AND NOW, this 8th day of September, 2023, the September 15, 2022 order\nof the Office of Open Records is hereby AFFIRMED.\n\n                                       ____________________________\n                                       ELLEN CEISLER, Judge\n\f",
