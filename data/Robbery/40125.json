Because the indictment states a larceny by the prisoner, and not a stealing from the house or warehouse according to the terms of the statute, and for other reasons apparent on the record.\nPursuant to the act of Congress of July 7, 1838, the motion and the questions of law' were adjourned to the Circuit Court for its decision.\nThe cause coming on to be heard on the transcript of the record of the Criminal Court of the District of Columbia for the county of Washington, on the motion in arrest of judgment and on the questions of law arising on said motion, was argued by counsel. The court decided that the judgment in this cause ought not to be arrested, because the said indictment does not charge a stealing from the house or warehouse, nor for any other reason apparent on the record. That the offence charged in said indictment is sufficiently charged therein, and that the said indictment is good and sufficient in law. Whereupon it is ordered and adjudged by this court, that the motion in arrest of judgment in said cause be, and that the same is hereby overruled, and that the same be certified to the said Criminal Court.\n\n. \u201c That if any person or persons shall, after the end of this session of assembly, break into any shop, storehouse or warehouse, although such shop, storehouse or warehouse, be not contiguous to or with any mansion-house, and steal from thence any goods, to the value of five shillings, and be thereof convict, by confession or verdict of a jury, such offender or offenders, shall suffer death as felons, without benefit of clergy, any law, usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d\n1 Maxcy\u2019s laws Maryland, 190.\n\n",
