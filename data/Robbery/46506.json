            "opinion_text": "\nOPINION OF THE COURT\nCOOK, Judge:\nTried by general court-martial, military judge alone, the accused was convicted, despite his pleas,1 of robbery, in violation of Article 122, Uniform Code of Military Jus*268tice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 922. The approved sentence extends to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement at hard labor for 1 year and a day, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to the grade of E-l. The Court of Military Review affirmed the findings and sentence.\nWe specified the following issue:\nWHETHER THE ARMY COURT OF MILITARY REVIEW ERRED IN AFFIRMING APPELLANT\u2019S APPROVED SENTENCE, WHICH INCLUDED A BAD-CONDUCT DISCHARGE AND CONFINEMENT AT HARD LABOR OF ONE YEAR AND ONE DAY WHEN A CO-ACTOR RECEIVED ONLY A FIELD GRADE ARTICLE 15 FOR THE SAME OFFENSE.\nThe evidence as adduced by the Government showed that the accused, as well as Corkhill, Sinclair, Wright, and the accused\u2019s girlfriend were socializing together in a bar when the conversation turned to robbing a German. After leaving the bar, they encountered the victim who was walking down the street. Sinclair and the accused \u201cbumped\u201d the victim, and Sinclair grabbed him. The accused took the victim\u2019s purse and threw it to Corkhill who ran away. Shortly thereafter the accused was sent after Corkhill to retrieve the purse which was to be returned to the victim for money. After the exchange Sinclair gave the money to the accused who shared it with Corkhill. At trial Corkhill testified that he received punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815, for his involvement in the case. The military judge sustained a government objection that the testimony was \u201creally not a proper subject to be exploring here.\u201d2 The staff judge advocate advised the convening authority that \u201cCork-hill received a field grade Article 15 for his role.\u201d The trial defense counsel also mentioned this fact in his comments on the review. See United States v. Goode, 1 M.J. 3 (C.M.A.1975). However, these comments apparently did not accompany the review provided to the convening authority prior to his action. United States v. Snelling, CM 439406, unpublished (ACMR September 17, 1980). The issue specified was not raised below.\nSentence appropriateness is determined by the sentencing authority at the trial level, the convening authority or supervisory authority, and the Court of Military Review. See paras. 76, 88 and 100, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969 (Revised edition). Generally, sentence appropriateness should be judged by \u201cindividualized consideration\u201d of the particular accused \u201con the basis of the nature and seriousness of the offense and the character of the offender.\u201d United States v. Mamalay, 10 U.S.C.M.A. 102, 106-07, 27 C.M.R. 176, 180-81 (1959).\nSome intermediate courts have recognized an exception to this rule \u201cwhen there are highly disparate sentences in closely related cases.\u201d United States v. Olinger, 12 M.J. 458, 460 (C.M.A.1982), and cases cited therein. However proper it may be for the convening authority and the Courts of Military Review to consider sentence comparison as an aspect of sentence appropriateness, it is only one of many aspects of that consideration. See United States v. Coldiron, 9 M.J. 900 (A.F.C.M.R. 1980), pet. denied, 10 M.J. 249 (1981); United States v. London, 9 M.J. 905 (A.F.C.M.R. 1980).\nWe have recently considered our role in sentence review in United States v. Olinger, supra. There we reiterated our refusal \u201cto evaluate the appropriateness of individual court-martial sentences, particularly in those cases where the court below exercised its unique fact-finding powers under Article 66 . . . and determined the sentence was correct in law and fact.\u201d Id. at 460. However, we also recognized \u201cthat we may properly review a lower court\u2019s \u2018reassessment of sentence ... to prevent obvious miscarriages of justice or abuses of discretion.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 461.\n*269Bearing these precepts in mind, we note that Corkhill, the least-participating party, received \u201ca field-grade Article 15\u201d for his actions. Although not referenced by counsel, we judicially notice that Sinclair, the instigator, received a sentence of a bad-conduct discharge, confinement at hard labor for 30 months, total forfeiture of pay and allowances, and reduction to E-l.3 The principle of sentence comparison would seemingly demand comparison not only to Corkhill\u2019s Article 15 but also to the sentence imposed on Sinclair. In any event, \u201c[wjhile lesser sentences were given here to [a] certain malfeasant[ ], the facts do not demonstrate that appellant\u2019s sentence exceeded \u2018relative uniformity\u2019 \u201d nor did it \u201crise to the level of an obvious miscarriage of justice or an abuse of discretion.\u201d United States v. Olinger, supra at 461.\nThe decision of the United States Army Court of Military Review is affirmed.\nChief Judge EVERETT and Judge FLETCHER concur.\n\n. The accused pleaded guilty to wrongful appropriation of money and certain items taken during the robbery.\n\n\n. The military judge ruled that the \u201ctestimony would be appropriate ... if we ever get to the sentencing phase of this trial.\u201d\n\n\n. Sinclair argued inappropriateness of sentence before the Court of Military Review which reduced his approved sentence to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement at hard labor for 18 months, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. United States v. Sinclair, CM 438544, unpublished (ACMR March 27, 1980). His petition for review was denied. 9 M.J. 205 (1980).\n\n",
