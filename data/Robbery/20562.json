PD-1022-12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMICHAEL COOPER, Appellant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON APPELLANT'S PETITION FOR DISCRETIONARY REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE THIRD COURT OF APPEALS\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAVIS COUNTY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tJohnson, J., delivered the opinion of the Court in which Keller, P.J., and\r\nMeyers,  Cochran, and Alcal\u00e1, JJ., joined.  Keller, P.J., filed a concurring opinion\r\nin which Johnson, J., joined.  Cochran, J., filed a concurring opinion in which\r\nAlcal\u00e1, J., joined.  Price, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which Keasler and\r\nHervey, JJ., joined.  Womack, J., did not participate.\r\n\r\n\r\nO P I N I O N\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAppellant was convicted of five counts of aggravated robbery pursuant to an indictment that\r\nnamed three different complainants, with all counts arising from a single home invasion.  Two\r\ncounts named Andrew Chaney as the complainant, two counts named James Barker as the\r\ncomplainant, and one count named Paul Linden as the complainant.  The jury found him guilty of\r\nall five counts in the single indictment and assessed appellant's punishment at imprisonment for 60\r\nyears on two of the counts, 80 years on two other counts, and 65 years on the remaining count.  The\r\ntrial court sentenced appellant accordingly and ordered all five sentences to be served concurrently. \r\nThe court of appeals affirmed the judgments. Cooper v. State, 373 S.W.3d 821 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n2012).\r\n\r\n\tIn his petition to this Court, appellant raises two grounds, both of which challenge the court\r\nof appeals's holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution was not\r\nviolated when he was convicted of both aggravated robbery by causing bodily injury and aggravated\r\nrobbery by threat to the same victim during a single robbery.  These grounds involve appellant's\r\nconvictions for two separate counts of aggravated robbery of each of two of the named complainants,\r\nAndrew Chaney and James Barker.  He does not challenge his conviction for robbing Linden.\r\n\r\n\tWe granted review.  After reviewing the opinion of the court of appeals, the record, and the\r\nbriefs of the parties, we conclude that appellant's challenged convictions do violate the double-jeopardy clause.  Accordingly, we sustain appellant's grounds for review.  We reverse the judgment\r\nof the court of appeals and remand this cause to that court for further proceedings and appropriate\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelivered:  May 14, 2014\r\n\r\nPublish\r\n\r\n\r\n",
