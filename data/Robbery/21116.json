'   JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT OF\n\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS,                            '   ANGELINA COUNTY, TEXAS\nAPPELLEE\n                             MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                                 PER CURIAM\n       Latricia Monte Ballard appeals her conviction for burglary of a habitation.\nAppellant\u2019s counsel has filed a brief asserting compliance with Anders v. California, 386\nU.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 18 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1967) and Gainous v. State, 436 S.W.2d 137\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1969). We dismiss the appeal.\n\n                                     BACKGROUND\n       Appellant was charged by indictment with the felony offense of burglary of a\nhabitation. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) (Vernon 2003). She pleaded not\nguilty, and a jury trial was held. The jury found her guilty as charged. The trial court\nsentenced Appellant to imprisonment for five years but suspended that sentence and\nplaced her on community supervision with various conditions. This appeal followed.\n\n                   ANALYSIS PURSUANT TO ANDERS V. CALIFORNIA\n       Appellant=s counsel has filed a brief in compliance with Anders and Gainous.\nCounsel states that he has diligently reviewed the appellate record and that he is well\nacquainted with the facts of this case. In compliance with Anders, Gainous, and High v.\nState, 573 S.W.2d 807 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978), counsel=s brief presents a thorough\nchronological summary of the procedural history of the case and further states that\ncounsel is unable to present any arguable issues for appeal. See Anders, 386 U.S. at 745,\n87 S. Ct. at 1400; see also Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S. Ct. 346, 350, 102 L.\n\fEd. 2d 300 (1988). We have likewise reviewed the record for reversible error and have\nfound none.\n                                               CONCLUSION\n         As required, Appellant=s counsel has moved for leave to withdraw. See In re\nSchulman, 252 S.W.3d 403, 407 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (orig. proceeding); Stafford v.\nState, 813 S.W.2d 503, 511 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).              We are in agreement with\nAppellant\u2019s counsel that the appeal is wholly frivolous. Accordingly, his motion for\nleave to withdraw is hereby granted, and we dismiss this appeal. See In re Schulman,\n252 S.W.3d at 408B09 (\u201cAfter the completion of these four steps, the court of appeals\nwill either agree that the appeal is wholly frivolous, grant the attorney=s motion to\nwithdraw, and dismiss the appeal, or it will determine that there may be plausible grounds\nfor appeal.\u201d).\n         Counsel has a duty to, within five days of the date of this opinion, send a copy of\nthe opinion and judgment to Appellant and advise him of his right to file a petition for\ndiscretionary review. See TEX. R. APP. P. 48.4; In re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d at 411 n.35.\nShould Appellant wish to seek further review of this case by the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals, he must either retain an attorney to file a petition for discretionary review or he\nmust file a pro se petition for discretionary review. See In re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d at\n408 n.22. Any petition for discretionary review must be filed within thirty days from the\ndate of either this opinion or the last timely motion for rehearing that was overruled by\nthis court. See TEX. R. APP. P. 68.2. Any petition for discretionary review must be filed\nwith this court, after which it will be forwarded to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\nalong with the rest of the filings in this case. See TEX. R. APP. P. 68.3. Any petition for\ndiscretionary review should comply with the requirements of Rule 68.4 of the Texas\nRules of Appellate Procedure. See TEX. R. APP. P. 68.4; In re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d at\n408 n.22.\nOpinion delivered May 5, 2010.\nPanel consisted of Worthen, C.J., Griffith, J., and Hoyle, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                          (DO NOT PUBLISH)\n\n                                                      2\n\f",
