            "opinion_text": "\nJudgment, Supreme Court, Bronx County (George Covington, J.), rendered June 15, 1988, convicting defendant, after a jury trial, of robbery in the first degree and sentencing him, as a second felony offender, to an indeterminate term of 4 id to 9 years\u2019 imprisonment, unanimously affirmed.\nOn this appeal, defendant argues, among other things, that the lineup identification should have been suppressed as tainted by the complainant\u2019s photographic identification. We disagree. As correctly noted by the trial court in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress after the hearing held pursuant to United States v Wade (388 US 218), there is no evidence that the pretrial identification procedures employed by the police in this case were even remotely suggestive. Moreover, the complainant had an unobstructed view of the defendant for a significant period of time both before and during the robbery, which took place in broad daylight with no other individuals in sight. Accordingly, there was a sufficient independent basis for the witness\u2019s in-court identification of defendant. (See, People v Ramos, 42 NY2d 834.)\nWe perceive no error in the trial court\u2019s Sandoval ruling (People v Sandoval, 34 NY2d 371). Concur\u2014Sullivan, J. P., Carro, Wallach and Rubin, JJ.\n",
