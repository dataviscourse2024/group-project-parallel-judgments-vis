CROFT, JR.,\n     Defendant-Appellant.\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\n      Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Dallas County, Terry R. Rickers,\n\nJudge.\n\n\n\n      Michael Croft Jr. appeals from his conviction for theft in the fourth degree.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n      Mark C. Smith, State Appellate Defender, (until his withdrawal) and Stephan\n\nJ. Japuntich, Assistant Appellate Defender, for appellant.\n\n      Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, and Sharon K. Hall, Assistant Attorney\n\nGeneral, for appellee.\n\n\n\n      Considered by Doyle, P.J., Mullins, J., and Mahan, S.J.*\n\n      *Senior judge assigned by order pursuant to Iowa Code section 602.9206 (2019).\n\f                                            2\n\n\nMAHAN, Senior Judge.\n\n       Michael Croft Jr. appeals from his conviction for theft in the fourth degree,\n\nin violation of Iowa Code sections 714.1(1) and 714.2(4) (2018), contending there\n\nis insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding on the element of identity.1\n\nUpon our review, we affirm.\n\n       From the evidence presented at trial, the jury could have found the\n\nfollowing.   On February 7, 2018, two Scheels loss-prevention officers were\n\nmonitoring the main aisle of Scheels\u2019 first floor in West Des Moines. They spotted\n\nCroft, whom they recognized from photographs in the store\u2019s office as an individual\n\non \u201cbe on the lookout\u201d (BOLO) status.2 The officers had a \u201cclear view\u201d of Croft\u2019s\n\nface as he walked \u201cdirectly past\u201d them, and they followed him until he exited the\n\nstore carrying Scheels merchandise without paying. 3                Upon the officers\u2019\n\nsubsequent review of surveillance footage, they observed Croft picking up the\n\nmerchandise before they had encountered him in the store. Both officers testified\n\nthere was \u201cno question\u201d the individual they observed in Scheels on that date was\n\nCroft, and the officers identified Croft in person for the jury at trial. See State v.\n\nWilliams, 315 N.W.2d 45, 58 (Iowa 1982) (noting the credibility of witnesses and\n\nweight to be given their testimony is in the sole province of jury).\n\n       Although the officers\u2019 testimony presents substantial evidence to support a\n\nfinding of guilt, the jury also heard testimony from a third Scheels loss-prevention\n\n\n1\n  Croft raises an alternative claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which we need not\naddress because counsel unsuccessfully moved for judgment of acquittal on the element\nof identity.\n2\n  BOLO is a status given to subjects who were believed to have stolen from Scheels\npreviously.\n3\n  Pursuant to Scheels\u2019 store policy, the officers were not allowed to approach Croft unless\nthere was an open case against him.\n\f                                           3\n\n\nofficer, who reviewed the surveillance video and recognized Croft from several\n\nprior encounters\u2014one in December 2016 during which Croft attempted to exit the\n\nstore carrying Scheels merchandise without paying, and another in December\n\n2017 when Croft failed in an attempt to return items he had not purchased. The\n\njury also heard from a Target loss-prevention officer, who stopped Croft in the\n\nmidst of a theft from a West Des Moines Target store in May 2017.\n\n          On appeal, Croft acknowledges his identity in Scheels\u2019 BOLO photographs\n\nfrom December 2017.        But he claims, \u201cThe depictions do not prove that the\n\nindividual shown in the December 2017 photographs is the same individual shown\n\nin the February 7, 2018 photographs [taken from the surveillance video].\u201d Croft\u2019s\n\nprimary contention is that his distinctive neck tattoo is not visible in the February 7\n\nphotographs. But Croft overlooks the fact that his attire on February 7 (hooded\n\nsweatshirt, coat, and vest) concealed his neck. Even so, viewing the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to the State, it appears part of Croft\u2019s neck tattoo is visible\n\nin Exhibit 3.\n\n          \u201c[T]he prosecution does not have \u2018an affirmative duty to rule out every\n\nhypothesis except that of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d State v. Bentley, 757\n\nN.W.2d 257, 262 (Iowa 1999) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 326\n\n(1979)). Considering the evidence in the record, including reasonable inferences\n\nthat may be fairly drawn from it, we conclude substantial evidence supports the\n\njury\u2019s verdict in this case. See State v. Albright, ___ N.W.2d ___, ___, 2019 WL\n\n1302384, at *3 (Iowa 2019) (setting forth standard of review). Accordingly, we\n\naffirm.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\f",
