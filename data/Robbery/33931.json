Accordingly, the claim is not preserved for appellate review (People v Balls, 69 NY2d 641), and we decline to review it in the interest of justice. If we were to review it, we would find that the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of the defense as a conspiracy involving the police, the prosecutor, and the People\u2019s witnesses to frame defendant was fair response to defense counsel\u2019s summation suggesting that the police had embellished the description given to them by the complainant and that the identification testimony of the complainant and an eyewitness may have been the product of their discussions with the prosecutor\u2019s office. We perceive no abuse of sentencing discretion. Concur\u2014Murphy, P. J., Rubin, Kupferman, Ross and Tom, JJ.\n",
