The inconsistencies and inaccuracies in question may indicate that the complainant is a person susceptible to suggestion, but were at best tangential to the theft and the complainant\u2019s unwavering identification of defendant as the thief. Complainant\u2019s testimony was all the more credible given the witness\u2019s prior acquaintanceship with defendant and ample opportunity to observe in well-lit conditions. The alibi witness, among other things, did not convincingly explain why defendant, who was just an acquaintance of hers, showed up at her apartment an hour before the theft and then stayed for six hours. Concur\u2014Sullivan, J. P., Rosenberger, Wallach, Ross and Tom, JJ.\n",
