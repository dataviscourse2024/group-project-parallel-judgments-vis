F11-21019-T, F11-21020-T, F11-21021-T, and F11-21022-T\n\n                             MEMORANDUM OPINION\n                         Before Justices FitzGerald, Francis, and Lewis\n                                  Opinion by Justice Francis\n       In these appeals, Elisha Rose Jr. challenges his enhanced punishment, arguing the\n\nevidence was insufficient to prove he was a habitual or repeat offender. We affirm.\n\n       Appellant was charged by four separate indictments with burglary of a habitation, theft of\n\na vehicle, aggravated robbery, and possession of a firearm by a felon, all of which arose out of\n\nthe same criminal transaction.     In each case, the State alleged the same two prior felony\n\nconvictions in the indictment or by written notice.\n\n       Subsequently, the State dropped the deadly weapon allegation from the aggravated\n\nrobbery indictment, reducing the charge to robbery. Appellant then waived his right to a jury\n\ftrial and pleaded guilty to the offenses without a recommendation as to punishment. He also\n\npleaded true to the enhancement allegations.\n\n       Before appellant entered his pleas of guilty and true, the trial court admonished appellant\n\non the range of punishment for each of the offenses without the enhancement allegations, with\n\nproof of one prior conviction, and with proof of both prior convictions. With respect to the\n\nlatter, the trial court admonished appellant that if the State proved both prior convictions in the\n\nburglary, robbery, and weapons cases, his punishment would be enhanced to \u201chabitual offender\n\nstatus which is 25 years to 99 years or life and no fine.\u201d In the theft case, the trial court\n\nadmonished appellant that the two prior felony convictions enhanced the offense to a second-\n\ndegree felony carrying a punishment range of two to twenty years in prison and an optional fine\n\nof $10,000. At the conclusion of the lengthy admonishment, the trial court noted, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot to\n\ntake in but I\u2019m sure your attorney has gone over that pretty thoroughly with you several times, is\n\nthat correct?\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n       The trial court admitted State\u2019s exhibits one and two in each case: (1) appellant\u2019s signed\n\njudicial confession and stipulation of evidence and (2) appellant\u2019s signed, written voluntary plea\n\nof true to the enhancement paragraphs. After accepting appellant\u2019s pleas, the trial court reset the\n\ncase for sentencing until a pre-sentence investigation report and CATS evaluation could be\n\ncompleted.\n\n       Appellant testified at the subsequent sentencing hearing. He acknowledged he had four\n\ncases, \u201cthree of which carried sentences of 25 years to life imprisonment and one [which] is two\n\nto 20 years.\u201d Appellant asked the trial court to consider probating his sentences and sending him\n\nto SAFP for drug treatment. On questioning by the prosecutor, appellant acknowledged he had a\n\n\u201ctheft history\u201d that went back twenty-five years. Specifically, he admitted having eleven or\n\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\ftwelve prior theft cases and three assaults. He also admitted he had been placed on probation\n\nfour times in the past and had been revoked each time. At the conclusion of the evidence and\n\nargument of counsel, the trial court stated the following:\n\n                Mr. Rose, in the first three cases I find you guilty as charged. In the\n       aggravated robbery case I find you guilty of the lesser included offense of\n       robbery. I find the enhancement paragraphs to be true. In all of the cases - - in\n       the theft enhanced case I assess your punishment at 20 years confinement in the\n       Institutional Division, in the other three cases at 25 years confinement in the\n       Institutional Division.\n\nThe trial court asked if there was any legal reason why appellant should not be sentenced at this\n\ntime, and appellant\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d\n\n       Relying on the above paragraph, appellant first argues the trial court made no finding that\n\nthe enhancement allegations were true in the burglary, theft, and weapon cases. He interprets the\n\nabove paragraph to evidence only a finding of true to the enhancement paragraphs in the robbery\n\ncase. We disagree.\n\n       As explained by the State, the above-quoted passage contains the court reporter\u2019s\u201d own\n\nidea\u201d of where to insert punctuation. Without changing a single word but by correcting the\n\npunctuation to eliminate an incomplete phrase, the passage reads: \u201cI find the enhancement\n\nparagraphs true [i]n all of the cases[.]\u201d      We conclude this provides the more reasonable\n\ninterpretation\u2014and one supported by the trial court\u2019s assessment of punishment. We conclude\n\nthis argument is without merit.\n\n       Next, appellant complains the State failed to prove the two prior convictions occurred\n\nsequentially in the theft, weapon, and robbery cases.\n\n       Beginning with the theft under $1,500 case, the indictment alleged two prior thefts,\n\nmaking the instant offense a state jail felony. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 31.03(e)(4)(D)\n\n(West Supp. 2012). To enhance his conviction to a second-degree felony, as was done here, the\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fState was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant \u201chas previously been\n\nfinally convicted of two felonies, and the second previous felony conviction is for an offense that\n\noccurred subsequent to the first previous conviction having become final[.]\u201d TEX. PENAL CODE\n\nANN. \u00a7 12.42(a)(2)) (subsequently amended by Act of May 25, 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., ch. 834, \u00a7\n\n2, 2011 Tex. Sess. Law Serv. 2104 (Vernon 2011)) (now found at TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7\n\n12.425(b) (West Supp. 2012).\n\n       The indictment contained two enhancement paragraphs alleging the following:\n\n              And it is further presented to said Court that prior to the commission of the\n       offense or offenses set out above, the defendant was finally convicted of the\n       felony offense of ASSAULT BODILY INJURY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE\n       ENHANCED, in the 282ND JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT of DALLAS\n       County, Texas, in Cause number F04-71551, on the 23RD day of JUNE, 2006.\n\n              And that prior to the commission of the offense or offenses for which the\n       defendant was convicted as set out above, the defendant was finally convicted of\n       the felony offense of BURGLARY OF A HABITATION in the CRIMINAL\n       DISTRICT COURT NO. 5 of DALLAS County, Texas, in Cause Number F90-\n       00644, on the 14TH of MARCH, 1990[.]\n\n       Thus, the indictment alleged appellant was finally convicted on March 14, 1990 of\n\nburglary of a habitation before he committed and was finally convicted on June 23, 2006 of\n\nassault causing bodily injury/domestic violence enhanced. The indictment further alleged that\n\nboth prior convictions became final before appellant committed the instant offense of theft on\n\nAugust 2, 2011. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion otherwise, these paragraphs alleged sequential,\n\nfinal felony convictions, and appellant\u2019s plea of true constituted sufficient proof to support the\n\nenhancement allegation. Wilson v. State, 671 S.W.2d 524, 526 (Tex.Crim. App. 1984) (\u201c[P]leas\n\nto enhancement allegations are different from pleas at the guilt-innocence phase of trial because\n\na plea of \u2018true\u2019 does constitute evidence and sufficient proof to support the enhancement\n\nallegations.\u201d) (emphasis in original). Appellant\u2019s complaint is without merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f       In the weapon case, the indictment contained one enhancement paragraph alleging a\n\nprevious felony conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle in 1990. On the day of the\n\nhearing, the State dropped the enhancement paragraph and relied on a previously filed notice of\n\nspecial plea of enhancement paragraphs. The notice alleged the June 2006 conviction for felony\n\nassault/domestic violence and the March 1990 felony conviction for burglary of a habitation.\n\nThe notice contained the date of sentence, court, county, cause number, name on conviction, and\n\noffense. Appellant argues the State failed to prove the convictions occurred sequentially because\n\nthe notice did not state the 2006 domestic violence conviction became final before the current\n\nweapon case or that it occurred after the 1990 charge became final.\n\n       In the robbery case, the indictment contained one enhancement paragraph for the March\n\n1990 burglary. On the day of the plea hearing, the State filed a notice of special plea of\n\nenhancement paragraphs alleging the 2006 domestic violence offense.           Again, the notice\n\ncontained the date of sentence, court, county, cause number, name on conviction, and offense.\n\nAppellant argues the State failed to prove the convictions occurred sequentially because the\n\nnotice did not state the 2006 conviction became final before the robbery occurred or that it\n\noccurred after the 1990 burglary became final.\n\n       Texas Penal Code 12.42(d) governs punishment enhancement for habitual felony\n\noffenders. Under section 12.42(d), the chronological sequence of events must be proved as\n\nfollows: (1) the first conviction becomes final; (2) the offense leading to a later conviction is\n\ncommitted; (3) the later conviction becomes final; (4) the offense for which the defendant\n\npresently stands accused is committed. Jordan v. State, 256 S.W.3d 286, 290\u201391 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2008). Thus, the State had the burden of proving sequential felony convictions. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f       Here, however, appellant pleaded \u201ctrue\u201d to the enhancement allegations as contained in\n\nthe indictment and the State\u2019s special notice. A plea of true to enhancement paragraphs relieves\n\nthe State of its burden of proving prior convictions alleged for enhancement and forfeits a\n\ndefendant\u2019s right to challenge the evidentiary sufficiency supporting enhancement even when the\n\nenhancement paragraph contains no allegations as to that statutory requirement. Childs v. State,\n\nNo. 05-09-01225-CR, 2011 WL 285851, *at 4\u20135 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas Jan. 31, 2011, pet. ref\u2019d)\n\n(mem. op., not designated for publication) (concluding defendant forfeited right to contest\n\nevidentiary sufficiency of sequence of convictions by pleading \u201ctrue\u201d to enhancement\n\nparagraphs, \u201cespecially considering trial court\u2019s extensive explanation of enhanced\n\npunishments\u201d); Spivey v.

App.\u2014Austin May 17, 2007, pet. ref\u2019d)\n\n(mem. op., not designated for publication) (concluding that even though enhancement paragraphs\n\nlacked finality allegations, State\u2019s burden to prove finality of convictions relieved when\n\ndefendant pleaded \u201ctrue\u201d and there was no record affirmatively showing contrary); Bonner v.\n\nState, 728 S.W.2d 921, 923 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, no pet.) (concluding\n\ndefendant waived sufficiency challenge to enhancement paragraph as to finality because\n\ndefendant pleaded \u201ctrue\u201d even though finality no alleged).\n\n       The trial court explained in detail the punishment range for each of the offenses. The\n\ntrial court specifically told appellant the two prior felony convictions enhanced his punishment to\n\n\u201chabitual offender status\u201d of twenty-five years to ninety-nine years or life in prison and a fine in\n\nthe robbery and weapon cases. Appellant acknowledged he had been over the information with\n\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fhis attorney several times. Thereafter, appellant pleaded \u201ctrue\u201d to the enhancement allegations;\n\nconsequently, we conclude appellant has forfeited his complaint.\n\n       An exception to the waiver rule exists when \u201cthe record affirmatively reflects\u201d the\n\nenhancement is itself improper. Ex parte Rich, 194 S.W.3d 508, 513\u201314 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2006). Here, appellant does not argue the exception exists, nor could he. As stated previously,\n\nat the time appellant pleaded guilty to robbery and the weapon charge, he also pleaded guilty to\n\ntheft and burglary. The burglary and theft indictments both contained two paragraphs properly\n\nalleging the same two felony convictions\u2014the 2006 domestic violence offense and the 1990\n\nburglary offense. Appellant pleaded \u201ctrue\u201d to these allegations as well. Consequently, the\n\nrecord affirmatively shows the enhancements were proper in all of the cases. We conclude\n\nappellant\u2019s issue is without merit.\n\n       Finally, the judgments in the burglary and robbery convictions contain incorrect\n\nrecitations regarding the enhancement paragraphs. In the burglary case, the judgment reflects\n\ntrue to the plea and finding on the first enhancement paragraph only; it contains \u201cN/A\u201d on the\n\nplea and finding on the second paragraph. In the robbery, the judgment recites \u201cN/A\u201d where\n\npleas and findings on two enhancement paragraphs should be entered.\n\n       The trial court\u2019s pronouncement of sentence is oral, while the judgment, including the\n\nsentence assessed, is merely the written declaration and embodiment of the oral pronouncement.\n\nTEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 42.01, \u00a7 1(West Supp. 2012); Ex parte Madding, 70 S.W.3d\n\n131, 135 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). When the oral pronouncement of sentence and the written\n\njudgment vary, the oral pronouncement controls. Id.\n\n       Here, the record establishes appellant pleaded true to both enhancement allegations and,\n\nas previously addressed, the trial court found both allegations true. Accordingly, we reform the\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\fjudgments in these causes to reflect (1) a plea of \u201ctrue\u201d and a finding of \u201ctrue\u201d to the \u201c2nd\n\nEnhancement/Habitual Paragraph\u201d in the burglary case and (2) pleas of \u201ctrue\u201d and findings of\n\n\u201ctrue\u201d on the 1st and 2nd \u201cEnhancement/Habitual Paragraph.\u201d See Asberry v.
