OPINION\n\n\n     Appeal from the United States District Court\n       for the Western District of Washington\n      Richard A. Jones, District Judge, Presiding\n\n         Argued and Submitted May 3, 2016\n                Seattle, Washington\n\n               Filed November 4, 2016\n\n      Before: Susan P. Graber, Marsha S. Berzon,\n        and Mary H. Murguia, Circuit Judges.\n\n              Opinion by Judge Berzon\n\f2                         MATSON V. UPS\n\n                            SUMMARY*\n\n\n                    Labor Law / Preemption\n\n    The panel reversed the district court\u2019s preemption ruling;\nheld that the district court erred in holding that an employee\u2019s\nstate law gender-based hostile work environmental claim was\npreempted under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations\nAct (LMRA); reinstated the jury verdict from the first trial in\nfavor of the employee; and remanded.\n\n    The panel noted the two-part test used to determine\nwhether a state law claim is preempted under \u00a7 301 of the\nLMRA. At the first step, the court asks \u201cwhether a particular\nright inheres in state law or, instead, is grounded in a\n[collective bargaining agreement (CBA)],\u201d Burnside v. Kiewit\nPac. Corp., 491 F.3d 1053, 1060 (9th Cir. 2007); and\npreemption is warranted at this step only if the claim is\ndirectly founded on rights created by the CBA. At step two,\nthe court asks whether the state law claim can be resolved by\n\u201clooking to\u201d the CBA, in which case the claim is not\npreempted; or whether the claim \u201cinterprets\u201d the CBA, in\nwhich case the claim is preempted.\n\n    The panel held that adjudication of the employee\u2019s hostile\nwork environment claim did not require interpretation of a\nprovision of the CBA, and preemption under \u00a7 301 of the\nLMRA was not warranted. Specifically, the panel rejected\nthe employer\u2019s suggestion that the employee\u2019s claim was\nnothing more than a repackaged \u201ccontractual dispute\u201d over\n\n    *\n      This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has\nbeen prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\f                      MATSON V. UPS                          3\n\nthe assignment of extra work. The panel concluded that the\nclaim was not preempted under the first Burnside factor\nbecause it was not grounded in any right created by the CBA.\nThe panel further held that nothing in the nature of the\nemployee\u2019s hostile work environment claim required\ninterpretation of the CBA. The panel also rejected the\nemployer\u2019s argument that Perugini v. Safeway Stores, Inc.,\n935 F.2d 1083 (9th Cir. 1991), controlled this case.\n\n    The panel held that because the district court\u2019s conclusion\nthat the jury\u2019s damages award was \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d\nrested in part on its erroneous preemption ruling, that\ndetermination was also reversed, and the panel remanded for\nreconsideration of the damages question.\n\n\n                         COUNSEL\n\nDonald H. Mullins (argued) and Jacob D.C. Humphreys,\nBadgley Mullins Turner PLLC, Seattle, Washington, for\nPlaintiff-Appellant.\n\nEric D. Miller (argued), Tobias S. Piering, Javier F. Garcia,\nand Michael T. Reynvaan, Perkins Coie LLP, Seattle,\nWashington, for Defendant-Appellee.\n\f4                     MATSON V. UPS\n\n                         OPINION\n\nBERZON, Circuit Judge:\n\n    We once again address whether a state employment claim\ncan go forward where the employee\u2019s terms and conditions of\nemployment are covered by a collective bargaining\nagreement. See Kobold v. Good Samaritan Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr.,\n832 F.3d 1024 (9th Cir. 2016).\n\n     This case, unlike any of the three appeals consolidated in\nthe recent Kobold opinion, concerns a state equal\nemployment claim alleging a hostile work environment.\nMary Matson brought suit against her employer, United\nParcel Service, Inc. (\u201cUPS\u201d), asserting, among other claims,\na state law gender-based hostile work environment claim. A\njury returned a verdict for Matson on that claim, but her\nvictory was short-lived. The district court granted UPS\u2019s\nmotion for a new trial on the ground that the claim was\npreempted under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations\nAct (\u201cLMRA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a). The jury in the second\ntrial found for UPS. Matson challenges the district court\u2019s\npreemption ruling. We conclude that the district court erred\nin holding Matson\u2019s claim preempted and so reverse.\n\n                              I.\n\n    Mary Matson worked for UPS at its Boeing Field\nInternational hub in Seattle from 2002 to 2010. During most\nof that time Matson was employed as a \u201ccombination\nworker,\u201d meaning that she was responsible both for unloading\nand sorting packages that arrived on airplanes and for\ndelivering them locally. Matson was part of a unit of\nemployees represented by the International Brotherhood of\n\f                      MATSON V. UPS                        5\n\nTeamsters, Local 174 (\u201cTeamsters\u201d). The terms and\nconditions of her employment were governed by a collective\nbargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) between UPS and the\nTeamsters.\n\n    Matson frequently complained during her employment\nthat, because of her gender, she was subject to unfair and\ndemeaning treatment in the workplace. Among other\nexamples of such treatment, she alleged, her supervisors\nroutinely favored male employees when assigning what she\ncalled \u201cextra work\u201d\u2014that is, package deliveries not\npreviously assigned to a particular route. Matson valued such\nadditional work assignments because they enabled her to\n\u201cstay on the clock longer than normal, thereby increasing her\npay.\u201d She filed numerous grievances through her union\nseeking redress for these practices. UPS responded to\nMatson\u2019s grievances several times by agreeing that it would\nconsider the seniority of Matson and other employees when\nassigning work. Occasionally, UPS agreed to compensate\nMatson for thirty minutes to one hour at her overtime rate.\n\n    Unsatisfied with the results of the grievances, Matson in\n2008 filed an employment discrimination and retaliation\ncomplaint with the Washington State Human Rights\nCommission (\u201cWSHRC\u201d), alleging, among other matters, that\nUPS \u201chas a pattern and practice of favoring male employees\nby offering extra work to them.\u201d The commission denied the\ncomplaint. Matson also filed a similar charge with the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission, which adopted the\nfindings of the WSHRC.\n\n   \u201cExtra work\u201d is not a defined term in Matson\u2019s CBA.\nThe term appears just once, in a \u201cSort Addendum\u201d that\napplies only to \u201cSorters, Pre-Loaders, Clerks, Car Washers,\n\f6                          MATSON V. UPS\n\nand all other Inside Employees.\u201d The Sort Addendum does\nnot define \u201cextra work,\u201d but provides that UPS \u201crecognizes\nthat the principles of seniority shall be given prime\nconsideration for extra work.\u201d A separate addendum to the\nCBA provides generally that UPS \u201crecognizes that the\nprinciples of seniority shall be given prime consideration in\nthe every day operation of the business.\u201d\n\n     In February 2010, UPS fired Matson for \u201cproven\ndishonesty,\u201d relying on the results of an investigation into\nwhether Matson had falsified delivery records. Matson\ninitially contested her discharge by filing a grievance in\naccord with the procedures outlined in her CBA.1 A joint\nTeamsters/UPS labor panel affirmed her discharge, so her\ncase was not sent to arbitration.\n\n    Matson then filed suit against UPS in Washington state\ncourt, asserting several state law causes of action: (1) race\nand gender discrimination; (2) a race- and gender-based\nhostile work environment; (3) discrimination and retaliatory\ntermination based on Matson\u2019s opposition to unlawful labor\npractices; and (4) wrongful termination, based on the filing of\na workers\u2019 compensation claim.2 UPS removed the case to\n\n\n\n     1\n       The CBA permitted a terminated employee to file a grievance with\nthe Teamsters appealing her termination. Once an employee filed a\ngrievance, the employee received a hearing before a \u201clabor panel\u201d\ncomposed of an equal number of Teamsters and UPS representatives. The\nlabor panel then voted on whether to affirm the termination or to reinstate\nthe employee. The CBA required that the panel vote be unanimous. If the\npanel did not reach unanimity, the grievance proceeded to arbitration.\n    2\n      Neither Matson\u2019s race-based claims nor her wrongful termination\nclaims are at issue on appeal.\n\f                       MATSON V. UPS                           7\n\nfederal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. See\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.\n\n    UPS then moved for summary judgment. The district\ncourt granted the motion on the merits with respect to\nMatson\u2019s claims for race discrimination, race-based hostile\nwork environment, and wrongful discharge in violation of\npublic policy, but denied summary judgment with respect to\nMatson\u2019s claims of gender discrimination, gender-based\nhostile work environment, and discrimination on the basis of\nopposition to unlawful practices. With regard to Matson\u2019s\ngender-based hostile work environment claim, UPS\nmaintained that the claim was preempted under LMRA \u00a7 301\nbecause it was \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with an\ninterpretation of the CBA, but the district court rejected that\ncontention. \u201c[N]o interpretation would be necessary for\npurposes of Ms. Matson\u2019s gender-based hostile work\nenvironment claim, and plaintiff does not dispute the meaning\nof any of its terms,\u201d the district court concluded.\n\n    The case proceeded to trial. At trial, Matson testified that,\nin her view, what she termed \u201cextra work\u201d should have been\nassigned to her but was, instead, performed by male\nemployees with less seniority. She testified that she would be\n\u201chumiliated in front of [her] coworkers\u201d and treated as \u201csome\nkind of troublemaker just because [she was] asking for extra\nwork.\u201d\n\n    In addition to her allegations regarding work assignments,\nMatson testified to numerous other incidents that, she\ncontended, contributed to a hostile work environment\nincluding:\n\f8                     MATSON V. UPS\n\n    ! A supervisor and other employees refused to help her\n      lift a 150-pound package, and laughed at her as she\n      struggled to do it alone. During that incident, one\n      supervisor acted in an intimidating manner, as he\n      \u201cclenched up his fists, put them behind his back, and\n      stepped right into [Matson\u2019s] face, gritted his teeth.\u201d\n      Matson was forced to seek out another coworker to\n      help her lift the package. Matson\u2019s effort to lift the\n      package resulted in a serious back injury that caused\n      her to miss more than a year of work.\n\n    ! Various UPS managers disregarded her complaints of\n      workplace hostility and threatened to file charges\n      against her if she continued to make what they called\n      \u201cfalse statements.\u201d\n\n    ! A male coworker screamed at her and \u201cbegan to\n      choke [her]\u201d after she had playfully tapped his knee.\n      In response to this incident her supervisors did\n      nothing.\n\n    ! Matson\u2019s supervisors assigned her a less desirable\n      package car rather than a van. All of the male\n      employees, many of whom had less seniority than\n      Matson, were given vans.\n\n    ! In the meeting in which she was terminated, she was\n      confronted by seven men, all of whom were \u201cvery\n      hostile.\u201d Matson was accused of both lying and\n      stealing time, while a man involved in the same\n      activity was not charged with stealing time.\n\n   At the close of Matson\u2019s case-in-chief, UPS moved for\njudgment as a matter of law, arguing once more that Matson\u2019s\n\f                      MATSON V. UPS                          9\n\nhostile work environment claim was preempted under \u00a7 301.\nThe court determined that ruling on the motion before hearing\nthe defense witnesses would be premature.\n\n    UPS then presented witnesses who disputed Matson\u2019s\nclaim that the additional package deliveries constituted extra\nwork. One UPS employee stated that such deliveries were\n\u201creally what I called part of normal dispatch.\u201d\n\n    After hearing UPS\u2019s witnesses, the district court denied\nUPS\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. It explained\nthat \u201cpreemption is not mandated simply because defendant\nrefers to the CBA in mounting its defense.\u201d The court\nspecifically noted that Matson had presented evidence \u201cthat\nwork was given to men instead of her.\u201d That fact, along with\nthe other incidents of hostility she described, \u201cin theory,\nsupport a hostile work environment claim without reference\nto the CBA.\u201d Finally, the court noted that for the purposes of\nMatson\u2019s claim, \u201cextra work, seniority, and prime\nconsideration are simply a reference point that elucidates her\nclaims. Whether or not seniority was actually given prime\nconsideration is not necessary for determination of these\nclaims.\u201d\n\n    Matson next offered rebuttal testimony in which she\ndisagreed with UPS\u2019s evidence regarding the disputed work\nassignments. She maintained that certain package deliveries\nwere work that should have been awarded in \u201cseniority\norder,\u201d and that other such work was improperly dispatched\nby a male hourly employee rather than by a supervisor.\nWhen asked on cross-examination whether she had ever filed\ngrievances against higher-seniority employees, Matson stated\nthat \u201cthis is a very muddy area, because . . . in the contract,\nthere\u2019s a lot of work that\u2019s considered full-time work and\n\f10                        MATSON V. UPS\n\npart-time work. And there\u2019s a lot of different categories. . . .\nAnd all that people are trying to do is separate whose job is\nwhose so that you know whether or not you can bid on it.\nAnd that\u2019s considered extra work.\u201d\n\n    The jury found for UPS on Matson\u2019s discrimination and\nretaliation claims. The jury returned a verdict for Matson,\nhowever, on her hostile work environment claim and awarded\n$500,000 in damages for emotional distress. The district\ncourt\u2019s jury instruction regarding Matson\u2019s hostile work\nenvironment claim did not use the term \u201cextra work\u201d or\n\u201cseniority\u201d or refer to the CBA; it simply stated the elements\nof the claim that Matson had the burden of proving.3\n\n\n     3\n     The court instructed the jury on Matson\u2019s hostile work environment\nclaim as follows:\n\n         To establish her claim of hostile work environment on\n         the basis of gender, Ms. Matson has the burden of\n         proving each of the following propositions: (1) That\n         there was conduct that occurred because of Ms.\n         Matson\u2019s gender; (2) That this conduct was unwelcome\n         in the sense that Ms. Matson regarded the conduct as\n         undesirable and offensive, and did not solicit or incite\n         it; (3) That this conduct was so offensive or pervasive\n         that it altered the conditions of Ms. Matson\u2019s\n         employment; and (4) That management knew, through\n         complaints or other circumstances, of this conduct, and\n         UPS failed to take reasonably prompt and adequate\n         corrective action reasonably designed to end it.\n\n         If you find from your consideration of all of the\n         evidence that each of these propositions has been\n         proved, then your verdict should be for Ms. Matson on\n         this claim. On the other hand, if any of these\n         propositions has not been proved, your verdict should\n         be for UPS on this claim.\n\f                          MATSON V. UPS                               11\n\n    Following the verdict, UPS filed a renewed motion for\njudgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 50(b), or, alternatively, for a partial new trial under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 59, again arguing \u00a7 301\npreemption of the hostile work environment claim. This\ntime, the court granted the motion.\n\n    In so ruling, the district court concluded that Matson\u2019s\nrebuttal testimony acknowledged that the definition of \u201cextra\nwork\u201d was \u201ca very muddy area\u201d and so \u201cput the interpretation\nof extra work under the CBA directly in dispute.\u201d The court\nwent on to hold that Matson\u2019s hostile work environment\nclaim \u201cwith respect to \u2018extra work\u2019 assignments is\nsubstantially dependent on analysis of the CBA because the\ncourt would have to interpret the meaning of \u2018extra work.\u2019\u201d\nThe court ordered a new trial, holding that jury questions\nremained regarding whether Matson had suffered a hostile\nwork environment on the basis of incidents she had described\nthat were unrelated to the assignment of \u201cextra work.\u201d The\ncourt further held that, in light of its preemption ruling, the\njury\u2019s award of $500,000 was \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d and,\n\u201c[a]ccordingly, the question of damages must be tried again\nas well.\u201d\n\n   After the second trial, the jury returned a verdict for UPS.\nThis appeal followed.4\n\n\n\nJury Instructions at 15, Matson v. UPS, No. 2:10-cv-01528 (W.D. Wash.\nJuly 18, 2012).\n    4\n      Matson makes several claims on appeal regarding various district\ncourt rulings during the second trial. Because we reverse the initial\npreemption ruling and hold that the first jury verdict must be reinstated,\nwe need not and do not consider those claims.\n\f12                    MATSON V. UPS\n\n                              II.\n\n      Section 301 provides that \u201c[s]uits for violation of\ncontracts between an employer and a labor organization\nrepresenting employees in an industry affecting commerce\n. . . may be brought in any district court of the United States\nhaving jurisdiction of the parties.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a). The\nSupreme Court has long construed this provision \u201cas a\ncongressional mandate to the federal courts to fashion a body\nof federal common law to be used to address disputes arising\nout of labor contracts.\u201d Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck,\n471 U.S. 202, 209 (1985) (citing Textile Workers Union of\nAm. v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U.S. 448, 456\u201357 (1957)).\nThis federal common law, in turn, \u201cpreempts the use of state\ncontract law in CBA interpretation and enforcement.\u201d\nCramer v. Consol. Freightways, Inc., 255 F.3d 683, 689 (9th\nCir. 2001) (en banc) (citing Local 174, Teamsters of Am. v.\nLucas Flour Co., 369 U.S. 95, 103\u201304 (1962)). Preemption\nunder \u00a7 301 is not limited to \u201ccases specifically alleging\ncontract violation,\u201d id. (citing Lueck, 471 U.S. at 220), but\nalso applies \u201cwhen resolution of a state-law claim is\nsubstantially dependent upon analysis of the terms of an\nagreement made between the parties in a labor contract,\u201d\nLueck, 471 U.S. at 220.\n\n    We have fashioned a two-part test to determine whether\na state law claim is preempted under \u00a7 301. At the first step,\nwe ask \u201cwhether a particular right inheres in state law or,\ninstead, is grounded in a CBA.\u201d Burnside v. Kiewit Pac.\nCorp., 491 F.3d 1053, 1060 (9th Cir. 2007). In making this\ndetermination we focus on \u201cthe legal character of a claim, as\n\u2018independent\u2019 of rights under the collective-bargaining\nagreement, . . . and not whether a grievance arising from\n\u2018precisely the same set of facts\u2019 could be pursued.\u201d Livadas\n\f                       MATSON V. UPS                           13\n\nv. Bradshaw, 512 U.S. 107, 123\u201324 (1994) (citation omitted)\n(quoting Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U.S.\n399, 410 (1988)). Only if the claim is \u201cfounded directly on\nrights created by collective-bargaining agreements\u201d is\npreemption warranted at this step. Caterpillar Inc. v.\nWilliams, 482 U.S. 386, 394 (1987).\n\n    At step two, \u201cto determine whether a state law right is\n\u2018substantially dependent\u2019 on the terms of a CBA,\u201d we ask\n\u201cwhether the claim can be resolved by \u2018look[ing] to\u2019 versus\ninterpreting the CBA.\u201d Burnside, 491 F.3d at 1060\n(alterations in original) (quoting Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 394;\nLivadas, 512 U.S. at 125). \u201cIf the latter, the claim is\npreempted; if the former, it is not.\u201d Id. \u201cWe have stressed\nthat . . . the term \u2018interpret\u2019 is defined narrowly [in this\ncontext]\u2014it means something more than \u2018consider,\u2019 \u2018refer\nto,\u2019 or \u2018apply.\u2019\u201d Balcorta v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film\nCorp., 208 F.3d 1102, 1108 (9th Cir. 2000). Merely \u201calleging\na hypothetical connection between the claim and the terms of\nthe CBA is not enough to preempt the claim,\u201d nor is \u201c[a]\ncreative linkage between the subject matter of the claim and\nthe wording of a CBA provision.\u201d Cramer, 255 F.3d at\n691\u201392. Moreover, preemption is warranted only where \u201cthe\nneed to interpret the CBA . . . inhere[s] in the nature of the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim. If the claim is . . . based on state law, \u00a7 301\npreemption is not mandated simply because the defendant\nrefers to the CBA in mounting a defense.\u201d Id. at 691.\n\n    As we recently observed, the \u201cBurnside factors reflect\ntwo driving concerns of preemption doctrine.\u201d Kobold,\n832 F.3d at 1033. Mandating preemption when a purported\nstate law claim is founded on a right grounded in a CBA\nprevents \u201cparties\u2019 efforts to renege on their [CBA] arbitration\npromises by \u2018relabeling\u2019 as tort suits actions simply alleging\n\f14                      MATSON V. UPS\n\nbreaches of duties assumed in collective-bargaining\nagreements.\u201d Livadas, 512 U.S. at 123 (quoting Lueck,\n471 U.S. at 211). By contrast, requiring preemption when a\nstate law claim requires interpretation of a CBA serves a\nseparate interest: preserving \u201ca central tenet of federal labor-\ncontract law . . . that it is the arbitrator, not the court, who has\nthe responsibility to interpret the labor contract in the first\ninstance.\u201d Lueck, 471 U.S. at 220. Put differently, because\nof the pivotal role that an arbitrator plays in interpreting and\nadministering CBAs, a court \u201ccan determine questions of\nstate law involving labor-management relations only if such\nquestions do not require construing collective-bargaining\nagreements.\u201d Lingle, 486 U.S. at 411.\n\n    Because the second step of the Burnside test is centrally\nconcerned with safeguarding the role of the contractual\ngrievance/arbitration system, \u201cthere is no basis for scuttling\nthe state law cause of action if any necessary CBA\ninterpretation can in some fashion be conducted via the\nappropriate grievance/arbitration forum.\u201d Kobold, 832 F.3d\nat 1033. As we explained in Kobold, \u201c[t]o allow such\nscuttling disadvantages employees covered by CBAs, as they\nlose state law protections because of an embedded CBA\nissue possibly peripheral to their core cause of action.\nThe interest in sending substantial CBA issues through\ngrievance/arbitration does not justify creating this\ndisadvantage unless the interest cannot be otherwise\naccommodated.\u201d Id.\n\n    Against this doctrinal backdrop we turn to the present\ncase.\n\f                      MATSON V. UPS                         15\n\n                             III.\n\n    The thrust of UPS\u2019s argument for preemption is that\nbecause Matson\u2019s hostile work environment claim focused in\npart on her allegation that UPS improperly gave \u201cextra work\u201d\nassignments to male employees with less seniority, that claim\ncannot be resolved without interpreting the term \u201cextra\nwork,\u201d as used in the CBA, to determine whether Matson was\nin fact entitled to the work she claimed. More specifically,\nUPS maintains that \u201cto prove that particular work was\nimproperly assigned because of her gender, Matson first had\nto establish that she, as opposed to other employees, was\nentitled to the work under the CBA.\u201d UPS\u2019s premise is\nwrong, for several reasons.\n\n    As an initial matter, we reject UPS\u2019s suggestion that\nMatson\u2019s claim is nothing more than a repackaged\n\u201ccontractual dispute\u201d over the assignment of extra work. This\nassertion mischaracterizes her claim. Matson\u2019s claim\nincluded the allegation that UPS systematically assigned men\nwork to which they were not entitled by seniority, but only as\none element of a pervasively hostile work environment. The\nhostile environment, Matson maintained, was also\ncharacterized by intimidation and derision having nothing to\ndo with work assignments. Matson\u2019s right not to work in a\ngender-based hostile work environment is a \u201cnonnegotiable\nstate-law right[] . . . independent of any right established by\ncontract.\u201d Lueck, 471 U.S. at 213. The claim, therefore, is\nnot preempted under the first Burnside factor, as it is not\ngrounded in any right created by the CBA.\n\n   Nor does anything \u201cin the nature of\u201d Matson\u2019s hostile\nwork environment claim require interpretation of the CBA.\nCramer, 255 F.3d at 691. As the district court instructed,\n\f16                    MATSON V. UPS\n\n\u201c[t]o find for plaintiff, the jury had to find that \u2018there was\nconduct that occurred because of Ms. Matson\u2019s gender\u2019; \u2018this\nconduct was unwelcome in the sense that Ms. Matson\nregarded the conduct as undesirable and offensive, and did\nnot solicit or incite it\u2019; \u2018this conduct was so offensive or\npervasive that it altered the conditions of Ms. Matson\u2019s\nemployment\u2019; and \u2018management knew . . . of this conduct,\nand UPS failed to take reasonably prompt and adequate\ncorrective action reasonably designed to end it.\u2019\u201d As these\nelements illustrate, the focus of inquiry in a hostile work\nenvironment case is properly on the actual workplace\ntreatment of the plaintiff and the actual practice of the\nmanagement in responding\u2014or contributing\u2014to that\ntreatment. UPS\u2019s alleged discrimination in assigning extra\nwork was just one of several factors that Matson contends\ncontributed to a hostile work environment. The multi-factor,\nfact-based inquiry required to decide Matson\u2019s hostile\nenvironment claim could be conducted without interpreting\nany provision of the CBA.\n\n    Even were we to grant that Matson\u2019s hostile environment\nclaim rested on the allegedly discriminatory assignment of\ncertain work assignments to men, and, further, that whether\nthe CBA gave Matson a seniority-based right to that work\nrequires interpretation of the CBA, Matson\u2019s hostile work\nenvironment claim still would not require interpretation of\nany contractual provision.\n\n    We note, first, that the only CBA provision that uses the\nterm \u201cextra work\u201d applies to \u201c[i]nside employees,\u201d and so\ndoes not apply to the deliveries here in dispute. In using the\nterm \u201cextra work,\u201d with regard to outside deliveries, Matson\nwas not relying on that provision. Instead, she was more\n\f                          MATSON V. UPS                               17\n\ncolloquially referring to sporadic work not covered by pre-set\nassignments.\n\n    Matson could have a viable hostile environment claim\nwhether or not the CBA actually requires assignment of that\nwork based on seniority. Contrary to UPS\u2019s assumption,\nnothing in Matson\u2019s argument depends on her having been\ncontractually entitled to the disputed work. Even if she did\nnot have a right to the work under the CBA, management\u2019s\nsystematic favoring of men in assigning the disputed work\ncould contribute to a hostile work environment. The correct\ninterpretation of the CBA, in other words, is purely peripheral\nto the relevant question with respect to assigning work. That\nquestion was whether UPS showed systematic favoritism\ntoward men in making its work assignments, thereby\ncontributing to a hostile work environment for Matson and\nother women.\n\n     Put differently, Matson\u2019s contention is not that UPS\ncreated a hostile work environment by violating her\ncontractual seniority rights. Rather, her position is that\nfailing to assign her the work despite her seniority is evidence\nof UPS\u2019s hostility toward her because of her gender.\nMatson\u2019s central contention was that she should have been\nawarded the disputed work on any of the usual rationales for\nwork assignment\u2014seniority, proximity to the location where\nthe work was to begin, or temporal availability\u2014and that all\nthose usual criteria were disregarded.5 As UPS did not assign\nthe work on the basis of any of those criteria, Matson\n\n\n    5\n     For example, one of Matson\u2019s female coworkers testified that both\nshe and Matson were denied work assignments even though they were\nimmediately available and even though they had greater seniority than the\nmale employees who received the assignments.\n\f18                    MATSON V. UPS\n\nmaintained, hostility toward her because of her sex is the\nlikely explanation for the failure to assign her the work.\n\n    Additionally, to the extent UPS chose to emphasize its\ninterpretation of the CBA to dispute Matson\u2019s right to the\nwork as part of its defense, that defense does not undermine\nMatson\u2019s reliance on the assignment of the disputed work as\npart of her hostile work environment claim. For one thing,\n\u201c\u00a7 301 preemption is not mandated simply because the\ndefendant refers to the CBA in mounting a defense.\u201d\nCramer, 255 F.3d at 691. For another, UPS does not put\nforward any interpretation of the CBA under which it was\nrequired to award the work as it did. At best, the company\u2019s\ncontention is that nothing in the CBA required that the work\nbe awarded to Matson. Whether that is so or not does not\ndetract from Matson\u2019s statutory gender-based hostile work\nenvironment claim. An employer who is free to make job\nassignments as it chooses can still violate the state law\nproscription on creating a gender-based hostile work\nenvironment by, among other things, favoring men over\nwomen when assigning work.\n\n    Further, even if any interpretation of the CBA had been\nrequired, the relevant interpretive issues were addressed in\nformal settlements after invocation of the grievance\nprocedure. For example, following one of Matson\u2019s\ngrievances, the parties reached a settlement according to\nwhich UPS agreed that \u201c[t]he Company will recognize that\nthe principles of seniority be given prime consideration in the\nassigning of extra work to unassigned geographic delivery\nareas of the combination air delivery drivers dispatched out\nof the [Boeing Field International] facility.\u201d The record\nincludes fifteen other grievances filed by Matson. Of these,\nseven were ultimately withdrawn. Three were resolved when\n\f                       MATSON V. UPS                         19\n\nUPS agreed to compensate Matson for lost work. One was\nsettled when UPS agreed to \u201cuse by seniority Monday\nthrough Friday air drivers for the Saturday air shuttles when\nneeded.\u201d Four were settled when UPS agreed to \u201cabide by\u201d\nor \u201cconsider\u201d Matson\u2019s seniority in the \u201cday to day\ndispatching of [early morning] routes.\u201d\n\n    One could view these agreements as agreed-upon CBA\ninterpretations on the very issue that UPS contends remains\ndisputed: that work Matson complained about was supposed\nto be assigned in accord with seniority principles. Or one\ncould view them as independent labor-management\nagreements, which would also be covered by \u00a7 301 of the\nLMRA. See Retail Clerks Int\u2019l. Ass\u2019n, Local Union Nos. 128\n& 633 v. Lion Dry Goods, Inc., 369 U.S. 17, 28 (1962).\nEither way, the clarity of the agreements means that no\nfurther interpretation was required; the grievance settlements\nneed only be looked to or applied. See Burnside, 491 F.3d at\n1060; Balcorta, 208 F.3d at 1108. Finally, the grievance\nsettlements were, at the very least, evidence that seniority was\nas a practical matter a factor usually used in making work\nassignments in the workplace.\n\n    However the settlements are viewed, the jury was not\nasked to interpret the CBA differently from the\nrepresentations UPS made when settling Matson\u2019s\ngrievances, and nothing in the elements of the hostile work\nenvironment claim required it to do so. As we recognized in\nKobold, \u201cthere is no basis for scuttling the state law cause of\naction if any necessary CBA interpretation can . . . be\nconducted via the appropriate grievance/arbitration forum.\u201d\n832 F.3d at 1033. Here, use of that forum resulted in\nresolutions consistent with Matson\u2019s partial reliance on work\n\f20                     MATSON V. UPS\n\nassignment patterns to support her hostile work environment\nclaim.\n\n    Finally, contrary to UPS\u2019s argument, Perugini v. Safeway\nStores, Inc., 935 F.2d 1083 (9th Cir. 1991) does not control\nthe result here. In Perugini, the plaintiff charged her\nemployer with intentional infliction of emotional distress\n(\u201cIIED\u201d) in part based on its refusal to assign her to light duty\nwhile she was pregnant. To establish her IIED claim,\nPerugini had to show that Safeway\u2019s conduct was \u201cextreme\nand outrageous.\u201d Id. at 1087. This court concluded that, \u201cif\nSafeway\u2019s managerial freedom is not constrained in any\nmaterial way by the CBA, a rational jury could not find that\nSafeway\u2019s conduct in discharging Perugini from heavy work\ninstead of reassigning her to light work\u201d met this standard.\nId. at 1088. Therefore, the court concluded, it was required\nto \u201clook to the CBA to judge the appropriateness of\nSafeway\u2019s behavior in regard to this allegation.\u201d Id.\n\n    By contrast, here, even if UPS\u2019s \u201cmanagerial freedom is\nnot constrained in any material way by the CBA\u201d\u2014i.e., if\nMatson had no contractual right to the disputed work\nassignments\u2014for the company consistently to assign the\nwork to men rather than to equally eligible, or more eligible,\nwomen was evidence of a gender-based hostile environment.\nMatson\u2019s gender-based hostile work environment claim was\nthus viable even if UPS had complete \u201cmanagerial freedom\u201d\nover the assignment of the disputed work under the CBA.\n\n   Notably, the IIED preemption analysis in Perugini did not\nconcern a sex discrimination or hostile work environment\n\f                          MATSON V. UPS                              21\n\nclaim.6 If it had, then the existence of employer discretion\nunder the CBA would not have been dispositive, or even\npertinent; discriminatory exercise of that discretion would\nstill be actionable.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n    For all these reasons, the \u201cadjudication of [Matson\u2019s]\nclaim [does not] require interpretation of a provision of the\nCBA,\u201d and \u00a7 301 preemption is not warranted. Cramer,\n255 F.3d at 691\u201392.\n\n    Kobold noted that \u201calthough \u00a7 301 preemption questions\narise fairly frequently, \u2018[f]amiliarity . . . has not bred\nfacility.\u2019\u201d 832 F.3d at 1032 (alterations in original) (quoting\nCramer, 255 F.3d at 689). This case illustrates the pitfalls of\nexpanding the preemptive effect of the federal common law\ngoverning the interpretation of collective bargaining\nagreements to limit the enforcement of state law employment\ndiscrimination protections. Litigation concerning such\nprotections ordinarily focuses on adverse workplace\nincidents, probing into whether discriminatory motives\nunderlay those incidents. As the focus is not only on what\nhappened but why it happened, resolving such litigation will\nrarely rest on rights created by CBAs or require interpreting\nCBAs in the sense required for \u00a7 301 preemption.\n\n\n\n\n    6\n      Perugini did allege emotional distress caused by \u201con-the-job\nharassment\u201d based on her sex, as well as the refusal to assign her light\nwork. Perugini, 935 F.2d at 1088. We held that the emotional distress\nclaims premised on her employer\u2019s alleged sex-based harassment were not\npreempted. Id. at 1088\u201389.\n\f22                     MATSON V. UPS\n\n    In this instance, however \u201cmuddy\u201d the CBA was\nconcerning the assignment of the disputed work, the\nquestions for the jury\u2014to the extent it considered the\nassignment issue at all\u2014were not whether the disputed\nassignments were \u201cextra work\u201d as the term is used in the\nCBA, or whether the CBA required that they be awarded by\nseniority. Rather, the jury\u2019s focus was directed to whether the\nassignments were discriminatory in that men were\nsystematically favored over similarly situated women.\nMaking that determination did not require the jury to decide\nwhat any provision of the CBA requires. And the jury had\nthe resolutions of Matson\u2019s grievances as evidence that, in\nfact, seniority was usually or often considered.\n\n    We therefore reverse the decision of the district court that\nMatson\u2019s claims were preempted to the extent they relied on\nher allegations regarding UPS\u2019s extra work assignments, and\nwe reinstate the jury verdict from the first trial. Because the\ndistrict court\u2019s conclusion that the jury\u2019s damages award was\n\u201cgrossly excessive\u201d rested in part on its erroneous preemption\nruling, we reverse that determination as well, and remand for\nreconsideration of the damages question.\n\n     REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\f",
