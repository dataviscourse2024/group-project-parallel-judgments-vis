Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30 (1968).\n\n        The question here is whether that doctrine can be stretched to cover a warrantless search\n\n        of a bag recently possessed by a person who was\u2014by the time the bag was opened\u2014\n\n        handcuffed and face-down on the ground. At least on these facts, the answer is no.\n\n                                                      I.\n\n               Because this appeal arises from the denial of a motion to suppress, we view the facts\n\n        in the light most favorable to the government. United States v. Black, 707 F.3d 531, 534\n\n        (4th Cir. 2013). Although we review the district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of historical fact for clear\n\n        error,\u201d \u201c[w]e review de novo the ultimate legal conclusion of whether reasonable suspicion\n\n        existed to justify police action.\u201d United States v. McCoy, 513 F.3d 405, 410 (4th Cir. 2008).\n\n                                                      II.\n\n                                                      A.\n\n               At 11:18 p.m. on September 22, 2019, two officers in a patrol car approached\n\n        Anthony Buster as he walked along Fairfield Avenue in Richmond, Virginia. About 30\n\n        minutes earlier, the officers had responded to a report of \u201ca domestic assault where a\n\n        firearm discharged in the air\u201d and had been looking for the assailant ever since. JA 40. The\n\n        officers approached Buster for two reasons: they believed he matched witness descriptions\n\n        of the assailant and that he was the person they had seen outside the victim\u2019s apartment\n\n        earlier that evening.\n\n\n                                                      2\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46          Filed: 02/22/2022     Pg: 3 of 28\n\n\n\n\n               After getting out of the patrol car, one officer said \u201cYo! Let me talk to you real\n\n        quick\u201d and motioned for Buster to come over. JA 233. Buster said \u201cNah,\u201d and continued\n\n        walking. JA 233. The same officer said \u201cYo! Hey!\u201d and continued toward Buster. JA 234.\n\n        At that point, Buster took off running but tripped and fell almost immediately.\n\n               The officers caught up with Buster while he was still on the ground and tackled him.\n\n        Buster was wearing \u201ca single-strap bag that goes across your body\u201d whose pouch had\n\n        \u201cended up in front of \u201d Buster when he fell. JA 56\u201357. Perceiving that Buster was clutching\n\n        or reaching for the bag, the officers pulled Buster\u2019s arm away from the bag, pulled the bag\n\n        to the rear of Buster\u2019s body, and handcuffed him. Buster said the bag\u2019s strap was choking\n\n        him, so one of the officers cut the strap, grabbed the bag, and removed it from Buster\u2019s\n\n        person. The bag felt \u201c[h]ard to the touch,\u201d which in the officer\u2019s \u201cexperience . . . indicates\n\n        . . . a weapon.\u201d JA 136. The officer opened the bag and found a gun and a box of\n\n        ammunition.\n\n               The officers also peppered Buster with questions without giving him the familiar\n\n        Miranda warnings. After discovering additional ammunition in Buster\u2019s pants pocket, an\n\n        officer asked if Buster had anything else on his person. Buster responded that the only\n\n        items he had were \u201cthat gun and my knife.\u201d U.S. Ex. 1B at 11:24:40\u201345 p.m. The officers\n\n        took Buster to the police station, where they asked more questions. Eventually, an officer\n\n        realized \u201che had neglected to read Buster his Miranda rights\u201d and left the room. JA 234.\n\n        About ten minutes later, the officer came back, gave Buster the Miranda warnings, and\n\n        elicited \u201c\u2018essentially\u2019 the same material discussed in the pre-Miranda interview.\u201d JA 235.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      3\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46         Filed: 02/22/2022      Pg: 4 of 28\n\n\n\n\n                                                     B.\n\n               Buster was charged with one count of possessing a firearm after having been\n\n        convicted of a felony. Soon after, he filed a motion to suppress the firearm, the ammunition,\n\n        and his various statements as having been obtained in violation of the Fourth and Fifth\n\n        Amendments. The district court held a hearing where the officers testified and video from\n\n        their body-worn cameras was admitted into evidence.\n\n               The district court granted Buster\u2019s motion in part and denied it in part. By then, the\n\n        government had agreed it would not seek to use many of the pre-Miranda statements,\n\n        rendering moot Buster\u2019s request to suppress them. The court granted Buster\u2019s request to\n\n        suppress his post-Miranda statements, concluding they were \u201cthe product of an\n\n        impermissible two-step interview tactic\u201d and thus barred by Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S.\n\n        600 (2004), and United States v. Mashburn, 406 F.3d 303 (4th Cir. 2005). JA 243.\n\n               The district court denied Buster\u2019s motion to suppress in all other respects. The court\n\n        concluded the initial stop was valid because \u201cthe officers had reasonable suspicion that\n\n        Buster was the suspect in a reported domestic assault incident potentially involving a gun\u201d\n\n        and that \u201cthe pat-down of Buster\u2019s person and the search of his bag were reasonable\u201d\n\n        because \u201cthe officers had reason to believe they were dealing with an armed and dangerous\n\n        person.\u201d JA 240. The court also declined to suppress Buster\u2019s on-the-scene statement\n\n        referencing the already discovered firearm, concluding it fell within the public-safety\n\n        exception of New York v. Quarles, 467 U.S. 649 (1984).\n\n               After the district court\u2019s ruling, Buster and the government reached a plea\n\n        agreement. The written agreement stated that Buster was \u201cpleading guilty conditionally\n\n\n                                                     4\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46         Filed: 02/22/2022     Pg: 5 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        under United States v. Bundy, 392 F.3d 641 (4th Cir. 2004),\u201d and that it \u201cpreserve[d]\u201d\n\n        Buster\u2019s \u201cright to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.\u201d JA 249. The district court\n\n        accepted the plea and sentenced Buster to 51 months of imprisonment.\n\n                                                    III.\n\n               Before turning to the merits of Buster\u2019s appeal, we must address the government\u2019s\n\n        assertion that we are powerless to do so. We disagree.\n\n               The general rule is that a valid guilty plea \u201cwaives all nonjurisdictional defects in\n\n        the proceedings conducted prior to entry of the plea.\u201d Bundy, 392 F.3d at 644. Since 1983,\n\n        however, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure have codified a practice\u2014known as a\n\n        conditional guilty plea\u2014allowing some defendants to \u201center a plea of guilty . . . while\n\n        preserving certain pretrial issues for appeal.\u201d Id. at 645. Specifically, Rule 11(a)(2)\n\n        provides that \u201c[w]ith the consent of the court and the government, a defendant may enter a\n\n        conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing the right to have an\n\n        appellate court review an adverse determination of a specified pretrial motion.\u201d\n\n              In Bundy, this Court confronted a situation where a defendant attempted to use the\n\n        conditional guilty plea mechanism to appeal the denial of \u201ca motion for production of\n\n        certain documents.\u201d 392 F.3d at 648. The Court rejected that effort, reasoning that the\n\n        \u201cdiscovery issue\u201d raised by Bundy\u2019s motion to compel was \u201cnot case-dispositive\u201d because\n\n        a ruling in his favor would do nothing more than allow him to \u201csee certain documents and\n\n        decide whether they help his defense.\u201d Id. And even though Bundy\u2019s plea agreement also\n\n        purported to preserve his ability to appeal two other issues that were \u201cthe proper subjects\n\n        of a conditional guilty plea\u201d\u2014a Fourth Amendment unreasonable search claim and a Fifth\n\n\n                                                     5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101       Doc: 46          Filed: 02/22/2022      Pg: 6 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        Amendment compelled self-incrimination claim\u2014the Court concluded that the presence\n\n        of the discovery issue so \u201ctaint[ed] the entire plea\u201d as to \u201crender[ ] the entire plea invalid.\u201d\n\n        Id. at 648\u201349. Accordingly, the Court vacated Bundy\u2019s convictions and remanded without\n\n        reaching the merits of any of Bundy\u2019s claims. Id. at 649\u201350.\n\n               Bundy does not preclude us from considering Buster\u2019s claims. For one thing, unlike\n\n        the discovery dispute that troubled the Court in that case, each issue preserved by Buster\u2019s\n\n        written plea agreement satisfies Bundy\u2019s definition of \u201ccase-dispositive.\u201d Echoing\n\n        language from Rule 11\u2019s advisory committee notes, Bundy stated that an issue is \u201ccase-\n\n        dispositive if . . . a ruling in the defendant\u2019s favor would require dismissal of the charges\n\n        or suppression of essential evidence.\u201d 392 F.3d at 648 (emphasis added); see also Fed. R.\n\n        Crim. P. 11 advisory committee\u2019s note to 1983 amendments (contemplating conditional\n\n        guilty pleas will occur \u201conly when the decision of the court of appeals will dispose of the\n\n        case either by allowing the plea to stand or by such action as compelling dismissal of the\n\n        indictment or suppressing essential evidence\u201d). The advisory committee notes repeatedly\n\n        identify the denial of \u201csuppression motions\u201d as the quintessential situation where\n\n        conditional guilty pleas are appropriate\u2014to the point of including language underscoring\n\n        that \u201cRule 11(a)(2) is not limited to\u201d such circumstances. And here, suppressing evidence\n\n        is exactly\u2014and exclusively\u2014what Buster seeks.\n\n               The government responds that the un-Mirandized statement Buster made about the\n\n        firearm at the scene is not truly essential evidence because (the government maintains) it\n\n        would have prevailed at trial even without that statement. The government would thus have\n\n        a reviewing court ask\u2014before reaching the merits of any Fourth or Fifth Amendment issue\n\n\n                                                       6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46         Filed: 02/22/2022     Pg: 7 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        preserved via Rule 11\u2014whether a defendant who in reality chose to plead guilty after\n\n        having failed to suppress a particular piece of evidence would have been convicted at a\n\n        hypothetical trial where the government was unable or chose not to use the very evidence\n\n        it had previously and successfully fought to keep in. Neither Bundy, the text of Rule 11,\n\n        nor the advisory committee notes charge appellate courts with conducting that sort of odd\n\n        counterfactual inquiry as a necessary prelude to considering an otherwise-proper appeal. 1\n\n               And there is more. Bundy specifically acknowledged its result may have been\n\n        different had the various issues the defendant sought to preserve been \u201cinextricably\n\n        intertwined,\u201d 392 F.3d at 649 (quotation marks omitted)\u2014a description fitting this\n\n        situation to a T. In Bundy, the defendant sought to plead guilty while preserving for\n\n        appellate review three issues with little overlap in underlying facts or law that had been\n\n        raised in three different pretrial motions requesting three different forms of relief\n\n        (production of documents, suppression of evidence, and dismissal of certain counts). Id. at\n\n        644. Here, in contrast, Buster\u2019s written plea agreement preserved his ability to appeal the\n\n\n\n               1\n                 Although such an approach finds support in certain non-precedential opinions, see,\n        e.g., United States v. Stinson, 765 Fed. Appx. 941 (4th Cir. 2019), we expressly disclaim it\n        here. We also make clear that whether a particular conditional guilty plea comports with\n        Bundy has no impact on our appellate jurisdiction because Bundy is simply a gloss on Rule\n        11 and \u201cany jurisdictional requirements found in [federal rules] exist by virtue of the\n        Constitution and statutes, not the rules themselves.\u201d United States v. Castillo, 496 F.3d\n        947, 955 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc); accord Arbaugh v. Y.H. Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 510 (2006)\n        (stressing the need to avoid \u201cprofligate\u201d use of the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d\u2014\u201ca word of many,\n        too many, meanings\u201d (quotation marks omitted)); Skevofilax v. Quigley, 810 F.2d 378, 388\n        (3d Cir. 1987) (Becker, J., concurring) (explaining that \u201c[t]he issue of jurisdiction is\n        separate from the issue . . . of whether the rules provide a procedural mechanism by which\u201d\n        a court may decide a particular issue).\n\n\n                                                     7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46           Filed: 02/22/2022   Pg: 8 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        denial of a single motion requesting a single form of relief (suppression), and all the\n\n        arguments that Buster sought to preserve for appeal depend on the same basic evidence\n\n        and involve closely related legal doctrines. Neither of the primary aims cited in Bundy\u2014\n\n        \u201cjudicial economy\u201d and ensuring \u201cthat the conditional guilty plea not be employed in a\n\n        manner that renders appellate review difficult or impossible,\u201d 392 F.3d at 646\u2014would be\n\n        served by artificially separating our consideration of Fourth and Fifth Amendment issues\n\n        that are inextricably intertwined.\n\n               Although our resolution of this case is fully consistent with Bundy\u2019s holding and\n\n        result, we acknowledge tension with broad language in the Court\u2019s opinion about what\n\n        constitutes a case-dispositive issue. As Chief Justice Marshall reminded us long ago,\n\n        however, \u201cgeneral expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the\n\n        case in which those expressions are used,\u201d Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264, 399 (1821),\n\n        and this Court has directly\u2014and recently\u2014disclaimed the notion \u201cthat everything said in\n\n        a panel opinion binds future panels,\u201d Payne v. Taslimi, 998 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 2021).\n\n        The broad language on which the government relies was not \u201cnecessary to the outcome\u201d\n\n        (id.) in Bundy\u2014which, as noted earlier, involved an attempt to use a conditional guilty plea\n\n        to obtain appellate review of a pretrial discovery motion and flagged denials of suppression\n\n        motions as situations where conditional guilty pleas may be used. For that reason, we read\n\n        Bundy\u2019s \u201cgeneral language\u201d the same way courts \u201coften read general language in judicial\n\n        opinions\u2014as referring in context to circumstances similar to the circumstances then before\n\n        the Court and not referring to quite different circumstances that the Court was not then\n\n        considering.\u201d Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U.S. 419, 424 (2004).\n\n\n                                                      8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46          Filed: 02/22/2022    Pg: 9 of 28\n\n\n\n\n                                                     IV.\n\n               Buster raises several objections to the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to\n\n        suppress, but we reach only one of them. We hold that the district court erred in denying\n\n        Buster\u2019s motion to suppress the firearm because the sole theory the government has pressed\n\n        in support of that result does not apply here.\n\n               Because suppression of relevant evidence is always a \u201clast resort, not [a] first\n\n        impulse,\u201d Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U.S. 586, 591 (2006), the Supreme Court has identified\n\n        numerous grounds on which a given search may be deemed constitutionally reasonable or\n\n        suppression may otherwise be denied. If officers have probable cause to believe a particular\n\n        place or item contains contraband or evidence of a crime, they can get a warrant to search\n\n        it. See, e.g., Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373, 381\u201382 (2014). Nor is a warrant always\n\n        required, including \u201cwhen the exigencies of the situation make the needs of law\n\n        enforcement so compelling that a warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the\n\n        Fourth Amendment.\u201d Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 394 (1978) (quotation marks\n\n        omitted). In addition, officers who make \u201ca lawful arrest\u201d may conduct a warrantless search\n\n        of an \u201carrestee\u2019s person and the area within his immediate control\u201d as an \u201cincident to\u201d that\n\n        arrest, United States v. Davis, 997 F.3d 191, 195 (4th Cir. 2021) (quotation marks omitted),\n\n        and later may conduct an \u201cinventory search\u201d of the arrestee\u2019s possessions so long as it is\n\n        done \u201caccording to standardized criteria, such as a uniform police department policy\u201d and\n\n        is \u201cperformed in good faith,\u201d United States v. Seay, 944 F.3d 220, 223 (4th Cir. 2019)\n\n        (quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                         9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46         Filed: 02/22/2022     Pg: 10 of 28\n\n\n\n\n               Even when a search was constitutionally unreasonable, the government still may\n\n        have arguments for why any resulting evidence should not be suppressed. It may argue, for\n\n        example, that the challenged search was conducted in good-faith reliance on a facially valid\n\n        warrant or then-binding judicial precedent. See, e.g., United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897,\n\n        922 (1984); Davis v. United States, 564 U.S. 229, 232 (2011). The government also may\n\n        argue that \u201cevidence gathered in an otherwise unreasonable search\u201d would have been\n\n        \u201cultimately or inevitably discovered . . . by lawful means,\u201d including a search incident to\n\n        arrest or an inventory search. Seay, 944 F.3d at 223 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n               Here, however, the district court identified only one basis for denying Buster\u2019s\n\n        motion to suppress the firearm found during the search of his bag, and the government has\n\n        never offered any other. Specifically, the district court concluded that the \u201csearch of\n\n        [Buster\u2019s] bag\u201d was constitutionally reasonable under the protective search doctrine\n\n        associated with Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). JA 240. On the facts of this case, we\n\n        respectfully disagree.\n\n               The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that \u201c[t]he purpose of \u201d the \u201climited\n\n        search\u201d authorized by Terry \u201cis not to discover evidence of crime, but to allow the officer\n\n        to pursue his investigation without fear of violence.\u201d Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S.\n\n        366, 373 (1993) (quoting Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 146 (1972)); accord Terry, 392\n\n        U.S. at 29. Indeed, Terry itself states that such searches may lawfully be conducted as part\n\n        of an investigatory stop only when an officer \u201creasonably . . . conclude[s] in light of his\n\n        experience\u201d that \u201cthe persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently\n\n        dangerous.\u201d 392 U.S. at 30 (emphasis added). For that reason, \u201ca protective search\u2014\n\n\n                                                    10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101       Doc: 46          Filed: 02/22/2022      Pg: 11 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        permitted without a warrant and on the basis of reasonable suspicion less than probable\n\n        cause\u2014must be strictly limited to that which is necessary for the discovery of weapons\n\n        which might be used to harm the officer or others nearby.\u201d Dickerson, 508 U.S. at 373\n\n        (quotation marks omitted).\n\n               Although the parties dispute many things about the events of the evening, there is\n\n        no disagreement about one critical fact: When the officer opened Buster\u2019s bag (thus\n\n        beginning a \u201csearch\u201d of the bag), Buster was handcuffed on the ground and had no access\n\n        to it. Indeed, the record is clear that the officers opened the bag and examined its contents\n\n        after they had tackled Buster, handcuffed him, cut the bag off his body, and \u201cmove[d] it\n\n        away from his person.\u201d U.S. Br. 9. The government offers no explanation for how the\n\n        contents of the bag presented any credible threat to the officers\u2019 safety at the time they\n\n        searched it, and quickly frisking an unsecured suspect or a bag during a Terry stop is simply\n\n        not the same as methodically searching the contents of a bag to which a suspect no longer\n\n        has access\u2014particularly where the suspect remained restrained and under the officers\u2019\n\n        physical control. \u201cHaving already used significant force to secure the scene for safety\n\n        purposes, the officers cannot leverage the safety rationale into a justification for a full-scale\n\n        search.\u201d United States v. Miles, 247 F.3d 1009, 1015 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\n               In arguing to the contrary, the government relies on the searching officer\u2019s\n\n        testimony that, when she removed the bag from Buster\u2019s body, she noticed it \u201cwas hard to\n\n        the touch,\u201d which, \u201c[i]n [her] experience . . . indicates . . . a weapon.\u201d JA 135\u201336. But even\n\n        assuming the officer had reasonable suspicion that the bag contained a weapon (a point we\n\n        need not decide), that fact alone could not generate reasonable suspicion that Buster was\n\n\n                                                       11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101       Doc: 46        Filed: 02/22/2022     Pg: 12 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        \u201cpresently dangerous\u201d after he was already restrained and no longer had access to the bag.\n\n        Terry, 392 U.S. at 30. 2\n\n               The government\u2019s reliance on the officers\u2019 suspicion that Buster may have\n\n        discharged a firearm earlier in the evening fails for the same reason. Even if the officers\n\n        had reasonable suspicion that was true (another point we need not decide), the likelihood\n\n        that the officers would find a firearm or other weapon in the bag has no bearing on the\n\n        justification for a protective frisk after Buster had been separated from the bag and no\n\n        longer had access to it. Cf. Davis, 997 F.3d at 200 (search incident to arrest doctrine did\n\n        not justify search of a backpack \u201cnot within reaching distance of \u201d the arrestee when the\n\n        officer searched it).\n\n               We emphasize the limits of our holding. We do not address situations where a\n\n        firearm was found on a suspect\u2019s person or a bag was opened before a suspect was subdued\n\n        or while they were still within reach of the bag. Cf. United States v. Walker, 615 F.3d 728,\n\n        730, 733\u201334 (6th Cir. 2010) (approving limited Terry search of bag where armed robbery\n\n        suspect was not restrained and officers \u201cby no means had the scene under control or their\n\n        safety secure\u201d). This case does not present (and the parties have not raised) any question\n\n        about whether or when officers may search a bag before returning it once a Terry stop\n\n        concludes. Cf. id. at 734 (describing situation where the \u201conly alternative\u201d to a protective\n\n\n               2\n                 Although the \u201cplain feel\u201d doctrine may be relevant when an officer \u201cdiscovers\n        contraband through the sense of touch during an otherwise lawful search,\u201d Dickerson, 508\n        U.S. at 375, the officer never testified that she had reason to believe the bag contained\n        contraband (as opposed to a weapon) and the government acknowledges that it has never\n        made any such argument here. Oral Arg. 36:00\u201336:16.\n\n\n                                                    12\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46         Filed: 02/22/2022     Pg: 13 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        frisk was \u201cto give a suspect access to a potential weapon\u201d located \u201cin an un-searched bag\u201d).\n\n        Because the government has never so argued, we do not consider whether at some point\n\n        the officers might have acquired probable cause to arrest Buster for assault or some other\n\n        offense and, if they did, whether the district court\u2019s decision not to suppress the firearm\n\n        could have been justified on some other ground. We hold only\u2014but importantly\u2014that a\n\n        doctrine authorizing a limited warrantless search to protect officer safety cannot be\n\n        stretched to cover situations where there is no realistic danger to officer safety.\n\n        Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Buster\u2019s motion to suppress the\n\n        firearm.\n\n               That leaves only the issue of remedy. Although the government argues that any error\n\n        in denying Buster\u2019s motion to suppress his on-the-scene statement about the firearm would\n\n        have been harmless, it makes no such claim about the district court\u2019s failure to suppress\n\n        the firearm itself. The government\u2019s silence on this point makes sense given the\n\n        circumstances of this case, where the underlying charge is predicated on Buster possessing\n\n        a firearm we now hold must be suppressed. For that reason, we need not address whether\u2014\n\n        and, if so, how\u2014harmless-error analysis applies in the context of conditional guilty pleas.\n\n        Compare United States v. Lustig, 830 F.3d 1075, 1087 (9th Cir. 2016) (court reviewing a\n\n        conditional guilty plea may deem an error harmless if \u201cthe government has proved beyond\n\n        a reasonable doubt that the erroneously denied suppression motion did not contribute to\n\n        the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty\u201d), with id. at 1092 (Watford, J., concurring)\n\n        (arguing that \u201charmless error analysis . . . has no place in this context\u201d and that if a\n\n        reviewing court \u201cdoes anything other than affirm in full the district court\u2019s denial of [the\n\n\n                                                    13\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46         Filed: 02/22/2022     Pg: 14 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        defendant\u2019s] suppression motion, he is entitled to withdraw his guilty plea without more\u201d).\n\n        Instead, we hold only that this firearm should have been suppressed and that Buster must\n\n        be given an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea.

Bundy, this court held that conditional guilty pleas are valid under\n\n        Rule 11(a)(2) only if all the issues they preserve are \u201ccase-dispositive\u201d\u2014so central to the\n\n        government\u2019s case that a ruling for the defendant would effectively require dismissal of the\n\n        charges against him. 392 F.3d 641, 648 (4th Cir. 2004). Bundy\u2019s rule is textually baseless,\n\n        pragmatically unjustified, and entirely binding on this panel. And it commands that\n\n        Buster\u2019s attempt to preserve a non-dispositive Miranda issue for appeal renders his entire\n\n        conditional plea invalid. But rather than apply Bundy faithfully to the facts before us, the\n\n        majority warps Bundy\u2019s core holding and adds to it a new \u201cinextricably-intertwined\u201d\n\n        exception that promises to vex litigants for decades to come. While I would fully support\n\n        abandoning Bundy through the proper channel\u2014an en banc rehearing\u2014I cannot condone\n\n        the majority\u2019s sly revision of it here. I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                                       I.\n\n               For most of our nation\u2019s history, a defendant\u2019s guilty plea would waive his right to\n\n        appeal the resolution of pretrial motions. See Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267\n\n        (1973). This, when coupled with the defendant\u2019s inability to bring an interlocutory appeal\n\n        on such issues, see Di Bella v. United States, 369 U.S. 121, 131\u201332 (1962), meant that \u201ca\n\n        defendant who has lost one or more pretrial motions will often go through an entire trial\n\n        simply to preserve the pretrial issues for later appellate review.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 11\n\n        advisory committee note to 1983 Amendment. To combat this waste of judicial resources,\n\n        some (but not all) circuits permitted defendants to plead guilty conditionally. Id.; compare\n\n        United States v. Burke, 517 F.2d 377, 379 (2d Cir. 1975) (permitting conditional pleas so\n\n\n                                                      15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101       Doc: 46         Filed: 02/22/2022      Pg: 16 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        long as the prosecutor does not object to their entry), with United States v. Matthews, 472\n\n        F.2d 1173, 1174 (4th Cir. 1973) (holding that a guilty plea \u201cswallows up\u201d pretrial errors).\n\n               But in 1983, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2) was amended to expressly\n\n        allow conditional guilty pleas: \u201cWith the consent of the court and the government, a\n\n        defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving in writing\n\n        the right to have an appellate court review an adverse determination of a specified pretrial\n\n        motion.\u201d The Rule\u2019s text does not limit the issues that the government and the defendant\u2014\n\n        with district court\u2019s consent\u2014may preserve via a conditional plea.\n\n               Nonetheless, we imposed such a requirement (and a strict one at that) in Bundy.\n\n        There we held that \u201ca valid guilty plea preserves for appellate review only case-dispositive\n\n        pretrial issues.\u201d Bundy, 392 F.3d at 647. Therefore, \u201c[a] district court should reject any\n\n        conditional guilty plea that purports to preserve for appellate review pretrial issues that, in\n\n        the district court\u2019s own judgment, are not fully case-dispositive.\u201d Id. Bundy then strictly\n\n        defined \u201ccase-dispositive\u201d: \u201cThe disposition of a pretrial issue is case-dispositive if (1) a\n\n        ruling in the defendant\u2019s favor would require dismissal of the charges or suppression of\n\n        essential evidence, or (2) a ruling in the Government\u2019s favor would require affirming the\n\n        conviction. In short, there should be no trial after the specified issues are resolved by the\n\n        court of appeals.\u201d Id. at 648.\n\n               One searches in vain for any textual basis for Bundy\u2019s strict limitation on conditional\n\n        pleas. Instead, Bundy appears to have derived its rule from decisions in other circuits that\n\n        either predate the 1983 enactment of Rule 11(a)(2) or are themselves devoid of any textual\n\n        analysis. See id. at 646\u201347. In doing so, it advanced two policy justifications for its\n\n\n                                                      16\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101       Doc: 46         Filed: 02/22/2022      Pg: 17 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        atextual creation: judicial economy and adequacy of review. But even on their own terms\n\n        neither support the rule Bundy imposed.\n\n               First, the Bundy court worried that permitting a conditional plea on minor issues\n\n        might stall the case, citing concerns expressed in Rule 11\u2019s advisory committee note. Id.\n\n        at 645\u201346. But the advisory committee did not say that a judicial case-dispositive rule was\n\n        necessary to address that concern; instead, it concluded that the government-approval\n\n        requirement was adequate to avoid a deluge of dilatory conditional pleas. Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n        11 advisory committee note to 1983 Amendment. That reasoning makes sense. It may be\n\n        true that the government does not have a direct incentive to protect judicial economy. But\n\n        it does have strong parallel incentives to avoid excessive appeals. In most cases, the\n\n        government\u2019s interest in preserving its own resources and avoiding unjustified delay will\n\n        motivate it to not sanction appeals over trivial issues.\n\n               There may be exceptions. And mistakes may be made. But vacating and remanding\n\n        when the government, the defendant, and the court agree to permit a conditional plea fails\n\n        to promote judicial economy. To the contrary, rejecting this conditional plea appears to\n\n        demand unnecessary proceedings below and, likely, a second appeal. When a non-\n\n        dispositive issue is intentionally preserved (like in Bundy), it is likely because the issue is\n\n        salient to the defendant, perhaps irrationally so. In that instance, Bundy\u2019s rule requires the\n\n        defendant to go to trial solely to preserve the issue, leading to a considerable waste of\n\n        resources to put on an unnecessary trial.\n\n               Second, Bundy worried that, unless our appellate court restricts the permissible\n\n        subjects of a conditional appeal, we may be forced to pass on an issue not yet adequately\n\n\n                                                      17\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101       Doc: 46          Filed: 02/22/2022      Pg: 18 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        developed. 392 F.3d at 646\u201347. But it is unclear why our self-doubt about resolving some\n\n        issues justifies setting aside pleas authorized by Rule 11, agreed to by both parties, and\n\n        blessed by the district court. 1 After all, we have a \u201cvirtually unflagging\u201d obligation to\n\n        decide cases properly before us, even if they might be hard sometimes. Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc.\n\n        v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 126 (2014). If a party or the district\n\n        court doesn\u2019t think we will be able to reach an adequate decision based on the record as it\n\n        exists, they don\u2019t have to agree to the plea. 2 But once they have, we have a duty to do our\n\n        best to resolve the preserved issues.\n\n               And even if adequacy of review were a real concern, it is unclear why case-\n\n        dispositiveness is a reasonable proxy for adequate-reviewability. For example, the Rule\n\n        11 advisory committee identified a speedy trial violation as an issue that is \u201cbest considered\n\n        only after the relevant facts have been developed at trial.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 advisory\n\n\n               1\n                 A district court exercising a discretionary power may, at times, abuse that\n        discretion, including by failing to recognize \u201cjudicially-recognized factors limiting its\n        discretion.\u201d United States v. Henry, 673 F.3d 285, 291 (4th Cir. 2012). But that does not\n        give us carte blanche to impose any limitations we feel like on the district court. \u201cCourts\n        are the mere instruments of the law, and can will nothing. When they are said to exercise a\n        discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course\n        prescribed by law; and, when that is discerned, it is the duty of the Court to follow it.\u201d\n        Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 738, 866 (1824) (Marshall, C.J.).\n        Here, Rule 11(a)(2) opens our doors to conditional pleas predicated on pretrial rulings; we\n        cannot close those doors to all but a select few defendants.\n               2\n                  Indeed, is it our general rule that a party who has knowingly and voluntarily\n        requested the district court to take a particular action cannot later complain to us that the\n        action it requested was an abuse of discretion. See Wilson v. Lindler, 8 F.3d 173, 175 (4th\n        Cir. 1993) (en banc); Ridge v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 117 F.3d 126, 129 (4th Cir. 1997).\n        Bundy created a seemingly unprecedented exception to this \u201cinvited-error doctrine,\u201d in\n        which we must reverse an action that both parties requested the district court take as an\n        abuse of that court\u2019s discretion.\n\n                                                      18\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46         Filed: 02/22/2022      Pg: 19 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        committee note to 1983 Amendment. Yet a speedy trial violation requires the automatic\n\n        dismissal of the indictment, meaning that it is case-dispositive. See Barker v. Wingo, 407\n\n        U.S. 514, 522 (1972). On the other hand, motions to suppress evidence may be resolved\n\n        based on undisputed facts, yet not be case-dispositive.\n\n               One particularly puzzling argument advanced by Bundy is that \u201c[t]he adequacy of\n\n        the factual record is especially important for harmless-error analysis\u201d and therefore,\n\n        \u201c[p]ermitting conditional guilty pleas to preserve non-case-dispositive pretrial issues for\n\n        appeal would undermine harmless-error analysis.\u201d 392 F.3d at 647. But it is unclear why\n\n        we are in a better position to determine whether an issue is case-dispositive than we are to\n\n        determine whether an issue is harmless. The two are basically the same question, just with\n\n        different thresholds. Bundy\u2019s standard is essentially a harmful-error test, where we must\n\n        determine whether the exclusion of the evidence would be fatal to the government\u2019s case,\n\n        as compared to a harmless-error test where we determine whether it was inconsequential\n\n        to that case. In that sense, I agree with the majority that the government is asking us to\n\n        engage in a bizarre \u201chypothetical trial where the government was unable or chose not to\n\n        use the very evidence it had previously and successfully fought to keep in.\u201d Majority Op.\n\n        7. But the majority is wrong to place the fault with the government; Bundy itself requires\n\n        that \u201codd counterfactual inquiry.\u201d Majority Op. 7. 3\n\n\n\n\n               3\n                  This argument for limiting conditional pleas was also considered and rejected by\n        the advisory committee. It acknowledged that applying harmless error analysis absent a\n        full trial record would be difficult. Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 advisory committee note to 1983\n        Amendment. But it concluded that this cost did not justify barring conditional pleas. Id.\n\n                                                    19\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46         Filed: 02/22/2022      Pg: 20 of 28\n\n\n\n\n               In short, Bundy created a judicial doctrine unsupported by either the text of Rule 11\n\n        or sound policy. And that doctrine is binding on this panel. One panel of this court cannot\n\n        overrule another. McMellon v. United States, 387 F.3d 329, 332 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc).\n\n        Panels may well disagree. But we have decided that an opinion produced by a panel states\n\n        rules of law that can\u2014indeed must\u2014be followed. So we must adhere to prior panel\n\n        decisions no matter how strongly we disagree: \u201cWe must follow a prior panel decision\n\n        even if it had abysmal reasoning, put forward unworkable commands, engendered no\n\n        reliance interests, lacked consistency with other decisions, and has been undermined by\n\n        later developments.\u201d Payne v. Taslimi, 998 F.3d 648, 654 n.2 (4th Cir. 2021).\n\n               And adhering to Bundy here produces a clear result: Buster\u2019s plea must be vacated.\n\n        Buster sought to preserve two issues for appeal: (1) a motion to suppress the gun and\n\n        ammunition found during the stop based on the Fourth Amendment; and (2) a motion to\n\n        suppress his un-Mirandized statement that he had \u201cthat gun and my knife\u201d based on the\n\n        Fifth Amendment. The first issue involves the \u201csuppression of essential evidence\u201d and is\n\n        case-dispositive; the government cannot possibly prove that Buster possessed a firearm\n\n        that had travelled in interstate commerce that night if the gun and ammunition are\n\n        suppressed. 4 The second issue is not case-dispositive. Even if it the statement about the\n\n\n\n               4\n                 One might even argue that the motion to suppress the gun and ammunition is not\n        case-dispositive. The government might try to prove its case based on Buster\u2019s confession\n        that he possessed \u201cthat gun\u201d\u2014a statement he did not seek to suppress as part of his Fourth\n        Amendment motion. But the government could not introduce the gun itself or any evidence\n        obtained from it, so there would be no way to prove that the referenced \u201cgun\u201d met the legal\n        definition of a firearm or that it had moved in interstate commerce, essential elements under\n        \u00a7 922(g).\n\n                                                     20\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101       Doc: 46          Filed: 02/22/2022      Pg: 21 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        gun is suppressed, the gun itself provides the evidence necessary to prove that Buster\n\n        possessed a firearm that had travelled in interstate commerce, and other evidence from that\n\n        night provides strong proof that he did so knowingly. The statement might be icing on the\n\n        prosecution\u2019s cake, but it is not essential to a conviction and so is not case-dispositive.\n\n               Bundy is also clear on the effect of preserving both dispositive and non-dispositive\n\n        issues in a conditional plea: \u201cthe presence of one non-case-dispositive issue in this\n\n        conditional plea renders the entire plea invalid.\u201d 392 F.3d at 649. So, because Buster\u2019s\n\n        plea tried to preserve a non-dispositive Miranda issue, his entire plea is invalid under\n\n        Bundy and must be vacated.\n\n                                                      II.\n\n               The majority reaches the contrary outcome, holding that Buster\u2019s conditional plea\n\n        was valid. In doing so, the majority purports to follow Bundy. But it does so by twisting\n\n        the language of Bundy to reach the answer it wants, rather than faithfully applying it.\n\n               The majority\u2019s analysis starts out well enough, identifying Bundy\u2019s core holding\n\n        that only \u201ccase-dispositive\u201d issues may be preserved, and that an issue is \u201ccase-dispositive\n\n        if . . . a ruling in the defendant\u2019s favor would require dismissal of the charges or suppression\n\n        of essential evidence.\u201d 392 F.3d at 648. The obvious next question for someone truly\n\n        interested in discerning the meaning of Bundy\u2019s holding would be: What is \u201cessential\n\n        evidence\u201d? That is a question the majority never bothers to ask, probably because it doesn\u2019t\n\n        like Bundy\u2019s answer. That answer can be found, in fact, in the very next sentence of the\n\n        Bundy opinion: \u201cIn short, there should be no trial after the specified issues are resolved by\n\n        the court of appeals.\u201d Consistent with that explanation, the concluding sentence of that\n\n\n                                                      21\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46         Filed: 02/22/2022     Pg: 22 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        paragraph summarizes: \u201cThe question for the district court [on whether to approve a\n\n        conditional plea] is whether the court of appeals\u2019 resolution of the issue specified in the\n\n        plea would end the case one way or the other.\u201d Id. These statements leave no doubt: when\n\n        the court said that denial of suppression motions could be preserved only if they involved\n\n        \u201cessential evidence,\u201d it meant that they must involve essential evidence. Not any evidence.\n\n        Not material evidence.       Not important evidence.    Essential evidence\u2014evidence so\n\n        \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d or \u201cindispensable\u201d that its suppression would force the government\n\n        to dismiss the charge, thus disposing of the case. Essential, Random House Webster\u2019s\n\n        College Dictionary (2000).\n\n               Instead, the majority implies (though it doesn\u2019t expressly hold) that any suppression\n\n        motion necessarily involves essential evidence and so is case-dispositive. Majority Op. 6\n\n        (holding that Bundy is satisfied because \u201csuppressing evidence is exactly\u2014and\n\n        exclusively\u2014what Buster seeks\u201d). That interpretation amazingly manages to redefine\n\n        \u201cessential\u201d as \u201cnonessential\u201d and \u201cdispositive\u201d as \u201cnon-dispositive.\u201d And it requires the\n\n        majority to dismiss as dicta all of Bundy\u2019s language clarifying what \u201ccase-dispositive\u201d and\n\n        \u201cessential evidence\u201d mean.\n\n               But Bundy\u2019s \u201cbroad language\u201d defining its case-dispositive rule is far from dicta. It\n\n        is true, of course, that not every word in a panel decision is binding; \u201cperipheral\u201d remarks\n\n        that do not represent the court\u2019s \u201cfull and careful consideration\u201d are dicta and are not\n\n        controlling. Payne, 998 F.3d at 654. But we aren\u2019t dealing here with peripheral remarks\n\n        detached from Bundy\u2019s holding. We are dealing with language defining what Bundy\u2019s\n\n\n\n\n                                                    22\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101       Doc: 46          Filed: 02/22/2022      Pg: 23 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        holding actually means. That definition is no doubt broader than the majority would like.\n\n        But that doesn\u2019t transform those statements into dicta.\n\n               The only statements strictly \u201cnecessary\u201d to resolve a case are \u201caffirmed\u201d and\n\n        \u201creversed.\u201d Yet all agree that a court\u2019s holding encompasses more than this judgment; it\n\n        includes the court\u2019s ratio decidendi\u2014the chain of reasoning necessary to tie the facts of\n\n        the case to the decision reached. Dicta is what remains: those statements that \u201ccould have\n\n        been deleted without seriously impairing the analytical foundation of the holding.\u201d Payne,\n\n        998 F.3d at 654 (citations omitted). Though that distinction is often difficult to make, see\n\n        generally Michael Abramowicz & Maxwell Stearns, Defining Dicta, 57 Stan. L. Rev. 953\n\n        (2005), it is essential that we exercise care in doing so. If we simply dismiss any statement\n\n        we disagree with as \u2018mere dicta,\u2019 we are no longer acting as judges, but as policymakers\u2014\n\n        deciding which words from precedent we like and selectively applying them. See Michael\n\n        C. Dorf, Dicta and Article III, 142 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1997, 2029\u201330 (1994).\n\n               So let us carefully consider the decision in Bundy. That defendant entered a\n\n        conditional plea preserving for appeal certain pretrial decisions, including the denial of a\n\n        discovery motion. Bundy, 392 F.3d at 644. The result of Bundy was the vacatur of that\n\n        plea. Id. at 650. So what reasoning linked those facts to that result? First, the court held\n\n        that only \u201cfully case-dispositive\u201d issues could be preserved for appeal. Id. at 647. Second,\n\n        the court defined case-dispositive: a ruling favorable to the defendant must \u201crequire\n\n        dismissal of the charges or suppression of essential evidence,\u201d such that there would be\n\n        \u201cno trial after the specified issues are resolved.\u201d Id. at 648. Third, it applied this definition\n\n        of \u201ccase-dispositive\u201d to the discovery issue, observing that a \u201cfavorable ruling on this issue\n\n\n                                                       23\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101       Doc: 46         Filed: 02/22/2022      Pg: 24 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        will not guarantee dismissal of Count Two.\u201d Id. 5 Finding that the discovery issue was\n\n        therefore not \u201ccase-dispositive\u201d under its definition of that term, the court vacated the plea.\n\n        Id. at 650.\n\n               The majority seeks to redefine that second step out of existence, narrowing Bundy\n\n        to a case about \u201ca pretrial discovery motion.\u201d Majority Op. 8. The Bundy court could have\n\n        done that. It could have limited its decision to discovery issues. But it didn\u2019t. To the\n\n        contrary, it held that \u201ca valid conditional guilty plea preserves for appellate review only\n\n        case-dispositive pretrial issues.\u201d Id. at 647. We cannot now substitute a narrower holding\n\n        Bundy could have advanced for the one it actually did. Brown v. Board of Education is\n\n        about more than a school in Kansas. 347 U.S. 483, 495 (1954) (holding that \u201cin the field\n\n        of public education the doctrine of \u2018separate but equal\u2019 has no place\u201d). Marbury v. Madison\n\n        is about more than William Marbury\u2019s commission. 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 180 (1803)\n\n        (holding that \u201ca law repugnant to the Constitution is void\u201d). And Bundy is about more than\n\n        a discovery dispute. 392 F.3d at 648 (holding that the resolution of an issue in a conditional\n\n        plea must \u201cend the case one way or the other\u201d). Bundy stated a rule of law applicable to\n\n        all conditional pleas: they must preserve only issues that would dispose of the case. The\n\n\n               5\n                 The court also considered two other pretrial motions preserved by Bundy\u2014who\n        pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered firearm. 392 F.3d at 648. The first was a\n        motion to dismiss because the gun-registration law was unconstitutional, which the court\n        observed would mandate dismissal as a matter of law. Id. The second was a motion to\n        suppress all evidence seized from a search of Bundy\u2019s house, including the firearm at issue.\n        Id. Notably, the court did not decide that this motion was automatically case-dispositive\n        merely because it was a suppression motion. Rather, it held that the motion was case-\n        dispositive only after determining that \u201ca favorable ruling on these issues would require\n        suppression of essential evidence and would likely lead to dismissal of the firearms charge\n        in Count Two.\u201d Id. (emphasis added).\n\n                                                      24\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101       Doc: 46         Filed: 02/22/2022     Pg: 25 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        Miranda issue preserved here would not dispose of the case. And so Bundy prohibits\n\n        including it in the plea.\n\n               The majority also puts forth an alternative rationale for its decision: a postulated\n\n        exception to the Bundy rule that permits us to review non-case-dispositive issues that are\n\n        \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with case-dispositive ones. Ironically, while casting aside\n\n        Bundy\u2019s core holding as dicta, the majority relies heavily on Bundy\u2019s discussion of this\n\n        possible exception, which was dicta. Bundy never held that the exception exists, but simply\n\n        found that if it exists it did not apply under the facts presented there. 392 F.3d at 649. Yet\n\n        the majority today affirms the exception\u2019s existence and concludes that it is satisfied.\n\n               Unlike its attempt to redefine Bundy\u2019s holding, the majority has the authority to mint\n\n        this new exception. Bundy left the door open, and we may walk through it if we wish. But\n\n        I think it unwise. Because, as a practical matter, the majority\u2019s approach only makes\n\n        Bundy\u2014already a trap for unwary defendants and prosecutors\u2014even more complex and\n\n        hazardous. Future parties to an incipient plea agreement now need to embark on a multi-\n\n        step test to decide what they can and cannot preserve for appeal. First, they need to decide\n\n        whether each issue is \u201ccase-dispositive.\u201d 6 Then, the parties must proceed to the new\n\n        Bundy-Buster Step 2:        Are the issues that are not \u201ccase-dispositive\u201d nonetheless\n\n        \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with those that are? The majority does not say what it means\n\n        for two issues to be \u201cinextricably intertwined.\u201d At best, litigants may look to the four\n\n\n\n               6\n                 Even applying that first step will be daunting, since the majority opinion makes\n        clear that \u201ccase-dispositive\u201d no longer means \u201cdispositive of the case,\u201d yet what it does\n        mean remains elusive.\n\n                                                     25\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46          Filed: 02/22/2022     Pg: 26 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        probative factors identified by the majority in this case: (1) the two issues appealed were\n\n        raised in the same motion; (2) they would warrant the same general type of remedy; (3)\n\n        they rest on the \u201csame basic evidence\u201d; and (or?) (4) they involve \u201cclosely related legal\n\n        doctrines.\u201d\n\n               But this \u201cstandard\u201d raises even more questions. What does it mean for two issues\n\n        to turn on \u201cthe same basic evidence\u201d? Here, the only \u201cbasic evidence\u201d relevant to the\n\n        majority\u2019s Fourth Amendment ruling is that Buster was handcuffed and on the ground at\n\n        the time of the search. The Miranda issue, by contrast, depends on whether the question\n\n        eliciting Buster\u2019s incriminating statement was justified by the officer\u2019s need to protect\n\n        himself while searching a now-standing Buster. So the evidence pertinent to each issue is\n\n        not really the same. I suppose the two events occurred during the same police interaction\u2014\n\n        is that what it takes for two issues to depend on the \u201csame basic evidence\u201d?\n\n               And what counts as \u201cclosely related legal doctrines\u201d? Here, Buster seeks to\n\n        suppress two different types of evidence based on different provisions of the U.S.\n\n        Constitution\u2014the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.           Are those two doctrines \u201cclosely\n\n        related\u201d just because they both involve constitutional rules of criminal procedure? What if\n\n        Buster\u2019s appeal also involved a deprivation of post-indictment counsel in violation of the\n\n        Sixth Amendment? Is that doctrine also \u201cclosely related\u201d? What about warrant defects?\n\n        Speedy trial violations?     Double jeopardy?      We don\u2019t know.        And neither, more\n\n        importantly, do defendants, prosecutors, or district courts.\n\n               If the Bundy-Buster doctrine were based on the text of Rule 11 or the common law,\n\n        litigants and district courts might have some way of predicting the answers to these thorny\n\n\n                                                     26\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46          Filed: 02/22/2022     Pg: 27 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        questions. But because both Bundy\u2019s rule and the majority\u2019s judicial exception were\n\n        created from whole cloth, litigants and courts can only guess the answers and hope that we\n\n        agree with them on appeal. 7 While the majority, like Bundy before it, justifies its decision\n\n        as in the interest of \u201cjudicial economy,\u201d in truth it will only create more confusion and\n\n        waste for future defendants, prosecutors, and judges.\n\n                                       *              *             *\n\n               All of this is not to say that we should be stuck with Bundy\u2019s stringent judge-created\n\n        rule forever. Though one panel of our court cannot overrule another, the entire court, sitting\n\n        en banc, can. Jones v. Angelone, 94 F.3d 900, 905 (4th Cir. 1996). But in the meantime,\n\n        Bundy remains binding law we should faithfully apply. So I would apply Bundy to these\n\n        facts, bar Buster\u2019s appeal, and give a full-throated endorsement for overturning Bundy\n\n        during reconsideration en banc. 8 Instead, the majority goes to great lengths to refashion\n\n        the Bundy rule to suit its own liking. But just as in Bundy, there is nothing in Rule 11 to\n\n        justify the majority\u2019s redefinition of \u201ccase-dispositive\u201d or its new inextricably intertwined\n\n        exception. So its decision today simply adds made-up alterations and exceptions to a made-\n\n\n\n               7\n                Until today, those parties could at least rely on some of our unpublished decisions\n        for guidance. See, e.g., United States v. Stinson, 765 F. App\u2019x 941, 942\u201343 (4th Cir. 2019).\n        But the majority expressly disavows those decisions.\n               8\n                 Because Buster\u2019s attempt to preserve the non-dispositive Miranda issue voids his\n        entire plea, I would not reach the merits of the case-dispositive Fourth Amendment issue.\n        Yet I note that our circuit has held that a search of a suspect\u2019s bag much like the one here\n        was a valid Terry frisk. See United States v. Hernandez-Mendez, 626 F.3d 203, 213 (4th\n        Cir. 2010). I also emphasize the majority\u2019s comment that the government might have\n        succeeded if it sought to justify the search on another theory; the government should now\n        be on notice that it needs to put forth all the alternative theories that justify a search.\n\n                                                     27\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 21-4101      Doc: 46         Filed: 02/22/2022     Pg: 28 of 28\n\n\n\n\n        up rule. I decline to join in this tailoring of the emperor\u2019s new clothes, and respectfully\n\n        dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    28\n\f",
