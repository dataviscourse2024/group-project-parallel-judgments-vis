The\nDistrict Court ruled that the Board of Immigration Appeals\n(\u201cBIA\u201d) erred when it held that the doctrine of collateral\nestoppel did not bar the Immigration and Naturalization\nService (\u201cService\u201d) from relitigating Duvall\u2019s alienage during\na different proceeding involving two new crimes she\ncommitted.\n  We do not reach the merits of the collateral estoppel\nquestion decided in Duvall\u2019s favor by the District Court.\nInstead, we hold that the District Court lacked jurisdiction\nto entertain Duvall\u2019s habeas corpus petition. Accordingly,\nwe will vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment1 and remand\n\n1. The District Court\u2019s August 9, 2002 judgment granted Duvall\u2019s\npetition for a writ of habeas corpus, barred the Service by collateral\nestoppel from relitigating the issue of alienage and released Duvall from\ncustody by the Service.\n\f                               3\n\n\nwith a direction that the District Court dismiss Duvall\u2019s\nhabeas petition.\n\n                               I.\n  The District Court held that it had jurisdiction over this\nhabeas action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. We have\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We have\nplenary review over a district court\u2019s grant of a habeas\ncorpus petition, see Yang v. Maugans, 68 F.3d 1540, 1546\n(3d Cir. 1995), and a district court\u2019s subject matter\njurisdiction. See Growth Horizons, Inc. v. Delaware Country,\nPa., 983 F.2d 1277, 1280 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n                              II.\n   Andrea Duvall is a native and citizen of Jamaica who, in\nOctober 1993, became a lawful permanent resident in the\nUnited States. Since arriving in the United States in 1987,\nshe has been no stranger to crime. In 1989, she pled guilty\nto crimes of petit larceny and retail theft, and was convicted\nof another incident of retail theft. Also in that year, she pled\nguilty to three other offenses\u2014two for retail theft and one\nfor third-degree felony theft by receiving stolen property.\nThese pleas did not account for all of the other criminal\noffenses with which she was charged. Other charges were\ndropped in exchange for her testimony against a co-\nconspirator. In 1990, Duvall again pled guilty to separate\ninstances of shoplifting and retail theft. In the early 1990s,\nshe was convicted on two more unrelated charges of retail\ntheft and for possession of burglar\u2019s tools.\n  These convictions led to a November 1993 deportation\nhearing. At that hearing, Duvall refused to answer\nquestions about her alienage. The Service then sought to\nintroduce her application for permanent residence. In that\napplication, Duvall admitted her alienage, but the\nImmigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) excluded the document from\nevidence as the Service had failed to comply with Local\nRules, which required that the document be submitted ten\ndays prior to hearing. Accordingly, the IJ held that the\nService could not prove alienage and thus ended the\nhearing.\n\f                                    4\n\n\n   Undaunted, Duvall continued her criminal exploits,\nacquiring two additional felony convictions by 2000.2\nFollowing these convictions and after having been informed\nof her right to remain silent, on March 12, 2001 she offered\na voluntary sworn statement with the Service admitting her\nalienage. Subsequently, the Service initiated new removal\nproceedings against her on March 16, 2001, charging that\nshe was an alien subject to removal for having been\nconvicted for two new crimes involving moral turpitude, 8\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii), and for being convicted of an\naggravated felony involving a theft offense for which a term\nof imprisonment of at least one year was imposed, 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).\n  The IJ terminated proceedings on June 6, 2001, granting\nDuvall\u2019s motion to collaterally estop the Service from\nrelitigating the alienage issue. On December 6, 2001, the\nBIA reversed the IJ\u2019s collateral estoppel ruling and\nremanded for proceedings to continue before the IJ. The\nBIA denied Duvall\u2019s motion for rehearing on March 20,\n2002.\n  Subsequently, Duvall filed a habeas petition in the\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on\nJune 6, 2002. The District Court granted her petition on\nAugust 9. Duvall v. Elwood, No. CIV.A.02-2081, 2002 WL\n1870457 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 9, 2002) (unpublished). In granting\nher petition, the District Court focused wholly on the\ncollateral estoppel issue and held that the Service was\nbarred from relitigating the issue of alienage. Accordingly,\nthe District Court entered an order which directed Duvall\u2019s\nrelease from the Service. In granting Duvall\u2019s petition, the\nDistrict Court gave short shrift to the question of the\ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction and indeed erred in holding that Duvall\ndid not have to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\n                                   III.\n  Our analysis begins with the Immigration and\nNaturalization Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1),\n\n2. In 1995, Duvall pled guilty to third-degree felony retail theft. In July\n2000, she pled guilty to another third-degree felony retail theft.\n\f                                    5\n\n\nwhich provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] court may review\na final order of removal only if \u2014 the alien has exhausted\nall administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\n. . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).\n  Notwithstanding this provision, the District Court\nconcluded, without analysis, that it had habeas jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 to entertain Duvall\u2019s claim. In so\ndoing, the District Court stated that \u201c[e]xhaustion of\nadministrative remedies is not required here and defendant\nhas not raised it as a defense. McCarthy v. Madigan, 503\nU.S. 140, 144 (1992) (exhaustion is a matter of judicial\ndiscretion unless mandated by statute).\u201d Duvall, 2002 WL\n1870457, at *1 n.1.3\n   It is settled that where Congress has \u201cclearly required\nexhaustion,\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 144, or where\ncongressional intent is at least \u201cfairly discernible,\u201d Massieu\nv. Reno, 91 F.3d 416, 420 (3d Cir. 1996) (citation omitted),\nexhaustion will be deemed statutorily mandated.\n   The predecessor to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), which is the\nrelevant statute here, was 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c).4 Section\n1105a(c) was repealed in 1996 and replaced by the current\n\u00a7 1252(d). The predecessor statute, just as the current\nstatute, denied review of orders of deportation or removal\nwhere an alien had not exhausted administrative remedies.\n  Section 1252(d)(1) reads, in relevant part: \u201cA court may\nreview a final order of removal only if\u2014(1) the alien has\nexhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien\nas of right. . . .\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (emphasis supplied).\n\n3. The District Court noted further that the Government did not raise\nexhaustion as a defense, implying that it had waived recourse to such an\nargument. However, subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived. See,\ne.g., Okereke v. United States, 307 F.3d 117, 120 n.1 (3d Cir. 2002).\n4. The prior codification of \u00a7 1252(d) was INA \u00a7 106(c), 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1105a(c) (1994), which was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform\nand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub. L. 104-208,\nDiv. C. Title III, \u00a7 306(b), 110 Stat. 3009-612. Similar to \u00a7 1252(d),\n\u00a7 1105a(c) provided, in pertinent part, that \u201can order of deportation or of\nexclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has not\nexhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of right under\nthe immigration laws and regulations.\u201d INA \u00a7 106(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c).\n\f                                    6\n\n\n  Section 1105a(c) states the               same     requirements       in\nessentially the same language:\n     (c) Exhaustion of administrative remedies . . . .\n     An order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be\n     reviewed by any court if the alien has not exhausted\n     the administrative remedies available to him as of right\n     . . . . Every petition for review or for habeas corpus\n     shall state whether the validity of the order has been\n     upheld . . . .\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c) (repealed 1996) (emphasis supplied).5\n\n5. We are aware that the current \u00a7 1252(d)(1) does not mention habeas\ncorpus whereas its predecessor, \u00a7 1105a(c), does. The question as to\nwhether there is a distinction as to \u201creview\u201d (a direct appeal from the\nBIA) versus a habeas corpus petition, was addressed in INS v. St. Cyr,\n533 U.S. 289 (2001). In St. Cyr, the issue before the Supreme Court was\nwhether certain jurisdiction-stripping provisions of the INA (8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(1), 1252(a)(2)(C), and 1252(b)(9) (1994 ed., Supp. V)) removed\nentirely from federal courts the jurisdiction to hear habeas cases\ninvolving certain types of immigration orders, where direct appeals to the\nfederal courts had been removed. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 310-11. The\nSupreme Court held that these provisions did not bar habeas review\nbecause such a construction would \u201cinvoke[ ] the outer limits of\nCongress\u2019 power,\u201d and thus \u201cwould raise serious constitutional\nproblems,\u201d id. at 299-300, and thereby should not be adopted without \u201ca\nclear statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas jurisdiction.\u201d Id.\nat 298. As a basis for this conclusion, the Supreme Court reasoned that\nreferences in the statutory provisions at issue to \u201cjudicial review\u201d or\n\u201creview\u201d should not be read to foreclose habeas corpus review because\n\u201c[i]n the immigration context, \u2018judicial review\u2019 and \u2018habeas corpus\u2019 have\nhistorically distinct meanings.\u201d Id. at 311-12 (citation omitted).\n  Since St. Cyr, the question as to whether there is a distinction between\n\u201creview\u201d (direct appeal from the BIA) as distinct from a habeas corpus\npetition, in the context of \u00a7 1252(d)(1) in particular, has been addressed\nin Sundar v. INS, 328 F.3d 1320, 1324-25 (11th Cir. 2003) (no\ndistinction) and Beharry v. Ashcroft, 329 F.3d 51, 59-63 (2d Cir. 2003)\n(not decided). The Eleventh Circuit distinguished St. Cyr, which Sundar\nraised in support of his argument. Relying on St. Cyr, Sundar argued\nthat \u201creview\u201d in \u00a7 1252(d)\u2014\u201cA court may review a final order of removal\nonly if \u201d\u2014applies only to direct review proceedings in the courts of\nappeals and not to habeas proceedings. Sundar, 328 F.3d at 1324\n(emphasis supplied). The Eleventh Circuit distinguished St. Cyr\u2019s parsing\n\f                                    7\n\n\n   Because both statutes in their \u201creview\u201d clauses are\nvirtually identical and because 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c) was the\nsubject of our Massieu opinion, we find Massieu\u2019s analysis\nand discussion instructive and controlling here. We held in\nMassieu that the exhaustion requirement of \u00a7 1105a(c) was\nstatutory and thus jurisdictional, thereby barring a petition\nfor habeas corpus in the district court where there was no\nfinal order and no exhaustion of administrative remedies.\nWe also held that Massieu\u2019s claim\u2014that the provision of the\nINA under which he was deportable was unconstitutional\u2014\ndid not provide an exception to the jurisdictional\nrequirements of \u00a71105a(c) because such a claim was not\ncollateral to his deportability and because he could receive\nmeaningful review of his claims in this court after final\nadministrative action. Massieu, 91 F.3d at 426.\n  In Massieu, we acknowledged that the immigration courts\nare not authorized to consider the constitutionality of their\nown governing statute, but we were persuaded by the fact\nthat exhaustion could well resolve any controverted matter\nwithout the need for involvement by the federal courts. We\nalso relied on the fact that we could consider any\nconstitutional   challenge   upon    completion     of    the\nadministrative proceedings. We allowed that there was one\n\nof the meaning of \u201creview\u201d as being limited to the context of the\njurisdiction-stripping provisions of the IIRIRA amendments. Id. at 1324-\n25. The Eleventh Circuit pointed out the obvious contrast of the\njurisdiction-stripping provisions at issue in St. Cyr with \u00a7 1252(d), which\ndoes not completely preclude jurisdiction, but rather limits habeas\njurisdiction to aliens who have exhausted their administrative remedies,\nand thus, not implicating a constitutional question. Id. at 1324 (\u201cThe\ndifference is that between a reasonable condition precedent and an\nunconditional preclusion.\u201d).\n  We need not discuss in more detail that issue in this case as Duvall\nhas not raised it nor relied upon it. It suffices for us to say that the\nrequisites of \u00a7 1252(d)(1) do indeed apply to petitions for habeas corpus,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the statute does not specifically reference\nhabeas corpus. To read the statute otherwise would defeat the statute\u2019s\npurpose in seeking to streamline the administrative process and in\npreventing delay by premature and unnecessary recourse to a federal\ncourt. See Massieu, 91 F.3d at 421-22.\n\f                                      8\n\n\nexception to our jurisdictional holding. That exception\ninvolved an issue \u201centirely collateral\u201d to the merits, id. at\n422-24, an exception that has no relevance to Duvall\u2019s\npetition.\n   Based on our detailed analysis in Massieu, including\nconsideration of Congress\u2019s stated purpose, the statute\u2019s\nlegislative history and the overall structure of the\nadministrative process (with due consideration given to a\npetitioner\u2019s securing meaningful review of his claims after\nexhaustion), see id. at 420, we held that the District Court\nlacked jurisdiction to entertain Massieu\u2019s petition in that\nMassieu had failed to obtain a final order of removal and\nhad failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Id. at 426.\nWhile Massieu, as we have recited, was concerned with\n\u00a7 1105a(c), whereas here we are concerned with its\nsuccessor, \u00a7 1252(d)(1), the identity of the two statutes\ncompels us to conclude that \u00a7 1252(d)(1) also requires\nexhaustion as a prerequisite for federal jurisdiction.6 In this\nconnection, although Massieu did not dwell on the \u201cfinal\norder\u201d element of the statute, we also conclude that a final\norder of removal is a requisite for jurisdiction.\nParenthetically, we note that neither in Massieu, nor in the\npresent case involving the petitioner Duvall, was there a\nfinal order of removal. Indeed, Duvall acknowledges in her\nbrief to this court that \u201c. . . no final order of removal has\never been issued in Ms. Duvall\u2019s case.\u201d\n   As we have recognized, our reading of the two statutes,\n\u00a7 1252(d)(1) and \u00a7 1105a(c), satisfies us that they are so\n\n6. Indeed, the legislative history of Section 306 of IIRIRA, which gave rise\nto 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), although scant, says as much. The legislative\nhistory that does exist strongly suggests that the purpose of the two\nprovisions is one and the same. Indeed, the House\u2019s conference report\nstates that the recodification was a \u201crestate[ment of] the current\nprovisions in the first . . . sentence[ ] of subsection (c) of current section\n106 requiring that a petitioner have exhausted administrative remedies.\u201d\nH.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-828, at 220 (1996); see also id. at 219 (\u201cThis\nsection [306] amends INA section 242 to revise and restate the\nprovisions in current section 106, which is repealed.\u201d).\n\f                                   9\n\n\nsimilar that Massieu\u2019s analysis and holding govern the\nresult we reach here.7\n  Our conclusion that \u00a7 1252(d)(1) jurisdictionally bars\nDuvall\u2019s petition finds support in the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s\nSundar opinion. See Sundar v. INS, 328 F.3d 1320 (11th\nCir. 2003). In Sundar, the petitioner, whose removal had\nbeen ordered, claimed that administrative exhaustion does\nnot apply in habeas proceedings\u2014an argument rejected by\nthe Eleventh Circuit. Sundar, 328 F.3d at 1324-25; see also\nsupra note 5. The interpretation of \u00a7 1252(d)(1) and the\nEleventh Circuit\u2019s analysis of Sundar\u2019s unexhausted claims\nbolster our holding that jurisdiction is lacking over Duvall\u2019s\npetition. As Sundar and Massieu recognize, \u201c[E]xhaustion\nserves the twin purposes of protecting administrative\nagency authority and promoting judicial efficiency . . . .\u201d\nSundar, 328 F.3d at 1323 (citation omitted).\n   In the present case, when the BIA rejected Duvall\u2019s claim\nof collateral estoppel and remanded for a hearing before the\nIJ, Duvall, in order to exhaust administrative remedies, was\nobliged to return to the IJ. At that point, the IJ could have\ndealt with her two most recent convictions in 1995 and\n2000, as well as with the issue of her alienage, which she\nadmitted in March 2001. Duvall could have then appealed\nthe IJ\u2019s order (if adverse to her) to the BIA. Once the BIA\nhad issued a final order of removal, if it did, Duvall could\nhave sought to challenge such a final order of removal in\ndistrict court.\n\n7. In a F.R.A.P. 28(j) letter sent subsequent to oral argument, Duvall\ncontends that Massieu is distinguishable. She points out that Massieu\nsought to bypass completely the statutorily prescribed procedures for\nadministrative and judicial review by commencing an action in district\ncourt, without even engaging in hearings by an IJ, nor did Massieu\nappeal a decision by the IJ to the BIA.\n  Duvall claims that she, on the other hand, has exhausted the\nadministrative proceedings before the IJ and BIA with respect to the\ndeterminative issue of collateral estoppel. We do not agree. An order\nrespecting the collateral estoppel issue did issue from the BIA but as we\nhave recognized and as Duvall herself recognizes, no \u201cfinal order of\nremoval\u201d has ever issued and as we discuss in text, Duvall has failed to\nexhaust administrative remedies.\n\f                              10\n\n\n  Her failure to follow this procedure was fatal to the\nDistrict Court\u2019s jurisdiction over her habeas petition.\n   First, Duvall claims that she is not seeking a review of a\n\u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d It is obvious that she cannot\nbecause, as she admits and as we have noted, no such final\norder has ever been issued. Duvall claims further that she\nis only seeking to review her detention by the Service\u2014a\ndetention from which she has been released. Yet, this\ndeliberate phrasing of her claim, when she is really\nchallenging the collateral estoppel ruling, cannot escape the\njurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 1252(d)(1).\n   A \u201cfinal order,\u201d as the Government points out, has long\nbeen understood \u201c \u2018to include[ ] all matters on which the\nvalidity of the final order is contingent.\u2019 \u201d INS v. Chadha,\n462 U.S. 919, 938 (1983) (citation omitted) (interpreting\n\u00a7 1105a). Thus, as this court explained in Massieu, \u201ceven\nwhen an alien is attempting to prevent . . . deportation\nproceeding[s] from taking place in the first instance and is\nthus not, strictly speaking, attacking a final order of\ndeportation . . . , it is well settled that \u2018judicial review is\nprecluded if the alien has failed to avail himself of all\nadministrative remedies,\u2019 one of which is the deportation\n. . . hearing itself.\u201d Massieu, 91 F.3d at 421 (citations\nomitted). It is significant to us as well that Duvall does not\neven focus on \u201cdetention\u201d as the central point of her appeal.\nRather, her brief, her argument and her analysis deal solely\nwith the issue of collateral estoppel.\n   Duvall also asserts that the Government waived any\nexhaustion requirement because it failed to argue that\nissue before the District Court. Earlier in this opinion, see\nsupra note 3, we have adverted to the District Court\u2019s\nopinion, which implied that this defense was waived. Just\nas we have held that the District Court erred, so do we\nreject Duvall\u2019s argument of waiver. Subject matter\njurisdiction is always available at all judicial stages of\nreview for our examination.\n  Lastly, Duvall claims that it would be futile to exhaust\nher administrative remedies, referring to the doctrine that\nwhere exhaustion is not clearly mandated by statute, a\nfutility exception exists. In particular, she urges that\n\f                             11\n\n\nfurther administrative proceedings would be futile where\nthe BIA has already definitively decided that collateral\nestoppel does not bar relitigation of whether she is an\n\u201calien\u201d and there is no change in the facts or case law to\nsuggest that the BIA would change its conclusion.\n   We cannot agree. It is clear that we have rejected such an\nexception where the statute involved, such as \u00a7 1252(d)(1),\nrequires exhaustion as a matter of jurisdiction. See Nyhuis\nv. Reno, 204 F.3d 65, 69 (3d Cir. 2000) (a statute with \u201ca\njurisdictional requirement, . . . by definition cannot be\nsubject to a futility exception.\u201d); see also Massieu, 91 F.3d\nat 424-25.\n\n                             IV.\n  We have held that the District Court had no jurisdiction\nto entertain Duvall\u2019s petition. Duvall, as we have taken\npains to point out, and as she has admitted, was not issued\na final order of removal and has not exhausted\nadministrative remedies which Congress, through its\nenactment of \u00a7 1252(d)(1), required before a district court\ncan acquire jurisdiction.\n   Hence, the District Court should have dismissed Duvall\u2019s\npetition without reaching the merits, i.e., the collateral\nestoppel issue advanced by Duvall. See Steel Co. v. Citizens\nfor a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998) (\u201cWithout\njurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.\nJurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases\nto exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of\nannouncing the fact and dismissing the cause.\u201d) (internal\nquotations and citation omitted); Firestone Tire & Rubber\nCo. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 379 (1981) (\u201cA court lacks\ndiscretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is\nwithout jurisdiction . . . .\u201d). Just as the District Court\nshould not have considered the merits because it had no\njurisdiction to do so, no more will we.\n  We will vacate the judgment of the District Court and\nremand to that court with a direction to dismiss Duvall\u2019s\npetition for want of jurisdiction.\n\f                            12\n\n\nA True Copy:\n        Teste:\n\n                 Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n                             for the Third Circuit\n\f\f",
