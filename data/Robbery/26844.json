We affirm.\n\n      The PCRA court summarized the relevant facts and procedural history\n\nas follows:\n\n      On July 15, 2014, at approximately 8:49 p.m., police were\n      dispatched for a robbery which had just occurred at the Vitamin\n      Store located [in] Chester County, [Pennsylvania]. The police\n      investigation revealed that [Appellant] conspired with two [] other\n      individuals, Shaquille Jackson and Daniel Pittman, to rob the\n      Vitamin Store.\n\n      The three [] actors entered the shop with the intent to commit\n      robbery. Daniel Pittman, a former employee at the store, moved\n      to the back of the store while Shaquille Jackson along with\n      [Appellant] walked up to the cash register where store employees\n      [] were working. Shaquille Jackson stated that he had a gun and\n      demanded all of the money from the cash registers and safe.\n      [Appellant] then ordered [a store employee] onto his knees and\n      told him to put his hands behind his head. [Appellant] told [the\n\fJ-S53014-19\n\n\n       store employee] that if he moved, he would be shot. Both store\n       employees believed they would be killed if they did not do as they\n       were told.\n\n       Once the money was obtained, Shaquille Jackson ordered the\n       employees to stand up and face the wall and count to [50] before\n       calling police. Shaquille Jackson then stated again that the store\n       employees would be shot if they moved.           Both employees\n       complied with the order in fear that they would be killed. In total,\n       [Appellant], Shaquille Jackson, and Daniel Pittman absconded\n       from the store with $1,344.00[.]\n\nPCRA Court Opinion, 3/6/19, at 3-4.\n\n       On April 8, 2016, Appellant pled guilty to one count of robbery and one\n\ncount of criminal conspiracy.        Id. at 1.   On the same day, the trial court\n\nimposed an aggregate sentence of three to six years\u2019 incarceration for both\n\ncharges. Id. at 1-2. Appellant \u201cdid not file any post-sentence motions or a\n\ndirect appeal.\u201d Id.\n\n       On July 17, 2018,1 Appellant filed a pro se motion for time credit.\n\nAppellant\u2019s PCRA Petition, 7/17/18, at 1-3. The PCRA court properly treated\n\nAppellant\u2019s motion as a PCRA petition.2 PCRA Court Opinion, 3/6/19, at 2.\n\nBecause this was Appellant\u2019s first PCRA petition, the PCRA court appointed\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1Appellant\u2019s petition is docketed on two different days: July 17, 2018 and July\n20, 2018. See Appellant\u2019s PCRA Petition, 7/17/18, at 1-3. The PCRA court\ndetermined that Appellant\u2019s petition was filed on July 20, 2018. PCRA Court\nOpinion, 3/6/19, at 7. For purposes of appeal, however, we shall assume that\nAppellant\u2019s petition was filed on July 17, 2018.\n\n2 The PCRA provides \u201cthe sole means of obtaining collateral relief.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.\n\u00a7 9542. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 803 A.2d 1291, 1293 (Pa. Super.\n2002) (\u201c[T]he PCRA provides the sole means for obtaining collateral review,\nand ... any petition filed after the judgment of sentence becomes final will be\ntreated as a PCRA petition\u201d).\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S53014-19\n\n\n\ncounsel to review the matter.            See PCRA Court Order, 7/27/18, at 1.\n\nSubsequently, on September 27, 2018, court-appointed counsel filed a motion\n\nto withdraw as counsel and a no-merit letter pursuant to Commonwealth v.\n\nTurner, 544 A.2d 927 (Pa. 1988) and Commonwealth v. Finley, 550 A.2d\n\n213 (Pa. Super. 1988) (en banc). On October 2, 2018, the PCRA court issued\n\nnotice that it intended to dismiss Appellant\u2019s PCRA petition in 20 days without\n\nholding a hearing in view of counsel\u2019s Turner/Finley letter. PCRA Court Rule\n\n907 Notice, 10/2/18, at 1; see also Pa.R.Crim.P. 907(1). Appellant failed to\n\nfile a response to either the Turner/Finely letter or the Rule 907 notice. The\n\nPCRA court dismissed Appellant\u2019s petition and granted counsel\u2019s leave to\n\nwithdraw on November 26, 2018. PCRA Court Order, 11/26/18, at 1. This\n\ntimely appeal followed.3\n\n       On appeal, Appellant argues that the PCRA court erred in denying him\n\nan evidentiary hearing.4 Appellant\u2019s Brief at 4. The PCRA court concluded\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3 Appellant filed a notice of appeal on December 19, 2018. On December 28,\n2018, the PCRA court entered an order directing Appellant to file a concise\nstatement of matters complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P.\n1925(b)(1). Appellant timely complied. The PCRA court issued an opinion\npursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) on March 6, 2019.\n\n4 On appeal, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying an\nevidentiary hearing because he raises \u201cseveral instances of ineffective\nassistance of counsel.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 8. Essentially, Appellant claims\nthat counsel gave him \u201cincorrect information\u201d which \u201cinduced [Appellant\u2019s]\nguilty plea.\u201d Id. at 9. Appellant, however, failed to raise counsel\u2019s alleged\nineffectiveness before the PCRA court. Indeed, Appellant made no mention of\nineffective assistance of counsel in his motion for time credit and, as noted\nabove, did not file a response to either the Turner/Finely letter or the Rule\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S53014-19\n\n\n\nthat it lacked jurisdiction to entertain Appellant\u2019s petition because the filing\n\nwas untimely.        PCRA Court Opinion, 3/6/19, at 1-9.       \u201cCrucial to the\n\ndetermination of any PCRA appeal is the timeliness of the underlying petition.\n\nThus, we [] first determine whether the instant PCRA petition was timely filed.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Smith, 35 A.3d 766, 768 (Pa. Super. 2011), appeal\n\ndenied, 53 A.3d 757 (Pa. 2012).\n\n       The timeliness requirement for PCRA petitions \u201cis mandatory and\n\njurisdictional in nature.\u201d Commonwealth v. Taylor, 67 A.3d 1245, 1248\n\n(Pa. 2013) (citation omitted). \u201cThe question of whether a petition is timely\n\nraises a question of law. Where the petitioner raises questions of law, our\n\nstandard of review is de novo and our scope of review plenary.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Hudson, 156 A.3d 1194, 1197 (Pa. Super. 2017), appeal\n\ndenied, 170 A.3d 1007 (Pa. 2017) (citation omitted).\n\n       A PCRA petition is timely if it is \u201cfiled within one year of the date the\n\njudgment [of sentence] becomes final.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 9545(b)(1). \u201c[A]\n\njudgment becomes final at the conclusion of direct review, including\n\ndiscretionary review in the Supreme Court of the United States and the\n\nSupreme Court of Pennsylvania, or at the expiration of time for seeking the\n\nreview.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 9545(b)(3). Here, because Appellant did not lodge\n\na direct appeal, his judgment of sentence became final on May 8, 2016, 30\n\ndays after the imposition of his sentence. Therefore, to be timely, Appellant\n____________________________________________\n\n\n907 notice. Thus, we conclude that Appellant waived this issue on appeal.\nPa.R.A.P. 302(a).\n\n                                           -4-\n\fJ-S53014-19\n\n\n\nneeded to file his PCRA petition on or before May 9, 2017. See 1 Pa.C.S.A.\n\n\u00a7 1908.   Appellant, however, filed the current petition on July 17, 2018;\n\nhence, his petition is manifestly untimely.      Therefore, unless one of the\n\nstatutory exceptions to the time-bar applies, no court may exercise\n\njurisdiction to consider this petition.\n\n      Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a79545(b), there are three statutory exceptions\n\nto the timeliness provision that allow for very limited circumstances under\n\nwhich the untimely filing of a PCRA petition will be excused. To invoke an\n\nexception, a petition must allege and prove one of the following:\n\n      (i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of\n      interference by government officials with the presentation of the\n      claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth\n      or the Constitution or laws of the United States;\n\n      (ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to\n      the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise\n      of due diligence; or\n\n      (iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was recognized\n      by the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme Court\n      of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in this section and\n      has been held by that court to apply retroactively.\n\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii). \u201cThe petitioner bears the burden to plead\n\nand prove an applicable statutory exception.\u201d Hudson, 156 A.3d at 1197.\n\n      In this instance, Appellant made no attempt to plead or prove that one\n\nof the above-mentioned exceptions to the PCRA time-bar applies. Indeed,\n\nAppellant\u2019s petition simply requested that his \u201cPennsylvania sentence [] be\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fJ-S53014-19\n\n\n\naggregated and run concurrent with his Delaware [s]entence.\u201d5 Appellant\u2019s\n\nPCRA Petition, 7/17/18, at 2. He does not even mention one of the exceptions\n\nlisted in 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9545(b). Id. Furthermore, Appellant did not file a\n\nresponse to the PCRA court\u2019s Rule 907 Notice or the Turner/Finely letter.\n\nThus, even if Appellant claimed that his petition met a statutory exception on\n\nappeal \u2013 which he did not \u2013 such a claim would be waived. See Pa.R.A.P.\n\n302(a) (\u201cIssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised\n\nfor the first time on appeal\u201d). As such, we conclude that the PCRA court did\n\nnot err in dismissing Appellant\u2019s PCRA petition without a hearing.\n\n       Order affirmed.\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D. Seletyn, Esq.\nProthonotary\n\n\n\nDate: 11/5/19\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n5 On appeal, Appellant suggests that the discovery of the non-concurrent\nnature of his Pennsylvania and Delaware sentences constitutes a\nnewly-discovered fact. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 11. This is meritless. First,\nbecause Appellant failed to raise this claim before the trial court, it is waived.\nPa.R.A.P. 302(a).     Second, the fact that the sentences were to run\nconsecutively was known to Appellant at the time of sentencing. N.T.\nSentencing Hearing, 4/8/16, at 19. Third, Appellant does not specify the date\nin which he \u201cdiscovered\u201d the sentences were not running concurrently. See\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 11. Thus, Appellant failed to satisfy the requirements of\nSection 9545 (b)(1)(ii).\n\n                                           -6-\n\f",
