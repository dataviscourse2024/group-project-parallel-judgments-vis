PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 29.02(a)(1) (West 2011). By one issue, Johnson argues\n\nthat the trial court erred in admitting testimony regarding his efforts to resist arrest\n\nbecause such testimony was irrelevant and inadmissible evidence of an extraneous\n\foffense or bad act. See TEX. R. EVID. 402, 403, 404(b). We affirm.\n\n                                           I. Background1\n\n        Johnson was indicted in connection with the robbery of a liquor store in Gonzales,\n\nTexas. See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 29.02(a)(1). He pleaded not guilty, and the case\n\nwas tried to a jury.\n\n        At trial, there was evidence that Johnson entered the liquor store during the early\n\nevening of January 23, 2012. Johnson tried to enter the area behind the cash register\n\ncounter, and the store clerk attempted to block his path. Johnson told the clerk \"this is a\n\nrobbery,\" pushed the clerk into a shelf, picked the cash register up off the counter, and\n\nfled the store on foot carrying the cash register. The clerk called the police, and when\n\nthey arrived, the clerk pointed in the direction in which Johnson had fled. The police\n\nlocated Johnson, with the cash register, in the backyard of a house near the liquor store.\n\nThe officers testified that Johnson resisted their attempts to arrest him. He struggled\n\nagainst the officers and would not allow them to handcuff him. The officers testified that\n\nthey were required to pepper spray and then use a taser on Johnson in order to subdue\n\nhim.\n\n        After the close of evidence, the jury returned a guilty verdict. Punishment was\n\ntried to the court, which assessed a sentence of life imprisonment as a result of multiple\n\nprior felonies committed by Johnson. See id. \u00a7 12.42 (West Supp. 2012). This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n\n        1\n          Because this is a memorandum opinion and the parties are familiar with the facts, we will not\nrecite them here except as necessary to advise the parties of the Court's decision and the basic reasons for\nit. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.4.\n                                                     2\n\f                                II. Standard of Review\n\n       We review a trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence under an abuse of\n\ndiscretion standard. Shuffield v. State, 189 S.W.3d 782, 793 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006)\n\n(citations omitted). \"If the trial court's decision was within the bounds of reasonable\n\ndisagreement, the appellate court should not disturb its ruling.\" Id.\n\n                                     III. Discussion\n\n       By one issue, Johnson argues that the officers' testimony about the details of his\n\narrest was both irrelevant and inadmissible extraneous bad acts evidence. See TEX. R.\n\nEVID. 401\u201303, 404(b). However, at trial, defense counsel objected only on the grounds\n\nof relevance, so Johnson's argument under rule 404(b) was not preserved for our review.\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a)(1). We will address only Johnson's argument under rules\n\n401, 402, and 403.\n\n       Rule 402 provides that \"[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise\n\nprovided by Constitution, by statute, by these rules, or by the other rules prescribed to\n\nstatutory authority. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\" TEX. R. EVID. 402.\n\n\"'Relevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of a\n\nfact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less\n\nprobable than it would be without the evidence.\" TEX. R. EVID. 401. Rule 403 provides\n\nthat, \"[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the\n\njury, or by considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative\n\nevidence.\" TEX. R. EVID. 403.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f      Johnson argues that \"[t]he elements of robbery do not include resisting arrest to\n\nthe point of being pepper sprayed or tased. This testimony was completely unnecessary\n\nand irrelevant to the offense of robbery.\" We disagree.\n\n      Texas law has long recognized that evidence of flight or escape may be\n      admissible evidence from which an inference of guilt may be drawn, subject\n      only to the requirement of relevancy to the offense under prosecution. See\n      Bigby v. State, 892 S.W.2d 864, 883 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994); Burks v. State,\n      876 S.W.2d 877, 903 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994); [Cantrell v. State, 731 S.W.2d\n      84, 92 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987)]; Foster v. State, 779 S.W.2d 845, 859 (Tex.\n      Crim. App. 1989); Rumbaugh v. State, 629 S.W.2d 747, 752 (Tex. Crim.\n      App. 1982); Lee v. State, 176 S.W.3d 452, 462 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st\n      Dist.] 2004), aff'd on other grounds, 206 S.W.3d 620 (Tex. Crim. App.\n      2006). . . . In addition, the State is generally \"'entitled to show\n      circumstances surrounding an arrest,'\" because evidence of these\n      circumstances, including the defendant's resistance, may also demonstrate\n      . . . how police located, pursued, and apprehended the defendant. Cantrell,\n      731 S.W.2d at 92 (quoting Maddox v. State, 682 S.W.2d 563, 564 (Tex.\n      Crim. App. 1985)).\n\nBurks v. State, 227 S.W.3d 138, 148 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, pet. ref'd).\n\nHere, the complained-of testimony was admissible as evidence of the circumstances\n\nsurrounding Johnson's arrest. It was evidence relevant to Johnson's flight from the\n\nscene, which was a circumstance indicative of guilt. The testimony encompassed only a\n\nfew pages of the multiple-volume reporter's record of a two-day trial and was not\n\nparticularly emphasized by the State. In short, having reviewed the testimony in the\n\ncontext of the record, we conclude that its probative value was not outweighed by any\n\ndanger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, or\n\nneedless presentation of cumulative evidence. The trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin admitting the testimony. Johnson's issue is overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f                                    IV. Conclusion\n\n       We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                                     NELDA V.
