Howell, Jr., appellant.\n                                                      ___ N.W.2d ___\n\n                                          Filed February 5, 2019.    No. A-17-1186.\n\n               \u20021.\t Constitutional Law: Search and Seizure: Motions to Suppress:\n                    Appeal and Error. In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to\n                    suppress based on a claimed violation of the Fourth Amendment, an\n                    appellate court applies a two-part standard of review. Regarding histori-\n                    cal facts, an appellate court reviews the trial court\u2019s findings for clear\n                    error. But whether those facts trigger or violate Fourth Amendment\n                    protections is a question of law that an appellate court reviews indepen-\n                    dently of the trial court\u2019s determination.\n               \u20022.\t Warrantless Searches. The warrantless search exceptions recognized by\n                    the Nebraska Supreme Court include: (1) searches undertaken with con-\n                    sent, (2) searches under exigent circumstances, (3) inventory searches,\n                    (4) searches of evidence in plain view, and (5) searches incident to a\n                    valid arrest.\n               \u20023.\t Constitutional Law: Search and Seizure: Duress. To be effective\n                    under the Fourth Amendment, consent to a search must be a free and\n                    unconstrained choice not the product of a will overborne. Consent must\n                    be given voluntarily and not as the result of duress or coercion, whether\n                    express, implied, physical, or psychological.\n               \u20024.\t Search and Seizure. The determination of whether a consent to a search\n                    is voluntarily given is a question of fact to be determined from the total-\n                    ity of the circumstances.\n               \u20025.\t Motions to Suppress: Appeal and Error. In determining the correct-\n                    ness of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a suppression motion, an appellate court\n                    will accept the factual determinations and credibility choices made by\n                    the trial court unless, in light of all the circumstances, such findings are\n                    clearly erroneous.\n               \u20026.\t Rules of Evidence: Hearsay: Appeal and Error. Apart from rulings\n                    under the residual hearsay exception, an appellate court reviews for\n                    clear error the factual findings underpinning a trial court\u2019s hearsay\n\f                                     - 843 -\n            Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n                 26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                              STATE v. HOWELL\n                            Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\n     ruling and reviews de novo the court\u2019s ultimate determination to admit\n     evidence over a hearsay objection.\n\u20027.\t Evidence: Appeal and Error. Error can be based on a ruling that\n     admits evidence only if the specific ground of objection is apparent\n     either from a timely objection or from the context.\n\u20028.\t Trial: Pretrial Procedure: Evidence: Appeal and Error. When a\n     motion in limine to exclude evidence is overruled, the movant must\n     object when the particular evidence which was sought to be excluded by\n     the motion is offered during trial to preserve error for appeal.\n\u20029.\t Hearsay. If an out-of-court statement is not offered for the purpose of\n     proving the truth of the facts asserted, it is not hearsay.\n10.\t Trial: Hearsay: Proof. When overruling a hearsay objection on the\n     ground that testimony about an out-of-court statement is received not\n     for its truth but only to prove that the statement was made, a trial court\n     should identify the specific nonhearsay purpose for which the making of\n     the statement is relevant and probative.\n11.\t Trial: Evidence: Appeal and Error. Erroneous admission of evidence\n     is harmless error and does not require reversal if the evidence is cumula-\n     tive and other relevant evidence, properly admitted, supports the finding\n     by the trier of fact.\n12.\t Verdicts: Juries: Appeal and Error. Harmless error review looks to\n     the basis on which the jury actually rested its verdict. The inquiry is\n     not whether in a trial that occurred without the error, a guilty verdict\n     would surely have been rendered, but whether the actual guilty verdict\n     rendered was surely unattributable to the error.\n13.\t Motions for Mistrial: Appeal and Error. Whether to grant a mistrial is\n     within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and an appellate court will not disturb\n     its ruling unless the court abused its discretion.\n14.\t Rules of Evidence. In proceedings where the Nebraska Evidence Rules\n     apply, the admissibility of evidence is controlled by the Nebraska\n     Evidence Rules; judicial discretion is involved only when the rules make\n     discretion a factor in determining admissibility.\n15.\t Rules of Evidence: Appeal and Error. Where the Nebraska Evidence\n     Rules commit the evidentiary question at issue to the discretion of the\n     trial court, an appellate court reviews the admissibility of evidence for\n     an abuse of discretion.\n16.\t Trial: Waiver. A party who fails to insist upon a ruling to a proffered\n     objection waives that objection.\n17.\t Criminal Law: Witnesses: Testimony: Rules of Evidence. When a\n     defendant in a criminal case testifies in his own behalf, he is subject to\n     the same rules of cross-examination as any other witness, including Neb.\n     Evid. R. 609, Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 27-609 (Reissue 2016).\n\f                                     - 844 -\n            Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n                 26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                              STATE v.

Stat. \u00a7 27-609 (Reissue\n     2016), is to allow the prosecution to attack the credibility of a testifying\n     defendant, not to retry him for a separate crime or prejudice the jury by\n     allowing unlimited access to the facts of an unrelated crime.\n19.\t Rules of Evidence: Other Acts. Neb. Evid. R. 404(2), Neb. Rev. Stat.\n     \u00a7 27-404(2) (Reissue 2016), does not apply to evidence of a defendant\u2019s\n     other crimes or bad acts if the evidence is inextricably intertwined with\n     the charged crime.\n20.\t ____: ____. Inextricably intertwined evidence includes evidence that\n     forms part of the factual setting of the crime, or evidence that is so\n     blended or connected to the charged crime that proof of the charged\n     crime will necessarily require proof of the other crimes or bad acts, or if\n     the other crimes or bad acts are necessary for the prosecution to present\n     a coherent picture of the charged crime.\n21.\t Other Acts. The State will not be prohibited from presenting a por-\n     tion of its case merely because the actions of the defendant proving the\n     State\u2019s case were criminal in nature.\n22.\t Jury Instructions: Judgments: Appeal and Error. Whether a jury\n     instruction given by a trial court is correct is a question of law. When\n     reviewing questions of law, an appellate court has an obligation to\n     resolve the questions independently of the conclusion reached by the\n     trial court.\n23.\t Jury Instructions: Proof: Appeal and Error. To establish reversible\n     error from a court\u2019s failure to give a requested jury instruction, an appel-\n     lant has the burden to show that (1) the tendered instruction is a correct\n     statement of the law, (2) the tendered instruction was warranted by the\n     evidence, and (3) the appellant was prejudiced by the court\u2019s failure to\n     give the requested instruction.\n24.\t Appeal and Error. For an alleged error to be considered by an appel-\n     late court, an appellant must both assign and specifically argue the\n     alleged error.\n25.\t ____. An argument that does little more than restate an assignment\n     of error does not support the assignment, and an appellate court will\n     not address it.\n26.\t Criminal Law: Motions for New Trial: Appeal and Error. In a crimi-\n     nal case, a motion for new trial is addressed to the discretion of the trial\n     court, and unless an abuse of discretion is shown, the trial court\u2019s deter-\n     mination will not be disturbed.\n\n  Appeal from the District Court for Lancaster County: Robert\nR.

Howell, Jr., was convicted by a jury of theft by\nunlawful taking. The district court subsequently sentenced him\nto 20 months\u2019 imprisonment and 12 months\u2019 postrelease super-\nvision. Howell appeals from his conviction. On appeal, Howell\nassigns numerous errors, including that the district court erred\nin overruling his motion to suppress evidence obtained as a\nresult of a warrantless search, in admitting hearsay into evi-\ndence, in denying his motions for mistrial made during the\nState\u2019s opening statement and closing argument, in not permit-\nting him to explain the nature of his prior felony conviction, in\nadmitting into evidence details about uncharged offenses, and\nin failing to properly instruct the jury.\n   Upon our review, we find no merit to Howell\u2019s assertions\non appeal. Accordingly, we affirm his conviction for theft by\nunlawful taking.\n                     II. BACKGROUND\n   On December 2, 2016, the State filed an information charg-\ning Howell with three separate counts of theft by unlawful\ntaking, pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-511 (Reissue 2016).\nThe first count, a Class IV felony, alleged that Howell had\nexercised control over movable property of another, which\nproperty was valued at more than $1,500, but less than $5,000.\nSee Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-518(2) (Reissue 2016). The second\ncount, a Class II misdemeanor, alleged that Howell had exer-\ncised control over movable property of another, a bicycle,\nwhich property was valued at less than $500. See \u00a7 28-518(4).\nThe third count, a Class I misdemeanor, alleged that Howell\n\f                              - 846 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                        STATE v. HOWELL\n                      Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\nhad exercised control over movable property of another, a\nsecond bicycle, which property was valued at more than $500,\nbut less than $1,500. See \u00a7 28-518(3). Prior to trial, the second\nand third counts alleged in the information were dismissed\nbecause the district court granted Howell\u2019s motion for absolute\ndischarge on speedy trial grounds.\n   The remaining charge against Howell stems from events\nwhich occurred in August and September 2016. Evidence\nadduced at trial revealed that on August 16, 2016, Shawn\nFleischman discovered that his 2009 black Kawasaki Ninja\n250R motorcycle had been stolen from in front of his residence\nnear 42d and Adams Streets in Lincoln, Nebraska. Fleischman\nreported the theft to the Lincoln Police Department. He\ninformed the officer who took the theft report that the motor-\ncycle was valued at $2,500. Fleischman testified similarly\nat trial.\n   Approximately 1 month later, on September 23, 2016, Officer\nAnthony Gratz, who at the time was an officer with the Lincoln\nPolice Department, was investigating a string of motorcycle\nthefts which had been occurring in Lincoln. As a part of Gratz\u2019\ninvestigation, he spoke with a confidential informant who had\nknowledge about the motorcycle which had been stolen from\nFleischman. Specifically, the confidential informant told Gratz\nthat Howell had taken a motorcycle from the area of 42d and\nAdams Streets in Lincoln to \u201ca garage on North 27th Street,\ndirectly across from the Salvation Army.\u201d The confidential\ninformant also told Gratz that Howell had \u201ccut that motorcycle\ninto pieces.\u201d Through further investigation, Gratz learned that\nthe confidential informant was referring to a residence with a\ndetached garage located on North 27th Street. Gratz learned\nfrom other officers that Howell \u201cfrequent[ed]\u201d the area near\nthat residence.\n   Just after midnight on September 24, 2016, Gratz drove\nby the residence on North 27th Street. When he drove by,\nhe observed a black motorcycle parked in the driveway. The\nmotorcycle appeared to have been painted \u201cwith a thick bed\n\f                              - 847 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                        STATE v. HOWELL\n                      Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\nliner.\u201d Gratz indicated that in his experience, that type of\npaint is \u201cvery common\u201d on stolen motorcycles. Gratz sus-\npected that the motorcycle parked in the driveway might be\nFleischman\u2019s stolen motorcycle. Gratz waited for another uni-\nformed officer to arrive and then approached the front door\nof the residence. Gratz knocked on the front door, but nobody\nanswered. Gratz observed someone, who he believed to be\nHowell, walking through the living room of the residence.\nSoon, Howell appeared in the driveway from the back yard\nof the residence.\n   When talking with the officers, Howell indicated that the\nblack motorcycle in the driveway was his. He told Gratz that\nhe had purchased the motorcycle about a year ago. When\nGratz pointed out that the motorcycle still had a \u201cdealer\nstyle in-transit\u201d on the back of it, Howell indicated that he\nhad actually purchased the motorcycle within the past year.\nHowell was unable to provide Gratz with any specific infor-\nmation about where he purchased the motorcycle or provide\nany paperwork to demonstrate his ownership. Howell simply\nindicated that he had purchased the motorcycle from someone\nin Colorado.\n   Ultimately, Gratz determined that the motorcycle in the\ndriveway was not Fleischman\u2019s stolen motorcycle because it\nwas a 1989 model, rather than a 2009 model like Fleischman\u2019s\nmotorcycle. However, Gratz continued to speak with Howell\nabout the possibility of the stolen motorcycle being in the\ndetached garage. Howell immediately told Gratz that there was\nnot a stolen motorcycle in the garage. And, although Howell\nhad been calm throughout the conversation with Gratz, when\nGratz told Howell that he \u201chad very specific information that\nthe motorcycle . . . was currently in the garage [and] had been\ncut into pieces,\u201d Howell began to breathe heavily and pace.\nHowell admitted to Gratz that he did have property in the\ngarage, including another motorcycle and a large quantity of\ntools. He then indicated that if there was a stolen motorcycle\nin the garage, he did not know anything about it.\n\f                              - 848 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                        STATE v. HOWELL\n                      Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\n   At some point during the conversation, Howell offered to\ngo into the garage himself to see if the stolen motorcycle was\nthere. Howell paused for a while before entering the garage\nand then changed his mind. He told Gratz that he was con-\ncerned that if he turned over the stolen motorcycle, Gratz\nwould arrest him. Howell then asked if he was free to leave.\nWhen Gratz answered affirmatively, Howell went inside the\nresidence through the front door. While Gratz was still stand-\ning in the driveway, he observed Howell exit the rear of the\nresidence and slowly walk over to the side door of the garage.\nGratz informed Howell that he did not want Howell to enter\nthe garage and try to remove or destroy evidence. Howell then\nleft the residence on foot.\n   Police officers eventually searched the garage. Inside the\ngarage, they found Fleischman\u2019s stolen motorcycle broken\ndown into pieces and parts. In addition, they found two bicy-\ncles that had been reported as stolen. Gratz testified that he\nsmelled \u201ca very strong odor of what I would describe as . . .\nvehicle paint\u201d in the garage.\n   Howell testified in his own defense. During his testimony,\nhe contradicted much of Gratz\u2019 testimony about their conver-\nsation. Specifically, Howell testified that he told Gratz \u201cno\u201d\nwhen Gratz asked to look in the garage. Howell testified that\nhe \u201cwasn\u2019t the only one that had access to the garage[,] nor\nis it even technically [his] residence.\u201d Howell explained that\nalthough he had stayed at the residence \u201cregularly\u201d in the\nmonths leading up to September 24, 2016, his friends were the\nonly two people on the lease. Howell admitted that he had been\nin the garage prior to September 24. In addition, he admitted\nthat he had a key to the garage. However, contrary to Gratz\u2019\ntestimony, Howell indicated that the only two things he knew to\nbe in the garage were a Honda motorcycle and tools. He denied\nthat either one of these belonged to him. Howell also denied\nattempting to enter the garage after speaking with Gratz.\n   After hearing all of the evidence, the jury convicted Howell\nof theft by unlawful taking. It also found that the value of the\n\f                               - 849 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                         STATE v. HOWELL\n                       Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\nstolen motorcycle was $2,000. The district court subsequently\nsentenced Howell to 20 months\u2019 imprisonment, 12 months\u2019\npostrelease supervision, and a $1,000 fine.\n   Howell appeals his conviction here.\n                III. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   On appeal, Howell assigns eight errors. Howell asserts that\nthe district court erred in (1) denying his motion to suppress\nevidence obtained during the warrantless search of the garage,\n(2) admitting into evidence out-of-court statements made by\nthe confidential informant and by police officers who did not\ntestify, (3) denying his motions for mistrial which were made\nduring the State\u2019s opening statement and closing argument, (4)\nallowing a police officer to testify about the value of the stolen\nmotorcycle, (5) not permitting Howell to testify regarding the\nnature of his prior felony conviction, (6) admitting into evi-\ndence details about two stolen bicycles which were also located\nin the garage, (7) failing to properly instruct the jury, and (8)\ndenying his motion for a new trial.\n                          IV. ANALYSIS\n                       1. Motion to Suppress\n                      (a) Standard of Review\n   [1] In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to sup-\npress based on a claimed violation of the Fourth Amendment,\nwe apply a two-part standard of review. State v. Wells, 290\nNeb. 186, 859 N.W.2d 316 (2015). Regarding historical facts,\nwe review the trial court\u2019s findings for clear error. Id. But\nwhether those facts trigger or violate Fourth Amendment pro-\ntections is a question of law that we review independently of\nthe trial court\u2019s determination. Id.\n                   (b) Additional Background\n   Prior to trial, Howell filed a motion to suppress the evi-\ndence obtained during the warrantless search of the detached\ngarage.

The State called Gratz to testify that Mayr\u2019s and\nVocasek\u2019s consent to search was, in fact, voluntarily given.\n   Gratz testified that after Howell left the residence, he decided\nto speak with the residents, Mayr and his girlfriend, Vocasek.\nBoth Mayr and Vocasek came onto the front porch to speak\nwith Gratz. During the conversation, both Mayr and Vocasek\nindicated that they had access to the detached garage and so\ndid Howell. They explained that Howell paid them rent so that\nhe could store property in the garage. Mayr indicated that only\nhe and Howell had keys to the garage. He also indicated that\nhe was unsure about where his garage key was located. When\npolice indicated that it was possible to pick the lock of the\ngarage without damaging anything, both Mayr and Vocasek\nexpressed discomfort about police entering the garage without\na key.\n   Ultimately, Gratz left the residence so that he could work\non obtaining a search warrant. While Gratz was drafting his\naffidavit in support of a search warrant, he was informed\nthat Mayr and Vocasek had located Mayr\u2019s key to the garage\nand that they had consented to the search by each sign-\ning a form labeled \u201cConsent to Search Premises Without\na Search Warrant.\u201d Gratz estimated that police entered the\ngarage approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour after Howell had\nleft the residence.\n   During his testimony at the motion to suppress hearing,\nGratz explicitly denied that he ever threatened to arrest either\nMayr or Vocasek if they did not consent to a search of the\ngarage. He also denied that either Mayr or Vocasek expressed a\ndesire to leave the residence.\n   Officer Quenton Smith also testified at the suppression\nhearing and generally corroborated Gratz\u2019 account of his inter-\naction with Mayr and Vocasek. Smith testified that Mayr and\n\f                               - 851 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                         STATE v.

In addition, they stated that they did\nnot want officers to damage the garage by attempting to gain\naccess without a key. Smith stayed behind to secure the garage\nwhile Gratz left to work on obtaining a search warrant. Smith\ntestified that while he was waiting, Mayr and Vocasek indi-\ncated that they had found the key and were willing to consent\nto the search.\n   Smith testified that no promises or threats were made to\neither Mayr or Vocasek in order to gain their consent to the\nsearch. Specifically, no one threatened to arrest either of them\nif they did not sign the consent form. Smith described Mayr\nand Vocasek as acting \u201cnormal\u201d and indicated that they both\n\u201cappeared to be extremely cooperative.\u201d Smith indicated that\nfrom the time he arrived on the scene, which was prior to\nHowell\u2019s leaving the residence, to the time of the search was\n\u201ca little over an hour.\u201d\n   Mayr also testified at the suppression hearing and contra-\ndicted the officers\u2019 accounts of their interaction. Mayr indi-\ncated that Howell has been his \u201cgood friend[]\u201d since the two\nwere 18 or 19 years old. He also confirmed that in September\n2016, Howell had a key to the residence and a key to the\ngarage. Mayr explained that Howell rented space in the garage\nand stayed at the residence \u201cmore than half\u201d of the time.\n   Mayr testified that when officers initially asked to search\nthe garage, he told them \u201cno.\u201d Mayr indicated that he told the\nofficers that he and Vocasek wanted to leave the residence to\ngo to the grocery store. He testified that officers told them they\ncould not leave and that in fact, a police vehicle was used to\nblock them from leaving. Mayr described how during the next\ncouple hours, a spotlight shined directly into the residence.\nPolice officers repeatedly came to the door attempting to obtain\nhis and Vocasek\u2019s consent to search the garage. When he told\npolice that he did not know where the key was and that he\ndid not want them to pick the lock, police threatened to use a\n\f                              - 852 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                        STATE v.

During the State\u2019s cross-examination of Mayr,\nhe altered his rationale for signing the consent form. He stated\nthat he and Vocasek consented to the search because they did\nnot want police to obtain a search warrant and then possibly\ndamage the garage while attempting to gain access.\n   At the suppression hearing, Howell offered into evidence\nthe deposition of Vocasek. During her testimony, Vocasek con-\nfirmed that in September 2016, Howell lived in the residence\nabout half of every week. She also confirmed that Howell\nhad his own key to the residence and to the garage. Vocasek\nthen described the events that took place after Howell left\nthe residence on September 24, 2016. Vocasek described that\ntwo police officers knocked on the front door and asked for\npermission to search the garage. When she told them \u201cno,\u201d\npolice continued to ask for her consent to the search at least\nfour more times. Vocasek indicated that she told police that\nshe did not have a key to the garage and that she did not want\nthem to \u201cbreak[]\u201d into the garage. Vocasek testified that dur-\ning her conversation with police, Gratz indicated he could\nobtain a search warrant and then threatened to charge her with\na crime if any stolen property was found in the garage and\nshe had not consented to the search. When she and Mayr told\npolice they wanted to leave the residence in order to go to the\ngrocery store, she was told that they could not leave. Vocasek\nalso described how her dog would not stop barking due to the\npolice presence at the residence.\n   Vocasek testified that, ultimately, she gave the garage key\nto police and consented to the search because she did not want\n\f                               - 853 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                         STATE v.

App. 842\n\nto \u201cbe in trouble\u201d if they obtained a search warrant and found\nstolen property and because she wanted the police to leave.\nVocasek testified that police did not threaten to arrest her if she\ndid not sign the form.\n   Howell also testified at the suppression hearing. He indi-\ncated that he considered Mayr\u2019s residence to also be his resi-\ndence in September 2016. He explained that he had his own\nkey and his own space within the residence. In addition, he\npaid Mayr $200 per month in rent. Howell indicated that he\nwas in and out of the garage very frequently, but not all of the\nproperty in the garage was his.\n   After the suppression hearing, the district court entered a\ndetailed order denying Howell\u2019s motion to suppress the evi-\ndence obtained during the search of the garage. In the order,\nthe court found, \u201c[T]he totality of the circumstances surround-\ning the consent by Vocasek and Mayr demonstrate that con-\nsent was given voluntarily.\u201d Specifically, the court found that\npolice did not \u201cover-step[] their boundary in describing the\nconsequences that could unfold\u201d if Vocasek and Mayr did not\ncooperate with police:\n      They both were aware that the officers wanted to search\n      the garage. In fact, they knew the officers were, in fact,\n      going to search the garage whether Vocasek and Mayr\n      consented to the search or not. The fact that the officer\n      suggested they might be implicated if stolen property was\n      found in the garage does not invalidate the verbal and\n      written consents offered by Vocasek and Mayr.\nThe district court also explicitly stated that it did not find Mayr\nor Vocasek to be credible witnesses. The court stated, \u201cThe\nafter the fact protestation of Vocasek and Mayr, while consid-\nered, ring[s] hollow.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\n\n                        (c) Analysis\n   On appeal, Howell challenges the district court\u2019s decision\nto deny his motion to suppress the evidence found as a result\nof the search of the garage. Specifically, he asserts that the\n\f                               - 854 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                         STATE v. HOWELL\n                       Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\nevidence presented at the suppression hearing clearly dem-\nonstrated that Vocasek and Mayr did not voluntarily consent\nto the search of the garage. Instead, Howell asserts that their\nconsent was coerced by the police officers\u2019 actions. Upon our\nreview, we affirm the decision of the district court.\n   [2] It is well settled under the Fourth Amendment that\nwarrantless searches and seizures are per se unreasonable,\nsubject to a few specifically established and well-delineated\nexceptions. State v. Tucker, 262 Neb. 940, 636 N.W.2d 853\n(2001). The warrantless search exceptions recognized by the\nNebraska Supreme Court include: (1) searches undertaken with\nconsent, (2) searches under exigent circumstances, (3) inven-\ntory searches, (4) searches of evidence in plain view, and (5)\nsearches incident to a valid arrest. State v. Wells, 290 Neb. 186,\n859 N.W.2d 316 (2015).\n   [3,4] To be effective under the Fourth Amendment, consent\nto a search must be a free and unconstrained choice not the\nproduct of a will overborne. State v. Tucker, supra. Consent\nmust be given voluntarily and not as the result of duress or\ncoercion, whether express, implied, physical, or psychologi-\ncal. Id. In determining whether consent was coerced, account\nmust be taken of subtly coercive police questions, as well as\nthe possibly vulnerable subjective state of the person who\nconsents. See State v. Prahin, 235 Neb. 409, 455 N.W.2d\n554 (1990). Mere submission to authority is insufficient to\nestablish consent to a search. State v. Tucker, supra. The\ndetermination of whether a consent to search is voluntarily\ngiven is a question of fact to be determined from the total-\nity of the circumstances. See State v. Ready, 252 Neb. 816,\n565 N.W.2d 728 (1997). The burden is on the State to prove\nthat consent to search was voluntarily given. See State v.\nPrahin, supra.\n   [5] In his brief on appeal, Howell relies on the testimonies\nof Mayr and Vocasek to demonstrate that their consent to\nsearch the garage was not voluntarily given. However, as we\nnoted above, the district court did not find Mayr or Vocasek\n\f                               - 855 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                         STATE v. HOWELL\n                       Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\nto be credible witnesses. As such, the court relied on the testi-\nmonies of Gratz and Smith when ruling on the motion to sup-\npress. In determining the correctness of a trial court\u2019s ruling\non a suppression motion, an appellate court will accept the\nfactual determinations and credibility choices made by the trial\ncourt unless, in light of all the circumstances, such findings\nare clearly erroneous. State v. DeGroat, 244 Neb. 764, 508\nN.W.2d 861 (1993).\n   Upon our review of the record, we cannot say that the dis-\ntrict court clearly erred in determining that Mayr and Vocasek\ndid not provide credible testimony about the events which led\nup to their consent to search the garage. Evidence presented\nat the suppression hearing supported the district court\u2019s cred-\nibility finding. In particular, we note there was evidence that\nMayr had suffered a brain injury and that as a result of this\ninjury, he had problems with his memory. In addition, there\nwere inconsistencies between Mayr\u2019s testimony and Vocasek\u2019s\ntestimony. Although Mayr insisted that law enforcement threat-\nened to arrest him if he did not sign the consent to search\nform, Vocasek testified that no such threat was made. Because\nthe district court did not clearly err in its credibility finding,\nwe, like the district court, rely on the testimonies of Gratz and\nSmith in analyzing the district court\u2019s decision to deny the\nmotion to suppress.\n   Both Gratz and Smith testified that when they spoke with\nMayr and Vocasek, both appeared to want to cooperate. In\naddition, Smith testified that both appeared to be acting \u201cnor-\nmal.\u201d Mayr\u2019s and Vocasek\u2019s only apparent hesitancy with\nallowing police to search the garage was that they did not\nknow where Mayr\u2019s key was and that they did not want the\ngarage damaged in any way by the police entering without a\nkey. Once Mayr and Vocasek located the key, they brought it\noutside and gave it to Smith. They then signed the necessary\nconsent forms.\n   Gratz explicitly denied that he ever threatened to arrest\neither Mayr or Vocasek. In addition, he denied telling Mayr\n\f                              - 856 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                        STATE v. HOWELL\n                      Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\nand Vocasek that they were not allowed to leave the residence.\nGratz did admit that he explained to Mayr and Vocasek that\nif they did not consent to the search, he could obtain a search\nwarrant. In fact, Gratz left the residence in order to start the\nprocess of obtaining a search warrant. However, a statement\nof a law enforcement agent that, absent a consent to search, a\nwarrant can be obtained does not constitute coercion. See State\nv. Tucker, 262 Neb. 940, 636 N.W.2d 853 (2001).\n   Smith also denied that any promises or threats were made\nto Mayr and Vocasek to obtain their consent. Specifically, he\ntestified that no one threatened to arrest either one of them if\nsomeone did not sign the consent form. Both Gratz and Smith\nindicated that their interactions with Mayr and Vocasek lasted\napproximately an hour.\n   Based on the totality of the facts and circumstances present,\nwe cannot say that the district court erred in denying Howell\u2019s\nmotion to suppress. The testimony of Gratz and Smith estab-\nlishes that Mayr and Vocasek were cooperative and wanted to\nhelp police. Although Mayr and Vocasek initially denied police\naccess to the garage because they could not find the key, once\nthey did find the key, they readily provided police with such\naccess. Moreover, the totality of the evidence indicates that\nMayr\u2019s and Vocasek\u2019s consent to search was voluntarily given\nand not the result of coercion or duress. We affirm the decision\nof the district court.\n\n            2.

App. 842\n\n                    (b) Additional Background\n   During Gratz\u2019 testimony at trial, he indicated that he had\nreceived information regarding his investigation of the stolen\nmotorcycle from a confidential informant. Prior to Gratz\u2019 tes-\ntifying to what this information entailed, Howell objected to\nthe testimony. The court overruled the objection and permitted\nHowell to have a standing objection \u201cas to that issue.\u201d Gratz\nthen testified as follows:\n      This confidential informant informed myself and my part-\n      ner . . . at the time, I specifically asked about stolen\n      motorcycles in the Lincoln area as there had been an\n      increase in those occurring. The confidential informant\n      . . . informed myself and [my partner] that . . . Howell\n      had taken a motorcycle from the area of 42nd and Adams\n      Street, and had taken it to a garage on North 27th Street,\n      directly across from the Salvation Army, where at that\n      location the [confidential informant] reported that . . .\n      Howell had cut that motorcycle into pieces.\nIn the jury instructions, the district court addressed Gratz\u2019 tes-\ntimony about what he learned from the confidential informant.\nJury instruction No. 12 provides:\n         During this trial there was evidence that was received\n      for specified limited purposes.\n         ....\n         2. Any evidence relating to statements made by a con-\n      fidential informant to Officer Gratz were only offered by\n      the state for the limited purpose of showing how and why\n      Officer Gratz came to be at [the residence on] N. 27th on\n      September 24, 2016. You must consider that evidence\n      only for that limited purpose and for no other.\n   Later on in Gratz\u2019 trial testimony, the State asked whether\nhe was able to determine whether Howell had any connection\nto the residence on North 27th Street, which was described\nby the confidential informant. Gratz responded to the ques-\ntion, stating, \u201cI was already familiar with . . . Howell from\nprior investigations and had been in communication with other\n\f                               - 858 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                         STATE v.

I hadn\u2019t located\nany specific information [connecting] Howell to that address.\u201d\nHowell objected to Gratz\u2019 testimony. He argued that Gratz\u2019\nstatement that he learned from other officers that Howell\n\u201cfrequent[ed]\u201d the area was cumulative evidence and was\nhearsay. The court overruled Howell\u2019s objections.\n\n                          (c) Analysis\n   On appeal, Howell challenges the district court\u2019s decision to\noverrule the objections he made to Gratz\u2019 testimony about what\nthe confidential informant told him and about what he learned\nfrom other officers. He asserts that Gratz\u2019 testimony included\nhearsay and that such hearsay was prejudicial.\n\n                   (i) Information Received From\n                        Confidential Informant\n   Before we reach the merits of Howell\u2019s assertion on appeal\nthat the district court erred in overruling his hearsay objection\nto Gratz\u2019 testimony about what the confidential informant told\nhim, we must determine if Howell has preserved this issue for\nappellate review.\n   Prior to trial, Howell made a motion in limine to preclude\nGratz from testifying about what the confidential informant\ntold him. Howell argued that such testimony was hearsay\nand not relevant. The court overruled the motion in limine,\nstating:\n      The motion in limine is a preliminary motion and is done\n      in anticipation of certain things. It does not preclude the\n      court from sustaining objections at trial but is appreciated\n      by the court because it gives the court a little heads up\n      as to what motions might be coming and gives the court\n      some ability to think about those in advance.\n         Having said that, the motion in limine is overruled in\n      its entirety. . . .\n         ....\n\f                               - 859 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                         STATE v.

I think he\n      gets to testify as to why he was there and that the State\n      shouldn\u2019t have to have an open ended, officer just show-\n      ing up without a particular reason given, or the circum-\n      stances that underpin that event.\n   At trial, when the State asked Gratz about how he came into\ninformation about the stolen motorcycle, Howell objected,\nstating, \u201cYour Honor, may I approach? I\u2019m going to object\nto the question. I think it\u2019s going to call for an answer that is\nobjectionable . . . .\u201d During a conversation between Howell\u2019s\ncounsel, the State, and the court, outside the presence of the\njury, Howell\u2019s counsel informed the court that he was object-\ning to the form of the State\u2019s question. He also asserted that\nhow Gratz received the knowledge was not relevant. When\nthe State offered to rephrase the question, Howell\u2019s coun-\nsel stated:\n      You guys all know what I\u2019m trying to do here. So that\u2019s\n      the issue, is how he came into the information. I think it\u2019s\n      such a loaded, broad question that it invites him to give\n      an answer about what somebody told him. And I\u2019ve made\n      that clear before and I\u2019m going to make that \u2014 jump up\n      and down on that issue.\nThe court did not specifically rule on Howell\u2019s objections, but\ndid give the State the opportunity to rephrase the question.\n   Later, the State asked Gratz \u201cwhat specific information did\nyou receive with regard to a stolen motorcycle?\u201d Howell\u2019s\ncounsel told the court, \u201cI\u2019m going to object.\u201d The court over-\nruled the objection and indicated that Howell could \u201chave a\nstanding objection as to that issue.\u201d\n   [7,8] Although it is clear that prior to trial, Howell objected\nto Gratz\u2019 testimony about what the confidential informant told\nhim on the basis that such testimony was hearsay, a careful\nreading of the record reveals that he did not specifically renew\nhis hearsay objection at trial.

Herrera, 289 Neb. 575, 856 N.W.2d 310 (2014). The\nSupreme Court has interpreted this rule to mean that where\nthere has been a pretrial ruling regarding the admissibility of\nevidence, a party must make a timely and specific objection to\nthe evidence when it is offered at trial in order to preserve any\nerror for appellate review. Id. Thus, when a motion in limine\nto exclude evidence is overruled, the movant must object when\nthe particular evidence which was sought to be excluded by the\nmotion is offered during trial to preserve error for appeal. Id.\nSimilarly, the failure to object to evidence at trial, even though\nthe evidence was the subject of a previous motion to suppress,\nwaives the objection, and a party will not be heard to complain\nof the alleged error on appeal. Id.\n   Howell has failed to make a clear record of the basis for his\nobjections to Gratz\u2019 testimony at trial. At trial, Howell failed\nto explicitly indicate that he was objecting to Gratz\u2019 testimony\nabout what the confidential informant told him on the basis\nthat the testimony was hearsay. He did assert a foundational\nobjection and a relevance objection. In addition, he made a\ngeneralized objection to the line of questioning by the State.\nThe closest Howell came to making a hearsay objection was\nduring his conversation with the State and the district court\noutside the jury\u2019s presence. At one point during that conversa-\ntion, Howell\u2019s counsel indicated that he was objecting to the\nState\u2019s question because the question \u201cinvites [Gratz] to give\nan answer about what somebody told him.\u201d\n   Ultimately, we need not decide if counsel\u2019s assertion that\nhe was objecting to Gratz\u2019 testimony \u201cabout what somebody\ntold him\u201d is adequate to preserve his pretrial hearsay objection,\nbecause even if we consider him to have validly preserved this\nissue, his assertion is without merit.\n   [9,10] Hearsay is \u201ca statement, other than one made by\nthe declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered\nin evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Neb.\n\f                               - 861 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                         STATE v.

Stat. \u00a7 27-801(3) (Reissue 2016).\nStated another way, if an out-of-court statement is not offered\nfor the purpose of proving the truth of the facts asserted, it is\nnot hearsay. State v. Baker, 280 Neb. 752, 789 N.W.2d 702\n(2010). When overruling a hearsay objection on the ground\nthat testimony about an out-of-court statement is received not\nfor its truth but only to prove that the statement was made,\na trial court should identify the specific nonhearsay purpose\nfor which the making of the statement is relevant and proba-\ntive. Id.\n   Here, the State argued that Gratz\u2019 testimony about what\nthe confidential informant told him was not offered to prove\nthe truth of the confidential informant\u2019s statements, but was\ninstead offered to demonstrate why Gratz went to the residence\non North 27th Street on September 24, 2016. The court did not\nexplain the limited purpose of this testimony contemporane-\nously with Gratz\u2019 testimony, but within the jury instructions,\nthe district court specifically informed the jury that it was only\nto consider what the confidential informant said to Gratz \u201cfor\nthe limited purpose of showing how and why Officer Gratz\ncame to be at [the residence on] N. 27th on September 24,\n2016.\u201d In the instruction, the court then reiterated that the jury\nwas only to consider the testimony \u201cfor that limited purpose\nand for no other.\u201d\n   The record reveals that the State offered Gratz\u2019 testimony\nabout what the confidential informant told him not to prove\nthe truth of the confidential informant\u2019s statements, but instead\nto demonstrate why Gratz went to the residence on North\n27th Street on September 24, 2016. Although it would have\nbeen helpful for the district court to advise the jury about the\nlimited purpose for which the evidence was received at the\ntime the jury heard that evidence, we conclude that the district\ncourt\u2019s instruction to the jury at the end of trial was sufficient\nto inform the jury of the limited purpose of the testimony.\nBecause the State did not offer the testimony to prove the\ntruth of the confidential informant\u2019s statements and because\n\f                               - 862 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                         STATE v. HOWELL\n                       Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\nthe district court explicitly instructed the jury about the limited\npurpose of that evidence, we conclude that Howell\u2019s assertions\non appeal which relate to this issue are without merit.\n\n                    (ii) Information Received\n                       From Other Officers\n   [11,12] We find it unnecessary to address the admissibility\nof Gratz\u2019 testimony that he learned from other officers that\nHowell \u201cfrequent[ed]\u201d the area of the pertinent residence on\nNorth 27th Street. Even if Gratz\u2019 testimony included inadmis-\nsible hearsay, we conclude the admission of such testimony\nwas harmless. Generally, an \u201c\u2018erroneous admission of evidence\nis harmless error and does not require reversal if the evidence\nis cumulative and other relevant evidence, properly admitted,\nsupports the finding by the trier of fact.\u2019\u201d State v. Ildefonso,\n262 Neb. 672, 686, 634 N.W.2d 252, 265 (2001) (quoting State\nv. Quintana, 261 Neb. 38, 621 N.W.2d 121 (2001)). Harmless\nerror review looks to the basis on which the jury actually rested\nits verdict. The inquiry is not whether in a trial that occurred\nwithout the error, a guilty verdict would surely have been ren-\ndered, but whether the actual guilty verdict rendered was surely\nunattributable to the error. State v. Burries, 297 Neb. 367, 900\nN.W.2d 483 (2017).\n   The admission of Gratz\u2019 testimony that other officers told\nhim that Howell frequented the area of the pertinent residence\non North 27th Street was harmless because there was other,\nadmissible, evidence which demonstrated that Howell was fre-\nquently in the area of that residence in the months leading up\nto September 24, 2016. Howell, himself, testified that he was\nat the residence \u201cregularly\u201d in the months preceding September\n24. He admitted that he had a key and uncontrolled access\nto the residence\u2019s detached garage. In addition, when Gratz\narrived at the residence on September 24, Howell was inside\nthe residence. Howell then left the residence to come outside to\nspeak with police. This evidence, which was properly admitted\nand not objected to, demonstrates that Howell \u201cfrequent[ed]\u201d\n\f                              - 863 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                        STATE v.

As a result, even\nif we were to assume Gratz\u2019 testimony included inadmissible\nhearsay, the admission of the testimony does not constitute\nreversible error.\n\n                  3. Motions for Mistrial\n                   (a) Standard of Review\n   [13] Whether to grant a mistrial is within the trial court\u2019s\ndiscretion, and an appellate court will not disturb its ruling\nunless the court abused its discretion. State v. Ramirez, 287\nNeb. 356, 842 N.W.2d 694 (2014).\n\n                    (b) Additional Background\n   After the State completed its opening statement, Howell\u2019s\ncounsel asked to approach the bench. In a conversation\nbetween Howell\u2019s counsel, the State, and the district court,\nHowell\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial based on the State\u2019s ref-\nerence during its opening statement to \u201cwhat the confidential\ninform\u00adant told . . . Gratz what Howell stole and that he has it\nsitting in his garage.\u201d Howell\u2019s counsel referenced his pretrial\nmotion in limine on that subject. The district court overruled\nthe motion for mistrial.\n   During the State\u2019s closing arguments, Howell\u2019s counsel\nagain made a motion for mistrial when the State referenced\nwhat the confidential informant told Gratz. The court again\noverruled the motion.\n\n                           (c) Analysis\n   On appeal, Howell asserts that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in overruling his motions for mistrial. We find his\nassertion to be without merit. In our analysis above, we found\nthat the district court did not err in allowing Gratz to testify\nabout what the confidential informant told him, given that the\ncourt instructed the jury to consider such evidence only for the\nlimited purpose of why Gratz went to the residence on North\n27th Street on September 24, 2016.

App. 842\n\nadmissible, the State was permitted to reference the evidence in\nits opening statement and closing argument in order to explain\nhow Gratz\u2019 investigation unfolded. We note that in the jury\ninstructions, the district court explicitly informed the jury that\nthe statements and arguments by the lawyers are not to be con-\nsidered as evidence. The district court did not abuse its discre-\ntion in overruling Howell\u2019s motions for mistrial.\n\n              4. Evidence of Value During Officer\n                   Scott Chandler\u2019s Testimony\n                     (a) Standard of Review\n   [14,15] In proceedings where the Nebraska Evidence\nRules apply, the admissibility of evidence is controlled by the\nNebraska Evidence Rules; judicial discretion is involved only\nwhen the rules make discretion a factor in determining admis-\nsibility. State v. Daly, 278 Neb. 903, 775 N.W.2d 47 (2009).\nWhere the Nebraska Evidence Rules commit the evidentiary\nquestion at issue to the discretion of the trial court, an appellate\ncourt reviews the admissibility of evidence for an abuse of dis-\ncretion. State v. Russell, 292 Neb. 501, 874 N.W.2d 8 (2016).\n\n                   (b) Additional Background\n   During the trial, the State called Officer Scott Chandler to\ntestify. Chandler testified that he took a report from Fleischman\nimmediately after Fleischman discovered his motorcycle had\nbeen stolen. The State asked Chandler if Fleischman reported\nthe value of the motorcycle. Chandler testified that Fleischman\nreported the value of the motorcycle to be $2,500. Howell\nmoved to strike Chandler\u2019s testimony about value. He argued,\n\u201cThat is hearsay. That\u2019s an element of the crime, something\nthe state would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAnd I think that is not something this officer can testify to.\nThat\u2019s a statement made out of court.\u201d The district court did\nnot rule on Howell\u2019s objection. Instead, the State offered to\nask a different question of Chandler. The State then proceeded\nto have the following exchange with Chandler: \u201cQ. So . . .\n\f                               - 865 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                         STATE v. HOWELL\n                       Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\nFleischman gave you an idea as to the value of that motor-\ncycle, correct? A. Yes. Q. And you documented that in your\nreport; is that correct? A. Yes.\u201d These were the last questions\nasked of Chandler.\n\n                            (c) Analysis\n   On appeal, Howell argues that the district court erred in not\ngranting his motion to strike Chandler\u2019s testimony regarding\nthe value of the motorcycle. Howell asserts that the testimony\nwas inadmissible hearsay. Upon our review, we find Howell\u2019s\nassertion has no merit.\n   Our review of the record reveals that Howell has waived\nhis right to appeal this issue. The record indicates that the\ndistrict court did not specifically rule on Howell\u2019s motion to\nstrike Chandler\u2019s testimony and that Howell did not request\nthe district court to make such a ruling. Instead, it appears that\nHowell was satisfied with the State\u2019s decision to ask less direct\nquestions about value.\n   [16] It is well established that a party who fails to insist\nupon a ruling to a proffered objection waives that objection.\nState v. Daly, supra. The Supreme Court has explained that\n      \u201c\u2018[i]f when inadmissible evidence is offered the party\n      against whom such evidence is offered consents to its\n      introduction, or fails to object, or to insist upon a ruling\n      on an objection to the introduction of the evidence, and\n      otherwise fails to raise the question as to its admissibility,\n      he is considered to have waived whatever objection he\n      may have had thereto, and the evidence is in the record\n      for consideration the same as other evidence.\u2019\u201d\nId. at 928, 775 N.W.2d at 68-69 (quoting State v. Nowicki, 239\nNeb. 130, 474 N.W.2d 478 (1991)). Because the district court\ndid not rule on the motion to strike Chandler\u2019s testimony about\nvalue and Howell did not request such a ruling, he has waived\nhis objections to the testimony.\n   We note that even if Howell did not waive his objection to\nChandler\u2019s testimony about value and even if such testimony\n\f                              - 866 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                        STATE v. HOWELL\n                      Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\nwas inadmissible hearsay, Howell\u2019s argument on appeal would\nstill be without merit. Chandler\u2019s testimony about the value\nof the motorcycle was cumulative to Fleischman\u2019s trial tes-\ntimony about the value of his stolen motorcycle. Chandler\ntestified that Fleischman reported the value of the motorcycle\nto be $2,500. Fleischman testified at trial that the value of the\nmotorcycle when it was stolen was $2,500. Keeping in mind\nthe principles governing the erroneous admission of evidence\nand harmless error discussed earlier in this opinion, it is clear\nthat even if we assume that Chandler\u2019s testimony about the\nvalue of the motorcycle was inadmissible hearsay, the admis-\nsion of the testimony into evidence would not require reversal,\nbecause there is other evidence to establish the value of the\nstolen motorcycle.\n\n               5. Testimony R egarding Howell\u2019s\n                    Prior Felony Conviction\n                   (a) Additional Background\n   At trial, Howell testified in his own defense. The first ques-\ntion Howell\u2019s counsel asked during the direct examination was\nwhether Howell had previously been convicted of a felony.\nHowell answered affirmatively. Counsel then asked Howell\n\u201cwhat exactly was\u201d the nature of his prior felony conviction.\nThe State objected. The State argued:\n     That\u2019s an improper question . . . the only thing that can be\n     asked is whether [Howell] \u2014 or the prosecution can ask\n     is have you been convicted of a felony offense in the past\n     ten years, yes or no. There cannot be any inquiry whatso-\n     ever into the nature of the offense.\nThe district court sustained the State\u2019s objection, and Howell\nwas not permitted to explain the particulars of his prior felony\nconviction.\n\n                         (b) Analysis\n  On appeal, Howell challenges the district court\u2019s decision to\nprohibit him from testifying about the particulars of his prior\n\f                               - 867 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                         STATE v. HOWELL\n                       Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\nfelony conviction. Specifically, he argues that he should have\nbeen allowed to testify as to the nature of his felony conviction\nbecause the evidentiary rule which precludes questions about\nthe particulars of a prior felony conviction \u201cis intended to\nprotect criminal defendants, not the State.\u201d Brief for appellant\nat 35. Upon our review, we affirm the decision of the district\ncourt to prohibit Howell\u2019s testimony about the specifics of his\nprior felony conviction.\n   [17,18] Neb. Evid. R. 609, Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 27-609 (Reissue\n2016), provides in part:\n         (1) For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a wit-\n      ness, evidence that he has been convicted of a crime shall\n      be admitted if elicited from him or established by public\n      record during cross-examination, but only if the crime (a)\n      was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of\n      one year under the law under which he was convicted or\n      (b) involved dishonesty or false statement regardless of\n      the punishment.\nThe Supreme Court has previously held that when a defendant\nin a criminal case testifies in his own behalf, he is subject to the\nsame rules of cross-examination as any other witness, includ-\ning rule 609. See State v. Pitts, 212 Neb. 295, 322 N.W.2d\n443 (1982). The Supreme Court has also provided specific\ninstructions about the proper use of prior felony convictions\nduring a defendant\u2019s testimony: \u201cThe purpose of Rule 609 is\nto allow the prosecution to attack the credibility of a testifying\ndefendant, not to retry him for a separate crime or prejudice the\njury by allowing unlimited access to the facts of an unrelated\ncrime . . . .\u201d State v. Daugherty, 215 Neb. 45, 47, 337 N.W.2d\n128, 129 (1983). Once having established the conviction, the\ninquiry must end there, and it is improper to inquire into the\nnature of the crime, the details of the offense, or the time spent\nin prison as a result thereof. State v. Johnson, 226 Neb. 618,\n413 N.W.2d 897 (1987).\n   The Supreme Court has previously noted that its interpreta-\ntion of rule 609 provides a more limited cross-examination\n\f                              - 868 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                        STATE v. HOWELL\n                      Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\nregarding felony convictions than is provided for by other\njurisdictions with a similarly worded rule. The Supreme Court\nhas stated:\n         While current construction of Neb. Evid. R. 609 pro-\n      hibits mention of the name or identity of the crime in the\n      conviction used for impeachment of a witness, by far the\n      greater number of jurisdictions allow reference to the par-\n      ticular criminal offense underlying the conviction offered\n      for a witness\u2019 impeachment in accordance with rules of\n      evidence substantially similar to Neb. Evid. R. 609.\nState v. Olsan, 231 Neb. 214, 222-23, 436 N.W.2d 128, 134\n(1989).\n   The strict application of rule 609 has been discussed more\nrecently in State v. Castillo-Zamora, 289 Neb. 382, 855 N.W.2d\n14 (2014). In that case, the State properly impeached a defense\nwitness during cross-examination by asking whether the wit-\nness had previously been convicted of a felony or crime of\ndishonesty. On redirect examination, defense counsel asked\nthe witness if he had \u201c\u2018been convicted of a felony,\u2019\u201d to which\nthe State objected. Id. at 388, 855 N.W.2d at 22. The trial\ncourt sustained the objection on the ground that rule 609 does\nnot draw a distinction between felonies and crimes involving\ndishonesty and, therefore, does not permit counsel to question\nwhether a witness was convicted of a felony or crime involving\ndishonesty. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the deci-\nsion of the district court to prohibit the defense witness from\ntestifying regarding the specifics of his prior conviction. The\nSupreme Court explained:\n      The inquiry is restricted, because a witness\u2019 conviction\n      of a crime is meant to be used for whatever effect it\n      has on only the credibility of the witness, and it is not\n      meant to otherwise impact the jury\u2019s view of the charac-\n      ter of the witness. Nebraska is among a small number of\n      jurisdictions that has adopted this view. The vast major-\n      ity of jurisdictions allow inquiry into the nature of the\n      underlying conviction. But a long history of case law in\n\f                               - 869 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                         STATE v. HOWELL\n                       Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\n      Nebraska strictly construing [rule 609] establishes that\n      the nature of the underlying conviction does not matter\n      for impeachment purposes. We see no reason to recon-\n      sider our prior [rule 609] jurisprudence and no reason\n      why the rule should not be extended to redirect examina-\n      tion as well.\nState v. Castillo-Zamora, 289 Neb. at 389, 855 N.W.2d at 22.\n   We recognize that the present case presents a unique factual\nscenario that has not yet been addressed in Nebraska. Here, it\nis the defendant, Howell, who desired to offer details of his\nprior felony conviction during his direct examination, appar-\nently in an attempt to prevent the State from asking about the\nprior conviction during its cross-examination. When Howell\nattempted to provide further information about his prior con-\nviction, the State objected to such testimony, relying on rule\n609. At trial and on appeal, Howell has failed to provide any\nauthority to support his proposition that this unique factual\nscenario should lead us to find an exception to the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s strict application of rule 609, and we have been unable\nto find any such authority upon our own review. However, we\nare cognizant of the concern that the application of rule 609 in\nthis instance could conflict with the rule prohibiting infringe-\nment of the defendant\u2019s right to testify in his own defense. See,\ne.g., Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44, 55-56, 107 S. Ct. 2704, 97\nL. Ed. 2d 37 (1987) (\u201c[b]ut restrictions of a defendant\u2019s right to\ntestify may not be arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes\nthey are designed to serve\u201d).\n   In light of our review of the precedent established by the\nSupreme Court as it relates to a strict application of rule 609,\nwe are constrained to find that the district court did not err\nin prohibiting Howell from testifying as to the specifics of\nhis prior felony conviction. Pursuant to rule 609, Howell was\npermitted to testify that he had previously been convicted of a\nfelony or a crime involving dishonesty. He was not permitted\nto divulge the specifics of his prior conviction, as such infor-\nmation was not relevant to his credibility.\n\f                               - 870 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                         STATE v.

Evidence R egarding Stolen Bicycles\n                    (a) Additional Background\n   Both prior to and during the trial, Howell objected to the\nadmission of evidence that two stolen bicycles were found in\nthe garage along with Fleischman\u2019s stolen motorcycle. Two\nhearings were held in conjunction with Howell\u2019s objections. At\nthe first hearing, Gratz testified that police found two stolen,\n\u201chigh end\u201d bicycles in the garage during their search. During\nthe second hearing, the owner of one of the stolen bicycles\ntestified about when and where his bicycle was stolen and\nabout modifications that were made to the bicycle after it was\nstolen. At these hearings, the State argued that the evidence\nwas admissible to prove its theory that Howell was operating a\n\u201cchop shop\u201d out of the garage where he was taking apart stolen\nmotorcycles and bicycles.\n   Ultimately, the district court overruled Howell\u2019s objections\nto evidence regarding the stolen bicycles. The court found that\nsuch evidence was inextricably intertwined with the criminal\ncharge which resulted from the stolen motorcycle. In the alter-\nnative, the court found that the evidence was admissible pursu-\nant to Neb. Evid. R. 404, Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 27-404 (Reissue\n2016). Prior to the jury\u2019s hearing the testimony about the\nbicycles, and prior to deliberations, the court instructed the jury\nas follows:\n      Any evidence relating to any bicycle found in the garage,\n      was only offered by the state for specified limited pur-\n      poses which is to show motive, opportunity, intent, prepa-\n      ration, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake\n      or accident. It is for these limited purposes that the\n      court allows evidence of other crimes not charged in the\n      Information. You must consider that evidence only for\n      those limited purposes and for no other.\n                         (b) Analysis\n  On appeal, Howell argues that the district court erred in\nadmitting evidence of the stolen bicycles found in the garage.\n\f                              - 871 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                        STATE v. HOWELL\n                      Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\nHowell asserts that such evidence is not relevant and that\npursuant to rule 404, the State \u201cfailed to prove by clear and\nconvincing and admissible evidence . . . that Howell had any-\nthing at all to do with the bicycles.\u201d Brief for appellant at 35\n(emphasis omitted). We note Howell\u2019s argument in support of\nhis contention focuses primarily on his belief that the Nebraska\nEvidence Rules apply at a pretrial 404 hearing and that as a\nresult, the State could not offer hearsay evidence at such a\nhearing. Ultimately, we conclude that the district court did\nnot err in determining that evidence of the stolen bicycles was\ninextricably intertwined with evidence of the stolen motorcycle\nso as to exclude such evidence from the parameters of rule\n404(2). Because we find that evidence of the stolen bicycles\ndid not constitute rule 404 evidence, it is not necessary for\nus to address Howell\u2019s assertion about whether the Nebraska\nEvidence Rules apply at a pretrial rule 404 hearing.\n   [19,20] Rule 404(2) provides the following:\n      Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admis-\n      sible to prove the character of a person in order to show\n      that he or she acted in conformity therewith. It may, how-\n      ever, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of\n      motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge,\n      identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\nRule 404(2) does not apply to evidence of a defendant\u2019s other\ncrimes or bad acts if the evidence is inextricably intertwined\nwith the charged crime. State v. Burries, 297 Neb. 367,\n900 N.W.2d 483 (2017). Inextricably intertwined evidence\nincludes evidence that forms part of the factual setting of\nthe crime, or evidence that is so blended or connected to the\ncharged crime that proof of the charged crime will necessarily\nrequire proof of the other crimes or bad acts, or if the other\ncrimes or bad acts are necessary for the prosecution to present\na coherent picture of the charged crime. Id. We find that the\nevidence presented regarding the stolen bicycles was neces-\nsary for the prosecution to present a coherent picture of the\ncharged crime.\n\f                              - 872 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                        STATE v. HOWELL\n                      Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\n   Evidence of the stolen bicycles was part of the factual\nsetting surrounding law enforcement\u2019s search of the garage\nwhere the stolen motorcycle was located. At trial, Gratz testi-\nfied about his observations of the garage on the night of the\nsearch. In addition, the State offered into evidence photo-\ngraphs of the garage. Gratz indicated that there were tools\npositioned throughout the garage. In particular, he noted that\nthere were two air compressors in the garage which were\n\u201chooked up to an air brush for painting motorcycles.\u201d Gratz\ntestified that once he was in the garage, he smelled \u201ca very\nstrong odor of what I would describe as paint or specifically\nvehicle paint.\u201d In addition, Gratz described how parts and\npieces of the stolen motorcycle were dispersed throughout the\ngarage. Gratz indicated that officers also found two bicycles\nin the garage. Later, the owner of one of the stolen bicycles\ntestified that one of the bicycles found in the garage was his\nand explained how the bicycle had been modified after it was\nstolen from him.\n   [21] The record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion\nthat evidence of the stolen bicycles was inextricably inter-\ntwined with evidence of the stolen motorcycle. Evidence of\nthe stolen bicycles was instrumental in the State\u2019s ability to\npresent a coherent picture of where the stolen motorcycle\nwas located and what was going on at that location. We have\npreviously stated that the State will not be prohibited from\npresenting a portion of its case merely because the actions\nof the defendant proving the State\u2019s case were criminal in\nnature. State v. Wisinski, 12 Neb. App. 549, 680 N.W.2d 205\n(2004) (finding evidence that defendant was driving stolen\ntruck when he was found to be in possession of stolen prop-\nerty was admissible, even though defendant had not been\ncharged with stealing truck). See, also, State v. Castellanos,\nante p. 310, 918 N.W.2d 345 (2018) (finding evidence that\ndefendant was in possession of stolen firearm was inextricably\nintertwined with charged crime of possession of firearm by\nprohibited person).\n\f                              - 873 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                        STATE v. HOWELL\n                      Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\n   The State\u2019s theory of the case was that Howell was operat-\ning a \u201cchop shop\u201d out of the garage where he was modifying\nstolen goods. Evidence which supported the State\u2019s theory was\nrelevant to demonstrate an element of the charged crime\u2014that\nHowell took or exercised control over the motorcycle with\nthe intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession.\nThe fact that the stolen motorcycle was found in pieces in a\ngarage with a number of tools and with at least one bicycle\nwhich had also been modified from its original form provides\na complete picture of the circumstances surrounding Howell\u2019s\npossession of the stolen motorcycle. Accordingly, we find\nthat the district court did not err in admitting evidence of\nthe stolen bicycles found in the garage during law enforce-\nment\u2019s search.\n\n                       7. Jury Instructions\n                     (a) Standard of Review\n   [22] Whether a jury instruction given by a trial court is cor-\nrect is a question of law. When reviewing questions of law, an\nappellate court has an obligation to resolve the questions inde-\npendently of the conclusion reached by the trial court. Roth v.\nWiese, 271 Neb. 750, 716 N.W.2d 419 (2006).\n   [23] To establish reversible error from a court\u2019s failure to\ngive a requested jury instruction, an appellant has the burden\nto show that (1) the tendered instruction is a correct statement\nof the law, (2) the tendered instruction was warranted by the\nevidence, and (3) the appellant was prejudiced by the court\u2019s\nfailure to give the requested instruction. Id.\n\n                        (b) Background\n   During the jury instruction conference, Howell objected to\ntwo of the district court\u2019s proposed jury instructions: instruc-\ntion No. 7 and instruction No. 12. Jury instruction No. 7 pro-\nvided to the jury a definition of multiple terms associated with\nthe elements of theft by unlawful taking, including, \u201c\u2018[o]n,\nabout, or between\u2019\u201d; \u201c\u2018[m]ovable property\u2019\u201d; \u201c\u2018[d]eprive\u2019\u201d;\n\f                              - 874 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                        STATE v. HOWELL\n                      Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\n\u201c\u2018[p]roperty of another\u2019\u201d; and \u201c\u2018[i]ntentionally.\u2019\u201d Howell\nrequested that the district court also include a definition of\nthe term \u201cexercise control.\u201d Specifically, Howell proposed that\nthe court should define \u201cexercise control\u201d for the jury as \u201cthe\npower and . . . intent to exercise control.\u201d The district court\noverruled Howell\u2019s request to alter proposed jury instruction\nNo. 7.\n   The district court\u2019s proposed jury instruction No. 12 provided\nthe jury with an explanation of evidence that was received for\nonly a specified limited purpose. Ultimately, the court altered\nthis instruction somewhat in accordance with the requests of\nHowell. Jury instruction No. 12, as read to the jury, provided\nas follows:\n         During this trial there was evidence that was received\n      for specified limited purposes.\n         1. Any evidence relating to any bicycle found in the\n      garage, was only offered by the state for specified limited\n      purposes which is to show motive, opportunity, intent,\n      preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mis-\n      take or accident. It is for these limited purposes that the\n      court allows evidence of other crimes not charged in the\n      Information. You must consider that evidence only for\n      those limited purposes and for no other.\n         2. Any evidence relating to statements made by a con-\n      fidential informant to Officer Gratz were only offered by\n      the state for the limited purpose of showing how and why\n      Officer Gratz came to be at [the residence on] N. 27th on\n      September 24, 2016. You must consider that evidence\n      only for that limited purpose and for no other.\nAlthough the district court did make some alterations to\nthe jury instruction pursuant to Howell\u2019s requests, the dis-\ntrict court declined to grant Howell\u2019s request to also include\nthe specific purpose of the \u201cstatements made by the per-\nsons Officer Gratz testified were law enforcement offi-\ncers that [Howell] frequented the residence located [on] N.\n27th Street.\u201d\n\f                              - 875 -\n         Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n              26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                        STATE v. HOWELL\n                      Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\n                             (c) Analysis\n    In his brief on appeal, Howell assigns as error the district\ncourt\u2019s refusal to give his proposed jury instructions and in\noverruling his objections to jury instructions Nos. 7 and 12,\nwhich were read to the jury prior to deliberations. In the argu-\nment section of his brief, Howell restates the language con-\ntained in his proposed jury instructions Nos. 7 and 12. He then\nstates, \u201cThe district judge refused these proposed instructions.\n. . . Instead, the district judge gave Jury Instruction[s] Nos. 7\nand 12, over Howell\u2019s objections.\u201d Brief for appellant at 39.\nHowell does not provide any explanation as to his specific\nargument about why the given jury instructions were incorrect\nor why those instructions should have been replaced by his\nproposed instructions.\n    [24,25] For an alleged error to be considered by an appel-\nlate court, an appellant must both assign and specifically argue\nthe alleged error. State v. Smith, 292 Neb. 434, 873 N.W.2d\n169 (2016). An argument that does little more than restate\nan assignment of error does not support the assignment, and\nan appellate court will not address it. Id. Because Howell\u2019s\nargument simply restates the language of his proposed jury\ninstruction and then restates his assigned error, the argument\nis not sufficient and we decline to consider this assigned error\nany further.\n\n                   8. Motion for New Trial\n                    (a) Standard of Review\n   [26] In a criminal case, a motion for new trial is addressed\nto the discretion of the trial court, and unless an abuse of\ndiscretion is shown, the trial court\u2019s determination will not\nbe disturbed. State v. Hairston, 298 Neb. 251, 904 N.W.2d\n1 (2017).\n\n                   (b) Additional Background\n   After the jury found Howell guilty, he filed a timely motion\nfor new trial pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 29-2101 (Reissue\n\f                               - 876 -\n          Nebraska Court of A ppeals A dvance Sheets\n               26 Nebraska A ppellate R eports\n                         STATE v. HOWELL\n                       Cite as 26 Neb. App. 842\n\n2016). In the motion, he alleged that irregularity in the pro-\nceedings prevented him from having a fair trial; that there was\nmisconduct by the jury, the State, or the witnesses for the State;\nthat the verdict was not sustained by sufficient evidence; and\nthat an error of law occurred at the trial.\n   At the hearing on his motion for new trial, Howell indicated\nhe was abandoning his assertion that a new trial was warranted\ndue to misconduct by the jury, the State, or the witnesses for\nthe State. He did argue that a new trial was warranted because\nthe district court admitted evidence of the stolen bicycles and\nallowed Gratz to testify about what a confidential informant\ntold him. In addition, he argued that the district court erred in\nprohibiting him from testifying as to the nature of his felony\nconviction and in overruling his motion to suppress. Finally,\nHowell asserted that the State failed to sufficiently prove the\nvalue of the stolen motorcycle. The district court overruled the\nmotion for new trial.\n\n                          (c) Analysis\n  Given our analyses regarding these issues raised in Howell\u2019s\nmotion for new trial, we do not find that the district court\nabused its discretion in overruling the motion for new trial.\n\n                     V. CONCLUSION\n   Having found no error or, alternatively, only harmless error\nin the orders and rulings challenged by Howell herein, we\nhereby affirm Howell\u2019s conviction.\n                                                    A ffirmed.\n\f",
