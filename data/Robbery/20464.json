See Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 31.03 (Vernon\r\nSupp. 2007); id. \u00a7 31.07 (Vernon 2006).  A bench trial commenced.  After the close of the\r\nState's evidence, the district court dismissed count two of the indictment, alleging theft, and\r\nacquitted Eisenbach of the charge.   The trial court, however, convicted Eisenbach of\r\nunauthorized use of a motor vehicle, sentenced him to 735 days' imprisonment, and\r\nordered a $750.00 fine.  The court then suspended the prison sentence and placed\r\nEisenbach on community supervision for three years.   By a single issue, Eisenbach\r\nargues that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the trial court's\r\nfinding that Eisenbach did not have a greater right to possession of the vehicle than the\r\nalleged owner, as required to show unauthorized use.  We affirm.\r\n\r\nI.  Background\r\n\r\n\tEisenbach was a car salesman who sold cars under a \"floor-plan agreement.\" \r\nUnder this agreement, Jim Hall would finance Eisenbach's purchase of a car for resale. \r\nAccording to Hall's testimony, Eisenbach would approach him with a proposed car\r\npurchase.  Hall would inspect the vehicle to ensure that it was in good condition.  Hall\r\nwould then give Eisenbach money to purchase the car.  Eisenbach was required to bring\r\nHall the title to the car, which would be left \"open.\"  In other words, the purchaser or dealer\r\nreassignment blanks would be left empty.  According to Hall, at that point, he owned the\r\ncar.  Eisenbach was authorized to place the car for sale at Alternative Auto Sales, a used-car dealership owned by James Mann.  Eisenbach would sell the car using Mann's dealer\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\n\tUnder the agreement, Eisenbach would sell the car, pay Hall the amount Hall spent\r\nto purchase the car, plus a fee and interest, and keep the excess profit.  Hall would then\r\ngive Eisenbach the title to the car so that the purchaser's name could be put on the title. \r\nAccording to Hall, Eisenbach was not allowed to sell the cars under an installment plan. \r\nRather, when Eisenbach sold a car, he was required to pay Hall off in full.  Only then was\r\nEisenbach allowed to release the car to the buyer's possession.  Hall testified that he\r\nperiodically inspected Alternative Auto Sales to verify that all the cars he had purchased\r\nwere on the lot.\r\n\r\n\tIn 2005, Eisenbach approached Hall about purchasing a Cadillac Concourse.  Hall\r\ntestified that he paid $5,500.00 for the Cadillac, and Eisenbach provided Hall with the title. \r\nThe title was admitted into evidence.  Eisenbach's name is not listed anywhere on the title. \r\nHall testified that at the time he received the title, it was left \"open,\" meaning that no\r\npurchaser was filled in, so that the title was \"negotiable.\"  \r\n\r\n\tRichard Havelock-Bailie testified that he went to Alternative Auto Sales in 2005 and\r\nnegotiated with Eisenbach for the purchase of the Cadillac.  He testified that there was no\r\nwritten agreement for the sale.  Bailie testified that he agreed to pay Eisenbach a\r\n$5,000.00 down payment for the car by making payments of $100.00 per week.  Bailie\r\nstated that he traded in a truck and a dolly used to tow cars as part of the down payment. \r\nEisenbach allowed Bailie to take possession of the car.  Bailie testified that Eisenbach\r\nstated that he would  occasionally need to take the car to show Hall its condition, given that\r\nHall was financing the purchase.  Bailie testified that Eisenbach never told him that if he\r\nmissed a payment, Eisenbach would repossess the car.\r\n\r\n\tBailie made payments beginning in April 2005 and purchased insurance for the car. \r\nBailie testified that he made weekly payments throughout April, May, and June.  He stated\r\nthat on weeks that he did not have enough money to make a payment, Eisenbach allowed\r\nhim to double the payment the next week.  He further stated that on June 16, 2005, his\r\nwife made a payment of $450 because he knew he would not be able to make another\r\npayment that month.  \r\n\r\n\tOn July 9, 2005, Bailie testified that when he woke up in the morning, the Cadillac\r\nwas missing from his driveway.  Bailie testified that he had not given Eisenbach permission\r\nto take the car.  When he spoke to Eisenbach later that day, Eisenbach informed him that\r\nhe had taken the car and had hit a deer in El Dorado, Texas.  Hall testified that the car was\r\na total loss.  Bailie made a claim on his insurance policy and, after learning that Hall held\r\nthe title to the car, made Hall the loss payee on the insurance policy.  Hall and Bailie\r\ndivided up the proceeds from the insurance.\r\n\r\n\tEisenbach was indicted for theft and for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.  After\r\nthe State rested, the trial court acquitted Eisenbach of the theft charge.  Eisenbach's\r\nnephew testified on his behalf.  He testified that he assisted Eisenbach with repossessing\r\nthe vehicle.  He testified that after repossessing the vehicle, he brought the car to\r\nAlternative Auto Sales.  \t\r\n\r\n\tThe trial court convicted Eisenbach of unauthorized use of the vehicle, sentenced\r\nhim to 735 days' imprisonment, and ordered a $750.00 fine.  The court then suspended\r\nthe prison sentence and placed Eisenbach on community supervision for three years.  This\r\nappeal ensued.\r\n\r\nII.  Standards of Review\r\n\r\n\tBy a single issue, Eisenbach argues that the evidence is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to support his conviction.  To assess whether the evidence supporting a verdict\r\nis legally sufficient, we consider all the evidence in the record in the light most favorable\r\nto the verdict and determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant\r\nguilty of all the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  Hooper v. State, 214\r\nS.W.3d 9, 13 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318-19\r\n(1979)); Swearingen v. State, 101 S.W.3d 89, 95 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).  \r\n\r\n\tIn contrast, three basic rules guide our inquiry when conducting a factual-sufficiency\r\nanalysis.  Lancon v. State, 253 S.W.3d 699, 704 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008).  \"First, the court\r\nof appeals must be cognizant . . . that a [fact-finder] has already passed on the facts and\r\nmust give due deference to the [fact-finder's] determinations.\"  Id. at 705.  While we may\r\nnot agree with the ultimate decision, we must \"afford the appropriate deference in order to\r\navoid substituting [our] judgment for that of the [fact-finder].\"  Id.  Second, if we determine\r\nthat the evidence is factually insufficient, we must explain precisely why.  Id.  Third, we\r\nmust \"review all of the evidence in a neutral light, as opposed to a legal-sufficiency review\r\nin which the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict.\"  Id.  We will\r\nreverse for factual insufficiency of the evidence if \"the evidence supporting the verdict,\r\nthough legally sufficient, is nonetheless too weak to support it,\" or if, \"when considering\r\nconflicting evidence, the . . . verdict is against the great weight and preponderance of the\r\nevidence.\"  Id.\r\n\r\nIII.  Analysis \r\n\r\n\tA person commits the offense of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle if he\r\nintentionally or knowingly operates another's motor-propelled vehicle without the owner's\r\nconsent.  Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 31.07.  An \"owner\" is defined as \"a person who . . .  has\r\ntitle to the property, possession of the property, whether lawful or not, or a greater right to\r\npossession of the property than the actor.\"  Id. \u00a7 1.07(a)(35)(A) (Vernon 2003).  Eisenbach\r\nconcedes that he did not have permission to use the vehicle on the night it was taken from\r\nBailie's driveway.  He argues, however, that the evidence was legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to prove that Bailie had a greater right to possess the vehicle because Bailie\r\ndefaulted on his payments, and, therefore, Eisenbach had a right to repossess the vehicle. \r\n We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tA vehicle dealer can validly sell a vehicle without also transferring a certificate of title\r\nat the time of the sale.  In re Dota, 288 B.R. 448, 455-58 (S.D. Tex. 2003).  \"Unless\r\notherwise explicitly agreed title [to goods] passes to the buyer at the time and place at\r\nwhich the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of the\r\ngoods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title\r\nis to be delivered at a different time or place\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  See Tex. Bus. &amp; Comm. Code Ann. \u00a7\r\n2.401(b) (Vernon 1994).  \"Any retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property)\r\nin goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security\r\ninterest.\"  Id. \u00a7 2.401(a).  \r\n\r\n\tA \"secured party\" may repossess collateral in the possession of a buyer after a\r\ndefault if repossession is obtained through judicial process or if repossession can proceed\r\nwithout a breach of the peace.  Tex. Bus. &amp; Comm. Code Ann. \u00a7 9.609 (Vernon 2002).  A\r\n\"secured party\" is defined as \"a person in whose favor a security interest is created or\r\nprovided for under a security agreement, whether or not any obligation to be secured is\r\noutstanding.\"  Id. \u00a7 9.102(73)(A).  \r\n\r\n\tIn this case, Hall testified that he purchased the vehicle and allowed Eisenbach to\r\nsell it, pay him interest and a fee, and retain the excess.  Eisenbach concedes that Hall\r\nwas the original owner of the vehicle and that he merely had authority to sell the vehicle\r\non Hall's behalf.  Eisenbach further concedes that he sold the vehicle to Bailie, although\r\nhe argues that the parties agreed that title would not be transferred until Bailie finished\r\npaying the \"deposit.\"  At the time of the sale, regardless of whether title was actually signed\r\nover to Bailie at the same time, Bailie became the owner of the vehicle.  Tex. Bus. &amp; Comm.\r\nCode Ann. \u00a7 2.401(b).  At most, Eisenbach's requirement of further payments from Bailie\r\ncreated a security interest.  \r\n\r\n\tEisenbach argues that he had a greater right to possession of the vehicle than Bailie\r\nbecause Bailie had defaulted on his payments, and therefore, Eisenbach had the right to\r\nrepossess the car as long as he did not breach the peace.  There is no evidence that\r\nEisenbach was ever an owner of the vehicle or that he had the power to retain a security\r\ninterest in his own favor.  Id. \u00a7 9.102(73)(A).  Thus, Eisenbach was not a \"secured party\"\r\nentitled to repossess the vehicle.  Id.  At most, a security interest was only created in Hall's\r\nfavor.      \r\n\r\n\tHall testified that Eisenbach was not authorized to repossess the car on his\r\nbehalf--in fact, Hall testified that Eisenbach was never authorized to sell cars on an\r\ninstallment payment plan.  Eisenbach concedes in his brief that he \"did not follow the\r\ninstructions of Hall when he gave Richard Havelock-Bailie the car to use.\"  Eisenbach,\r\ntherefore, did not have authority, as Hall's agent, to repossess the car after it had been\r\nsold to a buyer.  Eisenbach was never authorized to give possession of the car to Bailie\r\nin the first place in the absence of a full payment for the car.  \r\n\r\n\tReviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational fact-finder could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Eisenbach did not have a greater\r\nright to possess the vehicle than did Bailie, the car's owner.  See Hooper, 214 S.W.3d at\r\n13.  Furthermore, viewing the evidence in a neutral light, we cannot say that \"the evidence\r\nsupporting the verdict, though legally sufficient, is nonetheless too weak to support it\" or\r\nthat \"the jury's verdict is against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.\"\r\nLancon, 253 S.W.3d at 704.  Eisenbach's sole issue is overruled. \r\n\r\nIV.  Conclusion\r\n\r\n\tHaving overruled Eisenbach's sole issue, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n                                                            \t                                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\tGINA M.
