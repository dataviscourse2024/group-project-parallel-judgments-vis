Speedlin, Justice\n\nSitting:          Sandee Bryan Marion, Justice\n                  Phylis J. Speedlin, Justice\n                  Marialyn Barnard, Justice\n\nDelivered and Filed: August 19, 2009\n\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED\n\n           The motion for rehearing filed by appellant Lawrence Dale is denied. This court\u2019s opinion\n\nand judgment dated July 29, 2009, are withdrawn, and this opinion and judgment are substituted.\n\nWe substitute this opinion to correct a factual statement in the opinion.\n\f                                                                                       04-08-00418-CR\n\n       A jury convicted Lawrence Dale with the offense of aggravated kidnapping and the trial\n\ncourt sentenced him to fifty years\u2019 confinement. On appeal, Dale contends the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by admitting Eric Zamora\u2019s testimony because (1) the testimony was offered to prove Dale\n\nacted in conformity with a character trait; (2) the testimony was not admissible to rebut Dale\u2019s\n\ndefensive theory raised during his opening statement; and (3) the probative value of the testimony\n\nwas substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Dale also contends the trial court\n\nerred in overruling his motion for a mistrial. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n                                           BACKGROUND\n\n       Around 11:15 p.m. on September 9, 2005, Jeffery Groenke told Officer William Roberts, a\n\nSan Antonio bike patrol officer, he had been sexually assaulted and robbed by a heavyset black man\n\nand a smaller Hispanic man in Apartment O of a \u201crun-down motel type place called Omar\u2019s.\u201d\n\nOfficer Roberts broadcasted Groenke\u2019s descriptions of the two men over the police radio and went\n\nto Apartment O. After seeing a bloody towel by the front door of Apartment O, Officer Roberts\n\nobtained a key to the room from the landlord and retrieved ropes, which were used to bind Groenke,\n\nfrom the trash in the apartment. Early the next morning, Officer Richard Richardson apprehended\n\ntwo men, who fit Groenke\u2019s descriptions, a mile away from the apartment. Groenke identified Dale\n\nas one of his assailants, and Dale was charged in a two-count indictment with the offenses of\n\naggravated kidnapping (Count I) and aggravated robbery (Count II).\n\n       The State waived and abandoned Count II of the indictment, and the case proceeded to trial\n\non Count I. After both sides rested, the State requested permission to re-open the evidence to present\n\nthe testimony of Eric Zamora. Zamora was the complainant in another aggravated robbery case\n\nagainst Dale. The offense against Zamora occurred a few hours after the offense against Groenke,\n\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\f                                                                                       04-08-00418-CR\n\nand Dale had Zamora\u2019s wallet when he was apprehended. The trial court overruled defense\n\ncounsel\u2019s objection and permitted the testimony to be presented. Before Zamora testified, the\n\ntrial court instructed the jury, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, you are about to hear some testimony that is\n\nbeing offered to aid you, if it does, in determining the Defendant\u2019s intent, if any, in connection with\n\nthe offense, if any, and for no other purpose.\u201d\n\n       Zamora testified he was walking home around 1:00 a.m. on September 10, 2005 when a large\n\nblack man and a smaller Hispanic man approached him for money. Zamora testified he told the men\n\nhe did not have any money, but the men kept asking him. Zamora testified the black man, who\n\nZamora later identified as Dale, told Zamora \u201che needed some pussy.\u201d Scared, Zamora pulled out\n\nhis wallet to show the men he had no money, and when Zamora looked up, Dale punched him in the\n\nface and knocked him to the ground. Zamora testified both men repeatedly kicked him and knocked\n\nhim down each time he attempted to stand up. Zamora testified the Hispanic man asked him for his\n\nwallet. After Zamora gave the Hispanic man his wallet, both men ran away. A taxicab driver\n\nstopped and drove Zamora home, and Zamora\u2019s father took him to the hospital.\n\n       Following Zamora\u2019s testimony and both parties\u2019 closing arguments, the trial court read the\n\nfollowing instruction from the jury charge with regard to Zamora\u2019s testimony:\n\n               You are instructed that if there is any testimony before you in this case\n       regarding the Defendant having committed an offense other than the case alleged\n       against him in the indictment in this case, you cannot consider said testimony for any\n       purpose unless you find and believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant\n       committed such other offense, if one was committed, and even then you may only\n       consider the same in determining the intent of the Defendant, if any, in connection\n       with the offense, if any, alleged against him in the indictment in this case, and for no\n       other purpose.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -3-\n\f                                                                                      04-08-00418-CR\n\n       The jury found Dale guilty of the offense of aggravated kidnapping and sentenced him to\n\nninety-nine years confinement.\n\n                       EXTRANEOUS BAD ACTS OR CONDUCT EVIDENCE\n\n       Dale first contends the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted Zamora\u2019s testimony\n\nbecause Zamora\u2019s testimony was inadmissible character evidence of an extraneous act. Dale\n\ncontends the State proffered the evidence to show Dale acted in conformity with the extraneous act,\n\nand the evidence had no relevance apart from character conformity.\n\n       The State, however, argues Zamora\u2019s testimony was proper rebuttal evidence that was\n\nadmissible to show Dale had the requisite intent to rob or violate or abuse Groenke sexually. Proof\n\nof this intent was necessary to establish the alleged offense of aggravated kidnapping.\n\n       We review a trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.\n\nSee Winegarner v. State, 235 S.W.3d 787, 790 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007); Montgomery v. State, 810\n\nS.W.2d 372, 391 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990) (op. on reh\u2019g). We will uphold a trial court\u2019s decision to\n\nadmit evidence so long as the decision lies within the zone of reasonable disagreement and is correct\n\nunder any theory of law applicable to the case. See Winegarner, 235 S.W.3d at 790; Montgomery,\n\n810 S.W.3d at 391.\n\n       Relevant evidence of a person\u2019s extraneous offenses, acts, or conduct is generally\n\ninadmissible to show a person acted in conformity with that character trait. TEX . R. EVID . 404(a);\n\nPowell v. State, 63 S.W.3d 435, 438 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). Under Texas Rule of Evidence 404(b),\n\nhowever, evidence of extraneous offenses, bad acts, or conduct may \u201cbe admissible for other\n\npurposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or\n\nabsence of mistake or accident.\u201d TEX . R. EVID . 404(b); see also Powell, 63 S.W.3d at 438;\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\f                                                                                     04-08-00418-CR\n\nMontgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 387-88. Additionally, evidence of a person\u2019s extraneous bad acts may\n\nbe admissible to rebut a defensive theory. Powell, 63 S.W.3d at 438. If, however, the evidence of\n\nextraneous offenses, bad acts, or conduct is only relevant to support an inference of character\n\nconformity, then \u201cit is absolutely inadmissible\u201d under Rule 404(b). Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at\n\n387.\n\n       Here, Zamora\u2019s testimony was admissible as proper rebuttal evidence to show Dale had the\n\nrequisite intent to rob or violate or abuse Groenke sexually. See Powell, 63 S.W.3d at 438;\n\nMontgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 387-88. During his opening statement, defense counsel claimed Dale\n\ncould not have committed the offense because he lacked intent, stating:\n\n           We think the evidence is going to show that Mr. Dale didn\u2019t know what to do.\n       We think the evidence is going to show that he left the scene as quickly as he could.\n       We think the evidence is going to show -- or lack of evidence is going to show no\n       intent on my client\u2019s part. No intent to take someone into a room for the purpose of\n       committing robbery; no intent on the part of my client to take someone into the room\n       for the purpose of committing some type of sexual assault; no intent on the part of\n       my client to cause physical bodily injury. That was not the intent. We think the\n       evidence is going to show pretty clearly what my client intended to do.\n\n       In this case, the trial court could have reasonably believed that Zamora\u2019s testimony rebutted\n\nDale\u2019s defensive theory that Dale did not intend to commit the alleged offense. See Montgomery,\n\n810 S.W.2d at 387-88; see also Rubio v. State, 607 S.W.2d 498, 500-01 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980)\n\n(\u201cThis Court has consistently held that when a defendant raises a defensive theory of lack of intent\n\nto wrongfully engage in criminal conduct, an extraneous offense is admissible by way of rebuttal on\n\nthe issue of intent.\u201d). Here, Zamora\u2019s testimony shows Dale was involved in a similar crime\n\ninvolving intent to commit a robbery subsequent to kidnapping Groenke. It is at least subject to\n\nreasonable disagreement that Zamora\u2019s testimony made Dale\u2019s defensive theory of lack of intent\n\nmore or less probable. See Powell, 63 S.W.3d at 438; Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 387-88 (holding\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f                                                                                      04-08-00418-CR\n\nevidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts has noncharacter conformity relevance when the evidence\n\nlogically serves to undermine a defensive theory).\n\n       Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction shows the trial court admitted the evidence\n\nfor its noncharacter conformity purpose of determining Dale\u2019s intent to commit the alleged offense.\n\nSee TEX . R. EVID . 105(a) (providing for a limiting instruction when evidence is admissible for one\n\npurpose but not admissible for another); Powell, 63 S.W.3d at 439. Therefore, we hold the trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in admitting Zamora\u2019s testimony as rebuttal evidence to establish Dale\u2019s\n\nintent to commit aggravated kidnapping.\n\n       Dale also contends Zamora\u2019s testimony was not admissible to rebut his defensive theory\n\nbecause this theory was raised only during his opening statement. Dale attempts to distinguish\n\nPowell v. State because in Powell the defensive theory was raised during cross-examination. We\n\ndisagree with Dale\u2019s reading of Powell. In Powell, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals disagreed\n\nwith the concurring opinion\u2019s assertion that an opening statement cannot open the door to the\n\nadmission of extraneous offenses and concluded that the trial court has the discretion to admit\n\nevidence of extraneous offenses to rebut a defensive theory raised during an opening statement.\n\nPowell, 63 S.W.3d at 439 (disagreeing with Justice Johnson\u2019s concurring opinion, which states an\n\nopening statement is not evidence and should not open the door to the admission of extraneous\n\noffenses as rebuttal evidence). Because Dale claimed he lacked intent to commit the offense during\n\nhis opening statement, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Zamora\u2019s testimony\n\nas rebuttal evidence. See id.\n\n       Lastly, Dale contends the trial court abused its discretion in admitting Zamora\u2019s testimony\n\nbecause its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Texas\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f                                                                                       04-08-00418-CR\n\nRule of Evidence 403 allows for the exclusion of relevant evidence if that evidence\u2019s probative value\n\n\u201cis substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading\n\nthe jury, or by considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d\n\nTEX . R. EVID . 403; see also Shuffield v. State, 189 S.W.3d 782, 786-87 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006).\n\nFavoring the admission of relevant evidence, Rule 403 \u201ccarries a presumption that relevant evidence\n\nwill be more probative than prejudicial.\u201d Shuffield, 189 S.W.3d at 787; see also Montgomery, 810\n\nS.W.2d at 389. When conducting a Rule 403 analysis, we must consider, but are not limited to, the\n\nfollowing factors: \u201c(1) how probative the evidence is; (2) the potential of the evidence to impress\n\nthe jury in some irrational, but nevertheless indelible way; (3) the time the proponent needs to\n\ndevelop the evidence; and (4) the proponent\u2019s need for the evidence.\u201d See Shuffield, 189 S.W.3d at\n\n787; see also Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 389-90.\n\n       As indicated earlier, Zamora\u2019s testimony was probative to rebut Dale\u2019s defensive theory of\n\nlack of intent. See Powell, 63 S.W.3d at 438; Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 387-88. The record\n\nshows that intent was an issue in the case. Again, Zamora\u2019s testimony described how Dale\n\nthreatened and robbed Zamora subsequent to kidnapping Groenke. See Carter v. State, No. 14-06-\n\n00115, 2007 WL 43764, at *5 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] Jan. 9, 2007, pet. ref\u2019d) (indicating\n\nevidence that appellant committed a crime in a similar manner to the charged offense two days\n\nbefore the charged offense occurred is highly relevant). The evidence was presented in a short and\n\nconcise manner and did not include unnecessarily graphic details. Further, Zamora\u2019s testimony was\n\nimmediately preceded by a verbal limiting instruction, and the jury charge also clarified that the\n\nevidence was being offered only for its noncharacter conformity purpose of determining Dale\u2019s intent\n\nto commit the alleged offense.\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\f                                                                                      04-08-00418-CR\n\n       Under the Rule 403 balancing test, the probative value of Zamora\u2019s testimony was not\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. \u201cUnfair prejudice\u201d does not mean that\n\nthe evidence injures the opponent\u2019s case; instead, unfair prejudice means the undue tendency of the\n\nevidence to suggest a decision on an improper basis. Cohn v. State, 849 S.W.2d 817, 820 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1993); Flores v. State, 125 S.W.3d 744, 746 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, no\n\npet.). Here, Zamora\u2019s testimony only suggests that Dale possessed the necessary intent to rob or\n\nviolate or abuse Groenke sexually by showing Dale was later involved in another robbery in which\n\nhe made sexual advances. While Zamora\u2019s testimony injures Dale\u2019s case, the testimony does not\n\nadversely affect Dale beyond its purpose \u2013 tending to prove his intent to commit the alleged offense\n\nof aggravated kidnapping. See Cohn, 849 S.W.2d at 820. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in admitting Zamora\u2019s testimony, and Dale\u2019s first three issues on appeal regarding the\n\nadmission of Zamora\u2019s testimony are overruled.\n\n                                             MISTRIAL\n\n       In his last issue on appeal, Dale contends the trial court abused its discretion when it\n\noverruled his motion for a mistrial. Dale contends a portion of Groenke\u2019s testimony made during\n\nhis direct examination was unresponsive to the State\u2019s questions and incurably prejudicial. Dale also\n\ncontends Groenke\u2019s use of crude language was so inflammatory and prejudicial that a court\n\ninstruction would not be sufficient to cure any prejudice.\n\n       We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for mistrial under an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard. Archie v. State, 221 S.W.3d 695, 699 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007); Hawkins v. State, 135\n\nS.W.3d 72, 77 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). A mistrial is required \u201c[o]nly in extreme circumstances,\n\nwhere the prejudice is incurable.\u201d Hawkins, 135 S.W.3d at 77. We will not substitute our judgment\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\f                                                                                       04-08-00418-CR\n\nfor the judgment of the trial court; instead, we will decide whether the trial court\u2019s decision was\n\narbitrary or unreasonable and outside the zone of reasonable disagreement. See Archie, 221 S.W.3d\n\nat 699.\n\n          During the direct examination of Groenke, the following exchange between the State and\n\nGroenke took place:\n\n                 Q: (BY MS. CUNNINGHAM) So those were the two men - -\n                 A. [Groenke] Yes.\n                 Q. Who did what to you?\n                 A. Who beat me. Who tied me up.\n                 Q. Did they make - -\n                 A. Who made me think that I was about to die. And who at one point I\n                 thought when I was under probably fucked me with a metal pipe because\n                 that\u2019s the first thing I saw when I woke up sitting - -\n                 MR. HERNANDEZ: Judge, we\u2019re going to object.\n                 THE WITNESS: - - right next to my head.\n                 MR. HERNANDEZ: It\u2019s clearly become nonresponsive to the question.\n                 THE COURT: Sustained.\n                 MR. HERNANDEZ: And we\u2019re going to move for a mistrial at this point.\n                 THE COURT: Overruled.\n\n          Here, Groenke\u2019s response was a \u201csingle, brief, unsolicited emotional statement,\u201d and his\n\nstatement did not add new facts to the evidence that was already in front of the jury. See Jones v.\n\nState, No. 05-07-01163-CR, 2009 WL 988647, at *15 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas Apr. 13, 2009, no pet.).\n\nGiven the brief and unrepeated nature of Groenke\u2019s statement regarding evidence already before the\n\njury, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling Dale\u2019s motion for a mistrial. See id.\n\nAccordingly, we overrule Dale\u2019s last issue on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f                                                                                         04-08-00418-CR\n\n                                            CONCLUSION\n\n        Based on the foregoing, we overrule Dale\u2019s issues on appeal. We modify the trial court\u2019s\n\njudgment to correct a clerical error and to reflect that Dale elected the trial court, not the jury, to\n\nassess punishment. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment as modified.\n\n\n\n                                                Phylis J.
