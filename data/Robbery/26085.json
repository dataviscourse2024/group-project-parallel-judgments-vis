Jones delivered the decision of the Court, in which\nPresiding Judge Randall M. Howe and Judge James B. Morse Jr. joined.\n\n\nJ O N E S, Judge:\n\n\u00b61           Patrick G. (Father) appeals the juvenile court\u2019s order\nterminating his parental rights to H.G. (Child). For the following reasons,\nwe affirm.\n\n                 FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\u00b62            In May 2015, the Department of Child Safety (DCS) filed a\npetition alleging Child and her three half-siblings were dependent as to\ntheir mother (Mother) based upon grounds of neglect and substance abuse.1\nAt the time, Father had approximately seven months left to serve of a 10.5-\nyear prison term imposed following his plea of guilty to armed robbery and\naggravated assault occurring in 2006 when Child was only five months\u2019 old.\nBecause both Father and Child are enrolled members of the Salt River Pima-\nMaricopa Indian Community (the Community), the Indian Child Welfare\nAct (ICWA), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901 to 1963,2 applies to the severance\nproceedings.\n\n\u00b63            Father, who had previously had no contact with Child, was\nencouraged to engage in whatever services were available to him in prison.\nIn July 2015, the juvenile court authorized visits between Child and her\npaternal uncle (Uncle), also a Community member. Uncle facilitated\ncultural activities for Child and telephone calls between Child and Father.\nFather was released on community supervision in September 2015 and\nbegan participating in urinalysis testing and supervised visitation. After\n\n\n1      We view the evidence in the light most favorable to upholding the\njuvenile court\u2019s order terminating parental rights. Yvonne L. v. Ariz. Dep\u2019t\nof Econ. Sec., 227 Ariz. 415, 422, \u00b6 27 (App. 2011) (citing Maricopa Cty. Juv.\nAction No. JD-5312, 178 Ariz. 372, 376 (App. 1994)).\n\n2     Absent material changes from the relevant date, we cite a statute\u2019s\ncurrent version.\n\n\n\n                                      2\n\f                         PATRICK G. v. DCS, et al.\n                           Decision of the Court\n\nFather demonstrated thirty days\u2019 sobriety, DCS referred Father for parent\naide services. In January 2016, Child was placed with Uncle.\n\n\u00b64            In late June 2016, Father began to feel overwhelmed, stopped\nparticipating in services, and ceased all contact with Child and DCS.\nMother continued to comply with the case plan, however, and the\ndependency was dismissed in November 2016 after Child and her half-\nsister were returned to Mother\u2019s care.3 The following month, DCS received\nreports of domestic violence and illegal drug use in Mother\u2019s home and,\nagain, removed the children. Child and her half-sister were placed with\ntheir maternal grandmother (Grandmother). Child continued to visit Uncle\non the Community reservation on weekends.\n\n\u00b65           At the time, Mother reported Father was \u201con the run for\nviolating probation.\u201d Indeed, the record shows Father had begun abusing\nalcohol and absconded from community supervision. He was eventually\ncaught and reincarcerated in December 2016 but did not attempt to contact\nChild or DCS, and DCS did not learn of his reincarceration until March\n2017.\n\n\u00b66             Meanwhile, DCS filed a second dependency petition, and the\njuvenile court adopted a case plan of severance and adoption, noting that\nFather had failed to maintain an appropriate relationship with Child or\ndemonstrate a sober and crime-free lifestyle. The court also permitted the\nCommunity to intervene. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1911(c) (granting an Indian child\u2019s\ntribe the right to intervene in \u201cany State court proceeding for the foster care\nplacement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child\u201d). DCS\npromptly filed a petition to terminate the parent-child relationship. When\nFather was released in August 2017, he began weekly supervised visits with\nChild but did not participate in any other services through DCS or the\ncriminal court.\n\n\u00b67            At the contested dependency and severance trial in October\n2017, the DCS caseworker testified Grandmother was meeting Child\u2019s\nneeds and willing to adopt her. She reported visitation with Father was\ngoing fine, but that Child, only a few days shy of her twelfth birthday, did\nnot want to live with Father because \u201che doesn\u2019t know her.\u201d Rather, Child\nwished to remain with her half-sister and would consent to an adoption by\nGrandmother.\n\n\n\n3      Child\u2019s other two half-siblings were successfully reunified with their\nfather in February 2016.\n\n\n                                      3\n\f                        PATRICK G. v. DCS, et al.\n                          Decision of the Court\n\n\u00b68            The DCS caseworker also testified that termination was in\nChild\u2019s best interests. Although Father had begun building a relationship\nwith Child when she was first removed, that relationship was damaged\nwhen he violated his community supervision and disappeared for seven\nmonths without any explanation. Thus, the caseworker surmised Child\nwould both be harmed through continuation of the unstable relationship,\nand benefitted by termination that would free her to live in a safe, stable,\npermanent, and drug- and alcohol-free home with Grandmother.\n\n\u00b69            The Community case manager testified as an ICWA expert\nthat DCS had made active efforts to preserve the Indian family, but they\nhad been unsuccessful because Father had failed to engage in services or\nremedy his deficiencies. Therefore, the expert believed Child was at risk of\nserious emotional and physical injury if left in Father\u2019s care. The expert\nadded that the Community supported Child\u2019s placement with\nGrandmother, who had been encouraging Child to maintain contact with\nFather\u2019s family.\n\n\u00b610           Father testified he had absconded because \u201c[i]t was too\nmuch,\u201d he was \u201coverwhelmed,\u201d and he \u201cdidn\u2019t know how to be a dad.\u201d By\nthe time of trial, however, Father had recently married, obtained\nemployment as a landscaper, and signed a lease on an apartment large\nenough to afford Child her own room. He believed the parenting and anger\nmanagement classes he completed in prison had remedied his negative\nbehaviors such that he could meet Child\u2019s needs. It had never occurred to\nFather to tell DCS about his new wife, and the juvenile court later took\njudicial notice of a pending family court action that revealed Child\u2019s new\nstepmother had abandoned her own four children, failed to participate in\nreunification therapy, and was facing termination of her parenting time.\nFather said he was unaware of the family court case and did not know if his\nwife or her children would act appropriately around Child.\n\n\u00b611           After taking the matter under advisement, the juvenile court\nfound that Child was dependent as to Father and that termination of his\nparental rights was warranted upon grounds of abandonment. The court\nalso found that DCS had made active efforts to provide rehabilitative\nservices to Father, those efforts had been unsuccessful, and Father\u2019s\ncontinued custody of Child would likely cause Child serious emotional or\nphysical damage. The court then terminated Father\u2019s parental rights to\n\n\n\n\n                                     4\n\f                          PATRICK G. v. DCS, et al.\n                            Decision of the Court\n\nChild.4 Father timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to\nArizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) \u00a7\u00a7 8-235(A), 12-120.21(A)(1), -2101(A)(1),\nand Arizona Rule of Procedure for the Juvenile Court 103(A).\n\n                                DISCUSSION\n\n\u00b612            Generally, the juvenile court may terminate a person\u2019s\nparental rights if it finds that a statutory ground exists and termination is\nin the child\u2019s best interests. Valerie M. v. Ariz. Dep\u2019t of Econ. Sec., 219 Ariz.\n331, 334, \u00b6 9 (2009) (citing A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8-533(B), -537(B), and Kent K. v. Bobby\nM., 210 Ariz. 279, 284, \u00b6 22 (2005)). When the child is an Indian child, ICWA\nrequires two additional findings. First, the court must find by clear and\nconvincing evidence that active efforts at \u201cremedial services and\nrehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian\nfamily\u201d were made and were unsuccessful. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d); Yvonne L.,\n227 Ariz. at 421, \u00b6 26 (App. 2011) (holding \u201cthe necessary ICWA \u2018active\nefforts\u2019 finding must . . . be made under the clear and convincing evidence\nstandard\u201d). Second, the court must make \u201ca determination, supported by\nevidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified\nexpert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or\nIndian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage\nto the child.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f).\n\n\u00b613            Father does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence to\nsustain the juvenile court\u2019s findings on the grounds for severance or Child\u2019s\nbest interests, arguing only that insufficient evidence supports the court\u2019s\nICWA findings. We review ICWA findings for an abuse of discretion and\nwill affirm so long as the record contains substantial evidence to support\nthem. See Yvonne L., 227 Ariz. at 422, \u00b6 27 (citing Audra T. v. Ariz. Dep\u2019t of\nEcon. Sec., 194 Ariz. 376, 377, \u00b6 2 (App. 1998)).\n\nI.     Unsuccessful Active Efforts\n\n\u00b614          Father argues DCS failed to make active efforts to preserve\nthe Indian family by failing to provide services or take action to strengthen\nhis bond with Child while he was incarcerated.5 Specifically, Father\n\n\n4    The juvenile court also terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights to Child.\nMother did not appeal that determination and is not a party to this action.\n\n5      DCS argues Father waived this argument by not raising the issue\nwith the juvenile court. Although a parent may waive his objection to the\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\f                          PATRICK G. v. DCS, et al.\n                            Decision of the Court\n\ncontends DCS was required to provide visitation with Child while he was\nin prison.\n\n\u00b615            In Arizona, \u201c[w]hat constitutes \u2018active efforts\u2019 will vary,\ndepending on the circumstances, the asserted grounds for severance and\navailable resources.\u201d6 S.S. v. Stephanie H., 241 Ariz. 419, 425, \u00b6 21 (App.\n2017) (citations omitted). \u201cNeither ICWA nor Arizona law mandates that\n[DCS] provide every imaginable service or program designed to prevent\nthe breakup of the Indian family before the court may find that \u2018active\nefforts\u2019 took place.\u201d Yvonne L., 227 Ariz. at 423, \u00b6 34. In an abandonment\nproceeding, \u201cactive efforts\u201d include initiatives \u201caimed at promoting contact\nby a parent with the child and encouraging that parent to embrace his or\nher responsibility to support and supervise the child.\u201d Stephanie H., 241\nAriz. at 425, \u00b6 22 (citing In re C.A.V., 787 N.W.2d 96, 103 (Iowa App. 2010)).\n\n\u00b616            The record reflects that DCS encouraged Father to participate\nin whatever services were available to him in prison. DCS placed Child\nwith Uncle and then Grandmother, both of whom demonstrated a\ncommitment to maintaining Child\u2019s connection to Father and Father\u2019s\nfamily. While incarcerated, Father participated in telephone calls with\nChild; he was then referred for weekly visitation once he was released and\nestablished his sobriety. DCS also referred Father for substance abuse\ntesting and treatment and parent aide services to assist him in proving he\nwas capable of providing a safe and stable home for Child. As a result of\nthese efforts, Father was making progress in his relationship with Child,\nwith whom he had otherwise had no contact for over a decade. Rather than\ntake advantage of these services, Father absconded from his community\n\nnature and extent of reunification services required by state statute, see\nShawanee S. v. Ariz. Dep\u2019t of Econ. Sec., 234 Ariz. 174, 178-79, \u00b6\u00b6 16-18 (App.\n2014), DCS cites no authority suggesting a parent can waive an objection to\nthe nature and extent of reunification efforts separately required by ICWA,\nand we find none. Moreover, given the fundamental nature of Father\u2019s\ninterest in the custody of his child, see Christy A. v. Ariz. Dep\u2019t of Econ. Sec.,\n217 Ariz. 299, 306, \u00b6 22 (App. 2007) (citing Mara M. v. Ariz. Dep\u2019t of Econ.\nSec., 201 Ariz. 503, 507, \u00b6 24 (App. 2002)), we choose to address the merits\nof Father\u2019s argument.\n\n6      Although Father contends the \u201cactive efforts\u201d ICWA requires are\n\u201cfar more than simply \u2018reasonable\u2019 efforts\u201d required under state law, he\ncites no Arizona authority to support that position; nor does he identify\nwhat additional services, if any, would have facilitated his relationship with\nChild.\n\n\n                                        6\n\f                          PATRICK G. v. DCS, et al.\n                            Decision of the Court\n\nsupervision and ceased all contact with Child because he did not know\n\u201chow to be a dad.\u201d Nonetheless, during his second incarceration, Father in\nfact completed parenting and anger management classes and DCS re-\nreferred Father for the same services upon his release.\n\n\u00b617            The juvenile court considered the efforts made to preserve\nChild\u2019s family and found on five separate occasions between May 2016 and\nOctober 2017 that they were \u201cactive efforts.\u201d On appeal, we \u201cdo not\nreweigh the evidence concerning the diligence exerted in attempting to\npreserve the family,\u201d Yvonne L., 227 Ariz. at 422, \u00b6 27 (citing Lashonda M. v.\nAriz. Dep\u2019t of Econ. Sec., 210 Ariz. 77, 81, \u00b6 13 (App. 2005)), because the\njuvenile court is in the \u201cbest position to weigh the evidence, observe the\nparties, judge the credibility of witnesses, and make appropriate findings,\u201d\nJesus M. v. Ariz. Dep\u2019t of Econ. Sec., 203 Ariz. 278, 280, \u00b6 4 (App. 2002) (citing\nPima Cty. Dependency Action No. 93511, 154 Ariz. 543, 546 (App. 1987)).\nMoreover, we decline to hold DCS responsible for delays and interruptions\nin services occasioned by Father\u2019s decisions to quit participating in services,\nuse alcohol, and abscond from supervision. See Yvonne L., 227 Ariz. at 423\nn.18, \u00b6 34; see also A.A. v. State, 982 P.2d 256, 261 (Alaska 1999) (explaining\nthat a \u201cparent\u2019s incarceration significantly affects the scope of the active\nefforts that the State must make to satisfy the statutory requirement\u201d). We\nfurther decline to adopt a rule requiring DCS to provide in-person prison\nvisits under all circumstances, particularly here, where Father had not had\ncontact with Child since she was an infant nearly ten years earlier and had\nno existing relationship. Substantial evidence supports the finding that\nactive efforts were made to prevent the breakup of the Indian family, and\nwe find no error.\n\n\u00b618           Father also argues DCS failed to prove the efforts were\nunsuccessful because he was rebuilding a bond with Child at the time of\ntrial. Evidence of progress is not, however, evidence of success; Child\nreported to both the DCS caseworker and ICWA expert that Father \u201cdid not\nknow her.\u201d Moreover, Father fails to account for the seven months he\nabsconded from his budding relationship with Child to abuse alcohol and\navoid the obligations of community supervision. Father\u2019s lack of\nparticipation in substance abuse testing and treatment and parent aide\nservices prevented him from establishing or maintaining a parental\nrelationship with Child. These circumstances support the juvenile court\u2019s\nfinding that the efforts to preserve the family were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\f                          PATRICK G. v. DCS, et al.\n                            Decision of the Court\n\nII.    Risk of Physical or Emotional Harm\n\n\u00b619            \u201cA determination that an Indian child will likely suffer\nserious harm if returned to the custody of the parent[] requires clear and\nconvincing evidence \u2018both that the parent\u2019s conduct is likely to harm the\nchild and that the parent is unlikely to change [his] conduct.\u2019\u201d Steven H. v.\nAriz. Dep\u2019t of Econ. Sec., 218 Ariz. 566, 571-72, \u00b6 21 (2008) (quoting E.A. v.\nState, 46 P.3d 986, 992 (Alaska 2002), and citing Thomas H. v. State, 184 P.3d\n9, 19 (Alaska 2008)). The juvenile court must consider expert testimony that\naddresses this issue, but \u201cthat expert testimony need not parrot the\nlanguage of the statute,\u201d id. at 572-73, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 29, and need not provide the\nsole basis for the court\u2019s conclusion, Brenda O. v. Ariz. Dep\u2019t of Econ. Sec., 226\nAriz. 137, 142, \u00b6 23 (App. 2010) (quoting E.A., 46 P.3d at 992).\n\n\u00b620           Father argues the ICWA expert\u2019s \u201cunsupported conclusion,\nstanding alone, cannot constitute \u2018proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d But\nthe expert\u2019s conclusion was not unsupported. The expert testified he was\nfamiliar with the facts of the case because, as the Community case manager,\nhe was \u201cin fairly constant communication with [DCS],\u201d had monthly\ncontact with Child, and reviewed all of the parties\u2019 disclosures. Nor did his\nconclusion stand alone. His opinion is supported by Father\u2019s non-\ncompliance with services, Father\u2019s decisions to abscond from community\nsupervision and engage in alcohol abuse when the stress of learning how\nto parent overwhelmed him, and Father\u2019s failure to appreciate the\ndetrimental effect of his conduct upon his relationship with Child. The\nexpert\u2019s opinion is further supported by the DCS caseworker\u2019s testimony\nthat Child would be harmed if she were removed from Grandmother\u2019s safe,\nstable home and separated from her half-sister, only to have Father repeat\nhis pattern of abandoning her when he relapsed on alcohol or felt\noverwhelmed by the day-to-day activities of parenting (which he had yet\nto undertake). In this way, the present case is distinguishable from Alma S.\nv. DCS, 778 Ariz. Adv. Rep. 24, *4, \u00b6 19 (App. 2017) (rejecting the testimony\nand conclusions of witnesses whose opinions were \u201cnot sufficiently rooted\nin the evidence\u201d).\n\n\u00b621           Father also argues DCS failed to prove he posed a risk of\nemotional or physical damage to the child because \u201cthere is no evidence\nthat Father physically or emotionally abused [Child] at any time in her\npast.\u201d ICWA does not, however, require proof of abuse; rather, the juvenile\ncourt must find the child is likely to suffer from physical or emotional\ndamage as a result of a parent\u2019s overall conduct if the child were returned\nto his care. The record contains sufficient evidence upon which the court\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\f                         PATRICK G. v. DCS, et al.\n                           Decision of the Court\n\ncould conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Child was likely to suffer\nharm if placed in Father\u2019s care. See supra \u00b6 20. We find no error.\n\nIII.   Father\u2019s Credibility\n\n\u00b622            Father argues the juvenile court erred in determining he was\nnot credible in his testimony regarding his financial circumstances. He\nargues that the record does not support this finding and that such a\nsignificant error warrants a new trial. The court committed no error.\n\n\u00b623           Father testified that he had provided financial support to\nChild while he was in prison by redirecting a per capita payment he\nreceived from the Community to Child\u2019s placements. But the juvenile court\nfound that no evidence supported Father\u2019s claim, that Father never\nreported the information to DCS, and that Father\u2019s receipt of this income\nwas generally inconsistent with the court\u2019s appointment of an attorney to\nrepresent him. After considering the circumstances, the court concluded it\n\u201cd[id] not find this testimony credible so as to rebut the abandonment otherwise\npresented.\u201d (Emphasis added).\n\n\u00b624           The State rightfully concedes that the record does not support\nany finding that Father \u201cwas not honest . . . regarding his ability to pay for\nan attorney\u201d because Father never completed a financial affidavit for that\npurpose. But the juvenile court\u2019s credibility determination did not, as\nFather suggests, \u201csignificantly impact[] the trial court\u2019s ruling in this\nmatter.\u201d By its terms, the court\u2019s credibility determination affected only the\nconclusion that Father failed to rebut the presumption of abandonment\ncreated by his failure to maintain a normal parental relationship with Child\nfor six months or longer. See A.R.S. \u00a7 8-531(A) (\u201cFailure to maintain a\nnormal parental relationship with the child without just cause for a period\nof six months constitutes prima facie evidence of abandonment.\u201d). Because\nFather does not contest the abandonment finding, any error was harmless.\n\n\n\n\n                                       9\n\f                PATRICK G. v.
