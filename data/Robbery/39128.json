A plea of not guilty was entered to each count, trial was by jury, a verdict of guilty was returned on the first, second, and fourth counts, and a verdict of not guilty was returned on *700the third count. Judgment and sentence followed on the first, second, and fourth counts.\nThis is a companion case to Goldstine v. State (1952), No. 28,833 in this court, 230 Ind. 343, 103 N. E. 2d 438. It presents the same facts and similar questions.\nThe Attorney General has admitted certain error in the case at bar.\nUpon authority of the Goldstine Case, and for the reasons given therein, the judgment is reversed, with instructions to sustain the motion to quash counts two, three, and four of the affidavit, and to sustain the motion for a new trial.\nJudgment reversed.\nNote.\u2014Reported in 103 N. E. 2d 807.\n",
