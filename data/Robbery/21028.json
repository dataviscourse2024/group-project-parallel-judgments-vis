See TEX. HEALTH &\nSAFETY CODE ANN. \u00a7 481.112(c) (West 2010).            The trial court assessed his\npunishment at confinement in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of\nCriminal Justice for a term of thirty-five years. In a single issue on appeal,\nAppellant argues that there is no evidence to support his sentence and that the trial\n\fcourt\u2019s failure to explain its reasoning for the sentence denied him due process.\nWe affirm.\n                                 Background Facts\n      Appellant was charged by indictment with one count of possession of\ncocaine with intent to deliver and one count of possession of cocaine. The first\ncount of the indictment alleged that, on or about December 10, 2010, Appellant\nknowingly possessed, with intent to deliver, a controlled substance\u2014namely,\ncocaine\u2014in an amount of one gram or more but less than four grams. The second\ncount of the indictment alleged that, on or about December 10, 2010, Appellant\nintentionally and knowingly possessed cocaine in an amount of one gram or more\nbut less than four grams. Each count of the indictment also alleged that Appellant\nhad previously been convicted of the offense of burglary of a habitation.\n      At the open plea hearing, the State waived the second count of the\nindictment based on Appellant\u2019s agreement to plead guilty to the first count.\nAppellant then pleaded \u201cguilty\u201d to the offense of possession of cocaine with intent\nto deliver and \u201ctrue\u201d to the enhancement paragraph. The trial court subsequently\nfound Appellant guilty of the first count, found the enhancement paragraph to be\ntrue, and sentenced Appellant to confinement for thirty-five years.\n                                       Analysis\n      In a single issue on appeal, Appellant argues that there is no evidence to\nsupport the trial court\u2019s infliction of \u201csuch a harsh and unreasonable punishment.\u201d\nAppellant also argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to state its factual basis for the\npunishment denied him due process.\n      As a result of the enhancement finding, Appellant was convicted of the first-\ndegree felony of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. The statutory range\nof punishment for a first-degree felony is imprisonment for a term of life or for any\nterm of not more than ninety-nine years or less than five years and a fine not to\n                                          2\n\fexceed $10,000. TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. \u00a7 12.32 (West 2011). Thus, Appellant\u2019s\n35-year sentence is within the statutory range of punishment.\n      A trial court\u2019s decision regarding what sentence to impose is a \u201cnormative\nprocess, not intrinsically factbound.\u201d Ex parte Chavez, 213 S.W.3d 320, 323 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2006).     \u201cSubject only to a very limited, \u2018exceedingly rare,\u2019 and\nsomewhat amorphous Eighth Amendment gross-disproportionality review, a\npunishment that falls within the legislatively prescribed range, and that is based\nupon the sentencer\u2019s informed normative judgment, is unassailable on appeal.\u201d Id.\nat 323\u201324 (footnote omitted). Therefore, we do not review the sentence imposed\nby the trial court under a sufficiency-of-the-evidence standard. See id.; Jarvis v.\nState, 315 S.W.3d 158, 161\u201362 (Tex. App.\u2014Beaumont 2010, no pet.).\n      As noted in the preceding paragraph, an appellant sentenced within the\napplicable punishment range may assert that his or her sentence is grossly\ndisproportionate to the offense and, therefore, constitutes cruel and unusual\npunishment.    In light of his challenge to the sentence imposed, we review\nAppellant\u2019s sentence under this framework. In reviewing a trial court\u2019s sentencing\ndetermination, \u201ca great deal of discretion is allowed the sentencing judge.\u201d\nJackson v. State, 680 S.W.2d 809, 814 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984). We will not\ndisturb a trial court\u2019s decision as to punishment absent a showing of abuse of\ndiscretion and harm. Id. As a general rule, punishment is not cruel and unusual if\nit falls within the range of punishment established by the legislature. Id.; Dale v.\nState, 170 S.W.3d 797, 799 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2005, no pet.).\n      A narrow exception to the general rule is recognized when the sentence is\ngrossly disproportionate to the offense. Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957,\n1004\u201305 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring); Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 290\u201392\n(1983); Dale, 170 S.W.3d at 799. In such cases, the sentence violates the Eighth\nAmendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Solem, 463 U.S.\n                                         3\n\fat 290; Diaz-Galvan v. State, 942 S.W.2d 185, 186 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st\nDist.] 1997, pet. ref\u2019d).   Thus, a prohibition against grossly disproportionate\npunishment survives under the Federal Constitution apart from any consideration\nof whether the punishment assessed is within the statute\u2019s range. Delacruz v.\nState, 167 S.W.3d 904, 906 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2005, no pet.). However,\n\u201c[o]utside the context of capital punishment, successful challenges to the\nproportionality of particular sentences [will be] exceedingly rare.\u201d Solem, 463\nU.S. at 289\u201390 (alterations in original) (quoting Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263,\n272 (1980)).\n      In considering a claim that a sentence is disproportionate, we first make a\nthreshold comparison of the gravity of an appellant\u2019s offense against the severity\nof his or her sentence. McGruder v. Puckett, 954 F.2d 313, 316 (5th Cir. 1992);\nDale, 170 S.W.3d at 799\u2013800. We consider the gravity of the offense in light of\nthe harm caused or threatened to the victim or society and the culpability of the\noffender. Solem, 463 U.S. at 292; Dale, 170 S.W.3d at 800. We also consider the\nsentence imposed in light of the offender\u2019s prior adjudicated and unadjudicated\noffenses. Culton v. State, 95 S.W.3d 401, 403 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.]\n2002, pet. ref\u2019d); see McGruder, 954 F.2d at 316. Only if we infer that the\nsentence is grossly disproportionate to the offense will we then compare the\nsentence received to sentences imposed for similar crimes in Texas and sentences\nimposed for the same crime in other jurisdictions. McGruder, 954 F.2d at 316;\nDale, 170 S.W.3d at 800.\n      In this cause, Appellant pleaded \u201cguilty\u201d to the offense of possession of\ncocaine with intent to deliver. Appellant also pleaded \u201ctrue\u201d to the enhancement\nallegation that he was previously convicted of the offense of burglary of a\nhabitation. At the punishment hearing, the trial court took judicial notice of the\ncontents of a \u201cPre-Sentence Investigation Report\u201d (PSI) that both parties had\n                                        4\n\fpreviously requested. The PSI detailed Appellant\u2019s extensive criminal history,\nwhich included seven additional convictions for burglary of a habitation and one\nconviction for burglary of a building. Appellant chose not to present evidence at\nthe punishment hearing, and the State offered only Appellant\u2019s pen packet.\n      Considering the nature of the charged offense and Appellant\u2019s prior criminal\nhistory, we conclude that his 35-year sentence, which falls within the midrange of\nthe applicable range of punishment, is not grossly disproportionate to the offense.\nBecause we have concluded that the sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the\noffense, we do not compare Appellant\u2019s sentence to sentences imposed for similar\ncrimes in Texas and sentences imposed for the same crime in other jurisdictions.\nMcGruder, 954 F.2d at 316; Dale, 170 S.W.3d at 800. Appellant\u2019s sole issue is\noverruled.\n                                   This Court\u2019s Ruling\n      We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     JOHN M. BAILEY\n                                                     JUSTICE\n\n\nAugust 7, 2014\nDo not publish. See TEX. R. APP.
