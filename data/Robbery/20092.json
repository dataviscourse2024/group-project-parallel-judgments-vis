(2) a state jail felony\r\ndrug conviction for which he received six months in state jail; and (3) a\r\nconviction for robbery by threat for which he was also sentenced to\r\nincarceration.\u00a0\u00a0 The prosecutor asked\r\nPrice, \u201cHave you been convicted of any other felonies outside of these three,\u201d\r\nand Price responded \u201cnot felonies.\u201d\u00a0 Price\r\nalso testified that he was on federal parole at the time of trial, that he had\r\nbeen released \u201cfrom jail\u201d in January of that year, and that he had not been\r\nreleased from \u201cthe halfway house\u201d until that July.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nIn cross-examination, appellant\r\nasked Price questions about his three felony convictions and then reminded him\r\nof his response of \u201cnot felonies.\u201d\u00a0 Price\r\nresponded that he had had misdemeanor conviction for possession of marijuana in\r\n2000. \u00a0Counsel asked Price several\r\nquestions about that misdemeanor conviction and then the following exchange\r\noccurred: \r\n\r\n[Defense]: \u00a0 And then you got another misdemeanor conviction?\r\n\r\n[State]:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objection, relevance.\r\n\r\n[Court]:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sustained.\r\n\r\n[Defense]:\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have another other convictions?\r\n\r\n[State]:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objection, Your Honor, relevance.\r\n\r\n[Court]:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 May be relevant.\u00a0 It\u2019s\r\nnot a proper question. \r\n\r\n[Defense]:\u00a0\u00a0 Have you ever been convicted of anything else?\r\n\r\n[State]:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objection, Your Honor.\r\n\r\n[Court]:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sustained.\u00a0 Sustain the\r\nobjection.\u00a0 Improper question. \r\n\r\n[Defense]:\u00a0\u00a0 What other felonies have you had?\r\n\r\n[State]:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Objection, Your Honor.\r\n\r\n[Court]:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Improper.\r\n\r\n[Defense]:\u00a0\u00a0 May I approach?\r\n\r\n[Court]:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\r\n\r\n(At the bench)\r\n\r\n[Defense]:\u00a0\u00a0 Judge, she opened the door when she was\r\nasking about his other convictions.\u00a0 I\r\nwent through the record.\u00a0 She asked the question.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[Court]:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Improper question.\u00a0 He answered it properly, not a felony.\u00a0 That was an honest answer.\u00a0 It does not open the door.\u00a0 If he had said no, it would, but it does not\r\nopen the door. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[Defense]: For the purpose\r\nof the record, I would like to ask about his other misdemeanor cases,\r\ntrespassing and the Court\u2019s not allowing me?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[Court]:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s correct. \r\n\r\n(Conclusion at the bench).\r\n\r\nAppellant made no other argument\r\nregarding the admission of any evidence regarding Price\u2019s convictions nor did\r\nhe make an offer of proof as to any specific conviction that he wished to have\r\nadmitted. \r\n\r\nB.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Argument\r\non appeal\r\n\r\nOn appeal, appellant complains that he was denied his Sixth Amendment\r\nright under the United States Constitution, and his right under Article I,\r\nSection 10 of the Texas Constitution, to confront and cross-examine Price\r\n\u201cabout his credibility,\u201d specifically by asking Price about \u201chis prior felony\r\nand misdemeanor convictions.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe first note that appellant never\r\nmade an offer of proof of the evidence that he sought to have admitted.\u00a0 This alone makes it impossible for us to\r\nreview this issue.\u00a0 The record is not\r\neven clear as to what conviction appellant sought to have admitted.\u00a0 While appellant now asserts that he sought to\r\nquestion Price about unspecified prior felony and misdemeanor convictions, his actual\r\ncomplaint at trial was that he was not allowed to ask about a misdemeanor conviction\r\nfor trespassing.\u00a0 Without an offer of\r\nproof, we cannot evaluate this complaint and error may not be predicated on\r\nthis ruling.\u00a0 See Tex. R. App. P. 103(a)(2),\r\n(b).\r\n\r\nMoreover, appellant\u2019s argument on\r\nappeal does not comport with his argument at trial.\u00a0 At trial, appellant did not complain that his\r\nrights to confrontation were being denied or that either the State or Federal\r\nConfrontation clause required the admission of the sought evidence.\u00a0 Instead, the only argument advanced at trial\r\nwas that the State had \u201copened the door\u201d by asking \u201cabout his other\r\nconvictions.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe \u201copened the door\u201d or \u201cfalse\r\nimpression\u201d legal theory for admission of prior convictions is a well-known legal\r\nprinciple that provides that, when a witness, during direct examination,\r\nunambiguously leaves a false impression that suggests that he has not been\r\narrested, charged, or convicted of an offense, the opposing party is permitted,\r\nin cross-examination of that witness, to correct this false impression.\u00a0 Delk v.\r\nState, 855 S.W.2d 700, 704 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993).\u00a0 The trial court clearly understood appellant\u2019s\r\nobjection and properly rejected it, noting that the witness\u2019s statement that he\r\nhad \u201cno [other] felonies\u201d did not leave a false impression in response to the\r\nState\u2019s question whether he had other \u201cfelony convictions,\u201d and that this\r\nanswer did not open the door to evidence of a misdemeanor conviction.\u00a0 See\r\nHammett v. State, 713 S.W.2d 102, 106\u201307 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986) (holding\r\nthat extent to which question \u201copened the door\u201d depends on specific question\r\nasked and statement that witness had one arrest does not leave false impression\r\nthat witness had no other arrests or open door to evidence of other arrests).\r\n\r\nHowever, appellant does not\r\ncomplain of the trial court\u2019s rejection of the \u201copened door\u201d/\u201dfalse impression\u201d\r\nlegal theory advanced at trial for the admission of the evidence.\u00a0 Appellant complains instead that the trial\r\ncourt did not admit evidence under a different legal theory that was not\r\nadvanced at trial and on which the trial court was not asked to rule.\r\n\r\nArguments on appeal must comport with\r\nthe arguments made at trial and must bring to the trial court\u2019s attention the\r\nvery complaint that it is now making on appeal.\u00a0\r\nSee Reyna v. State, 168 S.W.3d\r\n173, 177 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). This\r\nis true even when the complaint on appeal is that a party\u2019s right to\r\nconfrontation has been denied.\u00a0 Id. at 179\u201380.\u00a0 In order to preserve a complaint that the\r\nConfrontation Clause required admission of certain evidence, the proponent of\r\nthis evidence must clearly articulate this basis for admission to the trial\r\ncourt so that the trial court has the opportunity to rule on this rationale.[5] \u00a0Id. at\r\n179.\u00a0 Because appellant did not do so, he\r\nhas failed to preserve this issue for our review.\u00a0 See id.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe overrule appellant\u2019s first\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nII.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Testimony\r\nof Michelle Eaglin\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During\r\nher testimony, Eaglin described running up to Price, who was bleeding on the\r\nground, taking his cell phone to call for help, and calling the last number on\r\nhis cell phone.\u00a0 The number was for\r\nBlackmon\u2019s cell phone, and appellant answered the phone.\u00a0 Appellant told Eaglin that Blackmon was with\r\nhim, that he had done something wrong and was sorry, and handed the phone to\r\nBlackmon.\u00a0 Eaglin testified that Blackmon\r\nsounded very afraid, scared, weak, and was crying.\u00a0 Over appellant\u2019s objection of \u201chearsay,\u201d\r\nEaglin testified that Blackmon told her to \u201cplease tell [appellant] something\r\nbecause I\u2019m not going to be\u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to see my kids again.\u201d\u00a0 Appellant made no other objections to this\r\ntestimony.\u00a0 The testimony was admitted under\r\nthe excited utterance exception to hearsay.\u00a0\r\nSee Tex. R. Evid. 803 (2).\r\n\r\nIn his second issue on appeal, appellant complains that the\r\nadmission of this statement violated his confrontation rights under the Texas\r\nConstitution and also was an improper admission of hearsay evidence.\u00a0 For the same reasons discussed under\r\nappellant\u2019s first issue, we hold that, because there was no specific argument\r\ntendered to the trial court regarding the violation of any constitutional\r\nconfrontation right as to this evidence, appellant failed to preserve his\r\nconstitutional complaint for appellate review.\u00a0\r\nSee Reyna, 168 S.W.3d\r\nat 179.\u00a0\r\nWe furthermore hold that, in light of the evidence in this\r\nrecord regarding the condition of Blackmon at the time (weak, scared, bleeding,\r\nseriously injured from two gunshots to the abdomen, being driven away against\r\nher will by her assailant who had abused and abducted her on other occasions\r\nand threatened to kill her), the complained-of evidence was admissible under\r\nthe excited utterance exception to hearsay. See Tex. R. Evid. 803(2).\r\n\r\nWe overrule appellant\u2019s second issue.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We affirm the judgment of the trial\r\ncourt in each cause.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jim\r\nSharp\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Justice\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPanel\r\nconsists of Justices Jennings, Alcala, and Sharp.\r\n\r\nDo\r\nnot publish.\u00a0 \u00a0Tex.
