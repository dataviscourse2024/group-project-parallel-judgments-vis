CR94-129, HONORABLE CHARLES R. RAMSAY, JUDGE PRESIDING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tNorman Lee Watson was convicted of engaging in organized criminal activity.  Act\r\nof May 26, 1993, 73d Leg., R.S., ch. 761, \u00a7\u00a03, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 2966, 2967-68 (Tex. Penal\r\nCode Ann. \u00a7\u00a071.02, since amended).  Appellant waived trial by jury and entered a plea of not\r\nguilty.  The trial court found appellant guilty of the third-degree felony alleged and assessed his\r\npunishment, enhanced by two prior felony convictions, at 60 years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\tAppellant advances two points of error.  First, he challenges the legal sufficiency\r\nof the evidence to sustain the conviction because the State failed to prove the value of the property\r\nstolen as alleged in describing the underlying or predicate offense (theft) to the offense charged. \r\nSecond, appellant urges that the special theft enhancement allegation in the indictment, which was\r\nseparate and apart from the habitual criminal allegations of two prior felony convictions, was\r\n\"mere surplusage\" and could not have been properly used to increase the punishment category of\r\nthe primary offense charged.\r\n\r\n\tSection 71.02 of the Penal Code in effect at the time of the alleged offense provided\r\nin pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(a)\tA person commits an offense, if, with the intent to establish, maintain, or\r\nparticipate in a combination or in the profits of a combination, he commits or\r\nconspires to commit one or more of the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t(1)\tmurder, capital murder, arson, aggravated robbery, robbery,\r\nburglary, theft, aggravated kidnapping, kidnapping, aggravated assault,\r\naggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, forgery, deadly conduct, assault\r\npunishable as a Class A misdemeanor, burglary of a motor vehicle, or\r\nunauthorized use of a motor vehicle; . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0Except as provided in Subsection (c) of this section, an offense under this\r\nsection is one category higher than the most serious offense listed in Subdivisions\r\n(1) through (10) of Subsection (a) of this section that was committed, and if the\r\nmost serious offense is a Class A misdemeanor, the offense is a felony of the third\r\ndegree, except that if the most serious offense is a felony of the first degree, the\r\noffense is a felony of the first degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  Under section 71.02(b) set out above, the allegation of a Class A misdemeanor\r\npredicate offense would make the offense of the engaging in organized criminal activity a third-degree felony.\r\n\r\n\tIn addition to the primary offense, the indictment also alleged:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it is further presented in and to said Court, that before the commission of the\r\naforesaid above, the defendant had theretofore been convicted twice of a grade of\r\ntheft in that on the 1ST day of DECEMBER, A.D., 1981, in the DISTRICT\r\nCOURT of BEXAR County, Texas in cause number 81CR1626 on the docket of\r\nsaid court, entitled THE STATE OF TEXAS VS. ANDRE JOHNSON, said\r\nconviction being for the offense of THEFT OVER 200 UNDER 10,000.00; and\r\non the 7TH day of SEPTEMBER, A.D., 1977, in the DISTRICT COURT of\r\nBEXAR County, Texas, in cause number 77CR11768 on the docket of said court,\r\nentitled THE STATE OF TEXAS VS. ANDRE JOHNSON said conviction being\r\nfor the offense of THEFT OVER $200 UNDER $10,000.00;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThis enhancement of punishment allegation was patterned after former Penal Code\r\nsection 31.01(e)(4)(E) in effect at the time of the commission of the alleged offense.  Act of May\r\n10, 1993, 73d Leg., R.S., ch. 203, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a04, 5, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 390, 391.  Section\r\n31.01(e)(4)(E) provided:  \"(e) Except as provided by Subsection (f) of this section an offense\r\nunder this section is:  (4) a felony of the third degree if: (E) the value of the property stolen is less\r\nthan $750 and the defendant has been previously convicted two or more times of any grade of\r\ntheft.\"  It appears that this provision is specifically limited to section 31.03 (theft) and not\r\napplicable to other offenses.\r\n\r\n\tThe instant indictment also alleged two prior felony convictions, one for felony\r\ntheft (1) and one for forgery, under the provisions of section 12.42(d) of the Penal Code in effect at\r\nthe time of the commission of the primary offense.  Act of May 23, 1983, 68th Leg., R.S., ch.\r\n339, \u00a7\u00a01, 1983 Tex. Gen. Laws 1750 (Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a012.42(d), since amended).\u00a0\r\n\r\n\tWith this background, we turn to the initial contention that challenges the legal\r\nsufficiency of the evidence.  Briefly, the record reflects that on February 24, 1994, San Antonio\r\nPolice Officer Frank Randolph was told by an informant that a group including appellant was\r\nactively involved in a purse snatching scheme.  Later that morning, Randolph and other officers\r\nobserved the group going into stores in Live Oak and Universal City.  Still later, Perry Smith,\r\nanother San Antonio police officer, who was watching the group, saw their vehicle enter the\r\nparking lot of a Handy-Andy store in New Braunfels.  Claudette Lampkin, one of the group,\r\nentered the store without a purse.  Appellant followed.  The two talked and split up.  Subsequently\r\nLampkin was seen leaving the store, now clutching a purse.  Thereafter, appellant left the store\r\nand the car in which the group had been travelling moved to the front of the store to pick him up. \r\nThe officers blocked the vehicle.  Inside the car the police found a purse containing the\r\nidentification of Joan Boyd.  She testified that while shopping in the store she was approached by\r\nappellant and asked to read an orange juice coupon to him.  At the time her purse was in her\r\nshopping cart.  Later, she heard her name called out on the store's loudspeaker system.  At the\r\nfront of the store she identified her purse, not having noticed it missing.  This was the purse found\r\nin the group's car.\r\n\r\n\tAppellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to establish the value of the\r\npurse, the only item allegedly stolen, at $200 or more.  On direct examination of Mrs. Boyd, the\r\nprosecutor did not establish value of any kind.  On cross-examination, defense counsel informed\r\nthe trial court that the police report indicated that value of the purse and its contents was about\r\n$215.  Counsel then elicited from Mrs. Boyd that the purse was valued at $25, and that the purse\r\ncontained at the time about $50 in cash, eyeglasses worth $100, sunglasses and a checkbook.  No\r\nvalue was placed on these latter two items.  The State concedes that since the purse was the only\r\nitem allegedly stolen the evidence is legally insufficient to establish the value alleged at $200 or\r\nmore but less than $750.  Appellant urges that he is entitled to an acquittal.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tIn Bigley v. State, 865 S.W.2d 26, 28 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993), the Court of\r\nCriminal Appeals held that Rule 80 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure (2) gives a court of\r\nappeals the authority to reform a judgment to reflect a conviction on a lesser-included offense\r\nupon a determination that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for the greater\r\noffense but would support a conviction for the lesser-included offense.  A jury convicted the\r\ndefendant of possession of 400 grams or more of methamphetamine.  The State proved that the\r\ndefendant possessed 388.76 grams of pure methamphetamine which supported the lesser-included\r\noffense of possession of 28 grams or more but less than 400 grams of methamphetamine, which\r\nissue was submitted to the jury, but it did not support the offense for which the jury convicted the\r\ndefendant.  On appeal, the judgment was reformed under the authority of Rule 80 to reflect a\r\nconviction for the lesser-included offense finding support in the evidence.  Bigley v. State, 831\r\nS.W.2d 409 (Tex. App.--Austin 1992) (op. on reh'g).  The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed\r\nsuch action.  Judge Baird concurred that the reformation was not jeopardy barred because the\r\nissue of the lesser-included offense had been submitted to the jury.  Bigley, 865 S.W.2d at 29\r\n(Baird, J., concurring).  See also Doherty v. State, 892 S.W.2d 13, 17 (Tex. App.--Houston [1st\r\nDist.] 1994, pet. ref'd); Griffin v. State, 866 S.W.2d 754, 756-57 (Tex. App.--Tyler 1993, no\r\npet.); Thorpe v. State, 831 S.W.2d 548, 552 (Tex. App.--Austin 1992, no pet.).\r\n\r\n\tThe instant case was a bench trial.  There was no jury charge.  However, a trial\r\ncourt is authorized to find a defendant guilty for any lesser-included offense for which the\r\nevidence provides the required proof.  Shute v. State, 877 S.W.2d 314, 315 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n1994); Cunningham v. State, 726 S.W.2d 151, 153 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987); Mello v. State, 806\r\nS.W.2d 875, 877 (Tex. App.--Eastland 1991, pet. ref'd).  In finding a defendant guilty of the\r\ngreater offense the trial court necessarily finds the evidence sufficient to convict the defendant of\r\nthe lesser-included offense.  Shute, 877 S.W.2d at 315.  The double jeopardy provisions of the\r\nfederal and state constitutions do not prohibit a retrial for a lesser-included offense when the first\r\ntrial was before the trial court and there was sufficient evidence on which the trial court could\r\nhave found a defendant guilty of the lesser-included offense.  Id.\r\n\r\n\tThe instant judgment reflects a conviction for the primary offense of engaging in\r\norganized criminal activity, a third-degree felony based on the underlying class A misdemeanor\r\ntheft offense.  The evidence, as conceded by the State, is insufficient to support this conviction.\r\nHowever, because the evidence established that the purse stolen had a value of $25, there was\r\nevidence to support the lesser-included offense of engaging in organized criminal activity based\r\non the lesser underlying class B misdemeanor theft offense (3) (enhanced to a class A misdemeanor\r\nby Section 71.02(b)).\r\n\r\n\tBy virtue of Rule 80, we reform the judgment to reflect a conviction for engaging\r\nin organized criminal activity, a Class A misdemeanor, based on the predicate offense of a Class\r\nB misdemeanor theft.  See Bigley, 865 S.W.2d at 28.  The judgment of conviction, as reformed,\r\nis affirmed as to the adjudication of guilt but the cause is remanded to the trial court for a new\r\nhearing on punishment.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.29(b) (West Supp. 1996).  The first\r\npoint of error is overruled.\r\n\r\n\tIn regard to the new hearing on punishment, we observe that punishment for a class\r\nA misdemeanor cannot be enhanced by section 12.42(d) of the Penal Code, which is applicable\r\nonly to felonies by its express terms.  Cf. Ortiz v. State, 626 S.W.2d 586, 588-89 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp. 1981); Clifton v. State, 246 S.W.2d 201, 203 (Tex. Crim. App. 1952) (op. on reh'g)\r\n(holding that a prior misdemeanor may not be utilized to enhanced a punishment for a subsequent\r\nfelony conviction because the statutes do not so provide).\r\n\r\n\tIn the second point of error, appellant contends that the \"paragraph of the\r\nindictment alleging the theft enhancement provision of the Penal Code [Section 31.03(e)(4)(E)]\"\r\nwas mere surplusage and could not be used to enhance punishment.  These allegations have been\r\nset out earlier in the opinion.  Appellant's complaint about an irregularity in the indictment is\r\nraised for the first time on appeal.  His failure to object to the form or substance of the indictment\r\nprior to trial constitutes a waiver of the error, if any.  See Tex. Const. art. V, \u00a7\u00a012(b); Tex. Code\r\nCrim. Proc. Ann. \u00a7\u00a01.14(b); Fisher v. State, 887 S.W.2d 49, 54 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994); Studer\r\nv. State, 799 S.W.2d 263, 268, 273 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).  Moreover, if the allegations were\r\nindeed surplusage and were not used, the inclusion in the indictment would be a harmless\r\nirregularity, if any, under the circumstances of the instant case.\r\n\r\n\tIt appears that the State attempted to use two methods to convert the instant offense\r\nof engaging in organized criminal activity into a third-degree felony so that the habitual criminal\r\nallegations (4) in the indictment could be utilized.  First, the State relied upon the provisions of\r\nsection 71.02(b) (engaging in organized criminal activity) to convert the alleged underlying class\r\nA misdemeanor theft into a third-degree felony.  Second, the State attempted to use the section\r\n31.03(e)(4)(E) provision of the general theft statute to convert the instant offense into a third-degree felony.  As to the first method, the proof failed.  As to the second method, it is clear that\r\nsection 31.03(e)(4)(E) is applicable only to a theft conviction \"under this section\" meaning the\r\ngeneral theft statute [section 31.03].\r\n\r\n\tSection 31.03(e)(4)(E) and its forerunners created a new theft offense of a felony\r\ngrade where there were two or more theft convictions of any grade and the instant offense is a\r\nmisdemeanor theft offense where the value of the property stolen is less than $750 (formerly less\r\nthan $200).  Diamond v. State, 530 S.W.2d 586, 587 (Tex. Crim. App. 1975); Chambers v.\r\nState, 736 S.W.2d 192, 195 (Tex. App.--Dallas 1987, no pet.) (citing Gant v. State, 606 S.W.2d\r\n867, 871 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980)); cf. Meshell v. State, 841 S.W.2d 895, 896 (Tex. App.--Corpus\r\nChristi 1992, no pet.).  It has been held that an offense of credit card abuse is not a theft offense\r\nand that it cannot be used to invoke section 31.03(e)(4)(E) even if there are two or more theft\r\nconvictions.  Colquitt v. State, 650 S.W.2d 128, 128 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1983, no\r\npet.); see also Meshell, 841 S.W.2d at 896.  Likewise, burglary is not a theft offense for the\r\npurpose of section 31.03(e)(4)(E).  Chambers, 736 S.W.2d at 195.  We also conclude that\r\nengaging in organized criminal activity as prohibited in section 71.02 is not a theft offense for the\r\npurpose of section 31.03(e)(4)(E), even if the underlying offense is a theft offense.\r\n\r\n\tThe instant indictment charged appellant with the offense of engaging in organized\r\ncriminal activity, a third-degree felony as alleged.  At the guilt stage of the bifurcated bench trial,\r\nthe trial court found appellant guilty \"as charged.\"  The judgment reflects that the conviction was\r\nfor \"engaging in organized criminal activity.\"  It appears that the trial court found appellant guilty\r\nof the primary offense alleged as a third-degree felony and enhanced punishment by virtue of the\r\ntwo prior felony convictions alleged to establish a habitual criminal status.  The complained-of\r\nallegations were not used.  The second point of error is overruled.\r\n\r\n\tThe judgment is reformed to show a Class A misdemeanor conviction for engaging\r\nin organized criminal activity.  As reformed, the judgment is affirmed as to the conviction.  The\r\njudgment is reversed as to punishment and the cause is remanded to the trial court for a new\r\nhearing on punishment consistent with this opinion.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc.
