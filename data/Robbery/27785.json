Appellant asserts that he was denied\n\nthe right to a speedy parole violation hearing. After careful review, we affirm.\n\n       The factual background and procedural history was derived from the\n\njoint stipulations of fact filed by both parties for the hearing held on Appellant\u2019s\n\nmotion for dismissal of his parole violations.1 On August 2, 2013, Appellant\n\npled guilty to Simple Assault (18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2702) and Harassment (18\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n* Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior Court.\n1 \u201cA stipulation of facts is binding and conclusive on a trial court, although the\ncourt may nonetheless draw its own legal conclusions from those facts.\u201d\nMader v. Duquesne Light Co., ___Pa.___, 241 A.3d 600, 615 (Pa. 2020)\n(citation omitted).\n\fJ-S08035-21\n\n\n\nPa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2709). On the same day, the trial court sentenced Appellant to\n\nthirty-seven days to twenty-three months\u2019 incarceration.        The trial court\n\nindicated that Appellant would need to receive a parole plan and would be\n\nsubject to the standard terms and conditions of the probation department.\n\nNotes of Testimony (N.T.), 8/2/13, at 8. Appellant was paroled and released\n\nfrom imprisonment on August 13, 2013.\n\n      Three months later, on November 14, 2013, a criminal complaint was\n\nfiled alleging that Appellant wrote a bad check to The Bike Shop in York\n\nCounty, Pennsylvania. Stipulation of Fact (\u201cStipulation\u201d), 8/31/20, at \u00b6 4. A\n\nwarrant was issued for Appellant\u2019s arrest on those charges which were\n\nsubsequently docketed at CP-67-CR-0000401-2020, as discussed infra.\n\n      In addition, on November 14, 2013, the York County Adult Probation\n\nDepartment filed a petition for the issuance of an absconder\u2019s warrant as\n\nAppellant\u2019s whereabouts were unknown. The petition alleged that Appellant\n\ncommitted multiple parole violations as he failed to attend a scheduled\n\nappointment, did not make contact with his parole officer, moved without\n\npermission, failed to report his new address, failed to pay his court costs and\n\nfees, and failed to submit to a drug and alcohol evaluation. Petition for Parole\n\nViolation, 11/14/13, at \u00b6 2.   The York County Adult Probation Department\n\nattached an absconder warrant form, which stated \u201cextradition is not\n\nauthorized.\u201d Warrant, 11/14/13, at 1. The lower court signed the submitted\n\nwarrant form that same day.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fJ-S08035-21\n\n\n\n      On November 15, 2013, Appellant was arrested in Boulder, Colorado\n\nand charged with disorderly conduct.     Stipulation at \u00b6 6. Colorado officials\n\nmade an inquiry to the National Crime Information Center database (NCIC);\n\nAppellant allegedly told these officials that he had a warrant for his arrest in\n\nPennsylvania. Stipulation at \u00b6 7. N.T., Parole Revocation Hearing, 8/31/20,\n\nat 20. Appellant was sentenced to a year of probation in Colorado, during\n\nwhich York County did not lodge a detainer or request that Appellant be\n\nextradited back to Pennsylvania. N.T., 8/31/20, at 20-21.\n\n      On November 26, 2013, Appellant failed to appear at a pre-trial\n\nconference in a third criminal case in York County, in which he had been\n\ncharged with theft by deception and writing a bad check. Stipulation at \u00b6 8.\n\nThis case had been docketed at CP-67-CR-0006003-2013.\n\n      On December 15, 2015, Appellant was arrested in Hillsboro, Oregon.\n\nStipulation at \u00b6 10-11. On December 17, 2015, the Oregon Department of\n\nCorrections (DOC) inquired as to whether Pennsylvania authorities wished to\n\nextradite Appellant. On December 21, 2015, Sergeant Weyth Barley of the\n\nYork Area Regional Police Department responded to the Oregon DOC by\n\nfacsimile, stating \u201c[o]ur District Attorney will not authorize extradition from\n\nOregon and we will keep our warrant in the system. Thank you for letting our\n\ndepartment know he was in custody.\u201d Fax (Exhibit A), at 1.\n\n      The prosecution subsequently explained that the York County District\n\nAttorney\u2019s Office did not extradite Appellant from Colorado or Oregon in\n\naccordance with its policy to extradite defendants only from states bordering\n\n                                     -3-\n\fJ-S08035-21\n\n\n\nPennsylvania, as well as Virginia, due to the expense of extradition from\n\ndistant states. Stipulation at \u00b6 11-13; N.T., 8/31/20, at 12. The prosecution\n\nagain claimed that Appellant\u2019s absconder warrant was non-extraditable. N.T.,\n\n8/31/20, at 32. Appellant admits that he was sentenced to serve 48 months\u2019\n\nimprisonment in Oregon and indicated that he served 39 months of this\n\nsentence before being released. N.T., 8/31/20, at 24.\n\n      On October 3, 2019, Appellant was arrested in Austin, Texas.\n\nStipulation at \u00b6 14. Thereafter, Appellant\u2019s mother contacted the York County\n\nDistrict Attorney requesting that Appellant be extradited to Pennsylvania.\n\nStipulation at \u00b6 15. On October 16, 2019, the York County Regional Police\n\nDepartment received approval to extradite         Appellant from Texas to\n\nPennsylvania. Stipulation at \u00b6 16.\n\n      On October 18, 2019, the Travis County Jail in Texas notified the York\n\nCounty District Attorney\u2019s Office that extradition would not be permitted until\n\nAppellant\u2019s pending case in Texas was resolved. Stipulation at \u00b6 17. When\n\nAppellant\u2019s prosecution in Texas had concluded, Appellant waived extradition\n\nand was transported to the York County Prison on December 22, 2019.\n\nStipulation at \u00b6 19-20; N.T., 8/13/20, at 7.\n\n      On December 23, 2019, the lower court revoked Appellant\u2019s bail on his\n\ntwo outstanding criminal dockets (CP-67-CR-0006003-2013 and CP-67-CR-\n\n0000401-2020), remanded Appellant to the York County Prison, and ordered\n\na parole violation hearing for February 4, 2020. Appellant\u2019s parole violation\n\nhearing was continued multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fJ-S08035-21\n\n\n\nAppellant\u2019s outstanding criminal charges were ultimately dismissed pursuant\n\nto Pa.R.Crim.P. 600. Stipulation at \u00b6 21; N.T., 8/31/20, at 19.2\n\n       Appellant filed a motion to dismiss this parole violation pursuant to\n\nPennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 708 as he argued that his violation\n\nhearing was not held in a speedy manner. On August 31, 2020, the lower\n\ncourt held a violation of parole (VOP) hearing on the motion where the parties\n\nsubmitted their joint stipulation of the facts.\n\n       At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court denied Appellant\u2019s\n\nmotion to dismiss under Rule 708, finding Appellant was not prejudiced by the\n\ndelay in his parole revocation hearing. As Appellant did not contest that the\n\nprosecution had presented evidence of his violation of parole, the lower court\n\nrevoked Appellant\u2019s parole and sentenced him to the remaining balance of 655\n\ndays\u2019 imprisonment with 254 days credit for time served, and somewhat\n\nsurprisingly granted Appellant immediate parole. N.T., 8/31/20, at 38-40.\n\n       As the lower court recognized that there was an outstanding detainer\n\nfor Appellant in Maryland, the lower court directed Appellant to \u201creport in\n\nperson to the York County Probation Department \u2026 within 48 hours of his\n\nrelease from custody in all jurisdictions.\u201d N.T., 8/31/20, at 40-41.\n\n       Appellant filed a timely appeal and complied with the lower court\u2019s\n\ndirection to file a Concise Statement of Errors Complained of on Appeal\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2Court docket sheets show that the charges in CP-67-CR-0006003-2013 and\nCP-67-CR-0000401-2020 were dismissed on September 22, 2020.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fJ-S08035-21\n\n\n\npursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). Appellant raises the following issue for review\n\non appeal:\n\n      Whether the court erred in denying [Appellant\u2019s] Motion to\n      Dismiss Parole Violation Pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 708 where\n      [Appellant\u2019s] parole violation hearing was delayed nearly seven\n      years after the alleged violations occurred, the Commonwealth\n      failed to act with due diligence in scheduling the hearing \u201cas\n      speedily as possible\u201d despite being aware of [Appellant\u2019s]\n      whereabouts for years, and [Appellant] was prejudiced as a result.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief, at 4.\n\n      Appellant\u2019s sole claim on appeal challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to\n\ndismiss his parole violation pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure 708, which provides in pertinent part:\n\n      (B) Whenever a defendant has been sentenced to probation or\n      intermediate punishment, or placed on parole, the judge shall not\n      revoke such probation, intermediate punishment, or parole as\n      allowed by law unless there has been:\n\n      (1) a hearing held as speedily as possible at which the defendant\n      is present and represented by counsel; and\n\n      (2) a finding of record that the defendant violated a condition of\n      probation, intermediate punishment, or parole.\n\nPa.R.Crim.P. 708(B).\n\n      In addressing similar challenges under Rule 708, this Court has provided\n\nthe following guidance:\n\n         [t]he language \u201cspeedily as possible\u201d has been interpreted\n         to require a hearing within a reasonable time. Rule 708 does\n         not establish a presumptive period in which the\n         Commonwealth must revoke probation; but instead, the\n         question is whether the delay was reasonable under the\n         circumstances of the specific case and whether the appellant\n         was prejudiced by the delay.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fJ-S08035-21\n\n\n                                    ***\n\n        In evaluating the reasonableness of a delay, the court\n        examines three factors: the length of the delay; the reasons\n        for the delay; and the prejudice resulting to the defendant\n        from the delay.\n\n     Commonwealth v. Woods, 965 A.2d 1225, 1227 (Pa.Super.\n     2009) (quoting Commonwealth v. Clark, 847 A.2d 122, 123\u201324\n     (Pa.Super. 2004)).\n                                      ***\n            When examining the reasons for the delay, the court looks\n     at the circumstances surrounding the delay to determine whether\n     the Commonwealth acted with due diligence in scheduling the\n     revocation hearing. Clark, supra at 124. The court should not\n     fault the Commonwealth for delays resulting from the Department\n     of Corrections' inability to find, transport, or house defendants in\n     their custody. Id. at 125. Similarly, a court should not attribute\n     to the Commonwealth delays caused by the defendant.\n     Commonwealth v. Gaus, 300 Pa.Super. 372, 446 A.2d 661,\n     663\u201364 (1982) (holding only two months of four year and eight\n     month delay attributable to Commonwealth where defendant fled\n     and concealed his whereabouts for four years and six months).\n     Nonetheless, where the Commonwealth provides no explanation\n     for the delay, the court should not attribute the delay to the\n     defendant; instead, the court should analyze whether the delay\n     prejudiced the defendant. Woods, supra.\n\n           To demonstrate a violation of his right to a speedy probation\n     revocation hearing, a defendant must allege and prove the delay\n     in holding the revocation hearing prejudiced him. Woods, supra\n     at 1229; Clark, supra at 125; Bischof, supra at 9. There is no\n     per se rule of prejudice for technical violations of the Rules of\n     Criminal Procedure. Commonwealth v. Marchesano, 519 Pa. 1,\n     7\u20138, 544 A.2d 1333, 1336\u201337 (1988) (holding defendant cannot\n     establish prejudice merely by alleging court held probation\n     revocation hearing after defendant's period of probation expired).\n     \u201c[T]he controlling consideration at a revocation hearing is whether\n     the facts presented to the court are probative and reliable and not\n     whether traditional rules of procedure have been strictly\n     observed.\u201d Id. at 6\u20137, 544 A.2d at 1336.\n\n        Prejudice in this context has been interpreted as being\n        something which would detract from the probative value\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fJ-S08035-21\n\n\n         and reliability of the facts considered, vitiating the reliability\n         of the outcome itself. One specific purpose of our rule in\n         requiring a prompt revocation hearing is to avoid such\n         prejudice by preventing the loss of essential witnesses or\n         evidence, the absence of which would contribute adversely\n         to the determination. Another is to prevent unnecessary\n         restraint of personal liberty.\n\n      Id. at 7, 544 A.2d at 1336. If a defendant is already incarcerated\n      on the charges that triggered the probation revocation, he cannot\n      claim the delay in holding his revocation hearing caused him any\n      loss of personal liberty. Clark, supra; Bischof, supra at 9.\n      Likewise, where a conviction on new charges conclusively\n      establishes the defendant's probation violation, the defendant\n      cannot claim a delay in his VOP hearing prejudiced him because\n      he lost favorable witnesses and evidence. Bischof, supra.\n\nCommonwealth v. Christmas, 995 A.2d 1259, 1262\u201364 (Pa.Super. 2010)\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n      As noted above, Appellant argues that the nearly seven-year period\n\nbetween his parole violations and his hearing was unreasonable delay that\n\nviolated the requirement that his VOP hearing be held \u201cas speedily as\n\npossible.\u201d Pa.R.Crim.P. 708(B)(1). While we note that the seven-year period\n\nbetween Appellant\u2019s admitted parole violations and his violation hearing was\n\nsignificant delay, we do not find that dismissal was appropriate simply based\n\non the length of the delay as Rule 708 does not establish a presumptive period\n\nin which the Commonwealth must revoke parole. Christmas, supra.\n\n      Appellant claims that the Commonwealth failed to exercise due diligence\n\nwhen it declined to extradite him to Pennsylvania despite having ample\n\nopportunity to do so when Appellant was in custody in Colorado and Oregon\n\nwhere there were no legal impediments to his extradition. In response, the\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fJ-S08035-21\n\n\n\nCommonwealth asserts that it had a reasonable extradition policy that\n\nrestrained the prosecution at that time to limit extradition from states\n\nbordering Pennsylvania (and Virginia) due to the expense of extraditing\n\ndefendants from distant states.3           In addition, the Commonwealth notes\n\nAppellant was subject to delay attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, which\n\nwas beyond the prosecution\u2019s control.\n\n       In its Rule 1925(a) opinion, the lower court did not analyze the reasons\n\nfor the delay or whether the Commonwealth exercised due diligence in seeking\n\nto make Appellant available for the parole violation hearing, but instead\n\nconcluded that Appellant failed to show he was prejudiced by the delay in his\n\nparole revocation hearing. We agree.\n\n       Appellant admits that he was not prejudiced in the preparation of his\n\ndefense by the delay in the hearing as he stipulated to his technical parole\n\nviolations and concedes the delay did not result in a loss of evidence or the\n\nunavailability of witnesses.\n\n       Further, we are not persuaded by Appellant\u2019s assertion that he was\n\nprejudiced through unnecessary restraint on his personal liberty.         After\n\nAppellant was granted parole in this case, he immediately fled the jurisdiction\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3 We observe that our Court has held the Commonwealth accountable for\nunexplained delay in lodging a detainer or initiating extradition proceedings\nfor speedy trial purposes under Pa.R.Crim.P. 600. Commonwealth v.\nMorgan, 239 A.3d 1132, 1140 (Pa.Super. 2020). Further, this Court found\nin Morgan that the Commonwealth did not exercise due diligence in failing to\ntake action on its detainer and extradition request for six years. Id. at 1141.\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fJ-S08035-21\n\n\n\nand went to Colorado without any regard for his parole obligations in\n\nPennsylvania.      During this extended period of time between his parole\n\nviolations and his hearing, Appellant was arrested multiple times in Colorado,\n\nOregon, and Texas for new charges, was sentenced to a year of probation in\n\nColorado, and served thirty-nine months in an Oregon prison as a result of\n\nnew convictions. When Appellant eventually returned to Pennsylvania, he was\n\nnot solely incarcerated due to his parole violation, but he faced criminal\n\ncharges on two other dockets in York County.4\n\n       Thus, the restraint on Appellant\u2019s liberty was attributable to Appellant\u2019s\n\nmultiple criminal charges and convictions that were unrelated to his pending\n\nparole violation hearing. Appellant has not shown prejudice from the delay in\n\nhis parole revocation hearing as he was not imprisoned longer than he\n\notherwise would have been. See Clark, supra (finding that the appellant was\n\nnot prejudiced because of the delay in his probation revocation hearing as he\n\n\u201cwas not imprisoned longer than he otherwise would have been\u201d when he was\n\nserving his sentence on the underlying conviction\u201d).\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n4 Moreover, we observe that at the time of Appellant\u2019s parole revocation\nhearing, Appellant also faced criminal prosecution for charges he committed\nin Maryland where a detainer had been issued for his return. Interestingly,\nwhen the lower court inquired as to why Maryland had not sought to compel\nAppellant\u2019s appearance prior to his extradition to Pennsylvania, the prosecutor\nindicated that Maryland authorities were unwilling to extradite Appellant from\nnonbordering states, but lodged a detainer once Appellant was brought to\nPennsylvania. N.T., 8/31/20, at 17-18.\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\fJ-S08035-21\n\n\n\n     For these reasons, we conclude the trial court did not err in finding that\n\ndismissal of Appellant\u2019s motion pursuant to Rule 708 was proper as Appellant\n\ndid not show prejudice from the delay in his parole revocation hearing.\n\n     Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
