Appellant was charged with\n\nmisdemeanor theft for stealing two of these items. After she was convicted, the trial judge placed\n\nher on probation and, as a condition of probation, imposed restitution for some of the missing items\n\nthat appellant had not been charged with stealing. Evidence in the record showed the value of these\n\nitems.

BACKGROUND\n\n                                               A. Trial\n\n        Daniel McCoy testified that in December of 2010 his truck was burglarized. An iPod and\n\nseveral other items were stolen. Scott Blair testified that his truck was burglarized at around the same\n\ntime. A GPS unit and several other items were stolen. The iPod and GPS were recovered from\n\npawn shops, and appellant was identified as the person who had pawned them. Appellant was\n\ncharged by information with two Class B misdemeanors for the theft of the iPod and the GPS.2 At\n\ntrial, the complainants identified their iPod and GPS and testified to their value. Each complainant\n\nalso testified to the value of the other items that had been stolen at the same time as the iPod and\n\nGPS. A jury found appellant guilty of both offenses. After appellant was found guilty, the jury was\n\ndischarged, and the trial court conducted a punishment hearing.\n\n        At the punishment hearing, the trial court indicated that it intended to assess punishment at\n\nsix months\u2019 confinement, probated for one year, and assess an unprobated fine of $500 in each case.\n\nThe State asked if there would be \u201cany monetary restitution.\u201d The trial court agreed that there should\n\nbe, and the State discussed the amount of loss suffered by the complaining witnesses. The State\n\nacknowledged that the items appellant was charged with stealing\u2014the iPod and GPS\u2014were\n\nrecovered in working order. However, there were other items that were not recovered, and their\n\n\n        1\n            6 S.W.3d 530 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).\n       2\n            TEX .

As a condition of\n\nprobation, the court required restitution of $1,215 to be paid to the complaining witnesses to\n\ncompensate them for the loss of the unrecovered items.\n\n                                             B. Appeal\n\n       On appeal, appellant argued, among other things, that the restitution requirement was not\n\nsupported by evidence. The court of appeals agreed, holding that the restitution requirement lacked\n\nany factual basis in the record.3 In response to the State\u2019s argument that appellant had waived any\n\nchallenge to the restitution requirement by failing to object, the court of appeals relied upon Mayer4\n\nand Idowu5 for the proposition that due process requires that the amount of restitution be supported\n\nby a factual basis within the record.6 The court of appeals deleted the restitution requirement from\n\nthe conditions of probation and affirmed the judgments as modified.7\n\n                                     C.

The State also argued that, if appellant had not forfeited her claim,\n\nthe proper remedy would be to set aside the grant of community supervision, including the restitution\n\nrequirement, and remand for a new punishment hearing. We granted review to consider both issues.8\n\n                                            II. ANALYSIS\n\n        Ordinarily, to preserve an issue for appellate review, an appellant must have first raised the\n\nissue in the trial court.9 However, it is also ordinarily true that a claim regarding sufficiency of the\n\nevidence need not be preserved for review at the trial level.10 But, \u201cimposition of a sentence is\n\nprofoundly different from the granting of community supervision.\u201d11 Concepts of error-preservation\n\nthat apply in non-probation cases do not necessarily carry over to probation cases because probation\n\ninvolves a kind of contractual relationship that does not exist in non-probation cases.\n\n        In Speth v. State, we held that, when probation is granted, the trial court extends clemency\n\nto the defendant and creates a sort of contractual relationship.12 Conditions of probation that are not\n\nobjected to are affirmatively accepted as terms of the contract,13 unless the condition is one that the\n\ncriminal justice system finds to be intolerable and is therefore not a contractual option available to\n\n\n        8\n          (1) Must the defendant object at trial to complain on appeal about a condition of\ncommunity supervision requiring payment of restitution for an offense with which the defendant was\nnot charged?\n         (2) What is the appropriate remedy for an unauthorized restitution order as a condition of\ncommunity supervision when the trial court assesses punishment?\n        9\n             TEX .

This is true even if appellant\u2019s connection to the theft of these items was not\n\nspecifically established, as long as she had the opportunity to object and challenge such a connection.\n\nA trial objection would have given the trial court the opportunity to reconsider the condition of\n\nprobation or to reconsider the appropriateness of the probation contract without the objected-to\n\ncondition.15 The record in the present case establishes that the restitution requirement was discussed\n\nduring the punishment stage hearing, so appellant had an opportunity to object to it.16 Consequently,\n\nin accordance with Speth, she forfeited her complaint.\n\n        The cases cited by the court of appeals do not resolve the issue before us. The defendant in\n\nMayer did not receive probation, so there was no \u201ccontract.\u201d17 Restitution was a condition of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s probation in Idowu, but we declined to decide whether a sufficiency claim could be\n\nforfeited because there was a factual basis for the amount of restitution ordered.18\n\n        We need not determine whether appellant\u2019s complaint in the present case relates to the\n\n\u201cappropriateness\u201d of restitution or to its \u201cfactual basis\u201d because, by failing to object to the restitution,\n\n\n\n\n        14\n             Gutierrez v.

The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed,\n\nand the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\nDelivered: October 1, 2014\nPublish\n\n\n\n\n       19\n            See Speth, 6 S.W.3d at 534.\n       20\n           The State contends that the claim here is one of \u201cauthorization\u201d rather than \u201csufficiency.\u201d\nThese concepts are not necessarily helpful, though, because the two concepts can overlap: in the\nusual sufficiency claim, the \u201csufficiency\u201d of the evidence is measured against allegations that are\n\u201cauthorized\u201d by the indictment. See Malik v. State, 953 S.W.2d 234, 240 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997);\nCurry v. State, 30 S.W.3d 394, 404 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (a sufficiency review must be based\nupon the statutory elements of the offense \u201cas modified by the charging instrument.\u201d). We have\napplied Malik\u2019s general framework to at least some punishment issues. Roberson v. State, 420\nS.W.3d 832, 841 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). Given our disposition on the basis of Speth, we need not\ndecide whether Malik\u2019s principles would require incorporating the charging instrument\u2019s allegations\ninto a sufficiency review of the factual basis for restitution. Moreover, appellant is estopped from\ncomplaining because she accepted the benefit of the contract: probation.\n\f",
