AP-75,159\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEX PARTE PHILIP TANKSLEY, Applicant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON APPLICATION FOR A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE 214TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT OF NUECES COUNTY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tPer Curiam.\r\n\r\nO P I N I O N\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThis is a post-conviction application for a writ of habeas corpus forwarded to this\r\nCourt pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 11.07.  Applicant was convicted of robbery\r\nand sentenced to five years in prison.   Applicant's conviction was affirmed by the Thirteenth\r\nCourt of Appeals on August 30, 2004.   Tanksley v. State, No. 13-03-00353 (Tex. App. -\r\nCorpus Christi 2004).  Applicant's pro se petition for discretionary review was dismissed as\r\nuntimely filed on November 10, 2004.  \t\r\n\r\n\tApplicant contends, inter alia, that he was not timely advised by appellate counsel of\r\nhis right to file a pro se petition for discretionary review.  Although there is no affidavit from\r\ncounsel in the record, the State indicates in its response that it contacted Applicant's\r\nappellate counsel and that she stated she could not remember whether she had advised\r\nApplicant of his right to file a pro se petition for discretionary review.   In Ex parte Wilson,\r\n956 S.W.2d 25 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997), this Court held that if \"appellate counsel's action or\r\ninaction denies a defendant his opportunity to prepare and file a petition for discretionary\r\nreview, that defendant has been denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of\r\ncounsel.\"  Id. at 26.  The trial court found that Applicant was denied the opportunity to file\r\na timely petition for discretionary review, and recommends that he be afforded the\r\nopportunity to do so.\r\n\r\n\tHabeas corpus relief is granted, in part, and Applicant is granted leave to file an out-of-time petition for discretionary review from his conviction in cause number 02-CR-2203-F(2) in the 214th Judicial District Court of Nueces County, Texas. Applicant is ordered\r\nreturned to the point at which he can file a meaningful petition for discretionary review.   For\r\npurposes of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, all time limits shall be calculated as if\r\nthe Court of Appeals' decision had been rendered on the day the mandate of this Court\r\nissues.  We hold that should Applicant desire to seek discretionary review, he must take\r\naffirmative steps to see that his petition is filed in the Court of Appeals within thirty days of\r\nthe date the mandate of this Court has issued.\r\n\r\n\tApplicant's remaining allegations are dismissed.  Ex parte Torres, 943 S.W.2d 469\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1997).  \r\n\r\nDELIVERED: April 27, 2005\r\n\r\nDO NOT PUBLISH\r\n\r\n\r\n",
