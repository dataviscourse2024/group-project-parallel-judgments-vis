Defendant argues the trial court erred in denying her\n\nmotion to suppress, because the police officer who stopped Defendant\u2019s car lacked\n\nreasonable suspicion. We agree. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n                                  I. Background\n\n                               A. Procedural History\n\f                              STATE V. CABBAGESTALK\n\n                                 Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      On 20 January 2017, Hoke County Sheriff\u2019s Officer Perry Thompson (\u201cOfficer\n\nThompson\u201d), who was then a sergeant with the Rowland Police Department,\n\nstopped Defendant and charged her with driving while impaired (\u201cD.W.I.\u201d) in\n\nviolation of N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-138.1. In a bench trial held on 22 September 2017\n\nin Robeson County District Court, the Honorable William J. Moore found Defendant\n\nguilty of driving while impaired. Following judgment entered in the district court,\n\nDefendant gave notice of appeal in open court for a trial de novo in the Robeson\n\nCounty Superior Court.\n\n      On 28 March 2018, Defendant filed a motion to suppress in Robeson County\n\nSuperior Court.   On 10 April 2018, the Honorable Claire V. Hill conducted an\n\nevidentiary hearing in open court without a jury, and heard arguments from the\n\nState and Defendant on Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.           Officer Thompson\n\nprovided the sole testimony at the hearing.\n\n      Following the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress, the Honorable\n\nGale M. Adams presided over a jury trial during the criminal session of the Robeson\n\nCounty Superior Court. Officer Thompson was again the State\u2019s sole witness at\n\ntrial. Defense counsel did not object to the disputed evidence. Defendant moved to\n\ndismiss at the close of the State\u2019s evidence, which the trial court denied. The jury\n\nfound Defendant guilty of driving while impaired, in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat.\n\n\u00a7 20-138.1. Judge Adams imposed a Level Four punishment, sentencing Defendant\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f                              STATE V. CABBAGESTALK\n\n                                 Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nto 120 days imprisonment, suspended upon 12 months of supervised probation, and\n\nordering Defendant to complete 48 hours of community service and to complete a\n\nsubstance abuse program. She was also ordered to pay a community service fee of\n\n$250, and her license was revoked.\n\n      Based on the prior motion to suppress that was filed and on the judgment\n\nentered, Defendant gave notice of appeal in open court.           Defendant further\n\nexpressly argued in her appellate brief that the denial of the motion to suppress\n\nconstituted plain error.\n\n                              B. Factual Background\n\n      On 20 January 2018, at \u201c[a]pproximately\u201d 9:00 p.m., Officer Thompson was\n\non \u201croutine patrol\u201d with the Rowland Police Department when he observed\n\nDefendant \u201csitting on the porch\u201d of a local residence where \u201ceveryone hangs out at,\u201d\n\ndrinking a \u201cNatural Ice . . . tall can\u201d of beer.        He had known Defendant for\n\n\u201capproximately two years,\u201d because he had previously stopped her for driving while\n\nher license was revoked, and for an open container violation. Officer Thompson was\n\nconfident it was the Defendant he observed that evening drinking beer on the porch,\n\nbased on prior interactions. Although it was night, he could see her because a porch\n\nlight and a street light were illuminating the area, and he was only approximately\n\nten feet away.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f                               STATE V. CABBAGESTALK\n\n                                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      During the suppression hearing, Officer Thompson testified that he saw\n\nDefendant at the BP store in Rowland \u201cmaybe 30 minutes to an hour later.\u201d Upon\n\nreviewing the citation he issued on cross-examination, however, he clarified that the\n\ncitation reflected a stop time of \u201cat or about 11:00 p.m.\u201d On redirect he confirmed\n\nthat he saw her drinking at 9:00 p.m. and saw her an hour and a half later at the\n\ngas station, \u201c[b]uying more beer.\u201d\n\n      At the BP store, Defendant went to the beer cooler, purchased another beer,\n\npaid for it, and returned to her vehicle. Prior to being placed in a brown bag, the\n\nbeverage in her hand looked to Officer Thompson like a \u201cNatural Ice, the Ice.\u201d\n\nOfficer Thompson admitted that he did not observe Defendant stumbling or\n\notherwise walking as though she was intoxicated. Moreover, Officer Thompson did\n\nnot speak to Defendant at this point, or any point prior to the traffic stop.\n\n      When Defendant got back into her truck and left the gas station, Officer\n\nThompson followed her. Defendant \u201ctook East Main Street all the way up to North\n\nMLK Street, and she made a right turn on North MLK Street.\u201d Officer Thompson\n\nadmitted that Defendant drove \u201cnormal[ly]\u201d; that is, she was not speeding, going too\n\nslowly, weaving, or swerving. Defendant also appeared to be wearing her seatbelt,\n\nand her lights were working. Officer Thompson did not observe Defendant drinking\n\nthe beer she had purchased or violate any traffic laws, nor did he run her plates\n\nbefore stopping her.\n\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\f                              STATE V. CABBAGESTALK\n\n                                 Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      After following her for two to three blocks, Officer Thompson activated his\n\nblue lights as Defendant turned right on North MLK Street. Defendant pulled off to\n\nthe side of the road without incident.    Officer Thompson stated, \u201cI stopped her\n\nbecause earlier that night I observed her drinking a beer. She went back in the\n\nstore, bought more beer, and then decided to get under the wheel and drive.\u201d\n\n      During the stop, Officer Thompson noticed a \u201cstrong odor of alcohol\u201d on\n\nDefendant\u2019s breath, which he continued to smell once Defendant was in the officer\u2019s\n\npatrol car.   Defendant admitted she had been drinking and discussed \u201cfamily\n\nproblems.\u201d    Officer Thompson saw an unopened beer in Defendant\u2019s car.          He\n\ncontinued his investigation at that point, performing two roadside breath tests,\n\nobtaining further information about Defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, and writing the\n\nticket\u2014a process which \u201c[took] 15 to 20 minutes.\u201d\n\n      Officer Thompson subsequently transported Defendant to the Robeson\n\nCounty Jail. Once at the jail, he performed another breath test with two separate\n\n\u201cblows,\u201d the lowest reading of which was a 0.16, twice as high as the legal limit of\n\n0.08. Following the testing, Officer Thompson completed a Driving While Impaired\n\nReport, and took Defendant before a magistrate to be charged.\n\n                                   II. Analysis\n\n      On appeal, Defendant argues the trial court lacked support for a necessary\n\nfinding of fact and erred in denying her motion to suppress the evidence obtained by\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f                               STATE V. CABBAGESTALK\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nOfficer Thompson as a result of the vehicle stop. Defendant further argues that\n\nsuch denial constituted plain error as, without Officer Thompson\u2019s testimony, the\n\nevidentiary basis for the jury\u2019s verdict would have been insufficient. We agree.\n\n                               A. Standard of Review\n\n      Following a hearing on a motion to suppress, a trial judge \u201cmust set forth in\n\nthe record [her] findings of facts and conclusions of law.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-\n\n977(f) (2017). \u201cAn appellate court accords great deference to the trial court\u2019s ruling\n\non a motion to suppress because the trial court is entrusted with the duty to hear\n\ntestimony (thereby observing the demeanor of the witnesses) and to weigh and\n\nresolve any conflicts in the evidence.\u201d State v. Johnston, 115 N.C. App. 711, 713,\n\n446 S.E.2d 135, 137 (1994) (citation omitted).       \u201cThis deference, however, is not\n\nwithout limitation. A reviewing court has the duty to ensure that a judicial officer\n\ndoes not abdicate his or her duty by merely ratifying the bare conclusions of\n\naffiants.\u201d State v. Brown, 248 N.C. App. 72, 74, 787 S.E.2d 81, 84 (2016) (internal\n\nmarks and citation omitted).\n\n      \u201cIn reviewing a trial judge\u2019s ruling on a suppression motion, we determine\n\nonly whether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by competent evidence,\n\nand whether these findings of fact support the court\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d State v.\n\nBrewington, 170 N.C. App. 264, 271, 612 S.E.2d 648, 653 (2005) (citation omitted).\n\nIf the findings are supported by competent evidence, they are conclusive on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f                                STATE V. CABBAGESTALK\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nState v. Campbell, 359 N.C. 644, 661, 617 S.E.2d 1, 12 (2005).\n\n             Conclusions of law are reviewed de novo and are subject\n             to full review. Under a de novo review, the court\n             considers the matter anew and freely substitutes its own\n             judgment for that of the lower tribunal.\n\nState v. Crandell, 247 N.C. App. 771, 774, 786 S.E.2d 789, 792 (2016) (one italics\n\nadded) (quoting State v. Biber, 365 N.C. 162, 167-68, 712 S.E.2d 874, 878 (2011)\n\n(citations and quotation marks omitted)).\n\n      A pretrial motion to suppress is insufficient to preserve for appeal the\n\nadmissibility of evidence. State v. Grooms, 353 N.C. 50, 65-66, 540 S.E.2d 713, 723\n\n(2000). Our Supreme Court has held, however, that \u201cto the extent [a] defendant\n\nfail[s] to preserve issues relating to [his] motion to suppress, we review for plain\n\nerror\u201d if the defendant \u201cspecifically and distinctly assign[s] plain error\u201d on appeal.\n\nState v. Waring, 364 N.C. 443, 468, 508, 701 S.E.2d 615, 632, 656 (2010), cert.\n\ndenied, 565 U.S. 832, 132 S. Ct. 132, 181 L. Ed.2d. 53 (2011). For error to constitute\n\nplain error, a defendant must\n\n             demonstrate that a fundamental error occurred at trial.\n             To show that an error was fundamental, a defendant\n             must establish prejudice \u2014 that, after examination of the\n             entire record, the error had a probable impact on the\n             jury's finding that the defendant was guilty.\n\nState v. Lawrence, 365 N.C. 506, 518, 723 S.E.2d 326, 334 (2012) (internal citations,\n\nquotation marks, and brackets omitted).\n\n                                B. Motion to Suppress\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f                               STATE V. CABBAGESTALK\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      Defendant first challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that she was seen drinking\n\n30 to 60 minutes before driving. Relatedly, Defendant also challenges the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress the evidence obtained through Officer\n\nThompson\u2019s traffic stop of her vehicle. She argues that Officer Thompson did not\n\nhave a reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop Defendant, and thus it was error to\n\nadmit evidence resulting from the stop. Finally, Defendant argues that the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress constituted plain error as it had a probable\n\nimpact on the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. We agree with Defendant in each instance.\n\n      The Fourth Amendment protects individuals \u201cagainst unreasonable searches\n\nand seizures.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. IV. The North Carolina Constitution affords\n\nsimilar protection. N.C. Const. art. I, \u00a7 20. \u201cA traffic stop is a seizure \u2018even though\n\nthe purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief.\u2019\u201d State v.\n\nBarnard, 362 N.C. 244, 246, 658 S.E.2d 643, 645 (2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 914,\n\n129 S. Ct. 264, 172 L. Ed. 2d 198 (2008) (quoting Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648,\n\n653, 99 S. Ct. 1391, 1396, 59 L. Ed. 2d 660, 667 (1979)). \u201cSuch stops have \u2018been\n\nhistorically viewed under the investigatory detention framework first articulated in\n\nTerry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968).\u2019\u201d Id., 658 S.E.2d at\n\n645 (quoting United States v. Delfin-Colina, 464 F.3d 392, 396 (3rd Cir. 2006)). \u201c[A]\n\ntraffic stop is constitutional if the officer has a \u2018reasonable, articulable suspicion\n\nthat criminal activity is afoot.\u2019\u201d Id. at 246-47, 658 S.E.2d at 645 (quoting Illinois v.\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f                               STATE V.

Ed. 2d 570, 576 (2000)).\n\nThis reasonable suspicion must derive from more than an \u201cinchoate and\n\nunparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch[.]\u2019\u201d Terry, 392 U.S. at 27, 88 S. Ct. at 1883, 20\n\nL. Ed.2d at 909.\n\n      In North Carolina, \u201creasonable suspicion is the necessary standard for traffic\n\nstops, regardless of whether the traffic violation was readily observed or merely\n\nsuspected.\u201d State v. Styles, 362 N.C. 412, 415, 665 S.E.2d 438, 440 (2008).\n\n             Reasonable suspicion is a less demanding standard than\n             probable cause and requires a showing considerably less\n             than preponderance of the evidence. Only some minimal\n             level of objective justification is required. This Court has\n             determined that a reasonable suspicion standard requires\n             that the stop be based on specific and articulable facts, as\n             well as the rational inferences from those facts, as viewed\n             through the eyes of a reasonable, cautious officer, guided\n             by his experience and training. Moreover, a court must\n             consider the totality of the circumstances\u2014the whole\n             picture in determining whether a reasonable suspicion\n             exists.\n\nBarnard, 362 N.C. at 247, 658 S.E.2d at 645 (citations, quotation marks, brackets,\n\nand ellipsis omitted).\n\n      Though not always reducible to a mechanically applied formula, case law\n\nprovides useful guidance in ascertaining what constitutes reasonable suspicion of\n\ncriminal activity justifying a traffic stop. \u201cTo be sure, when a defendant does in fact\n\ncommit a traffic violation, it is constitutional for the police to pull the defendant\n\nover.\u201d State v. Johnson, 370 N.C. 32, 38, 803 S.E.2d 137, 141 (2017). \u201cBut while an\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f                               STATE V.

The\n\nfollowing circumstances have supported finding a reasonable suspicion of criminal\n\nactivity even absent showing a traffic violation:\n\n             -   Defendant constantly weaved within lane for three-\n                 quarters of a mile at 11:00 p.m. State v.

App. ___, 795\n                 S.E.2d 106, 109-110 (2016).\n\n             -   Defendant followed exact pattern for purchasing drugs\n                 (previously observed by police officer) by driving into\n                 area adjacent to building and leaving two minutes\n                 later. State v. Crandell, ___ N.C. App. ___, 786 S.E.2d\n                 789, 796 (2016).\n\n      However, when the basis for an officer\u2019s suspicion connects only tenuously\n\nwith the criminal behavior suspected, if at all, courts have not found the requisite\n\nreasonable suspicion.

CABBAGESTALK\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nBrown, 217 N.C. App. 566, 572-73, 720 S.E.2d 446, 451 (2011), review denied, 365\n\nN.C. 562, 742 S.E.2d 187 (2012) (stop invalidated when based on officer seeing car\n\npull off to side of road approximately four hours after nearby unsolved robbery,\n\nhearing yelling and car doors slamming, and observing car rapidly accelerating but\n\nwithout violating traffic laws); State v. Murray, 192 N.C. App. 684, 666 S.E.2d 205\n\n(2008) (stop invalidated when based on officer observing motorist driving car\n\nconsistent with traffic law and in a normal fashion at 3:41 a.m. in a high-crime\n\narea).\n\n         Here, Defendant argues first that the competent evidence does not support\n\nthe trial court\u2019s Findings of Fact 5 in its order denying her motion to suppress.\n\nMore specifically, Defendant challenges the underlined portion of Finding of Fact 5:\n\n               5.    Sgt. Thompson was on routine patrol and saw the\n               defendant drinking a tall can of beer on the porch of a\n               house (where people would hang out) approximately 30\n               minutes to an hour before the time of the traffic stop[.]\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n         Crediting Officer Thompson\u2019s testimony, as the trial court did, the record\n\nestablishes that it was longer than \u201capproximately 30 minutes to an hour\u201d between\n\nthe time Officer Thompson observed Defendant drinking a can of beer on the porch\n\nand when he pulled her car over later that evening. While he offered the 30 to 60\n\nminute window on direct examination at the suppression hearing, he clarified on\n\ncross-examination that the timeframe was in fact approximately two hours, as\n\n\n                                          - 11 -\n\f                               STATE V. CABBAGESTALK\n\n                                   Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nreflected by the citation he issued to Defendant on the evening in question. On re-\n\ndirect, moreover, Officer Thompson confirmed that it was at least an hour and a\n\nhalf between when he saw Defendant drinking and \u201cbuying more beer\u201d at the gas\n\nstation.   The trial court\u2019s order denying the motion to suppress also finds that\n\nOfficer Thompson \u201cinitiated the traffic stop at approximately 11:00 pm[,]\u201d two hours\n\nafter initially observing Defendant on the porch.         This finding is supported by\n\ncompetent evidence and conflicts with the fifth finding of fact. The trial court\u2019s fifth\n\nfinding of fact was for these reasons not supported by competent evidence, and is\n\nnot binding on appeal. See State v. Parker, 137 N.C. App. 590, 598, 530 S.E.2d 297,\n\n302 (2000).\n\n      We next consider whether, absent the evidentiary support of the fifth finding\n\nof fact, Officer Thompson had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to make the stop.\n\nViewing the facts in the light most favorable to the State, the trial court concluded\n\nas a matter of law:\n\n              Looking at the totality of the circumstances there was a\n              reasonable, articulable suspicion that justified the traffic\n              stop and, viewing all the facts and circumstances through\n              a reasonably cautious officer, being guided by his\n              experience and training, and prior knowledge of the\n              Defendant.\n\n      The bulk of the evidence before the trial court at the suppression hearing\n\nbelies this conclusion.    Officer Thompson did not see Defendant stumble or\n\notherwise appear impaired upon leaving the BP with a beer in a brown bag and\n\n\n                                          - 12 -\n\f                                      STATE V. CABBAGESTALK\n\n                                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\nentering her car. There was no evidence that Defendant drank from the beer she\n\npurchased.1 Defendant did not violate any traffic laws prior to the stop. What is\n\nmore, according to Officer Thompson\u2019s own testimony, Defendant\u2019s \u201c[d]riving\n\nappeared normal\u201d that evening. Defendant was not driving too fast, nor was she\n\ndriving too slowly. She did not weave or swerve. She had no problem pulling over\n\nto the side of the road during the course of the traffic stop.\n\n        In contrast, the evidentiary basis for the stop was quite limited.                    Officer\n\nThompson was clear on this point:               \u201cI stopped her because earlier that night I\n\nobserved her drinking a beer. She went back in the store, bought more beer, and\n\nthen decided to get under the wheel and drive.\u201d\n\n        The State also makes reference to Defendant\u2019s past criminal record for\n\ndriving while license revoked and for an open container violation. Prior charges\n\nalone, however, do not provide the requisite reasonable suspicion and these\n\nparticular priors are too attenuated from the facts of the current controversy to aid\n\nthe State\u2019s argument. See State v. Branch, 162 N.C. App. 707, 713, 591 S.E.2d 923,\n\n926 (2004), rev\u2019d on other grounds sub. nom. North Carolina v. Branch, 546 U.S.\n\n931, 163 L. Ed. 2d 314 (2005) (prior knowledge that defendant\u2019s license had been\n\nrevoked sufficient to justify license check but insufficient to justify dog sniff and\n\nsubsequent search).\n\n        1   In fact, at trial Officer Thompson confirmed that the beer was unopened at the time of the\nstop.\n\n\n\n                                                 - 13 -\n\f                               STATE V. CABBAGESTALK\n\n                                  Opinion of the Court\n\n\n\n      Considering the totality of the circumstances, there was no \u201cpattern[] of\n\noperation of [a] certain kind[] of lawbreaker[,]\u201d and \u201c[f]rom these data\u201d Officer\n\nThompson\u2019s inferences and deductions went too far. See United States v. Cortez,\n\n449 U.S. 411, 418, 101 S. Ct. 690, 695, 66 L. Ed. 2d 621, 629 (1981). Accordingly, we\n\nhold that the trial court erred in concluding that Officer Thompson had reasonable\n\nsuspicion to stop Defendant\u2019s vehicle and thus erred in denying Defendant\u2019s motion\n\nto suppress.\n\n      Having determined that the motion to suppress was erroneously denied, we\n\nadvance to the second step in our plain error review\u2014whether this error had a\n\nprobable impact on the jury\u2019s determination that Defendant was guilty.             See\n\nLawrence, 365 N.C. at 518, 723 S.E.2d at 334. Here, the answer is straightforward.\n\nIf Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress had been granted, there would have been no\n\nevidence showing criminal conduct on her part as Officer Thompson was the sole\n\nwitness at trial, and all incriminating evidence was gathered by him as a result of\n\nthe stop. Thus, the trial court\u2019s erroneous denial of Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress\n\nOfficer Thompson\u2019s testimony under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-977 had a probable\n\nimpact on the jury\u2019s verdict.     See id.      Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s denial of\n\nDefendant\u2019s motion to suppress constituted plain error and reversal of the judgment\n\nentered upon the jury\u2019s verdict is required.\n\n                                  III.
