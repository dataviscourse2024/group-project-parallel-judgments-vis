The specification alleging identity theft\nincorporated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(1).\n\fidentity theft specifications. The members sentenced the appellant to a bad-conduct\ndischarge, confinement for 6 months, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction\nto the grade of E-3. The convening authority reduced the confinement to 5 months and\n21 days, but otherwise approved the sentence as adjudged.\n\n        The appellant now alleges that the government violated Article 55, UCMJ,\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 855, by subjecting him to cruel and unusual punishment during his post-trial\nconfinement. During our review of this issue, we ordered additional briefing on the\nrelated issue of whether we could and should grant sentence appropriateness relief under\nArticle 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c), resulting from the conditions of the appellant\u2019s\npost-trial confinement. Additionally, the appellant requests sentence relief under\nUnited States v. Tardif, 57 M.J. 219 (C.A.A.F. 2002), for the government\u2019s delay in\nforwarding the record of trial for appellate review. We grant relief as discussed below.\n\n                                       Background\n\n       The appellant and Staff Sergeant (SSgt) NH were engaged to be married and lived\ntogether. The two kept their finances separate but were each responsible for certain\nhousehold expenses. Each also bought the other gifts, and the appellant took care of\nsome additional expenses for SSgt NH. SSgt NH had one Visa credit card, plus three\nstore credit cards.\n\n        When SSgt NH departed for a one-year remote assignment, she gave her store\ncredit cards to the appellant for safekeeping; however, she did not authorize him to use\nthem or to take out any credit cards in her name. The couple broke up soon after\nSSgt NH departed. Several months later, SSgt NH learned that a bill collector was trying\nto contact her to collect a debt of about $8,000 owed on a credit card in her name. She\nobtained a credit report that revealed she had several other open credit lines with balances\nin the thousands of dollars. According to SSgt NH, she did not open these accounts or\nauthorize anyone else to do so. In addition, the store credit cards\u2014which had no balance\nwhen she departed\u2014now had overdue balances. SSgt NH confronted the appellant over\nthe telephone, and the appellant made several incriminating statements.\n\n        Further investigation revealed the appellant opened several credit cards in\nSSgt NH\u2019s name using personal information to which he had access. He then used these\ncredit cards and left overdue balances on them. Much of this misconduct occurred before\nSSgt NH departed for her remote assignment.\n\n       During a series of pretext phone calls about this matter, SSgt NH pressed the\nappellant for a complete list of credit cards he had taken out in her name. The appellant\ndemurred, stating his household goods were en route to his mother\u2019s house due to his\npending medical separation, and he could not answer SSgt NH\u2019s question until he could\nreview his records contained in the shipment. The Air Force Office of Special\n\n\n                                             2                                    ACM 38525\n\fInvestigations, in conjunction with local law enforcement, obtained a search warrant for\nthe appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s residence. The search revealed several documents relating to the\nappellant\u2019s financial misconduct. In addition, the search revealed two government laptop\ncomputers. These laptops had previously been reported missing and were the subject of\nreports of survey that noted a lack of sufficient oversight and safeguards. The appellant\nhad been one of the individuals responsible for providing this oversight and employing\nsuch safeguards.\n\n      Further facts relevant to the assignments of error are discussed below.\n\n                         Conditions of Post-Trial Confinement\n\n       Following announcement of the sentence, the appellant was placed in the\nMonmouth County Correctional Institution (MCCI) on 30 May 2013. He was assigned to\na \u201cpod.\u201d While in the pod, the appellant alleged he was confined in proximity to a\nforeign national for nine days. The appellant raised this issue in his clemency request,\nand the convening authority granted the appellant\u2019s requested relief by disapproving nine\ndays of the adjudged sentence to confinement for this apparent violation of Article 12,\nUCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 812.\n\n        On the ninth day following the appellant\u2019s arrival at MCCI, he was placed in\nsolitary confinement. As part of his clemency request, the appellant submitted a\ncomplaint under Article 138, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 938, regarding this issue. Attached to\nhis Article 138, UCMJ, complaint was an affidavit he signed, which stated in relevant\npart:\n\n                     On 7 June 2013, I was moved into solitary\n             confinement, which segregated me from the foreign national\n             in Pod F-1 and all other inmates. Upon entering solitary I\n             was stripped, searched, placed in shackles, put on 23 hour per\n             day lockdown, denied phone calls and visitation and forced to\n             use an open caged shower and bathroom. I was released from\n             solitary on 13 June 2013, after [certain officials from his\n             squadron] came to check on my living arrangements and\n             discovered what had happened. I was immediately removed\n             from solitary per their request to the MCCI staff. I am now\n             presently housed in Pod F-2 and awaiting transfer to a\n             military confinement facility.\n\n        The appellant also stated that he heard from MCCI personnel that someone at the\nbase legal office directed the appellant\u2019s placement into solitary confinement. However,\nthis assertion was merely contained in his complaint letter rather than the accompanying\n\n\n\n                                            3                                   ACM 38525\n\faffidavit. Also attached to the Article 138, UCMJ, complaint was an affidavit signed by\nthe appellant\u2019s squadron superintendent. It stated in relevant part:\n\n             I visited SSgt Kevin Gay at the [MCCI] on 13 June 2013, and\n             I was alarmed to find that SSgt Gay was in solitary\n             confinement and brought out in handcuffs and that he had\n             been in that condition since 7 June 2013. I was accompanied\n             by [two non-commissioned officers responsible for\n             confinement at the base security forces squadron]. Upon\n             learning of SSgt Gay\u2019s living conditions, we immediately\n             complained to the MCCI staff. [An officer from the\n             appellant\u2019s squadron] saw to it that SSgt Gay was\n             immediately released from solitary confinement and placed in\n             a Pod alongside American Citizens at approximately 1630\n             hours on 13 June 2013.\n\n                    I learned from the staff at MCCI that MCCI has a\n             procedure in place to ensure military members are not placed\n             in confinement alongside foreign nationals or enemy\n             prisoners of war. However, according to MCCI staff they\n             were verbally instructed by personnel at Joint Base McGuire-\n             Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, without explanation, to place\n             SSgt Gay [into] protective custody, which they did without\n             question.\n\n       The record does not contain evidence of any action taken in response to this\nArticle 138, UCMJ, complaint. However, the addendum to the staff judge advocate\u2019s\nrecommendation attached a \u201cmemorandum for record\u201d from the base legal office\u2019s chief\nof military justice. That memorandum, which was not reduced to an affidavit or sworn\ndeclaration, reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n                     On 25 September 2013, I called the [MCCI] and spoke\n             with Officer [CL] of the Intake and Booking office about the\n             practices and procedures related to individuals placed into\n             segregation cells. Officer [CL] stated that inmates placed into\n             segregation are in their cells for 23 hours a day, but are not\n             restrained by shackles or handcuffs while in the cell. He\n             stated the only time an inmate is placed into shackles or\n             handcuffs is during periods that the inmate is being moved\n             from a cell to another location within the correctional facility.\n             He estimated that the longest period an inmate is placed into\n             shackles or handcuffs for movement is when the inmate is\n             moved to the visiting area, which takes approximately five\n\n\n                                            4                                    ACM 38525\n\f                   minutes. He stated that while the member is in the visiting\n                   area he is unshackled. He was unaware of how many times\n                   [the appellant] was moved to the visiting area from his\n                   segregated cell. Officer [CL] stated the standard practice is to\n                   strip search inmates as they are placed into segregation, but\n                   no further strip searches are conducted solely due to an\n                   inmate\u2019s segregated status. Officer [CL] confirmed [the\n                   appellant] would have been subjected to a strip search when\n                   he first entered segregation. Finally, Officer [CL] stated that\n                   the shower and bathroom facility in the segregated area is\n                   covered with a curtain material and inmates enter clothed and\n                   then undress and dress behind the curtain material.\n\nThe chief of military justice\u2019s memorandum did not dispute the contention that legal\noffice personnel instructed MCCI officials to place the appellant in solitary confinement,\nand it did not address the reason the appellant was placed in solitary confinement. Based\non this memorandum, the staff judge advocate advised against granting relief for the\nappellant\u2019s complaint regarding his solitary confinement. The convening authority\nfollowed that advice.\n\n      Before this court, the appellant alleges that his placement in solitary confinement,\nand the associated conditions of his period in solitary confinement, constitute cruel and\nunusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment2 and Article 55, UCMJ.\n\n       We review de novo allegations of cruel and unusual punishment. United States v.\nWhite, 54 M.J. 469, 471 (C.A.A.F. 2001).\n\n        Both the Eighth Amendment and Article 55, UCMJ, prohibit cruel and unusual\npunishment.     In general, we apply the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the\nEighth Amendment to claims raised under Article 55, UCMJ, except where legislative\nintent to provide greater protections under Article 55, UCMJ, is apparent. United States\nv. Avila, 53 M.J. 99, 101 (C.A.A.F. 2000) (citing United States v. Wappler,\n9 C.M.R. 23, 26 (C.M.A. 1953)).\n\n       \u201c[T]he Eighth Amendment prohibits two types of punishments: (1) those\n\u2018incompatible with the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a\nmaturing society\u2019 or (2) those \u2018which involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of\npain.\u2019\u201d United States v. Lovett, 63 M.J. 211, 215 (C.A.A.F. 2006) (quoting Estelle v.\nGamble, 429 U.S. 97, 102\u201303 (1976)). A violation of the Eighth Amendment is shown\nby demonstrating: \u201c(1) an objectively, sufficiently serious act or omission resulting in the\ndenial of necessities; (2) a culpable state of mind on the part of prison officials amounting\n\n2\n    U.S. CONST. amend. VIII.\n\n\n                                                  5                                   ACM 38525\n\fto deliberate indifference to [the appellant\u2019s] health and safety; and (3) that [the\nappellant] has exhausted the prisoner-grievance system . . . and that he has petitioned for\nrelief under Article 138, UCMJ.\u201d Id. (alteration in original) (footnotes omitted) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n       Before applying these standards, we must first determine what facts are properly\nbefore this court, and whether we are required to remand this case for a post-trial\nfactfinding hearing. In United States v. Fagan, 59 M.J. 238, 241 (C.A.A.F. 2004), our\nsuperior court determined that the framework of United States v. Ginn, 47 M.J. 236\n(C.A.A.F. 1997), governs our determination of whether a post-trial factfinding hearing is\nnecessary to resolve \u201ca post-trial claim that is framed by conflicting affidavits.\u201d\nTherefore, the following principles (originally set forth to deal with post-trial claims of\nineffective assistance of counsel) determine when a post-trial factfinding hearing is\nrequired:\n\n                     First, if the facts alleged in the affidavit allege an error\n              that would not result in relief even if any factual dispute were\n              resolved in appellant\u2019s favor, the claim may be rejected on\n              that basis.\n\n                     Second, if the affidavit does not set forth specific facts\n              but consists instead of speculative or conclusory observations,\n              the claim may be rejected on that basis.\n\n                      Third, if the affidavit is factually adequate on its face\n              to state a claim of legal error and the Government either does\n              not contest the relevant facts or offers an affidavit that\n              expressly agrees with those facts, the court can proceed to\n              decide the legal issue on the basis of those uncontroverted\n              facts.\n\n                      Fourth, if the affidavit is factually adequate on its face\n              but the appellate filings and the record as a whole\n              \u201ccompellingly demonstrate\u201d the improbability of those facts,\n              the Court may discount those factual assertions and decide the\n              legal issue.\n\n                     Fifth, when an appellate claim of ineffective\n              representation contradicts a matter that is within the record of\n              a guilty plea, an appellate court may decide the issue on the\n              basis of the appellate file and record (including the\n              admissions made in the plea inquiry at trial and appellant\u2019s\n              expression of satisfaction with counsel at trial) unless the\n\n\n                                              6                                     ACM 38525\n\f                  appellant sets forth facts that would rationally explain why he\n                  would have made such statements at trial but not upon appeal.\n\n                        Sixth, the Court of Criminal Appeals is required to\n                  order a factfinding hearing only when the above-stated\n                  circumstances are not met. In such circumstances the court\n                  must remand the case to the trial level for a DuBay\n                  proceeding.     During appellate review of the DuBay\n                  proceeding, the court may exercise its Article 66 factfinding\n                  power and decide the legal issue.\n\nGinn, 47 M.J. at 248; see also United States v. DuBay, 37 C.M.R. 411 (C.M.A. 1967).\n\n        The Ginn framework does not require us to remand this case for a factfinding\nhearing, for two reasons. First, this case does not involve \u201ca post-trial claim that is\nframed by conflicting affidavits.\u201d The appellant submitted two affidavits to support his\nclaims of cruel and unusual punishment, but in clemency and on appeal, the government\nhas made no effort to provide an affidavit to rebut the appellant\u2019s contentions despite\nample opportunity to do so. Instead, the government chose to wholly rely on an unsworn\nmemorandum for record.3 Additionally, the third Ginn factor largely applies because for\nthe most part, the chief of military justice\u2019s memorandum did not contest the appellant\u2019s\nversion of the facts. The memorandum did not dispute that the appellant was placed in\nsolitary confinement, did not contest that base legal office personnel directed his\nplacement in solitary confinement, did not contest that the appellant was placed on\n23-hour per day lockdown and denied phone calls and visitation, did not contest that the\nappellant was handcuffed or shackled to a certain extent, and did not contest that the\nappellant could have been placed in another pod to avoid his association with a foreign\nnational rather than placed in solitary confinement. The memorandum only addressed\ndiscrete aspects of the appellant\u2019s claim, such as the extent of the use of handcuffs or\nshackles and his claim that he was forced to use an open caged shower.\n\n      With this factual framework in mind, we find no violation of the Eighth\nAmendment or Article 55, UCMJ. Both our superior court and federal civilian courts\nhave held that solitary confinement, per se, does not constitute cruel and unusual\n\n3\n  If the memorandum for record was submitted directly to this court to address this post-trial issue, this court would\nnot normally admit or consider it.

AND PROC. 23(b) (stating that any statement\nfor consideration by the court \u201con any matter . . . shall be made either as an affidavit or as an unsworn declaration\nunder penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\u201d). This rule is based in part on United States v. Ginn,\n47 M.J. 236, 248 (C.A.A.F. 1997), which deals with this court\u2019s ability to resolve \u201ca post-trial claim that is framed\nby conflicting affidavits.\u201d United States v. Fagan, 59 M.J. 238, 241 (C.A.A.F. 2004). As we have elected to\nconsider the substance of the memorandum of record in resolving this issue, we need not decide whether the\ngovernment may, as a legal matter, counter claims raised in affidavits submitted in clemency with an unsworn\nmemorandum. We simply note that this is not a recommended practice and may lead to a convening authority or\nthis court giving less weight to the assertions raised in the unsworn memorandum.\n\n\n                                                          7                                              ACM 38525\n\fpunishment. See Avila, 53 M.J. at 101 (surveying federal cases). Rather, we review the\nspecific conditions of solitary confinement to determine whether the confinement\ninvolved deprivation of basic needs or unnecessary infliction of pain. Id. at 101\u201302. The\nappellant\u2019s complaint does not amount to a serious act or omission resulting in a denial of\nnecessities, and he claims no infliction of pain on him. Typically, such serious acts or\nomissions include matters such as denial of needed medical attention, proper food, or\nsanitary living conditions. Physical abuse may also qualify under this standard. Id.\n\n       Even accepting the appellant\u2019s Article 138, UCMJ, complaint at face value, we\nmust note that the appellant claims nothing unusual about the conditions of his solitary\nconfinement and does not show he was harmed physically or in any other appreciable\nway. Instead, the appellant\u2019s contentions smack more of \u201croutine conditions associated\nwith punitive or administrative segregation,\u201d which do not \u201crise to the level of a\ndeprivation of life\u2019s necessities and violation of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 102.\nConcerning the use of shackles, we recognize that the use of leg irons may in some\ncircumstances rise to the level of an Article 55, UCMJ, violation, as the article\nspecifically sets limits on the use of irons. United States v. Wise, 64 M.J. 468, 470\n(C.A.A.F. 2007). However, we see no evidence in the record that the use of shackles was\nnot for the purpose of safe custody, which is all that is required under Article 55, UCMJ.\n\n        In short, the appellant has not established that he was subject to cruel or unusual\npunishment. Solitary confinement per se is not incompatible with the evolving standards\nof decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, and there is no evidence of the\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. Under the three-part Lovett test, we find the\nthird factor is met because the appellant (or his unit) did raise this to prison officials and\nhe petitioned for relief under Article 138, UCMJ. Regardless of whether the second\nfactor is met (a culpable state of mind on the part of prison officials amounting to\ndeliberate indifference to the appellant\u2019s health and safety), the appellant\u2019s claim fails\nunder the first factor. No objectively, sufficiently serious act or omission occurred that\nresulted in the denial of necessities. The appellant is not entitled to relief for his\nallegation of cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n       This does not end our analysis of this issue, however. Under our broad\nArticle 66(c), UCMJ, authority, we retain responsibility in each case we review to\ndetermine whether the adjudged and approved sentence is appropriate. Under\nArticle 66(c), UCMJ, our sentence appropriateness authority is to be based on our review\nof the \u201centire record,\u201d which necessarily includes the appellant\u2019s allegation of the\nconditions of his post-trial confinement. See United States v. Towns, 52 M.J. 830, 833\n(A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2000) (noting that matters submitted to the convening authority for\nclemency purposes are available to this court to aid us in determining the appropriateness\nof a sentence). While we may not engage in acts of clemency, we hold that we may\nconsider post-trial confinement conditions as part of our overall sentence appropriateness\ndetermination, even where those allegations do not rise to the level of an\n\n\n                                              8                                    ACM 38525\n\fEighth Amendment or Article 55, UCMJ, violation. Our superior court has specifically\nrecognized that the courts of criminal appeals have broad discretion to grant or deny\nrelief for unreasonable or unexplained post-trial delay, even where the delay does not rise\nto the level of a due process violation. Tardif, 57 M.J. at 224. It necessarily follows that\nwe maintain similar discretion for post-trial confinement conditions that do not rise to the\nlevel of a constitutional or statutory violation. This fits easily within our broad charter to\n\u201cdo justice.\u201d United States v. Claxton, 32 M.J. 159, 162 (C.M.A. 1991).\n\n        Our superior court\u2019s decision in Fagan supports our conclusion. In Fagan, the\nArmy Court of Criminal Appeals declined to order a post-trial factfinding hearing and\ninstead decided to \u201cmoot the issue\u201d by granting sentence appropriateness relief.\nFagan, 59 M.J. at 240\u201341. Our superior court held the court erred in failing to apply the\nGinn factors before moving directly to grant sentence appropriateness relief. However,\nthat was the extent of the Fagan decision. The court did not hold that the service courts\nare prohibited from granting sentence appropriateness relief rising from complaints of\npost-trial conditions. Rather, it more narrowly held that our sentence appropriateness\nauthority \u201cdoes not come into play\u201d until the Ginn factors are employed to resolve\ncompeting factual claims.         Id. at 244; see also United States v. Zarbatany,\n70 M.J. 169, 177 (C.A.A.F. 2011) (indicating that a court of criminal appeals could\nemploy its sentence appropriateness authority in determining whether meaningful relief\nfor pretrial confinement credit was required); Towns, 52 M.J. at 833 (\u201cWhen an appellant\nclaims cruel and unusual punishment, he is claiming he has been treated unfairly. Such a\nclaim is a claim of unjust treatment, not a request for mercy. We therefore hold that\nArticle 66(c), UCMJ, bestows jurisdiction on this Court to consider claims of cruel and\nunusual post-trial treatment in cases properly referred to us. This jurisdiction is limited to\nconsideration of these claims as part of our determination of sentence appropriateness.\u201d);\nUnited States v. Pena, 61 M.J. 776, 778 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2005) (denying challenge to\nmandatory release program but holding that the court had authority under Article 66(c),\nUCMJ, to review the issue).\n\n        Under the facts of this particular case, we elect to grant sentence appropriateness\nrelief even though the appellant\u2019s treatment does not constitute an Eighth Amendment or\nArticle 55, UCMJ, violation. While we would be within our authority to consider the\nentirety of the affidavits accompanying the appellant\u2019s Article 138, UCMJ, complaint\n(because the government did not submit a contrary affidavit or declaration), we limit our\nconsideration solely to matters the government\u2019s memorandum did not dispute. The\nfollowing facts inform our decision that the appellant\u2019s post-trial treatment has rendered\nhis sentence inappropriately severe:\n\n       1. No valid reason has been offered for placing the appellant in solitary\n       confinement. The chief of military justice\u2019s memorandum did not indicate the\n       appellant was placed in solitary confinement for discipline, safety, or any other\n       legitimate reason.\n\n\n                                              9                                    ACM 38525\n\f       2. If the appellant was placed in solitary confinement solely to prevent him from\n       being housed with a foreign national, this does not constitute an acceptable reason\n       for placing the appellant in solitary confinement. See United States v. McPherson,\n       73 M.J. 393 (C.A.A.F. 2014) (Baker, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in\n       part) (generally noting the concern that servicemembers could be placed in solitary\n       confinement regardless of their behavior to avoid giving rise to relief under Article\n       12, UCMJ, for confining them in association with foreign nationals).\n\n       3. The unrebutted assertion in the appellant\u2019s superintendent\u2019s affidavit indicates\n       that some Air Force official directed the appellant to be placed in solitary\n       confinement.\n\n       4. When unit leadership complained to MCCI officials, the appellant was easily\n       transferred to another pod that did not contain foreign nationals.\n\n      Under these particular facts, we find the appellant\u2019s approved sentence is not\nappropriate for this appellant and his offenses. We discuss below the relief to be granted.\n\n                                Post-Trial Processing Delay\n\n        In United States v. Moreno, 63 M.J. 129, 142 (C.A.A.F. 2006), our superior court\nestablished guidelines that trigger a presumption of unreasonable delay, including where\nthe record of trial is not docketed with the court of criminal appeals within 30 days of the\nconvening authority\u2019s action. Furthermore, Article 66(c), UCMJ, empowers the service\nappellate courts to grant sentence relief for excessive post-trial delay without the showing\nof actual prejudice required by Article 59(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 859(a). Tardif, 57 M.J.\nat 224.\n\n        The appellant\u2019s court-martial concluded on 30 May 2013. The convening\nauthority took action on 18 October 2013, 141 days after the date sentence was\nannounced. This period exceeds the 120-day standard outlined in Moreno, although the\nappellant has not complained of this delay on appeal. The appellant\u2019s case was then\ndocketed with this court on 7 February 2014, 112 days after action. The appellant does\nnot allege he suffered any prejudice as a result of the delay in docketing the record of trial\nwith this court. Rather, the appellant asserts Tardif relief is warranted due to\nunreasonable and unexplained post-trial delay.\n\n       As we have noted before, the 30-day post-trial processing standard established in\nMoreno is not, by any means, a particularly onerous processing goal. In fact, a delay in\nthis phase of post-trial processing is \u201cthe least defensible of all and worthy of the least\npatience.\u201d United States v. Dunbar, 31 M.J. 70, 73 (C.M.A. 1990). \u201c[T]his stage\ninvolves no discretion or judgment; and, unlike an appellate court\u2019s consideration of an\n\n\n                                             10                                    ACM 38525\n\fappeal, this stage involves no complex legal or factual issues or weighing of policy\nconsiderations.\u201d Id. There may be valid reasons that justify exceeding the standard for\nthis administrative act, but the government has offered no such reason in this case and our\nreview of the record finds no justification for the delay.\n\n        In deciding whether to exercise our Article 66(c), UCMJ, authority in this context,\nwe must \u201cdetermine what findings and sentence \u2018should be approved,\u2019 based on all the\nfacts and circumstances reflected in the record, including the unexplained and\nunreasonable post-trial delay.\u201d Tardif, 57 M.J. at 224. In United States v. Toohey,\n63 M.J. 353, 362 (C.A.A.F. 2006), our superior court held that a service court may grant\nrelief even when the delay was not \u201cmost extraordinary.\u201d The court held: \u201cThe essential\ninquiry remains appropriateness in light of all circumstances, and no single predicate\ncriteria of \u2018most extraordinary\u2019 should be erected to foreclose application of Article\n66(c), UCMJ, consideration or relief.\u201d Id.\n\n        In light of our superior court\u2019s guidance, and keeping in mind that our overriding\nstandard under Article 66(c), UCMJ, is what portion of the sentence \u201cshould be\napproved,\u201d we consider the following factors relevant in considering whether Tardif\nrelief is appropriate:\n\n       1. How long did the delay exceed the standards set forth in United States v.\n       Moreno, 63 M.J. 129 (C.A.A.F. 2006)?\n\n       2. What reasons, if any, has the government set forth for the delay? Is there any\n       evidence of bad faith or gross indifference to the overall post-trial processing of\n       this case?\n\n       3. Keeping in mind that our goal under Tardif is not to analyze for prejudice, is\n       there nonetheless some evidence of harm (either to the appellant or institutionally)\n       caused by the delay?\n\n       4. Has the delay lessened the disciplinary effect of any particular aspect of the\n       sentence, and is relief consistent with the dual goals of justice and good order and\n       discipline?\n\n       5. Is there any evidence of institutional neglect concerning timely post-trial\n       processing, either across the service or at a particular installation?\n\n       6. Given the passage of time, can this court provide meaningful relief in this\n       particular situation?\n\n\n\n\n                                            11                                   ACM 38525\n\fWe consider no single factor dispositive, and a given case may reveal other appropriate\nconsiderations for this court in deciding whether post-trial delay has rendered an\nappellant\u2019s sentence inappropriate.4\n\n       Applying these standards to this case, we find granting sentencing relief is\nappropriate in this case. We recognize appellate defense counsel took 301 days to file an\nassignment of errors in this matter. The government\u2019s delays in obtaining convening\nauthority action and forwarding the record for appellate review are significantly less than\nthe time it took appellate defense counsel to file a brief. Nonetheless, the government\nmade no effort to explain the delays in processing this case, and we find no good\nexplanation in the record for the delays, either before or after action. The government\nexceeded the Moreno standard for docketing a case with this court by nearly a factor of\nfour, and this came after exceeding the Moreno standard for obtaining action. Under the\nfacts of this case, we find we may grant meaningful relief, and the significant delays in\nprocessing this case diminish the disciplinary effect of the appellant\u2019s sentence.\n\n                                                        Relief\n\n       The appellant\u2019s sentence is therefore inappropriately severe both on the basis of\nhis post-trial confinement conditions and the government\u2019s delay in forwarding the\nrecord of trial for our review. Having reviewed the entire record of trial, and considering\nboth bases for finding the approved sentence inappropriate, we find the following\nsentence is appropriate: a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 3 months, and\nreduction to E-3.\n\n                                                    Conclusion\n\n       The approved findings and the sentence, as reassessed, are correct in law and fact,\nand no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant occurred.5\nArticles 59(a) and 66(c), UCMJ.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  This court recognizes it has previously applied the non-exhausitve list of factors outlined in United States v.\nBrown, 62 M.J. 602, 606\u201307 (N.M. Ct. Crim. App. 2005), to analyze such issues. See, e.g., United States v.\nBischoff, 74 M.J. 664 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2015). However, the factors articulated in our current opinion will more\noften answer the question as to how non-prejudical post-trial delay weighs in the exercise of our broad authority to\ndetermine whether relief should be granted.\n5\n  This court also specifically considered whether the appellant\u2019s convictions for wrongful appropriation from\nfinancial institutions were properly charged under United States v. Lubasky, 68 M.J. 260 (C.A.A.F. 2010), and\nUnited States v. Sharpton, 73 M.J. 299 (C.A.A.F. 2014). The thrust of both decisions is that the properly charged\nvictim of a larceny (or wrongful appropriation) is the person or entity that suffers the financial loss or is deprived of\nthe use or benefit of the property at issue. Here, sufficient evidence existed in the record to demonstrate that the\nfinancial institutions suffered a financial loss as a result of the appellant\u2019s offenses. We find these offenses were\nproperly charged.\n\n\n                                                           12                                              ACM 38525\n\fAccordingly, the approved findings and the sentence, as reassessed, are AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n             FOR THE COURT\n\n\n             STEVEN LUCAS\n             Clerk of the Court\n\n\n\n\n                                         13                                ACM 38525\n\f",
