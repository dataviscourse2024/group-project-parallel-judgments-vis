It\nhas been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\f        ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN                3\n\nmisrepresentations to access an agricultural production\nfacility as well as making audio and video recordings of the\nfacility without the owner\u2019s consent.\n\n    The panel held that Idaho\u2019s criminalization of\nmisrepresentations to enter a production facility, \u00a7 18-\n7042(1)(a), could not survive First Amendment scrutiny.\nThe panel held that the subsection criminalized innocent\nbehavior, was staggeringly overbroad, and that the purpose\nof the statute was, in large part, targeted at speech and\ninvestigative journalists. The panel also struck down the\nstatute\u2019s subsection which banned audio and video\nrecordings of a production facility\u2019s operations, \u00a7 18-\n7042(1)(d). The panel held that the Recordings Clause\nregulated speech protected by the First Amendment and was\na classic example of a content-based restriction that could\nnot survive strict scrutiny.\n\n    The panel held that \u00a7 18-7042(1)(b)\u2014which\ncriminalizes obtaining records of an agricultural production\nfacility by misrepresentation\u2014protected against a legally\ncognizable harm associated with a false statement and\ntherefore survived constitutional scrutiny under United\nStates v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. 709 (2012). Finally, the panel\nupheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 18-7042(1)(c), which\ncriminalizes obtaining employment by misrepresentation\nwith the intent to cause economic or other injury. The panel\nrejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the statute would reach \u201ca\nperson who overstates her education or experience to get a\njob for which she otherwise would not have qualified,\nwhether the person is an undercover investigator or not,\u201d\nbecause in such a case, the law\u2019s requisite intent to injure\nwould not be satisfied.\n\n    Dissenting in part and concurring in part, Judge Bea\nstated that subsection \u00a7 18-7042(1)(a), pertaining to the\n\f4       ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\ncriminalization of misrepresentations to enter a production\nfacility, should survive First Amendment review. Judge Bea\nwould hold that the ability to hold property or to exercise\ncontrol of it requires recognition by courts of the owner\u2019s\nright to exclusive possession of the land\u2014the right to\nexclude anyone from entry, at any time, and for any reason\nat all or indeed for no reason.\n\n\n                        COUNSEL\n\nCarl Jeffrey Withroe (argued) and Clay R.

By all\naccounts, the video was disturbing: dairy workers were\nshown dragging a cow across the ground by a chain attached\n\n    1\n       See Brooke Kroeger, Undercover Reporting: An American\nTradition, IRE J. 20 (Spring 2014).\n\n    2\n      Upton Sinclair, The Jungle (Dover Thrift eds., Dover Publications\n2001) (1906).\n\f         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V.

Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042. That\nlegislation\u2014targeted at undercover investigation of\nagricultural operations\u2014broadly criminalizes making\nmisrepresentations to access an agricultural production\nfacility as well as making audio and video recordings of the\nfacility without the owner\u2019s consent. Statutes of this genre\u2014\ndubbed by some as Ag-Gag laws\u2014have been passed in\nseveral western states. 4\n\n    This appeal highlights the tension between journalists\u2019\nclaimed First Amendment right to engage in undercover\ninvestigations and the state\u2019s effort to protect privacy and\nproperty rights in the agricultural industry. Idaho challenges\nthe district court\u2019s determination that four subsections of the\nstatute\u2014\u00a7 18-7042(1)(a)\u2013(d)\u2014are unconstitutional on First\nAmendment and Equal Protection grounds.

WASDEN\n\nLeague Defense Fund and various other animal rights\norganizations (collectively \u201cALDF\u201d) urge us to uphold the\ndistrict court\u2019s injunction against enforcement of the statute,\narguing that the law criminalizes whistleblower activity and\nundercover investigative reporting\u2014a form of speech that\nhas brought about important and widespread change to the\nfood industry, an arena at the forefront of public interest.\n\n    Our analysis is framed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision\nin United States v. Alvarez, which addressed the First\nAmendment and false speech. 567 U.S. 709 (2012). We\nconclude that Idaho\u2019s criminalization of misrepresentations\nto enter a production facility, \u00a7 18-7042(1)(a), and ban on\naudio and video recordings of a production facility\u2019s\noperations, \u00a7 18-7042(1)(d), cover protected speech under\nthe First Amendment and cannot survive constitutional\nscrutiny. In contrast, in accord with Alvarez, Idaho\u2019s\ncriminalization of misrepresentations to obtain records and\nsecure employment are not protected speech under the First\nAmendment and do not violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n\u00a7 18-7042(1)(b)\u2013(c). Thus, we affirm in part and reverse in\npart the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor\nof ALDF and vacate in part its permanent injunction against\nenforcement of the statute.\n\n    We are sensitive to journalists\u2019 constitutional right to\ninvestigate and publish expos\u00e9s on the agricultural industry.\nMatters related to food safety and animal cruelty are of\nsignificant public importance.         However, the First\nAmendment right to gather news within legal bounds does\nnot exempt journalists from laws of general applicability.\nFor this reason, we uphold the provisions that fall within\nconstitutional parameters, but strike down those limitations\nthat impinge on protected speech.\n\f        ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN                9\n\n                       Background\n\nThe Investigation\n\n    In 2012, an animal rights activist went undercover to get\na job at an Idaho dairy farm and then secretly filmed ongoing\nanimal abuse there. Mercy for Animals, an animal rights\ngroup, publicly released portions of the video, drawing\nnational attention. The dairy farm owner responded to the\nvideo by firing the abusive employees who were caught on\ncamera, instituting operational protocols, and conducting an\nanimal welfare audit at the farm. Local law enforcement\nauthorities launched an investigation that culminated in the\nconviction of one of the employees for animal cruelty. After\nthe video\u2019s release, the dairy farm owner and his family\nreceived multiple threats.\n\nIdaho\u2019s Interference with Agricultural Production\nStatute\n\n    In February 2014, Idaho enacted a law criminalizing\n\u201cinterference with agricultural production\u201d to protect Idaho\nfarmers. See Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042. Relevant here, a person\ncommits the crime of interference with agricultural\nproduction if the person knowingly:\n\n       (a)      Is not employed by an agricultural\n       production facility and enters an agricultural\n       facility by force, threat, misrepresentation or\n       trespass;\n\n       (b)    Obtains records of an agricultural\n       production facility by force, threat,\n       misrepresentation or trespass;\n\f10        ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V.

The bill was drafted by the\nIdaho Dairymen\u2019s Association, a trade organization\nrepresenting Idaho\u2019s dairy industry. When the Association\u2019s\nlawyer addressed legislators, he stated that one goal of the\nbill was \u201cto protect Idaho farmers from wrongful\ninterference. . . . Idaho farmers live and work spread out\nacross the land where they\u2019re uniquely vulnerable to\ninterference by wrongful conduct.\u201d Another goal was to\nshield the agricultural industry from undercover\n\n\nplanting, irrigating, growing, fertilizing, harvesting or producing\nagricultural, horticultural, floricultural and viticultural crops, fruits and\nvegetable products, field grains, seeds, hay, sod and nursery stock, and\nother plants, plant products, plant byproducts, plant waste and plant\ncompost; breeding, hatching, raising, producing, feeding and keeping\nlivestock, dairy animals, swine, furbearing animals, poultry, eggs, fish\nand other aquatic species, and other animals, animal products and animal\nbyproducts, animal waste, animal compost, and bees, bee products and\nbee byproducts; processing and packaging agricultural products,\nincluding the processing and packaging of agricultural products into food\nand other agricultural commodities; [and] manufacturing animal feed.\u201d\nIdaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(2)(a).\n\f12      ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\ninvestigators who expose the industry to the \u201ccourt of public\nopinion,\u201d which destroys farmers\u2019 reputations, results in\ndeath threats, and causes loss of customers.\n\n    At the time of the passage of this legislation, Idaho\nalready had a law relating to interference with agricultural\nresearch\u2014which has not been challenged\u2014prohibiting\nknowingly damaging or obtaining property at an agricultural\nresearch facility with intent to hinder agricultural research;\nobtaining access to an agricultural research facility by\nmisrepresentation with the intent to perform acts that would\nhinder agricultural research; entering an agricultural\nresearch facility with the intent to damage, alter, duplicate or\nobtain unauthorized possession of records or property\nrelated to the agricultural research; obtaining control over\nrecords or property of an agricultural research facility with\nintent to destroy such property without authorization of the\nfacility; and releasing, stealing, or causing death or injury to\nan animal at an agricultural research facility. Idaho Code\n\u00a7 18-7040(1). The Idaho Dairymen\u2019s Association used this\ninterference with agricultural research law as the framework\nfor \u00a7 18-7041.\n\n    Legislators discussed the bill as protecting against two\ntypes of perceived harm to agricultural producers. First,\nlawmakers expressed concern about physical and\noperational damage caused by animal rights activists who\ngain access to agricultural production facilities. For\nexample, some legislators discussed concerns about farm\nsecurity and privacy. Others voiced concerns about the\nintentional destruction of crops, breeding records, and farm\nstructures.\n\n    Lawmakers also discussed damage caused by\ninvestigative reporting: \u201cOne of the things that bothers me\na lot about the undercover investigation [at the dairy], and\n\f          ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V.

His dismissal is not\nchallenged on appeal.\n\f14      ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\n    The district court granted ALDF\u2019s motion for summary\njudgment on its First Amendment and Equal Protection\nclaims. The district court concluded that the prohibitions on\nmisrepresentations         in     \u00a7 18-7042(1)(a)\u2013(c)     (the\n\u201cMisrepresentation Clauses\u201d) criminalize speech protected\nby the First Amendment because Idaho could not \u201cshow the\nlies it seeks to prohibit cause any legally cognizable harm.\u201d\nThe court explained that the regulation on audio and video\nrecordings under \u00a7 18-7042(1)(d) (the \u201cRecordings Clause\u201d)\ncovers speech protected by the First Amendment and\ndiscriminates based on content because it criminalizes only\n\u201crecordings of the conduct of an agricultural production\nfacility\u2019s operations.\u201d The district court further reasoned\nthat subsections (c) (misrepresentation to gain employment)\nand (d) (the Recordings Clause) discriminate on the basis of\nviewpoint because they \u201cburden speech critical of the\nanimal-agriculture industry.\u201d Applying strict scrutiny to all\nchallenged provisions, the district court resolved that even if\nthe state\u2019s interests in privacy and property were compelling,\nthe restrictions were neither narrowly tailored nor the least\nrestrictive means available to protect those interests.\n\n    The district court also determined that all four challenged\nsubsections violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal\nProtection Clause and fail rational basis review. The\nsubsections fail on their face because they classify between\nwhistleblowers in the agricultural industry and\nwhistleblowers in other industries. The subsections also fail\nthrough their purpose because they were \u201canimated by an\nimproper animus toward animal welfare groups and other\nundercover investigators in the agricultural industry\u201d and\n\u201cfurther[] no other legitimate or rational purpose.\u201d The court\nnoted that there was \u201cabundant evidence that the law was\nenacted with the discriminatory purpose of silencing animal\n\f        ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V.

Idaho appeals the district court\u2019s\ngrant of summary judgment, which we review de novo.\nRoberts v. Continental Ins.

The Misrepresentation Clauses:           Idaho Code\n      \u00a7 18-7042(1)(a)\u2013(c)\n\n    Subsections     (a),   (b)   and    (c)   criminalize\nmisrepresentations used to gain entry to agricultural\nproduction facilities, obtain records, and, under certain\ncircumstances, secure employment. Relevant here, a person\ncommits the crime of interference with agricultural\nproduction if the person knowingly:\n\n       (a)      Is not employed by an agricultural\n       production facility and enters an agricultural\n       facility by force, threat, misrepresentation or\n       trespass;\n\n       (b)    Obtains records of an agricultural\n       production facility by force, threat,\n       misrepresentation or trespass; [or]\n\n       (c)     Obtains employment with an\n       agricultural facility by force, threat, or\n       misrepresentation with the intent to cause\n       economic or other injury to the facility\u2019s\n       operations, livestock, crops, owners,\n\f16      ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V.

ALDF counters that the subsections\nregulate pure speech, effectively prohibiting investigative\nreporters from accessing agricultural production facilities\nand therefore blocking reporters\u2019 access to material for\njournalistic expos\u00e9s.\n\n    The First Amendment, applied to states through the\nFourteenth Amendment, prohibits laws \u201cabridging the\nfreedom of speech.\u201d U.S. Const., amend I. Our first task is\nto determine whether the misrepresentations prohibited in\nthe Idaho statute constitute speech protected by the First\nAmendment. See Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. Fund &\nEduc. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 797 (1985). If the\ngovernment\u2019s actions do not implicate speech protected by\nthe First Amendment, we \u201cneed go no further.\u201d Id.\n\n    In Alvarez, the Supreme Court examined the Stolen\nValor Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 704 (\u201cthe Act\u201d), a statute\ncriminalizing false claims that the speaker had received the\nCongressional Medal of Honor. 567 U.S. 709 (2012).\nJustice Kennedy\u2019s plurality opinion (joined by the Chief\nJustice and Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor), as well as\nJustice Breyer\u2019s concurring opinion (joined by Justice\nKagan), concluded that the Act\u2019s flat prohibition of such lies\nconstituted an impermissible restriction on speech protected\nby the First Amendment. Id. at 729\u201330 (plurality opinion);\nid. at 739 (Breyer, J., concurring). In deciding that lying\nabout receiving the Medal of Honor, without more, is\nprotected speech, the plurality and concurrence \u201creject[ed]\n\f          ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN                       17\n\nthe notion that false speech should be in a general category\nthat is presumptively unprotected.\u201d Id. at 722 (plurality\nopinion); accord id. at 731\u201332 (Breyer, J., concurring).\n\n    However, neither the plurality nor the concurrence in\nAlvarez held that false statements are always protected under\nthe First Amendment. Instead, as the plurality outlines, false\nspeech may be criminalized if made \u201cfor the purpose of\nmaterial gain\u201d or \u201cmaterial advantage,\u201d or if such speech\ninflicts a \u201clegally cognizable harm.\u201d Id. at 723, 719. The\nconcurring justices agreed: statutes that criminalize falsities\ntypically require proof of specific or tangible harm. Id. at\n734\u201336. We thus focus our attention on misrepresentations\nof the type singled out by the Court\u2014false statements made\nfor material gain or advantage or that inflict harm.\n\n    A. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(1)(a):                       Entry      by\n       Misrepresentation\n\n    Subsection (a) criminalizes entry into an agricultural\nproduction facility \u201cby force, threat, misrepresentation or\ntrespass.\u201d     Notably, ALDF challenges only the\n\u201cmisrepresentation\u201d prong of this subsection. 8 And, as we\nnote below, Idaho can easily address the problematic term\nby simply excising \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d from this\nsubsection. Thus, entry by force, threat or trespass would\ncontinue to be a criminal violation.\n\n\n\n    8\n      The same is true of subsections (b) and (c); ALDF challenges only\nthe misrepresentation prongs. In its opening brief, Idaho limits the\ndefinition of a \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d to an affirmative misrepresentation\u2014\nnot an omission: \u201c[t]his means that the representations must be\naffirmative; omissions are insufficient. And they must be knowingly\nfalse. Mistakes or opinions will not support a prosecution.\u201d\n\f18      ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\n    Guided by Alvarez, we conclude that subsection (a)\u2019s\nmisrepresentation provision regulates speech protected by\nthe First Amendment. The targeted speech\u2014a false\nstatement made in order to access an agricultural production\nfacility\u2014cannot on its face be characterized as \u201cmade to\neffect a fraud or secure moneys or other valuable\nconsiderations.\u201d Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 723 (plurality\nopinion). Nor can the misrepresentation provision be\ncharacterized as simply proscribing conduct. Like the\nstatute in Alvarez, subsection (a) \u201cseeks to control and\nsuppress all false statements [related to access] in almost\nlimitless times and settings. And it does so entirely without\nregard to whether the lie was made for the purpose of\nmaterial gain.\u201d Id. at 722\u201323 (plurality opinion). Unlike\nlying to obtain records or gain employment\u2014which are\nassociated with a material benefit to the speaker\u2014lying to\ngain entry merely allows the speaker to cross the threshold\nof another\u2019s property, including property that is generally\nopen to the public. The hazard of this subsection is that it\ncriminalizes innocent behavior, that the overbreadth of this\nsubsection\u2019s coverage is staggering, and that the purpose of\nthe statute was, in large part, targeted at speech and\ninvestigative journalists.\n\n     Idaho\u2019s argument that \u201cthe material gain to the person\ntelling the lie is the entry to the property,\u201d is not supported\nby any authority and does not establish how entry onto the\nproperty and material gain are coextensive. Under the\nstatute, any misrepresentation to gain entry could net a\ncriminal prosecution. Take, for example, a teenager who\nwants to impress his friends by obtaining a highly sought\nafter reservation at an exclusive pop-up restaurant that is\nopen to the public. If he were to call the restaurant and\nfinagle a reservation in the name of his mother, a well-\nknown journalist, that would be a misrepresentation. If the\n\f          ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN                          19\n\nrestaurant offers up a reservation on the basis of the mother\u2019s\nnotoriety, granting a \u201clicense\u201d to enter the premises and sit\nat a table, the teenager would be subject to punishment of up\nto one year in prison, a fine not to exceed $5,000, or both.\n\n    The teenager risks this potential despite the fact that he\nmight leave before ordering, be discovered and removed by\nthe manager, or his friends might not be impressed at all. In\nthose instances, he would not receive even the secondary\nbenefits of having gained access. In fact, all our teenager\nwould have to do is enter the restaurant and he could be\narrested because he gave a false name to the ma\u00eetre d' on the\nphone. This entry alone does not constitute a material gain,\nand without more, the lie is pure speech. 9\n\n    Or the lunch could go off without a hitch. The restaurant\nis none the wiser, it gets paid for the meal, and loses nothing,\nbut the teenager could still be subject to prosecution. Once\nagain, the lie is pure speech.\n\n   The teenager does not necessarily even gain protection\nfrom trespass liability. Idaho\u2019s criminal trespass law\nprohibits \u201c[e]ntering without permission of the owner or the\n\n    9\n      We disagree with the district court\u2019s suggestion that the only harm\nfrom gaining access to property by misrepresentation \u201cwould arise, say,\nfrom the publication of a story about the facility.\u201d Such reasoning is\nproblematic because it assumes, among other things, that a publication\nabout the facility will necessarily harm the facility. At issue here is the\nspeech to gain entry to the facility, not the journalistic creation or\nspeculative harm that may \u201carise\u201d after entry. Focusing on such\nspeculative harm sweeps in too many scenarios in which a person\nentering the property causes no harm to the property or its owner. This\napproach also places a value judgment on the reporting itself and\nundermines the First Amendment right to critique and criticize.\n\f20        ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V.

Idaho Code\n\u00a7 18-7008(9). Thus, even if the dissent is correct that the\nteenager receives a license that would not otherwise have\nbeen granted, since in some circumstances the teenager may\nhave entered the restaurant with no permission without\ntrespassing, he gains little to nothing from his\nmisrepresentation. 10\n\n    Two earlier cases involving investigative reporters and\ntrespass in the First Amendment context foreshadowed the\ndecision in Alvarez, albeit in slightly different scenarios.\nThe Fourth Circuit in Food Lion, Inc. v. Capital Cities/ABC,\nInc., 194 F.3d 505 (1999), and the Seventh Circuit in\nDesnick v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., 44 F.3d\n1345 (1995), examined whether plaintiffs in a civil action\ncould maintain a trespass claim against journalists for\nmisrepresenting their identities. Both courts invalidated the\ntrespass claim predicated on the misrepresentations because\n\u201cthe entry was not invasive in the sense of infringing the kind\nof interest of the plaintiffs that the law of trespass protects;\nit was not an interference with the ownership or possession\nof land.\u201d Desnick, 44 F.3d at 1353; Food Lion, 194 F.3d at\n518 (\u201c[I]f we turned successful resume fraud into trespass,\nwe would not be protecting the interest underlying the tort of\ntrespass\u2014the ownership and peaceable possession of\n\n     10\n        The dissent\u2019s citation to Green v.

Rather, it is a civil contract matter and the\nquestion\u2014left unanswered\u2014was whether there were any civil damages\nfor trespass by a contractor who traversed land without authorization.\n\f          ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V.

Desnick, 44 F.3d at 1351. This language is\nprescient in its tracking of Alvarez\u2019s reasoning: some lies\nquite simply do not inflict any material or legal harm on the\ndeceived party. See Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 718\u201319 (plurality\nopinion); see also id. at 736 (Breyer, J., concurring) (statutes\nproperly prohibiting false statements are those with\n\u201climitations of context, or requirements of proof of injury\u201d\nto narrow the prohibition to \u201ca subset of lies where specific\nharm is more likely to occur\u201d and not \u201cwhere harm is\nunlikely or the need for the prohibition is small.\u201d).\n\n     Re-visiting our teenager, we have already established\nthat he is not guilty of ordinary criminal trespass in the\nabsence of a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign. However, as with a\njournalist or even a curiosity seeker who dissembles to get\naccess to the property, under the challenged Idaho law, the\nteenager would be subject to criminal prosecution for\nnothing more than what can only be characterized as a fib.\nThus, the misrepresentation provision of subsection (a)\nregulates protected speech while \u201ctarget[ing] falsity and\nnothing more.\u201d Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 719 (plurality opinion).\nSuch regulation is subject to the \u201cmost exacting scrutiny.\u201d\nId. at 724 (quoting Turner Broad.

Subsection (a) cannot survive this high bar.\n\n    Even assuming Idaho has a compelling interest in\nregulating property rights and protecting its farm industry,\ncriminalizing access to property by misrepresentation is not\n\u201cactually necessary\u201d to protect those rights. If, as Idaho\nargues, its real concern is trespass, then Idaho already has a\nprohibition against trespass that does not implicate speech in\nany way. If instead, as a number of the legislators made clear\nand the dairy lobby underscored, the statute was intended to\nquash investigative reporting on agricultural production\nfacilities, then the speech aspect of the statute prohibiting\nmisrepresentations is even more problematic. The focus of\nthe statute to avoid the \u201ccourt of public opinion\u201d and\ntreatment of investigative videos as \u201cblackmail\u201d cannot be\nsquared with a content-neutral trespass law.\n\n    It is troubling that criminalization of these\nmisrepresentations opens the door to selective\nprosecutions\u2014for example, pursuing the case of a journalist\nwho produces a 60 Minutes segment about animal cruelty\nversus letting the misrepresentation go unchecked in the case\nof the teenager. As Justice Breyer aptly noted in his\nconcurrence,\n\n       the pervasiveness of false statements, made\n       for better or for worse motives, made\n       thoughtlessly or deliberately, made with or\n       without accompanying harm, provides a\n       weapon to a government broadly empowered\n       to prosecute falsity without more.

In this case, the targeted group\u2014journalists and\ninvestigative reporters\u2014could also face enhanced penalties.\nViolating Idaho\u2019s criminal trespass statute could result in up\nto six months in prison, a fine not in excess of $1,000, or\nboth, see Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7011(1), whereas the penalty\nunder the agricultural protection provision, \u00a7 18-7042, could\nbe up to one year in prison, a fine not in excess of $5,000, or\nboth.\n\n    We are also unsettled by the sheer breadth of this\nsubsection given the definitions of \u201cagricultural production\nfacility\u201d and \u201cagricultural production.\u201d Id. \u00a7 18-7042(2)(a),\n(b). Applying these definitions, the subsection reaches\nmisrepresentations not only in the context of a large-scale\ndairy facility or cattle feedlot, but also grocery stores, garden\nnurseries, restaurants that have an herb garden or grow their\nown produce, llama farms that produce wool for weaving,\nbeekeepers, a chicken coop in the backyard, a field\nproducing crops for ethanol, and hardware stores, to name a\nfew. See Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 722 (plurality opinion)\n(criticizing the Act for having \u201csweeping, quite\nunprecedented reach\u201d).\n\n    The subsection\u2019s reach is particularly worrisome\nbecause many of the covered entities are, unlike large-scale\ndairy facilities, places of business that are open to the public.\nImagine a situation in which an Albertsons grocery store\nopens early to the first one hundred affinity cardholders to\nvisit the new, spectacular food court. Given the expansive\ndefinition of \u201cagricultural production,\u201d the Albertsons store\n\f24      ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\nwould be covered under the statute as a facility where\nagricultural products are \u201cprocess[ed] and package[ed] . . .\ninto food.\u201d An enterprising person with no Albertsons card,\nbut representing otherwise, or even someone using a friend\u2019s\nAlbertsons card, falls prey to the statute simply because he\nwants to see the food-court extravaganza. Under subsection\n(a), our protagonist would be guilty of a misdemeanor and\ncould be punished by up to one year in prison, a fine not in\nexcess of $5,000, or both\u2014not to mention a potential\nrestitution award. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(3), (4). The same\ncan be said for a restaurant critic who goes undercover,\nclaiming to be a repeat customer in order to get a prime table\nfrom which to review the restaurant\u2019s food, service, and\nambiance. In these scenarios, the statute punishes speech\nwhere there is no fraud, no gain, and no valuable\nconsideration.\n\n    The limitation that a misrepresentation must be\n\u201cknowing[]\u201d does not eliminate the threat posed by this\nsubsection\u2019s staggering reach. The fact that the subsection\nregulates speech related to property far beyond a classic\nagricultural facility would invariably result in the chilling of\nlawful speech. Indeed, \u201ca speaker might still be worried\nabout being prosecuted for a careless false statement, even\nif he does not have the intent required to render him liable.\u201d\nAlvarez, 567 U.S. at 736 (Breyer, J., concurring) (applying\nintermediate scrutiny).\n\n    Nor is this subsection the \u201cleast restrictive means among\navailable, effective alternatives.\u201d Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542\nU.S. 656, 666 (2004). We see no reason, and Idaho has not\noffered any, why the state could not narrow the subsection\nby requiring specific intent or by limiting criminal liability\nto statements that cause a particular harm. Idaho did exactly\nthat with subsection (c), which covers misrepresentation\n\f        ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN                 25\n\n\u201cwith the intent to cause economic or other injury.\u201d It is no\nsurprise that after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Alvarez,\nCongress amended the Stolen Valor Act to criminalize only\nthose \u201c[w]hoever, with intent to obtain money, property, or\nother tangible benefit, fraudulently hold[] oneself out to be\na recipient\u201d of a qualifying medal. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 704(b)\n(2013) (emphasis added). Such a limitation would still\neffectuate agricultural production facility owners\u2019 property\nrights while complying with Alvarez\u2019s relatively\nstraightforward First Amendment requirements.\n\n     The reach of subsection (a) is so broad that it gives rise\nto suspicion that it may have been enacted with an\nimpermissible purpose. See Elena Kagan, Private Speech,\nPublic Purpose: The Role of Governmental Motive in First\nAmendment Doctrine, 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 413, 455 (1996)\n(\u201cAt a certain point\u2014when the asserted interest is\ninsubstantial or when it does not fit the scope of the\nchallenged regulation\u2014the usual presumption of proper\npurpose topples; there is reason, then, to think that the law,\nthough content neutral, has been tainted by impermissible\npurpose.\u201d). Our suspicion is not eased after reading the\nlegislative history. The record reflects that the statute was\npartly motivated to protect members of the agricultural\nindustry from \u201cpersecut[ion] in the court of public opinion,\u201d\nand journalists who use expos\u00e9s to \u201cpublicly crucify a\ncompany.\u201d Although, for Equal Protection Clause purposes,\nwe need not decide whether animus motivated this\nsubsection, we do not ignore that a vocal number of\nsupporters were less concerned with the protection of\nproperty than they were about protecting a target group from\ncritical speech, which adds to our skepticism that the\nprovision survives the \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d required under\nAlvarez. See FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468\nU.S. 364, 387 n.18 (1984) (expressing skepticism about the\n\f26       ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\nmotivation behind a bill when some supporters were\nconcerned with protecting themselves from critical speech).\n\n    In the same vein, if intermediate scrutiny is the standard,\nas Justice Breyer advocates in Alvarez, then this subsection\nwould still fail. Subsection (a) criminalizes speech that\ninflicts no \u201cspecific harm\u201d on property owners, \u201cranges very\nbroadly,\u201d and risks significantly chilling speech that is not\ncovered under the statute. Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 736\u201337\n(Breyer J., concurring). Additionally, it is \u201cpossible\nsubstantially to achieve the Government\u2019s objective in less\nburdensome ways\u201d with \u201ca more finely tailored statute.\u201d Id.\nat 737. Even under intermediate scrutiny, the subsection\n\u201cworks disproportionate constitutional harm.\u201d Id. at 739.\n\n     There is, of course, an easy fix to this First Amendment\nproblem: simply strike the word \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d from\nthe subsections. Idaho explicitly invites this result in its\ndiscussion of the statute\u2019s severability clause, and ALDF\u2019s\nsurgical challenge indirectly endorses this remedy. Under\nIdaho law, an invalid portion of a statute may be severed\nwhere \u201cpart of a statute . . . is unconstitutional and yet is not\nan integral or indispensable part of the measure.\u201d Voyles v.\nCity of Nampa, 548 P.2d 1217, 1220 (Idaho 1976). Because\nthe proscription on misrepresentations is neither integral nor\nindispensable to the subsection\u2019s goal of protecting property\nrights, the offending term \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d should be\nstricken, leaving the remainder of the subsection intact. In\nlight of this resolution, we need not analyze subsection (a)\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.\n\f          ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN                        27\n\n    B. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(1)(b): Obtaining Records\n       by Misrepresentation\n\n    Subsection (b)\u2014which criminalizes obtaining records of\nan agricultural production facility by misrepresentation 12\u2014\nprotects against a \u201clegally cognizable harm associated with\na false statement\u201d and therefore survives constitutional\nscrutiny under Alvarez. 567 U.S. at 719. Alvarez highlights\nthat a false statement made in association with a legally\ncognizable harm or for the purpose of material gain is not\nprotected. Id. at 719, 723. Unlike false statements made to\nenter property, false statements made to actually acquire\nagricultural production facility records inflict a property\nharm upon the owner, and may also bestow a material gain\non the acquirer.\n\n    This subsection is aimed at conduct\u2014obtaining\nrecords\u2014that has long been prohibited in Idaho. For\ndecades, Idaho has lawfully proscribed similar types of\nconduct that infringe on property rights. For example, Idaho\ncriminalizes conversion, which involves \u201cany distinct act of\ndominion wrongfully exerted over another\u2019s personal\nproperty in denial or inconsistent with his rights therein.\u201d\nWiseman v. Schaffer, 768 P.2d 800, 803 (Idaho 1989)\n(citation omitted); see also Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 18-2403(3),\n18-7001(1). Idaho also criminalizes theft by false pretenses,\nwhich involves \u201ca wrongful taking, obtaining or withholding\nof another\u2019s property\u201d by conduct constituting \u201cobtaining\nproperty, money or labor under false pretenses.\u201d Idaho Code\n\u00a7 18-2403(2); State v. Larsen, 286 P.2d 646, 648 (Idaho\n\n    12\n      We read the statute to cover records obtained from the agricultural\nproduction facility and not as implicating records obtained via Idaho\u2019s\nPublic Records Act, Idaho Code \u00a7 74-101 et seq., or other lawful\navenues.\n\f28      ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\n1955) (citation omitted) (\u201c[a] false pretense may consist in\nany act, word, symbol, or token calculated and intended to\ndeceive\u201d).     Larceny, which involves the \u201cfraudulent\nobtaining of personal property, and carrying that property\naway with the intent permanently to deprive the owner\nthereof,\u201d is also prohibited. State v. Jesser, 501 P.2d 727,\n736 & n.29 (Idaho 1972). Criminalizing the obtaining of\nrecords by misrepresentation is one of a variety of Idaho\nstatutes that protect property rights.         Obtaining an\nagricultural     production     facility\u2019s     records    by\nmisrepresentation inflicts a \u201clegally cognizable harm\u201d by\nimpairing an agricultural production facility owner\u2019s ability\nto control who can assert dominion over, and take possession\nof, his property. Additionally, obtaining records through\nmisrepresentation may also infringe on other rights by, for\nexample, exposing proprietary formulas, trade secrets, or\nother confidential business information to unwanted parties.\nSee Idaho Code \u00a7 48-801 et seq. (prohibiting\nmisappropriation of trade secrets).\n\n    The legislative history illustrates how such conduct has\nharmed, and threatens to harm, agricultural production\nfacility owners. For example, legislators expressed general\nconcern about damage to breeding papers, and one legislator\nnoted an instance in which the breeding papers of a mink\nranch were \u201ctossed\u201d into a \u201cpile,\u201d \u201cdamag[ing] the whole\noperation.\u201d The agricultural industry also expressed concern\nabout the theft of facility records, particularly when such\ntheft leads to the release of a facility\u2019s proprietary and\nconfidential information, including divulging locations of\ngenetically engineered crops or valuable research documents\nfor sale to competitors. Although some legislators wanted\nto silence investigative journalists reporting on the\nagricultural industry, the full legislative history shows that a\n\f         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN                       29\n\nlegitimate purpose for enacting the subsection was to prevent\nharm from damaged or stolen records.\n\n    Obtaining records may also bestow a \u201cmaterial gain\u201d on\nthe speaker. See Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 723 (plurality opinion).\nThe records may contain confidential information, such as\nbreeding histories of animals and livestock, and other\nproprietary research and development information valuable\nto those in the industry. Once disclosed, this information\nmay lose its confidential or proprietary research status.\n\n   Acquiring records by misrepresentation results in\nsomething definitively more than does entry onto land\u2014it\nwreaks actual and potential harm on a facility and bestows\nmaterial gain on the fibber. So unlike subsection (a),\nsubsection (b) does not regulate constitutionally protected\nspeech, and does not run afoul of the First Amendment. 13\n\n    Nor does subsection (b) violate the Equal Protection\nClause. The district court determined that the statute was\n\u201canimated by an improper animus toward animal welfare\ngroups and other undercover investigators in the agricultural\nindustry\u201d and could not survive rational basis review. We\nagree that animus was one of the motivating factors but\ndisagree as to the conclusion.\n\n    Legislation is generally presumed to be valid and will be\nsustained under the Equal Protection Clause \u201cif the\nclassification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a\nlegitimate state interest.\u201d City of Cleburne v. Cleburne\nLiving Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985). However, neither \u201ca\n\n    13\n       Because we determine that subsections (b) and (c) do not burden\nspeech protected by the First Amendment, the subsections do not\ndiscriminate on the basis of the fundamental right to speech.\n\f30      ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\nbare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group\u201d nor\n\u201cnegative attitude[s]\u201d or \u201cfears\u201d about that group constitute\na legitimate government interest for the purpose of this\nreview. Id. at 448. When a law exhibits a desire to harm an\nunpopular group, courts will often apply a \u201cmore searching\u201d\napplication of rational basis review. Lawrence v. Texas, 539\nU.S. 558, 580 (2003) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring); see also\nCleburne, 473 at 448\u201350; U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric. v. Moreno,\n413 U.S. 528, 535\u201338 (1973). When the politically\nunpopular group is not a traditionally suspect class, a court\nmay strike down the challenged statute under the Equal\nProtection Clause \u201cif the statute serves no legitimate\ngovernmental purpose and if impermissible animus toward\nan unpopular group prompted the statute\u2019s enactment.\u201d\nMountain Water Co. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Serv.\nRegulation, 919 F.2d 593, 598 (9th Cir. 1990) (emphasis\nadded); Moreno, 413 U.S. at 534.\n\n    We invoke searching scrutiny here. Although animus\ntowards particular speech by reporters and activists was one\nfactor driving Idaho\u2019s decision to pass the statute, to strike\ndown the law, we must also determine whether the law\nserves \u201cno legitimate governmental purpose.\u201d Mountain\nWater Co., 919 F.2d at 598. The overall purpose of \u00a7 18-\n7042 is to protect agricultural production facilities from\ninterference by wrongful conduct. As noted, the legislative\nhistory relevant to subsection (b) describes situations in\nwhich agricultural production facilities have been, or may\nbe, harmed as a result of a misrepresentation leading to the\nacquisition of records. Idaho\u2019s desire to protect against harm\nrelating to an agricultural production facility\u2019s most\nsensitive information\u2014affecting both property rights and\nprivacy interests\u2014is a legitimate government interest. It\nalso bears noting that the penalty provisions for falsely\nobtaining records under this statute are in line with the\n\f        ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN               31\n\npenalties in Idaho\u2019s other statutes relating to records and\nproperty offenses. See, e.g., Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 18-2403(2)(d),\n18-2407, 18-2408 (theft by false promise); 18-7001\n(malicious injury to property); 48-803 (misappropriation of\ntrade secrets). Subsection (b) does not offend the Equal\nProtection Clause because it does not rest exclusively on an\n\u201cirrational prejudice\u201d against journalists and activists.\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 450.\n\n   C. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(1)(c):                Obtaining\n      Employment by Misrepresentation\n\n    Subsection (c) criminalizes knowingly \u201c[o]btain[ing]\nemployment with an agricultural production facility by . . .\nmisrepresentation with the intent to cause economic or other\ninjury\u201d to the facility\u2019s operations, property, or personnel.\nAlmost as though the Idaho legislature drafted this provision\nwith Alvarez by its side, this subsection follows the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s guidance as to what constitutes a lie made for\nmaterial gain. Indeed, the plurality in Alvarez explicitly\nstated that \u201c[w]here false claims are made to effect a fraud\nor secure moneys or other valuable considerations, say offers\nof employment, it is well established that the Government\nmay restrict speech without affronting the First\nAmendment.\u201d 567 U.S. at 723 (emphasis added). The\nmisrepresentations criminalized in subsection (c) fall\nsquarely into this category of speech.\n\n    Additionally, subsection (c) limits criminal liability to\nonly those who gain employment by misrepresentation and\nwho have the intent to cause economic or other injury to the\nagricultural production facility, which further cabins the\nprohibition\u2019s scope. Given this clear limitation, we disagree\nwith ALDF that the statute would reach \u201ca person who\noverstates her education or experience to get a job for which\nshe otherwise would not have qualified, whether the person\n\f32      ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\nis an undercover investigator or not,\u201d because the requisite\nintent to injure would not be satisfied. On the other hand,\nthis subsection would apply to an employee hired with an\nintent to harm the employer, which, as Idaho points out, is a\nbreach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is\nimplied in all employment agreements in Idaho. Jenkins v.\nBoise Cascade Corp., 108 P.3d 380, 389\u201390 (Idaho 2005);\ncf. Shackelford v. Shirley, 948 F.2d 935, 938 (5th Cir. 1991)\n(\u201c[T]hreats made with specific intent to injure and focused\non a particular individual easily fall into that category of\nspeech deserving of no first amendment protection.\u201d).\n\n    Although it may be true that \u201c[t]he goal of undercover\nemployment-based investigations is not to \u2018secure moneys\nor other valuable considerations\u2019 for the investigator, but\nrather to expose threats to the public,\u201d ALDF ignores that the\nSupreme Court singled out offers of employment and that\nthese undercover investigators are nonetheless paid by the\nagricultural production facility as part of their employment.\nOf course, this does not mean that every investigative\nreporter hired under false pretenses intends to harm the\nemployer. That is a critical element that requires proof.\n\n    We are also not persuaded by ALDF\u2019s arguments that the\nstatute was enacted solely to suppress a specific subject\nmatter or viewpoint. See R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S.\n377, 384 (1992). We reject ALDF\u2019s argument that the\nstatute\u2019s restitution clause is a way to punish journalists and\nwhistleblowers for printing expos\u00e9s, because we do not\ninterpret the restitution clause to include reputational and\npublication damages. See Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell,\n485 U.S. 46, 52 (1988).\n\n      The restitution clause requires a court to order a\ndefendant \u201cto make restitution to the victim of the offense\n. . . in an amount equal to twice the value of the damage\n\f          ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN                        33\n\nresulting from the violation\u201d of the statute. Idaho Code\n\u00a7\u00a7 18-7042(4), 19-5304. Restitution is made for the\n\u201ceconomic loss\u201d to the victim. Idaho Code \u00a7 19-5304(1)(a).\nThis includes \u201cthe value of property taken, destroyed,\nbroken, or otherwise harmed, lost wages, and direct out-of-\npocket losses or expenses, such as medical expenses\nresulting from the criminal conduct.\u201d Id. It does not include\n\u201cless tangible damage such as pain and suffering, wrongful\ndeath or emotional distress.\u201d Id.\n\n    That the statute excludes \u201cless tangible damage\u201d such as\nemotional distress indicates that reputational damages would\nnot be considered an \u201ceconomic loss,\u201d and we are not aware\nof a case suggesting otherwise. Rather, Idaho case law\ndefines \u201ceconomic loss\u201d as \u201ctangible out-of-pocket loss\u201d\nwhich the victim \u201cactually suffers.\u201d State v. Straub, 292\nP.3d 273, 280 (Idaho 2013). The restitution clause focuses\non actual, quantifiable economic loss as opposed to abstract\ndamages such as reputational harm. See id. In the absence\nof Idaho case law to the contrary, we read the statute\u2019s\nrestitution clause as excluding reputational and publication\ndamages. 14 See Berger v. City of Seattle, 569 F.3d 1029,\n1046 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (\u201c[W]here an\nunconstitutionally broad statute is readily subject to a\nnarrowing construction that would eliminate its\nconstitutional deficiencies, we accept that construction.\u201d)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n    14\n       On a more basic level, we cannot see how the restitution provision\nis inevitably viewpoint based. Restitution is pegged to economic loss,\nnot to the view expressed, which could be a positive puff piece or a\nnegative critique. The issue is documented loss, not viewpoint.\n\f34       ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\n    The district court erred by granting summary judgment\non this ground.\n\n    For the same reasons as provided in our analysis of\nsubsection (b), subsection (c) does not violate the Equal\nProtection Clause because it serves a \u201clegitimate\ngovernmental purpose.\u201d Mountain Water Co., 919 F.2d at\n598. The same property and privacy concerns apply here\u2014\nemployees have access to limited areas of an agricultural\nproduction facility and other confidential information that\nmay lead to destruction or serious harm\u2014and Idaho has a\nlegitimate governmental purpose in restricting such\nemployment-seeking misrepresentations.         This result\nfollows from Alvarez.             By establishing that\nmisrepresentations to \u201csecure . . . offers of employment\u201d\nmay be restricted, the Court implicitly recognized that a\ngovernment interest exists in restricting such speech.\nAlvarez, 567 U.S. at 723. Thus, this subsection has a\nlegitimate governmental purpose beyond an \u201cirrational\nprejudice\u201d against journalists and activists.      City of\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 450.\n\n     II. The     Recordings       Clause\u2014Idaho          Code\n         \u00a7 18-7042(1)(d)\n\n    We now turn to the Recordings Clause, which prohibits\na person from entering a private agricultural production\nfacility and, without express consent from the facility owner,\nmaking audio or video recordings of the \u201cconduct of an\nagricultural production facility\u2019s operations.\u201d Idaho Code\n\u00a7 18-7042(1)(d). The Recordings Clause regulates speech\nprotected by the First Amendment and is a classic example\nof a content-based restriction that cannot survive strict\nscrutiny.\n\f        ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN               35\n\n    We easily dispose of Idaho\u2019s claim that the act of\ncreating an audiovisual recording is not speech protected by\nthe First Amendment. This argument is akin to saying that\neven though a book is protected by the First Amendment, the\nprocess of writing the book is not. Audiovisual recordings\nare protected by the First Amendment as recognized\n\u201corgan[s] of public opinion\u201d and as a \u201csignificant medium\nfor the communication of ideas.\u201d Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v.\nWilson, 343 U.S. 495, 501 (1952) (extending First\nAmendment protection to movies). Indeed, \u201c[w]e live,\nrelate, work, and decide in a world where image capture\nfrom life is routine, and captured images are part of ongoing\ndiscourse, both public and private.\u201d Seth F. Kreimer,\nPervasive Image Capture and the First Amendment:\nMemory, Discourse, and the Right to Record, 159 U. Pa. L.\nRev. 335, 337 (Jan. 2011).\n\n    It is no surprise that we have recognized that there is a\n\u201cFirst Amendment right to film matters of public interest.\u201d\nFordyce v. City of Seattle, 55 F.3d 436, 439 (9th Cir. 1995).\nIt defies common sense to disaggregate the creation of the\nvideo from the video or audio recording itself. The act of\nrecording is itself an inherently expressive activity;\ndecisions about content, composition, lighting, volume, and\nangles, among others, are expressive in the same way as the\nwritten word or a musical score.\n\n    Rejecting an argument remarkably similar to Idaho\u2019s\npitch here, we observed that\n\n       neither the Supreme Court nor [the Ninth\n       Circuit] has ever drawn a distinction between\n       the process of creating a form of pure speech\n       (such as writing or painting) and the product\n       of these processes (the essay or artwork) in\n       terms of the First Amendment protection\n\f36      ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\n       afforded. . . . The process of expression\n       through a medium has never been thought so\n       distinct from the expression itself that we\n       could disaggregate Picasso from his brushes\n       and canvas, or that we could value Beethoven\n       without the benefit of strings and woodwinds.\n       In other words, we have never seriously\n       questioned that the processes of writing\n       words down on paper, painting a picture, and\n       playing an instrument are purely expressive\n       activities entitled to full First Amendment\n       protection.\n\nAnderson v. City of Hermosa Beach, 621 F.3d 1051, 1061\u2013\n62 (9th Cir. 2010) (determining that the tattooing process is\npurely expressive activity protected by the First\nAmendment); see also ACLU v.

Because the recording process is itself\nexpressive and is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the\nresulting recording, the creation of audiovisual recordings is\nspeech entitled to First Amendment protection as purely\nexpressive activity. See Anderson, 621 F.3d at 1062.\n\n    The Recordings Clause prohibits the recording of a\ndefined topic\u2014\u201cthe conduct of an agricultural production\nfacility\u2019s operations.\u201d This provision is an \u201cobvious\u201d\nexample of a content-based regulation of speech because it\n\u201cdefin[es] regulated speech by particular subject matter.\u201d\n\f        ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN                37\n\nReed v. Town of Gilbert, 135 S. Ct. 2218, 2227 (2015); see\nalso United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 468 (2010) (a\nstatute was content-based when it prohibited \u201cvisual [and]\nauditory depiction[s] . . . depending on whether they depict\nconduct in which a living animal is intentionally harmed\u201d\n(alterations in original)). A regulation is content-based when\nit draws a distinction \u201con its face\u201d regarding the message the\nspeaker conveys or \u201cwhen the purpose and justification for\nthe law are content based.\u201d Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 2228. The\nRecordings Clause checks both boxes. It would permit\nfilming a vineyard\u2019s art collection but not the winemaking\noperation. Likewise, a videographer could record an after-\nhours birthday party among co-workers, a farmer\u2019s antique\ncar collection, or a historic maple tree but not the animal\nabuse, feedlot operation, or slaughterhouse conditions.\n\n    Problematically, Idaho has effectively eliminated the\nsubject matter of any audio and visual recordings of\nagricultural operations made without consent and has\ntherefore \u201cprohibit[ed] public discussion of an entire topic.\u201d\nIn re Nat\u2019l Sec. Letter, 863 F.3d 1110, 1122 (9th Cir. 2017)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). And, because the\nRecordings Clause prohibits the filming of agricultural\n\u201coperations\u201d but nothing else, its application explicitly\npivots on the content of the recording; in other words, only\nby viewing the recording can the Idaho authorities make a\ndetermination about criminal liability. See League of\nWomen Voters, 468 U.S. at 383 (a statute is content-based\nwhen \u201cenforcement authorities must necessarily examine the\ncontent of the message\u201d to determine whether it complies\nwith the statute). Here, the statute depends not just on\n\u201cwhere they say\u201d the message but also\u2014critically\u2014\u201con\nwhat they say.\u201d McCullen v. Coakley, 134 S. Ct. 2518, 2531\n(2014).\n\f38      ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\n    As a content-based regulation, the Recordings Clause is\nconstitutional only if it withstands strict scrutiny, meaning it\n\u201cis necessary to serve a compelling state interest\u201d and \u201cis\nnarrowly drawn to achieve that end.\u201d Perry Educ. Ass\u2019n v.\nPerry Local Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983). Strict\nscrutiny is \u201can exacting test\u201d requiring \u201csome pressing\npublic necessity, some essential value that has to be\npreserved; and even then the law must restrict as little speech\nas possible to serve the goal.\u201d Turner, 512 U.S. at 680. As\nwith the Misrepresentation Clauses, Idaho asserts that the\nRecordings Clause protects both property and privacy\ninterests. Even assuming a compelling government interest,\nIdaho has not satisfied the narrow tailoring requirement\nbecause the statute is both under-inclusive and over-\ninclusive.\n\n    Prohibiting only \u201caudio or video recordings,\u201d but saying\nnothing about photographs, is suspiciously under-inclusive.\nCity of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43, 51 (\u201c[T]hat a regulation\nof speech may be impermissibly underinclusive is firmly\ngrounded in basic First Amendment principles.\u201d). Why the\nmaking of audio and video recordings of operations would\nimplicate property or privacy harms, but photographs of the\nsame content would not, is a mystery. This distinction defies\nthe old adage that \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words.\u201d\n\n    Nor has Idaho explained how limiting the filming of\noperations, but nothing else, effectuates its interests better\nthan eliminating all audio and video recordings at\nagricultural production facilities. Presumably, for example,\nan unauthorized recording of the agricultural production\nfacility\u2019s buildings would still implicate Idaho\u2019s concerns\nabout property, and the unauthorized filming of an employee\nbirthday party would implicate concerns about privacy.\nWithout some legitimate explanation, we are left to conclude\n\f        ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN                 39\n\nthat Idaho is singling out for suppression one mode of\nspeech\u2014audio and video recordings of agricultural\noperations\u2014to keep controversy and suspect practices out of\nthe public eye. Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 2229 (content-based laws\nlend themselves to use for \u201cinvidious, thought-control\npurposes\u201d). The district court aptly noted that \u201c[t]he\nrecording prohibition gives agricultural facility owners veto\npower, allowing owners to decide what can and cannot be\nrecorded, effectively turning them into state-backed censors\nable to silence unfavorable speech about their facilities.\u201d\n\n    The Recordings Clause is also over-inclusive and\nsuppresses more speech than necessary to further Idaho\u2019s\nstated goals of protecting property and privacy. See Lone\nStar Security and Video, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 827 F.3d\n1192, 1197 (9th Cir. 2016). Because there are \u201cvarious other\nlaws at [Idaho\u2019s] disposal that would allow it to achieve its\nstated interests while burdening little or no speech,\u201d the law\nis not narrowly tailored. Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo\nBeach v. City of Redondo Beach, 657 F.3d 936, 949 (9th Cir.\n2011) (en banc) (applying intermediate scrutiny). For\nexample, agricultural production facility owners can\nvindicate their rights through tort laws against theft of trade\nsecrets and invasion of privacy. Idaho Code \u00a7 48-801 et seq.\n(prohibiting misappropriation of trade secrets); Taylor v.\nK.T.V.B., Inc., 525 P.2d 984, 985 (Idaho 1974) (outlining the\ninvasion of privacy torts). To the extent the legislators\nexpressed concern that fabricated recordings of animal abuse\nwould invade privacy rights, the victims can turn to\ndefamation actions for recourse. Even still, as Alvarez points\nout, \u201c[t]he remedy for speech that is false is speech that is\ntrue\u201d\u2014and not, as Idaho would like, the suppression of that\nspeech. 567 U.S. at 727.\n\f40        ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\n    For these reasons, the Recordings Clause cannot survive\nFirst Amendment scrutiny and is therefore unconstitutional.\nIn light of this result, we need not analyze the Recordings\nClause under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n    In sum, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary\njudgment with respect to \u00a7\u00a7 18-7042(1)(a) and (d). We\nreverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment with\nrespect to \u00a7\u00a7 18-7042(1)(b) and (c).

Whilst the majority\nopinion relies on out-of-circuit cases which seemingly limit\na landowner\u2019s rights, 3 but which are distinguishable, I\nchoose to rely on the law of Idaho and the common-law right\nof property, ages old.\n\n    \u201cThere is nothing which so generally strikes the\nimagination, and engages the affections of mankind, as the\nright of property; or that sole and despotic dominion which\none man claims and exercises over the external things of the\nworld, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual\nin the universe.\u201d 2 William Blackstone, COMMENTARIES ON\nTHE LAWS OF ENGLAND *2.

I otherwise concur in the majority\nopinion.\n\n    The majority analyzes this case under United States v.\nAlvarez, in which the Supreme Court invalidated under the\nFirst Amendment the Stolen Valor Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 704, a\nfederal statute which made criminal false claims that the\nspeaker had received the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n567 U.S. 709 (2012). At the outset, it is important to note\nthat subsection (a) of the Idaho statute at issue in this case\ndiffers from the version of the Stolen Valor Act at issue in\nAlvarez in at least one crucial aspect: Whereas the Stolen\nValor Act prohibited the act of lying about a particular\nsubject (receipt of military decorations or medals), 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 704, subsection (a) of Idaho\u2019s statute prohibits the\nact of entering a particular type of property (\u201cagricultural\nproduction facilities\u201d) by particular means (including\n\f          ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN                          43\n\n\u201cmisrepresentation\u201d), Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(1)(a). 4 By the\nplain meaning of the statute, liability attaches only to those\nwho \u201center[]\u201d an agricultural production facility through\nlying, not to any and all who tell lies to agricultural facility\nowners or to the public about such owners. Id. In other\nwords, subsection (a) of the Idaho statute does not prohibit\n\u201cpure speech.\u201d Although under Alvarez a lie\u2014without\n\u201cmore\u201d\u2014is pure speech, 5 the Idaho statute is directed at\nsomething \u201cmore\u201d: the conduct of knowingly entering an\nagricultural facility through the use of a lie. The use of the\nterm \u201centers\u201d is a clear invocation of the standards and\ninterests of the law of trespass. 6 This provision no more\n\n\n\n\n    4\n        Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042 provides that a person commits the\nmisdemeanor crime of \u201cinterference with agricultural production\u201d if the\nperson \u201cknowingly\u201d \u201c(a) [i]s not employed by an agricultural production\nfacility and enters an agricultural production facility by force, threat,\nmisrepresentation, or trespass\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n    5\n      In Alvarez, the Supreme Court explicitly distinguished cases of\n\u201cdefamation, fraud, or some other legally cognizable harm associated\nwith a false statement\u201d from cases that confront \u201ca measure, like the\nStolen Valor Act, that targets falsity and nothing more.\u201d 567 U.S. at 719\n(emphasis added).\n     6\n       \u201cOne who intentionally enters land in the possession of another is\nsubject to liability to the possessor for a trespass, although his presence\non the land causes no harm to the land, its possessor, or to any thing or\nperson in whose security the possessor has a legally protected interest.\u201d\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 163 (1965) (emphasis added). The term\n\u201centers land\u201d is defined \u201cto include, not only coming upon land, but also\nremaining on it, and, in addition, to include the presence upon the land\nof a third person or thing which the actor has caused to be or to remain\nthere.\u201d Id. \u00a7 158.\n\f44        ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V.

Taysom, 349 P.2d 556, 560 (Idaho 1960); see also\nNelson v. Holdaway Land & Cattle Co., 691 P.2d 796, 799\n(Idaho Ct. App. 1984) (owner was entitled to recover\nnominal damages for trespass \u201ceven though no actual\ndamages were proven\u201d). Furthermore, a landowner has a\ngeneral right to exclude others from his lands by reasonable\nforce, under certain circumstances. Restatement (Second) of\nTorts \u00a7 77 (1965). Generally speaking, a landowner can use\nsuch reasonable force to defend \u201chis exclusive possession of\nland\u201d from others for any reason at all, even \u201cpersonal\ndislike or hostility to the other.\u201d See id. cmt. c; Rowe v. City\nof Pocatello, 218 P.2d 695, 700 (Idaho 1950) (\u201cA man\u2019s\nhouse is still his castle. He may exclude whom he chooses.\u201d).\n\n    In fact, no less an authority than the Supreme Court of\nIdaho has found an actionable trespass where the defendant\nused a misrepresentation to gain access to the plaintiff\u2019s\nproperty and the defendant merely crossed the property. In\nGreen v. Beaver State Contractors, Inc., the contractor went\nto plaintiff Lula M. Green and sought permission to enter\nand remove \u201clava rock\u201d from her land. 472 P.2d 307, 307\n(Idaho 1970). The contractor offered to pay $1 plus 5 cents\n\u201cper yard of rock removed\u201d from Green\u2019s land, and she\n\f48      ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\nagreed. Id. at 307\u201308. In reality, however, the contractor\nremoved rock only from land adjoining Green\u2019s land and\nwas merely using Green\u2019s land as a means of access to obtain\nthe rock from the third party, thus avoiding any obligation to\npay Green for \u201crock removed.\u201d Id. at 308. \u201cIn view of the\ncircumstances,\u201d namely the \u201cmisrepresentation . . . by [the\ncontractor],\u201d the Idaho Supreme Court found a common-law\ntrespass and remanded the case for a determination of\nGreen\u2019s damages. Id. at 310. Therefore, the Supreme Court\nof Idaho has recognized that employing misrepresentation to\ngain entry inflicts a legally cognizable harm, even if the\ninvader entered \u201cmerely . . . to cross the threshold of\nanother\u2019s property.\u201d\n\n    In the case of Jacque v. Steenberg Homes, Inc.,\n563 N.W.2d 154 (Wisc. 1997), the Supreme Court of\nWisconsin affirmed the value of the right to exclude even\nmore emphatically. It affirmed an eye-popping award of\npunitive damages for the precise sort of \u201cmere\u201d threshold-\ncrossing that the majority pooh-poohs here. In that case, the\ndefendant, Steenberg Homes, had sold a mobile home to a\nneighbor of the Jacques, who were retired farmers. It\ndetermined that \u201cthe easiest route\u201d to deliver the mobile\nhome would be to cut across the Jacques\u2019 land. Id. at 157.\nThe \u201conly alternative\u201d was to haul the mobile home through\na sharply-curved private road which was covered in seven\nfeet of snow at the time. Id. Understandably, Steenberg saw\na material advantage in \u201cmerely . . . cross[ing] the threshold\u201d\nof the Jacques\u2019 property. The Jacques refused permission to\nhaul the mobile home across their land, but Steenberg did so\nanyway. Id. at 157\u201358. The jury awarded nominal damages\nof $1 and punitive damages of $100,000, id. at 158, and the\nSupreme Court of Wisconsin, upheld the award in full. Id.\nat 166. Not only did the jury properly award nominal\ndamages because \u201c[t]he law infers some damage from every\n\f          ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN                        49\n\ndirect entry upon the land of another,\u201d id. at 160 (quoting\nProsser and Keeton on Torts, \u00a7 13 (5th ed. 1984)), the jury\nalso properly awarded punitive damages to vindicate the\nstrong interest of individual landowners and of society in\nprotecting private property from trespass, id.\n\n    The Idaho trespass statute cited in the majority opinion\nis not relevant. The majority cites Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7008(9)\nfor the proposition that only lands posted with \u201cNo\nTrespassing\u201d signs can be trespassed upon under Idaho law.\nBut while the cited statute so limits actions seeking criminal\npenalties for \u201cwillful and intentional[]\u201d trespass, it does not\notherwise override or eliminate common law trespass in\nIdaho. 10 Nor does Idaho Code \u00a7 6-202, which provides for\ntreble damages in civil actions for \u201cwillful and intentional[]\u201d\ntrespass and also requires posted \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs:\n\n         [T]he Idaho statutes governing trespass only\n         apply when the trespass is shown to have\n         been wilful and intentional, and the wronged\n         party seeks treble damages therefor, as\n         authorized by Section 6-202. In all other\n         circumstances, the common law principles\n         relating to trespass actions apply. The court is\n         unaware of any recent Idaho cases to the\n         contrary, and the 1976 amendments to the\n\n    10\n       \u201cThe common law of England, so far as it is not repugnant to, or\ninconsistent with, the constitution or laws of the United States, in all\ncases not provided for in these compiled laws, is the rule of decision in\nall courts of this state.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 73-116. \u201c[C]hanges in the\ncommon law by the adoption of a statute may not be presumed, nor may\nsuch changes be accomplished by legislation of doubtful implication.\nIndus.

WASDEN\n\n          statutes did nothing to alter this interpretation\n          ....\n\nMock v. Potlatch Corp., 786 F. Supp. 1545, 1548 (D. Idaho\n1992) (citing Menasha Woodenware Co. v. Spokane Int\u2019l.\nRy., 115 P. 22 (Idaho 1911)). 11 Thus, the \u201cimaginations\u201d and\n\u201caffections\u201d of Idahoans are not so different from those of\ngreater mankind. See Blackstone, supra. Unauthorized\nentry upon the land of another is common-law trespass in\nIdaho and thus a legally cognizable harm. 12\n\n    The majority also argues, based on two out-of-circuit\ncases, that not all misrepresentations necessarily vitiate\nconsent to entry. The majority cites Desnick v. Am. Broad.\nCos., Inc., 44 F.3d 1345 (7th Cir. 1995), and Food Lion, Inc.\nv. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., 194 F.3d 505, 517 (4th Cir.\n1999). Both Desnick and Food Lion note, in discussing the\ncommon law of various other jurisdictions, that there is no\n\n     11\n        In Menasha, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant went on its\nlands and cut and removed timber. 115 P. at 23. The trial court awarded\ntreble damages and the defendant appealed. Id. at 24. The Supreme\nCourt of Idaho reversed the award of statutory treble damages. Id. at 24\u2013\n25. The court read a willfulness requirement into the statute and reversed\nthe award because there was no allegation that the trespass was willful.\nId. at 24\u201325. In so doing, however, the court noted that the complaint\nwas \u201cgood as an action at common law, entitling the plaintiff to his actual\ndamage,\u201d but simply did not meet the statutory requirements for trebled\ndamages. Id. at 25. Rather, the court concluded that \u201cthe damages\nrecoverable at common law would afford an adequate reparation.\u201d Id.\nThe court therefore reduced the judgment to provide only actual damages\nand affirmed the judgment, so modified. Id.\n\n     12\n       Nowhere does Alvarez hold that a \u201clegally cognizable harm\u201d must\nalso be a crime. In fact, Alvarez points to classic common law injuries\u2014\n\u201cdefamation,\u201d \u201cfraud,\u201d and \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d\u2014as examples of\n\u201clegally cognizable harms.\u201d 567 U.S. at 719.\n\f        ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN               51\n\nconsensus on this issue. Food Lion, Inc., 194 F.3d at 517\n(\u201c[T]he various jurisdictions and authorities in this country\nare not of one mind in dealing with the issue.\u201d); Desnick, 44\nF.3d at 1352\u201353 (noting diversity of results in entry-by-\nmisrepresentation cases and proposing a new rule\u2014of\nundisclosed origin\u2014to reconcile them); see also\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 173 cmt. b (1965)\n(providing that \u201c[a] conscious misrepresentation as to the\npurpose for which admittance to the land is sought, may be\na fraudulent misrepresentation of a material fact\u201d which\nvitiates consent pursuant to Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\u00a7 892B). As relevant here, however, the law of Idaho is\ncontrary to the Desnick and Food Lion decisions. See\nBeaver State Contractors, Inc., 472 P.2d at 310 (finding\ntrespass where defendant entered and crossed the owner\u2019s\nproperty by misrepresentation). Even if entries such as those\nat issue in Desnick or Food Lion (or Beaver State) neither\ndamage the premises nor \u201cdisrupt\u201d the owner\u2019s activities\nthereon, wrongful entry is nonetheless a \u201clegally cognizable\nharm\u201d per se. Taysom, 349 P.2d at 560 (\u201cNominal damage\n. . . naturally flows from a wrongful entry.\u201d).\n\n    Furthermore, there is no suggestion in either Desnick or\nFood Lion that the First Amendment prohibits a state court\nor state legislature from establishing a different rule\neliminating consent to enter land when the consent is\nprocured by fraud. Cf. Illinois, ex rel. Madigan v.\nTelemarketing Assocs., Inc., 538 U.S. 600, 624 (2003)\n(\u201cConsistent with our precedent and the First Amendment,\nStates may maintain fraud actions when fundraisers make\nfalse or misleading representations designed to deceive\ndonors about how their donations will be used.\u201d); State v.\nJesser, 501 P.2d 727, 737 n.29 (Idaho 1972) (\u201cIt has long\nbeen settled that fraud vitiates the consent of the victim to\nthe taking of his property by agreement, and that,\n\f52       ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\nconsequently, the taking is a constructive trespass upon\npossession . . . .\u201d); Idaho Code \u00a7 18-2403 (prohibiting theft\nby deception, trick, or false pretenses). If the problem with\nsubsection (a) is that it enacts something different from the\nsubstantive law of trespass advocated by a Seventh Circuit\nor Fourth Circuit panel, any suggestion that those panels\nhave hit upon a \u201cbetter rule\u201d should be directed to the Idaho\nlegislature. It is Idaho law that governs what constitutes\nvalid consent for a license sufficient to avoid a trespass on\nIdaho land.\n\n    Subsection (a) is also limited to lies which are likely to\ncause a \u201cspecific harm,\u201d as Justice Breyer\u2019s Alvarez\nconcurrence would require. Justice Breyer distinguished the\nStolen Valor Act, which prohibited \u201cfalsity and nothing\nmore,\u201d from various other statutes which prohibit certain\nfalse or deceptive communications which cause or are likely\nto cause a \u201cspecific harm.\u201d Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 734\u201336\n(Breyer, J., concurring). For example, (1) fraud statutes\nrequire \u201cactual injury,\u201d (2) defamation statutes require a\nreputational harm, (3) intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress liability requires an \u201cemotional, dignitary, or\nprivacy-related\u201d harm, (4) statutes dealing with perjury or\nlying to government officials are \u201ctypically limited to\ncircumstances where a lie is likely to . . . interfer[e] with the\nfunctioning of a government department,\u201d (5) impersonation\nstatutes focus \u201cmay require\u201d a showing that someone was\ndeceived into following a course of action he would not have\npursued but for the deceitful conduct, and (6) trademark\ninfringement statutes are focused on infringement which\ncauses confusion among consumers about the source of a\nproduct, and thereby dilutes the value of a trademark.\nAlvarez, 567 U.S. at 734\u201336 (Breyer, J., concurring). The\n\u201cspecific harm\u201d requirement thus mandates that a\nprohibition on lies be limited to or \u201cfocused on\u201d lies which\n\f         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN                  53\n\nare \u201cmore likely\u201d to cause a discrete and identifiable type of\nharm. That is, a generalized prohibition on telling lies about\nconsumer products is overbroad, while a prohibition on lies\nwhich are likely to trick consumers into buying a product\nthey would not otherwise buy is not. Unlike the Stolen Valor\nAct, subsection (a) is limited to lies which are likely to cause\na specific harm: invasion of and onto land, or the harm to\nproperty owners\u2019 right to exclude others. In fact, in this\nanalysis, subsection (a) is even better than Justice Breyer\u2019s\ntrademark infringement and impersonation examples\nbecause the specific harm must occur for liability to attach,\nrather than just be \u201cmore likely\u201d to occur.\n\n    Conversely, when one obtains permission to enter onto\nthe land of another, he obtains a material gain: a license to\nenter. The resulting license is a legally cognizable interest\nor privilege. See Restatement (First) of Property \u00a7 512\n(1944) (\u201c[T]he word \u2018license\u2019 indicates the legal interest\narising from a consent.\u201d). It confers the ability to do lawfully\nthat which the law otherwise forbids and punishes as\ntrespass. Shultz v. Atkins, 554 P.2d 948, 953 (Idaho 1976)\n(\u201c[A]n essential element of a license . . . [is] the right to use\nland in the possession of another.\u201d). Take the example,\nsuggested by the Majority\u2019s opinion, of the teenager who lies\nto get a reservation at an exclusive restaurant. The majority\nadmits that the teenager gains something (entry to the\nrestaurant) but concludes, without explanation, 13 that \u201c[t]his\nentry alone does not constitute a material gain.\u201d No material\n\n\n\n    13\n        Because the majority does not explain how it reaches this\nconclusion, I assume it is my colleagues\u2019 own appraisal of the\nrestaurant\u2019s menu.\n\f54         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\ngain to the teenager? However one defines \u201cmaterial\u201d 14 and\n\u201cgain,\u201d 15 it seems a stretch to say the teenager stands to\nobtain neither at the restaurant. The majority must imagine\nthe lad served thin gruel indeed for him to have received\nnothing of \u201csubstance,\u201d leaving him with a sense of not\n\u201cgetting something\u201d as a result of hoodwinking the ma\u00eetre\nd\u2019h\u00f4tel.\n\n     Furthermore, if the teenager takes a seat in the restaurant\nwith permission procured by fraud, he commits trespass and\nis liable for at least nominal damages. But if he obtains\nconsent, he is able to gain lawful (albeit limited) use of\nanother\u2019s land\u2014a discrete, legally cognizable advantage 16\nthat he did not have before consent was given. If nothing\nelse, he gains a suspension of the owner\u2019s right to expel him\nfrom the restaurant by force. See Restatement (Second) of\nTorts \u00a7 77 (1965).\n\n    The majority\u2019s restaurant analogy merely evades the\ncrucial inquiries under Alvarez. First, \u201centry alone\u201d is a\n\n     14\n         Material: \u201c1. of matter; of substance . . . physical: a material object\n. . . 2. a. of the body or bodily needs, satisfactions . . . corporeal . . . .\u201d\nMATERIAL, Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary (5th ed. 2014).\n\n     15\n         Gain: \u201c1. An increase; addition . . . 2. the act of getting something\n. . . .\u201d GAIN, Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary (5th ed. 2014).\n     16\n        Furthermore, as an empirical matter, it is not self-evidently true\nthat interfering only with the right to exclude does not appropriate\nanything of material value.           See Jonathan Klick & Gideon\nParchomovsky, The Value of the Right to Exclude: An Empirical\nAssessment, 165 U. Pa. L. Rev. 917 (2017) (finding, based on an\nempirical analysis of the effect of legislation that recognized a \u201cright to\nroam\u201d in England and Wales on property values, that \u201ceven so-called\nslight intrusions on owners\u2019 exclusion right in favor of more public\naccess . . . come at a real cost to owners\u201d).\n\f        ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN                 55\n\nlegally cognizable harm under Idaho law; that is why under\nIdaho law aggrieved landowners, subjected to a trespass,\nneed not prove unjust enrichment or any other form of\ndamages. Taysom, 349 P.2d at 560. Legally cognizable\nharm\u2014not some unknown quantum of physical damage or\neconomic harm to be determined by courts ex post, on a case-\nby-case basis\u2014is what Alvarez requires. Alvarez, 567 U.S.\nat 719 (plurality opinion). Second, although \u201centry alone\u201d\nmay seem insignificant to the majority, it was apparently\nsignificant to the Beaver State contractor who took the\nshortcut across Ms. Green\u2019s land. See supra at 47\u201348. And\nin the majority\u2019s hypothetical, it is apparently significant to\nrestauranteurs who offer their in-demand tables to \u201cwell-\nknown journalists\u201d but not to journalists\u2019 teenage sons.\nIndeed, the teenager does cause economic harm in the\nmajority\u2019s hypothetical: When he secures one of a limited\nnumber of reservations, he takes a valuable table off of the\nmarket and puts it to a perhaps economically sub-optimal use\n(his own). That is, unless his journalist mother has been\nsplendid as to an allowance. Third, the majority\u2019s\nhypothetical does not present a case of entry \u201cby\nmisrepresentation.\u201d The ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel must recognize that\nthe teenager is not his famous journalist mother when the\nteenager arrives at the restaurant; if he seats the teenager\nanyway, then the restaurant consents to the entry and the\nteenager does not violate the Idaho statute. Finally, the\nmajority concludes that the teenager\u2019s lie is \u201cpure speech.\u201d\n\u201cNothing but speech,\u201d yes; but a lie is seldom \u201cpure.\u201d\nNonetheless, the Idaho statute criminalizes entries, not lies.\nSee supra, at 43.\n\n    The majority seems to be concerned\u2014understandably\u2014\nthat the Idaho law\u2019s punishments for such trespasses are\nDraconian or unwise (\u201cthe teenager would be subject to\npunishment of up to one year in prison, a fine not to exceed\n\f56       ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND V. WASDEN\n\n$5,000, or both.\u201d). But that concern has nothing to do with\nwhether entry-by-misrepresentation inflicts a legally\ncognizable harm or provides a material gain\u2014which is to\nsay that it has nothing to do with the Alvarez analysis. That\nthe Idaho statute may take a heavy-handed approach to\npunishing certain trespasses is a policy argument against the\nIdaho statute, and that argument should be addressed to\nIdaho\u2019s legislators and voters.\n\n    The misconception of the ancient right at stake\u2014the\nright of an owner of real property to exclude all others from\nhis property\u2014is where the majority goes wrong, as our\nholding as to subsection (b) demonstrates. Applying Alvarez\nto subsection (b), the majority finds that \u201c[o]btaining an\nagricultural     production      facility\u2019s    records      by\nmisrepresentation inflicts a \u2018legally cognizable harm\u2019 by\nimpairing an agricultural production facility owner\u2019s ability\nto control who can assert dominion over, and take possession\nof, his property.\u201d Quite right. The farmer\u2019s records are his\nproperty. So is his land his property. Subsection (a) is\nconstitutional for precisely the same reason: Entering an\nagricultural production facility by misrepresentation inflicts\na \u201clegally cognizable harm\u201d by \u201cimpairing an agricultural\nproduction facility owner\u2019s ability to control who can assert\ndominion over . . . his [real] property.\u201d There is no\nmeaningful legal distinction between the two subsections\nunder Alvarez, and neither is unconstitutional.\n\n     I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

            "opinion_text": " Partial Concurrence and Partial Dissent by Judge Bea OPINION McKEOWN, Circuit Judge: Investigative journalism has long been a fixture in the American press, particularly with regard to food safety.1 In the early 1900s, Upton Sinclair highlighted conditions in the meat-packing industry in The Jungle, a novel based on his time working incognito in a packing plant.2 This case also originates in the agricultural sector\u2014 a secretly-filmed expos\u00e9 of the operation of an Idaho dairy farm. By all accounts, the video was disturbing: dairy\" workers were shown dragging a cow across the ground by a chain attached to her neck; twisting cows\u2019 tails to inflict excruciating pain; and repeatedly beating, kicking, and jumping on cows to force them to move.3  After the film went live on the Internet, both the court of public opinion and the Idaho legislature responded, with the latter eventually enacting the Interference with Agricultural Production law. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042. That legislation\u2014targeted at undercover investigation of agricultural operations\u2014broadly criminalizes making misrepresentations to access an agricultural production facility as well as making audio and video recordings of the facility without the owner\u2019s consent. Statutes of this genre\u2014dubbed by some as Ag-Gag laws\u2014have been passed in several western states.4  This appeal highlights the tension between journalists\u2019 claimed First Amendment right to engage in undercover investigations and the state\u2019s effort to protect privacy and property rights in the agricultural industry. Idaho challenges the district court\u2019s determination that four subsections of the statute\u2014\u00a7 18\u20147042(l)(a)\u2014 (d)\u2014are unconstitutional on First Amendment and Equal Protection grounds. The Animal League Defense Fund and various other animal rights organizations (collectively \u201cALDF\u201d) urge us to uphold the district court\u2019s injunction against enforcement of the statute, arguing that the law criminalizes whistleblower activity and undercover investigative reporting\u2014a form of speech that has brought about important and widespread change to the food industry, an arena at the forefront of public interest. Our analysis is framed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Alvarez, which addressed the First Amendment and false speech. 567 U.S. 709, 132 S.Ct. 2537, 183 L.Ed.2d 574 (2012). We conclude that Idaho\u2019s criminalization of misrepresentations to enter a production facility, \u00a7 18\u20147042(l)(a), and ban on audio and video recordings of a production facility\u2019s operations, \u00a7 18-7042(l)(d), cover protected speech under the First Amendment and cannot survive constitutional scrutiny. In contrast, in accord with Alvarez, Idaho\u2019s criminalization of misrepresentations to obtain records and secure employment are not protected speech under the First Amendment and do not violate the Equal Protection Clause. \u00a7 18-7042(l)(b)-(c). Thus, we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of ALDF and vacate in part its permanent injunction against enforcement of the statute. We are sensitive to journalists\u2019 constitutional right to investigate and publish ex-pos\u00e9s on the agricultural industry. Matters related to food safety and animal cruelty are of significant public importance. However, the First Amendment right to gather news within legal bounds does not exempt journalists from laws of general applicability. For this reason, we uphold the provisions that fall within constitutional parameters, but strike down those limitations that impinge on protected speech. Background The Investigation In 2012, an animal rights activist went undercover to get a job at an Idaho dairy farm and then secretly filmed ongoing animal abuse there. Mercy for Animals, an animal rights group, publicly released portions of the video, drawing national attention. The dairy farm owner responded to the video by firing the abusive employees who were caught on camera, instituting operational protocols, and conducting an animal welfare audit at the farm. Local law enforcement authorities launched an investigation that culminated in the conviction of one of the employees for animal cruelty. After the video\u2019s release, the dairy farm owner and his family received multiple threats. Idaho\u2019s Interference with Agricultural Production Statute In February 2014, Idaho enacted a law criminalizing \u201cinterference with agricultural production\u201d to protect Idaho farmers. See Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042. Relevant here, a person commits the crime of interference with agricultural production if the person knowingly: (a) Is not employed by an agricultural production facility and enters an agricultural facility by force, threat, misrepresentation or trespass; (b) Obtains records of an agricultural production facility by force, threat, misrepresentation or trespass; (c) Obtains employment with an agricultural facility by force, threat, or misrepresentation with the intent to cause economic or other injury to the facility\u2019s operations, livestock, crops, owners, personnel, equipment, buildings, premises, business interests or customers; [or] (d) Enters an agricultural production facility that is not open to the-public and, without the facility owner\u2019s express consent or pursuant to judicial process or statutory authorization, makes audio or video recordings of the conduct of an agricultural production facility\u2019s operations[.]5  Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(l)(a)-(d). For purposes of this statute, the term \u201cagricultural production\u201d broadly covers \u201cactivities associated with the production of agricultural products for food, fiber, fuel and other lawful uses,\u201d and other activities such as \u201c[preparing land for agricultural production\u201d and \u201c[h]andling or applying pesticides ... .\u201d6 Id. \u00a7 18-7042(2)(a). The term \u201cagricultural production facility\u201d is broad and covers \u201cany structure or land, whether privately or publicly owned, leased or operated, that is being used for agricultural production.\u201d Id. \u00a7 18-7042(2)(b). Interference with agricultural production is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison or a fine not in excess of $5,000, or both. Id. \u00a7 18-7042(3). A person convicted of this crime must pay restitution to the victim in an amount of twice the damage resulting from violation of the statute. Id. \u00a7 18-7042(4). This damages payment includes a victim\u2019s \u201ceconomic loss[es].\u201d Id. \u00a7 19-5304. The legislative history reveals a complex series of motivations behind the statute. The bill was drafted by the Idaho Dairymen\u2019s Association, a trade organization representing Idaho\u2019s dairy industry. When the Association\u2019s lawyer addressed legislators, he stated that one goal of the bill was \u201cto protect Idaho farmers from wrongful interference.... Idaho farmers live and work spread out across the land where they\u2019re uniquely vulnerable to interference by wrongful conduct.\u201d Another goal was to shield the agricultural industry from undercover investigators who expose the industry to the \u201ccourt of public opinion,\u201d which destroys farmers\u2019 reputations, results in death threats, and causes loss of customers. At the time of the passage of this legislation, Idaho already had a law relating to interference with agricultural research\u2014 which has not been challenged\u2014prohibiting knowingly damaging or obtaining property at an agricultural research facility with intent to hinder agricultural research; obtaining access to an agricultural research facility by misrepresentation with the intent to perform acts that would hinder agricultural research; entering an agricultural research facility with-the intent to damage, alter, duplicate or obtain unauthorized possession of records or property related to the agricultural research; obtaining control over records or property of an agricultural research facility with intent to destroy such property without authorization of the facility; and releasing, stealing, or causing death or injury to an animal at an agricultural research facility. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7040(1). The Idaho Dairymen\u2019s Association used this interference with agricultural research law as the framework for \u00a7 18-7041. Legislators discussed the bill as protecting against two types of perceived harm to agricultural producers. First, lawmakers expressed concern about physical and operational damage caused by animal rights activists who gain access to agricultural production facilities. For example,' some legislators discussed concerns about farm security and privacy. Others voiced concerns about the intentional destruction of crops, breeding records, and farm structures. Lawmakers also discussed damage caused by investigative reporting: \u201cOne of the things that bothers me a lot about the undercover investigation [at the dairy], and the fact that there\u2019s videos, well, we\u2019re being tried and persecuted and prosecuted in the press.\u201d Other legislators- used similar language demonstrating hostility toward the release of these videos, and one supporter of the legislation dubbed animal rights groups as \u201cterrorists\u201d who \u201cuse media and sensationalism to attempt to steal the integrity of the producer and their reputation.\u201d One legislator stated that the dairy industry\u2019s reason behind the legislation was \u201c[t]hey could not allow fellow members of the industry to be persecuted in the court of -public opinion.\u201d Another described these videos as used to \u201cpublicly crucify a company\u201d -and \u201cas a blackmail tool.\u201d Finally, one legislator indicated that if the video 'had not been published, she did -not \u201cthink this bill would ever have surfaced.\u201d Procedural Background In March 2014, ALDF filed suit against Lawrence G. Wasden as Attorney General of Idaho.7 The complaint alleges that the purpose and effect of the statute \u201care to stifle political debate about modern agriculture by (1) criminalizing all employment-based undercover' investigations; and (2) criminalizing investigative journalism, whistleblowing by employees, or other expository efforts that entail images or sounds.\u201d ALDF asserts violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Although ALDF claimed preemption under the False Claims Act, Food Safety Modernization Act, and Clean Water Act, ALDF did not address those issues on appeal. The district court granted ALDF\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its First Amendment and Equal Protection claims. The district court concluded that the prohibitions on misrepresentations in \u00a7 18-7042(l)(a)-(c) (the \u201cMisrepresentation Clauses\u201d) criminalize speech protected by the First Amendment because Idaho could not \u201cshow the lies it seeks to prohibit cause any legally cognizable harm.\u201d The court explained that the regulation on audio and video recordings under \u00a7 18-7042(l)(d) (the \u201cRecordings Clause\u201d) covers speech protected by the First Amendment and discriminates based on content because it criminalizes only \u201crecordings of the conduct of an agricultural production facility\u2019s operations.\u201d Th\u00e9 district court further reasoned that subsections (c) (misrepresentation to gain employment) and (d) (the Recordings Clause) discriminate on the basis of viewpoint because they \u201cburden speech critical of the animal-agriculture industry.\u201d Applying strict scrutiny to all challenged provisions, the district court resolved that even if the state\u2019s interests in privacy and property were compelling, the restrictions were neither narrowly tailored nor the least restrictive means available to protect those interests. The district court also determined that all four challenged subsections violate the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause and fail rational basis review. The subsections fail on their, face because they classify between whistleblowers in the agricultural industry and whistleblowers in other .industries. The subsections also fail through their purpose because they were \u201canimated by an improper animus toward animal welfare groups and other undercover investigators in the agricultural industry\u201d and \u201cfurther[ ] no other legitimate or rational purpose.\u201d The court noted that there was \u201cabundant evidence that the law was enacted with the discriminatory purpose of silencing animal rights activists who conduct undercover investigations in the agricultural industry.\u201d The district court deemed moot ALDF\u2019s remaining claims and permanently enjoined enforcement of the challenged subsections. Idaho appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, which we review de novo. Roberts v. Continental Ins. Co., 770 F.2d 853, 855 (9th Cir. 1985). Analysis I. The Misrepresentation Clauses: Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(l)(a)-(c) Subsections (a), (b) and (c) criminalize misrepresentations used to gain entry to agricultural production facilities, obtain records, and, under certain circumstances, secure employment. Relevant here, a person commits the crime of interference with agricultural production if the person knowingly: , ' . (a) Is not employed by an agricultural production facility and enters an agricultural facility by force, threat, misrepresentation or trespass; . (b) Obtains records of an agricultural production facility by force, threat, misrepresentation or trespass; [or] (c) Obtains employment with an agricultural facility by force, threat, or misrepresentation with the intent to cause economic or other injury to the facility\u2019s operations, livestock, crops, owners, personnel, equipment, buildings, premises, business interests or customers[.] Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(l)(a)-(c) (emphasis added). Idaho argues that the \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d component of these provisions regulates conduct induced by false statements of fact. ALDF counters that the subsections regulate pure speech, effectively prohibiting investigative reporters from accessing agricultural production facilities and therefore blocking reporters\u2019 access to material for journalistic expos\u00e9s. The First Amendment, applied to states through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits laws \u201cabridging, the freedom of speech.\u201d U.S. Const., amend I.. Our first task is to determine whether the misrepresentations prohibited in the Idaho statute constitute speech protected by the First Amendment. See Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. Fund &amp; Educ. Fund Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 797, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985). If the government\u2019s actions do not implicate speech protected by the First Amendment, we \u201cneed go no further.\u201d Id. In Alvarez, the Supreme Court examined the Stolen Valor Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 704 (\u201cthe Act\u201d), a statute criminalizing false claims that the speaker had received the Congressional Medal of Honor. 567 U.S. 709, 132 S.Ct. 2537, 183 L.Ed.2d 574 (2012). Justice Kennedy\u2019s plurality opinion (joined by the Chief Justice and Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor), as well as Justice Breyer\u2019s concurring opinion (joined by Justice Kagan), concluded that the Act\u2019s flat prohibition of such lies constituted an impermissible restriction on speech protected by the First Amendment. Id. at 729-30, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (plurality opinion); id. at 739, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (Breyer, J., concurring). In deciding that lying about receiving the Medal of Honor, without more, is protected speech, the plurality and concurrence \u201crejected] the notion that false speech should be in a general category that .is presumptively unprotected.\u201d Id. at 722, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (plurality opinion); accord id. at 731-32, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (Breyer, J., concurring).  However, neither the plurality nor the concurrence in Alvarez held that false statements are ahvays protected under the First Amendment. Instead, as the plurality outlines, false speech may be criminalized if made \u201cfor the purpose of material gain\u201d or \u201cmaterial advantage,\u201d or if such speech inflicts a \u201clegally cognizable harm.\u201d Id. at 723, 719, 132 S.Ct. 2537. The concurring justices agreed: statutes that criminalize falsities typically require proof of specific or tangible harm. Id. at 734-36, 132 S.Ct. 2537. We thus focus our attention on misrepresentations of the type singled out by the Court\u2014false statements made for material gain or advantage or that inflict harm. A. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(1)(a); Entry by Misrepresentation Subsection (a) criminalizes entry into an agricultural production facility \u201cby force, threat, misrepresentation or trespass.\u201d Notably, ALDF challenges only the \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d prong of this subsection.8 And, as we note below, Idaho can easily address the problematic term by simply excising \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d from this subsection. Thus, entry by force, threat or trespass would continue to be a criminal violation.  Guided by Alvarez, we conclude that subsection (a)\u2019s misrepresentation provision regulates speech protected by the First Amendment. The targeted speech\u2014a false statement made in order to access an agricultural production facility\u2014cannot on its face be characterized as \u201cmade to effect a fraud or secure moneys or other valuable considerations.\u201d Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 723, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (plurality opinion). Nor can the misrepresentation provision be characterized as simply proscribing conduct. Like the statute in Alvarez, subsection (a) \u201cseeks to control and suppress all false statements [related to access] in almost limitless times and settings. And it does so entirely without regard to whether the lie was made for the purpose of material gain.\u201d Id. at 722-23, 132 S-Ct. 2537 (plurality opinion). Unlike lying to obtain records or gain employment\u2014which are associated with a material benefit to the speaker\u2014lying to gain entry merely allows the speaker to cross the threshold of another\u2019s property, including property that is generally open to the public. The hazard of this subsection is that it criminalizes innocent behavior, that the overbreadth of this subsection\u2019s coverage is staggering, and that the purpose of the statute was, in large part, targeted at speech and investigative journalists. Idaho\u2019s argument that \u201cthe material gain to the person telling the lie is the entry to the property,\u201d is not supported by any authority and does not establish how entry onto the property and material gain are coextensive. Under the statute, any misrepresentation to gain entry could net a criminal prosecution. Take, for example, a teenager who wants to impress his friends by obtaining a highly sought after reservation at an exclusive pop-up restaurant that is open to the public. If he were to call the restaurant and finagle a reservation in the name of his mother, a well-known journalist, that would be a misrepresentation. If the restaurant offers up a reservation on the basis of the mother\u2019s notoriety, granting a \u201clicense\u201d to enter the premises and sit at a table, the teenager would be subject to punishment of up to one year in prison, a fine not to exceed $5,000, or both. The teenager risks this potential despite the fact that he might leave before ordering, be discovered and removed by the manager, or his friends might not be impressed at all. In those instances, he would not receive even the secondary benefits of having gained access. In fact, all our teenager would have to do is enter the restaurant and he could be arrested because he gave a false name to the maitre d\u2019 on the phone. This entry alone does not constitute a material gain, and without more, the lie is pure speech.9  Or the lunch could go off without a hitch. The restaurant is none the wiser, it gets paid for the meal, and loses nothing, but the teenager could still be subject to prosecution. Once again, the lie is pure speech. The teenager does not necessarily even gain protection from trespass liability. Idaho\u2019s criminal trespass law prohibits \u201c[e]n-tering without permission of the owner or the owner\u2019s agent, upon the real property of another\u201d but limits its application to property posted with \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs that meet certain parameters. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7008(9), Thus, even if the dissent is correct that the teenager receives a license that would not otherwise have been granted, since in some circumstances the teenager may have entered the restaurant with no permission without trespassing, he gains little to nothing from his misrepresentation.10  Two earlier cases involving investigative reporters and trespass \u25a0 in the First Amendment context foreshadowed the decision in Alvarez, albeit in slightly different scenarios. The Fourth Circuit in Food Lion, Inc. v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., 194 F.3d 505 (1999), and the Seventh Circuit in Desnick v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., 44 F.3d 1345 (1995), examined whether plaintiffs in a civil action' could maintain a trespass claim against journalists for misrepresenting their identities. Both courts invalidated the trespass claim predicated on the misrepresentations because \u201cthe entry was not invasive in the sense of infringing the kind of interest of the plaintiffs, that the law of trespass protects; it was not an interference with the ownership or possession of land.\u201d Desnick, 44 F.3d at 1353; Food Lion, 194 F.3d at 618 (\u201c[I]f we turned successful resume fraud into trespass, we would not be protecting the interest underlying the tort of trespass\u2014the ownership and peaceable possession of land.\u201d).11 Put differently, \u201cconsent to an entry is often given legal effect\u2019even though th\u00e9 entrant has intentions that if known to the owner of the property would cause him for ... lawful reasons to revoke his consent\u201d because \u2022that entry does not infringe upon the specific interests trespass seeks to protect.' Desnick, 44 F.3d at 1351. This language is prescient in its tracking of Alvarez\u2019s reasoning: some lies quite simply do not inflict any material or legal harm on the deceived party. See Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 718-19, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (plurality opinion); see also id. at 736, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (Breyer, J., concurring) (statutes properly prohibiting false statements are those with \u201climitations of context, or requirements of proof of injury\u201d to narrow the prohibition to \u201ca subset of lies where specific harm is more likely to occur\u201d and not \u201cwhere harm is unlikely or the need for the prohibition is small.\u201d).  Re-visiting our teenager, we have already established that he is not guilty of ordinary criminal trespass in the absence of a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign. However, as with a journalist or even a curiosity seeker who dissembles to get access to the property, under the challenged Idaho law, the teenager would be subject to criminal prosecution for nothing more than what can only be characterized as a fib. Thus, the misrepresentation provision of subsection (a)' regulates protected speech while \u201ctargeting] falsity and nothing more?\u2019 Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 719, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (plurality opinion). Such regulation is subject to the \u201cmost exacting scrutiny?\u2019 Id. at 724, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (quoting Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 642, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994)). Idaho\u2019s chosen restriction on speech must be \u201cactually necessary\u201d to achieve a compelling government interest, and there must be a \u201cdirect causal link between the restriction imposed and the injury to be pre--vented.\u201d Id. at 725, 132 S.Ct. 2537. Subsection (a) cannot survive this high bar. Even assuming Idaho has a compelling interest in regulating property rights and protecting its farm industry, criminalizing access to property by misrepresentation is not \u201cactually necessary\u201d to protect those rights. If, as Idaho argues, its real concern is trespass, then Idaho already has a prohibition against trespass that does not implicate speech in any way. If instead, as a number of the legislators made clear and the dairy lobby underscored, the statute was intended to quash investigative reporting on agricultural production facilities, then the speech aspect of the statute prohibiting misrepresentations is even more problematic. The focus of the statute to avoid the \u201ccourt of public opinion\u201d and treatment of investigative videos as \u201cblackmail\u201d cannot be squared with a content-neutral trespass law. It is troubling that criminalization of these misrepresentations opens the door to selective prosecutions\u2014for example, pursuing the case of a journalist who produces a 60 Minutes segment about animal cruelty versus letting the misrepresentation go unchecked in the case of the teenager. As Justice Breyer aptly noted in his concurrence, the pervasiveness of false statements, made for better or for worse motives, made thoughtlessly or deliberately, made with or without accompanying harm, provides a weapon to a government broadly empowered to prosecute falsity without more. And those who are unpopular may fear that the government will use that weapon selectively, say, by prosecuting a [politically unpopular individual who makes false claims], while ignoring members of other political groups who might make similar false claims. Id. at 734,132 S.Ct. 2537. In this case, the targeted group\u2014journalists and investigative reporters\u2014could also face enhanced penalties. Violating Idaho\u2019s criminal trespass statute could result in up to six months in prison, a fine not in excess of $1,000, or both, see Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7011(1), whereas the penalty under the agricultural protection provision, \u00a7 18-7042, could be up to one year in prison, a f\u00edne not in excess of $5,000, or both. We are also unsettled by the sheer breadth of this subsection given the definitions of \u201cagricultural production facility\u201d and \u201cagricultural production.\u201d Id. \u00a7 18-7042(2)(a), (b). Applying these definitions, the subsection reaches misrepresentations not only in the context of a large-scale dairy facility or cattle feedlot, but also grocery stores, garden nurseries, restaurants that have an herb garden or grow their own produce, llama farms that produce wool for weaving, beekeepers, a chicken coop in the backyard, a field producing crops for ethanol,' and hardware stores, to' name a few. See Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 722, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (plurality opinion) (criticizing the Act for having \u201csweeping, quite unprecedented reach\u201d). The subsection\u2019s reach is particularly worrisome because many of the covered entities are, unlike large-scale dairy facilities, places of business that \u00e1re open to the public, Imagine a situation in which an Albertsons grocery store opens early to the first one hundred affinity cardholders to visit the new, spectacular food court. Given the expansive definition of \u201cagricultural production,\u201d the Albertsons store would be covered under the statute as a facility -where, agricultural products are \u201cprocess[ed] and package[ed] ... into food.\u201d An enterprising person with no Al-bertsons card, but representing , otherwise, or, even someone using a friend\u2019s Albert-sons card, falls prey to the statute simply because he wants to see the food-court extravaganza. Under subsection (a), our protagonist would be guilty of a misdemeanor and could be punished by up to one year in prison, a fine not in excess of $5,000, or both\u2014not to.mention a potential restitution award. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(3), (4). The same can be said for a restaurant critic who goes undercover, claiming to be a repeat customer in order to get a prime table from which to review the restaurant\u2019s food, service, and ambiance. In these scenarios, the statute punishes speech where there is no fraud, no gain, and no valuable consideration. The limitation that a misrepresentation must be \u201cknowing[]\u201d does not eliminate the threat posed by- this subsection\u2019s staggering reach. The fact that the subsection regulates speech related to property far beyond a classic agricultural facility would invariably result in the chilling of lawful speech. Indeed, \u201ca speaker might still be worried about being prosecuted for a careless false statement, even if he does not have the intent required to render him liable.\u201d Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 736, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (Breyer, J., concurring) (applying intermediate scrutiny). Nor is this subsection the \u201cleast restrictive means among available, effective alternatives.\u201d Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S. 656, 666, 124 S.Ct. 2783, 159 L.Ed.2d 690 (2004). We see no reason, and Idaho has not offered any, why the state could not narrow the subsection by requiring specific intent or by limiting criminal liability to statements that cause a particular harm. Idaho did exactly that with subsection (c), which covers misrepresentation \u201cwith the intent to cause economic or other injury.\u201d It is no surprise that after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Alvarez, Congress amended the Stolen Valor Act to criminalize only those \u201c[wjhoever, with intent to obtain money, property, or other tangible benefit, fraudulently hold[ ] oneself out to be a recipient\u201d of a qualifying medal. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 704(b) (2013) (emphasis added). Such a limitation would still effectuate agricultural production facility owners\u2019 property rights while complying with Alvarez\u2019 s relatively straightforward First Amendment requirements. The reach of subsection (a) is so broad that it gives rise to suspicion that it may have been enacted with an impermissible purpose. See Elena Kagan, Private Speech, Public Purpose: The Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment Doctrine, 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 413, 455 (1996) (\u201cAt a certain point\u2014when the asserted interest is insubstantial or when it does not fit the scope of the challenged regulation\u2014the usual presumption of proper purpose topples; there is reason, then, to think that the law, though content neutral, has been tainted by impermissible purpose.\u201d). Our suspicion is not eased after reading the legislative history. The record reflects that the statute was partly motivated to protect members of the agricultural industry from \u201cpersecution] in the court of public opinion,\u201d and journalists who use expos\u00e9s to \u201cpublicly crucify a company.\u201d Although, for Equal Protection Clause purposes, we need not decide whether animus motivated this subsection, we do not ignore that a vocal number of supporters were less concerned with the protection of property than they were about protecting a target group from critical speech, which adds to our skepticism that the provision survives the \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d required under Alvarez. See FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U.S. 364, 387 n.18, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984) (expressing skepticism about the motivation behind a bill when some supporters were concerned with protecting themselves from critical speech).  In the same vein, if intermediate scrutiny is the standard, as Justice Breyer advocates in Alvarez, then this subsection would still fail. Subsection (a) criminalizes speech that inflicts no \u201cspecific harm\u201d on property owners, \u201cranges very broadly,\u201d and risks significantly chilling speech that is not covered under the statute. Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 736-37, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (Breyer J., concurring). Additionally, it is \u201cpossible substantially to achieve the Government\u2019s objective in less burdensome ways\u201d with \u201ca more finely tailored statute.\u201d Id. at 737, 132 S.Ct. 2537. Even under intermediate scrutiny, the subsection \u201cworks disproportionate constitutional harm.\u201d Id. at 739, 132 S.Ct. 2537.  There is, of course, an easy fix to this First Amendment problem: simply strike the word \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d from the subsections. Idaho explicitly invites this result in its discussion of the statute\u2019s severability clause, and ALDF\u2019s surgical challenge indirectly endorses this remedy. Under Idaho law, an invalid portion of a statute may be severed where \u201cpart of a statute ... is unconstitutional and yet is not an integral or indispensable part of the measure.\u201d Voyles v. City of Nampa, 97 Idaho 597, 548 P.2d 1217, 1220 (1976). Because the proscription on misrepresentations is neither integral nor indispensable to the subsection\u2019s goal of protecting property rights, the offending term \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d should be stricken, leaving the remainder of the subsection intact. In light of this resolution, we need not analyze subsection (a) under the Equal Protection Clause. B. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(l)(b): Obtaining Records by Misrepresentation  Subsection (b)\u2014which criminalizes obtaining records of an agricultural production facility by misrepresentation12 \u2014protects against a \u201clegally cognizable harm associated with a false statement\u201d and therefore survives constitutional scrutiny under Alvarez. 567 U.S. at 719, 132 S.Ct. 2537. Alvarez highlights that a false statement made in association with a legally cognizable harm or for the purpose of material gain is not protected. Id. at 719, 723, 132 S.Ct. 2537. Unlike false statements made to enter property, false statements made to actually acquire agricultural production facility records inflict a property harm upon the owner, and may also bestow a material gain on the acquirer. This subsection is aimed at conduct\u2014 obtaining records\u2014that has long been prohibited in Idaho. For decades, Idaho has lawfully proscribed similar types of conduct that infringe on property rights. For example, Idaho criminalizes conversion, which involves \u201cany distinct act of dominion wrongfully exerted over another\u2019s personal property in' denial or inconsistent with his rights therein.\u201d Wiseman v. Schaffer, 115 Idaho 537, 768 P.2d 800, 803 (1989) (citation omitted); see also Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 18-2403(3), 18-7001(1). Idaho also criminalizes theft by false pretenses, which involves \u201ca wrongful taking, obtaining or withholding of another\u2019s property\u201d by conduct constituting \u201cobtaining property, money or labor under false pretenses.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 18-2403(2); State v. Larsen, 76 Idaho 528, 286 P.2d 646, 648 (Idaho 1955) (citation omitted) (\u201c[a] false pretense may consist in any act, word, symbol, or token calculated and intended to deceive\u201d). Larceny, which involves the \u201cfraudulent obtaining of personal property, and carrying that property away with the intent permanently to deprive the owner thereof,\u201d is also prohibited. State v. Jesser, 95 Idaho 43, 501 P.2d 727, 736 &amp; n.29 (1972). Criminalizing the obtaining of records by misrepresentation is one of a variety of Idaho statutes that protect property rights. Obtaining an agricultural production facility\u2019s records by misrepresentation inflicts a \u201clegally cognizable harm\u201d by impairing an agricultural production facility owner\u2019s ability to control who can assert dominion over, and take possession of, his property. Additionally, obtaining records through misrepresentation may also infringe on other rights by, for example, exposing proprietary formulas, trade secrets, or other confidential business information to unwanted parties. See Idaho Code \u00a7 48-801 et seq. (prohibiting misappropriation of trade secrets). The legislative history illustrates how such conduct has harmed, and threatens to harm, agricultural production facility owners. For- example, legislators' expressed general concern about damage to breeding papers, and one legislator noted an instance in.which the breeding papers of a mink ranch were \u201ctossed\u201d into a \u201cpile,\u201d \u201cdamag[ing] the whole operation.\u201d The agricultural industry also expressed concern about the theft of facility records, particularly when .such theft leads to the release of a facility\u2019s proprietary and confidential information, including divulging locations of genetically engineered crops or valuable research -documents for sale to competitors. -Although some legislators wanted to silence, investigative journalists reporting on the agricultural industry, the full legislative history shows that a legitimate purpose for enacting the subsection was to prevent harm from damaged or stolen records. Obtaining records may also bestow a \u201cmaterial gain\u201d on the speaker. See Alvares, 567 U.S. at 723, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (plurality .opinion). The records may contain confidential information, such as breeding histories of animals and livestock, and other proprietary research and development information valuable to those in the industry. Once disclosed, this information may lose its confidential or proprietary research status. Acquiring records by misrepresentation results in something definitively more than does entry onto land\u2014it wreaks actual and potential harm on a facility and bestows material gain on the fibber. So unlike subsection (a), subsection (b) does not regulate constitutionally protected speech, and does not run afoul of the First Amendment.13 '  Nor does subsection (b) violate the Equal Protection Clause. The district'court determined that the statute was \u201canimated by an improper animus toward animal welfare groups and other undercover investigators in the agricultural industry\u201d and could not survive rational basis review. We agree that animus was one of the motivating factors but disagree as to the conclusion.  Legislation is generally presumed to be valid and will be sustained under the Equal Protection Clause \u201cif the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\u201d City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985). However, neither \u201ca bare ... desire to harm a politically unpopular group\u201d nor \u201cnegative attitude[s]\u201d or \u201cfears\u201d about that group constitute a legitimate government interest for the purpose of this review. Id. at 448,105 S.Ct. 3249. When a law exhibits a desire to .harm an unpopular group, courts will often apply a \u201cmore searching\u201d application, of rational basis review. Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 580, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring); see also Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448-50, 105 S.Ct. 3249; U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 535-38, 93 S.Ct. 2821, 37 L.Ed.2d 782 (1973), When the politically unpopular group is not a traditionally suspect class, a court may strike down the challenged statute under the Equal Protection Clause \u201cif the statute serves- no legitimate governmental purpose and if impermissible animus toward an unpopular group prompted the statute\u2019s enactment.\u201d Mountain Water Co. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Serv. Regulation, 919 F.2d 593, 598 (9th Cir. 1990) (emphasis added); Moreno, 413 U.S. at 534, 93 S.Ct. 2821.  We invoke searching scrutiny here; Although animus towards particular speech by reporters and activists was one factor driving Idaho\u2019s decision to pass the statute, to strike down the law, we must also determine whether the law serves \u201cno legitimate governmental purpose.\u201d Mountain Water Co., 919 F.2d at 598. The overall purpose of \u00a7 18-7042 is to protect agricultural production facilities from interference by wrongful conduct. As noted, the legislative history relevant to subsection (b) describes situations in which agricultural production facilities have been, or may be, harmed as a result of a misrepresentation leading to the acquisition of records. Idaho\u2019s desire to protect against harm relating to an agricultural' production facility\u2019s most sensitive information\u2014affecting both property rights and privacy interests\u2014is a legitimate government interest. It also bears noting that the penalty provisions for falsely obtaining records under this statute are in line with the penalties in Idaho\u2019s other statutes relating to records and property offenses. See, e.g., Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 18-2403(2)(d), \u2022 18-2407, 18-2408 (theft by false promise); 18-7001 (malicious injury to property); 48-803 (misappropriation of trade secrets). Subsection (b) does not offend the Equal Protection Clause because it does not rest exclusively on an \u201cirrational prejudice\u201d against journalists and activists. Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 450, 105 S.Ct. 3249. C. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(l)(c): Obtaining Employment by Misrepresentation  Subsection (c) criminalizes knowingly \u201c[o]btain[ing] employment with an agricultural production facility by ... misrepresentation with the intent to cause economic or other injury\u201d to the facility\u2019s operations, property, or personnel. Almost as though the Idaho legislature drafted this provision with Alvarez by its side, this subsection follows the 'Supreme Court\u2019s guidance as to what constitutes a lie made for material gain. Indeed, th\u00e9 plurality in Alvarez explicitly stated that \u201c[w]here false claims are made to effect a fraud or secure moneys or other valuable considerations, say offers of employment, it is well established that the Government may restrict speech without affronting the First Amendment.\u201d 567 U.S. at 723, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (emphasis added). The misrepresentations criminalized in subsection (c) fall squarely into this category of speech. Additionally, subsection (c) limits criminal liability to only those who gain employment by misrepresentation and who have the intent to cause economic or other injury to the agricultural production facility, which further cabins the prohibition\u2019s scope. Given this clear limitation, we disagree with ALDF that the statute would reach \u201ca person who overstates her education or experience to get a job for which she otherwise would not have qualified, whether the person is an undercover investigator or not,\u201d because the requisite intent to injure would not be satisfied. On the other hand, this subsection would apply to an employee hired with an intent , to harm the employer, which, as Idaho points out, is a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is implied in all employment agreements in Idaho, Jenkins v. Boise Cascade Corp., 141 Idaho 233, 108 P.3d 380, 389-90 (2005); cf. Shackelford v. Shirley, 948 F.2d 935, 938 (5th Cir. 1991) (\u201c[T]hreats made with specific intent to injure and focused on a particular individual easily fall into that category of speech deserving of no first amendment protection.\u201d). Although it may be true that \u201c[t]he goal of undercover, employment-based invest\u00ed-gations is not to \u2018secure moneys or other valuable considerations\u2019 for the investigator, but rather to expose threats to the public,\u201d ALDF ignores that the Supreme Court singled out offers of employment and that these undercover investigators are nonetheless paid by the agricultural production facility as part of their employment. Of course, this does not mean that every investigative reporter hired under false pretenses intends to harm the employer. That is a critical element that requires proof. We are also not persuaded by ALDF\u2019s arguments that the statute was enacted solely to suppress a specific subject matter or viewpoint. See R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 384, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992). We reject ALDF\u2019s argument that the statute\u2019s restitution clause is a way to punish journalists and whistle-blowers for printing expos\u00e9s, because we do not interpret the restitution clause to include reputational and publication damages. See Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 52, 108 S.Ct. 876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988). The restitution clause requires a court to order a defendant \u201cto make restitution to the victim of the offense ... in an amount equal to twice the value of the damage resulting from the violation\u201d of the statute. Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 18-7042(4), 19-5304. Restitution is made for the \u201ceconomic loss\u201d to the victim. Idaho Code \u00a7 19-5304(l)(a). This includes \u201cthe value of property taken, destroyed, broken, or otherwise harmed, lost wages, and direct out-of-pocket losses or expenses, such as medical expenses resulting from the criminal conduct.\u201d Id. It does not include \u201cless tangible damage such as pain and suffering, wrongful death or emotional distress.\u201d Id.  That the statute excludes \u201cless tangible damage\u201d such as emotional distress indicates that reputational damages would not be considered an \u201ceconomic loss,\u201d and we are not aware of a case suggesting otherwise. Rather, Idaho case law defines \u201ceconomic loss\u201d as \u201ctangible out-of-pocket loss\u201d which the victim \u201cactually suffers.\u201d State v. Straub, 153 Idaho 882, 292 P.3d 273, 280 (2013). The restitution clause focuses on actual, quantifiable economic loss as opposed to abstract damages such as reputational harm. See id. In the absence of Idaho case law to the contrary, we read the statute\u2019s restitution clause as excluding reputational and publication damages.14 See Berger v. City of Seattle, 569 F.3d 1029, 1046 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (\u201c[Wlhere an unconstitutionally broad statute is readily subject to a narrowing construction that would eliminate its constitutional deficiencies, we accept that construction.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court erred by granting summary judgment on this ground.  For the same reasons as provided in our analysis of subsection (b), subsection (c) does not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it serves a \u201clegitimate governmental purpose.\u201d Mountain Water Co., 919 F.2d at 598. The same property and privacy concerns apply here\u2014employees have access to limited areas of an agricultural production facility and other confidential information that may lead to destruction or serious harm\u2014and Idaho has a legitimate governmental purpose in restricting such employment-seeking misrepresentations. This result follows from Alvarez. By establishing that misrepresentations to \u201csecure ... offers of employment\u201d may be restricted, the Court implicitly recognized that a government interest exists in restricting such speech. Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 723, 132 S.Ct. 2537. Thus, this subsection has a legitimate governmental purpose beyond an \u201cirrational prejudice\u201d against journalists and activists. City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 450, 105 S.Ct. 3249. II. The Recordings Clause\u2014Idaho Code \u00a7 18\u20147042(l)(d)  We now turn to the Recordings Clause, which prohibits a person from entering a private agricultural production facility and, without express consent from the facility owner, making audio or video recordings of the \u201cconduct of an agricultural production facility\u2019s operations.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 18\u20147042(l)(d). The Recordings Clause regulates speech protected by the First Amendment and is a classic example of a content-based restriction that cannot survive strict scrutiny.  We easily dispose of Idaho\u2019s claim that the act of creating an audiovisual recording is not speech protected by the First Amendment. This argument is akin to saying that even though a book is protected by the First Amendment, the process of writing the book is not. Audiovisual recordings are protected by the First Amendment as recognized \u201corgan[s] of public opinion\u201d and as a \u201csignificant medium for the communication of ideas.\u201d Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495, 501, 72 S.Ct. 777, 96 L.Ed. 1098 (1952) (extending First Amendment protection to movies). Indeed, \u201c[w]e live, relate, work, and decide in a world where image capture from life is routine, and captured images are part of ongoing discourse, both public and private.\u201d Seth F. Kreimer, Pervasive Image Capture and the First Amendment: Memory, Discourse, and the Right to Record, 159 U. Pa. L. Rev. 335, 337 (Jan. 2011).  It is no surprise that we have recognized that there is a \u201cFirst Amendment right to film matters of public interest.\u201d Fordyce v. City of Seattle, 55 F.3d 436, 439 (9th Cir. 1995). It defies common sense to disaggregate the creation of the video from the video or audio recording itself. The act of recording is itself an inherently expressive activity; decisions about content, composition, lighting, volume, and angles, among others, are expressive in the same way as the written word or a musical score. Rejecting an argument remarkably similar to Idaho\u2019s pitch here, we observed that neither the Supreme Court nor [the Ninth Circuit] has ever drawn a distinction between the process of creating a form of pure speech (such as writing or painting) and the product of these processes (the essay or artwork) in terms of the First Amendment protection afforded.... The process of expression through a medium has never been thought so distinct from the expression itself that we could disaggregate Picasso from his brushes and canvas, or that we could value Beethoven without the benefit of strings and woodwinds. In other words, we have never seriously questioned that the processes of writing words down on paper, painting a picture, and playing an instrument are purely expressive activities entitled to full First Amendment protection. Anderson v. City of Hermosa Beach, 621 F.3d 1051, 1061-62 (9th Cir. 2010) (determining that the tattooing process is purely expressive activity protected by the First Amendment); see also ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 595 (7th Cir. 2012) (\u201cThe act of making an audio or audiovisual recording is necessarily included within the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of speech.\u201d); Fields v. City of Philadelphia, 862 F.3d 353, 358 (3d Cir. 2017) (\u201cThe First Amendment protects actual photos, videos, and recordings ... and for this protection to have meaning the Amendment must also protect the act of ei'eating that material.\u201d) (emphasis added). Because the recording process is itself expressive and is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the resulting recording, the creation of audiovisual recordings is speech entitled to First Amendment protection as purely expressive activity. See Anderson, 621 F.3d at 1062.  The Recordings Clause prohibits the recording of a defined topic\u2014\u201cthe conduct of an agricultural production facility\u2019s operations.\u201d This provision is an \u201cobvious\u201d, example of a content-based regulation of speech because it \u201cdefin[es] regulated speech by particular subject matter.\u201d Reed v. Town of Gilbert, \u2014 U.S\u2014 135 S.Ct. 2218, 2227, 192 L.Ed.2d 236 (2015); see also United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. 460, 468, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010) (a statute was content-based when it prohibited \u201cvisual [and] auditory depiction[s] ... depending on whether they depict conduct in which a living animal is intentionally harmed\u201d (alterations in original)). A regulation is content-based when it draws a distinction \u201con its face\u201d regarding the message the speaker conveys or \u201cwhen the purpose and justification for the law are content based.\u201d Reed, 135 S.Ct. at 2228. The Recordings Clause checks both boxes. It would permit filming a vineyard\u2019s art collection but not the winemaking operation. Likewise, a videographer could record an after-hours birthday party among co-workers, a farmer\u2019s antique car collection, or a historic maple tree but not the animal abuse, feedlot operation, or slaughterhouse conditions. Problematically, Idaho has effectively eliminated the subject matter of any audio and visual recordings of agricultural operations made without consent and has therefore \u201cprohibited] public discussion of an entire topic.\u201d In re Nat'l Sec. Letter, 863 F.3d 1110, 1122 (9th Cir. 2017) (internal-, quotation marks omitted),-.And,-because the Recordings Clause prohibits the filming of agricultural \u201coperations\u201d but nothing else, its application explicitly pivots on the content of the recording; in other words, only by viewing the recording can the Idaho authorities make a determination about criminal liability. See League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. at 383, 104 S.Ct. 3106 (a statute is content-based when \u201cenforcement authorities must necessarily examine the content of the message\u201d to determine whether -it complies with the statute). Here, -the statute depends not just on \u201cwhere they say\u201d the message but also\u2014critically\u2014-\u201con what they say.\u201d McCullen v. Coakley, \u2014 U.S.\u2014, 134 S.Ct. 2518, 2531, 189 L.Ed.2d 502 (2014).  As a content-based regulation, the Recordings Clause is. constitutional only if it withstands strict scrutiny, meaning it \u201cis necessary to serve a compelling state interest\u201d and \u201cis narrowly drawn to achieve that end.\u201d Perry Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Perry Local Educators\u2019Ass\u2019n, 460 U.S. 37, 45, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983). Strict scrutiny is \u201can exacting test\u201d requiring \u201csome pressing public necessity, some essential value that has to be preserved; and even then the law must restrict as little speech as possible to serve the goal.\u201d Turner, 512 U.S. at 680, 114 S.Ct. 2445. As with the Misrepresentation Clauses, Idaho asserts that the Recordings Clause protects both property and privacy interests. Even assuming a compelling government interest, Idaho has not satisfied the narrow tailoring requirement because the statute is both under-inclusive and over-inclusive. Prohibiting only \u201caudio or video recordings,\u201d but saying nothing about photographs, is suspiciously under-inclusive. City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43, 51, 114 S.Ct. 2038, 129 L.Ed.2d 36 (\u201c[T]hat a regulation of speech may be impermissibly underinclusive is firmly grounded in basic First Amendment principles.\u201d). Why the making of audio and video recordings of operations would implicate property-or privacy harms, but photographs of the same content would not, is a mystery. This distinction defies the old adage that \u201ca picture is worfh a thousand words.\u201d Nor has Idaho explained how limiting the filming of operations, but nothing else, effectuates its interests better than eliminating all audio and video recordings at agricultural production facilities. Presumably, for example, an unauthorized recording of the agricultural production facility\u2019s buildings would still implicate Idaho\u2019s concerns about property, and the unauthorized filming of an employee birthday party would implicate concerns about privacy, Without some legitimate explanation, we are left to conclude that Idaho is singling out for suppression one mode of speech\u2014 audio and video recordings of agricultural operations\u2014to -keep controversy and sus-&lt; pect practices out of the public eye. Reed, 135 S.Ct. at 2229 (content-based laws lend themselves to use for \u201cinvidious, thought-control purposes\u201d). The district court aptly noted that \u201c[t]he recording prohibition gives agricultural facility owners veto power, allowing owners to decide what can and cannot be recorded, effectively turning them into state-backed censors able to silence unfavorable speech about their facilities.\u201d The Recordings Clause is also over-inclusive and suppresses more speeeh than necessary to further Idaho\u2019s stated goals of protecting property and privacy. See Lone Star Security and Video, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 827 F.3d 1192, 1197 (9th Cir. 2016). Because there are \u201cvarious other laws at [Idaho\u2019s] disposal that would allow it to achieve its stated interests while burdening little or no speech,\u201d the law is not narrowly tailored. Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach, 657 F.3d 936, 949 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (applying intermediate scrutiny). For example, agricultural production facility owners can vindicate their rights .through tort laws against theft of trade secrets and invasion of- privacy, Idaho Code \u00a7 48-801 et seq. (prohibiting misappropriation- of trade secrets); Taylor v. K.T.V.B., Inc., 96 Idaho 202, 525 P.2d 984, 985 (1974) (outlining the invasion of privacy torts). To the extent .the legislators expressed concern that fabricated recordings of animal abuse would invade privacy rights, the victims can turn to defamation actions for recourse. Even still, as Alvarez points out, \u201c[t]he.remedy.for speech that is false is speech that is true\u201d\u2014-and not, as Idaho would like, the suppression of that speech. 567 U.S. at. 727, 132 S.Ct. 2537. For these reasons, the Recordings Clause cannot survive First Amendment scrutiny and is therefore unconstitutional. In light of this result, we need not analyze the Recordings Clause under the Equal Protection Clause. In sum, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment with respect to \u00a7\u00a7 18-7042(l)(a) and (d). We reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment with respect to \u00a7\u00a7 18-7042(l)(b) and (c). The permanent injunction should be modified accordingly.

The statute also criminalizes physical damage to an agricultural production facility\u2019s operations, Idaho Code \u00a7 18\u20147042(l)(e), but that provision has not been challenged in this case.   . In full, the law defines \"agricultural production\u201d to mean \u201cactivities associated with the production of agricultural products for food, fiber, fuel and other lawful uses,\u201d including but not limited to: \"construction, expansion, use, maintenance and repair of an agricultural production facility; preparing land for agricultural production; handling or applying pesticides, herbicides or other chemicals, compounds or substances labeled for insects, pests, crops, weeds, water or soil; planting, irrigating, growing, fertilizing, harvesting or producing agricultural, horticultural, floricultural and viticultural crops, fruits and vegetable products, field grains, seeds, hay, sod and nursery stock, and other plants, plant products, plant byproducts, plant waste and plant compost; breeding, hatching, raising, producing, feeding and keeping livestock, dairy animals, swine, furbearing animals, poultry, eggs, fish and other aquatic species, and other animals, animal products and animal byproducts, animal waste, animal compost, and bees, bee products and bee byproducts; processing and packaging agricultural products, including the processing and packaging of agricultural products into food and other agricultural commodities; [and] manufacturing animal feed,\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(2)(a).   . ALDF also brought claims against Governor C.L, \"Butch\u201d Otter, but the district court dismissed him as a defendant. His dismissal is not challenged on appeal.   . The same is true of subsections (b) and (c); ALDF challenges only the misrepresentation prongs. In its opening brief, Idaho limits the definition of a \"misrepresentation\u201d to an af- ' firmative misrepresentation\u2014-not an omission: \"[t]his means that the representations must be affirmative; omissions are insufficient. And they must be knowingly false. Mistakes or opinions will not support a prosecution.\"   . We disagree with the district court's suggestion that the only harm from gaining access to property by misrepresentation \u201cwould arise, say, from the publication of a story about the facility.\u201d Such reasoning is problematic because it assumes, among other things,.that a publication about the facility will necessarily harm the facility. At issue here is the speech to gain entry to the facility, not the journalistic creation or speculative harm that may \"arise\u201d after entry. Focusing on such speculative harm sweeps in too many scenarios in which a person entering the property causes no harm to the property or its owner. This approach also places a value judgment on the reporting itself and undermines the First Amendment right to critique and criticize.   . The dissent\u2019s citation to Green v. Beaver State Contractors, Inc., 93 Idaho 741, 472 P.2d 307, 307 (1970) is misplaced. This is not the case of the hapless teenager and has nothing to do with the First Amendment and entry upon property. Rather, it is a civil contract matter and the question\u2014left unanswered\u2014 was whether there were any civil damages for trespass by a contractor who traversed land without authorization.   . ,On another claim, the Fourth Circuit determined that the reporters \"committed trespass by breaching their duty of loyalty\u201d as employees of Food Lion. Food Lion, 194 F.3d at 518. Idaho did not raise any similar arguments here and, therefore, this portion of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding is inapposite, to our decision.   . We read the statute to cover records obtained from the agricultural production facility and not as implicating records obtained via Idaho\u2019s Public Records Act, Idaho Code \u00a7 74-101 et seq., or other lawful avenues.   . Because we determine that subsections (b) and (c) do not-burden speech protected by the First Amendment, the subsections do not discriminate on the basis of the fundamental right to speech.   . On a more basic level, we cannot see how the restitution provision is inevitably viewpoint based. Restitution is pegged to economic loss, not to the view expressed, which could be a positive puff piece or a negative critique. The issue is documented loss, not viewpoint.  ",

            "opinion_text": " BEA, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part and concurring in part: The majority apparently believes that unconsented entry1 upon land is not a \u201clegally cognizable harm\u201d where it \u201cmerely allows the speaker to cross the threshold of another\u2019s property.\u201d But as a matter of the applicable Idaho law, such an uncon-sented entry constitutes a common law trespass, which is a legally cognizable harm\u2014one from which damages are presumed to flow naturally. Taysom v. Taysom, 82 Idaho 58, 349 P.2d 556, 560 (1960) (\u201cNominal damage need not be proved, but naturally flows from a wrongful entry.\u201d). I dissent because I would hold that the \u201cability to hold property or to exercise control of it\u201d requires recognition by courts of the owner\u2019s right to exclusive possession of the land\u2014the right to exclude anyone from entry, at any time, and for any reason at all or indeed for no reason.2 The majority brushes aside this longstanding principle of property in concluding that entry by misrepresentation \u201cdoes not infringe upon the specific interests trespass seeks to protect.\u201d The majority\u2019s result contradicts the \u201cuniversally held\u201d principle that the \u201cright to exclude\u201d is \u201ca fundamental element of the property right.\u201d Kaiser Aetna v. United, States, 444 U.S. 164, 179-80, 100 S.Ct. 383, 62 L.Ed.2d 332 (1979). Whilst the majority opinion relies on out-of-circuit cases which seemingly limit a landowner\u2019s rights,3 but which are distinguishable, I choose to rely on the law of Idaho and the common-law right of property, ages old. \u201cThere is nothing which so generally strikes the imagination, and engages the affections of mankind, as the right of property; or that sole and despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world, in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe.\u201d 2 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws op England *2. For centuries, Anglo-American law has affirmed this central feature of property\u2014 the right to exclude others\u2014in the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that \u201cour law holds the property of every man so sacred, that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour\u2019s close without his leave.\u201d Florida v. Jardines, 569 U.S. 1, 8, 133 S.Ct. 1409, 185 L.Ed.2d 495 (2013) (alteration and internal quotation omitted) (quoting Entick v. Carrington, 2 Wils. K.B. 275, 95 Eng. Rep. 807 (K.B. 1765), \u201ca case \u2018undoubtedly familiar\u2019 to \u2018every American statesman\u2019 at the time of the Founding\u201d). The Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly held that \u201cas to property reserved by its owner for private use, \u2018the right to exclude others is \u201cone of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property.\u201d \u2019 \u201d See, e.g., Nollan v. California Coastal Comm\u2019n, 483 U.S. 825, 831, 107 S.Ct. 3141, 97 L.Ed.2d 677 (1987) (quoting Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 435, 102 S.Ct. 3164, 73 L.Ed.2d 868 (1982) (alteration omitted)). I therefore dissent from the majority opinion as to subsection (a) of the Idaho statute at issue. I otherwise concur in the majority opinion. The majority analyzes this case under United States v. Alvarez, in which the Supreme Court invalidated under the First Amendment the Stolen Valor Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 704, a federal statute which made criminal false claims that the speaker had received the Congressional Medal of Honor. 567 U.S. 709, 132 S.Ct. 2537, 183 L.Ed.2d 574 (2012). At the outset, it is important to note that subsection (a) of the Idaho statute at issue in this case differs from the version of the Stolen Valor Act at issue in Alvarez in at least one crucial aspect: Whereas the Stolen Valor Act prohibited the act of lying about a particular subject (receipt of military decorations or medals), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 704, subsection (a) of Idaho\u2019s statute prohibits the act of entering a particular type of property (\u201cagricultural production facilities\u201d) by particular means (including \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d), Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042(l)(a).4 By the plain meaning of the statute, liability attaches only to those who \u201center[ ]\u201d an agricultural production facility through lying, not to any and all who tell lies to agricultural facility owners or to the public about such owners. Id. In other words, subsection (a) of the Idaho statute does not prohibit \u201cpure speech.\u201d Although under Alvarez a lie\u2014without \u201cmore\u201d\u2014is pure speech,5 the Idaho statute is directed at something \u201cmore\u201d: the conduct of knowingly entering an agricultural facility through the use of a lie. The use of the term \u201centers\u201d is a clear invocation of the standards and interests of the law of trespass.6 This provision no more regulates pure speech than do prohibitions on larceny by trick or false pretenses.7  Therefore, I don\u2019t see how Alvarez is applicable, or that a First Amendment analysis is at all necessary to subsection (a) of the subject Idaho statute. See Pickup v. Brown, 740 F.3d 1208, 1230 (9th Cir. 2014)8 (\u201c[A]n act that \u2018symbolizes nothing,\u2019 even if employing language, is not \u2018an act of communication\u2019 that transforms conduct into First Amendment speech.\u201d (quoting Nevada Comm\u2019n on Ethics v. Carrigan, 564 U.S. 117, 126-27, 131 S.Ct. 2343, 180 L.Ed.2d 150 (2011))).9 Here, as in Pickwp and Carrigan, a common law trespass \u201csymbolizes nothing.\u201d It seems plain to me that Idaho\u2019s political branches could enact a general criminal trespass law that includes in its definition of \u201ctrespass\u201d entry obtained by fraud or misrepresentation. Cf. Rowe v. City of Pocatello, 70 Idaho 343, 218 P.2d 695, 701 (1950) (\u201c[T]he city could ban the practice of uninvited intrusion upon private residences ... The city could ... merely declare it a misdemeanor.\u201d); Idaho Code \u00a7 18-2403 (prohibiting theft by deception, trick, or false pretenses). If that is so, I see nothing to prevent Idaho legislators from extending such protection only to certain types of properties, such as nuclear facilities, see 10 C\u2019F.R. \u00a7 160.3 (prohibiting trespass on \u201cfacilities, installations, and; real property subject to the jurisdiction ... of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\u201d). The relative importance of nuclear facilities and \u201cagricultural production facilities\u201d is in the eyes of the beholder, or, in this case, the Idaho state legislature. Even assuming that Alvarez is applicable here, subsection (a) survives First Amendment review under Alvarez. As the majority recognizes, false speech may be criminalized if made \u201cfor the purpose of material gain\u201d or \u201cmaterial advantage,\u201d or if it inflicts a \u201clegally cognizable harm.\u201d Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 719, 723, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (plurality opinion). Similarly, in his concurrence with Justice Kennedy\u2019s plurality opinion in Alvarez, Justice Breyer distinguished the Stolen Valor Act from presumptively constitutional statutes, such as those prohibiting fraud, impersonation, trademark infringement etc., which prohibit \u201ca subset of lies where specific harm is more likely to occur.\u201d Id. at 734-36, 132, S.Ct. 2537 (Breyer, J., concurring) (emphasis added). To the extent that subsection (a) prohibits misrepresentations as well as entries, I have no difficulty concluding that \u201centering]\u201d the property of another \u201cby ... misrepresentation\u201d inflicts a \u201clegally cognizable harm,\u201d Alvarez, 567 at 719, is done for the purpose of material gain, id. at 723, 132 S.Ct. 2537, and involves \u201ca subset of lies\u201d where the \u201cspecific harm\u201d of trespass \u201cis more likely to occur,\u201d id. at 736, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (Breyer, J., concurring). The state of Idaho has long recognized that a violation of a property owner\u2019s exclusive dominion over his land is a legally cognizable harm. See Marshall v. Niagara Springs Orchard Co, 22 Idaho 144, 125 P. 208, 212 (1912) (\u201c[I]t is the appellant\u2019s right by reason of his ownership of the land to have exclusive possession of said land.\u201d (emphasis added)); see also Walter E. Wilhite Revocable Living Tr. v. Nw. Yearly Meeting Pension Fund, 128 Idaho 539, 916 P.2d 1264, 1274 (1996) (\u201cTrespass is a tort against possession committed when one, without permission, interferes with another\u2019s exclusive right to possession of the property.\u201d (emphasis added)); Idaho Code \u00a7 22-2402 (defining \u201clandowner\u201d to mean \u201c[a] person with an interest in a parcel of land such that the person has the right to exclude others from possession of the parcel\u201d). The majority\u2019s proposal to count as a \u201clegally cognizable harm\u201d only those trespasses that violate Idaho\u2019s criminal code is thus foreclosed by the contrary substantive law of Idaho and other common law jurisdictions. \u201cOne who intentionally enters land in the possession of another is subject to liability to the possessor for a trespass, although his presence on the land causes no harm to the land, its possessor, or to any thing or person in whose security the possessor has a legally protected interest.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 163 (1965). To vindicate his right of exclusive dominion, a landowner may recover nominal damages for trespass\u2014even absent evidence of any physical or pecuniary injury\u2014because \u201c[njominal damage need not be \u25a0 proved, but naturally flows from a wrongful entry.\u201d Taysom v. Taysom, 82 Idaho 58, 349 P.2d 556, 560 (1960); see also Nelson v. Holdaway Land &amp; Cattle Co., 107 Idaho 550, 691 P.2d 796, 799 (Idaho Ct. App. 1984) (owner was entitled to recover nominal damages for trespass \u201ceven though no actual damages were proven\u201d). Furthermore, a landowner has a general right to exclude others from his lands by reasonable force, under certain circumstances. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 77 (1965). Generally speaking, a landowner can use such reasonable force to defend \u201chis exclusive possession of land\u201d from others for any reason at all, even \u201cpersonal dislike or hostility to the other.\u201d See id. cmt. c; Rowe v. City of Pocatello, 70 Idaho 343, 218 P.2d 695, 700 (1950) (\u201cA man\u2019s house is still his castle. He may exclude whom he chooses.\u201d). In fact, no less an authority than the Supreme Court of Idaho has found an actionable trespass where the defendant used a misrepresentation to gain access, to the plaintiffs property and the defendant merely crossed the property. In Green v. Beaver State Contractors, - Inc., the contractor went to plaintiff Lula M. Green and sought permission to enter and remove \u201clava rock\u201d from her land.' 93 Idaho 741, 472 P.2d 307, 307 (1970). The contractor offered to pay $1 plus 5 cents \u201cper yard of rock removed\u201d from Green\u2019s land, and she agreed. Id. at 307-08. In reality, however, the contractor removed rock only from land adjoining Green\u2019s land and was merely using Green\u2019s land as a means of access to obtain the rock from the third party, thus avoiding any obligation to pay Green for \u201crock removed.\u201d Id. at 308. \u201cIn view of the circumstances,\u201d namely the \u201cmisrepresentation ... by [the contractor],\u201d the Idaho Supreme Court found a common-law trespass and remanded the case for a determination of Green\u2019s damages. Id. at 310. Therefore, the Supreme Court of Idaho has recognized- that employing- misrepre\u2019sentation to gain entry- inflicts a legally cognizable harm, even if the invader entered \u201cmerely ... to cross the threshold of another\u2019s property.\u201d \u2019 In the case of Jacque v. Steenberg Homes, Inc., 209 Wis.2d 605, 563 N.W.2d 154 (Wisc. 1997), the. Supreme Court of Wisconsin affirmed the value of the right to exclude even more emphatically. It affirmed an eye-popping award of punitive damages for the precise sort of \u201cmere\u201d threshold-crossing that the majority pooh-poohs here. In that case, the defendant, Steenberg Homes, had sold a mobile home to a neighbor of the Jacques, who were retired farmers. It determined that \u201cthe easiest route\u201d to deliver the mobile home would be to cut across the Jacques\u2019 land. Id. at 157. The \u201conly alternative\u201d was to haul the mobile home through a sharply-curved private road which was covered in seven feet of snow at the time. Id. Understandably, Steenberg saw a material advantage in \u201cmerely ... crossing] the threshold\u201d of the Jacques\u2019 property. The Jacques refused permission to haul the mobile home across their land, but Steen-berg did so anyway. Id. at 157-58. The jury awarded nominal damages of $1 and punitive damages of $100,000, id. at 158, and the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, upheld the award in full. Id. at 166. Not only did the jury properly award nominal damages because \u201c[t]he law infers some damage from every direct entry upon the land of another,\u201d id. at 160 (quoting Prosser and Keeton on Torts, \u00a7 13 (5th ed. 1984)), the jury also properly awarded punitive damages to vindicate the strong interest of individual landowners and of society in protecting private property from trespass, id. The Idaho trespass statute cited in the majority opinion is not relevant. The majority cites Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7008(9) for the proposition that only lands posted with \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs can be trespassed upon under Idaho law. But while the cited statute so limits actions seeking criminal penalties for \u201cwillful and intentional ]\u201d trespass, it does not otherwise override or eliminate common law trespass in Idaho.10 Nor does Idaho Code \u00a7 6-202, which provides for treble damages in civil actions for \u201cwillful and intentional[ ]\u201d trespass and also requires posted \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs: [T]he Idaho statutes governing trespass only apply when the trespass is shown to have been wilful and intentional, and the wronged party seeks treble damages therefor, as authorized by Section 6-202. In all other circumstances, the common law principles relating to trespass actions apply. The court is unaware of any recent Idaho cases to the contrary, and the 1976 amendments to the statutes did nothing to alter this interpretation .... Mock v. Potlatch Corp., 786 F.Supp. 1545, 1548 (D. Idaho 1992) (citing Menasha Woodenware Co. v. Spokane Int\u2019l. Ry., 19 Idaho 586, 115 P. 22 (1911)).11 Thus, the \u201cimaginations\u201d and \u201caffections\u201d of Idahoans are not so different from those of greater mankind. See Blackstone, supra. Unauthorized entry upon the land of another is common-law trespass in Idaho and thus a legally cognizable harm.12  The majority also argues, based on two out-of-circuit cases, that not all misrepresentations necessarily .vitiate consent to entry. The majority cites Desnick v. Am. Broad. Cos., Inc., 44 F.3d 1345 (7th Cir. 1995), and Food Lion, Inc. v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., 194 F.3d 505, 517 (4th Cir. 1999). Both Desnick and Food Lion note, in discussing the common law of various other jurisdictions, that there is no consensus on this issue. Food Lion, Inc., 194 F.3d at 517 (\u201c[T]he various jurisdictions and authorities in this country are not of one mind in dealing with the issue.\u201d); Desnick, 44 F.3d at 1352-53 (noting diversity of results in entry-by-misrepresentation cases and proposing a new rule\u2014of undisclosed origin\u2014to reconcile them); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 173 cmt. b (1965) (providing that \u201c[a] conscious misrepresentation as to the purpose for which admittance to the land is sought, may be a fraudulent misrepresentation of a material fact\u201d which vitiates consent pursuant to Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 892B). As relevant here, however, the law of Idaho is contrary 'to the Desnick and Food Lion decisions. See Beaver State Contractors, Inc., 472 P.2d at 310 (finding trespass where defendant entered and crossed the owner\u2019s property by misrepresentation). Even if entries such as those at issue in Desnick or Food Lion (or Beaver State) neither damage the premises nor \u201cdisrupt\u201d the owner\u2019s activities thereon, wrongful entry is nonetheless a \u201clegally cognizable harm\u201d per se. Taysom, 349 P.2d at 560 (\u201cNominal damage ... naturally flows from a wrongful entry.\u201d). Furthermore, there is no suggestion in either Desnick or Food Lion that the First Amendment prohibits a state court or state legislature from establishing a different rule eliminating consent to enter land when the consent is procured by fraud. Cf. Illinois, ex rel. Madigan v. Telemarketing Assocs., Inc., 538 U.S. 600, 624, 123 S.Ct. 1829, 155 L.Ed.2d 793 (2003) (\u201cConsistent with our precedent and the First Amendment, States may maintain fraud actions when fundraisers make false or misleading representations designed to deceive donors about how their donations will be used.\u201d); State v. Jesser, 95 Idaho 43, 501 P.2d 727, 737 n.29 (1972) (\u201cIt has long been settled that fraud vitiates the consent of the victim to the taking of his property by agreement, and that, consequently, the taking is a constructive trespass upon possession .... \u201d); Idaho Code \u00a7 18-2403 (prohibiting theft by deception, trick, or false pretenses). If the problem with subsection (a) is that it enacts something different from the substantive law of trespass advocated by a Seventh Circuit or Fourth Circuit panel, any suggestion that those panels have hit upon a \u201cbetter rule\u201d should be directed to the Idaho legislature. It is Idaho law that governs what constitutes valid consent for a license sufficient to avoid a trespass on Idaho land.'- Subsection (a) is also limited to lies which are likely to cause a \u201cspecific harm,\u201d as Justice Breyer\u2019s Alvarez concurrence would require. Justice Breyer distinguished the Stolen Valor Act, which prohibited \u201cfalsity and nothing more,\u201d from various other statutes which prohibit certain false or deceptive communications which cause or are likely to cause a \u201cspecific harm.\u201d Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 734-36, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (Breyer, J., concurring). For example, (1) fraud statutes require \u201cactual injury,\u201d (2) defamation statutes require a reputational harm, (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress liability requires an \u201cemotional, dignitary, or privacy-related\u201d harm, (4) statutes dealing with perjury or lying to government officials are \u201ctypically limited to circumstances where a lie is likely to ... interfer[e] with the functioning of a government department,\u201d (5) impersonation statutes focus \u201cmay require\u201d a showing that someone was deceived into following a course of action he would not have pursued but for the deceitful conduct, and (6) trademark infringement statutes are focused on infringement which causes confusion among consumers about the source of a product, and thereby dilutes the value of a trademark. Alvarez, 567 U.S. at \u25a0 734-36, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (Breyer, J., concurring). The \u201cspecific harm\u201d requirement thus mandates that a prohibition on lies be' limited to or \u201cfocused on\u201d lies which are \u201cmore likely\u201d to cause a discrete and identifiable type of harm. That is, a generalized prohibition on telling lies about consumer prod-uets is overbroad, while a prohibition on lies which are likely to trick consumers into buying a product they would not otherwise buy is not. Unlike the Stolen Valor Act, subsection (a) is limited to lies which are likely to cause a specific harm: invasion of and onto land, or the harm to property owners\u2019 right to exclude others. In fact, in this analysis, subsection (a) is even better than Justice Breyer\u2019s trademark infringement and impersonation examples because the specific harm must occur for liability to attach, rather than just be \u201cmore likely\u201d to occur. Conversely, when one obtains permission to enter onto the land of another,'he obtains a material gain: a license to enter. The resulting license is a legally cognizable interest or privilege. See Restatement (First) of Property \u00a7 512 (1944) (\u201c[T]he word \u2018license\u2019 indicates the legal interest arising from a consent.\u201d). It confers the ability to do lawfully that which the law otherwise forbids and punishes as trespass. Shultz v. Atkins, 97 Idaho 770, 554 P.2d 948, 953 (1976) (\u201c[A]n essential element of a license ... [is] the right to use land in the possession of another.\u201d). Take the example, suggested by the Majority\u2019s opinion, of the teenager who lies to get a reservation at an exclusive restaurant. The majority admits that the teenager gains something (entry to the restaurant) but concludes, without explanation,13 that \u201c[t]his entry alone does not constitute a material gain.\u201d No material gain to the teenager? However one defines' \u201cmaterial\u201d14 and \u201cgain,\u201d15 it seems \u00e1 stretch to say the teenager stands to obtain neither at the restaurant. The majority must imagine the lad served thin gruel indeed for him to have received nothing of \u201csubstance,\u201d l\u00e9aving him with a sense of not \u201cgetting something\u201d as a result of hoodwinking the maitre d\u2019hdtel. Furthermore, if the teenager takes a seat in the restaurant with permission procured by fraud, he commits trespass and is liable for at least nominal damages. But if he obtains consent, he is able, to gain lawful (albeit limited) use of another\u2019s land\u2014a discrete, legally cognizable advantage16 that he did.not have before consent was given. If nothing else, he gains a suspension of the owner\u2019s right to expel him from the restaurant by force. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 77 (1965). \u2022 The majority\u2019s restaurant analogy merely evades the crucial inquiries under Alvarez. First, \u201centry alone\u201d is a legally cognizable harm under Idaho law; that is why under Idaho law aggrieved landowners, subjected to a trespass, need not prove unjust enrichment or any other form of damages. Taysom, 349 P.2d at 560. Legally cognizable harm\u2014not some unknown quantum of physical damage or economic harm to be determined by courts ex post, on a case-by-case basis\u2014is what Alvarez requires. Alvarez, 567 U.S. at 719, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (plurality opinion). Second, although \u201centry alone\u201d may seem insignificant to the majority, it was apparently significant to\u2018the Beaver State contractor who took the shortcut across Ms. Green\u2019s land. See supra at 1209-10. And in the majority\u2019s hypothetical, it is apparently significant to restauranteurs who offer their in-demand tables to \u201cwell-known journalists\u201d but not to journalists\u2019 teenage sons. Indeed, the teenager does cause economic harm in the majority\u2019s hypothetical: When he secures one of a limited number of reservations, he takes a valuable table off of the market and puts it to a perhaps economically sub-optimal use (his own). That is, unless his journalist mother has been splendid as to an allowance. Third, the majority\u2019s hypothetical does not present a case of entry \u201cby misrepresentation.\u201d The maitre d\u2019hotel must recognize that the teenager is not his famous journalist mother when the teenager arrives at the restaurant; if he seats the teenager anyway, then the restaurant consents to the entry and the teenager does not violate the Idaho statute. Finally, the majority concludes that the teenager\u2019s lie is \u201cpure speech.\u201d \u201cNothing but speech,\u201d yes; but a lie is seldom \u201cpure.\u201d Nonetheless, the Idaho statute criminalizes entries, not lies. See supra, at 1207. The majority seems to be concerned'\u2014 understandably\u2014that the Idaho law\u2019s punishments for such trespasses are Draconian' or unwise (\u201cthe teenager would be subject to punishment of up to one year in prison, a fine not to exceed $5,000, or both.\u201d). But that concern has nothing to do with whether entry-by-misrepresentation inflicts a legally cognizable harm or provides a material gain\u2014which is to say that it has nothing to do with the Alvarez analysis. That the Idaho statute may take a heavy-handed approach to punishing certain trespasses is a policy argument against the Idaho statute, and that argument should be addressed to Idaho\u2019s legislators and voters. The misconception of the ancient right at stake\u2014the right of an owner of real property to exclude all others from his property\u2014is where the majority goes wrong, as our holding as to subsection (b) demonstrates. Applying Alvarez to subsection (b), the majority finds that \u201cObtaining an agricultural production facility\u2019s records by misrepresentation inflicts a \u2018legally cognizable harm\u2019 by impairing an agricultural production facility owner\u2019s ability to control who can assert dominion over, arid take possession of, his property.\u201d Quite right. The farmer\u2019s records are his property. So is his land his property. Subsection (a) is constitutional for precisely the same reason: Entering an agricultural production facility by misrepresentation inflicts a \u201clegally cognizable harm\u201d by \u201cimpairing an agricultural production facility owner\u2019s \u00e1bility to control who can assert dominion over ... his [real] property.\u201d There is no meaningful legal distinction between the two subsections under Alvarez, and neither is unconstitutional. I respectfully dissent.  . Fraud or misrepresentation vitiates consent. Green v. Beaver State Contractors, Inc., 93 Idaho 741, 472 P.2d 307, 307 (1970) (finding trespass where defendant obtained permission to cross plaintiff\u2019s land by misrepresentation); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 173 (1965); see also id., cmt. b (\"A conscious misrepresentation as to the purpose for which admittance to the land is sought, may' be a fraudulent misrepresentation of a material fact.\u201d).   . In a society governed by the Rule of Law, exceptions to the right of the owner to exclusive possession of his land can be made by due process of law, such as court orders and official acts.   . The majority cites Desnick v. Am. Broad. Cos., Inc., 44 F.3d 1345 (7th Cir. 1995), and Food Lion, Inc. v. Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., 194 F.3d 505, 517 (4th Cir. 1999).   . Idaho Code \u00a7 18-7042 provides that a person commits the misdemeanor crime of \u201cinterference with agricultural production\u201d if the person \"knowingly\u201d \u201c(a) [i]s not employed by an agricultural production facility and enters an agricultural production facility by force, threat, misrepresentation, or trespass\u201d (emphasis added).   . In Alvarez, the Supreme Court explicitly distinguished cases of \"defamation, fraud, or some other legally cognizable harm associated with a false statement\u201d from cases that confront \"a measure, like the Stolen Valor Act, that targets falsity and nothing more.\u201d 567 U.S. at 719, 132 S.Ct. 2537 (emphasis added).   . \"One who intentionally enters land in the possession of another is subject to liability to the possessor for a trespass, although his presence on the land causes no harm to the land, its possessor, or to any thing or person in whose security the possessor has a legally protected interest.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 163 (1965) (emphasis added). The term \"enters land\u201d is defined \"to include, not only coming upon land, but also remaining on it, and, in addition, to include the presence upon the land of a third person or thing which the actor has caused to be or to remain there.\u201d Id. \u00a7 158.   . For example, in Idaho \"[tjheft includes a wrongful taking, obtaining or withholding of another's property ... committed ... [b]y deception ... [or] [b]y conduct heretofore defined or known as ... common law larceny by trick .... [or] obtaining property, money or labor under false pretenses.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 18-2403; see also 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708 (\u201cWhoever ... by fraud or deception obtains ... from or out of any mail, post office, or station thereof, letter box, mail receptacle ... or other authorized depository ... any article or thing contained therein ... [s]hall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d).   .In Pickup, the plaintiffs brought a First Amendment challenge to California Senate Bill 1172 (\u201cSB 1172\u201d), which banned state-licensed mental health providers from engaging in \"sexual orientation change efforts\u201d with patients under 18 years of age. 740 F.3d at 1221. The district court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the law and California appealed. Id. at 1222. This court engaged in plenary review, id., upheld SB 1172, id. at 1236, and reversed the grant of the preliminary injunction, id. The panel found that SB 1172 regulated professional conduct, rather than speech, by banning a certain form of treatment, and so was \u201csubject to deferential review just as are other regulations of the practice of medicine.\u201d Id. at 1229-31.   . In Cardigan, the petitioner, the Nevada Commission on Ethics, investigated respondent Carrigan under Nevada\u2019s \"Ethics in Government\" law, which required public officials to recuse themselves from voting on or advocating a vote on matters in which a reasonable person would be materially affected by their private interests. 564 U.S. at 119-20, 131 S.Ct. .2343. The Commission concluded that Carrigan violated the law by voting to approve a hotel/casino project in which his campaign manager was involved. Id. at 120, 131 S.Ct. 2343. The Nevada Supreme Court found the ethics law overbroad, and the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari. Id. at 121, 131 S.Ct. 2343. The Court held that a legislator's vote is \"nonsymbolic conduct\u201d and reversed. Id. at 127, 129, 131 S.Ct. 2343. \"[T]he act, of voting symbolizes nothing. It discloses, to be sure, that the legislator wishes (for whatever reason) that the proposition on the floor be- adopted, just as a physical assault discloses that the attacker dislikes the victim. But neither ... is an act of communication.\u201d Id. at 126-27, 131 S.Ct. 2343.   . \u201cThe common law of England, so far as it is not repugnant to, or inconsistent with, the constitution or laws of the United States, in all cases not provided for in these compiled laws, is the rule of decision in all courts of this state.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 73-116. \u201c[C]hanges in the common law by the adoption of a statute may not be presumed, nor may such changes be accomplished by legislation of doubtful implication.\u201d Indus. Indem. Co. v. Columbia Basin Steel &amp; Iron Inc., 93 Idaho 719, 723, 471 P.2d 574 (1970),   . In Menasha, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant went on its lands and cut and removed timber. 115 P. at 23. The trial court awarded treble damages and the defendant appealed. Id. at 24. The Supreme Court of Idaho reversed the award of statutory treble damages. Id. at 24-25. The court read a willfulness requirement into the statute and reversed the award because there was no allegation that the trespass was willful. Id. at 24-25. In so doing, however, the court noted that the complaint was \"good as an action at common law, entitling the plaintiff to his actual damage,\u201d but simply did not meet the statutory requirements for trebled damages. Id. at 25. Rather, the court concluded that \"the damages recoverable at common law would afford an adequate reparation.\u201d Id. The court therefore reduced the judgment to provide only actual damages and affirmed the judgment, so modified. Id.   .Nowhere does Alvarez hold that a \u201clegally cognizable harm\u201d must also be a crime. In fact, Alvarez points to classic common law injuries\u2014\u201cdefamation,\u201d \u201cfraud,\u201d and \"invasion of privacy\u201d\u2014as examples of \u201clegally cognizable harms.\u201d 567 U.S. at 719, 132 S.Ct. 2537.   . Because the majority does not explain how it reaches this conclusion, I assume it is my colleagues' own appraisal of the restaurant's menu.   . Material: \"1. of matter; of substance ... \u2019 physical: a material obj\u00e9ct ... 2. a, of the body or bodily needs, satisfactions ... corporeal .... \u201d MATERIAL, Webster's New World College Dictionary (5th ed. 2014).   . Gain: \"1. An increase; addition ... 2. the act of getting something GAIN, Webster's New World College Dictionary (5th ed. 2014).   .Furthermore, as an empirical matter, it is not self-evidently true that interfering only with the right to exclude does not appropriate anything of material value. See Jonathan Klick &amp; Gideon Parchomovsky, The Value of the Right to Exclude: An Empirical Assessment, 165 U. Pa. L. Rev. 917 (2017) (finding, based on an empirical analysis of the effect of legislation that recognized a '\u201cright to roam\u201d in England and Wales on.property values, that \u201ceven so-called slight intrusions on owners' exclusion right in favor of more public access ... come at a real cost to owners\u201d).
