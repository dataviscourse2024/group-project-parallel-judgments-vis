At the time of his arrest, the defendant was in possession of the fruits of the crime. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution (see, People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620, 621), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (see, CPL 470.15 [5]). Mangano, P. J., H. Miller, Feuerstein, Schmidt and Smith, JJ., concur.\n",
