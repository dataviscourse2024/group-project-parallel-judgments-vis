PARADISE ENTERTAINMENT GROUP, INC. et al.\n     v. FAVORS.\n\n      PHIPPS, Senior Appellate Judge.\n\n      In this personal injury action, defendants Paradise Entertainment Group, Inc.,\n\nd/b/a Magic City (\u201cPEG\u201d), M-Entertainment Properties, LLC d/b/a Magic City\n\n(\u201cMEP\u201d), and M-Entertainment & Consultant Service, Inc. (\u201cMEC\u201d)1 (collectively,\n\n\u201cthe Magic City Defendants\u201d) appeal from the partial denial of their motion for\n\nsummary judgment, following our grant of their application for interlocutory review.\n\nSee Paradise Entertainment Group v. Favors, Case No. A21I0236 (Aug. 11, 2021).\n\nThe Magic City Defendants raise several challenges to the trial court\u2019s summary\n\njudgment rulings. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Magic City\n\n      1\n       MEC also is referred to in the record as \u201c-M- Entertainment and Consulting\nService, Inc.\u201d\n\fDefendants are entitled to summary judgment on all remaining claims against them\n\nand reverse the judgment of the trial court on that basis.\n\n      Viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff Demetric Favors, the nonmoving\n\nparty, see City of St. Marys v. Reed, 346 Ga. App. 508, 508-509 (816 SE2d 471)\n\n(2018), the record shows that, on the night in question, on-duty uniformed Atlanta\n\nPolice Officer Emanuel Thompson2 parked his marked patrol car in a parking lot\n\nadjacent to Magic City, an adult entertainment club in Atlanta.3 Officer Thompson\n\nwas in that area in his capacity as a police officer and at the direction of a supervisor,\n\nas there had been a shooting nearby the night before. At that time, defendant L.A.\n\nEnterprise Security Services (\u201cLA Security\u201d), which is owned by LaTiesa Alford,4\n\nprovided private security services for Magic City and its adjacent parking lot. Neither\n\nLA Security nor Magic City employed Officer Thompson or paid him to be there. In\n\nfact, Magic City never hired off-duty police officers for security, and Alford did not\n\n\n\n\n      2\n          Officer Thompson\u2019s first name also is spelled \u201cEmmanuel\u201d in the record.\n      3\n        Magic City is owned by MEP and operated by PEG, and the parking lot\nadjacent to the club is owned by a third party and leased to MEC.\n      4\n          Alford\u2019s first name also is spelled \u201cLatiesa\u201d in the record.\n\n                                            2\n\fknow Officer Thompson, who never has been an employee, agent, or independent\n\ncontractor of Magic City.\n\n      Favors also visited Magic City that night. While he was inside the club, another\n\nman (who had arrived with Favors\u2019s group) took some money from the stage and ran\n\nout of the club. Around that time, Favors\u2019s group began exiting the club.\n\n      Outside of the club, Favors got into an SUV with some other men. Also around\n\nthat time, Alford told Officer Thompson that one or two men had robbed a patron in\n\nthe club, and she gave Officer Thompson a description of the clothing worn by the\n\nsuspect or suspects. Officer Thompson then began looking for suspects in the parking\n\nlot. As the SUV in which Favors was a passenger started to exit the lot, Devin\n\nThompson (who worked for LA Security) told Officer Thompson that one or more\n\npersons in the vehicle were suspects in the theft. Devin Thompson and Officer\n\nThompson tried to stop the SUV, to no avail. Around that time, Officer Thompson\n\nactivated the blue lights on his patrol car, and Alford removed some traffic cones\n\nfrom in front of the patrol car to enable it to leave. According to Devin Thompson,\n\nAlford told Officer Thompson to move his patrol car to block the SUV\u2019s exit. Officer\n\nThompson did not move his car, and, as the SUV sped up and continued to move\n\nthrough the parking lot, the officer discharged his service firearm into the vehicle five\n\n                                           3\n\ftimes, striking Favors in the thigh and ankle. Officer Thompson later resigned from\n\nthe police force and, as a result of the shooting, pled guilty to simple assault.\n\n      Favors subsequently sued Officer Thompson, Alford, LA Security, and the\n\nMagic City Defendants for negligence, premises liability, and related claims arising\n\nout of the shooting. As relevant here, Favors sought to hold the Magic City\n\nDefendants liable for Officer Thompson\u2019s actions on the ground that Officer\n\nThompson acted as an agent of the Magic City Defendants when he shot Favors.\n\nFollowing discovery, the Magic City Defendants moved for summary judgment on\n\ngrounds that, as relevant to this appeal: (i) there is no evidence that they employed,\n\ncontracted with, controlled, or directed Officer Thompson at the time of the shooting;\n\n(ii) the shooting was not foreseeable; and (iii) Favors cannot show that any alleged\n\nacts of the Magic City Defendants proximately caused his injuries.\n\n      The trial court granted summary judgment to the Magic City Defendants on\n\nFavors\u2019s premises liability claim, but denied summary judgment on his remaining\n\nclaims for ordinary negligence; imputed liability; wrongful retention, supervision,\n\nhiring, entrustment, and training; punitive damages; and OCGA \u00a7 13-6-11 attorney\n\nfees. In pertinent part, the court concluded that disputed factual issues remain as to:\n\n(i) whether, at the time of the shooting, Officer Thompson was working in a \u201cdual\n\n                                           4\n\fagent capacity\u201d as a police officer and as an agent of the Magic City Defendants, in\n\nfurtherance of their business interests; and (ii) whether Alford and Devin Thompson,\n\nwhile acting as agents for the Magic City Defendants, acted reasonably during the\n\nevents leading up to the shooting. This interlocutory appeal followed.\n\n      We review de novo a grant or denial of summary judgment, viewing the\n\nevidence and all reasonable conclusions and inferences drawn from it in the light\n\nmost favorable to the nonmovants. City of St. Marys, 346 Ga. App. at 508-509.\n\nSummary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the\n\nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. at 508; see OCGA \u00a7 9-11-56 (c).\n\n\u201c[T]he burden on the moving party may be discharged by pointing out by reference\n\nto the affidavits, depositions and other documents in the record that there is an\n\nabsence of evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s case.\u201d Ellison v. Burger King\n\nCorp., 294 Ga. App. 814, 819 (3) (a) (670 SE2d 469) (2008) (citation and punctuation\n\nomitted); see OCGA \u00a7 9-11-56 (c).

(a) On appeal, the Magic City Defendants first challenge the denial of\n\nsummary judgment on Favors\u2019s claims for ordinary negligence and imputed liability.5\n\nIn those claims, Favors seeks to hold the Magic City Defendants liable for their own\n\nalleged negligence, as well as the alleged negligence of Alford and LA Security.6 The\n\nMagic City Defendants contend that, because Officer Thompson\u2019s decision to shoot\n\ninto the SUV was unforeseeable, Favors cannot establish that any acts attributable to\n\nthem proximately caused his injuries. We agree.\n\n      To state a cause of action for negligence in Georgia, \u201ca plaintiff must show four\n\nelements: a duty, a breach of that duty, causation and damages.\u201d Goldstein, Garber\n\n& Salama, LLC v.

App. 563, 565-566 (1) (743 SE2d 27) (2013). As to causation, \u201c[t]o recover\n\ndamages in a tort action, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant\u2019s negligence was\n\nboth the \u2018cause in fact\u2019 and the \u2018proximate cause\u2019 of the injury.\u201d Atlanta Obstetrics\n\n\n\n      5\n       We need not address this enumeration of error to the extent that it pertains to\nFavors\u2019s claim for premises liability, as the trial court granted summary judgment to\nthe Magic City Defendants on that claim.\n      6\n        Favors\u2019s claims that the Magic City Defendants also should be held liable for\nthe alleged negligence of Officer Thompson are addressed in Division 2, below.\n\n                                          6\n\f& Gynecology Group, P.A. v. Coleman, 260 Ga. 569, 569 (398 SE2d 16) (1990);\n\naccord Goldstein, Garber & Salama, 300 Ga. at 841 (1) (\u201c[T]o recover for any\n\ninjuries resulting from the breach of a duty, there must be evidence that the injuries\n\nwere proximately caused by the breach of the duty.\u201d); Brown v. All-Tech Investment\n\nGroup, 265 Ga. App. 889, 893 (1) (595 SE2d 517) (2004) (\u201c[S]ummary judgment is\n\nappropriate in negligence cases when, viewing all the facts and reasonable inferences\n\nfrom those facts in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, the evidence does not create\n\na triable issue on the question of proximate cause.\u201d).\n\n             Proximate cause is that which, in the natural and continuous\n      sequence, unbroken by other causes, produces an event, and without\n      which the event would not have occurred. In this regard, a negligent\n      actor who breaches a duty to another is not responsible for a\n      consequence which is merely possible, according to occasional\n      experience, but only for a consequence which is probable, according to\n      ordinary and usual experience. It is important to recognize that probable,\n      in the rule as to causation, does not mean \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d but\n      rather \u201cnot unlikely\u201d; or, more definitely, \u201csuch a chance of harm as\n      would induce a prudent man not to run the risk; such a chance of\n      harmful result that a prudent man would foresee an appreciable risk that\n      some harm would happen.\u201d\n\n             The requirement of proximate cause constitutes a limit on legal\n      liability; it is a policy decision that, for a variety of reasons, e.g.,\n\n                                           7\n\f      intervening act, the defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s injury are too\n      remote for the law to countenance recovery. The determination of\n      whether proximate cause exists requires both factfinding in the \u201cwhat\n      happened\u201d sense, and an evaluation of whether the facts measure up to\n      the legal standard set by precedent. And, while proximate cause is\n      ordinarily a jury question, it will be determined by the court as a matter\n      of law in plain and undisputed cases.\n\n             Where . . . a defendant claims that its negligence is not the\n      proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, but that an act of a third party\n      intervened to cause those injuries, the rule is that an intervening and\n      independent wrongful act of a third person producing the injury, and\n      without which it would not have occurred, should be treated as the\n      proximate cause, insulating and excluding the negligence of the\n      defendant. But, this rule does not insulate the defendant if the defendant\n      had reasonable grounds for apprehending that such wrongful act would\n      be committed. Stated differently, if the character of the intervening act\n      claimed to break the connection between the original wrongful act and\n      the subsequent injury was such that its probable or natural consequences\n      could reasonably have been anticipated, apprehended, or foreseen by the\n      original wrong-doer, the causal connection is not broken, and the\n      original wrong-doer is responsible for all of the consequences resulting\n      from the intervening act.\n\nJohnson v. Avis Rent a Car System, 311 Ga. 588, 592-593 (858 SE2d 23) (2021)\n\n(citations and punctuation omitted); see also Brown, 265 Ga.

App. at 893-894 (1).\n\n      7\n          Indeed, the trial court recognized as much when it agreed with Favors\u2019s\nconcession that the record does not support a finding that Officer Thompson\u2019s\ndecision to shoot into the SUV was foreseeable for purposes of Favors\u2019s premises\nliability claim. And Favors similarly characterizes the shooting as an \u201cunjustified use\nof force,\u201d \u201coutrageously aggressive,\u201d and \u201cunlawful.\u201d\n\n                                          9\n\fConsequently, the Magic City Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on\n\nFavors\u2019s claims for ordinary negligence and imputed liability to the extent those\n\nclaims are premised on the actions of the Magic City Defendants, Alford, or LA\n\nSecurity. See Johnson, 311 Ga. at 589-590, 594-597 (concluding that the defendants\n\n\u2014 a car rental company, its regional security manager, the operator of the rental\n\nlocation at issue, and the operator\u2019s owner \u2014 could not be liable under theories of\n\nnegligence and vicarious liability for injuries to the plaintiffs that occurred when a\n\ncompany employee stole a company car and, following a high-speed chase, crashed\n\ninto a wall on which the plaintiffs were sitting, because the evidence did not show\n\n\u201cthat a crash resulting in serious injuries would be the reasonably foreseeable\n\nconsequence of the [employee\u2019s] theft\u201d); Massachusetts Cotton Mills v. Hawkins, 164\n\nGa. 594, 598-599 (2) (139 SE 52) (1927) (holding that a corporation, the manager of\n\nwhich knowingly procured a void arrest warrant, could not be liable for the arresting\n\nofficer\u2019s subsequent act of killing the suspect because, while the act of procuring the\n\nwarrant \u201cwould naturally and ordinarily bring about the arrest\u201d of the suspect, it \u201cdid\n\nnot ordinarily and naturally produce the death of the deceased\u201d); Brown, 265 Ga.\n\nApp. at 889-890, 893 & 895-896 (1) (holding that the defendant day-trading firms\n\nwere entitled to summary judgment in an action brought by victims of a work-place\n\n                                          10\n\fmass shooting because there was no evidence that the shooting spree was a\n\nreasonably foreseeable outcome of the firms\u2019 actions).\n\n      (b) The trial court did not expressly address Favors\u2019s claims for wrongful\n\nretention, supervision, hiring, entrustment, and training (of Officer Thompson, LA\n\nSecurity, and Alford) in its order denying summary judgment. Nevertheless, our\n\nruling in Division 1 (a) \u2014 that Officer Thompson\u2019s decision to shoot into the vehicle\n\nin which Favors was a passenger was not foreseeable to the Magic City Defendants\n\n\u2014 necessarily defeats those claims, which ultimately seek redress for the same harm,\n\ni.e., the injuries suffered by Favors in the shooting. See, e.g., Allen v. Zion Baptist\n\nChurch, 328 Ga. App. 208, 213-214 (1) (b) (761 SE2d 605) (2014) (an employer may\n\nbe liable for a failure to exercise due care in hiring, retaining, or supervising an\n\nemployee only where \u201cit is reasonably foreseeable that the employee could cause the\n\ntype of harm sustained by the plaintiff\u201d) (citation and punctuation omitted); Gafford\n\nv. Duncan, 210 Ga. App. 350, 351 (436 SE2d 78) (1993) (physical precedent only)\n\n(\u201can independent, intervening criminal act of a third party, without which the injury\n\nwould not have occurred, will be treated as the proximate cause of the injury,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\fthereby defeating a claim for negligent entrustment).8 The Magic City Defendants\n\ntherefore are entitled to summary judgment on these claims, as well.\n\n      (c) The trial court also did not expressly address Favors\u2019s claim that Alford\u2019s,\n\nDevin Thompson\u2019s, and LA Security\u2019s \u201cnegligent undertaking to provide security\n\nwithin the parking lot on the night in question\u201d may subject the Magic City\n\nDefendants to liability. Pretermitting whether the trial court\u2019s grant of summary\n\njudgment on Favors\u2019s premises liability claim necessarily disposed of any potential\n\nclaim for negligent undertaking, any such claim also fails.\n\n      As is the case with the other negligence-based claims addressed above, our\n\nrulings on foreseeability and proximate cause also defeat Favors\u2019s attempts to hold\n\nthe Magic City Defendants liable via a theory of negligent undertaking, which again\n\nis premised solely on the injuries Favors suffered as a result of the shooting by\n\nOfficer Thompson. See, e.g., Brown, 265 Ga. App. at 898 (2) (a) (ii) (one who\n\n      8\n         Of course, these claims also fail insofar as they are directed at the alleged\nhiring, training, supervision, or retention of Officer Thompson for the additional\nreason that he was not an employee of \u2014 and thus had not been hired, trained,\nsupervised, or retained by \u2014 Alford, LA Security, or the Magic City Defendants. See\ngenerally Allen, 328 Ga. App. at 212-216 (1) (addressing claim for negligent hiring,\nretaining, and supervising). And because each of these claims fails on proximate\ncause/foreseeability, we need not address whether a claim for negligent entrustment\notherwise potentially could lie on the facts of this case if proximate cause were\nestablished.\n\n                                         12\n\fprovides security for a premises generally can be liable for negligent performance of\n\nthe undertaking \u201conly if the type of danger the injured person actually encountered\n\nwas foreseeable\u201d). The Magic City Defendants therefore are entitled to summary\n\njudgment on Favors\u2019s negligent undertaking claim.\n\n      2. In what appears to be an alternate theory of liability, Favors argued below,\n\nas he does on appeal, that the Magic City Defendants may be vicariously liable for\n\nOfficer Thompson\u2019s actions on the ground that the officer was acting in a \u201cdual\n\ncapacity\u201d as an agent of both the public and the Magic City Defendants at the time\n\nof the shooting. The trial court found that disputed issues of fact preclude summary\n\njudgment on this issue, and the Magic City Defendants challenge that ruling on\n\nappeal. Pretermitting whether our rulings in Division 1 dispose of any claims brought\n\nunder this theory of liability, it does not apply here.\n\n      The Supreme Court of Georgia has delineated the circumstances under which\n\na private entity may be liable for the actions of a law enforcement officer acting in a\n\n\u201cdual capacity\u201d as follows:\n\n      [A law enforcement officer] may occupy a dual position of exercising\n      functions for the public and the company; in which case, where he is in\n      the discharge of duties for the company, and the tort is committed under\n      such circumstances as not to justify it, the company is liable. But if he\n\n                                           13\n\f      commits a tort merely as a police officer, the company would not be\n      liable, unless it was done at the direction of the company. The mere fact\n      that a . . . company pays for the services of a certain police officer, who\n      does nothing but perform the duties of a police officer proper, does not\n      make the company liable.\n\n\nPounds v. Central of Ga. R. Co., 142 Ga. 415, 418 (83 SE 96) (1914); accord Ambling\n\nMgmt. Co. v. Miller, 295 Ga. 758, 762 (2) (764 SE2d 127) (2014). Under this rubric,\n\na private entity\u2019s liability for a law enforcement officer\u2019s tort is determined by the\n\nofficer\u2019s capacity at the moment the tort arose. Ambling Mgmt. Co., 295 Ga. at 763-\n\n765 (2).\n\n      Here, the tort arose when Officer Thompson, while on duty as a uniformed\n\npolice officer, discharged his service weapon into the SUV in which Favors was a\n\npassenger. It is undisputed that, at no point during the evening of the shooting, was\n\nOfficer Thompson employed or paid by the Magic City Defendants. Cf. Ambling\n\nMgmt. Co., 295 Ga. at 758-759, 759-760 (1), 765 (3) (finding a jury question as to\n\ndual capacity where an off-duty police officer was hired and paid by owners of the\n\ndefendant apartment complex). Moreover, Favors has pointed to no record evidence\n\nthat would support a finding that the Magic City Defendants had any authority to\n\ndirect Officer Thompson\u2019s actions or control the manner in which he performed his\n\n                                          14\n\fjob as an on-duty police officer. See Kent v. Southern R. Co., 52 Ga. App. 731, 731-\n\n736 (184 SE 638) (1936) (a railway conductor\u2019s act of ordering the chief of police to\n\nshoot a man blocking a train track did not render the railway liable for the police\n\nchief\u2019s subsequent act of shooting the man because the railway had no authority to\n\ndirect the actions of the police chief, who \u201cwas under an independent duty of his own,\n\nby virtue of his office, to take action in the premises\u201d); compare Massachusetts\n\nCotton Mills, 164 Ga. at 597-598 (1) (the defendant manufacturing company was not\n\nliable for acts committed during an arrest effected by a law enforcement officer\n\nemployed to provide security for the company, because, when making the arrest, the\n\nofficer was acting under the authority of an arrest warrant and not under the\n\ncompany\u2019s authority), and Touchton v. Bramble, 284 Ga. App. 164, 165-166 (1) (a)\n\n(643 SE2d 541) (2007) (an amusement park could not be liable for an arrest effected\n\nby a law enforcement officer paid by the park, because the park had no control over\n\nlaw enforcement decisions made by officers who worked at the park); with Exposition\n\nCotton Mills v. Sanders, 143 Ga. 593, 595-596 (85 SE 747) (1915) (a company could\n\nbe liable for torts committed by a \u201cspecial officer of the law\u201d employed by the\n\ncompany and authorized by the company to make arrests on its property). And Favors\n\nlikewise has pointed to nothing in the record suggesting that anyone associated with\n\n                                         15\n\fthe Magic City Defendants asked, directed, or encouraged Officer Thompson to shoot\n\nthe SUV.9 Officer Thompson, on the other hand, testified that no one associated with\n\nthe Magic City Defendants asked him to fire his weapon or use violent force that\n\nevening.\n\n      Under these circumstances, at the moment that Officer Thompson shot at the\n\nSUV, he was acting solely as a police officer and not as an agent of the Magic City\n\nDefendants. See Massachusetts Cotton Mills, 164 Ga. at 597-598 (1); Pounds, 142\n\nGa. at 418; Touchton, 284 Ga. App. at 165-166 (1) (a); Kent, 52 Ga. App. at 731-736;\n\ncompare Hyatt Corp. v. Cook, 242 Ga. App. 542, 542-545 (529 SE2d 633) (2000)\n\n(concluding that a hotel chain could not be liable for the actions of an off-duty police\n\n      9\n         Both before the trial court and on appeal, Favors repeatedly has made\nnumerous conclusory assertions to the effect that \u201cOfficer Thompson\u2019s actions were\ndirected, condoned, and encouraged by [the Magic City] Defendants\u201d; Officer\nThompson \u201cshot into the white SUV at the direction and encouragement of Magic\nCity\u2019s security staff\u201d (capitalization omitted); the Magic City Defendants \u201cdirected,\nparticipated, instigated and procured [Officer] Thompson\u2019s unlawful seizure\u201d of\nFavors; at the time of the shooting, Officer Thompson \u201cwas merely acting on the\nwords or direction of the [Magic City] Defendants\u201d; the Magic City Defendants\u2019\nsecurity personnel \u201cdirected Officer Thompson to apprehend the suspected thief\u201d; and\nAlford \u201cgave Officer Thompson direction and prompted his actions.\u201d He does not,\nhowever, identify any record evidence indicating that the decision to shoot the SUV\noriginated from anyone other than Officer Thompson. Notwithstanding Favors\u2019s\nbroad claims to the contrary, no reasonable fact-finder could interpret any of the\nactions taken by Alford or Devin Thompson as an instruction to Officer Thompson\nto shoot the SUV, as we implicitly concluded in Division 1 (a), above.\n\n                                          16\n\fofficer, who the chain had hired for security, when the officer arrested an unruly hotel\n\nbar patron after hotel staff asked the officer for assistance when several patrons\n\nignored an announcement that the bar was closing); with American Multi-Cinema v.\n\nWalker, 270 Ga. App. 314, 314-316 (1) & (1) (a) (605 SE2d 850) (2004) (concluding\n\nthat the evidence would authorize a jury to find that an off-duty deputy sheriff\n\nworking as a security guard for a movie theater chain confronted the plaintiff to\n\nenforce the chain\u2019s loitering policy, rather than to perform a police duty). The Magic\n\nCity Defendants therefore are entitled to summary judgment under this theory of\n\nliability, as well.\n\n       3. In its order denying summary judgment, the trial court declined to address\n\nwhether, at the time of the shooting, Officer Thompson \u201cwas an agent of [the]\n\nDefendants in a more traditional sense.\u201d The Magic City Defendants contend that\n\nthere is no evidence from which a jury could find that Officer Thompson was their\n\nagent. We agree.\n\n       The parties have not cited (either before the trial court or on appeal), and\n\nresearch has not revealed, any binding precedent under which an on-duty, uniformed\n\nlaw enforcement officer may be deemed an agent of a private party or entity outside\n\nof the \u201cdual agency\u201d rubric discussed above in Division 2. Consequently, to the\n\n                                          17\n\fextent that Favors\u2019s complaint may be read to assert a claim against the Magic City\n\nDefendants for the actions of Officer Thompson under \u201ctraditional\u201d agency\n\nprinciples, the Magic City Defendants likewise are entitled to summary judgment.\n\n      4. In their motion for summary judgment, the Magic City Defendants argued\n\nthat statements made by Magic City and/or LA Security personnel for the purpose of\n\nreporting a crime to Officer Thompson are subject to a qualified or conditional\n\nprivilege that shields them from liability in this case. See generally OCGA \u00a7 51-5-7\n\n(1)-(2); Examination Mgmt. Svcs. v. Steed, 340 Ga. App. 51, 53-55 (1) (794 SE2d\n\n678) (2016) (a conditional privilege defense to tort liability may be available to one\n\nwho \u201cacted in good faith, had an interest to uphold . . . , gave a statement properly\n\nlimited in its scope and upon a proper occasion, and [made publication] to proper\n\npersons\u201d). The trial court concluded that a disputed factual issue remains as to\n\nwhether the statements made by Magic City security personnel to Officer Thompson\n\nwere properly limited in scope or instead \u201cexceeded the mere reporting of a crime and\n\nescalated into the security personnel directing Officer Thompson how to apprehend\n\nthe alleged thief.\u201d The Magic City Defendants challenge this ruling on appeal.\n\n      Our ruling in Division 1 renders this issue moot. Because Officer Thompson\u2019s\n\ndecision to shoot into a moving vehicle was not a foreseeable result of either\n\n                                         18\n\freporting a robbery inside Magic City or identifying the vehicle in which the suspect\n\nin the theft was believed to be traveling, it matters not whether statements to that\n\neffect made by Magic City security personnel are subject to a qualified or conditional\n\nprivilege, pretermitting whether that doctrine otherwise might apply here.\n\n      5. The Magic City Defendants also challenge the denial of summary judgment\n\non Favors\u2019s claim for punitive damages under OCGA \u00a7 51-12-5.1. Because, as stated\n\nabove, the Magic City Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on each of the\n\nprimary claims against them, Favors plainly is not entitled to punitive damages, and\n\nthe Magic City Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this claim, as well.\n\nSee Ratliff v. McDonald, 326 Ga. App. 306, 314 (2) (b) (756 SE2d 569) (2014) (\u201cA\n\nclaim for punitive damages is derivative in nature and will not lie in the absence of\n\na finding of compensatory damages on an underlying claim.\u201d) (citation and\n\npunctuation omitted).\n\n      6. Although not addressed by either party on appeal, our rulings above also\n\nnecessarily entitle the Magic City Defendants to summary judgment on Favors\u2019s\n\nclaim for attorney fees under OCGA \u00a7 13-6-11. See United Cos. Lending Corp. v.\n\nPeacock, 267 Ga. 145, 147 (2) (475 SE2d 601) (1996) (\u201cA prerequisite to any award\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\fof attorney fees under OCGA \u00a7 13-6-11 is the award of damages or other relief on the\n\nunderlying claim[s].\u201d).\n\n      Judgment reversed.
