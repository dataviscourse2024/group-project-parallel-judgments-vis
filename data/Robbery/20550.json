Because the\r\nelement of entry for both of these offenses is functionally equivalent, I respectfully disagree\r\nwith the majority opinion's analysis, the consequence of which is that, absent unrealistic\r\nmanipulation of pleadings by the State, criminal trespass, as a matter of law, will never be\r\na lesser-included offense of burglary.  Unlike the majority opinion, I would hold that criminal\r\ntrespass, as a matter of law, is a lesser-included offense of burglary under the pleadings in\r\nthe indictment in this case.  See Hall v. State, 225 S.W.3d 524, 535 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007)\r\n(\"The first step in the lesser-included-offense analysis, determining whether an offense is a\r\nlesser-included offense of the alleged offense, is a question of law.\"). (1)  I, however, agree\r\nwith the Court's ultimate holding that the trial court did not err by denying the request for a\r\nlesser-included-offense instruction on trespass because, as a matter of fact, there was no\r\nevidence to show that Mark Meru, appellee, was guilty only of trespass.  See id. at 536\r\n(second step in lesser-included-offense analysis requires that facts in record establish lesser\r\noffense as a valid, rational alternative to greater offense).  I, therefore, respectfully concur\r\nin the Court's judgment in this case. \r\n\r\nI. Analysis of the First Step for Lesser-Included-Offense Instructions  \r\n\r\n\tIn its brief, the State \"concedes that some cases and the Practice Commentary to the\r\n1974 Penal Code do suggest that trespass is generally a lesser[-]included offense to\r\nburglary.\"  Within the past two years, this Court has reaffirmed that, as a matter of law based\r\non a comparison of the elements of the two offenses, criminal trespass can be a lesser-included offense of burglary.  See Goad v. State, 354 S.W.3d 443, 446 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n2011) (\"The offense of criminal trespass is established by proof of the facts of burglary of\r\na habitation as Goad was charged, less proof of the specific intent to commit theft.\"). \r\nTrespass has historically been viewed as differing from burglary only in the respect that\r\nburglary includes the additional element of specific intent to commit a felony, theft or assault,\r\nor an attempt or commission of a felony, theft or assault.  See id.  Both offenses require proof\r\nthat a defendant entered property of another without effective consent.  Compare Tex. Penal\r\nCode Ann. \u00a7 30.02(a)(1), (3) (person commits offense of burglary if he \"enters\" a habitation\r\nor building \"without the effective consent of the owner\"), with id. \u00a7 30.05(a) (person\r\ncommits offense of criminal trespass if he \"enters or remains\" on or in property of another\r\nwithout effective consent).\r\n\r\n\tI would hold, as this Court has for decades, that criminal trespass can be a lesser-included offense of burglary under an indictment that generally pleads entry without further\r\nrequiring the State to plead that term's definition because the element of entry for trespass\r\nis functionally equivalent to that element for burglary.  See Aguilar v. State, 682 S.W.2d 556,\r\n558 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985) (\"Criminal trespass can be a lesser included offense of burglary\r\nof a building.\"); Day v. State, 532 S.W.2d 302, 306 (Tex. Crim. App. 1976), overruled in\r\npart by Hall, 225 S.W.3d at 537.  This Court in Hall approved the \"functional-equivalence\r\nconcept\" as a valid component of the step-one lesser-included-offense analysis.  McKithan\r\nv. State, 324 S.W.3d 582, 587-88 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).  This Court's precedent permits\r\nan instruction on a lesser-included offense when, although the elements of the lesser offense\r\ndiffer from those of the greater offense, they are functionally equivalent.  Id. at 588.  For this\r\ntest, the \"relevant inquiry is not what the evidence may show but what the State is required\r\nto prove to establish the charged offense.\"  Id. at 593.  The functional equivalence test is\r\n\"synonymous with the concepts of 'necessary inclusion' or 'subsumption of elements.'\" Id.\r\nat 588 n.15 (quoting Evans v. State, 299 S.W.3d 138, 143 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009)); see Hall,\r\n225 S.W.3d at 535 (stating that \"the elements of the lesser offense do not have to be pleaded\r\n[in the indictment] if they can be deduced from the facts alleged in the indictment\").\r\n\r\n\tIn applying the \"functional-equivalence\" concept to the offenses of burglary and\r\ntrespass, this Court has previously held that a burglary indictment's failure to plead that a\r\ndefendant had notice that entry into a habitation was forbidden did not preclude him from\r\nbeing entitled to a lesser-included-offense instruction on criminal trespass.  Day, 532 S.W.2d\r\nat 306 (holding that \"the offense of criminal trespass is a lesser[-]included offense of all three\r\ntypes of burglary,\" and stating generally that \"the elements of criminal trespass, including\r\n'notice,' could be established by proof of the same facts necessary to prove the offense of\r\nburglary\").  In Day, this Court explained that, even though criminal trespass contains an\r\nadditional element, notice, which is not contained in the offense of burglary, the notice\r\nrequirement \"would be satisfied by proof of entry into the building\" because notice can be\r\nestablished by fencing or other enclosure obviously designed to exclude intruders.  Id.  More\r\nthan thirty years later, this Court held in Salazar v. State that the notice element of trespass\r\ncould be deduced from the elements of burglary of a habitation because a habitation, by its\r\nnature, inherently gives notice that entry without consent is forbidden.  284 S.W.3d 874, 877-78 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009).  In analyzing whether trespass could be a lesser-included offense\r\nof burglary, this Court did not suggest in either Day or Salazar that the entry element of these\r\ntwo offenses would not overlap under an indictment that generally pleaded entry into a\r\nhabitation or building.  See Day, 532 S.W.2d at 306; Salazar, 284 S.W.3d 877-78. (2)\r\n\r\n\tThe majority opinion focuses on the different definitions for \"entry\" as the basis for\r\nconcluding that, under the indictment in this case, trespass is not a lesser-included offense\r\nof burglary because the indictment did not more particularly narrow entry to a complete\r\nentry.  The term \"entry\" is defined differently for the offense of trespass, which requires\r\n\"intrusion of the entire body,\" as opposed to the definition of that term for the offense of\r\nburglary, which requires intrusion of \"any part of the body\" or \"any physical object\r\nconnected with the body.\" Compare Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02(b) (burglary), with id.\r\n\u00a7 30.05(b)(1) (trespass).  Though entry has a slightly different definition in the two offenses,\r\nthe elements in the two statutes are functionally equivalent by targeting a person's\r\nunauthorized entry onto property.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 30.02(a); 30.05(a).\r\n\r\n\tSuggesting that the State can manipulate its burglary pleadings to allege that a\r\ndefendant entered a habitation by intrusion of the entire body, the majority opinion presents\r\na Trojan horse in an attempt to persuade us that it is really not abdicating Texas's historical\r\nunderstanding that criminal trespass can be a lesser-included offense of burglary.  Here, the\r\nindictment alleged that appellee \"did then and there, with intent to commit theft, enter a\r\nhabitation, without the effective consent\" of its owner, the complainant.  If, however, the\r\nindictment had additionally alleged that the entry was with the defendant's whole body, then,\r\naccording to the majority opinion, criminal trespass could be a lesser-included offense, if the\r\nevidence adduced at trial established criminal trespass as a valid, rational alternative to the\r\ncharged offense.  The concurring opinion goes so far as to suggest that maybe a defendant\r\ncould file a motion to quash to require the State's indictment to more particularly allege\r\nwhether it intended to prove entry of a body part or of the whole person.\r\n\r\n\t\"When a statutory term or element is defined by statute, the charging instrument does\r\nnot need to allege the definition of the term or element.\"  State v. Barbernell, 257 S.W.3d\r\n248,  251 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008).  If, however, \"the prohibited conduct is statutorily defined\r\nto include more than one manner or means of commission, the State must, upon timely\r\nrequest, allege the particular manner or means it seeks to establish.\"  Id. (quoting Saathoff\r\nv. State, 891 S.W.2d 264, 266 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994)).  This Court, for example, held in\r\nBarbernell that a trial court should not quash a DWI information charging a defendant with\r\ndriving while intoxicated due to the State's failure to allege the definition of \"intoxicated\"\r\nthat it intended to prove at trial because the definitions of \"intoxicated\" are evidentiary.   Id.\r\nat 256.  Under this Court's reasoning in Barbernell, the State would not be required to more\r\nnarrowly plead the term \"entry\" because that term is statutorily defined and any more narrow\r\nfocus of the term would be purely evidentiary.  See id.  It is true that the State may always\r\nincrease its burden of proof, if it chooses, by more narrowly pleading the terms in the\r\nindictment, but a defendant would not be able to succeed in any motion to quash based on\r\na claim that the State's pleading was inadequate for failing to define entry to conform to the\r\nevidence the State intended to introduce at trial.  See id.; Curry v. State, 30 S.W.3d 394, 398\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2000) (stating that \"[a]n indictment is generally sufficient to provide notice\r\nif it follows the statutory language,\" and State \"need not plead evidentiary matters\").\r\n\r\n\tAnd, so, it is time to welcome the Trojan horse. It is true that, after this Court's\r\ndecision today, there may be a prosecutor somewhere in Texas who decides that he wants to\r\nelevate his burden of proof by more particularly pleading the element of entry in a burglary\r\ncase so that he and the defendant will have the option of getting a lesser-included offense\r\ninstruction on criminal trespass.  But I seriously doubt that this will be the situation in most\r\ncases, and, in examining the implications of a particular holding from a policy perspective,\r\ncourts should focus on the common, usual situation rather than on the extreme or bizarre one. \r\nThe reality is that the State will continue to plead burglary cases by tracking the elements in\r\nthe Texas Penal Code, just as it always has, and just as it did in this case.  And, therefore,\r\nbased on those pleadings, this Court's decision will have the actual consequence that criminal\r\ntrespass will no longer be a lesser-included offense of burglary in virtually all cases.\r\n\r\n\tIn light of this Court's historical understanding that criminal trespass is the\r\nfunctionally equivalent lesser-included offense of burglary, I conclude that, under the\r\nindictment in this case that generally pleads entry without further defining that term, criminal\r\ntrespass is, as a matter of law, a lesser-included offense of burglary.   I would hold, therefore,\r\nthat appellee established the first step for demonstrating his entitlement to a lesser-included-offense instruction.  See Hall, 225 S.W.3d at 535.\r\n\r\nII.  Analysis of the Second Step for Lesser-Included-Offense Instructions\r\n\r\n\tI agree with this Court's judgment that the trial court did not err by denying appellee's\r\nrequest for a lesser-included-offense instruction on criminal trespass because appellee has\r\nfailed to show that there is any evidence that would support the second required step for\r\nobtaining that instruction.  See Hall, 225 S.W.3d at 535 (describing second step as inquiring\r\nas to \"whether there is some evidence adduced at trial to support such an instruction\").  No\r\nevidence in this case shows that criminal trespass is a valid, rational alternative to burglary,\r\nas a matter of fact.  The complainant heard a \"thud\" at his door and then went to his front\r\ndoor, where he saw that its molding had been broken by someone pushing or kicking in the\r\ndoor.  The complainant then saw appellee walking from his door and approached appellee. \r\nAppellee told the complainant that he had tried to scare someone away who had been on the\r\ncomplainant's patio.  Although this evidence supports a partial entry of appellee's body, it\r\nfails to establish that appellee intruded with his entire body, which is required to establish the\r\noffense of trespass.  See Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 30.05(b)(1).  Appellee has failed to\r\nestablish that trespass, under the evidence presented in this case, is a \"valid, rational\r\nalternative\" to burglary.  Hall, 225 S.W.3d at 536.  The trial court, therefore, properly\r\ndeclined to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of trespass.\r\n\r\n    III.  Conclusion\r\n\r\n\tThis case has serious implications for both the State and defendants in all future\r\nburglary cases.  Although historically considered to be two peas in a pod, after today, trespass\r\nis no longer a lesser-included offense of burglary under an indictment that generally pleads\r\nthe element of entry.  This decision turns the two peas into pea soup, a dense fog that will\r\nobscure the law for judges who must determine whether the State has manipulated pleadings\r\nin an indictment to conform to the anticipated evidence in the case.  Because the majority\r\nopinion is contrary to the historical understanding that trespass is the functionally equivalent\r\nlesser-included offense of burglary, I respectfully concur in the Court's judgment.\r\n\r\nFiled: November 27, 2013\r\n\r\nPublish.\r\n1. \tThe first step must be capable of being performed before trial by comparing the elements of\r\nthe offense as they are alleged in the indictment or information with the elements of the potential\r\nlesser-included offense.  See Hall v. State, 225 S.W.3d 524, 535-36 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).  It does\r\nnot depend on the evidence to be produced at trial.  See id. at 535.  In Hall, this Court adopted the\r\ncognate-pleadings approach for this first step: \"the elements and the facts alleged in the charging\r\ninstrument are used to find lesser-included offenses.\"  Rice v. State, 333 S.W.3d 140, 144 (Tex.\r\nCrim. App. 2011) (quoting Hall, 225 S.W.3d at 535).  The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure\r\nprovides that an offense is a lesser-included offense if\r\n\r\n\r\n\t(1) it is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the\r\ncommission of the offense charged;\r\n\r\n\t(2) it differs from the offense charged only in the respect that a less serious injury or\r\nrisk of injury to the same person, property, or public interest suffices to establish its\r\ncommission;\r\n\r\n\t(3) it differs from the offense charged only in the respect that a less culpable mental\r\nstate suffices to establish its commission; or\r\n\r\n\t(4) it consists of an attempt to commit the offense charged or an otherwise included\r\noffense.\r\n\r\n\r\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 37.09.\r\n2. \tThis Court has applied the functional-equivalence test to offenses other than trespass and\r\nburglary.  For example, even though manslaughter does not include the elements required for\r\nestablishing murder, that a defendant act \"with intent to cause serious bodily injury to an individual\"\r\nand \"commit an act clearly dangerous to human life,\" this Court held that the lesser offense of\r\nmanslaughter was functionally equivalent to the greater offense of murder because the \"commission\r\nof an act clearly dangerous to human life, shooting with a firearm, is the circumstance surrounding\r\nthe conduct, which would be the same under either murder or manslaughter.\"  Cavazos v. State, 382\r\nS.W.3d 377, 384 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012).  Furthermore, as another example of functional\r\nequivalence, this Court has held that indecency with a child by contact was a lesser-included offense\r\nof aggravated sexual assault of a child even though it contained an element, intent, that was not\r\nfound in the greater offense.  See Evans v. State, 299 S.W.3d 138, 142-43 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009)\r\n(holding that indecency with a child by contact is lesser-included offense of aggravated sexual\r\nassault of a child because, even though the latter offense did not include intent as an express element,\r\nlascivious intent was implicitly included).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
