HASLAM v. THE STATE.\n\n      In Case No. A17A0226, a jury convicted Devon Haslam of one count of\nrobbery by force, and in Case No. A17A0228, the jury convicted Haslam of one count\nof robbery by force and one count of battery. The trial court entered judgment and\nsentence on these convictions. Although Haslam filed an appeal in each case, he has\nfailed to enumerate any error relating to these convictions or their resulting sentences.\nThe Supreme Court of Georgia has made it clear that failure to enumerate any error\nby the trial court requires dismissal of an appeal.

App. 723, 726 (781\nSE2d 597) (2016).
