The jury found true an allegation that\nMoore used a knife in the commission of the crimes. On appeal,\nMoore contends the trial court was required to instruct the jury\non theft as a lesser offense of robbery, because he \u201cabandoned\u201d\nthe items he had stolen from the grocery store before he produced\na knife and waved it at store employees who had asked him to\ngive back the merchandise. We disagree and therefore affirm\nMoore\u2019s conviction.\n         FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n1.     Moore takes items from a grocery store then waves\n       a knife at store employees\n       On November 4, 2018, around 4:30 p.m., Timothy Thomas\nwas working as a security guard at the Superior Warehouse in\nLong Beach. Thomas was standing outside the front of the store.\nA store employee told Thomas a customer was shoplifting.\nThomas notified the manager, Saul Rodriguez, then \u201cengaged\nthe customer\u201d\u2014later identified as Moore\u2014and asked him if he\nhad \u201ca receipt or \u2018How can I help you?\u2019 \u201d\n       Moore told Thomas \u201cthe merchandise he had was his.\u201d\nThen Moore said, \u201c[L]eave me the fuck alone.\u201d In the meantime,\nRodriguez came outside. He asked Thomas if he\u2019d seen anyone\n\u201cwalking out with stuff.\u201d Thomas pointed out Moore, who was\nstanding at the bicycle rack. Moore was wearing a \u201creally big\u201d\njacket and Rodriguez \u201cnoticed that he had something.\u201d Thomas\ncould see a six-pack of beer in Moore\u2019s jacket.\n       Rodriguez told Moore, \u201c \u2018Hey, just give me what you have.\u2019 \u201d\nMoore was \u201ckind of like aggressive\u201d; it seemed he just \u201cwant[ed]\nto go.\u201d When Moore \u201ctried to grab his bicycle,\u201d \u201call the things\nthat he had in his body started falling down.\u201d Moore started\nwalking toward the sidewalk on Long Beach Boulevard, then\n\u201cjust pulled out a knife\u201d from his right jacket pocket. Moore\n\n\n\n                                 2\n\fextended his arm and moved the knife back and forth from side\nto side. Items\u2014including raw meat and rotisserie chicken\u2014\nwere dropping from Moore\u2019s jacket.\n       Thomas told Rodriguez to call the police and Rodriguez did.\nRodriguez\u2019s 911 call was played for the jury at trial. Rodriguez\ntold the dispatcher, \u201c[W]e have stopped a guy and he has a knife\nand he was attacking us.\u201d\n       Thomas thought Moore was going to \u201cget his bike and\nleave\u201d but Moore started walking toward Thomas. Moore \u201cpulled\nout his knife a second time.\u201d In the 911 call, Rodriguez told\nthe dispatcher, \u201c[H]e\u2019s coming back with the knife. Look! He\u2019s\ncoming back.\u201d Rodriguez then said, \u201cHey! Hey! Watch out man!\u201d\nand \u201cHey! Stop!\u201d\n       Moore got on his bike and began to ride it. Thomas\n\u201cgrabbed [Moore] from behind.\u201d Thomas was able to get the knife\nand \u201ctoss[ ] [it] to the side.\u201d Rodriguez put his foot on the knife.\nSurveillance footage from a store camera\u2014shown to the jury at\ntrial\u2014recorded the next four minutes or so. We have watched\nthe footage.\n       Moore enters the screen from the bottom left-hand corner,\nriding his bike. Thomas grabs him from behind. Items fly from\nMoore and land on the pavement. One item appears to be full of\nliquid: it breaks and clear liquid runs down the pavement toward\nthe parking lot. (This is likely one of the three bottles of Ketel\nOne vodka that officers later found in Moore\u2019s possession. Moore\nis seen minutes later picking up a broken glass bottle off the\nground.)\n       Moore and Thomas struggle on the pavement. Another\nman arrives and tries to help Thomas. After about two minutes\nof struggle, Moore stands up. Thomas is off to the right side\nof the screen. Moore picks a few items up from the pavement,\ntakes his bicycle, then leaves the bicycle and walks away.\n\n\n\n                                 3\n\f       Thomas never was able to handcuff Moore. After the\nscuffle, Moore made off with the handcuffs. Thomas sustained\na cut to his right hand from the broken bottle during the\naltercation with Moore.\n       Long Beach Police Officer Juan Ortiz was called to the\narea. Ortiz saw Moore sitting on a bus bench. A passerby\nflagged Ortiz down and told him \u201cthe guy [who] ran from security\nat the Superior\u201d was \u201csitting right over there.\u201d Moore matched\nthe description Ortiz had been given of the robbery suspect.\nMoore made eye contact with Ortiz, immediately got up, started\nwalking away at a fast pace, and ran up an alley and then around\na corner. Eventually Ortiz was able to \u201cdetain\u201d Moore. Both\nRodriguez and Thomas identified Moore in a field show-up.\n       Officers found cooked chicken \u201calong\u201d the main entrance to\nthe store and raw chicken lying on the nearby sidewalk. In a bag\nMoore was carrying, Ortiz found two bottles of Ketel One vodka,\na third vodka bottle that was broken and empty, frozen French\nfries, candy, and cookies. Officers took the items back to the\nstore. Rodriguez identified some of them as merchandise from\nhis store.\n       At trial, the prosecutor introduced photographs of pieces\nof raw meat and of a knife lying on the pavement.\n       Jurors were shown video surveillance from cameras inside\nthe store. We have watched the footage. The video\u2014totaling\njust over four minutes\u2014is not one continuous recording but\neight clips from different areas and aisles of the store.\n       In the first clip, a man enters the store wearing a zippered\njacket, zipped about halfway up, and carrying two bags, a dark\nblue bag and what appears to be a white plastic grocery bag. At\ntrial, Moore admitted that man was him. The second clip is of\nthe meat aisle. Moore puts both bags down, picks up a package\nfrom the open refrigerated case, and uses his left hand to open\n\n\n\n                                4\n\fhis jacket. He places the package inside his jacket with his right\nhand, then adjusts his jacket as he walks toward the camera.\n       In the third clip, Moore opens the door of a refrigerated\ncase and takes out what appears to be a half gallon of milk\nin a plastic container. In the fourth clip, Moore walks toward\nthe camera, still holding the milk, then leans forward and puts\nthe milk container into his jacket on the left side by reaching\nin from the top with his right hand.\n       In the fifth clip, Moore picks up a red rectangular item. He\nwalks toward the camera, then steps to his right. A large poster\nor display obscures the camera\u2019s view of him. When he emerges\nfrom behind the poster, there is no sign of the red item. Moore\nadjusts his now-bulging jacket.\n       In the sixth clip, Moore stops and puts both bags down.\nHe adjusts his jacket, pulling the bottom of it over a large bulge\nin his stomach area, especially to the left side.\n       In the seventh clip, Moore walks between cashiers\u2019 stations,\nbypassing them, walking toward the camera. In the eighth clip,\nMoore leaves the store.\n2.     The charges, trial, verdicts, and sentence\n       The People charged Moore with two counts of second\ndegree robbery, alleging Moore took property from Thomas\nand Rodriguez. As to both counts, the People alleged Moore\npersonally used a deadly and dangerous weapon: a knife.\nBefore the preliminary hearing, Moore made a motion under\nFaretta v. California (1975) 422 U.S. 806 to represent himself.\nThe court granted the motion. After Moore was held to answer,\nhe successfully renewed his Faretta motion at arraignment in\nthe superior court.\n       The case went to trial in May 2019. Moore testified on his\nown behalf. The court permitted Moore to testify in a narrative.\n\n\n\n\n                                5\n\f       Moore told the jury he had bought candy, cookies, potatoes,\nand socks from the 99 cent store that day. Moore then stopped\nat the Superior Warehouse to buy steaks. Moore testified, \u201cWhen\nI went through some aisles, I guess I picked something up. When\nI picked something up, my intention was not to walk out of that\nstore with those items. Something got me sidetracked. But I\ndid because my hands were so full, I put the stuff on me.\u201d Moore\nhad not picked up a shopping cart when he entered the store.\n       Moore left the store. When he got to his bike\u2014which was\neither 60 yards or 120 feet from the exit1\u2014Thomas approached\nhim and asked him if he had a receipt. Moore said Thomas\n\u201cimmediately tried to snatch my property and me.\u201d Moore told\nthe jury he called Thomas \u201ca fag.\u201d Moore testified he planned\nto ride away on his bike but a car almost hit him. Moore said\nThomas knocked him off his bike. Moore claimed he suffered\na broken hand. Moore testified his bike was damaged and\nso he \u201climped away.\u201d He said 10 or 15 police cars arrived\nand he \u201cthought I was going to lose my life right there.\u201d\n       On cross-examination, Moore admitted he is the man seen\nin the in-store surveillance video and that he had put something\nfrom the meat section as well as a container of milk in his jacket.\nMoore said he didn\u2019t recall what the meat item was. When the\nprosecutor pointed out in the video \u201ca very large bulge on the left\nside of [Moore\u2019s] jacket\u201d and asked \u201cwhat items are creating that\nbulge?,\u201d Moore responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n       Moore admitted the video shows him walking past the cash\nregisters and leaving the store. Then he stated he paid for \u201csome\ncookies\u201d and \u201cone pack of meat.\u201d When asked if he had paid for\n\n\n\n\n1     Moore gave both distances in his testimony.\n\n\n\n                                 6\n\fthe milk he had put in his jacket, he answered, \u201cI didn\u2019t have\nno milk.\u201d Moore claimed his receipt was in the white bag.\n       Moore testified that no items ever fell from his jacket.\nMoore denied ever having pulled out a knife.\n       Before opening statements, the court gave both the\nprosecutor and Moore copies of proposed jury instructions.\nThe court encouraged Moore to read the proposed instructions,\nand offered to loan him copies of the CALJIC instruction books.\nThe court told Moore he \u201cmight want to look up the term, \u2018lesser-\nincluded offense.\u2019 \u201d The court explained that, \u201ccontained within\nrobbery, there is theft.\u201d The court told Moore, \u201cThere are only\ncertain times that I can give that theft instruction when you\nhave been charged with robbery. And right now, I don\u2019t know\nif that applies. I won\u2019t know until I listen.\u201d\n       The court continued, \u201cNothing that I know about right now,\nthough, would cause me to give it. But if you\u2019re going to develop\nthat, you\u2019re going to somehow want that instruction, then you\nneed to be familiar with it and make sure you ask the right\nquestions so that I can give you that instruction that you\u2019re\nentitled to.\u201d Moore said he understood and had no questions\nabout what the court had just said.\n       Four days later, the court asked Moore if he had \u201cany\nissues\u201d with the jury instructions. He said he did not.\n       The court instructed the jury with CALJIC Nos. 9.40\n(Robbery), 9.40.2 (Robbery\u2014After Acquired Intent), 9.40.3 (Store\nEmployee as Victim of Robbery), 9.41 (Robbery\u2014Fear\u2014Defined),\nand 9.43 (Second Degree Robbery as a Matter of Law). The court\ndid not instruct on theft as a lesser included offense.\n       In his closing argument, Moore told the jury he had a knife\nin his pocket and it fell out of his pocket when he \u201cgot struck from\nbehind.\u201d Moore stated, \u201cYou cannot prove a knife was struck or\nused against Timothy Thomas or Saul Rodriguez.\u201d Moore said\n\n\n\n                                 7\n\fThomas and Rodriguez \u201cfalsified the police report, they falsified\na printed receipt, and they falsified evidence.\u201d\n       The jury convicted Moore on both counts and found the\nweapon allegation true as to both. The court sentenced Moore\nto seven years and four months in the state prison. The court\nchose the upper term of five years on one of the robbery counts\nplus one year as one-third the midterm on the second count,\nplus one year plus four months (one-third the midterm) for\nthe weapon enhancements.\n                            DISCUSSION\n       Penal Code section 211 defines robbery as the felonious\ntaking of personal property in the possession of another, from his\nperson or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished\nby means of force or fear. (People v. Gomez (2008) 43 Cal.4th 249,\n254 (Gomez).) Robbery is, therefore, a species of aggravated\nlarceny. (Ibid.)\n       Robbery \u201cincludes two phases: acquiring the property,\nand carrying it away (in the parlance of legalese: caption and\nasportation).\u201d (People v. Robins (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 413, 418\n(Robins).) In California, robbery is a continuing offense that\nbegins from the time of the original taking and lasts until the\nrobber reaches a place of relative safety. (People v. Anderson\n(2011) 51 Cal.4th 989, 994.)\n       The type of robbery at issue here is an Estes robbery,\nnamed for People v. Estes (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 23 (Estes).\n\u201cWhat sets an Estes robbery apart from a standard robbery\nis that the force or fear is used not in the acquisition of the\nproperty, but in the escape.\u201d (Robins, supra, 44 Cal.App.5th\nat p. 419.) \u201cThe typical case starts with a shoplifting and turns\ninto a robbery when the thief is confronted by a [loss prevention\nofficer], and the thief assaults the [officer] in an attempt to get\naway.\u201d (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n                                8\n\f       The facts in Estes were nearly identical to ours. There, a\nstore security guard saw Estes take clothing from a rack, put it\non, and leave the store without paying. The guard followed Estes\noutside and confronted him. Estes refused to return to the store\nand began walking away. When the guard tried to detain him,\nEstes pulled out a knife and swung it at the guard. (Estes, supra,\n147 Cal.App.3d at p. 26; see also Gomez, supra, 43 Cal.4th at\np. 258.) The court of appeal held Estes\u2019s use of force to prevent\nthe guard from retaking the property and to facilitate his escape\nwas sufficient to support his conviction for robbery. (Gomez,\nat p. 258.)\n       Moore does not dispute this governing law. Instead\u2014\nhaving testified under oath at trial that no items ever fell from\nhis jacket during his interaction with Rodriguez and Thomas\u2014\nhe now contends that any and all items he stole from the store\nhad fallen out of his jacket before he pulled out his knife and\npointed it at the store employees. Moore asserts he had \u201cdropped\nand abandoned the items he had unlawfully taken\u201d from the\nstore before he \u201cmenac[ed] [Rodriguez and Thomas] with his\nknife.\u201d Accordingly, Moore argues, the trial court was required\nsua sponte to instruct the jury on theft as a lesser included\noffense of robbery.\n       A trial court must\u2014even in the absence of a request\u2014\ninstruct the jury on all general principles of law relevant to\nthe issues raised by the evidence. (People v. Breverman (1998)\n19 Cal.4th 142, 154.) The general principles of law governing\nthe case are those principles closely and openly connected with\nthe facts before the court, and that are necessary for the jury\u2019s\nunderstanding of the case. (People v. St. Martin (1970) 1 Cal.3d\n524, 531.) However, the court is required to give a particular\ninstruction sua sponte only if there is substantial evidence\nfrom which a jury composed of reasonable people could find\n\n\n\n                                9\n\ftrue the facts underlying the instruction. (Breverman, at p. 162.)\nA sua sponte duty to instruct does not arise from the existence\nof any evidence, no matter how weak. (Ibid.)\n      The determination whether sufficient evidence supports\nan instruction must be made without reference to the credibility\nof that evidence. (People v. Salas (2006) 37 Cal.4th 967, 982.)\nDoubt as to the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant a particular\ninstruction should be resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor. (People\nv. Tufunga (1999) 21 Cal.4th 935, 944.) However, the court need\nnot give instructions based solely on conjecture and speculation.\n(People v. Day (1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 932, 936.)\n      Moore contends the evidence showed he took only meat\nfrom the store, and he dropped it \u201cbefore confronting the\nemployees with a knife.\u201d The record does not support that\ncontention.\n      The in-store surveillance video shows Moore taking a\npackage from the meat case and a container of milk from the\nrefrigerator.2 The video is a collection of clips; there was no\ntestimony that the footage contains everywhere Moore went\nand everything he did within the store. For example, rotisserie\nchicken was found on the sidewalk but the video doesn\u2019t show\nMoore taking chicken inside the store.\n\n\n\n\n2      Moore says in his brief he \u201cput the milk . . . back before\nleaving the store\u201d but the page he cites from the reporter\u2019s\ntranscript doesn\u2019t say that. The prosecutor asked Moore,\n\u201cDid you pay for the milk?\u201d Moore responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t have\nno milk.\u201d The prosecutor began, \u201cThe carton of milk that we\nsaw you grab and put into your jacket\u2014.\u201d Moore interrupted,\n\u201cI did not have\u2014.\u201d The prosecutor continued, \u201cDid you purchase\nthe milk?\u201d Moore answered, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                10\n\f       Moreover, by the time Moore left the store, his jacket had\na very large bulge\u2014much larger than one package of meat and\na half gallon of milk would cause. While showing Moore the\nvideo on cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Moore\u2014just\nafter the \u201cred package\u201d clip\u2014\u201chow many items do you have in\nyour jacket at that point?\u201d Moore responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nHe did not say \u201ctwo,\u201d or \u201cone.\u201d\n       The surveillance video of the area just outside the exit\ndoes not contain Moore\u2019s interaction with Rodriguez and Thomas\nbefore Moore got on his bicycle to leave. There is no video of\nMoore\u2019s display of the knife, which happened before Moore\ngot on the bike. There is no video that shows what items fell\nfrom Moore\u2019s jacket or when they fell in the sequence of events.\nRodriguez testified items had fallen from Moore\u2019s jacket before\nhe pulled out the knife the first time, but the second time\nMoore displayed the knife was after items had fallen.\n       Thomas testified he saw \u201csome beer bottles\u201d in Moore\u2019s\njacket when he first encountered him outside the store. When\nThomas grabbed Moore, after Moore had twice displayed the\nknife, things fell and at least one glass container broke on the\nground. When apprehended a short time later, Moore had two\nunopened bottles of vodka in his bag as well as a broken vodka\nbottle. On appeal, Moore asserts he had purchased that alcohol\nelsewhere. But Moore never testified to that at trial, even though\ngiven ample opportunity to tell his story in narrative form.\n       Moore testified he had bought candy, cookies, potatoes, and\nsocks at the 99 cent store. He made no mention of buying vodka,\nthere or anywhere else. The jury reasonably could assume that\n\n\n\n\n                               11\n\fthe dollar store does not sell Ketel One vodka for 99 cents.3 Nor\nwas Moore\u2019s testimony on this point consistent. He first said\nthree bottles of alcohol were in his blue bag. Then he testified\n\u201call of the glass\u201d was in the white bag and he was \u201claying in\nthe liquor\u201d from the white bag after Thomas grabbed him.\n       Moreover, as the Attorney General notes, Moore did\nnot voluntarily relinquish or \u201cabandon[ ]\u201d whatever items fell\nfrom his jacket in any event. The meat, chicken, and bottle\nof vodka fell despite Moore\u2019s efforts to keep possession of them.\n(See People v. Torres (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1073, 1077, 1079,\ndisapproved on other grounds in People v. Mosby (2004) 33\nCal.4th 353, 365, fn. 3 [no duty to instruct on theft as lesser\nto robbery where defendant, while holding radio he\u2019d removed\nfrom victim\u2019s car, swung screwdriver at victim\u2019s companion;\neven though defendant then placed radio on victim\u2019s car seat,\nhe had used screwdriver to keep possession of victim\u2019s property];\ncf. People v. Pham (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 61, 64, 67-68 [no duty\nto instruct on attempted robbery where victim chased defendant\nto stop his escape and defendant dropped victim\u2019s property and\nslugged victim in the head; defendant had not \u201ctruly abandoned\u201d\nvictim\u2019s property before using force].)\n       Moore relies on People v. Hodges (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th\n531. That case does not assist him. Hodges involved a trial\ncourt\u2019s response to a jury question. Hodges had shoplifted some\nitems from a grocery store. Security guards followed him to his\ncar and demanded he come back inside. Hodges offered to give\nthe merchandise back. The guards refused the offer, insisting\nHodges return to the store. Hodges threw the items at a guard,\n\n\n3     Indeed, an exhibit Moore himself introduced shows the\ntwo bottles of Ketel One vodka found in his possession when\nOrtiz detained him rang up at $34.98 and $19.99 respectively.\n\n\n                               12\n\fhitting him in the face or chest. As Hodges then tried to drive\naway, a guard reached into his car in an attempt to grab his keys\nand was dragged some distance. (Hodges, at pp. 535-536.) The\nappellate court held the trial court had erred in its response to\na jury question about the sequence of these events because the\nevidence was susceptible to a conclusion that Hodges\u2019s theft of\nthe merchandise ceased after he no longer had the intent to keep\nthe store\u2019s property. (Id. at pp. 538, 543.) Here, by contrast,\nthere is no evidence Moore sought to return or relinquish the\nitems he\u2019d stolen, before he waved his knife at the employees\nor\u2014for that matter\u2014at any time.\n       In sum, there was no substantial evidence that Moore\u2019s\nintent to keep and carry away the Superior Warehouse\u2019s property\never ceased or that he intentionally dropped or abandoned the\nstolen items. The trial court had no obligation to instruct on\ntheft as a lesser offense to robbery.\n                           DISPOSITION\n       We affirm Kennith Moore\u2019s judgment of conviction.\n\n     NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTS\n\n\n\n\n                                    EGERTON, J.\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n\n                  EDMON, P.J.
