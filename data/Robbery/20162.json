Penal\r\nCode Ann. \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) (West 1989), the jury assessed punishment at seventy years'\r\nconfinement.  In a single point of error, appellant asserts that the court erred in admitting into\r\nevidence at the punishment phase of the trial extraneous, unadjudicated offense, and their details\r\nover timely objection.  We will reverse the trial court's judgment and remand for a new hearing\r\non punishment.\r\n\r\n\tAppellant's point of error raises the issue of whether the 1989 amendment to Tex.\r\nCode Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, \u00a7 3(a) (West Supp. 1993) permits evidence of extraneous\r\noffenses other than final convictions at the punishment stage of the trial in noncapital offenses. (1)\r\n\r\n\tThe pertinent portion of art. 37.07, \u00a7 (3)(a), amended effective September 1, 1989,\r\nprovides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tRegardless of the plea and whether the punishment be assessed by the judge or the\r\njury, evidence may, as permitted by the Rules of Evidence, be offered by the state\r\nand the defendant as to any matter the court deems relevant to sentencing,\r\nincluding the prior criminal record of the defendant, his general reputation and his\r\ncharacter.  The term prior criminal record means a final conviction in a court of\r\nrecord, or a probated or suspended sentence that has occurred prior to trial, or any\r\nfinal conviction material to the offense charged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis reflects portion added by amendment).\r\n\r\n\tOver the appellant's objection, the court admitted evidence at the punishment phase\r\nof the trial of an aggravated robbery in which the complaining witness identified the appellant as\r\nthe person who robbed her.  It is undisputed that this is an extraneous unadjudicated offense that\r\noccurred three days prior to the instant offense.\r\n\r\n\tThe Court of Criminal Appeals, in Grunsfield v. State, No. 1037-91 (Tex. Crim.\r\nApp., October 28, 1992), affirming Grunsfield v. State, 813 S.W.2d 158 (Tex. App.--Dallas\r\n1991), held that evidence of extraneous unadjudicated offenses was improperly admitted during\r\nthe punishment phase of a noncapital case.  The court, in construing art. 37.07, \u00a7 (3)(a), reasoned\r\nthat in giving \"meaning to the provision as a whole,\" evidence of extraneous unadjudicated\r\noffenses does not come within, \"the court's historical construction of the term prior criminal\r\nrecord.\"  The court remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with\r\nTex. Code. Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.29(b) (West Supp. 1993). (2)\r\n\r\n\tThe State urges that appellant failed to preserve error for review by not obtaining\r\nan adverse ruling to his objection.  In Cook v. State, 741 S.W.2d 928, 939 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n1987), the only response defense counsel received from the court to his objection to the\r\nprosecutor's argument was, \"Counsel stay within the record, please.\"  The court held that in order\r\nto preserve error for review a defendant must pursue his objection until an adverse ruling is\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n\tPrior to the beginning of the punishment phase of the trial, in a hearing out of the\r\npresence of the jury, the prosecutor made it known that the State intended to introduce evidence\r\nof an extraneous aggravated robbery offense.  Defense counsel objected \"to the introduction of\r\nany extraneous offense . . . he certainly hasn't been convicted . . . it doesn't fall under the\r\nexception of prior criminal record.\"  The court stated that it felt it would be helpful to hear the\r\nevidence surrounding the extraneous offense before making a ruling.  Out of the presence of the\r\njury, Pam Arwood identified appellant as the person who robbed her at gunpoint at her video store\r\non October 19, 1989.  At the conclusion of Arwood's testimony, defense counsel again voiced the\r\nobjection that an unadjudicated extraneous offense is not admissible at the punishment phase of\r\nthe trial.  The court responded that it would \"allow the evidence in.\"  When Arwood was called\r\nin the presence of the jury, defense counsel again objected to evidence of extraneous offenses and\r\nthe court overruled the objection.  At the conclusion of Arwood's testimony, appellant's motion\r\nthat all the testimony \"from this witness be stricken from the record\" was overruled by the court. \r\nUnlike Cook, we find that appellant received adverse rulings from the court on his objections.\r\n\r\n\tAfter the Grunsfield court determined that unadjudicated extraneous offenses were\r\nnot admissible at the punishment phase of the trial, the court stated that it became necessary to\r\ndetermine whether the error requires remand to the trial court for a new hearing on punishment\r\nunder Tex. R. App. P. 81(b)(2).  Rule 81(b)(2) provides that an appellate court will reverse the\r\njudgment under review \"unless the appellate court determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the\r\nerror made no contribution to the conviction or to the punishment.\"  The only prior offense for\r\nwhich appellant was shown to have been convicted was misdemeanor possession of marihuana. \r\nWe are unable to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court's error in allowing the\r\njury to hear testimony about the unadjudicated offense of aggravated robbery made no contribution\r\nto the punishment assessed.  We sustain appellant's point of error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWe reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings\r\npursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.29(b) (West Supp. 1993).\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t                                                               \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTom G. Davis, Justice\r\n\r\n[Before Justices Jones, B. A.
