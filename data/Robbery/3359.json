            "opinion_text": "\nPOOLER, Circuit Judge:\nOn March 26, 2014, defendant-appellant Miguel Jesurum pleaded guilty to a two-count indictment charging him and three codefendants with wire fraud conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343 and 1349 and aggravated identity theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(c). At sentencing, as is relevant here, the district court applied a six-level enhancement pursuant to 2014 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(C) because the offense involved 250 or more victims and, following a Fatico hearing, applied a four-level enhancement pursuant to 2014 *669U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) because the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. Because the district court appropriately applied those enhancements, we reject Jesurum\u2019s argument that the orally pronounced sentence was procedurally unreasonable, and affirm. We remand for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to amend the written judgment to conform it to the oral sentence.\nBACKGROUND\nI. The Criminal Scheme\nOn June 20, 2012, Jesurum and three codefendants were charged by grand jury with a two count indictment.\" Count 1 charged Jesurum and his codefendants with wire fraud conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343 and 1349; Count 2 charged \"them with aggravated identity theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(c). On March 26, 2014, Jesurum pleaded guilty without a plea agreement.\nThe basis for Jesurum\u2019s conviction was his participation in a large-scale cell phone cloning scheme, defrauding Sprint and Sprint customers. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) described the scheme as follows. Sprint, a cell phone provider, uses telephone towers to allow its customers to place calls. Sprint recognizes cell phones by two unique identifiers that are programmed into every cell phone that cap access the Sprint network: a Mobile Station ID (\u201cMSID\u201d) and an Electronic Serial Number (\u201cESN\u201d). When a customer tries to place a call using the Sprint network, the cell phone tower will look for the MSID and ESN and will only place the call if the Sprint network recognizes-the MSID and ESN as belonging to a Sprint customer. Sprint tracks its customers\u2019 cell phone use -by their MSID and ESN numbers and bills its customers based on their use of the network.\nIn a cell phone cloning fraud, such as this one, the perpetrator of the fraud steals or fraudulently obtains the necessary information \u2014 here, a Sprint customer\u2019s MSID and ESN \u2014 to place calls on the network. He then programs a different phone with the Sprint customer\u2019s MSID and ESN, so that calls made from the cloned phone appear to Sprint to be coming from the customer\u2019s phone, and the Sprint customer is billed for the call. Je-surum and his coconspirators obtained and used MSIDs and ESNs from tens of thousands of Sprint customers\u2019 accounts. Je-surum and his coconspirators got access to the MSIDs and ESNs illicitly by, among other means, purchasing these identifiers from nine Sprint employees who had access to .the Sprint database. \u25a0 Jesurum profited from the scheme by selling the capacity to route calls over the Sprint network via the cloned phones at rates well below the market rates charged by Sprint. As is relevant on appeal, Jesurum does not contend that he used MSIDs and EDNs from fewer than 250 Sprint customers. Rather, he contends that the evidence shows only that one person or entity\u2014 Sprint \u2014 suffered any financial harm.\nAt the plea hearing, Jesurum admitted to conspiring with others to use the \u201cceil phone identifiers of various providers\u2019 customers without the authorization to make unauthorized calls.\u201d App\u2019x at 44. He admitted that the plan was carried, out in part over interstate email and telephone. As. to. the identity theft charge, Jesurum stated that, between 2009 and 2012, \u201cin order to carry out this wire;fraud crime, [he] used with unlawful - authority the unique cellular identifiers of telephone service providers\u2019 customers without authorization -to do so.\u201d, App\u2019x at 45. He stated *670that he was aware that at least some of the identifiers belonged to real people.\nII. Sentencing\nJesurum was sentenced On November 21, 2014. At sentencing, as is relevant here, the district court applied a six-level enhancement pursuant to 2014 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(C) because the offense involved 250 or more victims and, following a Fatico hearing, applied a four-level enhancement pursuant to 2014 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) because the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five \u00f3r more participants or was otherwise extensive. Based on the district court\u2019s calculation, the Guidelines range for Count 1 was 151 to 188 months, and the term for Count 2 was the term required by statute \u2014 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, to run consecutively to Count 1. The district court imposed a total sentence of 96 months\u2019 incarceration: 72 months for Count 1, to be followed by a consecutive 24 months for Count 2. The district court stated that the jail time \u201cwill be followed by two years of supervised release on Count 1 and 1 year of supervised release on Count 2, to be served concurrently.\u201d App\u2019x at 242. However, the written judgment states that the defendant will serve a supervised release term of \u201c3 years on count 1 and 1 year on count 2, to run concurrently.\u201d App\u2019x at 252.\nDISCUSSION\nI. Procedural Unreasonableness Challenge\nJesurum challenges his sentence as procedurally unreasonable'. We review a sentence for procedural reasonableness under a \u201cdeferential -abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court fails to calculate (or improperly. calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines range, treats the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain the chosen sentence.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Aldeen, 792 F.3d 247, 251 (2d Cir.2015) (quoting United States v. Chu, 714 F.3d 742, 746 (2d Cir.2013)).\nThe PSR recommended applying a six-level enhancement under 2014 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(C), which was applicable at the time of Jesurum\u2019s sentencing, and which provided for such an enhancement if the offense \u201cinvolved 250 or more victims.\u201d Two application notes are relevant to the determination of who. is a victim under this provision. First, Application Note 1 states that \u201c \u2018[vjictim\u2019 means (A) any person who sustained any part of the actual loss determined under subsection (b)(1) [i.e., the loss calculation]; or (B) any individual who sustained bodily injury as a result of the offense.\u201d 2014 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 1. Second, Application Note 4(E) states that \u201c[f]or purposes of subsection (b)(2), in a case involving means of identification^] \u2018victim\u2019 means (i) any victim as defined in Application Note 1; or (ii) any individual whose means of identification was used unlawfully or without authority.\u201d 2014 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 4(E).\nJesurum focuses on Application Note 1, and argues that because there was no evidence of any financial harm to Sprint customers whose cell phone identifiers were used, the only victim of the scheme was Sprint itself and the six-level enhancement was therefore inappropriate. But the cases on which Jesurum relies dealt with offenses governed by versions ' of the Guidelines that were applicable before the \u25a0definition .of victim was amended to include \u201cany individual whose means of- identifica*671tion was used unlawfully or without authority.\u201d\nJesurum primarily relies on United States v. Abiodun, 536 F.3d 162 (2d Cir.2008), where we held that the district court erred in counting victims whose loss amounts were not included in the loss Calculation, because \u201cvictim\u201d was defined solely as \u201cany person who sustained any part of the actual loss determined under subsection (b)(1).\u201d Id. at 169. This reasoning is simply not relevant because the definition of \u201cvictim\u201d ' was expanded in 2009, partly in response to Abiodun, to include \u201cany individual whose means of identification was used unlawfully or without authority.\u201d Indeed, the reason given by the Sentencing Commission for the amendment was to \u201cexpand[ ] ... the definition of victim.\u201d U.S.S.G. app. C., Yol. Ill, amend. 726, at 309. The Commission explained:\n[T]he amendment amends the Commentary to \u00a7 2B1.1 to provide that, for purposes of the victims table in subsection (b)(2), an individual whose means of identification was used unlawfully or without authority , is considered a \u201cvictim.\u201d ... An identity theft case may involve an individual whose means of identification was taken and used but who was fully reimbursed by a third party (e.g., a bank or credit card company). Some courts have held that such an individual is not counted as a \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of the victims table at \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2).' See ... United States v. Abiodun, 536 F.3d 162 (2d Cir.2008).... The Commission determined that such an individual should be considered a \u201cvictim\u201d for- purposes of subsection (b)(2) because such an individual, even if fully reimbursed, must often spend significant time resolving credit problems and related issues, and such lost time may not be adequately accounted for in the loss calculations under the guidelines. .\nId. at 309-10.\nHere, the district court' did not err in holding that the offense involved 250 or more victims because the evidence demonstrated that more than 250 Sprint customers\u2019 means of identification, here MSIDs and ESNs, were used without authority. Pursuant to Application Note 4, victim includes \u201cany individual whose means of identification was used unlawfully or ' without authority.\u201d 2014 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 4(E). \u201cMeans of identification\u201d \u201chas the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7), except that such means of identification shall be of an actual (i.e., not fictitious) individual.\u201d 2014 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 1. Section 1028(d)(7) of Title 18 defines \u201cmeans of identification,\u201d in pertinent part, as \u201cany name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual, including any ... telecommunication identifying information or access device (as defined in section 1029(e)).\u201d Finally, Section 1029(e) defines \u201caccess device\u201d as including an \u201celectronic serial number [or] mobile identification number ... or other means of account access that can be used, alone or in conjunction with another access device, to obtain money, goods, services, or any other thing of value.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(1).\nNo one disputes that MSIDs and ESNs are \u201cmeans of identification\u201d under Application Note 4. The district court therefore correctly counted as victims Sprint customers whose MSIDs and/or ESNs were taken and used, regardless of whether the customers suffered any financial loss. See United States v. Harris, 791 F.3d 772, 780 (7th Cir.2015) (\u201c[T]he district- court correctly counted as victims individuals whose *672identification was used without authority, in addition to those who suffered actual monetaiy loss.\u201d); United States v. Maxwell, 778 F.3d 719, 734 (8th Cir.) (\u201c[The defendant] ... argues the district court erred in determining that the number of fraud victims should include more than three hundred identity theft victims because the number of victims should be limited to entities that incurred financial loss. We agree with the district court that the number of victims properly includes persons whose identities were used unlawfully\u201d), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2827, 192 L.Ed.2d 864 (2015); cf. United States v. Finley, 600 Fed.Appx. 964, 968-69 (6th Cir.) (rejecting the same argument pressed by Jesurum), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1726, 191 L.Ed.2d 694 (2015); United States v. Adeife, 606 Fed.Appx. 580, 581 (11th Cir.2015) (same); United States v. Melchor, 580 Fed.Appx. 173, 174-75 (4th Cir.2014) (same); United States v. Kismat, 570 Fed.Appx. 155, 160-61 (3d Cir.2014) (same).\nJesurum next argues that the 2015 amendments to the Guidelines provide support for his conclusion that counting the Sprint customers as victims was erroneous. Jesurum contends that he would not have received a six-level enhancement under the amended Guidelines, which were promulgated on April 15, 2015 and went into effect on November 1, 2015, well after Jesurum\u2019s November 21, 2014 sentencing. He therefore argues that it would be manifestly unjust not to apply the amendment retroactively.\nUnder our case law, we are \u201crequired to apply [post-sentence] amendments to the Guidelines that clarify their application on direct review.\u201d United States v. Kirkham, 195 F.3d 126, 131 (2d Cir.1999); see also, e.g., United States v. Lewis, 93 F.3d 1075, 1080 (2d Cir.1996). However, we may not, in the first instance, apply post-sentence amendments that embody \u201ca substantive change\u201d to the Guidelines. United States v. Kim, 193 F.3d 567, 578 (2d Cir.1999). Such amendments may initially be applied retroactively only by a district court. See United States v. Colon, 961 F.2d 41, 45-46 (2d Cir.1992). We therefore must assess whether the amendment Jesurum invokes clarified the application of 2014 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(C) or substantively altered that provision.\nSection 2Bl.l(b)(2) of the 2014 Guidelines provided:\n(Apply the greatest) If the offense\u2014\n(A)(i) involved 10 or more victims; or (ii) was committed through mass marketing, increase by 2 levels;\n(B) involved 50 or more victims, increase by 4 levels; or\n(C) involved 250 or more victims, increase by 6 levels.\n2014 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2). Following the promulgation of the relevant amendment, Amendment 792, the 2015 Guidelines now provide:\n(Apply the greatest) If the offense\u2014\n(A)(i) involved 10 or more victims;\n(ii) was committed through mass-marketing; or\n(iii) resulted in substantial financial hardship to one or more victims, increase by 2 levels;\n(B) resulted in substantial financial hardship to five or more victims, increase by 4 levels; or\n(C) resulted in substantial financial hardship to 25 or more victims, increase by 6 levels.\n2015 U.S.S.G \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2). The definition of \u201cvictim\u201d remains the same. See 2015 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. nn. 1, 4(E). It is readily apparent that Amendment 792 effects a substantive change to the Guidelines and does not merely clarify the *673Guidelines\u2019 application on direct review. Therefore, we may not apply it when assessing whether the district court erred in its application of the 2014 Guidelines. See Kim, 193 F.3d at 578. Jesurum must instead direct any request for relief under Amendment 792 to the district court in the first instance. See Colon, 961 F.2d at 45-46.\nJesurum also challenges the \u2018 district court\u2019s application of a four-level enhancement pursuant to Section 3Bl.l(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines, which provides for such an enhancement if \u201cthe defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d The district court\u2019s factual finding that Jesu-rum was ah organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive was noi clearly erroneous, United States v. Paccione, 202 F.3d 622, 624 (2d Cir.2000), but rather had sufficient support in the evidence' introduced at the F\u00e1tico hearing, and the district court therefore did not err in applying this enhancement.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reject Jesurum\u2019s challenge to his sentence as procedurally unreasonable, and affirm the orally pronounced sentence.\nII. Variance Between Oral and Written Sentence\nAt the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that Jesurum\u2019s term of imprisonment \u201cwill be followed by two years of supervised release on Count 1 and 1 year of supervised release on Count 2, to be served concurrently.\u201d .App\u2019x at 242. However, the written judgment states that Jesurum will serve a supervised release term of \u201c3 years on count 1 and 1 year on count 2, to run concurrently.\u201d App\u2019x at 252. Because the oral pronouncement controls, see United States v. Rosario, 386 F.3d 166, 168 (2d Cir.2004), the Government consented either to modification of the judgment by this Court or to a remand to the district court to fix this error. We therefore remand so that the district court may, in accordance, with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36, \u201camend the written judgment so that it conforms with the oral sentence pronounced by the court.\u201d United States v. Werber, 51 F.3d 342, 347 (2d Cir.1995); see Fed,R.Crim.P. 36 (\u201cAfter giving any'notice it considers appropriate, th\u00e9 court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment; order, or oth-\u00e9r part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d). '\nCONCLUSION\nWe have considered the remainder of Jesurum\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the sentence imposed orally by the district court hereby is AFFIRMED. We REMAND to the district court for the limited purpose of amending the judgment to conform to the'oral sentence.'\n",
