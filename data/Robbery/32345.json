The district attorney elected to try Alanson first: the court sustained his right to do so, and the defendant excepted. On the trial the defendant proposed to examine his co-defendant, Carrington, as a witness in his behalf; the court excluded the witness and the defendant excepted. The defendant was convicted and sentenced, and the sentence confirmed by the Supreme Court.\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court.\n(S. C., 1 Park. 371.)\n",
