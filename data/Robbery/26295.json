So viewed, the evidence is as\n\nfollows.\n\n            A. THE SHOOTING AND INITIAL IDENTIFICATION OF COLLINS\n\n       Around 11:00 a.m. on February 5, 2016, David Johnson saw Collins at a convenience\n\nstore in downtown Richmond. Johnson knew Collins from \u201cthe street.\u201d Collins offered to give\n\nJohnson a ride to a nearby barbershop, and Johnson accepted the offer. Johnson bought heroin\n\nfrom Collins in a parking lot near the barbershop. During the transaction, Collins saw that\n\nJohnson possessed a substantial amount of money.\n\n       Collins followed Johnson through the parking lot after the heroin transaction. At some\n\npoint, Collins pointed a pistol at Johnson and told him to \u201ckick the money.\u201d Collins then shot\n\nJohnson in both of his legs. Johnson refused to give his money to Collins. Collins shot Johnson\n\nin the buttocks as he was running toward an alley. Collins also fired a shot at Johnson\u2019s torso,\n\nbut the bullet got caught in Johnson\u2019s jacket and did not actually hit him. As he was running,\n\nJohnson\u2019s leg buckled and he fell to the ground. After Johnson fell, Collins shot him again in the\n\nright leg. He then demanded Johnson\u2019s money and hit him in the face with the pistol. When\n\nJohnson cried for help, Collins ran to his car and drove away from the area.\n\n       Police officers and emergency medical personnel promptly arrived at the scene of the\n\nshooting in response to a 9-1-1 call. Johnson initially told the police officers that he did not\n\nknow who shot him. After he was transported to the hospital, however, Johnson told the police\n\nthat someone named \u201cTee\u201d shot him with a \u201cpink and black .380\u201d caliber pistol. Johnson also\n\nprovided a detailed physical description of his assailant, and told the police that the shooter was\n\nwearing an \u201cArmy fatigue jacket.\u201d Based on Johnson\u2019s description, the police identified Collins\n\nas a suspect. Johnson subsequently identified Collins as the shooter from a photo lineup.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f       The police obtained warrants for Collins\u2019s arrest, and he was taken into custody five days\n\nafter the shooting. Collins denied any involvement in the shooting. He told the police that he\n\ndid not know Johnson or own any firearms. Collins had two cell phones with him when he was\n\ntaken into custody. He was also wearing a camouflage jacket.\n\n       B. THE SEARCH OF THE CELL PHONE AND THE MOTION TO SUPPRESS\n\n       Detective Mark Godwin, the lead investigator in the present case, applied for two search\n\nwarrants pertaining to Collins\u2019s cell phones. Godwin initially requested a warrant allowing him\n\nto search the personal property held by the jail in which Collins was an inmate and seize the cell\n\nphones that he possessed when he came into police custody. Godwin submitted this request to a\n\nmagistrate in Prince George County, the jurisdiction where the jail was located.\n\n       In the affidavit supporting the warrant, Godwin described the shooting and explained\n\nhow Collins was identified as a suspect. The affidavit also noted that Collins had cell phones in\n\nhis possession when he was taken into custody. The affidavit then stated:\n\n               Based on your affiant\u2019s training and experience investigating\n               weapons offenses, as well as violent crimes, your affiant knows\n               that offenders communicate with cellular devices by means of\n               phone conversations, text messages, email, and social media\n               applications. Your affiant has investigated numerous violent\n               criminal cases in which cell records, to include call detail lists,\n               contact lists, text message content were instrumental in\n               understanding how a violent crime occurred and who was\n               involved. Therefore, . . . your affiant requests a search warrant be\n               issued to further this investigation.\n\n       Additionally, the affidavit discussed Godwin\u2019s law enforcement training and experience.\n\nThe affidavit stated that Godwin had been a police officer for nine years and that he was\n\ncurrently an aggravated assault detective. The affidavit also explained that Godwin had\n\ninvestigated numerous crimes involving violence.\n\n       The magistrate issued the requested warrant. Pursuant to the warrant, Godwin searched\n\nCollins\u2019s personal property and seized two cell phones. Godwin then applied for an additional\n                                               -3-\n\fwarrant allowing him to search the contents of one of the cell phones. As the search of the cell\n\nphone was to be conducted within the City of Richmond, Godwin submitted his request for the\n\nsecond warrant to a circuit court judge sitting in that jurisdiction. Godwin submitted an almost\n\nidentical affidavit to support the second warrant. Notably, the affidavit contained the statement\n\nregarding the role of cell phones in violent crimes previously quoted in this opinion. After\n\nreviewing the affidavit, a circuit court judge issued the requested warrant.\n\n              The police found several images on the cell phone when they executed the search\n\nwarrant. One of the images showed a hand holding a pink and black Ruger .380 caliber pistol.\n\nAnother image showed Collins. Both images were created within eleven minutes of each other\n\non December 8, 2015, approximately two months before the shooting.\n\n              Collins filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the cell phone. Collins\n\nargued that the warrant authorizing the search of the cell phone was not supported by probable\n\ncause. Specifically, Collins maintained that the affidavit supporting the warrant failed to\n\nestablish any factual connection between the charged offenses and the cell phone or any reason\n\nto believe that evidence pertaining to the shooting would be found on the cell phone. In addition,\n\nCollins contended that the warrant was overbroad because it allowed the police to search all of\n\nthe data on the cell phone.\n\n              Following a hearing on Collins\u2019s motion to suppress, the circuit court determined that\n\n\u201cthe affidavit for the search warrant, and the search warrant itself[,] lacked sufficient\n\nparticularity and were facially overbroad.\u201d1 Nevertheless, the circuit court concluded that the\n\nevidence obtained from the search of the cell phone was admissible under the good faith\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n              1\n         As the Commonwealth did not challenge this ruling, the only issue before us is whether\nthe circuit court erred in determining that the evidence was admissible under the good faith\nexception. Therefore, we decline to address whether the circuit court correctly concluded that\nthe underlying affidavit failed to establish probable cause to support the search warrant at issue.\nSee Adams v. Commonwealth, 48 Va. App. 737, 745 n.5, 635 S.E.2d 20, 24 n.5 (2006).\n                                                 -4-\n\fexception set forth in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984). The circuit court\n\nacknowledged that the law regarding cell phone searches was in a \u201cstate of uncertainty and flux.\u201d\n\nThe circuit court also noted that a circuit court judge issued the warrant authorizing the search.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the circuit court concluded that the police reasonably relied on the\n\nsearch warrant in good faith and denied Collins\u2019s motion to suppress.\n\n                                  C. COLLINS\u2019S JURY TRIAL\n\n       Johnson testified about the events of the shooting at Collins\u2019s trial. He unequivocally\n\nidentified Collins as his assailant, and testified that Collins shot him with a \u201cpink and black .380\u201d\n\ncaliber pistol. He also testified that Collins drove a small blue four-door car with \u201cdonut tires\u201d\n\non the day of the shooting and that Collins was wearing an \u201cArmy fatigue jacket\u201d on that day.\n\nJohnson explained that he did not identify Collins as his assailant at the scene of the shooting\n\nbecause a crowd of people had gathered around him and he feared further bodily harm if he\n\nidentified Collins as the shooter in public.\n\n       Raymond Fleming, a Dominion Power employee working nearby on the day of the\n\nshooting, also testified at Collins\u2019s trial. Fleming testified that he heard five gunshots coming\n\nfrom the area where the shooting occurred. Fleming testified that he saw a man matching\n\nCollins\u2019s general description \u201cwalking away really fast\u201d from the area where the gunshots were\n\nfired. Fleming explained that the man \u201ckept looking back to his left over his shoulder.\u201d Fleming\n\ntestified that the man was wearing an \u201cold school . . . Army camo\u201d jacket and that he drove away\n\nfrom the area in a small blue four-door car with a \u201cdonut\u201d tire.\n\n       Eugene Provost, a crime scene detective, testified that three .380 caliber cartridge cases\n\nand two bullets were found at the crime scene. An additional bullet was recovered following\n\nJohnson\u2019s medical treatment. Jami Dizon, a firearm and tool mark forensic scientist, analyzed\n\nthe cartridge cases and bullets. Dizon testified that the three cartridge cases were fired from the\n\n                                                -5-\n\fsame firearm and that the three bullets were fired from the same firearm. While Dizon could not\n\nverify that the cartridge cases and the bullets were fired from one firearm, she concluded that\n\nboth the cartridge cases and the bullets could have been fired from a Ruger .380 caliber pistol.\n\n       The images obtained from Collins\u2019s cell phone were admitted into evidence, including\n\nthe image of the pink and black Ruger .380 caliber pistol. Additionally, the camouflage jacket\n\nthat Collins was wearing when he came into police custody was admitted into evidence.\n\n       Collins presented defense evidence following the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief.\n\nCollins testified on his own behalf. Collins acknowledged that he knew Johnson and that he\n\ngave him a ride on the day of the shooting. Collins explained that he initially lied to the police\n\nabout the shooting because he had sold heroin to Johnson. Collins denied that he owned a pink\n\nand black pistol, and explained that the image on his cell phone was the cover of his rap mix\n\ntape. Collins admitted that he had previously been convicted of five felonies and three\n\nmisdemeanors involving moral turpitude.\n\n       Collins testified that a man wearing a black jacket and a black \u201cdu-rag\u201d approached\n\nJohnson in the alley near the barbershop on the day of the shooting. When the man said\n\n\u201csomething like I got you, got your ass, got you,\u201d Collins turned and ran back to his car. He then\n\nheard a gunshot. Collins suggested that the shooting was related to Johnson\u2019s gang affiliation.\n\n       Collins also presented testimony from Joshua Brown, an individual who called 9-1-1\n\nafter the shooting. Brown testified that he was sitting in his car near the scene of the shooting\n\nwhen he heard one gunshot. He then saw an individual wearing a \u201cblack cap and a black\n\nhoodie\u201d \u201cbolt\u201d from the alley where the shooting occurred.\n\n       The jury ultimately convicted Collins of aggravated malicious wounding, attempted\n\nrobbery, and two counts of using a firearm in the commission of a felony. This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\f                                          II. ANALYSIS\n\n       On appeal, Collins contends that the circuit court erred by denying his motion to suppress\n\nthe evidence obtained from the search of his cell phone. Collins argues that the warrant\n\nauthorizing the search only stated generalized suspicions and failed to establish the required\n\nnexus between the cell phone and the shooting. Collins maintains that the affidavit supporting\n\nthe warrant was so lacking in indicia of probable cause that an objective police officer could not\n\nhave reasonably relied on it in good faith. Therefore, Collins contends that the circuit court erred\n\nby determining that the evidence obtained from his cell phone was admissible under the good\n\nfaith exception established by Leon and subsequent cases.\n\n       Collins also argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his\n\nconvictions. Collins contends that the evidence failed to establish that he was the perpetrator of\n\nthe charged offenses. While Collins acknowledges that Johnson unequivocally identified him as\n\nthe shooter, Collins maintains that Johnson\u2019s testimony was contradicted by additional evidence\n\npresented in this case. He also argues that Johnson was inherently incredible.\n\n       Upon review, we conclude that the circuit court did not err by admitting the evidence\n\nobtained from Collins\u2019s cell phone pursuant to the Leon good faith exception. We also conclude\n\nthat the evidence presented in this case was sufficient to support Collins\u2019s convictions.\n\n    A. THE CIRCUIT COURT DID NOT ERR BY DENYING COLLINS\u2019S MOTION TO\n          SUPPRESS THE EVIDENCE OBTAINED FROM HIS CELL PHONE\n\n       \u201cA defendant\u2019s claim that evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment\n\npresents a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo on appeal.\u201d McCain v.\n\nCommonwealth, 275 Va. 546, 551, 659 S.E.2d 512, 515 (2008). \u201cIn considering such questions,\n\n[we are] required to give deference to the factual findings of the trial court and to determine\n\nindependently whether, under the law, the manner in which the evidence was obtained satisfies\n\nconstitutional requirements.\u201d McCain v. Commonwealth, 261 Va. 483, 490, 545 S.E.2d 541,\n                                                -7-\n\f545 (2001). \u201cThe defendant has the burden to show that, considering the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the Commonwealth, the trial court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion was\n\nreversible error.\u201d McCain, 275 Va. at 552, 659 S.E.2d at 515.\n\n       \u201cThe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution requires that a search warrant\n\nbe based upon probable cause.\u201d Sowers v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 588, 595, 643 S.E.2d\n\n506, 510 (2007). Generally, \u201c[w]here law enforcement officers illegally search private premises\n\nor seize property without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the illegally\n\nseized evidence will be excluded from evidence [in a criminal prosecution].\u201d Colaw v.\n\nCommonwealth, 32 Va. App. 806, 810, 531 S.E.2d 31, 33 (2000); see also Anzualda v.\n\nCommonwealth, 44 Va. App. 764, 779, 607 S.E.2d 749, 756 (2005) (en banc).\n\n       In Leon, \u201cthe United States Supreme Court established a good-faith exception to the\n\nexclusionary rule, applicable when a search is conducted pursuant to a warrant subsequently\n\ndetermined to be defective for Fourth Amendment purposes.\u201d Ward v. Commonwealth, 273 Va.\n\n211, 222, 639 S.E.2d 269, 274 (2008). \u201cUnder the good faith exception, \u2018[w]here a police officer\n\nhas an objectively reasonable belief that the issuing magistrate had probable cause to issue the\n\nsearch warrant, the officer may rely upon the magistrate\u2019s probable cause determination and the\n\nevidence [obtained pursuant to the defective warrant] will not be excluded.\u2019\u201d Sowers, 49\n\nVa. App. at 602, 643 S.E.2d at 513 (quoting Colaw, 32 Va. App. at 810-11, 531 S.E.2d at 33).\n\n       \u201c[T]he exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the\n\nerrors of judges and magistrates.\u201d Id. (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 916). \u201cAn officer ordinarily\n\ncannot be expected to question the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause.\u201d Adams, 48\n\nVa.

Perez, 393 F.3d 457, 461 (4th Cir.\n\n2004) (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 923)); see also Sowers, 49 Va. App. at 602, 643 S.E.2d at 513.\n\n       Collins bases his appellate argument on the third limitation to the Leon good faith\n\nexception. Collins argues that the affidavit supporting the warrant authorizing the search of his\n\ncell phone was so lacking in indicia of probable cause that a reasonable police officer could not\n\nhave relied on it in good faith. Collins emphasizes that the only statements contained in the\n\naffidavit suggesting that evidence pertaining to the shooting would be found on his cell phone\n\nwere Godwin\u2019s generalized statements about the behavior of violent criminals. Therefore,\n\nCollins contends that the affidavit failed to establish any factual nexus between the shooting and\n\nthe data contained on the cell phone.\n\n       Assuming without deciding that the circuit court correctly determined that the warrant at\n\nissue was not supported by probable cause, we find that the circuit court correctly concluded that\n\nthe evidence obtained from the search of Collins\u2019s cell phone was admissible pursuant to the\n                                                -9-\n\fLeon good faith exception. Although the affidavit supporting the warrant may have failed to\n\nestablish the requisite nexus between the cell phone and the shooting, it was not \u201cso lacking in\n\nindicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d\n\nLeon, 468 U.S. at 923 (emphasis added); see also Ward, 273 Va. at 222, 639 S.E.2d at 274.\n\n       \u201c[A]s long as there is some indicia of probable cause in the underlying affidavit, we will\n\napply the good faith exception as long as a reasonable police officer, after assessing the facts set\n\nforth in the affidavit, could have believed that the warrant was valid.\u201d Anzualda, 44 Va. App. at\n\n781, 607 S.E.2d at 757. In the present case, the affidavit supporting the warrant at issue\n\ncontained some indicia of probable cause. The affidavit contained a description of the shooting,\n\nand stated that the victim identified Collins as his assailant. The affidavit also indicated that\n\nCollins had a cell phone in his possession when he was taken into police custody following the\n\nshooting. The affidavit then explained that the data contained in a suspect\u2019s cell phone was often\n\n\u201cinstrumental in understanding how a violent crime occurred and who was involved.\u201d\n\n       While conclusions based on a police officer\u2019s training and experience are not sufficient in\n\nthemselves to provide a basis for probable cause, a magistrate may consider such conclusions\n\nwhen determining whether to issue a search warrant. See Sowards, 49 Va. App. at 597, 643\n\nS.E.2d at 510. Based on Godwin\u2019s training and experience, he concluded that Collins\u2019s cell\n\nphone likely contained evidence pertaining to the shooting. In the affidavit supporting the\n\nwarrant, Godwin explained that violent offenders often communicated with their cell phones and\n\nthat their cell phones frequently contained evidence of their crimes. The affidavit also described\n\nGodwin\u2019s prior law enforcement experience, and indicated that he had investigated numerous\n\nviolent crimes. These statements established a nexus, \u201chowever slight,\u201d between the shooting\n\nand Collins\u2019s cell phone. See Anzualda, 44 Va. App. at 784, 607 S.E.2d at 759.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f       Moreover, additional circumstances supported police reliance on the warrant at issue. \u201cIn\n\ndetermining whether police officers relied in good faith on a judicially issued warrant, we may\n\n\u2018take into account information known to police officers that was not included in the search\n\nwarrant affidavit.\u2019\u201d Midkiff v. Commonwealth, 54 Va. App. 323, 332, 678 S.E.2d 287, 292\n\n(2009) (quoting Adams, 275 Va. at 273, 657 S.E.2d at 94). In this case, Godwin obtained two\n\nwarrants regarding the cell phones. A magistrate in Prince George County issued a warrant\n\nauthorizing Godwin to search Collins\u2019s property and seize any cell phones that he found, and a\n\ncircuit court judge sitting in the City of Richmond issued a warrant authorizing the search of the\n\ncontents of the cell phone. Thus, two different officials had previously determined that\n\nGodwin\u2019s affidavit established a sufficient nexus between the shooting and Collins\u2019s cell phone.\n\n       We conclude that a reasonable police officer could have relied in good faith on the\n\nwarrant authorizing the search of Collins\u2019s cell phone. The warrant contained some indicia of\n\nprobable cause establishing that evidence of the shooting would be found on the cell phone, and\n\nboth a magistrate and a circuit court judge concluded that probable cause supported the search.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the circuit court did not err by determining that the evidence\n\nobtained from Collins\u2019s cell phone was admissible under the Leon good faith exception.\n\n    B. THE EVIDENCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT COLLINS\u2019S CONVICTIONS\n\n       When considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, we \u201cpresume the judgment\n\nof the trial court to be correct\u201d and reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u201cplainly wrong or\n\nwithout evidence to support it.\u201d Davis v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 96, 99, 570 S.E.2d 875,\n\n876-77 (2002); see also Code \u00a7 8.01-680. Under this standard, \u201ca reviewing court does not \u2018ask\n\nitself whether it believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\u2019\u201d Crowder v. Commonwealth, 41 Va. App. 658, 663, 588 S.E.2d 384, 387 (2003)\n\n(quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318-19 (1979)). It asks instead whether \u201cany\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\frational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\u201d Kelly v. Commonwealth, 41 Va. App. 250, 257, 584 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) (en banc)\n\n(emphasis added) (quoting Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319). \u201cThis familiar standard gives full play to\n\nthe responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the\n\nevidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d Jackson, 443\n\nU.S. at 319.\n\n        On appeal, Collins contends that the evidence presented at trial failed to establish that he\n\nwas the perpetrator of the charged offenses. Collins maintains that Johnson\u2019s testimony was\n\nincredible. Collins emphasizes that Johnson\u2019s testimony regarding the shooting was inconsistent\n\nwith the evidence found at the crime scene. Collins also notes that Johnson\u2019s testimony was\n\ncontradicted by his own version of the shooting\u00a0and the testimony of Brown, the individual who\n\ncalled 9-1-1 after the shooting.\n\n        \u201cThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely\n\nfor the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d\n\nSmith v. Commonwealth, 56 Va. App. 711, 718, 697 S.E.2d 14, 17 (2010) (quoting Sandoval v.\n\nCommonwealth, 20 Va. App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995)). \u201c[T]he conclusions of the\n\nfact finder on issues of witness credibility may be disturbed on appeal only when we find that the\n\nwitness\u2019 testimony was \u2018inherently incredible, or so contrary to human experience as to render it\n\nunworthy of belief.\u2019\u201d Ragsdale v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 421, 429, 565 S.E.2d 331, 335\n\n(2002) (quoting Ashby v. Commonwealth, 33 Va. App. 540, 548, 535 S.E.2d 182, 187 (2000)).\n\n        \u201cAt trial, the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving the identity of the accused as\n\nthe perpetrator beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Cuffee v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 353, 364,\n\n735 S.E.2d 693, 698 (2013) (quoting Blevins v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 412, 423, 579\n\nS.E.2d 658, 663 (2003)). In the present case, Johnson unequivocally identified Collins as his\n\n                                                 - 12 -\n\fassailant. Johnson testified that he knew Collins before the shooting. Johnson also provided a\n\ndetailed physical description of Collins to the police after the shooting, and later selected him as\n\nthe perpetrator from a photo lineup. Johnson\u2019s testimony identifying Collins as his assailant was\n\nnot inherently incredible.\n\n       Moreover, Johnson\u2019s testimony regarding the shooting was corroborated by substantial\n\nevidence. Johnson testified that Collins shot at him five times. Fleming, the Dominion Power\n\nemployee working nearby, testified that he heard five gunshots on the day of the shooting.\n\nJohnson also testified that Collins was wearing an \u201cArmy fatigue jacket\u201d and driving a small\n\nblue four-door car with \u201cdonut tires\u201d on the day of the shooting. Fleming testified that he saw an\n\nindividual wearing a camouflage jacket quickly walk away from the scene of the shooting and\n\ndrive away in a similar car with a \u201cdonut tire\u201d on one of its wheels.\n\n       Johnson also testified that Collins shot him with a pink and black .380 caliber pistol.\n\nCartridge cases and bullets were found at the crime scene that could have been fired by a .380\n\ncaliber firearm. Furthermore, an image found on Collins\u2019s cell phone showed a hand holding a\n\npink and black Ruger .380 caliber pistol, and a forensic scientist testified that the cartridge cases\n\nand bullets found at the crime scene could have been fired by a similar weapon.\n\n       Collins notes that Johnson testified that he was initially shot in the parking lot rather than\n\nthe alley. As no cartridge cases or bullets were found in the parking lot, Collins maintains that\n\nJohnson\u2019s description of the shooting was incredible. This argument is without merit. Provost,\n\nthe detective who collected evidence from the crime scene, testified that first responders often\n\ninadvertently moved evidence when responding to an emergency medical situation. Although\n\nJohnson testified that Collins shot at him five times, the police only found three cartridge cases\n\nand three bullets following the shooting. Based on this evidence, the jury could have reasonably\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\finferred that the police simply failed to discover all of the cartridge cases and bullets located at\n\nthe crime scene.\n\n       While Johnson\u2019s testimony regarding the shooting was inconsistent with Collins\u2019s\n\ntestimony about the incident, the jury reasonably rejected Collins\u2019s testimony. \u201cIn its role of\n\njudging witness credibility, the fact finder is entitled to disbelieve the self-serving testimony of\n\nthe accused and to conclude that the accused is lying to conceal his guilt.\u201d Flanagan v.\n\nCommonwealth, 58 Va. App. 681, 702, 714 S.E.2d 212, 222 (2011) (quoting Marable v.\n\nCommonwealth, 27 Va. App. 505, 509-10, 500 S.E.2d 233, 235 (1998)). In the present case, the\n\njury was entitled to reject Collins\u2019s self-serving testimony that an unknown man shot Johnson.\n\n       Notably, the evidence in this case established that Collins immediately fled from the\n\nscene of the shooting. The Supreme Court of Virginia has explained that \u201c[f]light following the\n\ncommission of a crime is evidence of guilt.\u201d Clagett v. Commonwealth, 252 Va. 79, 93, 472\n\nS.E.2d 263, 271 (1996). Additionally, Collins lied to the police about the shooting. Collins\n\ninitially told the police that he did not know Johnson, and he denied any involvement in the\n\nshooting. \u201cA false or evasive account is a circumstance, similar to flight from a crime scene, that\n\na fact finder may properly consider as evidence of guilty knowledge.\u201d Covil v. Commonwealth,\n\n268 Va. 692, 696, 604 S.E.2d 79, 82 (2004). Further, Collins\u2019s credibility was impeached by his\n\nprior criminal convictions. See Code \u00a7 19.2-269; Va. R. Evid. 2:609.\n\n       Collins contends that Brown\u2019s testimony supported his description of the shooting.\n\nBrown testified that he saw a man wearing black clothing run away from the alley immediately\n\nafter the shooting. Although Collins suggested that this man may have been the shooter, the jury\n\ncould have inferred that this individual was merely a bystander running away from the shooting\n\nor a concerned individual running to get help. The shooting occurred in downtown Richmond in\n\nthe middle of the day, and many people were nearby.\n\n                                                - 14 -\n\f       We conclude that the evidence presented by the Commonwealth was sufficient to support\n\nCollins\u2019s convictions. Ample evidence established that Collins was the perpetrator of the\n\noffenses at issue. Johnson unequivocally identified Collins as his assailant, and his testimony\n\nregarding the shooting was corroborated by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the circuit court\n\ndid not err by convicting Collins of the present offenses.\n\n                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons stated, we affirm Collins\u2019s convictions.\n\n                                                                                        Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\f",
