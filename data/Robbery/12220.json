Shappert, United States\nAttorney, Adam Morris, Assistant United States Attorney, Charlotte,\nNorth Carolina, for Appellee.\n\n\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n          Shun J. Diggs pled guilty to possession of a firearm by\n\na convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000),\n\nand was sentenced to 59 months\u2019 imprisonment.          Diggs appeals his\n\nconviction and sentence.      Finding no reversible error, we affirm.\n\n          Diggs argues the district court erred in denying his\n\nmotion to suppress evidence seized after officers stopped, frisked\n\nand searched him.    This court reviews the district court\u2019s factual\n\nfindings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error, and the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s legal determinations de novo.         Ornelas v. United\n\nStates, 517 U.S. 690, 699 (1996); United States v. Rusher, 966 F.2d\n\n868, 873 (4th Cir. 1992).      The evidence is construed in the light\n\nmost favorable to the prevailing party below.           United States v.\n\nSeidman, 156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir. 1998).\n\n          Diggs     first   alleges   the   officers   lacked   reasonable\n\nsuspicion to stop and frisk him.      Under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1,\n\n21-22, 27 (1968), an officer may seize a person if the officer can\n\narticulate reasonable suspicion that the person has just committed\n\nor is about to commit a crime, and the officer may pat-down the\n\nperson\u2019s outer clothing for weapons if the officer reasonably\n\nbelieves that the person may be armed.             Reasonable suspicion\n\nrequires more than a hunch but less than probable cause and may be\n\nbased on the collective knowledge of officers involved in an\n\ninvestigation.    See United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221, 232\n\n\n                                  - 2 -\n\f(1985). In assessing whether an officer possesses more than a mere\n\nhunch    to   justify     a    stop,    a     reviewing     court    must   credit       the\n\n\u201cpractical experience of officers who observe on a daily basis what\n\ntranspires on the street.\u201d             United States v. Lender, 985 F.2d 151,\n\n154 (4th Cir. 1993).            Factors which by themselves suggest only\n\ninnocent conduct may amount to reasonable suspicion when taken\n\ntogether.       United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 274-75 (2002);\n\nUnited States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1989).\n\n              When   reviewing         the    totality      of    the    circumstances,\n\nrelevant      behavior     includes         whether   the     stop      occurred    in    a\n\nhigh-crime area, and whether the suspect seemed nervous or evasive.\n\nUnited States v. Mayo, 361 F.3d 802, 805-06 (4th Cir. 2004).                              In\n\nMayo,    this    court    found    sufficient         reasonable        suspicion    that\n\ncriminal activity was afoot based on the following facts:                          (1) the\n\nencounter occurred in a high-crime area; (2) after seeing the\n\nofficers, the defendant put his hand in his pocket and appeared to\n\nbe supporting something heavy; (3) the defendant turned away from\n\nthe officers and headed in another direction; and (4) the defendant\n\ndisplayed nervous behavior.             Id. at 807-08.\n\n              Here, Agent Andrew Cheramie of the Bureau of Alcohol,\n\nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives was conducting surveillance of a\n\nhigh    crime    area    and   noticed        Diggs   and   two     other   individuals\n\nloitering around different areas over a period of time without an\n\nobvious purpose. Agent Cheramie then contacted uniformed Charlotte\n\n\n                                             - 3 -\n\fMecklenburg police officers Christopher Miller and Anthony Hall,\n\nwho were working with him on a robbery prevention task force, and\n\nadvised them to follow-up with the individuals.                       When the officers\n\narrived to the area, Diggs and the other two individuals split up\n\nto   go   separate      directions,       which       based    on     Officer    Miller\u2019s\n\nexperience, was done in an attempt to elude police or gain a\n\ntactical advantage over officers.                When Officer Miller asked Diggs\n\nwhere he was going, he stated he was going home but pointed in the\n\nopposite direction than he had been walking.\n\n            Officer       Miller       noticed    a    bulge     in    Diggs\u2019     pocket.\n\nAlthough Diggs initially stated he had identification, when Officer\n\nMiller    asked    to    see    it,    Diggs     reached      into    that    pocket   and\n\nimmediately       withdrew       his     hand,     stating      he      did     not    have\n\nidentification.         Officer Miller was thus lead to believe Diggs was\n\nhiding    something.           Officer    Miller      also    testified       Diggs\u2019   eye\n\nmovements and body language suggested he was looking for a way to\n\nrun and that \u201cwasn\u2019t just a hunch or suspicion . . . I was pretty\n\ncertain that I was dealing with somebody who was engaged in\n\ncriminal activity.\u201d\n\n            We find, construing the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the Government, that the district court did not err in\n\nfinding that the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop and\n\nfrisk Diggs based on the totality of the circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 4 -\n\f            Diggs next contends that his raising his arms up when\n\nOfficer Miller asked if he could search him did not amount to\n\nconsent to the search of his person.      Whether a defendant consents\n\nto a search is a factual question determined under the totality of\n\nthe   circumstances   and   reviewed   under   the   clearly   erroneous\n\nstandard.    See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 248-49\n\n(1973); United States v. Jones, 356 F.3d 529, 533 n.* (4th Cir.\n\n2004).   The Government has the burden of proving that consent was\n\nfreely and voluntarily given.     Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 222.\n\n            This court has previously recognized that consent can be\n\ninferred from the physical actions of a suspect. See United States\n\nv. Wilson, 895 F.2d 168, 170 (4th Cir. 1990).            In Wilson, the\n\nsuspect had been stopped by a Drug Enforcement Agent in one of the\n\nWashington, D.C., area airports.         Id.   The agent was searching\n\nWilson\u2019s bag when he noticed a suspicious bulge in Wilson\u2019s pants.\n\nId.   He then asked Wilson if he could search his person.        Wilson\n\nresponded by \u201cshrugg[ing] his shoulders and extend[ing] his arms.\u201d\n\nId.   We found this conduct sufficient to convey consent.\n\n            Similarly, here, Officer Miller noticed a bulge in Diggs\u2019\n\npocket and asked Diggs if he had any weapons.        Diggs stated he did\n\nnot have any weapons.   Officer Miller then asked, \u201c[d]o you mind if\n\nI search?\u201d    Diggs made no verbal response but raised his arms up.\n\nWe find that based on the absence of evidence of threats, force, or\n\nphysical intimidation, which Diggs has not alleged, Diggs\u2019 raising\n\n\n                                 - 5 -\n\fof his arms constituted a voluntary consent to search his person.\n\nSee Wilson, 895 F.2d at 170.   Accordingly, the district court did\n\nnot clearly err in finding Diggs consented to the search and\n\ntherefore denying the motion to suppress.\n\n          Finally, Diggs contends the district court erred by\n\nenhancing his sentence for possessing a stolen firearm based on\n\nhearsay evidence.   However, Diggs\u2019 claims fails, because hearsay\n\nevidence is admissible at sentencing.   See United States v. Love,\n\n134 F.3d 595, 607 (4th Cir. 1998).\n\n          Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We\n\ndispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions\n\nare adequately presented in the materials before the court and\n\nargument would not aid the decisional process.\n\n\n\n                                                          AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                               - 6 -\n\f",
