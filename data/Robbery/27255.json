Compton,\n                                                                                    FILED\nPetitioner Below, Petitioner                                                     June 25, 2020\n                                                                                EDYTHE NASH GAISER, CLERK\n                                                                                SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS\nvs.) No. 19-0733 (Kanawha County 19-P-61)                                           OF WEST VIRGINIA\n\n\nShawn Straughn, Superintendent,\nNorthern Regional Jail and Correctional Center,\nRespondent Below, Respondent\n\n\n\n\n                               MEMORANDUM DECISION\n\n\n\n        Petitioner Jason M. Compton, self-represented litigant, appeals the July 18, 2019, order of\nthe Circuit Court of Kanawha County denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Respondent\nShawn Straughn, Superintendent, Northern Regional Jail and Correctional Center, by counsel\nAndrea Nease Proper, filed a response in support of the circuit court\u2019s order.\n\n       The Court has considered the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal. The facts and legal\narguments are adequately presented, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided\nby oral argument. Upon consideration of the standard of review, the briefs, and the record\npresented, the Court finds no substantial question of law and no prejudicial error. For these reasons,\na memorandum decision affirming the circuit court\u2019s order is appropriate under Rule 21 of the\nRules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n        In 2015, petitioner was indicted in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County on two counts\nof robbery and two counts of conspiracy to commit robbery. Petitioner faced the possibility of\nbeing charged as a recidivist because he had a prior conviction for robbery, in 2007, and a prior\nconviction for conspiracy to transport drugs into a jail in 2010.\n\n        The parties reached a plea agreement that was favorable to petitioner. Petitioner pled guilty\nto one count of robbery, without reference to the use of a firearm, in exchange for the State\u2019s\ndismissal of the other charges and agreement not to file a recidivist information. In petitioner\u2019s\nguilty plea, he \u201cacknowledged that he understood his constitutional rights and acknowledged that\nhe was totally satisfied with the representation afforded him by his lawyer.\u201d By order entered on\n                                                  1\n\fNovember 2, 2015, the circuit court found that petitioner\u2019s guilty plea \u201cwas knowing, voluntary,\nintelligent, understanding[,] and freely given.\u201d\n\n        Prior to sentencing, the circuit court received a letter from petitioner, in which he stated\nthat:\n\n        . . . [H]e robbed the bank . . . to get money to get drugs. He stated he was high, but\n        acknowledged that was no excuse. The petitioner blamed his co-defendant . . ., but\n        recalled specifics about the robbery such as the shirt, hat[,] and mask he was\n        wearing as well as the fact that he used a BB gun so that no one would get hurt. . .\n        . He did not state that he didn\u2019t understand what he was doing, nor did he state was\n        so impaired that he lacked capacity. Indeed, he stated he did have capacity in that\n        he said clearly, the motive for the robbery was to get money to get drugs.\n\nThe circuit court imposed a sentence of thirty years of incarceration. 1\n\n        On February 20, 2019, petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and motion for\nthe appointment of counsel. By order entered on April 24, 2019, the circuit court denied the motion.\nPetitioner filed a second motion for the appointment of counsel on May 17, 2019. The circuit court\ndenied that motion by order entered on May 24, 2019.\n\n        By order entered on July 18, 2019, the circuit court denied the habeas petition. The circuit\ncourt found that petitioner alleged that (1) his trial counsels were ineffective because they failed\nto conduct a reasonable investigation regarding voluntary intoxication and diminished capacity\nand to advise petitioner that it was possible to raise those defenses; and (2) given his trial counsels\u2019\nineffective performance, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction in his criminal case. The circuit court\ndetermined that petitioner\u2019s \u201cconclusory\u201d allegations that voluntary intoxication and diminished\ncapacity were available defenses did not warrant a hearing or the appointment of counsel as the\n\n        1\n         The date of the circuit court\u2019s sentencing order is not reflected in the appellate record.\nPetitioner\u2019s appendix consists only of the July 18, 2019, order denying his petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. Respondent argues that this Court should disregard petitioner\u2019s assignments of\nerror alleging that the circuit court failed to rule on a motion to file an amended habeas petition\nand a request for a copy of his case file as the appellate record contains no evidence of such\nrequests. Rule 10(c)(7) of the West Virginia Rules of Appellate Procedure provides, in pertinent\npart, that \u201c[t]he argument must contain appropriate and specific citations to the record on appeal,\nincluding citations that pinpoint when and how the issues in the assignments of error were\npresented to the lower tribunal,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Court may disregard errors that are not adequately\nsupported by specific references to the record on appeal.\u201d See State v. Honaker, 193 W. Va. 51,\n56 n.4, 454 S.E.2d 96, 101 n.4 (1994) (stating that we \u201ctake as non[-]existing all facts that do not\nappear in the [appendix] record and will ignore those issues where the missing record is needed to\ngive factual support to the claim\u201d). Therefore, we disregard any argument based on materials not\nincluded in petitioner\u2019s appendix, including his contention that the circuit court failed to rule on a\nmotion to file an amended habeas petition and a request for a copy of his case file.\n\n                                                   2\n\frecord reflected that petitioner had the specific intent to commit the robbery to obtain money for\ndrugs. The circuit court further determined that petitioner\u2019s jurisdictional claim was derivative of\nhis ineffective assistance claim, and, therefore, denied both claims.\n\n       Petitioner now appeals the circuit court\u2019s July 18, 2019, order denying the habeas petition.\nThis Court reviews circuit court orders denying habeas relief under the following standard:\n\n               \u201cIn reviewing challenges to the findings and conclusions of the circuit court\n       in a habeas corpus action, we apply a three-prong standard of review. We review\n       the final order and the ultimate disposition under an abuse of discretion standard;\n       the underlying factual findings under a clearly erroneous standard; and questions\n       of law are subject to a de novo review.\u201d Syl. Pt. 1, Mathena v. Haines, 219 W. Va.\n       417, 633 S.E.2d 771 (2006).\n\nSyl. Pt. 1, Anstey v. Ballard, 237 W. Va. 411, 787 S.E.2d 864 (2016).\n\n        On appeal, petitioner argues that prior to denying the petition, the circuit court should have\nheld a hearing and appointed counsel, arguing that this was his omnibus habeas corpus proceeding.\nUpon our review of the record, we find that petitioner misunderstands the nature of the circuit\ncourt\u2019s denial of his habeas petition. Given its determination that petitioner\u2019s allegations were\nconclusory, the circuit court found that the petition did not warrant an omnibus proceeding.\n\n        In Losh v. McKenzie, 166 W. Va. 762, 771, 277 S.E.2d 606, 612 (1981), we noted that \u201c[a]\nmere recitation of any of [the] . . . grounds [for habeas relief] without detailed factual support does\nnot justify the issuance of a writ, the appointment of counsel, and the holding of a hearing.\u201d In\nSyllabus Point 3 of Anstey, we held:\n\n               \u201c\u2018A court having jurisdiction over habeas corpus proceedings may deny a\n       petition for a writ of habeas corpus without a hearing and without appointing\n       counsel for the petitioner if the petition, exhibits, affidavits or other documentary\n       evidence filed therewith show to such court\u2019s satisfaction that the petitioner is\n       entitled to no relief.\u2019 Syllabus Point 1, Perdue v. Coiner, 156 W. Va. 467, 194\n       S.E.2d 657 (1973).\u201d Syl. Pt. 2, White v. Haines, 215 W. Va. 698, 601 S.E.2d 18\n       (2004).\n\nId. at 412, 787 S.E.2d at 864.\n\n        Respondent argues that the circuit court properly denied the petition in accordance with\nthis Court\u2019s decision in Perdue and its progeny. We agree and conclude that the circuit court\u2019s\ndenial of the habeas petition did not constitute an abuse of discretion.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s July 18, 2019, order denying\npetitioner\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n\n                                                                                            Affirmed.\n                                                  3\n\fISSUED: June 25, 2020\n\n\nCONCURRED IN BY:\n\nChief Justice Tim Armstead\nJustice Margaret L.
