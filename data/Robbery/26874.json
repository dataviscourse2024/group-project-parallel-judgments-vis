On April 27, 2017, the Commonwealth arrested and charged\n\nMichaels for the April 25, 2017 murder and robbery of the victim, Kodi\n\nFlanagan.      At trial, the Commonwealth presented testimony from four\n\nwitnesses, co-defendant Sadia Bretznepe, Saeed Christiaan Afshar, Stephen\n\nWentze, and co-defendant Dylan Beard.3\n\n       Mr. Flanagan was a drug-dealer who owed Michaels money. (See N.T.\n\nTrial, 12/10-12/18, at 185). Mr. Beard had set up Mr. Flanagan with a drug\n\nsupplier so he could sell marijuana, but Mr. Flanagan failed to pay for the\n\ndrugs that were fronted to him. (See id. at 183). Mr. Beard and Michaels\n\ndecided to confront Mr. Flanagan about these issues approximately one week\n\nbefore he was killed. (See id. at 186).\n\n       In April 2017, Michaels and Mr. Beard contacted Ms. Bretznepe, a long-\n\ntime friend of Mr. Flanagan\u2019s, to get her assistance in arranging a meeting\n\nwith him under the guise of a drug deal because they knew he would not trust\n\nthem if they attempted to do so. (See id. at 186-87). Michaels contacted\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3 Ms. Bretznepe pleaded guilty in connection with the robbery and murder of\nMr. Flanagan in exchange for a sentence of not less than five nor more than\ntwelve years\u2019 incarceration. Mr. Beard entered a guilty plea for the murder,\nrobbery, and conspiracy to commit robbery, and received an agreed-upon\nsentence of forty years\u2019 incarceration.\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S60039-19\n\n\nMs. Bretznepe on Snapchat to see if she knew how to reach Mr. Flanagan.\n\n(See id. at 42). She indicated she did not, but two days later, Michaels again\n\ncontacted her and offered to pay her for any information she had about how\n\nto locate Mr. Flanagan because he owed Michaels and Mr. Beard money. (See\n\nid. at 42-43). After Ms. Bretznepe explained she did not know how to contact\n\nMr. Flanagan and was not interested in Michaels\u2019 money, Michaels did not\n\nmake any further effort to contact her. However, the next day (the day of the\n\nmurder), Ms. Bretznepe engaged in a video chat with Mr. Beard; during which\n\nMichaels was in the background directing Mr. Beard to tell Ms. Bretznepe the\n\nspecific details of location and time for the drug deal with Mr. Flanagan. (See\n\nid. at 45-48).\n\n      Mr. Afshar was friends with Mr. Beard and met Michaels through him the\n\nday before the shooting. (See id. at 79, 81). That day, Mr. Beard advised\n\nMr. Afshar that Mr. Flanagan owed him money, and that he and Michaels\n\nintended to find him to get it back. (See id. at 84-85).\n\n      The next day (the day of the incident), Mr. Afshar agreed to serve as\n\ntheir protection in this plan. (See id. at 85-86). He picked up Michaels and\n\nMr. Beard from each of their residences and the men drove around until Mr.\n\nAfshar dropped them off near Mr. Beard\u2019s home at approximately 4:00 p.m.\n\n(See id. at 88-90, 98). During a series of texts messages with Mr. Beard\n\nshortly thereafter, Mr. Afshar discovered that Michaels planned to bring a gun\n\nto the meeting with Mr. Flanagan. (See id. at 107-08). However, Mr. Beard\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fJ-S60039-19\n\n\ndid not think that the gun would be used because the plan was to ambush Mr.\n\nFlanagan, attack him, and take all of the items in his possession, not shoot\n\nhim. (See id. at 195-96).\n\n      Later that evening, Mr. Afshar met Mr. Beard and Michaels near the\n\nagreed-upon location. (See id. at 114, 116). Mr. Afshar walked around on\n\nhis own looking for Mr. Flanagan before he observed Mr. Beard and Michaels\n\napproach Mr. Flanagan\u2019s vehicle, Mr. Beard pull him out, and Mr. Flanagan\n\nattempt to run away. (See id. at 118-19, 203). When Mr. Beard punched\n\nMr. Flanagan in the back of the head to keep him from escaping, Mr. Afshar\n\nand Mr. Beard witnessed Michaels shoot Mr. Flanagan twice from the driver\u2019s\n\nside of the vehicle, before then assaulting him and going through his pockets.\n\n(See id. at 120, 204-05).      Mr. Beard also went through Mr. Flanagan\u2019s\n\npockets. (See id. at 123). Mr. Beard then ran away and Michaels left the\n\nscene with Mr. Afshar in his vehicle.   (See id. at 123-24, 204-05).      After\n\ndropping Michaels off, Mr. Afshar called 911 to report the shooting. (See id.\n\nat 129-31). Michaels and Mr. Beard later called Mr. Wentze for a ride and\n\nMichaels advised him that Mr. Flanagan had been shot and might be dead.\n\n(See id. at 171-72).\n\n      Video surveillance of a portion of the scene showed a person in light-\n\ncolored khaki pants like those worn by Michaels approach the driver\u2019s side of\n\nMr. Flanagan\u2019s vehicle. (See id. at 209-10). An individual dressed in all black\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fJ-S60039-19\n\n\nwas near him. (See id. at 210). Mr. Beard identified the men as Michaels\n\nand Mr. Afshar, respectively. (See id. at 209-10).\n\n        At the conclusion of trial, the jury convicted Michaels of the previously\n\nmentioned charges. On December 21, 2018, the trial court sentenced him to\n\na mandatory term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.4\n\nMichaels filed post-sentence motions challenging his sentence and the weight\n\nand sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction, which the trial court\n\ndenied. Michaels timely appealed and he and the court complied with Rule\n\n1925. See Pa.R.A.P. 1925.\n\n                                               II.\n\n                                               A.\n\n        Michaels first contends that a mandatory sentence of life without the\n\npossibility of parole violates the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions\u2019\n\nproscription against cruel and unusual punishment.5 In essence, he maintains\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n4   Pursuant to Section 1102(b) of the Crimes Code:\n\n        Second Degree. Except as provided under section 1102.1, a\n        person who has been convicted of murder of the second degree,\n        of second degree murder of an unborn child or of second degree\n        murder of a law enforcement officer shall be sentenced to a term\n        of life imprisonment.\n\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102(b) (emphasis added).\n\n5   See U.S. Const. amend. VIII; Pa. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 13.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fJ-S60039-19\n\n\nthat   the   trial   court\u2019s lack of      discretion   in   his   case   resulted in a\n\n\u201cdisproportionate, excessive\u201d sentence.6 (Michaels\u2019 Brief, at 30; see id. at\n\n13-30).\n\n       However, in Commonwealth v. Cornish, 370 A.2d 291 (Pa. 1977), our\n\nSupreme Court rejected a nearly identical argument as the one presented\n\nhere, holding:\n\n       Under the present statutory scheme, the mandatory sentence is\n       imposed only in cases of murder of the second degree, or felony\n       murder. It can hardly be said that the circumstances wherein a\n       murder is committed during the commission of a felony vary to\n       such an extent that the legislative determination to mandate one\n       penalty is unreasonable.\n\nCornish, supra at 293 n.4.\n\n       Based on this precedent, Michaels\u2019 claim that his mandatory sentence\n\nwas illegal because it constituted cruel and unusual punishment and is\n\ndisproportionate to the facts presented lacks merit.7\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n6 Because Michaels\u2019 constitutional claim raises a pure question of law, our\nstandard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. See\nCommonwealth v. Omar, 981 A.2d 179, 185 (Pa. 2009); Commonwealth\nv. Henkel, 938 A.2d 433, 446 n.14 (Pa. Super. 2007), appeal denied, 955\nA.2d 356 (Pa. 2008).\n\n7 As observed by the Commonwealth, to the extent that Michaels\u2019 sentencing\nchallenge could in any way be interpreted as a challenge to the court\u2019s exercise\nof discretion, any review would be inappropriate where he failed to include a\nRule 2119(f) statement in his brief. (See Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 5).\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fJ-S60039-19\n\n\n                                               B.\n\n       Next, Michaels argues that the evidence was insufficient8 to convict him\n\nof second-degree murder because it \u201cnearly all comes from a corrupt source,\u201d\n\ni.e., his co-defendants, and was contradictory. (Michaels\u2019 Brief, at 34; see\n\nid. at 30-35).9\n\n       Section 2502 of the Crimes Code, provides, in pertinent part:           \u201cA\n\ncriminal homicide constitutes murder of the second degree when it is\n\ncommitted while defendant was engaged as a principal or an accomplice in\n\nthe perpetration of a felony.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502(b). Pursuant to Section\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n8 In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c[w]e must determine whether\nthe evidence admitted at trial, and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom,\nwhen viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner,\nsupport the conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Commonwealth v.\nN.M.C., 172 A.3d 1146, 1149 (Pa. Super. 2017) (citation omitted). \u201cWhere\nthere is sufficient evidence to enable the trier of fact to find every element of\nthe crime has been established beyond a reasonable doubt, the sufficiency of\nthe evidence claim must fail.\u201d          Id. (citation omitted).    \u201cThe evidence\nestablished at trial need not preclude every possibility of innocence and the\nfact-finder is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence presented. It is\nnot within the province of this Court to re-weigh the evidence and substitute\nour judgment for that of the fact-finder.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). \u201cThe\nCommonwealth\u2019s burden may be met by wholly circumstantial evidence and\nany doubt about the defendant\u2019s guilt is to be resolved by the fact[-]finder\nunless the evidence is so weak and inconclusive that, as a matter of law, no\nprobability of fact can be drawn from the combined circumstances.\u201d Id.\n(citation omitted).\n\n9 As an initial matter, we observe that this argument attacks the credibility of\nthe witness testimony, which goes to the weight of the evidence, not its\nsufficiency. See Commonwealth v. Sherwood, 982 A.2d 483, 492 (Pa.\n2009), cert. denied, 559 U.S. 1111 (2010).\n\n\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fJ-S60039-19\n\n\n3701(a)(1)(i), \u201c[a] person is guilty of robbery if, in the course of committing\n\na theft, he: (i) inflicts serious bodily injury upon another[.]\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n\n2502(b)(i).     Finally, Section 903(a) states that \u201c[a] person is guilty of\n\nconspiracy with another person or persons to commit a crime if with the intent\n\nof promoting or facilitating its commission he . . . agrees with such other\n\nperson or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct\n\nwhich constitutes such crime . . . or agrees to aid such other person or persons\n\nin the planning or commission of such crime[.]\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903(a).10\n\n       Instantly, the Commonwealth provided testimony from Mr. Beard that\n\nhe and Michaels specifically sought out Ms. Bretznepe in an effort to locate Mr.\n\nFlanagan to rob because he owed them money.            Ms. Bretznepe similarly\n\ntestified that both Michaels and Mr. Beard contacted her in an attempt to\n\nlocate Mr. Flanagan.        Michaels was present for the video chat when Ms.\n\nBretznepe spoke with Mr. Beard about robbing Mr. Flanagan.           Mr. Afshar\n\ntestified that there was a plan between Mr. Beard and Michaels to find and rob\n\nMr. Flanagan because he owed them money, and that he was to act as their\n\nprotection. There was surveillance video that corroborated Mr. Afshar\u2019s story\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n10 \u201cProving the existence of such an agreement is not always easy, and is\nrarely proven with direct evidence. An explicit or formal agreement to commit\ncrimes can seldom, if ever, be proved and it need not be, for proof of a criminal\npartnership is almost invariably extracted from the circumstances that attend\nits activities.\u201d Commonwealth v. Jordan, 212 A.3d 91, 96 (Pa. Super.\n2019) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fJ-S60039-19\n\n\nthat the men went to the Harrisburg Mall earlier in the day of the murder. Mr.\n\nBeard and Mr. Afshar were aware that Michaels was bringing a firearm to the\n\nmeeting with Mr. Flanagan.           Finally, Mr. Beard and Mr. Afshar observed\n\nMichaels shoot Mr. Flanagan before he went through his pockets and left the\n\nscene.\n\n       Viewing the foregoing in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth,\n\nwe conclude that the trial court properly found that it provided sufficient\n\nevidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Michaels committed second\n\ndegree murder, robbery, and conspiracy to commit robbery.          See N.M.C.,\n\nsupra at 1149. Michaels\u2019 second issue lacks merit.\n\n                                               C.\n\n       In his third and final issue, Michaels argues that the verdict was against\n\nthe weight of the evidence because it established that Mr. Beard, Ms.\n\nBretznepe and Mr. Afshar arranged for and executed the robbery and murder\n\nof Flanagan.11 (See Michaels\u2019 Brief, at 36-39). Aside from the direct evidence\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n11\u201cAppellate review of a weight claim is a review of the exercise of discretion,\nnot of the underlying question of whether the verdict is against the weight of\nthe evidence.\u201d Commonwealth v. Leatherby, 116 A.3d 73, 82 (Pa. Super.\n2015) (citation omitted). \u201cBecause the trial judge has had the opportunity to\nhear and see the evidence presented, an appellate court will give the gravest\nconsideration to the findings and reasons advanced by the trial judge when\nreviewing a trial court\u2019s determination that the verdict is against the weight of\nthe evidence.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). \u201cOne of the least assailable reasons for\ngranting or denying a new trial is the lower court\u2019s conviction that the verdict\nwas or was not against the weight of the evidence and that a new trial should\nbe granted in the interest of justice.\u201d Id. (citation omitted).\n\n                                           -9-\n\fJ-S60039-19\n\n\nthat Michaels fired the shots that killed Mr. Flanagan, the trial court set forth\n\na detailed recitation of the \u201cabundant\u201d testimony presented by the\n\nCommonwealth to establish that Michaels committed the crimes charged,\n\nwhich we need not repeat here, and that it properly exercised its discretion to\n\nfind that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence. (Trial Court\n\nOpinion, 5/08/19, at 10; see id. at 7-10).\n\n      Based on our independent review of the record and the trial court\u2019s\n\ndetailed recitation of the facts supporting its finding, we discern no abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See Leatherby, supra at 82. Hence, Michaels\u2019 third issue does\n\nnot merit relief.\n\n      Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
