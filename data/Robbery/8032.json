We affirm, in part, vacate, in part,\n\nand remand this matter to the trial court for resentencing.\n\n      The facts and procedural history of this case are as follows.         On\n\nNovember 27, 2019, at approximately 1:30 a.m., Officer Gino Macioce of the\n\nPittsburgh Police Department was dispatched to a residence in the East Hills\n\nsection of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, following a report of \u201ca violent domestic\n\n[incident] involving a male and female.\u201d N.T. Trial, 4/7/21, at 18-19. Upon\n\narrival, Officer Macioce met with the victim who \u201crelated to the officers that\n\nshe was physically assaulted by her intimate partner, [Appellant].\u201d Trial Court\n\nOpinion, 1/18/22, at 2. In particular, the victim stated that the altercation\n\nbegan after Appellant arrived at her apartment in a \u201cbad mood\u201d and after the\n\fJ-A02023-23\n\n\n\nvictim confronted Appellant about living with her without paying bills. Id. at\n\n48. The victim also confronted Appellant about a dinner receipt she found\n\nwherein Appellant spent a large amount of money, causing her to believe that\n\nhe had a romantic dinner with another individual. Id. at 80. Thus, the victim\n\nstarted removing Appellant\u2019s belongings from the apartment. Id. at 49. At\n\nthat time, Appellant \u201cbegan to assault [her].\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 1/18/22,\n\nat 2. Specifically, Appellant\n\n       struck the victim in the head with his fists, bit her and strangled\n       her until she became unconscious. [Appellant also] threatened\n       [her, stating] that if she called the police[,] he would have\n       people find her.\n\nId.\n\n      Then, Appellant left the victim\u2019s apartment. Shortly thereafter,\n\n       [p]olice officers located [Appellant] not far from the residence.\n       [Appellant] fled from the police [] but was eventually\n       apprehended. [Appellant also] refused to comply with the\n       police officers\u2019 commands but he was eventually taken into\n       custody. Marijuana and packaging materials were recovered\n       from [Appellant upon his seizure].\n\nId.\n\n      The Commonwealth charged Appellant with strangulation; robbery;\n\nintimidation of a witness; simple assault; resisting arrest; possession with\n\nintent to deliver; two counts of possession of a controlled substance; and\n\npossession of drug paraphernalia. The matter proceeded to a non-jury trial\n\non April 7, 2021, during which the victim, as well as other police officers\n\ntestified. During the victim\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth sought to admit\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fJ-A02023-23\n\n\n\nfive photographs of the victim depicting her injuries from the November 27,\n\n2019 assault.      N.T. Trial, 4/7/21, at 69.    Counsel for Appellant objected,\n\nclaiming that the photographs were not provided to Appellant prior to trial.\n\nId. at 70. While the Commonwealth disputed counsel\u2019s statement, the trial\n\ncourt accepted defense counsel\u2019s assertion that the photographs \u201csomehow\n\nescaped production.\u201d Id. at 72-73. The court, however overruled counsel\u2019s\n\nobjection and the photographs were admitted into evidence. Id. at 73 and\n\n77.     Ultimately, the trial court found Appellant guilty of strangulation,1\n\nintimidation of a witness,2 simple assault,3 resisting arrest,4 and possession of\n\ndrug paraphernalia.5\n\n        The matter proceeded to sentencing, which occurred on July 20, 2021.\n\nThat day, the trial court sentenced Appellant to a term of 36 to 72 months\u2019\n\nimprisonment followed by five years\u2019 probation for Appellant\u2019s conviction for\n\nstrangulation. The trial court also imposed a sentence of six to 12 months\u2019\n\nincarceration relating to Appellant\u2019s conviction for intimidation of a witness.\n\nThe trial court ordered Appellant\u2019s sentence for intimidation of a witness to\n\nrun consecutive to his sentence for strangulation.       No further penalty was\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1   18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2718(a)(1).\n\n2   18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4952(a)(1).\n\n3   18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2701(a)(1).\n\n4   18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5104.\n\n5   35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 780\u2013113(a)(32).\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-A02023-23\n\n\n\nimposed as to Appellant\u2019s remaining convictions.              Appellant filed a\n\npost-sentence motion for a new trial on July 28, 2021, which the trial court\n\ndenied on August 3, 2021. This timely appeal followed.\n\n      Appellant raises the following issues on appeal:\n\n       1. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by admitting\n          photographic evidence the Commonwealth failed to turn over\n          in mandatory discovery, causing [Appellant] prejudice?\n\n       2. Whether [Appellant\u2019s] sentence [for] [s]trangulation is illegal\n          because his aggregate sentence of 132 months is in excess\n          of the statutory maximum allowable sentence of 120 months\n          under 18 Pa.C.S.[A.] \u00a7 106?\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 5.\n\n      In his first issue, Appellant claims the trial court erred in admitting\n\nphotographic    evidence   depicting    the   victim\u2019s   injuries   because   the\n\nCommonwealth failed to produce or disclose the photographs in violation of\n\nPa.R.Crim.P. 573 prior to trial. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 13. Appellant asserts that\n\nadmission of the photographs, despite nondisclosure, prejudiced him because\n\nthe photographs impermissibly bolstered the victim\u2019s testimony which, he\n\nclaims the trial court characterized as \u201cshaky.\u201d Id. at 18. We disagree.\n\n      \u201cWe note that questions involving discovery in criminal cases lie within\n\nthe discretion of the trial court.\u201d Commonwealth v. Rucci, 670 A.2d 1129,\n\n1140 (Pa. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1121 (1997). Pennsylvania Rule 573\n\nof Criminal Procedure provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n       (B) Disclosure by the Commonwealth.\n\n            (1) Mandatory. In all court cases, on request by the\n            defendant, and subject to any protective order which the\n\n                                       -4-\n\fJ-A02023-23\n\n\n            Commonwealth might obtain under this rule, the\n            Commonwealth shall disclose to the defendant's attorney\n            all of the following requested items or information,\n            provided they are material to the instant case. The\n            Commonwealth shall, when applicable, permit the\n            defendant's attorney to inspect and copy or photograph\n            such items.\n\n                                      ***\n\n                 (g) any tangible objects,       including documents,\n                 photographs,  fingerprints       or   other  tangible\n                 evidence[.]\n\nPa.R.Crim P. 573(B)(1)(g). If a party fails to comply with Rule 573(B), the\n\ncourt may\n\n       grant a continuance, or may prohibit such a party from\n       introducing evidence not disclosed, other than testimony of the\n       defendant, or it may enter such other order it deems just under\n       the circumstances.\n\nPa.R.Crim P. 573(E).\n\n      Herein, on February 25, 2020, Appellant asked the Commonwealth to\n\nprovide   him   with   information   and   material   discoverable   under   Rule\n\n573B(1)(a-g). Appellant's Pro Se Request for Pre-Trial Discovery, 2/25/20, at\n\n1. Yet, the Commonwealth failed to produce the photographs of the victim\u2019s\n\ninjuries to Appellant until trial.   N.T. Trial, 4/7/21, at 72-73.      Delayed\n\nproduction of materials subject to mandatory disclosure \u201c\u2018does not[,\n\nhowever,] automatically entitle [A]ppellant [to relief].\u2019\u201d Commonwealth v.\n\nCausey, 833 A.2d 165, 171 (Pa. Super. 2003) (citation omitted). To obtain\n\nrelief, Appellant must show prejudice. Id. To establish prejudice, Appellant\n\n\u201cmust demonstrate how a more timely disclosure would have affected his trial\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fJ-A02023-23\n\n\n\nstrategy or how he was otherwise prejudiced by the alleged late disclosure.\u201d\n\nId.   Appellant claims he was prejudiced by the Commonwealth\u2019s failure\n\nbecause the photographs, in essence, bolstered the victim\u2019s testimony, which\n\n\u201cwas \u2018shaky\u2019 according to the trial court.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 18.\n\n      Initially, we note that, while Appellant argues that the trial court\n\nconsidered the victim to be a \u201cshaky\u201d witness, the record belies this claim.\n\nThe full exchange from which Appellant highlights the court\u2019s statement is as\n\nfollows:\n\n       [Defense Counsel]: [] Your Honor, I would argue that the\n       Commonwealth has not proven their case beyond a reasonable\n       doubt with the exception of possession.\n\n       The court: You want to attack the credibility of [the victim] and\n       say that her testimony is such that it does [not] rise to the level\n       of proof beyond a reasonable doubt for, among other reasons,\n       she argued with him, she went after him after he left, she was\n       throwing stuff out of the apartment, showing that she had her\n       own aggressive behavior. Fair?\n\n       [Defense Counsel]: Yes, Your Honor. In addition to that, I\n       would ask you to acknowledge her demeanor and the fact that\n       she showed up for court several hours later, because \u2013 she\n       showed up for court several hours late.\n\n                                      ***\n\n       I [am] not going to go through everything that you just heard\n       because we have all been sitting here all morning, but I would\n       submit to the court that when you are looking at cases like this,\n       you have to look at the credibility of all the witnesses, and I\n       would say not just [the victim.]\n\n       The court: All right. [Assistant District Attorney] Stelzer, your\n       witness is a little shaky. That [is] what \u2013 [defense counsel]\n       says your witness is shaky to the point where I should not rely\n       on her testimony, which I have to do to find him guilty of the\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fJ-A02023-23\n\n\n        strangulation, the robbery, the intimidation and the assault.\n        What do you think?\n\nN.T. Trial, 4/7/21, at 122-124 (superfluous capitalization omitted). Thus, it is\n\nevident that, in making the statement that the victim was a \u201cshaky witness,\u201d\n\nthe court was simply summarizing Appellant\u2019s argument, not judging the\n\nvictim\u2019s credibility.\n\n      Moreover, a further review of the record undercuts Appellant\u2019s current\n\nclaim of prejudice because, as admitted by Appellant\u2019s counsel during trial,\n\nthe photographs in question depicted injuries attested to by the victim, as well\n\nas Detective Macioce.     See N.T. Trial, 4/7/21, at 73 (Appellant\u2019s counsel\n\nagreeing with the court\u2019s statement that the photographs \u201conly show what\n\nyou already heard about, not a different injury\u201d); see also id. at 72 (the court\n\nasking if the photographs showed \u201cthe bruises that the witness already\n\nidentified\u201d and included the \u201cones on her hand and arm, the bite mark, that\n\nkind of thing?\u201d to which the Commonwealth answered in the affirmative).\n\nIndeed, during trial, the victim described the altercation that occurred\n\nbetween her and Appellant, including that he struck her in the head multiple\n\ntimes, \u201cchoked her up against [the bathroom] wall,\u201d \u201cthrew [her] to the\n\nground,\u201d and bit her arm. Id. at 50, 53, 60-61, at 63. In addition, the victim\n\nspecifically described her injuries, stating that she \u201cgot bit . . . had marks on\n\n[her] face, the side of [her] face, [her] back\u201d and \u201chad scratches on [her]\n\nneck.\u201d Id. at 66. The victim also showed a scar from the bite mark during\n\nher testimony.      Id. at 63-64.   Importantly, the victim\u2019s testimony was\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fJ-A02023-23\n\n\n\ncorroborated by Detective Macioce, who explained that he responded to the\n\nscene and observed the injuries to the victim\u2019s head, face, neck and upper\n\nright arm. Id. at 20 and 41-42. Hence, in view of the cumulative nature of\n\nthe photographs, the prejudicial impact of the photographic evidence, if any,\n\nwas de minimus. Accordingly, Appellant\u2019s claim of error fails.\n\n       In Appellant\u2019s second issue, he challenges the legality of his sentence\n\nregarding his conviction for strangulation.6 In particular, Appellant claims that\n\nhis sentence of 36 to 72 months incarceration, followed by an additional five\n\nyears of probation, exceeds the statutory maximum for strangulation.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 21. We agree.\n\n       The relevant standard and scope of review are as follows:\n\n        [T]he determination as to whether the trial court imposed an\n        illegal sentence is a question of law; our standard of review in\n        cases dealing with questions of law is plenary. This case will\n        also necessarily call upon us to engage in statutory\n        construction, which similarly presents a pure question of law\n        and also implicates the legality of [the] sentence. Thus, our\n        standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is\n        plenary.\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n6 In general, issues not properly raised and preserved before the trial court\n\u201care waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d Pa.R.A.P.\n302(a). \u201cA challenge that implicates the legality of an appellant's sentence,\nhowever, is an exception to this issue preservation requirement.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Thorne, 276 A.3d 1192, 1196 (Pa. 2022). \u201cStated\nsuccinctly, an appellate court can address an appellant's challenge to the\nlegality of his sentence even if that issue was not preserved in the trial court;\nindeed, an appellate court may [even] raise and address such an issue sua\nsponte.\u201d Id.; Commonwealth v. Hill, 238 A.3d 399, 407 (Pa. 2020). Hence,\nbecause Appellant challenges the legality of his sentence, his failure to raise\nthe claim by way of post-sentence motion does not preclude our review.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fJ-A02023-23\n\n\n\nCommonwealth v. Hunt, 220 A.3d 582, 585 (Pa. Super. 2019) (internal\n\ncitations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n       It is well-settled that a sentencing court \u201cmay imposed a split sentence\n\nincluding both incarceration and probation.\u201d     Commonwealth v. Eid, 249\n\nA.3d 1030, 1036 (Pa. 2021) (citation omitted). \u201cWhen determining the lawful\n\nmaximum allowable on a split sentence, [however,] the time originally\n\nimposed cannot exceed the statutory maximum.\u201d             Commonwealth v.\n\nCrump, 995 A.2d 1280-1283 (Pa. Super. 2010). \u201cThus, where the maximum\n\nis ten years, a defendant cannot receive a term of incarceration of three to six\n\nyears followed by five years probation.\u201d Id.\n\n       Herein, the trial court sentenced Appellant to 36 to 72 months\u2019\n\nincarceration, followed by a five-year term of probation, for his strangulation\n\nconviction, a felony of the second degree. Hence, the trial court imposed a\n\nmaximum sentence of 132 months (11 years), which exceeds the statutory\n\nmaximum. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 106(b)(3) (\u201cA crime is a felony of the second\n\ndegree if it is so designated in this title or if a person convicted thereof may\n\nbe sentenced to a term of imprisonment, the maximum of which is not more\n\nthan ten years.\u201d). As such, the trial court imposed an illegal sentence under\n\nSection 106(b)(3).7\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n7  Both the Commonwealth and the trial court agreed with Appellant\u2019s\ncontention that he received an illegal sentence with respect to his conviction\nfor strangulation. See Trial Court Opinion, 1/18/22, at 4-5; see also\nCommonwealth\u2019s Brief at 17-18.\n\n                                           -9-\n\fJ-A02023-23\n\n\n\n      Based upon the foregoing, we vacate Appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence\n\nwith respect to his strangulation conviction and remand for resentencing. In\n\nall other respects, we affirm.\n\n      Judgment of sentence affirmed, in part, and vacated, in part.    Case\n\nremanded. Jurisdiction relinquished.\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
