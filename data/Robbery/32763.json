Appeal from order denying motion to withdraw plea of guilty, dismissed. Such an order is not appealable directly but may be reviewed only on an appeal from a judgment of conviction. Order denying application to vacate judgment, affirmed (People v. Esposito, 287 N. Y. 389; People v. Smyth, 3 N Y 2d 184). Beldoek, P. J., Ughetta, Brennan, Hill and Hopkins, JJ., concur.\n",
