Dissatisfied with the response to his petition for a declaratory order, the prisoner\nfiled a petition for a declaratory judgment in the Chancery Court for Davidson County, asserting that\nthe extension of his release eligibility date violated the Department\u2019s policy regarding punishment\nfor escape and the terms of his plea agreement. He also claimed that the Department had wrongfully\ndeprived him of sentence reduction credits. The trial court dismissed the petition, and the prisoner\nhas appealed. We affirm.\n\n     Tenn. R.

Based on a plea bargain, he was ordered to serve his three sentences\nconcurrently. Thus, his total effective sentence for these three crimes was twelve years. Mr. Rooker\nwas paroled in March 1987 but soon resumed his life of crime. He was convicted of second degree\nmurder and attempted prescription forgery and received consecutive sentences of twenty years and\none year respectively. These two sentences were ordered to run consecutively with his original 1985\nsentences.\n\n       Mr. Rooker resumed serving his original 12-year sentence from 1985 when he returned to\nprison. In June 1990, he escaped from the Turney Center before he had completed serving that\nsentence. He was recaptured in a matter of days. As a result of this escapade, Mr. Rooker was\nconvicted of felony escape and was also charged with violating prison disciplinary rules. He was\n\fsentenced to one year for the felony escape. As punishment for the disciplinary offense, the\nDepartment extended the release eligibility date on the sentences he was already serving by twenty\npercent pursuant to Tenn. Dep\u2019t Corr. Policy Index No. 502.02 (1996) (superseded 2000).\n\n        Mr. Rooker did not agree with the Department\u2019s application of Policy No. 502.02 because\nhe believed that it violated the plea agreement on his second degree murder conviction and because\nhe believed that he was being wrongfully deprived of approximately one year\u2019s worth of sentence\ncredits that he had already earned. As he saw it, the Department exceeded its authority when it\n\u201cextended [his] current offense years past the parole date set by the trial court.\u201d He petitioned the\nDepartment for a declaratory ruling, and the Department eventually provided him with a written\nexplanation regarding its calculation of his release eligibility date.\n\n        In April 1999, Mr. Rooker filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the Chancery Court\nfor Davidson County, challenging the Department\u2019s extension of his release eligibility date and\nalleging that he had been wrongfully deprived of some of his sentence credits. The Department\nresponded by moving to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. Both parties submitted\nmaterials outside the pleadings. In September 1999, the trial court dismissed Mr. Rooker\u2019s petition\nafter finding (1) that the extension of Mr. Rooker\u2019s release eligibility date appropriately\nencompassed all three of his consecutive sentences, (2) that by escaping, Mr. Rooker had forfeited\nany expectation of becoming eligible for parole under the terms of his plea agreement, and (3) that\nMr. Rooker had not been deprived of any sentence credits as a result of his escape. Mr. Rooker has\nappealed.\n\n                                                            II.\n\n        Although the trial court\u2019s final order speaks in terms of granting the Department\u2019s motion\nto dismiss, in reality the motion should be construed as one for summary judgment because the\nparties submitted, and the trial court apparently considered, evidentiary materials beyond the\npleadings.1 Accordingly, we will review the judgment using the principles applicable to reviewing\norders granting motions for summary judgment. Sutton v. Davis, 916 S.W.2d 937, 938 (Tenn. Ct.\nApp. 1995); D. T. McCall & Sons v. Seagraves, 796 S.W.2d 457, 459-60 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990).\n\n        The standards for reviewing summary judgments on appeal are well-settled. A summary\njudgment is proper in virtually any civil case that can be resolved on the basis of legal issues alone.\nFruge v. Doe, 952 S.W.2d 408, 410 (Tenn. 1997); Byrd v. Hall, 847 S.W.2d 208, 210 (Tenn. 1993);\nChurch v. Perales, 39 S.W.3d 149, 156 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000). Because a summary judgment\ninvolves an issue of law rather than an issue of fact, Planters Gin Co. v. Federal Compress &\nWarehouse Co., 78 S.W.3d 885, 889 (Tenn. 2002), an order granting a summary judgment is not\nentitled to a presumption of correctness on appeal. Pero\u2019s Steak & Spaghetti House v. Lee, 90\nS.W.3d 614, 620 (Tenn. 2002); Scott v. Ashland Healthcare Ctr., Inc., 49 S.W.3d 281, 285 (Tenn.\n2001).\n\n\n         1\n           Tr ial courts must co nvert T enn. R . Civ. P. 12.0 2(6) motions to T enn. R . Civ. P. 56 m otions if they do not\nexclude extraneous evidentiary ma terials sub mitted by either party. Souder v. Health Partners, Inc., 997 S.W.2d 140,\n144 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1998 ); Pacific Eastern Corp. v. Gulf Life Holding Co., 902 S.W .2d 946, 952 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995 ).\nIn this case, both parties subm itted evid entiary m aterials for the co urt\u2019s consideration.\n\n                                                            -2-\n\f        Appellate courts do not employ the standard of review in Tenn. R. App. P. 13(d) when\nreviewing an order granting a summary judgment. Mason v. Seaton, 942 S.W.2d 470, 472 (Tenn.\n1997); Estate of Kirk v. Lowe, 70 S.W.3d 77, 79-80 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001). Rather, we determine\nfor ourselves whether the moving party has satisfied the requirements of Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56. Hunter\nv. Brown, 955 S.W.2d 49, 50-51 (Tenn. 1997); Cantrell v. DeKalb County, 78 S.W.3d 902, 905\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 2001). In this process, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the nonmoving party and resolve all inferences in the nonmoving party's favor. Godfrey v. Ruiz,\n90 S.W.3d 692, 695 (Tenn. 2002); Johnson v. LeBonheur Children\u2019s Med. Ctr., 74 S.W.3d 338, 342\n(Tenn. 2002).\n\n        Once the moving party demonstrates that it has satisfied Tenn. R. Civ. P. 56\u2019s requirements,\nthe non-moving party must demonstrate how these requirements have not been satisfied. Bain v.\nWells, 936 S.W.2d 618, 622 (Tenn. 1997). Mere conclusory generalizations will not suffice. Psillas\nv. Home Depot, U.S.A., Inc., 66 S.W.3d 860, 864 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001). Non-moving parties may\ndeflect a summary judgment motion challenging their ability to prove an essential element of their\ncase by (1) pointing to evidence either overlooked or ignored by the moving party that creates a\nfactual dispute, (2) rehabilitating evidence challenged by the moving party, (3) producing additional\nevidence that creates a material factual dispute, or (4) submitting an affidavit in accordance with\nTenn. R. Civ. P. 56.07 requesting additional time for discovery. Staples v. CBL & Assocs., Inc., 15\nS.W.3d 83, 89 (Tenn. 2000); McCarley v. West Quality Food Serv., 960 S.W.2d 585, 588 (Tenn.\n1998). A non-moving party who fails to carry its burden faces summary dismissal of the challenged\nclaim because, as our courts have repeatedly observed, the \u201cfailure of proof concerning an essential\nelement of the cause of action necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.\u201d Alexander v. Memphis\nIndividual Practice Ass\u2019n, 870 S.W.2d 278, 280 (Tenn. 1993); Strauss v. Wyatt, Tarrant, Combs,\nGilbert & Milom, 911 S.W.2d 727, 729 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995).\n\n                                          III.\n             THE APPLICATION O F TENN. DEP\u2019T CORR . POLICY INDEX NO . 502.02\n\n        Mr. Rooker\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that the Department misconstrued and\nmisapplied its own policy by extending the cumulative release date applicable to his three\nconsecutive sentences. He insists that the Department should have extended the release eligibility\ndate for only the 12-year sentence he was serving when he escaped. According to Mr. Rooker, the\nDepartment should not have altered the release ineligibility periods for his two consecutive sentences\nfor second degree murder and attempted prescription forgery.\n\n         Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-501(c) (1997) provides that Range I standard offenders like Mr.\nRooker will ordinarily be eligible for release from incarceration to parole \u201cafter service of thirty\npercent of the actual sentence imposed less sentence credits earned and retained.\u201d That release\neligibility date, however, is not absolute. It is conditioned on the prisoner\u2019s good behavior while in\nprison. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-501(k). If an offender escapes while incarcerated, his or her\nrelease eligibility date is pushed back \u201cso as to increase the total amount of time an inmate must\nserve before becoming eligible for parole.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-501(k).\n\n        For disciplinary infractions such as escape, the Tennessee General Assembly has delegated\nto the Commissioner of Correction discretion to promulgate regulations to lengthen the amount of\n\n                                                 -3-\n\ftime a prisoner must serve before becoming parole eligible. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-501(k). The\nDepartment\u2019s regulation on that subject, Tenn. Dep\u2019t Corr. Policy Index No. 502.02, provides:\n\n                   In all cases in which an inmate is found guilty of the disciplinary\n                   offense of escape, including escape from custody and failure to return\n                   from a pass or furlough, in addition to any other punishment imposed,\n                   the offender\u2019s parole or release eligibility date shall be extended by\n                   adding thereto an additional twenty percent (20%) of the offender\u2019s\n                   original maximum sentence, or by extending the inmate\u2019s parole or\n                   release eligibility date to the sentence expiration date, whichever is\n                   less.\n\n        In the simplest case \u2013 where a prisoner is serving a single sentence for one offense \u2013 the\napplication of the Department\u2019s regulation punishing escape is straightforward. In that circumstance,\nthe prisoner has one sentence with its accompanying release eligibility date which the Department\ncan push back by twenty percent. But what about when a prisoner is serving multiple consecutive\nsentences? As a matter of law, the prisoner is not serving all those sentences simultaneously but\nrather is serving them one at a time in series. Kay v. United States, 279 F. 2d 734, 735 (6th Cir.\n1960). Under consecutive sentencing the prisoner serves the appropriate amount of time on each\nsentence and then begins to serve the next sentence until all the consecutive sentences have been\nserved. Howell v. State, 569 S.W.2d 428, 431-32 (Tenn. 1978).\n\n        Even under consecutive sentencing, though there may be multiple sentences, there is only one\nrelease eligibility date. A prisoner\u2019s release eligibility date is the earliest date that he or she will be\neligible for release or parole as determined by time served and any sentence credits. Tenn. Code\nAnn. \u00a7 40-35-501(k); Tenn. Dep\u2019t Corr. Policy Index No. 505.01(IV)(L) (2001). A prisoner serving\nconsecutive sentences is not eligible for early release until he or she has served the required amount\nof time on all of the separate sentences. Good behavior may give a prisoner a head start on\nbeginning the next consecutive sentence; however, even in that case, no release from custody can\noccur until after completion of an appropriate amount of time on the last consecutive sentence.\nAccordingly, Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-501(j) expressly provides that for consecutive sentences, the\nperiods of ineligibility for release are calculated for each sentence then added together to establish\nthe \u201crelease eligibility date for the consecutive sentences.\u201d\n\n        Under the Department\u2019s policy, it is the \u201crelease eligibility date for the consecutive\nsentences\u201d that shall be extended as punishment for escape. That is exactly what the Department did\nhere. Counting Mr. Rooker\u2019s original 12-year sentence, as well as his subsequent consecutive 20-\nyear and 1-year sentences, he started out with an effective sentence of thirty-three years to be served\nat thirty percent before he would become release eligible. After convicting Mr. Rooker of the\ndisciplinary offense of escape, the Department lengthened his release eligibility date by twenty\npercent. Consequently, he must serve fifty percent of his thirty-three years before he will be eligible\nfor parole from custody. 2\n\n\n\n        2\n            Mr. Rooker may, of course, reduce ev en this time through earning sentence reduction credits.\n\n                                                          -4-\n\f        The Department\u2019s actions in this case follow both the language and the obvious intent of\nTenn. Dep\u2019t Corr. Policy Index No. 502.02. Therefore, we reject Mr. Rooker\u2019s argument that the\nDepartment should have extended his ineligibility for release only on his original 12-year sentence.\nMr. Rooker\u2019s release eligibility date was not pegged just to that sentence; it was a function of his\ntotal effective sentence which included his other consecutive sentences for second degree murder\nand attempted prescription forgery. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment for the\nDepartment.3\n\n                                             IV.\n                      THE ALLEGED BREACH OF THE PLEA BARGAIN AGREEMENT\n\n        Mr. Rooker also insists that the Department violated the State\u2019s plea agreement by extending\nhis parole eligibility date. This argument is just plain wrong. When Mr. Rooker entered his plea\nagreement on the second degree murder charge, he was on notice that his release eligibility date was\nconditioned on good behavior and that it could be deferred for violation of prison rules. Tenn. Code\nAnn. \u00a7 40-35-501. The State is under no obligation to spell out to criminal defendants all the\npossible consequences of misbehavior behind the walls. The Department unquestionably has the\nauthority to extend a prisoner\u2019s release eligibility date for violation of disciplinary rules. As long\nas the Department\u2019s action does not lengthen the sentence itself, the Department\u2019s decision to extend\na prisoner\u2019s release eligibility date does not violate a plea bargain agreement. Britt v. Campbell,\nM2000-01423-COA-R3-CV, 2001 WL 605104, at *2-3 (Tenn. Ct. App. June 5, 2001), perm. app.\ndenied (Tenn. Oct. 29, 2001); Smith v. Campbell, 995 S.W.2d 116, 117-19 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1999);\nTaylor v. Reynolds, 914 S.W.2d 516, 518 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1995); Rowland v. Bradley, 899 S.W.2d\n614, 615 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1994).\n\n                                            V.\n                   THE ALLEGED DEPRIVATION OF SENTENCE REDUCTION CREDITS\n\n       As a final matter, Mr. Rooker asserts that the Department removed some of his sentence\nreduction credits when it punished him for escaping. The record refutes that contention. While the\nprison disciplinary committee\u2019s judgment document shows that the committee recommended\nextending Mr. Rooker\u2019s release eligibility date, it shows just as clearly that the board did not\nrecommend taking away any of his sentence reduction credits. The Department\u2019s March 1999\nresponse to Mr. Rooker\u2019s request for a declaratory order confirmed that it had not reduced his\nsentence reduction credits. The Department wrote:\n\n                   A record verification by Sentence Information Services (SIS)\n                   personnel reveals that no credits were removed due to the Escape\n                   felony. The only adjustment was an extension of the Release\n                   Eligibility Date (RED) by 20%. In addition, case # 8405661 and case\n                   # 8705339 were extended by 20% as well due to escape.\n\n\n\n\n         3\n           W e may affirm on different reaso ning than that relied on by the trial court. Continental Cas. Co. v. Sm ith, 720\nS.W .2d 4 8, 50 (Te nn. 19 86); GR W E nters., In c. v. Davis, 797 S.W .2d 606, 612 n.5 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1990 ).\n\n                                                            -5-\n\f               The 62 Prisoner Performance Sentence Credits (PPSC) and 491\n               Prisoner Sentence Reduction Credits (PSRC) were credited to cases\n               # 8405660, # 8405661 and # 8500938 on 4/1/85.\n\n               Finally, case # 8705339 is consecutive to #8405661 and begins at\n               Expiration (EXP) which was 5/14/94. Also, 896 PSRC and 309\n               Pretrial Jail Credits (PTJC) have been applied to your sentence\n               calculation. Thus, your current sentence structure is valid and correct.\n\n        Mr. Rooker essentially asserts that the Department\u2019s calculation must be \u201cflawed\u201d because\nthe sentence expiration date for his original 1984 concurrent sentences plus his two subsequent\nconsecutive sentences does not seem mathematically correct to him. He also points out that the\nDepartment has provided him with three different sentence summaries containing a different\nexpiration date for his 33-year effective sentence.\n\n        The difference in the sentence summaries, without more, is not prima facie evidence that the\nDepartment has removed or withheld or miscalculated or misapplied Mr. Rooker\u2019s sentence credits.\nThese were prepared at different times. In fact, two of them were generated nine years apart. Over\ntime, Mr. Rooker has been earning sentence credits, and those credits have had the effect of\nhastening his sentence expiration date. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-21-236(b) & (j) (1997); Rowell v.\nDutton, 688 S.W.2d 474, 476 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1985). The sentence summaries show different\nsentence expiration dates because they reflect the different amounts of sentence credits Mr. Rooker\nhad earned during his incarceration. Mr. Rooker must point to something else to create a dispute of\nfact precluding summary judgment on this issue.\n\n        Under the heading \u201cPrecise Relief Sought,\u201d Mr. Rooker asks this court to \u201crestore (421)\nsentence reduction credits to the Appellant\u2019s sentence summary.\u201d This record provides us with no\nbasis for finding that he has been deprived of any of his sentence reduction credits. We accordingly\naffirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of this part of Mr. Rooker\u2019s declaratory judgment complaint.\n\n                                                  IV.\n\n         We affirm the judgment dismissing the petition for declaratory judgment and remand the case\nto the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We tax the costs of this appeal\nto Charles Wayne Rooker for which execution, if necessary, may issue. We also find that Mr.\nRooker\u2019s complaint and subsequent appeal are frivolous in accordance with Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-\n21-807(c) (Supp.2002) and Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-21-816(a)(1) (1997).\n\n\n\n                                               _____________________________\n                                               WILLIAM C.
