B11976-9503; HON. ED SELF, PRESIDING\n\n\n\n_______________________________\n\n\n\nBefore QUINN and REAVIS, JJ., and BOYD, S.J. \n(footnote: 1)\n\tThis is an appeal from the revocation of community supervision (probation) originally granted appellant Lindman Williams Opdyke. \u00a0On August 16, 1995, appellant pled guilty to the offense of robbery and was sentenced to a ten year probated term in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and a fine of $10,000. \u00a0On December 17, 2002, upon his plea of true to the allegations contained in the State\u2019s motion to revoke probation, appellant was sentenced to ten years confinement. \u00a0From this conviction, appellant gave a timely notice of appeal.\n\nAppellant\u2019s appellate counsel has now filed an \nAnders\n brief with this court in which he states he has thoroughly examined the trial record and determined the appeal to be without merit. \u00a0\nSee Anders v. California\n, 386 U.S. 738, 744-45, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 18 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1967); \nHigh v. State\n, 573 S.W.2d 807, 809-11 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978). \u00a0Appellant indicates that he has mailed a copy of the brief to appellant. \u00a0He has also asked to be allowed to withdraw from the case.\n\nOn November 7, 2003, our clerk notified appellant of our receipt of the \nAnders\n brief and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and that appellant had a right to respond to the brief. \u00a0By letter dated November 25, 2003, appellate counsel certified that he had forwarded to appellant his copy of the record and enclosed appellant\u2019s \npro se \nmotion for extension of time within which to file a \npro se\n brief. \u00a0\nAppellant\u2019s motion to extend was granted and the time within which he might file his \npro se\n brief was extended to January 5, 2004. \u00a0However, we have not received a \npro se\n brief or any further motions seeking an extension of time within which to file such a brief. \n\nBefore allowing counsel to withdraw, we must first satisfy ourselves that the attorney has provided the client with a diligent and thorough search of the record for any arguable claim that might support the client\u2019s appeal, and then we must determine whether counsel has correctly concluded the appeal is frivolous. \u00a0\nSee McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, \n486 U.S. 429, 442, 108 S. Ct. 1895, 100 L. Ed. 2d 440 (1988). \u00a0We have also made an independent examination of the record to determine whether there are any arguable grounds that might support the appeal. \u00a0\nSee Penson v. Ohio, \n488\n \nU.S. 75, 83, 109 S. Ct. 346, 102 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1988);\n \nStafford v. State\n, 813 S.W.2d 503, 511 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991). \u00a0We have found no such ground and agree with counsel that this appeal is without merit and is frivolous. \u00a0\nCurrie v. State\n, 516 S.W.2d 684 (Tex. Crim. App. 1974).\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.\n\n\n\nJohn T. Boyd\n\nSenior Justice\n\n\n\nDo not publish. \u00a0\n\nFOOTNOTES\n1:John T. Boyd, Chief Justice (Ret.), Seventh Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment. \u00a0Tex.
