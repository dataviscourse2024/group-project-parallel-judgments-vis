assessed, for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon,\r\ninjury to an elderly person, and aggravated robbery, arising from his role in\r\nthe botched attempt to steal thousands of dollars from Hollis Ellis, an elderly\r\nperson, who was repeatedly struck in the head with a hammer by Rebecca\r\nCleveland on December 9, 2008.[2]\u00a0 We affirm the judgment of the trial court\r\nbecause McCrary\u2019s convictions do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the\r\nFifth Amendment to the United States Constitution[3] and\r\nbecause McCrary was not entitled to the inclusion of certain purported lesser-included\r\noffenses in the charge of the court.\r\n\r\nI.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FACTS AND

weapon,\r\ninjury to an elderly person, and aggravated robbery, committed against the same\r\nvictim on the same date.\u00a0 The jury charge\r\nauthorized the jury to convict McCrary of all three offenses, which it did. \u00a0The jury assessed punishment at fifteen years\u2019\r\nimprisonment in the Texas Department of Corrections\u2013Institutional Division\u2014for\r\nthe aggravated assault conviction, thirty years\u2019 imprisonment for the injury to\r\nan elderly person conviction, and twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment for the\r\naggravated robbery conviction.\u00a0 All sentences\r\nare to run concurrently.\u00a0 McCrary\r\ncontends on appeal that he could not be punished for all three offenses\r\nconsistent with the Fifth Amendment prohibition against double jeopardy.\u00a0 He further contends the trial court erred in\r\nfailing to submit certain lesser-included charges to the jury for\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nevidence at trial showed that during the afternoon hours of December 9, 2008,\r\nEric Cleveland and his wife, Rebecca, along with McCrary, traveled to Ellis\u2019\r\nhome in Houston County, Texas, with the intention of robbing Ellis of the\r\nthousands of dollars he was known to routinely carry in his pants pocket.\u00a0 The three planned the robbery the preceding\r\nday, and determined that Rebecca would hit Ellis with a hammer she had hidden\r\nin the sleeve of her pullover jacket, take his money, and leave.[4]\u00a0 McCrary was to attack Jimmy Lenox[5]\r\nif he got in the way and Cleveland was to act as a lookout and drive the\r\ncar.\u00a0 As they arrived at Ellis\u2019 house,\r\nMcCrary grabbed the hammer and told Rebecca to hit Ellis with it, but not to\r\nkill him.\u00a0 Rebecca told Lenox, who\r\nanswered the door, that she was having car trouble and asked him to

(holding that defendant\u2019s prosecution for\r\nrobbery twice when two victims were assaulted in course of committing theft did\r\nnot violate Double Jeopardy Clause).\u00a0\r\nBecause aggravated robbery is an assaultive offense, with the unit of\r\nprosecution being one victim (as is the case for aggravated assault), the\r\ncommon focus of each offense in conjunction with the fact that the common focus\r\ntends to indicate a single instance of conduct, are indicia of legislative\r\nintent not to permit multiple punishments in this

offenses\u201d for purposes of double jeopardy has not been\r\nwidely explored in caselaw.\u00a0 In fact, Ervin is the only reported case that has\r\npositively determined this factor.\u00a0 In\r\nthat case, the court concluded that manslaughter and intoxication manslaughter\r\nare the same offense for double jeopardy purposes when they involve the same\r\nvictim, and imposing convictions for both violates the Double Jeopardy\r\nClause.\u00a0 Ervin, 991 S.W.2d at 817.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In\r\narriving at this conclusion, the court recognized that the statute defining\r\nintoxication manslaughter does not include a mental state,[12]\r\nwhile the statute defining manslaughter requires a mental state of \u201crecklessly.\u201d[13]\r\nIn finding the two offenses were nevertheless the \u201csame offense\u201d for double\r\njeopardy purposes, the Ervin court\r\nfound that intoxication manslaughter can be viewed as having the element of\r\nrecklessness by imputation, thus making the offenses the same under the\r\nliberalized, \u201cimputation\u201d version of the Blockburger\r\ntest (finding that intoxication was an imputed form of recklessness).\u00a0 Id.\r\nat 816.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ervin involved the imputation of a\r\nculpable mental state.\u00a0 Here, the\r\ndiffering element is the degree of bodily injury.\u00a0 While imputation of a culpable mental state\r\nin Ervin made logical sense, we see\r\nno logic in imputing the element of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d in the charge of\r\naggravated robbery when that charge already includes the element of \u201cbodily\r\ninjury.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Logic\r\nwould seem to dictate, however, that because the proof at trial established\r\nthat Ellis suffered serious bodily injury,[14] such\r\nproof should be sufficient to answer the issue at hand.\u00a0 To take into account such proof, however,\r\nwould require the application of the \u201ccognate evidence\u201d analysis, an approach\r\nin which the court includes the facts adduced at trial in its lesser-included\r\noffense analysis.\u00a0 Hall, 225 S.W.3d at 526.[15] \u00a0Because we are bound to apply the cognate\r\npleadings approach to lesser-included offenses, we find that aggravated assault\r\nin this case is not a lesser-included offense of aggravated robbery.\u00a0 See id.\r\nat 535. \u00a0To conclude otherwise would\r\nrequire a finding of legislative intent not to permit multiple punishments for\r\neach offense alleged, when we remain unconvinced of such intent.\u00a0 While double jeopardy precludes a defendant\r\nfrom being punished twice for the same offense, it does not prevent a second\r\npunishment for the same conduct.\u00a0 E.g.,\r\nBlockburger, 284 U.S. at 303\u201304 (holding two convictions for one sale of\r\nnarcotics that violated two statutory provisions did not violate double\r\njeopardy).\u00a0 Accordingly, we
