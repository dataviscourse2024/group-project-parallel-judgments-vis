            "opinion_text": "\nBranch, Judge.\nOn appeal from his conviction for aggravated assault, obstruction, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, Johnny Mack Johnson argues that the evidence was insufficient and that the trial court should have suppressed all references to the gun recovered from his home. Johnson also argues that the charge to the jury was erroneous in a number of respects and that counsel should have withdrawn from representation because his office had previously represented two victims in the case. We find no error and affirm.\n\u201cOn appeal from a criminal conviction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, with the defendant no longer enjoying a presumption of innocence.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Reese v. State, 270 Ga. App. 522, 523 (607 SE2d 165) (2004). We neither weigh the evidence nor judge the credibility of witnesses, but determine only whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a \u201crational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 319 (III) (B) (99 SC 2781, 61 LE2d 560) (1979).\nSo viewed, the record shows that on the night of October 21,2007, Corey McKeller reported his brother\u2019s car stolen from a street where Johnson lived. The police told McKeller to wait for them at the location of the alleged theft. McKeller did so and was sitting in his car with his infant daughter in the back seat when Johnson arrived. Sarrain Cook, a friend of McKeller, was also out looking for McKeller\u2019s brother\u2019s car and arrived as a passenger in a car driven by Kevin *162Toomer, a friend of both Cook and McKeller. Cook got out of the car and asked Johnson, the ex-husband of Cook\u2019s grandmother, what had happened to McKeller\u2019s brother\u2019s car. Johnson responded, \u201cBoy, I told you when I see you, I was going to get you.\u201d When Cook responded that he was not a boy, Johnson pulled out a handgun and fired three shots: the first at the car in which Cook had been a passenger, a second after climbing on top of the same car as Cook hid behind, and a third as Cook fled down the street. Cook ran to a house with an open door, asked the occupants to call the police, and ran back to the car in which he had arrived, which picked him up and left the scene.\nMcKeller, who had remained in his own car, yelled out to Cook and Johnson that he had called the police. As McKeller drove away, Johnson shot at McKeller\u2019s car as well. When an arriving police officer told Johnson to place his hands behind his back, Johnson refused and had to be pepper-sprayed by a second officer. A shell casing of unspecified caliber was recovered from the street where the shootings took place.\nJohnson was charged with aggravated assault each as to McKeller, his infant daughter, and Cook (Counts 1, 2, and 3); obstruction (Count 4); and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon (Count 5). Johnson filed a motion to suppress evidence including a .25-caliber pearl-handled silver revolver found at his house after his arrest. At the outset of the hearing on the motion, the State conceded that the search of Johnson\u2019s home yielding the handgun was illegal. The trial court then suppressed \u201cany evidence . . . seized at that time.\u201d\nAt the outset of trial, the court noted that although the State was free to elicit eyewitness descriptions of the gun Johnson used in the shooting at issue, the State could make \u201cno reference to the source of the gun,\u201d and that \u201cnothing can be introduced into evidence that was seized\u201d during the illegal search of Johnson\u2019s house. Johnson\u2019s counsel did not object to this ruling.\nAt trial, McKeller described the gun he saw Johnson use in the shooting as \u201ca little silver\u201d handgun with \u201cpearl handles\u201d on its sides. McKeller also described a prior incident in the spring of2007 in which Johnson threatened McKeller, Cook, and Toomer with the same .25-caliber pearl-handled silver handgun and shot at Toomer\u2019s car twice while Cook was a passenger in it. Johnson\u2019s ex-wife also testified that she had seen a silver pearl-handled handgun in early 2007 when she was cleaning out Johnson\u2019s mother\u2019s home after her death and that Johnson had taken the handgun at that time.\n*163The jury acquitted Johnson of the aggravated assault on the infant but found him guilty of the remaining charges. He was convicted and sentenced to 46 years to serve. His motion for new trial was denied.\n1. In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence against him, Johnson attacks the credibility of McKeller, Cook, and Johnson\u2019s ex-wife on the basis of the prior difficulties between him and all of these witnesses. But such matters of credibility are for the jury, and not this Court, to decide. As such, the evidence outlined above was sufficient to sustain Johnson\u2019s conviction. SeeOCGA \u00a7\u00a7 16-5-21 (defining aggravated assault), 16-10-24 (a) (defining misdemeanor obstruction), 16-11-131 (b) (defining possession of a firearm by a convicted felon); Jackson, supra.\n2. On appeal, Johnson argues for the first time that all references to the .25-caliber handgun, including those made by eyewitnesses as to his possession and use of the gun before and at the incident at issue, should have been suppressed as a result of the illegal search of his house conducted afterward. As Johnson himself concedes, however, there is no authority for such a sweeping prohibition. Further, we will not consider a motion to suppress raised for the first time on appeal, let alone one containing constitutional objections. Hatcher v. State, 224 Ga. App. 747, 748-749 (1) (482 SE2d 443) (1997) (\u201cFailing to file a timely motion to suppress amounts to a waiver of even constitutional challenges.\u201d).\n3. Johnson argues that the trial court erred when it refused to charge the jury on (a) simple assault and (b) reckless conduct as lesser included offenses of aggravated assault, and that it also erred when (c) it charged the jury that the State need only prove that a deadly weapon was used in the assaults. Again, we disagree.\n(a) Although Johnson suggests that a charge on the lesser included offense of simple assault was warranted simply because Johnson had been involved in prior disputes with Cook without injuring Cook, Johnson fails to raise a question of fact as to whether he assaulted Cook without a gun in the course of the incident at issue. This Court has repeatedly held that where \u201c \u2018the undisputed evidence shows that [an] assault was committed with a deadly weapon, it is not error to refuse to give a charge on simple assault as a lesser included offense.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Comley v. State, 218 Ga. App. 520, 521 (2) (462 SE2d 432) (1995), quoting Dickerson v. State, 207 Ga. App. 241 (1) (427 SE2d 591) (1993); see also Clark v. State, 191 Ga. App. 386, 387 (3) (381 SE2d 763) (1989). Under these facts, Johnson \u201ceither committed an aggravated assault or none at all. There was no evidence of an attempt to commit an injury not involving a gun.\u201d (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Dickerson, supra at 241 (1). It *164follows that the trial court did not err when it refused to charge the jury on simple assault. Id.\n(b) Johnson also argues that he was entitled to a charge on reckless conduct. We disagree.\nOCGA \u00a7 16-5-60 (b) defines the misdemeanor of reckless conduct as causing bodily harm or endangering the bodily safety of another person \u201cby consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his act or omission will cause harm or endanger the safety of the other person\u201d when \u201cthe disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care which a reasonable person would exercise.\u201d\nAs the State points out, Johnson was acquitted on aggravated assault on the infant, thus mooting any issue concerning reckless conduct as a lesser included offense of that crime. Further, Johnson did not testify, and he has pointed to no evidence suggesting that the gun discharged accidentally. As to the counts against the two adult victims, therefore, the evidence was thus susceptible to only two reasonable conclusions: that Johnson shot at the victims, or that he shot into the air in order to scare them. Neither of these acts was negligent. Bright v. State, 238 Ga. App. 876, 885 (11) (520 SE2d 48) (1999) (neither defendant\u2019s shooting at a victim nor his shooting at a window over victim\u2019s head was a negligent act). As a result, Johnson was \u201ceither guilty of aggravated assault or not under the evidence,\u201d id., and the trial court did not err when it refused an instruction on reckless conduct. Id. (affirming trial court\u2019s refusal to charge on reckless conduct).\n(c) Jones also argues that there was a fatal variance between the trial court\u2019s charge that Jones used a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d in the assaults and the indictment\u2019s specification that he used a .25-caliber handgun.\nIt is true that \u201c[i]f the indictment sets out the offense as done in a particular way, the proof must show it so, or there will be a variance[.]\u201d Jones v. State, 312 Ga. App. 15, 18 (2) (b) (717 SE2d 526) (2011). It is equally true, however, that\n[n]ot every variance in proof from that alleged in the indictment is fatal. The crucial requirements are (1) that the accused be definitely informed as to the charges against him, so that he is able to present his defense, and (2) that he may be protected against another prosecution for the same offense. Unless the variance subjects defendant to one of these dangers it is not fatal.\n(Footnote omitted.) Id. A variance between an indictment naming a particular kind of firearm and proof establishing that a different firearm was actually used is not fatal to a criminal conviction. Id. (no *165fatal variance between an indictment alleging that defendant used a pellet gun and evidence showing that he used a BB gun); Mathis v. State, 299 Ga. App. 831, 833 (1) (a) (684 SE2d 6) (2009) (variance between evidence of a \u201cpellet gun\u201d and the indictment\u2019s \u201chandgun\u201d was not fatal).\nThis indictment, which was read to the jury, specified that Johnson committed the assaults with a .25-caliber handgun, and at least one witness in this case described the gun at issue as a .25-caliber. Accordingly, there was no actual variance, let alone a fatal one, between the allegations in the indictment and the evidence produced at trial. See Jones, supra. Further, Johnson was definitely informed as to the charges against him, and there is no evidence that he is at risk of another prosecution for the same offense.\n4. Finally, Johnson argues that the public defender who eventually defended him at trial suffered from an actual conflict because another attorney in the same public defender\u2019s office had previously represented McKeller and Cook in other matters. We disagree.\nAs Johnson concedes, and because the \u201cmere possibility of conflict is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction,\u201d a defendant has the burden of showing an actual conflict, meaning that there is \u201c \u2018a substantial risk\u2019 \u201d that counsel\u2019s representation of him was \u201c \u2018materially and adversely affected by the lawyer\u2019s own interests or by the lawyer\u2019s duties to another current client, a former client, or a third person.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) Lytle v. State, 290 Ga. 177, 178 (2) (718 SE2d 296) (2011), quoting Burns v. State, 281 Ga. 338, 340, n. 3 (638 SE2d 299) (2006).1\nJohnson points out that the public defender originally representing him had previously represented McKeller and Cook and had therefore agreed to the assignment of new counsel in order to avoid \u201ca potential conflict\u201d as to \u201cwhat witnesses were called\u201d and \u201cwhat information\u201d might be used to impeach either Johnson or the victims. The record of the hearing on Johnson\u2019s motion for new trial shows, however, that the public defender who eventually represented Johnson at trial had never represented either Cook or McKeller, and that Johnson\u2019s first assigned public defender had represented the two men.only in other matters. Johnson\u2019s trial counsel also testified that *166he had not shared any information that would have affected his ability to represent Johnson with any other members of the public defender\u2019s office.\nDecided March 7, 2013.\nJoseph C. T. Lewis, for appellant.\nC. Paul Bowden, District Attorney, for appellee.\nThis record is insufficient to show an actual conflict in that there is no \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that trial counsel\u2019s representation of Johnson in this case was \u201cmaterially and adversely affected\u201d by the first public defender\u2019s representation of McKeller and Cook in other matters. (Punctuation omitted.) Lytle, supra at 178 (2). It follows that the trial court did not err when it denied Johnson\u2019s motion for new trial on this ground.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\n\nMiller, P. J., and Ray, J., concur.\n\n\n Our Supreme Court is currently considering whether \u201cthe rules for imputing conflicts operate within a single circuit public defender office in the same manner as those within a law firm.\u201d State v. Abernathy, 289 Ga. 603, 604 (1) (715 SE2d 48) (2011), citing In re: Formal Advisory Opinion No. 10-1, Case No. S10U1679 (docketed July 1,2010). We need not reach this question because we find no evidence of any actual conflict or adverse effect arising from Johnson\u2019s representation by two members of the same public defender\u2019s office at different times.
