Counsel has also\n\nfiled a Turner/Finley1 \u201cno-merit\u201d letter seeking to withdraw from his\n\nrepresentation of Ransome. After careful review, we grant counsel\u2019s petition\n\nto withdraw and affirm.\n\n        On March 11, 2016, Ransome kicked open the door to the victim\u2019s\n\nresidence, pointed a gun at her head, and struck her in the head with the\n\nfirearm before fleeing the scene.

The victim was treated at a nearby hospital for a\n\nforehead laceration.\n\n         Following a waiver trial, Ransome was found guilty of aggravated\n\nassault, burglary, criminal trespass, simple assault, possession of a firearm\n\nprohibited, firearms not to be carried without a license, carrying a firearm in\n\npublic in Philadelphia, possession of an instrument of crime, and recklessly\n\nendangering another person.            The trial court sentenced Ransome to an\n\naggregate sentence of ten to twenty years in prison, which included a\n\nmandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9714 (\u201ctwo strikes\u201d\n\nlaw).2\n\n         Ransome filed a direct appeal. On appeal, our Court vacated two of\n\nRansome\u2019s firearm convictions after concluding that the Commonwealth did\n\nnot establish the length of the gun Ransome possessed, and affirmed the\n\njudgment of sentence in all other respects. Commonwealth v. Ransome,\n\n201 A.3d 825 (Pa. Super. 2018) (Table).           Ransome filed an unsuccessful\n\npetition for allowance of appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\n\nCommonwealth v. Ransome, 2268 EDA 2017 (Pa. filed April 8, 2019).\n\n         On April 2, 2020, Ransome filed a timely PCRA petition, pro se, and\n\nsupporting memorandum of law, raising claims of ineffective assistance of trial\n\nand appellate counsel for failing to \u201ccontact, interview, or depose [,] call[, or]\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2   Ransome had previously been convicted of robbery.\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S09015-22\n\n\n\nsubpoena witnesses[3] who could have provided testimony that would have\n\nbeen exculpatory to [him].\u201d Pro Se PCRA Petition, 4/2/20, at 3. Specifically,\n\nRansome alleged that these witnesses could attest to the fact that he was the\n\n\u201crent payer\u201d and \u201crental occupant\u201d of the victim\u2019s apartment and, thus, would\n\nprovide a defense to burglary. Id. at 6. William J. Ciancaglini, Esquire, was\n\nappointed as PCRA counsel and filed an amended PCRA petition. On March\n\n25, 2021, the PCRA court issued Pa.R.A.P. 907 notice of its intent to dismiss\n\nRansome\u2019s petition without a hearing. Ransome did not file a response to the\n\nnotice. The PCRA court dismissed Ransome\u2019s petition on June 1, 2021.\n\n       On June 29, 2021, Attorney Ciancaglini was relieved of his duties, and\n\ncurrent counsel, John Belli, Esquire, was appointed to represent Ransome\n\nsolely for the purpose of \u201cpursu[ing] any applicable [collateral] appeal to the\n\nSuperior Court of Pennsylvania.\u201d          Order, 7/29/21.   Ransome filed a timely\n\nnotice of appeal4 and court-ordered Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise statement of\n\nerrors complained of on appeal.\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3 Ransome\u2019s petition listed the following three witnesses: Shirley Ransome\n(Ransome\u2019s mother), Donald Hamilton (the victim\u2019s landlord), and Probation\nOfficer James Smith.\n\n4 On August 9, 2021, our Court issued a rule to show cause (RTSC) as to why\nthe instant appeal should not be quashed \u201chaving been taken from a purported\norder which is not entered upon the appropriate docket pursuant to Pa.R.A.P.\n301(a)(1).\u201d Order, 8/9/21. Counsel filed a response claiming that he\n\u201cinadvertently listed the date of the order appealed from [as] June 30, 2021,\ninstead of June 1, 2021.\u201d Response to RTSC, 8/9/21. Counsel asked that our\nCourt not quash the appeal, see Pa.R.A.P. 902, and either sua sponte correct\nthe defect or issue an order permitting counsel to file an amended notice of\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S09015-22\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\nappeal. On August 10, 2021, our Court entered an order informing the parties\nthat the issue raised in the RTSC \u201cwill be referred to the panel assigned to\ndecide the merits of the appeal.\u201d Per Curiam Order, 9/10/21. On August 11,\n2021, counsel filed an \u201cApplication to Amend Notice of Appeal.\u201d On September\n28, 2021, our Court granted counsel\u2019s application and directed counsel to file\nan amended notice of appeal with our prothonotary within seven days. To\ndate, counsel has not filed an amended notice of appeal. However, on October\n5, 2021, counsel filed a Turner/Finley \u201cno merit\u201d letter with this Court\nindicating that Ransome\u2019s collateral appeal is \u201cwholly lacking in merit and is\nfrivolous.\u201d \u201cNo-Merit\u201d Letter, 10/5/21, at 1. In his letter, counsel notes that\nhe \u201cwas . . . appointed and filed a notice of appeal and a [Rule] 1925(b)\nStatement of Matters\u201d for Ransome. Id. at 4.\n\nWe note that \u201c[i]t is implicit in Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 904,\nwhich governs the content of the notice of appeal, that the correct date of the\norder appealed should be included in the notice of appeal.\u201d Commonwealth\nv. Martin, 462 A.2d 859, 860 (Pa. Super. 1983), overruled on other grounds,\nCommonwealth v. Graves, 508 A.2d 1198 (Pa. 1986). Here, the notice of\nappeal states that the appeal is from the June 30, 2021 order denying post-\nconviction collateral relief. However, the correct date of the order denying\nPCRA relief is June 1, 2021. On that basis alone, we could quash this appeal.\nSee Pa.R.A.P. 904. Nevertheless, we are cognizant of the fact that our rules\nof appellate procedure \u201cshall be liberally construed to secure the just,\nspeedy[,] and inexpensive determination of every matter.\u201d Pa.R.A.P. 105.\nHere, Ransome filed his notice of appeal within 30 days of the date that the\ntrial court filed the order denying his PCRA petition. See Pa.R.A.P. 903 (time\nfor appeal). Notably, Pa.R.A.P. 902 states that the \u201c[f]ailure of an appellant\nto take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not\naffect the validity of the appeal, but it is subject to such action as the appellate\ncourt deems appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, remand of\nthe matter to the lower court so that the omitted procedural step may be\ntaken.\u201d Pa.R.A.P. 902 (emphasis added). Here, it is obvious from Ransome\u2019s\nappellate brief, as well as the criminal docketing statement indicating that he\nis challenging the June 1, 2021 denial of post-conviction relief (and that much\nhas been admitted by counsel in his responses to our Court), that he is seeking\nto appeal the denial of his PCRA petition. Therefore, we decline to quash the\ninstant appeal. See Commonwealth v. Lahoud, 488 A.2d 307 (Pa. Super.\n1985) (where incorrect date listed on order in notice of appeal, because appeal\notherwise proper, our Court treated defect as harmless and considered merits\nof appeal).\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fJ-S09015-22\n\n\n\n      On October 5, 2021, counsel filed a Turner/Finley \u201cno-merit\u201d letter\n\nseeking to withdraw on appeal. In his accompanying brief, counsel raises the\n\nfollowing issue for our consideration:\n\n      [Whether t]he PCRA court abused its discretion, and/or ma[d]e a\n      mistake and/or error of law when it denied [Ransome] an\n      evidentiary hearing and then post-conviction collateral relief on\n      his claim alleging that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance\n      of counsel by failing to call as defense witnesses[,] during\n      [Ransome\u2019s] trial[,] Shirley Ransome[,] Donald Hamilton, and\n      Probation Officer James Smith for the reasons set forth in\n      [Ransome\u2019s] PCRA petition and counsel\u2019s amended petition?\n\nTurner/Finley Brief, 10/5/21, at 5.\n\n      Before we address the merits of Ransome\u2019s issue on appeal, we must\n\nfirst review counsel\u2019s application to withdraw. With regard to withdrawal from\n\nPCRA representation, our Supreme Court has stated that independent review\n\nof the record by competent counsel is required before withdrawal is permitted.\n\nSuch independent review requires proof of: (1) a \u201cno-merit\u201d letter by PCRA\n\ncounsel detailing the nature and extent of his review; (2) the \u201cno-merit\u201d letter\n\nby PCRA counsel listing each issue the petitioner wished to have reviewed; (3)\n\nPCRA counsel\u2019s explanation, in the \u201cno-merit\u201d letter, as to why the petitioner\u2019s\n\nissues are meritless; (4) independent review of the record by the PCRA or\n\nappellate court; and (5) agreement by the PCRA or appellate court that the\n\npetition was meritless. Commonwealth v. Rykard, 55 A.3d 1177, 1184 (Pa.\n\nSuper. 2012).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fJ-S09015-22\n\n\n\n       In Commonwealth v. Friend, 896 A.2d 607 (Pa. Super. 2006),5 this\n\nCourt imposed an additional requirement for counsel seeking to withdraw from\n\ncollateral proceedings:\n\n              PCRA     counsel   who     seeks    to   withdraw     must\n              contemporaneously serve a copy on the petitioner of\n              counsel\u2019s application to withdraw as counsel, and must\n              supply to the petitioner both a copy of the \u201cno-merit\u201d\n              letter and a statement advising the petitioner that, in the\n              event that the court grants the application of counsel to\n              withdraw, he or she has the right to proceed pro se or\n              with the assistance of privately retained counsel.\n\nId. at 614.\n\n       After determining that counsel has satisfied the above technical\n\nrequirements, this Court must then \u201cconduct a simple review of the record to\n\nascertain if there appears on its face to be arguably meritorious issues that\n\ncounsel, intentionally or not, missed or misstated.\u201d        Commonwealth v.\n\nDempster, 187 A.3d 266, 272 (Pa. Super. 2018) (en banc).\n\n       Here, counsel has substantially complied with the Turner/Finley and\n\nFriend requirements.         Counsel has detailed the nature and extent of his\n\nreview, served a copy of his petition to withdraw and brief upon Ransome and\n\ninformed Ransome of his right to proceed pro se or with privately retained\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n5This Court\u2019s holding in Friend was subsequently overruled on other grounds\nby the Supreme Court in Commonwealth v. Pitts, 981 A.2d 875, 876 n.1\n(Pa. 2009). However, the additional requirement that counsel provide copies\nof the relevant documentation to the petitioner remains intact.\nCommonwealth v. Widgins, 29 A.3d 816, 818 (Pa. Super. 2011).\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fJ-S09015-22\n\n\ncounsel,6 raised Ransome\u2019s issues in the form of a brief, and explained why\n\nRansome\u2019s claims are meritless. We now turn to an independent review of\n\nthe record to determine whether Ransome\u2019s claims merit relief.\n\n       \u201cWe review the denial of PCRA relief to decide whether the PCRA court\u2019s\n\nfactual determinations are supported by the record and are free of legal error.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Brown, 196 A.3d 130, 150 (Pa. 2018).             Moreover,\n\n       [w]hen raising a claim of ineffectiveness for the failure to call a\n       potential witness, a petitioner satisfies the performance and\n       prejudice requirements of the [ineffectiveness] test by\n       establishing that: (1) the witness existed; (2) the witness was\n       available to testify for the defense; (3) counsel knew of, or should\n       have known of, the existence of the witness; (4) the witness was\n____________________________________________\n\n\n6 In response to counsel\u2019s request to withdraw, Ransome filed an application\nrequesting that this Court remand the record to the trial court \u201cto develop a\nrecord regarding Attorney Belli\u2019s improper request to withdraw his\nrepresentation in this matter . . . and to analyze whether counsel\u2019s request\nto withdraw is improper.\u201d Application for Relief, 11/3/21, at 2. Specifically,\nRansome alleges that because this is his first PCRA petition, he is entitled to\neffective assistance of counsel \u201cduring the entirety of the proceedings\u201d and\nbecause counsel is seeking to withdraw prior to \u201creceiving a [Rule 1925(a)]\nopinion from Judge Woelpper . . . to determine whether the PCRA [c]ourt\u2019s\nrationale was free of legal or factual error . . . [counsel] has ignored clear and\nconvincing evidence that supports [Ransome\u2019s] claims.\u201d Id. at 3-4.\n\nWhile we look with disfavor upon the court\u2019s failure to file a Rule 1925(a)\nopinion in this appeal, we find that counsel has diligently and conscientiously\nexamined the record and correctly determined that Ransome\u2019s issue lacks\nmerit. Moreover, we note that in Commonwealth v. Bradley, 261 A.3d 381\n(Pa. 2021), our Supreme Court recently abandoned the Rule 907 approach to\npreservation of PCRA counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness claims and held that a\npetitioner may, after a PCRA court denies relief and after obtaining new\ncounsel or acting pro se, raise claims of PCRA counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness at the\nfirst opportunity to do so, even if on appeal. Therefore, Ransome\u2019s reliance\non Pitts, supra, is misplaced, where Pitts\u2019 approach was \u201cabandon[ed]\u201d in\nBradley. Bradley, 261 A.3d at 401. Thus, we deny Ransome\u2019s application\nfor remand.\n\n                                           -7-\n\fJ-S09015-22\n\n\n      willing to testify for the defense; and (5) the absence of the\n      testimony of the witness was so prejudicial as to have denied the\n      defendant a fair trial. To demonstrate [] prejudice, a petitioner\n      must show how the uncalled witnesses\u2019 testimony would have\n      been beneficial under the circumstances of the case. Thus,\n      counsel will not be found ineffective for failing to call a witness\n      unless the petitioner can show that the witness\u2019s testimony would\n      have been helpful to the defense. A failure to call a witness is not\n      per se ineffective assistance of counsel[,] for such decision usually\n      involves matters of trial strategy.\n\nCommonwealth v. Sneed, 45 A.3d 1096, 1108-09 (Pa. 2012) (citations and\n\nquotations omitted).\n\n      Instantly, the trial court stated in its Rule 907 notice that it intended to\n\ndismiss Ransome\u2019s petition, within twenty days, based on the fact that the\n\npetition lacked merit for the following reasons:\n\n      Petitioner claims trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call the\n      following witnesses: (1) Shirley Ransome, (2) Donald Hamilton,\n      and (3) Probation Officer James Smither. Petitioner has failed to\n      establish that he was prejudiced by the absence of the witnesses\u2019\n      testimony. Furthermore, as to Probation Officer James Smith,\n      Petitioner has failed to identify the \u201cother material facts\u201d he would\n      have provided.\n\nRule 907 Notice, 3/25/21. Moreover, even if Ransome was paying the rent\n\nfor the victim\u2019s residence at the time of the incident, Ransome conceded that\n\nhe did not have a key to the residence and that, at the time of the incident,\n\nhe was temporarily living with his mother.         Additionally, Ransome never\n\ntestified that he resided with the victim or that he had the right to enter her\n\nresidence without her permission. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3502(b) (defense to\n\nburglary if \u201cactor is licensed or privileged to enter\u201d). Finally, even if Ransome\u2019s\n\nmother and the victim\u2019s landlord were to testify that Ransome paid rent on\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fJ-S09015-22\n\n\n\nthe victim\u2019s residence, it would not change the fact that he broke down the\n\ndoor to the residence, entered it without the victim\u2019s permission, and struck\n\nher in the head with a gun. Accordingly, we agree with the PCRA court that\n\nRansome could not succeed on an ineffectiveness claim for counsel\u2019s failure to\n\ncall Ransome\u2019s mother and the victim\u2019s landlord where:          (1) the victims\u2019\n\ntestimony would not have been beneficial under the circumstances of the case,\n\nand (2) Ransome cannot show that the witnesses\u2019 testimony would have been\n\nhelpful to the defense. Sneed, supra.\n\n      Finally, with regard to Probation Officer Smith, Ransome contends that\n\nthe officer knew of \u201c[e]vidence of the alleged victim\u2019s prior attempts to have\n\n[Ransome] falsely accused of crimes.\u201d Pro Se PCRA Petition, 5/4/20, at 5.\n\nEven if Probation Officer Smith would have testified that the victim had falsely\n\naccused Ransome of crimes in the past, it would not have been helpful to his\n\ncurrent defense[,] where Ransome denied attacking the victim or even being\n\nin the vicinity of her residence at the relevant time. Again, this ineffectiveness\n\nclaim fails. Id.\n\n      Order affirmed. Petition to withdraw granted.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
