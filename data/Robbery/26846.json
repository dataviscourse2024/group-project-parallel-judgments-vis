No motion for new trial was filed. Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal\nwas not filed until October 1, 2019.\n\n      A defendant\u2019s notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days after sentence is\nimposed when the defendant has not filed a motion for new trial. See Tex. R. App.\n\fP. 26.2(a)(1). A notice of appeal that complies with the requirements of Texas Rule\nof Appellate Procedure 26 is essential to vest the court of appeals with jurisdiction.\nSlaton v. State, 981 S.W.2d 208, 210 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998). If an appeal is not\ntimely perfected, a court of appeals does not obtain jurisdiction to address the\nmerits of the appeal. Under those circumstances it can take no action other than to\ndismiss the appeal. Id.\n\n      Accordingly, we order the appeal dismissed.\n\n\n\n                                       PER CURIAM\n\n\nPanel consists of Justices Jewell, Bourliot, and Zimmerer.\nDo Not Publish \u2014 Tex.
