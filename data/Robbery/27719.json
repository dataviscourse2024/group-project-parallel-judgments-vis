Mendez CA6\n                      NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN OFFICIAL REPORTS\nCalifornia Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(a), prohibits courts and parties from citing or relying on opinions not certified for\npublication or ordered published, except as specified by rule 8.1115(b). This opinion has not been certified for publication\nor ordered published for purposes of rule 8.1115.\n\n\n                IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA\n\n                                      SIXTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\n THE PEOPLE,                                                         H046979\n                                                                    (Santa Clara County\n           Plaintiff and Respondent,                                 Super. Ct. No. C1892782)\n\n           v.\n\n JACQUELINE C. MENDEZ,\n\n           Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         Defendant Jacqueline C. Mendez pleaded no contest to assault by means of force\nlikely to produce great bodily injury and attempted petty theft in exchange for a four-year\nprison sentence. Consistent with the plea agreement, the trial court sentenced defendant\nto a four-year prison term. On appeal, defendant\u2019s counsel filed an opening brief in\nwhich no issues are raised and asked this court to independently review the record under\nPeople v. Wende (1979) 25 Cal.3d 436. We sent a letter to defendant notifying her of her\nright to submit a written argument on her own behalf on appeal. She has not done so.\n         Finding no arguable appellate issue, we affirm. We will provide \u201ca brief\ndescription of the facts and procedural history of the case, the crime[] of which the\ndefendant was convicted, and the punishment imposed,\u201d as required by People v. Kelly\n(2006) 40 Cal.4th 106, 110. We will further include information about aspects of the trial\ncourt proceedings that might become relevant in future proceedings. (Id. at p. 124.)\n\fI.     BACKGROUND1\n       During a June 5, 2018 VTA train ride, defendant yelled at other train passengers.\nShe then approached the victim and hit her in the face multiple times. When the victim\ntried to call 9-1-1 on her cell phone, defendant tried to take the cell phone. Defendant\nwas arrested immediately after the incident. The arresting deputy reported that she\ndisplayed \u201cerratic and belligerent behavior\u201d and yelled \u201cincoherent things.\u201d\n       In June 2018, the Santa Clara County District Attorney charged defendant with\nassault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245,\nsubd. (a)(4); count 1)2 and attempted petty theft (\u00a7\u00a7 664, 488; count 2). The complaint\nfurther alleged that defendant had suffered two prior strike convictions (\u00a7\u00a7 667,\nsubds. (b)-(i); 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)).\n       On August 8, 2018, defendant pleaded no contest to both counts and admitted the\nstrike priors in exchange for a four-year prison sentence. The plea agreement also\nresolved probation violations in four other dockets.\n       At a March 14, 2019 sentencing hearing, the trial court imposed a four-year\nsentence on count 1 (the low term, doubled pursuant to the Three Strikes law) and a\nconcurrent 30 days in county jail on count 2. In connection with count 1, the court\nimposed a $1200 restitution fine (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)) with an additional $1200 parole\nrevocation fine, which was suspended pending successful completion of parole\n(\u00a7 1202.45); a $40 court operations assessment fee (\u00a7 1465.8); a $30 criminal conviction\nassessment fee (Gov. Code, \u00a7 70373); and a $259.50 criminal justice administration fee\nto the county. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 29550). On count 2, the court imposed a $150 restitution\nfine (\u00a7 1202.4, subd. (b)), a $40 court operations assessment fee (\u00a7 1465.8), and a $30\ncriminal conviction assessment fee (Gov. Code, \u00a7 70373). The court stayed all fines and\nfees pending an ability-to-pay determination. The court awarded defendant a total of\n\n       1\n           The facts are taken from the Sheriff\u2019s Office incident report.\n       2\n           All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n\n                                               2\n\f564 days of presentence credits, consisting of 282 days of actual custody and 282 days of\nconduct credits. In the probation matters, the court terminated probation without further\npenalties.\n       Defendant timely appealed.\nII.    DISCUSSION\n       Having examined the entire record, we conclude that there are no arguable issues\non appeal.\nIII.   DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f                                  _________________________________\n                                  ELIA, ACTING P.J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nBAMATTRE-MANOUKIAN, J.\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nDANNER, J.\n\n\n\n\nPeople v.
