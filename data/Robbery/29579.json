            "opinion_text": "\nMONTGOMERY, Judge.\nA jury found Defendant, Barry R. Thur-lo, guilty of the class C felony of burglary in the second degree. \u00a7 569.170.1, RSMo 1986. Defendant was sentenced as a prior and persistent offender to imprisonment for five years. Only a brief recital of the facts is necessary for an understanding of Defendant\u2019s appeal.\nIn the early hours of August 17, 1990, Defendant and an accomplice broke into the Main Street Bar in Webb City, Missouri. Cash was taken from the business and later divided between Defendant and his accomplice. On August 25, 1990, Defendant admitted his involvement in the burglary to Officer Joe Beckett of the Webb City Police. At trial, two alibi witnesses testified for the defense. They recalled that Defendant spent the night at their home on August 16,1990, and to their knowledge Defendant never left during the night.\nDefendant raises two points on appeal. He first complains of the trial court\u2019s failure to declare a mistrial during the prosecutor\u2019s opening remarks. Even though Defendant did not testify, those remarks, according to Defendant, denied him a fair trial because the prosecutor made \u201cindirect references\u201d to him testifying at trial.\nAn appellate court reviews the trial court\u2019s decision not to declare a mistrial only for abuse of discretion. State v. Parker, 476 S.W.2d 513 (Mo.1972). We find no abuse of discretion.\n*892The condemned portion of the prosecutor\u2019s statement appears as follows:\nMS. LUCE: I anticipate the defendant will be putting on a defense. He will be, I anticipate, saying that possibly\u2014\nMR. MAPLES: Objection to speculation, Your Honor\u2014\nTHE COURT: Ms. Luce, approach the bench, please, Mr. Maples.\n[Counsel approached the bench and the following proceedings were had out of the hearing of the Jury]\nTHE COURT: Although the defendant has not objected to this opening statement, Ms. Luce, this is beyond opening statement, you\u2019re now arguing your case. I\u2019m going to ask you to present what you intend to prove and not argue your ease.\nMS. LUCE: I just know he\u2019s using the affirmative defense of an alibi and that\u2014\nTHE COURT: Again, present your opening statement as to what you intend to prove. That\u2019s what an opening statement is.\nMR. MAPLES: Judge, if I could elaborate on my objection as to her speculation, I do object that she\u2019s speculating what we\u2019re going to put on as evidence, she started to say \u201che.\u201d \u201cHe\u201d could only refer to the defendant. And I believe there was a reference to evidence that the defendant is expected to present and could be construed as a reference to the defendant testifying. I object on that basis and it infringes on his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. And I would ask that she be instructed not to refer to that and I would request a mistrial.\nTHE COURT: Your request for mistrial will be overruled. However, your objection will be sustained. And Ms. Luce, you are directed not to make any reference to anything the defense may or may not put on. The purpose of an opening statement is to outline what you believe the State\u2019s evidence will be. And Mr. Maples, do you request the jury be advised to disregard the last comment of the State?\nMR. MAPLES: No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: You do not make that request?\nMR. MAPLES: I do not make that request.\nTHE COURT: Very well, proceed with your opening statement.\n[The proceedings return to open court]\nWe agree with Defendant that a prosecutor is prohibited from commenting on an accused\u2019s failure to testify. State v. Jackson, 750 S.W.2d 644, 648 (Mo.App.1988). Such a comment is in violation of Defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination. State v. Lindsey, 578 S.W.2d 903, 904 (Mo. banc 1979); Art. I, \u00a7 19 Mo.Const. See \u00a7 546.270, RSMo 1986. Furthermore, \u201c[b]oth direct and indirect references to defendants\u2019 [sic] failure to testify are forbidden.\u201d State v. Chunn, 657 S.W.2d 292, 294 (Mo.App.1983).\nTo determine if a forbidden direct reference occurs, \u201conly a comment by the prosecutor which is a direct and certain reference to the failure of the accused to testify would be considered as satisfying the test.\u201d State v. Reed, 583 S.W.2d 531, 534 (Mo.App.1979). \u201cTo constitute an indirect reference, the comment, when viewed in context, must be of a type which would cause a jury to infer that the remark was a reference to the accused\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d Id.\nDefendant argues the prosecutor\u2019s words, \u201cHe will be ... saying ...,\u201d are a clear reference to Defendant testifying. This argument takes the quoted words out of context when the first sentence of the prosecutor\u2019s statement is omitted. Taken in context, the quoted words have reference to the anticipated fact that Defendant would put forth a defense. It is unclear that the prosecutor is referring to Defendant actually testifying. In the bench conference, following Defendant\u2019s objection, the prosecutor specifically referred to Defendant\u2019s alibi defense. The statement could well refer to what Defendant will be \u201csaying\u201d by his defense witnesses. At best, we believe the entire statement of the prosecutor could only be considered in the light of an indirect reference to Defendant testifying.\n*893Because Defendant\u2019s point relates only to an indirect reference, we need only determine the validity of Defendant\u2019s complaint on that basis.\nA direct and certain reference mandates a new trial but an indirect reference only makes the conviction voidable and a new trial is required only when the reference clearly draws the jury\u2019s attention to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\nState v. Bulloch, 785 S.W.2d 753, 755 (Mo.App.1990).\nIn this case, our chore is to determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s remarks clearly drew the jury\u2019s attention to Defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Defendant relies on State v. Jackson, supra (closing remarks held not improper); State v. Chunn, supra (direct reference in closing remarks held improper); and State v. Reed, supra (indirect reference in closing held improper).\nAll three of these cases involve remarks by the prosecutor in closing argument, not in the opening statement. In all of the cases the prosecutors\u2019 remarks were complete statements to the jury, not statements halted by objection. Here, no evidence had been presented when the objectionable remarks were made. In each case cited by Defendant, the defendant\u2019s evidence (or lack thereof) was fresh on the minds of the jury. Further, the prosecutor here was not allowed to complete her attempted remark, but the tenor of her statement related to Defendant\u2019s possible defense. An alibi defense was later squarely presented to the jury. None of Defendant\u2019s cases are factually similar to the present case.\nWe believe the instant case is akin to State v. Haggard, 619 S.W.2d 44 (Mo. banc 1981), vacated on other grounds, 459 U.S. 1192, 103 S.Ct. 1171, 75 L.Ed.2d 423 (1983). There, the prosecutor, in his opening statement, said: \u201c \u2018After all the evidence has been heard, and I assume there will be eight to ten witnesses called by the State, I do not know how many called by the defendant, if any.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 47. The accused\u2019s contention that this was an impermissible comment on his right not to testify was rejected. The Court said: \u201cThe prosecutor in no manner commented upon the failure of the defendant to testify, there having been no opportunity for him to do so.... This was not a comment on the defendant\u2019s right not to testify.\u201d Id.\nOur court has recently decided a similar case, State v. West, 809 S.W.2d 464 (Mo.App.1991). There, the prosecutor\u2019s voir dire statement, \u201c[i]f the defendant would testify,\u201d was determined not to have violated defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination. We said, \u201cWhen considered in context, the statement did not focus upon defendant\u2019s right to refuse to testify.\u201d Id. at 466. See State v. Shanz, 716 S.W.2d 472 (Mo.App.1986), where the Court found the statement \u201cthe defendant may or may not present evidence\u201d did not offend the rule.\nHere, Defendant insisted the court declare a mistrial after the prosecutor\u2019s statement. He declined the court\u2019s offer to instruct the jury to disregard the comment.\n[T]he declaration of a mistrial is a drastic remedy and should be granted only in those circumstances when the incident is so grievous that the prejudicial effect can be removed no other way.\nParker, 476 S.W.2d at 515-16.\nOrdinarily, the trial court acts within its discretion and cures error in the admission of evidence by withdrawing the improper evidence and instructing the jury to disregard it, rather than declaring a mistrial.\nState v. Laws, 668 S.W.2d 234, 238 (Mo.App.1984).\nThe test for determining if prejudice from the erroneous admission of evidence cannot be cured by instruction to the jury has been clearly stated.\nWhere improper evidence comes into a case but is promptly stricken by the court and the jury is instructed to disregard it, the reviewing court, in order to hold that the failure to grant a mistrial was reversible error, must determine and conclude as a matter of law from the entire record that the error was prejudicial and so impressive that its effect was not removed by the action of the trial court.\n*894State v. Dennison, 428 S.W.2d 573, 577 (Mo.1968).\nWe cannot conclude that the statement of the prosecutor was prejudicial and so impressive that its effect could not have been removed by direction to the jury. \u201cThe fact that the defendant sought no relief other than a mistrial cannot aid him.\u201d State v. Gilmore, 681 S.W.2d 934, 943 (Mo. banc 1984). Defendant\u2019s first point is denied.\nDefendant\u2019s last point urges that plain error was committed by the trial court in giving an instruction based on MAI-CR 3d 302.04, defining reasonable doubt. Defendant says the instruction dilutes the State\u2019s burden of proof, relying on Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 328, 112 L.Ed.2d 339 (1990).\nDefendant concedes the Missouri Supreme Court has rejected the same argument in State v. Griffin, 818 S.W.2d 278, 282-83 (Mo. banc 1991). Our Supreme Court has consistently rejected this argument in State v. Twenter, 818 S.W.2d 628, 634 (Mo. banc 1991); State v. Murray, 744 S.W.2d 762, 771 (Mo. banc 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 871, 109 S.Ct. 181, 102 L.Ed.2d 150 (1988); and State v. Antwine, 743 S.W.2d 51, 62-63 (Mo. banc 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1017, 108 S.Ct. 1755, 100 L.Ed.2d 217 (1988). However, Defendant pursues this argument because he believes the issue involves a meritorious issue of federal constitutional law and admits he raises it for the purpose of preservation in the event that a federal court renders a decision contrary to Griffin.\nThe Missouri Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld MAI-CR 3d 302.04, defining reasonable doubt, in spite of Cage. We are bound to follow those controlling decisions. Art. V, \u00a7 2, Mo. Const. Point II is denied.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nSHRUM, P.J., and MAUS, J., concur.\n",
