Under subsection (E), the relevant injury is whether evidence exists that the endangerment of the child\u2019s physical or emotional well-being was the direct result of the parent\u2019s conduct, including acts, omissions, and failures to act. \u00a0Termination under subsection (E) must be based on more than a single act or omission; a voluntary, deliberate, and conscious course of conduct by the parent is required.\n\n\n\nTo support a finding of endangerment, the parent\u2019s conduct does not necessarily have to be directed at the child, and the child is not required to suffer injury. \u00a0The specific danger to the child\u2019s well-being may be inferred from parental misconduct alone, and to determine whether termination is necessary, courts may look to parental conduct both before and after the child\u2019s birth. . . . \u00a0A parent\u2019s decision to engage in illegal drug use during the pendency of a termination suit, when the parent is at risk of losing a child, supports a finding that the parent engaged in conduct that endangered the child\u2019s physical or emotional well-being. \u00a0Thus, parental and caregiver illegal drug use supports the conclusion that the children\u2019s surroundings endanger their physical or emotional well-being. \u00a0A factfinder may also reasonably infer from a parent\u2019s failure to attend scheduled drug screenings that the parent was avoiding testing because the parent was using drugs. \u00a0As a general rule, conduct that subjects a child to a life of uncertainty and instability endangers the child\u2019s physical and emotional well-being.\n\n\n\nBecause the evidence pertaining to subsections 161.001(1)(D) and (E) is interrelated, we conduct a consolidated review.\n(footnote: 4)\n\tThe \ntrial court\n heard the following evidence. \u00a0Darlene Pile, an investigator for Child Protective Services (CPS), \nvisited Appellant\u2019s apartment\n in response to a report of physical neglect when B.J. was eleven months old. \u00a0Pile described the report:\n\n[T]he persons were concerned concerning [B.J.]\u2019s appearance. \u00a0There was comments that her head was dirty, her nails were dirty, the child wasn\u2019t\u2014was unkept [sic]. \u00a0The\u2014she had gone to a sitter, I guess, and the child was only provided with a sippy cup, ramen noodles, size 4 diapers, when she only wore a size 2 diaper. \u00a0The child was just unkept [sic]. \u00a0She was a loner. \u00a0She didn\u2019t want to play.\n\n\n\nWhen Pile investigated at the sitter\u2019s house, the sitter had already bathed B.J., but Pile noted that the sippy cup was dirty and contained only about an inch of fluid and that Appellant had not left any milk or clean clothes for B.J. \u00a0Pile reported that although Appellant, B.J., and their apartment were clean when she later visited Appellant, no food appropriate for an eleven-month-old was available in the home. \u00a0Pile testified that when asked why there was no milk, Appellant claimed that B.J. was lactose intolerant. \u00a0Pile also testified that Appellant told her that she did not need WIC because B.J. did not drink milk. \u00a0Appellant testified that she never told anyone that B.J. was lactose intolerant but that she did tell CPS that B.J. did not like white milk.\n\nB.J. was admitted into Cook Children\u2019s Hospital on January 24, 2008, one week before her first birthday. \u00a0Hospital personnel noticed that when they arrived, both Appellant and B.J. had hygiene issues. \u00a0B.J.\u2019s blanket was filthy, and the crevices in her sippy cup contained dirt.\n\nB.J. was diagnosed with cellulitis and failure to thrive. \u00a0Even with an armboard attached for an IV, B.J. weighed only 16 pounds and 7.3 ounces, the minimum for what doctors would have expected for a seven-month-old. \u00a0She was below the fifth percentile for weight of babies in her age group in the United States. \u00a0There was evidence that Appellant informed medical personnel that B.J. was a picky eater, refusing milk and \u201cother things which most children like.\u201d\n\nDr. Kevin Wylie, B.J.\u2019s attending physician at Cook Children\u2019s Hospital, testified that B.J.\u2019s failure to thrive was most likely caused by undernourishment and malnutrition. \u00a0Importantly, the doctor made clear in his testimony that the problem was not just that Appellant was giving B.J. inappropriate food. \u00a0He stated that B.J. had been \u201cgetting insufficient food\u201d and \u201cinsufficient caloric intake\u201d and that the most important part of solving B.J.\u2019s problem was just \u201c[f]eeding her.\u201d \u00a0Her low weight placed her at risk for developmental problems. \u00a0Further, at the hospital, B.J. was observed not to be a picky eater, drank milk with no problem, and began gaining weight. \u00a0Dr. Wylie testified that she ate \u201cmore than what would be expected for her weight.\u201d\n\nDr. Wylie was concerned that Appellant could not adequately care for B.J. because of the medical history Appellant provided, which showed that B.J. was two sets of immunizations behind schedule; B.J.\u2019s poor hygiene and low weight upon arrival; Appellant\u2019s interactions in the hospital; and the fact that B.J. thrived in the hospital.\n\nThere was evidence that Appellant was not taking her bipolar medication regularly. \u00a0Dr. Wylie testified that his notes indicated that Appellant had told the nurses that she could not pay for her bipolar medicine, but they observed that she purchased Starbucks products frequently. \u00a0Appellant testified that she took her medication regularly but admitted to not taking it for \u201ca couple of weeks\u201d in 2008 when she did not have it.\n\nDr. Wylie testified that Appellant was inexplicably belligerent and confrontational at the hospital. \u00a0He stated that his impression was that her regard for B.J.\u2019s health was not where it would be for the average patient, and that his baseline was pretty low. \u00a0As an example, he testified that she got upset when she was told that B.J. would have to stay in the hospital longer, not because of any concern for B.J. but because Appellant wanted to go home. \u00a0Appellant admitted at trial that B.J. had been two sets of immunizations behind, that is, the baby had no immunizations or checkups between the ages of two weeks and four months, because Appellant was working and did not have time to get B.J. timely medical care.\n\nWhile B.J. was in the hospital, medical staff explained the long-term ramifications of inadequate nutrition to Appellant; however, she continued to provide inappropriate nutrition to B.J. by giving the child soft drinks, chips, and other junk food. \u00a0\nFurthermore, there was evidence \nthat Appellant, who was a certified nursing assistant at the time, had attempted to remove B.J.\u2019s IV to change her diaper without consulting any of the hospital staff. \u00a0Appellant denied in her testimony that she had attempted to remove the IV and testified that she had helped a nurse unhook or disconnect it when the nurse was changing out the IV.\n\nDr. Wylie recommended placing B.J. upon discharge where CPS could be sure that she would get food to confirm that her problem was lack of appropriate nutrition instead of an obscure medical problem. \u00a0B.J. was placed in foster care upon her discharge from the hospital. \u00a0She gained about eleven and a half ounces within a week, and by the time she saw a pediatrician two months after her hospitalization, she weighed twenty pounds and was back on a normal growth curve. \u00a0Her pediatrician opined that she had made a \u201cdramatic improvement.\u201d \u00a0At her last checkup before trial, B.J. weighed 24.8 pounds.\n\nThe foster mother testified that B.J. ate peas and drank milk the night she arrived. \u00a0In describing B.J.\u2019s initial appearance, the foster mother testified, \n\nShe came to me reminding me so much of my daughter that I went to Latvia for. . . . \u00a0She had that orphanage look, which is a very blank, very sad, very lonely look. \u00a0And I could put her down and blow on her belly and tickle her and she didn\u2019t respond.\n\n\n\nShe never cried for food. \u00a0I had to put her on a\u2014just\u2014you eat breakfast; you eat snack; you eat lunch; you eat snack; you eat dinner; you get your bottle; you drink it; you go to bed. \u00a0It took a while before she actually knew to cry for any type of food or ask for it. \u00a0The day she first started asking for food, I was so excited, I called my husband up at work.\n\n\n\nDuring the pendency of the case, Appellant committed the state jail felony offense of theft of a vehicle. \u00a0She pled guilty to the offense and was placed on deferred adjudication community supervision. \u00a0At the time of the termination trial, Appellant was still on deferred adjudication community supervision but had been threatened with revocation unless she completed drug treatment. \u00a0She had been discharged from drug treatment in December 2008 for noncompliance.\n\nAppellant admitted that she had used marijuana on and off since she was fourteen years old. \u00a0She admitted to smoking marijuana during both of her pregnancies and during the pendency of both the CPS case and her deferred adjudication community supervision, violating the terms of her community supervision. \u00a0She tested positive for marijuana on three separate occasions\u2014December 22, 2008, February 26, 2009, and March 27, 2009. \u00a0She refused to take a urine test for CPS in March 2009 but testified that she had smoked marijuana less than a month before trial.\n\nApplying the appropriate standard for reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence,\n(footnote: 5) we hold that, based upon our review of the record, the evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s endangerment findings regarding Appellant under subsections (D) and (E). \u00a0Further, applying the appropriate standard for reviewing the factual sufficiency of the evidence,\n(footnote: 6) we hold that, based upon our review of the record, the evidence is factually sufficient to support those findings. \u00a0We overrule Appellant\u2019s first, second, third, and fourth issues.\n\nAlong with a best interest finding, a finding of only one ground alleged under section 161.001(1) is sufficient to support a judgment of termination.\n(footnote: 7) \u00a0\nWe therefore do not reach Appellant\u2019s fifth and sixth issues.\n(footnote: 8) \u00a0\n\nIn her seventh and eighth issues, Appellant contends that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that termination of Appellant\u2019s parental rights is in B.J.\u2019s best interest. \u00a0In addition to the above evidence, there was also evidence that Appellant failed to satisfy several requirements set forth in her CPS family service plan. \u00a0Specifically, she \n\nfailed to go to personal individual counseling; failed to follow through with drug assessment; and refused to take a drug test.\n\nAdditionally, instead of attending parenting classes set out in her service plan, Appellant opted to take parenting classes from Safe Haven. \u00a0However, she was unable to provide documentation of attendance or completion upon request. \u00a0After taking parenting classes, she refused to change B.J.\u2019s wet diaper during a CPS visit, indicating an inability to appropriately parent the child. \u00a0Also during visitation, Appellant spoke inappropriately to the child, both speaking to her as she would an adult and becoming overly frustrated with the child. \u00a0Appellant did not visit B.J. as often as she was allowed. \u00a0In fact, she only visited her daughter seventeen times out of thirty-two opportunities given to her by CPS. \u00a0In October 2008, she failed to visit her daughter at all. \u00a0Appellant testified that she missed visits to meet other service plan requirements, such as working and attending MHMR appointments, and because of transportation issues.\n\nAppellant\n \nwas unable to maintain stable housing throughout the duration of the case. \u00a0From August 1, 2008, to the time of trial, Appellant resided at at least seven different places, including a shelter. \u00a0At trial, she resided in a rented home with a friend. \u00a0Appellant\u2019s name was not on the lease, which had expired.\n\nAppellant was also unable to maintain stable employment throughout the duration of the case. \u00a0From August 2008 to February 2009, Appellant had six different jobs.\n\nAppellant testified that B.J. hugs her, calls her Mama, and is sad at the end of visits. \u00a0She also testified that her present residence was safe and child-friendly and that she would not smoke marijuana again. \u00a0She insisted that she was not an addict and that smoking marijuana was a choice. \u00a0She did not believe that her parental rights should be terminated because of \u201cfour pounds.\u201d\n\nThe CPS caseworker testified that termination of Appellant\u2019s parental rights would be in B.J.\u2019s best interest because\n\n[Appellant] has not shown any significant stability during this case. \u00a0She seems to believe that she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. \u00a0She\u2014she doesn\u2019t feel that she needs the medical treatment. \u00a0She doesn\u2019t feel that her child was being neglected, and she feels that her child should be returned to her. \u00a0And she just hasn\u2019t acknowledged her part in this case.\n\nThe evidence showed that Appellant\u2019s father had custody of her son, whom she had not seen for more than a year at the time the CPS case began, but the grandfather did not want to be considered as a potential placement for B.J. \u00a0The foster mother, on the other hand, testified that she loves B.J. and wants to adopt her, and that she and her husband, children, and parents are all bonded to B.J. \u00a0When describing B.J.\u2019s transformation from the time she arrived, the foster mother testified,\n\nShe\u2019s gone from that to this little girl that has a mind of her own and tells you what she thinks and speaks and loves her siblings and loves us and we love her and she\u2019s happy and she giggles and you can tickle her and you can play with her; and that blank look, that orphanage look, is gone. \n\nThe CPS caseworker testified that B.J. was thriving and happy in the foster home and very bonded. \u00a0B.J. talks a lot, runs and plays, and is learning a lot. \u00a0She calls the foster parents Mom and Dad and looks to them as her parents. \u00a0TDFPS\u2019s plan at trial was for B.J. to be adopted by her foster parents if her birth parents\u2019 rights were terminated.\n\nApplying the appropriate standards of review, we hold that the evidence is legally\n(footnote: 9) and factually\n(footnote: 10) sufficient to support the best interest finding, and we overrule Appellant\u2019s seventh and eighth issues. \n\nIn her ninth and tenth issues, Appellant contends that if we reverse the termination order based on insufficient evidence, we should also reverse the appointment of TDFPS as PMC on the same grounds. \u00a0Because we hold that the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the termination of Appellant\u2019s parental rights, we overrule her ninth and tenth issues.\n\nIn her eleventh and twelfth issues, Appellant contends that subsections (b) and (i) of section 263.405 of the family code are unconstitutional. \u00a0But Appellant filed a timely statement of issues and motion for new trial and directs this court to no injury she suffered as a result of the subsections complained of. \u00a0Accordingly, Appellant has not shown that the subsections are facially unconstitutional or unconstitutional as applied to her.\n(footnote: 11) \u00a0We therefore overrule her eleventh and twelfth issues.\n\nHaving overruled Appellant\u2019s twelve issues, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n\nLEE ANN DAUPHINOT\n\nJUSTICE\n\n\n\nPANEL: \u00a0LIVINGSTON, DAUPHINOT, and MEIER, JJ.\n\n\n\nDELIVERED: \u00a0April 15, 2010\n\nFOOTNOTES\n1:See\n Tex.
