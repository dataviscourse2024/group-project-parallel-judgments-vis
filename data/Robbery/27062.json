Juvenile Courts: Appeal and Error. An appellate court reviews juve-\n                    nile cases de novo on the record, and reaches its conclusions indepen-\n                    dently of the juvenile court\u2019s findings.\n                 2. Statutes: Appeal and Error. Statutory interpretation is a question of\n                    law, which an appellate court resolves independently of the trial court.\n                 3. Constitutional Law: Appeal and Error. The review of constitutional\n                    standards is a question of law and is reviewed independently of the trial\n                    court\u2019s determination.\n                 4. Constitutional Law: Statutes: Waiver. The proper procedure for rais-\n                    ing a facial constitutional challenge to a criminal statute is to file a\n                    motion to quash, and all defects not raised in a motion to quash are\n                    taken as waived by a defendant pleading the general issue.\n                 5. Constitutional Law: Convictions: Statutes. A defendant is prohibited\n                    from attempting to circumvent or avoid conviction under a particular\n                    statute by asserting a constitutional challenge to another, collateral stat-\n                    ute which is irrelevant to the prosecution.\n                 6. Criminal Law: Jury Trials. When considering a criminal defendant\u2019s\n                    right to a jury trial, it is well established that the right does not extend\n                    to those criminal offenses categorized as petty but attaches only to those\n                    crimes that are considered serious offenses.\n                 7. Jury Trials: Sentences: Time: Legislature. The right to a jury trial\n                    attaches when the potential term of incarceration exceeds 6 months or if\n                    the additional statutory penalties, viewed in conjunction with the maxi-\n                    mum authorized period of incarceration, are so severe that they clearly\n                    reflect a legislative determination that the offense in question is a seri-\n                    ous one.\n\f                                  - 869 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                    304 Nebraska Reports\n                       IN RE INTEREST OF ZOIE H.\n                            Cite as 304 Neb. 868\n\n 8.

BACKGROUND\n   On the afternoon of September 25, 2018, Heidi Cuca was\nfueling her Lexus at a convenience store in Lincoln, Nebraska.\nWhile standing outside the Lexus, Cuca observed two young\nfemales had entered her vehicle and were seated inside\u2014one\nin the driver\u2019s seat and the other in the backseat. The female in\nthe driver\u2019s seat was later determined to be Zoie.\n   It appeared to Cuca that Zoie was trying to start the Lexus,\nbut was having trouble getting the engine to turn over. Cuca\nheard the female in the back seat shout, \u201c\u2018Zoie let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201d So\n\f                                 - 870 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     304 Nebraska Reports\n                      IN RE INTEREST OF ZOIE H.\n                           Cite as 304 Neb. 868\n\nCuca attempted to retrieve the Lexus keys from inside the\nvehicle and throw them. An altercation ensued, during which\nZoie shouted, \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t, let me go. I\u2019m going to take it.\u2019\u201d The\nconvenience store manager heard Cuca yelling for help and\ncalled the 911 emergency dispatch service.\n   Zoie escaped before police arrived, but someone was able\nto grab Zoie\u2019s arm and hold her long enough for Cuca to take\na photograph. Cuca provided the photograph to police, who\neventually located Zoie and contacted her at school a few\ndays later.\n   Sgt. Mike Ripley, an officer with the Lincoln Police\nDepartment, met with Zoie and her father to conduct a fol-\nlowup investigation. Zoie waived her Miranda rights and\nagreed to an interview. Zoie admitted she made plans to steal\nthe Lexus, explaining she \u201c\u2018just felt like taking the car.\u2019\u201d Zoie\ndescribed how she and a friend entered the Lexus from the\npassenger side while Cuca was fueling up on the other side.\nZoie also described the altercation that ensued and how she\neventually escaped.\n                1. Juvenile Court Proceedings\n   On October 16, 2018, the State filed an amended supple-\nmental petition in the separate juvenile court of Lancaster\nCounty. It alleged that on or about September 25, 2018, Zoie\nintentionally engaged in conduct which, under the circum-\nstances as she believed them to be, constituted a substantial\nstep in a course of conduct intended to culminate in her com-\nmission of the crime of theft by unlawful taking in the amount\nof $5,000 or more. Attempted theft by unlawful taking is a\nClass IIIA felony when the value of the thing involved is\n$5,000 or more.1\n   Zoie filed a motion to quash the amended supplemental\npetition. Alternatively, she filed a demand for jury trial. Both\nrequests were premised on the enactment of Neb. Rev. Stat.\n\n1\n    See Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 28-20l(4)(c), 28-511, and 28-518(1) (Reissue\n    2016).\n\f                                  - 871 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     304 Nebraska Reports\n                       IN RE INTEREST OF ZOIE H.\n                            Cite as 304 Neb. 868\n\n\u00a7 28-1204.05 (Cum. Supp. 2018), which went into effect on\nJuly 19, 2018, and provides in pertinent part:\n         (1) . . . [A] person under the age of twenty-five\n      years who knowingly possesses a firearm commits the\n      offense of possession of a firearm by a prohibited juvenile\n      offender if he or she has previously been adjudicated an\n      offender in juvenile court for an act which would consti-\n      tute a felony or an act which would constitute a misde-\n      meanor crime of domestic violence.\n         (2) Possession of a firearm by a prohibited juvenile\n      offender is a Class IV felony for a first offense and a\n      Class IIIA felony for a second or subsequent offense.\n   Other portions of the statute exempt members of the armed\nforces and law enforcement2 and establish a procedure for\nthose under 25 years of age to request reinstatement of the\nright to possess a firearm.3 Zoie was not charged with vio-\nlating \u00a7 28-1204.05, but her motion to quash alleged that\nadjudication for theft by unlawful taking over $5,000 \u201cwould\nsubject [her] to criminal prosecution under an unconstitutional\nstatute, Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-1204.05 (Cum. Supp. 2018).\u201d\nZoie\u2019s demand for a jury trial was also premised on the\nenactment of \u00a7 28-1204.05. Generally speaking, she argued\nthat the statute\u2019s restriction on firearm possession amounted\nto a penalty for being adjudicated and thereby rendered the\nadjudication proceedings a \u201cserious criminal case\u201d entitling\nher to a jury trial pursuant to Duncan v. Louisiana 4 and State\nv. Wiltshire.5\n   After holding a hearing, the juvenile court overruled the\nmotion to quash, finding there was no defect on the face of\n\n2\n    See \u00a7 28-1204.05(3).\n3\n    See \u00a7 28-1204.05(4).\n4\n    Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491\n    (1968).\n5\n    State v. Wiltshire, 241 Neb. 817, 491 N.W.2d 324 (1992), overruled on\n    other grounds, State v. Louthan, 257 Neb. 174, 595 N.W.2d 917 (1999).\n\f                             - 872 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  304 Nebraska Reports\n                   IN RE INTEREST OF ZOIE H.\n                        Cite as 304 Neb. 868\n\nthe amended supplemental petition. The juvenile court denied\nthe demand for jury trial, reasoning that Neb. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7 43-279(1) (Reissue 2016) requires the adjudication portion of\njuvenile court proceedings \u201cshall be conducted before the court\nwithout a jury, applying the customary rules of evidence in use\nin trials without a jury.\u201d The matter proceeded to an adjudica-\ntion hearing on the amended supplemental petition.\n                  2. Adjudication Hearing\n   At the adjudication hearing, the State called three witnesses:\nCuca, the convenience store manager, and Sergeant Ripley.\nCuca described the events of September 25, 2018, as set out\nabove, and identified Zoie as the female who attempted to steal\nthe Lexus. The manager largely confirmed Cuca\u2019s testimony,\nand she too identified Zoie as the female who attempted to\nsteal the Lexus. Sergeant Ripley testified about his interview\nwith Zoie, including that she received Miranda warnings prior\nto the interview.\n   Both Cuca and Sergeant Ripley offered testimony about the\nvalue of the Lexus. Cuca testified that she purchased the 2012\nLexus RX350 3 years earlier for around $21,000 and that it\ncurrently had 60,000 miles on it. When Cuca was asked her\nopinion on the value of the Lexus, Zoie objected to the ques-\ntion as speculative. The objection was overruled, and Cuca\nanswered that according to Kelley Blue Book, the value of\nher Lexus with 60,000 miles \u201cis around $21,000 list price.\u201d\nThere was no motion to strike Cuca\u2019s response and no cross-\u00ad\nexamination on Cuca\u2019s valuation testimony.\n   Sergeant Ripley also relied on Kelley Blue Book for his\nvaluation testimony. He estimated the \u201caverage trade in value\u201d\nof the Lexus was $15,529. He did not contact Cuca to get\ninformation on the vehicle\u2019s mileage, condition, or accessories.\nInstead, he used the value for a \u201cbase model\u201d Lexus in \u201cgood\u201d\ncondition with 75,000 miles. When asked on cross-examination\nwhat the value of the Lexus would be if its condition had been\n\u201cpoor,\u201d Sergeant Ripley estimated it would still be between\n$10,000 and $12,000. He testified it was unlikely a 2012\n\f                                  - 873 -\n            Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                     304 Nebraska Reports\n                       IN RE INTEREST OF ZOIE H.\n                            Cite as 304 Neb. 868\n\nLexus in working condition would be worth less than $5,000.\nHe based his opinion on his experience investigating car thefts\nand his research into the value of Cuca\u2019s Lexus. There was\nno objection to Sergeant Ripley\u2019s valuation testimony or to\nthe admission of the Kelley Blue Book printout showing\nthat valuation.\n   Zoie rested without presenting any evidence. In a journal\nentry and order filed October 23, 2018, the juvenile court adju-\ndicated Zoie on the allegations of the amended supplemental\npetition, finding the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat Zoie was a juvenile as described in \u00a7 43-247(2).\n   Zoie timely appealed and filed a petition to bypass that\nincluded a notice of constitutional question under Neb. Ct.\nR. App. \u00a7 2-109(E) (rev. 2014). We granted the petition\nto bypass.\n                II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Zoie assigns, restated, that the juvenile court erred by (1)\noverruling her motion to quash, (2) denying her demand for\njury trial, and (3) finding she committed the act of attempted\ntheft by unlawful taking, $5,000 or more, when the State\nfailed to meet its burden of proof regarding the value of\nthe vehicle.\n                 III.

ANALYSIS\n                      1. Motion to Quash\n   [4] Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 29-1808 (Reissue 2016) provides, \u201cA\nmotion to quash may be made in all cases when there is a\ndefect apparent upon the face of the record, including defects\nin the form of the indictment or in the manner in which an\noffense is charged.\u201d We have consistently held that the proper\nprocedure for raising a facial constitutional challenge to a\ncriminal statute is to file a motion to quash, and all defects not\nraised in a motion to quash are taken as waived by a defendant\npleading the general issue.9\n   But here, Zoie\u2019s motion to quash did not challenge the con-\nstitutionality of the criminal statute on which she was being\nadjudicated. Instead, her motion to quash raised a facial consti-\ntutional challenge to an entirely different statute, \u00a7 28-1204.05.\nZoie sought to quash the amended supplemental petition by\narguing that adjudication for acts that would constitute theft by\nunlawful taking over $5,000 \u201cwould subject [her] to criminal\nprosecution under an unconstitutional statute, Neb. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7 28-1204.05.\u201d\n   [5] In the criminal context, a defendant is prohibited from\nattempting to circumvent or avoid conviction under a particular\nstatute by asserting a constitutional challenge to another, col-\nlateral statute which is irrelevant to the prosecution.10 We have\ngenerally described this as a rule of standing and have applied\nit to motions to quash in a criminal prosecution, reasoning\nthat a defendant has standing to challenge only those statutes\nthat are relevant to the prosecution.11 We conclude this rule is\nequally applicable to motions to quash filed in juvenile adjudi-\ncation proceedings.\n\n 9\n     State v. Hibler, 302 Neb. 325, 923 N.W.2d 398 (2019).\n10\n     State v. Harris, 284 Neb. 214, 817 N.W.2d 258 (2012); State v. Cushman,\n     256 Neb. 335, 589 N.W.2d 533 (1999).\n11\n     See id.\n\f                                    - 875 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                      304 Nebraska Reports\n                        IN RE INTEREST OF ZOIE H.\n                             Cite as 304 Neb. 868\n\n   Zoie was being adjudicated for acts which would constitute\nfelony theft by unlawful taking, and her motion to quash chal-\nlenged the constitutionality of \u00a7 28-1204.05, a statute that was\ncollateral to the adjudication, and which would apply, if at all,\nonly after an adjudication. Zoie was attempting to avoid adju-\ndication by challenging the constitutionality of a statute that\nwas irrelevant to the statutes under which the State was seek-\ning adjudication, and the juvenile court correctly overruled the\nmotion to quash.\n   Given our resolution of this assignment of error, we do not\nreach, in this appeal, any of Zoie\u2019s constitutional challenges to\n\u00a7 28-1204.05.\n\n                   2. Demand for Jury Trial\n   In her second assignment of error, Zoie argues that if\n\u00a7 28-1204.05 is constitutional, it effectively transforms a juve-\nnile adjudication for an act which would be a felony or a\nmisdemeanor act of domestic violence into a serious criminal\noffense to which the right to a jury trial attaches.\n   [6,7] When considering a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a\njury trial, it is well established that the right does not extend\nto those criminal offenses categorized as \u201c\u2018petty,\u2019\u201d but attaches\nonly to those crimes that are considered \u201cserious[]\u201d offenses.12\nThis court has said that the right to a jury trial attaches when\nthe potential term of incarceration exceeds 6 months or if the\n\u201c\u2018additional statutory penalties, viewed in conjunction with the\nmaximum authorized period of incarceration, are so severe that\nthey clearly reflect a legislative determination that the offense\nin question is a \u201cserious\u201d one.\u2019\u201d13\n   Zoie urges us to apply the \u201cserious offense\u201d test to her\njuvenile adjudication, and she asks us to find that the pas-\nsage of \u00a7 28-1204.05 reflects a legislative determination that\n\n12\n     See Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489 U.S. 538, 541, 109 S. Ct. 1289, 103\n     L.

Her argument\nis premised on the fundamental assumption that \u00a7 28-1204.05\nimposes a criminal penalty for juvenile adjudication. We\nexplore that assumption first and reject it. We then consider the\nright to jury trial generally in juvenile court adjudications, and\nwe conclude the juvenile court correctly denied Zoie\u2019s demand\nfor a jury trial.\n                 (a) \u00a7 28-1204.05 Is Not Penalty\n                     for Juvenile Adjudication\n   To address Zoie\u2019s argument that \u00a7 28-1204.05 transforms\njuvenile adjudications into serious offenses that require a jury\ntrial, we first consider whether \u00a7 28-1204.05 can fairly be\ncharacterized as punishing juvenile adjudication at all. The\nanswer to this question is key because if \u00a7 28-1204.05 is not\npunishment imposed for her juvenile adjudication, then Zoie\u2019s\nargument that \u00a7 28-1204.05 transforms the adjudication into a\nserious offense necessarily fails.\n   [8] In the criminal context, we often analyze such ques-\ntions using the \u201c\u2018intent-effects\u2019\u201d test established by the U.S.\nSupreme Court, \u201cwhich requires an initial determination of\nwhether the Legislature intended the statute to be criminal\nor civil [in nature].\u201d14 But juvenile adjudications are civil,\nnot criminal, in nature. As we explained in In re Interest of\nLaurance S.:15\n      \u201cWe have long recognized that a juvenile court proceed-\n      ing is not a prosecution for crime, but a special proceed-\n      ing that serves as an ameliorative alternative to a criminal\n      prosecution. . . . The purpose of our statutes relating\n      to the handling of youthful offenders is the education,\n\n14\n     See State v. Payan, 277 Neb. 663, 670, 765 N.W.2d 192, 200 (2009)\n     (applying test from Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 123 S. Ct. 1140, 155 L. Ed.\n     2d 164 (2003)).\n15\n     In re Interest of Laurance S., 274 Neb. 620, 624, 742 N.W.2d 484, 488\n     (2007).\n\f                                       - 877 -\n              Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                       304 Nebraska Reports\n                          IN RE INTEREST OF ZOIE H.\n                               Cite as 304 Neb. 868\n\n      treatment, and rehabilitation of the child, rather than\n      retributive punishment. . . . The emphasis on training and\n      rehabilitation, rather than punishment, is underscored by\n      the declaration that juvenile proceedings are civil, rather\n      than criminal, in nature.\u201d\n   A juvenile adjudication does not result in a conviction and\nsentence; instead, when a juvenile is adjudicated for acts which\nwould constitute a felony, Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 43-286 (Cum.\nSupp. 2018) sets out the dispositional options available to the\njuvenile court. And even when a disposition is similar to that\nimposed as punishment for a crime, we have not found the\ndisposition to be punishment.16 Because juvenile adjudications\nare civil rather than criminal in nature, it is difficult to envision\nany circumstance under which a juvenile disposition could be\nsuccessfully challenged as punishment.\n   Here, of course, the prohibition on possessing firearms\ncontained in \u00a7 28-1204.05 is not part of the juvenile code,\nbut, rather, it is contained within the statutory provisions\ngoverning criminal offenses. To answer the question whether\n\u00a7 28-1204.05 is properly characterized as punishment for the\njuvenile adjudication, we find guidance in our holding in State\nv. Peters.17\n   In that case, we held that a similar statute, Neb. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7 28-1206 (Reissue 1995), which prohibits firearm posses-\nsion by convicted felons, does not impose punishment for\nthe prior felony. We reasoned that although \u00a7 28-1206 pun-\nished the specific conduct of possessing a firearm after being\nconvicted of a felony, it did not increase the punishment for\nthe prior felony. In Peters, we recognized that one\u2019s status\n\n16\n     See, e.g., In re Interest of Brandon M., 273 Neb. 47, 727 N.W.2d 230\n     (2007) (dispositional order of restitution in juvenile court rehabilitative in\n     nature and not punishment); In re Interest of A.M.H., 233 Neb. 610, 447\n     N.W.2d 40 (1989) (dispositional placement of juvenile in youth training\n     center is not punishment, but, rather, is furnishing of protection, care, and\n     training by State as substitution for parental authority).\n17\n     State v. Peters, 261 Neb. 416, 622 N.W.2d 918 (2001).\n\f                                    - 878 -\n             Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                      304 Nebraska Reports\n                         IN RE INTEREST OF ZOIE H.\n                              Cite as 304 Neb. 868\n\nas a convicted felon made the statutory firearm prohibition\napplicable, but we found the legal consequences for the past\ncriminal conduct remain unchanged. Stated differently, the\nstatutory prohibition on possessing firearms may be a collat-\neral consequence of a prior felony conviction, but it is not part\nof the punishment imposed for that prior felony conviction.\nWe noted that the majority of jurisdictions agree that statutes\nprohibiting felons from possessing firearms \u201care viewed not\nas further punishment for the underlying felony or felonies,\nbut as a future prohibition on a felon\u2019s conduct.\u201d18\n   [9] Given our holding in Peters that the prohibition on pos-\nsessing firearms in \u00a7 28-1206 is not punishment for the prior\nfelony conviction, we likewise hold that the prohibition on\npossessing firearms in \u00a7 28-1204.05 is not punishment imposed\nfor a prior juvenile adjudication. We therefore reject Zoie\u2019s\nargument that \u00a7 28-1204.05 transformed her juvenile adjudi-\ncation into a serious offense and entitled her to a jury trial.\nAnd as we explain below, we see no other legal basis on this\nrecord to support Zoie\u2019s demand for a jury trial in her juvenile\ncourt adjudication.\n\n               (b) No Constitutional Right to Jury\n                    in Juvenile Adjudications\n   The U.S. Supreme Court in McKeiver v. Pennsylvania19\nheld that a jury trial is not constitutionally required in a juve-\nnile court\u2019s adjudicative stage.

McKeiver\nemphasized, however, that if a state decides to offer jury trials\nin juvenile adjudications that would be its \u201cprivilege and not\nits obligation.\u201d23\n   Post-McKeiver, some states have extended the right to jury\ntrial to juvenile adjudications under certain circumstances,\nthrough either statutes or court decisions.24 But the majority\nhave not,25 including Nebraska.\n   Nebraska\u2019s preeminent case on the issue is the pre-\u00adMcKeiver\ncase of DeBacker v. Brainard.26 There, we considered a habeas\npetition challenging the constitutionality of a recently enacted\nstatute requiring that juvenile court hearings \u201cshall be con-\nducted by the judge without a jury in an informal manner,\napplying the customary rules of evidence in use in civil trials\nwithout a jury in the district courts.\u201d27 The juvenile at issue had\nbeen adjudicated delinquent for the act of forgery, a felony, and\n\n23\n     McKeiver, supra note 19, 402 U.S. at 547.\n24\n     See, e.g., Kan.

He filed a petition for\nwrit of habeas corpus, alleging \u00a7 43-206.03 was unconstitu-\ntional because it denied him the right to a jury trial. The district\ncourt rejected the constitutional claim and denied habeas relief.\nOn appeal, four members of this court opined that the new stat-\nute was unconstitutional because it denied juveniles the right to\na jury trial for acts that would be felonies if charged as an adult.\nIn large part, the majority read the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s In re\nGault decision to require such a result. Three judges, however,\nfound In re Gault \u201cdoes not hold or even infer that a jury trial\nis essential to due process in a delinquency case, even where\nthe supporting evidence points to criminal conduct on the part\nof the juvenile.\u201d28 Due to the absence of a supermajority under\nNeb. Const. art. V, \u00a7 2, this court affirmed the dismissal of the\nhabeas petition.29\n   [10] The following year, a majority of this court again held\nthat \u201ca juvenile court proceeding, under the controlling statute\nin the State of Nebraska, is a civil proceeding and under the\ndoctrine of parens patriae, the constitutional guarantees of a\njury trial and the incidents thereto are not applicable to a juve-\nnile proceeding under our statute.\u201d30\n   Currently, \u00a7 43-279(1) provides in part: \u201cThe adjudication\nportion of hearings shall be conducted before the court without\na jury, applying the customary rules of evidence in use in trials\nwithout a jury.\u201d Zoie does not directly challenge the constitu-\ntionality of \u00a7 43-279(1), but instead argues that the enactment\nof \u00a7 28-1204.05 \u201celevates felonies alleged in juvenile court to\n\u2018serious criminal case\u2019 status [so] the constitutional requirement\nof a jury trial right supersedes the language in \u00a7 43-279(1).\u201d31\n\n28\n     DeBacker, supra note 26, 183 Neb. at 477, 161 N.W.2d at 516.\n29\n     See, also, Laurie v.

Zoie\u2019s second assignment of\nerror lacks merit.\n                3. Burden of Proof Regarding\n                      Value of Property\n   In her final assignment of error, Zoie argues that the evi-\ndence presented at the adjudication hearing was insufficient\nto prove the value of the Lexus. The amended supplemental\npetition alleged Zoie committed acts which would constitute\nthe Class IIIA felony of attempted theft by unlawful taking,\n$5,000 or more. Under \u00a7 28-518(8), value is an essential ele-\nment of the offense of theft which must be proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\n   The juvenile court found the State had met its burden of\nproof and adjudicated Zoie under \u00a7 43-247(2) as a juvenile\nwho committed an act which would constitute a felony under\nthe laws of this State. On appeal, Zoie challenges only the suf-\nficiency of the evidence regarding the value of the Lexus, and\nwe limit our analysis accordingly. After a de novo review of\nthe record, we find the State met its burden of proving that the\nLexus had a value of $5,000 or more.\n   [11] It has long been the rule in Nebraska that the owner of\nchattel may testify as to its value in a criminal case.32 At the\nadjudication hearing, Cuca testified that her Lexus had a value\n\u201caround $21,000.\u201d The investigating officer testified, based on\nhis experience investigating car thefts and his research into\nthe value of Cuca\u2019s Lexus, that it had a value of $15,529 if it\nwas in good condition. Moreover, he testified it would have\na value in excess of $10,000 even in poor condition. Zoie\ndid not object to this testimony and presented no evidence to\nthe contrary.\n\n32\n     See State v. Holland, 213 Neb. 170, 328 N.W.2d 205 (1982).\n\f                            - 882 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  304 Nebraska Reports\n                  IN RE INTEREST OF ZOIE H.\n                       Cite as 304 Neb. 868\n\n   On this record, we find the State presented sufficient evi-\ndence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of\nthe Lexus was $5,000 or more. We therefore conclude that the\nevidence was sufficient to adjudicate Zoie under \u00a7 43-247(2)\nand that her third assignment of error has no merit.\n                    V. CONCLUSION\n  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the juvenile court\u2019s\norder.\n                                               Affirmed.\n\f",
