Granted;       stay     order\nvacated.\n\n      \u00b61    REBECCA GRASSL BRADLEY, J.          The circuit court ordered\nthe arbitration of a private construction dispute stayed until\nit could decide an insurance coverage dispute between one of the\ncontractors connected to the arbitration and the contractor's\ninsurer.    CityDeck Landing LLC petitions this court, pursuant to\nWis. Stat. \u00a7 (Rule) 809.71 (2015-16),1 for a supervisory writ.\n\n      1All subsequent references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to\nthe 2017-18 version unless otherwise indicated.\n\f                                                                                   No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n\nCityDeck        asks        this    court        to       exercise        its     superintending\nconstitutional authority to vacate the circuit court's2 order.\nCityDeck asserts the circuit court exceeded its jurisdiction by\nputting the private arbitration3 on hold, and that a supervisory\nwrit       is   necessary          to     correct         the     circuit        court's    extra-\njurisdictional          act.         We       hold       the    circuit     court       lacked   the\nauthority        to    issue       the     order         staying      the   arbitration,         the\nrequirements necessary to issue a supervisory writ have been\nsatisfied, and the stay order must be vacated.\n                                         I.    BACKGROUND\n       \u00b62       In    December       2013,      CityDeck         hired      Smet    Construction\nServices Corporation as its general contractor to construct an\n\napartment building called \"CityDeck Residences\" in Green Bay.\nSmet hired subcontractors, including GB Builders of Northeastern\nWisconsin,           LLC;    Lunda       Construction            Company;        Security-Luebke\nRoofing, Inc.; and Lakeland Construction, Inc.                                  The construction\ncontract required any disputes to be resolved by arbitration.                                     A\ndispute arose and in May 2016, CityDeck filed for arbitration\n\nagainst Smet, alleging breach of the construction contract and\ntheft by contractor.               It filed an amended demand for arbitration\nin   November         2016.        In    July    2017,         Smet   sought       to    bring   the\nsubcontractors          into       the    arbitration           because     it     contended     the\n\n\n       2   Brown County Circuit Court, Thomas J. Walsh, Judge.\n       3\n       The parties independently initiated the arbitration in\nthis case pursuant to a private contract, without involvement by\nthe court system.\n\n\n                                                     2\n\f                                                                             No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n\nsubcontractors were responsible for the problems and each of the\nsubcontracts      contained        an    indemnity       provision        requiring       the\nsubcontractor to \"defend, indemnify and hold [Smet] harmless.\"\nMost of the subcontractors voluntarily joined the arbitration.\nGB    Builders    notified     its      insurer,       Society    Insurance,         of   the\nclaim, and Society hired an attorney to represent GB Builders\nunder a reservation of rights.                   In August 2017, Smet tendered\nthe defense of the CityDeck claim to Society, asserting it was\nan additional insured under the insurance policy Society issued\nto GB Builders.       In October 2017, GB Builders filed an answer to\nSmet's      demand   for     arbitration,            asking     the      arbitrator       for\ndismissal.       The arbitrator scheduled the arbitration hearing for\n\nMarch 1, 2018.\n       \u00b63     In October 2017, however, Society Insurance filed a\ndeclaratory      judgment    complaint          in    Brown     County    Circuit       Court\nagainst     CityDeck,     Smet,      and   GB    Builders.            Society      sought   a\ndeclaration \"on the scope of its insurance duties\" to Smet and\nGB Builders with respect to CityDeck's construction claims under\n\narbitration.         Society       asked   the        circuit    court       to    stay   the\narbitration until it could decide the insurance coverage issue.\nThe    circuit    court    granted      Society's        request       and    ordered     the\narbitration stayed on January 2, 2018.\n       \u00b64     CityDeck       asserted           the      circuit         court        lacked\njurisdiction to order a private arbitration stayed, particularly\nwhen    the   circuit      court     action      and    the     arbitration         involved\ndifferent issues and different parties; three subcontractors who\nwere parties to the arbitration were not named in the circuit\n                                            3\n\f                                                                      No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n\ncourt suit.       CityDeck filed a motion asking the circuit court to\nreconsider its decision.          The circuit court ignored CityDeck's\nmotion    to    reconsider,     and    CityDeck    filed       a   petition       for   a\nsupervisory writ in the court of appeals.                  The court of appeals\nconstrued the petition as an appeal from a non-final order and\ndenied    the     petition.       CityDeck        filed    a       petition    for      a\nsupervisory writ with this court.             We accepted jurisdiction over\nCityDeck's petition and heard oral argument.\n                                 II.    ANALYSIS\n                           A.    Historical Analysis\n     \u00b65        Wisconsin cases contain inconsistencies regarding writ\nprocedure,      terminology,     and    the   standards        applicable     to     the\n\nexercise of our constitutional superintending authority.                             For\nthe sake of clarity, we set forth the history of writs requested\nunder    our    superintending    authority,       the    origin      of    the    term\n\"supervisory writ,\" and an unexplained discrepancy in our cases\nilluminated in State ex rel. Beaudry v. Panosian, 35 Wis. 2d\n\n418, 151 N.W.2d 48 (1967).\n                      1.   History of writ procedure\n     \u00b66        Article VII, \u00a7 3 of the Wisconsin Constitution gives\nthe supreme court \"superintending and administrative authority\nover all courts\" and the ability to \"issue all writs necessary\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\f                                                                              No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n\nin aid of its jurisdiction.\"4               Interpreting this provision, this\ncourt held that \"[the supreme court] was endowed with a separate\nand independent jurisdiction, which enables and requires it in a\nproper case to control the course of ordinary litigation in such\ninferior courts, and was also endowed with all the common-law\nwrits applicable to that jurisdiction.\"                          State ex rel.

This       court    concluded       that    \"when     the       makers    of   the\nconstitution       used    the     words    'superintending         control          over   all\ninferior    courts'       they     definitely       referred       to    that       well-known\nsuperintending jurisdiction of the court of king's bench.\"                                  Id.\nat   614.        \"The    two    great    writs    by     which    this       superintending\n\njurisdiction was principally exercised by the court of King's\nbench     were    the    writs     of    mandamus       and   prohibition;            the   one\ndirecting action by the inferior court, and the other forbidding\naction.\"     Id.\n      \u00b67     A    writ    of    prohibition       \"restrain[s]          a    court     in   the\nexercise     of         judicial        functions        outside        or     beyond       its\njurisdiction,       and     when    there    is     no    other     adequate          remedy.\"\nState ex rel.

But, . . . the\nwrit   has    been    expanded     to   cover    cases    of    'nonjurisdictional\nerror when the appeal may come too late for effective redress,\nor be inadequate and there is a need for such intervention to\navoid grave hardship or a complete denial of the rights of a\nlitigant.'\") (internal citations and quoted source omitted).\n\n       \u00b69     In Fourth National Bank, this court acknowledged it\ngranted a writ of prohibition in Attorney General, to prevent\n\"the further prosecution of certain contempt proceedings in the\ncircuit court because such court was acting in excess of its\njurisdiction.\"        Fourth Nat'l Bank, 103 Wis. at 617.                    This court\nexplained in Attorney General:             \"Having held that the attempt to\npunish the publication in question as contempt was in excess of\nthe jurisdiction of the circuit court, no reason is seen why the\nwrit is not an apt and proper remedy, unless, indeed, there be\nother adequate remedies.\"               Attorney Gen., 97 Wis. at 15. The\ncourt proceeded to rule out the use of other writs and concluded\nthat a writ of prohibition was appropriate.                 Id.\n       \u00b610    While   Fourth       National     Bank     explained      the     court's\nsuperintending power, it specifically dealt with the issuance of\na writ of mandamus.          103 Wis. at 618.             The court stated that\n                                          7\n\f                                                                   No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n\n\"unless there be adequate remedy for such denial in the regular\nexercise     of the appellate       jurisdiction of        this court,       it   is\ndifficult to see why the superintending jurisdiction should not\nbe exercised to quash the neglect or refusal of the circuit\ncourt, and compel it to act within its jurisdiction.\"                       Id. at\n\n621.\n       \u00b611   In   addition,    Fourth      National     Bank   created      several\nprinciples     for   issuing    a   writ    of   mandamus.         First,    \"[t]he\ngeneral rule of law undoubtedly is that mandamus will not lie\nwhere there is a remedy by appeal or writ of error.                         But the\nremedy   by appeal must        be   substantially       adequate    in   order    to\nprevent relief by mandamus.\"               Id. at 622 (internal citations\nomitted).     Second, \"[i]t is very plain that, if the creditors\nare to exercise their rights with any prospect of benefit, they\nmust exercise them promptly.\"           Id.      Third, \"reliance is placed\nupon the     well-known   principle        that mandamus will        not    lie   to\ncontrol the exercise of discretion.\"              Id.     Fourth, \"[w]here it\nclearly appears that discretion has been not merely abused, but\nnot exercised at all, or that the action taken by the inferior\ncourt is without semblance of legal cause, and no other adequate\nremedy exists, mandamus will lie to compel the specific action\nwhich should have been taken.\"             Id. at 623.     Fifth, \"[t]he duty\nof the court must be plain, the refusal to proceed within its\njurisdiction to perform that duty must be clear, the results of\nsuch refusal prejudicial, the remedy, if any, by appeal or writ\nof error utterly inadequate, and the application for relief by\n\n\n                                        8\n\f                                                                             No.    2018AP291-W\n\n\n\nmandamus speedy and prompt, in order to justify the issuance of\nthe writ.\"       Id. at 623-24.\n\n     \u00b612       It appears, however, that the requirements outlined in\nFourth National Bank for a writ of mandamus became requirements\nfor all writs issued under the court's supervisory powers.                                   In\n1907, in a mandamus case, the court wrote that it would apply\nits supervisory control only \"where the duty of the inferior\ncourt to act within its jurisdiction or to refrain from going\nbeyond    its    jurisdiction         is   plain        and   imperative,          where   such\ncourt    threatens         to   violate       that       duty    to        the   substantial\nprejudice       of   the   rights     of   the      petitioner,        where       all     other\nremedies are inadequate, and the application for relief [is]\n\nprompt.\"        State ex rel. Milwaukee Elec. Ry. & Light Co. v.\nCircuit Court for Rock Cty., 133 Wis. 442, 444, 113 N.W. 722\n(1907) (citing Fourth Nat'l Bank).                       That case, Fourth National\nBank, and two other mandamus cases,5 were then cited in State ex\nrel. Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Co. v. Circuit Court of Milwaukee\nCty.,    143    Wis.   282,     127    N.W.       998    (1910),      as    principles      for\nexercising general superintending control.                      The court stated:\n\n     Those   principles   in   substance  are   that   this\n     [superintending] jurisdiction is not to be exercised\n     upon light occasion, but only upon some grave\n     exigency; that the writs by which it is exercised will\n     not be used to perform the ordinary functions of an\n     appeal or writ of error; that the duty of the court\n     below must be plain; its refusal to proceed within the\n\n     5 State ex rel. City of Milwaukee v. Ludwig, 106 Wis. 226,\n82 N.W. 158 (1900); State ex rel. Umbreit v. Helms, 136 Wis.\n432, 118 N.W. 158 (1908).\n\n\n                                              9\n\f                                                                  No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n      line of such duty, or, on the other hand, its intent\n      to proceed in violation of such duty must be clear;\n      the results must be not only prejudicial, but must\n      involve extraordinary hardship; the remedy by appeal\n      or writ of error must be utterly inadequate; and the\n      application   for  the   exercise  of   the  power of\n      superintending control must be speedy and prompt.\nId. at 285.     Pierce-Arrow, however, was a prohibition case\u2014\u2014not\n\na mandamus case.\n      \u00b613    Nonetheless, the principles outlined in Pierce-Arrow\nwere reiterated in a later prohibition case, State ex rel. Pabst\nv. Circuit Court for Milwaukee Cty., 184 Wis. 301, 304, 199 N.W.\n213 (1924).     However, that court went on to apply only some of\nthe   Pierce-Arrow   principles,      stating      \"[i]f    the    duty   of   the\ncircuit     court to abate     the   action against        the    Pabst   Brewing\n\nCompany were clear, and the relator did suffer extraordinary\nhardship by reason of the court's failure to perform its duty,\nand if he had no other adequate remedy, the duty of this court\nto assume jurisdiction is well settled.\"                   Id.     Notably, the\ncourt did not address the factor requiring that \"the application\nfor the exercise of the power of superintending control must be\nspeedy and prompt.\"\n      \u00b614    Likewise,    other      cases    did      not        uniformly     or\nconsistently    apply    the   Pierce-Arrow     principles.          Some     cases\n\nutilized only two.       First, \"[i]n order to entitle a party to a\nwrit of prohibition, the results of the error attacked must not\nonly be prejudicial to him but must [also] involve extraordinary\nhardship.\"      Kiekhaefer, 4     Wis. 2d     at    490    (emphasis omitted)\n(citing     Pierce-Arrow).        Second,    \"[i]t    is     a    further      well\nestablished principle that prohibition will not lie where there\n\n                                      10\n\f                                                                  No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n\nis an adequate remedy by appeal.\"                Id. at 491.     See also State\n\nex rel. Mitchell v. Superior Court of Dane Cty., 14 Wis. 2d 77,\n81, 109 N.W.2d 522 (1961) (\"Ordinarily such a writ should be\nissued       only   to    prevent    an   inferior     court    from    exercising\njurisdiction in a case where i[t] should not be exercised or\nassumed.       Nor should a writ of prohibition be issued if there is\nan adequate remedy by way of appeal, except where great hardship\nwould result.\") (internal citations omitted).                    However, other\ncases referenced all of the principles from Pierce-Arrow.                        For\nexample, in State ex rel. Beaudry v. Panosian, the court cited\nPierce-Arrow and affirmed a motion to quash a petition for a\nwrit of prohibition because \"from this record it cannot be said\n\nthat    the    justice     court's    'duty'     to   refrain   from    exercising\njurisdiction was plain.\"             Beaudry, 35 Wis. 2d at 425-26; see\nalso State ex rel. Lang v. Municipal Justice Court of Cudahy, 50\nWis. 2d 21, 23-24, 183 N.W.2d 43 (1971) (citing Pierce-Arrow);\nState    ex    rel.      Prentice    v.   Cty.

Oman v. Hunkins, 120 Wis. 2d 86, 91, 352 N.W.2d\n\n220 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Beaudry).               This court subsequently\nendorsed these four factors, and routinely applies them whenever\na party petitions for a supervisory writ.                 See Burnett v. Alt,\n224 Wis. 2d 72, 96-97, 589 N.W.2d 21 (1999); State ex rel. Kalal\nv.

Court of Appeals, Dist.\nIV., 2018 WI 25, \u00b69, 380 Wis. 2d 354, 909 N.W.2d 114.                          This was\nnot always the case.\n     \u00b616    Before adoption of the modern four-factor test, Wis.\nStat. ch. 817 (1975-76) provided guidance for writs of errors\nand appeals.     Parties asking the supreme court to exercise its\n\nsuperintending authority did so via an application or a petition\nfor a particular writ\u2014\u2014typically a writ of mandamus or a writ of\nprohibition.      In    1978,     the    typical    practice            changed      when\nWisconsin    revamped   its     court   system,    adding         the    intermediate\nappellate    court\u2014\u2014the    Wisconsin       Court   of   Appeals.              The    newly\nrevised     appellate     court     structure      required             revisions      to\nappellate    rules.     The     Judicial Council        drafted new rules              of\nappellate procedure, which this court enacted.                     Sup. Ct. Order,\n83 Wis. 2d xxvii (1978).          Two Rules, 809.51 and 809.71, created\nprocedural and filing guidance regarding writ practice in the\nappellate    courts.      Rule    809.51     applied    to    the       newly-created\ncourt of appeals, and Rule 809.71 applied to this court.                             Both\nRules were titled \"Supervisory Writ\" although this term did not\nappear in the text of the original statutes.                       See Wis. Stat.\n\u00a7\u00a7 (Rules) 809.51 & 809.71 (1977-78).\n                                        12\n\f                                                                           No.       2018AP291-W\n\n\n\n     \u00b617    The    text     of   the    court       of    appeals'       rule    said:       \"A\nperson     may    request       the    court        to    exercise       its    supervisory\njurisdiction       over     a    court . . . by             filing   a     petition         and\nsupporting memorandum.\"                The text          of the   supreme court             rule\nsaid:    \"A person may request the supreme court to exercise its\nsupervisory       jurisdiction . . . by                  filing      a     petition          in\naccordance with Rule 809.51.\"                 The term \"supervisory writ\" does\nappear in the second sentence of our current Rule 809.71:                                     \"A\nperson seeking a supervisory writ from the supreme court shall\nfirst file a petition for a supervisory writ in the court of\nappeals[,]\" but the term still does not appear in the text of\nRule 809.51.6\n\n     6 The full text of current Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 (Rules) 809.51 and\n809.71 provides:\n\n     809.51 Rule    (Supervisory    writ     and                               original\n     jurisdiction to issue prerogative writ).\n\n     (1) A person may request the court to exercise its\n     supervisory jurisdiction or its original jurisdiction\n     to issue a prerogative writ over a court and the\n     presiding judge, or other person or body, by filing a\n     petition and supporting memorandum.   The petition and\n     memorandum combined may not exceed 35 pages if a\n     monospaced font is used or 8,000 words if            a\n     proportional serif font is used. The petitioner shall\n     name as respondents the court and judge, or other\n     person or body, and all other parties in the action or\n     proceeding. The petition shall contain:\n\n     (a) A statement              of    the        issues    presented         by     the\n     controversy;\n\n     (b) A statement of the                         facts     necessary         to     an\n     understanding of the issues;\n\n     (c) The relief sought; and\n                                                                                 (continued)\n                                              13\n\f                                               No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n\n\n(d)   The   reasons   why    the   court   should    take\njurisdiction.\n\n(2) The court may deny the petition ex parte or may\norder the respondents to file a response with a\nsupporting memorandum, if any, and may order oral\nargument on the merits of the petition. The response\nand memorandum combined may not exceed 35 pages if a\nmonospaced font is used or 8,000 words if           a\nproportional serif font is used.      The respondents\nshall respond with supporting memorandum within 14\ndays after service of the order.     A respondent may\nfile a letter stating that he or she does not intend\nto file a response, but the petition is not thereby\nadmitted.\n\n(3) The court, upon a consideration of the petition,\nresponses, supporting memoranda and argument, may\ngrant or deny the petition or order such additional\nproceedings as it considers appropriate.   Costs and\nfees may be awarded against any party in a writ\nproceeding.\n\n(4) A person filing a petition under this section\nshall append to the petition a statement identifying\nwhether the petition is produced with a monospaced\nfont or with a proportional serif font.  If produced\nwith a proportional serif font, the person shall set\nforth the word count of the petition.\n\n809.71 Rule (Supervisory writ). A person may request\nthe   supreme  court   to  exercise   its  supervisory\njurisdiction over a court and the judge presiding\ntherein or other person or body by filing a petition\nin accordance with s. 809.51.     A person seeking a\nsupervisory writ from the supreme court shall first\nfile a petition for a supervisory writ in the court of\nappeals under s. 809.51 unless it is impractical to\nseek the writ in the court of appeals. A petition in\nthe supreme court shall show why it was impractical to\nseek the writ in the court of appeals or, if a\npetition had been filed in the court of appeals, the\ndisposition made and reasons given by the court of\nappeals.\n\n\n                            14\n\f                                                                     No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n\n     \u00b618    With the introduction of the term \"supervisory writ\"\nvia the new appellate rules, post-1978 cases attempted to draw\nfrom both the old, existing terminology and the new rules.                        The\nterm \"supervisory writ\" appears for the first time in Wisconsin\ncases in State v. Whitty, 86 Wis. 2d 380, 385, 272 N.W.2d 842\n\n(1978),    which     references    Wis.      Stat.    \u00a7\u00a7 (Rules)       809.51     and\n809.71.     Six years later, the current four-factor \"supervisory\nwrit\" test was explicitly declared in a 1984 court of appeals'\nper curiam opinion in Oman, 120 Wis. 2d at 91.                  Oman lists the\ntest with a citation to Beaudry.               Beaudry, as noted, does not\nexplicitly denominate a four-factor test, but instead cites to\nthe general principles set forth in Pierce-Arrow.\n\n     \u00b619    Dissecting      the   relevant      paragraph      in     Pierce-Arrow\nresults    in   a   list   of   seven   factors      guiding   the    exercise     of\nsuperintending authority:\n\n     (1) This jurisdiction is not to be exercised upon\n     light occasion, but only upon some grave exigency;\n\n     (2) The writs by which it is exercised will not be\n     used to perform the ordinary functions of an appeal or\n     writ of error;\n\n     (3) The duty of the court below must be plain;\n\n     (4) Its refusal to proceed within the line of such\n     duty or, on the other hand, its intent to proceed in\n     violation of such duty must be clear;\n\n     (5) The results must be not only prejudicial but must\n     involve extraordinary hardship;\n\n     (6) The remedy by appeal or writ of error must be\n     utterly inadequate;\n\n     (7) The application for the exercise of the power of\n     superintending control must be speedy and prompt.\n                                        15\n\f                                                                          No.    2018AP291-W\n\n\n\nPierce-Arrow, 143 Wis. at 285.\n\n     \u00b620    While the Oman court did not say how it arrived at the\nfour factors, it likely condensed these seven principles into\nfour factors given their overlap:\n\n     (1) An appeal is an inadequate remedy (see #2 and #6\n     of Pierce-Arrow);\n\n     (2) Grave hardship or irreparable                         harm    will    result\n     (see #1 and #5 of Pierce-Arrow);\n\n     (3) The duty of the trial court is plain and the court\n     must have acted or intend to act in violation of that\n     duty (see #3 and #4 of Pierce-Arrow);\n\n     (4) The request for relief is                         made       promptly      and\n     speedily (see #7 of Pierce-Arrow).\n     \u00b621    Alternatively, because the party in Oman sought two\nwrits\u2014\u2014a writ of mandamus and a writ of prohibition\u2014\u2014the Oman\ncourt may have applied factors derived from each of the tests\ntied to those writs, respectively.                     Mandamus requires:            \"(1) a\nclear     legal       right;   (2)   a      plain        and    positive        duty;     (3)\nsubstantial damages or injury should the relief not be granted,\nand (4) no other adequate remedy at law.\"                        Oman, 120 Wis. 2d at\n88 (citing Law Enf't Standards Bd. v.

This\nhistorical review reveals inconsistencies in writ law and the\nstandards governing our exercise of superintending authority.\n\n\n                                               17\n\f                                                                     No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n\n                            2.   Supervisory Writ\n      \u00b624   With the introduction of the term \"supervisory writ\"\nin 1978, our cases became less clear.                 The cases are silent as\nto whether the \"supervisory writ\" was an intentional invention\nor resulted fortuitously from the title the Judicial Council\ndrafters chose for Rules 809.51 and 809.71.                  It is also unclear\nwhether a supervisory writ existed as an independent writ under\nwhich    this    court   exercised    its        superintending      authority     or\nwhether it was simply a generic term providing the mechanism by\nwhich    parties   reached   the     appellate      courts    when    seeking     the\nexercise    of   supervisory     (court     of    appeals)   or   superintending\n(supreme court) authority.\n\n      \u00b625   Notably, just last term, in DNR, we referenced an 1874\n\ncase empowering this court to use both the traditional common\nlaw     writs    when    exercising     superintending         jurisdiction        or\n\"devise\" any new writs we might deem necessary:\n\n      We have previously observed that with the grant of\n      [art. VII, \u00a7 3 superintending] jurisdiction [over all\n      courts] come all the writs necessary to give it\n      effect:\n\n            The framers of the constitution appear to have\n            well     understood    that,    with     appellate\n            jurisdiction, the court took all common law writs\n            applicable   to   it;  and   with   superintending\n            control, all common law writs applicable to that;\n            and that, failing adequate common law writs, the\n            court might well devise new ones, as Lord Coke\n            tells us, as \"a secret in law.\"\n\n      Attorney Gen. v. Chicago & N.W. Ry. Co., 35 Wis. 425,\n      515 (1874) (construing our original constitution); see\n      State v. Buchanan, 2013 WI 31, \u00b611, 346 Wis. 2d 735,\n      828   N.W.2d   847   (\"As  the   court   of   original\n\n                                       18\n\f                                                                       No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n     jurisdiction,   we   have              discretion           to    issue     a\n     supervisory writ.\").\nDNR, 380 Wis. 2d 354, \u00b67 (footnote omitted).\n\n     \u00b626   This suggests our \"supervisory writ\" may in fact be a\nnew writ devised to exercise our superintending constitutional\nauthority.     But, the term \"supervisory writ\" also bears a second\nmeaning.     Since its appearance in 1978, a supervisory writ is\ncommonly     known    as     the    general       term   used     when     petitioning\nWisconsin appellate courts under Rules 809.51 and 809.71.                            This\n\nterminology,     regardless          of     whether       it     entered       the    law\nintentionally    or        fortuitously,        is    firmly     entrenched     in    our\njurisprudence,       and    we    have    never      explained    or   addressed      its\npurpose or presence.             This historical analysis does not provide\nclear answers, but the court takes this opportunity to clarify\nand acknowledge the dual purpose of the term supervisory writ.\nIt is both:     (1) the general term used in petitioning the court\nof appeals to exercise its constitutional supervisory authority7\nand in petitioning this court to exercise its constitutional\n\n\n\n\n     7 Article VII, \u00a7 5 of the Wisconsin Constitution gives the\ncourt of appeals \"supervisory authority\":\n\n     (3) The appeals court shall have such appellate\n     jurisdiction in the district, including jurisdiction\n     to   review   administrative   proceedings,   as   the\n     legislature may provide by law, but shall have no\n     original jurisdiction other than by prerogative writ.\n     The appeals court may issue all writs necessary in aid\n     of its jurisdiction and shall have supervisory\n     authority over all actions and proceedings in the\n     courts in the district.\n\n\n                                           19\n\f                                                                                   No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n\nsuperintending authority;8 and (2) a new writ this court devised\nindependent of the traditional common law writs.\n                  3.       Beaudry's jurisdictional distinction\n\n       \u00b627      Our    last      consideration         in   this     historical           analysis\naddresses        the        unexplained         discrepancy          in       our        case     law\nilluminated           in     State       ex    rel.     Beaudry          v.        Panosian,      35\nWis. 2d 418, 151 N.W.2d 48 (1967).                      Beaudry makes a distinction\nbetween jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional cases requesting\nthe    exercise of this court's superintending                             authority.9            The\ncourt      in   Beaudry         recognized     that     this    court's        constitutional\nsuperintending             authority     includes       \"the       power      to    issue       writs\nprohibiting           inferior         courts        from      acting         outside           their\n\njurisdiction\" and explained that \"[t]raditionally, this writ was\nused       to   keep       an     inferior      court       from     acting         outside       its\njurisdiction when there was no adequate                             remedy by            appeal    or\notherwise\"       but       the    \"use    of   the     writ    to    prohibit            action   by\ninferior        courts      and    tribunals      in    cases       of     nonjurisdictional\nerror\" was historically limited to situations \"where 'the appeal\n\n\n       8\n       The term \"supervisory\" is used in both Wis. Stat. \u00a7 (Rule)\n809.51 (court of appeals) and Wis. Stat. \u00a7 (Rule) 809.71\n(supreme court), but the Wisconsin Constitution uses the term\n\"supervisory authority\" with respect to the court of appeals and\nthe term \"superintending authority\" with respect to this court.\n       9\n       State ex rel. Beaudry v. Panosian, 35 Wis. 2d 418, 151\nN.W.2d 48 (1967), was not the only case to recognize the\ndistinction.     State ex rel. Kiekhaefer v. Anderson,           4\nWis. 2d 485, 490, 90 N.W.2d 790 (1958) and State ex rel. Gaynon\nv. Krueger, 31 Wis. 2d 609, 614, 143 N.W.2d 437 (1966) similarly\nacknowledge a jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional distinction.\n\n\n                                                20\n\f                                                                             No.    2018AP291-W\n\n\n\nmay come too late for effective redress, or be inadequate and\nthere is a need for such intervention to avoid grave hardship or\na complete denial of the rights of a litigant.'\"                             Id. at 421-22\n\n(quoted      source       omitted).          Beaudry,        at      least     implicitly,\nsuggested a lesser burden to secure superintending assistance\nfrom this court when addressing a jurisdictional error and a\ngreater      burden    when       the   case      presents       a    non-jurisdictional\nerror.       This makes sense, of course, because non-jurisdictional\nerrors are more likely to be remedied through the normal appeal\nprocess      than     purely       jurisdictional          errors,       as        this        case\nillustrates      well.        Indeed,     as      recently    as      2005,        this    court\ndispensed with the four-factor supervisory writ test in Davis,\n281    Wis. 2d 431,        \u00b617,     holding       that   \"the        requested          writ    of\nprohibition will issue if the John Doe judge acted in excess of\nhis powers.\"          In that case, the court concluded \"a John Doe\njudge does not have statutory or inherent power to require a\nwitness's counsel to take an oath of secrecy\" and on that basis\nalone granted the writ of prohibition.                       Id., \u00b6\u00b632-34.              Despite\nthis   distinction,         this    court    largely       ignored      any    substantive\ndifferences between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors\npost-Beaudry        and    continued        to    blur     the       general       principles\ninvolved in the writ cases.\n       \u00b628    Although Beaudry has never been overruled, it appears\ntime, lack of precision, and perhaps the commonplace use of the\nsupervisory         writ      has       eroded       any      distinction                between\njurisdictional        and     non-jurisdictional             categories            of     error.\nParties seeking a supervisory writ\u2014\u2014regardless of which category\n                                             21\n\f                                                                   No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n\nof error\u2014\u2014must satisfy the four-criteria supervisory writ test.\nThis test is well-known, easy to apply, and firmly entrenched in\nWisconsin law.\n                               B.   Application\n     \u00b629      This   court's   authority      to   issue    a   supervisory    writ\narises from the constitutional grant of jurisdiction in Article\nVII, \u00a7 3 of the Wisconsin Constitution, which provides:\n\n     (1) The supreme court shall have superintending and\n     administrative authority over all courts.\n\n     (2) The supreme court has appellate jurisdiction over\n     all   courts  and   may  hear   original actions  and\n     proceedings.   The supreme court may issue all writs\n     necessary in aid of its jurisdiction.\n\n     (3) The supreme court may review judgments and orders\n     of the court of appeals, may remove cases from the\n     court of appeals and may accept cases on certification\n     by the court of appeals.\nWe do not exercise this authority lightly; instead, we reserve\nthis jurisdiction for extraordinary circumstances.

First, there\n\n\n                                         22\n\f                                                            No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n\nmust be a plain duty violated by the Brown County Circuit Court\u2014\n\u2014in this case, the duty to refrain from exercising jurisdiction\nover a private arbitration with which it had no authority to\ninterfere.   We conclude the circuit court had a plain duty to\nact within its jurisdiction and a concomitant duty to refrain\nfrom acting beyond it.\n     \u00b632   Article VII, \u00a7 8 of the Wisconsin Constitution confers\nbroad   jurisdiction    on   Wisconsin   circuit   courts   to    hear   \"all\nmatters civil and criminal within this state,\" but not without\nexception:\n\n     Except as otherwise provided by law, the circuit court\n     shall have original jurisdiction in all matters civil\n     and criminal within this state and such appellate\n     jurisdiction in the circuit as the legislature may\n     prescribe by law.    The circuit court may issue all\n     writs necessary in aid of its jurisdiction.\n(Emphasis added.)      The Wisconsin Arbitration Act, Wis.

Rather,\nthe     insurer      intervened              in    the     arbitration             and     asked       the\narbitrator      to    stay        the    arbitration          until          coverage          could    be\ndetermined.        268 Wis. 2d 16, \u00b6109 (Roggensack, J., dissenting).\nSociety's reliance on American Girl is inapposite.

The circuit court compounded its\nerror   by   stopping          an    arbitration        proceeding           involving           three\nparties who were not participating in the court case at all and\ntherefore        had    no    opportunity       to    be       heard    on        an     order    that\naffected their rights.                 Accordingly, the first criterion for a\nsupervisory writ is met.\n\n     \u00b639     The second criterion for granting a supervisory writ\nrequires     a    showing       that    CityDeck      cannot         receive           an    adequate\nremedy through the ordinary appeal process.                                 This criterion is\nalso met.         Here, the circuit court acted beyond its original\njurisdiction           under     Article       VII,        \u00a7     8     of         the       Wisconsin\nConstitution           and    halted    a     private      arbitration             to       decide   a\n\nseparate coverage issue in the circuit court involving different\nparties.     There is no adequate appellate remedy for the circuit\ncourt's    unlawful act because                any    \"appeal          comes too            late for\neffective    redress\"          and     the    damage\u2014\u2014stopping              the    parties        from\nresolving        their       dispute    in    arbitration\u2014\u2014is               not    reparable         or\ncompensable.            See    DNR,     380    Wis. 2d 354,            \u00b641    (quoted          source\nomitted).        Challenging the circuit court's exercise of power via\na regular appeal would be futile.                     CityDeck would have to wait\nuntil the coverage issue was resolved before it could appeal and\n                                               27\n\f                                                                             No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n\nask    an    appellate    court      to      declare       the    circuit    court     had    no\nauthority to stay the arbitration.                     At that point, the wrongful\nexercise of authority over the arbitration either becomes moot\nif the circuit court allows the arbitration to proceed during\nthe appeal, or if the circuit court continues the stay pending\nthe appeal, CityDeck continues to be wrongly subjected to the\ncircuit court's exercise of authority it lacks.                             Either way, a\nregular appeal is inadequate as it comes \"too late for effective\nredress.\"      Id. (quoted source omitted).\n\n       \u00b640    Significantly, the appeal process continues to subject\nthe parties to the court system for resolving their dispute,\neffectively trampling their agreement to avoid court altogether.\n\nRather      than    serving    as    a       vehicle    for      vindicating       a   party's\nrights, the appeal exacerbates the injury.                           The damage is done\nand cannot be reversed.\n       \u00b641    Third,      we      consider          whether        grave     hardship        or\nirreparable harm will result if we do not issue the supervisory\nwrit.       We conclude that it would.                A litigant's right to be free\nfrom    the    exercise    of     the        court's    power      has   been      completely\ndenied.       The circuit court's unlawful stay order halted attempts\nby these private parties to resolve a construction dispute in\ntheir contractually-selected forum of arbitration.                            CityDeck was\ndeprived of the benefits of its bargained-for method of dispute\nresolution:          rather    than       avoiding      the      court     system,     it    was\nsubjected      to    an   order     issuing         from    it,    and     instead     of    its\ncontractually         agreed-upon            arbitration         progressing,          it    was\nindefinitely        delayed     by       a    court     acting      without        authority.\n                                               28\n\f                                                                          No.   2018AP291-W\n\n\n\nAdditionally, CityDeck was forced into public proceedings in a\nmatter it had contracted to resolve privately.                            These factors\nsatisfy the grave hardship/irreparable harm criterion.\n       \u00b642    Finally, CityDeck met the fourth criterion by acting\npromptly and speedily.               Although Society asserts that the 21\ndays    between       the    issuance      of     the   unlawful    stay        order   and\nCityDeck's          writ    filing    is    neither      prompt     nor     speedy,      we\ndisagree.       The circuit court issued the stay order on January 2,\n2018.        Two days later, on January 4, 2018, CityDeck filed a\nmotion for reconsideration with the circuit court, which the\ncircuit court ignored.               On January 11, 2018, the circuit court\nissued an order giving the parties permission to proceed with a\n\nplanned mediation.            Twelve days after that order, CityDeck filed\nits    writ    petition       in   the     court   of   appeals.         This    timeline\nsatisfies the \"prompt and speedy\" criterion.\n       \u00b643    CityDeck's       petition      fulfills     all     four    criteria      for\nissuance of a supervisory writ; therefore, we grant CityDeck's\nrequest       and    vacate    the       circuit    court's     order      staying      the\n\narbitration.\n       By the Court.\u2014The petition for a supervisory writ is\ngranted; the stay order is vacated.\n       \u00b644    REBECCA FRANK DALLET, J., withdrew from participation.\n\n\n\n\n                                             29\n\f                                                                      No.    2018AP291-W.awb\n\n\n      \u00b645       ANN WALSH BRADLEY, J.

Adopting an\nargument that CityDeck did not make, the majority's result is\nthat a supervisory writ, which is supposed to be reserved for\nthe most \"extraordinary\" or \"grievous\" situations, may become\ncommonplace.\n\n\n\n                                               1\n\f                                                                                No.    2018AP291-W.awb\n\n\n     \u00b648     In        my     view,         CityDeck         has       not     met     a    necessary\nprerequisite for the issuance of a supervisory writ.                                       Mere delay\nin arbitration proceedings is not the type of \"grave hardship\"\nor \"irreparable harm\" that entitles a party to such a writ.\n     \u00b649     Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n                                                       I\n     \u00b650     Although          the     majority            spills       a    great     deal    of       ink\nexploring        the    history         of       writ       procedures         in     Wisconsin,         it\nultimately purports to reaffirm and apply the familiar and well-\n\nestablished        four-factor               test          for      determining            whether        a\nsupervisory            writ       is        an        appropriate            remedy        under        the\ncircumstances.\n     \u00b651     As the majority correctly explains, \"[a] party seeking\nthe issuance of a supervisory writ must establish four factors:\n(1) a circuit court had a plain duty and either acted or intends\nto   act    in    violation            of    that          duty;       (2)    'an     appeal       is    an\ninadequate remedy;' (3) 'grave hardship or irreparable harm will\n\nresult;'     and       (4)     the      party          requested         relief       'promptly         and\nspeedily.'\"         Majority op., \u00b630 (citing DNR. v.

The irreparable\nharm claimed by CityDeck is a simple delay in its arbitration\nproceedings.      In my view, the fact that CityDeck's arbitration\nis delayed, without more, is insufficient to show grave hardship\nor irreparable harm.\n     \u00b653    The harm caused by any such delay is not similar to\nthe harm suffered by parties that previously sought and obtained\nsupervisory writs.        In prior cases, the petitioner would have\n\nsuffered a complete denial of a right in a way that could not be\nundone or remedied in the absence of a supervisory writ\u2014\u2014that\nis, the \"bells\" in those cases could not be \"unrung.\"\n     \u00b654    For example, courts have determined that the failure\nto   substitute      a   judge     when       required     by    law    constitutes\nirreparable harm.

App. 2012).\nFinally, in DNR, 380 Wis. 2d 354, \u00b647, this court determined\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                                                                   No.   2018AP291-W.awb\n\n\nthat   the failure to honor an                appellant's statutory           right      to\nchoice of venue constituted irreparable harm.\n       \u00b655     Ignoring this case law, CityDeck fails to make any\npersuasive argument that the delay caused by the circuit court's\nstay of the arbitration proceedings constitutes grave hardship\nor irreparable harm.            CityDeck's \"argument\" with regard to this\nfactor is tucked away in the very last paragraph of its 28-page\nbrief-in-chief.1\n       \u00b656     It     baldly    asserts       that,   in     the     absence       of    a\n\nsupervisory writ, it will incur unspecified \"substantial damages\nfor    which    there     is    no   adequate     remedy.\"         CityDeck    further\ncomplains that \"[t]he inability to resolve the arbitration and\nthe indefinite delay resulting from the Stay Order has already\ncaused       substantial       damage    to   CityDeck's     interests       and     will\ncontinue to do so until it is lifted.\"\n       \u00b657     In my view, CityDeck is not being denied its right to\narbitrate       its    claims.          Arbitration   is   merely        delayed,       not\n\ndenied.2       CityDeck loses no statutory right and it loses no\ncontractual right.\n       \u00b658     What about the delay in the arbitration proceedings\ncannot be remedied with money, such as interest on CityDeck's\n\n\n       1   CityDeck did not          supplement its argument in             its     reply\nbrief.\n       2\n       This is an important distinction that is either lost on,\nor ignored by, the majority.      See, e.g., majority op., \u00b639\n(characterizing the \"damage\" in the instant case as \"stopping\nthe parties from resolving their dispute in arbitration\")\n(emphasis added).\n\n\n                                              4\n\f                                                                       No.   2018AP291-W.awb\n\n\njudgment if it is successful in arbitration?                            Indeed, at oral\nargument, CityDeck asserted that \"the irreparable harm is that\nwe continue to lose money that we will not recover because of\nthe delay associated with our arbitration proceedings.\"                            Exactly\nhow will the loss of money from delay result in grave hardship\nor irreparable harm?                CityDeck does not explain, so the majority\n\nconjures its own justification.\n       \u00b659       Putting on its advocacy hat, the majority sua sponte\ndiscovers a new type of irreparable harm.                           In the majority's\n\nbroad view, CityDeck suffers irreparable harm by the delay of\narbitration proceedings because \"[a] litigant's right to be free\nfrom       the    exercise     of    the   court's       power   has    been     completely\ndenied.\"         Majority op., \u00b641.\n       \u00b660       If    this    is   the    thrust    of    the   injury      (i.e.,    being\nsubject          to   a   court's      power    despite      that      court's    lack       of\njurisdiction), then the majority has short-circuited Wisconsin's\nsupervisory writ procedure.                   It treats jurisdictional errors as\n\na    special          class    of    errors    for       which   the    issuance       of     a\nsupervisory writ appears to be all but a certainty.3\n       \u00b661       Following the majority's logic, would a defendant be\nentitled to a supervisory writ if a motion to dismiss for lack\nof   subject          matter   jurisdiction        was    erroneously        denied?        See\nRichards v. Young, 150 Wis. 2d 549, 557, 441 N.W.2d 742 (1989)\n\n\n       3\n       Although the majority expressly rejects the proposition\nthat jurisdictional errors are treated differently under our\nwrit procedure than non-jurisdictional errors, its analysis\nbelies that assertion. See majority op., \u00b627.\n\n\n                                               5\n\f                                                                         No.    2018AP291-W.awb\n\n\n(\"This      court    has        previously        held     that     if     the       statutory\nrequirements        for        obtaining     judicial       review        are       not   fully\ncomplied with, the subject matter jurisdiction of the circuit\ncourt cannot be invoked.\").\n      \u00b662    Is a supervisory writ to be employed whenever it is\nasserted that a circuit court exercised personal jurisdiction\ndespite a fundamental defect in service?                         See Johnson v. Cintas\n\nCorp.

See State v.

See\nmajority op., \u00b638.              Further, the ordinary appeals process will\n\nbe inadequate because an appeal would always \"come[] too late\"\nto   effectively         redress    the      error.       Id.,     \u00b639     (quoted        source\nomitted).        The      harm     to   the    defendant          would        be   considered\nirreparable because, for the duration of the case, the defendant\nwould be \"completely denied\" the \"right to be free from the\nexercise of the court's power.\"                Id., \u00b641.\n      \u00b664    If there is a principle under which the majority's\nanalysis     would       not    apply   to    all     jurisdictional            errors,    that\nprinciple is well hidden.

A supervisory writ should\nbe a last resort, not a first option.\n      \u00b665    In sum, the majority has placed itself in the role of\nCityDeck's attorneys, relying on arguments not made in order to\nissue a writ to which CityDeck is not entitled.                        In doing so,\nthe   majority      improperly    elevates        jurisdictional       errors     as   a\nspecial     class   of   errors   that      can   always   be   redressed       via    a\nsupervisory      writ    regardless      of    the    specific     facts     of    any\nparticular case.         The majority's reasoning is incompatible with\n\nWisconsin's supervisory writ jurisprudence that has consistently\ndescribed a supervisory writ as an \"extraordinary and drastic\nremedy\"     reserved     for   only   the     most    \"grievous       exigenc[ies].\"\nKalal, 271 Wis. 2d 633, \u00b617.\n\n      \u00b666    For the reasons set forth, I respectfully dissent.\n      \u00b667    I am authorized to state that SHIRLEY S.

CityDeck Landing LLC petitions this court, pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 (Rule) 809.71 (2015-16),1 for a supervisory writ. CityDeck asks this court to exercise its superintending constitutional authority to vacate the circuit court's2 order. CityDeck asserts the circuit court exceeded its jurisdiction by putting the private arbitration3 on hold, and that a supervisory writ is necessary to correct the circuit court's extra-jurisdictional act. We hold the circuit court lacked the authority to issue the order staying the arbitration, the requirements necessary to issue a supervisory writ have been satisfied, and the stay order must be vacated.\nI. BACKGROUND\n\u00b62 In December 2013, CityDeck hired Smet Construction Services Corporation as its general contractor to construct an apartment building called \"CityDeck Residences\" in Green Bay. Smet hired subcontractors, including GB Builders of Northeastern Wisconsin, LLC; Lunda Construction Company; Security-Luebke Roofing, *523Inc.; and Lakeland Construction, Inc. The construction contract required any disputes to be resolved by arbitration. A dispute arose and in May 2016, CityDeck filed for arbitration against Smet, alleging breach of the construction contract and theft by contractor. It filed an amended demand for arbitration in November 2016. In July 2017, Smet sought to bring the subcontractors into the arbitration because it contended the subcontractors were responsible for the problems and each of the subcontracts contained an indemnity provision requiring the subcontractor to \"defend, indemnify and hold [Smet] harmless.\" Most of the subcontractors voluntarily joined the arbitration. GB Builders notified its insurer, Society Insurance, of the claim, and Society hired an attorney to represent GB Builders under a reservation of rights. In August 2017, Smet tendered the defense of the CityDeck claim to Society, asserting it was an additional insured under the insurance policy Society issued to GB Builders. In October 2017, GB Builders filed an answer to Smet's demand for arbitration, asking the arbitrator for dismissal. The arbitrator scheduled the arbitration hearing for March 1, 2018. *836\u00b63 In October 2017, however, Society Insurance filed a declaratory judgment complaint in Brown County Circuit Court against CityDeck, Smet, and GB Builders. Society sought a declaration \"on the scope of its insurance duties\" to Smet and GB Builders with respect to CityDeck's construction claims under arbitration. Society asked the circuit court to stay the arbitration until it could decide the insurance coverage issue. The circuit court granted Society's request and ordered the arbitration stayed on January 2, 2018.\n\u00b64 CityDeck asserted the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to order a private arbitration stayed, particularly when the circuit court action and the arbitration *524involved different issues and different parties; three subcontractors who were parties to the arbitration were not named in the circuit court suit. CityDeck filed a motion asking the circuit court to reconsider its decision. The circuit court ignored CityDeck's motion to reconsider, and CityDeck filed a petition for a supervisory writ in the court of appeals. The court of appeals construed the petition as an appeal from a non-final order and denied the petition. CityDeck filed a petition for a supervisory writ with this court. We accepted jurisdiction over CityDeck's petition and heard oral argument.\nII. ANALYSIS\nA. Historical Analysis\n\u00b65 Wisconsin cases contain inconsistencies regarding writ procedure, terminology, and the standards applicable to the exercise of our constitutional superintending authority. For the sake of clarity, we set forth the history of writs requested under our superintending authority, the origin of the term \"supervisory writ,\" and an unexplained discrepancy in our cases illuminated in State ex rel. Beaudry v. Panosian, 35 Wis. 2d 418, 151 N.W.2d 48 (1967).\n1. History of writ procedure\n\u00b66 Article VII, \u00a7 3 of the Wisconsin Constitution gives the supreme court \"superintending and administrative authority over all courts\" and the ability to \"issue all writs necessary in aid of its jurisdiction.\"4\n*525Interpreting this provision, this court held that \"[the supreme court] was endowed with a separate and independent jurisdiction, which enables and requires it in a proper case to control the course of ordinary litigation in such inferior courts, and was also endowed with all the common-law writs applicable to that jurisdiction.\" State ex rel. Fourth Nat'l Bank of Phila. v. Johnson, 103 Wis. 591, 613, 79 N.W. 1081 (1899). This court concluded that \"when the makers of the constitution used the words 'superintending control over all inferior courts' they definitely referred to that well-known superintending jurisdiction of the court of king's bench.\" Id. at 614, 79 N.W. 1081. \"The two great writs by which this superintending jurisdiction was principally exercised by the court of King's bench were the writs of mandamus and prohibition; the one directing action by the inferior court, and the other forbidding action.\" Id.\n\u00b67 A writ of prohibition \"restrain[s] a court in the exercise of judicial functions outside or beyond its jurisdiction, and when there is no other adequate remedy.\"\n*837State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Circuit Court of Eau Claire Cty., 97 Wis. 1, 15, 72 N.W. 193 (1897). See also State ex rel. De Puy v. Evans, 88 Wis. 255, 263, 60 N.W. 433 (1894) (\"So this court has repeatedly held that under our statutes such writ issues only to restrain the acts of a court or other inferior tribunal exercising some judicial power which it has no legal authority to exercise at all.\"); State ex rel. Kellogg v. Gary, 33 Wis. 93, 98 (1873) (\"It does not issue to restrain the acts of either *526executive or administrative officers, but only those of a court or other inferior tribunal engaged in the exercise of some judicial power, and that not merely in a manner not authorized by law, but it must also be in defiance of law, or without any legal authority whatever for that purpose.\").\n\u00b68 Prior to 1921, it was the rule in Wisconsin \"that prohibition will not lie against a judge of a lower court except in a situation where such judge is exceeding his jurisdiction.\" State ex rel. Kiekhaefer v. Anderson, 4 Wis. 2d 485, 490, 90 N.W.2d 790 (1958). However, the rule changed so that \"prohibition may be invoked in case of a non-jurisdictional error in a situation where appeal from the judgment would come too late for effective redress and great hardship would result if such writ were not issued.\" Id.

This court explained in Attorney General: \"Having held that the attempt to punish the publication in question as contempt was in excess of the jurisdiction of the circuit court, no reason is seen why the writ is not an apt and proper remedy, unless, indeed, there be other adequate remedies.\" Attorney Gen., 97 Wis. at 15, 72 N.W. 193. The court proceeded to rule out the use of other writs and concluded that a writ of prohibition was appropriate. Id.\n\u00b610 While Fourth National Bank explained the court's superintending power, it specifically dealt with the issuance of a writ of mandamus. 103 Wis. at 618, 79 N.W. 1081. The court stated that \"unless there be adequate remedy for such denial in the regular exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of this court, it is difficult to see why the superintending jurisdiction should not be exercised to quash the neglect or refusal of the circuit court, and compel it to act within its jurisdiction.\" Id. at 621, 79 N.W. 1081.\n*838\u00b611 In addition, Fourth National Bank created several principles for issuing a writ of mandamus. First, \"[t]he general rule of law undoubtedly is that mandamus will not lie where there is a remedy by appeal or writ of error. But the remedy by appeal must be substantially adequate in order to prevent relief by mandamus.\" Id. at 622, 79 N.W. 1081 (internal citations omitted). Second, \"[i]t is very plain that, if the creditors are to exercise their rights with any prospect of benefit, they *528must exercise them promptly.\" Id. Third, \"reliance is placed upon the well-known principle that mandamus will not lie to control the exercise of discretion.\" Id. Fourth, \"[w]here it clearly appears that discretion has been not merely abused, but not exercised at all, or that the action taken by the inferior court is without semblance of legal cause, and no other adequate remedy exists, mandamus will lie to compel the specific action which should have been taken.\" Id. at 623, 79 N.W. 1081. Fifth, \"[t]he duty of the court must be plain, the refusal to proceed within its jurisdiction to perform that duty must be clear, the results of such refusal prejudicial, the remedy, if any, by appeal or writ of error utterly inadequate, and the application for relief by mandamus speedy and prompt, in order to justify the issuance of the writ.\" Id. at 623-24, 79 N.W. 1081.\n\u00b612 It appears, however, that the requirements outlined in Fourth National Bank for a writ of mandamus became requirements for all writs issued under the court's supervisory powers. In 1907, in a mandamus case, the court wrote that it would apply its supervisory control only \"where the duty of the inferior court to act within its jurisdiction or to refrain from going beyond its jurisdiction is plain and imperative, where such court threatens to violate that duty to the substantial prejudice of the rights of the petitioner, where all other remedies are inadequate, and the application for relief [is] prompt.\" State ex rel. Milwaukee Elec. Ry. &amp; Light Co. v. Circuit Court for Rock Cty., 133 Wis. 442, 444, 113 N.W. 722 (1907) (citing Fourth Nat'l Bank ). That case, Fourth National Bank, and two other mandamus cases,5 were then cited in *529State ex rel. Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Co. v. Circuit Court of Milwaukee Cty., 143 Wis. 282, 127 N.W. 998 (1910), as principles for exercising general superintending control. The court stated:\nThose principles in substance are that this [superintending] jurisdiction is not to be exercised upon light occasion, but only upon some grave exigency; that the writs by which it is exercised will not be used to perform the ordinary functions of an appeal or writ of error; that the duty of the court below must be plain; its refusal to proceed within the line of such duty, or, on the other hand, its intent to proceed in violation of such duty must be clear; the results must be not only prejudicial, but must involve extraordinary hardship; the remedy by appeal or writ of error must be utterly inadequate; and the application for the exercise of the power of superintending control must be speedy and prompt.\nId. at 285, 127 N.W. 998. Pierce-Arrow, however, was a prohibition case-not a mandamus case.\n\u00b613 Nonetheless, the principles outlined in Pierce-Arrow were reiterated in a later prohibition case, State ex rel. Pabst v. Circuit Court for Milwaukee Cty., 184 Wis. 301, 304, 199 N.W. 213 (1924). However, that court went on to apply only some of the Pierce-Arrow principles, stating \"[i]f the duty of the circuit court to abate the *839action against the Pabst Brewing Company were clear, and the relator did suffer extraordinary hardship by reason of the court's failure to perform its duty, and if he had no other adequate remedy, the duty of this court to assume jurisdiction is well settled.\" Id. Notably, the court did not address the factor requiring that \"the application for the exercise of the power of superintending control must be speedy and prompt.\"\n\u00b614 Likewise, other cases did not uniformly or consistently apply the Pierce-Arrow principles. Some *530cases utilized only two. First, \"[i]n order to entitle a party to a writ of prohibition, the results of the error attacked must not only be prejudicial to him but must [also] involve extraordinary hardship.\" Kiekhaefer, 4 Wis. 2d at 490, 90 N.W.2d 790 (emphasis omitted) (citing Pierce-Arrow ). Second, \"[i]t is a further well established principle that prohibition will not lie where there is an adequate remedy by appeal.\" Id., at 491, 90 N.W.2d 790. See also State ex rel. Mitchell v. Superior Court of Dane Cty., 14 Wis. 2d 77, 81, 109 N.W.2d 522 (1961) (\"Ordinarily such a writ should be issued only to prevent an inferior court from exercising jurisdiction in a case where i[t] should not be exercised or assumed. Nor should a writ of prohibition be issued if there is an adequate remedy by way of appeal, except where great hardship would result.\") (internal citations omitted). However, other cases referenced all of the principles from Pierce-Arrow. For example, in State ex rel. Beaudry v. Panosian, the court cited Pierce-Arrow and affirmed a motion to quash a petition for a writ of prohibition because \"from this record it cannot be said that the justice court's 'duty' to refrain from exercising jurisdiction was plain.\" Beaudry, 35 Wis.2d at 425-26, 151 N.W.2d 48 ; see also State ex rel. Lang v. Municipal Justice Court of Cudahy, 50 Wis. 2d 21, 23-24, 183 N.W.2d 43 (1971) (citing Pierce-Arrow ); State ex rel. Prentice v. Cty. Court, Milwaukee Cty., 70 Wis .2d 230, 234-35, 234 N.W.2d 283 (1975) (citing Pierce Arrow and Beaudry ).\n\u00b615 Eventually, the principles developed in Pierce-Arrow and cited in Beaudry merged into a four-factor test:\nA petition for a supervisory writ will not be granted unless: (1) an appeal is an inadequate remedy; (2) grave hardship or irreparable harm will result;\n*531(3) the duty of the trial court is plain and it must have acted or intends to act in violation of that duty[;] and (4) the request for relief is made promptly and speedily.\nState ex rel. Oman v. Hunkins, 120 Wis. 2d 86, 91, 352 N.W.2d 220 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Beaudry ). This court subsequently endorsed these four factors, and routinely applies them whenever a party petitions for a supervisory writ. See Burnett v. Alt, 224 Wis. 2d 72, 96-97, 589 N.W.2d 21 (1999) ; State ex rel. Kalal v. Circuit Court for Dane Cty., 2004 WI 58, \u00b6 17, 271 Wis. 2d 633, 681 N.W.2d 110 ; DNR v. Wis. Court of Appeals, Dist. IV., 2018 WI 25, \u00b6 9, 380 Wis. 2d 354, 909 N.W.2d 114. This was not always the case.\n\u00b616 Before adoption of the modern four-factor test, Wis. Stat. ch. 817 (1975-76) provided guidance for writs of errors and appeals. Parties asking the supreme court to exercise its superintending authority did so via an application or a petition for a particular writ-typically a writ of mandamus or a writ of prohibition. In 1978, the typical practice changed when Wisconsin revamped its court system, adding the intermediate appellate court-the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. The newly revised appellate court structure required revisions to appellate rules. The Judicial Council drafted new rules of appellate procedure, which this court enacted.\n*840Sup. Ct. Order, 83 Wis. 2d xxvii (1978). Two Rules, 809.51 and 809.71, created procedural and filing guidance regarding writ practice in the appellate courts. Rule 809.51 applied to the newly-created court of appeals, and Rule 809.71 applied to this court. Both Rules were titled \"Supervisory Writ\" although this term did not appear in the text of the original statutes. See Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 (Rules) 809.51 &amp; 809.71 (1977-78).\n*532\u00b617 The text of the court of appeals' rule said: \"A person may request the court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction over a court ... by filing a petition and supporting memorandum.\" The text of the supreme court rule said: \"A person may request the supreme court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction ... by filing a petition in accordance with Rule 809.51.\" The term \"supervisory writ\" does appear in the second sentence of our current Rule 809.71: \"A person seeking a supervisory writ from the supreme court shall first file a petition for a supervisory writ in the court of appeals[,]\" but the term still does not appear in the text of Rule 809.51.6\n*533\u00b618 With the introduction of the term \"supervisory writ\" via the new appellate rules, post-1978 cases attempted to draw from both the old, existing terminology and the new rules. The term \"supervisory writ\" appears for the first time in Wisconsin cases in State v. Whitty, 86 Wis. 2d 380, 385, 272 N.W.2d 842 (1978), which references Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 (Rules) 809.51 and 809.71. Six years later, the current four-factor *841\"supervisory writ\" test was explicitly declared in a 1984 court of appeals' per curiam opinion in Oman, 120 Wis. 2d at 91, 352 N.W.2d 220. Oman lists the test with a citation to Beaudry. Beaudry, as noted, does not explicitly denominate a four-factor test, but instead cites to the general principles set forth in Pierce-Arrow.\n\u00b619 Dissecting the relevant paragraph in Pierce-Arrow results in a list of seven factors guiding the exercise of superintending authority:\n*534(1) This jurisdiction is not to be exercised upon light occasion, but only upon some grave exigency;\n(2) The writs by which it is exercised will not be used to perform the ordinary functions of an appeal or writ of error;\n(3) The duty of the court below must be plain;\n(4) Its refusal to proceed within the line of such duty or, on the other hand, its intent to proceed in violation of such duty must be clear;\n(5) The results must be not only prejudicial but must involve extraordinary hardship;\n(6) The remedy by appeal or writ of error must be utterly inadequate;\n(7) The application for the exercise of the power of superintending control must be speedy and prompt.\nPierce-Arrow, 143 Wis. at 285, 127 N.W. 998.\n\u00b620 While the Oman court did not say how it arrived at the four factors, it likely condensed these seven principles into four factors given their overlap:\n(1) An appeal is an inadequate remedy (see #2 and #6 of Pierce-Arrow );\n(2) Grave hardship or irreparable harm will result (see #1 and #5 of Pierce-Arrow );\n(3) The duty of the trial court is plain and the court must have acted or intend to act in violation of that duty (see #3 and #4 of Pierce-Arrow );\n(4) The request for relief is made promptly and speedily (see #7 of Pierce-Arrow ).\n\u00b621 Alternatively, because the party in Oman sought two writs-a writ of mandamus and a writ of prohibition-the Oman court may have applied factors *535derived from each of the tests tied to those writs, respectively. Mandamus requires: \"(1) a clear legal right; (2) a plain and positive duty; (3) substantial damages or injury should the relief not be granted, and (4) no other adequate remedy at law.\" Oman, 120 Wis. 2d at 88, 352 N.W.2d 220 (citing Law Enf't Standards Bd. v. Village of Lyndon Station, 101 Wis. 2d 472, 493-94, 305 N.W.2d 89 (1981), which actually lists two additional factors not mentioned, including \"no laches\" and \"no special reasons\" making the remedy \"inequitable.\").\n\u00b622 As Wisconsin appellate courts grappled with the language of the older cases, together with the post-1978 body of cases, profuse variations of both terminology and tests appeared in our modern writ cases. Cases sometimes referred to \"supervisory writs\" and sometimes referred to a specific common law writ. Some courts combined the old and new terminology into \"supervisory writ of prohibition.\" See State ex rel. Godfrey &amp; Kahn, S.C. v. Circuit Court for Milwaukee Cty., 2012 WI App 120, \u00b6\u00b6 48-50, 344 Wis. 2d 610, 823 N.W.2d 816 (granting a \"supervisory writ of prohibition\" after applying four-factor test because trial judge exceeded authority); State ex rel. Individual Subpoenaed to Appear at Waukesha Cty. v. Davis, 2005 WI 70, 281 Wis. 2d 431, 697 N.W.2d 803 (court granted a \"writ of prohibition,\" but did not apply four-factor test);\n*842State ex rel. Garibay v. Circuit Court for Kenosha Cty., 2002 WI App 164, \u00b6 2, 256 Wis. 2d 438, 647 N.W.2d 455 (denied petition for \"supervisory writ.\").\n\u00b623 Attempting to define \"supervisory writ,\" the court of appeals described it as \"a blending of the writ of mandamus and the writ of prohibition.\" State ex rel. Dressler v. Circuit Court for Racine Cty., 163 Wis .2d 622, 630, 472 N.W.2d 532 (Ct. App. 1991)\n*536(citing Oman ). This court likewise adopted this definition. See Madison Metro. Sch. Dist. v. Circuit Court for Dane Cty., 2011 WI 72, \u00b6 74, 336 Wis. 2d 95, 800 N.W.2d 442 ; DNR, 380 Wis. 2d 354, \u00b6 8, 909 N.W.2d 114. Nevertheless, courts continued to distinguish between writs of prohibition and writs of mandamus. See Madison Metro. Sch. Dist., 336 Wis. 2d 95, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 75-76, 800 N.W.2d 442. This historical review reveals inconsistencies in writ law and the standards governing our exercise of superintending authority.\n2. Supervisory Writ\n\u00b624 With the introduction of the term \"supervisory writ\" in 1978, our cases became less clear. The cases are silent as to whether the \"supervisory writ\" was an intentional invention or resulted fortuitously from the title the Judicial Council drafters chose for Rules 809.51 and 809.71. It is also unclear whether a supervisory writ existed as an independent writ under which this court exercised its superintending authority or whether it was simply a generic term providing the mechanism by which parties reached the appellate courts when seeking the exercise of supervisory (court of appeals) or superintending (supreme court) authority.\n\u00b625 Notably, just last term, in DNR, we referenced an 1874 case empowering this court to use both the traditional common law writs when exercising superintending jurisdiction or \"devise\" any new writs we might deem necessary:\nWe have previously observed that with the grant of [ art. VII, \u00a7 3 superintending] jurisdiction [over all courts] come all the writs necessary to give it effect:\nThe framers of the constitution appear to have well understood that, with appellate jurisdiction, *537the court took all common law writs applicable to it; and with superintending control, all common law writs applicable to that; and that, failing adequate common law writs, the court might well devise new ones, as Lord Coke tells us, as \"a secret in law.\"\nAttorney Gen. v. Chicago &amp; N.W. Ry. Co., 35 Wis. 425, 515 (1874) (construing our original constitution); see State v. Buchanan, 2013 WI 31, \u00b6 11, 346 Wis. 2d 735, 828 N.W.2d 847 (\"As the court of original jurisdiction, we have discretion to issue a supervisory writ.\").\nDNR, 380 Wis. 2d 354, \u00b6 7, 909 N.W.2d 114 (footnote omitted).\n\u00b626 This suggests our \"supervisory writ\" may in fact be a new writ devised to exercise our superintending constitutional authority. But, the term \"supervisory writ\" also bears a second meaning. Since its appearance in 1978, a supervisory writ is commonly known as the general term used when petitioning Wisconsin appellate courts under Rules 809.51 and 809.71. This terminology, regardless of whether it entered the law intentionally or fortuitously, is firmly entrenched in our jurisprudence, and we have never explained or addressed its purpose or presence. This historical analysis does not provide clear answers, but the court takes this opportunity to clarify and acknowledge the dual purpose of the term supervisory writ. It is both: (1) the general term used in petitioning the court of appeals to exercise its constitutional supervisory authority7 and in petitioning *843this court to exercise *538its constitutional superintending authority;8 and (2) a new writ this court devised independent of the traditional common law writs.\n3. Beaudry's jurisdictional distinction\n\u00b627 Our last consideration in this historical analysis addresses the unexplained discrepancy in our case law illuminated in State ex rel. Beaudry v. Panosian, 35 Wis. 2d 418, 151 N.W.2d 48 (1967). Beaudry makes a distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional cases requesting the exercise of this court's superintending authority.9 The court in Beaudry recognized that this court's constitutional superintending authority includes \"the power to issue writs prohibiting inferior courts from acting outside their jurisdiction\" and explained that \"[t]raditionally, this writ was used to keep an inferior court from acting outside its jurisdiction when there was no adequate remedy by appeal or otherwise\" but the \"use of the writ to prohibit action by inferior courts and tribunals in cases of nonjurisdictional error\" was historically limited *539to situations \"where 'the appeal may come too late for effective redress, or be inadequate and there is a need for such intervention to avoid grave hardship or a complete denial of the rights of a litigant.' \" Id., at 421-22, 151 N.W.2d 48 (quoted source omitted). Beaudry, at least implicitly, suggested a lesser burden to secure superintending assistance from this court when addressing a jurisdictional error and a greater burden when the case presents a non-jurisdictional error. This makes sense, of course, because non-jurisdictional errors are more likely to be remedied through the normal appeal process than purely jurisdictional errors, as this case illustrates well. Indeed, as recently as 2005, this court dispensed with the four-factor supervisory writ test in Davis, 281 Wis. 2d 431, \u00b6 17, 697 N.W.2d 803, holding that \"the requested writ of prohibition will issue if the John Doe judge acted in excess of his powers.\" In that case, the court concluded \"a John Doe judge does not have statutory or inherent power to require a witness's counsel to take an oath of secrecy\" and on that basis alone granted the writ of prohibition. Id., \u00b6\u00b6 32-34. Despite this distinction, this court largely ignored any substantive differences between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors post- Beaudry and continued to blur the general principles involved in the writ cases.\n\u00b628 Although Beaudry has never been overruled, it appears time, lack of precision, and perhaps the commonplace use of the supervisory writ has eroded any distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional categories of error. Parties seeking a supervisory writ-regardless of which category of error-must satisfy the *844four-criteria supervisory writ test. This test is well-known, easy to apply, and firmly entrenched in Wisconsin law. *540B. Application\n\u00b629 This court's authority to issue a supervisory writ arises from the constitutional grant of jurisdiction in Article VII, \u00a7 3 of the Wisconsin Constitution, which provides:\n(1) The supreme court shall have superintending and administrative authority over all courts.\n(2) The supreme court has appellate jurisdiction over all courts and may hear original actions and proceedings. The supreme court may issue all writs necessary in aid of its jurisdiction.\n(3) The supreme court may review judgments and orders of the court of appeals, may remove cases from the court of appeals and may accept cases on certification by the court of appeals.\nWe do not exercise this authority lightly; instead, we reserve this jurisdiction for extraordinary circumstances. See DNR, 380 Wis. 2d 354, \u00b6 8, 909 N.W.2d 114 ; Dressler, 163 Wis. 2d at 630, 472 N.W.2d 532.\n\u00b630 A party seeking the issuance of a supervisory writ must establish four factors: (1) a circuit court had a plain duty and either acted or intends to act in violation of that duty; (2) \"an appeal is an inadequate remedy;\" (3) \"grave hardship or irreparable harm will result;\" and (4) the party requested relief \"promptly and speedily.\" DNR, 380 Wis. 2d 354, \u00b6 9, 909 N.W.2d 114 (quoting Kalal, 271 Wis. 2d 633, \u00b6 17, 681 N.W.2d 110 ).\n\u00b631 In deciding whether to grant the writ requested by CityDeck, we consider the four criteria in turn. First, there must be a plain duty violated by the *541Brown County Circuit Court-in this case, the duty to refrain from exercising jurisdiction over a private arbitration with which it had no authority to interfere. We conclude the circuit court had a plain duty to act within its jurisdiction and a concomitant duty to refrain from acting beyond it.\n\u00b632 Article VII, \u00a7 8 of the Wisconsin Constitution confers broad jurisdiction on Wisconsin circuit courts to hear \"all matters civil and criminal within this state,\" but not without exception:\nExcept as otherwise provided by law, the circuit court shall have original jurisdiction in all matters civil and criminal within this state and such appellate jurisdiction in the circuit as the legislature may prescribe by law. The circuit court may issue all writs necessary in aid of its jurisdiction.\n(Emphasis added.) The Wisconsin Arbitration Act, Wis. Stat. ch. 788, comprises one constitutionally-permissible exception to a circuit court's original jurisdiction:\nA provision in any written contract to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of the contract, or out of the refusal to perform the whole or any part of the contract, or an agreement in writing between 2 or more persons to submit to arbitration any controversy existing between them at the time of the agreement to submit, shall be valid, irrevocable and enforceable except upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\nWis. Stat. \u00a7 788.01. In this Act, the Wisconsin legislature recognizes the freedom of persons to agree to resolve their disputes outside of the state's court system, via arbitration.\n*542\u00b633 A circuit court possesses only limited, statutorily enumerated powers with respect to a private arbitration. See *845Midwest Neurosciences Assocs. v. Great Lakes Neurosurgical Assocs., LLC, 2018 WI 112, \u00b6\u00b6 47-49, 384 Wis. 2d 669, 920 N.W.2d 767. Nothing in the Wisconsin Arbitration Act permits a circuit court to stay or otherwise intermeddle with a private arbitration proceeding. A fundamental canon of statutory construction provides that \"[n]othing is to be added to what the text states or reasonably implies[.]\" Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 93 (2012); see also Dawson v. Town of Jackson, 2011 WI 77, \u00b6 42, 336 Wis. 2d 318, 801 N.W.2d 316 (\"We decline to read into the statute words the legislature did not see fit to write.\"). By specifying particular powers of a circuit court to act with respect to an arbitration proceeding, the legislature has circumscribed the authority of the circuit court, which may not arrogate to itself any additional powers.\n\u00b634 A circuit court's role in arbitration is restricted because parties who contract for arbitration do so to avoid the court system altogether. Borst v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2006 WI 70, \u00b6 61, 291 Wis. 2d 361, 717 N.W.2d 42 (\"[T]he goal of arbitration is 'to resolve the entire controversy out of court without the formality and expense that normally attaches to the judicial process.' \" (quoted source and emphasis omitted)); Midwest Neurosciences Assocs., LLC, 384 Wis. 2d 669, \u00b6 41, 920 N.W.2d 767 (\"When parties agree to arbitration, a court's role is limited because a different forum of dispute resolution has been selected.\").\n\u00b635 Arbitration is a matter of contract between private parties who enjoy that freedom.\n*543McAdams v. Marquette Univ., 2018 WI 88, \u00b6 25, 383 Wis. 2d 358, 914 N.W.2d 708 ; Parsons v. Associated Banc-Corp, 2017 WI 37, \u00b6 31, 374 Wis. 2d 513, 893 N.W.2d 212 (\"Wisconsin courts have long recognized the importance of freedom of contract and have endeavored to protect the right to contract.\" (quoted source omitted)). The circuit court has no authority to halt a contractually agreed upon arbitration. Consistent with Wisconsin's arbitration statute, the circuit court may act only to ensure the parties who contracted for arbitration abide by their contractual agreement. See generally First Weber Grp., Inc. v. Synergy Real EstateGrp., LLC, 2015 WI 34, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 361 Wis. 2d 496, 860 N.W.2d 498 (\"The legislature has determined that the courts have a limited role in the context of arbitration.\"); Midwest Neurosciences Assocs., LLC, 384 Wis. 2d 669, \u00b6 77, 920 N.W.2d 767 (\"Courts should remain mindful of the limited role endowed to them under chapter 788 and not endeavor into the province of the parties' contractual choice to arbitrate.\").\n\u00b636 Nothing in the statutes or the cases authorizes a circuit court to halt a private arbitration so that an insurance company can litigate whether its policy provides coverage to an insured. Although Wisconsin cases do allow insurance companies to bifurcate coverage from liability when both coverage and liability are being decided in the courts, see, e.g., Newhouse by Skow v. Citizens Sec. Mut. Ins. Co., 176 Wis. 2d 824, 836, 501 N.W.2d 1 (1993), no legal authority confers on a circuit court the power to interfere with a liability claim when the parties have contracted to resolve it in arbitration. An insurer may file a declaratory judgment action seeking a coverage determination when the insurer has not been named as a party in a lawsuit *544involving its insured, see, e.g., Fire Ins. Exch. v. Basten, 202 Wis. 2d 74, 78, 549 N.W.2d 690 (1996), but the declaratory judgment statute does not authorize a circuit court to obstruct a scheduled arbitration over the liability claims pending the circuit court's coverage determination.\n\u00b637 Society suggests American Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. American Girl, Inc., 2004 WI 2, 268 Wis. 2d 16, 673 N.W.2d 65 and Delta Group, Inc. v. DBI, Inc., 204 Wis. 2d 515, 555 N.W.2d 162 (Ct. App. 1996), authorize *846a circuit court to stay a private arbitration. We disagree. In American Girl, the circuit court did not order a stay of the arbitration. Rather, the insurer intervened in the arbitration and asked the arbitrator to stay the arbitration until coverage could be determined. 268 Wis. 2d 16, \u00b6 109, 673 N.W.2d 65 (Roggensack, J., dissenting). Society's reliance on American Girl is inapposite. The same is true for its reliance on Delta Group. In that case, the parties filed suit in court and then agreed to stay the court case to allow for mediation and arbitration. Delta Group, 204 Wis. 2d at 519, 555 N.W.2d 162. The court of appeals decided the insurer breached its duty to defend its insured and was therefore obligated to pay the arbitration award. Id., at 525-26, 555 N.W.2d 162. The insurer had denied the claim entirely and never sought a coverage determination. Id. Although Delta Group reiterates general rules about bifurcation and an insurer's duty to resolve coverage disputes, it does not establish a circuit court's authority to stay a private arbitration.\n\u00b638 We conclude the circuit court violated its plain duty when it stepped outside its original jurisdiction under Article VII, \u00a7 8 of the Wisconsin Constitution by issuing an order it had no authority to make. The circuit court compounded its error by stopping an *545arbitration proceeding involving three parties who were not participating in the court case at all and therefore had no opportunity to be heard on an order that affected their rights. Accordingly, the first criterion for a supervisory writ is met.\n\u00b639 The second criterion for granting a supervisory writ requires a showing that CityDeck cannot receive an adequate remedy through the ordinary appeal process. This criterion is also met. Here, the circuit court acted beyond its original jurisdiction under Article VII, \u00a7 8 of the Wisconsin Constitution and halted a private arbitration to decide a separate coverage issue in the circuit court involving different parties. There is no adequate appellate remedy for the circuit court's unlawful act because any \"appeal comes too late for effective redress\" and the damage-stopping the parties from resolving their dispute in arbitration-is not reparable or compensable. See DNR, 380 Wis. 2d 354, \u00b6 41, 909 N.W.2d 114 (quoted source omitted). Challenging the circuit court's exercise of power via a regular appeal would be futile. CityDeck would have to wait until the coverage issue was resolved before it could appeal and ask an appellate court to declare the circuit court had no authority to stay the arbitration. At that point, the wrongful exercise of authority over the arbitration either becomes moot if the circuit court allows the arbitration to proceed during the appeal, or if the circuit court continues the stay pending the appeal, CityDeck continues to be wrongly subjected to the circuit court's exercise of authority it lacks. Either way, a regular appeal is inadequate as it comes \"too late for effective redress.\" Id. (quoted source omitted).\n\u00b640 Significantly, the appeal process continues to subject the parties to the court system for resolving *546their dispute, effectively trampling their agreement to avoid court altogether. Rather than serving as a vehicle for vindicating a party's rights, the appeal exacerbates the injury. The damage is done and cannot be reversed.\n\u00b641 Third, we consider whether grave hardship or irreparable harm will result if we do not issue the supervisory writ. We conclude that it would. A litigant's right to be free from the exercise of the court's power has been completely denied. The circuit court's unlawful stay order halted attempts by these private parties *847to resolve a construction dispute in their contractually-selected forum of arbitration. CityDeck was deprived of the benefits of its bargained-for method of dispute resolution: rather than avoiding the court system, it was subjected to an order issuing from it, and instead of its contractually agreed-upon arbitration progressing, it was indefinitely delayed by a court acting without authority. Additionally, CityDeck was forced into public proceedings in a matter it had contracted to resolve privately. These factors satisfy the grave hardship/irreparable harm criterion.\n\u00b642 Finally, CityDeck met the fourth criterion by acting promptly and speedily. Although Society asserts that the 21 days between the issuance of the unlawful stay order and CityDeck's writ filing is neither prompt nor speedy, we disagree. The circuit court issued the stay order on January 2, 2018. Two days later, on January 4, 2018, CityDeck filed a motion for reconsideration with the circuit court, which the circuit court ignored. On January 11, 2018, the circuit court issued an order giving the parties permission to proceed with a planned mediation. Twelve days after *547that order, CityDeck filed its writ petition in the court of appeals. This timeline satisfies the \"prompt and speedy\" criterion.\n\u00b643 CityDeck's petition fulfills all four criteria for issuance of a supervisory writ; therefore, we grant CityDeck's request and vacate the circuit court's order staying the arbitration.\nBy the Court. -The petition for a supervisory writ is granted; the stay order is vacated.\n\u00b644 REBECCA FRANK DALLET, J., withdrew from participation.\n\nAll subsequent references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2017-18 version unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\nBrown County Circuit Court, Thomas J. Walsh, Judge.\n\n\nThe parties independently initiated the arbitration in this case pursuant to a private contract, without involvement by the court system.\n\n\nIn 1899, the provision read, in relevant part, \"The supreme court shall have a general superintending control over all inferior courts; it shall have power to issue writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, injunction, quo warranto, certiorari, and other original and remedial writs, and to hear and determine the same.\" State ex rel.

Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 (Rules) 809.51 and 809.71 provides:\n809.51 Rule (Supervisory writ and original jurisdiction to issue prerogative writ).\n(1) A person may request the court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction or its original jurisdiction to issue a prerogative writ over a court and the presiding judge, or other person or body, by filing a petition and supporting memorandum. The petition and memorandum combined may not exceed 35 pages if a monospaced font is used or 8,000 words if a proportional serif font is used. The petitioner shall name as respondents the court and judge, or other person or body, and all other parties in the action or proceeding. The petition shall contain:\n(a) A statement of the issues presented by the controversy;\n(b) A statement of the facts necessary to an understanding of the issues;\n(c) The relief sought; and\n(d) The reasons why the court should take jurisdiction.\n(2) The court may deny the petition ex parte or may order the respondents to file a response with a supporting memorandum, if any, and may order oral argument on the merits of the petition. The response and memorandum combined may not exceed 35 pages if a monospaced font is used or 8,000 words if a proportional serif font is used. The respondents shall respond with supporting memorandum within 14 days after service of the order. A respondent may file a letter stating that he or she does not intend to file a response, but the petition is not thereby admitted.\n(3) The court, upon a consideration of the petition, responses, supporting memoranda and argument, may grant or deny the petition or order such additional proceedings as it considers appropriate. Costs and fees may be awarded against any party in a writ proceeding.\n(4) A person filing a petition under this section shall append to the petition a statement identifying whether the petition is produced with a monospaced font or with a proportional serif font. If produced with a proportional serif font, the person shall set forth the word count of the petition.\n809.71 Rule (Supervisory writ). A person may request the supreme court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction over a court and the judge presiding therein or other person or body by filing a petition in accordance with s. 809.51. A person seeking a supervisory writ from the supreme court shall first file a petition for a supervisory writ in the court of appeals under s. 809.51 unless it is impractical to seek the writ in the court of appeals. A petition in the supreme court shall show why it was impractical to seek the writ in the court of appeals or, if a petition had been filed in the court of appeals, the disposition made and reasons given by the court of appeals.\n\n\nArticle VII, \u00a7 5 of the Wisconsin Constitution gives the court of appeals \"supervisory authority\":\n(3) The appeals court shall have such appellate jurisdiction in the district, including jurisdiction to review administrative proceedings, as the legislature may provide by law, but shall have no original jurisdiction other than by prerogative writ. The appeals court may issue all writs necessary in aid of its jurisdiction and shall have supervisory authority over all actions and proceedings in the courts in the district.\n\n\nThe term \"supervisory\" is used in both Wis. Stat. \u00a7 (Rule) 809.51 (court of appeals) and Wis. Stat. \u00a7 (Rule) 809.71 (supreme court), but the Wisconsin Constitution uses the term \"supervisory authority\" with respect to the court of appeals and the term \"superintending authority\" with respect to this court.\n\n\nState ex rel. Beaudry v. Panosian, 35 Wis. 2d 418, 151 N.W.2d 48 (1967), was not the only case to recognize the distinction. State ex rel. Kiekhaefer v. Anderson, 4 Wis. 2d 485, 490, 90 N.W.2d 790 (1958) and State ex rel. Gaynon v. Krueger, 31 Wis. 2d 609, 614, 143 N.W.2d 437 (1966) similarly acknowledge a jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional distinction.\n\n",

(dissenting).\n\u00b645 Until now, it has been well settled that a supervisory writ is intended to be \"an extraordinary and drastic remedy[,]\" reserved for rare situations involving \"some grievous exigency.\" State ex rel. Kalal v. Circuit Ct. for Dane Cty., 2004 WI 58, \u00b6 17, 271 Wis. 2d 633, 681 N.W.2d 110 ; see Matter of Civil Contempt of Kroll, 101 Wis. 2d 296, 304, 304 N.W.2d 175 (Ct. App. 1981) (denominating a supervisory writ an \"extraordinary remed[y]\"); State ex rel. Kenneth S. v. Circuit Ct. for Dane Cty., 2008 WI App 120, \u00b6 8, 313 Wis. 2d 508, 756 N.W.2d 573 (referring to a supervisory writ as an \"extraordinary and drastic remedy that is to be issued only upon some grievous exigency\") (citation omitted).\n\u00b646 Ignoring this admonishment, the majority greatly expands the application of our supervisory writ jurisprudence. Throwing caution to the wind, it elevates jurisdictional errors above all others as deserving of special treatment under Wisconsin's supervisory writ procedures.\n\u00b647 In doing so, the majority pays lip service to the familiar and well-established four-factor test used to determine whether a supervisory writ is an appropriate *548remedy under the circumstances, but fails to apply it correctly. Adopting an argument that CityDeck did not make, the majority's result is that a supervisory writ, which is supposed to be reserved for the most \"extraordinary\" or \"grievous\" situations, may become commonplace.\n\u00b648 In my view, CityDeck has not met a necessary prerequisite for the issuance of a supervisory writ. Mere delay in arbitration proceedings is not the type of \"grave hardship\" or \"irreparable harm\" that entitles a party to such a writ.\n\u00b649 Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n*848I\n\u00b650 Although the majority spills a great deal of ink exploring the history of writ procedures in Wisconsin, it ultimately purports to reaffirm and apply the familiar and well-established four-factor test for determining whether a supervisory writ is an appropriate remedy under the circumstances.\n\u00b651 As the majority correctly explains, \"[a] party seeking the issuance of a supervisory writ must establish four factors: (1) a circuit court had a plain duty and either acted or intends to act in violation of that duty; (2) 'an appeal is an inadequate remedy;' (3) 'grave hardship or irreparable harm will result;' and (4) the party requested relief 'promptly and speedily.' \" Majority op., \u00b630 (citing DNR. v. Wis. Court of Appeals, Dist. IV, 2018 WI 25, \u00b6 9, 380 Wis. 2d 354, 909 N.W.2d 114 ). If any one of these factors is not present, the writ must be denied. Kalal, 271 Wis. 2d 633, \u00b6 17, 681 N.W.2d 110 ; see also State ex rel. Kiekhaefer v. Anderson, 4 Wis. 2d 485, 490, 90 N.W.2d 790 (1958) (explaining that where the \"petition *549fails to allege any facts which disclose that he would suffer great hardship[,]\" a writ of prohibition may not be granted).\n\u00b652 I focus my analysis on the third supervisory writ factor: grave hardship or irreparable harm. The irreparable harm claimed by CityDeck is a simple delay in its arbitration proceedings. In my view, the fact that CityDeck's arbitration is delayed, without more, is insufficient to show grave hardship or irreparable harm.\n\u00b653 The harm caused by any such delay is not similar to the harm suffered by parties that previously sought and obtained supervisory writs. In prior cases, the petitioner would have suffered a complete denial of a right in a way that could not be undone or remedied in the absence of a supervisory writ-that is, the \"bells\" in those cases could not be \"unrung.\"\n\u00b654 For example, courts have determined that the failure to substitute a judge when required by law constitutes irreparable harm. State ex rel. J.H. Findorff &amp; Son, Inc. v. Circuit Ct. for Milwaukee Cty., 2000 WI 30, \u00b6 37, 233 Wis. 2d 428, 608 N.W.2d 679 (2000) ; State ex rel. Laborers Int'l Union of N. Am., AFL-CIO v. Circuit Ct. for Kenosha Cty., 112 Wis. 2d 337, 342, 332 N.W.2d 832 (Ct. App. 1983) ; State ex rel. Oman v. Hunkins, 120 Wis. 2d 86, 91, 352 N.W.2d 220 (Ct. App. 1984). Similarly, the potential disclosure of information subject to the attorney-client privilege is irreparable harm sufficient to support the issuance of a supervisory writ. State ex rel. Godfrey &amp; Kahn, S.C. v. Circuit Ct. for Milwaukee Cty., 2012 WI App 120, \u00b6 52, 344 Wis. 2d 610, 823 N.W.2d 816 (Ct. App. 2012). Finally, in DNR, 380 Wis. 2d 354, \u00b6 47, 909 N.W.2d 114, this court *550determined that the failure to honor an appellant's statutory right to choice of venue constituted irreparable harm.\n\u00b655 Ignoring this case law, CityDeck fails to make any persuasive argument that the delay caused by the circuit court's stay of the arbitration proceedings constitutes grave hardship or irreparable harm. CityDeck's \"argument\" with regard to this factor is tucked away in the very last paragraph of its 28-page brief-in-chief.1\n\u00b656 It baldly asserts that, in the absence of a supervisory writ, it will incur unspecified \"substantial damages for which there is no adequate remedy.\" CityDeck further complains that \"[t]he inability to resolve the arbitration and the indefinite delay resulting from the Stay Order has already caused substantial damage to CityDeck's *849interests and will continue to do so until it is lifted.\"\n\u00b657 In my view, CityDeck is not being denied its right to arbitrate its claims. Arbitration is merely delayed, not denied.2 CityDeck loses no statutory right and it loses no contractual right.\n\u00b658 What about the delay in the arbitration proceedings cannot be remedied with money, such as interest on CityDeck's judgment if it is successful in arbitration? Indeed, at oral argument, CityDeck asserted that \"the irreparable harm is that we continue to lose money that we will not recover because of the *551delay associated with our arbitration proceedings.\" Exactly how will the loss of money from delay result in grave hardship or irreparable harm? CityDeck does not explain, so the majority conjures its own justification.\n\u00b659 Putting on its advocacy hat, the majority sua sponte discovers a new type of irreparable harm. In the majority's broad view, CityDeck suffers irreparable harm by the delay of arbitration proceedings because \"[a] litigant's right to be free from the exercise of the court's power has been completely denied.\" Majority op., \u00b641.\n\u00b660 If this is the thrust of the injury (i.e., being subject to a court's power despite that court's lack of jurisdiction), then the majority has short-circuited Wisconsin's supervisory writ procedure. It treats jurisdictional errors as a special class of errors for which the issuance of a supervisory writ appears to be all but a certainty.3\n\u00b661 Following the majority's logic, would a defendant be entitled to a supervisory writ if a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was erroneously denied? See Richards v. Young, 150 Wis. 2d 549, 557, 441 N.W.2d 742 (1989) (\"This court has previously held that if the statutory requirements for obtaining judicial review are not fully complied with, the subject matter jurisdiction of the circuit court cannot be invoked.\").\n\u00b662 Is a supervisory writ to be employed whenever it is asserted that a circuit court exercised personal jurisdiction despite a fundamental defect in *552service? See Johnson v. Cintas Corp. No. 2, 2012 WI 31, \u00b6 50, 339 Wis. 2d 493, 811 N.W.2d 756. Could a party turn to a supervisory writ to resolve a question of whether a juvenile court could exercise personal jurisdiction? See State v. Aufderhaar, 2005 WI 108, \u00b6 27, 283 Wis. 2d 336, 700 N.W.2d 4.\n\u00b663 It appears that in each of these situations, for the entirety of the case, the circuit court would be \"stepp[ing] outside its original jurisdiction\" and issuing orders \"it ha[s] no authority to make\" that would bind the defendant. See majority op., \u00b638. Further, the ordinary appeals process will be inadequate because an appeal would always \"come[ ] too late\" to effectively redress the error. Id., \u00b639 (quoted source omitted). The harm to the defendant would be considered irreparable because, for the duration of the case, the defendant would be \"completely denied\" the \"right to be free from the exercise of the court's power.\" Id., \u00b641.\n\u00b664 If there is a principle under which the majority's analysis would not apply to all jurisdictional errors, that principle is well hidden. Such an expansion of the availability of supervisory writs is anathema *850to the limitations provided in our supervisory writ jurisprudence. A supervisory writ should be a last resort, not a first option.\n\u00b665 In sum, the majority has placed itself in the role of CityDeck's attorneys, relying on arguments not made in order to issue a writ to which CityDeck is not entitled. In doing so, the majority improperly elevates jurisdictional errors as a special class of errors that can always be redressed via a supervisory writ regardless of the specific facts of any particular case. The majority's reasoning is incompatible with Wisconsin's supervisory writ jurisprudence that has consistently described *553a supervisory writ as an \"extraordinary and drastic remedy\" reserved for only the most \"grievous exigenc[ies].\" Kalal, 271 Wis. 2d 633, \u00b6 17, 681 N.W.2d 110.\n\u00b666 For the reasons set forth, I respectfully dissent.\n\u00b667 I am authorized to state that SHIRLEY S. ABRAHAMSON joins this dissent.\n\nCityDeck did not supplement its argument in its reply brief.\n\n\nThis is an important distinction that is either lost on, or ignored by, the majority. See, e.g., majority op., \u00b639 (characterizing the \"damage\" in the instant case as \"stopping the parties from resolving their dispute in arbitration\") (emphasis added).\n\n\nAlthough the majority expressly rejects the proposition that jurisdictional errors are treated differently under our writ procedure than non-jurisdictional errors, its analysis belies that assertion. See majority op., \u00b627.\n\n",
