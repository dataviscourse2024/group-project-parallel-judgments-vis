After\n\nthorough review, we affirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      The essential facts of this case, which we take from the opinion of the\n\nSupreme Court of Florida affirming Sweet\u2019s conviction and sentence, are these:\n\n      On June 6, 1990, Marcine Cofer was attacked in her apartment and\n      beaten and robbed by three men. She could identify two of the men\n      by their street names. On June 26, 1990, she was taken by Detective\n      Robinson to the police station to look at pictures to attempt to identify\n      the third assailant. When Robinson dropped Cofer off at her\n      apartment, William Sweet was standing nearby and saw her leave the\n      detective. Unknown to Cofer, Sweet had previously implicated\n      himself in the robbery by telling a friend that he had committed the\n      robbery or that he had ordered it done. Cofer asked her next-door\n      neighbor, Mattie Bryant, to allow the neighbor\u2019s daughters, Felicia,\n      thirteen, and Sharon, twelve, to stay with Cofer in her apartment that\n      night. Mattie agreed, and the children went over to Cofer\u2019s apartment\n      around 8 p.m.\n\n             At approximately 1 a.m. that evening, Sharon was watching\n      television in the living room of Cofer\u2019s apartment when she heard a\n      loud kick on the apartment door. She reported this to Cofer, who was\n      sleeping in the bedroom, but because the person had apparently left,\n      Cofer told Sharon not to worry about it and went back to sleep.\n      Shortly thereafter, Sharon saw someone pulling on the living room\n      screen. She awakened Cofer. The two then went to the door of the\n      apartment, looked out the peephole, and saw Sweet standing outside.\n      Sweet called Cofer by name and ordered her to open the door.\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f              At Cofer\u2019s direction, Felicia pounded on the bathroom wall to\n      get Mattie\u2019s attention in the apartment next door, and a few minutes\n      later Mattie came over. The four then lined up at the door, with Cofer\n      standing in the back of the group. When they opened the door to\n      leave, Sweet got his foot in the door and forced his way into the\n      apartment. Sweet\u2019s face was partially covered by a pair of pants. He\n      first shot Cofer and then shot the other three people, killing Felicia.\n      Six shots were fired. Cofer, Mattie, and Sharon were shot in the thigh,\n      ankle and thigh, and buttock, respectively, and Felicia was shot in the\n      hand and in the abdomen.\n\n             Sweet was convicted of first-degree murder, three counts of\n      attempted first-degree murder, and burglary. The jury recommended a\n      sentence of death by a vote of ten to two, and the trial court followed\n      this recommendation.\n\nSweet v. State, 624 So. 2d 1138, 1139 (Fla. 1993) (\u201cSweet I\u201d).\n\n      Sweet\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. Sweet I.\n\nSweet then filed a motion for post-conviction relief in the state trial court. The\n\nmotion was denied, and the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed on January 31,\n\n2002. Sweet v. State, 810 So. 2d 854 (Fla. 2002) (\u201cSweet II\u201d). While the appeal\n\nof his state post-conviction motion was pending, Sweet petitioned the Supreme\n\nCourt of Florida for a writ of habeas corpus. That petition also was denied on June\n\n13, 2002. Sweet v. Moore, 822 So. 2d 1269 (Fla. 2002) (\u201cSweet III\u201d).\n\n      On May 8, 2003, Sweet filed a second motion for post-conviction relief in\n\nthe state trial court, this time raising a claim arising under Ring v. Arizona, 536\n\nU.S. 584 (2002). The trial court denied the motion, concluding that the motion\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fwas \u201cuntimely and facially insufficient. Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851(d)(1);\n\n3.851(e)(1)(E); 3.851(e)(2)(A); 3.851(e)(2)(B) (2000).\u201d Moreover, the state trial\n\ncourt held, even assuming, arguendo, that Sweet\u2019s motion was timely and\n\nsufficient, on the merits the motion had to be denied because the Supreme Court of\n\nFlorida had already rejected this claim in other cases. The Supreme Court of\n\nFlorida summarily affirmed the dismissal of Sweet\u2019s motion for relief. Sweet v.\n\nState, No. SC04-514, 2004 Fla. LEXIS 2451 (Fla. Dec. 20, 2004). The state\u2019s\n\nhighest court released it\u2019s opinion on December 20, 2004, and the mandate issued\n\non April 11, 2005.\n\n      Sweet then filed the instant petition for habeas relief in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the Middle District of Florida on January 18, 2005. The district\n\ncourt concluded that the petition was barred by the one-year statute of limitations\n\nfound in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). Sweet\u2019s one-year period to file a federal habeas\n\npetition had expired on June 14, 2003 and his state Ring motion did not toll that\n\nperiod because it was not properly filed in the state court. We issued a certificate\n\nof appealability to consider the district court\u2019s timeliness ruling, and now review it\n\nde novo. Steed v. Head, 219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                          II.\n\n      The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d),\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\fcodified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), imposes a one-year period of limitation on federal\n\nhabeas petitions filed by state prisoners:\n\n      (d)(1) A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a\n      writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment\n      of a State court. The limitation period shall run from the latest of \u2013\n\n            (A) the date on which the judgment became final by the\n      conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking\n      such review;\n\n            (B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application\n      created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the\n      United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing\n      by such State action;\n\n              (C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was\n      initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly\n      recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to\n      cases on collateral review; or\n\n            (D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or\n      claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of\n      due diligence.\n\n      (2) The time during which a properly filed application for State post-\n      conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent\n      judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period\n      of limitation under this subsection.\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). Sweet\u2019s conviction became final before April 24, 1996, the\n\nday AEDPA became effective. Accordingly, absent any tolling, Sweet had until\n\nApril 23, 1997, to file a federal habeas petition. Siebert v. Campbell, 334 F.3d\n\n1018, 1021 (11th Cir. 2003).\n\n                                             5\n\f      However, Sweet\u2019s one-year federal period was tolled because he had a state\n\napplication for post-conviction relief pending on April 24, 1996. Indeed, the\n\nparties agree, correctly we believe, that Sweet had \u201cproperly filed\u201d applications for\n\npost-conviction relief continuously pending in the Florida courts until June 13,\n\n2002, when the Supreme Court of Florida finally denied his petition for a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus. Thus, Sweet\u2019s one-year period began to run on June 14, 2002, and,\n\nabsent any further tolling, it expired on June 14, 2003.\n\n      Sweet maintains that his one-year federal period was again tolled on May 8,\n\n2003, when, with 37 days remaining on the federal clock, he filed his second\n\nmotion for post-conviction relief, pursuant to Ring, in the state trial court. That\n\nmotion was pending until April 11, 2005, when the Supreme Court of Florida\n\nissued the mandate affirming the trial court\u2019s dismissal. See Nyland v. Moore, 216\n\nF.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir. 2000) (noting that in Florida, a post-conviction motion\n\nis pending until the appellate court issues its mandate). Thus, if Sweet were correct\n\nin arguing that the one-year period was tolled by the state Ring motion, the federal\n\npetition he filed on January 18, 2005, would be timely. But, because we agree with\n\nthe district court that the Ring motion of May 8, 2003, was not \u201cproperly filed,\u201d it\n\ndid not toll the one-year period of limitation, and Sweet\u2019s petition for habeas relief\n\nin the district court was more than 19 months late.\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f      This much is clear: an application for state post-conviction or other collateral\n\nreview tolls the federal period of limitation only if it was \u201cproperly filed.\u201d 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). The statute provides no further definition of the term\n\n\u201cproperly filed,\u201d but the Supreme Court has had several occasions to construe\n\nthose words. First, in Artuz v. Bennett, the Court considered whether a state\n\nhabeas petition was \u201cproperly filed\u201d when the claims it had raised were subject to\n\ntwo independent procedural bars under state law. 531 U.S. 4 (2000). The Court\n\nexplained the meaning of the term \u201cproperly filed\u201d this way:\n\n      An application is \u201cfiled,\u201d as that term is commonly understood, when\n      it is delivered to, and accepted by, the appropriate court officer for\n      placement into the official record. And an application is \u201cproperly\n      filed\u201d when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the\n      applicable laws and rules governing filings. These usually prescribe,\n      for example, the form of the document, the time limits upon its\n      delivery, the court and office in which it must be lodged, and the\n      requisite filing fee.\n\nId. at 8 (citations and footnote omitted). The Court distinguished between two\n\nbasic concepts -- whether an application had been \u201cproperly filed\u201d and whether the\n\nclaims contained in that application were meritorious and free of procedural bar.\n\nId. at 9. The procedural bars at issue in Artuz -- a bar against raising an issue that\n\nhad been previously determined on direct appeal and a bar against raising a claim\n\nthat was available on direct appeal but which was not raised because of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s unjustifiable failure -- were both \u201ccondition[s] to obtaining relief,\u201d as\n\n                                           7\n\fopposed to \u201ccondition[s] to filing.\u201d Id. at 10-11. Thus, the Court concluded that\n\nthe state petition had been properly filed. Id.\n\n       Notably, the Artuz Court was not faced with a timeliness question; its\n\nholding was limited to whether a claim filed in a state petition that was subject to a\n\nprocedural bar made the filing of the entire application improper. Indeed, the\n\nCourt expressed \u201cno view on the question whether the existence of certain\n\nexceptions to a timely filing requirement can prevent a late application from being\n\nconsidered improperly filed.\u201d Id. at 8 n.2.1\n\n       Recently, the Supreme Court squarely addressed the question it left open in\n\nArtuz. In Pace v. DiGuglielmo, the Court held that a state post-conviction petition\n\n\n\n       1\n         The Florida rule that provides the time requirements for post-conviction capital motions\nsays that \u201c[a]ny motion to vacate judgment of conviction and sentence of death shall be filed by\nthe prisoner within 1 year after the judgment and sentence become final.\u201d Fla. R. Crim. P.\n3.851(d)(1). That rule provides exceptions, however:\n\n       (2) No motion shall be filed or considered pursuant to this rule if filed beyond the\n       time limitation provided in subdivision (d)(1) unless it alleges that\n\n              (A) the facts on which the claim is predicated were unknown to the\n       movant or the movant\u2019s attorney and could not have been ascertained by the\n       exercise of due diligence, or\n\n               (B) the fundamental constitutional right asserted was not established\n       within the period provided for in subdivision (d)(1) and has been held to apply\n       retroactively, or\n\n               (C) postconviction counsel, through neglect, failed to file the motion.\n\nFla. R. Crim. P. 3.851(d)(2).\n\n                                                8\n\frejected by the state court as being untimely under state law is not \u201cproperly filed\u201d\n\nwithin the meaning of AEDPA\u2019s \u00a7 2244(d)(2). 544 U.S. 408 (2005). The Court\n\nexplained:\n\n      In Artuz v. Bennett, we held that time limits on postconviction\n      petitions are \u201ccondition[s] to filing,\u201d such that an untimely petition\n      would not be deemed \u201cproperly filed.\u201d However, we reserved the\n      question we face here: \u201cwhether the existence of certain exceptions to\n      a timely filing requirement can prevent a late application from being\n      considered improperly filed.\u201d Having now considered the question,\n      we see no grounds for treating the two differently.\n\n      As in Artuz, we are guided by the \u201ccommon usage\u201d and \u201ccommo[n]\n      underst[anding]\u201d of the phrase \u201cproperly filed.\u201d In common\n      understanding, a petition filed after a time limit, and which does not\n      fit within any exceptions to that limit, is no more \u201cproperly filed\u201d than\n      a petition filed after a time limit that permits no exception. The\n      purpose of AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations confirms this\n      commonsense reading. On petitioner\u2019s theory, a state prisoner could\n      toll the statute of limitations at will simply by filing untimely state\n      postconviction petitions. This would turn \u00a7 2244(d)(2) into a de facto\n      extension mechanism, quite contrary to the purpose of AEDPA, and\n      open the door to abusive delay.\n\nId. at 413 (alterations in original) (citations omitted). Quite simply, the Supreme\n\nCourt said that \u201c[w]hen a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, that\n\nis the end of the matter for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2),\u201d because, \u201ctime limits, no\n\nmatter their form, are \u2018filing\u2019 conditions.\u201d Id. at 414, 417 (internal quotation marks\n\nand alterations omitted) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court held that\n\n\u201c[b]ecause the state court rejected petitioner\u2019s [post-conviction] petition as\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\funtimely, it was not \u2018properly filed\u2019 and he is not entitled to statutory tolling under\n\n\u00a7 2244(d)(2).\u201d Id. at 417. Thus, under Artuz and Pace, if the Ring petition Sweet\n\nfiled in state court was not timely under state law, then it would not be \u201cproperly\n\nfiled\u201d under AEDPA and his federal habeas petition would be untimely.\n\n      The state trial court\u2019s ruling was unambiguous; it held that the Ring motion\n\nwas untimely. Moreover, the court found that even if it considered the motion to\n\nbe timely, it would still fail on the merits, because the Supreme Court of Florida\n\nhad previously concluded that the state\u2019s capital sentencing scheme did not violate\n\nRing. The Supreme Court of Florida summarily affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling.\n\nSweet argues, however, that because the Supreme Court of Florida has consistently\n\nruled on the merits of untimely Ring petitions, we should construe its summary\n\nruling in this case as having affirmed only the merits portion of the trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision. We are unpersuaded.\n\n      The Supreme Court has provided clear guidance on how to construe a\n\nsummary, or unexplained state court decision. In Ylst v. Nunnemaker, the Court\n\nheld that when a state appellate court affirms a lower court\u2019s ruling without\n\narticulating its reasons for doing so, we should apply \u201cthe following presumption:\n\nWhere there has been one reasoned state judgment rejecting a federal claim, later\n\nunexplained orders upholding that judgment or rejecting the same claim rest upon\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\fthe same ground.\u201d 501 U.S. 797, 803 (1991). The Court explained that in the\n\ncontext of a summary affirmance, \u201csilence implies consent\u201d; appellate courts\n\ngenerally \u201caffirm[] without further discussion when they agree, not when they\n\ndisagree, with the reasons given below.\u201d Id. at 804. In short, \u201c[t]he essence of\n\nunexplained orders is that they say nothing. We think that a presumption which\n\ngives them no effect -- which simply \u2018looks through\u2019 them to the last reasoned\n\ndecision -- most nearly reflects the role they are ordinarily intended to play.\u201d Id.;\n\nsee also Glock v. Singletary, 65 F.3d 878, 882 n.4 (11th Cir. 1995) (en banc)\n\n(holding that \u201c[w]hen the last state court to consider the claim summarily denies\n\nrelief, we look to the last state court to address the claim to determine\u201d if it\n\nconsidered the claim procedurally defaulted); Harmon v. Barton, 894 F.2d 1268,\n\n1273 (11th Cir. 1990) (noting that the \u201cclear inference\u201d to be drawn from a per\n\ncuriam affirmance without written opinion is that the appellate court \u201caccepted not\n\nonly the judgment but the reasoning of the trial court\u201d). The Supreme Court made\n\nclear, however, that the presumption is rebuttable; \u201cstrong evidence can refute it.\u201d\n\nYlst, 501 U.S. at 804.\n\n      The Supreme Court of Florida summarily affirmed the denial of Sweet\u2019s\n\nRing motion. Thus, in the absence of any explanation, we \u201clook through\u201d the\n\nopinion to the last reasoned decision, which in this case came from the state trial\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fcourt. That court denied the claim because it was untimely, and, in the alternative,\n\nalso failed on the merits too. In the absence of \u201cstrong evidence\u201d to rebut the\n\nnormal presumption that silence implies consent, we presume the Supreme Court\n\nof Florida\u2019s ruling to have rested on the same grounds. Sweet has offered us no\n\nreason, let alone a strong one, for why we should disregard the normal\n\npresumption. Thus, since the last reasoned opinion from the state concluded that\n\nunder state law, the Ring motion was untimely, it was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d under \u00a7\n\n2244(d), and it could not toll the federal one-year period of limitation.\n\n       Sweet offers three reasons, nevertheless, for why the Ring petition filed in\n\nstate court should toll the time for filing his federal habeas petition. First, he says\n\nthat the state court denied his Ring petition both for timeliness reasons and on the\n\nmerits; thus, it was \u201cproperly filed.\u201d Second, he contends that any contrary ruling\n\nwould deprive him of both the equal protection and due process of the law because,\n\nhe maintains, the Supreme Court of Florida has regularly denied other, untimely\n\nRing petitions on the merits. Finally, he suggests, the state waived the right to\n\nraise the timeliness issue in the first place, by not raising it as an affirmative\n\ndefense in its first responsive pleading in the district court. Again, we are\n\nunconvinced.\n\n       First, Sweet concedes, as he must, that the state trial court denied his Ring\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\fmotion because it was untimely. He says we should not rely on the timeliness\n\nruling, but rather consider only the trial court\u2019s alternative holding that the motion\n\nwould have otherwise failed on the merits. This argument is squarely foreclosed\n\nby Supreme Court case law.\n\n      In Carey v. Saffold, the Court considered a postconviction, state habeas\n\nmotion that had been denied by the California Supreme Court in a one-sentence\n\nopinion \u201con the merits and for lack of diligence.\u201d 536 U.S. 214, 217-18 (2002).\n\nThe Court held that when a state court determines that a motion is untimely, \u201cthat\n\n[is] the end of the matter, regardless of whether it also addressed the merits of the\n\nclaim, or whether its timeliness ruling was \u2018entangled\u2019 with the merits.\u201d Id. at 226.\n\nIn other words, when a state court determines that a petition is untimely, and also\n\nrejects the substantive claim on the merits, the timeliness decision standing alone\n\ncompels a federal court to conclude that the state motion was not \u201cproperly filed.\u201d\n\nId; see also Pace, 544 U.S. at 414 (\u201cWhat we intimated in Saffold we now hold:\n\nWhen a postconviction petition is untimely under state law, that is the end of the\n\nmatter for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\u201d (internal quotation marks and alteration\n\nomitted)); Brooks v. Walls, 301 F.3d 839, 841 (7th Cir. 2002) (\u201cSaffold tells us\n\nthat both aspects of a dual-ground decision (substance and procedure) must be\n\nrespected, so that an untimely petition is not \u2018properly filed\u2019 even if the court\n\n\n\n                                           13\n\faddresses the merits -- whether or not the \u2018timeliness ruling was \u2018entangled\u2019 with\n\nthe merits.\u2019\u201d); Satterfield v. Johnson, 434 F.3d 185, 192 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing\n\nSaffold for the proposition that \u201c[i]f a state court determines that a petition is\n\nuntimely, that would be the end of the matter, regardless of whether it also\n\naddressed the merits of the claim, or whether its timeliness ruling was \u2018entangled\u2019\n\nwith the merits\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Bonner v. Carey, 425 F.3d\n\n1145, 1148-49 (9th Cir. 2005) (finding it irrelevant that the state court had ruled on\n\nthe merits of the petition because that court had also determined that the petition\n\nwas untimely).\n\n      In Saffold the Supreme Court offered at least three reasons to explain why a\n\nstate court also may reach the merits of a claim, after having determined that the\n\npetition was untimely. First, the merits determination may be easy to make.\n\nMoreover, a trial court may simply want to provide a reviewing court with\n\nalternative grounds for a decision. Finally, a court may wish to explain to a\n\nprisoner (who may not have had an attorney) that it was not merely a procedural\n\ntechnicality that precluded him from obtaining relief. Saffold, 536 U.S. at 225-26.\n\nEach of those rationales could readily apply in this case. In short, when a state\n\ncourt unambiguously rules that a post-conviction petition is untimely under state\n\nlaw, we must respect that ruling and conclude that the petition was not \u201cproperly\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\ffiled\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2), regardless of whether the state court also\n\nreached the merits of one of the claims.\n\n       Next, Sweet claims that because the Supreme Court of Florida has routinely\n\ndenied otherwise untimely Ring petitions solely on the merits, that court deprived\n\nhim of the equal protection and due process of the law by denying his petition on\n\nthe basis of the time bar contained in Florida Rule 3.851.2\n\n       To establish an equal protection claim, a prisoner must demonstrate that (1)\n\nhe is similarly situated to other prisoners who received more favorable treatment;\n\nand (2) the state engaged in invidious discrimination against him based on race,\n\nreligion, national origin, or some other constitutionally protected basis. Jones v.\n\nRay, 279 F.3d 944, 946-47 (11th Cir. 2001); Damiano v. Florida Parole and Prob.\n\nComm\u2019n, 785 F.2d 929, 932-33 (11th Cir. 1986). Sweet\u2019s equal protection claim\n\nnecessarily fails first because he has not shown that he was treated differently from\n\nother, similarly situated prisoners. Sweet cites seven cases from the Supreme\n\nCourt of Florida where, he contends, that court issued merits rulings on Ring\n\n\n       2\n         Neither argument is presented with great clarity. However, Sweet presents absolutely no\nargument or citation of authority in support of his due process claim. Thus, we decline to\naddress it. See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, 881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n.6 (11th Cir. 1989)\n(holding that issues not argued on appeal are deemed waived, and that a passing reference to an\nissue in a brief was insufficient to properly raise that issue). Moreover, the state argues that\nSweet failed to raise an equal protection claim before the district court and that we should refuse\nto consider it on appeal as well. See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., 385 F.3d\n1324, 1331 (11th Cir. 2004). But, Sweet raised the equal protection claim, albeit briefly, in his\nmotion for a new trial filed with the district court.\n\n                                                15\n\fclaims.3 Those opinions are not helpful, however, because not one of them\n\nexplicitly addressed a prisoner similarly situated to Sweet, that is, a person who\n\nattempted to file a Ring petition that also was otherwise barred by the one-year\n\nprohibition in Florida Rule 3.851. Absent some indicia that Florida Rule 3.851 has\n\nbeen applied arbitrarily, we are left with nothing more than a general rule that\n\napplies equally to every person. That alone will not support a claimed violation of\n\nthe equal protection clause. See, e.g., New York City Transit Auth. v. Beazer, 440\n\nU.S. 568, 587 (1979) (\u201cThe [Equal Protection] Clause announces a fundamental\n\nprinciple: the State must govern impartially. General rules that apply\n\nevenhandedly to all persons within the jurisdiction unquestionably comply with\n\nthis principle.\u201d).\n\n       More basically, Sweet\u2019s equal protection claim fails because he has not\n\nalleged, let alone established that he was treated differently on account of some\n\nform of invidious discrimination tied to a constitutionally protected interest. He\n\nhas not even claimed that he was treated differently from others because of race,\n\nreligion, or national origin. See Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 8 (1944) (\u201cThe\n\nunlawful administration . . . of a state statute fair on its face, resulting in its unequal\n\n\n       3\n        Sweet cites Johnson v. State, No. SC05-701 (Fla. March 17, 2006); Washington v. State,\n907 So. 2d 512 (Fla. 2005); Johnson v. State, 904 So. 2d 400 (Fla. 2005); Shere v. State, 903 So.\n2d 936 (Fla. 2005); Asay v. State, 892 So. 2d 1011 (Fla. 2004); Correll v. State, 880 So. 2d 1210\n(Fla. 2004); and Ponticelli v. State, 879 So. 2d 623 (Fla. 2004).\n\n                                               16\n\fapplication to those who are entitled to be treated alike, is not a denial of equal\n\nprotection unless there is shown to be present in it an element of intentional or\n\npurposeful discrimination.\u201d); McQueary v. Blodgett, 924 F.2d 829, 835 (9th Cir.\n\n1991) (rejecting a claim that a state prisoner\u2019s equal protection rights were violated\n\nbecause he received a longer sentence than some other prisoners and holding that\n\n\u201ca mere demonstration of inequality is not enough; the Constitution does not\n\nrequire identical treatment. There must be an allegation of invidiousness or\n\nillegitimacy in the statutory scheme before a cognizable claim arises: it is a settled\n\nrule that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equal laws, not equal results.\u201d\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Cruz v. Skelton, 543 F.2d 86, 92-93\n\n(5th Cir. 1976) (affirming dismissal of prisoner\u2019s equal protection claim because\n\nthere was no allegation of \u201c\u2018invidious discrimination\u2019 based on such considerations\n\nas race, religion, national origin, or poverty\u201d). Simply put, Sweet has not\n\nestablished that he was treated differently from similarly situated prisoners or that\n\nhe was treated differently on account of invidious discrimination. The Supreme\n\nCourt of Florida did not deny Sweet of the equal protection of the law by\n\nsummarily affirming the denial of an untimely Ring petition.\n\n      Finally, Sweet says that the state failed to preserve its timeliness argument\n\nbecause it failed to raise the issue in the first responsive pleading filed in federal\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\fcourt. The district court expressly rejected this claim. We review the court\u2019s\n\ndecision only for an abuse of discretion. See Day v. McDonough, 126 S. Ct. 1675,\n\n1679 (2006); Amoco Oil Co. v. Gomez, 379 F.3d 1266, 1276 (11th Cir. 2004). On\n\nthis record, no abuse of discretion is evident.\n\n      The procedural history is clear enough. Sweet filed his federal habeas\n\npetition, and the district court ordered the state to respond. In the initial response,\n\nthe state did not claim the petition was untimely under \u00a7 2244(d). Instead, the state\n\nraised timeliness in a motion for summary judgment, which it filed some 36 days\n\nafter its first response. The state observed that the Supreme Court had just\n\n(approximately 17 days earlier) decided Pace, where the Court held that a state\n\npetition rejected as untimely under state law, could not be \u201cproperly filed\u201d for the\n\npurposes of \u00a7 2244. The district court rejected Sweet\u2019s argument that the state had\n\nwaived the timeliness issue, relying on our decision in Day v. Crosby, 391 F.3d\n\n1192 (11th Cir. 2004), which the Supreme Court recently affirmed. Day v.\n\nMcDonough, 126 S. Ct. 1675 (2006).\n\n      In Day, the state filed its answer in a habeas case and affirmatively conceded\n\nthat the federal petition was timely filed. A magistrate judge reviewed the\n\npleadings and determined that the state had made a calculation error. The court\n\nsaid that the petitioner had waited 388 days before filing his federal petition,\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\fthereby making it untimely. The magistrate judge ordered the parties to show\n\ncause why the case should not be dismissed, and, after the petitioner had an\n\nopportunity to respond, the district court dismissed the case. We affirmed. Day,\n\n391 F.3d at 1193-95.\n\n      The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine \u201cwhether a federal court\n\nlacks authority, on its own initiative, to dismiss a habeas petition as untimely, once\n\nthe State has answered the petition without contesting its timeliness.\u201d Day, 126 S.\n\nCt. at 1679. The Supreme Court framed its holding in these terms:\n\n      Ordinarily in civil litigation, a statutory time limitation is forfeited if\n      not raised in a defendant\u2019s answer or in an amendment thereto. Fed.\n      Rules Civ. Proc. 8(c), 12(b), and 15(a). And we would count it an\n      abuse of discretion to override a State\u2019s deliberate waiver of a\n      limitations defense. In this case, however, the federal court\n      confronted no intelligent waiver on the State\u2019s part, only an evident\n      miscalculation of the elapsed time under a statute designed to impose\n      a tight time constraint on federal habeas petitioners. In the\n      circumstances here presented, we hold, the federal court had\n      discretion to correct the State\u2019s error and, accordingly, to dismiss the\n      petition as untimely under AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitation.\n\nId. at 1679-80 (footnote omitted). The Court concluded that the \u201cdistrict courts are\n\npermitted, but not obligated, to consider, sua sponte, the timeliness of a state\n\nprisoner\u2019s habeas petition.\u201d Id. at 1684. That holding is consistent with our prior\n\ncase law. See Jackson v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., 292 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir.\n\n2002) (holding that a district court has the discretion to raise a \u00a7 2254 timeliness\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\fconsideration sua sponte).\n\n       Sweet argues that Day and Jackson are somehow distinguishable because\n\nhere the district court did not raise the issue sua sponte, but, rather, entertained and\n\ngranted the motion by the state only at the summary judgment stage. But if the\n\ndistrict court had the authority to raise the issue of timeliness entirely on its own, it\n\nseems clear to us that it also had the authority to do so at the urging of one of the\n\nparties.\n\n       This conclusion is supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in Day.\n\nThere, the Court squarely adopted a flexible and intermediate rule regarding\n\nwaiver, allowing courts to exercise discretion in each case to decide whether the\n\nadministration of justice is better served by dismissing a case on statute of\n\nlimitation grounds or by reaching the merits of the petition. Id. It noted that, under\n\nthe facts of Day, the magistrate judge, instead of acting sua sponte, could have\n\ninformed the state of its obvious computation error and entertained an amendment\n\nto the state\u2019s answer. Id. Plainly, such an amendment would have been permitted\n\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) and by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243, which\n\nallows the state to amend an answer in a habeas proceeding by leave of court. Day,\n\n126 S. Ct. at 1683. The Court concluded the district court acted well within its\n\ndiscretion in raising the timeliness issue sua sponte because it could have achieved\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\fthe same result simply by suggesting and then permitting an amendment to the\n\nanswer. \u201cRecognizing that an amendment to the State\u2019s answer might have\n\nobviated this controversy, we see no dispositive difference between that route, and\n\nthe one taken here.\u201d Id. (footnote omitted).\n\n      Here, the state raised the timeliness defense only 36 days after it had filed a\n\nresponse to the show cause order. It did so in a motion for summary judgment.\n\nHowever, it could have done so just as easily by seeking leave to amend its\n\nresponse to the district court\u2019s show cause order. The district judge then,\n\nundeniably, would have had the authority to grant the motion to amend, and the\n\nissue would have been properly preserved for a motion to dismiss or on summary\n\njudgment. If anything, the alternative procedure employed in this case is less\n\nattenuated than the one approved in Day (where the Court noted that the district\n\ncourt could have alerted the state to the error, suggested an amended answer, and\n\nthen granted the motion to amend) because, here, the state itself raised the issue by\n\nfiling the motion for summary judgment. Essentially, the state neglected one step\n\nin the process: it should have filed a motion to amend its earlier pleading before\n\nfiling its motion for summary judgment. But, under the flexible approach endorsed\n\nby the Supreme Court, that error did not prevent the state from raising timeliness.\n\nThis conclusion is bolstered because the state had an altogether sound reason for\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fnot raising the issue in its first pleading. When it filed its response to the show\n\ncause order, the Supreme Court had not yet issued its opinion in Pace, which\n\nestablished that an untimely state petition is not \u201cproperly filed.\u201d4 The district\n\ncourt did not abuse its considerable discretion by allowing the state to raise the\n\naffirmative defense of timeliness in a motion for summary judgment.\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       Sweet\u2019s Ring petition was not timely filed in state court and, therefore,\n\nunder \u00a7 2244(d), it was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d and could not toll the time for filing\n\nhis federal habeas petition. The petition was untimely; accordingly, we affirm.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         Moreover, our cases interpreting Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c), which is\napplicable here, see Mayle v. Felix, 545 U.S. 644, 125 S. Ct. 2562, 2569 (2005) (noting that\nunder the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases In The United States District Courts, the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure apply in habeas cases to the extent that they are not inconsistent with\nany statutory provisions or the habeas rules); Long v. Wilson, 393 F.3d 390, 397 (3d Cir. 2004)\n(analyzing Rule 8(c) case law in a habeas action), support a liberal approach to waiver where the\nfailure to raise an affirmative defense has not prejudiced the plaintiff. See Grant v. Preferred\nResearch, Inc., 885 F.2d 795, 797 (11th Cir. 1989); Hassan v. U.S. Postal Serv., 842 F.2d 260,\n263 (11th Cir. 1988). And it is settled that a plaintiff is not prejudiced by a defendant\u2019s failure to\ncomply with Rule 8(c) if the plaintiff is provided notice of the affirmative defense by some other\nmeans. Grant, 885 F.2d at 797. Here, the state raised the affirmative defense in its summary\njudgment motion only 36 days after its first pleading, and Sweet was given every opportunity to\nrespond. Indeed, he does not allege that he was prejudiced in any way by the delay.\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f",
