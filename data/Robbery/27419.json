Waldron, on August\n               10, 2020. The court accepts the respondent\u2019s voluntary surren-\n               der of her license and enters a judgment of disbarment.\n                                   STATEMENT OF FACTS\n                  The respondent was admitted to the practice of law in the\n               State of Nebraska on September 12, 1984. On August 10,\n               2020, the respondent filed a voluntary surrender of her license\n               to practice law, in which she stated that on July 31, 2018,\n               she was charged in the county court for Fillmore County,\n               Nebraska, with a Class IIA felony count of theft by unlaw-\n               ful taking in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-511 (Reissue\n               2016). See Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-518(1) (Reissue 2016). The\n               respondent ultimately was convicted and sentenced by the\n               district court to a 5-year term of probation and ordered to pay\n               restitution of $56,913.

Ct. R. \u00a7 3-315 of the disciplinary rules provides in\npertinent part:\n         (A) Once a Grievance, a Complaint, or a Formal\n      Charge has been filed, suggested, or indicated against a\n      member, the member may voluntarily surrender his or her\n      license.\n         (1) The voluntary surrender of license shall state in\n      writing that the member knowingly admits or knowingly\n      does not challenge or contest the truth of the suggested\n      or indicated Grievance, Complaint, or Formal Charge and\n      waives all proceedings against him or her in connection\n      therewith.\nPursuant to \u00a7 3-315 of the disciplinary rules, we find that the\nrespondent has voluntarily surrendered her license to practice\nlaw and, for purposes of her license to practice law, knowingly\ndoes not challenge or contest the fact of her conviction refer-\nenced above. Further, the respondent has waived all proceed-\nings against her in connection with the disciplinary proceeding.\nWe further find that the respondent has consented to the entry\nof an order of disbarment.\n                        CONCLUSION\n   Upon due consideration, the court accepts the respondent\u2019s\nvoluntary surrender of her license to practice law, finds that\nthe respondent should be disbarred, and hereby orders her\ndisbarred from the practice of law in the State of Nebraska,\neffective immediately. The respondent shall forthwith comply\nwith all terms of Neb. Ct. R. \u00a7 3-316 (rev. 2014) of the disci-\nplinary rules, and upon failure to do so, she shall be subject\nto punishment for contempt of this court. Accordingly, the\nrespondent is directed to pay costs and expenses in accordance\n\f                            - 345 -\n         Nebraska Supreme Court Advance Sheets\n                  307 Nebraska Reports\n          STATE EX REL.
