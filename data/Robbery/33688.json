In any event, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks constituted fair comment upon the evidence or were responsive to arguments raised by the defense in summation and did not exceed the bounds of permissible rhetorical comment (see, People v Galloway, 54 NY2d 396; People v Guthrie, 157 AD2d 668; People v Estrella, 156 AD2d 710; People v Brown, 158 AD2d 461; People v Vaughn, 136 AD2d 752).\nThe defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are either unpreserved for appellate review or without merit. Bracken, J. P., Sullivan, Harwood and Lawrence, JJ., concur.\n",
