HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge:\n      Louisiana state prisoner Larry Thomas, Jr. appeals the dismissal of his\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely.      For the reasons that follow, we\nAFFIRM.\n                 FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n      Thomas was convicted of armed robbery by a jury in 2006 and sentenced\nto fifty years imprisonment. On direct appeal, the Louisiana Second Circuit\nCourt of Appeal affirmed his conviction on August 15, 2007. State v. Thomas,\n42,322, p. 10 (La. App. 2 Cir. 8/15/07); 962 So. 2d 1119, 1126. Pursuant to\nLouisiana Supreme Court Rule X, \u00a7 5(a), Thomas had thirty days to file a direct\nreview writ application with the Louisiana Supreme Court. Thomas alleges\n\f     Case: 13-31082       Document: 00513045447         Page: 2    Date Filed: 05/15/2015\n\n\n\n                                      No. 13-31082\nthat he filed an application on August 30, 2007, within the time for doing so.\nHowever, on November 20, 2007, the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s Central Staff\nsent Thomas a form letter informing him that his \u201cpapers\u201d were being returned\nto him \u201cunfiled.\u201d 1 The letter stated: \u201cWe cannot evaluate your complaints\nunless you furnish us with the required documentation . . . .\u201d By the date of\nthat letter, the thirty-day window for filing a direct review writ application had\nexpired.\n       On January 8, 2008, Thomas sent documents to the Louisiana Supreme\nCourt, which were received, filed, and docketed by the court on February 12,\n2008. 2 On October 24, 2008, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied Thomas\u2019s\nwrit application in a one-word denial. State ex rel. Thomas v. State, 2008-0316\n(La. 10/24/08); 992 So. 2d 1031, 1032. Thomas subsequently applied for state\npost-conviction relief, which was unsuccessful. 3 Thomas then filed a \u00a7 2254\napplication in the United States District Court, which was postmarked August\n16, 2012. The magistrate judge recommended that Thomas\u2019s application be\ndismissed as time-barred, and the district court agreed. The district court\nnoted that the timeliness determination hinged on \u201cwhether Thomas\u2019s writ\n\n\n\n       1  As the magistrate judge noted, she initially ordered Thomas to provide a dated copy\nof his Louisiana Supreme Court writ application. The only evidence that Thomas produced\nin response to this request was a document indicating that he filed a writ application on\nJanuary 8, 2008. After the magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation\nrecommending dismissal of Thomas\u2019s petition, Thomas, for the first time, produced the writ\napplication dated August 30, 2007. Only later, in response to the magistrate judge\u2019s request\nthat Thomas explain why his August 30, 2007 writ application was not postmarked and\nreceived by the Louisiana Supreme Court until January 2008, did Thomas produce the letter\nfrom Central Staff.\n        2 It is not entirely clear what documents Thomas sent on January 8, 2008. However,\n\na letter from the Louisiana Supreme Court dated February 19, 2008, acknowledged receipt\nof his \u201cfiling,\u201d which \u201cwas metered on 1/8/2008.\u201d\n        3 In total, his post-conviction process spanned about thirty-eight months. Thomas\n\ninitially filed for post-conviction relief on May 29, 2009, and the Louisiana Supreme Court\ndenied his post-conviction writ application on July 27, 2012. State ex rel. Thomas v. State,\n2011-2758 (La. 7/27/12); 93 So. 3d 599.\n                                             2\n\f    Case: 13-31082      Document: 00513045447        Page: 3    Date Filed: 05/15/2015\n\n\n\n                                    No. 13-31082\napplication dated August 30, 2007, and purportedly mailed on September 4,\n2007, was a timely petition for direct review under [Louisiana] Supreme Court\nRule X despite being returned unfiled.\u201d The district court emphasized that as\nof November 20, 2007, when Central Staff sent Thomas the letter, \u201cThomas did\nnot have a properly filed pleading being considered by the Louisiana Supreme\nCourt.\u201d The district court determined that Thomas\u2019s conviction became final\non the last day that Thomas could have timely petitioned the Louisiana\nSupreme Court for further direct review and that the one-year limitations\nperiod, under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), expired one year later. 4 The district court also\ndetermined that Thomas had not demonstrated that he was entitled to\nequitable tolling.\n      Thomas filed a timely notice of appeal and moved for a certificate of\nappealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), which the district court denied. Thomas argued, and\nstill argues, that his August 2007 writ application, which was returned as\nunfiled, should be considered a timely-filed writ application, and, thus, his\nconviction did not become final until after the Louisiana Supreme Court denied\nthat application. Thomas also argues that the Central Staff letter should be\nconstrued as having given him an extension of time to file his direct review\nwrit application. This court subsequently granted Thomas a COA \u201con the issue\nwhether the district court erred in determining the date upon which the one-\nyear limitations period commenced under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).\u201d The court also\ninstructed the parties to \u201cinclude an analysis of whether the Louisiana\nSupreme Court\u2019s ruling was a ruling on the merits and an implicit grant of\nleave to file an out-of-time appeal.\u201d\n\n\n\n      4  The district court calculated these dates to be September 15, 2007 and September\n15, 2008. However, thirty days after the Louisiana Second Circuit affirmed Thomas\u2019s\nconviction would have actually been September 14, 2007. This one-day discrepancy does not\naffect our analysis.\n                                           3\n\f    Case: 13-31082     Document: 00513045447      Page: 4   Date Filed: 05/15/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 13-31082\n                                 DISCUSSION\n      \u201cThis court reviews a district court decision denying a habeas petition on\nprocedural grounds de novo.\u201d Butler v. Cain, 533 F.3d 314, 316 (5th Cir. 2008).\nThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) establishes \u201c[a]\n1-year period of limitation\u201d for state prisoners to file for federal habeas relief,\nwhich \u201crun[s] from the latest\u201d of four specified dates. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1).\nThe first of those dates is relevant to this case: \u201cthe date on which the judgment\nbecame final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for\nseeking such review[.]\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). When, as in the present case, a\npetitioner does not pursue direct review all the way to the United States\nSupreme Court, \u201cthe judgment becomes final at the \u2018expiration of the time for\nseeking such review\u2019\u2014when the time for pursuing direct review in [the U.S.\nSupreme Court], or in state court, expires.\u201d Gonzalez v. Thaler, 132 S. Ct. 641,\n653-54 (2012). This court has previously explained that \u201cAEDPA, not state\nlaw, determines when a judgment is final for federal habeas purposes.\u201d Causey\nv. Cain, 450 F.3d 601, 606 (5th Cir. 2006) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted). However, we look to state law to determine how long a\nprisoner had to file a direct appeal, which is a necessary part of the finality\ninquiry. Butler, 533 F.3d at 317.\n      Louisiana Supreme Court Rule X, \u00a7 5(a) provides that \u201c[a]n application\nseeking to review a judgment of the court of appeal . . . shall be made within\nthirty days of the mailing of the notice of the original judgment of the court of\nappeal.\u201d The Rule also states that \u201c[n]o extension of time therefor will be\ngranted.\u201d La. Sup. Ct. R. X, \u00a7 5(a). In Butler v. Cain, this court discussed Rule\nX, \u00a7 5(a) in the context of analyzing when a petitioner\u2019s Louisiana state\nconviction became final under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). 533 F.3d at 316. In Butler, the\npetitioner filed a direct review writ application with the Louisiana Supreme\nCourt, which he conceded was untimely. Id. at 319 n.2. About five months\n                                        4\n\f     Case: 13-31082      Document: 00513045447        Page: 5     Date Filed: 05/15/2015\n\n\n\n                                     No. 13-31082\nlater, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied his application with a one-word\ndenial. Id. at 316, 318. This court found that \u201cButler\u2019s time for seeking further\nreview of his state conviction expired when he did not within thirty days of the\nLouisiana Court of Appeal\u2019s June 24, 1998 decision, challenge that decision in\nthe state Supreme Court\u201d and that July 24, 1998 was the date that his\nconviction became final for the purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Id. at 317. The\npetitioner argued that because the Louisiana Supreme Court had discretion to\nconsider his late writ application and because, he claimed, the Court\u2019s denial\nof his application was on the merits, the time for seeking direct review did not\nexpire until after the Louisiana Supreme Court denied his writ. Id. at 318.\nThis court disagreed and refused to construe the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s\none-word denial as a decision on the merits. Id. at 318, 319 n.2. This court\nfound no indication that the petitioner requested an extension of time or that\nthe Louisiana Supreme Court granted one and emphasized that if the\nLouisiana Supreme Court had considered the petitioner\u2019s application on the\nmerits, it would have done so in violation of its own explicit rule prohibiting\nextensions of the thirty-day deadline. Id. at 319.\n      In the present case, Thomas is in the same position as the petitioner in\nButler. Although Thomas allegedly sent something to the Louisiana Supreme\nCourt within the thirty-day deadline, what he sent was deficient and could not\nbe evaluated by the court. We will not construe Thomas\u2019s filing as a timely\nwrit application when the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s Central Staff explicitly\nrefused to do the same. Further, the Central Staff\u2019s form letter provides no\nindication that the Louisiana Supreme Court granted Thomas leave to file an\nout-of-time direct review writ application. 5 Cf. Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555\n\n\n      5  In Wilson v. Cain, this court determined that a defendant\u2019s Louisiana state\nconviction became final, under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), when the Louisiana Supreme Court denied\nhis request for rehearing, even though a Louisiana Supreme Court rule explicitly prohibited\n                                            5\n\f     Case: 13-31082        Document: 00513045447           Page: 6     Date Filed: 05/15/2015\n\n\n\n                                        No. 13-31082\nU.S. 113, 121 (2009) (\u201c[W]here a state court grants a criminal defendant the\nright to file an out-of-time direct appeal during state collateral review, but\nbefore the defendant has first sought federal habeas relief, his judgment is not\nyet \u2018final\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).\u201d). Instead, the generic letter simply\nnotified him that his papers were being returned \u201cunfiled.\u201d As the district\ncourt correctly explained, \u201cas of November 20, 2007, Thomas did not have a\nproperly filed pleading being considered by the Louisiana Supreme Court.\u201d\nWhen Thomas mailed his writ application to the Louisiana Supreme Court on\nJanuary 8, 2008, his writ application was nearly four months late, and we are\nbound by Butler to hold that Thomas\u2019s conviction became final when the thirty-\nday time limit for seeking review by the Louisiana Supreme Court expired. 6\n\n\nconsideration of such requests. 564 F.3d 702, 705, 707 (5th Cir. 2009). The court emphasized\nthat \u201cLouisiana courts do not invariably apply Louisiana Supreme Court Rule IX, \u00a7 6 to\nprocedurally bar motions for rehearing\u201d and cited several cases in which the Louisiana\nSupreme Court granted rehearing motions despite the rule prohibiting their consideration.\nId. at 705. Significantly, unlike the petitioner in Wilson, Thomas has offered no evidence or\ncase citations indicating that when faced with timely but incomplete writ applications, the\nLouisiana Supreme Court declines to apply Louisiana Supreme Court Rule X, \u00a7 5(a), and\ninstead grants leave to file out-of-time writ applications. There is also no evidence in the\npresent record, and no language in the Central Staff form letter, indicating the Louisiana\nSupreme Court did so here. Cf. Wilson, 564 F.3d at 705 (emphasizing that one of the justices\nvoted to grant the request for rehearing, despite the rule against consideration of such\nrequests).\n        6 The Louisiana Supreme Court sometimes converts untimely writ applications into\n\napplications for post-conviction relief. See State v. Robinson, 2004-1081, p.1 (La. 11/15/04);\n888 So. 2d 767, 767-68 (Calogero, C.J., concurring) (\u201cAlthough the application is untimely as\na matter of La. S.Ct. Rule X, \u00a7 5(a), and the court of appeal\u2019s decision is therefore final on\ndirect review, this court has the authority to review the merits of a defendant\u2019s constitutional\nclaims because Louisiana law governing collateral attack on a final conviction provides a\nnarrow exception to the finality of claims fully litigated on direct appeal.\u201d (citation omitted));\nState ex rel. Hall v. State, 99-0326 (La. 9/24/99); 871 So. 2d 1071, 1071 n.1 (per curiam)\n(\u201cRather than requiring relator to present the same arguments again to the lower courts by\npost-conviction application, this court\u2019s use of the Jacobs procedure in effect treated the\napplication as one for post-conviction relief, which the lower court presumably would have\ndenied because they had rejected the same arguments on direct review.\u201d). It is not clear\nwhether this was done in the present case. If the Louisiana Supreme Court did consider\nThomas\u2019s writ application as an application for post-conviction relief, its nearly eight-month\nconsideration of Thomas\u2019s application would not affect the date upon which Thomas\u2019s\nconviction became final\u2014his conviction was still final when the thirty-day time limit for\n                                                6\n\f     Case: 13-31082        Document: 00513045447           Page: 7     Date Filed: 05/15/2015\n\n\n\n                                        No. 13-31082\n                                      CONCLUSION\n       The district court was correct in its determination of the date upon which\nthe one-year limitations period commenced under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Thomas\u2019s\nconviction became final thirty days after the Louisiana Second Circuit affirmed\nhis conviction on direct appeal. On that date, Thomas\u2019s time for seeking direct\nreview by the Louisiana Supreme Court expired and the \u00a7 2244(d)(1)\nlimitations period began to run. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s\ndismissal of Thomas\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application.\n\n\n\n\nseeking direct review expired. See Butler, 533 F.3d at 320; see also Hall, 871 So. 2d at 1071\n(explaining that when the Louisiana Supreme Court converts and reviews an untimely writ\napplication as a post-conviction application it is \u201cnot as a step in direct review\u201d). However,\nthe court\u2019s consideration of his application, if deemed a \u201cproperly filed\u201d post-conviction\napplication under \u00a7 2244(d)(2), would toll his \u00a7 2244(d)(1) limitation period. See \u00a7 2244(d)(2)\n(\u201cThe time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other\ncollateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be\ncounted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.\u201d). Because neither party has\nsuggested that Thomas\u2019s writ application should be considered a properly filed post-\nconviction application for \u00a7 2244(d)(2)\u2019s tolling purposes, and because the COA was not\ngranted on that issue, we decline to resolve this question. See United States v. Scruggs, 691\nF.3d 660, 666 (5th Cir. 2012) (\u201cWe do not consider claims raised for the first time on appeal\nor issues not included in a COA.\u201d); Hughes v. Johnson, 191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir. 1999)\n(\u201cIssues not raised in the brief filed in support of [petitioner\u2019s] COA application are waived.\u201d).\n                                                7\n\f",
