We affirm.\n\n      Joseph Torres (\u201cTorres\u201d) was fatally shot on July 15, 2015, in the City\n\nof Chester, Delaware County, Pennsylvania.        Appellant was arrested and\n\ncharged with the death of Torres on October 10, 2015.        During a police\n\ninterview on that day, Appellant confessed to killing Torres. Appellant sought\n\nsuppression of his confession by filing an omnibus pretrial motion on\n\nMarch 28, 2016. Following a hearing, the trial court denied the motion. Order,\n\n6/8/16.\n\n      Appellant proceeded to a four-day nonjury trial in October of 2016. The\n\ntrial court found Appellant guilty of first degree murder, robbery, and\n\n\n____________________________________\n* Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\npossession of an instrument of crime (\u201cPIC\u201d).1 Verdict Slip, 10/14/16. On\n\nFebruary 3, 2017, the trial court sentenced Appellant to: incarceration for life\n\nwithout the possibility of parole on the murder conviction; a consecutive\n\nsentence of incarceration for seventy-two months to 144 months on the\n\nrobbery conviction; and a concurrent sentence of six months to twelve months\n\non the PIC conviction. Appellant filed post-sentence motions on February 13,\n\n2017, which the trial court denied.            Order, 6/9/17.   This timely appeal\n\nfollowed. Appellant and the trial court complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.\n\n       On appeal, Appellant presents the following questions for review:\n\n       1. Whether the Appellant\u2019s confession was obtained in violation of\n       his right to due process of law and against self incrimination,\n       guaranteed the Appellant by the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and\n       Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and\n       Article 1 Sections 8 and 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, where,\n       under the totality of the circumstances, the confession was\n       involuntary in that it was not the product of Appellant\u2019s free will\n       and unconstrained choice, but, instead, was the result of\n       manipulative, coercive and overreaching interrogation by police.\n\n       2. Whether the trial court committed legal error and abuse of its\n       discretion in admitting into evidence testimony of a deputy district\n       attorney regarding the agreement between the Commonwealth\n       and a cooperating co-defendant, who testified in exchange for\n       reduced charges.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 4.2\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1   18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2502, 3701, and 907, respectively.\n\n2  In his Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement, Appellant raised two suppression\nissues, one concerning his confession and one concerning a DNA sample.\nPa.R.A.P. 1925(b) Statement, 7/31/17, at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2. However, Appellant has\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\n       Appellant first argues that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\ndenying the motion to suppress because Appellant\u2019s confession was not \u201cthe\n\nproduct of Appellant\u2019s free will but, instead, [was] obtained as a result of\n\ncoercion and overreaching by police.\u201d            Appellant\u2019s Brief at 19.   Appellant\n\n\u201ccontends that the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that his\n\nconfession was not given voluntarily.\u201d           Id. at 23.   Appellant highlights his\n\nconfinement in the holding area and the police detective\u2019s failure to provide a\n\nwritten Miranda3 form before the interview, misuse of a recording device,\n\nfalsification of evidence, coercion, and psychological manipulation. Id. at 23\u2013\n\n27.\n\n             Our standard of review in addressing a challenge to a trial\n       court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion is limited to determining\n       whether the factual findings are supported by the record and\n       whether the legal conclusions drawn from those facts are correct.\n\n             We may consider only the evidence of the prosecution and\n       so much of the evidence for the defense as remains\n       uncontradicted when read in the context of the record as a whole.\n       Where the record supports the findings of the suppression court,\n       we are bound by those facts and may reverse only if the court\n       erred in reaching its legal conclusions based upon the facts.\n\n             Moreover, it is within the lower court\u2019s province to pass on\n       the credibility of witnesses and determine the weight to be given\n       to their testimony.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\nnot presented the DNA issue in his appellate brief; therefore, we consider that\nissue abandoned and will not address it. Pa.R.A.P. 2116(a).\n\n3   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\n           Furthermore, our Supreme Court . . . clarified that the scope\n     of review of orders granting or denying motions to suppress is\n     limited to the evidence presented at the suppression hearing.\n\nCommonwealth v. Williams, 176 A.3d 298, 315\u2013316 (Pa. Super. 2017)\n\n(internal formatting, quotation marks, and citations omitted).\n\n     Regarding the voluntariness of a confession, we have stated:\n\n     \u201cIt is well-established that when a defendant alleges that his\n     confession was involuntary, the inquiry becomes not whether the\n     defendant would have confessed without interrogation, but\n     whether the interrogation was so manipulative or coercive that it\n     deprived the defendant of his ability to make a free and\n     unconstrained decision to confess.\u201d          Commonwealth v.\n     Yandamuri, \u2013\u2013\u2013 Pa. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, 159 A.3d 503, 525 (2017) (internal\n     citations omitted). Voluntariness is the touchstone inquiry when\n     deciding a motion to suppress a confession, and voluntariness is\n     determined upon review of the totality of the circumstances.\n     Commonwealth v. Nester, 551 Pa. 157, 709 A.2d 879, 882\n     (1998). In assessing the totality of the circumstances, the\n     suppression court should consider: \u201cthe duration and means of the\n     interrogation; the defendant\u2019s physical and psychological state;\n     the conditions attendant to the detention; the attitude exhibited\n     by the police during the interrogation; and all other factors that\n     could drain a person\u2019s ability to resist suggestion and coercion.\u201d\n     Yandamuri, 159 A.3d at 525.\n\nCommonwealth v. Fitzpatrick, ___ A.3d ___, 2018 Pa. Super. 55, at *5 (Pa.\n\nSuper. filed March 14, 2018). Additional relevant factors include:\n\n     the accused\u2019s age and level of education and experience; his\n     extent of previous experience with the police; whether the\n     accused was advised of his constitutional rights; whether he was\n     injured, ill, drugged, or intoxicated when he confessed; whether\n     he was deprived of food, sleep or medical attention, and whether\n     he was abused or threatened with abuse.\n\nYandamuri, 159 A.3d at 525 (citation omitted).             Furthermore, the\n\nPennsylvania Supreme Court has found that the use of artifice or intentional\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\nmisrepresentations to obtain a confession is insufficient to make an otherwise\n\nvoluntary confession inadmissible \u201cwhere the deception does not produce an\n\nuntrustworthy    confession    or   offend    basic   notions    of   fairness.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Williams, 640 A.2d 1251, 1259 (Pa. 1994).\n\n     In an effort to facilitate effective appellate review of Appellant\u2019s\n\nsuppression issue, the trial court provided the following findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law:\n\n                              Findings of Fact\n\n     1.   Detective Adam Sendek, currently of the Delaware County\n          Criminal Investigation Division (hereinafter \u201cCID\u201d), has been\n          with CID for 16 years. Prior to his position within the Homicide\n          Squad of CID, Detective Sendek was a police officer with the\n          Chester Police Department for 30 years and 3 months. N.T.,\n          5/6/16, p. 15. Detective Sendek has advised suspects of their\n          Miranda warnings many times5 over the course of his career.\n          Id. at 15.\n\n                  5  Detective Sendek approximated that he has\n                  administered Miranda warnings \u201ca thousand\n                  plus\u201d times. N.T., 5/6/17, p. 15.\n\n     2.   Detective Sendek was assigned to investigate the shooting of\n          Joseph Torres on July 27, 2015 in the City of Chester along\n          with Patrick Mullen from the City of Chester Police\n          Department. Id. at 15-16.\n\n     3.   On October 10, 2015, after he learned that the Appellant had\n          been arrested, Detective Sendek went to the Chester Police\n          Station. Id. at 16. He arrived at approximately 8:30 P.M. Id.\n\n     4.   When he arrived, the Appellant was in the holding cell area of\n          the police station, which is located on the ground floor of the\n          police station. Id. at 17. The Appellant was sitting on a bench.\n          Id. at 17.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\n     5.   Detective Sendek approached the Appellant and took him\n          from the cell block to an interview room on the third floor of\n          the police station. Id. at 17. The Appellant was handcuffed.\n          Id. [at 18.]\n\n     6.   Corporal Carey of the Chester Police Department\n          accompanied Detective Sendek and was present during the\n          interview of the Appellant.\n\n     7.   When they reached the room, Detective Sendek removed the\n          handcuffs from the Appellant\u2019s hands and explained that he\n          was under arrest for the murder of Joseph Torres. Id. at 18.\n\n     8.   Detective Sendek then read the complaint and affidavit of\n          probable cause to the Appellant. Id. at 18.\n\n     9.   Detective Sendek turned on a digital recorder and read the\n          Miranda warnings to the Appellant from a printed card. Id. at\n          19-20. See also Commonwealth Exhibit CS-1. Specifically,\n          Detective Sendek advised the Appellant that he had the right\n          to remain silent, that anything he told him could be used\n          against him in court, that he had the right to have an attorney\n          present during questioning, and that if he could not afford an\n          attorney that one would be provided for him free of charge.\n          Id. at 24.\n\n     10. After he had given the warnings, Detective Sendek told the\n         Appellant about the evidence that the police had obtained\n         during their investigation and advised the Appellant that the\n         police had obtained a video surveillance from the crime scene\n         and found his fingerprints in the victim\u2019s pickup truck. Id. at\n         21-22.\n\n     11. The Appellant told Detective Sendek that his fingerprints were\n         likely in the victim\u2019s car because he had been in the truck the\n         week prior, when he had helped him purchase pills in Chester.\n         Id. at 22.\n\n     12. Detective Sendek also advised the Appellant that his co-\n         defendant, Ronald Myers, had made a statement to police\n         implicating the Appellant in the crime. Id.\n\n     13. The Appellant told Detective Sendek that he was at home at\n         the time of the shooting and that he had an alibi. Id. at 22.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\n     14. It was at this point of the interview, after speaking to the\n         Appellant for about 10 minutes, that Detective Sendek\n         realized that the audio recorder was not turned on. Id. at 22-\n         23, 62. He noticed the \u201cred\u201d record[ing] light on the tape\n         recorder was not illuminated. He then turned the recorder\n         \u201con\u201d and continued the interview. He reiterated some of the\n         conversation that he had just had with the Appellant. He did\n         not re-read the Miranda warnings at this time. He explained\n         to the court that he restated the following: \u201cI thought we were\n         recording earlier, but apparently we had a mistake. You were\n         given your Miranda warnings, correct? Yes. And after giving\n         you your warnings to have an attorney present before and\n         after questioning, you decided to talk to us? Yes. And I read\n         the complaint to you - against you charging you with murder?\n         Yes.\u201d Id. at 27.\n\n     15. Detective Sendek then began speaking to the Appellant\n         again. This recorded interview lasted approximately 25\n         minutes. Id. at 30, 63. During this interview, the Appellant\n         confessed to his involvement in the homicide.\n\n     16. The Appellant did not ask to have an attorney present and did\n         not attempt to terminate the interview. Id. at 35.\n\n     17. After the interview, Detective Sendek went over his Miranda\n         rights again, using a form this time that was provided to him\n         by Corporal Carey. Id. at 30, 32, 35-36; see also\n         Commonwealth Exhibit CS-3. Detective Sendek explained\n         that the Appellant initialed the seven questions contained on\n         the form and signed it in three places. Id. at 32. The Appellant\n         then asked Detective Sendek to turn on the recorder again\n         and he made a second statement. This interview lasted\n         approximately 2 minutes. Id. at 63.\n\n     18. At the conclusion of the interview, Detective Sendek thanked\n         the Appellant and walked him down to the cell block. Id. at\n         34.\n\n                        Conclusions of Law\n\n     1.   When deciding a motion to suppress a confession, the\n          touchstone inquiry is whether the confession was voluntary.\n          Commonwealth v. Nester, 551 Pa. 157, 164, 709 A.2d 879,\n          882 (1998) (citing Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 111\n\n                                    -7-\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\n          S.Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1991); Culombe v. Connecticut,\n          367 U.S. 568, 81 S. Ct. 1860, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1037 (1961)).\n          Voluntariness is determined from the totality of the\n          circumstances surrounding the confession. Id. (citing\n          Fulminante; Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 93\n          S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973); Commonwealth v. Jones,\n          546 Pa. 161, 683 A.2d 1181 (1996)).\n\n     2.   To be admissible, a confession must be voluntary.\n          Commonwealth v. DiStefano, 782 A.2d 574, 581 (Pa. Super.\n          2001).\n\n     3.   In determining voluntariness, the court should look at \u201cthe\n          duration and means of the interrogation; the physical and\n          psychological state of the accused; the conditions attendant\n          to the detention; the attitude of the interrogator; and any and\n          all other factors that could drain a person\u2019s ability to\n          withstand suggestion and coercion.\u201d Nester, 551 Pa. at 164.\n\n     4.   It is the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove by a\n          preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\u2019s\n          confession was voluntarily made. Id.\n\n     5.   The suppression court, which hears and evaluates the\n          testimony, must determine whether the Commonwealth has\n          established by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n          confession was voluntary. Commonwealth v. Kichline, 468 Pa.\n          265, 280, 361 A.2d 282, 290 (1976).\n\n     6.   In the case sub judice, the Appellant was not subjected to a\n          lengthy interrogation. He was given his Miranda warnings\n          prior to the commencement of the interview with Detective\n          Sendek and he made it clear that he understood and was\n          waiving his rights.\n\n     7.   The Appellant was not physically coerced and was not made\n          any false promises by the police. The record reflects that his\n          decision to give a statement was the product of his free will\n          and unconstrained choice.\n\n     8.   The Commonwealth proved by a preponderance of the\n          evidence that the Appellant\u2019s confession was voluntary.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, 11/8/17, at 6\u20139.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\n      Our review of the suppression testimony confirms that the trial court\u2019s\n\nfactual findings are supported by the record and its legal conclusions drawn\n\nfrom those facts are correct. Williams, 176 A.3d at 315\u2013316. According to\n\nDetective Sendek, Appellant did not appear to have and did not complain of\n\nany physical problems while in police custody. N.T., 5/6/16, at 18, 35. During\n\nthe interview process, Appellant was not handcuffed, although he was in leg\n\nirons. Id. The interview room was approximately twenty feet by eight feet;\n\nit had one window, a table and three or four chairs.     Id. at 40\u201341. Only\n\nDetective Sendek and Corporal Carey were present in the room, and only\n\nCorporal Cary was in uniform. Id. at 17, 35, 38.\n\n      Detective Sendek began the interview by informing Appellant why he\n\nwas being questioned, and he read to Appellant the criminal complaint and\n\naffidavit of probable cause. N.T., 5/6/16, at 18\u201319. Detective Sendek then\n\nstated to Appellant, \u201c[I]n order for me to talk to you, I have to give you your\n\nrights, your [Miranda] warnings.\u201d Id. at 20, 42. Although Detective Sendek\n\nusually employs a Miranda waiver form, he chose to use a digital recorder\n\nand read the Miranda warnings to Appellant from the \u201clittle blue card that\n\n[he] would have in [his] wallet.\u201d Id. at 19\u201320, 23\u201325, 42-43, Exhibit CS-1\n\n(blue card).   Appellant agreed to speak with the detective.       Id. at 24.\n\nDetective Sendek did not conduct any questioning before turning on the\n\nrecorder. Id. at 20.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\n      Within ten minutes of interviewing Appellant, Detective Sendek noticed\n\nthat the recorder was not operating.    N.T., 3/6/16, at 21\u201322, 62\u201363.      He\n\napologized to Appellant and went \u201c[b]ack on the record[.]\u201d         Id. at 23.\n\nAlthough Detective Sendek did not restate the Miranda warnings in their\n\nentirety once the recorder was operating, Appellant confirmed on the record\n\nthat they had been given to him, that he agreed to talk with the detective,\n\nand that he knew the interview was being recorded. Id. at 26\u201327, Exhibits\n\nCS-2 (tape of digital recording) and CS-2A (transcript of recorded interview).\n\nThe recorded interview lasted approximately twenty-five minutes. Id. at 30.\n\nAt the conclusion of the recorded interview, Appellant initialed and signed a\n\nwritten Miranda warning waiver form that Corporal Carey provided. Id. at\n\n30, 32\u201335, 50\u201351, 62, Exhibit CS-3. Appellant then asked Detective Sendek\n\nto go back on the record, and the detective complied.       Id. at 30\u201332, 60,\n\nExhibits CS-2 and CS-2B (transcript of second recorded interview).         The\n\nsecond recorded interview lasted approximately two minutes. Id. at 34.\n\n      Detective Sendek conceded that he confronted Appellant about the\n\nfalsity of his statements and told Appellant that the police had a witness and\n\nvideo evidence which, in fact, they did not have. He also played on Appellant\u2019s\n\nrelationship with his mother, suggesting that she would suffer emotional and\n\nfinancial harm as a result of his bad decision. Id. at 54\u201359.\n\n      Viewing the totality of the circumstances, we discern no basis for\n\nAppellant\u2019s claim that the police interrogation was so manipulative or coercive\n\n\n                                    - 10 -\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\nthat it deprived Appellant of his ability to make a free and unconstrained\n\ndecision to confess. Fitzpatrick, ___ A.3d at ___, 2018 Pa. Super. 55, at *5.\n\n\u201c[T]he trial court had the opportunity to observe Appellant\u2019s demeanor\n\nextensively during the suppression hearing to assess whether his personality\n\nis one likely to be overborne.\u201d Yandamuri, 159 A.3d at 526. The entire\n\ninterview process lasted fewer than thirty minutes.     At no time during the\n\ninterviewing did Appellant refuse to speak with Detective Sendek or Corporal\n\nCarey.   He did not ask for an attorney or attempt to end the recorded\n\ninterviews.   During the interviewing, Appellant was not harmed, injured,\n\ndrugged, or intoxicated; he was not denied food, water, or sleep. Appellant\n\nindicated that he understood his Miranda rights when read to him by\n\nDetective Sendek; he voluntarily signed the Miranda waiver form; and he\n\ninitiated the second recorded interview.     Nothing in Appellant\u2019s confession\n\nsuggests that he was under compulsion to confess or that he was physically\n\nor mentally compromised. Finally, Detective Sendek\u2019s tactics did not amount\n\nto manipulative or coercive conduct that deprived Appellant of his ability to\n\ndecide to confess voluntarily.    See Nester, 709 A.2d at 884 (\u201cNot all\n\npsychological persuasion is prohibited. Encouraging a suspect to cooperate\n\nwith the investigation and answer questions honestly is a permissible\n\ninterrogation tactic.\u201d).   Accordingly, we conclude Appellant has failed to\n\nestablish that his confession was involuntary and should have been\n\nsuppressed.\n\n\n                                    - 11 -\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\n      Next, Appellant contends that the trial court erred by admitting the\n\ntestimony of Deputy District Attorney Stephanie Wills (\u201cWills\u201d) regarding an\n\nagreement between the Commonwealth and a cooperating co-defendant,\n\nRonald Myers (\u201cMyers\u201d), who testified in exchange for reduced charges.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 27. Appellant argues that \u201cevidence of the agreement was\n\nutilized to improperly bolster the credibility of Ronald Myers.\u201d Id. According\n\nto Appellant, because \u201c[a]n express requirement of the Agreement is that\n\nMyers testify truthfully\u201d and Wills testified that Appellant \u201chad done nothing\n\nto cause the Commonwealth to void the agreement,\u201d \u201cthe prosecutor\n\npersonally assured the trial court of the veracity of the witness.\u201d Id. at 27,\n\n28, 29.\n\n      Evidence is relevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or\n\nless probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of\n\nconsequence in determining the action.       Pa.R.E. 401.   The trial court may\n\nexclude relevant evidence if its probative value is outweighed by a danger of\n\none or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues,\n\nmisleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting\n\ncumulative evidence. Pa.R.E. 403. Evidence will not be prohibited merely\n\nbecause it is harmful to the defendant. Commonwealth v. Kouma, 53 A .3d\n\n760, 770 (Pa. Super. 2012). Exclusion is limited to evidence so prejudicial\n\nthat it would inflame the jury to make a decision based upon something other\n\nthan the legal propositions relevant to the case. Id. The trial court is not\n\n\n                                    - 12 -\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\nrequired to sanitize the trial to eliminate all unpleasant facts from the jury\u2019s\n\nconsideration where those facts are relevant to the issues at hand and form\n\npart of the history and natural development of the events and offenses for\n\nwhich the defendant is charged. Commonwealth v. Page, 965 A.2d 1212,\n\n1220 (Pa. Super. 2008).\n\n      Furthermore, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has stated, \u201cImproper\n\nbolstering or vouching for a government witness occurs where the prosecutor\n\nassures the jury that the witness is credible, and such assurance is based on\n\neither the prosecutor\u2019s personal knowledge or other information not contained\n\nin the record.\u201d Commonwealth v. Smith, 995 A.2d 1143, 1157 (Pa. 2010).\n\nHowever, reference to a plea agreement that requires truthfulness does not\n\nconstitute improper vouching. Commonwealth v. Miller, 819 A.2d 504, 515\n\n(Pa. 2002).\n\n      The trial court disposed of this issue as follows:\n\n             In his final issue on appeal, [Appellant] asserts that the\n      court erred in permitting Deputy District Attorney Stephanie\n      [Wills] to bolster Myers\u2019 credibility during trial. The court\n      respectfully submits that Appellant is not entitled to any relief on\n      this claim.\n\n            It is well established that the trial court\u2019s decision to admit\n      evidence is subject to review for an abuse of discretion.\n      Commonwealth v. Dengler, 586 Pa. 54, 890 A.2d 372, 379 (2005).\n      \u201cAn abuse of discretion may not be found merely because an\n      appellate court might have reached a different conclusion, but\n      requires a result of manifest unreasonableness, or partiality,\n      prejudice, bias, or ill-will, or such lack of support so as to be clearly\n      erroneous.\u201d Commonwealth v. Dillon, 592 Pa. 351, 925 A.2d 131,\n      136 (2007); Grady v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 576 Pa. 546, 839 A.2d 1038,\n      1046 (2003).\n\n                                       - 13 -\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\n             At trial, Attorney Wills testified regarding the plea\n      agreement that was reached between her office and the\n      Appellant\u2019s co-conspirator Ronald Myers. She explained that she\n      met with Myers and his attorney and they signed an agreement\n      on November 9, 2015. N.T., 10/5/16, pp. 190-[1]92. Pursuant\n      to the plea agreement, Myers agreed to plead guilty to third\n      degree murder, robbery, and criminal conspiracy to deliver a\n      controlled substance. Id. at 191. In return, the charge of first\n      degree murder was withdrawn and the Commonwealth agreed\n      \u201cthat it will not make [sic] a position at sentencing . . . that\n      [Myers] would enter the plea, and at the time of sentencing, the\n      representative for the Commonwealth would only hand up the\n      guidelines.\u201d Id. at 192. She explained that Myers sentencing was\n      deferred until after the conclusion of the Appellant\u2019s trial and that\n      her office would inform the sentencing judge that Myers had\n      testified for the Commonwealth. Id. at 193.\n\n             The court submits that this testimony was relevant to show\n      any motivation that Myers may have had for testifying at trial and\n      implicating the Appellant in the homicide of Torres. Attorney Wills\n      explained to the court that while the Appellant was promised that\n      the Commonwealth would inform the sentencing court that he\n      cooperated at trial by testifying as a Commonwealth witness, he\n      was not necessarily promised any leniency or given any other\n      assurances by their office. This court submits that it did not abuse\n      its discretion in admitting this evidence.\n\nTrial Court Opinion, 11/8/17, at 11\u201312.\n\n      Upon review of the certified record, we discern no abuse of the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s discretion in admitting Wills\u2019 testimony.    We recall that this was a\n\nnonjury trial; therefore, the trial court sat as the fact finder.             See\n\nCommonwealth v. Myers, 722 A.2d 649, 651\u2013652 (Pa. 1998) (citing\n\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, DoTv. O'Connell, 555 A.2d 873 (Pa.\n\n1989) (\u201cAs long as sufficient evidence exists in the record which is adequate\n\nto support the finding found by the trial court, as factfinder, we are precluded\n\nfrom overturning that finding and must affirm, thereby paying the proper\n\n                                     - 14 -\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\ndeference due to the factfinder who heard the witnesses testify and was in the\n\nsole position to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and assess their\n\ncredibility.\u201d)).\n\n       Here, Myers informed the trial court that, pursuant to the open plea\n\nagreement, he was required to testify on behalf of the Commonwealth. N.T.,\n\n10/4/16, at 161; Exhibit C-65 (Myers\u2019 plea agreement).4 He then implicated\n\nAppellant in the murder of Torres. Id. at 164\u2013205. In turn, Wills did not offer\n\nher personal opinion about Myers\u2019 veracity; she indicated only that Myers was\n\nrequired to cooperate.       N.T., 10/5/16, at 185\u2013188.    In fact, the following\n\nexcerpt reveals that Wills avoided any suggestion that Myers testified\n\ntruthfully:\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: And does that agreement generally set out what\n       is expected of Mr. Myers in relation to his cooperation in this\n       prosecution against his Co-Defendant?\n\n       A      Yes.\n\n       Q   And has Ronald Myers done anything to cause the\n       Commonwealth to void its agreement with Mr. Myers?\n\n                                          * * *\n\n       [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.\n\n       THE COURT:       I\u2019ll allow it. Your objection\u2019s overruled subject to\n       what we talked about sidebar. The [c]ourt knows your concern.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n4  We note that Commonwealth Exhibit C-65, Myers\u2019 plea agreement, is not\nincluded in the certified record. Therefore, we restrict our analysis of this\nissue to a consideration of Wills\u2019 testimony.\n\n                                          - 15 -\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\n      [WITNESS]:        The agreement specifically lays out that it\u2019s up\n      to\u2014it\u2019s the Commonwealth\u2019s prerogative to make a determination\n      if there\u2019s been any deviation from the agreement that Mr. Myers\n      entered into, and there\u2019s been nothing that he has done differently\n      than what\u2019s been expected of him outlined in this agreement.\n\nN.T., 10/5/16, at 193.        Even on cross-examination, Wills offered no\n\nassessment of Myers\u2019 credibility; she explained that he was to cooperate,\n\nwhich he did:\n\n      [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right. But if he doesn\u2019t testify against\n      [Appellant], second-degree murder\u2019s not getting withdrawn, is it?\n\n      A     The agreement lays out his continued cooperation in this\n      case, and obviously that was part of -- as he\u2019s been called as a\n      witness in this case, so he did testify in this case.\n\n      Q     So the answer is yes, part of the agreement, part of his\n      obligation in order to get second-degree murder withdrawn was\n      that he testify against [Appellant]. Is that right?\n\n      A     The agreement lays out that he continues to cooperate in\n      exchange for those three charges and the second-degree murder\n      being withdrawn. It doesn\u2019t outline in there that he will be called\n      as a witness. It outlines that he\u2019ll be continued [sic] cooperating,\n      and \u2013-\n\n      Q     If he refuses to testify, the deal\u2019s off, isn\u2019t it?\n\n      A     That would be not cooperating.\n\nId. at 194\u2013195.\n\n      We conclude that Wills did not bolster Myers\u2019 testimony by assuring the\n\nfact finder that Myers was credible based on her personal knowledge or\n\nevidence not contained in the record. Smith, 995 A.2d at 1157. Rather, she\n\ninformed the trial court that Myers was required to cooperate and that he did.\n\nNor did Wills\u2019 testimony invade the fact finder\u2019s credibility determining\n\n                                       - 16 -\n\fJ-S23011-18\n\n\nfunction. The trial court still had to determine whether the evidence presented\n\nat trial was reliable, including Myers\u2019 testimony implicating Appellant and Wills\u2019\n\ntestimony about the plea agreement.        Appellant\u2019s contrary claim does not\n\nwarrant relief.\n\n      Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
