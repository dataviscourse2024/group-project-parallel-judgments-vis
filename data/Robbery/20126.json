In two points, appellant argues that\r\nthe trial court erred by (1) denying his constitutional motion to suppress\r\nevidence obtained under an invalid search warrant and (2) refusing to instruct\r\nthe jury with a Abenefit of\r\nthe doubt@ charge\r\nconcerning lesser included offenses.\u00a0 We\r\naffirm.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground Facts\r\n\r\nOn October 7, 2004, Janice\r\nWilliams and several others were at the home of Donald Ellis (known as Hoppy)\r\non Elgin Street in Tarrant County.\u00a0 Hoppy=s home was known as a smoke house, a place where people brought their\r\nown crack cocaine and smoked it.\u00a0 In the\r\nearly morning hours, appellant, with two of his friends, broke into Hoppy=s house and demanded powdered cocaine (known as raw).\u00a0 Janice and Hoppy told appellant that they did\r\nnot have any raw because Hoppy=s place was a smoke house, but Hoppy told appellant that Roney Gibson,\r\nwho lived down the street on Bethune, did sell drugs.\u00a0 Appellant then demanded that everyone empty\r\ntheir pockets.\u00a0 As Hoppy tried to empty\r\nhis shirt pocket, appellant hit him in the head with a gun, pointed the barrel\r\nat Hoppy=s forehead, and pulled the trigger.\u00a0\r\nThe gun did not discharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant then forced Janice\r\nto go with him and his friends to Roney=s house.\u00a0 With a gun to Janice=s back, appellant approached Roney=s house. Janice knocked on the door and identified herself to Roney,\r\nwho opened the door and let Janice, appellant, and appellant=s friends in the house.\u00a0 Janice\r\ntold Roney appellant wanted some drugs, but before a drug transaction occurred,\r\ngunfire erupted.\u00a0 Appellant tried to take\r\nRoney=s drugs, and the two began fighting.\u00a0\r\nRoney boxed appellant into a corner, and appellant called for help from\r\nhis friend.\u00a0 Janice testified that\r\nappellant screamed, AShoot\r\nhim.\u00a0.\u00a0. .\u00a0 kill him, kill him.@\u00a0 Appellant=s accomplice then hit Roney, and appellant and his accomplice each\r\nshot at Roney twice.\u00a0 Appellant and his\r\nfriends left Roney=s house\r\nwithout taking any drugs or money.\u00a0\r\nJanice and Roney=s\r\ngirlfriend, who was also in the house at the time, came to Roney=s aid as soon as appellant and his friends left, but Roney was already\r\ndead. \r\n\r\nWhile investigating the\r\nmurder, the police obtained a search warrant for appellant=s home.\u00a0 After conducting the\r\nsearch on October 8, 2004, Detective Johnson found (1) gray jean shorts, (2)\r\nReebok tennis shoes, (3) a .22 caliber Phoenix Arms pistol, (4) an unfired .308\r\nrifle bullet, (5) a box of Magtech .32 ammunition, (6) a key chain with two\r\nkeys, (7) blood samples on both the shorts and shoes, and (8) five baggies of a\r\nleafy green substance.\u00a0 Although the gun\r\nused in the offense was not recovered, the box of .32 caliber ammunition\r\nmatched the ammunition recovered from Roney=s body.\u00a0 In addition, blood\r\nsamples collected from appellant=s shorts and shoes, which he admitted to wearing during the offense in\r\nhis statement to the police, were identified as Roney=s blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, appellant filed a\r\nmotion to suppress the evidence found at his apartment and also requested a Abenefit of the doubt@ instruction regarding lesser included offenses.[1]\u00a0 The trial court denied both requests.\u00a0 A jury convicted appellant of capital\r\nmurder.\u00a0 Appellant was sentenced to life\r\nimprisonment in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal\r\nJustice.\r\n\r\nMotion to Suppress\r\n\r\nIn his first point, appellant\r\nargues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the\r\nevidence obtained from an illegal search of his apartment.\u00a0 Appellant contends the affidavit failed to\r\nstate sufficient facts to support a finding of probable cause that evidence of\r\nRoney=s murder would be found in appellant=s apartment.\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Swearingen v.\r\nState, the court of criminal appeals clarified a distinction between the\r\nstandards of review we should use when reviewing warrantless searches and\r\nsearches pursuant to a warrant.\u00a0 143\r\nS.W.3d 808, 810-11 (Tex.

App.CFort Worth\r\n2004, pet. ref=d) (op. on\r\nreh=g).\u00a0 When reviewing warrantless\r\nsearches, we apply the Guzman rule.[2]\u00a0 But when reviewing searches pursuant to a\r\nwarrant, in accordance with Swearingen, we apply the deferential\r\nstandard articulated in Gates and Johnson.\u00a0 Swearingen, 143 S.W.3d at 810-11\r\n(citing Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 234-37, 103 S. Ct. 2317,\r\n2330-32 (1983); Johnson v. State, 803 S.W.2d 272, 289 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n1990), overruled on other grounds by Heitman v.

Ct. at 2331; Davis, 144 S.W.3d at 197; see Bower v. State,\r\n769 S.W.2d 887, 902 (Tex. Crim.

Code Crim. Proc. Ann.\r\nart. 36.14 (Vernon 2007).\u00a0 Before the\r\ncharge is read to the jury, the defendant is entitled to reasonable time to\r\nexamine the charge and present any objections in writing.\u00a0 Id. \u00a0In addition, both parties are entitled to\r\nreasonable time to present written instructions to be included in the\r\ncharge.\u00a0 Id. art. 36.15 (Vernon\r\n2006).\u00a0 As a general rule, if evidence in\r\na case leaves a reasonable doubt as to the grade or degree of the offense, upon\r\na request by the defendant, the trial court must give the jury a Abenefit of the doubt@ instruction. \u00a0Benavides , 763\r\nS.W.2d at 589; Shelby v. State, 724 S.W.2d 138, 139 (Tex. App.CDallas 1987) (op. on reh=g), vacated on other grounds, 761 S.W.2d 5 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n1988).\u00a0 A Abenefit of the doubt@ instruction is required even when the charge includes a proper\r\ninstruction on reasonable doubt as applied to the whole case.\u00a0 Shelby, 724 S.W.2d at 139.\u00a0 This additional instruction clears up\r\nconfusion when the jury has no reasonable doubt that the defendant committed an\r\noffense, but is uncertain concerning the grade or degree of that offense. \u00a0Benavides, 763 S.W.2d at 589.\u00a0 A court=s refusal to include a Abenefit of the doubt@ instruction is not harmful to the defendant, however, if the charge\r\nas a whole leaves no uncertainty as to how to resolve any doubt.\u00a0 Id.; Shelby, 724 S.W.2d at 140.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, appellant asked for the\r\nfollowing to be added to the charge:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy other\r\nrequested charge is after or at the end of page 11, which is after the\r\napplication paragraph for aggravated robbery, I=d ask the Court to put a instruction in that says the C to the jury that if they feel that the Defendant=s guilty of one of the two offenses charged, that being capital murder\r\nor aggravated robbery, but they can=t decide which one it is, that they need to resolve that in favor of\r\nthe Defendant, or if they have a reasonable doubt about which one it is, they\r\nhave to resolve that in favor of the Defendant and give him the benefit of the\r\ndoubt and find him guilty of that offense of aggravated robbery.\r\n\r\nThe trial court denied appellant=s request.\u00a0 However, the trial\r\ncourt gave the jury the following instruction: \r\n\r\nNow, if you find from the evidence beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt that on or about the 7th day of October, 2004, in\r\nTarrant County, Texas, the Defendant Richard Lee Mathis, did intentionally\r\ncause the death of an individual, Roney Gibson, by shooting him with a firearm,\r\nand the said Defendant was then and there in the course of committing or\r\nattempting to commit the offense of robbery of Roney Gibson, or that the\r\nDefendant, Richard Lee Mathis, acting with the intent to promote or assist in\r\nthe commission of the offense of Capital Murder, if any, solicited, encouraged,\r\ndirected, aided or attempted to aid Antonio Hampton and Michael Freeman in the\r\ncommission of the offense of Capital Murder, if any, or that the Defendant,\r\nRichard Lee Mathis and Antonio Hampton and Michael Freeman agreed to rob Roney\r\nGibson, and that, while in the course of committing or attempting to commit the\r\noffense of robbery of Roney Gibson, if any, the shooting of Roney Gibson, if\r\nany, and was done intentionally and in furtherance of the conspiracy to rob\r\nRoney Gibson, if any, and was an offense that should have been anticipated as a\r\nresult of carrying out the conspiracy, then you will find the Defendant guilty\r\nof the offense of capital murder.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUnless you find beyond a reasonable doubt, or if\r\nyou have a reasonable doubt thereof, you will acquit the Defendant of capital\r\nmurder and next consider whether the Defendant is guilty of the offense of\r\naggravated robbery.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, if you find from the evidence beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt that on or about the 7th day of October, 2004, in\r\nTarrant County, Texas, the Defendant, Richard Lee Mathis, did intentionally or\r\nknowingly, acting alone or as a party, as that term has been previously\r\ndefined, while in the course of committing theft of property and with intent to\r\nobtain or maintain control of said property, cause bodily injury to Roney\r\nGibson and the defendant used or exhibited a deadly weapon, to wit: a firearm,\r\nthen you will find the defendant guilty of the offense of aggravated robbery.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUnless you find from the evidence beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt, or if you have a reasonable doubt thereof, you will acquit\r\nthe defendant and say by your verdict ANot Guilty.@\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the application\r\nparagraphs of the court=s charge\r\nfirst asked the jury to consider whether it found beyond a reasonable doubt\r\nthat the appellant was guilty of the offense of capital murder. \u00a0See Benavides, 763 S.W.2d at 589.\u00a0 Next, the application paragraph instructed\r\nthe jury that if it did not so find, it should acquit appellant of capital\r\nmurder and then consider whether he was guilty of aggravated robbery. \u00a0See id. \u00a0It further instructed that if the jury did not\r\nfind appellant guilty of aggravated robbery beyond a reasonable doubt, it\r\nshould acquit appellant of that offense as well.\u00a0 See id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe charge in this case\r\nclearly instructed the jury that it should acquit appellant of the greater\r\noffense, i.e., capital murder, if it was not convinced beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt of his guilt.\u00a0 See id.\u00a0 Furthermore, it also instructed the jury that\r\nif it had a reasonable doubt about appellant=s guilt concerning the lesser offense, aggravated robbery, it should\r\nacquit appellant of the lesser included offense as well.\u00a0 See id.\u00a0\r\nThus, no additional Abenefit of the doubt@ instruction was necessary.\u00a0 See\r\nid.; Shelby, 724 S.W.2d at 140.\u00a0 We\r\nhold that the trial court did not err in refusing the instruction, and we\r\noverrule appellant=s second\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nHaving overruled appellant=s two points, we affirm the trial court=s judgment.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nTERRIE LIVINGSTON\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nPANEL F:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LIVINGSTON, HOLMAN, and GARDNER, JJ.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nDO\r\nNOT PUBLISH\r\n\r\nTex.
