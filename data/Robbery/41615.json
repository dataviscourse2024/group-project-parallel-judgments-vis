            "opinion_text": "\nPATTERSON, Presiding Judge.\nW. A. Taylor was convicted of theft of property in the first degree, a violation of \u00a7 13A-8-3, Code of Alabama 1975, and was sentenced to six years\u2019 imprisonment. He appeals, raising three issues. Because of our disposition of this case, we find it necessary to address only one of these issues.\nTaylor contends that counsel who assisted him in striking the jury failed to present a motion under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), attacking the state\u2019s use of its peremptory challenges, and, therefore, that that counsel was constitutionally ineffective under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Taylor, who did not have the assistance of counsel when this case was called for trial, refused to participate in the striking of the jury.1 At that time, he stated:\n\u201cI\u2019m not waiving anything because I\u2019m not a lawyer. I do not understand the legal terminology.\u201d Thereafter, the trial court appointed Harold Odom, a member of the local bar, \u201cfor the sole purpose and special purpose of striking for the defendant.\u201d The court further stated that Odom\u2019s \u201conly participation in this case would be to make the strikes for the defendant at this time.\u201d It is apparent from the record that, after Odom assisted Taylor in striking the jury, Odom did not participate further in this case. It is also apparent that Taylor represented himself for the remainder of the trial. Our examination of the record reveals that the state used 8 of its 9 peremptory challenges to remove all of the black venirepersons. One of the black venireper-sons who was struck by the state served as the second alternate. Because the alternate jurors were not needed for deliberations, the jury that heard and ultimately decided this case was composed of 12 white individuals.\nAfter Taylor was convicted, but before sentencing, he retained counsel. Through this counsel, Taylor filed a motion for a new trial, wherein he contended that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, because of Odom\u2019s failure to present a Batson motion.2 The trial court denied this motion. Accordingly, this issue is properly preserved for our review.\nThe Alabama Supreme Court recently held \u201cthat the failure of trial counsel to make a timely Batson objection to a prima facie case of purposeful discrimina*1058tion by the State in the jury selection process through its use of peremptory challenges is presumptively prejudicial to a defendant.\u201d Ex parte Yelder, 575 So.2d 137, 139 (Ala.1990), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 273, 116 L.Ed.2d 225 (1991) (emphasis added). The supreme court explained its decision as follows:\n\u201c[The appellant] argues that an additional category under the \u2018presumed prejudice\u2019 exception should be created: failure of trial counsel to make a timely Batson objection when a prima facie case exists of purposeful discrimination by the State in the jury selection process. In order to protect and preserve the holding of Batson (that [\u2018pjurposeful racial discrimination in selection of the venire violates a defendant\u2019s right to equal protection,\u2019 476 U.S. at 86 [1717], ...) and to bolster public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice, 476 U.S. at 87 [1718], ... we agree with Judge Bowen\u2019s dissent that it is necessary to create the suggested additional category under the \u2018presumed prejudice\u2019 exception of Strickland.\u201d\nThe need to remand a case such as this to the circuit court has been fully explained as follows:\n\u201cIf the appellant\u2019s trial was marred by purposeful racial discrimination, then we must presume he has been denied the very protection the right to trial by jury was intended to secure. We do not know yet whether appellant\u2019s trial was marred by purposeful racial discrimination, because no Batson hearing was held. The cause should, therefore, be remanded for a Batson inquiry and should be procedurally in the same posture as other cases remanded for Batson determinations.\u201d\nYelder v. State, 575 So.2d 131, 137 (Ala.Cr.App.1990), rev\u2019d in part, 575 So.2d 137 (Ala.1991) (Bowen, J., dissenting) (emphasis original).\nThe state\u2019s unexplained use of 8 of 9 peremptory challenges to effectively remove all black venirepersons from the jury presents facially a prima facie case of purposeful racial discrimination. Because in the absence of a Batson hearing we are unable to determine whether Taylor\u2019s trial was \u201cmarred\u201d by purposeful racial discrimination, we must remand this cause to the circuit court for such a hearing. The trial court shall take all action directed in sufficient time to permit the circuit clerk to make a proper return to this Court at the earliest possible time within 60 days of the release of this opinion. The parties, of course, do not relinquish their respective positions regarding the other issues raised on appeal, and this Court reserves comment on those issues until the trial court complies with the directions contained herein and until a proper return is made to this Court.\nREMANDED WITH DIRECTIONS.\nAll Judges concur.\n\n. On September 18, 1991, the trial court held a hearing to inform Taylor that his retained counsel had withdrawn from his representation and that he needed to secure new counsel. On October 9, a plea bargaining hearing was held at which Taylor was represented by new counsel. The trial court informed Taylor that his case would be set for the week of November 12. The record reveals that on November 7 this counsel filed a motion to withdraw, asserting that he had been retained only for the purposes of the October 9 hearing, that Taylor had informed him that he was going to employ other counsel for trial, and that Taylor subsequently had informed him that he had obtained other counsel. On November 13, the day of trial, Taylor informed the court that he had been unable to secure representation and he sought a continuance. He indicated that he had attempted to secure representation \"all day Thursday [and] all day Friday,\u201d but that he had been unsuccessful. The court denied Taylor's motion for a continuance, stating: \"Mr. Taylor, you were advised back sometime in September [that] you would have to hire a lawyer or to represent yourself, [that] the case would not be continued. I\u2019m not going to continue the case ... [Y]ou\u2019re representing yourself this morning.\"\n\n\n. Taylor's assertion in his motion for a new trial that Odom \"was not present in court when the jury was qualified [and] was not present when the jury was given voir dire by the Court\" is supported by the record.\n\n",
