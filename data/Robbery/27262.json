He argued that the indictment failed to \u201cprovide the\ndefendant with protection against double jeopardy\u201d because the indictment failed to list a\n\n                                          -2-\n\fspecific victim in counts one and three and because the identities of the victims were\nunknown to the State.\n\n        Defendant Smith also filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the indictment had a\nfatal defect for failure to list a specific victim in counts one and three. In the motion,\nDefendant Smith acknowledged that, in State v. Clark, 2 S.W.3d 233 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n1998), this court held that an indictment charging a defendant with attempted aggravated\nrobbery was not insufficient for failure to list a specific victim. However, he argued that\nClark \u201cdid not consider the victim\u2019s identity as it relates to double jeopardy\u201d but instead\nconsidered the victim\u2019s identity as related to the defendant\u2019s ability to adequately prepare\nfor trial.\n\n        The State responded that the description of the victims in the indictment was\nsufficient to protect Defendants against double jeopardy. The prosecutor stated,\n\u201cFollowing trial, Defendant[s] can show with accuracy what occurred so that [they] can\nplead a formal acquittal or conviction should another case somehow be filed.\u201d Thus, the\nState argued, the present indictment was sufficient because \u201cDefendant[s are] on notice\nof the charges, the [c]ourt can enter a judgment, and double jeopardy is protected.\u201d\nMoreover, the State cited Clark, arguing that \u201c\u2018the identity of the victim does not serve to\nidentify the crime.\u2019\u201d 2 S.W.3d at 235.\n\n                                         Hearing\n\n        At the hearing on Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, Defendant Bowen\u2019s counsel\nreiterated his reliance on Wyatt, saying,\n\n              [A]s our Tennessee Supreme Court held in Wyatt, that in order for an\n       indictment to afford double jeopardy protection from any future charge of\n       attempted murder[,] because that case also was an attempted murder[,] it\n       must expressly state that the attempt to kill was made against a specific\n       victim on a date certain. So I submit that the indictment is insufficient.\n\n       Defendant Bowen\u2019s counsel also argued that, pursuant to Warden v. State, 381\nS.W.2d 244 (Tenn. 1964) and State v. Hill, 954 S.W.2d 725 (Tenn. 1997) (disagreed with\nby State v. Duncan, 505 S.W.3d 480 (Tenn. 2016)), the indictment was insufficient\nbecause it merely draws \u201ca legal conclusion. There is no specific allegation as to what\nthese gentlemen did to allegedly commit this attempted murder. [The indictment] just\nregurgitates the language in the statute for attempted murder.\u201d Defendant Bowen\u2019s\ncounsel also asserted that there was no way to confront and cross-examine victims who\nwere not identified, thus violating the Confrontation Clause of the United States\nConstitution.\n                                           -3-\n\f      Defendant Smith\u2019s counsel argued that the State\u2019s reliance on Clark was\nmisplaced:\n\n               [I]n [the Clark] indictment, then they could have filed . . . a [b]ill of\n      [p]articulars and had the State turn over more information concerning the\n      specifics surrounding that case. Well, I filed a [b]ill of [p]articulars in this\n      matter, your Honor, just because the [a]ppeals [c]ourts suggested that we do\n      that. . . . I filed a [b]ill of [p]articulars requesting the identity of the victim\n      -- of the alleged victims in this matter. But we know based on everything\n      the State has said in the past they\u2019re not going to be able to turn over the\n      identity of that victim or of those victims. It\u2019s not going to happen because\n      they don\u2019t know.\n\n        Defendant Smith\u2019s counsel thus concluded that he could not adequately prepare\nfor trial because he did not know the circumstances surrounding the alleged offense. He\nalso stated that the indictment was insufficient for protecting against double jeopardy,\nwhich was not at issue in Clark:\n\n               We don\u2019t know in ten years where I\u2019ll be, where you\u2019ll be, Judge,\n      where anybody in this courtroom will be. But in ten years -- ten years from\n      now somebody can come up and say hey, [Defendant] Smith tried to kill\n      me at some point and he gets re-arrested. And it might -- and well after this\n      case has maybe been tried and even acquitted or whatever could have\n      happened, but he has -- he could be facing these same charges after a trial\n      in ten years because of the lengthy statute of limitations and the complete\n      lack of knowledge of who . . . these alleged victims are. So [Defendant]\n      Smith is looking at not only having to go to trial on a case against\n      somebody that we don\u2019t know, he\u2019s also exposed to the potential of going\n      back to jail in the future because this person we don\u2019t know comes out and .\n      . . files a claim well within the statute of limitations.\n\n        The prosecutor responded that the indictment distinguished the victims by their\nclothing as seen in the surveillance video. He argued that the indictment provided\nsufficient notice: \u201cThe State believes that the indictment sets forth the short and plain\nstatement of the facts. [Defendants] know what the charges are. They know the date that\nthey occurred. They know it\u2019s on video, and that video\u2019s been provided.\u201d\n\n       The prosecutor also argued that Defendants were protected against double\njeopardy: \u201cWhat happens on down the road is they\u2019re protected [against double\njeopardy] in the sense that they know what we\u2019re talking about, when the event was, and\n\n                                             -4-\n\fit\u2019s on video, which is unusual.\u201d He quoted State v. Overton, 245 S.W.2d 188 (Tenn.\n1951):\n\n             [\u201cT]he true test of the sufficiency of the indictment is not whether it\n      could have been more definite and certain, but whether it contains the\n      elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the\n      defendant of what he must be prepared to meet[, a]nd if any other\n      proceedings are taken against [Defendants] for a similar offense, whether\n      the record shows with accuracy to what extent [Defendants] may plead a\n      former acquittal or a conviction.[\u201d] . . . That\u2019s their double jeopardy\n      protection.\n\n        The prosecutor then played a portion of the surveillance video for the trial court.\nThe surveillance video was included as an exhibit in the record on appeal. The video\nreflects that two men were walking on the street along a line of cars that were parallel\nparked. A white Hummer drove by firing two shots. The Hummer did not slow down or\nstop. The victim wearing light pants and a dark shirt dove to the ground between two of\nthe vehicles. The victim wearing dark pants and a light shirt ducked behind a vehicle and\nreturned six shots in the direction of the Hummer as it drove away. As the two victims\nstood near their vehicle, one person got into a vehicle four cars away and drove away.\nNext, another person got into a vehicle three cars away and drove away. Then, the\nvictims got into their vehicle and drove away as the police approached the scene with\nlights flashing.\n\n      The prosecutor drew the court\u2019s attention to the two unidentified victims and three\nwitnesses on the surveillance video. The prosecutor noted that two of the witnesses gave\nstatements to police regarding the incident.1 The prosecutor commented that, in\nstatements to the police, Defendants \u201cput themselves in the Hummer\u201d where the shots\ncame from. The following exchange occurred:\n\n      [DEFENDANT BOWEN\u2019S COUNSEL]: Remember. There w[ere] 800\n      pages of discovery. There\u2019s witnesses, witness statements.\n\n      [THE COURT]: I didn\u2019t see the 800 pages of discovery.2\n\n      [DEFENDANT BOWEN\u2019S COUNSEL]: That -- that put our clients in the\n      vehicle. But I think the State would acknowledge to you -- but I can only\n\n\n      1\n          The witness statements were not included in the record on appeal.\n      2\n          The \u201c800 pages of discovery\u201d were not included in the record on appeal.\n                                                  -5-\n\f       speak for [Defendant] Bowen that nobody has [Defendant] Bowen firing a\n       shot at all. He\u2019s driving a car (indiscernible).3\n\n       [THE COURT]: Is there a shot coming out of the Hummer?\n\n       [THE STATE]: (Indiscernible) in the Hummer.\n\n       [DEFENDANT BOWEN\u2019S COUNSEL]: There appears to be.\n\n       [DEFENDANT SMITH\u2019S COUNSEL]: There appears -- there\u2019s a flash\n       coming from the Hummer.\n\n       ....\n\n       [THE STATE]: [Defendant] Smith acknowledges having a gun and -- and\n       (indiscernible) shooting.\n\n       [DEFENDANT SMITH\u2019S COUNSEL]: [Defendant Smith] says that\n       somebody was shooting (indiscernible.) They fired back. There was a\n       (indiscernible) shooting.\n\n       The prosecutor and defense counsel explained that Defendants were originally\ncharged with reckless homicide in the death of a \u201cMr. Booker\u201d but that the State changed\nthe indictment to charge Defendants with attempted first degree murder for shooting in\nthe direction of the two unidentified victims as described in the indictment. Then the\nfollowing exchange occurred:\n\n        [THE COURT]: But you don\u2019t have anybody that can even testify\n       (indiscernible), or you don\u2019t even have the people that can come and say\n       that [the victims] were the ones they were shooting at.\n\n       [THE STATE]: That is true.\n\n       [THE COURT]: I\u2019m missing something because it\u2019s just not making sense.\n\n       [DEFENDANT SMITH\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, you can dismiss the\n       indictment because it does not protect against -- it does not provide\n\n\n       3\n         The trial transcript showed several instances where the court reporter could not hear or\nunderstand what was said.\n                                              -6-\n\fadequate notice to adequately prepare for trial and it does not protect\nagainst double jeopardy.\n\n[THE COURT]: Okay. But . . . as the [j]udge also, I have to look at both\nsides of it. And I see this side very clearly. Now, but there\u2019s another side\nthat there\u2019s a family out there that has someone that has been killed and --\n\n[DEFENDANT SMITH\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, no. That\u2019s not --\n\n[THE COURT]: No, no, no. I\u2019m just trying to walk through it, okay?\nThat\u2019s all I can do is try to walk through it and make it make sense. It\nmight not make sense, ultimately.\n\n[DEFENDANT BOWEN\u2019S COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get\nthere, but . . .\n\n[THE COURT]: But what I do have is a family out there that and that\u2019s\nwhat I\u2019m asking you, that you would have someone in their family that\u2019s\ndeceased, but there\u2019s no person that you can charge to say that that was the\nperson that committed the homicide.\n\n[THE STATE]: It is a sad, sad situation.\n\n[THE COURT]: I don\u2019t see how you\u2019re giving me --\n\n[THE STATE]: But there is a victim.\n\n[THE COURT]: -- any choice because, I mean, it\u2019s like even if we go to\ntrial tomorrow, I put you -- if I put them on the stand tomorrow if we\u2019re\ngoing to trial tomorrow, the jury\u2019s going to see that there [are] no victims.\nTo be honest with you, you can\u2019t tell except for [--] and I have not seen\nthese confessions that, you know, they\u2019re going to incriminate themselves\nin such a manner that the jury\u2019s going to say okay, that was them.\n\n[THE STATE]: I have a huge mountain to try to get over and I\u2019m trying to\nget over it today.\n\n[THE COURT]: [T]hat\u2019s just not justice to say that at the moment just to\nsay I\u2019m going to give you the opportunity to try to climb over this mountain\nthat almost doesn\u2019t even exist. I mean, I want to give you what you want,\nbut I -- you\u2019re not giving me legs to stand on right now . . . . [Y]ou have to\n                                    -7-\n\funderstand also you\u2019re talking about two separate cases. The one that to\nme was the strongest one is the one that you\u2019re sending out the door. Can\u2019t\ndo that, can\u2019t prove that . . . . You can\u2019t hold people in jail just because you\nthink they may be . . .\n\n[THE STATE]: I\u2019m not holding them in jail for killing Mr. Booker . . . .\nI\u2019m asking you to hold them in jail for shooting at these two guys that I\ndon\u2019t know who they are.\n\n[THE COURT]: And . . . until you find out who they are, you don\u2019t have a\nvictim, do you?\n\n[THE STATE]: I have unnamed victims, but -- I don\u2019t mean to be cute and\ngive you a cute answer, but --\n\n[THE COURT]: . . . But you don\u2019t have victims.\n\n[THE STATE]: I don\u2019t have the names. No, I do not. Not that I -- and I do\nnot have victims that I can put in that stand to say what happened . . . .\n\n....\n\n[THE COURT]: [Y]ou brought it to me and I raised the bond and I put\n[Defendants] in jail because I thought that the victims were -- had been\nidentified. [Defendants] had picked up two new charges, criminal attempt\nmurder first degree, and that there were victims. And that\u2019s why I did that.\nAnd then you tell me later (indiscernible) I could not -- and maybe I did; it\njust went over my head -- that they could not identify. So all of a sudden\nthat\u2019s what changed everything.\n\n       It\u2019s not -- you had a legitimate argument. Obviously if somebody\u2019s\non bond and they picked up two new cases and they\u2019re more serious, then\ntheir bond should go up. No question. But when you tell me that you don\u2019t\neven -- I mean, it could be -- as far as you know, it could be two people in\nthis courtroom sitting here right now that they were shooting at. That\u2019s not\nenough.\n\n[THE STATE]: I understand, your Honor.\n\n[THE COURT]: I don\u2019t mean -- you\u2019ve really backed me into a wall where\nI really don\u2019t think I have a choice. I really don\u2019t think -- I mean, honestly,\n                                     -8-\n\f      I\u2019m thinking now, I\u2019m going through everything that you\u2019ve told me. I\n      don\u2019t think any reasonable person could do anything else until you finish\n      your investigation. Not even talking about the double jeopardy thing. But\n      until you finish your investigation and you can say that these were the\n      people they were shooting at, we have witnesses that can say and confirm\n      that those shots came out of that Hummer and that this is what happened,\n      which is the case, and then the jury gets this case and the jury can decide.\n      At this point I can\u2019t see even giving it to the jury at this point. You have\n      shots fired. We have shots fired every night. We don\u2019t know where they\n      came from.\n\n      [THE STATE]: Well, we keep talking about the 800 pages of discovery. I\n      mean, I\u2019d have to piece it together.\n\n      [THE COURT]: Well, I\u2019m not privy to get -- to that . . . . So I don\u2019t know\n      what\u2019s in there. I mean, I\u2019m not privy to be able to pick apart and figure\n      out and say well, here\u2019s something they didn\u2019t talk about, here\u2019s something\n      they didn\u2019t talk about . . . . It\u2019s one thing not to know who the victims\n      were, but then I thought there were enough people out there on the scene\n      that could identify who -- that these were the people that shot from the car,\n      these were the people that were around.\n\n      [THE STATE]: I don\u2019t have that today.\n\n      [THE COURT]: Okay.\n\n      [THE STATE]: I mean, I\u2019ve got the people that were around.\n\n      [THE COURT]: You see what I\u2019m saying? People that were around that\n      could identify. But, I mean, to even basically identify somebody. You\n      know, a certain color shirt, a certain color pants. I mean, you know, we\u2019re\n      not even talking about a photospread, a photo up close. The people that are\n      shooting, can we use the computer in some kind of way to make sure that\n      we can see a face or something? . . . I personally think it\u2019s just premature.\n      I don\u2019t think that you don\u2019t have a good case; I just think it\u2019s premature for\n      where we\u2019re trying to go.\n\n      The trial court dismissed the case without prejudice and made the following\nstatement:\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f              I\u2019ve considered the arguments by both attorneys for [D]efendants. I\n       have considered the arguments, the written motions by the State. I\u2019ve gone\n       over the case law. This is one of those situations that is extremely unusual.\n       I don\u2019t want to let anyone think that the case is by any means over, but at\n       this time this case, as far as this [c]ourt is concerned, is somewhat\n       premature to go forward and I\u2019m going to dismiss it. But everybody needs\n       to understand the investigation continues. And as soon as the State comes\n       up with more information, evidence, photographs, witnesses -- because\n       everything points to what the State is trying to prove. But as a [j]udge,\n       right now there is not enough to go forward.\n\n       ....\n\n              The case will be dismissed at this time, but I want you to be --\n       everyone to be understanding and knowing that the investigation is going\n       on, it will go on, and there is a very good chance that this case will come\n       back in a few months . . . . Because when it comes back, based upon what I\n       just said, based upon what you all said, all of that is going to have to be\n       considered, whether it\u2019s in this courtroom or not in this courtroom. It\u2019s\n       only being dismissed because of what I said. There\u2019s not enough evidence\n       at this point to go forward. That\u2019s the only reason why it\u2019s being\n       dismissed.\n\n       On the judgment forms dismissing the indictment, the trial court noted:\n\n       BASED ON THE DEFENDANT[S\u2019] MOTION TO DISMISS, THE\n       STATE\u2019S RESPONSE, THE ARGUMENTS OF COUNSEL, AND THE\n       ENTIRE RECORD HEREIN, ALL COUNTS ARE DISMISSED\n       WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n\n       The State timely appeals.\n\n                                         Analysis\n\n                                   Weight of the Evidence\n\n       The State argues that the trial court did not rule on the issue presented in\nDefendants\u2019 motions to dismiss but instead \u201cdetermined sua sponte that the State\u2019s proof\nwould not be strong enough to take to a jury at trial and dismissed the indictment without\nprejudice as a result.\u201d It contends that the trial court committed reversible error by ruling\non factual questions, including issues \u201cintertwined with the issue of guilt or innocence\n                                           - 10 -\n\fthat should have been left to the factfinders after the presentation of evidence at trial.\u201d\nMoreover, the State contends that the trial court compounded its error by failing to\nreview all of the evidence before making a determination on the weight of the evidence.\n\n       Defendants respond that the trial court based its decision on their motions to\ndismiss and arguments of counsel, as it noted on the judgment forms dismissing the\nindictment.\n\n        Rule 12 of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in pertinent part,\nas follows:\n\n       (b)(1) A party may raise by pretrial motion any defense, objection, or\n       request that the court can determine without a trial of the general issue.\n\n       ....\n\n       (e) The court shall decide each pretrial motion before trial unless it finds\n       good cause to defer a ruling until trial or after a verdict. The court shall not\n       defer ruling on a pretrial motion if the deferral will adversely affect a\n       party\u2019s right to appeal. When factual issues are involved in deciding a\n       motion, the court shall state its essential findings on the record.\n\nTenn. R. Crim. P. 12. \u201cA motion to dismiss under Rule 12 allows the trial court to decide\nissues that are ripe for resolution without a full trial on the merits.\u201d State v. Sherman, 266\nS.W.3d 395, 403 (Tenn. 2008). \u201cGenerally speaking, pre-trial motions to dismiss that are\n\u2018capable of determination\u2019 involve questions of law, rather than fact.\u201d Id. (citing United\nStates v. Schulman, 817 F.2d 1355, 1358 (9th Cir. 1987) (\u201cA Rule 12 . . . motion to\ndismiss is appropriately granted when it is based on questions of law rather than fact.\u201d)).\n\u201cWhen considering such a motion, however, the trial court may make some findings of\nfact, so long as it does not encroach upon the province of the jury.\u201d Id. (citing United\nStates v. Jones, 542 F.2d 661, 665 (6th Cir. 1976)). \u201cWhere the factual findings\nnecessary to resolve the motion are intertwined with the general issue, a ruling must be\ndeferred until trial since, in criminal cases, there simply is no pretrial procedure akin to\nsummary judgment for adjudicating questions of fact involving the general issue of guilt\nor innocence.\u201d State v. Goodman, 90 S.W.3d 557, 561 (Tenn. 2002) (citing State v.\nVickers, 970 S.W.2d 444, 447 (Tenn. 1998); State v. Burrow, 769 S.W.2d 510, 512\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1989)). \u201cA defendant has no traditional procedural vehicle to\nchallenge the sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence prior to trial.\u201d State v. Merriman, 410\nS.W.3d 779, 787 (Tenn. 2013).\n\n\n\n                                            - 11 -\n\f        Here, during the hearing, the trial court discussed at length the weight of the\nevidence, stating, \u201cThere\u2019s not enough evidence at this point to go forward[,]\u201d and \u201cI\ndon\u2019t think that you don\u2019t have a good case; I just think it\u2019s premature[.]\u201d Based on the\ntrial court\u2019s discussion at the hearing, it appeared to be improperly weighing the evidence\nas it would for a motion for \u201csummary judgment for adjudicating questions of fact\ninvolving the general issue of guilt or innocence.\u201d Goodman, 90 S.W.3d at 561.\n\n       There are limited contexts in which a trial court may evaluate the weight of the\nevidence pre-trial. For example, in a Ferguson challenge, a court may weigh the\nadequacy of the State\u2019s evidence to \u201cprovide[] context to the lost or destroyed evidence,\nallowing the trial court to weigh the significance of the lost evidence in light of the other\nevidence and to determine an appropriate remedy, if one is required.\u201d Merriman, 410\nS.W.3d at 790 (citing State v. Ferguson, 2 S.W.3d 912 (Tenn. 1999)). Additionally, in\ndeciding to aggregate separate thefts into a single count, a trial court may determine if\nthere is \u201csufficient information before [the trial court] to establish that the prosecution\nhad probable cause to conclude that the Defendant\u2019s five separate thefts arose \u2018from a\ncommon scheme, purpose, intent or enterprise[.]\u2019\u201d State v. Jones, 589 S.W.3d 747, 759\n(Tenn. 2019) (quoting Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-14-105(b)(1)). Neither context arises in the\ninstant case. Defendants do not contend that the trial court properly weighed the\nevidence here. We determine that the trial court\u2019s pretrial weighing of the evidence was\nimproper, and, to the extent the trial court dismissed the indictment on this basis, it was\nerror.\n\n                               Sufficiency of the Indictment\n\n       Initially, we note that, based on the judgment forms, the trial court also based its\ndismissal of the indictment on Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and arguments of counsel.\nTherefore, although the trial court did not opine as to the merits of the sufficiency of the\nindictment issue, we determine that it did base its decision, at least in part, on the\nargument that the indictment language did not sufficiently protect Defendants against\ndouble jeopardy. Thus, we will address Defendants\u2019 claim of sufficiency of the\nindictment on the merits.\n\n        The State contends that, even if the trial court had ruled on the issue as presented\nby Defendants, that issue was not meritorious. The State argues that it was not required\nto list a specific victim for the crime of attempted first degree murder because \u201cthe\nidentity of the victim does not serve to identify the crime. Thus, the identity of the victim\nis not an essential element of the crime.\u201d Clark, 2 S.W.3d at 235; Jeffrey A. Simmons v.\nState, No. W2007-01925-CCA-R3-HC, 2008 WL 2115443, at *1 (Tenn. Crim. App. May\n20, 2008), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Oct. 27, 2008).\n\n                                           - 12 -\n\f       Defendants respond that they are \u201cexposed to the risk of one of these unknown\nalleged victims coming forward after a trial and making allegations that could arise to\ncriminal attempt: first degree murder.\u201d Defendants argue that the State \u201ccannot guarantee\nthat one of the two alleged victims does not come forward sometime within the [fifteen]-\nyear statute of limitations and make a claim that [Defendants] fired a gun at them but\nmisremember certain facts including the specific date on which it occurred.\u201d\n\n      The sufficiency of an indictment is a question of law that we review de novo with\nno presumption of correctness. State v. Patricia Ann Plasket, No. M2008-01876-CCA-\nR3-CD, 2009 WL 1313365, at *1 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 11, 2009) (citing Hill, 954\nS.W.2d at 727); Sherman, 266 S.W.3d at 403.\n\n       The Sixth and the Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and\nArticle I, \u00a7 9 of the Tennessee Constitution guarantee the accused the right to be\ninformed of the nature and cause of the accusation. U.S. Const. amend. 6, 14; Tenn.\nConst. art. I, \u00a7 9. Our courts \u201chave consistently interpreted these constitutional\nprovisions to require that an indictment: 1) provide notice to the accused of the offense\ncharged; 2) provide the court with an adequate ground upon which a proper judgment\nmay be entered; and 3) provide the defendant with protection against double jeopardy.\u201d\nWyatt, 24 S.W.3d at 324.\n\n       An indictment \u201cmust state the facts constituting the offense in ordinary and\nconcise language, without prolixity or repetition, in a manner so as to enable a person of\ncommon understanding to know what is intended and with that degree of certainty which\nwill enable the court, on conviction, to pronounce the proper judgment.\u201d Tenn. Code\nAnn. \u00a7 40-13-202 (2018). At common law, indictments were subject to strict pleading\nrequirements because the elements of the offenses were not easily ascertained by\nreference to a statute. Hill, 954 S.W.2d at 728. However, today courts approach\nchallenges to charging documents \u201c\u2018from the broad and enlightened standpoint of\ncommon sense and right reason rather than from the narrow standpoint of petty\npreciosity, pettifogging, technicality or hair splitting fault finding.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting United\nStates v. Purvis, 580 F.2d 853, 857 (5th Cir. 1978)). Generally, charging documents\nmust allege the material elements of the offense, and the \u201ctouchstone for constitutionality\nis adequate notice to the accused.\u201d Id. at 729. Specific reference to the statute defining\nthe offense may be sufficient to place a defendant on notice of the offense with which he\nis charged. Ruff v. State, 978 S.W.2d 95, 97 (Tenn. 1998).\n\n                   Identity of the Victim as an Element of the Offense\n\n       In Clark, the defendant was convicted of attempted aggravated robbery. 2 S.W.3d\nat 234. The defendant appealed, arguing that the indictment for attempted aggravated\n                                           - 13 -\n\frobbery was \u201cfatally deficient because it fail[ed] to name the victim.\u201d Id. at 235. \u201cThe\ndefendant argue[d] that the victim\u2019s identity [wa]s essential to prosecution of the offense\u201d\nof attempted aggravated robbery. Id. This court found that attempted aggravated robbery\nwas \u201cnot classified as an offense based upon its perpetration against certain classes of\nindividuals, such as police officers or children under a specified age.\u201d Id. \u201cIn other\nwords, the identity of the victim does not serve to identify the crime.\u201d Id. Thus, this\ncourt concluded that \u201cthe identity of the victim is not an essential element of the crime,\nand [that] the charging instrument [wa]s not defective merely for failing to identify the\nvictim.\u201d Id.\n\n       As charged in the present indictment, first degree murder is defined as the\n\u201cpremeditated and intentional killing of another.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-202 (2017).\nA person commits criminal attempt who, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise\nrequired for the offense:\n\n       (1) [i]ntentionally engages in action or causes a result that would constitute\n       an offense, if the circumstances surrounding the conduct were as the person\n       believes them to be;\n\n       (2) [a]cts with intent to cause a result that is an element of the offense, and\n       believes the conduct will cause the result without further conduct on the\n       person\u2019s part; or\n\n       (3) [a]cts with intent to complete a course of action or cause a result that\n       would constitute the offense, under the circumstances surrounding the\n       conduct as the person believes them to be, and the conduct constitutes a\n       substantial step toward the commission of the offense.\n\n\nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-12-101(a) (2017).\n\n        Here, Defendants\u2019 indictment does not identify by name the two victims of\nattempted first degree murder. However, attempted first degree murder is \u201cnot classified\nas an offense based upon its perpetration against certain classes of individuals, such as\npolice officers or children under a specified age.\u201d Clark, 2 S.W.3d at 235. Therefore, the\nindictment was not insufficient for failure to name a specific victim since the identity of\nthe victim is not an essential element of the offense. Id.; see also Curtis Taylor v. State,\nNo. W2018-00807-CCA-R3-PC, 2020 WL 628530, at *3 (Tenn. Crim. App. Feb. 10,\n2020) (concluding that because the name of the victim was not an element of attempted\nfirst degree murder, the indictment was sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the trial court\nand to charge an offense); State v.

Sept. 10, 2001). The trial court erred in dismissing the indictment because\nit did not state the name of the victim.\n\n                                      Bill of Particulars\n\n       Defendants agree that the court in Clark held that the identity of a victim \u201cis not\nrequired for an indictment to pass constitutional muster.\u201d However, they note that the\ncourt in Clark stated that \u201c\u2018a defendant needing more information in order to adequately\nprepare for trial on the charges against him might move the court to order the prosecution\nto provide a bill of particulars[,]\u201dsee Clark, 2 S.W.3d at 235, n. 3, which Defendants\nargue would have clearly provided the name of the victim in Clark. Thus, Defendants\nargue that because a bill of particulars would not provide Defendants with the identities\nof the victims in the present case, Clark does not apply.\n\n        Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c) states, \u201cOn defendant\u2019s motion, the\ncourt may direct the district attorney general to file a bill of particulars so as to\nadequately identify the offense charged.\u201d (emphasis added). Rule 7(c) \u201cprovides for a\nbill of particulars when needed by the defendant to know precisely what he or she is\ncharged with. This provision is to be construed to serve that singular purpose, and is not\nmeans to be used for purposes of broad discovery.\u201d Tenn. R. Crim. P. 7, Adv. Comm\u2019n\nComments.\n\n       In the present case, the State conceded that it did not know the identities of the\nvictims; thus, a bill of particulars would not produce their names. However, we conclude\nthat the identities of the victims, and thus a bill of particulars, would be superfluous in\nthis case to assist Defendants in \u201cadequately identify[ing] the offense charged.\u201d Tenn. R.\nCrim. P. 7(c). The indictment provides the date and location of the offense, provides the\nclothing each victim was wearing, and identifies the surveillance video which shows the\nexact conduct charged. Defendants know precisely the offenses with which they are\ncharged. Thus, Defendants\u2019 argument that Clark does not apply in the present case\nbecause a bill of particulars could not provide them with the names of the victims is\nunavailing.\n\n\n\n                                             - 15 -\n\f                                     Double Jeopardy\n\n       Defendants argue that, because the victims are unknown to the State, \u201cit is\nimpossible to guarantee that [Defendants are] not prosecuted twice for these same\nallegations.\u201d Defendants cite Wyatt to support their claim that the indictment does not\npass constitutional muster, arguing that Wyatt requires a specifically named victim in an\nindictment for attempted first degree murder in order to protect against double jeopardy.\n\n       The State responds that the indictments sufficiently protect Defendants against\ndouble jeopardy. It contends that Defendants\u2019 reliance on Wyatt is misplaced, stating that\nWyatt \u201cdid not establish required information that must be included in every indictment,\nbut rather set forth some indicia of specificity that provided Mr. Wyatt with sufficient\nnotice, in the aggregate, of the offense alleged against him in his particular case.\u201d\n\n       The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, states,\n\u201cNo person shall . . . be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or\nlimb.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. Similarly, the Tennessee Constitution guarantees \u201c[t]hat\nno person shall, for the same offense, be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d Tenn.\nConst. art. I, \u00a7 10. Both clauses provide three distinct protections: \u201c(1) protection against\na second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) protection against a second\nprosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) protection against multiple\npunishments for the same offense.\u201d State v. Watkins, 362 S.W.3d 530, 541 (Tenn. 2012).\n\n       In Wyatt, the petitioner pled guilty to attempted second degree murder and\nkidnapping. 24 S.W.3d at 319. The petitioner argued in his habeas corpus petition \u201cthat\nhis conviction and sentence [we]re void because his indictment failed to allege an overt\nact, which is a material element of attempted first degree murder[.]\u201d Id. at 323. The\nWyatt indictment named the victim as \u201cBillie Carey.\u201d Id. at 324. In concluding that the\npetitioner\u2019s indictment was sufficient, our supreme court stated that \u201cby expressly stating\nthat the attempt to kill was made against a specific victim on a date certain,\u201d the\nindictment offered the defendant \u201cdouble jeopardy protection from any future charge of\nattempted murder against that victim on that date.\u201d Id.; see also Michael Anthony Lewis\nv. Sharon Taylor, Warden, No. E2013-02492-CCA-R3-HC, 2014 WL 1920619, at *4\n(Tenn. Crim. App. May 13, 2014) (concluding that an indictment for attempted\npremeditated murder was sufficient because it \u201cset forth the crime of criminal attempt to\ncommit first degree premeditated murder in the words of the statute, named the victim,\nand named the month and year of the offense\u201d), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Oct 15, 2014).\n\n       However, the language of Wyatt is not prescriptive, but descriptive; Wyatt does not\nrequire the identification of a victim of attempted first degree murder for an indictment to\n                                           - 16 -\n\fbe sufficient but instead states that the identification of a victim, along with the date and\nlocation of the attempted murder, protects against double jeopardy. 24 S.W.3d at 324.\nDefendants\u2019 reliance on Wyatt for the proposition that a victim must be named for double\njeopardy protection is misplaced.\n\n       Moreover, the State contends that the language of the indictment is sufficient to\nprotect against double jeopardy concerns, arguing:\n\n       The language [of the indictment] specifies the day on which the shooting\n       happened, specifically references the surveillance videos that captured the\n       shooting on film (from which even further information can be gleaned), and\n       specifically differentiates the victims by the clothing that they were\n       wearing. If the victims were to come forward after the current prosecution\n       has ended, the State and [D]efendants would have enough information to\n       determine that the victims were speaking of the same shooting at issue in\n       the present case, thereby precluding a second prosecution for the same\n       offenses. The motions to dismiss should have been denied even on the\n       ground they raised.\n\n        We agree with the State\u2019s analysis. While there may be a case in the future where\nan unknown victim in an indictment is insufficient protection against double jeopardy,\nthis is not true in the present case. Thus, we find that the indictment in the present case is\nsufficient to protect Defendants against double jeopardy.\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       We find that the trial court erred in dismissing the indictment. Accordingly, we\nreverse the judgments of the trial court, reinstate the indictment, and remand the case for\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n                                               ____________________________________\n                                               ROBERT L.
