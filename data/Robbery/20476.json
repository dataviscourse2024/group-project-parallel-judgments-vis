Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.14\r\n(Vernon Supp. 2002).\u00a0 Law applicable to\r\nthe case concerning extraneous crimes requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt\r\nand an instruction \u00a0to that effect\r\nregardless of whether requested.\u00a0 Huizar\r\nv. State, 12 S.W.3d 479, 484 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\u00a0 Failing to give this instruction constitutes\r\nstatutory error,[2]\r\nand thus requires analysis under Almanza v. State, 686 S.W.2d 157 (Tex.\r\nCrim. App. 1985).\u00a0 Huizar, 12 S.W.3d\r\nat 482\u201383.\u00a0 Under Almanza, the\r\nreviewing court must first ascertain whether the error was preserved by\r\nobjection at trial.\u00a0 Almanza v. State,\r\n686 S.W.2d 157, 171 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984).\u00a0\r\nAn unpreserved complaint will not constitute reversible error unless the\r\nerror was so unfair that the defendant was denied \u201ca fair and impartial trial.\u201d\u00a0 Arline v. State, 721 S.W.2d 348, 351\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1986).\u00a0 Thus, a\r\ndefendant can only obtain a reversal if the error caused \u201cegregious\u201d harm to\r\nthe defendant.\u00a0 Id. A court must\r\nmeasure the degree of harm in \u201clight of the entire jury charge, the state of\r\nthe evidence, including contested issues and weight of probative evidence, the\r\nargument of counsel and other relevant information.\u201d\u00a0 Almanza, 686 S.W.2d at 171.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nAppellant did not preserve error and after reviewing the\r\nentire record of his trial, we conclude that he was not denied a fair and\r\nimpartial trial.\u00a0 The State presented a\r\nthirty-three page penitentiary report containing disciplinary infractions such\r\nas failure to obey orders, threatening guards, punching a guard, and indecent\r\nexposure.\u00a0 Appellant does not contest \u00a0the veracity of these reports; rather,\r\nappellant complains he was harmed by the sheer volume of the evidence presented\r\nand the prosecution\u2019s focus on the extraneous crimes.\u00a0 Although the prosecutor mentioned appellant\u2019s\r\nprior conduct in closing argument, she focused primarily on his 1990 conviction\r\nfor aggravated assault.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost important, however, the jury assessed a relatively low\r\npunishment.\u00a0 The statutory range of\r\npunishment in this case was 15 years to 99 years or life;[3]\u00a0 the jury, however, assessed a punishment of\r\nonly 25 years.\u00a0 Accordingly, we find no\r\negregious harm resulting from the trial court\u2019s failure to properly instruct\r\nthe jury. \u00a0See Brown v. State, 45 S.W.3d\r\n228, 232 (Tex. App.CFort Worth 2001, pet. ref\u2019d) (holding defendant was not\r\ninjured by trial courts failure to give reasonable doubt instruction regarding\r\nextraneous offenses when the jury assessed punishment well below the maximum\r\npermitted).\u00a0 Appellant\u2019s first issue is\r\noverruled.\r\n\r\nII.\u00a0 Voir Dire\r\n\r\nIn his second issue, appellant claims the trial court erred\r\nin permitting the State\u2019s attorney to offer a hypothetical scenario during her\r\nvoir dire examination that was factually specific to the case on trial.[4]\u00a0 We perceive no error in the prosecutor\u2019s\r\nremarks.\u00a0 However, even if the prosecutor\r\nerred, appellant lodged no objection to the remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a prerequisite to presenting a complaint for appellate\r\nreview, the record must show that counsel complained to the trial court by a\r\ntimely request, objection, or motion.\u00a0 Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1).\u00a0 To preserve error during voir dire, the\r\ndefendant must object to the prosecutor\u2019s statement.\u00a0 Jenkins v. State, 870 S.W.2d 626, 629 (Tex.\r\nApp.CHouston [1st Dist.] 1994, pet. ref\u2019d).\u00a0 Here, appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to\r\nthe prosecutor\u2019s use of a hypothetical scenario.\u00a0 Thus, appellant failed to preserve any error\r\nfor appellate review.\u00a0 See Ransom v.\r\nState, 789 S.W.2d 572, 583 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989) (holding appellant failed\r\nto preserve error by failing to raise the complaint at trial court).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, appellant\u2019s second issue is overruled.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nIII. \u00a0Ineffective Assistance of Counsel \r\n\r\nIn his third issue, appellant\r\ncomplains his counsel was ineffective for failing to request a reasonable doubt\r\ninstruction regarding the extraneous offenses introduced at the punishment\r\nphase of the trial.\u00a0 We find, however,\r\nthat appellant failed to meet the test for ineffective assistance of counsel set\r\nforth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688\u201393 (1984).\r\n\r\nUnder Strickland, appellant must demonstrate (1)\r\ncounsel\u2019s performance was deficient and not reasonably effective and (2) the\r\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u00a0\r\nId.\u00a0 Essentially, appellant\r\nmust show his counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of\r\nreasonableness, based on prevailing professional norms, and there is a\r\nreasonable probability that, but for his counsel=s unprofessional errors, the result\r\nof the proceeding could have been different.\u00a0\r\nId. at 693; Valencia v. State, 946 S.W.2d 81, 83 (Tex.\r\nCrim. App. 1997).\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly\r\ndeferential and we are to indulge a strong presumption that counsel was\r\neffective.\u00a0 Jackson v. State, 877\r\nS.W.2d 768, 771 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994).\u00a0\r\nWe presume counsel\u2019s actions and decisions were reasonably professional\r\nand that they were motivated by sound trial strategy.\u00a0 Id.\u00a0\r\nMoreover, to rebut \u00a0this\r\npresumption, appellant must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, why trial\r\ncounsel did what he did.\u00a0 Id.\u00a0 Any allegation of ineffectiveness must be\r\nfirmly founded in the record and the record must affirmatively demonstrate the\r\nalleged ineffectiveness.\u00a0 McFarland v.\r\nState, 928 S.W.2d 482, 500 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996), overruled on other\r\ngrounds by Mosley v. State, 983 S.W.2d 249, 263 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n1998).\u00a0 If the record contains no\r\nevidence of the reasoning behind trial counsel\u2019s actions, we cannot conclude\r\ncounsel\u2019s performance was deficient or speculate about the reasons behind trial\r\ncounsel\u2019s actions.\u00a0 Jackson, 877\r\nS.W.2d at 771.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\nIf appellant proves his counsel\u2019s representation fell below\r\nan objective standard of reasonableness, he must still affirmatively prove\r\nprejudice as a result of those acts or omissions. \u00a0Strickland, 466 U.S. at 693; McFarland,\r\n928 S.W.2d at 500.\u00a0 Counsel=s errors, even if professionally\r\nunreasonable, do not warrant setting the conviction aside if the errors had no\r\neffect on the judgment. \u00a0Strickland,\r\n466 U.S. at 691.\u00a0 Appellant must prove\r\nthat counsel\u2019s errors, judged by the totality of the representation, denied him\r\na fair trial, or his claim fails. \u00a0McFarland, 928 S.W.2d at 500.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nAppellant fails to provide this Court with any evidence to\r\naffirmatively demonstrate the ineffectiveness of his trial counsel.\u00a0 He did not file a motion for new trial, and\r\nthe record contains no evidence of the reasoning behind his trial counsel\u2019s\r\nactions in failing to request a reasonable doubt instruction at the punishment\r\nphase.\u00a0 Thus, appellant has failed to\r\nrebut the presumption that counsel\u2019s actions were reasonably professional and\r\nmotivated by sound trial strategy.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, appellant has not demonstrated that trial\r\ncounsel\u2019s performance prejudiced his defense.\u00a0\r\nAs we have already observed, appellant\u2019s punishment was on the low end\r\nof the statutory range.\u00a0 Appellant\u2019s\r\nthird issue is overruled.\r\n\r\nIV.\u00a0 Legal and Factual\r\nInsufficiency \r\n\r\nIn his fourth and fifth issues, appellant argues the evidence\r\nis insufficient to support his conviction.\u00a0\r\nSpecifically, appellant contends the evidence is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to establish appellant=s identity as one of the\r\nperpetrators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn evaluating a legal sufficiency challenge, we view the\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and determine whether a\r\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 Jackson v.\r\nVirginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 n. 12 (1979); Garrett v. State, 851 S.W.2d\r\n853, 857 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993).\u00a0 We will\r\nnot overturn the verdict unless it is irrational or unsupported by proof beyond\r\na reasonable doubt.\u00a0 Matson v. State,\r\n819 S.W.2d 839, 846 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).\u00a0\r\nThe jury, as the trier of fact, \u201cis the sole judge of the credibility of\r\nwitnesses and of the strength of the evidence.\u201d\u00a0\r\nFuentes v. State, 991 S.W.2d 267, 271 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n1999).\u00a0 The jury may believe or\r\ndisbelieve any portion of the witnesses\u2019 testimony.\u00a0 Sharp. v. State, 707 S.W.2d 611, 614\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1986).\u00a0 Therefore, if\r\nany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, we must affirm.\u00a0\r\nMcDuff v. State, 939 S.W.2d 607, 614 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997).\u00a0 \r\n\r\nAppellant argues the evidence is legally insufficient because\r\nhe was identified primarily by voice recognition.\u00a0 However, a voice identification may be made\r\nby means of an \u201copinion based upon hearing the voice at anytime under\r\ncircumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker.\u201d\u00a0 Tex.\r\nR. Evid. 901(b)(5).\u00a0 In fact, the\r\nuse of voice identification has been upheld many times.\u00a0 Norton v. State, 564 S.W.2d 714, 717 (Tex.\r\nCrim. App. 1978) (holding in a case of false report to a peace officer that\r\nvoice recognition was sufficient to establish the identity of the perpetrator);\r\nLocke v. State, 453 S.W.2d 484, 485 (Tex. Crim. App. 1970) (\u201cVoice is a\r\ncompetent means of identification if the witness had any previous acquaintance\r\nwith the person identified.\u201d); Fuller v. State, 858 S.W.2d 528, 530 (Tex.\r\nApp.CEastland 1993, pet. ref=d) (holding voice identification may\r\nbe used to identify the perpetrator of a sexual assault); Wright v. State,\r\n648 S.W.2d 35, 36 (Tex. App.CDallas 1983, no pet.) (holding that voice identification is\r\nneither unfair nor suggestive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, several witnesses identified appellant as the\r\nperpetrator.\u00a0 Two employees recognized\r\nappellant\u2019s voice because they worked with him for over four months.\u00a0 In fact, one of the witnesses worked closely\r\nwith appellant for two weeks and spoke with him several hours a day.\u00a0 Although the assailant wore a ski mask during\r\nthe robbery, both witnesses also identified appellant in a live lineup with\r\neach suspect wearing a ski mask.\u00a0\r\nMoreover, the complainant recognized the jacket worn by this assailant\r\nas the exact jacket that appellant \u00a0had\r\nworn to work almost everyday. \r\n\r\nFurther, the evidence suggests the robbery was committed by\r\nan \u201cinsider.\u201d\u00a0 For example, the\r\nperpetrators knew their way around the office, although it was not normally\r\nopen to the public.\u00a0 Also, the robbery\r\ncoincided with the time that sales persons were returning to the office with\r\ntheir cash receipts.\u00a0 Additionally, the\r\nhijackers knew the money would be in a blue canvas bag.\u00a0 Finally, during the course of the robbery,\r\nappellant yelled at one of the employees to \u201cget on the floor,\u201d and called him\r\nby name while doing so. \r\n\r\nIt is also probative that the hijackers targeted only\r\nselected employees for physical abuse.\u00a0\r\nAlthough appellant and his accomplices kicked and hit several employees\r\nduring the robbery, they focused their abuse on certain people, including Kenny\r\nSutton, one of the office managers.\u00a0 Montgomery\r\ntestified that appellant got along with his coworkers except Sutton because\r\nSutton told appellant to get rid of his dreadlocks.\u00a0 Appellant refused and Montgomery put him on \u201c9:00\r\nto 5:00.\u201d\u00a0 This required appellant to\r\npick up his products at 9:00 a.m., instead of 7:00 a.m. and return unsold\r\nproducts at 5:00 p.m., instead of 6:00 p.m.\u00a0\r\nAppellant blamed Sutton for his reduction in hours. \r\n\r\nFinally, we must presume the jury resolved any conflicting\r\ninferences on the issue in favor of the prosecution.\u00a0 Farris v. State, 819 S.W.2d 490, 495\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1990), overruled on other grounds by Riley v. State,\r\n889 S.W.2d 290 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993).\u00a0\r\nWe test the evidence only to see if any reasonable trier of fact could\r\nfind the elements established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u00a0 Jackson, 443 U.S. at 318.\u00a0 After examining the evidence, we find it is\r\namply sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to convict appellant of\r\naggravated robbery. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant, however, also contends the evidence is factually\r\ninsufficient.\u00a0 When conducting a factual\r\nsufficiency review, the evidence is not viewed in the light most favorable to\r\nthe verdict, and the verdict is set aside only if it is so contrary to the\r\noverwhelming weight of the evidence to be clearly wrong and unjust.\u00a0 Johnson v. State, 23 S.W.3d 1, 6\u20137\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2000).\u00a0 The evidence is\r\nconsidered equally, including the testimony of defense witnesses and the\r\nexistence of alternative hypotheses.\u00a0 Orona\r\nv. State, 836 S.W.2d 319, 321 (Tex. App.CAustin 1992, no pet.).\u00a0 We consider the factfinder\u2019s\r\nweighing of the evidence and can disagree with the factfinder\u2019s\r\ndetermination.\u00a0 Clewis v. State,\r\n922 S.W.2d 126, 133 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).\u00a0\r\nHowever, we are not free to reweigh the evidence and set aside a verdict\r\nmerely because a different result is more reasonable.\u00a0 Cain v. State, 958 S.W.2d 404, 407\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1997).\u00a0 We must defer to\r\njury findings and find the evidence factually insufficient \u201conly where\r\nnecessary to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d\u00a0\r\nId.\r\n\r\nAppellant specifically argues that the evidence is factually\r\ninsufficient because he had an alibi witness.\u00a0\r\nAppellant offered the testimony of his mother, Carrie Fields.\u00a0 Ms. Fields\u2019 testimony, if believed, placed\r\nappellant at home during the robbery; however, this evidence must be weighed\r\nagainst the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses.\u00a0\r\nMoreover, Ms. Fields had no independent recollection of the specific day\r\nthe offense was committed; rather, she remembered appellant\u2019s routine time to\r\nbe home.\u00a0 Ms. Fields was impeached to\r\nsome extent by her admission that she never went to police with the alibi claim\r\nbut, instead, waited until trial to acknowledge her son\u2019s innocence.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nThe jury disregarded appellant\u2019s alibi witness as was its\r\nright.\u00a0 Moore v. State, 804 S.W.2d\r\n165, 166 (Tex. App.CHouston [14th Dist.] 1991, no pet.) (holding jury is entitled\r\nto accept the State\u2019s version of the facts and reject appellant\u2019s version or\r\nreject any of the witnesses\u2019 testimony).\u00a0\r\nWe find the verdict was not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of\r\nthe evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.\u00a0\r\nAppellant=s fourth and fifth issues are overruled.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n/s/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 J.
