He argues that jurists of reason\n\ncould debate whether Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) and 60(b)(6) permit\n\nhim to challenge the district court\u2019s judgment denying his \u00a7 2254 petition by\n\f              Case: 14-14851     Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 2 of 21\n\n\nseeking a retroactive application of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Trevino v.\n\nThaler and Martinez v. Ryan. See Trevino, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S. Ct. 1911 (2013);\n\nMartinez, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S. Ct. 1309 (2012).\n\n      Insofar as the Rule 60(b)(6) part of the application is concerned, it is\n\nsquarely foreclosed by our decision in Arthur v. Thomas, 739 F.3d 611, 631 (11th\n\nCir. 2014). For that reason, no COA should issue on it. See Tompkins v. Sec\u2019y,\n\nDep\u2019t of Corr., 557 F.3d 1257, 1261 (11th Cir. 2009) (holding that a COA should\n\nbe denied where the claim \u201cis foreclosed by a binding decision [of] this Court\u201d)\n\n(quotation marks omitted). The Rule 60(b)(5) part of the application is not already\n\ncovered by binding precedent precisely on point, so we will discuss it. Wilson\u2019s\n\ncontention is that the final clause in Rule 60(b)(5), which permits litigants to\n\nchallenge \u201ca final judgment [when] applying it prospectively is no longer\n\nequitable,\u201d permits him to use Martinez and Trevino to raise ineffective-assistance-\n\nof-counsel claims that in his previous federal habeas proceeding were denied based\n\non procedural default.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      Griffin shot and killed Officer Joseph Martin while attempting to evade the\n\npolice after burglarizing a Florida hotel. Griffin v. State, 639 So. 2d 966, 967 (Fla.\n\n1994). He was convicted of first-degree murder, along with several other felonies,\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\f                Case: 14-14851       Date Filed: 05/28/2015       Page: 3 of 21\n\n\nand sentenced to death.1 Id. at 967\u201368. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed his\n\nconvictions and sentence on direct appeal. Id. at 972 & n.4. It also affirmed the\n\ndenials of his two motions for postconviction relief. Griffin v. State, 866 So. 2d 1,\n\n22 (Fla. 2003) (affirming the denial of Griffin\u2019s first Rule 3.851 motion); Griffin v.\n\nState, 992 So. 2d 819 (Fla. 2008) (unpublished) (affirming the denial of Griffin\u2019s\n\nsecond Rule 3.851 motion).\n\n       Griffin then turned to federal court, filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition in\n\nOctober 2008. The district court denied his petition a year later. Griffin v.\n\nMcNeil, 667 F. Supp. 2d 1340, 1373 (S.D. Fla. 2009). In its order, the court\n\nrejected five of Griffin\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on the grounds\n\nthat they were (1) procedurally barred and (2) meritless. See id. at 1357\u201362, 1366\u2013\n\n67. Both the district court and this Court denied Griffin\u2019s motions for a COA, and\n\nthe Supreme Court denied certiorari in May 2012. See Griffin v. Tucker, 132\n\nS. Ct. 2440 (2012).\n\n       Two years later, Griffin filed a motion in the district court under Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 60(b) seeking relief from the court\u2019s judgment denying his\n\n\u00a7 2254 petition. He argued that, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in\n\nTrevino and Martinez, he should be allowed to present four of his five ineffective-\n   1\n      Those additional felony convictions were: one count of attempted first-degree murder for\nthe attempt to kill Officer Martin\u2019s partner, one count of burglary, two counts of grand theft for\nstealing the getaway vehicle and the items from the hotel, and one count of being a convicted\nfelon in unlawful possession of a firearm. Griffin, 639 So. 2d at 967\u201368.\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\f              Case: 14-14851     Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 4 of 21\n\n\nassistance-of-counsel claims that had been held to be procedurally barred when his\n\nfederal habeas petition was denied in 2009. The district court denied the motion,\n\nreasoning that, among other things, Griffin\u2019s challenge could not be brought under\n\nRule 60(b). Griffin then filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n59(e) asking the court to alter or amend its order denying Griffin\u2019s Rule 60(b)\n\nmotion. The court denied that motion as well. Having failed to persuade the\n\ndistrict court, Griffin filed a notice of appeal and requested a COA, but the district\n\ncourt declined to grant one.\n\n      Griffin thereafter filed a motion in this Court seeking a COA, which a single\n\njudge of this panel denied. Griffin responded by filing a motion requesting that the\n\nCourt reconsider the denial of a COA and grant one on the following issue:\n\n\u201cWhether Trevino v. Thaler, 133 S. Ct. 1911 (2013) entitles Mr. Griffin to relief\n\nfrom the denial of his habeas petition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n60(b)(5) or 60(b)(6) such that the District Court should excuse Mr. Griffin\u2019s\n\nprocedural default barring his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim?\u201d As\n\nwe have already explained, the Rule 60(b)(6) part of the issue is squarely\n\nforeclosed by our decision in Arthur, 739 F.3d at 631. We turn now to whether a\n\nCOA should be granted on the Rule 60(b)(5) part of it.\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f              Case: 14-14851     Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 5 of 21\n\n\n                                          II.\n\n      To appeal the denial of a Rule 60(b)(5) motion, a habeas petitioner must be\n\ngranted a COA. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1); Jackson v. Crosby, 437 F.3d 1290,\n\n1294 (11th Cir. 2006). Where the issue involves both a procedural and a\n\nsubstantive component, a COA may not issue unless the petitioner makes the\n\nrequired showings: (1) \u201cthat he had a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional\n\nright,\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the procedural ruling is wrong.\u201d Jackson, 437 F.3d at 1295\n\n(quoting Gonzalez v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., 366 F.3d 1253, 1267 (11th Cir.\n\n2004)). \u201cThese two \u2018substantial showings,\u2019 both procedural and substantive, mean\n\nthat it must be \u2018debatable among reasonable jurists\u2019 both that the petitioner was\n\ndenied a constitutional right, and that the district court\u2019s procedural decision was\n\nwrong.\u201d Id. (quoting Gonzalez, 366 F.3d at 1268); see Tennard v. Dretke, 542\n\nU.S. 274, 282, 124 S. Ct. 2562, 2569 (2004); Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473,\n\n483\u201384, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 1603\u201304 (2000); see also Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S.\n\n322, 336, 123 S. Ct. 1029, 1039 (2003) (\u201cUnder the controlling standard, a\n\npetitioner must show that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that\n\nmatter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or\n\nthat the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed\n\nfurther.\u201d) (alteration omitted) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f              Case: 14-14851     Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 6 of 21\n\n\n      Griffin relies on the last clause in Rule 60(b)(5), which states that \u201cthe court\n\nmay relieve a party . . . from a final judgment\u201d if \u201capplying it prospectively is no\n\nlonger equitable.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5). None of the advisory committee notes\n\ndefine \u201cprospectively,\u201d but the word means \u201c[e]ffective or operative in the future.\u201d\n\nSee Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1417 (10th ed. 2014). The plain meaning of\n\n\u201cprospectively\u201d in this context is reinforced by decisions of the Supreme Court and\n\nthis Court.\n\n                                          A.\n\n      The Supreme Court has made it clear that Rule 60(b)(5) applies in ordinary\n\ncivil litigation where there is a judgment granting continuing prospective relief,\n\nsuch as an injunction, but not to the denial of federal habeas relief. In Agostini v.\n\nFelton, the Board of Education of the City of New York sought relief from a\n\npermanent injunction that was based on the Supreme Court\u2019s earlier interpretation\n\nof the Establishment Clause in Aguilar v. Felton. See Agostini, 521 U.S. 203,\n\n208\u201309, 117 S. Ct. 1997, 2003 (1997) (citing Aguilar, 473 U.S. 402, 105 S. Ct.\n\n3232 (1985)). The Agostini Court held that the Board was entitled to relief under\n\nRule 60(b)(5) because later Establishment Clause decisions had effectively\n\noverruled Aguilar, making ongoing injunctive relief based on that decision\n\ninequitable. See Agostini, 521 U.S. at 237, 117 S. Ct. at 2017.\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f              Case: 14-14851    Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 7 of 21\n\n\n      In its Agostini opinion, the Supreme Court limited its holding in the course\n\nof rejecting the argument that the decision would create \u201ca deluge of Rule 60(b)(5)\n\nmotions premised on nothing more than the claim that various judges or Justices\n\nhave stated that the law has changed.\u201d Id. at 238, 117 S. Ct. at 2018. The Court\n\nexplained that, because the last clause of Rule 60(b)(5) applies only to judgments\n\nwith \u201cprospective application,\u201d there would be:\n\n      no effect outside the context of ordinary civil litigation where the\n      propriety of continuing prospective relief is at issue. Cf. Teague v.\n      Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 109 S. Ct. 1060 (1989) (applying a more stringent\n      standard for recognizing changes in the law and \u201cnew rules\u201d in light\n      of the \u201cinterests of comity\u201d present in federal habeas corpus\n      proceedings).\n\nAgostini, 521 U.S. at 239, 117 S. Ct. at 2018. The Court\u2019s citation of Teague was\n\nto contrast federal habeas with \u201cordinary civil litigation where the propriety of\n\ncontinuing prospective relief is at issue.\u201d Id. With federal habeas, the operative\n\nprovision was not Rule 60(b)(5) but the retroactivity test announced in the Teague\n\ndecision. That test, as the Court noted, is \u201cmore stringent\u201d than the 60(b)(5) one.\n\nId.\n\n      The reason there was no need to worry about \u201ca deluge of Rule 60(b)(5)\n\nmotions\u201d based on nothing more than a change in the law, the Court reasoned, is\n\nthat the rule does not apply in most civil cases including, for example, federal\n\nhabeas cases. Id. at 238\u201339, 117 S. Ct. at 2018. The reason it does not apply is\n\nthat, unlike civil cases in which the judgment granted injunctive relief of some sort,\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                Case: 14-14851        Date Filed: 05/28/2015       Page: 8 of 21\n\n\nthere is no injunctive relief or continuing prospective effect within the meaning of\n\nRule 60(b)(5) in federal habeas cases. In this way the Court sent a clear message\n\nin its Agostini opinion that Rule 60(b)(5) does not apply in federal habeas\n\nproceedings, at least the typical ones where the judgment is an unconditional denial\n\nof habeas relief with no injunctive relief.2\n\n       The Supreme Court bolstered Agostini\u2019s interpretation of Rule 60(b)(5) in\n\nHorne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 129 S. Ct. 2579 (2009). The Court explained that\n\nthe portion of Rule 60(b)(5) governing prospective judgments \u201cmay not be used to\n\nchallenge the legal conclusions on which a prior judgment or order rests.\u201d Id. at\n\n447, 129 S. Ct. at 2593. Which is precisely what Griffin seeks to do here: use\n\n\n   2\n       Though Griffin does not mention it, Gonzalez v. Crosby notes the possibility that Rule\n60(b)(5) may be used in habeas proceedings where \u201cit is the State, not the habeas petitioner, that\nseeks to use Rule 60(b), to reopen a habeas judgment granting the writ.\u201d 545 U.S. 524, 534, 125\nS. Ct. 2641, 2649 (2005). A judgment granting the writ is different from a judgment denying the\nwrit in the respect that matters \u2014 the existence of injunctive-type relief. When the writ is\ngranted, the judgment typically enjoins the State to retry or resentence the petitioner within a\nspecified period of time or release him. See, e.g., Lee v. Lampert, 653 F.3d 929, 932 (9th Cir.\n2011) (\u201cThe court therefore granted Lee\u2019s petition, vacated his conviction and sentence, and\nallowed the State of Oregon 120 days to retry or release him.\u201d); Woods v. Dugger, 923 F.2d\n1454, 1456 (11th Cir. 1991) (\u201cThe district court granted the petition on the [Eighth Amendment]\nclaim, ordering the trial court to resentence [the petitioner] within 180 days and to take into\naccount all mitigating evidence as well as the jury\u2019s recommendation of death.\u201d); see also\nHarvest v. Castro, 531 F.3d 737, 748 (9th Cir. 2008) (explaining that an order granting a\nconditional writ of habeas corpus had prospective effect for purposes of Rule 60(b)(5) because\n\u201cthe conditional writ itself clearly contemplated continued supervision in that it ordered the State\nto \u2018file and serve a notice of compliance with this Order no later than sixty (60) days from the\ndate of this Order\u2019\u201d); Gentry v. Deuth, 456 F.3d 687, 692 (6th Cir. 2006) (\u201c[T]he district court\nretain[s] jurisdiction to enforce its conditional grant of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d); Phifer v.\nWarden, 53 F.3d 859, 861 (7th Cir. 1995) (\u201c[A] district court retains jurisdiction to determine\nwhether a party has complied with the terms of a conditional [habeas] order.\u201d). By contrast,\nwhen habeas relief is denied, neither party is ordered to do anything.\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f              Case: 14-14851     Date Filed: 05/28/2015     Page: 9 of 21\n\n\nRule 60(b)(5) to challenge the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that his four\n\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims are procedurally barred. Because\n\nreasonable jurists would not debate whether habeas petitioners may use Rule\n\n60(b)(5) to do what the Supreme Court has forbidden, there is no question that it\n\ndoes not provide a vehicle here for Griffin to relitigate the denial of his \u00a7 2254\n\npetition.\n\n       There is no later decision from the Supreme Court that could reasonably be\n\nread as undermining Agostini\u2019s teaching. Griffin cites the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\nstatement in Frew ex rel. Frew v. Hawkins that Rule 60(b)(5) \u201cencompasses the\n\ntraditional power of a court of equity to modify its decree in light of changed\n\ncircumstances.\u201d 540 U.S. 431, 441, 124 S. Ct. 899, 906 (2004). But he ignores the\n\nfact that Frew\u2019s reference to a \u201cdecree\u201d is limited to consent decrees, a unique form\n\nof civil remedy that has \u201celements of both contracts and judicial decrees.\u201d3 Id. at\n\n437, 124 S. Ct. at 903. A consent decree ordinarily provides a form of equitable\n\nrelief that has long been recognized as subject to potential modification by the\n\ncourt in the future. See 11 Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Mary Kay\n\nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2863, at 454\u201356 & n.13 (3d ed. 2012). An\n\norder or judgment denying a \u00a7 2254 petition is not a consent decree.

Birmingham News, 618 F.2d 1149, 1151\u201353 (5th Cir. 1980).5 We held\n\nthere that \u201crule 60(b)(5) applies only to judgments that have prospective effect as\n\ncontrasted with those that offer a present remedy for a past wrong.\u201d Id. at 1152\n\n(quotation marks omitted). We explained that judgments operate \u201cprospectively\u201d\n\nwithin the meaning of Rule 60(b)(5) if they \u201cinvolve the supervision of changing\n\nconduct or conditions.\u201d Id. at 1152 (quoting United States v. Swift & Co., 286\n\nU.S. 106, 114, 52 S. Ct. 460, 462 (1932)). The classic example is a continuing\n\ninjunction. See id. We also stressed that the rule\u2019s use of the term \u201cprospectively\u201d\n   4\n      The two single-judge orders issued by members of this Court granting COAs on the same\nbasic issue Griffin raises, see infra Part II.C, both quote Frew\u2019s statement that \u201cdistrict courts\nshould apply a flexible standard to the modification of consent decrees when a significant change\nin facts or law warrants their amendment.\u201d 540 U.S. at 441, 124 S. Ct. at 906 (emphasis added)\n(quotation marks omitted). See Order, Jimenez v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., No. 14-13932, slip op. at\n10 (11th Cir. Feb. 2, 2015); Order, Quintero v.

City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), we adopted\nas binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1,\n1981.\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\f              Case: 14-14851      Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 11 of 21\n\n\nto limit its applicability means that our application of the rule must recognize \u201cthe\n\nneed to achieve finality in litigation.\u201d Id. at 1153. Applying that understanding of\n\nRule 60(b)(5), we held that the consent decree at issue in Cook did not have\n\nprospective effect because: (1) the decree expressly stated that the court\n\n\u201c\u2018decline[d] plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for injunctive relief\u2019\u201d; (2) it did not order the\n\ndefendant to pay the plaintiffs; and (3) the district court \u201cdid not state that it\n\nreserved power to modify the decree or that it retained jurisdiction over the case.\u201d\n\nId. at 1152\u201353.\n\n      Cook means that Rule 60(b)(5) does not apply to decisions denying habeas\n\nrelief because they do not \u201cinvolve the supervision of changing conduct or\n\nconditions,\u201d they do not order either party to take any action, they do not include a\n\nretention of jurisdiction over the case, and \u201cthe need to achieve finality in\n\nlitigation\u201d is at its height in federal habeas proceedings. See id.; see also Engle v.\n\nIsaac, 456 U.S. 107, 134, 102 S.

United States, 340 F.3d 1219, 1224 (11th Cir.\n\n2003) (\u201c[O]ne of the principal functions of AEDPA was to ensure a greater degree\n\nof finality for convictions.\u201d).\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f             Case: 14-14851     Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 12 of 21\n\n\n      Other decisions of our Court have expounded Cook\u2019s interpretation of the\n\nword \u201cprospectively\u201d in Rule 60(b)(5)\u2019s. In Lee v. Talladega County Board of\n\nEducation, 963 F.2d 1426, 1432\u201333 (11th Cir. 1992), we held that the order at\n\nissue, which dissolved a previous injunction, did not operate \u201cprospectively\u201d for\n\npurposes of Rule 60(b)(5) because \u201c[t]here was nothing for the court to implement\n\nafter\u201d it entered the order. The same is true of orders denying habeas relief. And\n\nin Gibbs v. Maxwell House, 738 F.2d 1153, 1155 (11th Cir. 1984), we held that\n\n\u201c[t]he judgment of dismissal in this case was not prospective within the meaning of\n\n60(b)(5)\u201d because \u201c[i]t was final and permanent.\u201d We explained that the fact the\n\n\u201cplaintiff remains bound by the dismissal is not a \u2018prospective effect\u2019 within the\n\nmeaning of rule 60(b)(5) any more than if [the] plaintiff were continuing to feel the\n\neffects of a money judgment against him.\u201d Id. at 1156. The same is true of\n\njudgments denying habeas relief.\n\n      Our precedent construing the \u201cprospective\u201d requirement for application of\n\nRule 60(b)(5) is more law that places beyond reasonable debate the issue of\n\nwhether that rule can be used by \u00a7 2254 petitioners to attack final district court\n\njudgments denying them habeas relief. When the district court entered its\n\njudgment denying Griffin\u2019s petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, it did not\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f              Case: 14-14851      Date Filed: 05/28/2015      Page: 13 of 21\n\n\ninclude any features having prospective effect.6 Like the decree in Cook, the court\n\ndid not grant any form of injunctive relief, or order the State to take any action, or\n\nreserve continuing power over the case, or retain jurisdiction over the case. See\n\n618 F.2d at 1152\u201353. Like the order in Lee, there was \u201cnothing for the court to\n\nimplement after\u201d it entered its judgment and closed the case. See 963 F.2d at\n\n1432. Like the judgment of dismissal in Gibbs, the judgment was final and\n\npermanent. See 738 F.2d at 1155\u201356. And like the decree in Cook, the order in\n\nLee, and the dismissal in Gibbs, the judgment in Griffin\u2019s federal habeas case is\n\nnot reachable through Rule 60(b)(5).\n\n       We note that our sister circuits have also interpreted Rule 60(b)(5) in a\n\nmanner that forecloses any reasonable debate as to whether it can be used to\n\nchallenge the denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition based on later Supreme Court decisions.\n\nThe vast majority of them have adopted the D.C. Circuit\u2019s interpretation of\n\n\u201cprospectively,\u201d which limits the relevant subsection of Rule 60(b)(5) to final\n\njudgments that are either: (1) \u201cexecutory,\u201d in that they have not been fully\n\nexecuted; or (2) involve \u201cthe supervision of changing conduct or conditions.\u201d\n\nTwelve John Does v.

Comm., 560 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir. 2009) (citing Twelve John\n\nDoes and asking whether the judgment is \u201cexecutory\u201d or \u201cleave[s] open for future\n\nadjudication any issues regarding the rights of the parties\u201d). A district court\u2019s\n\njudgment denying a \u00a7 2254 petition does not meet that standard. It is not\n\n\u201cexecutory\u201d because there is nothing to execute after the entry of the judgment\n\ndenying the petition, and it does not supervise changing conduct or conditions\n\nbecause the judgment ends the habeas proceeding.\n\n      The three circuits that have not yet adopted the Twelve John Does standard\n\nhave nevertheless interpreted Rule 60(b)(5) in a manner that unquestionably\n\nforecloses Griffin\u2019s argument. Two of those three circuits follow the precedent of\n\nthis Court that we discussed in the previous section. The Fifth Circuit follows its\n\n(and our predecessor court\u2019s) decision in Cook. See Picco v. Global Marine\n\nDrilling Co., 900 F.2d 846, 851 (5th Cir. 1990) (citing Cook, 618 F.2d at 1151).\n\nAnd the Fourth Circuit has adopted our decision in Gibbs. See Schwartz v. United\n\nStates, 976 F.2d 213, 218 (4th Cir. 1992) (citing Gibbs, 738 F.2d at 1155\u201356).\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f             Case: 14-14851     Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 15 of 21\n\n\nThat means the Fifth and Fourth Circuits have adopted an interpretation of Rule\n\n60(b)(5) under which the denial of habeas relief is not a prospective judgment\n\nsubject to modification under Rule 60(b)(5). Finally, the Third Circuit has held\n\nthat judgments that are \u201cinherently final\u201d cannot be \u201cprospective\u201d for purposes of\n\nRule 60(b)(5). Marshall v. Bd. of Ed., 575 F.2d 417, 425 (3d Cir. 1978) (quotation\n\nmarks omitted); see Kock v. Gov\u2019t of Virgin Islands, 811 F.2d 240, 244\u201345 (3d\n\nCir. 1987) (explaining that \u201ca final judgment having conclusive, res judicata\n\neffect\u201d is not prospective under Rule 60(b)(5)). The district court\u2019s denial of\n\nGriffin\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was an inherently final judgment because, as we\n\nexplained above, it brought habeas proceedings in the district court to a close.\n\n      In the face of this Court\u2019s and every other circuit\u2019s decisions interpreting\n\nRule 60(b)(5), reasonable jurists could not find the district court\u2019s decision\n\nrefusing to apply that rule wrong.\n\n                                          C.\n\n      Griffin offers two arguments for why reasonable jurists could debate\n\nwhether Rule 60(b)(5) allows a \u00a7 2254 petitioner to challenge a final judgment\n\nbased on subsequent Supreme Court decisions. Neither has merit.\n\n      Griffin\u2019s first argument is that: \u201cWhile the judgment remains in force, the\n\nunderlying state court adjudication also remains in force, and so, too, does Mr.\n\nGriffin\u2019s death sentence. Mr. Griffin\u2019s continued imprisonment and pending death\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\f             Case: 14-14851     Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 16 of 21\n\n\nat the hands of the State is thus \u2018prospective\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(5).\u201d Motion to\n\nReconsider at 17. But that reasoning conflates the federal habeas judgment with\n\nthe state court judgment and the death sentence. As the D.C. Circuit explained in a\n\nnon-habeas case:\n\n      Virtually every court order causes at least some reverberations into the\n      future, and has, in that literal sense, some prospective effect; even a\n      money judgment has continuing consequences, most obviously until it\n      is satisfied, and thereafter as well inasmuch as everyone is constrained\n      by his or her net worth. That a court\u2019s action has continuing\n      consequences, however, does not necessarily mean that it has\n      \u201cprospective application\u201d for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(5).\n\nTwelve John Does, 841 F.2d at 1138. And as we explained in Gibbs, the fact that a\n\nlitigant continues to feel the effects of a judgment against him is not enough to\n\nestablish that the judgment operates prospectively within the meaning of Rule\n\n60(b)(5). See 738 F.2d at 1155\u201356; see also Coltec Indus., Inc. v. Hobgood, 280\n\nF.3d 262, 272 (3d Cir. 2002) (collecting cases rejecting arguments similar to\n\nGriffin\u2019s). Likewise, the fact that the federal judgment denying relief leaves\n\nGriffin under a death sentence does not establish that the federal judgment has a\n\nprospective effect. The refusal to enjoin an act, or interfere with the judgment of\n\nanother court, does not constitute the issuance of \u201ccontinuing prospective relief.\u201d\n\nSee Agostini, 521 U.S. at 239, 117 S. Ct. at 2018. Nothing in the district court\u2019s\n\njudgment requires the State to detain Griffin or to carry out his death sentence or to\n\ndo anything in the future. It simply refuses to prevent the State from carrying out\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\f             Case: 14-14851     Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 17 of 21\n\n\nthe sentence. Denial of continuing prospective relief is not issuance of continuing\n\nprospective relief.\n\n      This argument of Griffin\u2019s cannot be squared with the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\nopinion in Agostini. If he is right, every judgment denying a \u00a7 2254 petition by a\n\nstate prisoner on death row is a \u201cprospective\u201d judgment under Rule 60(b)(5) and\n\ncan be challenged whenever the Supreme Court issues a decision that changes, or\n\nmight change, constitutional or habeas law. That result would eviscerate our\n\nbinding precedent holding that Martinez (the Supreme Court decision that Griffin\n\nwants to apply retroactively) is not retroactively applicable. See, e.g., Chavez v.\n\nSec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 742 F.3d 940, 945\u201346 (11th Cir. 2014); Arthur, 739\n\nF.3d at 633. It would also make it much easier for habeas petitioners to attack the\n\ndenial of their \u00a7 2254 petitions using Supreme Court decisions issued after the\n\njudgment denying relief became final. After all, Rule 60(b)(5) requires only that\n\nthe moving party demonstrate \u201ca significant change . . . in law.\u201d Horne, 557 U.S.\n\nat 447, 129 S. Ct. at 2593 (quotation marks omitted). That is a much lower bar\n\nthan what a \u00a7 2254 petitioner must meet in order to receive the retroactive\n\napplication of a Supreme Court decision or to challenge a final judgment under\n\nRule 60(b)(6). See, e.g., Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 351\u201353, 124 S. Ct.\n\n2519, 2522\u201323 (2004) (explaining that few decisions should have retroactive effect\n\nunder Teague); Booker v. Singletary, 90 F.3d 440, 442 (11th Cir. 1996)\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f              Case: 14-14851    Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 18 of 21\n\n\n(explaining that Rule 60(b)(6) provides an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d that is limited\n\nto \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d and that \u201ca \u2018mere\u2019 change in the law\u201d will not\n\njustify relief) (quotation marks omitted). And, once again, the Court in Agostini\n\nindicated that Rule 60(b)(5) does not permit federal habeas petitioners to use the\n\nrule as a means to circumvent the \u201cmore stringent standard for recognizing changes\n\nin the law . . . in federal habeas corpus proceedings.\u201d 521 U.S. at 239, 117 S. Ct. at\n\n2018.\n\n        Griffin\u2019s second argument is that because two members of this Court have\n\nissued single-judge orders granting COAs on the issue of whether Rule 60(b)(5)\n\npermits retroactive application of Martinez and Trevino, we must agree that\n\nreasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s decision debatable. Motion to\n\nReconsider at 14\u201315 (citing Order, Jimenez v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., No. 14-13932\n\n(11th Cir. Feb. 2, 2015); Order, Quintero v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., No. 13-15896\n\n(11th Cir. Aug. 29, 2014)). We have, however, never held that the \u201creasonable\n\njurists\u201d standard under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) is a subjective one that turns on the\n\nview of a particular judge or judges. And we will not do so now.\n\n        Such a holding would conflict with how the Supreme Court has defined\n\n\u201creasonableness\u201d in other habeas contexts \u2014 which is using an objective standard\n\ninstead of a subjective one. The \u201cunreasonable application\u201d clause of \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\n\nand the \u201cfairminded jurists\u201d standard the Court has fashioned for that clause are,\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f             Case: 14-14851      Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 19 of 21\n\n\nlike the standard for issuing a COA, purely objective. See Harrington v. Richter,\n\n562 U.S. 86, 101, 131 S.

Because \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2019s\n\n\u201cunreasonable application\u201d standard is an objective one, the Supreme Court has\n\nheld that \u201cthe simple fact that at least one of the Nation\u2019s jurists has applied the\n\nrelevant federal law in the same manner the state court did in the habeas\n\npetitioner\u2019s case\u201d cannot be determinative. Williams, 529 U.S. at 410, 120 S. Ct.\n\nat 1522. Otherwise, the objective standard would be transformed \u201cinto a subjective\n\none.\u201d Id. at 410, 120 S. Ct. at 1521\u201322. The same is true here. If the fact that one\n\nor more judges had granted a COA on an issue, or even concluded that the issue\n\nhad merit, required all other judges to grant a COA on the issue, the standard\n\nwould be transformed from objective to subjective. It is not a subjective standard.\n\n      Griffin\u2019s any-one-is-enough rule for applying the reasonable-jurists standard\n\nfor COAs misses the point that the two judges who issued those single-judge\n\norders did not actually conclude that there was merit to his argument that Rule\n\n60(b)(5) could be applied to reopen final judgments denying federal habeas relief.\n\nThey instead concluded only that it was an issue about which reasonable jurists\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f               Case: 14-14851       Date Filed: 05/28/2015       Page: 20 of 21\n\n\ncould disagree. That is the same question that is before us, and a single judge\u2019s\n\nexpression of views in an order does not bind a panel of three judges. See 11th\n\nCir. R. 27-1(d)(2) (providing that single judge\u2019s COA order is \u201csubject to review\n\nby the court\u201d); 11th Cir. R. 27-1(g) (\u201cA ruling on a motion . . . by a single judge\n\n. . . is not binding upon the panel to which the appeal is assigned on the merits, and\n\nthe merits panel may alter, amend, or vacate it.\u201d); see also Boone v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t\n\nof Corr., 377 F.3d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir. 2004) (vacating the COA granted by the\n\ndistrict court).\n\n       Even if we misconstrued the issuance of a COA on an issue to reflect a\n\nbelief of the issuing judge that there actually is merit to the petitioner\u2019s position on\n\nthat issue \u2013\u2013 something it does not reflect \u2013\u2013 the fact that one or two judges\n\nbelieved an issue has merit would not compel us to issue a COA when we believe\n\nit does not.7 The test is purely objective, not subjective as to any judge or judges.\n\n       Griffin\u2019s contrary position, his any-one-is-enough rule, would have far-\n\nreaching implications and effectively make it impossible to deny a COA on any\n\nissue. Under his rule, we would not know that an issue is not reasonably debatable\n\n   7\n       The denial of a COA by three judges in a published opinion, however, does constitute\nbinding precedent that the issue in question has no merit. It does because a COA can be denied\nonly if the petitioner\u2019s position on the merits of the issue is not debatable among reasonable\njurists. And a holding that an issue is not reasonably debatable necessarily means it lacks merit;\notherwise it would be debatable. Cf. In re Provenzano, 215 F.3d 1233, 1235 (11th Cir. 2000)\n(citing as binding prior-panel precedent a three-judge order denying an application for a second\nor successive habeas petition); see also United States v. Kaley, 579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir.\n2009) (citing In re Provenzano as binding authority under the prior-panel-precedent rule).\n\n\n\n                                               20\n\f             Case: 14-14851     Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 21 of 21\n\n\nunless and until all 17 active and senior judges of this Court were asked their views\n\non it. And even if all of them agreed that the issue is not debatable among jurists\n\nof reason, what about the approximately 100 judges of the district courts in this\n\ncircuit? If, as Griffin insists, the view of one reasonable jurist is enough to require\n\nall judges to grant a COA, wouldn\u2019t those 100 district court judges have to be\n\npolled? If any one of them granted a COA on an issue, wouldn\u2019t we have to grant\n\na COA on the same issue in other cases?\n\n      And, of course, there are the other eleven geographic circuits with a total of\n\napproximately 1,200 district and court of appeals judges. Under Griffin\u2019s any-one-\n\nis-enough rule, if even one of those 1,200 judges believes that a COA should be\n\ngranted on the issue, we would be required to grant a COA. The any-one-is-\n\nenough rule cannot be, and is not, the law.\n\n      Griffin\u2019s motion for reconsideration is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\f",
