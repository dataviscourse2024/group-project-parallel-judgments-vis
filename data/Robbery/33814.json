As an alternative holding, we reject defendant\u2019s claim on the merits. The record establishes that defendant made successive unlawful entries into two places, each constituting a separate and distinct \u201cbuilding\u201d under the definition contained in Penal Law \u00a7 140.00 (2), and thus committed two separate crimes (see People v Felder, 2 AD3d 365 [1st Dept 2003], lv denied 2 NY3d 799 [2004]; see also People v Frazier, 16 NY3d 36, 41 [2010]). For similar reasons, we reject defendant\u2019s challenges to his waiver of indictment, and to the imposition of consecutive terms.
