Record No. 1572-16-4                                 JUDGE RANDOLPH A. BEALES\n                                                                            SEPTEMBER 11, 2018\n            COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA\n\n\n                                FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF FAIRFAX COUNTY\n                                            Randy I. Bellows, Judge\n\n                           Bradley R. Haywood (Sheldon, Flood & Haywood, PLC; Office of\n                           the Public Defender, on briefs), for appellant.\n\n                           Katherine Quinlan Adelfio, Assistant Attorney General (Mark R.\n                           Herring, Attorney General, on brief), for appellee.\n\n\n                   A grand jury indicted Andrew Schmuhl (\u201cappellant\u201d) on seven felony counts for acts he\n\n            committed during a home invasion on November 9, 2014. He was charged with two counts of\n\n            abduction with intent to gain pecuniary benefit, two counts of aggravated malicious wounding,\n\n            two counts of using or displaying a firearm during the commission of an aggravated malicious\n\n            wounding, and burglary while armed with a deadly weapon. Appellant filed a pretrial notice of\n\n            his intent to pursue an involuntary intoxication defense. Based upon this theory, appellant\n\n            sought to present evidence of his mental state on the night in question. Specifically, appellant\n\n            intended to show that he was suffering from \u201ca medication induced delirium.\u201d The trial court,\n\n            however, ruled that such evidence was not admissible under appellant\u2019s involuntary intoxication\n\n            defense because appellant did not argue that he was insane. Subsequently, after a more than\n\n            three-week jury trial, appellant was convicted on all seven charges, and he was sentenced to two\n\n            terms of life in prison plus an additional 98 years. Following a timely appeal to this Court, we\n\fgranted six of the twelve assignments of error appellant raised in his petition for appeal.1 We are\n\nnow reviewing the following assignments of error:\n\n                     VII.           The trial court erred in finding that Stamper v. Commonwealth\n                                    bars evidence of mens rea unless the defendant presents a\n                                    statutory insanity defense.\n\n                   VIII.            The trial court erred in finding that delirium, as well as other\n                                    serious effects of drugs, were insanity defenses, and not\n                                    properly the subject of an involuntary intoxication defense.\n                                    The error derived from application of the wrong standard for\n                                    distinguishing between intoxication and insanity.\n\n                       IX.          The trial court erred in circumscribing the manner in which the\n                                    defendant was permitted to prove affirmative defenses, such as\n                                    by excluding expert evidence, redacting records, and barring\n                                    the use of certain words.\n\n                        X.          The trial court erred in excluding mental state evidence offered\n                                    in support of an unconsciousness defense.\n\n                       XI.          The trial court erred in refusing an unconsciousness jury\n                                    instruction, finding that unconsciousness merged with\n                                    intoxication in this case.\n\n                     XII.           The trial court erred in denying an instruction defining\n                                    intoxication.\n\n              For the reasons that follow, we now affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.\n\n                                                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n                                                               A. The Home Invasion\n\n              \u201cApplying familiar principles of appellate review, we will state the facts in the light most\n\nfavorable to the Commonwealth,\u201d as we must, because the Commonwealth was the prevailing\n\nparty in the trial court. Ervin v. Commonwealth, 57 Va. App. 495, 499, 704 S.E.2d 135, 137\n\n(2011) (en banc). So viewed, the evidence established that on the evening of November 9, 2014,\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n              1\n         We have adopted, for the sake of consistency, the numbering convention that appellant\nused in his petition for appeal in listing his assignments of error. We denied appellant\u2019s\nassignments of error I through VI.\n                                                  -2-\n\fLeo Fisher (\u201cFisher\u201d) was in his McLean, Virginia home with his wife, Susan Duncan\n\n(\u201cDuncan\u201d). Duncan was preparing dinner when she alerted Fisher that a vehicle had come up\n\ntheir driveway. When the doorbell rang, Fisher answered the door. As he opened it, an intruder\n\n(later determined to be appellant) pushed the door inward and knocked Fisher off balance,\n\nforcing his way into the home. Appellant used a Taser on Fisher to subdue him. He also then\n\nbound Fisher\u2019s hands and feet with plastic zip ties.\n\n              Hearing what she described as \u201csome weird noises,\u201d Duncan testified that she went to the\n\nfoyer where she found Fisher lying on the floor. She stated that appellant then came toward her,\n\ngrabbed her, and bound her hands and feet with zip ties. Appellant flashed a badge and\n\nidentified himself as being with the \u201cVirginia SEC.\u201d2 He said he was arresting Fisher because he\n\nclaimed that Fisher had \u201csent an email placing a hit on a member of the Knights [Templar],\u201d a\n\ndrug cartel, in the amount of $370,000.\n\n              Appellant then forcibly moved the couple to their back bedroom and closed the curtains.\n\nDuring the move to the bedroom, Fisher recognized the intruder as Andrew Schmuhl. Fisher had\n\nmet appellant on numerous occasions because appellant\u2019s wife, Alecia Schmuhl, had worked as\n\nan attorney in the law firm where Fisher was the managing partner.3 Fisher also testified that he\n\nhad fired Alecia Schmuhl for performance-related reasons on October 27, 2014 \u2013 approximately\n\ntwo weeks prior to the home invasion. However, Fisher did not let appellant know that he\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n              2\n         There is no such government agency in the Commonwealth as the \u201cVirginia SEC,\u201d and\nappellant concedes as much in his opening brief to this Court.\n              3\n          Fisher testified that he first met appellant at the firm\u2019s holiday party in 2013. Appellant\nhad also worked for Fisher\u2019s firm as a contract attorney on a single project. Fisher further\nrecalled that in June 2014, appellant and his wife came to Fisher\u2019s office at the law firm to\ndiscuss an administrative matter. During the meeting, which lasted approximately ten minutes,\nFisher described appellant\u2019s demeanor as angry and \u201creally aggressive.\u201d Appellant \u201ckept raising\nhis voice. His voice kept getting louder and louder.\u201d Fisher testified that he repeatedly had to\nask appellant to leave his office before appellant ultimately left.\u00a0\n                                                   -3-\n\frecognized appellant because he did not want to \u201cdo anything that would upset him or get him\n\nangry.\u201d\n\n          In the bedroom, appellant \u201cstarted interrogating [the couple].\u201d Fisher stated that\n\nappellant \u201cseemed like he had a set of questions in different topics that he was going to ask us\n\nabout. And to me he seemed to be going through it quite systematically.\u201d Fisher described\n\nappellant as \u201cacting like a lawyer taking a deposition,\u201d and he indicated that appellant asked\n\nappropriate follow-up questions.\n\n          Appellant also asked Fisher, \u201c[D]o you know why anybody would\u2019ve put a hit on you?\u201d\n\nFisher recounted the specific exchange between him and appellant to the jurors: \u201cI said, I don\u2019t\n\nknow why anybody would do that. And [appellant] said, well, didn\u2019t you let somebody go\n\nlately? And at first I wasn\u2019t sure what he meant but he -- I realized he was talking about Alecia.\n\nHe never used her name.\u201d Fisher acknowledged that he had recently fired someone, and, despite\n\nthe fact that no one had mentioned Alecia\u2019s name, appellant asked, \u201c[W]hy was she let go?\u201d\n\n          When appellant moved the couple from the bedroom to the home office, he closed\n\nmultiple window blinds, which prevented anyone outside the home from observing the events\n\ninside. Appellant told the couple that \u201cthere might be a sniper\u201d outside.\n\n          Both Fisher and Duncan testified that appellant communicated with a third person during\n\nthe course of the home invasion. Duncan testified, \u201cOnce I saw him out in the foyer . . . . He\n\nwas flipping [the outdoor lights] on and off signaling somebody.\u201d Another time, Duncan\n\nobserved that appellant \u201chad th[e] door wide open and he was standing [t]here and he was talking\n\nto a woman outside.\u201d Fisher testified that appellant stepped away from the couple to speak on\n\nthe phone at least five times during the home invasion. \u201c[A]fter each call he would say things\n\nlike, I was just talking to my partner. Sometimes he would say I was talking to my boss.\u201d\n\nAppellant directed Fisher to access and open his office email, which Fisher testified contained\n\n                                                 -4-\n\finformation on the firm\u2019s employees as well as other information valuable to the firm. Appellant\n\nsearched through some of the emails and, according to Fisher\u2019s testimony, became frustrated\n\nafter apparently failing to find the information for which he was looking.\n\n        After appellant moved the couple back to the bedroom, he separated them by placing\n\nDuncan in the bathroom. Appellant told Duncan that separating them was necessary \u201cbecause\n\nthere may be things your husband won\u2019t tell me in front of you.\u201d Fisher testified that appellant\u2019s\n\nquestioning then continued on various topics. Appellant asked Fisher whether the couple kept a\n\nlarge amount of money in the house. Fisher testified that he thought, \u201cMaybe he wants money.\u201d\n\nHe further testified, \u201cAnd so I said to him, \u2018you know, we don\u2019t have any money here but we can\n\ngo to the bank.\u2019\u201d\n\n        Appellant then attacked Fisher. \u201c[H]e knocked me over, put a pillow over my face and\n\ncut my throat on the bed.\u201d Appellant also stabbed Fisher in the head and in the left shoulder.\n\nFisher screamed to Duncan, \u201c[H]e\u2019s killing me!\u201d Duncan, upon leaving the bathroom, saw\n\nappellant \u201con top of Leo and he was cutting his throat.\u201d Appellant yelled, \u201cGet out, ma\u2019am, get\n\nout now! Don\u2019t come in here, get out!\u201d Duncan testified that she saw appellant raise a gun \u201c[s]o\n\nI turned my head but I felt the bullet hit me. I fell down on the floor. And then I got up, I felt\n\nmyself getting up and I knew I was alive.\u201d The bullet had grazed Duncan\u2019s head and had lodged\n\nin the ceiling.\n\n        As Duncan reached for a nearby phone, appellant jumped on her and stabbed her\n\nrepeatedly across her neck, back, and shoulders. Appellant only ceased his attacks when Duncan\n\npretended to be dead. As appellant left the room, Fisher testified, \u201cI was on the floor and he\n\ncame past me and he kicked me in the head . . . . [H]e said, \u2018You\u2019re going to die.\u2019\u201d\n\n        Duncan hit the panic button on the home\u2019s security system, thereby activating an audible\n\nalarm. As she went to call 911, she saw appellant in the front foyer as he left the house. After\n\n                                                -5-\n\fthe police arrived, multiple officers noticed the odor of gas, and it was later determined that\n\ngasoline had been poured on the rug in the foyer. No gasoline was on the rug prior to that\n\nevening.\n\n       Fisher and Duncan were able to observe appellant\u2019s demeanor while he was in their home\n\nfor approximately three hours. Duncan characterized appellant as \u201cvery forceful, authoritative.\n\nVery much in control.\u201d Even though appellant argued that he was overmedicated, and, thus,\n\ninvoluntarily intoxicated, Duncan testified that appellant did not stumble or slur his speech.\n\nFisher likewise testified that appellant did not slur his speech at any point during the home\n\ninvasion.\n\n                                B. Pursuit and Arrest of Appellant\n\n       The first police officers to arrive at the home found Fisher on the front porch. Fisher was\n\nbleeding severely from his neck, and Officer Joseph Shifflett testified that he had to stuff his\n\nhands inside the wounds in Fisher\u2019s neck to slow the bleeding. Despite the severity of his\n\nwounds, Fisher was conscious and identified appellant as his attacker. A \u201cflash message\u201d was\n\nthen sent to police units to be on the lookout for appellant\u2019s vehicle.\n\n       Officer Daniel Custard testified that, approximately ten minutes later, he identified\n\nappellant\u2019s vehicle, which was traveling on Interstate 495. The officer stated that he activated\n\nhis vehicle\u2019s lights and siren, but appellant\u2019s vehicle refused to pull over. Officer Custard\n\npursued the vehicle and could see two individuals inside it. Custard testified that he \u201cobserved\n\nthe passenger in the vehicle reaching all over the vehicle, [he] appeared to be reaching under the\n\nseat and removing his clothing.\u201d\n\n       After appellant\u2019s vehicle finally stopped, police took the driver, Alecia Schmuhl, into\n\ncustody. Appellant exited the vehicle, \u201cwearing only an adult diaper.\u201d Officer Custard ordered\n\nappellant to the ground, and appellant was responsive to the officer\u2019s commands. He then\n\n                                                -6-\n\fhandcuffed appellant and placed him in the back of the police vehicle. After a brief period of\n\ntime, Custard returned to that police vehicle and observed a change in appellant\u2019s condition. He\n\ntestified, \u201cI noticed that there was a pretty distinct change in his level of consciousness. When I\n\nfirst spoke to him, he was very lucid, he was able to answer questions easily . . . . [W]hen I\n\nreturned to him he appeared to be almost passing out.\u201d Officer Custard further stated that\n\nappellant\u2019s eyes were \u201cin the back of his head\u201d and that he \u201chad an altered level of\n\nconsciousness.\u201d Custard asked appellant if he had taken anything illegal or any medications, and\n\nappellant told Custard that he had taken Dilaudid and fentanyl.\n\n       Officer Daniel Curcio observed appellant\u2019s demeanor after his arrest and at the hospital.\n\nWhile appellant sat in the back of the police vehicle, Officer Curcio noticed that \u201che was a little\n\nlethargic . . . . He seemed like he was kind of dazed, a little in and out.\u201d Officer Curcio also\n\ntestified that appellant briefly spoke to him in German. Based upon appellant\u2019s condition,\n\nCurcio asked appellant\u2019s wife, who was in a different police vehicle, if appellant had taken any\n\nmedication. She informed him that appellant had an implant for a back injury. Curcio testified\n\nthat he believed EMTs on the scene also removed a fentanyl patch from appellant\u2019s upper left\n\narm. Later, at the hospital, medical personnel also removed a second fentanyl patch, which was\n\nhidden beneath appellant\u2019s adult diaper. Officer Curcio also heard appellant tell medical staff\n\nthat \u201che had taken a handful of a muscle relaxer,\u201d called Tizanidine.\n\n                        C. Evidence Recovered from Appellant\u2019s Vehicle\n\n       Officer Matthew Keisling testified at trial regarding the physical evidence found in\n\nappellant\u2019s vehicle. Police recovered various pieces of clothing \u2013 some of which appeared to be\n\nstained with blood. The clothing was wet and smelled strongly of ammonia, and Officer\n\nKeisling testified that the odor of ammonia in the vehicle was overwhelming. Police also\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\frecovered a soda bottle that contained a small amount of liquid that smelled strongly of\n\nammonia.\n\n              In the vehicle\u2019s center console, police recovered a pill bottle labeled \u201cTizanidine HCl\u201d \u2013\n\nthe same muscle relaxer that appellant told officers he had \u201ctaken a handful of.\u201d They also\n\nrecovered Alecia Schmuhl\u2019s purse, which contained a list written in appellant\u2019s handwriting,\n\naccording to a handwriting expert who testified for the Commonwealth. The list stated:\n\n\u201chandcuffs, two bottles of Nyquil, two packs of Benadryl, adult diapers (male), two sleeping\n\nmasks (if available).\u201d\n\n              In a shopping bag, police found a disassembled handgun and five cartridges \u2013 one of\n\nwhich had already been fired. They also found a backpack that contained numerous items,\n\nincluding handcuffs, rubber gloves, a blood-stained knife, a package of zip ties, a box of\n\nBenadryl, two bottles of Nyquil, and a dark jacket. Inside the jacket were numerous items,\n\nincluding a Taser, Taser cartridges (two of which had been fired, as evidenced by the exposed\n\nwires and Taser darts), and a piece of tape that had been used to collect the anti-felon\n\nidentification devices (AFIDS) that a Taser releases when fired. Officer Keisling further testified\n\nthat no cartridges were found in the couple\u2019s home.\n\n              Police also recovered two prepaid cell phones from the vehicle, one of which had its\n\nbattery removed and its SIM card broken in half.4 The phones were activated on November 7,\n\n2014 \u2013 two days before the home invasion. On November 9, 2014, numerous calls were made\n\nbetween the two prepaid phones during the time that appellant was in the victims\u2019 home.

Thus, neither appellant nor his wife were actually\n\ncarrying their personal cell phones at the time of their arrest on November 9, 2016, as they had\n\nleft them at home.\n\n             D. Pretrial Hearings on the Admissibility of Expert Witness Testimony\n\n       Before trial, on November 20, 2015, defense counsel filed a notice which stated:\n\n               Andrew Schmuhl intends to assert at trial that his mental state at\n               the time of the offense met the legal standard for insanity, and [he]\n               intends to present evidence, including expert testimony, in support\n               of this defense. His mental state at the time of the offense resulted\n               from the use of medication.\n\nThe Commonwealth then filed motions to conduct its own evaluation of appellant\u2019s mental\n\nhealth and to review the report prepared by appellant\u2019s mental health expert. Appellant opposed\n\nthe Commonwealth\u2019s motions, arguing that the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-168.1 and\n\n\u00a7 19.2-169.5 did not apply to an involuntary intoxication defense. On November 30, 2015, the\n\ntrial court conducted a hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s motions and asked defense counsel to\n\nclarify his position on whether appellant was asserting an insanity defense, which entitled the\n\nCommonwealth to the motioned-for discovery. The trial judge stated:\n\n               I think you have to elect either you have given the Court an\n               insanity notice . . . and I will treat it as such and proceed from there\n               or you tell me it\u2019s not an insanity notice even though when I read it\n               I thought it was, but if you tell me it\u2019s not, I believe I have to\n               accept your representation because you get to choose.\n\nDefense counsel confirmed, \u201cIt\u2019s an involuntary intoxication notice . . . not an insanity notice,\u201d\n\nand based upon this representation, the trial judge denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motions.\n\n       On December 23, 2015, the trial court conducted a second hearing to determine whether\n\nexpert testimony about appellant\u2019s mental state would be admissible at trial. Prior to this\n\n                                                -9-\n\fhearing, the trial judge submitted questions to defense counsel to assist the court in resolving the\n\nquestion of admissibility.5 However, defense counsel declined to answer these questions and\n\nargued that his client could not be compelled to disclose trial strategy. The judge specifically\n\ninquired if defense counsel was willing to resolve the issue of expert witness testimony prior to\n\ntrial. The trial judge stated:\n\n                             [I]s it your position that this . . . ought not happen until we\u2019re in the\n                             middle of trial after opening statement; after you have made\n                             representation[s] presumably to the jury about what they are going\n                             to hear. That at that point and only at that point will this Court be\n                             able to make a ruling on the specifics of an expert testimony?\n\nDefense counsel subsequently acknowledged on the record that he understood the risk of not\n\nresolving the issue before trial. Defense counsel stated:\n\n                             [W]e\u2019ll have to take the time out maybe it\u2019s a two hour hearing . . .\n                             in the middle of trial to determine at that point whether the expert\n                             can testify [to] what we want them to testify to. If it\u2019s excluded . . .\n                             we are taking that risk.\n\n              Ultimately, the trial court asked whether defense counsel was \u201cunwilling to make a\n\nproffer as to the nature of . . . any expert mental health testimony [that he] wish[ed] to offer prior\n\nto trial.\u201d Defense counsel stated that he was unwilling to make such a proffer, and he further\n\nargued that the trial court ran the risk of violating appellant\u2019s constitutional rights if the court\n\nordered such a disclosure before trial. As a result, the issue of the admissibility of expert witness\n\ntestimony remained unresolved before trial.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n              5\n         The record indicates that the trial court submitted questions to defense counsel to\nascertain \u201cwhether you intend to call a mental health expert who will be relying upon any mental\nhealth records that may exist for Mr. Schmuhl and . . . on interviews conducted by your mental\nhealth experts with Mr. Schmuhl.\u201d The trial court also sought to determine whether expert\ntestimony would be specific to appellant or whether it would be more general in nature.\n                                                - 10 -\n\f E. The Court\u2019s Rulings During Trial on the Admissibility of Evidence and on Jury Instructions\n\n       On May 27, 2016, during the trial, the trial court conducted a hearing on the admissibility\n\nof expert witness testimony. During that hearing, defense counsel informed the court about the\n\nnature of its expert testimony. Defense counsel stated:\n\n               [Appellant] was suffering from . . . a medication induced delirium.\n               The diagnostic criteria for delirium include dramatically altered\n               mental state that develops over a short period of time, from hours\n               to days. It lasts from days to months, but it is temporary and it\n               eventually results in full recovery, often quite rapid. It fluctuates\n               in severity, meaning it waxes and wanes over the course of the\n               days, weeks, months, however long it lasts.\n\n       Defense counsel stated that \u201cthe way the law is written, we are sitting on a defense that\u2019s\n\npremised on temporary insanity,\u201d and he argued that the \u201cexpert should be permitted to testify in\n\nequal degree as one would in an insanity case . . . .\u201d\n\n       Following the hearing, the trial court ruled that appellant could not \u201coffer expert mental\n\nhealth testimony in support of its \u2018medication-induced delirium\u2019 defense,\u201d because, \u201c[t]he\n\nconcern the Court expressed to defense counsel on December 23rd \u2013 that \u2018what you\u2019re dealing\n\nwith is in fact an insanity defense that is not called an insanity defense\u2019 \u2013 has been realized.\u201d\n\nHowever, the trial court expressly stated, \u201cAssuming a proper foundation is laid, this Order does\n\nnot preclude the defendant from calling an expert to address the toxicological effects of ingested\n\nmedications.\u201d On June 1, 2016, defense counsel made an additional proffer that it intended \u201cto\n\nintroduce psychiatric testimony in support of the defense of unconsciousness.\u201d Based on this\n\nadditional proffer, the trial court likewise ruled that appellant was \u201cpreclude[d] . . . from offering\n\nexpert mental health testimony on an unconsciousness defense.\u201d\n\n       Pursuant to the court\u2019s decision to permit toxicological testimony but not \u201cpsychiatric\n\ntestimony,\u201d the court did not allow appellant\u2019s expert witness to use words like \u201cdelirium,\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\f\u201cpsychosis,\u201d \u201cdissociation,\u201d and \u201cdelusions.\u201d The court also redacted statements relating to\n\nappellant\u2019s psychiatric history from appellant\u2019s medical records, which were admitted at trial.\n\n       During argument on jury instructions, the court refused appellant\u2019s jury instruction\n\ndefining and describing \u201cunconsciousness,\u201d finding that the instruction on involuntary\n\nintoxication adequately covered appellant\u2019s defense of unconsciousness. The court also refused\n\nappellant\u2019s jury instruction defining \u201cintoxication,\u201d which the court found to be a word of\n\ncommon usage, and instead permitted the parties to argue the meaning of the word \u201cintoxication\u201d\n\nbefore the jury.\n\n                                           II.

Standard of Review\n\n       \u201cIt is well established that the admissibility of expert testimony is within the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial court, and that court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\u201d Patterson v.

The Trial Court\u2019s Interpretation of Stamper\n\n       Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it interpreted the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\nholding in Stamper v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 707, 324 S.E.2d 682 (1985), to bar evidence of\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\fmens rea unless a defendant presents an insanity defense. We review assignment of error VII de\n\nnovo. Abney, 51 Va. App. at 345, 657 S.E.2d at 800.\n\n              In Stamper, the Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow\n\nWalter Stamper to introduce evidence that, although he was not insane, he was manic-depressive\n\nand in a \u201cmanic state\u201d on the date that he committed the offense for which he was convicted.\n\n228 Va. at 715-16, 324 S.E.2d at 687. Stamper sought to argue that his diminished mental state\n\nrendered him incapable of forming the intent to distribute, a required element for his conviction.\n\nId. at 716, 324 S.E.2d at 687. The Supreme Court rejected Stamper\u2019s argument, declining to\n\nrecognize diminished capacity as a defense in the Commonwealth and further rejecting the\n\napproach that expert evidence could be used, in the absence of an insanity defense, to show that\n\nStamper lacked the necessary mens rea. Id. at 716-17, 324 S.E.2d at 688.\n\n              The Supreme Court in Stamper expressly held \u201cthat evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s\n\nmental state at the time of the offense is, in the absence of an insanity defense, irrelevant to the\n\nissue of guilt.\u201d Id. at 717, 324 S.E.2d at 688. The Court noted that the fundamental reason for\n\nthe exclusion of this evidence rests on Virginia\u2019s adherence, through the M\u2019Naghten rule, to the\n\ncommon law\u2019s use of a \u201cstable and constant standard of mental competence as the criterion for\n\nthe determination of criminal responsibility.\u201d 6 Id. at 716, 324 S.E.2d at 688.

In its decision, the Stamper Court emphasized what has always been the case in the\n\nCommonwealth \u2013 i.e., that \u201cthere is no sliding scale of insanity.\u201d Id. at 717, 324 S.E.2d at 688.\n\nThe reasoning behind a bright-line rule separating the sane, who are held criminally responsible,\n\nand the insane, who are not, is that the \u201cclassifications and gradations applied to mental illnesses,\n\ndisorders, and defects\u201d are subject to frequent revision. Id. at 716, 324 S.E.2d at 688. The\n\nresolution of each case cannot be \u201cdependent upon these subtle and shifting gradations.\u201d Id.\n\n              Appellant argues that the holding in Stamper is inapplicable to the case at bar because,\n\naccording to appellant, the Supreme Court in Stamper simply reaffirmed that the Commonwealth\n\ndoes not recognize the diminished capacity defense and reiterated that the M\u2019Naghten rule\n\ncontinues to apply to insanity defenses. He contends that Stamper does not limit evidence of a\n\ndefendant\u2019s mental state when the accused utilizes the defense of involuntary intoxication. We\n\ndisagree for several reasons.\n\n              First, appellant\u2019s argument attempts to ignore the express holding of the Supreme Court\n\nin Stamper. The Court made clear that the only way to negate mens rea with evidence of a\n\ndefendant\u2019s mental state is to plead an insanity defense.7 The Supreme Court\u2019s holding makes\n\nno exception for a defense premised on a defendant\u2019s involuntary intoxication. Since Stamper,\n\nthis Court has repeatedly held that evidence of a defendant\u2019s mental state is \u201cimmaterial\u201d and\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n              7\n         This holding is subject to the well-recognized exception that a defendant charged with\npremeditated murder may negate his mens rea for the offense with evidence of his mental state at\nthe time of the offense \u2013 without pleading insanity. Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 615,\n631, 292 S.E.2d 798, 807 (1982).\n                                               - 14 -\n\f\u201cirrelevant\u201d to the issue of mens rea where the defendant failed to put forth an insanity defense.\n\nId.; see Peeples v. Commonwealth, 30 Va. App. 626, 633-34, 519 S.E.2d 382, 385 (1999) (en\n\nbanc) (citing Stamper and affirming the trial court\u2019s exclusion of expert testimony about the\n\ndefendant\u2019s mental disability, offered to support his defenses of heat of passion and self-defense,\n\nwhen he did not allege an insanity defense); Bowling v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 166,\n\n172-73, 403 S.E.2d 375, 378-79 (1991) (citing Stamper and affirming the trial court\u2019s exclusion\n\nof expert testimony offered to show that the defendant\u2019s \u201cborderline mental capacity\u201d prevented\n\nhim from forming the intent to distribute narcotics, when he did not allege insanity).\n\n       Second, the defendant who pleads involuntary intoxication still falls squarely within the\n\nrule set in Stamper because involuntary intoxication is recognized in the Commonwealth as an\n\nalternative basis for an insanity defense, proven not by showing that the defendant had a\n\npre-existing mental disease or defect, but by showing that his involuntary intoxication produced\n\na defect in his mens rea that rose to the level of insanity, as set by the M\u2019Naghten rule.

App. 120, 132-34, 646 S.E.2d 899, 905-06 (2007), we\n\naffirmed a trial court\u2019s decision to place both the burdens of production and persuasion on the\n\ndefendant when he pled an \u201cinsanity defense of involuntary intoxication.\u201d In Morgan, we\n\nreferred to the alleged defense as \u201cthe affirmative defense of insanity,\u201d and this Court approved\n\njury instructions that required the defendant to prove \u201cthat he was insane due to involuntary\n\nintoxication.\u201d Id. at 133, 646 S.E.2d at 905.

Commonwealth, 135 Va. 524, 115\n\nS.E. 673 (1923), the Supreme Court acknowledged that a defense can be alleged on the basis of a\n\ndefendant\u2019s involuntary intoxication where the intoxication caused either \u201cfrenzy\u201d or \u201cmadness.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the Court in Johnson stated, \u201cIf, however, a person by the unskillfulness of his\n\nphysician, or by the contrivance of his enemies, eat or drink anything which causes frenzy or\n\nmadness, he is entitled to the same exemption from punishment for his acts thereby occasioned\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\fas other madmen.\u201d Id. at 533-34, 115 S.E. at 676 (emphasis added) (quoting Davis\u2019 Criminal\n\nLaw 29).\n\n       Furthermore, while the Model Jury Instructions in Virginia are certainly not binding\n\nprecedent, we simply note that the Model Jury Instructions in the Commonwealth on involuntary\n\nintoxication and on insanity support our conclusion that an involuntary intoxication defense\n\nrequires that the defendant prove that he was insane as a result of the involuntary intoxication.\n\nThe Model Jury Instruction on involuntary intoxication largely parallels the instruction for\n\ninsanity, except for the distinction that, with involuntary intoxication, the cause of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s inability to \u201cunderstand the nature, character and consequences of his act or . . . to\n\ndistinguish right from wrong,\u201d comes from his involuntary intoxication \u2013 not his mental disease\n\nor defect. Compare Model Jury Instrs.\u2014Crim. No. 53.300 (involuntary intoxication), with\n\nModel Jury Instrs.\u2014Crim. No. 53.150 (insanity).\n\n       In addition, appellant\u2019s argument \u2013 that the defense of involuntary intoxication is not\n\ncovered by the rule in Stamper \u2013 would, if it were the case, allow a defendant who pleads\n\ninvoluntary intoxication to avoid the statutory pleading requirements. The General Assembly\n\nhas given the Commonwealth the statutory right to evaluate a defendant\u2019s mental state \u2013 once the\n\ndefendant has given notice of intent to place his sanity at issue. The Commonwealth may\n\nconduct its own evaluation of the defendant through a different mental health expert appointed\n\nby the court, and it may review the report created by the defendant\u2019s mental health expert, the\n\nresults of any \u201cevaluation of the defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense,\u201d and copies of\n\nrecords \u201cobtained during the course of any such evaluation.\u201d See Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-168, 19.2-168.1,\n\n19.2-169.5. A defendant\u2019s failure to properly and timely comply with these statutory\n\nrequirements could result in the defendant\u2019s evidence of his mental state being barred at trial.\n\nSee Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-168, 19.2-168.1. These statutory procedures \u2013 which are not, as appellant\n\n                                                - 16 -\n\fdescribes them, a separate \u201cstatutory insanity defense\u201d \u2013 reflect the principle that \u201cthe\n\nCommonwealth, like the defendant, is entitled to a fair trial, which includes \u2018the right to a fair\n\nrebuttal of mental health evidence presented by the defendant.\u2019\u201d Grattan v. Commonwealth, 278\n\nVa. 602, 622, 685 S.E.2d 634, 645 (2009) (quoting Muhammad v. Commonwealth, 269 Va. 451,\n\n507, 619 S.E.2d 16, 48 (2005)). Appellant\u2019s argument that he should be permitted to present\n\nevidence of his mental state because he has labeled his defense as \u201cinvoluntary intoxication\u201d\n\ninstead of \u201cinsanity\u201d would improperly allow appellant to circumvent these statutory\n\nrequirements.\n\n       In short, involuntary intoxication can be another means to prove insanity if the defendant\n\ncan satisfy the M\u2019Naghten rule. In other words, involuntary intoxication only negates mens rea\n\nif the accused can show that he met the legal standard for insanity \u2013 that he did not understand\n\nthe nature, character, and consequences of his act or that he was unable to distinguish right from\n\nwrong \u2013 at the time he committed the offense. The accused may not put forth expert evidence of\n\nhis mental state as to his specific intent, pursuant to an involuntary intoxication defense, unless\n\nthe evidence shows that he passed the legal threshold of insanity due to his involuntary\n\nintoxication. Therefore, a defendant who pleads involuntary intoxication in this situation must\n\ncomply with the statutory requirements for putting on an insanity defense. Involuntary\n\nintoxication is not a back-door way for the introduction of expert evidence of a defendant\u2019s\n\nmental state. This holding is consistent with the common law tradition in the Commonwealth\n\nthat insanity is proven only by meeting the requirements of the M\u2019Naghten rule, consistent with\n\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Stamper, and consistent with the statutory procedural\n\nrequirements set by the General Assembly.\n\n       By offering expert evidence of his mental state, but refusing to plead insanity, appellant\n\nattempted to avoid the rules that dictate how such evidence must be disclosed. Appellant\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\fessentially wants all the benefits afforded an insanity argument without the associated\n\nresponsibility for notice to the court required by statute and case law. The trial court was correct\n\nin finding that the Supreme Court in Stamper has precluded the use of evidence of a defendant\u2019s\n\nmental state to negate mens rea, unless it arises from an insanity defense. Therefore, the trial\n\ncourt did not err in finding that, under Stamper, appellant\u2019s expert evidence related to his mental\n\nstate and mens rea was inadmissible because, although appellant pleaded involuntary\n\nintoxication, he did not plead insanity and did not follow the statutory requirements for putting\n\nforward an insanity defense.8\n\nC. The Trial Court\u2019s Finding that Appellant Alleged an Insanity Defense Without the Statutorily\n                                       Required Notice\n\n              In assignment of error VIII, appellant argues that the trial court erred by finding that his\n\ninvoluntary intoxication defense amounted to an insanity defense. He argues that his\n\n\u201cmedication induced delirium\u201d did not amount to insanity because it resulted from his\n\nmedication, and it \u201cresolved immediately after the medications were eliminated or neutralized.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n              8\n          In addition, appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s reading of Stamper conflicts with\nexisting precedent is easily dismissed. In Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, the accused was\npermitted to offer expert testimony on his intoxicated mental state, pursuant to the exception that\na defendant, who committed murder while voluntarily intoxicated, may negate his mens rea for\ncapital murder without pleading insanity. 223 Va. at 624-25, 292 S.E.2d at 803. This exception\napplies \u201cwhen a person voluntarily becomes so intoxicated that he is incapable of deliberation or\npremeditation, he cannot commit a class of murder that requires proof of a deliberate and\npremeditated killing.\u201d Wright v. Commonwealth, 234 Va. 627, 629, 363 S.E.2d 711, 712 (1988).\nBecause appellant in this case was not charged with premeditated murder, the exception is\ninapplicable here. Likewise, Pritchett v. Commonwealth, 263 Va. 182, 557 S.E.2d 205 (2002), is\nalso unpersuasive here. In Pritchett, the Supreme Court held that the trial court erred in\nexcluding expert testimony as to the hypothetical effect of the defendant\u2019s mental disorder on the\nreliability of his confession in a police interview \u2013 not as to his mens rea actually to commit the\nunderlying crime. Id. at 187, 557 S.E.2d at 208. The Court in Pritchett did not consider expert\nevidence of the defendant\u2019s mental state as to his specific intent to commit the crime. Therefore,\nneither the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Fitzgerald nor in Pritchett contradicts its clear holding in\nStamper, and neither is applicable to the case now before us.\n                                                 - 18 -\n\f              Despite the numerous assertions by appellant\u2019s counsel that appellant was not pleading an\n\naffirmative defense of insanity, appellant\u2019s counsel stated during his proffer on May 27, 2016:\n\n\u201cthis is, in essence, it\u2019s a claim of insanity, a claim of temporary insanity.\u201d Counsel for appellant\n\nmaintained, however, that the defense was not \u201cthe insanity defense according to statute.\u201d The\n\nprosecutor argued, during the May 27, 2016 hearing, that appellant\u2019s defense was premised not\n\non intoxication but on a mental defect from \u201cmedication induced delirium.\u201d Appellant noticed\n\nhis intent to rely on expert testimony regarding a psychiatric evaluation of appellant and certain\n\n\u201cpredisposing and precipitating factors\u201d like \u201cchronic pain, hypertension, stress, sleep\n\ndeprivation, drug dependence, history of neurological disease[,] dehydration, and depression\u201d \u2013\n\nany combination of which, he argued, could have made appellant more susceptible to the\n\ndelirium.\n\n              Both the proffered evidence and appellant\u2019s assertions demonstrate that appellant was\n\nattempting to negate mens rea by offering expert evidence of his mental state. Whether\n\nappellant\u2019s alleged lack of mens rea for the charged offenses resulted from the intoxicating\n\nsubstances that he consumed9 or from a mental defect caused by \u201cpredisposing and precipitating\n\nfactors,\u201d his argument here is without merit. An accused can completely negate the required\n\nmens rea for the crimes charged by showing that he met the legal standard for insanity.\n\nTherefore, the trial court did not err here in concluding that appellant\u2019s claim to lack mens rea\n\nfor the offenses, which he tried to prove in part by the admission of evidence of his mental state,\n\nwas actually an insanity defense. We need not decide for the purposes of this appeal whether his\n\ndefense was premised on a mental defect or on involuntary intoxication. Appellant could have\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n              9\n         Here, the jury, as factfinder, may well have found appellant\u2019s testimony that he was\ninvoluntarily intoxicated to be incredible, as appellant took the drugs himself and was using at\nleast one medication \u2013 the fentanyl patches \u2013 in a dosage twice as high as his prescription\nallowed.\n                                                - 19 -\n\fshown a viable defense to negate mens rea by proving insanity, but he failed to do so or even to\n\nfollow the required statutory procedures that would have allowed him to put on such a defense.\n\n               D. The Trial Court\u2019s Exclusion of Evidence of Appellant\u2019s Mental State to Show\n                       Unconsciousness and Its Limitation of Psychiatric Testimony\n\n              In assignment of error X, appellant argues that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in excluding mental\n\nstate evidence offered in support of an unconsciousness defense.\u201d10 In assignment of error IX,\n\nappellant argues that \u201c[t]he trial court erred by circumscribing the manner in which the defendant\n\nwas permitted to prove affirmative defenses, such as by excluding expert evidence, redacting\n\nrecords, and barring the use of certain words.\u201d Appellant acknowledges that a trial court\u2019s\n\ndecision on the admissibility of evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See Abney, 51\n\nVa. App. at 345, 657 S.E.2d at 800.\n\n              Our Supreme Court has defined \u201c\u2018unconsciousness\u2019 as a state of mind of persons of\n\nsound mind suffering from some voluntary or involuntary agency rendering them unaware of\n\ntheir acts.\u201d Riley v. Commonwealth, 277 Va. 467, 479, 675 S.E.2d 168, 175 (2009) (emphasis\n\nadded) (quoting Greenfield v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 710, 714, 204 S.E.2d 414, 417 (1974)).\n\nThe trial court here refused to admit evidence relating to appellant\u2019s unconsciousness defense\n\nbecause it found that the proposed evidence was essentially an effort to put on an insanity\n\ndefense without calling it such so as to show that appellant lacked the necessary mens rea \u2013 and\n\nthat appellant was, therefore, directly prohibited from doing so by Stamper.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n              10\n          We note that the Supreme Court in Riley v. Commonwealth, 277 Va. 467, 479 n.9, 675\nS.E.2d 168, 175 n.9 (2009) (emphasis added), simply \u201cassume[d], without deciding, that\nunconsciousness is a defense to criminal charges other than just homicide\u201d when it affirmed the\nconvictions for driving while intoxicated and maiming another person as a result of driving while\nintoxicated. The Supreme Court has not actually decided that unconsciousness is a defense to\ncriminal charges not involving homicide.\n                                              - 20 -\n\f              Even assuming without deciding that the trial court erred in excluding this evidence, any\n\nerror was harmless.11 Appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by essentially\n\nrendering the defense of unconsciousness unavailable to Schmuhl. As appellant raises a\n\nchallenge related to the admissibility of evidence, \u201c[w]e examine this claim under the standard\n\nfor non-constitutional harmless error.\u201d Salahuddin v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 190, 211-12,\n\n795 S.E.2d 472, 483 (2017); see Carter v.

Proffitt,\n\n292 Va. 626, 642, 792 S.E.2d 3, 11 (2016).\n\n       The record reflects that appellant was not unconscious during the attack. It shows he\n\nplanned and completed the home invasion with precision, clarity, and control. Appellant\n\nhandwrote a shopping list ahead of the attack with the items he needed: \u201chandcuffs, two bottles\n\nof Nyquil, two packs of Benadryl, adult diapers (male), two sleeping masks (if available).\u201d\n\nAppellant disguised himself, forced his way into the house, and attempted to maintain a fake\n\nidentity during the entire encounter. Testimony from Fisher and Duncan revealed that appellant\n\ndid not stumble and did not slur his words during the three hours that he was inside their home.\n\nHe questioned the couple extensively and demanded information about money that they might\n\nkeep in the house. He also looked through Fisher\u2019s work email \u2013 apparently not finding the\n\ninformation for which he searched. Appellant forced the victims to move from room to room\n\nthroughout the invasion, and he closed window blinds in the house. Appellant shot and stabbed\n\nDuncan, he tasered and stabbed Fisher, and he then kicked the already gravely wounded Fisher\n\nin the head as he left, telling him, \u201cYou\u2019re going to die.\u201d Evidence showed that appellant\n\nattempted to cover up his crimes by recovering the Taser cartridges and gun shell casings and\n\nthat he doused the foyer rug with gasoline before leaving the home. Appellant used a prepaid\n\nphone during the events rather than his personal cell phone, removed his bloody clothing prior to\n\narrest, and soaked the clothing in ammonia as he and his wife fled from the police. Fisher later\n\ndescribed appellant\u2019s demeanor during the events as \u201cvery forceful, authoritative. Very much in\n\ncontrol.\u201d In addition, testimony from arresting officers showed that appellant was alert when he\n\nwas first apprehended \u2013 and that any change in his level of consciousness took place after he was\n\nplaced into the police vehicle. Any possible error in not admitting expert evidence of his mental\n\n                                              - 22 -\n\fstate at the time of the offenses is simply insignificant in comparison with the overwhelming\n\nevidence of appellant\u2019s lucidity both before and during the events in question.12\n\n              In assignment of error IX, appellant argues that the trial court erred by limiting\n\nappellant\u2019s presentation of evidence in support of his proffered defenses of involuntary\n\nintoxication and unconsciousness. The trial court redacted medical records, limited appellant\u2019s\n\nexpert testimony to a discussion of toxicology rather than psychiatry, and would not allow\n\nappellant\u2019s expert to use certain words like \u201cdelirium,\u201d \u201cpsychosis,\u201d \u201cdissociation,\u201d and\n\n\u201cdelusions.\u201d Because appellant refused to plead insanity, the trial court did not err in preventing\n\nappellant from presenting expert testimony about his mental state. In addition, the trial court has\n\nbroad discretion in deciding what evidence is relevant and should be admitted at trial. Therefore,\n\nwe cannot find that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to limit the use of certain\n\nwords and to redact medical records because the trial court did so to prevent appellant from\n\npresenting expert evidence of his mental state without first making an insanity defense, as\n\nrequired by statute and by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Stamper. Furthermore, even assuming\n\nwithout deciding that it was error to exclude any such evidence related to appellant\u2019s\n\nunconsciousness defense, any error was harmless for the reasons we have stated above.\n\n                                      E.

However, given the extraordinary amount of\nfentanyl that appellant claims was on him at the time of the offenses (and the fact that the amount\nfar exceeded his prescribed dosage), the defense of unconsciousness would simply not be\navailable to appellant, even if he had been unconscious (which the evidence shows he was not),\nbecause any supposed unconsciousness would have been self-induced.\n                                               - 23 -\n\fCommonwealth, 24 Va.

App. 576, 582, 575 S.E.2d 567, 569 (2003)). \u201cIf\n\nthe principles set forth in a proposed instruction are fully and fairly covered in other instructions\n\nthat have been granted, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a repetitious\n\ninstruction.\u201d Joseph v. Commonwealth, 249 Va. 78, 90, 452 S.E.2d 862, 870 (1995).\n\n       In his last two assignments of error (assignments of error XI and XII), appellant claims\n\nthat the trial court erred by denying his requested jury instruction that defined and described\n\n\u201cunconsciousness\u201d and his jury instruction that defined \u201cintoxication.\u201d Appellant\u2019s proposed\n\ninstruction on unconsciousness stated:\n\n               Unconsciousness refers to a state where a subject physically acts in\n               fact but is not, at the time, conscious of acting. Unconsciousness\n               does not reach the physical dimensions commonly associated with\n               the term (coma, inertia, incapability of locomotion or manual\n               action, and so on) in order to represent a legal defense. If you find\n               that Mr. Schmuhl was physically acting but not conscious of his\n               acts at the time of the offense, you must find him not guilty.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 24 -\n\fAppellant argues that his defense of unconsciousness was not adequately addressed by the\n\ninstruction that the court gave on involuntary intoxication, and he claims that he offered more\n\nthan a \u201cscintilla of evidence\u201d to justify a separate unconsciousness instruction. See Gibson v.\n\nCommonwealth, 216 Va. 412, 417, 219 S.E.2d 845, 849 (1975) (stating that jury instructions\n\n\u201cmust be supported by more than a mere scintilla of evidence\u201d).\n\n       However, appellant\u2019s requested instruction on unconsciousness was an inaccurate\n\nstatement of the law. For example, it did not indicate that unconsciousness cannot be\n\nself-induced by voluntarily taking drugs or medication. See Riley, 277 Va. at 479, 675 S.E.2d at\n\n175. The instruction also failed to state that unconsciousness is caused by \u201csome voluntary or\n\ninvoluntary agency rendering [persons] unaware of their acts.\u201d Id. Therefore, the trial court did\n\nnot err in refusing appellant\u2019s requested jury instruction on unconsciousness because it was\n\ninaccurate.\n\n       Finally, appellant contends that the trial court erred when it refused his instruction that\n\nstated, \u201cLegal intoxication means a disturbance of mental or physical capacities resulting from\n\nthe introduction of substances into the body.\u201d The Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he phrase\n\n\u2018under the influence of intoxicants\u2019 is composed of words of ordinary significance and their\n\nmeaning is well known to the average juror, but in the absence of statute the phrase is not\n\nsusceptible of a definite, accurate definition acceptable to all.\u201d Gardner v. Commonwealth, 195\n\nVa. 945, 953, 81 S.E.2d 614, 619 (1954). There is neither a model jury instruction nor a statute\n\ndefining the word \u201cintoxication\u201d in the Commonwealth. Therefore, we cannot say that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion in refusing to give an instruction on the definition of \u201cintoxication\u201d\n\nand in instead permitting the parties to argue the meaning of \u201cintoxication\u201d before the jury.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 25 -\n\f                                          III. CONCLUSION\n\n       In short, the trial court did not err in excluding the evidence of appellant\u2019s mental state\n\npursuant to his involuntary intoxication defense or in circumscribing the manner in which\n\nappellant presented his evidence of the effects of the drugs he took. The Commonwealth\u2019s\n\ncommon law history as a M\u2019Naghten jurisdiction and the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Stamper\n\nprevent evidence of a defendant\u2019s mental state from being offered to negate mens rea for an\n\ninvoluntary intoxication defense, unless the defendant properly notifies the Court, as required by\n\nstatute, that his involuntary intoxication caused him to cross the legal threshold to insanity at the\n\ntime he committed the offense. Furthermore, it was not error for the trial court to find that\n\nappellant was actually offering an insanity defense, despite not following the required statutory\n\nprocedures for doing so under Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-168, 19.2-168.1, and 19.2-169.5 and despite\n\nappellant\u2019s protests to the contrary, when appellant intended to rely on expert evidence to show\n\nhis mental state at the time he committed the charged offenses. In addition, assuming without\n\ndeciding that it was error to exclude appellant\u2019s evidence of his mental state for his\n\nunconsciousness defense, any error was harmless given the overwhelming evidence of\n\nappellant\u2019s guilt and the overwhelming evidence that he was not unconscious when he\n\ncommitted these offenses. It was not error to exclude appellant\u2019s proposed jury instruction on\n\n\u201cunconsciousness\u201d because the instruction on unconsciousness was an inaccurate statement of\n\nthe law. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding appellant\u2019s proposed jury\n\ninstruction on the word \u201cintoxication\u201d (and in simply allowing both counsel to argue the meaning\n\nof the word before the jury) because \u201cintoxication\u201d is a word of common usage and there is\n\nneither a model jury instruction nor a statute defining the term.\n\n       For all of these reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions for two counts of abduction\n\nwith intent to gain pecuniary benefit, two counts of aggravated malicious wounding, two counts\n\n                                                - 26 -\n\fof using or displaying a firearm during the commission of an aggravated malicious wounding,\n\nand burglary while armed with a deadly weapon.\n\n                                                                                    Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 27 -\n\f",
