Naya advised that\r\nshe was neither physically nor financially able to care for the child.\u00a0 Having determined that McFarland had no\r\nrelatives who were equipped to care for the child, the Department was unable to\r\nplace K.J.T.M. in the care of a relative.[11]\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nDepartment\u2019s preparation and administration of a service plan, in conjunction\r\nwith its consideration of all relative placements, demonstrate that the trial\r\ncourt did not err in finding that the Department made reasonable efforts to\r\nreturn the child to McFarland.[12]\u00a0 \r\n\r\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The\r\nfailure to regularly visit or maintain significant contact with the child \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 McFarland\r\ncontends that he was continually confined since September 1, 2008, and the\r\nState did not allege incarceration as a ground for termination.\u00a0 Consequently, McFarland contends that the\r\nState was obliged to abide by Department policy outlined in Section 6422 of the\r\nDepartment of Family and Protective Services handbook, which requires the\r\nDepartment to attempt to communicate with the incarcerated parent through\r\nface-to-face visits, telephone calls, or written correspondence.\u00a0 McFarland claims that this policy was not\r\nfollowed, thus thwarting his ability to maintain contact with the child. \u00a0In conjunction with this point, McFarland\r\ncontends that because he was not given a telephone number to call or an address\r\nto write anyone at the Department, he could not maintain contact with the\r\nchild. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This\r\ncontention is factually incorrect, based upon the record before us.\u00a0 As discussed previously in this opinion,\r\nMcFarland\u2019s service plan contained the name, address, and telephone number of\r\nhis caseworker. \u00a0Moreover, the evidence\r\nbefore this Court establishes that Nehls developed a service plan for McFarland\r\nand made face-to-face contact with him.\u00a0\r\nMcFarland was provided with an outline of services that he could use to\r\nlearn and demonstrate parenting skills.\u00a0 Further,\r\nMcFarland was present at the adversary hearing where he could have clarified\r\nany questions regarding maintaining contact with the child.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Roberson\r\ntestified that McFarland did not (1) make an effort to be a part of the child\u2019s\r\nlife, (2) check on her, or (3) send her letters, even when he was aware the\r\nchild was in the Department\u2019s care.\u00a0 See In re K.F.K., No. 04-08-00186-CV,\r\n2009 WL 2767043 (Tex.

Fam. Code Ann. \u00a7\r\n161.001(1)(D).\u00a0 McFarland contends the\r\nevidence was legally and factually insufficient to support termination on this\r\nbasis as well.\u00a0 The State appears to\r\nconcede this issue, as it did not respond to this issue in its brief.\u00a0 Because we determine the evidence to be\r\nlegally and factually sufficient to support termination in accordance with\r\nSection 161.001(1)(N) of the Texas Family Code, in conjunction with the trial\r\ncourt\u2019s uncontested finding that termination is in the best interest of the\r\nchild, we do not address the sufficiency of the evidence to support termination\r\npursuant to Section 161.001(1)(D) of the Texas Family Code.\u00a0 Tex.\r\nFam.

Nehls also acknowledged having gone over the service plan with\r\nMcFarland on the morning of February 25, 2009, prior to the commencement of the\r\nreview hearing.\u00a0 On this date, there was\r\nalso an extended discussion on the record regarding the items included in the\r\nservice plan and compliance with the plan while McFarland was in juvenile\r\ndetention.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[8]McFarland\r\nwas also offered services in May 2009 and he participated in life skills and\r\nanger management programs that were available at the juvenile detention\r\ncenter.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[9]McFarland\u2019s\r\nlack of concern regarding K.J.T.M.\u2019s care is reflected in the following\r\nstatement in which he placed the burden of K.J.T.M.\u2019s care on the Department:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThey\r\nnot -- they probably taking care of [K.J.T.M.], but they ain\u2019t doing it for me,\r\nthey doing it for -- \u2018cause it\u2019s they [sic] job, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u00a0 It ain\u2019t for me.\u00a0 If they was [sic] doing it for me, that\u2019s\r\nlike my mama or my people taking care of her, then that would be taking care of\r\nher for me.\u00a0 But that\u2019s they [sic] job,\r\nyou know what I\u2019m saying?\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[10]One\r\nof McFarland\u2019s sisters was involved in a plot to rob an individual named\r\nMontague Stoker, and was present in his home when Stoker was shot and\r\nkilled.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[11]The\r\nDepartment was likewise unable to place the child in the care of O\u2019Neal\u2019s\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[12]The\r\nconcept of a \u201creasonable effort\u201d to return the child is effectively a sliding\r\nscale, depending on the situation.\u00a0 Here,\r\nthere is evidence to support a finding that the State made a reasonable effort\r\nto return the child by attempting services which could have led to a change in\r\nMcFarland\u2019s attitude and behavior.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[13]McFarland\r\ndoes not contest the first and third elements of constructive abandonment,\r\ni.e., that the Department had temporary managing conservatorship of K.J.T.M.\r\nfor at least six months and that he has demonstrated an inability to provide\r\nthe child with a safe environment. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[14]William\r\nShakespeare, Macbeth, Act V, Scene V.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[15]An\r\nappellate court reviewing a termination of parental rights on the State\u2019s petition\r\n\u201cmay not consider any issue that was not specifically presented to the trial\r\ncourt in a timely filed statement of the points on which the party intends to\r\nappeal . . . .\u201d\u00a0 Tex.
