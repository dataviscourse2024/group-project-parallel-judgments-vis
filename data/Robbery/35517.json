Forchione, Assistant Prosecuting\n                 Attorney, for appellee.\n\n                 Larry Stewart, pro se.\n\n\nEMANUELLA D. GROVES, J.:\n\n                   Larry Stewart appeals the issuance of a nunc pro tunc sentencing\n\nentry, in which the trial court altered the phrasing of the 25-year-old sentence on an\n\naggravated murder count to read: \u201c[d]efendant sentenced to Lorain Correctional\n\nInstitution for life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving 30-full years of\n\fimprisonment.\u201d Stewart claims that the trial court erred by imposing the sentence\n\nas stated, instead of imposing \u201c30-years to life.\u201d For the following reasons, we\n\naffirm.\n\n              Stewart was originally sentenced to prison for \u201c30-years to life\u201d for\n\naggravated murder with capital and firearm specifications in 1997. The conviction\n\nstemmed from a home invasion robbery resulting in the murder of one victim, and\n\nthe shooting of another, among other crimes, and sentences to be consecutively\n\nserved. State v. Stewart, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 73255, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS\n\n5462 (Nov. 19, 1998). Since that time, he has filed several postconviction motions\n\nand appeals culminating in State v. Stewart, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 109498, 2020-\n\nOhio-6743 (\u201cStewart\u201d), in which Stewart challenged the legal validity of the\n\nsentence imposed by the trial court. Id. at \u00b6 2-3. In that appeal, Stewart claimed\n\nthat the imposed sentence of \u201c30-years to life\u201d was contrary to law because R.C.\n\n2929.03(D)(2), under which Stewart was sentenced, required the sentence to be \u201clife\n\nimprisonment with parole eligibility after serving thirty full years of imprisonment.\u201d\n\nId. at \u00b6 3.\n\n              Under R.C. 2929.03(D)(2), as deemed applicable by the Ohio\n\nSupreme Court in a writ of mandamus Stewart filed challenging the validity of his\n\nsentence in the underlying case, the legislature codified the procedure through\n\nwhich a jury recommends a sentence in a capital case. State ex rel. Stewart v. Russo,\n\n145 Ohio St.3d 382, 2016-Ohio-421, 49 N.E.3d 1272, \u00b6 12 (noting that the language\n\nof R.C. 2929.03(D)(2) had not been changed since the time of Stewart\u2019s original\n\fconviction). R.C. 2929.03(D)(2) provides that if the trial jury recommends that the\n\noffender be sentenced to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving 30-\n\nfull years of imprisonment, then \u201c\u2018the court shall impose the sentence recommended\n\nby the jury upon the offender.\u2019\u201d Id.1 The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed this court\u2019s\n\ndecision denying Stewart\u2019s writ of mandamus seeking to invalidate the imposed\n\nsentence. Id. at \u00b6 20.\n\n               Following the denial of relief through the writ of mandamus, Stewart\n\nagain challenged his sentence with the trial court and through a subsequent appeal,\n\nclaiming the sentence to be void. The Stewart panel overruled the arguments\n\npresented, concluding that the recent decisions in State v. Henderson, 161 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 285, 2020-Ohio-4784, 162 N.E.3d 776, \u00b6 1, and State v. Harper, 160 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 480, 2020-Ohio-2913, 159 N.E.3d 248, \u00b6 4, precluded Stewart from\n\nchallenging the validity of his sentence decades after the fact of conviction. Id. at\n\n\u00b6 7. Nonetheless, the panel noted that Stewart had conceded that the proper\n\nsentence had been announced at his sentencing hearing, suggesting that the trial\n\ncourt possessed continuing jurisdiction to issue a nunc pro tunc sentencing entry to\n\nlet the record reflect that which occurred. Id. at \u00b6 7, fn. 1, citing State v. Qualls, 131\n\n\n\n\n       1  Under R.C. 2929.03(D)(2)(a), if the jury is unable to determine that the\naggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors with respect to the capital\nspecification, the jury shall, in pertinent part, recommend that the offender be sentenced\nto \u201cto life imprisonment without parole, life imprisonment with parole eligibility after\nserving twenty-five full years of imprisonment, or life imprisonment with parole eligibility\nafter serving thirty full years of imprisonment.\u201d Of the three authorized sentences in this\nparticular case, the jury chose the latter, Russo at \u00b6 12.\n\fOhio St.3d 499, 2012-Ohio-1111, 967 N.E.2d 718, \u00b6 15 and State v. Sandidge, 8th\n\nDist. Cuyahoga No. 109277, 2020-Ohio-1629.\n\n                Stewart accepted the panel\u2019s invitation and filed a motion to correct\n\nthe sentencing entry expressly through the nunc pro tunc mechanism. In April 2021,\n\nthe trial court issued the disputed nunc pro tunc entry upon Stewart\u2019s request,\n\namending in pertinent part the sentence imposed on the aggravated murder count\n\nfrom \u201ca sentence of 30-years to life,\u201d to \u201clife imprisonment with parole eligibility\n\nafter serving 30-full years of imprisonment\u201d; the relief Stewart had originally\n\nrequested in Stewart and the sentence expressly required under R.C.\n\n2929.03(D)(2)(a).\n\n                Stewart now appeals the issuance of the nunc pro tunc entry, claiming\n\nthat the entry violated his rights under Crim.R. 43 by modifying his sentence outside\n\nof his presence and that the use of the nunc pro tunc mechanism to substantively\n\nalter his prison sentence was beyond the ambit of a clerical error because the court\n\nimposed a sentence of \u201c30-full years\u201d instead of \u201c30-years to life.\u201d2 Beyond the fact\n\nthat Stewart is now requesting the very sentence he sought to vacate in Stewart, we\n\nneed not address the merits of Stewart\u2019s latest arguments. At the least, Stewart\n\n\n\n       2 In State ex rel. Newell v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, 165 Ohio St.3d\n341, 2021-Ohio-3662, 179 N.E.3d 84, \u00b6 16, relying on State ex rel. Davis v. Janas, 160\nOhio St.3d 187, 2020-Ohio-1462, 155 N.E.3d 822, \u00b6 8, the Ohio Supreme Court reiterated\nthe difference between a sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility after 20 years and\nlife in prison with parole eligibility after 20 full years as being the offender\u2019s ability to\nreduce the minimum term through earning certain credits on the former sentence. Since\nR.C. 2929.03(D)(2)(a) required the trial court to impose 30 full years in this particular\ncase, we needed not revisit this distinction.\n\finvited the error upon which his arguments are based by requesting that the trial\n\ncourt issue a nunc pro tunc entry to reflect the correct sentence under R.C.\n\n2929.03(D)(2). Regardless, and more important, the trial court\u2019s nunc pro tunc\n\nsentencing entry is authorized by law.\n\n              The invited-error doctrine provides that a litigant may not \u201c\u2018take\n\nadvantage of an error which he himself invited or induced.\u2019\u201d State v. Grate, 164\n\nOhio St.3d 9, 2020-Ohio-5584, 172 N.E.3d 8, \u00b6 197, quoting Hal Artz Lincoln-\n\nMercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., Lincoln-Mercury Div., 28 Ohio St.3d 20, 502\n\nN.E.2d 590 (1986), paragraph one of the syllabus. The Ohio Supreme Court has\n\nlong \u201c\u2018found invited error when a party has asked the court to take some action later\n\nclaimed to be erroneous, or affirmatively consented to a procedure the trial judge\n\nproposed.\u2019\u201d State v. Ford, 158 Ohio St.3d 139, 2019-Ohio-4539, 140 N.E.3d 616,\n\n\u00b6 279, quoting State v. Campbell, 90 Ohio St. 3d 320, 324, 738 N.E.2d 1178 (2000).\n\n              In this case, even if we took the extraordinary step of presuming that\n\nthe trial court erred by issuing the nunc pro tunc entry and by imposing an incorrect\n\nsentence, Stewart received the specific relief he requested, through the mechanism\n\nof his choosing. No reversible error on either point can arise therefrom.\n\n              Moreover, and as already alluded to, the trial court\u2019s imposition of the\n\n\u201clife imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving 30 full years of\n\nimprisonment\u201d sentence upon the aggravated murder count is legally correct,\n\nparroting the legislature\u2019s phrasing from R.C. 2929.03(D)(2)(a) \u2014 the sentencing\n\nprovision deemed applicable in Russo, 145 Ohio St.3d 382, 2016-Ohio-421, 49\n\fN.E.3d 1272, at \u00b6 12. Even if we ignored the fact that the court\u2019s action was at\n\nStewart\u2019s express request, the modification of the sentence was legally correct since\n\nthe trial court orally announced that sentence at the final sentencing hearing back\n\nin 1997. Stewart, citing Qualls, 131 Ohio St.3d 499, 2012-Ohio-1111, 967 N.E.2d 718,\n\nat \u00b6 15, and Sandidge, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 109277, 2020-Ohio-1629. Any other\n\nerrors under Crim.R. 43 in the process of reaching this correct result, would\n\ntherefore, be harmless. State v. Williams, 6 Ohio St.3d 281, 287, 452 N.E.2d 1323\n\n(1983), citing Crim.R. 52(A) (defendant\u2019s lack of attendance at the trial proceeding\n\nas required under Crim.R. 43(A) was harmless error as defined under Crim.R. 52(A)\n\nbased on the lack of prejudice).\n\n              Stewart\u2019s assignments of error are overruled, and the final entry of\n\nconviction as it stands through the nunc pro tunc entry is affirmed.\n\n      It is ordered that appellee recover from appellant costs herein taxed.\n\n      The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n      It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the\n\ncommon pleas court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\n      A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27\n\nof the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n_________________________\nEMANUELLA D.
