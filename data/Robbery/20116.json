------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA jury convicted Appellant Raed Saif of theft of\r\nstolen property, and the trial court sentenced him to 360 days=\r\nconfinement in county jail, probated for 360 days.\u00a0 The court also assessed a fine of $500 that\r\nwas not probated.\u00a0 Appellant brings three\r\npoints on appeal, challenging the legal sufficiency of the evidence and the\r\njury charge.\u00a0 Because we hold that the evidence\r\nis legally sufficient to support the jury=s\r\nverdict and that the trial court did not err in charging the jury on the law of\r\nparties, we affirm the trial court=s\r\njudgment.\u00a0\u00a0 Officer Jesus Banda drove\r\nJoselyn Douglas, an undercover customs informant with the United States Customs\r\nService and the Fort Worth Police Department, to a Fina store.\u00a0 Her instructions were to sell thirty-six\r\nboxes of Accu-Chek glucose testing strips (used by diabetics) to someone inside\r\nthe store and to represent to that person that the strips were stolen.\u00a0 Inside the store, Douglas spoke with Raul\r\nAbdul Douglas, who was not related to her, and offered to sell him stolen\r\ntesting strips.\u00a0 Raul Abdul Douglas told\r\nJoselyn that he had no money, but, according to Joselyn, Acalled\r\nthis dude that was gonna bring the rest of the money.@\u00a0 He made the phone call, but Joselyn could not\r\nunderstand what he said during the telephone conversation because he spoke in a\r\nforeign language.\u00a0 Shortly after the\r\ncall, Joselyn left the store and returned to the truck that she had arrived in,\r\nwhere Banda was waiting.\u00a0 After waiting\r\ntwo or three hours, Joselyn saw Appellant drive up and enter the store.\u00a0 Joselyn followed him inside the store.\u00a0 She told Appellant about the strips and\r\ndiscussed payment, but she did not represent to him that the strips were\r\nstolen.\u00a0 Appellant and Joselyn negotiated\r\nthe price of the strips, and he gave her $472.\u00a0\r\nShe left the store with the money and left the strips with\r\nAppellant.\u00a0 She noted that because two of\r\nthe boxes were damaged, Appellant either did not pay for those boxes or paid a\r\nreduced price.\u00a0 A customs agent testified\r\nthat the average retail price of the thirty-six boxes of strips was $2736.\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that the evidence is legally\r\ninsufficient to support his conviction because the jury was instructed that he\r\ncould be convicted only as a party, while the evidence shows that if he was\r\nguilty, he was guilty only as the primary actor.\u00a0 He also points out that, because he was the\r\nprimary actor, the law required that representations that the property was\r\nstolen be made to him, not to Raul Abdul Douglas.\r\n\r\nA person is criminally responsible as a party to\r\nan offense if the offense is committed by his own conduct, by the conduct of\r\nanother for which he is criminally responsible, or both.[2]\u00a0 A person is criminally responsible for an\r\noffense committed by the conduct of another if, acting with intent to promote\r\nor assist the commission of the offense, he solicits, encourages, directs,\r\naids, or attempts to aid the other person to commit the offense.[3]\u00a0 The law of parties need not be pled in the\r\nindictment.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn determining whether a defendant is a party,\r\nthe trial court may look to events before, during, and after the commission of\r\nthe crime.[5]\u00a0 The reviewing court may rely on acts by the\r\ndefendant showing an understanding and common design.[6]\u00a0 The court may also rely on circumstantial\r\nevidence.[7]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The record reflects that Joselyn was not\r\ndressed as a pharmaceutical sales representative, nor did she act like\r\none.\u00a0 She was carrying the diabetic test\r\nstrips in a trash bag and offered to sell them out of the trash bag.\u00a0 She informed Raul Abdul Douglas that she had\r\nstolen the strips, and he immediately made a telephone call in which he told\r\nsomeone to bring the money.\u00a0 When\r\nAppellant arrived, he negotiated the sale with Joselyn, paid her in cash, and\r\ndid not ask for a receipt.\u00a0 He paid her\r\n$472 for $2736 worth of property.\u00a0\r\nApplying the proper standard of review,[8]\r\nwe hold that the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury=s\r\nverdict that Appellant is guilty as a party.\u00a0\r\nWe overrule Appellant=s first\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nIn his second and third points, Appellant argues\r\nthat the trial court erred in charging the jury on the law of parties because\r\nthe charge was not supported by the evidence and because the trial court\r\nimproperly applied the law of parties to the facts in this case.\r\n\r\nThe trial court instructed the jury,\r\n\r\n[I]f you believe from the evidence beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt that on or about the 27th day of February, 2003, in Tarrant\r\nCounty, Texas that Abdul Douglas did then and there unlawfully appropriate\r\nproperty, by acquiring or otherwise exercising control over property, to\r\nwit:\u00a0 thirty-six boxes of Accucheck\r\nGlucose Testing Strips, of the value of $1,500 or more but less than $20,000\r\nfrom Joselyn Douglas, an undercover operative acting as a law enforcement agent\r\nof the Fort Worth Police Department, which was the owner of the property by\r\nvirtue of the agency=s custody of the property, and\r\nthe said Joselyn Douglas explicitly represented to said Abdul Douglas that said\r\nproperty was stolen, and said Abdul Douglas appropriated said property\r\nbelieving it was stolen by another and said appropriation was with intent to\r\ndeprive said owner of said property, and acting with the intent to promote or\r\nassist the commission of the theft, the defendant, Raed Saif, solicited,\r\nencouraged, directed, aided, or attempted to aid Abdul Douglas to commit the\r\noffense of theft, then you will find the defendant guilty of the offense of\r\ntheft of thirty-six boxes of Accucheck Glucose Testing Strips as charged in the\r\nindictment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant asked the trial court to instruct the\r\njury that to find Appellant guilty, they had to find that he was explicitly\r\ninformed that the property was stolen.\u00a0\r\nThe law is well established that the State is required to show that\r\nAppellant acted with intent to assist in the commission of the offense of theft\r\nof stolen property, but the State is not required to show that he committed\r\nevery element of the offense himself.[9]\u00a0 Consequently, the trial court properly\r\nrefused to instruct the jury contrary to the law.\r\n\r\nIt is undisputed that the explicit representation\r\nwas made to Raul Abdul Douglas.\u00a0 The\r\nevidence, as detailed above, is sufficient to support the charge. We therefore\r\nhold that the trial court properly charged the jury on the law of parties and\r\nproperly applied the law to the facts of this case.\u00a0 We overrule Appellant=s second\r\nand third points.\r\n\r\nHaving overruled Appellant=s three\r\npoints, we affirm the trial court=s\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLEE\r\nANN DAUPHINOT\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n\r\nPANEL B:\u00a0\u00a0 DAUPHINOT, GARDNER, and MCCOY, JJ.\r\n\r\nDO NOT PUBLISH\r\n\r\nTex.\r\nR.
