Appellant challenges the legality of\n\nhis restitution sentence, and also argues that the court imposed an amount\n\nof restitution that is not supported by the record. After careful review, we\n\nvacate Appellant\u2019s sentence, in its entirety, and remand for resentencing.\n\n        The facts underlying Appellant\u2019s conviction are unnecessary to the\n\ndisposition of this appeal.       However, we briefly summarize the procedural\n\nhistory of his case as follows. Appellant was charged with theft by deception\n\n(18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3922(a)(1)), deceptive or fraudulent business practices (18\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n*\n    Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-S05009-16\n\n\n\nPa.C.S. \u00a7 4107(A)(2)), and home improvement fraud (18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n\n517.8(a)(3)).   After a jury trial in November of 2014, Appellant was\n\nacquitted of the first two charges, but found guilty of home improvement\n\nfraud. For purposes of grading that offense, the jury determined the amount\n\ninvolved was $2,000 or less. See 73 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 517.8(c)(2)(ii) (\u201cA violation\n\nof subsection (a)(2) constitutes: \u2026 (ii) a misdemeanor of the first degree if\n\nthe amount of the payment retained is $2,000 or less\u2026.\u201d).\n\n     On January 9, 2015, Appellant was sentenced to a term of 18 months\u2019\n\nprobation. No amount of restitution was imposed on that date; instead, the\n\nJanuary 9, 2015 sentencing order stated, \u201cRestitution hearing scheduled\n\nfor[] January 28, 2015.\u201d    On January 28, 2015, the court conducted a\n\nhearing and ultimately imposed restitution in the amount of $41,637. The\n\ncourt did not state, at any point during the January 28 th proceeding, that\n\nrestitution was a condition of Appellant\u2019s probation.     We also ascertain\n\nnothing in the record that would support such a conclusion.        Thus, we\n\nconsider Appellant\u2019s restitution as a direct sentence. See Commonwealth\n\nv. Deshong, 850 A.2d 712, 715 (Pa. Super. 2004) (concluding that\n\nrestitution was a direct sentence where it was not mentioned in the portion\n\nof the sentencing order outlining the conditions of probation, and \u201cthe judge\n\ndid not say the restitution was a condition of probation\u201d but, instead, the\n\ncourt \u201csimply ordered Deshong to pay it\u201d).\n\n     Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on February 4, 2015, and\n\ntimely complied with the court\u2019s order to file a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise\n\n                                    -2-\n\fJ-S05009-16\n\n\n\nstatement of errors complained of on appeal.         Herein, Appellant presents\n\ntwo issues for our review:\n\n      I. Whether the \u2026 trial court erred when it ordered [Appellant] to\n      pay restitution in the amount of $41,637.00 because that\n      amount is not supported by the record or [the] jury\u2019s verdict and\n      exceeds the scope of the crime [for which] [Appellant] was found\n      guilty []?\n\n      II. Whether the \u2026 trial court was without jurisdiction to order\n      [Appellant] to pay restitution at the hearing on January 28,\n      2015, because the \u2026 trial court did not impose a specific amount\n      of restitution at the sentencing hearing on January 9, 2015,\n      when [Appellant] was sentenced to 18 months[\u2019] probation?\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 4.\n\n      Both of Appellant\u2019s issues challenge his sentence of restitution.      The\n\nimposition of restitution is governed by 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106, which states, in\n\npertinent part:\n\n      (a) General rule.--Upon conviction for any crime wherein\n      property has been stolen, converted or otherwise unlawfully\n      obtained, or its value substantially decreased as a direct result of\n      the crime, or wherein the victim suffered personal injury directly\n      resulting from the crime, the offender shall be sentenced to\n      make restitution in addition to the punishment prescribed\n      therefor.\n\n      \u2026\n\n       (c) Mandatory restitution.--\n\n          \u2026\n\n          (2) At the time of sentencing the court shall specify the\n          amount and method of restitution. In determining the\n          amount and method of restitution, the court:\n\n              (i) Shall consider the extent of injury suffered by the\n              victim, the victim's request for restitution as\n              presented to the district attorney in accordance with\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fJ-S05009-16\n\n\n            paragraph (4) and such other matters as it deems\n            appropriate.\n\n            (ii) May order restitution in a lump sum, by monthly\n            installments or according to such other schedule as it\n            deems just.\n\n            (iii) Shall not order incarceration of a defendant for\n            failure to pay restitution if the failure results from\n            the offender's inability to pay.\n\n            (iv) Shall consider any other preexisting orders\n            imposed on the defendant, including, but not limited\n            to, orders imposed under this title or any other title.\n\n       (3) The court may, at any time or upon the recommendation of\n       the district attorney that is based on information received from\n       the victim and the probation section of the county or other agent\n       designated by the county commissioners of the county with the\n       approval of the president judge to collect restitution, alter or\n       amend any order of restitution made pursuant to paragraph (2),\n       provided, however, that the court states its reasons and\n       conclusions as a matter of record for any change or amendment\n       to any previous order.\n\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106(a), (c).\n\n       For ease of disposition, we will begin by addressing Appellant\u2019s second\n\nissue. Essentially, Appellant avers that his restitution sentence is illegal, as\n\nit was not imposed at the sentencing hearing on January 9, 2015. Appellant\n\nmaintains that \u201cthe trial court did not comply with the plain text\u201d of section\n\n1106(c)(2) because the court \u201cdid not order [] Appellant to pay a specific\n\namount of restitution at sentencing, but rather, the amount was to be\n\ndetermined at a later hearing.\u201d      Appellant\u2019s Brief at 11.     According to\n\nAppellant, the court\u2019s belated imposition of restitution renders that sentence\n\nillegal.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fJ-S05009-16\n\n\n\n      We are compelled to agree based on the plain language of section\n\n1106(c)(2), as well as two decisions by our Court, Commonwealth v.\n\nDinoia, 801 A.2d 1254 (Pa. Super. 2002), and Commonwealth v.\n\nMariani, 869 A.2d 484 (Pa. Super. 2005).        In Dinoia, the appellant was\n\nsentenced to imprisonment, a consecutive term of probation, and an \u201copen\u201d\n\namount of restitution.    Id. at 1255.     Eighteen months later, the court\n\nimposed a specific sum of restitution.       Id.    This Court held that the\n\nappellant\u2019s sentence of restitution was illegal, reasoning:\n\n      [I]f restitution is ordered, the amount must be determined at the\n      time of sentencing, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1106(c)(2). [Section 1106]\n      also placed upon the Commonwealth the requirement that it\n      provide the court with its recommendation of the restitution\n      amount at or prior to the time of sentencing. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\n      1106(c)(4). Although the statute provides for amendment or\n      modification of restitution \u201cat any time,\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\n      1106(c)(3), the modification refers to an order \u201cmade pursuant\n      to paragraph (2) ...\u201d Id. Thus, the statute mandates an\n      initial determination of the amount of restitution at\n      sentencing. This provides the defendant with certainty as\n      to his sentence, and at the same time allows for\n      subsequent modification, if necessary. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\n      1106(c)(3); cf. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5505 (\u201cExcept as otherwise\n      provided or proscribed by law, a court upon notice to the parties\n      may modify or rescind any order within 30 days after its entry,\n      notwithstanding the prior termination of any term of court, if no\n      appeal from such order has been taken or allowed.\u201d).\n\nId. at 1257 (italicized emphasis in original; bolded emphasis added).\n\n      After Dinoia, our Court in Mariani held that a sentence of restitution\n\nwas illegal under circumstances very similar to the present case.       There,\n\nMariani was convicted of several offenses, including driving under the\n\ninfluence of alcohol. Id. at 485. At the sentencing hearing, \u201c[t]he trial court\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJ-S05009-16\n\n\n\nentered the term of imprisonment,\u201d but \u201c[t]hereafter \u2026 directed, without\n\nobjection, that the final restitution amount would be determined at a\n\nseparate hearing.\u201d       Id.   Five months later, a restitution hearing was\n\nconducted and an amount was imposed, despite Mariani\u2019s objection \u201con the\n\nbasis that any sentence of restitution imposed after the sentencing hearing\n\nwas a priori illegal under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1106(c)(2), and violative of her due\n\nprocess rights.\u201d   Id.    On appeal, Mariani reiterated her challenge to the\n\nlegality of the court\u2019s belated imposition of restitution, and we agreed with\n\nher argument, stating:\n\n      18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1106(c)(2) provides that \u201c[a]t the time of\n      sentencing, the court shall specify the amount and method of\n      restitution.\u201d This Court has held that both imprisonment and\n      restitution elements of a judgment of sentence must be\n      imposed at the same proceeding in order to safeguard the\n      defendant's due process rights. Commonwealth v. Ortiz, 854\n      A.2d 1280 (Pa. Super. 2004) (en banc); [] Dinoia, 801 A.2d [at]\n      1256 []. [Mariani] argues that as a result of the hiatus between\n      the proceedings held here, the ordered restitution was rendered\n      illegal. \u2026 Despite the trial court's deliberate attempt to assure\n      that [Mariani\u2019s] rights were protected by holding a separate\n      hearing, we are constrained by governing authority to agree with\n      [Mariani] that the sentence was illegal.\n\nId. at 485-86.\n\n      Here, as in Mariani, the trial court made no determination regarding\n\nthe amount of restitution at the sentencing hearing but, instead, conducted\n\na separate hearing before imposing restitution at a later date.           We\n\nacknowledge that unlike in Mariani, the court\u2019s imposition of restitution on\n\nJanuary 28, 2015, was within the thirty-day time period in which the court\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fJ-S05009-16\n\n\n\nhad jurisdiction to modify its sentencing order.     See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5505.\n\nHowever, Dinoia makes clear that modification of restitution under section\n\n1106(c)(3) is only permitted where an initial restitution determination is\n\nmade at the sentencing hearing in accordance with section 1106(c)(2).\n\nBecause here, no specific amount of restitution was ordered at the January\n\n9, 2015 sentencing proceeding, the court could not add a sentence of\n\nrestitution on January 28, 2015.\n\n     Accordingly, we are compelled to conclude that the court\u2019s imposition\n\nof $41,637 in restitution on January 28, 2015, was illegal under the plain\n\nlanguage of section 1106(c)(2) and this Court\u2019s holdings in Dinoia and\n\nMariani.     We further conclude that pursuant to Mariani, the appropriate\n\nrelief is to vacate Appellant\u2019s sentence, as a whole, and remand for\n\nresentencing.    After striking down Mariani\u2019s restitution sentence as illegal,\n\nwe stated:\n\n     [R]estitution was an integral part of the sentencing scheme\n     fashioned by the trial court and acknowledged by [Mariani], who\n     expressly asserted her willingness to provide it. In this context\n     it must be remembered that \u201cthe primary purpose of restitution\n     is rehabilitation of the offender by impressing upon him that his\n     criminal conduct caused the victim's loss or personal injury and\n     that it is his responsibility to repair the loss or injury as far as\n     possible.\u201d Commonwealth v. Runion, \u2026 662 A.2d 617, 618\n     ([Pa.] 1995). Thus recompense to the victim is secondary, as\n     \u201c[a] sentence imposing restitution is not an award of damages.\u201d\n     Commonwealth v. Wright, 722 A.2d 157, 160 (Pa. Super.\n     1998).\n\nMariani, 869 A.2d at 486.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fJ-S05009-16\n\n\n\n      Presently, Appellant did not express a willingness to pay restitution at\n\nthe sentencing hearing on January 9, 2015. However, it is apparent from\n\nthe record that the imposition of restitution was an integral part of the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s sentencing scheme, and Appellant was aware of that fact based on\n\nthe court\u2019s scheduling a restitution hearing.   Accordingly, in line with our\n\ndecision in Mariani, we vacate Appellant\u2019s sentence in its entirety and\n\nremand for resentencing. Because of our decision, we need not address the\n\nmerits of Appellant\u2019s first issue.\n\n      Judgment of sentence vacated.        Case remanded for resentencing.\n\nJurisdiction relinquished.\n\n      Judge Shogan files a concurring statement in which President Judge\n\nEmeritus Bender and Judge Platt join.\n\n      Judge Platt concurs in the result of this memorandum.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
