Criminal Information, 3/26/15, at 1\u20132.             Responding police\n\nofficers promptly      took Monroe        into   custody, where    he   admitted to\n\nparticipating in the burglary with Appellant and identified a third person\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n*\n    Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-S42012-16\n\n\nwaiting in a silver car who fled the scene.      Affidavit of Probable Cause,\n\n1/30/15, at 1.\n\n       Appellant was subsequently arrested and charged with burglary,\n\nrobbery, criminal trespass, and simple assault.         Criminal Information,\n\n3/26/15, at 1\u20132.           Appellant pled guilty to robbery, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n\n3701(a)(1)(V), and, in exchange, the Commonwealth nolle prossed all other\n\ncharges. N.T. Plea, 5/4/15, at 8\u201310. The trial court sentenced Appellant to\n\nincarceration for an aggregate period of twenty-four to forty-eight months,\n\nfollowed by two years of probation, and $1,715.02 in restitution.          N.T.\n\nSentencing, 6/23/15, at 30. Appellant filed a timely post-sentence motion,\n\nwhich the trial court denied on July 21, 2015.          This appeal followed.\n\nAppellant and the trial court have complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.\n\n       Appellant raises the following questions for our consideration:\n\n       A.   Whether the Sentencing Court erred in sentencing the\n            Appellant with a Prior Record Score of a Repeat Felony\n            Offender instead of with a Prior Record Score of five (5)[?]\n\n       B.   Whether the [A]ppellant\u2019s sentence is manifestly excessive,\n            clearly unreasonable and inconsistent with the objectives of\n            the Sentencing Code?\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 3.1\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1\n   In his Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement of errors complained of on appeal,\nAppellant challenged the imposition of restitution.   Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)\nStatement, 8/24/15, at \u00b6 B(b). Appellant has not raised this issue on\nappeal. Therefore, we deem it abandoned.\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-S42012-16\n\n\n       In his first issue, Appellant raises a question of statutory construction\n\nof the sentencing guidelines under 204 Pa.Code \u00a7 303.4.                       According to\n\nAppellant, the sentencing court erred in applying the sentencing guidelines\n\nto set Appellant\u2019s prior record score at repeat felony offender, RFEL, and not\n\nat five.    Appellant\u2019s Brief at 6.     This is a question of law and \u201c[t]hus, our\n\nstandard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Wilson, 101 A.3d 1151, 1153 (Pa. Super. 2014)\n\n(italicization and citation omitted). \u201cConsequently, we are not bound by the\n\nlower court\u2019s conclusions regarding the proper meaning of the applicable\n\nprovisions of this statute.\u201d Commonwealth v. Devries, 112 A.3d 663, 670\n\n(Pa. Super. 2015) (citation omitted).\n\n       In   addressing     this   issue,   we     direct     the   parties\u2019   attention   to\n\nCommonwealth v. Stefon Johnson, 125 A.3d 822 (Pa. Super. 2015).\n\nTherein, a panel of this Court affirmed an Erie County sentencing order\n\nunder circumstances strikingly similar to those at hand.2 As does Appellant,\n\nStefon Johnson contended \u201cthat the language of subsection 303.4(a)(2)\n\nrequires six prior convictions or adjudications, rather than six points, to\n\ndesignate an offender as a RFEL.\u201d              Id. at 828.    The panel \u201cagree[d] with\n\nJohnson that it is unclear from the statute\u2019s language alone whether the\n\nnumber six refers to prior convictions or prior record score points.\u201d Id. at\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2\n  The public defender representing Appellant in this appeal also represented\nStefon Johnson in his appeal.\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-S42012-16\n\n\n829.    Therefore, the panel consulted the Statutory Construction Act and\n\nrelevant case law to \u201cascertain the legislature\u2019s intention.\u201d        Id. at 830\n\n(quoting 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1921(c), 1922; Commonwealth v. Berryman, 649\n\nA.2d 961 (Pa. Super. 1994)).       In doing so, the Stefon Johnson Court\n\n\u201cconclude[d] that there is no support for Johnson\u2019s assertion that subsection\n\n303.4(a)(2) requires six convictions or adjudications, and not six points on\n\nhis prior record score.\u201d Id. Upon review of Appellant\u2019s arguments in light of\n\nthe Stefon Johnson panel\u2019s reasoning, we conclude that the holding of\n\nStefon Johnson is dispositive of Appellant\u2019s first issue. Stefon Johnson,\n\n125 A.3d at 828\u2013832. Thus, Appellant is not entitled to the relief sought.\n\n       Appellant next challenges the discretionary aspects of his sentence.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 7. This Court has held, \u201cWhere an appellant challenges\n\nthe discretionary aspects of a sentence, there is no automatic right to appeal\n\nand an appellant\u2019s appeal should be considered a petition for allowance of\n\nappeal.\u201d Commonwealth v. Crork, 966 A.2d 585, 590 (Pa. Super. 2009).\n\n       Before we reach the merits of Appellant\u2019s sentencing issue:\n\n       we must engage in a four part analysis to determine: (1)\n       whether the appeal is timely; (2) whether Appellant preserved\n       his issue; (3) whether Appellant\u2019s brief includes a concise\n       statement of the reasons relied upon for allowance of appeal\n       with respect to the discretionary aspects of sentence; and (4)\n       whether the concise statement raises a substantial question that\n       the sentence is appropriate under the sentencing code.\n\nCommonwealth v. Clarke, 70 A.3d 1281, 1286 (Pa. Super. 2013) (citing\n\nCommonwealth v. Malovich, 903 A.2d 1247, 1250 (Pa. Super. 2006)).\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fJ-S42012-16\n\n\n\u201cObjections to the discretionary aspects of a sentence are generally waived if\n\nthey are not raised at the sentencing hearing or in a motion to modify the\n\nsentence imposed.\u201d        Commonwealth v. Griffin, 65 A.3d 932, 935 (Pa.\n\nSuper. 2013) (citation omitted).\n\n       In this case, Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal and included a\n\nconcise statement of reasons relied upon for allowance of appeal pursuant to\n\nPa.R.A.P. 2119(f) in his brief. However, Appellant did not preserve his claim\n\nat the sentencing hearing or in his post-sentence motion.       Therefore, we\n\ndeny the petition for allowance of appeal of the discretionary aspects of\n\nAppellant\u2019s sentence.3\n\n       Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3\n   Even if Appellant had preserved his sentencing claim, we would deny him\nrelief. In his Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f) statement, Appellant argues that \u201cthe\nsentencing court sentenced within the guidelines but the case involves\ncircumstances where the application of the guidelines would be clearly\nunreasonable.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 5 (quoting 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9781(c)(2)). In\nthe argument section of his brief, Appellant contends that \u201cthe trial court\nabused its discretion in sentencing Appellant to such a lengthy period of\nincarceration, given the mitigating factors of his case.\u201d Id. at 7.\n\n      \u201cThis Court has held that an excessive sentence claim\u2014in conjunction\nwith an assertion that the court failed to consider mitigating factors\u2014raises a\nsubstantial question.\u201d Commonwealth v. Raven, 97 A.3d 1244, 1253 (Pa.\nSuper. 2014) (citing Commonwealth v. Perry, 883 A.2d 599, 602 (Pa.\nSuper. 2005)). Therefore, assuming Appellant had raised a substantial\nquestion, we would apply this Court\u2019s reasoning in disposing of Stefon\nJohnson\u2019s challenge to the discretionary aspects of his sentence to the facts\nof the case sub judice. Stefon Johnson, 125 A.3d at 825\u2013828. In doing\nso, we would conclude that the evidence of record fails to establish that the\nsentencing court abused its discretion. N.T. Sentencing, 6/23/15, at 23\u201330.\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fJ-S42012-16\n\n\n\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
