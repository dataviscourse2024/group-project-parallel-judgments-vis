GREWAL, United States Magistrate Judge\n\u201cAn affirmative defense, under the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c), is a defense that does not negate the elements of the plaintiffs claim, but instead precludes liability even if all of the elements of the plaintiffs claim are proven.\u201d1 In this class action suit challenging various policies and practices at the Monterey County Jail, Plaintiffs dispute the plausibility of Defendants\u2019 affirmative defenses.2 Plaintiffs seek to strike California Forensic Medical Group\u2019s nine affirmative defenses, the County of Monterey\u2019s sixteen affirmative defenses as well as the County\u2019s request for a jury trial.3 Because Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints are valid, the court GRANTS Plaintiffs\u2019 motions.\nI.\nFed. R. Civ.P. 12(f) holds a \u201ccourt may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense.\u201d 4 \u201cThe function of a Rule 12(f) motion to strike is to avoid the expenditure of time and money that will arise from litigating spurious issues by dispensing with those issues prior to trial.\u201d5\n\u201c[Mjost district courts in this circuit agree that the heightened pleading standard of Twombly and Iqbal ... is now the correct standard to apply to affirmative defenses.\u201d6 In Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, the Supreme Court held that fulfilling the \u201cobligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of ... \u2018entitle[ment] to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements ... will not do.\u201d7 Under the Twombly standard, \u201ca wholly eonelusory statement\u201d8 is insufficient; instead, there must be \u201cenough factual matter\u201d so as to \u201cpossess enough heft to \u2018sho[w] that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u2019 \u201d9 In Ashcroft v. Iqbal, the Supreme Court made clear that *284Twombly rested on its interpretation and application of Fed. R. Civ.P. 8, which governs the pleading standard in all civil actions.10 To be sufficiently pleaded under Rule 8(b), an affirmative defense must give a plaintiff fair notice.11\nThe allegations underlying this dispute are well-known to the parties; less-familiar readers are directed to the court\u2019s order denying Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.12 When Defendants first answered Plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint, Plaintiffs wrote Defendants a letter noting various deficiencies.13 Defendants did not respond, and Plaintiffs filed an initial motion to strike.14 Defendants then agreed to modify \u201cwhether it be by further specificity or deletion,\u201d15 but filed amended answers similar to those they filed the first time.16 Plaintiffs then filed the two instant motions to strike.17\nPlaintiffs request that the court issue an order striking CFMG\u2019s first, second, third and sixth affirmative defenses with prejudice, and striking the remaining affirmative defenses (the fourth, fifth, seventh, eighth and ninth affirmative defenses) for failing to provide sufficient facts to provide Plaintiffs with fair notice.18 Plaintiffs further request the court to issue an order striking the County\u2019s first, second, third, fourth, fifth,\nseventh, eighth, eleventh, twelfth, fourteenth and sixteenth (in part) affirmative defenses with prejudice, and striking the remaining affirmative defenses (the sixth, ninth, tenth, thirteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth (in part) affirmative defenses) for failing to proffer sufficient facts to provide Plaintiffs with fair notice. Plaintiffs also request that the court strike the County\u2019s demand for a jury trial.\nII.\nThis court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The parties further consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(e) and Fed. R. Civ.P. 72(a).19\nIII.\nAfter Iqbal, \u201cthe burden is on the defendant to proffer sufficient facts and law to support an affirmative defense, and not on the plaintiff to gamble on interpreting an insufficient defense in the manner defendant intended.\u201d20 \u201cJust as a plaintiffs complaint must allege enough supporting facts to nudge a legal claim across the line separating plausibility from mere possibility, a defendant\u2019s pleading of affirmative defenses must put a plaintiff on notice of the underlying factual bases of the defense.\u201d21 Affirmative defens*285es are insufficient as a matter of law where \u201c \u2018there are no questions of fact, [ ] any questions of law are clear and not in dispute, and [] under no set of circumstances could the defense succeed.\u2019 \u201d22 Because Defendants\u2019 affirmative defenses are either implausible or deficient as a matter of law, they must be stricken, as must the County\u2019s demand for a jury trial.\nA.\nFirst, CFMG asserts Plaintiffs\u2019 claims may be barred by the statute of limitations and that it \u201cpleads this affirmative defense under information and belief so that it may preserve this defense should facts be revealed during the course of discovery in this action which would support such a defense.\u201d23 CFMG argues this affirmative defense is wholly proper, as it gives Plaintiffs ample notice and sufficient detail.24\nThe problem is that CFMG\u2019s language is unnecessarily equivocal: \u201cPlaintiffs named in this Second Amended Complaint may have failed to meet the applicable limitations period for filing claims ____ should facts be revealed during the course of discovery in this action which would support such a defense.\u201d25 This fails to \u201cpoint to the existence of some identifiable fact that if appliea-ble to [Plaintiffs] would make the affirmative defense plausible on its face.\u201d26 It also fails to identify which of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, if any, would be barred by the statute of limitations.27 Fair notice pleading \u201cis not intended to give parties free license to engage in unfounded fishing expeditions on matters for which they bear the burden of proof.\u201d28 CFMG\u2019s first affirmative defense therefore is stricken.29\nSecond, CFMG seeks to limit \u201cdamages for alleged attorney\u2019s fees\u201d to $112.50 per hour, pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act and Madrid v. Gomez.30 CFMG argues this affirmative defense does not pertain to \u201cdamages\u201d under the PLRA, but rather was an assertion of limitations on attorney\u2019s fees.31 CFMG also argues that because the case does not solely fall under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, the PLRA attorney\u2019s fees provisions still are applicable.32\nBut once again the defense is insufficiently pled. Plaintiffs do not seek damages in their second amended complaint, and attorneys\u2019 fees are not damages.33 In any event, a defense targeting the amount of the recovery is a limitation rather than an affirmative defense.34 CFMG\u2019s second affirmative defense too is stricken.\n*286Third, CFMG \u201ccontinues to assert this affirmative defense [of lack of standing] so as not to waive its right to appeal the District Court\u2019s ruling.\u201d35 CFMG claims its prior standing challenge was limited and it wishes to reserve its right to show that Plaintiffs such as Robert Yancey will not return to the jail.\nOnce again, CFMG\u2019s defense is not a proper affirmative defense. This court has already ruled that Plaintiffs have standing to pursue their claims.36 Moreover, ongoing standing issues \u201care more properly brought before the Court in conjunction with pre-trial motions.\u201d37 Because a lack of standing is not in fact an affirmative defense, CFMG\u2019s third affirmative defense is stricken.38\nFourth, CFMG asserts \u201cthe removal of the alleged barriers is not readily achievable and the modifications requested by Plaintiffs impose an undue burden on Defendant.\u201d39 CFMG argues it is not required to identify specific barriers whose removal is not readily achievable, or precisely what financial burden it would impose on CFMG to do so, as these are matters for litigation and Plaintiffs are on notice they should inquire about barrier removal, alterations and alternative access for inmates with disabilities.40\nOnce again, CFMG\u2019s fourth affirmative defense fails to deliver sufficient facts to provide Plaintiffs with fair notice\u2014facts which are within CFMG\u2019s possession. CFMG fails to offer allegations sufficient to identify to which barriers its affirmative defense applies, which barrier removals are not readily achievable and which modifications impose an undue burden. CFMG\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe totality of the costs associated with barrier removal would impose an undue burden\u201d 41 fails to provide fair notice to Plaintiffs because CFMG does not identify which barriers are at issue, what specific costs are involved and how those costs would create an undue burden for CFMG. The lack of factual bases to support CFMG\u2019s fourth affirmative defense renders the allegations merely possible, rather than plausible.42 CFMG\u2019s fourth affirmative defense is stricken.\nFifth, CFMG asserts it has \u201cprovided \u2018equivalent facilitation\u2019 in the form of alternative designs and technologies which provide substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of CFMG.\u201d43 CFMG\u2019s fifth affirmative defense provides one example regarding Plaintiff Yancey, and as for the remaining Plaintiffs, CFMG offers a list of equivalent facilitations that \u201cmay\u201d have been made.44\n\u201c[I]n disputes concerning disability access, such as the instant matter, defendants ought to be fully aware of and able to allege the equivalent facilitation available to *287disabled patrons, the building codes upon which they have relied, the reasons why architectural modifications may not be readily achievable, and other facts which support the affirmative defenses alleged in their answer. Including this information in the answer furthers the goals of (i) placing the plaintiff on notice as to the nature of the affirmative defenses pleaded, (ii) spurring defendants to omit unsupported and irrelevant defenses, and (iii) ensuring that the parties conduct discovery with a minimum of waste.\u201d45 CFMG does not mention whether Yancey always or only sometimes had \u201cthe option of conducting examinations and consultations with written facilitation.\u201d46 With respect to all Plaintiffs, CFMG\u2019s speculative and generalized wording fails to provide plausibility as to whether and what equivalent facilitations were allegedly provided to any Plaintiffs. CFMG\u2019s fifth affirmative defense is stricken.\nSixth, CFMG claims it \u201chas made good faith efforts to comply with the ADA and all accessibility regulations including providing appropriate alternative access.\u201d47 CFMG argues this defense provides the requisite fair notice.48\nOnce again, CFMG\u2019s defense is insufficiently pleaded and is not even an affirmative defense. CFMG fails to identify what compliance efforts it made and what \u201calternative access\u201d it provided to Plaintiffs. Without these basic factual allegations, Plaintiffs cannot ascertain the grounds for CFMG\u2019s affirmative defense and are deprived of fair notice. Moreover, \u201cgood faith\u201d is an insufficient defense because CFMG\u2019s intent is irrelevant to Plaintiffs\u2019 ADA claims. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims for violation of the ADA do not require a showing of lack of good faith or intentional discrimination.49 Because CFMG\u2019s intent is irrelevant to Plaintiffs\u2019 ADA claims, its affirmative defense of \u201cgood faith\u201d is improper and stricken.\nSeventh, CFMG asserts \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 claims are barred because the modifications Plaintiffs seek are not \u201calterations\u2019 within the meaning of the ADA or Title 24 and/or they do not trigger an \u2018alteration\u2019 legal standard, including because the modifications sought will be disproportionate in cost or cost in excess of 20% of the entire \u2018alteration.\u2019 \u201d CFMG argues they have provided Plaintiffs with sufficient notice as to this affirmative defense.50\nCFMG\u2019s seventh affirmative defense is overbroad and fails to offer sufficient facts to provide Plaintiffs with fair notice. Plaintiffs cannot know which modifications are relevant to the defense, which modifications are not \u201calterations,\u201d which modifications do not trigger an \u201calteration\u201d legal standard or what constitutes the total \u201calteration\u201d at issue. CFMG\u2019s seventh affirmative defense is stricken.\nEighth, CFMG asserts \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Second Amended Complaint, in whole or in part, is barred by the doctrine of equitable estop-pel.\u201d 51 This is because, to CFMG, Plaintiffs were encouraged to file grievances and declarations that were false or incomplete for the purpose of increasing the number of litigants. Citing cases pre-Twombly or out of circuit, CFMG argues it need not plead all the elements of a prima facie case in its defense.52\nHowever sufficient they may have been pr e-Twombly, post-Twombly CFMG\u2019s allegations are insufficient to support its defense of equitable estoppel. \u201cThe defense of equitable estoppel is established by showing: (1) the party to be estopped [knew] the facts; (2) [the party intended] that his conduct [would] be acted upon; (3) the other party [was] ignorant of the true *288facts; and (4) [the other party relied] upon the conduct to his injury.\u201d53 CFMG has not alleged facts to support the elements of this defense. For example, CFMG has failed to identify what conduct Plaintiffs intended CFMG to act upon and how it relied on Plaintiffs\u2019 untrue or incomplete statements. CFMG\u2019s eighth affirmative defense is stricken.\nNinth, CFMG asserts that \u201call\u201d of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are barred because \u201cmany of the Plaintiffs either failed to file a grievance pursuant to the Monterey County Jail inmate handbook and/or failed to appeal the outcome of the grievance to a Commander or other appropriate personnel.\u201d54 In its opposition, CFMG fails to address its ninth affirmative defense.\nCFMG has not alleged that there was an administrative remedy available to Plaintiffs,55 or which specific procedures were not followed. CFMG has provided no facts as to what Plaintiffs must do to and which Plaintiffs failed to exhaust that remedy and which particular causes of action might be barred under a doctrine related to exhaustion. CFMG\u2019s ninth affirmative defense is stricken.\nB.\nFor all of their affirmative defenses, using a pre-Twombly standard, the County solely asserts that they include sufficient facts and have placed Plaintiffs on notice of the issues to be addressed in this ease, and that no judicial economy will be achieved by striking any of the affirmative defenses.\nFirst, the County asserts that \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action against this answering Defendant in that there was no deprivation of rights (constitutional or otherwise) as to any of the individual Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs received adequate medical and mental health care under the law and reasonable accommodations were provided to applicable Plaintiffs.\u201d56 However, \u201c[f]ailure to state a claim is not a proper affirmative defense\u201d and is more akin to a denial, which is improper in the context of an affirmative defense.57 The County\u2019s first affirmative defense is stricken.\nSecond, the County avers \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action against COUNTY OF MON-TEREY, because there was no deprivation of rights (constitutional or otherwise) or discrimination resulting from an official policy, custom, or practice of this answering Defendant.\u201d58 As with Defendant\u2019s first affirmative defense, failure to state a claim is not a proper affirmative defense, and this affirmative defense too is stricken.\nThird, the County asserts its \u201cactions were objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting it, and its conduct did not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. Specifically, Defendant complied with Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations and industry and community standards in the provision of care to inmates at the ... jail. *289Defendants and its officers and employees are entitled to qualified immunity.\u201d59\nIn addition to presenting insufficient facts, the County\u2019s third affirmative defense is improper and not an affirmative defense as it merely negates Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions that the County violated their statutory and constitutional rights. Affirmative defenses admit allegations in the complaint, but assert additional facts that would defeat recovery.60 By contrast, defenses that negate an element of the plaintiffs\u2019 proof are not affirmative defenses because they serve only to controvert an element of the plaintiffs\u2019 prima facie ease.61 Labeling contentions that only attack the sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 proof as affirmative defenses is improper.62 In negating Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, the County offers no facts to identify any particular action the County took, and the allegations fail to show how or why any particular action was objectively reasonable. The County\u2019s assertion that they complied with Title 15 as well as industry and community standards fails to offer facts sufficient to satisfy the heightened pleading standards that are now the law of the land. Notably, the County fails to identify any single standard with which they complied, and likewise fail to identify what actions they undertook to comply.\nFurther, while the doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials acting in their official capacity,63 Plaintiffs have not sued any government officials acting in their official capacity. The County\u2019s third affirmative defense is therefore \u201cimmaterial and insufficient as a matter of law with respect to the claims pleaded in the complaint.\u201d64 Moreover, \u201cqualified immunity is an affirmative defense to damage liability; it does not bar actions for declaratory or injunctive relief.\u201d65 Plaintiffs are not seeking damages. The County\u2019s third amended defense is stricken.\nFourth, the County asserts \u201cthat should Plaintiffs attempt to add California state law causes of action against Defendant, such causes of action would be barred because Plaintiffs have failed to comply with the requirements of the California Government Claims Act (aka \u2018California Tort Claims Act\u2019). Further, Defendant asserts Plaintiffs are seeking to impose an obligation on Defendant to provide medical benefits to Plaintiffs in excess of those required by the U.S. Constitution and Title 15, and to the extent this provides a financial benefit to Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs should be subject to the California Government Claims Act.\u201d66 In its opposition, the County argues legal arguments against potential relief can be affirmative defenses.67\nThe problem is that the County does not identify any specific requirements of the California Government Claims Act, nor does it state how Plaintiffs failed to comply with that requirement. The County\u2019s assertion that Plaintiffs seek to impose an excessive obligation is vague and does not explain which claims for relief are in excess of obligations required by the U.S. Constitution and Title 15. This affirmative defense seems to try to preempt a not-yet asserted cause of action\u2014\u201cshould Plaintiffs attempt to add *290California state law causes of action\u201d\u2014rather than connecting to Plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint.- Further, the California Government Claims Act\u2019s requirements for state claims-presentation do not apply to declaratory and injunctive relief68 and so cannot constitute an affirmative defense to Plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint. This defense is stricken\nFifth, the County asserts that \u201c[t]he acts or omissions set forth in the Complaint ... fail to state a claim for relief and are insufficient to maintain a cause of action.\u201d69 As with CFMG\u2019s first and second affirmative defenses, failure to state a claim is not a proper affirmative defense, and this affirmative defense is stricken.\nSixth, the County asserts that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are barred by the doctrine of equitable estoppel, for the same reason stated in CFMG\u2019s eighth affirmative defense.70 Also for the same reasons, the County\u2019s insufficiently pleaded sixth affirmative defense is stricken.\nSeventh, the County asserts \u201cDefendant contends that it is immune from liability pursuant to state and federal law. Specifically, under Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, the County does not have any policy or practice which would amount to \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 in the care and treatment of inmates at the ... jail.\u201d71 The County does not specifically identify any state law that would provide them immunity. The County\u2019s affirmative defenses based on state law immunities are not applicable to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on federal law.72 Also like the County\u2019s third affirmative defense, the County\u2019s seventh affirmative defense serves only to negate Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions. Though potentially insufficient as a matter of law and in danger of not constituting an affirmative defense, the County\u2019s seventh affirmative defense too is stricken.\nEighth, the County alleges Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is barred by the statute of limitations. As with CFMG\u2019s first affirmative defense, the County\u2019s eighth affirmative defense is stricken for insufficient facts.73\nNinth, the County asserts Plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action are barred because unidentified Plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies and grievance procedures.74 For the same failure to provide sufficient factual allegations as in CFMG\u2019s ninth affirmative defense, the County\u2019s ninth affirmative defense is stricken.\nTenth, the County asserts Plaintiffs claims are barred by the doctrine of laches. \u201cSpecifically, on information and belief, the Office of the Public Defender specifically complemented the medical care being given to inmates at the ... jail. Contemporaneous *291to this, the Public Defender was collaborating with Plaintiffs and their counsel to gather declarations and grievances which were boiler plate and falsely or incompletely represented the quality of care (medical, mental and security) inmates received, as well as their satisfaction with such sendees.\u201d75 To establish a defense of laches, a defendant must prove (1) unreasonable delay and (2) prejudice.76 The County\u2019s allegations contain no information about delay or prejudice, and are insufficient to support a plausible defense of laches.77 The County\u2019s tenth affirmative defense is stricken.\nEleventh, the County asserts that \u201c[t]he training programs of Defendant County of Monterey were adequate to train deputies to properly handle usual and recurring situations which they would encounter, and Defendant County of Monterey did not act with deliberate indifference with regard to the need to adequately train deputies. At all times material hereto, Plaintiffs were afforded all of the rights, privileges and immunities granted pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the United States and the State of California. Plaintiffs were provided mental and medical care and accommodations pursuant to state and federal law and industry standards. At no time material hereto did Monterey County, or any Monterey County employee or agent act in bad faith or wantonly, recklessly, or maliciously, or with a disregard for Plaintiffs\u2019 health, safety and welfare.\u201d 78\nAs with the third and the seventh affirmative defenses, the County\u2019s eleventh affirmative defense serves only to negate Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions. Further, as with the County\u2019s affirmative defenses based on state law immunities in the seventh affirmative defense, as a matter of law, to the extent the eleventh affirmative defense rests on immunity under California law, the County\u2019s assertions are inapplicable to Plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action arising under federal law. The County\u2019s eleventh affirmative defense is stricken.\nTwelfth, the County claims Plaintiffs lack standing for the same reasons that CFMG provides.79 As with CFMG\u2019s third defense, the County\u2019s twelfth affirmative defense is stricken.\nThirteenth, similarly to the County\u2019s ninth affirmative defense, the County asserts all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are barred by the PLRA because certain unidentified Plaintiffs failed to follow grievance procedures \u201cas enumerated in the Monterey County inmate handbook.\u201d80 For the same failure to provide sufficient factual allegations as in CFMG\u2019s ninth affirmative defense and the County\u2019s ninth affirmative defense, the County\u2019s thirteenth affirmative defense is stricken.\nFourteenth, the County asserts Plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief goes against public policy. \u201cDetermining whether an injunction either promotes or contradicts public policy goes to the heart of injunction analysis.\u201d81 As with the third, seventh, and eleventh affirmative defenses, because this question goes to the merits of the ease, it is inappropriately presented as an affirmative defense. But because the court is not convinced that amendment is futile, the County\u2019s fourteenth affirmative defense is stricken.\nFifteenth, the County claims \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 claims for relief and request for attorneys\u2019 fees are limited, in whole or in part, by the Prison Litigation Reform Act.\u201d82 A coneluso-ry statement, the County fails to identify which particular causes of action in Plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint might be limited *292under the PLRA, nor does the County articulate how such claims would be limited. The County\u2019s fifteenth affirmative defense fails to deliver sufficient facts to provide Plaintiffs with fair notice. Like CFMG\u2019s second affirmative defense, the County\u2019s fifteenth affirmative defense is stricken.\nSixteenth, the County asserts that the jail \u201cwas built and occupied before January 26, 1990. As such,\u201d it argues, \u201cthe \u2018readily achievable standard applies\u2019 as to any ADA claims and requested modifications cannot impose an undue burden on Defendant or fundamentally alter the nature of the ... jail.\u201d83 The county cites 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181, which provides a list of definitions for terms such as \u201creadily achievable.\u201d\nSection \u00a7 12181(9) falls under Title III of the ADA, which applies to places of public accommodation,84 not under Title II of the ADA, which applies to public entities like the County.85 Therefore, the \u201creadily achievable\u201d standard does not apply to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the County. The County also does not identify which \u201crequested modifications\u201d they believe are impermissible or how the modifications would \u201cimpose an undue burden\u201d or \u201cfundamentally alter\u201d the County\u2019s programs or services. Without such information, Plaintiffs lack notice of the nature of the defense. The County\u2019s sixteenth affirmative defense is stricken.\nc.\nThe County\u2019s amended answer includes a demand for a jury trial under Fed. R. Civ.P. 38.86 Rule 38 provides for a jury only if there is a right to a jury under the governing statute or the Seventh Amendment.87\nThe Seventh Amendment provides that \u201c[i]n Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.\u201d88 The Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[s]uits at common law\u201d refers to \u201csuits in which legal rights [are] to be ascertained and determined.\u201d89 \u201cIf the only relief sought is equitable, such as an injunction ..., neither the party seeking that relief nor the party opposing it is entitled to a jury trial.\u201d90 A jury trial also is not available for requests for declaratory relief.91\nThe County argues monetary relief would be adequate for the relief Plaintiffs seek.92 In addition, the County argues that Plaintiffs request medical benefits that go above and beyond what is required\u2014therefore the relief is not equitable but rather legal.93 As such, the County argues they are entitled to a jury trial.94\nThe County misconstrues the appropriate issue. Plaintiffs do not seek monetary *293damages, period.95 Because Plaintiffs seek only equitable relief in the form of a permanent injunctive and declaratory relief,96 a jury trial simply is not available.97\nIV.\nDefendants\u2019 affirmative defenses are stricken. The County\u2019s request for a jury trial is stricken. Because the court cannot yet say that amendment of each of the disputed affirmative defenses would be futile, leave to amend also is GRANTED.98 Any amendments shall be filed in by May 14, 2015.\nSO ORDERED.\n\n.
