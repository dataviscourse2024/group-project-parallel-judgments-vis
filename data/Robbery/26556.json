PREVE OF COUNSEL), FOR DEFENDANT-APPELLANT. \r\nJOHN J. FLYNN, DISTRICT ATTORNEY, BUFFALO (ASHLEY R. LOWRY OF COUNSEL), FOR RESPONDENT. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tAppeal from a judgment of the Erie County Court (Michael F. Pietruszka, J.), rendered April 20, 2017. The judgment convicted defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of burglary in the third degree. \r\nIt is hereby ORDERED that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.\r\nMemorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of guilty of burglary in the third degree (Penal Law\r\n\u00a7 140.20). Contrary to defendant's contention, the record establishes that he knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived the right to appeal with respect to all aspects of his case, including his sentence, and that he was informed of the maximum sentence that County Court could impose (see People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825, 827 [1998]; cf. People v Maracle, 19 NY3d 925, 928 [2012]). Consequently, that valid waiver forecloses any challenge by defendant to the severity of the sentence (see generally Lococo, 92 NY2d at 827; People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]).\r\nEntered: April 26, 2019\r\nMark W.
