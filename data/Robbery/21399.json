(Ret.),\n         Specially Assigned\n\n\n        \u00b6 1.   DOOLEY, J.           Defendants-counterclaimants Jeanmarie Leonard and Carol\n\nSayour appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on their counterclaims in\n\nfavor of plaintiff Jennifer Weinstein and third-party defendants, Lloyd Weinstein, plaintiff\u2019s\n\nhusband, and his law firm, The Weinstein Group, P.C. Defendants claim on appeal that there are\n\ndisputed material facts to justify a jury trial on their counterclaims of breach of contract, tortious\n\ninvasion of privacy, and abuse of process, and that their reading of the allegedly breached\n\ncontract is, at a minimum, a reasonable one precluding summary judgment. We affirm.\n\f       \u00b6 2.    Construing the facts in the light most favorable to defendants, the genesis of this\n\ncase is an application for a permit to construct a barn made by defendants in May 2012.\n\nDefendants, as well as plaintiff and her husband, are residents of the Rocking Stone Farm\n\nSubdivision in Manchester, Vermont. Defendants own Lot #10 of the subdivision and plaintiff\n\nsolely owns Lot #9. On May 29, 2012, defendants received a zoning permit from Manchester\u2019s\n\nzoning administrator allowing them to construct a barn on Lot #10.    Pursuant to the Declaration\n\nfor Rocking Stone Farm (the \u201cDeclaration\u201d), defendants received a waiver from the\n\nHomeowner\u2019s Association (the \u201cAssociation\u201d), through the president and principal Tommy\n\nHarmon, permitting them to erect the barn. Plaintiff appealed the permit to the Manchester\n\nDevelopment Review Board (the \u201cDRB\u201d) on June 12, 2012. The DRB affirmed the grant of the\n\npermit on August 6.\n\n       \u00b6 3.    On August 25, defendant Leonard and her husband were walking along Lot #10\n\nwith a landscape contractor when plaintiff began yelling at them from her upstairs window.\n\nPlaintiff then left her home and entered Lot #10, accompanied by a \u201cvery large dog.\u201d Despite\n\nbeing asked to leave, she physically confronted the Leonards, who eventually left the lot.\n\n       \u00b6 4.    Two days later, plaintiff filed an appeal of the DRB\u2019s decision to the\n\nEnvironmental Division of the Superior Court. Plaintiff, a trained attorney, initially represented\n\nherself, but Mr. Weinstein and his law firm, The Weinstein Group, P.C., entered an appearance\n\nas counsel for her on December 18. In November and December, both the Association and\n\ncounsel for defendants advised plaintiff by letter that her opposition to the barn permit\n\nconstituted a violation of the Non-Interference Clause of the Declaration, which provides that\n\neach owner of a lot in Rocking Stone Farm agrees \u201cnot [to] take any action to contest or interfere\n\nwith any development in the Community so long as such development is consistent with the\n\nLand Use Approvals.\u201d\n\n       \u00b6 5.    On February 4, 2013, the Environmental Division rendered judgment in favor of\n\ndefendants. Plaintiff appealed that decision to this Court on February 13. On March 15, Plaintiff\n                                                 2\n\falso filed suit against defendants in superior court with a ten-count complaint, alleging, among\n\nother things, that the Declaration had been breached by defendants\u2019 construction of the barn.\n\nDefendants filed counterclaims against plaintiff for trespass, civil assault, breach of contract,\n\ntortious invasion of privacy, as well as abuse of process and third-party claims against Mr.\n\nWeinstein and his law firm for abuse of process and breach of contract.\n\n       \u00b6 6.   Although counsel for plaintiffs had told Mr. Weinstein that their counsel had been\n\nauthorized to accept process, defendants were served personally in their homes on or about\n\nMarch 26. Mr. Weinstein also sent letters directly to Mr. Harmon and defendants the night\n\nbefore oral argument in this Court in the zoning appeal, despite knowing they were represented\n\nby counsel. On September 13, this Court affirmed the decision of the Environmental Decision\n\nupholding the zoning permit. Following the Court\u2019s decision, Ms. Weinstein raised no more\n\nobjections to the Town\u2019s issuance of the permit.\n\n       \u00b6 7.   In November 2014, with a jury trial scheduled for January 2015 in the remaining\n\ncivil suit, plaintiff and Mr. Weinstein and The Weinstein Group, P.C., filed for summary\n\njudgment regarding the counterclaims and third-party claims asserted by defendants.          On\n\nDecember 24, plaintiff filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss all remaining claims she had\n\nasserted against defendants. Finally, on January 12, 2015 the Superior Court partially granted\n\nthe summary judgment motions, dismissing all but the civil assault and trespass claims against\n\nplaintiff and dismissing all claims against Mr. Weinstein and his law firm. Defendants then\n\nvoluntarily withdrew their remaining two claims against plaintiff and appealed the grant of\n\nsummary judgment to this Court.\n\n       \u00b6 8.   Summary judgment decisions are reviewed de novo. \u201cSummary judgment will be\n\ngranted when, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there is\n\nno genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.\u201d Glassford v. Dufresne & Associates, P.C., 2015 VT 77 \u00b610, ___ Vt. ___, ___\n\nA.3d ____.\n                                                   3\n\f          \u00b6 9.    Defendants\u2019 main claim is that plaintiff\u2019s efforts to stop the issuance of the\n\npermit to build the barn through the Manchester DRB and the courts were a violation of the non-\n\ninterference clause contained in \u00a7 14.2 of the Declaration. The full section containing the clause\n\nstates:\n\n                  Section 14.2 Acknowledgments. Each owner acknowledges and\n                  agrees that such Owner will not take any action to contest or\n                  interfere with any development of the Community so long as such\n                  development is consistent with the Land Use Approvals. Each\n                  Owner hereby waives any right it may have to object to any\n                  Condominium Project to be developed on the Condominium\n                  Projects Lot so long as such Condominium Project is in\n                  conformance with the terms, conditions and restrictions of the\n                  Land Use Approvals. Each Owner further acknowledges and\n                  agrees that such Owner has not relied upon any representations or\n                  assurances regarding the development of the community, except\n                  for those statements set forth in this Declaration.\n\n\nThe term \u201ccommunity\u201d is defined in \u00a7 2.8 of the Declaration as \u201cthe planned community formed\n\nunder this Declaration, including the entirety of the Property, together with all buildings,\n\nimprovements, amenities, facilities and infrastructure located on or appertaining to the Property\n\nnow and in the future, together with all the easements and rights benefitting the Property. . . .\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cLand Use Approvals\u201d is defined in \u00a7 2.24 as \u201cthe federal, state and municipal\n\napprovals for the development of the Community listed in Exhibit B of this Declaration, as\n\namended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time.\u201d Exhibit B describes the 15\n\npermits obtained for the overall development between 1976 and 2006.\n\n          \u00b6 10.   Defendants argue that under \u00a7 14.2 plaintiff\u2019s appearance before the Manchester\n\nDRB in opposition to their barn development proposal, as well as her appeals to the\n\nenvironmental division and to this Court, were actions \u201cto contest or interfere with any\n\ndevelopment of the Community\u201d that was consistent with the overall land use approvals. They\n\nfurther argue that the bringing of this civil suit was a violation of \u00a7 14.2. Thus, they argue that\n\nthese actions violated \u00a7 14.2, and such a violation was a breach of contract, and that Mr.\n\nWeinstein and his law firms are liable for the breach as agents of plaintiff. They make the\n                                              4\n\fadditional argument that if this Court finds the language of \u00a7 14.2 ambiguous as applied to the\n\ncircumstances in this case, summary judgment was inappropriate, and they have the right to offer\n\nextraneous evidence on the meaning of the provision.\n\n       \u00b6 11.   We begin with the argument that Ms. Weinstein\u2019s appearance in the development\n\nreview procedure was a violation of \u00a7 14.2. In essence, defendants argue that \u00a7 14.2 is a form of\n\nexculpatory waiver agreement under which plaintiff waived her right to participate in municipal\n\ndevelopment review proceedings and any judicial review of such proceedings.           Exculpatory\n\nagreements are generally disfavored. Provoncha v. Vermont Motocross Ass\u2019n, Inc., 2009 VT 29,\n\n\u00b6 12, 185 Vt. 473, 974 A.2d 1261. They are subject to \u201cclose judicial scrutiny\u201d and must meet\n\n\u201chigher standards for clarity\u201d than other contracts. Id.; see also Colgan v. Agway, 150 Vt. 373,\n\n375, 553 A.2d 143, 145 (1988) (\u201ca greater degree of clarity is necessary to make the exculpatory\n\nclause effective\u201d).    They are to be strictly construed \u201cagainst the party relying\u201d on them.\n\nThompson v. Hi Tech Motor Sports, 2008 VT 15, \u00b6 17, 183 Vt. 218, 945 A.2d 368. In addition\n\nto imposing clarity and specification requirements on the drafting of exculpatory clauses, we\n\nhave also found exculpatory clauses ineffective if they violate public policy. Dalury v. S-K-I,\n\nLtd., 164 Vt. 329, 332, 670 A.2d 795, 797 (1995). Exculpatory clauses will be upheld only if\n\nthey are \u201cfreely and fairly made . . . between parties who are in an equal bargaining position and\n\n. . . there is no social interest with which [they] interfere.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). The public\n\ninterest is determined through consideration of the \u201ctotality of circumstances of any given case\n\nagainst the backdrop of current societal expectations.\u201d Id. at 334, A.2d at 798.\n\n       \u00b6 12.   We need not get beyond the disclosure and specificity standards to rule that we\n\nwill not enforce \u00a7 14.2 in the manner sought by defendants. The waiver language is contained in\n\nan Article titled \u201cDISCLOSURES AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\u201d in a section entitled\n\nAcknowledgements. It is on page 34 of a 39 page document. Although the record does not show\n\nthe details of the drafting and effect of the Declaration, it is undisputed that it was prepared by\n\n\n                                                5\n\fthe developer, Rocking Stone Farm, LLC, and each purchaser of a lot in the development must\n\naccept its terms. Thus, it is a form of contract of adhesion.\n\n       \u00b6 13.   The applicable language of \u00a7 14.2 does not use the term \u201cwaiver\u201d, although the\n\nfollowing sentence does explicitly use that term. The language does not state that owners have\n\nwaived all rights to raise objections to land use development that directly affects them in\n\nmunicipal, state, or judicial proceedings which are intended for that purpose. Other provisions in\n\nthe document purport to create waivers and state so explicitly. See Declaration \u00a7 6.13 (waiver of\n\nhomestead exemption).\n\n       \u00b6 14.   There is nothing else in the Declaration that gives notice that a waiver of the\n\nscope and type urged by defendants can be found in \u00a7 14.2 or in the Declaration generally. The\n\ndeclaration contains a separate design review process, conducted by a design review committee\n\nalong with design and use standards.         Defendants argue that the design review process\n\ndetermines compliance with local regulatory standards, but that is an overstatement of the design\n\nreview committee\u2019s function.      Instead, the committee reviews a development proposal for\n\ncompatibility with the design and use standards as well as the regulatory permits that were issued\n\nto authorize the development as a whole. Design and Use Standards I(A). In fact, a separate\n\nsection of the Declaration, labeled \u201cGovernmental Requirements,\u201d provides:\n\n                Compliance with the Association\u2019s design review process is not a\n               substitute for compliance with the Land Use Approvals, the Town\n               of Manchester\u2019s building, zoning and subdivision regulations, and\n               other applicable land use and environmental laws and regulations.\n               Each owner is responsible for obtaining all permits and approvals\n               required to commence construction.\n\nDeclaration, \u00a7 7.6. There is no indication that the Association is involved in any way in the\n\nprocess of obtaining local regulatory approval.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f          \u00b6 15.   We recognize there are differences between the contractual waiver imposed here\n\nand the contractual waivers imposed in earlier cases, which involved waiver of tort liability.1 If\n\nanything, the differences persuade us to be more cautious here in looking at the scope of the\n\nwaiver asserted. The waiver asserted may not forfeit substantive rights but it would prohibit\n\nparticipation in the process to vindicate those rights.         It would mean the giving up of\n\nfundamental rights. Free access to the courts is \u201can essential right\u201d recognized in Chapter I,\n\nArticle 4 of the Vermont Constitution. Jacobsen v. Garzo, 149 Vt. 205, 209, 542 A.2d 265, 268\n\n(1988).\n\n          \u00b6 16.   The right to participate in municipal development proceedings is also\n\nfundamental. If plaintiff did not participate in the DRB proceedings, she forfeited her right of\n\naccess to the courts for review of those proceedings. See 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 8504(b)(1); 24 V.S.A. \u00a7\n\n4471(a).      As an adjoining landowner, she was entitled to personal notice of the DRB\n\nproceedings. 24 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4464(a)(1)(C), 4464(a)(2)(B). Further, as a person who owns or\n\noccupies property in the immediate neighborhood of a property that is subject to a decision by\n\nthe DRB and who can demonstrate a physical or environmental impact on her interest from the\n\ndecision the DRB will make, plaintiff is an interested person. 24 V.S.A. \u00a7 4465(b)(3). Interested\n\npersons have the right to appeal in municipal regulatory proceedings to the appropriate municipal\n\npanel, here the DRB, id., \u00a7 4465(a), and from there to the environmental division, id., \u00a7 4471,\n\nand thereafter to this Court, 10 V.S.A. \u00a7 8505(a).\n\n          \u00b6 17.   We must ensure that any waiver of the important rights to participate in a land use\n\nadjudicatory proceeding, whether in an administrative process or before the courts, is done\n\nknowingly and intentionally. In Colgan v. Agway, 150 Vt. 373, 533 A.2d 143 (1988), the\n\n\n          1\n         We reject one difference argued by defendants. They argue that the Declaration is an\nagreement among landowners and not a contract imposed by a seller on a buyer in connection\nwith a sale. While the Declaration may evolve into an agreement among landowners, when\nconsummated, it was a contract connected with a sale of real property by a commercial\ndeveloper, to which the purchaser had to agree without change so it could be uniformly\nimplemented.\n                                             7\n\fplaintiff purchased a manure storage facility from the defendant. Three years after the purchase,\n\na wall of the facility collapsed. The plaintiff sued the defendant alleging breach of contract,\n\nbreach of warranty and negligence in the design, distribution and sale of the facility. The\n\ndefendant sought summary judgment on the negligence count, arguing that the warranty\n\nlanguage in the sales contract precluded \u201cany other obligations or liability on the part of the\n\ncontractor\u201d and applied to liability based on negligence. We rejected that argument, holding that\n\nthe standard is that \u201ccontractual language disclaiming tort liability [must] be clear enough that\n\nthe intent of both parties to relieve the defendant of the claimed liability be unmistakeable.\u201d\n\nColgan, 150 Vt. at 375, 553 A.2d at 145. We noted that the most effective way to exclude\n\nliability for negligence is \u201cto provide explicitly\u201d that such liability is excluded and required that\n\nwords conveying a similar import appear. Id. at 376, 553 A.2d at 146. We held that the wording\n\nin the contract did not meet that standard. Id. at 377, 553 A.2d at 146. We also held that it was\n\nineffective because its location at the end of a paragraph describing the applicable warranty was\n\nillogical. Id. We concluded with the observation that \u201cplaintiff would have been unfairly\n\nsurprised were he to be informed that, by virtue of the contract, the defendant was protected from\n\nany liability flowing from negligent design of the facility.\u201d Id. at 378, 553 A.2d at 147. We\n\nreached the same conclusion in Thompson v. Hi Tech Motor Sports, Inc., 2008 VT 15, \u00b6 19,\n\nbecause the language of the release in that case did not sufficiently convey that it excluded\n\nliability based on the negligence of the defendant.\n\n       \u00b6 18.   For the same general reasons, we hold that a waiver of the right to bring related\n\ncivil litigation must meet the same standards.2 Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that defendants\n\nviolated the declaration in multiple ways, essentially alleging a breach of contract. Plaintiff\u2019s\n\nright of access to the courts for enforcement of the Declaration contract is an important right, just\n\n\n\n       2\n          Under the broad language of \u00a7 14.2 advocated by defendants, even the complaint to the\ndesign review committee created by the Declaration would seem to be a breach of \u00a7 14.2, again\nhighlighting how broad their reading is.\n                                               8\n\fas her right to participate in the development review proceedings was an important right. We\n\nmust also conclude that waiver of this important right must be knowing and intentional.\n\n       \u00b6 19.   We hold that a contractual waiver of the right to participate in a municipal land\n\nuse permit proceeding, to seek and participate in judicial review of such a permit, and to enforce\n\nthe declaration in contract must meet at least the standards of Colgan. The waiver in this case\n\ndoes not meet those standards.       The waiver does not explicitly reach municipal land use\n\nproceedings, judicial review of municipal action, or contract litigation. Its scope in this regard is\n\nnot \u201cunmistakable.\u201d Colgan, 150 Vt. at 375, 553 A.2d at 145. Moreover, its placement under\n\nan ambiguous title in a long detailed document does not give the purchaser fair notice of its\n\nmeaning.\n\n       \u00b6 20.   Because our holding is based on minimum standards of notice to the purchaser,\n\nand not the precise meaning of the language, defendants\u2019 secondary argument that summary\n\njudgment is improper if the language is ambiguous is inapplicable. We hold that the waiver is\n\nineffective to accomplish what defendants assert. The trial court did not err in granting summary\n\njudgment to plaintiff on defendants\u2019 breach of contract claim.\n\n       \u00b6 21.   Defendants have also made a third-party claim against Mr. Weinstein, alleging\n\nthat he and his law firm engaged in conduct that induced and facilitated Ms. Weinstein\u2019s\n\nbreaches of the Non-Interference Clause. Since we have held that defendants\u2019 claim against\n\nplaintiff cannot be sustained, it necessarily follows that the facilitation claim against Mr.\n\nWeinstein and his law firm must also fail.3\n\n       \u00b6 22.   Defendants\u2019 second argument on appeal is that the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment to plaintiff, Mr. Weinstein, and The Weinstein Group, P.C. as to their abuse\n\n       3\n           In their brief to this Court, defendants argue that Mr. Weinstein\u2019s conduct constitutes\ntortious interference with another\u2019s performance under a contract. This position was \u201csummarily\nrejected\u201d by the trial court on the grounds that it was never pled or previously alleged in any\ncourt proceedings. We reject it also, both for the failure to raise it below and because it is settled\nVermont law that \u201ca claim for tortious interference with contractual relations cannot be\npredicated upon an allegedly improper filing of a lawsuit.\u201d Jacobsen, 149 Vt. at 209, 542 A.2d at\n268.\n                                                  9\n\fof process claim. A party alleging abuse of process must demonstrate \u201c1) an illegal, improper, or\n\nunauthorized use of a court process; 2) an ulterior motive or an ulterior purpose; and 3) resulting\n\ndamage to the plaintiff.\u201d Jacobsen, 149 Vt. at 208, 542 A.2d at 268. Even if used to satisfy\n\nmalicious intentions, \u201cthe proper use of legal process . . . is not actionable.\u201d Id. at 207, 542 A.2d\n\nat 267. Filing a frivolous lawsuit therefore cannot itself be the predicate for a claim; the tort\n\nrequires that the \u201cprocesses of the court have themselves been used improperly.\u201d Nashef v.\n\nAADCO Medical, Inc, 947 F. Supp. 2d 413, 421 (D. Vt. 2013) (citations omitted). Accord\n\nSavino v. City of New York, 331 F.3d 63, 77 (2d Cir. 2003) (New York has \u201cmade clear that a\n\nmalicious motive alone . . . does not give rise to a cause of action for abuse of process\u201d)\n\n(quotation omitted); Doctor\u2019s Assoc., Inc. v. Weible, 92 F.3d 108, 114 (2d Cir. 1996) (holding\n\nthat under Connecticut law, \u201cno matter what misconduct by the tortfeasor occurs before the\n\ncommencement of suit, it is not, in itself, an abuse of process because there is not yet process to\n\nabuse\u201d); Bus. Publ\u2019ns, Inc. v. Stephen, 666 A.2d 932, 933 (N.H. 1995) (\u201c[T]he general rule is\n\nthat the initiation of vexatious civil proceedings known to be groundless is not abuse of\n\nprocess.\u201d(citation removed)(emphasis removed)).\n\n       \u00b6 23.   With respect to Ms. Weinstein, defendants allege that as a trained attorney,\n\nplaintiff had an obligation to avoid \u201cscorched-earth litigation\u201d strategies of bringing meritless\n\nclaims before multiple tribunals, claims she \u201cnever intended to go to trial.\u201d Recognizing their\n\nclaim is an \u201cextraordinary\u201d one, defendants argue that their abuse of process claim must be\n\nsubmitted to a jury because plaintiff is both a lawyer and a lot owner subject to the Non-\n\nInterference Clause, which, as an attorney, she must have been either aware of or \u201cwoefully\n\nirresponsible\u201d in ignoring. They suggest her legal maneuvers constitute a \u201cbullying tactic\u201d\n\nintended to intimidate and impoverish defendants in order to gain private ends.\n\n       \u00b6 24.   Defendants\u2019 arguments must fail for two reasons. First, we cannot support the\n\nproposition that plaintiff\u2019s rights of access to municipal land use permitting proceedings and to\n\nVermont courts are any different from those of any other citizen by virtue of the fact she has\n                                             10\n\flegal training. Free and uninhibited access to the courts is \u201can important right of all citizens\u201d\n\nenshrined in the Vermont Constitution. Jacobsen, 149 Vt. at 208, 542 A.2d at 267. There is\n\nsimply no suggestion in the case law that that right is in any way circumscribed by a citizen\u2019s\n\neducational or professional background.\n\n       \u00b6 25.   Second, defendants have failed to identify any instance in which Ms. Weinstein\n\nhas abused specific municipal land use and court processes. Regardless of her motivations in\n\ndoing so, plaintiff used the legal system \u201cfor the purpose for which it is intended\u201d: to clarify,\n\nestablish, and adjudicate the parties\u2019 respective rights with respect to improvements on Lot #10.\n\nSee Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7682 cmt. b. (1965). In contrast to cases where abuse of\n\nprocess has been found, plaintiff has not improperly used subpoenas, asked for an excessive\n\nattachment, or used pleadings to coerce the surrendering of unrelated property, Doctor\u2019s\n\nAssociates, 92 F.3d at 114, but instead, has observed procedural requirements by appealing a\n\nzoning permit through the administrative, trial, and appellate systems. It is immaterial that\n\nplaintiff withdrew her initial claims on the eve of trial. In fact, it is arguable that to do so\n\nrepresented an appropriate use of court processes: the exercise of a right of withdrawal in order\n\nto prevent unnecessary litigation of weak or frivolous claims.\n\n       \u00b6 26.   With respect to Mr. Weinstein and his law firm, defendants cite three specific\n\nexamples of independent wrongful conduct\u2014in addition to Mr. Weinstein\u2019s representation of\n\nplaintiff in her aforementioned litigation strategies\u2014as evidence of his liability for tortious abuse\n\nof process. First, defendants claim that Mr. Weinstein sent a letter threatening legal action to\n\neach of the defendants, even though he knew each was represented by counsel at the time.\n\nSecond, they allege he threatened legal action on behalf of plaintiff without her knowledge or\n\nauthorization. Finally, they claim that he engaged in target practice with handguns without\n\nwarning to other neighborhood residents the weekend before his and plaintiff\u2019s depositions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f       \u00b6 27.   Not a single one of these occurrences comes close to anything resembling a\n\ncoherent abuse of process claim,4 which, as discussed above, requires proof of improper use of\n\nspecific court processes, rather than a use of the legal system for improper purposes.      Nashef,\n\n947 F. Supp. 2d at 421. None of the occurrences in any way involves a misapplication of court\n\nprocesses; indeed, the target practice incident does not implicate the law. Evidence that Mr.\n\nWeinstein threatened legal action against defendants without Ms. Weinstein\u2019s knowledge stems\n\nentirely from plaintiff\u2019s answer of \u201cNo\u201d to the question \u201cDo you recall threatening to file a\n\nlawsuit for tortious interference with the landscape?\u201d during her deposition. We cannot conclude\n\nthat a negative answer to a question asking about plaintiff\u2019s recollection is sufficient to raise a\n\njury question whether plaintiff authorized Mr. Weinstein\u2019s letter. Lastly, as the trial court noted,\n\nthe appropriate consequence for Mr. Weinstein\u2019s alleged violations of several Vermont Rules of\n\nProfessional Conduct in sending letters to represented parties would be an ethical complaint\n\nunder Rule 10 of Administrative Order 9 or a motion for relief under Vermont Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 11, not a claim for abuse of process. Defendants have done nothing more than allege,\n\nas they term it, Mr. Weinstein\u2019s \u201cintimate, personal involvement in this emotional dispute\n\nbetween neighbors.\u201d While this conduct may be unprofessional, it is not actionable in tort.\n\nTherefore, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Ms. Weinstein, Mr.\n\nWeinstein, and The Weinstein Group, P.C. on the abuse of process claim.\n\n       \u00b6 28.   The third claim on appeal is raised only by defendant Leonard.5 Her claim is that\n\nthe trial court erred in granting summary judgment on defendant Leonard\u2019s counterclaim for\n\n\n       4\n           Indeed, two of the examples defendants cite to support their abuse of process claim\u2014\neffecting service of process on the individual defendants rather than their attorney and the target\npractice\u2014actually formed the basis of their invasion of privacy claim against Mr. Weinstein and\nhis firm in the trial court.\n       5\n            Defendant has raised this claim against plaintiff, Mr. Weinstein and his law firm.\nHowever her brief appeals only with respect to plaintiff. Therefore, we do not address the claim\nwith respect to Mr. Weinstein and his firm, notwithstanding the fact Mr. Weinstein defended\nagainst it on behalf of himself and his law firm in his own brief.\n\n                                                12\n\finvasion of privacy against plaintiff. Because we find that defendant Leonard has not alleged\n\nthat plaintiff\u2019s conduct was sufficiently substantial to satisfy the elements of this tort, we affirm.\n\n        \u00b6 29.   In order to succeed in a claim for intrusion upon seclusion, a plaintiff must show\n\nan \u201cintentional interference with [her] interest in solitude or seclusion, either as to [her] person or\n\nas to [her] private affairs or concerns, of a kind that would be highly offensive to a reasonable\n\n[person].\u201d Hodgdon v. Mt. Mansfield Co., Ins., 160 Vt. 150, 162, 624 A.2d 1122, 1129 (1992)\n\n(quotation omitted). The intrusion \u201cmust be substantial.\u201d Id. See also Restatement (Second) of\n\nTorts \u00a7652B cmt. d (1977) (holding that liability is incurred only when defendant\u2019s conduct is\n\n\u201crepeated with such persistence and frequency as to amount to a course of hounding the\n\nplaintiff\u201d).\n\n        \u00b6 30.   Defendant Leonard has given only two specific examples of plaintiff\u2019s\n\nintentional offensive conduct. First, she alleges that on August 25, 2012, plaintiff \u201choller[ed]\n\nobscenities and bizarre comments\u201d at defendant and her husband as they walked across their\n\nproperty. She then alleges that plaintiff approached defendant and her husband with a \u201cvery\n\nlarge dog\u201d and despite being asked to leave, \u201cphysically confront[ed]\u201d the couple in a \u201cstrange\n\nand threatening manner.\u201d Second, she alleges that plaintiff has made repeated threats of legal\n\naction, using her legal training to \u201cintimidate and harass\u201d defendant and forcing her to incur\n\n\u201csubstantial legal costs\u201d to protect her legal rights.\n\n        \u00b6 31.   Despite how irritating and frightening defendant may have found the dog incident,\n\na single encounter with plaintiff and her dog, even if combined with filings of civil claims or\n\nthreats to file such claims, does not rise to the level of \u201csubstantial . . . interference.\u201d Hodgdon,\n\n160 Vt. at 162, 624 A.2d at 1129. As stated above, there is no evidence plaintiff made illegal,\n\nimproper, or unwarranted use of court processes. See Pion v. Bean, 2003 VT 79, \u00b6 34, 176 Vt. 1,\n\n833 A.2d 1248 (upholding trial court\u2019s conclusion that, absent evidence of false reporting or\n\n\u201cmalicious plan,\u201d legitimate complaints to authorities about suspected legal violations \u201cshould\n\nnot form the basis of an invasion of privacy claim\u201d).\n                                                 13\n\f       \u00b6 32.   Moreover, a handful of minor offenses are insufficient to constitute a tortious\n\nintrusion upon seclusion. Compare Shahi v. Madden, 2008 VT 25, \u00b6 24, 184 Vt. 320, 949 A.2d\n\n1022 (upholding damages award for invasion of privacy where defendant attempted identity\n\ntheft, poisoned family dog, placed live bullets on plaintiffs\u2019 yard, and keyed plaintiffs\u2019 car) and\n\nPion, 2003 VT 79, \u00b6\u00b6 32-36 (evidence showed intentional and substantial intrusion where\n\nplaintiffs called defendants highly offensive names, cut down their trees, filled in their\n\nstreambed, and filed weekly false complaints with health and police departments) with Vermont\n\nIns.
