We find that the record of the hearing on remittitur supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the stop of defendant\u2019s vehicle was based on reasonable suspicion (see People v Sobotker, 43 NY2d 559, 563-564; cf. People v Wilson, 54 AD2d 1116) and that the subsequent pursuit, apprehension, and pat down of defendant when he ran from his car were justified (see Terry v Ohio, 392 US 1). Upon his apprehension defendant consented to the search of his automobile. The ensuing search which produced incriminating evidence constituting probable cause for the arrest was proper. The trial court correctly-refused to suppress defendant\u2019s confession given subsequently at police headquarters. We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the robbery conviction should be reversed and the count dismissed as a lesser included offense of felony murder (see People v Perdue, 70 AD2d 477, 479). The petit larceny conviction, however, is a lesser included offense of robbery and that count is dismissed (see People v Perdue, supra, p 481). (Appeal from judgment of Monroe County Court\u2014murder, second degree, etc.) Present\u2014Hancock, Jr., J. P., Schnepp, Callahan, Doerr and Witmer, JJ.\n",
