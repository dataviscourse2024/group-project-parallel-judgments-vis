            "opinion_text": "\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nMichael F. Urbanski, United States District Judge\nPetitioner Cody Morris Dooley brings this habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, asking the court to vacate or correct his sentence in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Johnson v. United States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). The government has moved to dismiss Dooley\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. The issues have been thoroughly briefed, and the parties appeared before the court for oral argument on November 17, 2016. For the reasons that follow, the court will GRANT Dooley\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition (ECF No. 50) and DENY the government\u2019s motions to dismiss (ECF Nos. 56 &amp; 58).\nI.\nOn December 17, 2013, the court sentenced Dooley to 180 months of incarceration following his guilty plea to a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), charging him with being a felon in possession of a firearm. Because the court determined that Dooley had three or more qualifying convictions under the Armed Career Criminal Act (the \u201cACCA\u201d), he was subject to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months, rather the 120-month maximum sentence otherwise authorized under \u00a7 924(a)(2). The court calculated the sentencing guideline range as being 180 to 188 months and sentenced Dooley to 180 months incarceration. Dooley was remanded to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, where he remains with an estimated release date in June 2026.\nThe Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) prepared in Dooley\u2019s case identifies three qualifying predicate convictions that give rise to the ACCA enhancement: statutory burglary (paragraph 24), possession of marijuana with intent to distribute (paragraph 27), and unlawful wounding (paragraph 31). ECF No. 44, at \u00b6 19. Dooley did not object to the PSR\u2019s conclusion that he qualified as an Armed Career Criminal, subjecting him to \u00a7 924(e)\u2019s 180-month mandatory minimum sentence.\nThe issue now facing this court is whether, following the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in Johnson v. United States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), and Welch v. United States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 1257, 194 L.Ed.2d 387 (2016), Dooley\u2019s ACCA enhancement remains lawful.\nII.\nUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, a federal inmate may move the sentencing court to vacate, set aside, or correct the prisoner\u2019s sentence. Courts may afford relief where *736\u201cthe sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or the laws of the United States.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2255(a). If the court determines the sentence was unlawfully imposed, the court \u201cshall vacate and set the judgment aside and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2255(b).\nA convicted felon found guilty of possessing a firearm faces a maximum sentence of 120 months. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). However, the ACCA provides for a mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months when a defendant was previously convicted of at least three prior serious drug offenses or violent felonies. Id. \u00a7 924(e)(1). A violent felony is defined as:\nAny crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that\u2014\n(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or\n(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a-serious potential risk of-physical injury to another.\nId. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (strikeout added).\nIn 2015, the Supreme Court invalidated the language stricken above after finding it void for vagueness. Johnson v. United States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015) (\u201cJohnson II\u201d).1 Though often parsed into three clauses\u2014 the force clause, the enumerated clause, and the residual clause\u2014\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) is comprised of two numbered subsections. See Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 142-44, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). Specifically, the first subsection states:\n(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (\u201cSubsection (i)\u201d)\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). The second subsection states:\n(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. (\u201cSubsection (ii)\u201d)\nId. Subsection (ii) lists several specific \u201cenumerated offense\u201d crimes\u2014burglary, arson, extortion, and use of explosives\u2014 that amount to violent felonies. Subsection (ii) goes on to encompass any crime that \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of injury.\u201d\nThe second portion of Subsection (ii)\u2014 the part of the statute deemed unconstitutional in Johnson II\u2014is often called the \u201cresidual clause.\u201d The residual clause refers to crimes that are \u201csimilar to the listed examples in some respects but different in others\u2014similar, say in respect to the degree of risk it produces, but different in respect to the \u201cway or manner\u2019 in which it produces that risk.\u201d Begay, 553 U.S. at 144, 128 S.Ct. 1581. Accordingly, a crime, for ACCA purposes, cannot qualify as both an enumerated offense and as a residual offense. Id. A contrary interpretation would read the word \u201cotherwise\u201d out of Subsection (ii). Id. Rather, a predicate conviction is an enumerated offense, a residual offense similar to an enumerated offense, or neither. This understanding of \u00a7 924(e) was confirmed in James v. United States, 550 U.S. 192, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), and aligns with the court\u2019s conclusion in this case.\n*737In James, the Supreme Court determined that neither attempted burglary nor Florida\u2019s burglary statute was properly considered as an enumerated offense under Subsection (ii). Id. at 212-13, 127 S.Ct. 1586. This is so because, as explained below, the enumerated offense of burglary has been defined by the Supreme Court in a manner that is incongruous with the way many states have written their burglary statutes. Because Florida\u2019s version of burglary and attempted burglary did not fall within the definition of generic burglary but posed a degree of risk similar to the ACCA\u2019s enumerated version of burglary, the government could rely \u201con the residual provision of [Subsection (ii)], which\u2014as the court has recognized\u2014can cover conduct that is outside the strict definition of, but nevertheless similar to, generic burglary.\u201d Id.\nThus, when the Court struck down the ACCA\u2019s residual clause in Johnson II, the ACCA enhancement applied in James, based solely on the residual clause, fell as well.2 185 S.Ct. at 2563 (\u201cWe hold that imposing an increased sentence under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act violates the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process. Our contrary holdings in James and Sykes[ v. United States], [564 U.S. 1, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011),] are overruled. Today\u2019s decision does not call into question application of the Act to the four enumerated offenses, or the remainder of the Act\u2019s definition of a violent felony.\u201d).\nWhether the Virginia crime of statutory burglary falls within the enumerated clause portion or the residual clause portion of Subsection (ii) is dispositive in determining whether Johnson II reaches Dooley\u2019s conviction under the ACCA. Because the court determines that Virginia statutory burglary\u2014now and since Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), was decided\u2014does not qualify as one of the enumerated offenses in Subsection (ii) of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), Dooley\u2019s claim is timely, procedurally proper, and unlawful in light of Johnson II.3\nIII.\nThe federal habeas corpus statute under which Dooley seeks relief, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f), contains a one-year statute of limitations. The government argues that Dooley\u2019s habeas petition is untimely as it was not filed within one year of the date his judgment became final. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1). Dooley contends that his petition was timely filed pursuant to \u00a7 2255(f)(3), as he filed it within one year of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Johnson II. Under \u00a7 2255(f)(3), the one-year statute of limitations period begins on \u201cthe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactive applicable to cases on collateral review.\u201d\nThe government responds that Johnson II has nothing to do with Dooley\u2019s case. *738Dooley was convicted of Virginia statutory burglary, which the government contends was an enumerated offense under the ACCA, and Johnson II expressly held that it had no effect on the operation of the enumerated clause.\nBecause, as explained below, statutory burglary in Virginia is broader than Taylor\u2019s definition of generic burglary, Dooley\u2019s statutory burglary conviction could have been deemed a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA only by way of the residual clause. Dooley\u2019s residual clause enhancement was not subject to attack until Johnson II was decided, after which he had one year to file his \u00a7 2255 claim.\nIV.\nThe government next argues that Dooley\u2019s claim is procedurally defaulted because he did not previously preserve the issue. Dooley argues that default does not bar consideration of his Johnson II claim because he satisfies the cause and prejudice standard under Supreme Court precedent.\nGenerally speaking, a petitioner cannot raise an argument in a post-conviction proceeding that he did not raise earlier on direct appeal. See, e.g., Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548 U.S. 331, 351, 126 S.Ct. 2669, 165 L.Ed.2d 557 (2006) (citing Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003), and Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 621, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998)). However, courts may excuse procedural default where a defendant is able to demonstrate \u201c\u2018cause\u2019 and actual \u2018prejudice.\u2019 \u201d Bousley, 523 U.S. at 622, 118 S.Ct. 1604 (citing Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 485, 106 S.Ct. 2678, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986), and Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 87, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977)).\nFor the same reason that Dooley\u2019s claim is timely, he meets the cause requirement of procedural default. In short, because he could not challenge his sentence under the ACCA until Johnson II was decided, cause exists.\nIn Murray, the Supreme Court noted that cause, as could excuse procedural default, requires \u201csome objective factor external to the defense [that] impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply\u201d with the procedural requirements to raise a claim. 477 U.S. at 488, 106 S.Ct. 2678. While Murray did not provide \u201can exhaustive catalog of such objective impediments,\u201d it noted \u201cthat a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel\u201d could constitute the required objective impediment. Id. (citing Reed v. Ross, 468 U.S. 1, 16, 104 S.Ct. 2901, 82 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984)). Reed holds that cause is established \u201cwhere a constitutional claim is so novel that its legal basis is not reasonably available to counsel.\u201d 468 U.S. at 16, 104 S.Ct. 2901. In that discussion, Reed described three examples of such novelty:\nFirst, a decision of this Court may explicitly overrule one of our precedents. Second, a decision may overturn] a longstanding and widespread practice to which this Court has not spoken, but which a near-unanimous body of lower court authority has expressly approved. And, finally, a decision may disapproval a practice this Court arguably has sanctioned in prior cases.\nId. at 17 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Reed noted that when a case falls into one of the first two categories and is given retroactive effect, \u201cthere will almost certainly have been no reasonable basis upon which an attorney previously could\u201d have made the defaulted argument. Id. \u201cConsequently, the failure of a defendant\u2019s attorney to have pressed such a claim before a state court is sufficiently excusable to satisfy the cause requirement.\u201d Id.\n*739Until the Supreme Court overruled James in Johnson II, Dooley had no ability to raise a challenge to his ACCA conviction. The James Court rejected a suggestion raised by Justice Scalia\u2019s dissent that the residual clause was unconstitutionally vague,- \"While ACCA requires judges to make sometimes difficult evaluations of the risks posed by different offenses, we are not persuaded by Justice Scalia\u2019s suggestion\u2014which was not pressed by James or his amici\u2014that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague.\u201d James, 550 U.S. at 210 n.6, 127 S.Ct. 1586. Between James and Johnson II, the Court continued to consider the application of the residual clause to a variety of state crimes, effectively precluding any constitutional challenge to it. See Sykes, 564 U.S. at 12-16, 131 S.Ct. 2267; Chambers v. United States, 555 U.S. 122, 127-30, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009); Begay, 553 U.S. at 145-48, 128 S.Ct. 1581. The court thus finds that the legal basis for Dooley\u2019s claim was not reasonably available to him before Johnson II was decided, establishing the cause element excusing his procedural default.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the court distinguishes the novelty of the challenge made available only after Johnson II was decided with the frequently litigated issue facing the Court in Bousley, upon which the government relies, as to whether mere possession of a firearm constituted use under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). There the Court noted that:\nThe argument that it was error for the District Court to misinform petitioner as to the statutory elements of \u00a7 924(c)(1) was most surely not a novel one. Indeed, at the time of petitioner\u2019s plea, the Federal Reporters were replete with cases involving challenges to the notion that \u201cuse\u201d is synonymous with mere \u201cpossession.\"\nBousley, 523 U.S. at 622, 118 S.Ct. 1604 (internal citations omitted). To support its holding that futility cannot constitute cause, the Bousley court quoted Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 130 n.35, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982), for the proposition that \u201cfutility cannot constitute cause if it means simply that a claim was \u2018unacceptable to that particular court at that particular time.\u201d \u2019 But this case is a far cry from Engle. There the defendants did not. object to a jury instruction that required the defendant in an Ohio murder case to prove self-defense. The Court noted that its decision in In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), decided four and one-half years before the first of defendants\u2019 criminal trials, \u201claid the basis for their constitutional claim,\u201d that the prosecution should bear the burden of disproving an affirmative defense. Engle, 456 U.S. at 131, 102 S.Ct. 1558. \u201cWhere the basis of a constitutional claim is available, and other defense counsel have perceived and litigated that claim, the demands of comity and finality counsel against labeling alleged unawareness of the objection as cause for procedural default.\u201d Id. at 134, 102 S.Ct. 1558.4\nNor does this case resemble the circumstances facing the Fourth Circuit in United States v. Pettiford, 612 F.3d 270 (4th Cir. 2010). There, defendant had at the time of sentencing a basis to challenge two of his predicate convictions, yet chose not to do so. Nothing about Pettiford\u2019s subsequent habeas challenge to those convictions concerned the situation presented here, where the claim springs from a novel change of law made retroactive by the Supreme Court on collateral review. In *740short, while the circumstances establishing cause in Reed were not available to Petti-ford, they exist here.\nThe government likewise argues that the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion in United States v. Mikalajunas, 186 F.3d 490 (4th Cir. 1999), supports a finding of no cause here. As with Pettiford, however, Mikalajunas did not involve a right newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. Rather, it concerned an argument on an unsettled area of law which counsel either did not recognize or chose not to pursue at sentencing. Id. at 493.\nUnlike the circumstances in Bousley, Engle, Pettiford, and Mikalajunas, the bolt of lightning from the clear blue sky that struck down the residual clause in Johnson II was so novel that it was not reasonably available to counsel. As such, it constitutes cause to excuse procedural default.\nDooley also easily meets the prejudice requirement. To show prejudice, a petitioner need show only that without an error, the proceedings would have been different. Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 289, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). In this case, had the sentencing court not applied the ACCA enhancement, Dooley\u2019s statutory maximum penalty would have been only 120 months, as opposed to the 180-month sentence he received following enhancement under the ACCA. Plainly, Dooley has established that the alleged error in his sentence worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage sufficient to establish prejudice. United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 170, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982).\nAccordingly, the court concludes that Dooley\u2019s petition is not barred as untimely or procedurally defaulted.\nV.\nBefore turning to the crime of Virginia statutory burglary at issue here, it is necessary to set the analytical stage. The categorical and modified categorical approaches\u2014the only analytical tools district courts wield to determine whether prior convictions amount to violent felonies under the ACCA\u2014were forged in Taylor, 495 U.S. at 600-01, 110 S.Ct. 2143. See Mathis v. United States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 2243, 2251, 195 L.Ed.2d 604 (2016) (\u201cTaylor set out the essential rule governing ACCA cases more than a quarter of century ago. All that counts under the Act, we held then, are the \u2018elements of the statute of conviction.\u201d \u2019). Thus, since Taylor, courts must begin with the statute of conviction\u2019s elements to determine if it aligns with the generic offense.\nAs to the variant of the categorical approach known as the \u201cmodified categorical approach,\u201d the Supreme Court allows sentencing courts to consult a limited class of documents to determine which of the alternative crimes within a statute a defendant was convicted. See Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (\u201cWe hold that enquiry under the ACCA to determine whether a plea of guilty to burglary defined by a nongeneric statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\u201d).\nThe Supreme Court has recently twice reversed courts that have misused this approach and improperly consulted Shepard documents to glean facts related to underlying convictions. See Mathis, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 2243, 195 L.Ed.2d 604; Descamps v. United States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). *741Both Mathis5 and Descamps6 make clear that they are neither changing nor supplementing the modified categorical approach, merely correcting courts that have misapplied Taylor.\nIn Descamps, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that district courts could apply the modified categorical approach to California\u2019s burglary statute. 133 S.Ct. at 2293. The Court emphasized that Taylor only allowed application of the modified categorical approach to the \u201ckind of statute [that] sets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative.\u201d Id. at 2281. Where \u201cone alternative (say, a building) matches an element in the generic offense, but the other (say, an automobile) does not, the modified categorical approach permits sentencing courts to consult a limited class of documents, such as indictments and jury instructions, to determine which alternative formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction.\u201d Id. The Supreme Court explained that the district court and the court of appeals improperly employed the modified categorical, approach to a statute that was simply broader than generic burglary, rather than comprised of multiple crimes. Id. at 2287-91. The Court emphasized that consultation of Shepard documents is only appropriate to determine which of the alternate crimes within a statute the defendant was convicted, not to glean the actual facts giving rise to the conviction. Id In Descamps, facts showing the defendant\u2019s actions were within the bounds of generic burglary were irrelevant because California\u2019s burglary statute was overbroad, as it encompassed both lawful and unlawful entry with the intent to commit a crime. Id. at 2288-89. Where underlying crimes categorically are not violent felonies, district courts are precluded from using the modified categorical approach to determine whether the underlying convictions happen to fall within the generic offense. Id.\nMathis, the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent opinion on the modified categorical approach, again reversed a decision that violated Taylor\u2019s instruction. 136 S.Ct. at 2257. In Mathis, the Court addressed the divisibility of statutes. Id. at 2248-50. Divi*742sible statutes are those that include differing, alternative elements that must -be proven to sustain a conviction. Id. Such statutes allow use of the modified categorical approach as they include multiple crimes. Id. However, statutes that merely contemplate alternative means of accomplishing a single crime are not divisible. Id. Rather, such statutes remain indivisible and, under Taylor, are subject only to a purely categorical analysis. Id. Mathis addressed Iowa\u2019s burglary statute which encompassed unlawful entry of \u201cany building, structure, or land, water or air vehicle.\u201d Id. at 2250 (emphasis and brackets omitted) (quoting Iowa Code \u00a7 702.12). After consulting case law from Iowa\u2019s highest court, the Supreme Court concluded that the locations listed in the statute were alternate means of fulfilling the locational element. Id. Such alternate means did not permit use of the modified categorical approach and rendered the statute overbroad under the categorical approach. As will be explained, Mathis compels the same result here.\nVI.\nPursuant to Taylor, 495 U.S. at 600-01, 110 S.Ct. 2143, the court .first turns to Virginia\u2019s statutory framework to determine whether Dooley\u2019s offense of conviction aligns with the generic burglary offense enumerated in the ACCA.\nVirginia\u2019s most basic burglary statute, essentially codifying the common law, makes it unlawful for any person to \u201cbreak and enter the dwelling house of another in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony or any larceny therein....\u201d Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-89.\nThe next two sections of Virginia\u2019s criminal code contain two versions of statutory burglary, expanding common law \u201cburglary to include other structures.\u201d Allard v. Commonwealth, 24 Va.App. 57, 64, 480 S.E.2d 139 (1997). The first iteration, found in Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-90, has changed over the years. The version of \u00a7 18.2-90 in force at the time of Dooley\u2019s conviction in 2005 states as follows:\n\u00a7 18.2-90. Entering dwelling house, etc., with intent to commit murder, rape, robbery or arson; penalty.\u2014If any person in the nighttime enters without breaking or in the daytime breaks and enters or enters and conceals himself in a' dwelling house or an adjoining, occupied outhouse or in the nighttime enters without breaking or at any time breaks and enters or enters and conceals himself in any building permanently affixed to realty, or any ship, vessel or river craft or any railroad car, or any automobile, truck or trailer, if such automobile, truck or trailer is used as a dwelling or place of human habitation, with intent to commit murder, rape, robbery or arson in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 18;2-77, 18.2-79 or \u00a7 18.2-80, he shall be deemed guilty of statutory burglary, which offense shall be a Class 3 felony. However, if such person was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of such entry, he shall be guilty of a Class 2 felony.\nDooley was not convicted of either Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-89 or 18.2-90, but rather of a third Virginia burglary statute, Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-91. At the time of his conviction, that statute read:'\n\u00a7 18.2-91. Entering dwelling house, etc., with intent to commit larceny, assault and battery or other felony.\u2014 If any person commits any of the. acts mentioned in \u00a7 18.2-90 with intent to commit larceny, or any felony other than murder, rape, robbery or arson in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-77, 18.2-79 or \u00a7 18.2-80, or if any person commits any of the acts mentioned in \u00a7 18.2-89 - or \u00a7 18.2-90 with intent to commit'assault and battery, he shall be guilty of statutory burglary, punishable by confinement in a *743state correctional facility for not less than one or more than twenty years or, in the discretion of the jury or the court trying the case without a jury, be confined in jail for a period not exceeding twelve months or fined not more than $2,500, either or both. However, if the person was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of such entry, he shall be guilty of a Class 2 felony.\nAs evident from the statutory language, all of these Virginia burglary statutes share three common elements: (1) an unlawful or unprivileged entry; (2) into a covered location; and (3) with the intent to commit a crime.7\nA.\nIn Taylor, 495 U.S. at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, the Supreme Court defined generic burglary\u2014burglary that qualifies as a violent felony under the enumerated clause of the ACCA\u2014as \u201can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d In so holding, the Court noted that state crimes that allowed for burglary of places other than buildings, such as automobiles, swept more broadly than generic burglary, and were thus excluded from the definition of generic burglary. Id. at 591, 110 S.Ct. 2143. As the Fourth Circuit recently explained in United States v. White, 836 F.3d 437, 445 (4th Cir. 2016):\nGeneric burglary\u2019s \u201cbuilding or other structure\u201d element does not encompass every enclosure. For example, in Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 15-16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the Supreme Court stated that the generic offense refers to burglary \u201ccommitted in a building or enclosed space ... not in boat or motor vehicle.\u201d Similarly, the Supreme Court recently found an Iowa burglary statute to encompass conduct outside the bounds of generic burglary because the statute specified that the crime could occur in a \u201cland, water, or air vehicle.\u201d Mathis, 136 S.Ct. at 2250 (quoting Iowa Code \u00a7 702.12 (2013)); see also Taylor, 495 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (describing a state burglary offense that prohibited breaking and entering \u201cany booth or tent, or any boat or vessel, or railroad car\u201d as non-generic burglary (quoting Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 560.070 (1969) (repealed))).\nCommon law burglary, as codified in Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-89, limits the locational element of \u00a7 18.2-89 to dwelling houses. As such, it squarely falls within Taylor\u2019s definition of generic burglary and qualifies as a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e).\nThe next two versions of statutory burglary, Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-90 and 18.2-91, share two elements\u2014unlawful or unauthorized entry and location\u2014and differ only as to the intent necessary to violate the statute. As in Mathis, the issue here is whether the locational element of Virginia statutory burglary as set forth in Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-90 is broader than generic burglary.8\nWhen viewed through the lens of the categorical approach, there is no doubt that Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-90 sweeps more broadly than Taylor\u2019s definition of generic burglary. For example, the version of \u00a7 18.2-90 violated by Dooley encompasses *744criminal activity that occurs in \u201cany ship, vessel or river craft or any railroad car, or any automobile, truck or trailer, if such automobile, truck or trailer is used a dwelling or place of human habitation.\u201d Such language categorically takes \u00a7 18.2-90 beyond generic burglary.\nB.\nHowever, as noted above, where a statute consists of multiple crimes, some of which rise to the level of an ACCA violent felony and some of which do not, the court is permitted to apply the modified categorical approach. Before invoking the modified categorical approach, the court must decide the threshold question of whether \u00a7 18.2-90 is divisible in a legally significant way. In this case, the principal question raised by the parties is whether the disjunctive list of locations contained in \u00a7 18.2-90 amounts to alternative elements constituting different crimes or merely multiple means of committing a single crime. If the statute describes multiple crimes, the court must then determine if any of the crimes amount to generic burglary and thus qualify as ACCA predicates. As the Fourth Circuit noted in United States v. Cabrera-Umanzor, 728 F.3d 347, 352 (4th Cir. 2013) (emphasis omitted):\nGeneral divisibility, however, is not enough; a statute is divisible for purposes of applying the modified categorical approach only if at least one of the categories into which the statute may be divided constitutes, by its elements, a violent felony. See Descamps, 133 S.Ct. at 2285 (explaining that the modified categorical approach provides a \u201cmechanism\u201d for comparing the prior conviction to the generic offense \u201cwhen a statute lists multiple, alternative elements, and so effectively creates several different crimes.... [and] at least one, but not all of those crimes matches the generic version\u201d [ ]); [United States v.] Gomez, 690 F.3d [194,] 199 [(4th Cir. 2012)] (\u201c[C]ourts may apply the modified categorical approach to a statute only if it contains divisible categories of proscribed conduct, at least one of which constitutes\u2014by its elements\u2014a [qualifying conviction].\u201d).\nThe court concludes that Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-90 does not create several different crimes. Rather, its locational element sets forth alternative places where the single crime of statutory burglary may be committed. There is no difference in statutory penalties for unlawful entry into the alternative locations listed in the statute. As such, Mathis requires that the court consider these alternative locations as means by which the singular crime of statutory burglary may be committed, rather than elements of separate crimes. Accordingly, the court is not permitted to use the modified categorical approach.\n1.\nDistrict courts must consult state law to determine whether a disjunctive list in a state statute amounts to means or elements. Mathis, 136 S.Ct. at 2256. A number of Virginia appellate decisions address whether certain places fall within the locations set forth in \u00a7 18.2-90, but none squarely answer the means/element inquiry posed in Mathis. For example, in Dalton v. Commonwealth, 14 Va.App. 544, 418 S.E.2d 563 (1992), the court addressed the question whether a fenced area that was used to store repaired lawn mowers was a storehouse as that term is used in the statute. Citing Compton v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 48, 55 S.E.2d 446 (Va. Ct. App. 1949), concerning a chicken house, Graybeal v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 736, 324 S.E.2d 698 (1985), concerning mobile homes or trailers used for resale or display, and Crews v. Commonwealth, 3 Va.App. 531, 352 S.E.2d 1 (1987), concerning a *745school bus converted for storage, the Dalton court held that in order for a structure to be the subject of burglary, it must be affixed to the ground and have walls and a roof. The court has considered whether the requirement that a structure be affixed to the ground constitutes an element. But based on Mathis, the court does not read these cases to create separate crimes with separate elements. One does not commit a different crime under this statute by breaking into a storehouse as opposed to an office or a ship.9 Rather, these are alternative places\u2014or \u201cmeans\u201d in Mathis\u2019 parlance\u2014to commit the same crime. \u2022 In other words, there is no elemental difference between burglary of a storehouse versus burglary of an office or ship. That is the teaching of Mathis.\n2.\nMathis, of course, dealt with the Iowa burglary statute and determined that the places listed in the statute where burglary may occur amount to \u201cbrute facts\u201d or \u201cmeans\u201d of committing a singular crime, rather than elements creating separate crimes. The Court gave weight to how Iowa courts viewed the various places listed in the statute, citing two cases, State v. Duncan, 312 N.W.2d 519, 523 (Iowa 1981), and State v. Rooney, 862 N.W.2d 367, 376 (Iowa 2015).\nVincent Duncan was charged with committing one count of Iowa second degree burglary. The first question considered by the Iowa Supreme Court was whether Duncan could be charged with burglary as to a marina and a boat located therein in a single count. The court held \u201cthat the occasion involving burglary of the marina and the boat could be charged as one burglary consisting of the marina and boat conjunc-tively or alternatively and could be correspondingly submitted to the jury.\u201d Duncan, 312 N.W.2d at 523. As to whether the jury must agree on whether the marina was burgled as opposed to the boat, the Iowa court stated:\nAt this point another principle' intervenes. \u201cIt is not necessary that a jury, in order to find a verdict, should concur in a single view of the transaction disclosed by the evidence. If the conclusion may be justified upon either of two interpretations of the evidence, the verdict cannot be impeached by showing that a part of the jury proceeded upon one interpretation and part upon another.\u201d People v. Sullivan, 173 N.Y. 122, 127, 65 N.E. 989, 989 (1903). Stated differently, \u201c(I)f substantial evidence is presented to support each alternative method of committing a single crime, and the alternatives are not'repugnant to each other, then unanimity of the jury as to the mode of commission of the crime is not required.\u201d State v. Arndt, 12 Wash.App. 248, 252, 529 P.2d 887, 889 (1974). See also 75 Am. Jur. 2d Trial \u00a7 884, at 760 (1974) (\u201cA conviction will not be set aside because of an instruction which permits a conviction notwithstanding a difference between jurors as to which of two contradictory facts, each consistent with guilt, is established by the evidence.\u201d); Annot., 72 A.L.R. 154 (1931)....\nId. at 523-24.\nRooney involved burglary of a condemned house scheduled for demolition. *746The Supreme Court of Iowa, addressing the locational aspect of the Iowa burglary-statute, stated \u201c[i]t is true that the legislature has broadly phrased the element of place and we, as a result, have found the element satisfied in a wide variety of contexts,\u201d 862 N.W.2d at 376. The same is true in Virginia.\nIndeed, an examination of the Iowa and Virginia decisions concerning the place or locational element of each state\u2019s statute yields no material difference, suggesting that the Mathis Court\u2019s, conclusion as to Iowa applies to Virginia as well. For example, compare the Iowa decision in State v. Hill, 449 N.W.2d 626, 628 (Iowa 1989), with the Virginia decision in Dalton, 418 S.E.2d at 563. Hill was convicted of stealing pistons from a fenced enclosure behind an auto parts store. The Iowa court considered whether the fenced enclosure fell within the definition of an appurtenance under the Iowa statute. Just as the Virginia court in Dalton decided that the fenced area containing lawn mowers fell within the definition of a storehouse under the Virginia statute, the Iowa court in Hill determined that the fenced area containing pistons fell within the definition of an appurtenance under the Iowa statute. Because these Virginia and Iowa decisions so closely track each other as to the proof required to satisfy the locational element, it stands to reason that the conclusion of the Mathis Court that the list of locations contained in the Iowa burglary statute are best considered as \u201cbrute facts\u201d or \u201cmeans,\u201d rather than elements, applies as well in Virginia.\n3.\nThe Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s decision in Graybeal v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 736, 324 S.E.2d 698 (1985), provides an instructive contrast, Graybeal concerned whether the final portion of the list of locations in Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-90\u2014\u201cany automobile, truck or trailer\u201d\u2014contains an added proof requirement. Specifically, Graybeal makes it clear that to sustain a conviction for breaking and entering into an automobile, truck or trailer under \u00a7 18.2-90, the statute provides that the prosecution had to meet the requirements of the statute and prove that the trailer was used as a dwelling or place of human habitation. Id. at 739, 324 S.E.2d at 699; see Allard, 480 S.E.2d at 142 (\u201cWith respect to structures other than a dwelling house of another, the legislature specifically chose to impose the habitability element only for automobiles, trucks or trailers.\u201d). Thus Graybeal commands the conclusion that breaking and entering an automobile, truck or .trailer is not merely an alternative means of violating \u00a7 18.2-90, Rather, a burglary conviction under \u00a7 18.2-90 for breaking and entering an automobile, truck or trailer requires additional proof\u2014 use as a dwelling or place, of human habitation\u2014not applicable to other locations listed in the statute. But that difference is of no consequence to the court\u2019s conclusion that the ACCA enhancement does not apply. Burglaries of automobiles, trucks, or trailers, clearly do not align with generic burglary. The remainder of \u00a7 18.2-90 encompasses burglaries of ships, vessels, and railroad cars, among other structures. Thus, the locales .subject to burglary in \u00a7 18.2-90 and described in Graybeal\u2014 those that require proof of use as a dwelling or for human habitation and those that do not\u2014both are categorically broader than generic burglary. As such, the court cannot employ the modified categorical approach. Cabrera-Umanzor, 728 F.3d at 352.\nThe court is mindful of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding in United States v. Foster, 662 F.3d 291 (4th Cir. 2011). In Foster, the Fourth Circuit determined that \u00a7 18.2-90 was divisible into three clauses:\nThe relevant Virginia statute defined breaking and entering as a crime under three separate clauses: (1) an \u201coffice, *747shop ,.. storehouse, warehouse, banking house, or other house\u201d; (2) a \u201cship, vessel, or river craft or any railroad car\u201d; or (3) \u201cany automobile, truck, or trailer ... [being] used as a dwelling or place of human habitation.\u201d Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-90 (1992) (amended 2004).\nId. at 293-94. After considering Graybeal\u2019s holding that convictions under the third clause required an added proof requirement, the Fourth Circuit concluded that it could employ the modified categorical approach to determine which of the three clauses was invoked in the underlying conviction. Id. at 294-95. But Foster was decided before Descamps and Mathis were decided, and the Court\u2019s subsequent decisions in Descamps and Mathis strongly counsel against use of the modified categorical approach here.\nThis conclusion is bolstered by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s more recent decision in United States v. Henriquez, 757 F.3d 144 (4th Cir. 2014). In Henriquez, the Fourth Circuit held that first degree Maryland burglary was broader than generic burglary and thus was not a proper predicate to support a sentencing enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). Although the Maryland statute in question limited burglary to breaking and entering \u201cthe dwelling of another with the intent to commit theft or a crime of violence,\u201d Md. Code Ann. Crim. Law \u00a7 6-202(a), the Fourth Circuit found there to be \u201ca realistic probability that Maryland\u2019s statute covers burglaries of motor vehicles or boats\u2014places that the United States Supreme Court has expressly excluded from generic burglary.\u201d Henriquez, 757 F.3d at 146. The Fourth Circuit in Henriquez \u201cemploy[ed] the categorical approach here because the crime of which the defendant was convicted has a single, indivisible set of elements.\u201d Id. at 147 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Descamps, 133 S.Ct. at 2282).10 The court\u2019s decision also finds support in the Seventh Circuit\u2019s post-Mathis decision in United States v. Edwards, 836 F.3d 831, 838 (7th Cir. 2016), where the Seventh Circuit found the list of locations in the Wisconsin burglary statute to be \u201calternative means rather than elements and [ ] therefore indivisible.\u201d But see United States v. Gundy, 842 F.3d 1156 (11th Cir. 2016) (finding, by a divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit, that the Georgia burglary statute is divisible and applying the modified categorical approach).\nVirginia Code \u00a7 18.2-90 is far broader than generic burglary. The most obvious examples of this overbreadth fall at the end of the list. Plainly, unlawful entry of automobiles, trucks and trailers is broader than generic burglary. So, too, with unauthorized entry into ships, vessels, river craft or any railroad car. While the part of the list that covers various types of buildings falls within the bounds of generic burglary, Mathis does not permit the court to divide the statute into separate crimes based on those locales. Accordingly, the court cannot employ the modified categorical approach to determine the specific facts surrounding Dooley\u2019s conviction,11\n*7484.\nThe court has considered whether \u00a7 18.2-90 is divisible based on the time of day of the offense. That is because \u00a7 18.2-90 only encompasses breaking and entering or entering and concealing a dwelling house or adjoining outhouse in the daytime as opposed to breaking and entering or entering and concealing the other locations listed in the statute at any time. In Griffin v. Commonwealth, 13 Va.App. 409, 412 S.E.2d 709, 711 (1991), the court stated:\nThus, whenever there is ... intent, the timing of the offense is not an essential element of the offense. Since breaking and entering of a dwelling, at any time, is the essential element of the offense, the indictment\u2019s allegation that the offense occurred in the daytime is nothing more than surplusage.\nLikewise, there is no merit to the argument, albeit unstated, that the term \u201cdwelling house\u201d used in the first part of the statute adds an element. Although the term \u201cdwelling house\u201d has been defined to mean a place human beings regularly use for sleeping, Turner v. Commonwealth, 33 Va.App. 88, 531 S.E.2d 619 (2000), Griffin holds that it is subsumed within the term \u201cother house,\u201d as it \u201cnecessarily includes any such structure used as a dwelling.\u201d Id.\nAccordingly, Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-90, taken as a whole, has never qualified as a violent felony under the enumerated clause as it does not square with generic burglary. Rather, Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-90 has only qualified as an ACCA predicate by way of the now-defunct residual clause. As Johnson II and Welch make clear, federal inmates whose sentences were enhanced as a result of the residual clause are entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255.12\nVII.\nBecause Dooley\u2019s Virginia burglary conviction\u2014now and since Taylor\u2014only qualifies as a predicate felony by way of the residual clause, Dooley\u2019s claim is cognizable under Johnson II and his ACCA sentence must be vacated. In short, given the constraints of the categorical approach imposed by Mathis, the court cannot conclude that Dooley\u2019s prior statutory burglary conviction meets Taylor\u2019s definition of generic burglary.13 Pursuant to Johnson *749II, the court finds that the 180-month sentence Dooley received is unconstitutional, as it is, greater than the 120-month maximum penalty set forth in \u00a7 924(a)(2). As such, Dooley\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is GRANTED, and the government\u2019s motions to dismiss are DENIED.\nAn appropriate Order will be entered.\n\n. The court refers to the 2015 Johnson decision as \"Johnson H\u201d to distinguish it from the Supreme Court\u2019s earlier decision in Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), concerning the force clause of \u00a7 924(e).\n\n\n. The fact that Johnson II struck down the ACCA enhancement in James, founded as it was solely on the residual clause, does not affect the validity of the reasoning in James addressed above, that the Florida burglary and attempted burglary statutes fell outside the enumerated clause.\n\n\n. Dooley argues in his \u00a7 2255 motion that neither his Virginia statutory burglary conviction nor his unlawful wounding conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA in Johnson II. The court need not address whether Dooley\u2019s unlawful wounding conviction qualifies as violent felony under \u00a7 924(e) for purpose of the ACCA enhancement, however, because the issue is resolved by the court's analysis as to Dooley\u2019s statutory burglary conviction.\n\n\n. The Court in Reed expressly distinguished the factual setting of Engle for the same reason. Reed, 468 U.S. at 19-20, 104 S.Ct. 2901.\n\n\n. Mathis stated:\n\"[T]he only [use of that approach] we have ever allowed,\u201d we stated a few Terms ago, is to determine \u201cwhich elements] played a part in the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d Descamps, 570 U.S., at -, 133 S. Ct., at 2283, 2285 (emphasis added); see Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143 (noting that the modified approach may be employed only to determine whether \"a jury necessarily had to find\u201d each element of generic burglary).\n136 S.Ct. at 2253.\n\n\n. Descamps stated the following:\nOur caselaw explaining the categorical approach and its \"modified\u201d counterpart all but resolves this case. In those decisions, as shown below, the modified approach serves a limited function: It helps effectuate the categorical analysis when a divisible statute, listing potential offense elements in the alternative, renders opaque which element played a part in the defendant\u2019s conviction. So understood, the modified approach cannot convert Descamps' conviction under \u00a7 459 into an ACCA predicate, because that state law defines burglaty not alternatively, but only more broadly than the generic offense.\n[[Image here]]\nTaylor recognized a \"narrow range of cases\u201d in which sentencing courts\u2014applying what we would later dub the \"modified categorical approach\u201d\u2014may look beyond the statutory elements to \"the charging paper and jury instructions\u201d used in a case. Id., at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143.\n[[Image here]]\nHence Taylor permitted sentencing courts, as a tool for implementing the categorical approach, to examine a limited class of documents to determine which of a statute\u2019s alternative elements formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction.\n133 S.Ct. at 2283-84.\n\n\n. A fourth Virginia burglary statute, \u00a7 18.2\u2014 92, not applicable here, also shares these elements and makes it unlawful to break and enter into an occupied dwelling with the intent to commit other misdemeanors. See Johnson v. Commonwealth, 18 Va.App. 441, 444 S.E.2d 559, 561-62 (1994).\n\n\n. While Dooley was convicted of a violation of Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-91, that statute makes it unlawful to commit any of the acts mentioned in \u00a7 18.2-90, albeit with different intent. As such, the court\u2019s analysis must focus on \u00a7 18.2-90.\n\n\n. Many years ago, the Supreme Court of Virginia stated just that.\nUnder Code, \u00a7\u00a7 18-160 and 18-161 [predecessor burglary statutes], housebreaking or storebreaking, as a'consummated crime, includes both a nighttime entry without breaking and a breaking and entry in the daytime or. nighttime, under stated conditions, as precisely the same felony. There is no distinction in the degree or class of crime or in the measure of its punishment.\nWilloughby v. Smyth, 194 Va. 267, 271, 72 S.E.2d 636, 638 (1952).\n\n\n. The Fourth Circuit in United States v. White, 836 F.3d at 444, also recently used the categorical approach to analyze the application of \u00a7 924(e) to the West Virginia burglary statute. However, it declined to express an opinion whether the alternative locations specified in the West Virginia statute rendered it divisible for the purposes of applying the modified categorical approach as that issue was neither argued nor addressed by the parties in their briefs. Id. at 446 n.3.\n\n\n. Near the end of the majority opinion, the Mathis Court suggests that \"if state law fails to provide clear answers,\u201d federal judges may \"peek at the record documents ... for the sole and limited purpose of determining whether the listed items are elements of the offense.\u201d Mathis, 136 S.Ct. at 2256-57 (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted) (quoting Rendor v. Holder, 782 F.3d 466, 473-74 (9th Cir. 2015)) (opinion dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). The court *748has reviewed the available record documents that concern the statutory burglary conviction set forth in paragraph 24 of the PSR. The indictment charges that \"Cody Morris Dooley, did unlawfully and feloniously break and enter the dwelling house of Christy Dawn Scott, located at 3757 Evan Lane, with intent to commit larceny.\u201d Were the court to apply the modified categorical approach in this case, it would conclude that the offense of conviction aligns with the generic burglary offense enumerated in the ACCA. However, the purpose of this \"peek\u201d at the record documents is to answer the threshold question of whether the statute is divisible, such that the court is permitted to apply the modified categorical approach. As to this issue, the record documents provide no clue helpful to deciphering whether the listed location is a means or an element.\n\n\n. The court has considered whether, without the 2005 statutory burglary conviction, Dooley\u2019s record retains three convictions that might enhance his sentenced under the ACCA. United States v. Pettiford, 612 F.3d 270, 275-80 (4th Cir. 2010). The court concludes it does not. Assuming without deciding that Dooley's possession of marijuana with intent to distribute conviction (paragraph 27 of the PSR) and unlawful wounding conviction (paragraph 31 of the PSR) qualify as ACCA predicates, as the PSR determined, Dooley\u2019s remaining convictions all appear to be misdemeanors. Thus, Dooley does not have \"three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense\u201d that would give rise to an enhanced penalty under \u00a7 924(e).\n\n\n. Given the difficulties inherent in deciphering the distinction between elements and means, the court views the analysis in this case to be anything but, in Mathis' terms, \"easy.\u201d 136 S.Ct. at 2256. Compare, for example, the Descamps Court\u2019s description of a divisible statute as being the kind of statute *749that \u201csets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative\u2014for example, stating that burglary involves entry into a building or an automobile,\u201d 133 S.Ct. at 2281, with the conclusion in Mathis that a similar list of places in the Iowa statute, \u201cany building, structure, [or] land, water or air vehicle\u201d \"are not alternative ' elements, going toward the creation of separate crimes.\u201d 136 U.S. at 2250. At the end of the day, the court, bound by Mathis, is constrained to grant Dooley\u2019s petition. At the same time, the court shares the \"general concern\u201d explained by Judge Wilkinson in his concurring opinion in United States v. Doctor, 842 F.3d 306, 313 (4th Cir. 2016) (slip op.) \"that the categorical approach to predicate crimes of violence is moving beyond what the Supreme Court originally anticipated.\u201d\n\n",
