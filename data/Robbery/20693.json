Carl Gaeth was employed as a sales manager at\nOracle Corp. from 1986 until 1989. As a result of serious medical conditions, he began receiving\nlong-term disability payments in 1989. Oracle subsequently discovered that Gaeth was operating\nan antique-lamp restoration business, and surveillance video showed him moving about without\napparent difficulty. The plan administrator, Hartford Life Insurance Co., determined that Gaeth was\nno longer totally disabled and terminated his benefits in 1997.\n       Gaeth challenged that decision in court. The federal district court found that Hartford\u2019s\ndetermination was arbitrary and capricious because it was not supported by any medical evidence\nof Gaeth\u2019s physical condition. It therefore remanded the case to Hartford for further consideration.\n\n        *\n          The Honorable Jack Zouhary, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\n\n                                                       1\n\fNo. 06-6490               Gaeth v. Hartford Life Insurance Co.                                 Page 2\n\n\nThe court also awarded attorney fees to Gaeth, even though it did not find that Gaeth is still entitled\nto disability benefits under the plan. Hartford has appealed only the award of attorney fees. For the\nreasons set forth below, we VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment awarding attorney fees and\nREMAND the case for reconsideration of that issue.\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\nA.     Factual background\n        The basic facts of this case are undisputed by the parties. Gaeth was a sales manager for\nOracle beginning in 1986. After experiencing a series of health problems, he was deemed totally\ndisabled under Oracle\u2019s employee welfare benefit plan and was approved for long-term disability\nbenefits in February of 1989. Oracle\u2019s plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security\nAct (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq. Hartford has the discretionary authority to make benefits\ndeterminations under the plan.\n       In 1995, Hartford approached Gaeth about the possibility of settling his disability claim with\na lump-sum payment. During the course of pursuing the settlement, Hartford discovered that Gaeth\nhad been operating an antique-lamp restoration business since 1991. Hartford suspected Gaeth of\nfraud and suspended his disability payments pending an investigation by the company.\n        The ensuing investigation consisted of interviewing Gaeth about his antique business and\nthe income derived from it, reviewing his medical and financial records, and surveilling him at\nantique shows and at his place of business in an effort to document his physical capabilities. In his\ninterviews with Hartford, Gaeth moved slowly and with considerable effort, consistent with records\nfrom his treating physician. But Hartford\u2019s investigators reported that 70 minutes of surveillance\nvideo, captured over the course of one week, showed Gaeth moving about, sitting, standing, carrying\nantique lamps, pushing and pulling a cart, and setting up and taking down his sales booths at antique\ntrade shows, all without apparent difficulty. Gaeth also traveled long distances to attend antique\nshows, an activity that was inconsistent with his doctor\u2019s prior evaluations.\n        To explain his travel, Gaeth said that his van was customized to allow him to lie down during\nhis trips. He also told Hartford that his business generated no income. Hartford\u2019s investigators,\nhowever, came to the opposite conclusion based on a copy of an automobile lease application\nindicating that Gaeth\u2019s monthly income exceeded $5,600, and information that an undercover\ninvestigator obtained by engaging Gaeth in conversation at an antique show.\n        In June of 1997, Hartford determined that Gaeth was \u201cno longer totally disabled from\nperforming the duties of his own occupation as of January 1, 1991\u2014the date his own business was\nestablished.\u201d (Alterations omitted.) It terminated his disability benefits and demanded\nreimbursement for all payments made to him since that time. Gaeth disputed Hartford\u2019s\ndetermination, arguing that his business did not generate income and that Hartford did not have any\nevidence showing that he was no longer disabled with regard to his occupation as a sales manager.\n       Also in 1997, Hartford alerted the Kentucky Department of Insurance (DOI) of the\ncompany\u2019s suspicions regarding Gaeth\u2019s possible fraudulent conduct. The DOI investigated the\nmatter and referred it for criminal prosecution in 1999. A grand jury subsequently indicted Gaeth\non two counts of theft by deception, but the indictment was eventually dismissed without prejudice\nin 2002. State prosecutors have not refiled the indictment.\n\fNo. 06-6490               Gaeth v. Hartford Life Insurance Co.                                   Page 3\n\n\nB.     Procedural background\n        In December of 2002, Gaeth sued Hartford in Kentucky state court, asserting federal and\nstate-law claims. His federal claims, brought under ERISA, challenged Hartford\u2019s determination\nthat he was no longer totally disabled and therefore ineligible for disability benefits, and its\ndetermination that he was required to reimburse Hartford for prior payments. Hartford removed the\ncase to federal district court.\n       The district court subsequently granted Gaeth\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding\nthat Hartford\u2019s decision to terminate Gaeth\u2019s benefits was arbitrary and capricious because the\ncompany\u2019s investigation produced no medical evidence showing that Gaeth was able to return to his\noccupation as a sales manager. It further explained that \u201c[r]eliance solely on surveillance (with an\naverage of ten minutes of video per day) is not a reasonable basis for concluding that the plaintiff\nis now able to perform his prior work or that his activities are inconsistent with the restrictions\nimposed by his physicians.\u201d\n        The district court, however, did not find that Gaeth continued to be totally disabled, noting\nthat the record contained \u201cminimal objective medical evidence of [his] continued disability.\u201d\nIt therefore remanded the case to Hartford for a further review of his eligibility for benefits.\nAlthough the court did not decide that Gaeth was entitled to benefits, it nevertheless awarded him\nattorney fees. Hartford filed a timely appeal of that decision. The parties agree that the only issue\nbefore us is the propriety of awarding attorney fees to Gaeth at this stage of the case.\n                                          II. ANALYSIS\nA.     Standard of review for awarding attorney fees under ERISA\n        A district court\u2019s award of attorney fees pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1) is reviewed\nunder the abuse-of-discretion standard. First Trust Corp. v. Bryant, 410 F.3d 842, 851 (6th Cir.\n2005). \u201c[A]n abuse of discretion exists only when the court has the definite and firm conviction that\nthe district court made a clear error of judgment in its conclusion upon weighing relevant factors.\u201d\nMoon v. Unum Provident Corp., 461 F.3d 639, 643 (6th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also Stough v. Mayville Cmty. Sch., 138 F.3d 612, 614 (6th Cir. 1998) (\u201cA district\ncourt abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact, when it improperly\napplies the law, or uses an erroneous legal standard.\u201d).\n       \u201cIn an action by [an ERISA] plan participant, the district court, in its discretion, \u2018may allow\na reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either party.\u2019\u201d Moon, 461 F.3d at 642 (quoting\n\u00a7 1132(g)(1)). \u201c[O]ur circuit recognizes no presumption as to whether attorney fees will be\nawarded.\u201d Foltice v. Guardsman Prods., Inc., 98 F.3d 933, 936 (6th Cir. 1996).\n         We apply the following five-factor test, first set forth in Secretary of the Department of\nLabor v. King, 775 F.2d 666 (6th Cir. 1985), to determine whether a district court properly exercised\nits discretion in awarding fees under \u00a7 1132(g)(1):\n        (1) the degree of the opposing party\u2019s culpability or bad faith; (2) the opposing\n        party\u2019s ability to satisfy an award of attorney\u2019s fees; (3) the deterrent effect of an\n        award on other persons under similar circumstances; (4) whether the party\n        requesting fees sought to confer a common benefit on all participants and\n        beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or resolve significant legal questions regarding\n        ERISA; and (5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.\nMoon, 461 F.3d at 642 (citing King, 775 F.2d at 669). \u201cNo single factor is determinative, and thus,\nthe district court must consider each factor before exercising its discretion.\u201d Id. at 642-43.\n\fNo. 06-6490                Gaeth v. Hartford Life Insurance Co.                                    Page 4\n\n\n       In determining whether to award attorney fees to Gaeth, the district court did not cite the\nSixth Circuit\u2019s King test. It instead applied the following five-factor test from the Second Circuit:\n        (1) the degree of the offending party\u2019s culpability or bad faith, (2) the ability of the\n        offending party to satisfy an award of attorney\u2019s fees, (3) whether an award of fees\n        would deter other persons from acting similarly under like circumstances, (4) the\n        relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions, and (5) whether the action conferred a\n        common benefit on a group of pension plan participants.\nChambless v. Masters, Mates & Pilots Pension Plan, 815 F.2d 869, 871 (2d Cir. 1981).\n        Despite the differences in phrasing, the factors set forth in both formulations of the test are\nlargely the same. But a close reading reveals two material differences. The first difference relates\nto the \u201ccommon benefit\u201d factor. Under the Sixth Circuit\u2019s test, the fourth factor asks whether the\nplaintiff \u201csought to confer\u201d a common benefit on other plan participants. King, 775 F.2d at 669\n(emphasis added). In contrast, the Second Circuit\u2019s corresponding fifth factor does not look to\n\u201cplaintiff\u2019s motive in bringing suit,\u201d but instead considers whether the \u201csuit had the effect of\nconferring a common benefit.\u201d Chambless, 815 F.2d at 872. The other material difference is the\nalternative consideration under the Sixth Circuit\u2019s fourth factor of whether the case resolved a\nsignificant legal question regarding ERISA. That consideration is not contemplated by the Second\nCircuit\u2019s test. We address the district court\u2019s failure to fully analyze the fourth factor in\nPart II.B.4. below.\nB.      Discussion\n        The district court determined that attorney fees are appropriate in this case after briefly\nreasoning that the termination of Gaeth\u2019s benefits was arbitrary and capricious, that Hartford has the\nability to pay Gaeth\u2019s attorney fees, that a fee award might deter Hartford from making such\nunsupported decisions in the future, and that the deterrent effect of awarding fees could benefit not\nonly Gaeth but other claimants. Hartford argues that all of the court\u2019s conclusions are erroneous.\nWe will therefore examine the district court\u2019s analysis of each factor in turn.\n        1.      Culpability or bad faith\n        In its first assignment of error, Hartford contends that the district court abused its discretion\nby failing to make an explicit finding that Hartford\u2019s decision to terminate Gaeth\u2019s benefits was\neither culpable behavior or made in bad faith. It also argues that the record does not contain any\nevidence that would support such a finding.\n        Hartford emphasizes the statement in Moon that \u201can arbitrary and capricious denial of\nbenefits does not necessarily indicate culpability or bad faith.\u201d 461 F.3d at 643 (alteration omitted;\nemphasis added). But this court\u2019s caselaw by no means precludes a finding of culpability or bad\nfaith based only on the evidence that supported a district court\u2019s arbitrary-and-capricious\ndetermination. See, e.g., id. at 644-45 (finding that the plan administrator was culpable for the same\nreason that its rejection of a disability claim was arbitrary and capricious\u2014that is, it adopted\nwholesale the opinion of a physician in its employ \u201cwho based his findings on selective information\nin the administrative record and did not examine [the claimant]\u201d).\n         The district court in the present case did not explicitly make a finding of culpability or bad\nfaith. On the other hand, the court recited a five-factor test similar to King and then proceeded to\nanalyze most of those factors, beginning with the statement that \u201cHartford\u2019s termination of the\nplaintiff\u2019s benefits was made with little support on the record, and the court finds that there is no\nreasoned explanation on the record for the decision.\u201d A fair reading of the court\u2019s discussion of this\nfirst factor makes clear that it found culpability on Hartford\u2019s part, and that the court weighed this\n\fNo. 06-6490                Gaeth v. Hartford Life Insurance Co.                                  Page 5\n\n\nfactor in favor of awarding attorney fees to Gaeth. We are therefore unpersuaded by Hartford\u2019s\nargument that the court\u2019s failure to use the word \u201cculpability\u201d is enough to constitute an abuse of\ndiscretion. The critical question is instead whether the court\u2019s determination that the first factor\nweighed in favor of awarding attorney fees is supported by the record.\n        This court has found a plan administrator to be culpable where the administrator terminated\nbenefits based primarily on the opinions of doctors employed by the company\u2019s own claim\ndepartment. See Hoover v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co., 290 F.3d 801, 809-10 (6th Cir. 2002)\n(finding culpability where a plan administrator denied disability benefits based solely on the opinion\nof a physician in its employ, the latter having neither examined the claimant nor considered\nsubstantial evidence in the record indicating that the claimant was disabled); Moon, 461 F.3d at 644\n(same). The disability determination made by Hartford in the present case was arguably based on\neven less competent evidence than that which was available to the plan administrators in the above\ncases.\n         Hartford might very well have had a good-faith basis for believing that Gaeth was no longer\ndisabled. But it terminated his benefits without a single piece of current medical evidence regarding\nhis physical condition as it relates to the occupation for which he had been deemed disabled, as the\ndistrict court explained at length. Hartford is therefore culpable for making a benefits determination\nthat was unsupported by competent medical evidence. Accordingly, we conclude that the district\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in weighing the first factor in favor of awarding attorney fees.\n        2.      Hartford\u2019s ability to satisfy an award of attorney fees\n        Hartford does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that the company would be able\nto pay the attorney fees incurred by Gaeth. It argues instead that the court placed undue weight on\nthis factor. The company quotes Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Neusser, 810 F.2d 550, 557-58\n(6th Cir. 1987), in asserting that \u201ca party\u2019s financial ability to pay a fee award, even if undisputed,\n\u2018should not be dispositive when examination of all other relevant factors indicates that fees should\nnot be awarded.\u2019\u201d\n         Firestone Tire simply restates the general principle that this factor, like each of the King\nfactors, is not dispositive. See id. (concluding that Firestone\u2019s undisputed ability to satisfy an award\nof attorney fees under ERISA did not justify such an award where all of the other King factors\nindicated that awarding fees was inappropriate); see also Moon, 461 F.3d at 642-43 (explaining that\nno single factor is dispositive). Furthermore, nothing in the district court\u2019s opinion indicates that\nit placed greater weight on this factor than on any other factor in the analysis, or that it considered\nthis factor to be outcome determinative. The court simply stated the undisputed fact that Hartford\nwould likely be able to satisfy the award. We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse\nits discretion in weighing this factor in favor of awarding fees.\n        3.      Deterrent effect of a fee award\n        Hartford next argues that the district court erred in its determination that an award of attorney\nfees might deter the company \u201cfrom making unsupported and poorly reasoned decisions in the future\nand encourage it to make more reliable inquiries before terminating disability benefits.\u201d The\ncompany does not challenge that finding; rather, its argument on this point is that the deterrence\nfactor requires consideration of the deterrent effect on other plan administrators facing similar\ncircumstances, but that the court considered the deterrent effect only on Hartford.\n        A review of Sixth Circuit caselaw supports Hartford\u2019s position. This court has consistently\ninterpreted the deterrence factor as requiring consideration of a fee award\u2019s deterrent effect on other\nplan administrators. See, e.g., Foltice v. Guardsman Prods., Inc., 98 F.3d 933, 937 (6th Cir. 1996)\n(considering the deterrent effect of a fee award on \u201cother plan administrators\u201d); Firestone, 810 F.2d\n\fNo. 06-6490                Gaeth v. Hartford Life Insurance Co.                                  Page 6\n\n\nat 557 (analyzing whether a fee award would \u201cdeter other employers\u201d); see also Hoover, 290 F.3d\nat 809 (considering the deterrent effect on \u201cother similarly situated defendants\u201d and on the\noffending party).\n        The Sixth Circuit\u2019s opinion in Moon, 461 F.3d 639, is particularly instructive regarding the\nproper analysis under this factor. In Moon, the court concluded that the facts of that case\u2014in which\nthe plan administrator denied benefits based solely on the opinion of its own employed physician,\nwho ignored record evidence of the claimant\u2019s disability and did not examine the claimant\u2014\u201care\nnot so unique that they fail to serve any deterrence value to other insurance companies under similar\ncircumstances,\u201d and that the court\u2019s opinion in an earlier appeal of the same case \u201carticulated\nimportant principles that all plan administrators should heed. For example, before terminating a plan\nparticipant\u2019s benefits, a plan administrator should ensure that the opinions upon which they rely to\nmake their decisions to terminate are based on a thorough review of the administrative record.\u201d Id.\nat 645. The key question in analyzing this third factor is therefore whether the fee award would have\na deterrent effect on other plan administrators.\n        Although the district court did in fact fail to explicitly make a finding regarding the deterrent\neffect of a fee award on others, its reasoning about the deterrent effect on Hartford leaves little doubt\nthat the court on remand would make the same finding with respect to the administrators of other\nplans. And nothing in the record indicates that the deterrent effect on Hartford would not apply with\nequal force to them.\n        The company also argues that the deterrent effect of a fee award should not weigh heavily\nin favor of granting attorney fees because Hartford was allegedly not culpable and did not act in bad\nfaith. In other words, it argues that the deterrent effect is related to the degree of culpability or bad\nfaith found under the first factor.\n        This court has indeed taken the common-sense view that \u201cfee awards are likely to have the\ngreatest deterrent effect where deliberate misconduct is in the offing.\u201d Foltice, 98 F.3d at 937\n(concluding that a plan administrator\u2019s lack of bad faith and \u201crelatively slight\u201d degree of culpability\nin arbitrarily rejecting a benefits claim did not present, for purposes of the third factor, \u201cthe sort of\nculpability that warrants punishment in [the claimant\u2019s] case or deterrence in others\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). The plan administrator\u2019s challenged conduct in Foltice\u2014which this\ncourt agreed did not warrant the imposition of attorney fees\u2014was its erroneous interpretation of\ncertain terms in a pension plan. Id. at 938.\n        Hartford, in contrast, did not err by incorrectly interpreting complex plan documents. Rather,\nit made a decision to terminate benefits without any supporting medical evidence. A deterrence\nmeasure is therefore arguably more appropriate here than it was in Foltice. In sum, we find no error\nin the district court\u2019s finding that Hartford\u2019s conduct warranted the award of attorney fees as a\ndeterrent measure, and that this factor therefore weighs in favor of a fee award.\n        4.      Conferring a common benefit on plan participants or resolving a\n                significant legal question under ERISA\n        The district court also found that \u201c[a]lthough the instant action seeks to vindicate the rights\nof only one claimant, the deterrent effect could be beneficial to many.\u201d Hartford argues that the\ncourt erred by (1) finding a common benefit for other plan participants based on the deterrent effect\non Hartford, and (2) failing to analyze whether the case resolved a significant legal question under\nERISA.\n       The company contends that this court has \u201crepeatedly declined to find [this] factor satisfied\nin cases, such as this one, that were brought by individual plaintiffs.\u201d But it cites only Foltice,\nwhere the plan administrator had determined that the claimant\u2019s situation did not fall within the\n\fNo. 06-6490                Gaeth v. Hartford Life Insurance Co.                                  Page 7\n\n\ndefinition of the phrase \u201caccident or sickness benefits\u201d in the plan documents. 98 F.3d at 936. This\ncourt in Foltice affirmed the district court\u2019s determination that this factor weighed against imposing\nattorney fees on the plan administrator because the claimant, Foltice, did not seek to obtain a\ncommon benefit for all participants and beneficiaries of the plan at issue, and \u201cmost of the\nparticipants in and beneficiaries of the . . . plan stood to gain nothing from this lawsuit.\u201d Id. at 937.\nAlthough four other plan participants were in situations that were comparable to Foltice\u2019s, \u201cthe\nbenefit realized by these four participants was \u2018incidental\u2019\u201d to Foltice\u2019s success. Id.\n        Gaeth responds by adopting the district court\u2019s view that he in fact obtained a common\nbenefit for other plan participants\u2014specifically, \u201cthe deterrent effect of insurers practicing and\nmaking arbitrary and capricious terminations of benefits.\u201d But he fails to cite any supporting\nauthority for his position and provides no alternative reading of Foltice. Furthermore, this court\u2019s\ndecision in Moon, 461 F.3d 639, undermines his argument\u2014and the district court\u2019s finding\nbelow\u2014that a deterrent effect alone constitutes a common benefit.\n        In Moon, as in the present case, the district court found that the plan administrator\u2019s rejection\nof a disability-benefits claim was not supported by competent evidence. Id. at 644. The claimant\nprevailed in obtaining a reversal of that determination as arbitrary and capricious, and then sought\nattorney fees under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1). On appeal, this court agreed with the district court\u2019s\nconclusion that the plan administrator was culpable and that awarding fees to the claimant would\n\u201cdeter other insurance companies from making the same arbitrary decisions as [the plan\nadministrator] in the instant case.\u201d Id. at 645.\n        Thus the Moon claimant had, like Gaeth, arguably obtained a \u201ccommon benefit\u201d for all plan\nparticipants in the form of deterring the plan administrator from making similarly unreasonable\ndecisions in the future. But with regard to the common-benefit factor, this court nevertheless\nconcluded that the facts weighed against awarding attorney fees because the claimant \u201conly sought\n[long-term disability] benefits for herself and did not seek to confer a benefit upon all plan\nparticipants.\u201d Id. This demonstrates that the deterrent-effect and common-benefit factors are\nseparate inquiries, and also highlights the difference between this court\u2019s King test (\u201cwhether the\nparty requesting fees sought to confer a common benefit,\u201d King, 775 F.2d at 669 (emphasis added)),\nand the Second Circuit\u2019s Chambless test (\u201cwhether the action conferred a common benefit,\u201d\nChambless, 815 F.2d at 871).\n        Applying Foltice and Moon to the present case leads us to the conclusion that the district\ncourt erred in its analysis of this factor. Gaeth did not seek to obtain a common benefit for all of the\nparticipants in Oracle\u2019s plan. Furthermore, the record does not establish, and Gaeth does not argue,\nthat any other participant in Oracle\u2019s plan was in the same position as Gaeth (i.e., having disability\nbenefits terminated by Hartford without consideration of medical evidence), or that any other\nparticipant would obtain a redetermination of a similarly adverse benefits decision as a result of\nGaeth\u2019s success in obtaining reconsideration of Hartford\u2019s termination decision. Accordingly, the\ncommon-benefit factor weighs against an award of attorney fees, and the district court erred in\nfinding otherwise.\n        The district court also failed to consider whether this case resolved any significant legal\nquestions regarding ERISA. That failure stemmed from the court\u2019s use of the Second Circuit\u2019s\nChambless test rather than this court\u2019s King test, the latter including this consideration as an\nalternative finding under the fourth factor. Here, the parties\u2019 dispute was whether Hartford\u2019s\ndecision to terminate Gaeth\u2019s benefits was arbitrary and capricious, a legal standard that has been\nanalyzed repeatedly by this court. The merits of this case did not turn on the resolution of any\ndifficult ERISA question, so that factor\u2014had the district court applied the proper test and considered\nit\u2014would clearly have weighed against awarding attorney fees. For the foregoing reasons, we\n\fNo. 06-6490               Gaeth v. Hartford Life Insurance Co.                                 Page 8\n\n\nconclude that the district court abused its discretion in finding that the deterrence factor weighs in\nfavor of Gaeth.\n       5.      Relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions\n        Hartford\u2019s final argument is that the district court made no finding as to the relative merits\nof the parties\u2019 positions. That factor is part of both the Sixth Circuit and the Second Circuit tests,\nand the district court\u2019s failure to analyze this factor amounts to an abuse of discretion.\n       Although the district court found no objective medical evidence supporting Hartford\u2019s\ndetermination that Gaeth was able to return to his previous position, it noted, significantly, that the\nrecord contained \u201cminimal objective medical evidence of [Gaeth\u2019s] continued disability.\u201d The\nrecord indeed leaves open the possibility that Hartford might ultimately prevail in showing that\nGaeth is no longer totally disabled. Thus the merits of Gaeth\u2019s position are at best questionable as\ncompared to the merits of Hartford\u2019s position, causing this factor to weigh against an award of\nattorney fees at this point in the proceedings.\n        Had the district court addressed the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions under the fifth\nfactor, it might well have decided that this factor weighs against a fee award at the present time.\n\u201cBecause no single factor is determinative, the court must consider each factor before exercising its\ndiscretion.\u201d Schwartz v. Gregori, 160 F.3d 1116, 1119 (6th Cir. 1998).\n        We further note that awarding attorney fees to Gaeth now could result in the incongruous\nsituation of the party that ultimately wins nevertheless being required to pay the attorney fees of the\nlosing party. To be sure, the express language of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132 does not limit an award of\nattorney fees to the prevailing party. See \u00a7 1132(g)(1) (providing that \u201cthe court in its discretion\nmay allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of action to either party\u201d (emphasis added)). But\nthe possibility that Gaeth could receive attorney fees from Hartford even if he ultimately loses his\ncase underscores the importance of carefully analyzing the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.\n        Such a possibility also raises the question of whether a district court would always abuse its\ndiscretion by awarding attorney fees to a losing party, or to a claimant who has yet to obtain the\nsought-after award of benefits. We need not address that issue in the present case, however, because\nof our conclusion that the district court abused its discretion on other grounds; namely, by failing\nto fully analyze the King factors.\nC.     Summary\n        The district court erred in its analysis under both the fourth King factor (common benefit or\nresolution of a significant legal question) and the fifth King factor (relative merits). We therefore\nconclude that the court abused its discretion in determining that Gaeth is entitled to an award of\nattorney fees at this time.\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\n    For all of the reasons set forth above, we VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment and\nREMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f",
