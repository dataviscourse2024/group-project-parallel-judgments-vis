FORSTER v. STATE OF TENNESSEE\n\n                Appeal from the Criminal Court for Davidson County\n                      No. 2000-B-1181    Seth Norman, Judge\n\n\n                 No. M2012-01641-CCA-R3-PC - Filed August 8, 2013\n\n\nAnthony D. Forster (\u201cthe Petitioner\u201d) filed a petition for post-conviction relief from his\nconviction for especially aggravated robbery. In his petition, he alleged that he received\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The post-conviction court summarily dismissed\nhis petition. On appeal, the Petitioner asserts that the post-conviction court erred in\nsummarily dismissing his petition. Upon our thorough review of the record and applicable\nlaw, we reverse the judgment of the post-conviction court and remand this matter to the\nDavidson County Criminal Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                   Tenn. R. App. P. 3 Appeal as of Right; Judgment\n                     of the Criminal Court Reversed; Remanded\n\nJ EFFREY S. B IVINS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which J OHN E VERETT W ILLIAMS\nand N ORMA M CG EE O GLE, JJ., joined.\n\nAnthony D. Forster, Henning, Tennessee, Pro Se.\n\nRobert E. Cooper, Jr., Attorney General & Reporter; Renee W. Turner, Senior Counsel;\nVictor S. Johnson III, District Attorney General; and Dann Hamm, Assistant District\nAttorney General, for the appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                                         OPINION\n\n                          Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       The Petitioner was indicted in June 2000 on one count of aggravated robbery, two\ncounts of aggravated assault, and one count of especially aggravated robbery. A jury\nconvicted the Petitioner only of the especially aggravated robbery offense. Prior to the\nsentencing hearing, the Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss his attorney and proceed pro se,\n\fwhich the trial court granted. The Petitioner was sentenced to twenty-two years. The\nPetitioner then filed a motion in this Court for appointment of counsel for the appeal, which\nwe denied. On appeal, this Court affirmed the Petitioner\u2019s conviction and sentence. See\nState v. Anthony D. Forster, M2002-00008-CCA-R3-CD, 2003 WL 1715922, at *14 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Apr. 1, 2003), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Oct. 13, 2003). The Petitioner then filed\nan initial petition for post-conviction relief, arguing \u201cthat his wavier of the right to counsel\nwas not valid,\u201d which the post-conviction court summarily dismissed. See Anthony D.\nForster v. State, M2004-00452-CCA-R3-PC, 2005 WL 1521841, at *1 (Tenn. Crim. App.\nJune 24, 2005). The Petitioner appealed the dismissal of this initial post-conviction petition,\nand this Court affirmed the dismissal. Id. at *3.\n\n        Having exhausted his state remedies, the Petitioner next filed for federal habeas\ncorpus relief alleging, inter alia, that he was denied his Fourteenth Amendment right to\ncounsel on appeal. See Forster v. Steward, 360 Fed. Appx. 604, 604-05 (6th Cir. Jan. 5,\n2010). The district court denied each claim, but \u201cgranted a certificate of appealability on\nwhether [this Court] unreasonably applied clearly established Supreme Court law when it\ndenied [the Petitioner\u2019s] explicit request for appellate counsel.\u201d Id. at 605. The United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the Petitioner did not effectively waive\nhis Fourteenth Amendment right to appellate counsel when he waived his Sixth Amendment\nright to assistance of counsel at sentencing. Id. at 606. The court reversed the district court\u2019s\njudgment and remanded the case to afford the Petitioner an opportunity to appeal his\nconviction with the assistance of counsel. Id. With the assistance of counsel, the Petitioner\nappealed, and this Court again affirmed the Petitioner\u2019s conviction and sentence. See State\nv. Anthony D. Forster, No. M2002-008-CCA-R3-CD, 2011 WL 1431980, at *16 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. Apr. 11, 2011), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Aug. 24, 2011).\n\n        Finally, the Petitioner filed the instant pro se petition for post-conviction relief arguing\nthat his counsel on appeal (\u201cappellate counsel\u201d) was ineffective. The post-conviction court\nsummarily dismissed his petition. In the order summarily dismissing his petition, the post-\nconviction court held that\n\n       T.C.A. \u00a7 40-30-102(c) \u2018contemplates the filing of only one (1) petition for\n       post-conviction relief. In no event may more than one (1) petition for post-\n       conviction relief be filed attacking a single judgment.\u2019\n\n              The Petitioner has been afforded two separate appeals and now wishes\n       to have yet another opportunity to attack the judgment in this matter via post-\n       conviction petition. As it appears that the Petitioner has already been availed\n       of the opportunity to do so, the Court is of the opinion that the Petition for\n       Post-Conviction Relief should be dismissed.\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\fThe post-conviction court cited, as an additional ground, that the Petitioner failed to verify\nhis petition under oath. The Petitioner has appealed, arguing that the post-conviction court\nerred in summarily dismissing his petition. The State agrees with the Petitioner that the post-\nconviction court erred in summarily dismissing his petition, and it requests that the case be\nremanded for an evidentiary hearing.1\n\n                                                  Analysis\n\n                                             Post-Conviction\n\n       We review the propriety of a post-conviction court\u2019s summary dismissal de novo.\nSee, e.g., Burnett v. State, 92 S.W.3d 403, 406 (Tenn. 2002) (citing Fields v. State, 40\nS.W.3d 450, 457 (Tenn. 2001)). Relief pursuant to a post-conviction proceeding is available\nonly where the petitioner demonstrates that his or her \u201cconviction or sentence is void or\nvoidable because of the abridgment of any right guaranteed by the Constitution of Tennessee\nor the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-103 (2006).\n\n        As noted by the post-conviction court, the Post-Conviction Act only contemplates the\nfiling of one petition for post-conviction relief. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 40-30-102(c) (2006).\nThis section further provides: \u201cIn no event may more than one (1) petition for post-\nconviction relief be filed attacking a single judgment. If a prior petition has been filed which\nwas resolved on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction, any second or subsequent\npetition shall be summarily dismissed.\u201d Id. However, Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 28\nsection 9(D)(3), which supplements the remedies and procedures set forth in the Post-\nConviction Procedure Act, see Tennessee Code Annotated sections 40-30-101 to -122,\nprovides the following:\n\n        (a) Where a delayed appeal is granted and the petitioner is unsuccessful on\n        appeal, and new issues cognizable in a post-conviction proceeding result from\n        the handling of the delayed appeal, the petitioner may amend the original post-\n        conviction petition to include such new issues.\n\n       Here, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit remanded the\nPetitioner\u2019s case to the trial court to afford the Petitioner an opportunity to appeal his\n\n\n        1\n          The State originally filed a motion requesting this Court to affirm the post-conviction court\u2019s\nsummary dismissal in a memorandum opinion pursuant to Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals Rule 20.\nSee Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 20. After reviewing the record, we denied that request and set the case for full\nbriefing. As noted above, the State now agrees with the Petitioner\u2019s contention that the post-conviction court\nerred in summarily dismissing his petition.\n\n                                                     -3-\n\fconviction with the assistance of counsel. The Petitioner then unsuccessfully appealed his\ncase with the assistance of counsel. Accordingly, under the particular procedural history and\nfacts of this case, the Petitioner must be allowed to pursue his post-conviction claim on those\nnew issues related to whether appellate counsel was ineffective. Additionally, with regard\nto the post-conviction court summarily dismissing the petition because the Petitioner failed\nto verify it under oath, \u201c[n]o pro se petition shall be dismissed for failure to follow the\nprescribed form until the court has given petitioner a reasonable opportunity to amend the\npetition with the assistance of counsel.\u201d See Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 20, \u00a7 6(B)(4)(b).\n\n       For these reasons, the trial court erred in summarily dismissing the Petitioner\u2019s\npetition for post-conviction relief. Thus, we are compelled to reverse the post-conviction\ncourt\u2019s judgment and remand the case to the post-conviction court to address the preliminary\nconsiderations in post-conviction cases required by Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-\n30-106 (2006), including whether the Petitioner has stated a colorable claim for relief and\nwhether post-conviction counsel should be appointed.\n\n                                         Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons articulated above, the judgment of the post-conviction court is\nreversed, and this matter is remanded to the post-conviction court for further proceedings in\naccordance with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    ______________________________\n                                                    JEFFREY S.
