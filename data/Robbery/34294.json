The judgment convicted defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of attempted burglary in the second degree.\nIt is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.\nMemorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of guilty of attempted burglary in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 140.25 [2]). Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, the record establishes that he know*1679ingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived the right to appeal (see generally People v Lopez, 6 NY3d 248, 256 [2006]), and that valid waiver forecloses any challenge by defendant to the severity of the sentence (see id. at 255; see generally People v Lococo, 92 NY2d 825, 827 [1998]; People v Hidalgo, 91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]).\nPresent\u2014Carni, J.P., Lindley, DeJoseph, Nemoyer and Troutman, JJ.\n",
