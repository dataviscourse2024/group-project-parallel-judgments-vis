Rhiley filed this mandamus action against the\nNebraska State Patrol (NSP) seeking an order commanding\nthe NSP to remove from the public record information regard-\ning his 1991 arrest. The NSP argued (1) the mandamus action\nwas barred by sovereign immunity and thus the court lacked\nsubject matter jurisdiction, (2) the action was moot, and (3)\nmandamus relief was unavailable because Rhiley had an ade-\nquate remedy at law. The district court rejected the sovereign\nimmunity defense, but granted judgment in favor of the NSP\nand dismissed the mandamus action on the other grounds.\nRhiley appeals the dismissal of his mandamus action, and\nthe NSP cross-appeals the rejection of its sovereign immu-\nnity defense. We conclude the sovereign immunity defense is\nmeritorious and dismiss the appeal for lack of subject mat-\nter jurisdiction.\n                          FACTS\n   On February 1, 1991, Rhiley was arrested by police in\nGrand Island, Nebraska, pursuant to a felony arrest warrant for\nburglary issued in Laramie, Wyoming. The arresting officers\ninformed the NSP\u2019s Criminal Identification Division (CID)\n\f                                       - 243 -\n                 Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                         301 Nebraska R eports\n               STATE EX REL.

Under Nebraska\u2019s Security,\nPrivacy, and Dissemination of Criminal History Information\nAct 2 (the Criminal History Act), each criminal justice agency\nis required to maintain \u201ccomplete and accurate criminal his-\ntory record information with regard to the actions taken by the\nagency.\u201d3 Under the Criminal History Act, \u201ccomplete\u201d infor-\nmation means that \u201carrest records shall show the subsequent\ndisposition of the case as it moves through the various stages\nof the criminal justice system\u201d and \u201caccurate\u201d information\n\u201cshall mean containing no erroneous information of a mate-\nrial nature.\u201d 4\n   According to Rhiley, after he was arrested, officials deter-\nmined he was not involved in the burglary, he was released,\nand Wyoming prosecutors voluntarily dismissed the burglary\ncharge. The NSP\u2019s CID was not notified of the Wyoming\naction.\n   In 2016, Rhiley obtained a copy of his NSP criminal history\ninformation and found it included information about the 1991\narrest for burglary. Regarding disposition of the arrest, the\nreport provided: \u201cARREST DISPOSITION: TRANSFERRED\nTO ANOTHER AGENCY\u2014WYOMING.\u201d The criminal his-\ntory report did not indicate the burglary charge had been\ndismissed by the Wyoming prosecutor. Rhiley\u2019s attorney tele-\nphoned the NSP\u2019s CID to request correction, and was told to\ncontact the arresting agency. Rhiley\u2019s counsel then contacted\n\n\u20021\t\n      See Neb. Rev.

On July 13, 2017, Rhiley voluntarily\n\n\u20025\t\n      \u00a7 29-3523 (3)(a) through (c) (emphasis supplied).\n\f                              - 245 -\n           Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                   301 Nebraska R eports\n         STATE EX REL.

Thus, Rhiley elected\nto proceed with a mandamus action against only the NSP,\nseeking to compel the removal of criminal history information\nregarding his 1991 arrest from the public record. After the\nlawsuit was filed, the NSP removed Rhiley\u2019s arrest informa-\ntion from the public record.\n   Rhiley claims that \u00a7 29-3528 authorizes a mandamus action\ndirectly against the NSP to compel compliance with the\nCriminal History Act. Section 29-3528 provides:\n         Whenever any officer or employee of the state, its\n      agencies, or its political subdivisions, or whenever any\n      state agency or any political subdivision or its agencies\n      fails to comply with the requirements of [the Criminal\n      History Act] or of regulations lawfully adopted to imple-\n      ment [that act], any person aggrieved may bring an action,\n      including but not limited to an action for mandamus, to\n      compel compliance and such action may be brought in the\n      district court of any district in which the records involved\n      are located or in the district court of Lancaster County.\n      The commission may request the Attorney General to\n      bring such action.\n   The NSP moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing\nthe mandamus action was barred by the doctrine of sovereign\nimmunity. The district court overruled the motion. The NSP\nsubsequently filed another motion, styled as a motion for sum-\nmary judgment, asserting: (1) Rhiley\u2019s mandamus action was\nbarred by sovereign immunity; (2) Rhiley had a plain and ade-\nquate remedy at law, so mandamus was not available; and (3)\nthe action was rendered moot when the 1991 arrest information\nwas removed from the public record shortly after the manda-\nmus action was filed. No party challenges the use of summary\njudgment within a mandamus action.\n   The district court again rejected the sovereign immunity\ndefense, but granted judgment in favor of the NSP on the other\ntwo grounds and denied mandamus relief. It reasoned Rhiley\u2019s\nclaim was rendered moot by the NSP\u2019s removal of his arrest\n\f                                    - 246 -\n                Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                        301 Nebraska R eports\n              STATE EX REL.

Alternatively, it reasoned\nregulations promulgated pursuant to the Criminal History Act\ncreated procedures for challenging incorrect criminal history 6\nand found such procedures were a \u201cplain and adequate rem-\nedy\u201d available to Rhiley that precluded mandamus relief.7\n   Rhiley appeals, and the NSP cross-appeals. We granted the\nNSP\u2019s petition to bypass.\n\n                  ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   Rhiley assigns, restated and summarized, that the district\ncourt erred in (1) determining the action is moot, (2) determin-\ning he failed to avail himself of a plain and adequate remedy at\nlaw, (3) relying on an administrative exhaustion defense when\nthe NSP did not assert such a defense in its answer, (4) sustain-\ning the NSP\u2019s hearsay objection to certain evidence, and (5)\nfailing to bind the NSP to its guidance documents.\n   On cross-appeal, the NSP contends both the district court\nand this court lack jurisdiction, because Rhiley\u2019s claim against\nthe NSP, a state agency, is barred by the doctrine of sovereign\nimmunity and the language in \u00a7 29-3528 is not a waiver of\nsuch immunity.\n\n                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   [1] Sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature, and courts\nhave a duty to determine whether they have subject matter\njurisdiction over a matter.8\n   [2] A jurisdictional question which does not involve a fac-\ntual dispute is determined by an appellate court as a matter of\nlaw, which requires the appellate court to reach a conclusion\nindependent of the lower court\u2019s decision.9\n\n\u20026\t\n      See, \u00a7 29-3526; 78 Neb.

The NSP is an administrative\ndepartment of the State of Nebraska,20 and an action against a\nstate agency is an action against the State.21 Therefore, Rhiley\u2019s\nmandamus action against the NSP is barred by sovereign\nimmunity unless the Legislature has waived it.\n   Rhiley argues \u00a7 29-3528 waives the State\u2019s sovereign immu-\nnity in a mandamus action seeking to compel compliance with\nthe Criminal History Act. His argument is generally twofold.\nFirst, he asserts we should construe \u00a7 29-3528 as a waiver\nof the State\u2019s sovereign immunity.

Mandamus is a law action\nand is defined as an extraordinary remedy, not a writ of right,\nissued to compel the performance of a purely ministerial act\nor duty, imposed by law upon an inferior tribunal, corporation,\nboard, or person, where (1) the relator has a clear right to the\nrelief sought, (2) there is a corresponding clear duty existing\non the part of the respondent to perform the act, and (3) there\nis no other plain and adequate remedy available in the ordinary\ncourt of law.23 Mandamus is statutorily authorized by Neb.\nRev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 25-2156 to 25-2169 (Reissue 2016).\n   In State ex rel. Steinke v. Lautenbaugh,24 we addressed\nwhether a suit seeking a writ of mandamus against the Douglas\nCounty election commissioner, in his official capacity, was\nbarred by sovereign immunity. We found it was not, reasoning:\n      When an action is brought against an individual employee\n      of a state agency, a court must determine whether the\n      action against the individual official is in reality an action\n      against the state and therefore barred by sovereign immu-\n      nity.[25] In addressing this issue, we have stated that an\n      action against a public officer to obtain relief from an\n      invalid act or from an abuse of authority by the officer or\n      agent is not a suit against the state and is not prohibited\n\n22\t\n      Henderson, supra note 19.\n23\t\n      State ex rel.

The basis for\n      relators\u2019 claims is that [the election commissioner]\n      exceeded his statutory authority to adjust subdistrict\n      boundaries, and thus, they seek relief from what they\n      allege to be an invalid act or an abuse of authority by [the\n      commissioner].28\n   Lautenbaugh did not rely on any Legislative waiver of sov-\nereign immunity to find the action proper. Instead, it relied on\nthe rationale that an act done by a state official that exceeds or\nabuses his or her authority is not an act of the State. As such,\nLautenbaugh recognized the general principle that sovereign\nimmunity does not bar mandamus actions against a public\nofficer seeking relief from what is alleged to be an invalid act\nor an abuse of authority by the public officer.\n   Under the principle announced in Lautenbaugh, if Rhiley\nhad proceeded with his mandamus action against a public\nofficer of the NSP, our sovereign immunity analysis would\nbe different. But Rhiley\u2019s mandamus action against the NSP\nsuperintendent was voluntarily dismissed, leaving the NSP, a\nstate agency, as the only named party.\n   We addressed a similar situation in Henderson.29 There, an\ninmate sought a writ of mandamus directing the Department\n\n26\t\n      Johnson, supra note 21.\n27\t\n      Concerned Citizens v.

The inmate\nsued several state officers in addition to the Department of\nCorrectional Services, but he failed to perfect service on any\nof the officers. Thus, the mandamus action proceeded against\nonly the department, and we phrased the jurisdictional ques-\ntion as whether the district court had subject matter jurisdic-\ntion over a mandamus action against the department, a state\nagency, absent legislative action waiving the State\u2019s sover-\neign immunity.30\n   In considering whether sovereign immunity had been\nwaived, Henderson looked to the general statute authorizing\nmandamus, \u00a7 25-2156. That statute provides in relevant part:\n\u201cThe writ of mandamus may be issued to any inferior tribunal,\ncorporation, board or person, to compel the performance of an\nact which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from\nan office, trust or station.\u201d31 We concluded that \u201c[n]othing in\nthe statutes governing mandamus . . . indicates a legislative\nintent to waive sovereign immunity for mandamus actions\nagainst a state agency.\u201d32\n   Rhiley argues we erred in Henderson, and he invites us to\noverrule that case. He contends that although the NSP is a state\nagency, it can also be an \u201cinferior tribunal\u201d within the context\nof \u00a7 25-2156, and he asks us to find that the Legislature has\nwaived the State\u2019s sovereign immunity for inferior tribunals.\n   We adhere to the holding in Henderson and do not con-\nsider Rhiley\u2019s argument, because it is hypothetical. There is\nnothing in the record suggesting the NSP acted as a tribunal\nin this case, and it is not the function of the courts to render\na judgment that is merely advisory.33 Moreover, appellate\n\n30\t\n      Id.\n31\t\n      \u00a7 25-2156.\n32\t\n      Henderson, supra note 19, 256 Neb. at 317, 589 N.W.2d at 522.\n33\t\n      In re Applications of Koch, 274 Neb. 96, 736 N.W.2d 716 (2007).\n\f                                  - 252 -\n               Nebraska Supreme Court A dvance Sheets\n                       301 Nebraska R eports\n             STATE EX REL.

As noted, \u00a7 29-3528 provides:\n         Whenever any officer or employee of the state, its\n     agencies, or its political subdivisions, or whenever any\n     state agency or any political subdivision or its agencies\n     fails to comply with the requirements of [the Criminal\n     History Act] or of regulations lawfully adopted to imple-\n     ment [that act], any person aggrieved may bring an\n     action, including but not limited to an action for man-\n     damus, to compel compliance and such action may be\n     brought in the district court of any district in which\n     the records involved are located or in the district court\n     of Lancaster County. The commission may request the\n     Attorney General to bring such action.\n   As we recently reiterated in Amend v. Nebraska Pub. Serv.\nComm.35:\n     It is well settled that statutes that purport to waive the\n     State\u2019s protection of sovereign immunity are strictly con-\n     strued in favor of the sovereign and against the waiver.\n     . . .

We disagree.\n   When strictly construed in favor of the sovereign and\nagainst waiver, a reasonable construction of the relevant text\nin \u00a7 29-3528 is that it recognizes a private civil right of action\nto enforce the Criminal History Act. So construed, \u00a7 29-3528\nallows an aggrieved party to bring a civil action, including\na mandamus action, to enforce compliance with the require-\nments of the Criminal History Act, assuming all other jurisdic-\ntional and statutory requirements for bringing any particular\naction are met.\n   But nothing about allowing a private right of action is an\nexpress or implied waiver of the State\u2019s sovereign immunity.\nWhile a court must attempt to give effect to all parts of a stat-\nute, and if it can be avoided, no word, clause, or sentence will\nbe rejected as superfluous or meaningless,36 a court also must\nnot read into a statute a meaning that is not there.37 Section\n\n36\t\n      Stick v.
