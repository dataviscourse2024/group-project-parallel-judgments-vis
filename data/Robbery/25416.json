Greve,\n\nJudge.\n\n\n\n      Applicant appeals the district court decision denying his request for\n\npostconviction relief. AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n      Lauren M. Phelps, Washington, for appellant.\n\n      Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, and Louis S. Sloven, Assistant\n\nAttorney General, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n      Considered by Vaitheswaran, P.J., and Potterfield and Bower, JJ.\n\f                                            2\n\n\nBOWER, Judge.\n\n       Anthony Hawkins appeals the district court decision denying his request\n\nfor postconviction relief.   Hawkins\u2019s claim that defense counsel should have\n\nrequested an accomplice instruction was addressed in his direct appeal, and it\n\nwill not be considered in this postconviction action. We find Hawkins has not\n\nshown he received ineffective assistance due to defense counsel\u2019s failure to\n\nvigorously cross-examine the State\u2019s witnesses. We affirm the decision of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n       Hawkins was convicted of first-degree robbery, felon in possession of a\n\nfirearm, and trafficking in stolen weapons.     His convictions were affirmed on\n\nappeal. State v. Hawkins, No. 11-0490, 2012 WL 170647, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App.\n\nJan. 19, 2012). The facts of the case are set out in our decision above, and we\n\nwill not repeat them here. See id. at *1.\n\n       One of the issues addressed on appeal was whether \u201c[Hawkins\u2019s] trial\n\nattorney was ineffective in failing to request an instruction requiring corroboration\n\nof [an accomplice\u2019s] testimony.\u201d Id. at *2. We discussed evidence corroborating\n\nthe witness\u2019s testimony and determined, \u201cIn light of this corroborating evidence,\n\nthe failure of Hawkins\u2019s attorney to request an accomplice corroboration\n\ninstruction did not result in Strickland prejudice, and Hawkins\u2019s ineffective-\n\nassistance-of-counsel claim necessarily fails.\u201d       Id.   In his application for\n\npostconviction relief, Hawkins again claimed he received ineffective assistance\n\nbecause defense counsel did not request an accomplice instruction. This issue\n\nwas resolved in the direct appeal, and we will not discuss it further in this action\n\nfor postconviction relief. See Iowa Code \u00a7 822.8 (2013).\n\f                                           3\n\n\n          Hawkins also claims he received ineffective assistance because defense\n\ncounsel did not vigorously cross-examine the State\u2019s witnesses or impeach them\n\nwith deposition testimony. He states, \u201cTrial counsel certainly cross-examined\n\nduring trial, but [Hawkins] alleges his cross-examination of several witnesses fell\n\nshort.\u201d     Hawkins states defense counsel did not adequately highlight the\n\ndiscrepancies in the testimony of several witnesses.\n\n          We review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel de novo. State v.\n\nGaskins, 866 N.W.2d 1, 5 (Iowa 2015). \u201cTo prevail on a claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel, the claimant must show counsel failed to perform an\n\nessential duty and prejudice resulted.\u201d State v. Ary, 877 N.W.2d 686, 705 (Iowa\n\n2016).\n\n          The district court found defense counsel \u201cdid vigorously cross-examine the\n\nmain witnesses in this matter\u201d and \u201crepeatedly pointed out inconsistencies\n\nbetween the various witnesses\u2019 testimony.\u201d The court concluded Hawkins did not\n\nestablish defense counsel failed to perform an essential duty or he was\n\nprejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance.           We agree with the district court\u2019s\n\nconclusions. The record shows defense counsel adequately cross-examined the\n\nwitnesses and pointed out the inconsistencies in their testimony. We determine\n\nHawkins has failed to show he received ineffective assistance based on his claim\n\ndefense counsel should have \u201cmore vigorously\u201d cross-examined the State\u2019s\n\nwitnesses.\n\n          A full opinion in this case would not augment or clarify existing case law.\n\nSee Iowa Ct. R. 21.26(1)(e). We affirm the decision of the district court.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\f",
