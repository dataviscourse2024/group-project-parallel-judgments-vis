In a single issue,\n\nNeely argues that the trial court erred by accepting his guilty plea, which he\n\nclaims he entered involuntarily. We will affirm.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          \u2026 See T EX. R. A PP. P. 47.4.\n\f      On January 8, 2007, Neely entered an open plea of guilty to the charge\n\nof aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon.         He also signed written plea\n\nadmonishments,     a   judicial   confession   admitting   guilt,   and   a   written\n\nwaiver\u2014joined by his attorney\u2014waiving his right to a jury trial, waiving all\n\nrights given to him by law pursuant to code of criminal procedure article 1.14,\n\nand requesting preparation of a presentence investigation report.\n\n      At the punishment hearing on July 5, 2007, Neely testified that Denison\n\nand Tipp, two men purporting to be friends of his ex-girlfriend, approached him\n\nat a car wash and asked if he would take them to visit Monte Ferrell\u2019s residence\n\nto sell some pills. Ferrell\u2019s son testified that his father, who was seventy-two\n\nyears old, often helped others by lending them money and that he regularly\n\ncarried at least several hundred dollars in cash on him. Neely knew Ferrell\n\nbecause Ferrell had lent money to Neely\u2019s ex-girlfriend on a number of\n\noccasions in the past.\n\n      Neeley drove Denison and Tipp to Ferrell\u2019s apartment, walked with them\n\nto the front door, and knocked on the door. Ferrell answered the door just after\n\nNeely had returned to his car, and Neely observed Denison and Tipp \u201cr[u]n up\n\nin the house.\u201d Neely testified that he thought something bad was going to\n\nhappen at that point. He recounted that he wanted to leave, but \u201cTipp . . .\n\nacted like he had something under his jacket\u201d or \u201che had his hand in his pocket\n\n                                         2\n\flike he had something and I was thinking it was a gun.\u201d Neely left Ferrell\u2019s\n\nresidence with Denison and Tipp, and Denison gave Neely a cocaine rock and\n\nten dollars aftewards.\n\n      Ferrell suffered a depressed skull fracture with a subdural hematoma, a\n\nbroken scapula, and lacerations as a result of his encounter with Denison and\n\nTipp. Ferrell\u2019s son opined that it looked like they had kicked his father\u2014who\n\nis now in a wheelchair and requires significant care\u2014in the head, and police\n\nthought between $1,000 and $2,500 had been taken from Ferrell. The trial\n\ncourt questioned Neely about the facts surrounding his involvement in the\n\nincident, and Neely testified in part that his only intention was for he, Denison,\n\nand Tipp to sell Ferrell pills, that he did not knowingly participate in Ferrell\u2019s\n\nrobbery, and that he did not know that Denison and Tipp were going to rob\n\nFerrell. Despite Neely\u2019s testimony that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe what happened,\u201d\n\nhe further testified that he had never sold Ferrell pills before and that he had\n\nspoken with others about robbing Ferrell at some point before the incident, and\n\nhe agreed that he \u201chad some idea what might be going down by taking\n\n[Denison and Tipp] over there.\u201d Neely never sought to withdraw his guilty plea,\n\nthrough a motion to withdraw or otherwise. The trial court found Neely guilty,\n\nmade an affirmative deadly weapon finding, and sentenced Neely to twenty-five\n\nyears\u2019 confinement.\n\n                                        3\n\f      Neely argues in his only issue that his guilty plea was involuntary and that\n\nthe trial court erred by accepting it because he lacked the necessary intent to\n\nsupport his conviction; because his credibility, which the trial court had\n\nquestioned at the punishment hearing, is irrelevant to a determination of the\n\nintelligent and voluntary nature of a guilty plea; and because he denied \u201cboth\n\nknowledge of a plan to rob Mr. Ferrell and intent.\u201d He thus contends that \u201c[t]he\n\nfact that he consistently denied any prior knowledge or intent while consistently\n\nacknowledging his guilty plea demonstrates his failure to understand that lack\n\nof a culpable mental state would result in acquittal and that his conduct did not\n\nconstitute the charged offense.\u201d\n\n      The court of criminal appeals has considered the issue of a trial court\u2019s\n\nresponsibility to withdraw a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty in light of evidence that\n\nis inconsistent with the plea, reasoning as follows:\n\n      As we have said, a defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty entails the\n      waiver of some important, constitutional rights. . . . It is fitting\n      that trial courts have a duty to implement those rights, which shield\n      each defendant at the outset of every criminal proceeding. But\n      after a court has fulfilled those duties and a defendant has made a\n      valid waiver of those rights, it is appropriate that the defendant be\n      required to take some affirmative action to don the armor again.\n      The number of cases in which defendants want to \u201cunwaive\u201d their\n      right to plead not guilty is small, the appearance of evidence that\n      is inconsistent with guilt is unpredictable, the significance of such\n      evidence should be more apparent to the defense than to the trial\n      court, and cases are common in which there is some evidence in\n      the defendant\u2019s favor but the defendant . . . had validly chosen to\n\n                                        4\n\f      plead guilty after weighing the advantage of such a plea against the\n      chance of acquittal.\n\n            In this case the appellant . . . wavie[d] his right to a plea of\n      not guilty. . . . His attention was specifically called to the\n      inconsistency between his plea of guilty and his testimony about\n      lack of intent or knowledge. . . . The appellant did not ask to\n      withdraw his plea. If it had been in his interest to do so, he would\n      have known it.\n\n             It is reasonable to put on such a defendant the requirement\n      of timely seeking, in one way or another, to withdraw the plea of\n      guilty. The appellant not having done so, he may not complain for\n      the first time on appeal that the trial court did not do it for him.\n\nMendez v. State, 138 S.W.3d 334, 350 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). Accordingly,\n\nalthough a defendant has the right to withdraw his guilty plea in a timely\n\nfashion, the trial court has no duty to sua sponte withdraw the plea in the\n\nabsence of such a request. Id.; Martinez v. State, No. 02-04-00019-CR, 2004\n\nWL 1798091, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth Aug. 12, 2004, no pet.) (mem op.)\n\n(not designated for publication).\n\n      Here, Neely pleaded guilty to the alleged offense, signed written plea\n\nadmonishments and a judicial confession admitting guilt, and waived all rights\n\ngiven to him by law pursuant to code of criminal procedure article 1.14. He\n\nhad the right to timely withdraw his guilty plea or attempt to withdraw his\n\nguilty plea after the trial court took the case under advisement or pronounced\n\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\fjudgment. 2   But at no point during the proceeding below did Neely ask to\n\nwithdraw his plea, even in light of numerous questions propounded by the trial\n\ncourt upon him inquiring into the circumstances surrounding the offense, which\n\nessentially called his attention to the alleged inconsistency between his plea of\n\nguilty and his testimony about lack of knowledge or intent.          In fact, Neely\n\nexpressly indicated his desire that the case go forward on his plea of guilty and\n\nthat he would object to the trial court returning the case to a jury for trial. The\n\nfollowing exchange occurred:\n\n      The Court: And you were specifically asking me to go forward,\n      proceed with the sentencing on the entire record and not return this\n      case for trial; is that an accurate statement?\n\n      [Neely]: Yes.\n\n      [Defense counsel]: Yes, Your Honor.\n\n      The Court: In fact, you object to me returning it to a jury for trial if\n      I wanted to do that; is that still your position?\n\n      [Defense counsel]: Your Honor, he\u2019s indicated he just wished to go\n      forward.\n\n\n      2\n      \u2026 See Gonzalez v. State, No. 02-07-00241-CR, 2008 WL 755514, at\n*1 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth Mar. 20, 2008, no pet. h.) (mem op.) (not\ndesignated for publication) (stating that defendant may withdraw guilty plea as\na matter of right without assigning reason at any time before judgment has\nbeen pronounced or the case has been taken under advisement, but that the\nwithdrawal of the plea is within the sound discretion of the trial court if\ndefendant decides to withdraw guilty plea after the trial court takes the case\nunder advisement or pronounces judgment).\n\n                                         6\n\f               ....\n\n      The Court: Knowing everything you know about the law, the facts\n      and everything that happened and discussing that in private with\n      your attorney and listening to everything that\u2019s been said today and\n      the questions and everything else, as you sit there today, you still\n      persist in your guilty plea because you believe yourself to be legally\n      responsible as an accomplice to the actions of the other two\n      gentlemen that you\u2019ve described here today; is that correct?\n\n      [Neely]: That\u2019s correct.\n\nBecause Neely did not ask to withdraw his guilty plea in one way or another,\n\nhe may not complain for the first time on appeal that the trial court erred by\n\naccepting his alleged involuntary plea.     See Mendez, 138 S.W.3d at 350.\n\nConsequently, Neely has forfeited his complaint on appeal.

App. 2003) (holding that, when defendant has waived jury trial and\n\npleaded guilty, trial court has no duty to conduct special proceeding inquiring\n\ninto voluntary nature of plea when evidence inconsistent with guilt is\n\nintroduced).\n\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\fWe overrule Neely\u2019s sole issue and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                          DIXON W.
