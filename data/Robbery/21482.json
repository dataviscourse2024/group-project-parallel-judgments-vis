In his plea, defendant admitted, among other enhancements,\none prior strike conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\f          Prior to sentencing, defendant submitted a Romero1 motion, asking the court to\ndismiss his prior strike. The court denied defendant\u2019s Romero motion and sentenced him\nto 16 years in prison.\n          On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred when it denied his motion to\nsuppress and motion to quash. Defendant additionally argues the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in denying his motion to dismiss his prior strike conviction. We disagree and\naffirm.\n                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n          A few weeks before the date of the offenses at issue here, City of Davis Police\nOfficer Justin Infante responded to a call regarding the burglary of a storage unit in\nwhich, among other things, a custom knitted blanket was reported stolen. On January 31,\n2013, the victim of that burglary was at the storage facility when he observed his custom\nknitted blanket hanging in an open storage unit, later determined to be rented to Amanda\nSteele-Pfleger. The victim saw one female and one male standing near the open unit,\nlater identified as Steele-Pfleger and defendant. A vehicle, subsequently determined to\nbe registered to defendant, was parked within five feet of the unit. The victim contacted\nthe police and Officer Infante and Corporal Jeff Beasley reported to the storage facility.\n          Upon arriving at the storage facility, the officers saw a custom knitted blanket\nalong with two methamphetamine pipes in Steele-Pfleger\u2019s unit. The officers detained\ndefendant in a patrol car for suspected involvement with the stolen property, and they\narrested Steele-Pfleger on an outstanding warrant and placed her in a separate patrol car.\nWhile waiting in the patrol car, Steele-Pfleger summoned Officer Infante through the\ncar\u2019s open window, accused defendant of being \u201ca big dope dealer,\u201d and said defendant\nhad narcotics inside his vehicle \u201cunder the power window control panel [on] the driver\n\n\n\n\n1         People v. Superior Court (Romero) (1996) 13 Cal. 4th 497.\n\n                                                2\n\fside door.\u201d Officer Infante then inspected defendant\u2019s vehicle by \u201cmanipulat[ing] the\ncontrol panel to see if it was loose or had been tampered with.\u201d The control panel easily\npopped off and Officer Infante saw a round, black case inside the panel. Officer Infante\nretrieved the case, opened the top, and observed what he believed to be\nmethamphetamine. Defendant was then placed under arrest for possession of\nmethamphetamine for sale and possession of methamphetamine pipes.\n       Officer Infante gave the suspected methamphetamine to Yolo County Narcotics\nEnforcement Team Agent Ryan Bellamy. Agent Bellamy tested and weighed the\nsuspected narcotics and found the seized baggies weighed 3.3, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, and 3.5\ngrams respectively and returned positive color reactions for methamphetamine. Agent\nBellamy then obtained a search warrant for defendant\u2019s residence based upon the above\ninformation. Upon the warrant\u2019s execution, officers found what they believed to be two\npay/owe sheets, individual bags containing a white powder that did not produce a positive\ncolor reaction for methamphetamine or cocaine, a methamphetamine smoking pipe,\nnumerous surveillance cameras, and a handwritten note of the address of Steele-Pfleger\u2019s\nstorage unit.\n       The prosecution charged defendant with transportation of methamphetamine,\npossession of methamphetamine for sale, possession of a false compartment designed for\nstoring controlled substances, and possession of controlled substance paraphernalia.\nDefendant moved to suppress all evidence seized from his vehicle and moved to quash\nthe search warrant. At the suppression hearing, the trial court ruled Officer Infante did\nnot conduct a search when he manipulated defendant\u2019s vehicle door panel, but upon\ndoing so and seeing the container within, had probable cause to search the container.\nBased on the court\u2019s finding that no illegal search occurred, the court denied defendant\u2019s\nmotion to quash. Defendant subsequently pled no contest to all charges and admitted\nhaving a prior strike within the meaning of the three strikes law.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       Before sentencing, defendant submitted a Romero motion, requesting the court\ndismiss his prior 1986 strike conviction for burglary. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s\nmotion and sentenced him under the three strikes law to 16 years, four months in prison.\nThis timely appeal followed.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                               I\n       The Motion To Suppress And The Motion To Quash Were Properly Denied\n       Defendant first argues the trial court erred when it held Officer Infante did not\nconduct a search when he dismantled defendant\u2019s vehicle door panel. Secondly, he\ncontends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because no exception to\nthe warrant requirement would have permitted the warrantless search of his vehicle.\nLastly, defendant argues it was error to dismiss his motion to quash the search warrant for\nhis home because the warrant was tainted by the illegal search of his vehicle. We agree\nwith defendant\u2019s first argument, but disagree with his latter two.\n       \u201cThe standard of appellate review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress\nis well settled. We view the record in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s ruling\nand defer to its findings of historical fact, whether express or implied, if they are\nsupported by substantial evidence. We then decide for ourselves what legal principles are\nrelevant, independently apply them to the historical facts, and determine as a matter of\nlaw whether there has been an unreasonable search and/or seizure.\u201d (People v. Knight\n(2004) 121 Cal. App. 4th 1568, 1572.)\n                                              A\n                       Officer Infante Conducted A Search When He\n                       Manipulated Defendant\u2019s Vehicle Door Panel\n       Defendant argues, and the People properly concede, that Officer Infante\u2019s\nmanipulation of defendant\u2019s vehicle door panel was a search within the meaning of the\nFourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment states, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he right of\n\n                                              4\n\fpeople to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d (U.S. Const., 4th Amend.) It is well\nrecognized that a person\u2019s vehicle is considered an effect within the meaning of the\nFourth Amendment. (United States v. Jones (2012) 565 U.S. ___ [181 L. Ed. 2d 911, 917-\n918].) It is likewise established that a government\u2019s trespassory, physical intrusion of a\nperson\u2019s effect is a search under the Fourth Amendment. (Id. at pp. ___-___ [181\nL.Ed.2d at pp. 918-922].) Thus, Officer Infante\u2019s entry into defendant\u2019s vehicle and\nphysical dismantling of his door panel was a clear search under the Fourth Amendment.\n                                              B\n                   The Search Of Defendant\u2019s Vehicle Was Reasonable\n       The People assert the search of defendant\u2019s vehicle was justified under the\nautomobile exception to the warrant requirement.2 We agree.\n       A warrantless search of an automobile is reasonable within the meaning of the\nFourth Amendment when an officer has probable cause to believe the vehicle contains\ncontraband. (United States v. Ross (1982) 456 U.S. 798, 824 [72 L. Ed. 2d 572, 593].) \u201cIf\nprobable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of\nevery part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.\u201d (Id.\nat p. 825 [72 L.Ed.2d at p. 594].) Whether there is probable cause to search a car is\ngoverned by the same standards as any other probable cause determination: could a\nneutral and detached magistrate make a decision, considering the totality of the\ncircumstances, \u201cincluding the \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying\nhearsay information, [that] there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a\n\n\n\n\n2      The People also argue the search was justified as a search incident to arrest and an\ninventory search. Because we conclude the search was lawful under the automobile\nexception, we do not address the People\u2019s two other justifications for the search.\n\n                                              5\n\fcrime will be found in a particular place[?]\u201d (Illinois v. Gates (1983) 462 U.S. 213, 238\n[76 L. Ed. 2d 527, 548].)\n       Defendant argues probable cause to search his vehicle did not exist because the\ninformation concerning the locality of the methamphetamine came from an unreliable\nand untested informant whose statement was not corroborated before the search occurred.\nDefendant relies on People v. Lissauer (1985) 169 Cal. App. 3d 413 to support his\ncontention. In Lissauer, an untested informant provided information concerning the\ndefendant\u2019s involvement in drug sales. (Id. at p. 417.) Law enforcement officers set up\nsurveillance on the defendant\u2019s house, followed his car, stopped and searched his car, and\nfound contraband in the backseat. (Id. at p 418.) The defendant pled guilty to possession\nof marijuana after the trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence found in his\nvehicle during the warrantless search. (Id. at p. 416.)\n       The Lissauer court stated that in determining whether \u201c \u2018there is a fair probability\nthat contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place[,]\u2019 \u201d \u201cthe\n\u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of [an] informant must be assessed\u201d alongside any\ncorroboration of an untested informant\u2019s tip. (People v. Lissauer, supra, 169 Cal.App.3d\nat p. 422, quoting Illinois v. Gates, supra, 462 U.S. at p. 238 [76 L.Ed.2d at p. 548].) The\ncourt held probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s vehicle did not exist, reasoning the\ncircumstances known to officers did not establish the reliability of the informant, despite\nthe information being corroborated. (Id. at p. 423.) The court noted the informant\u2019s\ninformation was \u201csuch as could be acquired by any casual observer\u201d and the basis of the\ninformant\u2019s knowledge and the informant\u2019s relationship with the defendant was never\ndetermined. (Ibid.)\n       While it is true Officer Infante had no prior interaction with Steele-Pfleger,\nthereby making her an untested informant, defendant is mistaken in assuming Steele-\nPfleger was an unreliable informant whose information could not serve as a basis for\nprobable cause. In contrast to Lissauer, where the untested informant provided only a\n\n                                             6\n\fvague statement that the defendant was engaged in selling drugs, Steele-Pfleger\u2019s\nstatement was very specific and not information that would be known by a casual\nobserver, but someone who was close with defendant. Similarly, unlike Lissauer where\nofficers were unaware of the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge, the surrounding\ncircumstances in the present case could have reasonably led Officer Infante to infer that\nSteele-Pfleger knew about the hidden methamphetamine because she was a companion of\ndefendant. Defendant and Steele-Pfleger were reportedly seen at the storage facility\ntogether by the victim of the prior burglary and Officer Infante and Corporal Beasley\ncontacted the two together at the unit, thus providing a basis upon which Officer Infante\ncould reasonably infer the two had some type of relationship. Secondly, only defendant\u2019s\nvehicle was at the facility, creating an inference that the two arrived at the unit together\nand supporting the belief that the two were companions. Given the specificity of Steele-\nPfleger\u2019s statement and the fact defendant was with Steele-Pfleger at her storage unit,\nOfficer Infante could have reasonably inferred that Steele-Pfleger knew about the\nmethamphetamine in the vehicle door panel because she was a companion of defendant,\nand thus provided reliable information.\n       Because we conclude Officer Infante could have reasonably inferred the basis of\nSteele-Pfleger\u2019s information was reliable, we conclude her statement regarding the\npresence of methamphetamine in defendant\u2019s vehicle coupled with Officer Infante seeing\ntwo methamphetamine pipes in the storage unit where defendant was standing indicates a\n\u201cfair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime w[ould] be found in\u201d defendant\u2019s\nvehicle. (Illinois v. Gates, supra, 462 U.S. at p. 238 [76 L.Ed.2d at p. 548].) As such,\nOfficer Infante could legally search the vehicle\u2019s control panel and the contents within\nthe panel that could conceal the object of the search. Thus, defendant\u2019s motion to\nsuppress was properly denied. Furthermore, since we conclude the search of defendant\u2019s\nvehicle was lawful, the search warrant for defendant\u2019s residence was not tainted by any\nillegality, so the motion to quash the search warrant was also properly denied.\n\n                                              7\n\f                                               II\n                        The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion\n                        When It Denied Defendant\u2019s Romero Motion\n       Defendant argues the trial court abused its discretion by failing to dismiss his prior\nstrike conviction. We disagree. Trial courts have discretion under Penal Code\nsection 1385 to dismiss a prior strike when a court finds a defendant falls outside the\nspirit of the three strikes law. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1385; People v. Superior Court (Romero),\nsupra, 13 Cal.4th at pp. 529-530.) In deciding whether to exercise this discretion, the\ncourt \u201cmust consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of his present\nfelonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his\nbackground, character, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the scheme\u2019s\nspirit, in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously\nbeen convicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies.\u201d (People v. Williams\n(1998) 17 Cal. 4th 148, 161.)\n       Appellate courts review a trial court\u2019s \u201cfailure to dismiss or strike a prior [felony]\nconviction allegation . . . under the deferential abuse of discretion standard.\u201d (People v.\nCarmony (2004) 33 Cal. 4th 367, 374.) A trial court will not abuse its discretion \u201cunless\nits decision is so irrational or arbitrary that no reasonable person could agree with it.\u201d\n(Id. at p. 377.) As such, \u201ca trial court will only abuse its discretion in failing to strike a\nprior felony conviction allegation in limited circumstances.\u201d (Id. at p. 378.)\n       Defendant has the following criminal record: a 1986 conviction for burglary,\nresulting in a strike; a 1987 misdemeanor conviction for possession of a controlled\nsubstance; a 1988 misdemeanor conviction for trespassing; a 1990 misdemeanor\nconviction for being under the influence of a controlled substance; three 1991 convictions\nfor selling or distributing hypodermic needles without a license, possession of a\ncontrolled substance, and transporting a controlled substance for sale; a 1992 felony\nconviction for possession of a controlled substance; a 1994 felony conviction for\n\n                                               8\n\fpossession of a controlled substance for sale; a 1996 trespassing conviction; a 1997\nfelony conviction for possession of a controlled substance; and three 2003 convictions for\npossession of a controlled substance, possession of a device used to inject or smoke a\ncontrolled substance, and transporting a controlled substance, for which he was sentenced\nto six years in prison. Defendant was not convicted of another offense until the present\ncase. While released on bail in this case though, defendant was arrested on two separate\noccasions. As a result of these arrests, defendant has been charged with possession of a\ncontrolled substance, possession of marijuana for sale, and possession of\nmethamphetamine for sale in one case; and, in a separate case, he has been charged with\npossession of methamphetamine for sale.\n       Defendant argues the remoteness of his prior strike and the nonviolent nature of\nhis prior offenses take him outside the spirit of the three strikes law. Defendant\nemphasizes that his one strike occurred when he was 18 years old and stole a VCR from\nhis parents\u2019 home, and he asserts his criminal history is a result of a lifelong struggle with\ndrug addiction. However, these contentions amount to a simple disagreement as to the\nconclusion the trial court drew from the facts, as the record reflects the trial court\nconsidered both the remoteness of defendant\u2019s strike along with the nonviolent nature of\nhis prior convictions when analyzing his Romero motion. The trial court noted his\n\u201coriginal conviction . . . is somewhat mitigating from the standpoint that he was young,\nthat he was apparently using drugs, and he just stole a VCR. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] [And, the]\nincident happened 28 years ago.\u201d Additionally, the trial court acknowledged that his\nnumerous convictions were \u201cpretty much all drug related, some personal use, [and] some\nsales related.\u201d Despite these acknowledgments, the trial court ultimately concluded these\nfactors did not outweigh defendant\u2019s inability to live a \u201clegally blameless life up to [the\ncurrent] offense or since [the current] offense\u201d and thus, denied defendant\u2019s Romero\nmotion.\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f       The standard for abuse of discretion is not reasonable disagreement, but manifest\nirrationality or arbitrariness. (People v. Carmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 377.) Because,\nas we explain, the trial court\u2019s conclusion not to grant defendant\u2019s Romero motion was\nnot irrational or arbitrary, we are not authorized to substitute our judgment for the\njudgment of the trial judge. (Ibid.)\n           Defendant has demonstrated a continuous inability to reform his behavior to that\nof a law-abiding citizen. Although he exhibited a period of lawfulness between his\nrelease from prison in 2008 and his arrest for the current offense in 2013, it is clear from\nhis criminal history that, as the trial court noted, he has not lived a \u201clegally blameless life\nup to [the current] offense or since [the current] offense.\u201d Only under extraordinary\ncircumstances may \u201ca career criminal . . . be deemed to fall outside the spirit of the very\nscheme within which he squarely falls.\u201d (People v. Strong (2001) 87 Cal. App. 4th 328,\n338.) As such, we cannot conclude the trial court\u2019s judgment that defendant\u2019s proclivity\nfor crime outweighed other mitigating factors was so irrational or arbitrary as to amount\nto an abuse of discretion.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n                                                   /s/\n                                                   Robie, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n/s/\nNicholson, Acting P.
