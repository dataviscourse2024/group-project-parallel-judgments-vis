The trial court has certified that this \"is a plea-bargain case, and the\r\ndefendant has NO right of appeal.\"  See Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(a)(2).\r\n\r\n\tOn December 14, 2006, this Court notified appellant's counsel of the trial\r\ncourt's certification and ordered counsel to: (1) review the record; (2) determine\r\nwhether appellant has a right to appeal; and (3) forward to this Court, by letter,\r\ncounsel's findings as to whether appellant has a right to appeal, or, alternatively,\r\nadvise this Court as to the existence of any amended certification.\r\n\r\n\tOn January 12, 2007, counsel filed a letter brief with this Court.  Counsel's\r\nresponse does not establish (1) that the certification currently on file with this Court\r\nis incorrect or (2) that appellant otherwise has a right to appeal.  \r\n\r\n\tThe Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure provide that an appeal must be\r\ndismissed if the trial court's certification does not show that the defendant has the\r\nright of appeal.  Tex. R. App. P. 25.2(d); see Tex. R. App. P. 37.1, 44.3, 44.4.\r\nAccordingly, this appeal is dismissed.  Any pending motions are denied as moot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPER CURIAM\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not publish.  Tex. R. App. P. 47.2(b).\r\n\r\nMemorandum Opinion delivered and filed this\r\n\r\nthe 1st day of February, 2007.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
