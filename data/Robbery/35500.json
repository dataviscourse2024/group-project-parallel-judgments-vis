THOMPSON, JUDGES.\n\nTHOMPSON, K., JUDGE: Rodger Lee Cox appeals pro se from the Taylor\n\nCircuit Court\u2019s order summarily denying his motion to vacate his sentence\n\npursuant to Kentucky Rules of Criminal Procedure (RCr) 11.42 based on\n\nineffective assistance of counsel. As Cox has failed to establish any error or\n\nprejudice, we affirm.\n\f            In February of 2018, Cox unlawfully entered a residence located in\n\nCampbellsville, Kentucky, from which he stole items valued at approximately\n\n$45,000. As a result, in 18-CR-00125-001, Cox was indicted in Taylor Circuit\n\nCourt on one count of second-degree burglary pursuant to Kentucky Revised\n\nStatutes (KRS) 511.030; one count of receiving stolen property, $10,000 or more\n\npursuant to KRS 514.110; and one count of being a first-degree persistent felony\n\noffender (PFO 1) pursuant to KRS 532.080(3).\n\n            In May of 2018, Cox cashed a stolen check in the amount of $135 at\n\nOM Foodmart in Mannsville, Kentucky, and he cashed another stolen check in the\n\namount of $110.50 at a Highway 70 Mart in Campbellsville, Kentucky. As a\n\nresult, in 18-CR-00255, Cox was indicted in Taylor Circuit Court on two counts of\n\nsecond-degree criminal possession of a forged instrument pursuant to KRS\n\n516.060, and one count of being a PFO 1.\n\n            On March 19, 2019, the Taylor Circuit Court approved Cox\u2019s plea\n\nagreement with the Commonwealth, whereby he pled guilty to the substantive\n\ncharges in both cases, the PFO enhancements were dismissed and he was\n\nsentenced to six years\u2019 imprisonment. The Taylor Circuit Court also noted that in\n\nFebruary of 2019, Cox had entered guilty pleas in two other cases in Marion\n\nCircuit Court (18-CR-00222 and 18-CR-00023). In those unrelated cases, Cox had\n\nbeen indicted on two counts of second-degree burglary, one count of possession of\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fa handgun by a convicted felon, and one count of possession of a firearm by a\n\nconvicted felon, and he was ultimately sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nConsidering that, the Taylor Circuit Court ordered Cox\u2019s six-year term of\n\nimprisonment in 18-CR-00255 and 18-CR-00125-001 to run concurrently with his\n\nten-year term arising from 18-CR-00222 and 18-CR-00023. In short, Cox received\n\nno additional time in custody due to his cases in Taylor Circuit Court.\n\n             Thereafter, in January of 2020, Cox filed both a motion to vacate his\n\nsentences in the two Taylor Circuit Court cases pursuant to RCr 11.42 and a\n\nmotion for an evidentiary hearing. On March 26, 2020, the Taylor Circuit Court\n\ndenied both Cox\u2019s RCr 11.42 motion and his motion for an evidentiary hearing.\n\nCox thereafter filed this appeal.\n\n             In a motion brought under RCr 11.42, \u201c[t]he movant has the burden of\n\nestablishing convincingly that he or she was deprived of some substantial right\n\nwhich would justify the extraordinary relief provided by [a] post-conviction\n\nproceeding.\u201d Simmons v. Commonwealth, 191 S.W.3d 557, 561 (Ky. 2006),\n\noverruled on other grounds by Leonard v. Commonwealth, 279 S.W.3d 151, 159\n\n(Ky. 2009). An RCr 11.42 motion \u201cis limited to issues that were not and could not\n\nbe raised on direct appeal.\u201d Simmons, 191 S.W.3d at 561.\n\n             A successful petition for relief under RCr 11.42 for ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel must survive the twin prongs of \u201cperformance\u201d and\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f\u201cprejudice\u201d provided in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct.\n\n2052, 2064, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984); accord Gall v. Commonwealth, 702 S.W.2d\n\n37, 39-40 (Ky. 1985). As explained by the Kentucky Supreme Court, \u201c[a]\n\ndeficient performance contains errors so serious that counsel was not functioning\n\nas the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. McGorman, 489 S.W.3d 731, 736 (Ky. 2016) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted). Moreover, \u201ca court must indulge a strong\n\npresumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable\n\nprofessional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that,\n\nunder the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial\n\nstrategy.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). As further stated in Strickland, \u201cthe court should recognize that counsel\n\nis strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant\n\ndecisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d Id. at 690, 104 S.\n\nCt. at 2066.\n\n               As to the second Strickland prong, the defendant has the duty to\n\n\u201caffirmatively prove prejudice.\u201d Id. at 693, 104 S. Ct. at 2067. In the context of a\n\nguilty plea:\n\n               A conclusory allegation to the effect that absent the error\n               the movant would have insisted upon a trial is not\n               enough. The movant must allege facts that, if proven,\n               would support a conclusion that the decision to reject the\n\n                                           -4-\n\f             plea bargain and go to trial would have been rational,\n             e.g., valid defenses, a pending suppression motion that\n             could undermine the prosecution\u2019s case, or the realistic\n             potential for a lower sentence.\n\nStiger v. Commonwealth, 381 S.W.3d 230, 237 (Ky. 2012) (citations and footnote\n\nomitted).\n\n             Appellate review of the denial of an RCr 11.42 motion is de novo.\n\nMcGorman, 489 S.W.3d at 736. Where the trial court does not hold an evidentiary\n\nhearing on an RCr 11.42 motion, appellate review is limited to \u201cwhether the\n\nmotion on its face states grounds that are not conclusively refuted by the record\n\nand which, if true, would invalidate the conviction.\u201d Lewis v. Commonwealth, 411\n\nS.W.2d 321, 322 (Ky. 1967). An evidentiary hearing is only required \u201cif there is a\n\nmaterial issue of fact that cannot be conclusively resolved, i.e., conclusively\n\nproved or disproved, by an examination of the record.\u201d Fraser v. Commonwealth,\n\n59 S.W.3d 448, 452 (Ky. 2001).\n\n             In Cox v. Commonwealth, No. 2020-CA-0250-MR, 2020 WL\n\n6538807 (Ky.App. Nov. 6, 2020) (unpublished), Cox unsuccessfully appealed the\n\nMarion Circuit Court\u2019s denial of his RCr 11.42 motion and his motion for an\n\nevidentiary hearing relative to 18-CR-00222 and 18-CR-00023. There, Cox\n\noffered many of the same arguments he now offers in this appeal, without\n\nidentifying any specific facts which differ from his Marion Circuit Court cases and\n\nhis Taylor Circuit Court cases. To the extent that his arguments are duplicative in\n\n                                         -5-\n\fall their particulars, the record before us gives us no reason to differ from how we\n\npreviously resolved them:\n\n                    Turning to the first error Cox alleges on appeal,\n             Cox claims that his trial counsel neglected to reveal to\n             Cox certain recanted witness statements before Cox\n             entered his guilty plea. Because Cox is essentially\n             arguing that his guilty plea was invalid, he \u201cmust allege\n             with particularity specific facts which, if true, would\n             render the plea involuntary under the Fourteenth\n             Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, would render the plea\n             so tainted by counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance as to violate\n             the Sixth Amendment, or would otherwise clearly render\n             the plea invalid.\u201d Stiger, 381 S.W.3d at 234 (emphasis\n             added).\n\n                     Here, Cox provides no specific details as to the\n             actual content of either the original testimony or to the\n             claimed recanted testimony. He fails to explain how the\n             claimed recanted testimony rendered his guilty plea\n             involuntary under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due\n             Process Clause, nor does he clarify or give specific facts\n             as to why he would have rejected the plea deal had his\n             trial counsel disclosed the allegedly recanted statements\n             and why such rejection would have been rational.\n             Finally, he fails to allege with particularity why the\n             disclosure of the alleged recanted testimony \u201cwould\n             otherwise clearly render the plea invalid.\u201d Id. Therefore,\n             Cox cannot claim post-conviction relief based on this\n             claim.\n\n                    Cox next argues that his counsel was ineffective in\n             failing to file a motion to suppress evidence seized from\n             a location that Cox describes as \u201cUpper 70 Stone Creek\n             Road.\u201d We again emphasize that \u201cto be entitled to relief\n             under RCr 11.42, the movant must \u2018state specifically the\n             grounds on which the sentence is being challenged and\n             the facts on which the movant relies in support of such\n             grounds.\u2019\u201d Roach v. Commonwealth, 384 S.W.3d 131,\n\n                                         -6-\n\f             140 (Ky. 2012) (citation omitted). Moreover,\n             \u201c[c]onclusory allegations that counsel was ineffective\n             without a statement of the facts upon which those\n             allegations are based do not meet the rule\u2019s specificity\n             standard and so \u2018warrant a summary dismissal of the\n             motion.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted).\n\n                     Here, Cox has failed to show any basis upon which\n             his trial counsel could have argued that any evidence\n             resulting from the search of the location should have\n             been suppressed. Cox does not claim, nor does the\n             record reveal, that Cox had any sort of property interest\n             or other type of interest in the Upper 70 Stone Creek\n             Road location to indicate that he would have a reasonable\n             expectation of privacy. See Watkins v. Commonwealth,\n             307 S.W.3d 628, 629-30 (Ky. 2010) (citation omitted)\n             (\u201c[I]n order to have standing [to claim a violation under\n             the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution\n             or Section Ten of the Kentucky Constitution], the person\n             claiming must have a \u2018reasonable expectation of privacy\u2019\n             in the place to be searched.\u201d). Because Cox\u2019s claim\n             regarding the search of Upper 70 Stone Creek Road\n             lacked the required specificity regarding such expectation\n             of privacy, he cannot obtain post-conviction relief.\n             Stiger, 381 S.W.3d at 234.\n\nId. at *2.\n\n             Cox next alleges that his trial attorney was ineffective for counseling\n\nhim to accept a plea deal that violated his constitutional rights against double\n\njeopardy. Cox contends that, in pleading guilty to burglary and receiving stolen\n\nproperty in 18-CR-00125-001, his double jeopardy rights were violated because he\n\nwas convicted twice for the same conduct. We disagree. It is well-established that\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fconvictions for burglary and receiving stolen property do not violate double\n\njeopardy. See Phillips v. Commonwealth, 679 S.W.2d 235, 236-37 (Ky. 1984).\n\n             Next, Cox argues his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to file a\n\nmotion for the trial judge to recuse himself. In support, Cox points out that the\n\ntrial judge, Hon. Samuel Spalding, was his attorney in 2005 on another criminal\n\nmatter, and that after that matter concluded, Cox filed an RCr 11.42 motion against\n\nSpalding, which was unsuccessful. See Cox v. Commonwealth, No. 2009-CA-\n\n000237-MR, 2010 WL 3717237 (Ky.App. Sep. 24, 2010) (unpublished). This\n\nargument is without merit. First, Cox does not assert that he had ever even advised\n\nhis counsel that: (1) Judge Spalding had previously represented him; or (2) there\n\nwas some basis to believe that Judge Spalding would not be impartial. Without\n\nhaving any knowledge of facts, or any basis to believe there were facts that would\n\nsupport a motion to recuse, Cox\u2019s counsel cannot be faulted for not filing such a\n\nmotion. Second, Cox has failed to inform any court of any conduct on Judge\n\nSpalding\u2019s part which would cause us to question Judge Spalding\u2019s impartiality or\n\nwould have required his mandatory recusal under the Rules of the Supreme Court\n\n(SCR) 4.300, Rule 2.7. Abbott, Inc. v. Guirguis, 626 S.W.3d 475, 485 (Ky. 2021).\n\nMost critically, Cox does not explain how Judge Spalding presiding over his case,\n\nor his counsel\u2019s failure to make motion to recuse Judge Spalding, caused Cox\n\nprejudice. As indicated, the trial court accepted Cox\u2019s plea deal with the\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fCommonwealth which allowed Cox to avoid any additional jail time, despite his\n\neligibility for additional time under the PFO statute.\n\n             Lastly, as Cox did in his appeal of his Marion Circuit Court cases, he\n\nchallenges the denial of his motion for an evidentiary hearing. We believe our\n\nprevious reasoning in resolution in those cases is equally appropriate here:\n\n             Cox contends the trial court wrongfully deprived him of\n             an evidentiary hearing. However, he is \u201cnot\n             automatically entitled\u201d to such a hearing. Stanford v.\n             Commonwealth, 854 S.W.2d 742, 743 (Ky. 1993)\n             (citation omitted). Only if there is \u201ca material issue of\n             fact that cannot be determined on the face of the record\u201d\n             must the trial court allow an evidentiary hearing. Id.\n             (citation omitted). As stated by the Kentucky Supreme\n             Court, if the record refutes the claims of error, there is no\n             basis for holding an evidentiary hearing. Id. (citing Glass\n             v. Commonwealth, 474 S.W.2d 400, 401 (Ky. 1971)). In\n             this case, the trial court correctly determined, based on\n             the record and as previously discussed, that no material\n             issue of fact existed. Thus, we can discern no error in the\n             trial court\u2019s decision to not hold an evidentiary hearing in\n             this case.\n\nCox, 2020 WL 6538807, at *3.\n\n             Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Taylor Circuit Court\u2019s order\n\nsummarily denying Cox\u2019s RCr 11.42 motion for relief from the ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.\n\n             ALL CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fBRIEFS FOR APPELLANT:      BRIEF FOR APPELLEE:\n\nRodger Lee Cox, pro se     Daniel Cameron\nEddyville, Kentucky        Attorney General of Kentucky\n\n                           Robert Baldridge\n                           Assistant Attorney General\n                           Frankfort, Kentucky\n\n\n\n\n                         -10-\n\f",
